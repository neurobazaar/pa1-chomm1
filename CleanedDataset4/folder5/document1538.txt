Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

SCENE Britain Rome



ACT FIRST

SCENE I Britain The garden of Cymbelines palace

FIRST GENTLEMAN
You do not meet a man but frowns Our bloods
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
Still seem as does the King

SECOND GENTLEMAN
But whats the matter

FIRST GENTLEMAN
His daughter and the heir ofs kingdom whom
He purposd to his wifes sole sona widow
That late he marriedhath referrd herself
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman Shes wedded
Her husband banishd she imprisond all
Is outward sorrow though I think the King
Be touchd at very heart

SECOND GENTLEMAN
None but the King

FIRST GENTLEMAN
He that hath lost her too so is the Queen
That most desird the match but not a courtier
Although they wear their faces to the bent
Of the Kings looks hath a heart that is not
Glad at the thing they scowl at

SECOND GENTLEMAN
And why so

FIRST GENTLEMAN
He that hath missd the Princess is a thing
Too bad for bad report and he that hath her
I mean that married her alack good man
And therefore banishdis a creature such
As to seek through the regions of the earth
For one his like there would be something failing
In him that should compare I do not think
So fair an outward and such stuff within
Endows a man but he

SECOND GENTLEMAN
You speak him far

FIRST GENTLEMAN
I do extend him sir within himself
Crush him together rather than unfold
His measure duly

SECOND GENTLEMAN
Whats his name and birth

FIRST GENTLEMAN
I cannot delve him to the root His father
Was calld Sicilius who did join his honour
Against the Romans with Cassibelan
But had his titles by Tenantius whom
He servd with glory and admird success
So gaind the suraddition Leonatus
And had besides this gentleman in question
Two other sons who in the wars o the time
Died with their swords in hand for which their father
Then old and fond of issue took such sorrow
That he quit being and his gentle lady
Big of this gentleman our theme deceasd
As he was born The King he takes the babe
To his protection calls him Posthumus Leonatus
Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber
Puts to him all the learnings that his time
Could make him the receiver of which he took
As we do air fast as twas ministred
And ins spring became a harvest livd in court
Which rare it is to domost praisd most lovd
A sample to the youngest to the more mature
A glass that feated them and to the graver
A child that guided dotards to his mistress
For whom he now is banishdher own price
Proclaims how she esteemd him and his virtue
By her election may be truly read
What kind of man he is

SECOND GENTLEMAN
I honour him
Even out of your report But pray you tell me
Is she sole child to the King

FIRST GENTLEMAN
His only child
He had two sonsif this be worth your hearing
Mark itthe eldest of them at three years old
I the swathingclothes the other from their nursery
Were stolen and to this hour no guess in knowledge
Which way they went

SECOND GENTLEMAN
How long is this ago

FIRST GENTLEMAN Some twenty years

SECOND GENTLEMAN
That a kings children should be so conveyd
So slackly guarded and the search so slow
That could not trace them

FIRST GENTLEMAN
Howsoeer tis strange
Or that the negligence may well be laughd at
Yet is it true sir

SECOND GENTLEMAN
I do well believe you

FIRST GENTLEMAN
We must forbear here comes the gentleman
The Queen and Princess

Exeunt

Enter the QUEEN POSTHUMUS and IMOGEN

QUEEN
No be assurd you shall not find me daughter
After the slander of most stepmothers
Evileyd unto you Youre my prisoner but
Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
That lock up your restraint For you Posthumus
So soon as I can win the offended King
I will be known your advocate Marry yet
The fire of rage is in him and twere good
You leand unto his sentence with what patience
Your wisdom may inform you

POSTHUMUS
Please your Highness
I will from hence today

QUEEN
You know the peril
Ill fetch a turn about the garden pitying
The pangs of barrd affections though the King
Hath chargd you should not speak together

Exit

IMOGEN
O dissembling courtesy How fine this tyrant
Can tickle where she wounds My dearest husband
I something fear my fathers wrath but nothing
Always reservd my holy dutywhat
His rage can do on me You must be gone
And I shall here abide the hourly shot
Of angry eyes not comforted to live
But that there is this jewel in the world
That I may see again

POSTHUMUS
My queen my mistress
O lady weep no more lest I give cause
To be suspected of more tenderness
Than doth become a man I will remain
The loyalst husband that did eer plight troth
My residence in Rome at one Philarios
Who to my father was a friend to me
Known but by letter thither write my queen
And with mine eyes Ill drink the words you send
Though ink be made of gall

Reenter QUEEN

QUEEN
Be brief I pray you
If the King come I shall incur I know not
How much of his displeasure

Aside

Yet Ill move him
To walk this way I never do him wrong
But he does buy my injuries to be friends
Pays dear for my offences

Exit

POSTHUMUS
Should we be taking leave
As long a term as yet we have to live
The loathness to depart would grow Adieu

IMOGEN
Nay stay a little
Were you but riding forth to air yourself
Such parting were too petty Look here love
This diamond was my mothers Take it heart
But keep it till you woo another wife
When Imogen is dead

POSTHUMUS
How how another
You gentle gods give me but this I have
And cere up my embracements from a next
With bonds of death Remain remain thou here

Putting on the ring

While sense can keep it on And sweetest fairest
As I my poor self did exchange for you
To your so infinite loss so in our trifles
I still win of you for my sake wear this
It is a manacle of love Ill place it
Upon this fairest prisoner

Putting a bracelet upon her arm

IMOGEN
O the gods
When shall we see again

Enter CYMBELINE and LORDS

POSTHUMUS
Alack the King

CYMBELINE
Thou basest thing avoid Hence from my sight
If after this command thou fraught the court
With thy unworthiness thou diest Away
Thourt poison to my blood

POSTHUMUS
The gods protect you
And bless the good remainders of the court
I am gone

Exit

IMOGEN
There cannot be a pinch in death
More sharp than this is

CYMBELINE
O disloyal thing
That shouldst repair my youth thou heapst
A years age on me

IMOGEN
I beseech you sir
Harm not yourself with your vexation
I am senseless of your wrath a touch more rare
Subdues all pangs all fears

CYMBELINE
Past grace obedience

IMOGEN
Past hope and in despair that way past grace

CYMBELINE
That mightst have had the sole son of my queen

IMOGEN
O blest that I might not I chose an eagle
And did avoid a puttock

CYMBELINE
Thou tookst a beggar wouldst have made my throne
A seat for baseness

IMOGEN
No I rather added
A lustre to it

CYMBELINE
O thou vile one

IMOGEN
Sir It is your fault that I have lovd Posthumus
You bred him as my playfellow and he is
A man worth any woman overbuys me
Almost the sum he pays

CYMBELINE
What art thou mad

IMOGEN
Almost sir heaven restore me Would I were
A neatherds daughter and my Leonatus
Our neighbour shepherds son

Reenter QUEEN

CYMBELINE Thou foolish thing
They were again together you have done
Not after our command Away with her
And pen her up

QUEEN
Beseech your patience Peace
Dear lady daughter peace Sweet sovereign
Leave us to ourselves and make yourself some comfort
Out of your best advice

CYMBELINE
Nay let her languish
A drop of blood a day and being aged
Die of this folly

Exeunt CYMBELINE and LORDS

Enter PISANIO

QUEEN
Fie you must give way
Here is your servant How now sir What news

PISANIO
My lord your son drew on my master

QUEEN

PISANIO

But that my master rather playd than fought
And had no help of anger They were parted
By gentlemen at hand

QUEEN
I am very glad ont

IMOGEN
Your sons my fathers friend he takes his part
To draw upon an exile O brave sir
I would they were in Afric both together
Myself by with a needle that I might prick
The goerback Why came you from your master

PISANIO

To bring him to the haven left these notes
Of what commands I should be subject to
Whent pleasd you to employ me

The same A public place

Enter CLOTEN and two LORDS

FIRST LORD
Sir I would advise you to shift a shirt the violence of action
hath made you reek as a sacrifice Where air comes out air
comes in theres none abroad so wholesome as that you vent

CLOTEN
If my shirt were bloody then to shift it Have I hurt him

SECOND LORD

Aside

No faith not so much as his patience

FIRST LORD
Hurt him His bodys a passable carcass if he be not
hurt it is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt

SECOND LORD

Aside

His steel was in debt it went o the backside the town

CLOTEN
The villain would not stand me

SECOND LORD

Aside

No but he fled forward still toward your face

FIRST LORD
Stand you You have land enough of your own but he
added to your having gave you some ground

SECOND LORD

Aside

As many inches as you have oceans Puppies

CLOTEN
I would they had not come between us

SECOND LORD

Aside

So would I till you had measurd how long a fool you
were upon the ground

CLOTEN
And that she should love this fellow and refuse me

SECOND LORD

Aside

If it be a sin to make a true election she is damnd

FIRST LORD
Sir as I told you always her beauty and her brain go
not together Shes a good sign but I have seen small
reflection
of her wit

SECOND LORD

Aside

She shines not upon fools lest the reflection should hurt her

CLOTEN
Come Ill to my chamber Would there had been some hurt
done

SECOND LORD

Aside

I wish not so unless it had been the fall of an ass which is no
great hurt

CLOTEN
Youll go with us

FIRST LORD
Ill attend your lordship

CLOTEN
Nay come lets go together

SECOND LORD
Well my lord

Exeunt



SCENE III

A room in CYMBELINES palace

Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO

IMOGEN
I would thou grewst unto the shores o the haven
And questiondst every sail If he should write
And I not have it twere a paper lost
As offerd mercy is What was the last
That he spake to thee

PISANIO
It was his queen his queen

IMOGEN
Then wavd his handkerchief

PISANIO
And kissd it madam

IMOGEN
Senseless linen happier therein than I
And that was all

PISANIO
No madam for so long
As he could make me with this eye or ear
Distinguish him from others he did keep
The deck with glove or hat or handkerchief
Still waving as the fits and stirs ofs mind
Could best express how slow his soul saild on
How swift his ship

IMOGEN
Thou shouldst have made him
As little as a crow or less ere left
To aftereye him

PISANIO
Madam so I did

IMOGEN
I would have broke mine eyestrings crackd them but
To look upon him till the diminution
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle
Nay followd him till he had melted from
The smallness of a gnat to air and then
Have turnd mine eye and wept But good Pisanio
When shall we hear from him

PISANIO
Be assured madam
With his next vantage

IMOGEN
I did not take my leave of him but had
Most pretty things to say Ere I could tell him
How I would think on him at certain hours
Such thoughts and such or I could make him swear
The shes of Italy should not betray
Mine interest and his honour or have chargd him
At the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight
To encounter me with orisons for then
I am in heaven for him or ere I could
Give him that parting kiss which I had set
Betwixt two charming words comes in my father
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
Shakes all our buds from growing

Enter a LADY

LADY
The Queen madam
Desires your Highness company

IMOGEN
Those things I bid you do get them dispatchd
I will attend the Queen

PISANIO
Madam I shall

Exeunt



SCENE IV

Rome PHILARIOS house

Enter PHILARIO IACHIMO a FRENCHMAN a DUTCHMAN and a
SPANIARD

IACHIMO
Believe it sir I have seen him in Britain He was then of a
crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath
been allowed the name of but I could then have lookd on him
without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his
endowments had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by
items

PHILARIO
You speak of him when he was less furnishd than now he
is with that which makes him both without and within

FRENCHMAN
I have seen him in France We had very many there could
behold the sun with as firm eyes as he

IACHIMO
This matter of marrying his kings daughter wherein he
must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him I
doubt not a great deal from the matter

FRENCHMAN
And then his banishment

IACHIMO
Ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable
divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it
but to fortify her judgement which else an easy battery might
lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality But how
comes it he is to sojourn with you How creeps acquaintance

PHILARIO
His father and I were soldiers together to whom I have been
often bound for no less than my life

Enter POSTHUMUS

Here comes the Briton Let him be so entertained amongst you as
suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his
qualityI beseech you all be better known to this gentleman
whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine How worthy he
is I will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in
his own hearing

FRENCHMAN
Sir we have known together in Orleans

POSTHUMUS
Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies
which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still

FRENCHMAN
Sir you oerrate my poor kindness I was glad I did atone my
countryman and you It had been pity you should have been put
together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore upon
importance of so slight and trivial a nature

POSTHUMUS
By your pardon sir I was then a young traveller rather shunnd
to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided
by others experiences but upon my mended judgementif I offend
not to say it is mendedmy quarrel was not altogether slight

FRENCHMAN
Faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such
two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or
have fallen both

IACHIMO
Can we with manners ask what was the difference

FRENCHMAN
Safely I think twas a contention in public which may without
contradiction suffer the report It was much like an argument
that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our
countrymistresses this gentleman at that time vouchingand
upon warrant of bloody affirmationhis to be more fair virtuous
wise chaste constant qualified and less attemptable than any
the rarest of our ladies in France

IACHIMO
That lady is not now living or this gentlemans opinion by this
worn out

POSTHUMUS
She holds her virtue still and I my mind

IACHIMO
You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy

POSTHUMUS
Being so far provokd as I was in France I would abate her
nothing though I profess myself her adorer not her friend

IACHIMO
As fair and as gooda kind of handinhand comparisonhad been
something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain If she
went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres
many I have beheld I could not but believe she excelled many
But I have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the
lady

POSTHUMUS
I praisd her as I rated her so do I my stone

IACHIMO
What do you esteem it at

POSTHUMUS
More than the world enjoys

IACHIMO
Either your unparagond mistress is dead or shes outprizd by a
trifle

POSTHUMUS
You are mistaken The one may be sold or given if there were
wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is
not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods

IACHIMO
Which the gods have given you

POSTHUMUS
Which by their graces I will keep

IACHIMO
You may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl
light upon neighbouring ponds Your ring may be stolen too
so your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail
and the other casual A cunning thief or a thatway
accomplishd courtier would hazard the winning both of first
and last

POSTHUMUS
Your Italy contains none so accomplishd a courtier to convince
the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that
you term her frail I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves
notwithstanding I fear not my ring

PHILARIO
Let us leave here gentlemen

POSTHUMUS
Sir with all my heart This worthy signior I thank him makes
no stranger of me we are familiar at first

IACHIMO
With five times so much conversation I should get ground of your
fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had I
admittance and opportunity to friend

POSTHUMUS
No no

IACHIMO
I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring
which in my opinion oervalues it something But I make my
wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and
to bar your offence herein too I durst attempt it against any
lady in the world

POSTHUMUS
You are a great deal abusd in too bold a persuasion and I doubt
not you sustain what youre worthy of by your attempt

IACHIMO
Whats that

POSTHUMUS
A repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve morea
punishment too

PHILARIO
Gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly Let it die
as it was born and I pray you be better acquainted

IACHIMO
Would I had put my estate and my neighbours on the approbation
of what I have spoke

POSTHUMUS
What lady would you choose to assail

IACHIMO
Yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe I will lay you
ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court
where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of
a second conference and I will bring from thence that honour of
hers which you imagine so reservd

POSTHUMUS
I will wage against your gold gold to it My ring I hold dear as
my finger tis part of it

IACHIMO
You are afraid and therein the wiser If you buy ladies flesh
at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting But I
see you have some religion in you that you fear

POSTHUMUS
This is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose I
hope

IACHIMO
I am the master of my speeches and would undergo whats spoken
I swear

POSTHUMUS
Will you I shall but lend my diamond till your return Let
there be covenants drawn betweens My mistress exceeds in
goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking I dare you to
this match heres my ring

PHILARIO
I will have it no lay

IACHIMO
By the gods it is one If I bring you no sufficient testimony
that I have enjoyd the dearest bodily part of your mistress my
ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too If I come
off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your
jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided I have
your commendation for my more free entertainment

POSTHUMUS
I embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us
Only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her
and give me directly to understand you have prevaild I am no

SCENE V

Britain A room in CYMBELINES palace

Enter QUEEN LADIES and CORNELIUS

QUEEN
Whiles yet the dews on ground gather those flowers
Make haste Who has the note of them

FIRST LADY
I madam

QUEEN
Dispatch

Exeunt LADIES

Now master doctor have you brought those drugs

CORNELIUS
Pleaseth your Highness ay Here they are madam

Presenting a small box

But I beseech your Grace without offence
My conscience bids me askwherefore you have
Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds
Which are the movers of a languishing death
But though slow deadly

QUEEN
I wonder doctor
Thou askst me such a question Have I not been
Thy pupil long Hast thou not learnd me how
To make perfumes distil preserve yea so
That our great king himself doth woo me oft
For my confections Having thus far proceeded
Unless thou thinkst me devilishist not meet
That I did amplify my judgement in
Other conclusions I will try the forces
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
We count not worth the hangingbut none human
To try the vigour of them and apply
Allayments to their act and by them gather
Their several virtues and effects

CORNELIUS
Your Highness
Shall from this practice but make hard your heart
Besides the seeing these effects will be
Both noisome and infectious

QUEEN O content thee

Enter PISANIO

Aside

Here comes a flattering rascal upon him
Will I first work Hes for his master
An enemy to my son How now Pisanio
Doctor your service for this time is ended
Take your own way

CORNELIUS

Aside

I do suspect you madam
But you shall do no harm

QUEEN

To PISANIO

Hark thee a word

CORNELIUS

Aside

I do not like her She doth think she has
Strange lingring poisons I do know her spirit
And will not trust one of her malice with
A drug of such damnd nature Those she has
Will stupefy and dull the sense a while
Which first perchance shell prove on cats and dogs
Then afterward up higher but there is
No danger in what show of death it makes
More than the lockingup the spirits a time
To be more fresh reviving She is foold
With a most false effect and I the truer
So to be false with her

QUEEN
No further service doctor
Until I send for thee

CORNELIUS
I humbly take my leave

Exit

QUEEN
Weeps she still sayst thou Dost thou think in time
She will not quench and let instructions enter
Where folly now possesses Do thou work
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son
Ill tell thee on the instant thou art then
As great as is thy mastergreater for
His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
Is at last gasp Return he cannot nor
Continue where he is To shift his being
Is to exchange one misery with another
And every day that comes comes to
A days work in him What shalt thou expect
To be depender on a thing that leans
Who cannot be new built nor has no friends
So much as but to prop him

The QUEEN drops the box PISANIO takes it up

Thou takst up
Thou knowst not what but take it for thy labour
It is a thing I made which hath the King
Five times redeemd from death I do not know
What is more cordial Nay I prithee take it
It is an earnest of a further good
That I mean to thee Tell thy mistress how
The case stands with her dot as from thyself
Think what a chance thou changest on but think
Thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son
Who shall take notice of thee Ill move the King
To any shape of thy preferment such
As thoult desire and then myself I chiefly
That set thee on to this desert am bound
To load thy merit richly Call my women
Think on my words

Exit PISANIO

A sly and constant knave
Not to be shakd the agent for his master
And the remembrancer of her to hold
The handfast to her lord I have given him that
Which if he take shall quite unpeople her
Of liegers for her sweet and which she after
Except she bend her humour shall be assurd
To taste of too

Reenter PISANIO and LADIES

So so well done well done
The violets cowslips and the primroses
Bear to my closet Fare thee well Pisanio
Think on my words

Exeunt QUEEN and LADIES

PISANIO
And shall do
But when to my good lord I prove untrue
Ill choke myself Theres all Ill do for you

Exit



SCENE VI

The same Another room in the palace

Enter IMOGEN

IMOGEN
A father cruel and a stepdame false
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
That hath her husband banishdO that husband

Vexations of it Had I been thiefstolen
As my two brothers happy but most miserable
Is the desire thats glorious Blessed be those
How mean soeer that have their honest wills
Which seasons comfort Who may this be Fie

Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO

PISANIO
Madam a noble gentleman of Rome
Comes from my lord with letters

IACHIMO
Change you madam
The worthy Leonatus is in safety
And greets your Highness dearly

Presents a letter

IMOGEN
Thanks good sir
Youre kindly welcome

IACHIMO

Aside

All of her that is out of door most rich
If she be furnishd with a mind so rare
She is alone the Arabian bird and I
Have lost the wager Boldness be my friend
Arm me audacity from head to foot
Or like the Parthian I shall flying fight
Rather directly fly

IMOGEN

Reads

He is one of the noblest note to whose
kindnesses I am most infinitely tied Reflect upon him
accordingly as you value your trust LEONATUS

So far I read aloud
But even the very middle of my heart
Is warmd by the restand take it thankfully
You are as welcome worthy sir as I
Have words to bid you and shall find it so
In all that I can do

IACHIMO
Thanks fairest lady
What are men mad Hath nature given them eyes
To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
Of sea and land which can distinguish twixt
The fiery orbs above and the twinnd stones
Upon the numberd beach and can we not
Partition make with spectacles so precious
Twixt fair and foul

IMOGEN
What makes your admiration

IACHIMO
It cannot be i the eye for apes and monkeys
Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
Contemn with mows the other nor i the judgement
For idiots in this case of favour would
Be wisely definite nor i the appetite
Sluttery to such neat excellence opposd
Should make desire vomit emptiness
Not so allurd to feed

IMOGEN
What is the matter trow

IACHIMO
The cloyed will
That satiate yet unsatisfid desire that tub
Both filld and runningravening first the lamb
Longs after for the garbage

IMOGEN
What dear sir
Thus raps you Are you well

IACHIMO
Thanks madam well

To PISANIO

Beseech you sir desire
My mans abode where I did leave him
He is strange and peevish

PISANIO
I was going sir
To give him welcome

Exit

IMOGEN
Continues well my lord His health beseech you

IACHIMO
Well madam

IMOGEN
Is he disposd to mirth I hope he is

IACHIMO
Exceeding pleasant none a stranger there
So merry and so gamesome He is calld
The Briton reveller

IMOGEN
When he was here
He did incline to sadness and ofttimes
Not knowing why

IACHIMO
I never saw him sad
There is a Frenchman his companion one
An eminent monsieur that it seems much loves
A Gallian girl at home He furnaces
The thick sighs from him whiles the jolly Briton
Your lord I meanlaughs froms free lungs cries O
Can my sides hold to think that man who knows
By history report or his own proof
What woman is yea what she cannot choose
But must be will his free hours languish for
Assured bondage

IMOGEN
Will my lord say so

IACHIMO
Ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter
It is a recreation to be by
And hear him mock the Frenchman But heavens know
Some men are much to blame

IMOGEN
Not he I hope

IACHIMO
Not he but yet heavens bounty towards him might
Be used more thankfully In himself tis much
In youwhich I account hisbeyond all talents
Whilst I am bound to wonder I am bound
To pity too

IMOGEN
What do you pity sir

IACHIMO
Two creatures heartily

IMOGEN
Am I one sir
You look on me what wreck discern you in me
Deserves your pity

IACHIMO
Lamentable What
To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
I the dungeon by a snuff

IMOGEN
I pray you sir
Deliver with more openness your answers
To my demands Why do you pity me

IACHIMO
That others do
I was about to say enjoy yourBut
It is an office of the gods to venge it
Not mine to speak ont

IMOGEN
You do seem to know
Something of me or what concerns me pray you
Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
Than to be sure they do for certainties
Either are past remedies or timely knowing
The remedy then borndiscover to me
What both you spur and stop

IACHIMO
Had I this cheek
To bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch
Whose every touch would force the feelers soul
To the oath of loyalty this object which
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye
Fixing it only here should I damnd then
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
That mount the Capitol join gripes with hands
Made hard with hourly falsehoodfalsehood as
With labour then lie peeping in an eye
Base and illustrious as the smoky light
Thats fed with stinking tallow it were fit
That all the plagues of hell should at one time
Encounter such revolt

IMOGEN
My lord I fear
Has forgot Britain

IACHIMO
And himself Not I
Inclind to this intelligence pronounce
The beggary of his change but tis your graces
That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
Charms this report out

IMOGEN
Let me hear no more

IACHIMO
O dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart
With pity that doth make me sick A lady
So fair and fastend to an empery
Would make the greatst king doubleto be partnerd
With tomboys hird with that selfexhibition
Which your own coffers yield with diseasd ventures
That play with all infirmities for gold
Which rottenness can lend nature such boild stuff
As well might poison poison Be revengd
Or she that bore you was no queen and you
Recoil from your great stock

IMOGEN
Revengd
How should I be revengd If this be true
As I have such a heart that both mine ears
Must not in haste abuseif it be true
How should I be revengd

IACHIMO
Should he make me
Live like Dianas priest betwixt cold sheets
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps
In your despite upon your purse Revenge it
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure
More noble than that runagate to your bed
And will continue fast to your affection
Still close as sure

IMOGEN
What ho Pisanio

IACHIMO
Let me my service tender on your lips

IMOGEN
Away I do condemn mine ears that have
So long attended thee If thou wert honourable
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not
For such an end thou seekstas base as strange
Thou wrongst a gentleman who is as far
From thy report as thou from honour and
Solicitst here a lady that disdains
Thee and the devil alike What ho Pisanio
The King my father shall be made acquainted
Of thy assault If he shall think it fit
A saucy stranger in his court to mart
As in a Romish stew and to expound
His beastly mind to us he hath a court
He little cares for and a daughter who
He not respects at all What ho Pisanio

IACHIMO
O happy Leonatus I may say
The credit that thy lady hath of thee
Deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness
Her assurd credit Blessed live you long
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
Country calld his and you his mistress only
For the most worthiest fit Give me your pardon
I have spoke this to know if your affiance
Were deeply rooted and shall make your lord
That which he is new oer and he is one
The truest mannerd such a holy witch
That he enchants societies into him
Half all mens hearts are his

IMOGEN
You make amends

IACHIMO
He sits mongst men like a descended god
He hath a kind of honour sets him off
More than a mortal seeming Be not angry
Most mighty princess that I have adventurd
To try your taking of a false report which hath
Honourd with confirmation your great judgement
In the election of a sir so rare
Which you know cannot err The love I bear him
Made me to fan you thus but the gods made you
Unlike all others chaffless Pray your pardon

IMOGEN
Alls well sir Take my power i the court for yours

IACHIMO
My humble thanks I had almost forgot
To entreat your Grace but in a small request
And yet of moment too for it concerns
Your lord myself and other noble friends
Are partners in the business

IMOGEN
Pray what ist

IACHIMO
Some dozen Romans of us and your lord
The best feather of our winghave mingled sums
To buy a present for the Emperor
Which I the factor for the rest have done
In France Tis plate of rare device and jewels
Of rich and exquisite form their values great
And I am something curious being strange
To have them in safe stowage May it please you
To take them in protection

IMOGEN
Willingly
And pawn mine honour for their safety Since
My lord hath interest in them I will keep them
In my bedchamber

IACHIMO
They are in a trunk
Attended by my men I will make bold
To send them to you only for this night
I must aboard tomorrow

IMOGEN
O no no

IACHIMO
Yes I beseech or I shall short my word
By lengthening my return From Gallia
I crossd the seas on purpose and on promise
To see your Grace

IMOGEN
I thank you for your pains
But not away tomorrow

IACHIMO
O I must madam
Therefore I shall beseech you if you please
To greet your lord with writing dot tonight
I have outstood my time which is material
To the tender of our present

IMOGEN
I will write
Send your trunk to me it shall safe be kept
And truly yielded you Youre very welcome

Exeunt

borrowed mine oaths of him and might not spend them at my
pleasure

FIRST LORD
What got he by that You have broke his pate with your bowl

SECOND LORD

standersby to curtail his oaths ha

SECOND LORD

Aside

You are cock and capon too and you crow cock with your comb

CLOTEN

SECOND LORD
It is not fit your lordship should undertake every companion that

Cannot take two from twenty for his heart

Of thy dear husband Then that horrid act
Of the divorce hed make The heavens hold firm
The walls of thy dear honour keep unshakd
That temple thy fair mind that thou mayst stand
To enjoy thy banishd lord and this great land

Exit



SCENE II

IMOGENS bedchamber in CYMBELINES palace

IMOGEN in bed reading a LADY attending

IMOGEN
Whos there My woman Helen

LADY
Please you madam

IMOGEN
What hour is it

LADY
Almost midnight madam

IMOGEN
I have read three hours then Mine eyes are weak
Fold down the leaf where I have left To bed
Take not away the taper leave it burning
And if thou canst awake by four o the clock
I prithee call me Sleep hath seizd me wholly

Exit LADY

To your protection I commend me gods
From fairies and the tempters of the night
Guard me beseech ye

Sleeps IACHIMO comes from the trunk

IACHIMO
The crickets sing and mans oerlabourd sense
Repairs itself by rest Our Tarquin thus
Did softly press the rushes ere he wakend
The chastity he wounded Cytherea
How bravely thou becomst thy bed fresh lily
And whiter than the sheets That I might touch
But kiss one kiss Rubies unparagond
How dearly they dot Tis her breathing that
Perfumes the chamber thus The flame o the taper
Bows toward her and would underpeep her lids
To see the enclosed lights now canopied
Under these windows white and azure lacd
With blue of heavens own tinct But my design
To note the chamber I will write all down
Such and such pictures there the window such
The adornment of her bed the arras figures
Why such and such and the contents o the story
Ah but some natural notes about her body
Above ten thousand meaner moveables
Would testify to enrich mine inventory
O sleep thou ape of death lie dull upon her
And be her sense but as a monument
Thus in a chapel lying Come off come off

Taking off her bracelet

As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard
Tis mine and this will witness outwardly
As strongly as the conscience does within
To the madding of her lord On her left breast
A mole cinquespotted like the crimson drops
I the bottom of a cowslip Heres a voucher
Stronger than ever law could make this secret
Will force him think I have pickd the lock and taen
The treasure of her honour No more To what end
Why should I write this down thats riveted
Screwd to my memory She hath been reading late
The tale of Tereus here the leafs turnd down
Where Philomel gave up I have enough
To the trunk again and shut the spring of it
Swift swift you dragons of the night that dawning
May bare the ravens eye I lodge in fear
Though this a heavenly angel hell is here

Clock strikes

One two three time time

Goes into the trunk



SCENE III

An antechamber adjoining IMOGENS apartments

Enter CLOTEN and LORDS

FIRST LORD
Your lordship is the most patient man in loss the most
coldest that ever turnd up ace

CLOTEN
It would make any man cold to lose

FIRST LORD
But not every man patient after the noble temper of your
lordship
You are most hot and furious when you win

CLOTEN
Winning will put any man into courage If I could get this
foolish
Imogen I should have gold enough Its almost morning ist not

FIRST LORD
Day my lord

CLOTEN
I would this music would come I am advised to give her music o
mornings they say it will penetrate

Enter Musicians

Come on tune If you can penetrate her with your fingering so
well try with tongue too If none will do let her remain but
Ill never give oer First a very excellent goodconceited thing
after a wonderful sweet air with admirable rich words to it and
then let her consider

SONG

Hark hark the lark at heavens gate sings
And Phoebus gins arise
His steeds to water at those springs
On chalicd flowers that lies
And winking Marybuds begin
To ope their golden eyes
With every thing that pretty is
My lady sweet arise
Arise arise

So get you gone If this penetrate I will consider your music
the better if it do not it is a vice in her ears which
horsehairs and calvesguts nor the voice of unpaved eunuch
to boot can never amend

Exeunt Musicians

Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN

Good morrow to your Majesty and to my gracious mother

CYMBELINE
Attend you here the door of our stern daughter

CYMBELINE

She hath not yet forgot him Some more time
Must wear the print of his remembrance ont
And then shes yours

QUEEN
You are most bound to the King
Who lets go by no vantages that may
Prefer you to his daughter Frame yourself
To orderly soliciting and be friended
With aptness of the season make denials
Increase your services so seem as if
You were inspird to do those duties which
You tender to her that you in all obey her
Save when command to your dismission tends
And therein you are senseless

CLOTEN
Senseless Not so

Enter a MESSENGER

MESSENGER
So like you sir ambassadors from Rome
The one is Caius Lucius

CYMBELINE
A worthy fellow
Albeit he comes on angry purpose now
But thats no fault of his We must receive him

Exeunt all but CLOTEN

CLOTEN

Let her lie still and dream By your leave ho

Knocks

I know her women are about her what
If I do line one of their hands Tis gold
Which buys admittance oft it doth yea and makes
Dianas rangers false themselves yield up
Their deer to the stand o the stealer and tis gold
Which makes the true man killd and saves the thief
Nay sometime hangs both thief and true man What
Can it not do and undo I will make
One of her women lawyer to me for
I yet not understand the case myself
By your leave

Knocks

IMOGEN
Good morrow sir You lay out too much pains
For purchasing but trouble The thanks I give

And scarce can spare them

CLOTEN
Still I swear I love you

IMOGEN
If you but said so twere as deep with me
If you swear still your recompense is still
That I regard it not

CLOTEN
This is no answer

IMOGEN
But that you shall not say I yield being silent
I would not speak I pray you spare me Faith
I shall unfold equal discourtesy
To your best kindness One of your great knowing
Should learn being taught forbearance

CLOTEN
To leave you in your madness twere my sin I will not

IMOGEN
Fools are not mad folks

CLOTEN
Do you call me fool

IMOGEN
As I am mad I do
If youll be patient Ill no more be mad
That cures us both I am much sorry sir
You put me to forget a ladys manners
By being so verbal and learn now for all
That I which know my heart do here pronounce
By the very truth of it I care not for you
And am so near the lack of charity
To accuse myself I hate you which I had rather
You felt than maket my boast

CLOTEN
You sin against
Obedience which you owe your father For
The contract you pretend with that base wretch
One bred of alms and fosterd with cold dishes
With scraps o the court it is no contract none
And though it be allowed in meaner parties
Yet who than he more meanto knit their souls
On whom there is no more dependency
But brats and beggaryin selffigurd knot
Yet you are curbd from that enlargement by
The consequence o the crown and must not foil
The precious note of it with a base slave
A hilding for a livery a squires cloth
A pantler not so eminent

IMOGEN
Profane fellow
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
But what thou art besides thou wert too base
To be his groom Thou wert dignified enough
Even to the point of envy if twere made
Comparative for your virtues to be styld
The underhangman of his kingdom and hated
For being preferrd so well

CLOTEN
The southfog rot him

IMOGEN
He never can meet more mischance than come
To be but namd of thee His meanst garment
That ever hath but clippd his body is dearer
In my respect than all the hairs above thee
Were they all made such men How now

Missing the bracelet

Pisanio

Enter PISANIO

CLOTEN

IMOGEN
To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently

CLOTEN

IMOGEN
I am sprited with a fool
Frighted and angred worse Go bid my woman
Search for a jewel that too casually
Hath left mine arm It was thy masters Shrew me
If I would lose it for a revenue
Of any kings in Europe I do think
I sawt this morning confident I am
Last night twas on mine arm I kissd it
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
That I kiss aught but he

PISANIO
Twill not be lost

IMOGEN
I hope so go and search

Exit PISANIO

CLOTEN

SCENE IV

Rome PHILARIOS house

Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO

POSTHUMUS
Fear it not sir I would I were so sure
To win the King as I am bold her honour
Will remain hers

PHILARIO
What means do you make to him

POSTHUMUS
Not any but abide the change of time
Quake in the present winters state and wish
That warmer days would come In these feard hopes
I barely gratify your love they failing
I must die much your debtor

PHILARIO
Your very goodness and your company
Oerpays all I can do By this your king
Hath heard of great Augustus Caius Lucius
Will dos commission throughly and I think
Hell grant the tribute send the arrearages
Or look upon our Romans whose remembrance
Is yet fresh in their grief

POSTHUMUS
I do believe
Statist though I am none nor like to be
That this will prove a war and you shall hear
The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
In our notfearing Britain than have tidings
Of any penny tribute paid Our countrymen
Are men more orderd than when Julius Caesar
Smild at their lack of skill but found their courage
Worthy his frowning at Their discipline
Now wingled with their courages will make known
To their approvers they are people such
That mend upon the world

Enter IACHIMO

PHILARIO
See Iachimo

POSTHUMUS
The swiftest harts have posted you by land
And winds of all the comers kissd your sails
To make your vessel nimble

PHILARIO
Welcome sir

POSTHUMUS
I hope the briefness of your answer made
The speediness of your return

IACHIMO
Your lady
Is one of the fairest that I have lookd upon

POSTHUMUS
And therewithal the best or let her beauty
Look through a casement to allure false hearts
And be false with them

IACHIMO
Here are letters for you

POSTHUMUS
Their tenour good I trust

IACHIMO
Tis very like

PHILARIO
Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
When you were there

IACHIMO
He was expected then
But not approachd

POSTHUMUS
All is well yet
Sparkles this stone as it was wont or ist not
Too dull for your good wearing

IACHIMO
If I have lost it
I should have lost the worth of it in gold
Ill make a journey twice as far to enjoy
A second night of such sweet shortness which
Was mine in Britain for the ring is won

POSTHUMUS
The stones too hard to come by

IACHIMO
Not a whit
Your lady being so easy

POSTHUMUS
Make not sir
Your loss your sport I hope you know that we
Must not continue friends

IACHIMO
Good sir we must
If you keep covenant Had I not brought
The knowledge of your mistress home I grant
We were to question farther but I now
Profess myself the winner of her honour
Together with your ring and not the wronger
Of her or you having proceeded but
By both your wills

POSTHUMUS
If you can maket apparent
That you have tasted her in bed my hand
And ring is yours if not the foul opinion
You had of her pure honour gains or loses
Your sword or mine or masterless leaves both
To who shall find them

IACHIMO
Sir my circumstances
Being so near the truth as I will make them
Must first induce you to believe whose strength
I will confirm with oath which I doubt not
Youll give me leave to spare when you shall find
You need it not

POSTHUMUS
Proceed

IACHIMO
First her bedchamber
Where I confess I slept not but profess
Had that was well worth watchingit was hangd
With tapestry of silk and silver the story
Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman
And Cydnus swelld above the banks or for
The press of boats or pride a piece of work
So bravely done so rich that it did strive
In workmanship and value which I wonderd
Could be so rarely and exactly wrought
Since the true life ont was

POSTHUMUS
This is true
And this you might have heard of here by me
Or by some other

IACHIMO
More particulars
Must justify my knowledge

POSTHUMUS
So they must
Or do your honour injury

IACHIMO
The chimney
Is south the chamber and the chimneypiece
Chaste Dian bathing Never saw I figures
So likely to report themselves The cutter
Was as another Nature dumb outwent her
Motion and breath left out

POSTHUMUS
This is a thing
Which you might from relation likewise reap
Being as it is much spoke of

IACHIMO
The roof o the chamber
With golden cherubins is fretted Her andirons
I had forgot themwere two winking Cupids
Of silver each on one foot standing nicely
Depending on their brands

POSTHUMUS
This is her honour
Let it be granted you have seen all thisand praise
Be given to your remembrancethe description
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
The wager you have laid

IACHIMO
Then if you can

Showing the bracelet

Be pale I beg but leave to air this jewel see
And now tis up again It must be married
To that your diamond Ill keep them

POSTHUMUS
Jove
Once more let me behold it Is it that
Which I left with her

IACHIMO
SirI thank herthat
She strippd it from her arm I see her yet
Her pretty action did outsell her gift
And yet enrichd it too She gave it me and said
She prizd it once

POSTHUMUS
May be she pluckd it off
To send it me

IACHIMO
She writes so to you doth she

POSTHUMUS
O no no no tis true Here take this too

Gives the ring

It is a basilisk unto mine eye
Kills me to look ont Let there be no honour
Where there is beauty truth where semblance love
Where theres another man The vows of women
Of no more bondage be to where they are made
Than they are to their virtues which is nothing
O above measure false

PHILARIO
Have patience sir
And take your ring again tis not yet won
It may be probable she lost it or
Who knows if one her women being corrupted
Hath stolen it from her

POSTHUMUS
Very true
And so I hope he came byt Back my ring
Render to me some corporal sign about her
More evident than this for this was stolen

IACHIMO
By Jupiter I had it from her arm

POSTHUMUS
Hark you he swears by Jupiter he swears
Tis truenay keep the ringtis true I am sure
She would not lose it Her attendants are
All sworn and honourable They induced to steal it
And by a stranger No he hath enjoyd her
The cognizance of her incontinency
Is this She hath bought the name of whore thus dearly
There take thy hire and all the fiends of hell
Divide themselves between you

PHILARIO
Sir be patient
This is not strong enough to be believd
Of one persuaded well of

POSTHUMUS
Never talk ont
She hath been colted by him

IACHIMO
If you seek
For further satisfying under her breast
Worthy the pressinglies a mole right proud
Of that most delicate lodging By my life
I kissd it and it gave me present hunger
To feed again though full You do remember
This stain upon her

POSTHUMUS
Ay and it doth confirm
Another stain as big as hell can hold
Were there no more but it

IACHIMO
Will you hear more

POSTHUMUS
Spare your arithmetic never count the turns
Once and a million

IACHIMO
Ill be sworn

POSTHUMUS
No swearing
If you will swear you have not donet you lie
And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
Thoust made me cuckold

IACHIMO
Ill deny nothing

POSTHUMUS
O that I had her here to tear her limbmeal
I will go there and dot i the court before
Her father Ill do something

Exit

PHILARIO
Quite besides
The government of patience You have won
Lets follow him and pervert the present wrath
He hath against himself

IACHIMO
With all my heart

Exeunt



SCENE V

Another room in PHILARIOS house

Enter POSTHUMUS

POSTHUMUS
Is there no way for men to be but women
Must be halfworkers We are all bastards
And that most venerable man which I
Did call my father was I know not where
When I was stampd Some coiner with his tools
Made me a counterfeit yet my mother seemd
The Dian of that time So doth my wife
The nonpareil of this O vengeance vengeance
Me of my lawful pleasure she restraind
And prayd me oft forbearance did it with
A pudency so rosy the sweet view ont
Might well have warmd old Saturn that I thought her
As chaste as unsunnd snow O all the devils
This yellow Iachimo in an hourwast not
Or lessat firstperchance he spoke not but
Like a fullacornd boar a German one
Cried O and mounted found no opposition
But what he lookd for should oppose and she
Should from encounter guard Could I find out
The womans part in me For theres no motion
That tends to vice in man but I affirm
It is the womans part be it lying note it
The womans flattering hers deceiving hers
Lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers
Ambitions covetings change of prides disdain
Nice longing slanders mutability
All faults that may be namd nay that hell knows
Why hers in part or all but rather all
For even to vice
They are not constant but are changing still
One vice but of a minute old for one
Not half so old as that Ill write against them
Detest them curse them yet tis greater skill
In a true hate to pray they have their will
The very devils cannot plague them better

Exit




ACT FIFTH SCENE I

Britain The Roman camp

Enter POSTHUMUS with a bloody handkerchief

POSTHUMUS
Yea bloody cloth Ill keep thee for I wishd
Thou shouldst be colourd thus You married ones
If each of you should take this course how many
Must murder wives much better than themselves
For wrying but a little O Pisanio
Every good servant does not all commands
No bond but to do just ones Gods if you
Should have taen vengeance on my faults I never
Had livd to put on this so had you saved
The noble Imogen to repent and struck
Me wretch more worth your vengeance But alack
You snatch some hence for little faults thats love
To have them fall no more you some permit
To second ills with ills each elder worse
And make them dread it to the doers thrift
But Imogen is your own do your best wills
And make me blest to obey I am brought hither
Among the Italian gentry and to fight
Against my ladys kingdom Tis enough
That Britain I have killd thy mistress peace
Ill give no wound to thee Therefore good heavens
Hear patiently my purpose Ill disrobe me
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
As does a Briton peasant so Ill fight
Against the part I come with so Ill die
For thee O Imogen even for whom my life
Is every breath a death and thus unknown
Pitied nor hated to the face of peril
Myself Ill dedicate Let me make men know
More valour in me than my habits show
Gods put the strength o the Leonati in me
To shame the guise o the world I will begin
The fashion less without and more within

Exit



SCENE II

Field of battle between the British and Roman camps

Enter LUCIUS IACHIMO and the Roman Army at one door
and the Briton army at another LEONATUS POSTHUMUS
following like a poor soldier They march over and go out
Alarums Then enter again in skirmish IACHIMO and
POSTHUMUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO
and then leaves him

IACHIMO
The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
Takes off my manhood I have belied a lady
The Princess of this country and the air ont
Revengingly enfeebles me or could this carl
A very drudge of natures have subdud me
In my profession Knighthoods and honours borne
As I wear mine are titles but of scorn
If that thy gentry Britain go before
This lout as he exceeds our lords the odds
Is that we scarce are men and you are gods

Exit

The battle continues the BRITONS fly CYMBELINE is taken
then enter to his rescue BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS

BELARIUS
Stand stand We have the advantage of the ground
The lane is guarded Nothing routs us but
The villainy of our fears

GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
Stand stand and fight

Reenter POSTHUMUS and seconds the Britons They rescue
CYMBELINE and exeunt Then reenter LUCIUS IACHIMO
and IMOGEN

LUCIUS
Away boy from the troops and save thyself
For friends kill friends and the disorders such
As war were hoodwinkd

IACHIMO
Tis their fresh supplies

LUCIUS
It is a day turnd strangely Or betimes
Lets reinforce or fly

Exeunt



SCENE III

Another part of the field

Enter POSTHUMUS and a Briton LORD

LORD
Camst thou from where they made the stand

POSTHUMUS
I did
Though you it seems come from the fliers

LORD
I did

POSTHUMUS
No blame be to you sir for all was lost
But that the heavens fought the King himself
Of his wings destitute the army broken
And but the backs of Britons seen all flying
Through a strait lane the enemy fullhearted
Lolling the tongue with slaughtring having work
More plentiful than tools to dot struck down
Some mortally some slightly touchd some falling
Merely through fear that the straight pass was dammd
With dead men hurt behind and cowards living
To die with lengthned shame

LORD
Where was this lane

POSTHUMUS
Close by the battle ditchd and walld with turf
Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier
An honest one I warrant who deservd
So long a breeding as his white beard came to
In doing this fors country Athwart the lane
He with two striplingslads more like to run
The country base than to commit such slaughter
With faces fit for masks or rather fairer
Than those for preservation casd or shame
Made good the passage cried to those that fled
Our Britains harts die flying not our men
To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards Stand
Or we are Romans and will give you that
Like beasts which you shun beastly and may save
But to look back in frown Stand stand These three
Three thousand confident in act as many
For three performers are the file when all
The rest do nothingwith this word Stand stand
Accommodated by the place more charming
With their own nobleness which could have turnd
A distaff to a lance gilded pale looks
Part shame part spirit renewd that some turnd coward
But by exampleO a sin in war
Damnd in the first beginnersgan to look
The way that they did and to grin like lions
Upon the pikes o the hunters Then began
A stop i the chaser a retire anon
A rout confusion thick Forthwith they fly
Chickens the way which they stoopd eagles slaves
The strides they victors made and now our cowards
Like fragments in hard voyages became
The life o the need Having found the backdoor open
Of the unguarded hearts heavens how they wound
Some slain before some dying some their friends
Oerborne i the former wave ten chasd by one
Are now each one the slaughterman of twenty
Those that would die or ere resist are grown
The mortal bugs o the field

LORD
This was strange chance
A narrow lane an old man and two boys

POSTHUMUS
Nay do not wonder at it you are made
Rather to wonder at the things you hear
Than to work any Will you rhyme upont
And vent it for a mockery Here is one
Two boys an old man twice a boy a lane
Preservd the Britons was the Romans bane

LORD
Nay be not angry sir

POSTHUMUS
Lack to what end
Who dares not stand his foe Ill be his friend
For if hell do as he is made to do
I know hell quickly fly my friendship too
You have put me into rhyme

LORD
Farewell youre angry

Exit

POSTHUMUS
Still going This is a lord O noble misery
To be i the field and ask what news of me
Today how many would have given their honours
To have savd their carcasses took heel to dot
And yet died too I in mine own woe charmd
Could not find Death where I did hear him groan
Nor feel him where he struck Being an ugly monster
Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups soft beds
Sweet words or hath moe ministers than we
That draw his knives i the war Well I will find him
For being now a favourer to the Briton
No more a Briton I have resumd again
The part I came in Fight I will no more
But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
Once touch my shoulder Great the slaughter is
Here made by the Roman great the answer be
Britons must take For me my ransoms death
On either side I come to spend my breath
Which neither here Ill keep nor bear again
But end it by some means for Imogen

Enter two BRITISH CAPTAINS and soldiers

FIRST CAPTAIN
Great Jupiter be praisd Lucius is taken
Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels

SECOND CAPTAIN
There was a fourth man in a silly habit
That gave the affront with them

FIRST CAPTAIN
So tis reported
But none of em can be found Stand whos there

POSTHUMUS
A Roman
Who had not now been drooping here if seconds
Had answerd him

SECOND CAPTAIN
Lay hands on him a dog
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
What crows have peckd them here He brags his service
As if he were of note Bring him to the King

Enter CYMBELINE BELARIUS GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS
PISANIO SOLDIERS ATTENDANTS and Roman captives

delivers him over to a Gaoler Then exeunt omnes



SCENE IV

A British prison

Enter POSTHUMUS and two GAOLERS

FIRST GAOLER
You shall not now be stolen you have locks upon you
So graze as you find pasture

SECOND GAOLER
Ay or a stomach

Exeunt GAOLERS

POSTHUMUS
Most welcome bondage for thou art a way
I think to liberty yet am I better
Than one thats sick o the gout since he had rather
Groan so in perpetuity than be curd
By the sure physician Death who is the key
To unbar these locks My conscience thou art fetterd
More than my shanks and wrists You good gods give me
The penitent instrument to pick that bolt
Then free for ever Ist enough I am sorry
So children temporal fathers do appease
Gods are more full of mercy Must I repent
I cannot do it better than in gyves
Desird more than constraind to satisfy
If of my freedom tis the main part take
No stricter render of me than my all
I know you are more clement than vile men
Who of their broken debtors take a third
A sixth a tenth letting them thrive again
On their abatement Thats not my desire
For Imogens dear life take mine and though
Tis not so dear yet tis a life you coind it
Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp
Though light take pieces for the figures sake
You rather mine being yours and so great powers
If you will take this audit take this life
And cancel these cold bonds O Imogen
Ill speak to thee in silence

Sleeps

Solemn music Enter as in an apparition SICILIUS
LEONATUS father to POSTHUMUS an old man attired
like a warrior leading in his hand an ancient matron his wife
and mother to POSTHUMUS with music before them Then
after other music follow the two young LEONATI brothers
to POSTHUMUS with wounds as they died in the wars They
circle POSTHUMUS round as he lies sleeping

SICILIUS
No more thou thundermaster show
Thy spite on mortal flies
With Mars fall out with Juno chide
That thy adulteries
Rates and revenges
Hath my poor boy done aught but well
Whose face I never saw
I died whilst in the womb he stayd
Attending Natures law
Whose father then as men report
Thou orphans father art
Thou shouldst have been and shielded him
From this earthvexing smart

MOTHER
Lucina lent not me her aid
But took me in my throes
That from me was Posthumus ript
Came crying mongst his foes
A thing of pity

SICILIUS
Great Nature like his ancestry
Moulded the stuff so fair
That he deservd the praise o the world
As great Sicilius heir

FIRST BROTHER
When once he was mature for man
In Britain where was he
That could stand up his parallel
Or fruitful object be
In eye of Imogen that best
Could deem his dignity

MOTHER
With marriage wherefore was he mockd
To be exild and thrown
From Leonati seat and cast
From her his dearest one
Sweet Imogen

SICILIUS
Why did you suffer Iachimo
Slight thing of Italy
To taint his nobler heart and brain
With needless jealousy
And to become the geck and scorn
O the others villainy

SECOND BROTHER
For this from stiller seats we came
Our parents and us twain
That striking in our countrys cause
Fell bravely and were slain
Our fealty and Tenantius right
With honour to maintain

FIRST BROTHER
Like hardiment Posthumus hath
To Cymbeline performd
Then Jupiter thou king of gods
Why hast thou thus adjournd
The graces for his merits due
Being all to dolours turnd

SICILIUS
Thy crystal window ope look out
No longer exercise
Upon a valiant race thy harsh
And potent injuries

MOTHER
Since Jupiter our son is good
Take off his miseries

SICILIUS
Peep through thy marble mansion help
Or we poor ghosts will cry
To the shining synod of the rest
Against thy deity

BOTH BROTHERS
Help Jupiter or we appeal
And from thy justice fly

JUPITER descends in thunder and lightning sitting
upon an eagle he throws a thunderbolt The GHOSTS
fall on their knees

JUPITER
No more you petty spirits of region low
Offend our hearing hush How dare you ghosts
Accuse the thunderer whose bolt you know
Skyplanted batters all rebelling coasts
Poor shadows of Elysium hence and rest
Upon your neverwithering banks of flowers
Be not with mortal accidents opprest
No care of yours it is you know tis ours
Whom best I love I cross to make my gift
The more delayd delighted Be content
Your lowlaid son our godhead will uplift
His comforts thrive his trials well are spent
Our jovial star reignd at his birth and in
Our temple was he married Rise and fade
He shall be lord of Lady Imogen
And happier much by his affliction made
This tablet lay upon his breast wherein
Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine
And so away No farther with your din
Express impatience lest you stir up mine
Mount eagle to my palace crystalline

Ascends

SICILIUS
He came in thunder his celestial breath
Was sulphurous to smell The holy eagle
Stoopd as to foot us His ascension is
More sweet than our blest fields His royal bird
Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak
As when his god is pleasd

ALL
Thanks Jupiter

SICILIUS
The marble pavement closes he is enterd
His radiant roof Away and to be blest
Let us with care perform his great behest

The GHOSTS vanish

POSTHUMUS

Waking

Sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot
A father to me and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers but O scorn
Gone they went hence so soon as they were born
And so I am awake Poor wretches that depend
On greatness favour dream as I have done
Wake and find nothing But alas I swerve
Many dream not to find neither deserve
And yet are steepd in favours so am I
That have this golden chance and know not why
What fairies haunt this ground A book O rare one
Be not as is our fangled world a garment
Nobler than that it covers Let thy effects
So follow to be most unlike our courtiers
As good as promise

Reads

Whenas a lions whelp shall to himself unknown without
seeking find and be embraced by a piece of tender air and
when from a stately cedar shall be loppd branches which
being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the old
stock and freshly grow then shall Posthumus end his miseries
Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty

Tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen
Tongue and brain not either both or nothing
Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
As sense cannot untie Be what it is
The action of my life is like it which
Ill keep if but for sympathy

Reenter GAOLER

GAOLER
Come sir are you ready for death

POSTHUMUS
Overroasted rather ready long ago

GAOLER
Hanging is the word sir If you be ready for that you are
well cookd

POSTHUMUS
So if I prove a good repast to the spectators the dish
pays the shot

GAOLER
A heavy reckoning for you sir But the comfort is you shall
be called to no more payments fear no more tavernbills
which are often the sadness of parting as the procuring of
mirth You come in faint for want of meat depart reeling with
too much drink sorry that you have paid too much and sorry that
you are paid too much purse and brain both empty the brain the
heavier for being too light the purse too light being drawn of
heaviness O of this contradiction you shall now be quit O the
charity of a penny cord It sums up thousands in a trice You
have no true debitor and creditor but it of whats past is and
to come the discharge Your neck sir is pen book and counters
so the acquittance follows

POSTHUMUS
I am merrier to die than thou art to live

GAOLER
Indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the toothache but a man
that were to sleep your sleep and a hangman to help him to bed I
think he would change places with his officer for look you sir
you know not which way you shall go

POSTHUMUS
Yes indeed do I fellow

GAOLER
Your Death has eyes ins head then I have not seen him so
picturd You must either be directed by some that take upon them
to know or to take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not
know or jump the after inquiry on your own peril And how you
shall speed in your journeys end I think youll never return to
tell one

POSTHUMUS
I tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to direct them the
way I am going but such as wink and will not use them

GAOLER
What an infinite mock is this that a man should have the best
use of eyes to see the way of blindness I am sure hangings the
way of winking

Enter a MESSENGER

MESSENGER
Knock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the King

POSTHUMUS
Thou bringst good news I am calld to be made free

GAOLER
Ill be hangd then

POSTHUMUS
Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler no bolts for the dead

Exeunt all but the GAOLER

GAOLER
Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets I
never saw one so prone Yet on my conscience there are verier
knaves desire to live for all he be a Roman and there be some
of them too that die against their wills So should I if I were
one I would we were all of one mind and one mind good O there
were desolation of gaolers and gallowses I speak against my
present profit but my wish hath a preferment int

Exit



SCENE V

CYMBELINES tent

Enter CYMBELINE BELARIUS GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS PISANIO
LORDS OFFICERS and Attendants

CYMBELINE
Stand by my side you whom the gods have made
Preservers of my throne Woe is my heart
That the poor soldier that so richly fought
Whose rags shamd gilded arms whose naked breast
Steppd before targes of proof cannot be found
He shall be happy that can find him if
Our grace can make him so

BELARIUS
I never saw
Such noble fury in so poor a thing
Such precious deeds in one that promisd nought
But beggary and poor looks

CYMBELINE
No tidings of him

PISANIO
He hath been searchd among the dead and living
But no trace of him

CYMBELINE
To my grief I am
The heir of his reward

To BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS

which I will add
To you the liver heart and brain of Britain
By whom I grant she lives Tis now the time
To ask of whence you are Report it

BELARIUS
Sir
In Cambria are we born and gentlemen
Further to boast were neither true nor modest
Unless I add we are honest

CYMBELINE
Bow your knees
Arise my knights o the battle I create you
Companions to our person and will fit you
With dignities becoming your estates

Enter CORNELIUS and LADIES

Theres business in these faces Why so sadly
Greet you our victory You look like Romans
And not o the court of Britain

CORNELIUS
Hail great King
To sour your happiness I must report
The Queen is dead

CYMBELINE
Who worse than a physician
Would this report become But I consider
By medicine life may be prolongd yet death
Will seize the doctor too How ended she

CORNELIUS
With horror madly dying like her life
Which being cruel to the world concluded
Most cruel to herself What she confessd
I will report so please you These her women
Can trip me if I err who with wet cheeks
Were present when she finishd

CYMBELINE
Prithee say

CORNELIUS
First she confessd she never lovd you only
Affected greatness got by you not you
Married your royalty was wife to your place
Abhorrd your person

CYMBELINE
She alone knew this
And but she spoke it dying I would not
Believe her lips in opening it Proceed

CORNELIUS
Your daughter whom she bore in hand to love
With such integrity she did confess
Was as a scorpion to her sight whose life
But that her flight prevented it she had
Taen off by poison

CYMBELINE
O most delicate fiend
Who ist can read a woman Is there more

CORNELIUS
More sir and worse She did confess she had
For you a mortal mineral which being took
Should by the minute feed on life and lingring
By inches waste you in which time she purposd
By watching weeping tendance kissing to
Oercome you with her show and in time
When she had fitted you with her craft to work
Her son into the adoption of the crown
But failing of her end by his strange absence
Grew shamelessdesperate opend in despite
Of heaven and men her purposes repented
The evils she hatchd were not effected so
Despairing died

CYMBELINE
Heard you all this her women

LADY
We did so please your Highness

CYMBELINE
Mine eyes
Were not in fault for she was beautiful
Mine ears that heard her flattery nor my heart
That thought her like her seeming It had been vicious
To have mistrusted her yet O my daughter
That it was folly in me thou mayst say
And prove it in thy feeling Heaven mend all

Enter LUCIUS IACHIMO the SOOTHSAYER and other
Roman prisoners guarded POSTHUMUS behind and IMOGEN

Thou comst not Caius now for tribute that
The Britons have razd out though with the loss
Of many a bold one whose kinsmen have made suit
That their good souls may be appeasd with slaughter
Of you their captives which ourself have granted
So think of your estate

LUCIUS
Consider sir the chance of war The day
Was yours by accident Had it gone with us
We should not when the blood was cool have threatend
Our prisoners with the sword But since the gods
Will have it thus that nothing but our lives
May be calld ransom let it come Sufficeth
A Roman with a Romans heart can suffer
Augustus lives to think ont and so much
For my peculiar care This one thing only
I will entreat my boy a Briton born
Let him be ransomd Never master had
A page so kind so duteous diligent
So tender over his occasions true
So feat so nurselike Let his virtue join
With my request which Ill make bold your Highness
Cannot deny He hath done no Briton harm
Though he have servd a Roman Save him sir
And spare no blood beside

CYMBELINE
I have surely seen him
His favour is familiar to me Boy
Thou hast lookd thyself into my grace
And art mine own I know not why wherefore
To say Live boy Neer thank thy master live
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt
Fitting my bounty and thy state Ill give it
Yea though thou do demand a prisoner
The noblest taen

IMOGEN
I humbly thank your Highness

LUCIUS
I do not bid thee beg my life good lad
And yet I know thou wilt

IMOGEN
No no alack
Theres other work in hand I see a thing
Bitter to me as death your life good master
Must shuffle for itself

LUCIUS
The boy disdains me
He leaves me scorns me Briefly die their joys
That place them on the truth of girls and boys
Why stands he so perplexd

CYMBELINE
What wouldst thou boy
I love thee more and more think more and more
Whats best to ask Knowst him thou lookst on Speak
Wilt have him live Is he thy kin thy friend

IMOGEN
He is a Roman no more kin to me
Than I to your Highness who being born your vassal
Am something nearer

CYMBELINE
Wherefore eyst him so

IMOGEN
Ill tell you sir in private if you please
To give me hearing

CYMBELINE

GUIDERIUS

To good or bad

CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward

CYMBELINE
Come stand thou by our side
Make thy demand aloud

Give answer to this boy and do it freely
Or by our greatness and the grace of it
Which is our honour bitter torture shall
Winnow the truth from falsehood On speak to him

IMOGEN
My boon is that this gentleman may render
Of whom he had this ring

POSTHUMUS

IACHIMO

Which to be spoke would torture thee

CYMBELINE

IACHIMO
I am glad to be constraind to utter that
Which torments me to conceal By villainy
I got this ring Twas Leonatus jewel
Whom thou didst banish andwhich more may grieve thee
As it doth mea nobler sir neer livd
Twixt sky and ground Wilt thou hear more my lord

CYMBELINE
All that belongs to this

IACHIMO
That paragon thy daughter
For whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits
Quail to rememberGive me leave I faint

CYMBELINE
My daughter What of her Renew thy strength
I had rather thou shouldst live while Nature will
Than die ere I hear more Strive man and speak

IACHIMO
Upon a timeunhappy was the clock
That struck the hourit was in Romeaccursd
The mansion wheretwas at a feastO would
Our viands had been poisond or at least
Those which I heavd to headthe good Posthumus
What should I say He was too good to be
Where ill men were and was the best of all
Amongst the rarst of good onessitting sadly
Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
For beauty that made barren the swelld boast
Of him that best could speak for feature laming
The shrine of Venus or straightpight Minerva
Postures beyond brief nature for condition
A shop of all the qualities that man
Loves woman for besides that hook of wiving
Fairness which strikes the eye

CYMBELINE
I stand on fire
Come to the matter

IACHIMO
All too soon I shall
Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly This Posthumus
Most like a noble lord in love and one
That had a royal lover took his hint
And not dispraising whom we praisdtherein
He was as calm as virtuehe began
His mistress picture which by his tongue being made
And then a mind put int either our brags
Were crackd of kitchen trulls or his description
Provd us unspeaking sots

CYMBELINE
Nay nay to th purpose

IACHIMO
Your daughters chastitythere it begins
He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams
And she alone were cold whereat I wretch
Made scruple of his praise and wagerd with him
Pieces of gold gainst this which then he wore
Upon his honourd finger to attain
In suit the place ofs bed and win this ring
By hers and mine adultery He true knight
No lesser of her honour confident
Than I did truly find her stakes this ring
And would so had it been a carbuncle
Of Phoebus wheel and might so safely had it
Been all the worth ofs car Away to Britain
Post I in this design Well may you sir
Remember me at court where I was taught
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
Twixt amorous and villainous Being thus quenchd
Of hope not longing mine Italian brain
Gan in your duller Britain operate
Most vilely for my vantage excellent
And to be brief my practice so prevaild
That I returnd with similar proof enough
To make the noble Leonatus mad
By wounding his belief in her renown
With tokens thus and thus averring notes
Of chamberhanging pictures this her bracelet
O cunning how I got itnay some marks
Of secret on her person that he could not
But think her bond of chastity quite crackd
I having taen the forfeit Whereupon
Methinks I see him now

POSTHUMUS

Advancing

Ay so thou dost
Italian fiend Ay me most credulous fool
Egregious murderer thief anything
Thats due to all the villains past in being
To come O give me cord or knife or poison
Some upright justicer Thou King send out
For torturers ingenious it is I
That all the abhorred things o the earth amend
By being worse than they I am Posthumus
That killd thy daughtervillainlike I lie
That caused a lesser villain than myself
A sacrilegious thief to dot The temple
Of Virtue was she yea and she herself
Spit and throw stones cast mire upon me set
The dogs o the street to bay me every villain
Be calld Posthumus Leonatus and
Be villainy less than twas O Imogen
My queen my life my wife O Imogen

IMOGEN

POSTHUMUS
Shalls have a play of this Thou scornful page
There lies thy part

Striking her she falls

PISANIO

Mine honourd lady

CYMBELINE
Does the world go round

POSTHUMUS
How comes these staggers on me

PISANIO
Wake my mistress

CYMBELINE
If this be so the gods do mean to strike me
To death with mortal joy

PISANIO
How fares my mistress

IMOGEN
O get thee from my sight
Thou gavst me poison Dangerous fellow hence
Breathe not where princes are

CYMBELINE
The tune of Imogen

PISANIO
Lady
The gods throw stones of sulphur on me if
That box I gave you was not thought by me
A precious thing I had it from the Queen

CYMBELINE
New matter still

IMOGEN
It poisond me

CORNELIUS
O gods
I left out one thing which the Queen confessd
Which must approve thee honest If Pisanio
Have said she given his mistress that confection
Which I gave him for cordial she is servd
As I would serve a rat

CYMBELINE
Whats this Cornelius

CORNELIUS
The Queen sir very oft importund me
To temper poisons for her still pretending
The satisfaction of her knowledge only
In killing creatures vile as cats and dogs
Of no esteem I dreading that her purpose
Was of more danger did compound for her
A certain stuff which being taen would cease
The present power of life but in short time
All offices of nature should again
Do their due functions Have you taen of it

IMOGEN
Most like I did for I was dead

BELARIUS
My boys
There was our error

GUIDERIUS
This is sure Fidele

IMOGEN
Why did you throw your wedded lady from you
Think that you are upon a rock and now
Throw me again

Embracing him

POSTHUMUS
Hang there like fruit my soul
Till the tree die

CYMBELINE
How now my flesh my child
What makst thou me a dullard in this act
Wilt thou not speak to me

IMOGEN

Kneeling

Your blessing sir

BELARIUS

To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS

Though you did love this youth I blame ye not
You had a motive fort

CYMBELINE
My tears that fall
Prove holy water on thee Imogen
Thy mothers dead

IMOGEN
I am sorry fort my lord

CYMBELINE
O she was naught and long of her it was
That we meet here so strangely but her son
Is gone we know not how nor where

PISANIO
My lord
Now fear is from me Ill speak troth Lord Cloten
Upon my ladys missing came to me
With his sword drawn foamd at the mouth and swore
If I discoverd not which way she was gone
It was my instant death By accident
I had a feigned letter of my masters
Then in my pocket which directed him
To seek her on the mountains near to Milford
Where in a frenzy in my masters garments
Which he enforcd from me away he posts
With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
My ladys honour What became of him
I further know not

GUIDERIUS
Let me end the story
I slew him there

CYMBELINE
Marry the gods forfend
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
Pluck a hard sentence Prithee valiant youth
Denyt again

GUIDERIUS
I have spoke it and I did it

CYMBELINE
He was a prince

GUIDERIUS
A most incivil one The wrongs he did me
Were nothing princelike for he did provoke me
With language that would make me spurn the sea
If it could so roar to me I cut offs head
And am right glad he is not standing here
To tell this tale of mine

CYMBELINE
I am sorry for thee
By thine own tongue thou art condemnd and must
Endure our law Thourt dead

IMOGEN
That headless man
I thought had been my lord

CYMBELINE
Bind the offender
And take him from our presence

BELARIUS
Stay sir King
This man is better than the man he slew
As well descended as thyself and hath
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
Had ever scar for

To the Guard

Let his arms alone
They were not born for bondage

CYMBELINE
Why old soldier
Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
By tasting of our wrath How of descent
As good as we

ARVIRAGUS
In that he spake too far

CYMBELINE
And thou shalt die fort

BELARIUS
We will die all three
But I will prove that two ons are as good
As I have given out him My sons I must
For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech
Though haply well for you

ARVIRAGUS
Your dangers ours

GUIDERIUS
And our good his

BELARIUS
Have at it then by leave
Thou hadst great King a subject who
Was calld Belarius

CYMBELINE
What of him He is
A banishd traitor

BELARIUS
He it is that hath
Assumd this age indeed a banishd man
I know not how a traitor

CYMBELINE
Take him hence
The whole world shall not save him

BELARIUS
Not too hot
First pay me for the nursing of thy sons
And let it be confiscate all so soon
As I have receivd it

CYMBELINE
Nursing of my sons

BELARIUS
I am too blunt and saucy heres my knee
Ere I arise I will prefer my sons
Then spare not the old father Mighty sir
These two young gentlemen that call me father
And think they are my sons are none of mine
They are the issue of your loins my liege
And blood of your begetting

CYMBELINE
How my issue

BELARIUS
So sure as you your fathers I old Morgan
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banishd
Your pleasure was my mere offence my punishment
Itself and all my treason that I sufferd
Was all the harm I did These gentle princes
For such and so they arethese twenty years
Have I traind up Those arts they have as
Could put into them my breeding was sir as
Your Highness knows Their nurse Euriphile
Whom for the theft I wedded stole these children
Upon my banishment I movd her tot
Having receivd the punishment before
For that which I did then Beaten for loyalty
Excited me to treason Their dear loss
The more of you twas felt the more it shapd
Unto my end of stealing them But gracious sir
Here are your sons again and I must lose
Two of the sweetst companions in the world
The benediction of these covering heavens
Fall on their heads like dew for they are worthy
To inlay heaven with stars

CYMBELINE
Thou weepst and speakst
The service that you three have done is more
Unlike than this thou tellst I lost my children
If these be they I know not how to wish
A pair of worthier sons

BELARIUS
Be pleasd awhile
This gentleman whom I call Polydore
Most worthy prince as yours is true Guiderius
This gentleman my Cadwal Arviragus
Your younger princely son He sir was lappd
In a most curious mantle wrought by the hand
Of his queen mother which for more probation
I can with ease produce

CYMBELINE
Guiderius had
Upon his neck a mole a sanguine star
It was a mark of wonder

BELARIUS
This is he
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp
It was wise Natures end in the donation
To be his evidence now

CYMBELINE
O what am I
A mother to the birth of three Neer mother
Rejoicd deliverance more Blest pray you be
That after this strange starting from your orbs
You may reign in them now O Imogen
Thou hast lost by this a kingdom

IMOGEN
No my lord
I have got two worlds by t O my gentle brothers
Have we thus met O never say hereafter
But I am truest speaker You calld me brother
When I was but your sister I you brothers
When ye were so indeed

CYMBELINE
Did you eer meet

ARVIRAGUS
Ay my good lord

GUIDERIUS
And at first meeting lovd
Continud so until we thought he died

CORNELIUS
By the Queens dram she swallowd

CYMBELINE
O rare instinct
When shall I hear all through This fierce abridgment
Hath to it circumstantial branches which
Distinction should be rich in Where how livd you
And when came you to serve our Roman captive
How parted with your brothers How first met them
Why fled you from the court and whither These
And your three motives to the battle with
I know not how much more should be demanded
And all the other bydependencies
From chance to chance but nor the time nor place
Will serve our long intergatories See
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen
And she like harmless lightning throws her eye
On him her brothers me her master hitting
Each object with a joy the counterchange
Is severally in all Lets quit this ground
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices

To BELARIUS

Thou art my brother so well hold thee ever

IMOGEN
You are my father too and did relieve me
To see this gracious season

CYMBELINE
All oerjoyd
Save these in bonds Let them be joyful too
For they shall taste our comfort

IMOGEN
My good master
I will yet do you service

LUCIUS
Happy be you

CYMBELINE
The forlorn soldier that so nobly fought
He would have well becomd this place and gracd
The thankings of a king

POSTHUMUS
I am sir
The soldier that did company these three
In poor beseeming twas a fitment for
The purpose I then followd That I was he
Speak Iachimo I had you down and might
Have made you finish

IACHIMO

Kneeling

I am down again
But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee
As then your force did Take that life beseech you
Which I so often owe but your ring first
And here the bracelet of the truest princess
That ever swore her faith

POSTHUMUS
Kneel not to me
The power that I have on you is to spare you
The malice towards you to forgive you Live
And deal with others better

CYMBELINE
Nobly doomd
Well learn our freeness of a soninlaw
Pardons the word to all

ARVIRAGUS
You holp us sir
As you did mean indeed to be our brother
Joyd are we that you are

POSTHUMUS
Your servant Princes Good my lord of Rome
Call forth your soothsayer As I slept methought
Great Jupiter upon his eagle backd
Appeard to me with other spritely shows
Of mine own kindred When I wakd I found
This label on my bosom whose containing
Is so from sense in hardness that I can
Make no collection of it Let him show
His skill in the construction

LUCIUS
Philarmonus

SOOTHSAYER
Here my good lord

LUCIUS
Read and declare the meaning

SOOTHSAYER

Reads

Whenas a lions whelp shall to himself unknown without
seeking find and be embracd by a piece of tender air and
when from a stately cedar shall be loppd branches which
being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the
old stock and freshly grow then shall Posthumus end his
miseries Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty
Thou Leonatus art the lions whelp
The fit and apt construction of thy name
Being leonatus doth import so much

To CYMBELINE

The piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter
Which we call mollis aer and mollis aer
We term it mulier which mulier I divine
Is this most constant wife who even now
Answering the letter of the oracle
Unknown to you unsought were clippd about
With this most tender air

CYMBELINE
This hath some seeming

SOOTHSAYER
The lofty cedar royal Cymbeline
Personates thee and thy loppd branches point
Thy two sons forth who by Belarius stolen
For many years thought dead are now revivd
To the majestic cedar joind whose issue
Promises Britain peace and plenty

CYMBELINE
Well
My peace we will begin And Caius Lucius
Although the victor we submit to Caesar
And to the Roman empire promising
To pay our wonted tribute from the which
We were dissuaded by our wicked queen
Whom heavens in justice both on her and hers
Have laid most heavy hand

SOOTHSAYER
The fingers of the powers above do tune
The harmony of this peace The vision
Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke
Of yet this scarcecold battle at this instant
Is full accomplishd for the Roman eagle
From south to west on wing soaring aloft
Lessend herself and in the beams o the sun
So vanishd which foreshowd our princely eagle
The imperial Caesar should again unite
His favour with the radiant Cymbeline
Which shines here in the west

CYMBELINE
Laud we the gods
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
From our blessd altars Publish we this peace
To all our subjects Set we forward Let
A Roman and a British ensign wave
Friendly together So through Luds town march
And in the temple of great Jupiter
Our peace well ratify seal it with feasts
Set on there Never was a war did cease
Ere bloody hands were washd with such a peace

Exeunt
