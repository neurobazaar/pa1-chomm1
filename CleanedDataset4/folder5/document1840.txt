THE FINANCIER


by Theodore Dreiser



Chapter I

The Philadelphia into which Frank Algernon Cowperwood was born was
a city of two hundred and fifty thousand and more It was set with
handsome parks notable buildings and crowded with historic memories
Many of the things that we and he knew later were not then in
existencethe telegraph telephone express company ocean steamer
city delivery of mails There were no postagestamps or registered
letters The street car had not arrived In its place were hosts of
omnibuses and for longer travel the slowly developing railroad system
still largely connected by canals

Cowperwoods father was a bank clerk at the time of Franks birth
but ten years later when the boy was already beginning to turn a very
sensible vigorous eye on the world Mr Henry Worthington Cowperwood
because of the death of the banks president and the consequent moving
ahead of the other officers fell heir to the place vacated by the
promoted teller at the to him munificent salary of thirtyfive
hundred dollars a year At once he decided as he told his wife
joyously to remove his family from 21 Buttonwood Street to 124 New
Market Street a much better neighborhood where there was a nice brick
house of three stories in height as opposed to their present twostoried
domicile There was the probability that some day they would come into
something even better but for the present this was sufficient He was
exceedingly grateful

Henry Worthington Cowperwood was a man who believed only what he saw and
was content to be what he wasa banker or a prospective one He was at
this time a significant figuretall lean inquisitorial clerklywith
nice smooth closelycropped side whiskers coming to almost the lower
lobes of his ears His upper lip was smooth and curiously long and
he had a long straight nose and a chin that tended to be pointed His
eyebrows were bushy emphasizing vague grayishgreen eyes and his hair
was short and smooth and nicely parted He wore a frockcoat alwaysit
was quite the thing in financial circles in those daysand a high hat
And he kept his hands and nails immaculately clean His manner might
have been called severe though really it was more cultivated than
austere

Being ambitious to get ahead socially and financially he was very
careful of whom or with whom he talked He was as much afraid of
expressing a rabid or unpopular political or social opinion as he was
of being seen with an evil character though he had really no opinion
of great political significance to express He was neither anti nor
proslavery though the air was stormy with abolition sentiment and its
opposition He believed sincerely that vast fortunes were to be made
out of railroads if one only had the capital and that curious thing a
magnetic personalitythe ability to win the confidence of others He
was sure that Andrew Jackson was all wrong in his opposition to Nicholas
Biddle and the United States Bank one of the great issues of the day
and he was worried as he might well be by the perfect storm of wildcat
money which was floating about and which was constantly coming to his
bankdiscounted of course and handed out again to anxious borrowers
at a profit His bank was the Third National of Philadelphia located in
that center of all Philadelphia and indeed at that time of practically
all national financeThird Streetand its owners conducted a brokerage
business as a side line There was a perfect plague of State banks
great and small in those days issuing notes practically without
regulation upon insecure and unknown assets and failing and suspending
with astonishing rapidity and a knowledge of all these was an important
requirement of Mr Cowperwoods position As a result he had become the
soul of caution Unfortunately for him he lacked in a great
measure the two things that are necessary for distinction in any
fieldmagnetism and vision He was not destined to be a great
financier though he was marked out to be a moderately successful one

Mrs Cowperwood was of a religious temperamenta small woman with
lightbrown hair and clear brown eyes who had been very attractive in
her day but had become rather prim and matteroffact and inclined
to take very seriously the maternal care of her three sons and one
daughter The former captained by Frank the eldest were a source of
considerable annoyance to her for they were forever making expeditions
to different parts of the city getting in with bad boys probably and
seeing and hearing things they should neither see nor hear

Frank Cowperwood even at ten was a naturalborn leader At the day
school he attended and later at the Central High School he was looked
upon as one whose common sense could unquestionably be trusted in all
cases He was a sturdy youth courageous and defiant From the very
start of his life he wanted to know about economics and politics He
cared nothing for books He was a clean stalky shapely boy with
a bright cleancut incisive face large clear gray eyes a
wide forehead short bristly darkbrown hair He had an incisive
quickmotioned selfsufficient manner and was forever asking questions
with a keen desire for an intelligent reply He never had an ache or
pain ate his food with gusto and ruled his brothers with a rod of
iron Come on Joe Hurry Ed These commands were issued in no
rough but always a sure way and Joe and Ed came They looked up to
Frank from the first as a master and what he had to say was listened to
eagerly

He was forever pondering ponderingone fact astonishing him quite as
much as anotherfor he could not figure out how this thing he had come
intothis lifewas organized How did all these people get into the
world What were they doing here Who started things anyhow His mother
told him the story of Adam and Eve but he didnt believe it There was
a fishmarket not so very far from his home and there on his way to
see his father at the bank or conducting his brothers on afterschool
expeditions he liked to look at a certain tank in front of one store
where were kept odd specimens of sealife brought in by the Delaware Bay
fishermen He saw once there a seahorsejust a queer little seaanimal
that looked somewhat like a horseand another time he saw an electric
eel which Benjamin Franklins discovery had explained One day he saw
a squid and a lobster put in the tank and in connection with them was
witness to a tragedy which stayed with him all his life and cleared
things up considerably intellectually The lobster it appeared from
the talk of the idle bystanders was offered no food as the squid was
considered his rightful prey He lay at the bottom of the clear glass
tank on the yellow sand apparently seeing nothingyou could not
tell in which way his beady black buttons of eyes were lookingbut
apparently they were never off the body of the squid The latter pale
and waxy in texture looking very much like pork fat or jade moved
about in torpedo fashion but his movements were apparently never out of
the eyes of his enemy for by degrees small portions of his body began
to disappear snapped off by the relentless claws of his pursuer The
lobster would leap like a catapult to where the squid was apparently
idly dreaming and the squid very alert would dart away shooting out
at the same time a cloud of ink behind which it would disappear It was
not always completely successful however Small portions of its body
or its tail were frequently left in the claws of the monster below
Fascinated by the drama young Cowperwood came daily to watch

One morning he stood in front of the tank his nose almost pressed to
the glass Only a portion of the squid remained and his inkbag was
emptier than ever In the corner of the tank sat the lobster poised
apparently for action

The boy stayed as long as he could the bitter struggle fascinating him
Now maybe or in an hour or a day the squid might die slain by
the lobster and the lobster would eat him He looked again at the
greenishcopperish engine of destruction in the corner and wondered when
this would be Tonight maybe He would come back tonight

He returned that night and lo the expected had happened There was a
little crowd around the tank The lobster was in the corner Before him
was the squid cut in two and partially devoured

He got him at last observed one bystander I was standing right here
an hour ago and up he leaped and grabbed him The squid was too tired
He wasnt quick enough He did back up but that lobster he calculated
on his doing that Hes been figuring on his movements for a long time
now He got him today

Frank only stared Too bad he had missed this The least touch of sorrow
for the squid came to him as he stared at it slain Then he gazed at the
victor

Thats the way it has to be I guess he commented to himself That
squid wasnt quick enough He figured it out

The squid couldnt kill the lobsterhe had no weapon The lobster
could kill the squidhe was heavily armed There was nothing for the
squid to feed on the lobster had the squid as prey What was the result
to be What else could it be He didnt have a chance he concluded
finally as he trotted on homeward

The incident made a great impression on him It answered in a rough way
that riddle which had been annoying him so much in the past How is
life organized Things lived on each otherthat was it Lobsters lived
on squids and other things What lived on lobsters Men of course
Sure that was it And what lived on men he asked himself Was it other
men Wild animals lived on men And there were Indians and cannibals
And some men were killed by storms and accidents He wasnt so sure
about men living on men but men did kill each other How about wars and
street fights and mobs He had seen a mob once It attacked the Public
Ledger building as he was coming home from school His father had
explained why It was about the slaves That was it Sure men lived on
men Look at the slaves They were men Thats what all this excitement
was about these days Men killing other mennegroes

He went on home quite pleased with himself at his solution

Mother he exclaimed as he entered the house he finally got him

Got who What got what she inquired in amazement Go wash your
hands

Why that lobster got that squid I was telling you and pa about the
other day

Well thats too bad What makes you take any interest in such things
Run wash your hands

Well you dont often see anything like that I never did He went
out in the back yard where there was a hydrant and a post with a little
table on it and on that a shining tinpan and a bucket of water Here
he washed his face and hands

Say papa he said to his father later you know that squid

Yes

Well hes dead The lobster got him

His father continued reading Well thats too bad he said
indifferently

But for days and weeks Frank thought of this and of the life he was
tossed into for he was already pondering on what he should be in this
world and how he should get along From seeing his father count money
he was sure that he would like banking and Third Street where his
fathers office was seemed to him the cleanest most fascinating street
in the world




Chapter II


The growth of young Frank Algernon Cowperwood was through years of what
might be called a comfortable and happy family existence Buttonwood
Street where he spent the first ten years of his life was a lovely
place for a boy to live It contained mostly small two and threestory
red brick houses with small white marble steps leading up to the front
door and thin white marble trimmings outlining the front door and
windows There were trees in the streetplenty of them The road
pavement was of big round cobblestones made bright and clean by the
rains and the sidewalks were of red brick and always damp and cool In
the rear was a yard with trees and grass and sometimes flowers for
the lots were almost always one hundred feet deep and the housefronts
crowding close to the pavement in front left a comfortable space in the
rear

The Cowperwoods father and mother were not so lean and narrow that
they could not enter into the natural tendency to be happy and joyous
with their children and so this family which increased at the rate of
a child every two or three years after Franks birth until there were
four children was quite an interesting affair when he was ten and they
were ready to move into the New Market Street home Henry Worthington
Cowperwoods connections were increased as his position grew more
responsible and gradually he was becoming quite a personage He already
knew a number of the more prosperous merchants who dealt with his bank
and because as a clerk his duties necessitated his calling at other
bankinghouses he had come to be familiar with and favorably known in
the Bank of the United States the Drexels the Edwards and others The
brokers knew him as representing a very sound organization and while he
was not considered brilliant mentally he was known as a most reliable
and trustworthy individual

In this progress of his father young Cowperwood definitely shared He
was quite often allowed to come to the bank on Saturdays when he would
watch with great interest the deft exchange of bills at the brokerage
end of the business He wanted to know where all the types of money came
from why discounts were demanded and received what the men did with
all the money they received His father pleased at his interest was
glad to explain so that even at this early agefrom ten to
fifteenthe boy gained a wide knowledge of the condition of the country
financiallywhat a State bank was and what a national one what brokers
did what stocks were and why they fluctuated in value He began to
see clearly what was meant by money as a medium of exchange and how all
values were calculated according to one primary value that of gold
He was a financier by instinct and all the knowledge that pertained to
that great art was as natural to him as the emotions and subtleties
of life are to a poet This medium of exchange gold interested him
intensely When his father explained to him how it was mined he dreamed
that he owned a gold mine and waked to wish that he did He was likewise
curious about stocks and bonds and he learned that some stocks and bonds
were not worth the paper they were written on and that others were
worth much more than their face value indicated

There my son said his father to him one day you wont often see
a bundle of those around this neighborhood He referred to a series
of shares in the British East India Company deposited as collateral
at twothirds of their face value for a loan of one hundred thousand
dollars A Philadelphia magnate had hypothecated them for the use of the
ready cash Young Cowperwood looked at them curiously They dont look
like much do they he commented

They are worth just four times their face value said his father
archly

Frank reexamined them The British East India Company he read Ten
poundsthats pretty near fifty dollars

Fortyeight thirtyfive commented his father dryly Well if we
had a bundle of those we wouldnt need to work very hard Youll notice
there are scarcely any pinmarks on them They arent sent around very
much I dont suppose these have ever been used as collateral before

Young Cowperwood gave them back after a time but not without a keen
sense of the vast ramifications of finance What was the East India
Company What did it do His father told him

At home also he listened to considerable talk of financial investment
and adventure He heard for one thing of a curious character by the
name of Steemberger a great beef speculator from Virginia who was
attracted to Philadelphia in those days by the hope of large and easy
credits Steemberger so his father said was close to Nicholas Biddle
Lardner and others of the United States Bank or at least friendly with
them and seemed to be able to obtain from that organization nearly all
that he asked for His operations in the purchase of cattle in Virginia
Ohio and other States were vast amounting in fact to an entire
monopoly of the business of supplying beef to Eastern cities He was a
big man enormous with a face his father said something like that of
a pig and he wore a high beaver hat and a long frockcoat which hung
loosely about his big chest and stomach He had managed to force the
price of beef up to thirty cents a pound causing all the retailers and
consumers to rebel and this was what made him so conspicuous He used
to come to the brokerage end of the elder Cowperwoods bank with as
much as one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollars in twelve
monthspostnotes of the United States Bank in denominations of one
thousand five thousand and ten thousand dollars These he would
cash at from ten to twelve per cent under their face value having
previously given the United States Bank his own note at four months
for the entire amount He would take his pay from the Third National
brokerage counter in packages of Virginia Ohio and western
Pennsylvania banknotes at par because he made his disbursements
principally in those States The Third National would in the first
place realize a profit of from four to five per cent on the original
transaction and as it took the Western banknotes at a discount it
also made a profit on those

There was another man his father talked aboutone Francis J Grund a
famous newspaper correspondent and lobbyist at Washington who possessed
the faculty of unearthing secrets of every kind especially those
relating to financial legislation The secrets of the President and
the Cabinet as well as of the Senate and the House of Representatives
seemed to be open to him Grund had been about years before purchasing
through one or two brokers large amounts of the various kinds of Texas
debt certificates and bonds The Republic of Texas in its struggle for
independence from Mexico had issued bonds and certificates in great
variety amounting in value to ten or fifteen million dollars Later
in connection with the scheme to make Texas a State of the Union a bill
was passed providing a contribution on the part of the United States of
five million dollars to be applied to the extinguishment of this old
debt Grund knew of this and also of the fact that some of this debt
owing to the peculiar conditions of issue was to be paid in full while
other portions were to be scaled down and there was to be a false
or prearranged failure to pass the bill at one session in order to
frighten off the outsiders who might have heard and begun to buy the old
certificates for profit He acquainted the Third National Bank with this
fact and of course the information came to Cowperwood as teller He
told his wife about it and so his son in this roundabout way heard
it and his clear big eyes glistened He wondered why his father did
not take advantage of the situation and buy some Texas certificates for
himself Grund so his father said and possibly three or four others
had made over a hundred thousand dollars apiece It wasnt exactly
legitimate he seemed to think and yet it was too Why shouldnt such
inside information be rewarded Somehow Frank realized that his father
was too honest too cautious but when he grew up he told himself he
was going to be a broker or a financier or a banker and do some of
these things

Just at this time there came to the Cowperwoods an uncle who had not
previously appeared in the life of the family He was a brother of Mrs
CowperwoodsSeneca Davis by namesolid unctuous five feet ten in
height with a big round body a round smooth head rather bald a
clear ruddy complexion blue eyes and what little hair he had of
a sandy hue He was exceedingly well dressed according to standards
prevailing in those days indulging in flowered waistcoats long
lightcolored frockcoats and the invariable for a fairly prosperous
man high hat Frank was fascinated by him at once He had been a
planter in Cuba and still owned a big ranch there and could tell him
tales of Cuban liferebellions ambuscades handtohand fighting with
machetes on his own plantation and things of that sort He brought
with him a collection of Indian curies to say nothing of an independent
fortune and several slavesone named Manuel a tall rawboned black
was his constant attendant a bodyservant as it were He shipped raw
sugar from his plantation in boatloads to the Southwark wharves in
Philadelphia Frank liked him because he took life in a hearty jovial
way rather rough and offhand for this somewhat quiet and reserved
household

Why Nancy Arabella he said to Mrs Cowperwood on arriving one Sunday
afternoon and throwing the household into joyous astonishment at his
unexpected and unheralded appearance you havent grown an inch I
thought when you married old brother Hy here that you were going to
fatten up like your brother But look at you I swear to Heaven you
dont weigh five pounds And he jounced her up and down by the waist
much to the perturbation of the children who had never before seen
their mother so familiarly handled

Henry Cowperwood was exceedingly interested in and pleased at the
arrival of this rather prosperous relative for twelve years before
when he was married Seneca Davis had not taken much notice of him

Look at these little puttyfaced Philadelphians he continued They
ought to come down to my ranch in Cuba and get tanned up That would
take away this waxy look And he pinched the cheek of Anna Adelaide
now five years old I tell you Henry you have a rather nice place
here And he looked at the main room of the rather conventional
threestory house with a critical eye

Measuring twenty by twentyfour and finished in imitation cherry with a
set of new Sheraton parlor furniture it presented a quaintly harmonious
aspect Since Henry had become teller the family had acquired a pianoa
decided luxury in those daysbrought from Europe and it was intended
that Anna Adelaide when she was old enough should learn to play There
were a few uncommon ornaments in the rooma gas chandelier for one
thing a glass bowl with goldfish in it some rare and highly polished
shells and a marble Cupid bearing a basket of flowers It was summer
time the windows were open and the trees outside with their widely
extended green branches were pleasantly visible shading the brick
sidewalk Uncle Seneca strolled out into the back yard

Well this is pleasant enough he observed noting a large elm and
seeing that the yard was partially paved with brick and enclosed within
brick walls up the sides of which vines were climbing Wheres your
hammock Dont you string a hammock here in summer Down on my veranda
at San Pedro I have six or seven

We hadnt thought of putting one up because of the neighbors but it
would be nice agreed Mrs Cowperwood Henry will have to get one

I have two or three in my trunks over at the hotel My niggers make em
down there Ill send Manuel over with them in the morning

He plucked at the vines tweaked Edwards ear told Joseph the second
boy he would bring him an Indian tomahawk and went back into the
house

This is the lad that interests me he said after a time laying a
hand on the shoulder of Frank What did you name him in full Henry

Frank Algernon

Well you might have named him after me Theres something to this boy
How would you like to come down to Cuba and be a planter my boy

Im not so sure that Id like to replied the eldest

Well thats straightspoken What have you against it

Nothing except that I dont know anything about it

What do you know

The boy smiled wisely Not very much I guess

Well what are you interested in

Money

Aha Whats bred in the bone eh Get something of that from your
father eh Well thats a good trait And spoken like a man too Well
hear more about that later Nancy youre breeding a financier here I
think He talks like one

He looked at Frank carefully now There was real force in that sturdy
young bodyno doubt of it Those large clear gray eyes were full of
intelligence They indicated much and revealed nothing

A smart boy he said to Henry his brotherinlaw I like his getup
You have a bright family

Henry Cowperwood smiled dryly This man if he liked Frank might do
much for the boy He might eventually leave him some of his fortune He
was wealthy and single

Uncle Seneca became a frequent visitor to the househe and his negro
bodyguard Manuel who spoke both English and Spanish much to the
astonishment of the children and he took an increasing interest in
Frank

When that boy gets old enough to find out what he wants to do I think
Ill help him to do it he observed to his sister one day and she told
him she was very grateful He talked to Frank about his studies
and found that he cared little for books or most of the study he was
compelled to pursue Grammar was an abomination Literature silly Latin
was of no use Historywell it was fairly interesting

I like bookkeeping and arithmetic he observed I want to get out and
get to work though Thats what I want to do

Youre pretty young my son observed his uncle Youre only how old
now Fourteen

Thirteen

Well you cant leave school much before sixteen Youll do better
if you stay until seventeen or eighteen It cant do you any harm You
wont be a boy again

I dont want to be a boy I want to get to work

Dont go too fast son Youll be a man soon enough You want to be a
banker do you

Yes sir

Well when the time comes if everything is all right and youve
behaved yourself and you still want to Ill help you get a start in
business If I were you and were going to be a banker Id first spend
a year or so in some good grain and commission house Theres good
training to be had there Youll learn a lot that you ought to know
And meantime keep your health and learn all you can Wherever I am
you let me know and Ill write and find out how youve been conducting
yourself

He gave the boy a tendollar gold piece with which to start a
bankaccount And not strange to say he liked the whole Cowperwood
household much better for this dynamic selfsufficient sterling youth
who was an integral part of it





Chapter III


It was in his thirteenth year that young Cowperwood entered into his
first business venture Walking along Front Street one day a street
of importing and wholesale establishments he saw an auctioneers flag
hanging out before a wholesale grocery and from the interior came the
auctioneers voice What am I bid for this exceptional lot of Java
coffee twentytwo bags all told which is now selling in the market for
seven dollars and thirtytwo cents a bag wholesale What am I bid What
am I bid The whole lot must go as one What am I bid

Eighteen dollars suggested a trader standing near the door more to
start the bidding than anything else Frank paused

Twentytwo called another

Thirty a third Thirtyfive a fourth and so up to seventyfive
less than half of what it was worth

Im bid seventyfive Im bid seventyfive called the auctioneer
loudly Any other offers Going once at seventyfive am I offered
eighty Going twice at seventyfive andhe paused one hand raised
dramatically Then he brought it down with a slap in the palm of the
othersold to Mr Silas Gregory for seventyfive Make a note of that
Jerry he called to his redhaired frecklefaced clerk beside him
Then he turned to another lot of grocery staplesthis time starch
eleven barrels of it

Young Cowperwood was making a rapid calculation If as the auctioneer
said coffee was worth seven dollars and thirtytwo cents a bag in the
open market and this buyer was getting this coffee for seventyfive
dollars he was making then and there eightysix dollars and four cents
to say nothing of what his profit would be if he sold it at retail As
he recalled his mother was paying twentyeight cents a pound He drew
nearer his books tucked under his arm and watched these operations
closely The starch as he soon heard was valued at ten dollars a
barrel and it only brought six Some kegs of vinegar were knocked down
at onethird their value and so on He began to wish he could bid but
he had no money just a little pocket change The auctioneer noticed
him standing almost directly under his nose and was impressed with the
stoliditysolidityof the boys expression

I am going to offer you now a fine lot of Castile soapseven cases
no lesswhich as you know if you know anything about soap is now
selling at fourteen cents a bar This soap is worth anywhere at this
moment eleven dollars and seventyfive cents a case What am I bid
What am I bid What am I bid He was talking fast in the usual style
of auctioneers with much unnecessary emphasis but Cowperwood was not
unduly impressed He was already rapidly calculating for himself Seven
cases at eleven dollars and seventyfive cents would be worth just
eightytwo dollars and twentyfive cents and if it went at halfif it
went at half

Twelve dollars commented one bidder

Fifteen bid another

Twenty called a third

Twentyfive a fourth

Then it came to dollar raises for Castile soap was not such a vital
commodity Twentysix Twentyseven Twentyeight Twentynine
There was a pause Thirty observed young Cowperwood decisively

The auctioneer a short lean faced spare man with bushy hair and an
incisive eye looked at him curiously and almost incredulously but
without pausing He had somehow in spite of himself been impressed by
the boys peculiar eye and now he felt without knowing why that the
offer was probably legitimate enough and that the boy had the money He
might be the son of a grocer

Im bid thirty Im bid thirty Im bid thirty for this fine lot of
Castile soap Its a fine lot Its worth fourteen cents a bar Will
any one bid thirtyone Will any one bid thirtyone Will any one bid
thirtyone

Thirtyone said a voice

Thirtytwo replied Cowperwood The same process was repeated

Im bid thirtytwo Im bid thirtytwo Im bid thirtytwo Will
anybody bid thirtythree Its fine soap Seven cases of fine Castile
soap Will anybody bid thirtythree

Young Cowperwoods mind was working He had no money with him but his
father was teller of the Third National Bank and he could quote him as
reference He could sell all of his soap to the family grocer surely
or if not to other grocers Other people were anxious to get this soap
at this price Why not he

The auctioneer paused

Thirtytwo once Am I bid thirtythree Thirtytwo twice Am I bid
thirtythree Thirtytwo three times Seven fine cases of soap Am I bid
anything more Once twice Three times Am I bid anything morehis
hand was up againand sold to Mr He leaned over and looked
curiously into the face of his young bidder

Frank Cowperwood son of the teller of the Third National Bank
replied the boy decisively

Oh yes said the man fixed by his glance

Will you wait while I run up to the bank and get the money

Yes Dont be gone long If youre not here in an hour Ill sell it
again

Young Cowperwood made no reply He hurried out and ran fast first to
his mothers grocer whose store was within a block of his home

Thirty feet from the door he slowed up put on a nonchalant air and
strolling in looked about for Castile soap There it was the same
kind displayed in a box and looking just as his soap looked

How much is this a bar Mr Dalrymple he inquired

Sixteen cents replied that worthy

If I could sell you seven boxes for sixtytwo dollars just like this
would you take them

The same soap

Yes sir

Mr Dalrymple calculated a moment

Yes I think I would he replied cautiously

Would you pay me today

Id give you my note for it Where is the soap

He was perplexed and somewhat astonished by this unexpected proposition
on the part of his neighbors son He knew Mr Cowperwood welland
Frank also

Will you take it if I bring it to you today

Yes I will he replied Are you going into the soap business

No But I know where I can get some of that soap cheap

He hurried out again and ran to his fathers bank It was after banking
hours but he knew how to get in and he knew that his father would be
glad to see him make thirty dollars He only wanted to borrow the money
for a day

Whats the trouble Frank asked his father looking up from his desk
when he appeared breathless and red faced

I want you to loan me thirtytwo dollars Will you

Why yes I might What do you want to do with it

I want to buy some soapseven boxes of Castile soap I know where I
can get it and sell it Mr Dalrymple will take it Hes already offered
me sixtytwo for it I can get it for thirtytwo Will you let me have
the money Ive got to run back and pay the auctioneer

His father smiled This was the most businesslike attitude he had seen
his son manifest He was so keen so alert for a boy of thirteen

Why Frank he said going over to a drawer where some bills were
are you going to become a financier already Youre sure youre not
going to lose on this You know what youre doing do you

You let me have the money father will you he pleaded Ill show
you in a little bit Just let me have it You can trust me

He was like a young hound on the scent of game His father could not
resist his appeal

Why certainly Frank he replied Ill trust you And he counted
out six fivedollar certificates of the Third Nationals own issue and
two ones There you are

Frank ran out of the building with a briefly spoken thanks and returned
to the auction room as fast as his legs would carry him When he came
in sugar was being auctioned He made his way to the auctioneers
clerk

I want to pay for that soap he suggested

Now

Yes Will you give me a receipt

Yep

Do you deliver this

No No delivery You have to take it away in twentyfour hours

That difficulty did not trouble him

All right he said and pocketed his paper testimony of purchase

The auctioneer watched him as he went out In half an hour he was back
with a draymanan idle leveewharf hangeron who was waiting for a job

Frank had bargained with him to deliver the soap for sixty cents In
still another halfhour he was before the door of the astonished Mr
Dalrymple whom he had come out and look at the boxes before attempting
to remove them His plan was to have them carried on to his own home
if the operation for any reason failed to go through Though it was his
first great venture he was cool as glass

Yes said Mr Dalrymple scratching his gray head reflectively Yes
thats the same soap Ill take it Ill be as good as my word Whered
you get it Frank

At Bixoms auction up here he replied frankly and blandly

Mr Dalrymple had the drayman bring in the soap and after some
formalitybecause the agent in this case was a boymade out his note
at thirty days and gave it to him

Frank thanked him and pocketed the note He decided to go back to his
fathers bank and discount it as he had seen others doing thereby
paying his father back and getting his own profit in ready money It
couldnt be done ordinarily on any day after business hours but his
father would make an exception in his case

He hurried back whistling and his father glanced up smiling when he
came in

Well Frank howd you make out he asked

Heres a note at thirty days he said producing the paper Dalrymple
had given him Do you want to discount that for me You can take your
thirtytwo out of that

His father examined it closely Sixtytwo dollars he observed Mr
Dalrymple Thats good paper Yes I can It will cost you ten per
cent he added jestingly Why dont you just hold it though Ill
let you have the thirtytwo dollars until the end of the month

Oh no said his son you discount it and take your money I may want
mine

His father smiled at his businesslike air All right he said Ill
fix it tomorrow Tell me just how you did this And his son told him

At seven oclock that evening Franks mother heard about it and in due
time Uncle Seneca

Whatd I tell you Cowperwood he asked He has stuff in him that
youngster Look out for him

Mrs Cowperwood looked at her boy curiously at dinner Was this the
son she had nursed at her bosom not so very long before Surely he was
developing rapidly

Well Frank I hope you can do that often she said

I hope so too ma was his rather noncommittal reply

Auction sales were not to be discovered every day however and his home
grocer was only open to one such transaction in a reasonable period of
time but from the very first young Cowperwood knew how to make money
He took subscriptions for a boys paper handled the agency for the sale
of a new kind of iceskate and once organized a band of neighborhood
youths into a union for the purpose of purchasing their summer straw
hats at wholesale It was not his idea that he could get rich by saving
From the first he had the notion that liberal spending was better and
that somehow he would get along

It was in this year or a little earlier that he began to take an
interest in girls He had from the first a keen eye for the beautiful
among them and being goodlooking and magnetic himself it was not
difficult for him to attract the sympathetic interest of those in whom
he was interested A twelveyear old girl Patience Barlow who lived
further up the street was the first to attract his attention or be
attracted by him Black hair and snapping black eyes were her portion
with pretty pigtails down her back and dainty feet and ankles to match
a dainty figure She was a Quakeress the daughter of Quaker parents
wearing a demure little bonnet Her disposition however was vivacious
and she liked this selfreliant selfsufficient straightspoken boy
One day after an exchange of glances from time to time he said with a
smile and the courage that was innate in him You live up my way dont
you

Yes she replied a little flusteredthis last manifested in a
nervous swinging of her schoolbagI live at number onefortyone

I know the house he said Ive seen you go in there You go to the
same school my sister does dont you Arent you Patience Barlow He
had heard some of the boys speak her name Yes How do you know

Oh Ive heard he smiled Ive seen you Do you like licorice

He fished in his coat and pulled out some fresh sticks that were sold at
the time

Thank you she said sweetly taking one

It isnt very good Ive been carrying it a long time I had some taffy
the other day

Oh its all right she replied chewing the end of hers

Dont you know my sister Anna Cowperwood he recurred by way of
selfintroduction Shes in a lower grade than you are but I thought
maybe you might have seen her

I think I know who she is Ive seen her coming home from school

I live right over there he confided pointing to his own home as he
drew near to it as if she didnt know Ill see you around here now I
guess

Do you know Ruth Merriam she asked when he was about ready to turn
off into the cobblestone road to reach his own door

No why

Shes giving a party next Tuesday she volunteered seemingly
pointlessly but only seemingly

Where does she live

There in twentyeight

Id like to go he affirmed warmly as he swung away from her

Maybe shell ask you she called back growing more courageous as the
distance between them widened Ill ask her

Thanks he smiled

And she began to run gayly onward

He looked after her with a smiling face She was very pretty He felt
a keen desire to kiss her and what might transpire at Ruth Merriams
party rose vividly before his eyes

This was just one of the early love affairs or puppy loves that held
his mind from time to time in the mixture of after events Patience
Barlow was kissed by him in secret ways many times before he found
another girl She and others of the street ran out to play in the snow
of a winters night or lingered after dusk before her own door when the
days grew dark early It was so easy to catch and kiss her then and
to talk to her foolishly at parties Then came Dora Fitler when he was
sixteen years old and she was fourteen and Marjorie Stafford when
he was seventeen and she was fifteen Dora Fitter was a brunette and
Marjorie Stafford was as fair as the morning with brightred cheeks
bluishgray eyes and flaxen hair and as plump as a partridge

It was at seventeen that he decided to leave school He had not
graduated He had only finished the third year in high school but he
had had enough Ever since his thirteenth year his mind had been on
finance that is in the form in which he saw it manifested in Third
Street There had been odd things which he had been able to do to earn
a little money now and then His Uncle Seneca had allowed him to act
as assistant weigher at the sugardocks in Southwark where
threehundredpound bags were weighed into the government bonded
warehouses under the eyes of United States inspectors In certain
emergencies he was called to assist his father and was paid for it He
even made an arrangement with Mr Dalrymple to assist him on Saturdays
but when his father became cashier of his bank receiving an income
of four thousand dollars a year shortly after Frank had reached his
fifteenth year it was selfevident that Frank could no longer continue
in such lowly employment

Just at this time his Uncle Seneca again back in Philadelphia and
stouter and more domineering than ever said to him one day

Now Frank if youre ready for it I think I know where theres a good
opening for you There wont be any salary in it for the first year but
if you mind your ps and qs theyll probably give you something as a
gift at the end of that time Do you know of Henry Waterman  Company
down in Second Street

Ive seen their place

Well they tell me they might make a place for you as a bookkeeper
Theyre brokers in a waygrain and commission men You say you want
to get in that line When schools out you go down and see Mr
Watermantell him I sent you and hell make a place for you I think
Let me know how you come out

Uncle Seneca was married now having because of his wealth attracted
the attention of a poor but ambitious Philadelphia society matron
and because of this the general connections of the Cowperwoods were
considered vastly improved Henry Cowperwood was planning to move with
his family rather far out on North Front Street which commanded at that
time a beautiful view of the river and was witnessing the construction
of some charming dwellings His four thousand dollars a year in these
preCivilWar times was considerable He was making what he considered
judicious and conservative investments and because of his cautious
conservative clocklike conduct it was thought he might reasonably
expect some day to be vicepresident and possibly president of his
bank

This offer of Uncle Seneca to get him in with Waterman  Company seemed
to Frank just the thing to start him off right So he reported to
that organization at 74 South Second Street one day in June and
was cordially received by Mr Henry Waterman Sr There was he soon
learned a Henry Waterman Jr a young man of twentyfive and a George
Waterman a brother aged fifty who was the confidential inside man
Henry Waterman Sr a man of fiftyfive years of age was the general
head of the organization inside and outtraveling about the nearby
territory to see customers when that was necessary coming into final
counsel in cases where his brother could not adjust matters suggesting
and advising new ventures which his associates and hirelings carried
out He was to look at a phlegmatic type of manshort stout
wrinkled about the eyes rather protuberant as to stomach rednecked
redfaced the least bit popeyed but shrewd kindly goodnatured and
witty He had because of his naturally commonsense ideas and rather
pleasing disposition built up a sound and successful business here He
was getting strong in years and would gladly have welcomed the hearty
cooperation of his son if the latter had been entirely suited to the
business

He was not however Not as democratic as quickwitted or as pleased
with the work in hand as was his father the business actually offended
him And if the trade had been left to his care it would have rapidly
disappeared His father foresaw this was grieved and was hoping
some young man would eventually appear who would be interested in the
business handle it in the same spirit in which it had been handled and
who would not crowd his son out

Then came young Cowperwood spoken of to him by Seneca Davis He looked
him over critically Yes this boy might do he thought There was
something easy and sufficient about him He did not appear to be in the
least flustered or disturbed He knew how to keep books he said though
he knew nothing of the details of the grain and commission business It
was interesting to him He would like to try it

I like that fellow Henry Waterman confided to his brother the moment
Frank had gone with instructions to report the following morning
Theres something to him Hes the cleanest briskest most alive thing
thats walked in here in many a day

Yes said George a much leaner and slightly taller man with
dark blurry reflective eyes and a thin largely vanished growth of
brownishblack hair which contrasted strangely with the eggshaped
whiteness of his bald head Yes hes a nice young man Its a wonder
his father dont take him in his bank

Well he may not be able to said his brother Hes only the cashier
there

Thats right

Well well give him a trial I bet anything he makes good Hes a
likelylooking youth

Henry got up and walked out into the main entrance looking into Second
Street The cool cobble pavements shaded from the eastern sun by the
wall of buildings on the eastof which his was a partthe noisy trucks
and drays the busy crowds hurrying to and fro pleased him He looked
at the buildings over the wayall three and four stories and largely
of gray stone and crowded with lifeand thanked his stars that he
had originally located in so prosperous a neighborhood If he had only
brought more property at the time he bought this

I wish that Cowperwood boy would turn out to be the kind of man I
want he observed to himself meditatively He could save me a lot of
running these days

Curiously after only three or four minutes of conversation with the
boy he sensed this marked quality of efficiency Something told him he
would do well





Chapter IV


The appearance of Frank Cowperwood at this time was to say the least
prepossessing and satisfactory Nature had destined him to be about five
feet ten inches tall His head was large shapely notably commercial in
aspect thickly covered with crisp darkbrown hair and fixed on a pair
of square shoulders and a stocky body Already his eyes had the look
that subtle years of thought bring They were inscrutable You could
tell nothing by his eyes He walked with a light confident springy
step Life had given him no severe shocks nor rude awakenings He had
not been compelled to suffer illness or pain or deprivation of any kind
He saw people richer than himself but he hoped to be rich His family
was respected his father well placed He owed no man anything Once he
had let a small note of his become overdue at the bank but his father
raised such a row that he never forgot it I would rather crawl on
my hands and knees than let my paper go to protest the old gentleman
observed and this fixed in his mind what scarcely needed to be so
sharply emphasizedthe significance of credit No paper of his ever
went to protest or became overdue after that through any negligence of
his

He turned out to be the most efficient clerk that the house of Waterman
 Co had ever known They put him on the books at first as assistant
bookkeeper vice Mr Thomas Trixler dismissed and in two weeks George
said Why dont we make Cowperwood head bookkeeper He knows more in a
minute than that fellow Sampson will ever know

All right make the transfer George but dont fuss so He wont be a
bookkeeper long though I want to see if he cant handle some of these
transfers for me after a bit

The books of Messrs Waterman  Co though fairly complicated were
childs play to Frank He went through them with an ease and rapidity
which surprised his erstwhile superior Mr Sampson

Why that fellow Sampson told another clerk on the first day he had
seen Cowperwood work hes too brisk Hes going to make a bad break I
know that kind Wait a little bit until we get one of those rush credit
and transfer days But the bad break Mr Sampson anticipated did not
materialize In less than a week Cowperwood knew the financial condition
of the Messrs Waterman as well as they didbetterto a dollar He
knew how their accounts were distributed from what section they drew
the most business who sent poor produce and goodthe varying prices
for a year told that To satisfy himself he ran back over certain
accounts in the ledger verifying his suspicions Bookkeeping did not
interest him except as a record a demonstration of a firms life He
knew he would not do this long Something else would happen but he saw
instantly what the grain and commission business wasevery detail of
it He saw where for want of greater activity in offering the goods
consignedquicker communication with shippers and buyers a better
working agreement with surrounding commission menthis house or
rather its customers for it had nothing endured severe losses A man
would ship a towboat or a carload of fruit or vegetables against a
supposedly rising or stable market but if ten other men did the same
thing at the same time or other commission men were flooded with
fruit or vegetables and there was no way of disposing of them within
a reasonable time the price had to fall Every day was bringing its
special consignments It instantly occurred to him that he would be
of much more use to the house as an outside man disposing of heavy
shipments but he hesitated to say anything so soon More than likely
things would adjust themselves shortly

The Watermans Henry and George were greatly pleased with the way
he handled their accounts There was a sense of security in his very
presence He soon began to call Brother Georges attention to the
condition of certain accounts making suggestions as to their possible
liquidation or discontinuance which pleased that individual greatly He
saw a way of lightening his own labors through the intelligence of
this youth while at the same time developing a sense of pleasant
companionship with him

Brother Henry was for trying him on the outside It was not always
possible to fill the orders with the stock on hand and somebody had to
go into the street or the Exchange to buy and usually he did this
One morning when waybills indicated a probable glut of flour and a
shortage of grainFrank saw it firstthe elder Waterman called him
into his office and said

Frank I wish you would see what you can do with this condition that
confronts us on the street By tomorrow were going to be overcrowded
with flour We cant be paying storage charges and our orders wont eat
it up Were short on grain Maybe you could trade out the flour to some
of those brokers and get me enough grain to fill these orders

Id like to try said his employee

He knew from his books where the various commissionhouses were He knew
what the local merchants exchange and the various commissionmerchants
who dealt in these things had to offer This was the thing he liked to
doadjust a trade difficulty of this nature It was pleasant to be out
in the air again to be going from door to door He objected to desk
work and pen work and poring over books As he said in later years his
brain was his office He hurried to the principal commissionmerchants
learning what the state of the flour market was and offering his
surplus at the very rate he would have expected to get for it if
there had been no prospective glut Did they want to buy for immediate
delivery fortyeight hours being immediate six hundred barrels of
prime flour He would offer it at nine dollars straight in the barrel
They did not He offered it in fractions and some agreed to take one
portion and some another In about an hour he was all secure on this
save one lot of two hundred barrels which he decided to offer in one
lump to a famous operator named Genderman with whom his firm did no
business The latter a big man with curly gray hair a gnarled and
yet pudgy face and little eyes that peeked out shrewdly through fat
eyelids looked at Cowperwood curiously when he came in

Whats your name young man he asked leaning back in his wooden
chair

Cowperwood

So you work for Waterman  Company You want to make a record no
doubt Thats why you came to me

Cowperwood merely smiled

Well Ill take your flour I need it Bill it to me

Cowperwood hurried out He went direct to a firm of brokers in Walnut
Street with whom his firm dealt and had them bid in the grain he
needed at prevailing rates Then he returned to the office

Well said Henry Waterman when he reported you did that quick Sold
old Genderman two hundred barrels direct did you Thats doing pretty
well He isnt on our books is he

No sir

I thought not Well if you can do that sort of work on the street you
wont be on the books long

Thereafter in the course of time Frank became a familiar figure in
the commission district and on change the Produce Exchange striking
balances for his employer picking up odd lots of things they needed
soliciting new customers breaking gluts by disposing of odd lots
in unexpected quarters Indeed the Watermans were astonished at
his facility in this respect He had an uncanny faculty for getting
appreciative hearings making friends being introduced into new realms
New life began to flow through the old channels of the Waterman company
Their customers were better satisfied George was for sending him out
into the rural districts to drum up trade and this was eventually done

Near Christmastime Henry said to George Well have to make Cowperwood
a liberal present He hasnt any salary How would five hundred dollars
do

Thats pretty much seeing the way times are but I guess hes worth
it Hes certainly done everything weve expected and more Hes cut
out for this business

What does he say about it Do you ever hear him say whether hes
satisfied

Oh he likes it pretty much I guess You see him as much as I do

Well well make it five hundred That fellow wouldnt make a bad
partner in this business some day He has the real knack for it You see
that he gets the five hundred dollars with a word from both of us

So the night before Christmas as Cowperwood was looking over some
waybills and certificates of consignment preparatory to leaving all in
order for the intervening holiday George Waterman came to his desk

Hard at it he said standing under the flaring gaslight and looking
at his brisk employee with great satisfaction

It was early evening and the snow was making a speckled pattern through
the windows in front

Just a few points before I wind up smiled Cowperwood

My brother and I have been especially pleased with the way you have
handled the work here during the past six months We wanted to make
some acknowledgment and we thought about five hundred dollars would be
right Beginning January first well give you a regular salary of thirty
dollars a week

Im certainly much obliged to you said Frank I didnt expect that
much Its a good deal Ive learned considerable here that Im glad to
know

Oh dont mention it We know youve earned it You can stay with us as
long as you like Were glad to have you with us

Cowperwood smiled his hearty genial smile He was feeling very
comfortable under this evidence of approval He looked bright and cheery
in his wellmade clothes of English tweed

On the way home that evening he speculated as to the nature of this
business He knew he wasnt going to stay there long even in spite of
this gift and promise of salary They were grateful of course but
why shouldnt they be He was efficient he knew that under him things
moved smoothly It never occurred to him that he belonged in the realm
of clerkdom Those people were the kind of beings who ought to work for
him and who would There was nothing savage in his attitude no rage
against fate no dark fear of failure These two men he worked for
were already nothing more than characters in his eyestheir
business significated itself He could see their weaknesses and their
shortcomings as a much older man might have viewed a boys

After dinner that evening before leaving to call on his girl Marjorie
Stafford he told his father of the gift of five hundred dollars and the
promised salary

Thats splendid said the older man Youre doing better than I
thought I suppose youll stay there

No I wont I think Ill quit sometime next year

Why

Well it isnt exactly what I want to do Its all right but Id
rather try my hand at brokerage I think That appeals to me

Dont you think you are doing them an injustice not to tell them

Not at all They need me All the while surveying himself in a mirror
straightening his tie and adjusting his coat

Have you told your mother

No Im going to do it now

He went out into the diningroom where his mother was and slipping his
arms around her little body said What do you think Mammy

Well what she asked looking affectionately into his eyes

I got five hundred dollars tonight and I get thirty a week next year
What do you want for Christmas

You dont say Isnt that nice Isnt that fine They must like you
Youre getting to be quite a man arent you

What do you want for Christmas

Nothing I dont want anything I have my children

He smiled All right Then nothing it is

But she knew he would buy her something

He went out pausing at the door to grab playfully at his sisters
waist and saying that hed be back about midnight hurried to
Marjories house because he had promised to take her to a show

Anything you want for Christmas this year Margy he asked after
kissing her in the dimlylighted hall I got five hundred tonight

She was an innocent little thing only fifteen no guile no shrewdness

Oh you neednt get me anything

Neednt I he asked squeezing her waist and kissing her mouth again

It was fine to be getting on this way in the world and having such a
good time





Chapter V


The following October having passed his eighteenth year by nearly six
months and feeling sure that he would never want anything to do with
the grain and commission business as conducted by the Waterman Company
Cowperwood decided to sever his relations with them and enter the employ
of Tighe  Company bankers and brokers

Cowperwoods meeting with Tighe  Company had come about in the ordinary
pursuance of his duties as outside man for Waterman  Company From the
first Mr Tighe took a keen interest in this subtle young emissary

Hows business with you people he would ask genially or Find that
youre getting many IOUs these days

Because of the unsettled condition of the country the overinflation of
securities the slavery agitation and so forth there were prospects
of hard times And Tighehe could not have told you whywas convinced
that this young man was worth talking to in regard to all this He was
not really old enough to know and yet he did know

Oh things are going pretty well with us thank you Mr Tighe
Cowperwood would answer

I tell you he said to Cowperwood one morning this slavery
agitation if it doesnt stop is going to cause trouble

A negro slave belonging to a visitor from Cuba had just been abducted
and set free because the laws of Pennsylvania made freedom the right of
any negro brought into the state even though in transit only to another
portion of the country and there was great excitement because of it
Several persons had been arrested and the newspapers were discussing it
roundly

I dont think the South is going to stand for this thing Its making
trouble in our business and it must be doing the same thing for others
Well have secession here sure as fate one of these days He talked
with the vaguest suggestion of a brogue

Its coming I think said Cowperwood quietly It cant be healed
in my judgment The negro isnt worth all this excitement but theyll
go on agitating for himemotional people always do this They havent
anything else to do Its hurting our Southern trade

I thought so Thats what people tell me

He turned to a new customer as young Cowperwood went out but again
the boy struck him as being inexpressibly sound and deepthinking on
financial matters If that young fellow wanted a place Id give it to
him he thought

Finally one day he said to him How would you like to try your hand at
being a floor man for me in change I need a young man here One of my
clerks is leaving

Id like it replied Cowperwood smiling and looking intensely
gratified I had thought of speaking to you myself some time

Well if youre ready and can make the change the place is open Come
any time you like

Ill have to give a reasonable notice at the other place Cowperwood
said quietly Would you mind waiting a week or two

Not at all It isnt as important as that Come as soon as you can
straighten things out I dont want to inconvenience your employers

It was only two weeks later that Frank took his departure from Waterman
 Company interested and yet in no way flustered by his new prospects
And great was the grief of Mr George Waterman As for Mr Henry
Waterman he was actually irritated by this defection

Why I thought he exclaimed vigorously when informed by Cowperwood
of his decision that you liked the business Is it a matter of
salary

No not at all Mr Waterman Its just that I want to get into the
straightout brokerage business

Well that certainly is too bad Im sorry I dont want to urge you
against your own best interests You know what you are doing But George
and I had about agreed to offer you an interest in this thing after a
bit Now youre picking up and leaving Why damn it man theres good
money in this business

I know it smiled Cowperwood but I dont like it I have other plans
in view Ill never be a grain and commission man Mr Henry Waterman
could scarcely understand why obvious success in this field did not
interest him He feared the effect of his departure on the business

And once the change was made Cowperwood was convinced that this new work
was more suited to him in every wayas easy and more profitable of
course In the first place the firm of Tighe  Co unlike that of
Waterman  Co was located in a handsome greengray stone building
at 66 South Third Street in what was then and for a number of years
afterward the heart of the financial district Great institutions of
national and international import and repute were near at handDrexel
 Co Edward Clark  Co the Third National Bank the First National
Bank the Stock Exchange and similar institutions Almost a score of
smaller banks and brokerage firms were also in the vicinity Edward
Tighe the head and brains of this concern was a Boston Irishman
the son of an immigrant who had flourished and done well in that
conservative city He had come to Philadelphia to interest himself in
the speculative life there Sure its a right good place for those of
us who are awake he told his friends with a slight Irish accent and
he considered himself very much awake He was a mediumtall man not
very stout slightly and prematurely gray and with a manner which was
as lively and goodnatured as it was combative and selfreliant His
upper lip was ornamented by a short gray mustache

May heaven preserve me he said not long after he came there these
Pennsylvanians never pay for anything they can issue bonds for It
was the period when Pennsylvanias credit and for that matter
Philadelphias was very bad in spite of its great wealth If theres
ever a war therell be battalions of Pennsylvanians marching around
offering notes for their meals If I could just live long enough I could
get rich buyin up Pennsylvania notes and bonds I think theyll pay
some time but my God theyre mortal slow Ill be dead before the
State government will ever catch up on the interest they owe me now

It was true The condition of the finances of the state and city was
most reprehensible Both State and city were rich enough but there were
so many schemes for looting the treasury in both instances that when any
new work had to be undertaken bonds were necessarily issued to raise the
money These bonds or warrants as they were called pledged interest
at six per cent but when the interest fell due instead of paying it
the city or State treasurer as the case might be stamped the same with
the date of presentation and the warrant then bore interest for not
only its original face value but the amount then due in interest In
other words it was being slowly compounded But this did not help
the man who wanted to raise money for as security they could not be
hypothecated for more than seventy per cent of their market value and
they were not selling at par but at ninety A man might buy or accept
them in foreclosure but he had a long wait Also in the final payment
of most of them favoritism ruled for it was only when the treasurer
knew that certain warrants were in the hands of a friend that he would
advertise that such and such warrantsthose particular ones that he
knew aboutwould be paid

What was more the money system of the United States was only then
beginning slowly to emerge from something approximating chaos to
something more nearly approaching order The United States Bank of
which Nicholas Biddle was the progenitor had gone completely in 1841
and the United States Treasury with its subtreasury system had come
in 1846 but still there were many many wildcat banks sufficient
in number to make the average exchangecounter broker a walking
encyclopedia of solvent and insolvent institutions Still things
were slowly improving for the telegraph had facilitated stockmarket
quotations not only between New York Boston and Philadelphia but
between a local brokers office in Philadelphia and his stock
exchange In other words the short private wire had been introduced
Communication was quicker and freer and daily grew better

Railroads had been built to the South East North and West There was
as yet no stockticker and no telephone and the clearinghouse had only
recently been thought of in New York and had not yet been introduced in
Philadelphia Instead of a clearinghouse service messengers ran daily
between banks and brokerage firms balancing accounts on passbooks
exchanging bills and once a week transferring the gold coin which
was the only thing that could be accepted for balances due since there
was no stable national currency On change when the gong struck
announcing the close of the days business a company of young men
known as settlement clerks after a system borrowed from London
gathered in the center of the room and compared or gathered the various
trades of the day in a ring thus eliminating all those sales and
resales between certain firms which naturally canceled each other They
carried long account books and called out the transactionsDelaware
and Maryland sold to Beaumont and Company Delware and Maryland sold
to Tighe and Company and so on This simplified the bookkeeping of
the various firms and made for quicker and more stirring commercial
transactions

Seats on change sold for two thousand dollars each The members of
the exchange had just passed rules limiting the trading to the hours
between ten and three before this they had been any time between
morning and midnight and had fixed the rates at which brokers could do
business in the face of cutthroat schemes which had previously held
Severe penalties were fixed for those who failed to obey In other
words things were shaping up for a great change business and Edward
Tighe felt with other brokers that there was a great future ahead





Chapter VI


The Cowperwood family was by this time established in its new and larger
and more tastefully furnished house on North Front Street facing the
river The house was four stories tall and stood twentyfive feet on the
street front without a yard

Here the family began to entertain in a small way and there came to see
them now and then representatives of the various interests that
Henry Cowperwood had encountered in his upward climb to the position
of cashier It was not a very distinguished company but it included a
number of people who were about as successful as himselfheads of
small businesses who traded at his bank dealers in drygoods leather
groceries wholesale and grain The children had come to have
intimacies of their own Now and then because of church connections
Mrs Cowperwood ventured to have an afternoon tea or reception at which
even Cowperwood attempted the gallant in so far as to stand about in a
genially foolish way and greet those whom his wife had invited And so
long as he could maintain his gravity very solemnly and greet people
without being required to say much it was not too painful for him
Singing was indulged in at times a little dancing on occasion and
there was considerably more company to dinner informally than there
had been previously

And here it was during the first year of the new life in this house
that Frank met a certain Mrs Semple who interested him greatly Her
husband had a pretentious shoe store on Chestnut Street near Third and
was planning to open a second one farther out on the same street

The occasion of the meeting was an evening call on the part of the
Semples Mr Semple being desirous of talking with Henry Cowperwood
concerning a new transportation feature which was then entering the
worldnamely streetcars A tentative line incorporated by the North
Pennsylvania Railway Company had been put into operation on a mile and
a half of tracks extending from Willow Street along Front to Germantown
Road and thence by various streets to what was then known as the
Cohocksink Depot and it was thought that in time this mode of
locomotion might drive out the hundreds of omnibuses which now crowded
and made impassable the downtown streets Young Cowperwood had been
greatly interested from the start Railway transportation as a whole
interested him anyway but this particular phase was most fascinating
It was already creating widespread discussion and he with others had
gone to see it A strange but interesting new type of car fourteen feet
long seven feet wide and nearly the same height running on small
iron carwheels was giving great satisfaction as being quieter
and easierriding than omnibuses and Alfred Semple was privately
considering investing in another proposed line which if it could secure
a franchise from the legislature was to run on Fifth and Sixth streets

Cowperwood Senior saw a great future for this thing but he did not
see as yet how the capital was to be raised for it Frank believed that
Tighe  Co should attempt to become the selling agents of this new
stock of the Fifth and Sixth Street Company in the event it succeeded
in getting a franchise He understood that a company was already formed
that a large amount of stock was to be issued against the prospective
franchise and that these shares were to be sold at five dollars
as against an ultimate par value of one hundred He wished he had
sufficient money to take a large block of them

Meanwhile Lillian Semple caught and held his interest Just what it was
about her that attracted him at this age it would be hard to say
for she was really not suited to him emotionally intellectually or
otherwise He was not without experience with women or girls and
still held a tentative relationship with Marjorie Stafford but Lillian
Semple in spite of the fact that she was married and that he could have
legitimate interest in her seemed not wiser and saner but more worth
while She was twentyfour as opposed to Franks nineteen but still
young enough in her thoughts and looks to appear of his own age She was
slightly taller than hethough he was now his full height five feet
ten and onehalf inchesand despite her height shapely artistic
in form and feature and with a certain unconscious placidity of soul
which came more from lack of understanding than from force of character
Her hair was the color of a dried English walnut rich and plentiful
and her complexion waxencream waxwith lips of faint pink and eyes
that varied from gray to blue and from gray to brown according to the
light in which you saw them Her hands were thin and shapely her nose
straight her face artistically narrow She was not brilliant
not active but rather peaceful and statuesque without knowing it
Cowperwood was carried away by her appearance Her beauty measured up to
his present sense of the artistic She was lovely he thoughtgracious
dignified If he could have his choice of a wife this was the kind of a
girl he would like to have

As yet Cowperwoods judgment of women was temperamental rather than
intellectual Engrossed as he was by his desire for wealth prestige
dominance he was confused if not chastened by considerations relating
to position presentability and the like None the less the homely
woman meant nothing to him And the passionate woman meant much He
heard family discussions of this and that sacrificial soul among women
as well as among menwomen who toiled and slaved for their husbands
or children or both who gave way to relatives or friends in crises
or crucial moments because it was right and kind to do sobut
somehow these stories did not appeal to him He preferred to think of
peopleeven womenas honestly frankly selfinterested He could
not have told you why People seemed foolish or at the best very
unfortunate not to know what to do in all circumstances and how to
protect themselves There was great talk concerning morality much
praise of virtue and decency and much lifting of hands in righteous
horror at people who broke or were even rumored to have broken the
Seventh Commandment He did not take this talk seriously Already he had
broken it secretly many times Other young men did Yet again he was a
little sick of the women of the streets and the bagnio There were
too many coarse evil features in connection with such contacts For
a little while the false tinselglitter of the house of ill repute
appealed to him for there was a certain force to its luxuryrich as
a rule with redplush furniture showy red hangings some coarse but
showilyframed pictures and above all the strongbodied or sensuously
lymphatic women who dwelt there to as his mother phrased it prey on
men The strength of their bodies the lust of their souls the fact
that they could with a show of affection or goodnature receive man
after man astonished and later disgusted him After all they were not
smart There was no vivacity of thought there All that they could do
in the main he fancied was this one thing He pictured to himself the
dreariness of the mornings after the stale dregs of things when only
sleep and thought of gain could aid in the least and more than once
even at his age he shook his head He wanted contact which was more
intimate subtle individual personal

So came Lillian Semple who was nothing more to him than the shadow of
an ideal Yet she cleared up certain of his ideas in regard to women
She was not physically as vigorous or brutal as those other women
whom he had encountered in the lupanars thus farraw unashamed
contraveners of accepted theories and notionsand for that very
reason he liked her And his thoughts continued to dwell on her
notwithstanding the hectic days which now passed like flashes of light
in his new business venture For this stock exchange world in which
he now found himself primitive as it would seem today was most
fascinating to Cowperwood The room that he went to in Third Street at
Dock where the brokers or their agents and clerks gathered one hundred
and fifty strong was nothing to speak of artisticallya square
chamber sixty by sixty reaching from the second floor to the roof of a
fourstory building but it was striking to him The windows were high
and narrow a largefaced clock faced the west entrance of the
room where you came in from the stairs a collection of telegraph
instruments with their accompanying desks and chairs occupied the
northeast corner On the floor in the early days of the exchange were
rows of chairs where the brokers sat while various lots of stocks were
offered to them Later in the history of the exchange the chairs were
removed and at different points posts or floorsigns indicating where
certain stocks were traded in were introduced Around these the men who
were interested gathered to do their trading From a hall on the third
floor a door gave entrance to a visitors gallery small and poorly
furnished and on the west wall a large blackboard carried current
quotations in stocks as telegraphed from New York and Boston A
wicketlike fence in the center of the room surrounded the desk and
chair of the official recorder and a very small gallery opening from
the third floor on the west gave place for the secretary of the board
when he had any special announcement to make There was a room off the
southwest corner where reports and annual compendiums of chairs were
removed and at different signs indicating where certain stocks of
various kinds were kept and were available for the use of members

Young Cowperwood would not have been admitted at all as either a broker
or brokers agent or assistant except that Tighe feeling that he
needed him and believing that he would be very useful bought him a seat
on changecharging the two thousand dollars it cost as a debt and then
ostensibly taking him into partnership It was against the rules of the
exchange to sham a partnership in this way in order to put a man on the
floor but brokers did it These men who were known to be minor partners
and floor assistants were derisively called eighth chasers and
twodollar brokers because they were always seeking small orders and
were willing to buy or sell for anybody on their commission accounting
of course to their firms for their work Cowperwood regardless of his
intrinsic merits was originally counted one of their number and he was
put under the direction of Mr Arthur Rivers the regular floor man of
Tighe  Company

Rivers was an exceedingly forceful man of thirtyfive welldressed
wellformed with a hard smooth evenly chiseled face which was
ornamented by a short black mustache and fine black clearly penciled
eyebrows His hair came to an odd point at the middle of his forehead
where he divided it and his chin was faintly and attractively cleft He
had a soft voice a quiet conservative manner and both in and out of
this brokerage and trading world was controlled by good form Cowperwood
wondered at first why Rivers should work for Tighehe appeared almost
as ablebut afterward learned that he was in the company Tighe was the
organizer and general handshaker Rivers the floor and outside man

It was useless as Frank soon found to try to figure out exactly why
stocks rose and fell Some general reasons there were of course as he
was told by Tighe but they could not always be depended on

Sure anything can make or break a marketTighe explained in his
delicate broguefrom the failure of a bank to the rumor that your
second cousins grandmother has a cold Its a most unusual world
Cowperwood No man can explain it Ive seen breaks in stocks that you
could never explain at allno one could It wouldnt be possible to
find out why they broke Ive seen rises the same way My God the
rumors of the stock exchange They beat the devil If theyre going down
in ordinary times some one is unloading or theyre rigging the market
If theyre going upGod knows times must be good or somebody must
be buyingthats sure Beyond thatwell ask Rivers to show you the
ropes Dont you ever lose for me though Thats the cardinal sin in
this office He grinned maliciously even if kindly at that

Cowperwood understoodnone better This subtle world appealed to him
It answered to his temperament

There were rumors rumors rumorsof great railway and streetcar
undertakings land developments government revision of the tariff war
between France and Turkey famine in Russia or Ireland and so on The
first Atlantic cable had not been laid as yet and news of any kind from
abroad was slow and meager Still there were great financial figures in
the held men who like Cyrus Field or William H Vanderbilt or F X
Drexel were doing marvelous things and their activities and the rumors
concerning them counted for much

Frank soon picked up all of the technicalities of the situation A
bull he learned was one who bought in anticipation of a higher price
to come and if he was loaded up with a line of stocks he was said
to be long He sold to realize his profit or if his margins were
exhausted he was wiped out A bear was one who sold stocks which
most frequently he did not have in anticipation of a lower price at
which he could buy and satisfy his previous sales He was short when
he had sold what he did not own and he covered when he bought to
satisfy his sales and to realize his profits or to protect himself
against further loss in case prices advanced instead of declining He
was in a corner when he found that he could not buy in order to make
good the stock he had borrowed for delivery and the return of which
had been demanded He was then obliged to settle practically at a price
fixed by those to whom he and other shorts had sold

He smiled at first at the air of great secrecy and wisdom on the part
of the younger men They were so heartily and foolishly suspicious The
older men as a rule were inscrutable They pretended indifference
uncertainty They were like certain fish after a certain kind of bait
however Snap and the opportunity was gone Somebody else had picked up
what you wanted All had their little notebooks All had their peculiar
squint of eye or position or motion which meant Done I take you
Sometimes they seemed scarcely to confirm their sales or purchasesthey
knew each other so wellbut they did If the market was for any reason
active the brokers and their agents were apt to be more numerous than
if it were dull and the trading indifferent A gong sounded the call to
trading at ten oclock and if there was a noticeable rise or decline in
a stock or a group of stocks you were apt to witness quite a spirited
scene Fifty to a hundred men would shout gesticulate shove here and
there in an apparently aimless manner endeavoring to take advantage of
the stock offered or called for

Fiveeighths for five hundred P and W some one would callRivers
or Cowperwood or any other broker

Five hundred at threefourths would come the reply from some one
else who either had an order to sell the stock at that price or who
was willing to sell it short hoping to pick up enough of the stock at
a lower figure later to fill his order and make a little something
besides If the supply of stock at that figure was large Rivers would
probably continue to bid fiveeighths If on the other hand he noticed
an increasing demand he would probably pay threefourths for it If
the professional traders believed Rivers had a large buying order they
would probably try to buy the stock before he could at threefourths
believing they could sell it out to him at a slightly higher price The
professional traders were of course keen students of psychology and
their success depended on their ability to guess whether or not a broker
representing a big manipulator like Tighe had an order large enough
to affect the market sufficiently to give them an opportunity to get
in and out as they termed it at a profit before he had completed the
execution of his order They were like hawks watching for an opportunity
to snatch their prey from under the very claws of their opponents

Four five ten fifteen twenty thirty forty fifty and sometimes
the whole company would attempt to take advantage of the given rise of
a given stock by either selling or offering to buy in which case the
activity and the noise would become deafening Given groups might
be trading in different things but the large majority of them would
abandon what they were doing in order to take advantage of a speciality
The eagerness of certain young brokers or clerks to discover all that
was going on and to take advantage of any given rise or fall made
for quick physical action darting to and fro the excited elevation of
explanatory fingers Distorted faces were shoved over shoulders or
under arms The most ridiculous grimaces were purposely or unconsciously
indulged in At times there were situations in which some individual was
fairly smothered with arms faces shoulders crowded toward him when
he manifested any intention of either buying or selling at a
profitable rate At first it seemed quite a wonderful thing to young
Cowperwoodthe very physical face of itfor he liked human presence
and activity but a little later the sense of the thing as a picture or
a dramatic situation of which he was a part faded and he came down to
a clearer sense of the intricacies of the problem before him Buying
and selling stocks as he soon learned was an art a subtlety almost a
psychic emotion Suspicion intuition feelingthese were the things to
be long on

Yet in time he also asked himself who was it who made the real
moneythe stockbrokers Not at all Some of them were making money
but they were as he quickly saw like a lot of gulls or stormy petrels
hanging on the lee of the wind hungry and anxious to snap up any
unwary fish Back of them were other men men with shrewd ideas subtle
resources Men of immense means whose enterprise and holdings these
stocks represented the men who schemed out and built the railroads
opened the mines organized trading enterprises and built up immense
manufactories They might use brokers or other agents to buy and sell on
change but this buying and selling must be and always was incidental
to the actual factthe mine the railroad the wheat crop the flour
mill and so on Anything less than straightout sales to realize
quickly on assets or buying to hold as an investment was gambling
pure and simple and these men were gamblers He was nothing more than
a gamblers agent It was not troubling him any just at this moment but
it was not at all a mystery now what he was As in the case of Waterman
 Company he sized up these men shrewdly judging some to be weak some
foolish some clever some slow but in the main all smallminded or
deficient because they were agents tools or gamblers A man a real
man must never be an agent a tool or a gambleracting for himself
or for othershe must employ such A real mana financierwas never a
tool He used tools He created He led

Clearly very clearly at nineteen twenty and twentyone years of age
he saw all this but he was not quite ready yet to do anything about it
He was certain however that his day would come





Chapter VII


In the meantime his interest in Mrs Semple had been secretly and
strangely growing When he received an invitation to call at the Semple
home he accepted with a great deal of pleasure Their house was located
not so very far from his own on North Front Street in the neighborhood
of what is now known as No 956 It had in summer quite a wealth of
green leaves and vines The little side porch which ornamented its south
wall commanded a charming view of the river and all the windows and
doors were topped with lunettes of smallpaned glass The interior
of the house was not as pleasing as he would have had it Artistic
impressiveness as to the furniture at least was wanting although it
was new and good The pictures werewell simply pictures There were
no books to speak ofthe Bible a few current novels some of the more
significant histories and a collection of antiquated odds and ends in
the shape of books inherited from relatives The china was goodof a
delicate pattern The carpets and wallpaper were too high in key So it
went Still the personality of Lillian Semple was worth something
for she was really pleasing to look upon making a picture wherever she
stood or sat

There were no childrena dispensation of sex conditions which had
nothing to do with her for she longed to have them She was without any
notable experience in social life except such as had come to the Wiggin
family of which she was a memberrelatives and a few neighborhood
friends visiting Lillian Wiggin that was her maiden namehad two
brothers and one sister all living in Philadelphia and all married at
this time They thought she had done very well in her marriage

It could not be said that she had wildly loved Mr Semple at any time
Although she had cheerfully married him he was not the kind of man who
could arouse a notable passion in any woman He was practical methodic
orderly His shoe store was a good onewellstocked with styles
reflecting the current tastes and a model of cleanliness and what one
might term pleasing brightness He loved to talk when he talked at
all of shoe manufacturing the development of lasts and styles The
readymade shoemachinemade to a certain extentwas just coming into
its own slowly and outside of these supplies of which he kept he
employed benchmaking shoemakers satisfying his customers with personal
measurements and making the shoes to order

Mrs Semple read a littlenot much She had a habit of sitting and
apparently brooding reflectively at times but it was not based on any
deep thought She had that curious beauty of body though that made her
somewhat like a figure on an antique vase or out of a Greek chorus It
was in this light unquestionably that Cowperwood saw her for from the
beginning he could not keep his eyes off her In a way she was aware
of this but she did not attach any significance to it Thoroughly
conventional satisfied now that her life was bound permanently
with that of her husband she had settled down to a staid and quiet
existence

At first when Frank called she did not have much to say She was
gracious but the burden of conversation fell on her husband Cowperwood
watched the varying expression of her face from time to time and if she
had been at all psychic she must have felt something Fortunately she
was not Semple talked to him pleasantly because in the first place
Frank was becoming financially significant was suave and ingratiating
and in the next place he was anxious to get richer and somehow Frank
represented progress to him in that line One spring evening they sat on
the porch and talkednothing very importantslavery streetcars the
panicit was on then that of 1857the development of the West Mr
Semple wanted to know all about the stock exchange In return Frank
asked about the shoe business though he really did not care All the
while inoffensively he watched Mrs Semple Her manner he thought
was soothing attractive delightful She served tea and cake for them
They went inside after a time to avoid the mosquitoes She played the
piano At ten oclock he left

Thereafter for a year or so Cowperwood bought his shoes of Mr Semple
Occasionally also he stopped in the Chestnut Street store to exchange
the time of the day Semple asked his opinion as to the advisability
of buying some shares in the Fifth and Sixth Street line which having
secured a franchise was creating great excitement Cowperwood gave
him his best judgment It was sure to be profitable He himself had
purchased one hundred shares at five dollars a share and urged Semple
to do so But he was not interested in him personally He liked Mrs
Semple though he did not see her very often

About a year later Mr Semple died It was an untimely death one
of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are
nevertheless dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned He was
seized with a cold in the chest late in the fallone of those seizures
ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without
an overcoatand had insisted on going to business when Mrs Semple
urged him to stay at home and recuperate He was in his way a very
determined person not obstreperously so but quietly and under the
surface Business was a great urge He saw himself soon to be worth
about fifty thousand dollars Then this coldnine more days of
pneumoniaand he was dead The shoe store was closed for a few days
the house was full of sympathetic friends and church people There was
a funeral with burial service in the Callowhill Presbyterian Church to
which they belonged and then he was buried Mrs Semple cried bitterly
The shock of death affected her greatly and left her for a time in a
depressed state A brother of hers David Wiggin undertook for the time
being to run the shoe business for her There was no will but in the
final adjustment which included the sale of the shoe business there
being no desire on anybodys part to contest her right to all the
property she received over eighteen thousand dollars She continued
to reside in the Front Street house and was considered a charming and
interesting widow

Throughout this procedure young Cowperwood only twenty years of age
was quietly manifest He called during the illness He attended the
funeral He helped her brother David Wiggin dispose of the shoe
business He called once or twice after the funeral then stayed away
for a considerable time In five months he reappeared and thereafter he
was a caller at stated intervalsperiods of a week or ten days

Again it would be hard to say what he saw in Semple Her prettiness
waxlike in its quality fascinated him her indifference aroused
perhaps his combative soul He could not have explained why but he
wanted her in an urgent passionate way He could not think of her
reasonably and he did not talk of her much to any one His family knew
that he went to see her but there had grown up in the Cowperwood family
a deep respect for the mental force of Frank He was genial cheerful
gay at most times without being talkative and he was decidedly
successful Everybody knew he was making money now His salary was fifty
dollars a week and he was certain soon to get more Some lots of his in
West Philadelphia bought three years before had increased notably in
value His streetcar holdings augmented by still additional lots of
fifty and one hundred and one hundred and fifty shares in new lines
incorporated were slowly rising in spite of hard times from the
initiative five dollars in each case to ten fifteen and twentyfive
dollars a shareall destined to go to par He was liked in the
financial district and he was sure that he had a successful future
Because of his analysis of the brokerage situation he had come to the
conclusion that he did not want to be a stock gambler Instead he was
considering the matter of engaging in billbrokering a business which
he had observed to be very profitable and which involved no risk as long
as one had capital Through his work and his fathers connections he
had met many peoplemerchants bankers traders He could get their
business or a part of it he knew People in Drexel  Co and Clark 
Co were friendly to him Jay Cooke a rising banking personality was a
personal friend of his

Meanwhile he called on Mrs Semple and the more he called the better he
liked her There was no exchange of brilliant ideas between them but he
had a way of being comforting and social when he wished He advised
her about her business affairs in so intelligent a way that even her
relatives approved of it She came to like him because he was so
considerate quiet reassuring and so ready to explain over and over
until everything was quite plain to her She could see that he was
looking on her affairs quite as if they were his own trying to make
them safe and secure

Youre so very kind Frank she said to him one night Im awfully
grateful I dont know what I would have done if it hadnt been for
you

She looked at his handsome face which was turned to hers with
childlike simplicity

Not at all Not at all I want to do it I wouldnt have been happy if
I couldnt

His eyes had a peculiar subtle ray in themnot a gleam She felt warm
toward him sympathetic quite satisfied that she could lean on him

Well I am very grateful just the same Youve been so good Come out
Sunday again if you want to or any evening Ill be home

It was while he was calling on her in this way that his Uncle Seneca
died in Cuba and left him fifteen thousand dollars This money made him
worth nearly twentyfive thousand dollars in his own right and he knew
exactly what to do with it A panic had come since Mr Semple had died
which had illustrated to him very clearly what an uncertain thing the
brokerage business was There was really a severe business depression
Money was so scarce that it could fairly be said not to exist at all
Capital frightened by uncertain trade and money conditions everywhere
retired to its hidingplaces in banks vaults teakettles and
stockings The country seemed to be going to the dogs War with the
South or secession was vaguely looming up in the distance The temper of
the whole nation was nervous People dumped their holdings on the market
in order to get money Tighe discharged three of his clerks He cut down
his expenses in every possible way and used up all his private savings
to protect his private holdings He mortgaged his house his land
holdingseverything and in many instances young Cowperwood was his
intermediary carrying blocks of shares to different banks to get what
he could on them

See if your fathers bank wont loan me fifteen thousand on these he
said to Frank one day producing a bundle of Philadelphia  Wilmington
shares Frank had heard his father speak of them in times past as
excellent

They ought to be good the elder Cowperwood said dubiously when
shown the package of securities At any other time they would be But
money is so tight We find it awfully hard these days to meet our own
obligations Ill talk to Mr Kugel Mr Kugel was the president

There was a long conversationa long wait His father came back to say
it was doubtful whether they could make the loan Eight per cent then
being secured for money was a small rate of interest considering its
need For ten per cent Mr Kugel might make a callloan Frank went
back to his employer whose commercial choler rose at the report

For Heavens sake is there no money at all in the town he demanded
contentiously Why the interest they want is ruinous I cant stand
that Well take em back and bring me the money Good God thisll
never do at all at all

Frank went back Hell pay ten per cent he said quietly

Tighe was credited with a deposit of fifteen thousand dollars with
privilege to draw against it at once He made out a check for the
total fifteen thousand at once to the Girard National Bank to cover a
shrinkage there So it went

During all these days young Cowperwood was following these financial
complications with interest He was not disturbed by the cause of
slavery or the talk of secession or the general progress or decline of
the country except in so far as it affected his immediate interests He
longed to become a stable financier but now that he saw the inside of
the brokerage business he was not so sure that he wanted to stay in
it Gambling in stocks according to conditions produced by this panic
seemed very hazardous A number of brokers failed He saw them rush in
to Tighe with anguished faces and ask that certain trades be canceled
Their very homes were in danger they said They would be wiped out
their wives and children put out on the street

This panic incidentally only made Frank more certain as to what he
really wanted to donow that he had this free money he would go into
business for himself Even Tighes offer of a minor partnership failed
to tempt him

I think you have a nice business he explained in refusing but I
want to get in the notebrokerage business for myself I dont trust
this stock game Id rather have a little business of my own than all
the floor work in this world

But youre pretty young Frank argued his employer You have lots of
time to work for yourself In the end he parted friends with both Tighe
and Rivers Thats a smart young fellow observed Tighe ruefully

Hell make his mark rejoined Rivers Hes the shrewdest boy of his
age I ever saw





Chapter VIII


Cowperwoods world at this time was of roseate hue He was in love and
had money of his own to start his new business venture He could take
his streetcar stocks which were steadily increasing in value and
raise seventy per cent of their market value He could put a mortgage
on his lots and get money there if necessary He had established
financial relations with the Girard National BankPresident Davison
there having taken a fancy to himand he proposed to borrow from that
institution some day All he wanted was suitable investmentsthings in
which he could realize surely quickly He saw fine prospective profits
in the streetcar lines which were rapidly developing into local
ramifications

He purchased a horse and buggy about this timethe most
attractivelooking animal and vehicle he could findthe combination
cost him five hundred dollarsand invited Mrs Semple to drive with
him She refused at first but later consented He had told her of his
success his prospects his windfall of fifteen thousand dollars his
intention of going into the notebrokerage business She knew his father
was likely to succeed to the position of vicepresident in the Third
National Bank and she liked the Cowperwoods Now she began to realize
that there was something more than mere friendship here This erstwhile
boy was a man and he was calling on her It was almost ridiculous in
the face of thingsher seniority her widowhood her placid retiring
dispositionbut the sheer quiet determined force of this young man
made it plain that he was not to be balked by her sense of convention

Cowperwood did not delude himself with any noble theories of conduct in
regard to her She was beautiful with a mental and physical lure for
him that was irresistible and that was all he desired to know No other
woman was holding him like that It never occurred to him that he could
not or should not like other women at the same time There was a great
deal of palaver about the sanctity of the home It rolled off his mental
sphere like water off the feathers of a duck He was not eager for her
money though he was well aware of it He felt that he could use it
to her advantage He wanted her physically He felt a keen primitive
interest in the children they would have He wanted to find out if he
could make her love him vigorously and could rout out the memory of her
former life Strange ambition Strange perversion one might almost say

In spite of her fears and her uncertainty Lillian Semple accepted his
attentions and interest because equally in spite of herself she was
drawn to him One night when she was going to bed she stopped in front
of her dressing table and looked at her face and her bare neck and arms
They were very pretty A subtle something came over her as she surveyed
her long peculiarly shaded hair She thought of young Cowperwood and
then was chilled and shamed by the vision of the late Mr Semple and the
force and quality of public opinion

Why do you come to see me so often she asked him when he called the
following evening

Oh dont you know he replied looking at her in an interpretive way

No

Sure you dont

Well I know you liked Mr Semple and I always thought you liked me as
his wife Hes gone though now

And youre here he replied

And Im here

Yes I like you I like to be with you Dont you like me that way

Why Ive never thought of it Youre so much younger Im five years
older than you are

In years he said certainly Thats nothing Im fifteen years older
than you are in other ways I know more about life in some ways than
you can ever hope to learndont you think so he added softly
persuasively

Well thats true But I know a lot of things you dont know She
laughed softly showing her pretty teeth

It was evening They were on the side porch The river was before them

Yes but thats only because youre a woman A man cant hope to get a
womans point of view exactly But Im talking about practical affairs
of this world Youre not as old that way as I am

Well what of it

Nothing You asked why I came to see you Thats why Partly

He relapsed into silence and stared at the water

She looked at him His handsome body slowly broadening was nearly full
grown His face because of its full clear big inscrutable eyes had
an expression which was almost babyish She could not have guessed the
depths it veiled His cheeks were pink his hands not large but sinewy
and strong Her pale uncertain lymphatic body extracted a form of
dynamic energy from him even at this range

I dont think you ought to come to see me so often People wont think
well of it She ventured to take a distant matronly airthe air she
had originally held toward him

People he said dont worry about people People think what you want
them to think I wish you wouldnt take that distant air toward me

Why

Because I like you

But you mustnt like me Its wrong I cant ever marry you Youre too
young Im too old

Dont say that he said imperiously Theres nothing to it I want
you to marry me You know I do Now when will it be

Why how silly I never heard of such a thing she exclaimed It will
never be Frank It cant be

Why cant it he asked

Becausewell because Im older People would think it strange Im
not long enough free

Oh long enough nothing he exclaimed irritably Thats the one
thing I have against youyou are so worried about what people think
They dont make your life They certainly dont make mine Think of
yourself first You have your own life to make Are you going to let
what other people think stand in the way of what you want to do

But I dont want to she smiled

He arose and came over to her looking into her eyes

Well she asked nervously quizzically

He merely looked at her

Well she queried more flustered

He stooped down to take her arms but she got up

Now you must not come near me she pleaded determinedly Ill go
in the house and Ill not let you come any more Its terrible Youre
silly You mustnt interest yourself in me

She did show a good deal of determination and he desisted But for the
time being only He called again and again Then one night when they
had gone inside because of the mosquitoes and when she had insisted
that he must stop coming to see her that his attentions were noticeable
to others and that she would be disgraced he caught her under
desperate protest in his arms

Now see here she exclaimed I told you Its silly You mustnt
kiss me How dare you Oh oh oh

She broke away and ran up the nearby stairway to her room Cowperwood
followed her swiftly As she pushed the door to he forced it open
and recaptured her He lifted her bodily from her feet and held her
crosswise lying in his arms

Oh how could you she exclaimed I will never speak to you any more
I will never let you come here any more if you dont put me down this
minute Put me down

Ill put you down sweet he said Ill take you down at the same
time pulling her face to him and kissing her He was very much aroused
excited

While she was twisting and protesting he carried her down the stairs
again into the livingroom and seated himself in the great armchair
still holding her tight in his arms

Oh she sighed falling limp on his shoulder when he refused to let
her go Then because of the set determination of his face some intense
pull in him she smiled How would I ever explain if I did marry you
she asked weakly Your father Your mother

You dont need to explain Ill do that And you neednt worry about my
family They wont care

But mine she recoiled

Dont worry about yours Im not marrying your family Im marrying
you We have independent means

She relapsed into additional protests but he kissed her the more There
was a deadly persuasion to his caresses Mr Semple had never displayed
any such fire He aroused a force of feeling in her which had not
previously been there She was afraid of it and ashamed

Will you marry me in a month he asked cheerfully when she paused

You know I wont she exclaimed nervously The idea Why do you
ask

What difference does it make Were going to get married eventually
He was thinking how attractive he could make her look in other
surroundings Neither she nor his family knew how to live

Well not in a month Wait a little while I will marry you after a
whileafter you see whether you want me

He caught her tight Ill show you he said

Please stop You hurt me

How about it Two months

Certainly not

Three

Well maybe

No maybe in that case We marry

But youre only a boy

Dont worry about me Youll find out how much of a boy I am

He seemed of a sudden to open up a new world to her and she realized
that she had never really lived before This man represented something
bigger and stronger than ever her husband had dreamed of In his young
way he was terrible irresistible

Well in three months then she whispered while he rocked her cozily
in his arms





Chapter IX


Cowperwood started in the note brokerage business with a small office
at No 64 South Third Street where he very soon had the pleasure of
discovering that his former excellent business connections remembered
him He would go to one house where he suspected ready money might be
desirable and offer to negotiate their notes or any paper they might
issue bearing six per cent interest for a commission and then he would
sell the paper for a small commission to some one who would welcome a
secure investment Sometimes his father sometimes other people helped
him with suggestions as to when and how Between the two ends he might
make four and five per cent on the total transaction In the first year
he cleared six thousand dollars over and above all expenses That wasnt
much but he was augmenting it in another way which he believed would
bring great profit in the future

Before the first streetcar line which was a shambling affair had been
laid on Front Street the streets of Philadelphia had been crowded
with hundreds of springless omnibuses rattling over rough hard
cobblestones Now thanks to the idea of John Stephenson in New York
the double rail track idea had come and besides the line on Fifth and
Sixth Streets the cars running out one street and back on another
which had paid splendidly from the start there were many other lines
proposed or under way The city was as eager to see streetcars
replace omnibuses as it was to see railroads replace canals There
was opposition of course There always is in such cases The cry of
probable monopoly was raised Disgruntled and defeated omnibus owners
and drivers groaned aloud

Cowperwood had implicit faith in the future of the street railway In
support of this belief he risked all he could spare on new issues of
stock shares in new companies He wanted to be on the inside wherever
possible always though this was a little difficult in the matter of
the streetrailways he having been so young when they started and not
having yet arranged his financial connections to make them count for
much The Fifth and Sixth Street line which had been but recently
started was paying six hundred dollars a day A project for a West
Philadelphia line Walnut and Chestnut was on foot as were lines to
occupy Second and Third Streets Race and Vine Spruce and Pine Green
and Coates Tenth and Eleventh and so forth They were engineered and
backed by some powerful capitalists who had influence with the State
legislature and could in spite of great public protest obtain
franchises Charges of corruption were in the air It was argued that
the streets were valuable and that the companies should pay a road tax
of a thousand dollars a mile Somehow however these splendid grants
were gotten through and the public hearing of the Fifth and Sixth
Street line profits was eager to invest Cowperwood was one of these
and when the Second and Third Street line was engineered he invested in
that and in the Walnut and Chestnut Street line also He began to have
vague dreams of controlling a line himself some day but as yet he did
not see exactly how it was to be done since his business was far from
being a bonanza

In the midst of this early work he married Mrs Semple There was no
vast todo about it as he did not want any and his bridetobe was
nervous fearsome of public opinion His family did not entirely
approve She was too old his mother and father thought and then Frank
with his prospects could have done much better His sister Anna fancied
that Mrs Semple was designing which was of course not true His
brothers Joseph and Edward were interested but not certain as to what
they actually thought since Mrs Semple was goodlooking and had some
money

It was a warm October day when he and Lillian went to the altar in the
First Presbyterian Church of Callowhill Street His bride Frank was
satisfied looked exquisite in a trailing gown of cream lacea creation
that had cost months of labor His parents Mrs Seneca Davis the
Wiggin family brothers and sisters and some friends were present He
was a little opposed to this idea but Lillian wanted it He stood
up straight and correct in black broadcloth for the wedding
ceremonybecause she wished it but later changed to a smart business
suit for traveling He had arranged his affairs for a two weeks trip
to New York and Boston They took an afternoon train for New York which
required five hours to reach When they were finally alone in the Astor
House New York after hours of makebelieve and public pretense of
indifference he gathered her in his arms

Oh its delicious he exclaimed to have you all to myself

She met his eagerness with that smiling tantalizing passivity which
he had so much admired but which this time was tinged strongly with a
communicated desire He thought he should never have enough of her her
beautiful face her lovely arms her smooth lymphatic body They were
like two children billing and cooing driving dining seeing the
sights He was curious to visit the financial sections of both cities
New York and Boston appealed to him as commercially solid He wondered
as he observed the former whether he should ever leave Philadelphia
He was going to be very happy there now he thought with Lillian and
possibly a brood of young Cowperwoods He was going to work hard and
make money With his means and hers now at his command he might become
very readily notably wealthy





Chapter X


The home atmosphere which they established when they returned from
their honeymoon was a great improvement in taste over that which had
characterized the earlier life of Mrs Cowperwood as Mrs Semple They
had decided to occupy her house on North Front Street for a while at
least Cowperwood aggressive in his current artistic mood had objected
at once after they were engaged to the spirit of the furniture and
decorations or lack of them and had suggested that he be allowed to
have it brought more in keeping with his idea of what was appropriate
During the years in which he had been growing into manhood he had come
instinctively into sound notions of what was artistic and refined He
had seen so many homes that were more distinguished and harmonious than
his own One could not walk or drive about Philadelphia without seeing
and being impressed with the general tendency toward a more cultivated
and selective social life Many excellent and expensive houses were
being erected The front lawn with some attempt at floral gardening
was achieving local popularity In the homes of the Tighes the
Leighs Arthur Rivers and others he had noticed art objects of some
distinctionbronzes marbles hangings pictures clocks rugs

It seemed to him now that his comparatively commonplace house could be
made into something charming and for comparatively little money The
diningroom for instance which through two plain windows set in a hat
side wall back of the veranda looked south over a stretch of grass and
several trees and bushes to a dividing fence where the Semple property
ended and a neighbors began could be made so much more attractive
That fencesharppointed gray palingscould be torn away and a hedge
put in its place The wall which divided the diningroom from the parlor
could be knocked through and a hanging of some pleasing character put in
its place A baywindow could be built to replace the two present oblong
windowsa bay which would come down to the floor and open out on the
lawn via swiveled diamondshaped leadpaned frames All this shabby
nondescript furniture collected from heaven knows wherepartly
inherited from the Semples and the Wiggins and partly boughtcould be
thrown out or sold and something better and more harmonious introduced
He knew a young man by the name of Ellsworth an architect newly
graduated from a local school with whom he had struck up an interesting
friendshipone of those inexplicable inclinations of temperament
Wilton Ellsworth was an artist in spirit quiet meditative refined
From discussing the quality of a certain building on Chestnut Street
which was then being erected and which Ellsworth pronounced atrocious
they had fallen to discussing art in general or the lack of it in
America And it occurred to him that Ellsworth was the man to carry out
his decorative views to a nicety When he suggested the young man to
Lillian she placidly agreed with him and also with his own ideas of how
the house could be revised

So while they were gone on their honeymoon Ellsworth began the revision
on an estimated cost of three thousand dollars including the furniture
It was not completed for nearly three weeks after their return but when
finished made a comparatively new house The diningroom bay hung low
over the grass as Frank wished and the windows were diamondpaned
and leaded swiveled on brass rods The parlor and diningroom were
separated by sliding doors but the intention was to hang in this
opening a silk hanging depicting a wedding scene in Normandy Old
English oak was used in the diningroom an American imitation of
Chippendale and Sheraton for the sittingroom and the bedrooms There
were a few simple watercolors hung here and there some bronzes of
Hosmer and Powers a marble venus by Potter a now forgotten sculptor
and other objects of artnothing of any distinction Pleasing
appropriately colored rugs covered the floor Mrs Cowperwood was
shocked by the nudity of the Venus which conveyed an atmosphere of
European freedom not common to America but she said nothing It was all
harmonious and soothing and she did not feel herself capable to judge
Frank knew about these things so much better than she did Then with
a maid and a man of all work installed a program of entertaining was
begun on a small scale

Those who recall the early years of their married life can best realize
the subtle changes which this new condition brought to Frank for like
all who accept the hymeneal yoke he was influenced to a certain extent
by the things with which he surrounded himself Primarily from certain
traits of his character one would have imagined him called to be a
citizen of eminent respectability and worth He appeared to be an ideal
home man He delighted to return to his wife in the evenings leaving
the crowded downtown section where traffic clamored and men hurried
Here he could feel that he was wellstationed and physically happy in
life The thought of the dinnertable with candles upon it his idea
the thought of Lillian in a trailing gown of paleblue or green silkhe
liked her in those colors the thought of a large fireplace flaming with
solid lengths of cordwood and Lillian snuggling in his arms gripped
his immature imagination As has been said before he cared nothing for
books but life pictures trees physical contactthese in spite of
his shrewd and already gripping financial calculations held him To
live richly joyously fullyhis whole nature craved that

And Mrs Cowperwood in spite of the difference in their years appeared
to be a fit mate for him at this time She was once awakened and for
the time being clinging responsive dreamy His mood and hers was for
a baby and in a little while that happy expectation was whispered to
him by her She had half fancied that her previous barrenness was due to
herself and was rather surprised and delighted at the proof that it
was not so It opened new possibilitiesa seemingly glorious future of
which she was not afraid He liked it the idea of selfduplication It
was almost acquisitive this thought For days and weeks and months and
years at least the first four or five he took a keen satisfaction in
coming home evenings strolling about the yard driving with his wife
having friends in to dinner talking over with her in an explanatory
way the things he intended to do She did not understand his financial
abstrusities and he did not trouble to make them clear

But love her pretty body her lips her quiet mannerthe lure of
all these combined and his two children when they cametwo in four
yearsheld him He would dandle Frank Jr who was the first to
arrive on his knee looking at his chubby feet his kindling eyes his
almost formless yet budlike mouth and wonder at the process by which
children came into the world There was so much to think of in this
connectionthe spermatozoic beginning the strange period of gestation
in women the danger of disease and delivery He had gone through a
real period of strain when Frank Jr was born for Mrs Cowperwood
was frightened He feared for the beauty of her bodytroubled over the
danger of losing her and he actually endured his first worry when he
stood outside the door the day the child came Not muchhe was too
selfsufficient too resourceful and yet he worried conjuring up
thoughts of death and the end of their present state Then word came
after certain piercing harrowing cries that all was well and he
was permitted to look at the new arrival The experience broadened his
conception of things made him more solid in his judgment of life That
old conviction of tragedy underlying the surface of things like wood
under its veneer was emphasized Little Frank and later Lillian
blueeyed and goldenhaired touched his imagination for a while There
was a good deal to this home idea after all That was the way life was
organized and properly soits cornerstone was the home

It would be impossible to indicate fully how subtle were the material
changes which these years involvedchanges so gradual that they were
like the lap of soft waters unnoticeable Considerablea great deal
considering how little he had to begin withwealth was added in
the next five years He came in his financial world to know fairly
intimately as commercial relationships go some of the subtlest
characters of the steadily enlarging financial world In his days at
Tighes and on the exchange many curious figures had been pointed
out to himState and city officials of one grade and another who were
making something out of politics and some national figures who came
from Washington to Philadelphia at times to see Drexel  Co Clark 
Co and even Tighe  Co These men as he learned had tips or advance
news of legislative or economic changes which were sure to affect
certain stocks or trade opportunities A young clerk had once pulled his
sleeve at Tighes

See that man going in to see Tighe

Yes

Thats Murtagh the city treasurer Say he dont do anything but play
a fine game All that money to invest and he dont have to account for
anything except the principal The interest goes to him

Cowperwood understood All these city and State officials speculated
They had a habit of depositing city and State funds with certain bankers
and brokers as authorized agents or designated State depositories The
banks paid no interestsave to the officials personally They loaned
it to certain brokers on the officials secret order and the latter
invested it in sure winners The bankers got the free use of the money
a part of the time the brokers another part the officials made money
and the brokers received a fat commission There was a political ring
in Philadelphia in which the mayor certain members of the council the
treasurer the chief of police the commissioner of public works and
others shared It was a case generally of You scratch my back and Ill
scratch yours Cowperwood thought it rather shabby work at first
but many men were rapidly getting rich and no one seemed to care The
newspapers were always talking about civic patriotism and pride but
never a word about these things And the men who did them were powerful
and respected

There were many houses a constantly widening circle that found him a
very trustworthy agent in disposing of note issues or note payment He
seemed to know so quickly where to go to get the money From the first
he made it a principle to keep twenty thousand dollars in cash on hand
in order to be able to take up a proposition instantly and without
discussion So often he was able to say Why certainly I can do
that when otherwise on the face of things he would not have been
able to do so He was asked if he would not handle certain stock
transactions on change He had no seat and he intended not to take
any at first but now he changed his mind and bought one not only
in Philadelphia but in New York also A certain Joseph Zimmerman a
drygoods man for whom he had handled various note issues suggested
that he undertake operating in streetrailway shares for him and this
was the beginning of his return to the floor

In the meanwhile his family life was changinggrowing one might have
said finer and more secure Mrs Cowperwood had for instance been
compelled from time to time to make a subtle readjustment of her
personal relationship with people as he had with his When Mr
Semple was alive she had been socially connected with tradesmen
principallyretailers and small wholesalersa very few Some of the
women of her own church the First Presbyterian were friendly with
her There had been church teas and sociables which she and Mr Semple
attended and dull visits to his relatives and hers The Cowperwoods
the Watermans and a few families of that caliber had been the notable
exceptions Now all this was changed Young Cowperwood did not care
very much for her relatives and the Semples had been alienated by her
second and to them outrageous marriage His own family was closely
interested by ties of affection and mutual prosperity but better than
this he was drawing to himself some really significant personalities
He brought home with him sociallynot to talk business for he
disliked that ideabankers investors customers and prospective
customers Out on the Schuylkill the Wissahickon and elsewhere were
popular dining places where one could drive on Sunday He and Mrs
Cowperwood frequently drove out to Mrs Seneca Daviss to Judge
Kitchens to the home of Andrew Sharpless a lawyer whom he knew to
the home of Harper Steger his own lawyer and others Cowperwood had
the gift of geniality None of these men or women suspected the depth of
his naturehe was thinking thinking thinking but enjoyed life as he
went

One of his earliest and most genuine leanings was toward paintings He
admired nature but somehow without knowing why he fancied one could
best grasp it through the personality of some interpreter just as we
gain our ideas of law and politics through individuals Mrs Cowperwood
cared not a whit one way or another but she accompanied him to
exhibitions thinking all the while that Frank was a little peculiar
He tried because he loved her to interest her in these things
intelligently but while she pretended slightly she could not really
see or care and it was very plain that she could not

The children took up a great deal of her time However Cowperwood was
not troubled about this It struck him as delightful and exceedingly
worth while that she should be so devoted At the same time her
lethargic manner vague smile and her sometimes seeming indifference
which sprang largely from a sense of absolute security attracted him
also She was so different from him She took her second marriage quite
as she had taken her firsta solemn fact which contained no possibility
of mental alteration As for himself however he was bustling about in
a world which financially at least seemed all alterationthere were
so many sudden and almost unheardof changes He began to look at her
at times with a speculative eyenot very critically for he liked
herbut with an attempt to weigh her personality He had known her
five years and more now What did he know about her The vigor of
youththose first yearshad made up for so many things but now that
he had her safely

There came in this period the slow approach and finally the
declaration of war between the North and the South attended with so
much excitement that almost all current minds were notably colored by
it It was terrific Then came meetings public and stirring and riots
the incident of John Browns body the arrival of Lincoln the great
commoner on his way from Springfield Illinois to Washington via
Philadelphia to take the oath of office the battle of Bull Run the
battle of Vicksburg the battle of Gettysburg and so on Cowperwood was
only twentyfive at the time a cool determined youth who thought the
slave agitation might be well founded in human rightsno doubt wasbut
exceedingly dangerous to trade He hoped the North would win but it
might go hard with him personally and other financiers He did not
care to fight That seemed silly for the individual man to do Others
mightthere were many poor thinminded halfbaked creatures who would
put themselves up to be shot but they were only fit to be commanded or
shot down As for him his life was sacred to himself and his family and
his personal interests He recalled seeing one day in one of the quiet
side streets as the workingmen were coming home from their work a
small enlisting squad of soldiers in blue marching enthusiastically
along the Union flag flying the drummers drumming the fifes blowing
the idea being of course to so impress the hitherto indifferent or
wavering citizen to exalt him to such a pitch that he would lose
his sense of proportion of selfinterest and forgetting allwife
parents home and childrenand seeing only the great need of the
country fall in behind and enlist He saw one workingman swinging his
pail and evidently not contemplating any such denouement to his days
work pause listen as the squad approached hesitate as it drew close
and as it passed with a peculiar look of uncertainty or wonder in his
eyes fall in behind and march solemnly away to the enlisting quarters
What was it that had caught this man Frank asked himself How was he
overcome so easily He had not intended to go His face was streaked
with the grease and dirt of his workhe looked like a foundry man or
machinist say twentyfive years of age Frank watched the little squad
disappear at the end of the street round the corner under the trees

This current warspirit was strange The people seemed to him to want
to hear nothing but the sound of the drum and fife to see nothing but
troops of which there were thousands now passing through on their
way to the front carrying cold steel in the shape of guns at their
shoulders to hear of war and the rumors of war It was a thrilling
sentiment no doubt great but unprofitable It meant selfsacrifice
and he could not see that If he went he might be shot and what would
his noble emotion amount to then He would rather make money regulate
current political social and financial affairs The poor fool who
fell in behind the enlisting squadno not fool he would not call him
thatthe poor overwrought workingmanwell Heaven pity him Heaven
pity all of them They really did not know what they were doing

One day he saw Lincolna tall shambling man long bony gawky but
tremendously impressive It was a raw slushy morning of a late February
day and the great war President was just through with his solemn
pronunciamento in regard to the bonds that might have been strained but
must not be broken As he issued from the doorway of Independence Hall
that famous birthplace of liberty his face was set in a sad meditative
calm Cowperwood looked at him fixedly as he issued from the doorway
surrounded by chiefs of staff local dignitaries detectives and the
curious sympathetic faces of the public As he studied the strangely
roughhewn countenance a sense of the great worth and dignity of the man
came over him

A real man that he thought a wonderful temperament His every
gesture came upon him with great force He watched him enter his
carriage thinking So that is the railsplitter the country lawyer
Well fate has picked a great man for this crisis

For days the face of Lincoln haunted him and very often during the
war his mind reverted to that singular figure It seemed to him
unquestionable that fortuitously he had been permitted to look upon one
of the worlds really great men War and statesmanship were not for him
but he knew how important those things wereat times





Chapter XI


It was while the war was on and after it was perfectly plain that it
was not to be of a few days duration that Cowperwoods first great
financial opportunity came to him There was a strong demand for money
at the time on the part of the nation the State and the city In July
1861 Congress had authorized a loan of fifty million dollars to be
secured by twentyyear bonds with interest not to exceed seven per
cent and the State authorized a loan of three millions on much the
same security the first being handled by financiers of Boston New
York and Philadelphia the second by Philadelphia financiers alone
Cowperwood had no hand in this He was not big enough He read in the
papers of gatherings of men whom he knew personally or by reputation
to consider the best way to aid the nation or the State but he was
not included And yet his soul yearned to be of them He noticed
how often a rich mans word sufficedno money no certificates no
collateral no anythingjust his word If Drexel  Co or Jay Cooke 
Co or Gould  Fiske were rumored to be behind anything how secure
it was Jay Cooke a young man in Philadelphia had made a great strike
taking this State loan in company with Drexel  Co and selling it at
par The general opinion was that it ought to be and could only be sold
at ninety Cooke did not believe this He believed that State pride
and State patriotism would warrant offering the loan to small banks
and private citizens and that they would subscribe it fully and more
Events justified Cooke magnificently and his public reputation was
assured Cowperwood wished he could make some such strike but he was
too practical to worry over anything save the facts and conditions that
were before him

His chance came about six months later when it was found that the State
would have to have much more money Its quota of troops would have to
be equipped and paid There were measures of defense to be taken the
treasury to be replenished A call for a loan of twentythree million
dollars was finally authorized by the legislature and issued There was
great talk in the street as to who was to handle itDrexel  Co and
Jay Cooke  Co of course

Cowperwood pondered over this If he could handle a fraction of this
great loan nowhe could not possibly handle the whole of it for he
had not the necessary connectionshe could add considerably to his
reputation as a broker while making a tidy sum How much could he
handle That was the question Who would take portions of it His
fathers bank Probably Waterman  Co A little Judge Kitchen A
small fraction The MillsDavid Company Yes He thought of different
individuals and concerns who for one reason and anotherpersonal
friendship goodnature gratitude for past favors and so onwould
take a percentage of the sevenpercent bonds through him He totaled up
his possibilities and discovered that in all likelihood with a little
preliminary missionary work he could dispose of one million dollars if
personal influence through local political figures could bring this
much of the loan his way

One man in particular had grown strong in his estimation as having some
subtle political connection not visible on the surface and this
was Edward Malia Butler Butler was a contractor undertaking the
construction of sewers watermains foundations for buildings
streetpaving and the like In the early days long before Cowperwood
had known him he had been a garbagecontractor on his own account The
city at that time had no extended streetcleaning service particularly
in its outlying sections and some of the older poorer regions Edward
Butler then a poor young Irishman had begun by collecting and hauling
away the garbage free of charge and feeding it to his pigs and cattle
Later he discovered that some people were willing to pay a small charge
for this service Then a local political character a councilman friend
of histhey were both Catholicssaw a new point in the whole thing
Butler could be made official garbagecollector The council could
vote an annual appropriation for this service Butler could employ more
wagons than he did nowdozens of them scores Not only that but no
other garbagecollector would be allowed There were others but the
official contract awarded him would also officially be the end of
the life of any and every disturbing rival A certain amount of the
profitable proceeds would have to be set aside to assuage the feelings
of those who were not contractors Funds would have to be loaned at
election time to certain individuals and organizationsbut no matter
The amount would be small So Butler and Patrick Gavin Comiskey the
councilman the latter silently entered into business relations Butler
gave up driving a wagon himself He hired a young man a smart Irish boy
of his neighborhood Jimmy Sheehan to be his assistant superintendent
stableman bookkeeper and what not Since he soon began to make between
four and five thousand a year where before he made two thousand he
moved into a brick house in an outlying section of the south side and
sent his children to school Mrs Butler gave up making soap and feeding
pigs And since then times had been exceedingly good with Edward Butler

He could neither read nor write at first but now he knew how of
course He had learned from association with Mr Comiskey that there
were other forms of contractingsewers watermains gasmains
streetpaving and the like Who better than Edward Butler to do it
He knew the councilmen many of them Het met them in the back rooms
of saloons on Sundays and Saturdays at political picnics at election
councils and conferences for as a beneficiary of the citys largess he
was expected to contribute not only money but advice Curiously he
had developed a strange political wisdom He knew a successful man or a
coming man when he saw one So many of his bookkeepers superintendents
timekeepers had graduated into councilmen and state legislators His
nomineessuggested to political conferenceswere so often known to
make good First he came to have influence in his councilmans ward
then in his legislative district then in the city councils of
his partyWhig of courseand then he was supposed to have an
organization

Mysterious forces worked for him in council He was awarded significant
contracts and he always bid The garbage business was now a thing of
the past His eldest boy Owen was a member of the State legislature
and a partner in his business affairs His second son Callum was a
clerk in the city water department and an assistant to his father also
Aileen his eldest daughter fifteen years of age was still in St
Agathas a convent school in Germantown Norah his second daughter and
youngest child thirteen years old was in attendance at a local private
school conducted by a Catholic sisterhood The Butler family had
moved away from South Philadelphia into Girard Avenue near the twelve
hundreds where a new and rather interesting social life was beginning
They were not of it but Edward Butler contractor now fiftyfive years
of age worth say five hundred thousand dollars had many political
and financial friends No longer a rough neck but a solid
reddishfaced man slightly tanned with broad shoulders and a solid
chest gray eyes gray hair a typically Irish face made wise and calm
and undecipherable by much experience His big hands and feet indicated
a day when he had not worn the best English cloth suits and tanned
leather but his presence was not in any way offensiverather the
other way about Though still possessed of a brogue he was softspoken
winning and persuasive

He had been one of the first to become interested in the development of
the streetcar system and had come to the conclusion as had Cowperwood
and many others that it was going to be a great thing The money
returns on the stocks or shares he had been induced to buy had been
ample evidence of that He had dealt through one broker and another
having failed to get in on the original corporate organizations
He wanted to pick up such stock as he could in one organization and
another for he believed they all had a future and most of all he
wanted to get control of a line or two In connection with this idea he
was looking for some reliable young man honest and capable who
would work under his direction and do what he said Then he learned of
Cowperwood and one day sent for him and asked him to call at his house

Cowperwood responded quickly for he knew of Butler his rise his
connections his force He called at the house as directed one cold
crisp February morning He remembered the appearance of the street
afterwardbroad brickpaved sidewalks macadamized roadway powdered
over with a light snow and set with young leafless scrubby trees
and lampposts Butlers house was not newhe had bought and repaired
itbut it was not an unsatisfactory specimen of the architecture of the
time It was fifty feet wide four stories tall of graystone and with
four wide white stone steps leading up to the door The window arches
framed in white had Ushaped keystones There were curtains of lace and
a glimpse of red plush through the windows which gleamed warm against
the cold and snow outside A trim Irish maid came to the door and he
gave her his card and was invited into the house

Is Mr Butler home

Im not sure sir Ill find out He may have gone out

In a little while he was asked to come upstairs where he found Butler
in a somewhat commerciallooking room It had a desk an office chair
some leather furnishings and a bookcase but no completeness or
symmetry as either an office or a living room There were several
pictures on the wallan impossible oil painting for one thing dark
and gloomy a canal and barge scene in pink and nile green for another
some daguerreotypes of relatives and friends which were not half bad
Cowperwood noticed one of two girls one with reddishgold hair another
with what appeared to be silky brown The beautiful silver effect of the
daguerreotype had been tinted They were pretty girls healthy smiling
Celtic their heads close together their eyes looking straight out
at you He admired them casually and fancied they must be Butlers
daughters

Mr Cowperwood inquired Butler uttering the name fully with a
peculiar accent on the vowels He was a slowmoving man solemn and
deliberate Cowperwood noticed that his body was hale and strong like
seasoned hickory tanned by wind and rain The flesh of his cheeks was
pulled taut and there was nothing soft or flabby about him

Im that man

I have a little matter of stocks to talk over with you matter
almost sounded like mather and I thought youd better come here
rather than that I should come down to your office We can be more
privatelike and besides Im not as young as I used to be

He allowed a semitwinkle to rest in his eye as he looked his visitor
over

Cowperwood smiled

Well I hope I can be of service to you he said genially

I happen to be interested just at present in pickin up certain
streetrailway stocks on change Ill tell you about them later Wont
you have somethin to drink Its a cold morning

No thanks I never drink

Never Thats a hard word when it comes to whisky Well no matter
Its a good rule My boys dont touch anything and Im glad of it As I
say Im interested in pickin up a few stocks on change but to tell
you the truth Im more interested in findin some clever young felly
like yourself through whom I can work One thing leads to another you
know in this world And he looked at his visitor noncommittally and
yet with a genial show of interest

Quite so replied Cowperwood with a friendly gleam in return

Well Butler meditated half to himself half to Cowperwood there
are a number of things that a bright young man could do for me in the
street if he were so minded I have two bright boys of my own but I
dont want them to become stockgamblers and I dont know that
they would or could if I wanted them to But this isnt a matter of
stockgambling Im pretty busy as it is and as I said awhile ago Im
getting along Im not as light on my toes as I once was But if I had
the right sort of a young manIve been looking into your record
by the way never fearhe might handle a number of little
thingsinvestments and loanswhich might bring us each a little
somethin Sometimes the young men around town ask advice of me in one
way and anotherthey have a little somethin to invest and so

He paused and looked tantalizingly out of the window knowing full
well Cowperwood was greatly interested and that this talk of political
influence and connections could only whet his appetite Butler wanted
him to see clearly that fidelity was the point in this casefidelity
tact subtlety and concealment

Well if you have been looking into my record observed Cowperwood
with his own elusive smile leaving the thought suspended

Butler felt the force of the temperament and the argument He liked
the young mans poise and balance A number of people had spoken of
Cowperwood to him It was now Cowperwood  Co The company was fiction
purely He asked him something about the street how the market was
running what he knew about streetrailways Finally he outlined his
plan of buying all he could of the stock of two given linesthe Ninth
and Tenth and the Fifteenth and Sixteenthwithout attracting any
attention if possible It was to be done slowly part on change part
from individual holders He did not tell him that there was a certain
amount of legislative pressure he hoped to bring to bear to get him
franchises for extensions in the regions beyond where the lines now
ended in order that when the time came for them to extend their
facilities they would have to see him or his sons who might be large
minority stockholders in these very concerns It was a farsighted plan
and meant that the lines would eventually drop into his or his sons
basket

Ill be delighted to work with you Mr Butler in any way that you
may suggest observed Cowperwood I cant say that I have so much of a
business as yetmerely prospects But my connections are good I am
now a member of the New York and Philadelphia exchanges Those who have
dealt with me seem to like the results I get

I know a little something about your work already reiterated Butler
wisely

Very well then whenever you have a commission you can call at
my office or write or I will call here I will give you my secret
operating code so that anything you say will be strictly confidential

Well well not say anything more now In a few days Ill have
somethin for you When I do you can draw on my bank for what you need
up to a certain amount He got up and looked out into the street and
Cowperwood also arose

Its a fine day now isnt it

It surely is

Well well get to know each other better Im sure

He held out his hand

I hope so

Cowperwood went out Butler accompanying him to the door As he did so a
young girl bounded in from the street redcheeked blueeyed wearing a
scarlet cape with the peaked hood thrown over her redgold hair

Oh daddy I almost knocked you down

She gave her father and incidentally Cowperwood a gleaming radiant
inclusive smile Her teeth were bright and small and her lips budred

Youre home early I thought you were going to stay all day

I was but I changed my mind

She passed on in swinging her arms

Yes well Butler continued when she had gone Then well leave it
for a day or two Good day

Good day

Cowperwood warm with this enhancing of his financial prospects went
down the steps but incidentally he spared a passing thought for the gay
spirit of youth that had manifested itself in this redcheeked maiden
What a bright healthy bounding girl Her voice had the subtle
vigorous ring of fifteen or sixteen She was all vitality What a fine
catch for some young fellow some day and her father would make him
rich no doubt or help to





Chapter XII


It was to Edward Malia Butler that Cowperwood turned now some nineteen
months later when he was thinking of the influence that might bring him
an award of a portion of the State issue of bonds Butler could probably
be interested to take some of them himself or could help him place
some He had come to like Cowperwood very much and was now being carried
on the latters books as a prospective purchaser of large blocks of
stocks And Cowperwood liked this great solid Irishman He liked his
history He had met Mrs Butler a rather fat and phlegmatic Irish woman
with a world of hard sense who cared nothing at all for show and who
still liked to go into the kitchen and superintend the cooking He had
met Owen and Callum Butler the boys and Aileen and Norah the girls
Aileen was the one who had bounded up the steps the first day he had
called at the Butler house several seasons before

There was a cozy gratefire burning in Butlers improvised private
office when Cowperwood called Spring was coming on but the evenings
were cool The older man invited Cowperwood to make himself comfortable
in one of the large leather chairs before the fire and then proceeded to
listen to his recital of what he hoped to accomplish

Well now that isnt so easy he commented at the end You ought to
know more about that than I do Im not a financier as you well know
And he grinned apologetically

Its a matter of influence went on Cowperwood And favoritism
That I know Drexel  Company and Cooke  Company have connections at
Harrisburg They have men of their own looking after their interests
The attorneygeneral and the State treasurer are hand in glove with
them Even if I put in a bid and can demonstrate that I can handle the
loan it wont help me to get it Other people have done that I have to
have friendsinfluence You know how it is

Them things Butler said is easy enough if you know the right
parties to approach Now theres Jimmy Oliverhe ought to know
something about that Jimmy Oliver was the whilom district attorney
serving at this time and incidentally free adviser to Mr Butler in
many ways He was also accidentally a warm personal friend of the
State treasurer

How much of the loan do you want

Five million

Five million Butler sat up Man what are you talking about Thats
a good deal of money Where are you going to sell all that

I want to bid for five million assuaged Cowperwood softly I only
want one million but I want the prestige of putting in a bona fide bid
for five million It will do me good on the street

Butler sank back somewhat relieved

Five million Prestige You want one million Well now thats
different Thats not such a bad idea We ought to be able to get that

He rubbed his chin some more and stared into the fire

And Cowperwood felt confident when he left the house that evening that
Butler would not fail him but would set the wheels working Therefore
he was not surprised and knew exactly what it meant when a few days
later he was introduced to City Treasurer Julian Bode who promised to
introduce him to State Treasurer Van Nostrand and to see that his claims
to consideration were put before the people Of course you know
he said to Cowperwood in the presence of Butler for it was at the
latters home that the conference took place this banking crowd is
very powerful You know who they are They dont want any interference
in this bond issue business I was talking to Terrence Relihan who
represents them up theremeaning Harrisburg the State capitaland
he says they wont stand for it at all You may have trouble right here
in Philadelphia after you get ittheyre pretty powerful you know Are
you sure just where you can place it

Yes Im sure replied Cowperwood

Well the best thing in my judgment is not to say anything at all Just
put in your bid Van Nostrand with the governors approval will make
the award We can fix the governor I think After you get it they may
talk to you personally but thats your business

Cowperwood smiled his inscrutable smile There were so many ins and outs
to this financial life It was an endless network of underground holes
along which all sorts of influences were moving A little wit a little
nimbleness a little lucktime and opportunitythese sometimes availed
Here he was through his ambition to get on and nothing else coming
into contact with the State treasurer and the governor They were
going to consider his case personally because he demanded that it be
considerednothing more Others more influential than himself had
quite as much right to a share but they didnt take it Nerve ideas
aggressiveness how these counted when one had luck

He went away thinking how surprised Drexel  Co and Cooke  Co would
be to see him appearing in the field as a competitor In his home in a
little room on the second floor next his bedroom which he had fixed up
as an office with a desk a safe and a leather chair he consulted his
resources There were so many things to think of He went over again the
list of people whom he had seen and whom he could count on to
subscribe and in so far as that was concernedthe award of one million
dollarshe was safe He figured to make two per cent on the total
transaction or twenty thousand dollars If he did he was going to buy
a house out on Girard Avenue beyond the Butlers or better yet buy a
piece of ground and erect one mortgaging house and property so to do
His father was prospering nicely He might want to build a house next to
him and they could live side by side His own business aside from this
deal would yield him ten thousand dollars this year His streetcar
investments aggregating fifty thousand were paying six per cent His
wifes property represented by this house some government bonds and
some real estate in West Philadelphia amounted to forty thousand more
Between them they were rich but he expected to be much richer All he
needed now was to keep cool If he succeeded in this bondissue matter
he could do it again and on a larger scale There would be more issues
He turned out the light after a while and went into his wifes boudoir
where she was sleeping The nurse and the children were in a room
beyond

Well Lillian he observed when she awoke and turned over toward him
I think I have that bond matter that I was telling you about arranged
at last I think Ill get a million of it anyhow Thatll mean twenty
thousand If I do well build out on Girard Avenue Thats going to be
the street The college is making that neighborhood

Thatll be fine wont it Frank she observed and rubbed his arm as
he sat on the side of the bed

Her remark was vaguely speculative

Well have to show the Butlers some attention from now on Hes been
very nice to me and hes going to be usefulI can see that He asked me
to bring you over some time We must go Be nice to his wife He can do
a lot for me if he wants to He has two daughters too Well have to
have them over here

Ill have them to dinner sometime she agreed cheerfully and
helpfully and Ill stop and take Mrs Butler driving if shell go or
she can take me

She had already learned that the Butlers were rather showythe younger
generationthat they were sensitive as to their lineage and that money
in their estimation was supposed to make up for any deficiency in any
other respect Butler himself is a very presentable man Cowperwood
had once remarked to her but Mrs Butlerwell shes all right
but shes a little commonplace Shes a fine woman though I think
goodnatured and goodhearted He cautioned her not to overlook Aileen
and Norah because the Butlers mother and father were very proud of
them

Mrs Cowperwood at this time was thirtytwo years old Cowperwood
twentyseven The birth and care of two children had made some
difference in her looks She was no longer as softly pleasing more
angular Her face was hollowcheeked like so many of Rossettis
and BurneJoness women Her health was really not as good as it had
beenthe care of two children and a late undiagnosed tendency toward
gastritis having reduced her In short she was a little run down
nervously and suffered from fits of depression Cowperwood had noticed
this He tried to be gentle and considerate but he was too much of a
utilitarian and practicalminded observer not to realize that he was
likely to have a sickly wife on his hands later Sympathy and affection
were great things but desire and charm must endure or one was compelled
to be sadly conscious of their loss So often now he saw young girls who
were quite in his mood and who were exceedingly robust and joyous It
was fine advisable practical to adhere to the virtues as laid down
in the current social lexicon but if you had a sickly wifeAnd anyhow
was a man entitled to only one wife Must he never look at another
woman Supposing he found some one He pondered those things between
hours of labor and concluded that it did not make so much difference
If a man could and not be exposed it was all right He had to be
careful though Tonight as he sat on the side of his wifes bed he
was thinking somewhat of this for he had seen Aileen Butler again
playing and singing at her piano as he passed the parlor door She was
like a bright bird radiating health and enthusiasma reminder of youth
in general

Its a strange world he thought but his thoughts were his own and
he didnt propose to tell any one about them

The bond issue when it came was a curious compromise for although it
netted him his twenty thousand dollars and more and served to
introduce him to the financial notice of Philadelphia and the State of
Pennsylvania it did not permit him to manipulate the subscriptions as
he had planned The State treasurer was seen by him at the office of a
local lawyer of great repute where he worked when in the city He was
gracious to Cowperwood because he had to be He explained to him just
how things were regulated at Harrisburg The big financiers were looked
to for campaign funds They were represented by henchmen in the State
assembly and senate The governor and the treasurer were footfree
but there were other influencesprestige friendship social power
political ambitions etc The big men might constitute a close
corporation which in itself was unfair but after all they were the
legitimate sponsors for big money loans of this kind The State had to
keep on good terms with them especially in times like these Seeing
that Mr Cowperwood was so well able to dispose of the million he
expected to get it would be perfectly all right to award it to him but
Van Nostrand had a counterproposition to make Would Cowperwood if the
financial crowd now handling the matter so desired turn over his award
to them for a considerationa sum equal to what he expected to makein
the event the award was made to him Certain financiers desired this It
was dangerous to oppose them They were perfectly willing he should
put in a bid for five million and get the prestige of that to have him
awarded one million and get the prestige of that was well enough also
but they desired to handle the twentythree million dollars in an
unbroken lot It looked better He need not be advertised as having
withdrawn They would be content to have him achieve the glory of having
done what he started out to do Just the same the example was bad
Others might wish to imitate him If it were known in the street
privately that he had been coerced for a consideration into giving up
others would be deterred from imitating him in the future Besides if
he refused they could cause him trouble His loans might be called
Various banks might not be so friendly in the future His constituents
might be warned against him in one way or another

Cowperwood saw the point He acquiesced It was something to have
brought so many high and mighties to their knees So they knew of him
They were quite well aware of him Well and good He would take the
award and twenty thousand or thereabouts and withdraw The State
treasurer was delighted It solved a ticklish proposition for him

Im glad to have seen you he said Im glad weve met Ill drop
in and talk with you some time when Im down this way Well have lunch
together

The State treasurer for some odd reason felt that Mr Cowperwood was
a man who could make him some money His eye was so keen his expression
was so alert and yet so subtle He told the governor and some other of
his associates about him

So the award was finally made Cowperwood after some private
negotiations in which he met the officers of Drexel  Co was paid his
twenty thousand dollars and turned his share of the award over to them
New faces showed up in his office now from time to timeamong them that
of Van Nostrand and one Terrence Relihan a representative of some other
political forces at Harrisburg He was introduced to the governor one
day at lunch His name was mentioned in the papers and his prestige
grew rapidly

Immediately he began working on plans with young Ellsworth for his new
house He was going to build something exceptional this time he told
Lillian They were going to have to do some entertainingentertaining
on a larger scale than ever North Front Street was becoming too tame
He put the house up for sale consulted with his father and found that
he also was willing to move The sons prosperity had redounded to the
credit of the father The directors of the bank were becoming much more
friendly to the old man Next year President Kugel was going to retire
Because of his sons noted coup as well as his long service he was
going to be made president Frank was a large borrower from his fathers
bank By the same token he was a large depositor His connection
with Edward Butler was significant He sent his fathers bank certain
accounts which it otherwise could not have secured The city treasurer
became interested in it and the State treasurer Cowperwood Sr stood
to earn twenty thousand a year as president and he owed much of it
to his son The two families were now on the best of terms Anna now
twentyone and Edward and Joseph frequently spent the night at Franks
house Lillian called almost daily at his mothers There was much
interchange of family gossip and it was thought well to build side by
side So Cowperwood Sr bought fifty feet of ground next to his sons
thirtyfive and together they commenced the erection of two charming
commodious homes which were to be connected by a covered passageway or
pergola which could be inclosed with glass in winter

The most popular local stone a green granite was chosen but Mr
Ellsworth promised to present it in such a way that it would be
especially pleasing Cowperwood Sr decided that he could afford to
spent seventyfive thousand dollarshe was now worth two hundred and
fifty thousand and Frank decided that he could risk fifty seeing
that he could raise money on a mortgage He planned at the same time to
remove his office farther south on Third Street and occupy a building
of his own He knew where an option was to be had on a twentyfivefoot
building which though old could be given a new brownstone front and
made very significant He saw in his minds eye a handsome building
fitted with an immense plateglass window inside his hardwood fixtures
visible and over the door or to one side of it set in bronze letters
Cowperwood  Co Vaguely but surely he began to see looming before him
like a fleecy tinted cloud on the horizon his future fortune He was to
be rich very very rich





Chapter XIII


During all the time that Cowperwood had been building himself up thus
steadily the great war of the rebellion had been fought almost to its
close It was now October 1864 The capture of Mobile and the Battle of
the Wilderness were fresh memories Grant was now before Petersburg and
the great general of the South Lee was making that last brilliant and
hopeless display of his ability as a strategist and a soldier There had
been timesas for instance during the long dreary period in which
the country was waiting for Vicksburg to fall for the Army of the
Potomac to prove victorious when Pennsylvania was invaded by Leewhen
stocks fell and commercial conditions were very bad generally In
times like these Cowperwoods own manipulative ability was taxed to the
utmost and he had to watch every hour to see that his fortune was not
destroyed by some unexpected and destructive piece of news

His personal attitude toward the war however and aside from his
patriotic feeling that the Union ought to be maintained was that it
was destructive and wasteful He was by no means so wanting in patriotic
emotion and sentiment but that he could feel that the Union as it had
now come to be spreading its great length from the Atlantic to the
Pacific and from the snows of Canada to the Gulf was worth while
Since his birth in 1837 he had seen the nation reach that physical
growthbarring Alaskawhich it now possesses Not so much earlier than
his youth Florida had been added to the Union by purchase from Spain
Mexico after the unjust war of 1848 had ceded Texas and the territory
to the West The boundary disputes between England and the United States
in the far Northwest had been finally adjusted To a man with great
social and financial imagination these facts could not help but be
significant and if they did nothing more they gave him a sense of the
boundless commercial possibilities which existed potentially in so
vast a realm His was not the order of speculative financial enthusiasm
which in the type known as the promoter sees endless possibilities
for gain in every unexplored rivulet and prairie reach but the very
vastness of the country suggested possibilities which he hoped might
remain undisturbed A territory covering the length of a whole zone and
between two seas seemed to him to possess potentialities which it could
not retain if the States of the South were lost

At the same time the freedom of the negro was not a significant point
with him He had observed that race from his boyhood with considerable
interest and had been struck with virtues and defects which seemed
inherent and which plainly to him conditioned their experiences

He was not at all sure for instance that the negroes could be made
into anything much more significant than they were At any rate it was
a long uphill struggle for them of which many future generations would
not witness the conclusion He had no particular quarrel with the theory
that they should be free he saw no particular reason why the South
should not protest vigorously against the destruction of their property
and their system It was too bad that the negroes as slaves should be
abused in some instances He felt sure that that ought to be adjusted
in some way but beyond that he could not see that there was any great
ethical basis for the contentions of their sponsors The vast majority
of men and women as he could see were not essentially above slavery
even when they had all the guarantees of a constitution formulated to
prevent it There was mental slavery the slavery of the weak mind
and the weak body He followed the contentions of such men as Sumner
Garrison Phillips and Beecher with considerable interest but at no
time could he see that the problem was a vital one for him He did
not care to be a soldier or an officer of soldiers he had no gift for
polemics his mind was not of the disputatious ordernot even in
the realm of finance He was concerned only to see what was of vast
advantage to him and to devote all his attention to that This
fratricidal war in the nation could not help him It really delayed he
thought the true commercial and financial adjustment of the country
and he hoped that it would soon end He was not of those who complained
bitterly of the excessive war taxes though he knew them to be trying to
many Some of the stories of death and disaster moved him greatly but
alas they were among the unaccountable fortunes of life and could
not be remedied by him So he had gone his way day by day watching
the coming in and the departing of troops seeing the bands of dirty
disheveled gaunt sickly men returning from the fields and hospitals
and all he could do was to feel sorry This war was not for him He had
taken no part in it and he felt sure that he could only rejoice in
its conclusionnot as a patriot but as a financier It was wasteful
pathetic unfortunate

The months proceeded apace A local election intervened and there was a
new city treasurer a new assessor of taxes and a new mayor but Edward
Malia Butler continued to have apparently the same influence as before
The Butlers and the Cowperwoods had become quite friendly Mrs Butler
rather liked Lillian though they were of different religious beliefs
and they went driving or shopping together the younger woman a little
critical and ashamed of the elder because of her poor grammar her
Irish accent her plebeian tastesas though the Wiggins had not been as
plebeian as any On the other hand the old lady as she was compelled to
admit was goodnatured and goodhearted She loved to give since she
had plenty and sent presents here and there to Lillian the children
and others Now youse must come over and take dinner with usthe
Butlers had arrived at the eveningdinner periodor Youse must come
drive with me tomorrow

Aileen God bless her is such a foine girl or Norah the darlin
is sick the day

But Aileen her airs her aggressive disposition her love of attention
her vanity irritated and at times disgusted Mrs Cowperwood She was
eighteen now with a figure which was subtly provocative Her manner
was boyish hoydenish at times and although conventtrained she was
inclined to balk at restraint in any form But there was a softness
lurking in her blue eyes that was most sympathetic and human

St Timothys and the convent school in Germantown had been the choice
of her parents for her educationwhat they called a good Catholic
education She had learned a great deal about the theory and forms of
the Catholic ritual but she could not understand them The church with
its tall dimly radiant windows its high white altar its figure of
St Joseph on one side and the Virgin Mary on the other clothed in
goldenstarred robes of blue wearing haloes and carrying scepters had
impressed her greatly The church as a wholeany Catholic churchwas
beautiful to look atsoothing The altar during high mass lit with a
halfhundred or more candles and dignified and made impressive by the
rich lacy vestments of the priests and the acolytes the impressive
needlework and gorgeous colorings of the amice chasuble cope stole
and maniple took her fancy and held her eye Let us say there was
always lurking in her a sense of grandeur coupled with a love of color
and a love of love From the first she was somewhat sexconscious She
had no desire for accuracy no desire for precise information Innate
sensuousness rarely has It basks in sunshine bathes in color dwells
in a sense of the impressive and the gorgeous and rests there Accuracy
is not necessary except in the case of aggressive acquisitive natures
when it manifests itself in a desire to seize True controlling
sensuousness cannot be manifested in the most active dispositions nor
again in the most accurate

There is need of defining these statements in so far as they apply
to Aileen It would scarcely be fair to describe her nature as being
definitely sensual at this time It was too rudimentary Any harvest is
of long growth The confessional dim on Friday and Saturday evenings
when the church was lighted by but a few lamps and the priests
warnings penances and ecclesiastical forgiveness whispered through
the narrow lattice moved her as something subtly pleasing She was not
afraid of her sins Hell so definitely set forth did not frighten her
Really it had not laid hold on her conscience The old women and old
men hobbling into church bowed in prayer murmuring over their beads
were objects of curious interest like the woodcarvings in the peculiar
array of woodreliefs emphasizing the Stations of the Cross She herself
had liked to confess particularly when she was fourteen and fifteen
and to listen to the priests voice as he admonished her with Now
my dear child A particularly old priest a French father who came
to hear their confessions at school interested her as being kind and
sweet His forgiveness and blessing seemed sincerebetter than her
prayers which she went through perfunctorily And then there was a
young priest at St Timothys Father David hale and rosy with a curl
of black hair over his forehead and an almost jaunty way of wearing his
priestly hat who came down the aisle Sundays sprinkling holy water
with a definite distinguished sweep of the hand who took her fancy
He heard confessions and now and then she liked to whisper her strange
thoughts to him while she actually speculated on what he might privately
be thinking She could not if she tried associate him with any divine
authority He was too young too human There was something a little
malicious teasing in the way she delighted to tell him about herself
and then walk demurely repentantly out At St Agathas she had been
rather a difficult person to deal with She was as the good sisters of
the school had readily perceived too full of life too active to be
easily controlled That Miss Butler once observed Sister Constantia
the Mother Superior to Sister Sempronia Aileens immediate mentor
is a very spirited girl you may have a great deal of trouble with her
unless you use a good deal of tact You may have to coax her with little
gifts You will get on better So Sister Sempronia had sought to find
what Aileen was most interested in and bribe her therewith Being
intensely conscious of her fathers competence and vain of her personal
superiority it was not so easy to do She had wanted to go home
occasionally though she had wanted to be allowed to wear the sisters
rosary of large beads with its pendent cross of ebony and its silver
Christ and this was held up as a great privilege For keeping quiet in
class walking softly and speaking softlyas much as it was in her to
dofor not stealing into other girls rooms after lights were out and
for abandoning crushes on this and that sympathetic sister these awards
and others such as walking out in the grounds on Saturday afternoons
being allowed to have all the flowers she wanted some extra dresses
jewels etc were offered She liked music and the idea of painting
though she had no talent in that direction and books novels
interested her but she could not get them The restgrammar spelling
sewing church and general historyshe loathed Deportmentwell there
was something in that She had liked the rather exaggerated curtsies
they taught her and she had often reflected on how she would use them
when she reached home

When she came out into life the little social distinctions which have
been indicated began to impress themselves on her and she wished
sincerely that her father would build a better homea mansionsuch as
those she saw elsewhere and launch her properly in society Failing in
that she could think of nothing save clothes jewels ridinghorses
carriages and the appropriate changes of costume which were allowed her
for these Her family could not entertain in any distinguished way where
they were and so already at eighteen she was beginning to feel the
sting of a blighted ambition She was eager for life How was she to get
it

Her room was a study in the foibles of an eager and ambitious mind It
was full of clothes beautiful things for all occasionsjewelrywhich
she had small opportunity to wearshoes stockings lingerie laces In
a crude way she had made a study of perfumes and cosmetics though she
needed the latter not at all and these were present in abundance
She was not very orderly and she loved lavishness of display and
her curtains hangings table ornaments and pictures inclined to
gorgeousness which did not go well with the rest of the house

Aileen always reminded Cowperwood of a highstepping horse without a
checkrein He met her at various times shopping with her mother out
driving with her father and he was always interested and amused at the
affected bored tone she assumed before himthe Oh dear Oh dear
Life is so tiresome dont you know when as a matter of fact every
moment of it was of thrilling interest to her Cowperwood took her
mental measurement exactly A girl with a high sense of life in her
romantic full of the thought of love and its possibilities As he
looked at her he had the sense of seeing the best that nature can do
when she attempts to produce physical perfection The thought came to
him that some lucky young dog would marry her pretty soon and carry her
away but whoever secured her would have to hold her by affection and
subtle flattery and attention if he held her at all

The little snipshe was not at allshe thinks the sun rises and
sets in her fathers pocket Lillian observed one day to her husband
To hear her talk youd think they were descended from Irish kings Her
pretended interest in art and music amuses me

Oh dont be too hard on her coaxed Cowperwood diplomatically He
already liked Aileen very much She plays very well and she has a good
voice

Yes I know but she has no real refinement How could she have Look
at her father and mother

I dont see anything so very much the matter with her insisted
Cowperwood Shes bright and goodlooking Of course shes only a
girl and a little vain but shell come out of that She isnt without
sense and force at that

Aileen as he knew was most friendly to him She liked him She made a
point of playing the piano and singing for him in his home and she sang
only when he was there There was something about his steady even gait
his stocky body and handsome head which attracted her In spite of
her vanity and egotism she felt a little overawed before him at
timeskeyed up She seemed to grow gayer and more brilliant in his
presence

The most futile thing in this world is any attempt perhaps at
exact definition of character All individuals are a bundle of
contradictionsnone more so than the most capable

In the case of Aileen Butler it would be quite impossible to give
an exact definition Intelligence of a raw crude order she had
certainlyalso a native force tamed somewhat by the doctrines and
conventions of current society still showed clear at times in an
elemental and not entirely unattractive way At this time she was only
eighteen years of agedecidedly attractive from the point of view of a
man of Frank Cowperwoods temperament She supplied something he had not
previously known or consciously craved Vitality and vivacity No other
woman or girl whom he had ever known had possessed so much innate
force as she Her redgold hairnot so red as decidedly golden with a
suggestion of red in itlooped itself in heavy folds about her forehead
and sagged at the base of her neck She had a beautiful nose not
sensitive but straightcut with small nostril openings and eyes that
were big and yet noticeably sensuous They were to him a pleasing
shade of bluegrayblue and her toilet due to her temperament of
course suggested almost undue luxury the bangles anklets earrings
and breastplates of the odalisque and yet of course they were not
there She confessed to him years afterward that she would have loved
to have stained her nails and painted the palms of her hands with
madderred Healthy and vigorous she was chronically interested in
menwhat they would think of herand how she compared with other
women

The fact that she could ride in a carriage live in a fine home on
Girard Avenue visit such homes as those of the Cowperwoods and others
was of great weight and yet even at this age she realized that life
was more than these things Many did not have them and lived

But these facts of wealth and advantage gripped her and when she sat at
the piano and played or rode in her carriage or walked or stood before
her mirror she was conscious of her figure her charms what they
meant to men how women envied her Sometimes she looked at poor
hollowchested or homelyfaced girls and felt sorry for them at other
times she flared into inexplicable opposition to some handsome girl or
woman who dared to brazen her socially or physically There were such
girls of the better families who in Chestnut Street in the expensive
shops or on the drive on horseback or in carriages tossed their heads
and indicated as well as human motions can that they were betterbred
and knew it When this happened each stared defiantly at the other She
wanted ever so much to get up in the world and yet nambypamby men
of better social station than herself did not attract her at all She
wanted a man Now and then there was one something like but not
entirely who appealed to her but most of them were politicians or
legislators acquaintances of her father and socially nothing at
alland so they wearied and disappointed her Her father did not know
the truly elite But Mr Cowperwoodhe seemed so refined so forceful
and so reserved She often looked at Mrs Cowperwood and thought how
fortunate she was





Chapter XIV


The development of Cowperwood as Cowperwood  Co following his
arresting bond venture finally brought him into relationship with one
man who was to play an important part in his life morally
financially and in other ways This was George W Stener the new city
treasurerelect who to begin with was a puppet in the hands of
other men but who also in spite of this fact became a personage of
considerable importance for the simple reason that he was weak Stener
had been engaged in the real estate and insurance business in a small
way before he was made city treasurer He was one of those men of whom
there are so many thousands in every large community with no breadth
of vision no real subtlety no craft no great skill in anything You
would never hear a new idea emanating from Stener He never had one in
his life On the other hand he was not a bad fellow He had a stodgy
dusty commonplace look to him which was more a matter of mind than of
body His eye was of vague grayblue his hair a dusty lightbrown and
thin His mouththere was nothing impressive there He was quite tall
nearly six feet with moderately broad shoulders but his figure was
anything but shapely He seemed to stoop a little his stomach was the
least bit protuberant and he talked commonplacesthe small change of
newspaper and street and business gossip People liked him in his own
neighborhood He was thought to be honest and kindly and he was as far
as he knew His wife and four children were as average and insignificant
as the wives and children of such men usually are

Just the same and in spite of or perhaps politically speaking
because of all this George W Stener was brought into temporary public
notice by certain political methods which had existed in Philadelphia
practically unmodified for the previous half hundred years First
because he was of the same political faith as the dominant local
political party he had become known to the local councilman and
wardleader of his ward as a faithful soulone useful in the matter
of drumming up votes And nextalthough absolutely without value as
a speaker for he had no ideasyou could send him from door to door
asking the grocer and the blacksmith and the butcher how he felt about
things and he would make friends and in the long run predict fairly
accurately the probable vote Furthermore you could dole him out a few
platitudes and he would repeat them The Republican party which was the
newborn party then but dominant in Philadelphia needed your vote it
was necessary to keep the rascally Democrats outhe could scarcely have
said why They had been for slavery They were for free trade It never
once occurred to him that these things had nothing to do with the local
executive and financial administration of Philadelphia Supposing they
didnt What of it

In Philadelphia at this time a certain United States Senator one Mark
Simpson together with Edward Malia Butler and Henry A Mollenhauer
a rich coal dealer and investor were supposed to and did control
jointly the political destiny of the city They had representatives
benchmen spies toolsa great company Among them was this same
Stenera minute cog in the silent machinery of their affairs

In scarcely any other city save this where the inhabitants were of a
deadly average in so far as being commonplace was concerned could such
a man as Stener have been elected city treasurer The rank and file
did not except in rare instances make up their political program An
inside ring had this matter in charge Certain positions were allotted
to such and such men or to such and such factions of the party for such
and such services renderedbut who does not know politics

In due course of time therefore George W Stener had become persona
grata to Edward Strobik a quondam councilman who afterward became ward
leader and still later president of council and who in private life
was a stonedealer and owner of a brickyard Strobik was a benchman
of Henry A Mollenhauer the hardest and coldest of all three of the
political leaders The latter had things to get from council and
Strobik was his tool He had Stener elected and because he was
faithful in voting as he was told the latter was later made an assistant
superintendent of the highways department

Here he came under the eyes of Edward Malia Butler and was slightly
useful to him Then the central political committee with Butler in
charge decided that some nice docile man who would at the same time be
absolutely faithful was needed for city treasurer and Stener was put on
the ticket He knew little of finance but was an excellent bookkeeper
and anyhow was not corporation counsel Regan another political tool
of this great triumvirate there to advise him at all times He was
It was a very simple matter Being put on the ticket was equivalent to
being elected and so after a few weeks of exceedingly trying
platform experiences in which he had stammered through platitudinous
declarations that the city needed to be honestly administered he was
inducted into office and there you were

Now it wouldnt have made so much difference what George W Steners
executive and financial qualifications for the position were but
at this time the city of Philadelphia was still hobbling along under
perhaps as evil a financial system or lack of it as any city ever
enduredthe assessor and the treasurer being allowed to collect and
hold moneys belonging to the city outside of the citys private vaults
and that without any demand on the part of anybody that the same be
invested by them at interest for the citys benefit Rather all they
were expected to do apparently was to restore the principal and
that which was with them when they entered or left office It was not
understood or publicly demanded that the moneys so collected or
drawn from any source be maintained intact in the vaults of the city
treasury They could be loaned out deposited in banks or used to
further private interests of any one so long as the principal was
returned and no one was the wiser Of course this theory of
finance was not publicly sanctioned but it was known politically and
journalistically and in high finance How were you to stop it

Cowperwood in approaching Edward Malia Butler had been unconsciously
let in on this atmosphere of erratic and unsatisfactory speculation
without really knowing it When he had left the office of Tighe  Co
seven years before it was with the idea that henceforth and forever he
would have nothing to do with the stockbrokerage proposition but now
behold him back in it again with more vim than he had ever displayed
for now he was working for himself the firm of Cowperwood  Co and
he was eager to satisfy the world of new and powerful individuals who by
degrees were drifting to him All had a little money All had tips
and they wanted him to carry certain lines of stock on margin for them
because he was known to other political men and because he was safe
And this was true He was not or at least up to this time had not been
a speculator or a gambler on his own account In fact he often soothed
himself with the thought that in all these years he had never gambled
for himself but had always acted strictly for others instead But now
here was George W Stener with a proposition which was not quite the
same thing as stockgambling and yet it was

During a long period of years preceding the Civil War and through it
let it here be explained and remembered the city of Philadelphia had
been in the habit as a corporation when there were no available funds
in the treasury of issuing what were known as city warrants which were
nothing more than notes or IOUs bearing six per cent interest and
payable sometimes in thirty days sometimes in three sometimes in six
monthsall depending on the amount and how soon the city treasurer
thought there would be sufficient money in the treasury to take them up
and cancel them Small tradesmen and large contractors were frequently
paid in this way the small tradesman who sold supplies to the city
institutions for instance being compelled to discount his notes at the
bank if he needed ready money usually for ninety cents on the dollar
while the large contractor could afford to hold his and wait It can
readily be seen that this might well work to the disadvantage of the
small dealer and merchant and yet prove quite a fine thing for a large
contractor or notebroker for the city was sure to pay the warrants at
some time and six per cent interest was a fat rate considering the
absolute security A banker or broker who gathered up these things from
small tradesmen at ninety cents on the dollar made a fine thing of it
all around if he could wait

Originally in all probability there was no intention on the part of
the city treasurer to do any one an injustice and it is likely that
there really were no funds to pay with at the time However that may
have been there was later no excuse for issuing the warrants seeing
that the city might easily have been managed much more economically But
these warrants as can readily be imagined had come to be a fine source
of profit for notebrokers bankers political financiers and inside
political manipulators generally and so they remained a part of the
citys fiscal policy

There was just one drawback to all this In order to get the full
advantage of this condition the large banker holding them must be an
inside banker one close to the political forces of the city for
if he was not and needed money and he carried his warrants to the city
treasurer he would find that he could not get cash for them But if
he transferred them to some banker or notebroker who was close to the
political force of the city it was quite another matter The treasury
would find means to pay Or if so desired by the notebroker or
bankerthe right onenotes which were intended to be met in three
months and should have been settled at that time were extended to run
on years and years drawing interest at six per cent even when the
city had ample funds to meet them Yet this meant of course an illegal
interest drain on the city but that was all right also No funds
could cover that The general public did not know It could not find
out The newspapers were not at all vigilant being propolitical There
were no persistent enthusiastic reformers who obtained any political
credence During the war warrants outstanding in this manner arose
in amount to much over two million dollars all drawing six per cent
interest but then of course it began to get a little scandalous
Besides at least some of the investors began to want their money back

In order therefore to clear up this outstanding indebtedness and make
everything shipshape again it was decided that the city must issue a
loan say for two million dollarsno need to be exact about the amount
And this loan must take the shape of interestbearing certificates of a
par value of one hundred dollars redeemable in six twelve or eighteen
months as the case may be These certificates of loan were then
ostensibly to be sold in the open market a sinkingfund set aside
for their redemption and the money so obtained used to take up the
longoutstanding warrants which were now such a subject of public
comment

It is obvious that this was merely a case of robbing Peter to pay
Paul There was no real clearing up of the outstanding debt It was
the intention of the schemers to make it possible for the financial
politicians on the inside to reap the same old harvest by allowing the
certificates to be sold to the right parties for ninety or less setting
up the claim that there was no market for them the credit of the city
being bad To a certain extent this was true The war was just over
Money was high Investors could get more than six per cent elsewhere
unless the loan was sold at ninety But there were a few watchful
politicians not in the administration and some newspapers and
nonpolitical financiers who because of the high strain of patriotism
existing at the time insisted that the loan should be sold at par
Therefore a clause to that effect had to be inserted in the enabling
ordinance

This as one might readily see destroyed the politicians little scheme
to get this loan at ninety Nevertheless since they desired that the
money tied up in the old warrants and now not redeemable because of lack
of funds should be paid them the only way this could be done would be
to have some broker who knew the subtleties of the stock market handle
this new city loan on change in such a way that it would be made to
seem worth one hundred and to be sold to outsiders at that figure
Afterward if as it was certain to do it fell below that the
politicians could buy as much of it as they pleased and eventually have
the city redeem it at par

George W Stener entering as city treasurer at this time and bringing
no special financial intelligence to the proposition was really
troubled Henry A Mollenhauer one of the men who had gathered up a
large amount of the old city warrants and who now wanted his money in
order to invest it in bonanza offers in the West called on Stener and
also on the mayor He with Simpson and Butler made up the Big Three

I think something ought to be done about these warrants that are
outstanding he explained I am carrying a large amount of them and
there are others We have helped the city a long time by saying nothing
but now I think that something ought to be done Mr Butler and Mr
Simpson feel the same way Couldnt these new loan certificates be
listed on the stock exchange and the money raised that way Some clever
broker could bring them to par

Stener was greatly flattered by the visit from Mollenhauer Rarely did
he trouble to put in a personal appearance and then only for the weight
and effect his presence would have He called on the mayor and the
president of council much as he called on Stener with a lofty
distant inscrutable air They were as officeboys to him

In order to understand exactly the motive for Mollenhauers interest
in Stener and the significance of this visit and Steners subsequent
action in regard to it it will be necessary to scan the political
horizon for some little distance back Although George W Stener was in
a way a political henchman and appointee of Mollenhauers the latter
was only vaguely acquainted with him He had seen him before knew of
him had agreed that his name should be put on the local slate largely
because he had been assured by those who were closest to him and who
did his bidding that Stener was all right that he would do as he
was told that he would cause no one any trouble etc In fact
during several previous administrations Mollenhauer had maintained a
subsurface connection with the treasury but never so close a one as
could easily be traced He was too conspicuous a man politically and
financially for that But he was not above a plan in which Simpson if
not Butler shared of using political and commercial stoolpigeons to
bleed the city treasury as much as possible without creating a scandal
In fact for some years previous to this various agents had already
been employedEdward Strobik president of council Asa Conklin the
then incumbent of the mayors chair Thomas Wycroft alderman Jacob
Harmon alderman and othersto organize dummy companies under various
names whose business it was to deal in those things which the city
neededlumber stone steel iron cementa long listand of course
always at a fat profit to those ultimately behind the dummy companies
so organized It saved the city the trouble of looking far and wide for
honest and reasonable dealers

Since the action of at least three of these dummies will have something
to do with the development of Cowperwoods story they may be briefly
described Edward Strobik the chief of them and the one most useful to
Mollenhauer in a minor way was a very spry person of about thirtyfive
at this timelean and somewhat forceful with black hair black eyes
and an inordinately large black mustache He was dapper inclined to
noticeable clothinga pair of striped trousers a white vest a black
cutaway coat and a high silk hat His markedly ornamental shoes were
always polished to perfection and his immaculate appearance gave him
the nickname of The Dude among some Nevertheless he was quite able on
a small scale and was well liked by many

His two closest associates Messrs Thomas Wycroft and Jacob Harmon
were rather less attractive and less brilliant Jacob Harmon was a thick
wit socially but no fool financially He was big and rather doleful to
look upon with sandy brown hair and brown eyes but fairly intelligent
and absolutely willing to approve anything which was not too broad in
its crookedness and which would afford him sufficient protection to keep
him out of the clutches of the law He was really not so cunning as dull
and anxious to get along

Thomas Wycroft the last of this useful but minor triumvirate was a
tall lean man candlewaxy holloweyed gaunt of face pathetic to
look at physically but shrewd He was an ironmolder by trade and had
gotten into politics much as Stener hadbecause he was useful and he
had managed to make some moneyvia this triumvirate of which Strobik
was the ringleader and which was engaged in various peculiar businesses
which will now be indicated

The companies which these several henchmen had organized under previous
administrations and for Mollenhauer dealt in meat building material
lampposts highway supplies anything you will which the city
departments or its institutions needed A city contract once awarded was
irrevocable but certain councilmen had to be fixed in advance and
it took money to do that The company so organized need not actually
slaughter any cattle or mold lampposts All it had to do was to
organize to do that obtain a charter secure a contract for supplying
such material to the city from the city council which Strobik Harmon
and Wycroft would attend to and then sublet this to some actual
beefslaughterer or ironfounder who would supply the material and
allow them to pocket their profit which in turn was divided or paid for
to Mollenhauer and Simpson in the form of political donations to
clubs or organizations It was so easy and in a way so legitimate The
particular beefslaughterer or ironfounder thus favored could not hope
of his own ability thus to obtain a contract Stener or whoever was
in charge of the city treasury at the time for his services in loaning
money at a low rate of interest to be used as surety for the proper
performance of contract and to aid in some instances the beefkiller or
ironfounder to carry out his end was to be allowed not only the one or
two per cent which he might pocket other treasurers had but a fair
proportion of the profits A complacent confidential chief clerk who
was all right would be recommended to him It did not concern Stener
that Strobik Harmon and Wycroft acting for Mollenhauer were
incidentally planning to use a little of the money loaned for purposes
quite outside those indicated It was his business to loan it

However to be going on Some time before he was even nominated Stener
had learned from Strobik who by the way was one of his sureties
as treasurer which suretyship was against the law as were those of
Councilmen Wycroft and Harmon the law of Pennsylvania stipulating that
one political servant might not become surety for another that those
who had brought about this nomination and election would by no means ask
him to do anything which was not perfectly legal but that he must be
complacent and not stand in the way of big municipal perquisites nor
bite the hands that fed him It was also made perfectly plain to him
that once he was well in office a little money for himself was to be
made As has been indicated he had always been a poor man He had seen
all those who had dabbled in politics to any extent about him heretofore
do very well financially indeed while he pegged along as an insurance
and realestate agent He had worked hard as a small political henchman
Other politicians were building themselves nice homes in newer portions
of the city They were going off to New York or Harrisburg or Washington
on jaunting parties They were seen in happy converse at roadhouses or
country hotels in season with their wives or their women favorites
and he was not as yet of this happy throng Naturally now that he was
promised something he was interested and compliant What might he not
get

When it came to this visit from Mollenhauer with its suggestion
in regard to bringing city loan to par although it bore no obvious
relation to Mollenhauers subsurface connection with Stener through
Strobik and the others Stener did definitely recognize his own
political subserviencehis masters stentorian voiceand immediately
thereafter hurried to Strobik for information

Just what would you do about this he asked of Strobik who knew of
Mollenhauers visit before Stener told him and was waiting for Stener
to speak to him Mr Mollenhauer talks about having this new loan
listed on change and brought to par so that it will sell for one
hundred

Neither Strobik Harmon nor Wycroft knew how the certificates of city
loan which were worth only ninety on the open market were to be made
to sell for one hundred on change but Mollenhauers secretary one
Abner Sengstack had suggested to Strobik that since Butler was dealing
with young Cowperwood and Mollenhauer did not care particularly for his
private broker in this instance it might be as well to try Cowperwood


So it was that Cowperwood was called to Steners office And once there
and not as yet recognizing either the hand of Mollenhauer or Simpson
in this merely looked at the peculiarly shambling heavycheeked
middleclass man before him without either interest or sympathy
realizing at once that he had a financial baby to deal with If he could
act as adviser to this manbe his sole counsel for four years

How do you do Mr Stener he said in his soft ingratiating voice
as the latter held out his hand I am glad to meet you I have heard of
you before of course

Stener was long in explaining to Cowperwood just what his difficulty
was He went at it in a clumsy fashion stumbling through the
difficulties of the situation he was suffered to meet

The main thing as I see it is to make these certificates sell at par
I can issue them in any sized lots you like and as often as you like I
want to get enough now to clear away two hundred thousand dollars worth
of the outstanding warrants and as much more as I can get later

Cowperwood felt like a physician feeling a patients pulsea patient
who is really not sick at all but the reassurance of whom means a fat
fee The abstrusities of the stock exchange were as his A B Cs to him
He knew if he could have this loan put in his handsall of it if he
could have the fact kept dark that he was acting for the city and that
if Stener would allow him to buy as a bull for the sinkingfund while
selling judiciously for a rise he could do wonders even with a big
issue He had to have all of it though in order that he might have
agents under him Looming up in his mind was a scheme whereby he could
make a lot of the unwary speculators about change go short of this
stock or loan under the impression of course that it was scattered
freely in various persons hands and that they could buy as much of it
as they wanted Then they would wake to find that they could not get it
that he had it all Only he would not risk his secret that far Not he
oh no But he would drive the city loan to par and then sell And
what a fat thing for himself among others in so doing Wisely enough
he sensed that there was politics in all thisshrewder and bigger men
above and behind Stener But what of that And how slyly and shrewdly
they were sending Stener to him It might be that his name was becoming
very potent in their political world here And what might that not mean

I tell you what Id like to do Mr Stener he said after he had
listened to his explanation and asked how much of the city loan he would
like to sell during the coming year Ill be glad to undertake it But
Id like to have a day or two in which to think it over

Why certainly certainly Mr Cowperwood replied Stener genially
Thats all right Take your time If you know how it can be done just
show me when youre ready By the way what do you charge

Well the stock exchange has a regular scale of charges which we
brokers are compelled to observe Its onefourth of one per cent on
the par value of bonds and loans Of course I may hav to add a lot of
fictitious sellingIll explain that to you laterbut I wont charge
you anything for that so long as it is a secret between us Ill give
you the best service I can Mr Stener You can depend on that Let me
have a day or two to think it over though

He shook hands with Stener and they parted Cowperwood was satisfied
that he was on the verge of a significant combination and Stener that
he had found someone on whom he could lean





Chapter XV


The plan Cowperwood developed after a few days meditation will be
plain enough to any one who knows anything of commercial and financial
manipulation but a dark secret to those who do not In the first place
the city treasurer was to use his Cowperwoods office as a bank of
deposit He was to turn over to him actually or set over to his credit
on the citys books subject to his order certain amounts of city
loanstwo hundred thousand dollars at first since that was the amount
it was desired to raise quicklyand he would then go into the market
and see what could be done to have it brought to par The city treasurer
was to ask leave of the stock exchange at once to have it listed as
a security Cowperwood would then use his influence to have this
application acted upon quickly Stener was then to dispose of all city
loan certificates through him and him only He was to allow him to buy
for the sinkingfund supposedly such amounts as he might have to buy
in order to keep the price up to par To do this once a considerable
number of the loan certificates had been unloaded on the public it
might be necessary to buy back a great deal However these would be
sold again The law concerning selling only at par would have to be
abrogated to this extentie that the wash sales and preliminary
sales would have to be considered no sales until par was reached

There was a subtle advantage here as Cowperwood pointed out to Stener
In the first place since the certificates were going ultimately to
reach par anyway there was no objection to Stener or any one else
buying low at the opening price and holding for a rise Cowperwood would
be glad to carry him on his books for any amount and he would settle
at the end of each month He would not be asked to buy the certificates
outright He could be carried on the books for a certain reasonable
margin say ten points The money was as good as made for Stener now In
the next place in buying for the sinkingfund it would be possible to
buy these certificates very cheap for having the new and reserve issue
entirely in his hands Cowperwood could throw such amounts as he wished
into the market at such times as he wished to buy and consequently
depress the market Then he could buy and later up would go the
price Having the issues totally in his hands to boost or depress
the market as he wished there was no reason why the city should not
ultimately get par for all its issues and at the same time considerable
money be made out of the manufactured fluctuations He Cowperwood
would be glad to make most of his profit that way The city should allow
him his normal percentage on all his actual sales of certificates for
the city at par he would have to have that in order to keep straight
with the stock exchange but beyond that and for all the other
necessary manipulative sales of which there would be many he would
depend on his knowledge of the stock market to reimburse him And if
Stener wanted to speculate with himwell

Dark as this transaction may seem to the uninitiated it will appear
quite clear to those who know Manipulative tricks have always been
worked in connection with stocks of which one man or one set of men has
had complete control It was no different from what subsequently was
done with Erie Standard Oil Copper Sugar Wheat and what not
Cowperwood was one of the first and one of the youngest to see how it
could be done When he first talked to Stener he was twentyeight years
of age When he last did business with him he was thirtyfour

The houses and the bankfront of Cowperwood  Co had been proceeding
apace The latter was early Florentine in its decorations with windows
which grew narrower as they approached the roof and a door of wrought
iron set between delicately carved posts and a straight lintel of
brownstone It was low in height and distinguished in appearance In
the center panel had been hammered a hand delicately wrought thin and
artistic holding aloft a flaming brand Ellsworth informed him that
this had formerly been a moneychangers sign used in old Venice the
significance of which had long been forgotten

The interior was finished in highlypolished hardwood stained in
imitation of the gray lichens which infest trees Large sheets of clear
beveled glass were used some oval some oblong some square and some
circular following a given theory of eye movement The fixtures for
the gasjets were modeled after the early Roman flamebrackets and the
office safe was made an ornament raised on a marble platform at the
back of the office and lacquered a silvergray with Cowperwood  Co
lettered on it in gold One had a sense of reserve and taste pervading
the place and yet it was also inestimably prosperous solid and
assuring Cowperwood when he viewed it at its completion complimented
Ellsworth cheerily I like this It is really beautiful It will be
a pleasure to work here If those houses are going to be anything like
this they will be perfect

Wait till you see them I think you will be pleased Mr Cowperwood I
am taking especial pains with yours because it is smaller It is
really easier to treat your fathers But yours He went off into a
description of the entrancehall receptionroom and parlor which he
was arranging and decorating in such a way as to give an effect of size
and dignity not really conformable to the actual space

And when the houses were finished they were effective and
arrestingquite different from the conventional residences of the
street They were separated by a space of twenty feet laid out as
greensward The architect had borrowed somewhat from the Tudor
school yet not so elaborated as later became the style in many of the
residences in Philadelphia and elsewhere The most striking features
were rather deeprecessed doorways under wide low slightly floriated
arches and three projecting windows of rich form one on the second
floor of Franks house two on the facade of his fathers There were
six gables showing on the front of the two houses two on Franks and
four on his fathers In the front of each house on the ground floor
was a recessed window unconnected with the recessed doorways formed
by setting the inner external wall back from the outer face of the
building This window looked out through an arched opening to the
street and was protected by a dwarf parapet or balustrade It was
possible to set potted vines and flowers there which was later done
giving a pleasant sense of greenery from the street and to place a few
chairs there which were reached via heavily barred French casements

On the ground floor of each house was placed a conservatory of flowers
facing each other and in the yard which was jointly used a pool of
white marble eight feet in diameter with a marble Cupid upon which jets
of water played The yard which was enclosed by a high but pierced wall
of greengray brick especially burnt for the purpose the same color as
the granite of the house and surmounted by a white marble coping which
was sown to grass and had a lovely smooth velvety appearance The two
houses as originally planned were connected by a low greencolumned
pergola which could be enclosed in glass in winter

The rooms which were now slowly being decorated and furnished in period
styles were very significant in that they enlarged and strengthened
Frank Cowperwoods idea of the world of art in general It was an
enlightening and agreeable experienceone which made for artistic and
intellectual growthto hear Ellsworth explain at length the styles and
types of architecture and furniture the nature of woods and ornaments
employed the qualities and peculiarities of hangings draperies
furniture panels and door coverings Ellsworth was a student of
decoration as well as of architecture and interested in the artistic
taste of the American people which he fancied would some day have a
splendid outcome He was wearied to death of the prevalent Romanesque
composite combinations of country and suburban villa The time was ripe
for something new He scarcely knew what it would be but this that he
had designed for Cowperwood and his father was at least different as
he said while at the same time being reserved simple and pleasing
It was in marked contrast to the rest of the architecture of the street
Cowperwoods diningroom receptionroom conservatory and butlers
pantry he had put on the first floor together with the general
entryhall staircase and coatroom under the stairs For the second
floor he had reserved the library general livingroom parlor and
a small office for Cowperwood together with a boudoir for Lillian
connected with a dressingroom and bath

On the third floor neatly divided and accommodated with baths and
dressingrooms were the nursery the servants quarters and several
guestchambers

Ellsworth showed Cowperwood books of designs containing furniture
hangings etageres cabinets pedestals and some exquisite piano forms
He discussed woods with himrosewood mahogany walnut English
oak birdseye maple and the manufactured effects such as ormolu
marquetry and Boule or buhl He explained the latterhow difficult it
was to produce how unsuitable it was in some respects for this climate
the brass and tortoiseshell inlay coming to swell with the heat or
damp and so bulging or breaking He told of the difficulties and
disadvantages of certain finishes but finally recommended ormolu
furniture for the reception room medallion tapestry for the parlor
French renaissance for the diningroom and library and birdseye maple
dyed blue in one instance and left its natural color in another and
a rather lightly constructed and daintily carved walnut for the
other rooms The hangings wallpaper and floor coverings were to
harmonizenot matchand the piano and musiccabinet for the parlor
as well as the etagere cabinets and pedestals for the receptionrooms
were to be of buhl or marquetry if Frank cared to stand the expense

Ellsworth advised a triangular pianothe square shapes were so
inexpressibly wearisome to the initiated Cowperwood listened
fascinated He foresaw a home which would be chaste soothing and
delightful to look upon If he hung pictures gilt frames were to be the
setting large and deep and if he wished a picturegallery the library
could be converted into that and the general livingroom which lay
between the library and the parlor on the secondfloor could be turned
into a combination library and livingroom This was eventually done
but not until his taste for pictures had considerably advanced

It was now that he began to take a keen interest in objects of art
pictures bronzes little carvings and figurines for his cabinets
pedestals tables and etageres Philadelphia did not offer much that
was distinguished in this realmcertainly not in the open market
There were many private houses which were enriched by travel but his
connection with the best families was as yet small There were then
two famous American sculptors Powers and Hosmer of whose work he had
examples but Ellsworth told him that they were not the last word in
sculpture and that he should look into the merits of the ancients He
finally secured a head of David by Thorwaldsen which delighted him
and some landscapes by Hunt Sully and Hart which seemed somewhat in
the spirit of his new world

The effect of a house of this character on its owner is unmistakable
We think we are individual separate above houses and material objects
generally but there is a subtle connection which makes them reflect us
quite as much as we reflect them They lend dignity subtlety force
each to the other and what beauty or lack of it there is is shot
back and forth from one to the other as a shuttle in a loom weaving
weaving Cut the thread separate a man from that which is rightfully
his own characteristic of him and you have a peculiar figure half
success half failure much as a spider without its web which will
never be its whole self again until all its dignities and emoluments are
restored

The sight of his new house going up made Cowperwood feel of more weight
in the world and the possession of his suddenly achieved connection
with the city treasurer was as though a wide door had been thrown open
to the Elysian fields of opportunity He rode about the city those days
behind a team of spirited bays whose glossy hides and metaled harness
bespoke the watchful care of hostler and coachman Ellsworth was
building an attractive stable in the little side street back of the
houses for the joint use of both families He told Mrs Cowperwood that
he intended to buy her a victoriaas the low open fourwheeled coach
was then knownas soon as they were well settled in their new home and
that they were to go out more There was some talk about the value
of entertainingthat he would have to reach out socially for certain
individuals who were not now known to him Together with Anna his
sister and his two brothers Joseph and Edward they could use the two
houses jointly There was no reason why Anna should not make a splendid
match Joe and Ed might marry well since they were not destined to set
the world on fire in commerce At least it would not hurt them to try

Dont you think you will like that he asked his wife referring to
his plans for entertaining

She smiled wanly I suppose so she said





Chapter XVI


It was not long after the arrangement between Treasurer Stener and
Cowperwood had been made that the machinery for the carrying out of
that politicalfinancial relationship was put in motion The sum of
two hundred and ten thousand dollars in six per cent interestbearing
certificates payable in ten years was set over to the credit of
Cowperwood  Co on the books of the city subject to his order Then
with proper listing he began to offer it in small amounts at more than
ninety at the same time creating the impression that it was going to
be a prosperous investment The certificates gradually rose and were
unloaded in rising amounts until one hundred was reached when all
the two hundred thousand dollars worthtwo thousand certificates in
allwas fed out in small lots Stener was satisfied Two hundred shares
had been carried for him and sold at one hundred which netted him
two thousand dollars It was illegitimate gain unethical but his
conscience was not very much troubled by that He had none truly He
saw visions of a halcyon future

It is difficult to make perfectly clear what a subtle and significant
power this suddenly placed in the hands of Cowperwood Consider that he
was only twentyeightnearing twentynine Imagine yourself by nature
versed in the arts of finance capable of playing with sums of money in
the forms of stocks certificates bonds and cash as the ordinary man
plays with checkers or chess Or better yet imagine yourself one of
those subtle masters of the mysteries of the higher forms of
chessthe type of mind so well illustrated by the famous and historic
chessplayers who could sit with their backs to a group of rivals
playing fourteen men at once calling out all the moves in turn
remembering all the positions of all the men on all the boards and
winning This of course would be an overstatement of the subtlety of
Cowperwood at this time and yet it would not be wholly out of bounds
He knew instinctively what could be done with a given sum of moneyhow
as cash it could be deposited in one place and yet as credit and the
basis of moving checks used in not one but many other places at the
same time When properly watched and followed this manipulation gave him
the constructive and purchasing power of ten and a dozen times as much
as his original sum might have represented He knew instinctively the
principles of pyramiding and kiting He could see exactly not only
how he could raise and lower the value of these certificates of loan
day after day and year after yearif he were so fortunate as to retain
his hold on the city treasurerbut also how this would give him a
credit with the banks hitherto beyond his wildest dreams His fathers
bank was one of the first to profit by this and to extend him loans The
various local politicians and bossesMollenhauer Butler Simpson and
othersseeing the success of his efforts in this direction speculated
in city loan He became known to Mollenhauer and Simpson by reputation
if not personally as the man who was carrying this city loan
proposition to a successful issue Stener was supposed to have done
a clever thing in finding him The stock exchange stipulated that all
trades were to be compared the same day and settled before the close of
the next but this working arrangement with the new city treasurer gave
Cowperwood much more latitude and now he had always until the first of
the month or practically thirty days at times in which to render an
accounting for all deals connected with the loan issue

And moreover this was really not an accounting in the sense of
removing anything from his hands Since the issue was to be so large
the sum at his disposal would always be large and socalled transfers
and balancing at the end of the month would be a mere matter of
bookkeeping He could use these city loan certificates deposited with
him for manipulative purposes deposit them at any bank as collateral
for a loan quite as if they were his own thus raising seventy per
cent of their actual value in cash and he did not hesitate to do so
He could take this cash which need not be accounted for until the end
of the month and cover other stock transactions on which he could
borrow again There was no limit to the resources of which he now found
himself possessed except the resources of his own energy ingenuity
and the limits of time in which he had to work The politicians did not
realize what a bonanza he was making of it all for himself because they
were as yet unaware of the subtlety of his mind When Stener told him
after talking the matter over with the mayor Strobik and others that
he would formally during the course of the year set over on the citys
books all of the two millions in city loan Cowperwood was silentbut
with delight Two millions His to play with He had been called in as
a financial adviser and he had given his advice and it had been taken
Well He was not a man who inherently was troubled with conscientious
scruples At the same time he still believed himself financially honest
He was no sharper or shrewder than any other financiercertainly no
sharper than any other would be if he could

It should be noted here that this proposition of Steners in regard to
city money had no connection with the attitude of the principal leaders
in local politics in regard to streetrailway control which was a new
and intriguing phase of the citys financial life Many of the leading
financiers and financierpoliticians were interested in that For
instance Messrs Mollenhauer Butler and Simpson were interested
in streetrailways separately on their own account There was no
understanding between them on this score If they had thought at all on
the matter they would have decided that they did not want any outsider
to interfere As a matter of fact the streetrailway business in
Philadelphia was not sufficiently developed at this time to suggest to
any one the grand scheme of union which came later Yet in connection
with this new arrangement between Stener and Cowperwood it was Strobik
who now came forward to Stener with an idea of his own All were certain
to make money through Cowperwoodhe and Stener especially What
was amiss therefore with himself and Stener and with Cowperwood as
theiror rather Steners secret representative since Strobik did
not dare to appear in the matterbuying now sufficient streetrailway
shares in some one line to control it and then if he Strobik could
by efforts of his own get the city council to set aside certain streets
for its extension why there you werethey would own it Only later
he proposed to shake Stener out if he could But this preliminary work
had to be done by some one and it might as well be Stener At the
same time as he saw this work had to be done very carefully because
naturally his superiors were watchful and if they found him dabbling in
affairs of this kind to his own advantage they might make it impossible
for him to continue politically in a position where he could help
himself just the same Any outside organization such as a streetrailway
company already in existence had a right to appeal to the city council
for privileges which would naturally further its and the citys growth
and other things being equal these could not be refused It would not
do for him to appear however both as a shareholder and president of
the council But with Cowperwood acting privately for Stener it would be
another thing

The interesting thing about this proposition as finally presented by
Stener for Strobik to Cowperwood was that it raised without appearing
to do so the whole question of Cowperwoods attitude toward the city
administration Although he was dealing privately for Edward Butler as
an agent and with this same plan in mind and although he had never met
either Mollenhauer or Simpson he nevertheless felt that in so far as
the manipulation of the city loan was concerned he was acting for them
On the other hand in this matter of the private streetrailway purchase
which Stener now brought to him he realized from the very beginning by
Steners attitude that there was something untoward in it that Stener
felt he was doing something which he ought not to do

Cowperwood he said to him the first morning he ever broached this
matterit was in Steners office at the old city hall at Sixth and
Chestnut and Stener in view of his oncoming prosperity was feeling
very good indeedisnt there some streetrailway property around town
here that a man could buy in on and get control of if he had sufficient
money

Cowperwood knew that there were such properties His very alert mind
had long since sensed the general opportunities here The omnibuses
were slowly disappearing The best routes were already preempted
Still there were other streets and the city was growing The incoming
population would make great business in the future One could afford to
pay almost any price for the short lines already built if one could wait
and extend the lines into larger and better areas later And already
he had conceived in his own mind the theory of the endless chain
or argeeable formula as it was later termed of buying a certain
property on a longtime payment and issuing stocks or bonds sufficient
not only to pay your seller but to reimburse you for your trouble
to say nothing of giving you a margin wherewith to invest in other
thingsallied properties for instance against which more bonds could
be issued and so on ad infinitum It became an old story later but it
was new at that time and he kept the thought closely to himself None
the less he was glad to have Stener speak of this since streetrailways
were his hobby and he was convinced that he would be a great master of
them if he ever had an opportunity to control them

Why yes George he said noncommittally there are two or three that
offer a good chance if a man had money enough I notice blocks of stock
being offered on change now and then by one person and another It
would be good policy to pick these things up as theyre offered and
then to see later if some of the other stockholders wont want to sell
out Green and Coates now looks like a good proposition to me If I
had three or four hundred thousand dollars that I thought I could put
into that by degrees I would follow it up It only takes about thirty
per cent of the stock of any railroad to control it Most of the shares
are scattered around so far and wide that they never vote and I think
two or three hundred thousand dollars would control that road He
mentioned one other line that might be secured in the same way in the
course of time

Stener meditated Thats a good deal of money he said thoughtfully
Ill talk to you about that some more later And he was off to see
Strobik none the less

Cowperwood knew that Stener did not have any two or three hundred
thousand dollars to invest in anything There was only one way that he
could get itand that was to borrow it out of the city treasury and
forego the interest But he would not do that on his own initiative
Some one else must be behind him and who else other than Mollenhauer
or Simpson or possibly even Butler though he doubted that unless the
triumvirate were secretly working together But what of it The larger
politicians were always using the treasury and he was thinking now
only of his own attitude in regard to the use of this money No harm
could come to him if Steners ventures were successful and there was
no reason why they should not be Even if they were not he would be
merely acting as an agent In addition he saw how in the manipulation
of this money for Stener he could probably eventually control certain
lines for himself

There was one line being laid out to within a few blocks of his new
homethe Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line it was calledwhich
interested him greatly He rode on it occasionally when he was delayed
or did not wish to trouble about a vehicle It ran through two thriving
streets of redbrick houses and was destined to have a great future
once the city grew large enough As yet it was really not long enough
If he could get that for instance and combine it with Butlers lines
once they were securedor Mollenhauers or Simpsons the legislature
could be induced to give them additional franchises He even dreamed of
a combination between Butler Mollenhauer Simpson and himself
Between them politically they could get anything But Butler was not a
philanthropist He would have to be approached with a very sizable bird
in hand The combination must be obviously advisable Besides he was
dealing for Butler in streetrailway stocks and if this particular line
were such a good thing Butler might wonder why it had not been brought
to him in the first place It would be better Frank thought to
wait until he actually had it as his own in which case it would be a
different matter Then he could talk as a capitalist He began to
dream of a citywide streetrailway system controlled by a few men or
preferably himself alone





Chapter XVII


The days that had been passing brought Frank Cowperwood and Aileen
Butler somewhat closer together in spirit Because of the pressure of
his growing affairs he had not paid so much attention to her as he might
have but he had seen her often this past year She was now nineteen and
had grown into some subtle thoughts of her own For one thing she was
beginning to see the difference between good taste and bad taste in
houses and furnishings

Papa why do we stay in this old barn she asked her father one
evening at dinner when the usual family group was seated at the table

Whats the matter with this house Id like to know demanded Butler
who was drawn up close to the table his napkin tucked comfortably under
his chin for he insisted on this when company was not present I dont
see anything the matter with this house Your mother and I manage to
live in it well enough

Oh its terrible papa You know it supplemented Norah who was
seventeen and quite as bright as her sister though a little less
experienced Everybody says so Look at all the nice houses that are
being built everywhere about here

Everybody Everybody Who is everybody Id like to know demanded
Butler with the faintest touch of choler and much humor Im somebody
and I like it Those that dont like it dont have to live in it Who
are they Whats the matter with it Id like to know

The question in just this form had been up a number of times before
and had been handled in just this manner or passed over entirely with a
healthy Irish grin Tonight however it was destined for a little more
extended thought

You know its bad papa corrected Aileen firmly Now whats the use
getting mad about it Its old and cheap and dingy The furniture is all
worn out That old piano in there ought to be given away I wont play
on it any more The Cowperwoods

Old is it exclaimed Butler his accent sharpening somewhat with his
selfinduced rage He almost pronounced it owled Dingy hi Where do
you get that At your convent I suppose And where is it worn Show me
where its worn

He was coming to her reference to Cowperwood but he hadnt reached
that when Mrs Butler interfered She was a stout broadfaced woman
smilingmouthed most of the time with blurry gray Irish eyes and a
touch of red in her hair now modified by grayness Her cheek below the
mouth on the left side was sharply accented by a large wen

Children children Mr Butler for all his commercial and political
responsibility was as much a child to her as any Youse mustnt
quarrel now Come now Give your father the tomatoes

There was an Irish maid serving at table but plates were passed from
one to the other just the same A heavily ornamented chandelier holding
sixteen imitation candles in white porcelain hung low over the table
and was brightly lighted another offense to Aileen

Mama how often have I told you not to say youse pleaded Norah
very much disheartened by her mothers grammatical errors You know you
said you wouldnt

And whos to tell your mother what she should say called Butler more
incensed than ever at this sudden and unwarranted rebellion and assault
Your mother talked before ever you was born Id have you know If it
werent for her workin and slavin you wouldnt have any fine manners
to be paradin before her Id have you know that Shes a better woman
nor any youll be runnin with this day you little baggage you

Mama do you hear what hes calling me complained Norah hugging
close to her mothers arm and pretending fear and dissatisfaction

Eddie Eddie cautioned Mrs Butler pleading with her husband You
know he dont mean that Norah dear Dont you know he dont

She was stroking her babys head The reference to her grammar had not
touched her at all

Butler was sorry that he had called his youngest a baggage but these
childrenGod bless his soulwere a great annoyance Why in the name
of all the saints wasnt this house good enough for them

Why dont you people quit fussing at the table observed Callum a
likely youth with black hair laid smoothly over his forehead in a long
distinguished layer reaching from his left to close to his right ear
and his upper lip carrying a short crisp mustache His nose was short
and retrousse and his ears were rather prominent but he was bright and
attractive He and Owen both realized that the house was old and poorly
arranged but their father and mother liked it and business sense and
family peace dictated silence on this score

Well I think its mean to have to live in this old place when
people not onefourth as good as we are are living in better ones The
Cowperwoodswhy even the Cowperwoods

Yes the Cowperwoods What about the Cowperwoods demanded Butler
turning squarely to Aileenshe was sitting beside himhis big red
face glowing

Why even they have a better house than we have and hes merely an
agent of yours

The Cowperwoods The Cowperwoods Ill not have any talk about the
Cowperwoods Im not takin my rules from the Cowperwoods Suppose they
have a fine house what of it My house is my house I want to live
here Ive lived here too long to be pickin up and movin away If you
dont like it you know what else you can do Move if you want to Ill
not move

It was Butlers habit when he became involved in these family
quarrels which were as shallow as puddles to wave his hands rather
antagonistically under his wifes or his childrens noses

Oh well I will get out one of these days Aileen replied Thank
heaven I wont have to live here forever

There flashed across her mind the beautiful receptionroom library
parlor and boudoirs of the Cowperwoods which were now being arranged
and about which Anna Cowperwood talked to her so muchtheir dainty
lovely triangular grand piano in gold and painted pink and blue Why
couldnt they have things like that Her father was unquestionably a
dozen times as wealthy But no her father whom she loved dearly was
of the old school He was just what people charged him with being a
rough Irish contractor He might be rich She flared up at the injustice
of thingswhy couldnt he have been rich and refined too Then they
could havebut oh what was the use of complaining They would never
get anywhere with her father and mother in charge She would just have
to wait Marriage was the answerthe right marriage But whom was she
to marry

You surely are not going to go on fighting about that now pleaded
Mrs Butler as strong and patient as fate itself She knew where
Aileens trouble lay

But we might have a decent house insisted Aileen Or this one done
over whispered Norah to her mother

Hush now In good time replied Mrs Butler to Norah Wait Well
fix it all up some day sure You run to your lessons now Youve had
enough

Norah arose and left Aileen subsided Her father was simply stubborn
and impossible And yet he was sweet too She pouted in order to compel
him to apologize

Come now he said after they had left the table and conscious of the
fact that his daughter was dissatisfied with him He must do something
to placate her Play me somethin on the piano somethin nice He
preferred showy clattery things which exhibited her skill and muscular
ability and left him wondering how she did it That was what education
was forto enable her to play these very difficult things quickly and
forcefully And you can have a new piano any time you like Go and see
about it This looks pretty good to me but if you dont want it all
right Aileen squeezed his arm What was the use of arguing with her
father What good would a lone piano do when the whole house and
the whole family atmosphere were at fault But she played Schumann
Schubert Offenbach Chopin and the old gentleman strolled to and
fro and mused smiling There was real feeling and a thoughtful
interpretation given to some of these things for Aileen was not without
sentiment though she was so strong vigorous and withal so defiant
but it was all lost on him He looked on her his bright healthy
enticingly beautiful daughter and wondered what was going to become of
her Some rich man was going to many hersome fine rich young man with
good business instinctsand he her father would leave her a lot of
money

There was a reception and a dance to be given to celebrate the
opening of the two Cowperwood homesthe reception to be held in Frank
Cowperwoods residence and the dance later at his fathers The Henry
Cowperwood domicile was much more pretentious the receptionroom
parlor musicroom and conservatory being in this case all on the
ground floor and much larger Ellsworth had arranged it so that those
rooms on occasion could be thrown into one leaving excellent space
for promenade auditorium dancinganything in fact that a large
company might require It had been the intention all along of the two
men to use these houses jointly There was to begin with a combination
use of the various servants the butler gardener laundress and maids
Frank Cowperwood employed a governess for his children The butler was
really not a butler in the best sense He was Henry Cowperwoods private
servitor But he could carve and preside and he could be used in either
house as occasion warranted There was also a hostler and a coachman for
the joint stable When two carriages were required at once both drove
It made a very agreeable and satisfactory working arrangement

The preparation of this reception had been quite a matter of importance
for it was necessary for financial reasons to make it as extensive as
possible and for social reasons as exclusive It was therefore decided
that the afternoon reception at Franks house with its natural overflow
into Henry Ws was to be for allthe Tighes Steners Butlers
Mollenhauers as well as the more select groups to which for instance
belonged Arthur Rivers Mrs Seneca Davis Mr and Mrs Trenor Drake
and some of the younger Drexels and Clarks whom Frank had met It was
not likely that the latter would condescend but cards had to be sent
Later in the evening a less democratic group if possible was to be
entertained albeit it would have to be extended to include the friends
of Anna Mrs Cowperwood Edward and Joseph and any list which Frank
might personally have in mind This was to be the list The best that
could be persuaded commanded or influenced of the young and socially
elect were to be invited here

It was not possible however not to invite the Butlers parents and
children particularly the children for both afternoon and evening
since Cowperwood was personally attracted to Aileen and despite the
fact that the presence of the parents would be most unsatisfactory Even
Aileen as he knew was a little unsatisfactory to Anna and Mrs Frank
Cowperwood and these two when they were together supervising the list
of invitations often talked about it

Shes so hoidenish observed Anna to her sisterinlaw when they
came to the name of Aileen She thinks she knows so much and she isnt
a bit refined Her father Well if I had her father I wouldnt talk so
smart

Mrs Cowperwood who was before her secretaire in her new boudoir
lifted her eyebrows

You know Anna I sometimes wish that Franks business did not compel
me to have anything to do with them Mrs Butler is such a bore She
means well enough but she doesnt know anything And Aileen is too
rough Shes too forward I think She comes over here and plays upon
the piano particularly when Franks here I wouldnt mind so much for
myself but I know it must annoy him All her pieces are so noisy She
never plays anything really delicate and refined

I dont like the way she dresses observed Anna sympathetically
She gets herself up too conspicuously Now the other day I saw her out
driving and oh dear you should have seen her She had on a crimson
Zouave jacket heavily braided with black about the edges and a turban
with a huge crimson feather and crimson ribbons reaching nearly to her
waist Imagine that kind of a hat to drive in And her hands You should
have seen the way she held her handsohjust soselfconsciously
They were curved just soand she showed how She had on yellow
gauntlets and she held the reins in one hand and the whip in the other
She drives just like mad when she drives anyhow and William the
footman was up behind her You should just have seen her Oh dear
oh dear she does think she is so much And Anna giggled half in
reproach half in amusement

I suppose well have to invite her I dont see how we can get out of
it I know just how shell do though Shell walk about and pose and
hold her nose up

Really I dont see how she can commented Anna Now I like Norah
Shes much nicer She doesnt think shes so much

I like Norah too added Mrs Cowperwood Shes really very sweet
and to me shes prettier

Oh indeed I think so too

It was curious though that it was Aileen who commanded nearly all
their attention and fixed their minds on her socalled idiosyncrasies
All they said was in its peculiar way true but in addition the girl was
really beautiful and much above the average intelligence and force She
was running deep with ambition and she was all the more conspicuous
and in a way irritating to some because she reflected in her own
consciousness her social defects against which she was inwardly
fighting She resented the fact that people could justly consider her
parents ineligible and for that reason her also She was intrinsically
as worth while as any one Cowperwood so able and rapidly becoming so
distinguished seemed to realize it The days that had been passing had
brought them somewhat closer together in spirit He was nice to her and
liked to talk to her Whenever he was at her home now or she was at his
and he was present he managed somehow to say a word He would come over
quite near and look at her in a warm friendly fashion

Well Aileenshe could see his genial eyeshow is it with you How
are your father and mother Been out driving Thats fine I saw you
today You looked beautiful

Oh Mr Cowperwood

You did You looked stunning A black ridinghabit becomes you I can
tell your gold hair a long way off

Oh now you mustnt say that to me Youll make me vain My mother and
father tell me Im too vain as it is

Never mind your mother and father I say you looked stunning and you
did You always do

Oh

She gave a little gasp of delight The color mounted to her cheeks and
temples Mr Cowperwood knew of course He was so informed and intensely
forceful And already he was so much admired by so many her own father
and mother included and by Mr Mollenhauer and Mr Simpson so she
heard And his own home and office were so beautiful Besides his quiet
intensity matched her restless force

Aileen and her sister were accordingly invited to the reception but the
Butlers mere and pere were given to understand in as tactful a manner
as possible that the dance afterward was principally for young people

The reception brought a throng of people There were many very many
introductions There were tactful descriptions of little effects Mr
Ellsworth had achieved under rather trying circumstances walks under
the pergola viewings of both homes in detail Many of the guests were
old friends They gathered in the libraries and diningrooms and
talked There was much jesting some slappings of shoulders some good
storytelling and so the afternoon waned into evening and they went
away

Aileen had created an impression in a street costume of dark blue silk
with velvet pelisse to match and trimmed with elaborate pleatings and
shirrings of the same materials A toque of blue velvet with high crown
and one large darkred imitation orchid had given her a jaunty dashing
air Beneath the toque her redgold hair was arranged in an enormous
chignon with one long curl escaping over her collar She was not
exactly as daring as she seemed but she loved to give that impression

You look wonderful Cowperwood said as she passed him

Ill look different tonight was her answer

She had swung herself with a slight swaggering stride into the
diningroom and disappeared Norah and her mother stayed to chat with
Mrs Cowperwood

Well its lovely now isnt it breathed Mrs Butler Sure youll be
happy here Sure you will When Eddie fixed the house were in now says
I Eddie its almost too fine for us altogethersurely it is and he
says says e Norah nothin this side o heavin or beyond is too
good for yeand he kissed me Now what dye think of that fer a big
hulkin gossoon

Its perfectly lovely I think Mrs Butler commented Mrs
Cowperwood a little bit nervous because of others

Mama does love to talk so Come on mama Lets look at the
diningroom It was Norah talking

Well may ye always be happy in it I wish ye that Ive always been
happy in mine May ye always be happy And she waddled goodnaturedly
along

The Cowperwood family dined hastily alone between seven and eight At
nine the evening guests began to arrive and now the throng was of a
different complexiongirls in mauve and creamwhite and salmonpink and
silvergray laying aside lace shawls and loose dolmans and the men in
smooth black helping them Outside in the cold the carriage doors were
slamming and new guests were arriving constantly Mrs Cowperwood stood
with her husband and Anna in the main entrance to the reception room
while Joseph and Edward Cowperwood and Mr and Mrs Henry W Cowperwood
lingered in the background Lillian looked charming in a train gown of
old rose with a low square neck showing a delicate chemisette of fine
lace Her face and figure were still notable though her face was not as
smoothly sweet as it had been years before when Cowperwood had first met
her Anna Cowperwood was not pretty though she could not be said to be
homely She was small and dark with a turnedup nose snapping black
eyes a pert inquisitive intelligent and alas somewhat critical
air She had considerable tact in the matter of dressing Black in
spite of her darkness with shining beads of sequins on it helped her
complexion greatly as did a red rose in her hair She had smooth white
wellrounded arms and shoulders Bright eyes a pert manner clever
remarksthese assisted to create an illusion of charm though as she
often said it was of little use Men want the dolly things

In the evening inpour of young men and women came Aileen and Norah the
former throwing off a thin net veil of black lace and a dolman of black
silk which her brother Owen took from her Norah was with Callum a
straight erect smiling young Irishman who looked as though he might
carve a notable career for himself She wore a short girlish dress that
came to a little below her shoetops a palefigured lavender and white
silk with a fluffy hoopskirt of dainty lacededged ruffles against
which tiny bows of lavender stood out in odd places There was a great
sash of lavender about her waist and in her hair a rosette of the same
color She looked exceedingly winsomeeager and brighteyed

But behind her was her sister in ravishing black satin scaled as a fish
with glistening crimsonedsilver sequins her round smooth arms bare
to the shoulders her corsage cut as low in the front and back as her
daring in relation to her sense of the proprieties permitted She was
naturally of exquisite figure erect fullbreasted with somewhat more
than gently swelling hips which nevertheless melted into lovely
harmonious lines and this lowcut corsage receding back and front into
a deep V above a short gracefully draped overskirt of black tulle
and silver tissue set her off to perfection Her full smooth roundly
modeled neck was enhanced in its creampink whiteness by an inchwide
necklet of black jet cut in many faceted black squares Her complexion
naturally high in tone because of the pink of health was enhanced by
the tiniest speck of black courtplaster laid upon her cheekbone and
her hair heightened in its reddishgold by her dress was fluffed
loosely and adroitly about her eyes The main mass of this treasure was
done in two loose braids caught up in a black spangled net at the back
of her neck and her eyebrows had been emphasized by a pencil into
something almost as significant as her hair She was for the occasion
a little too emphatic perhaps and yet more because of her burning
vitality than of her costume Art for her should have meant subduing
her physical and spiritual significance Life for her meant emphasizing
them

Lillian Anna nudged her sisterinlaw She was grieved to think that
Aileen was wearing black and looked so much better than either of them

I see Lillian replied in a subdued tone

So youre back again She was addressing Aileen Its chilly out
isnt it

I dont mind Dont the rooms look lovely

She was gazing at the softly lighted chambers and the throng before her

Norah began to babble to Anna You know I just thought I never would
get this old thing on She was speaking of her dress Aileen wouldnt
help methe mean thing

Aileen had swept on to Cowperwood and his mother who was near him She
had removed from her arm the black satin ribbon which held her train and
kicked the skirts loose and free Her eyes gleamed almost pleadingly
for all her hauteur like a spirited collies and her even teeth showed
beautifully

Cowperwood understood her precisely as he did any fine spirited
animal

I cant tell you how nice you look he whispered to her familiarly
as though there was an old understanding between them Youre like fire
and song

He did not know why he said this He was not especially poetic He had
not formulated the phrase beforehand Since his first glimpse of her
in the hall his feelings and ideas had been leaping and plunging like
spirited horses This girl made him set his teeth and narrow his eyes
Involuntarily he squared his jaw looking more defiant forceful
efficient as she drew near

But Aileen and her sister were almost instantly surrounded by young men
seeking to be introduced and to write their names on dancecards and
for the time being she was lost to view





Chapter XVIII


The seeds of changesubtle metaphysicalare rooted deeply From the
first mention of the dance by Mrs Cowperwood and Anna Aileen had been
conscious of a desire toward a more effective presentation of herself
than as yet for all her fathers money she had been able to achieve
The company which she was to encounter as she well knew was to be so
much more impressive distinguished than anything she had heretofore
known socially Then too Cowperwood appeared as something more
definite in her mind than he had been before and to save herself she
could not get him out of her consciousness

A vision of him had come to her but an hour before as she was dressing
In a way she had dressed for him She was never forgetful of the times
he had looked at her in an interested way He had commented on her hands
once Today he had said that she looked stunning and she had thought
how easy it would be to impress him tonightto show him how truly
beautiful she was

She had stood before her mirror between eight and nineit was
ninefifteen before she was really readyand pondered over what she
should wear There were two tall pierglasses in her wardrobean unduly
large piece of furnitureand one in her closet door She stood before
the latter looking at her bare arms and shoulders her shapely figure
thinking of the fact that her left shoulder had a dimple and that she
had selected garnet garters decorated with heartshaped silver buckles
The corset could not be made quite tight enough at first and she chided
her maid Kathleen Kelly She studied how to arrange her hair and there
was much ado about that before it was finally adjusted She penciled her
eyebrows and plucked at the hair about her forehead to make it loose
and shadowy She cut black courtplaster with her nailshears and tried
differentsized pieces in different places Finally she found one size
and one place that suited her She turned her head from side to side
looking at the combined effect of her hair her penciled brows her
dimpled shoulder and the black beautyspot If some one man could see
her as she was now some time Which man That thought scurried back
like a frightened rat into its hole She was for all her strength
afraid of the thought of the onethe very deadlythe man

And then she came to the matter of a traingown Kathleen laid out five
for Aileen had come into the joy and honor of these things recently and
she had with the permission of her mother and father indulged
herself to the full She studied a goldenyellow silk with creamlace
shoulderstraps and some gussets of garnet beads in the train that
shimmered delightfully but set it aside She considered favorably a
blackandwhite striped silk of odd gray effect and though she was
sorely tempted to wear it finally let it go There was a maroon dress
with basque and overskirt over white silk a rich creamcolored satin
and then this black sequined gown which she finally chose She tried
on the creamcolored satin first however being in much doubt about it
but her penciled eyes and beautyspot did not seem to harmonize with
it Then she put on the black silk with its glistening crimsonedsilver
sequins and lo it touched her She liked its coquettish drapery of
tulle and silver about the hips The overskirt which was at that time
just coming into fashion though avoided by the more conservative had
been adopted by Aileen with enthusiasm She thrilled a little at the
rustle of this black dress and thrust her chin and nose forward to make
it set right Then after having Kathleen tighten her corsets a little
more she gathered the train over her arm by its trainband and looked
again Something was wanting Oh yes her neck What to wearred
coral It did not look right A string of pearls That would not do
either There was a necklace made of small cameos set in silver which
her mother had purchased and another of diamonds which belonged to her
mother but they were not right Finally her jet necklet which she
did not value very highly came into her mind and oh how lovely it
looked How soft and smooth and glistening her chin looked above it She
caressed her neck affectionately called for her black lace mantilla
her long black silk dolman lined with red and she was ready

The ballroom as she entered was lovely enough The young men and
young women she saw there were interesting and she was not wanting
for admirers The most aggressive of these youthsthe most
forcefulrecognized in this maiden a fillip to life a sting to
existence She was as a honeyjar surrounded by too hungry flies

But it occurred to her as her dancelist was filling up that there was
not much left for Mr Cowperwood if he should care to dance with her

Cowperwood was meditating as he received the last of the guests on the
subtlety of this matter of the sex arrangement of life Two sexes He
was not at all sure that there was any law governing them By comparison
now with Aileen Butler his wife looked rather dull quite too old and
when he was ten years older she would look very much older

Oh yes Ellsworth had made quite an attractive arrangement out of
these two housesbetter than we ever thought he could do He was
talking to Henry Hale Sanderson a young banker He had the advantage
of combining two into one and I think hes done more with my little
one considering the limitations of space than he has with this big
one Fathers has the advantage of size I tell the old gentleman hes
simply built a leanto for me

His father and a number of his cronies were over in the diningroom of
his grand home glad to get away from the crowd He would have to stay
and besides he wanted to Had he better dance with Aileen His wife
cared little for dancing but he would have to dance with her at least
once There was Mrs Seneca Davis smiling at him and Aileen By George
how wonderful What a girl

I suppose your dancelist is full to overflowing Let me see He was
standing before her and she was holding out the little bluebordered
goldmonogrammed booklet An orchestra was playing in the music room
The dance would begin shortly There were delicately constructed
goldtinted chairs about the walls and behind palms

He looked down into her eyesthose excited lifeloving eager eyes

Youre quite full up Let me see Nine ten eleven Well that will be
enough I dont suppose I shall want to dance very much Its nice to be
popular

Im not sure about number three I think thats a mistake You might
have that if you wish

She was falsifying

It doesnt matter so much about him does it

His cheeks flushed a little as he said this

No

Her own flamed

Well Ill see where you are when its called Youre darling Im
afraid of you He shot a level interpretive glance into her eyes then
left Aileens bosom heaved It was hard to breathe sometimes in this
warm air

While he was dancing first with Mrs Cowperwood and later with Mrs
Seneca Davis and still later with Mrs Martyn Walker Cowperwood had
occasion to look at Aileen often and each time that he did so there
swept over him a sense of great vigor there of beautiful if raw
dynamic energy that to him was irresistible and especially so tonight
She was so young She was beautiful this girl and in spite of his
wifes repeated derogatory comments he felt that she was nearer to his
clear aggressive unblinking attitude than any one whom he had yet seen
in the form of woman She was unsophisticated in a way that was plain
and yet in another way it would take so little to make her understand so
much Largeness was the sense he had of hernot physically though she
was nearly as tall as himselfbut emotionally She seemed so intensely
alive She passed close to him a number of times her eyes wide and
smiling her lips parted her teeth agleam and he felt a stirring
of sympathy and companionship for her which he had not previously
experienced She was lovely all of herdelightful

Im wondering if that dance is open now he said to her as he drew
near toward the beginning of the third set She was seated with her
latest admirer in a far corner of the general livingroom a clear floor
now waxed to perfection A few palms here and there made embrasured
parapets of green I hope youll excuse me he added deferentially
to her companion

Surely the latter replied rising

Yes indeed she replied And youd better stay here with me Its
going to begin soon You wont mind she added giving her companion a
radiant smile

Not at all Ive had a lovely waltz He strolled off

Cowperwood sat down Thats young Ledoux isnt it I thought so I saw
you dancing You like it dont you

Im crazy about it

Well I cant say that myself Its fascinating though Your partner
makes such a difference Mrs Cowperwood doesnt like it as much as I
do

His mention of Lillian made Aileen think of her in a faintly derogative
way for a moment

I think you dance very well I watched you too She questioned
afterwards whether she should have said this It sounded most forward
nowalmost brazen

Oh did you

Yes

He was a little keyed up because of herslightly cloudy in his
thoughtsbecause she was generating a problem in his life or would
if he let her and so his talk was a little tame He was thinking of
something to saysome words which would bring them a little nearer
together But for the moment he could not Truth to tell he wanted to
say a great deal

Well that was nice of you he added after a moment What made you
do it

He turned with a mock air of inquiry The music was beginning again The
dancers were rising He arose

He had not intended to give this particular remark a serious turn but
now that she was so near him he looked into her eyes steadily but with
a soft appeal and said Yes why

They had come out from behind the palms He had put his hand to her
waist His right arm held her left extended arm to arm palm to palm
Her right hand was on his shoulder and she was close to him looking
into his eyes As they began the gay undulations of the waltz she looked
away and then down without answering Her movements were as light
and airy as those of a butterfly He felt a sudden lightness himself
communicated as by an invisible current He wanted to match the
suppleness of her body with his own and did Her arms the flash and
glint of the crimson sequins against the smooth black silk of her
closely fitting dress her neck her glowing radiant hair all combined
to provoke a slight intellectual intoxication She was so vigorously
young so to him truly beautiful

But you didnt answer he continued

Isnt this lovely music

He pressed her fingers

She lifted shy eyes to him now for in spite of her gay aggressive
force she was afraid of him His personality was obviously so
dominating Now that he was so close to her dancing she conceived
of him as something quite wonderful and yet she experienced a nervous
reactiona momentary desire to run away

Very well if you wont tell me he smiled mockingly

He thought she wanted him to talk to her so to tease her with
suggestions of this concealed feeling of histhis strong liking He
wondered what could come of any such understanding as this anyhow

Oh I just wanted to see how you danced she said tamely the force
of her original feeling having been weakened by a thought of what she
was doing He noted the change and smiled It was lovely to be dancing
with her He had not thought mere dancing could hold such charm

You like me he said suddenly as the music drew to its close

She thrilled from head to toe at the question A piece of ice dropped
down her back could not have startled her more It was apparently
tactless and yet it was anything but tactless She looked up quickly
directly but his strong eyes were too much for her

Why yes she answered as the music stopped trying to keep an even
tone to her voice She was glad they were walking toward a chair

I like you so much he said that I have been wondering if you really
like me There was an appeal in his voice soft and gentle His manner
was almost sad

Why yes she replied instantly returning to her earlier mood toward
him You know I do

I need some one like you to like me he continued in the same vein
I need some one like you to talk to I didnt think so beforebut now
I do You are beautifulwonderful

We mustnt she said I mustnt I dont know what Im doing
She looked at a young man strolling toward her and asked I have to
explain to him Hes the one I had this dance with

Cowperwood understood He walked away He was quite warm and tense
nowalmost nervous It was quite clear to him that he had done or was
contemplating perhaps a very treacherous thing Under the current code
of society he had no right to do it It was against the rules as
they were understood by everybody Her father for instancehis
fatherevery one in this particular walk of life However much
breaking of the rules under the surface of things there might be the
rules were still there As he had heard one young man remark once at
school when some story had been told of a boy leading a girl astray and
to a disastrous end That isnt the way at all

Still now that he had said this strong thoughts of her were in his
mind And despite his involved social and financial position which he
now recalled it was interesting to him to see how deliberately and even
calculatinglyand worse enthusiasticallyhe was pumping the bellows
that tended only to heighten the flames of his desire for this girl to
feed a fire that might ultimately consume himand how deliberately and
resourcefully

Aileen toyed aimlessly with her fan as a blackhaired thinfaced young
law student talked to her and seeing Norah in the distance she asked to
be allowed to run over to her

Oh Aileen called Norah Ive been looking for you everywhere Where
have you been

Dancing of course Where do you suppose Ive been Didnt you see me
on the floor

No I didnt complained Norah as though it were most essential that
she should How late are you going to stay

Until its over I suppose I dont know

Owen says hes going at twelve

Well that doesnt matter Some one will take me home Are you having a
good time

Fine Oh let me tell you I stepped on a ladys dress over there last
dance She was terribly angry She gave me such a look

Well never mind honey She wont hurt you Where are you going now

Aileen always maintained a most guardianlike attitude toward her
sister

I want to find Callum He has to dance with me next time I know what
hes trying to do Hes trying to get away from me But he wont

Aileen smiled Norah looked very sweet And she was so bright What
would she think of her if she knew She turned back and her fourth
partner sought her She began talking gayly for she felt that she had
to make a show of composure but all the while there was ringing in her
ears that definite question of his You like me dont you and her
later uncertain but not less truthful answer Yes of course I do





Chapter XIX


The growth of a passion is a very peculiar thing In highly organized
intellectual and artistic types it is so often apt to begin with
keen appreciation of certain qualities modified by many many mental
reservations The egoist the intellectual gives but little of himself
and asks much Nevertheless the lover of life male or female finding
himself or herself in sympathetic accord with such a nature is apt to
gain much

Cowperwood was innately and primarily an egoist and intellectual though
blended strongly therewith was a humane and democratic spirit We think
of egoism and intellectualism as closely confined to the arts Finance
is an art And it presents the operations of the subtlest of the
intellectuals and of the egoists Cowperwood was a financier Instead
of dwelling on the works of nature its beauty and subtlety to his
material disadvantage he found a happy mean owing to the swiftness
of his intellectual operations whereby he could intellectually and
emotionally rejoice in the beauty of life without interfering with his
perpetual material and financial calculations And when it came to women
and morals which involved so much relating to beauty happiness a
sense of distinction and variety in living he was but now beginning
to suspect for himself at least that apart from maintaining organized
society in its present form there was no basis for this onelife
onelove idea How had it come about that so many people agreed on this
single point that it was good and necessary to marry one woman and
cleave to her until death He did not know It was not for him to bother
about the subtleties of evolution which even then was being noised
abroad or to ferret out the curiosities of history in connection with
this matter He had no time Suffice it that the vagaries of temperament
and conditions with which he came into immediate contact proved to him
that there was great dissatisfaction with that idea People did not
cleave to each other until death and in thousands of cases where
they did they did not want to Quickness of mind subtlety of idea
fortuitousness of opportunity made it possible for some people to right
their matrimonial and social infelicities whereas for others because
of dullness of wit thickness of comprehension poverty and lack of
charm there was no escape from the slough of their despond They
were compelled by some devilish accident of birth or lack of force
or resourcefulness to stew in their own juice of wretchedness or to
shuffle off this mortal coilwhich under other circumstances had such
glittering possibilitiesvia the rope the knife the bullet or the
cup of poison

I would die too he thought to himself one day reading of a man
who confined by disease and poverty had lived for twelve years alone
in a back bedroom attended by an old and probably decrepit housekeeper
A darningneedle forced into his heart had ended his earthly woes To
the devil with such a life Why twelve years Why not at the end of the
second or third

Again it was so very evident in so many ways that force was the
answergreat mental and physical force Why these giants of commerce
and money could do as they pleased in this life and did He had already
had ample local evidence of it in more than one direction Worsethe
little guardians of socalled law and morality the newspapers the
preachers the police and the public moralists generally so loud in
their denunciation of evil in humble places were cowards all when it
came to corruption in high ones They did not dare to utter a feeble
squeak until some giant had accidentally fallen and they could do
so without danger to themselves Then O Heavens the palaver
What beatings of tomtoms What mouthings of pharisaical
moralitiesplatitudes Run now good people for you may see clearly
how evil is dealt with in high places It made him smile Such
hypocrisy Such cant Still so the world was organized and it was not
for him to set it right Let it wag as it would The thing for him to
do was to get rich and hold his ownto build up a seeming of virtue and
dignity which would pass muster for the genuine thing Force would do
that Quickness of wit And he had these I satisfy myself was his
motto and it might well have been emblazoned upon any coat of arms
which he could have contrived to set forth his claim to intellectual and
social nobility

But this matter of Aileen was up for consideration and solution at this
present moment and because of his forceful determined character he
was presently not at all disturbed by the problem it presented It was
a problem like some of those knotty financial complications which
presented themselves daily but it was not insoluble What did he want
to do He couldnt leave his wife and fly with Aileen that was certain
He had too many connections He had too many social and thinking of his
children and parents emotional as well as financial ties to bind him
Besides he was not at all sure that he wanted to He did not intend to
leave his growing interests and at the same time he did not intend to
give up Aileen immediately The unheralded manifestation of interest
on her part was too attractive Mrs Cowperwood was no longer what
she should be physically and mentally and that in itself to him was
sufficient to justify his present interest in this girl Why fear
anything if only he could figure out a way to achieve it without harm
to himself At the same time he thought it might never be possible for
him to figure out any practical or protective program for either himself
or Aileen and that made him silent and reflective For by now he was
intensely drawn to her as he could feelsomething chemic and hence
dynamic was uppermost in him now and clamoring for expression

At the same time in contemplating his wife in connection with all
this he had many qualms some emotional some financial While she had
yielded to his youthful enthusiasm for her after her husbands death
he had only since learned that she was a natural conservator of public
moralsthe cold purity of the snowdrift in so far as the world might
see combined at times with the murky mood of the wanton And yet as he
had also learned she was ashamed of the passion that at times swept and
dominated her This irritated Cowperwood as it would always irritate
any strong acquisitive directseeing temperament While he had no
desire to acquaint the whole world with his feelings why should there
be concealment between them or at least mental evasion of a fact which
physically she subscribed to Why do one thing and think another To be
sure she was devoted to him in her quiet way not passionately as
he looked back he could not say that she had ever been that but
intellectually Duty as she understood it played a great part in this
She was dutiful And then what people thought what the timespirit
demandedthese were the great things Aileen on the contrary was
probably not dutiful and it was obvious that she had no temperamental
connection with current convention No doubt she had been as well
instructed as many another girl but look at her She was not obeying
her instructions

In the next three months this relationship took on a more flagrant form
Aileen knowing full well what her parents would think how unspeakable
in the mind of the current world were the thoughts she was thinking
persisted nevertheless in so thinking and longing Cowperwood now
that she had gone thus far and compromised herself in intention if not
in deed took on a peculiar charm for her It was not his bodygreat
passion is never that exactly The flavor of his spirit was what
attracted and compelled like the glow of a flame to a moth There was
a light of romance in his eyes which however governed and
controlledwas directive and almost allpowerful to her

When he touched her hand at parting it was as though she had received
an electric shock and she recalled that it was very difficult for her
to look directly into his eyes Something akin to a destructive force
seemed to issue from them at times Other people men particularly
found it difficult to face Cowperwoods glazed stare It was as though
there were another pair of eyes behind those they saw watching through
thin obscuring curtains You could not tell what he was thinking

And during the next few months she found herself coming closer and
closer to Cowperwood At his home one evening seated at the piano no
one else being present at the moment he leaned over and kissed her
There was a cold snowy street visible through the interstices of the
hangings of the windows and gaslamps flickering outside He had come
in early and hearing Aileen he came to where she was seated at the
piano She was wearing a rough gray wool cloth dress ornately banded
with fringed Oriental embroidery in blue and burntorange and her
beauty was further enhanced by a gray hat planned to match her dress
with a plume of shaded orange and blue On her fingers were four or
five rings far too manyan opal an emerald a ruby and a
diamondflashing visibly as she played

She knew it was he without turning He came beside her and she looked
up smiling the reverie evoked by Schubert partly vanishingor melting
into another mood Suddenly he bent over and pressed his lips firmly
to hers His mustache thrilled her with its silky touch She stopped
playing and tried to catch her breath for strong as she was it
affected her breathing Her heart was beating like a triphammer She did
not say Oh or You mustnt but rose and walked over to a window
where she lifted a curtain pretending to look out She felt as though
she might faint so intensely happy was she

Cowperwood followed her quickly Slipping his arms about her waist he
looked at her flushed cheeks her clear moist eyes and red mouth

You love me he whispered stern and compelling because of his desire

Yes Yes You know I do

He crushed her face to his and she put up her hands and stroked his
hair

A thrilling sense of possession mastery happiness and understanding
love of her and of her body suddenly overwhelmed him

I love you he said as though he were surprised to hear himself say
it I didnt think I did but I do Youre beautiful Im wild about
you

And I love you she answered I cant help it I know I shouldnt
butoh Her hands closed tight over his ears and temples She put her
lips to his and dreamed into his eyes Then she stepped away quickly
looking out into the street and he walked back into the livingroom
They were quite alone He was debating whether he should risk anything
further when Norah having been in to see Anna next door appeared and
not long afterward Mrs Cowperwood Then Aileen and Norah left





Chapter XX


This definite and final understanding having been reached it was
but natural that this liaison should proceed to a closer and closer
relationship Despite her religious upbringing Aileen was decidedly a
victim of her temperament Current religious feeling and belief could
not control her For the past nine or ten years there had been slowly
forming in her mind a notion of what her lover should be like He should
be strong handsome direct successful with clear eyes a ruddy glow
of health and a certain native understanding and sympathya love of
life which matched her own Many young men had approached her Perhaps
the nearest realization of her ideal was Father David of St Timothys
and he was of course a priest and sworn to celibacy No word had ever
passed between them but he had been as conscious of her as she of him
Then came Frank Cowperwood and by degrees because of his presence and
contact he had been slowly built up in her mind as the ideal person
She was drawn as planets are drawn to their sun

It is a question as to what would have happened if antagonistic forces
could have been introduced just at this time Emotions and liaisons of
this character can of course occasionally be broken up and destroyed
The characters of the individuals can be modified or changed to a
certain extent but the force must be quite sufficient Fear is a great
deterrentfear of material loss where there is no spiritual dreadbut
wealth and position so often tend to destroy this dread It is so easy
to scheme with means Aileen had no spiritual dread whatever Cowperwood
was without spiritual or religious feeling He looked at this girl
and his one thought was how could he so deceive the world that he could
enjoy her love and leave his present state undisturbed Love her he did
surely

Business necessitated his calling at the Butlers quite frequently and
on each occasion he saw Aileen She managed to slip forward and squeeze
his hand the first time he cameto steal a quick vivid kiss and
another time as he was going out she suddenly appeared from behind the
curtains hanging at the parlor door

Honey

The voice was soft and coaxing He turned giving her a warning nod in
the direction of her fathers room upstairs

She stood there holding out one hand and he stepped forward for a
second Instantly her arms were about his neck as he slipped his about
her waist

I long to see you so

I too Ill fix some way Im thinking

He released her arms and went out and she ran to the window and looked
out after him He was walking west on the street for his house was only
a few blocks away and she looked at the breadth of his shoulders the
balance of his form He stepped so briskly so incisively Ah this was
a man He was her Frank She thought of him in that light already Then
she sat down at the piano and played pensively until dinner

And it was so easy for the resourceful mind of Frank Cowperwood wealthy
as he was to suggest ways and means In his younger gallivantings about
places of ill repute and his subsequent occasional variations from the
straight and narrow path he had learned much of the curious resources
of immorality Being a city of five hundred thousand and more at this
time Philadelphia had its nondescript hotels where one might go
cautiously and fairly protected from observation and there were houses
of a conservative residential character where appointments might be
made for a consideration And as for safeguards against the production
of new lifethey were not mysteries to him any longer He knew all
about them Care was the point of caution He had to be cautious for
he was so rapidly coming to be an influential and a distinguished man
Aileen of course was not conscious except in a vague way of the
drift of her passion the ultimate destiny to which this affection might
lead was not clear to her Her craving was for loveto be fondled and
caressedand she really did not think so much further Further thoughts
along this line were like rats that showed their heads out of dark holes
in shadowy corners and scuttled back at the least sound And anyhow
all that was to be connected with Cowperwood would be beautiful She
really did not think that he loved her yet as he should but he would
She did not know that she wanted to interfere with the claims of his
wife She did not think she did But it would not hurt Mrs Cowperwood
if Frank loved herAileenalso

How shall we explain these subtleties of temperament and desire Life
has to deal with them at every turn They will not down and the large
placid movements of nature outside of mans little organisms would
indicate that she is not greatly concerned We see much punishment in
the form of jails diseases failures and wrecks but we also see that
the old tendency is not visibly lessened Is there no law outside of the
subtle will and power of the individual to achieve If not it is surely
high time that we knew itone and all We might then agree to do as we
do but there would be no silly illusion as to divine regulation Vox
populi vox Dei

So there were other meetings lovely hours which they soon began to
spend the moment her passion waxed warm enough to assure compliance
without great fear and without thought of the deadly risk involved From
odd moments in his own home stolen when there was no one about to see
they advanced to clandestine meetings beyond the confines of the city
Cowperwood was not one who was temperamentally inclined to lose his head
and neglect his business As a matter of fact the more he thought of
this rather unexpected affectional development the more certain he was
that he must not let it interfere with his business time and judgment
His office required his full attention from nine until three anyhow He
could give it until fivethirty with profit but he could take several
afternoons off from threethirty until fivethirty or six and no one
would be the wiser It was customary for Aileen to drive alone almost
every afternoon a spirited pair of bays or to ride a mount bought
by her father for her from a noted horsedealer in Baltimore Since
Cowperwood also drove and rode it was not difficult to arrange
meetingplaces far out on the Wissahickon or the Schuylkill road There
were many spots in the newly laidout park which were as free from
interruption as the depths of a forest It was always possible that
they might encounter some one but it was also always possible to make a
rather plausible explanation or none at all since even in case of such
an encounter nothing ordinarily would be suspected

So for the time being there was lovemaking the usual billing and
cooing of lovers in a simple and much less than final fashion and the
lovely horseback rides together under the green trees of the approaching
spring were idyllic Cowperwood awakened to a sense of joy in life such
as he fancied in the blush of this new desire he had never experienced
before Lillian had been lovely in those early days in which he had
first called on her in North Front Street and he had fancied himself
unspeakably happy at that time but that was nearly ten years since
and he had forgotten Since then he had had no great passion no notable
liaison and then all at once in the midst of his new great business
prosperity Aileen Her young body and soul her passionate illusions
He could see always for all her daring that she knew so little of the
calculating brutal world with which he was connected Her father had
given her all the toys she wanted without stint her mother and brothers
had coddled her particularly her mother Her young sister thought she
was adorable No one imagined for one moment that Aileen would ever do
anything wrong She was too sensible after all too eager to get up
in the world Why should she when her life lay open and happy before
hera delightful lovematch some day soon with some very eligible and
satisfactory lover

When you marry Aileen her mother used to say to her well have a
grand time here Sure well do the house over then if we dont do it
before Eddie will have to fix it up or Ill do it meself Never fear

Yeswell Id rather youd fix it now was her reply

Butler himself used to strike her jovially on the shoulder in a rough
loving way and ask Well have you found him yet or Is he hanging
around the outside watchin for ye

If she said No he would reply Well he will be never fearworse
luck Ill hate to see ye go girlie You can stay here as long as ye
want to and ye want to remember that you can always come back

Aileen paid very little attention to this bantering She loved her
father but it was all such a matter of course It was the commonplace
of her existence and not so very significant though delightful enough

But how eagerly she yielded herself to Cowperwood under the spring trees
these days She had no sense of that ultimate yielding that was coming
for now he merely caressed and talked to her He was a little doubtful
about himself His growing liberties for himself seemed natural enough
but in a sense of fairness to her he began to talk to her about what
their love might involve Would she Did she understand This phase of
it puzzled and frightened Aileen a little at first She stood before him
one afternoon in her black ridinghabit and high silk ridinghat perched
jauntily on her redgold hair and striking her ridingskirt with her
short whip pondering doubtfully as she listened He had asked her
whether she knew what she was doing Whither they were drifting If
she loved him truly enough The two horses were tethered in a thicket a
score of yards away from the main road and from the bank of a tumbling
stream which they had approached She was trying to discover if she
could see them It was pretense There was no interest in her glance
She was thinking of him and the smartness of his habit and the
exquisiteness of this moment He had such a charming calico pony The
leaves were just enough developed to make a diaphanous lacework of
green It was like looking through a greenspangled arras to peer into
the woods beyond or behind The gray stones were already faintly
messy where the water rippled and sparkled and early birds were
callingrobins and blackbirds and wrens

Baby mine he said do you understand all about this Do you know
exactly what youre doing when you come with me this way

I think I do

She struck her boot and looked at the ground and then up through the
trees at the blue sky

Look at me honey

I dont want to

But look at me sweet I want to ask you something

Dont make me Frank please I cant

Oh yes you can look at me

No

She backed away as he took her hands but came forward again easily
enough

Now look in my eyes

I cant

See here

I cant Dont ask me Ill answer you but dont make me look at you

His hand stole to her cheek and fondled it He petted her shoulder and
she leaned her head against him

Sweet youre so beautiful he said finally I cant give you up I
know what I ought to do You know too I suppose but I cant I must
have you If this should end in exposure it would be quite bad for you
and me Do you understand

Yes

I dont know your brothers very well but from looking at them I judge
theyre pretty determined people They think a great deal of you

Indeed they do Her vanity prinked slightly at this

They would probably want to kill me and very promptly for just this
much What do you think they would want to do ifwell if anything
should happen some time

He waited watching her pretty face

But nothing need happen We neednt go any further

Aileen

I wont look at you You neednt ask I cant

Aileen Do you mean that

I dont know Dont ask me Frank

You know it cant stop this way dont you You know it This isnt
the end Now if He explained the whole theory of illicit meetings
calmly dispassionately You are perfectly safe except for one thing
chance exposure It might just so happen and then of course there
would be a great deal to settle for Mrs Cowperwood would never give me
a divorce she has no reason to If I should clean up in the way I hope
toif I should make a millionI wouldnt mind knocking off now I
dont expect to work all my days I have always planned to knock off at
thirtyfive Ill have enough by that time Then I want to travel It
will only be a few more years now If you were freeif your father
and mother were deadcuriously she did not wince at this practical
referenceit would be a different matter

He paused She still gazed thoughtfully at the water below her mind
running out to a yacht on the sea with him a palace somewherejust
they two Her eyes half closed saw this happy world and listening to
him she was fascinated

Hanged if I see the way out of this exactly But I love you He
caught her to him I love youlove you

Oh yes she replied intensely I want you to Im not afraid

Ive taken a house in North Tenth Street he said finally as they
walked over to the horses and mounted them It isnt furnished yet but
it will be soon I know a woman who will take charge

Who is she

An interesting widow of nearly fifty Very intelligentshe is
attractive and knows a good deal of life I found her through an
advertisement You might call on her some afternoon when things are
arranged and look the place over You neednt meet her except in a
casual way Will you

She rode on thinking making no reply He was so direct and practical
in his calculations

Will you It will be all right You might know her She isnt
objectionable in any way Will you

Let me know when it is ready was all she said finally





Chapter XXI


The vagaries of passion Subtleties Risks What sacrifices are not
laid willfully upon its altar In a little while this more than average
residence to which Cowperwood had referred was prepared solely to
effect a satisfactory method of concealment The house was governed by
a seemingly recentlybereaved widow and it was possible for Aileen to
call without seeming strangely out of place In such surroundings and
under such circumstances it was not difficult to persuade her to
give herself wholly to her lover governed as she was by her wild and
unreasoning affection and passion In a way there was a saving element
of love for truly above all others she wanted this man She had no
thought or feeling toward any other All her mind ran toward visions of
the future when somehow she and he might be together for all time
Mrs Cowperwood might die or he might run away with her at thirtyfive
when he had a million Some adjustment would be made somehow Nature
had given her this man She relied on him implicitly When he told her
that he would take care of her so that nothing evil should befall she
believed him fully Such sins are the commonplaces of the confessional

It is a curious fact that by some subtlety of logic in the Christian
world it has come to be believed that there can be no love outside the
conventional process of courtship and marriage One life one love is
the Christian idea and into this sluice or mold it has been endeavoring
to compress the whole world Pagan thought held no such belief A
writing of divorce for trivial causes was the theory of the elders and
in the primeval world nature apparently holds no scheme for the unity of
two beyond the temporary care of the young That the modern home is
the most beautiful of schemes when based upon mutual sympathy and
understanding between two need not be questioned And yet this fact
should not necessarily carry with it a condemnation of all love not so
fortunate as to find so happy a denouement Life cannot be put into
any mold and the attempt might as well be abandoned at once Those
so fortunate as to find harmonious companionship for life should
congratulate themselves and strive to be worthy of it Those not
so blessed though they be written down as pariahs have yet some
justification And besides whether we will or not theory or no
theory the basic facts of chemistry and physics remain Like is drawn
to like Changes in temperament bring changes in relationship Dogma may
bind some minds fear others But there are always those in whom the
chemistry and physics of life are large and in whom neither dogma nor
fear is operative Society lifts its hands in horror but from age
to age the Helens the Messalinas the Du Barrys the Pompadours the
Maintenons and the Nell Gwyns flourish and point a freer basis of
relationship than we have yet been able to square with our lives

These two felt unutterably bound to each other Cowperwood once he came
to understand her fancied that he had found the one person with whom he
could live happily the rest of his life She was so young so confident
so hopeful so undismayed All these months since they had first begun
to reach out to each other he had been hourly contrasting her with his
wife As a matter of fact his dissatisfaction though it may be said to
have been faint up to this time was now surely tending to become real
enough Still his children were pleasing to him his home beautiful
Lillian phlegmatic and now thin was still not homely All these years
he had found her satisfactory enough but now his dissatisfaction with
her began to increase She was not like Aileennot young not vivid
not as unschooled in the commonplaces of life And while ordinarily he
was not one who was inclined to be querulous still now on occasion
he could be He began by asking questions concerning his wifes
appearanceirritating little whys which are so trivial and yet so
exasperating and discouraging to a woman Why didnt she get a mauve
hat nearer the shade of her dress Why didnt she go out more Exercise
would do her good Why didnt she do this and why didnt she do that
He scarcely noticed that he was doing this but she did and she felt
the undertonethe real significanceand took umbrage

Oh whywhy she retorted one day curtly Why do you ask so many
questions You dont care so much for me any more thats why I can
tell

He leaned back startled by the thrust It had not been based on any
evidence of anything save his recent remarks but he was not absolutely
sure He was just the least bit sorry that he had irritated her and he
said so

Oh its all right she replied I dont care But I notice that you
dont pay as much attention to me as you used to Its your business
now first last and all the time You cant get your mind off of
that

He breathed a sigh of relief She didnt suspect then

But after a little time as he grew more and more in sympathy with
Aileen he was not so disturbed as to whether his wife might suspect
or not He began to think on occasion as his mind followed the various
ramifications of the situation that it would be better if she did She
was really not of the contentious fighting sort He now decided because
of various calculations in regard to her character that she might not
offer as much resistance to some ultimate rearrangement as he had
originally imagined She might even divorce him Desire dreams even
in him were evoking calculations not as sound as those which ordinarily
generated in his brain

No as he now said to himself the rub was not nearly so much in his own
home as it was in the Butler family His relations with Edward Malia
Butler had become very intimate He was now advising with him constantly
in regard to the handling of his securities which were numerous
Butler held stocks in such things as the Pennsylvania Coal Company
the Delaware and Hudson Canal the Morris and Essex Canal the Reading
Railroad As the old gentlemans mind had broadened to the significance
of the local streetrailway problem in Philadelphia he had decided to
close out his other securities at such advantageous terms as he could
and reinvest the money in local lines He knew that Mollenhauer
and Simpson were doing this and they were excellent judges of the
significance of local affairs Like Cowperwood he had the idea that if
he controlled sufficient of the local situation in this field he
could at last effect a joint relationship with Mollenhauer and Simpson
Political legislation advantageous to the combined lines could then
be so easily secured Franchises and necessary extensions to existing
franchises could be added This conversion of his outstanding stock
in other fields and the picking up of odd lots in the local
streetrailway was the business of Cowperwood Butler through his
sons Owen and Callum was also busy planning a new line and obtaining a
franchise sacrificing of course great blocks of stock and actual cash
to others in order to obtain sufficient influence to have the necessary
legislation passed Yet it was no easy matter seeing that others knew
what the general advantages of the situation were and because of this
Cowperwood who saw the great source of profit here was able betimes
to serve himselfbuying blocks a part of which only went to Butler
Mollenhauer or others In short he was not as eager to serve Butler or
any one else as he was to serve himself if he could

In this connection the scheme which George W Stener had brought
forward representing actually in the background Strobik Wycroft and
Harmon was an opening wedge for himself Steners plan was to loan him
money out of the city treasury at two per cent or if he would waive
all commissions for nothing an agent for selfprotective purposes
was absolutely necessary and with it take over the North Pennsylvania
Companys line on Front Street which because of the shortness of its
length one mile and a half and the brevity of the duration of its
franchise was neither doing very well nor being rated very high
Cowperwood in return for his manipulative skill was to have a fair
proportion of the stocktwenty per cent Strobik and Wycroft knew the
parties from whom the bulk of the stock could be secured if engineered
properly Their plan was then with this borrowed treasury money to
extend its franchise and then the line itself and then later again by
issuing a great block of stock and hypothecating it with a favored bank
be able to return the principal to the city treasury and pocket their
profits from the line as earned There was no trouble in this in so far
as Cowperwood was concerned except that it divided the stock very badly
among these various individuals and left him but a comparatively small
sharefor his thought and pains

But Cowperwood was an opportunist And by this time his financial
morality had become special and local in its character He did not think
it was wise for any one to steal anything from anybody where the act of
taking or profiting was directly and plainly considered stealing
That was unwisedangeroushence wrong There were so many situations
wherein what one might do in the way of taking or profiting was open
to discussion and doubt Morality varied in his mind at least with
conditions if not climates Here in Philadelphia the tradition
politically mind younot generally was that the city treasurer might
use the money of the city without interest so long as he returned the
principal intact The city treasury and the city treasurer were like
a honeyladen hive and a queen bee around which the dronesthe
politiciansswarmed in the hope of profit The one disagreeable thing
in connection with this transaction with Stener was that neither Butler
Mollenhauer nor Simpson who were the actual superiors of Stener and
Strobik knew anything about it Stener and those behind him were
through him acting for themselves If the larger powers heard of this
it might alienate them He had to think of this Still if he refused
to make advantageous deals with Stener or any other man influential in
local affairs he was cutting off his nose to spite his face for other
bankers and brokers would and gladly And besides it was not at all
certain that Butler Mollenhauer and Simpson would ever hear

In this connection there was another line which he rode on
occasionally the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line which he felt
was a much more interesting thing for him to think about if he could
raise the money It had been originally capitalized for five hundred
thousand dollars but there had been a series of bonds to the value of
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars added for improvements and the
company was finding great difficulty in meeting the interest The bulk
of the stock was scattered about among small investors and it would
require all of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to collect it and
have himself elected president or chairman of the board of directors
Once in however he could vote this stock as he pleased hypothecating
it meanwhile at his fathers bank for as much as he could get and
issuing more stocks with which to bribe legislators in the matter of
extending the line and in taking up other opportunities to either
add to it by purchase or supplement it by working agreements The
word bribe is used here in this matteroffact American way because
bribery was what was in every ones mind in connection with the State
legislature Terrence Relihanthe small darkfaced Irishman a
dandy in dress and mannerswho represented the financial interests at
Harrisburg and who had come to Cowperwood after the five million bond
deal had been printed had told him that nothing could be done at the
capital without money or its equivalent negotiable securities Each
significant legislator if he yielded his vote or his influence must be
looked after If he Cowperwood had any scheme which he wanted handled
at any time Relihan had intimated to him that he would be glad to talk
with him Cowperwood had figured on this Seventeenth and Nineteenth
Street line scheme more than once but he had never felt quite sure that
he was willing to undertake it His obligations in other directions were
so large But the lure was there and he pondered and pondered

Steners scheme of loaning him money wherewith to manipulate the North
Pennsylvania line deal put this Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street dream
in a more favorable light As it was he was constantly watching the
certificates of loan issue for the city treasurybuying large
quantities when the market was falling to protect it and selling
heavily though cautiously when he saw it rising and to do this he
had to have a great deal of free money to permit him to do it He was
constantly fearful of some break in the market which would affect the
value of all his securities and result in the calling of his loans
There was no storm in sight He did not see that anything could happen
in reason but he did not want to spread himself out too thin As he saw
it now therefore if he took one hundred and fifty thousand dollars of
this city money and went after this Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street
matter it would not mean that he was spreading himself out too thin for
because of this new proposition could he not call on Stener for more as
a loan in connection with these other ventures But if anything should
happenwell

Frank said Stener strolling into his office one afternoon after four
oclock when the main rush of the days work was overthe relationship
between Cowperwood and Stener had long since reached the Frank and
George periodStrobik thinks he has that North Pennsylvania
deal arranged so that we can take it up if we want to The principal
stockholder we find is a man by the name of Coltannot Ike Colton
but Ferdinand Hows that for a name Stener beamed fatly and genially

Things had changed considerably for him since the days when he had been
fortuitously and almost indifferently made city treasurer His method
of dressing had so much improved since he had been inducted into office
and his manner expressed so much more good feeling confidence aplomb
that he would not have recognized himself if he had been permitted
to see himself as had those who had known him before An old nervous
shifting of the eyes had almost ceased and a feeling of restfulness
which had previously been restlessness and had sprung from a sense of
necessity had taken its place His large feet were incased in good
squaretoed softleather shoes his stocky chest and fat legs were made
somewhat agreeable to the eye by a wellcut suit of brownishgray cloth
and his neck was now surrounded by a low wingpoint white collar and
brownsilk tie His ample chest which spread out a little lower in
around and constantly enlarging stomach was ornamented by a heavylink
gold chain and his white cuffs had large gold cuffbuttons set with
rubies of a very notable size He was rosy and decidedly well fed In
fact he was doing very well indeed

He had moved his family from a shabby twostory frame house in South
Ninth Street to a very comfortable brick one three stories in height
and three times as large on Spring Garden Street His wife had a
few acquaintancesthe wives of other politicians His children were
attending the high school a thing he had hardly hoped for in earlier
days He was now the owner of fourteen or fifteen pieces of cheap real
estate in different portions of the city which might eventually become
very valuable and he was a silent partner in the South Philadelphia
Foundry Company and the American Beef and Pork Company two corporations
on paper whose principal business was subletting contracts secured
from the city to the humble butchers and foundrymen who would carry out
orders as given and not talk too much or ask questions

Well that is an odd name said Cowperwood blandly So he has it I
never thought that road would pay as it was laid out Its too short
It ought to run about three miles farther out into the Kensington
section

Youre right said Stener dully

Did Strobik say what Colton wants for his shares

Sixtyeight I think

The current market rate He doesnt want much does he Well George
at that rate it will take abouthe calculated quickly on the basis
of the number of shares Cotton was holdingone hundred and twenty
thousand to get him out alone That isnt all Theres Judge Kitchen
and Joseph Zimmerman and Senator Donovanhe was referring to the State
senator of that name Youll be paying a pretty fair price for that
stud when you get it It will cost considerable more to extend the line
Its too much I think

Cowperwood was thinking how easy it would be to combine this line with
his dreamedof Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line and after a time
and with this in view he added

Say George why do you work all your schemes through Strobik and
Harmon and Wycroft Couldnt you and I manage some of these things for
ourselves alone instead of for three or four It seems to me that plan
would be much more profitable to you

It would it would exclaimed Stener his round eyes fixed on
Cowperwood in a rather helpless appealing way He liked Cowperwood and
had always been hoping that mentally as well as financially he could
get close to him Ive thought of that But these fellows have had more
experience in these matters than I have had Frank Theyve been longer
at the game I dont know as much about these things as they do

Cowperwood smiled in his soul though his face remained passive

Dont worry about them George he continued genially and
confidentially You and I together can know and do as much as they ever
could and more Im telling you Take this railroad deal youre in on
now George you and I could manipulate that just as well and better
than it can be done with Wycroft Strobik and Harmon in on it Theyre
not adding anything to the wisdom of the situation Theyre not putting
up any money Youre doing that All theyre doing is agreeing to see it
through the legislature and the council and as far as the legislature
is concerned they cant do any more with that than any one else
couldthan I could for instance Its all a question of arranging
things with Relihan anyhow putting up a certain amount of money for
him to work with Here in town there are other people who can reach the
council just as well as Strobik He was thinking once he controlled
a road of his own of conferring with Butler and getting him to use his
influence It would serve to quiet Strobik and his friends Im not
asking you to change your plans on this North Pennsylvania deal You
couldnt do that very well But there are other things In the future
why not lets see if you and I cant work some one thing together
Youll be much better off and so will I Weve done pretty well on the
cityloan proposition so far havent we

The truth was they had done exceedingly well Aside from what the
higher powers had made Steners new house his lots his bankaccount
his good clothes and his changed and comfortable sense of life were
largely due to Cowperwoods successful manipulation of these cityloan
certificates Already there had been four issues of two hundred thousand
dollars each Cowperwood had bought and sold nearly three million
dollars worth of these certificates acting one time as a bull and
another as a bear Stener was now worth all of one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars

Theres a line that I know of here in the city which could be made into
a splendidly paying property continued Cowperwood meditatively
if the right things could be done with it Just like this North
Pennsylvania line it isnt long enough The territory it serves isnt
big enough It ought to be extended but if you and I could get it it
might eventually be worked with this North Pennsylvania Company or some
other as one company That would save officers and offices and a lot
of things There is always money to be made out of a larger purchasing
power

He paused and looked out the window of his handsome little hardwood
office speculating upon the future The window gave nowhere save into
a back yard behind another office building which had formerly been a
residence Some grass grew feebly there The red wall and oldfashioned
brick fence which divided it from the next lot reminded him somehow of
his old home in New Market Street to which his Uncle Seneca used to
come as a Cuban trader followed by his black Portuguese servitor He
could see him now as he sat here looking at the yard

Well asked Stener ambitiously taking the bait why dont we get
hold of thatyou and me I suppose I could fix it so far as the money
is concerned How much would it take

Cowperwood smiled inwardly again

I dont know exactly he said after a time I want to look into it
more carefully The one trouble is that Im carrying a good deal of the
citys money as it is You see I have that two hundred thousand dollars
against your cityloan deals And this new scheme will take two or three
hundred thousand more If that were out of the way

He was thinking of one of the inexplicable stock panicsthose strange
American depressions which had so much to do with the temperament of the
people and so little to do with the basic conditions of the country
If this North Pennsylvania deal were through and done with

He rubbed his chin and pulled at his handsome silky mustache

Dont ask me any more about it George he said finally as he saw
that the latter was beginning to think as to which line it might be
Dont say anything at all about it I want to get my facts exactly
right and then Ill talk to you I think you and I can do this thing a
little later when we get the North Pennsylvania scheme under way Im
so rushed just now Im not sure that I want to undertake it at once but
you keep quiet and well see He turned toward his desk and Stener got
up

Ill make any sized deposit with you that you wish the moment you
think youre ready to act Frank exclaimed Stener and with the
thought that Cowperwood was not nearly as anxious to do this as he
should be since he could always rely on him Stener when there was
anything really profitable in the offing Why should not the able and
wonderful Cowperwood be allowed to make the two of them rich Just
notify Stires and hell send you a check Strobik thought we ought to
act pretty soon

Ill tend to it George replied Cowperwood confidently It will
come out all right Leave it to me

Stener kicked his stout legs to straighten his trousers and extended
his hand He strolled out in the street thinking of this new scheme
Certainly if he could get in with Cowperwood right he would be a rich
man for Cowperwood was so successful and so cautious His new house
this beautiful banking office his growing fame and his subtle
connections with Butler and others put Stener in considerable awe of
him Another line They would control it and the North Pennsylvania
Why if this went on he might become a magnatehe really mighthe
George W Stener once a cheap realestate and insurance agent He
strolled up the street thinking but with no more idea of the importance
of his civic duties and the nature of the social ethics against which he
was offending than if they had never existed





Chapter XXII


The services which Cowperwood performed during the ensuing year and a
half for Stener Strobik Butler State Treasurer Van Nostrand State
Senator Relihan representative of the interests socalled at
Harrisburg and various banks which were friendly to these gentlemen
were numerous and confidential For Stener Strobik Wycroft Harmon and
himself he executed the North Pennsylvania deal by which he became
a holder of a fifth of the controlling stock Together he and Stener
joined to purchase the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line and in the
concurrent gambling in stocks

By the summer of 1871 when Cowperwood was nearly thirtyfour years of
age he had a banking business estimated at nearly two million dollars
personal holdings aggregating nearly half a million and prospects which
other things being equal looked to wealth which might rival that of
any American The city through its treasurerstill Mr Stenerwas
a depositor with him to the extent of nearly five hundred thousand
dollars The State through its State treasurer Van Nostrand carried
two hundred thousand dollars on his books Bode was speculating in
streetrailway stocks to the extent of fifty thousand dollars Relihan
to the same amount A small army of politicians and political hangerson
were on his books for various sums And for Edward Malia Butler he
occasionally carried as high as one hundred thousand dollars in margins
His own loans at the banks varying from day to day on variously
hypothecated securities were as high as seven and eight hundred
thousand dollars Like a spider in a spangled net every thread of which
he knew had laid had tested he had surrounded and entangled himself
in a splendid glittering network of connections and he was watching
all the details

His one pet idea the thing he put more faith in than anything else was
his streetrailway manipulations and particularly his actual control of
the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line Through an advance to him
on deposit made in his bank by Stener at a time when the stock of the
Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line was at a low ebb he had managed
to pick up fiftyone per cent of the stock for himself and Stener
by virtue of which he was able to do as he pleased with the road
To accomplish this however he had resorted to some very peculiar
methods as they afterward came to be termed in financial circles to
get this stock at his own valuation Through agents he caused suits for
damages to be brought against the company for nonpayment of interest
due A little stock in the hands of a hireling a request made to
a court of record to examine the books of the company in order to
determine whether a receivership were not advisable a simultaneous
attack in the stock market selling at three five seven and ten
points off brought the frightened stockholders into the market with
their holdings The banks considered the line a poor risk and called
their loans in connection with it His fathers bank had made one loan
to one of the principal stockholders and that was promptly called of
course Then through an agent the several heaviest shareholders were
approached and an offer was made to help them out The stocks would
be taken off their hands at forty They had not really been able to
discover the source of all their woes and they imagined that the road
was in bad condition which it was not Better let it go The money was
immediately forthcoming and Cowperwood and Stener jointly controlled
fiftyone per cent But as in the case of the North Pennsylvania line
Cowperwood had been quietly buying all of the small minority holdings
so that he had in reality fiftyone per cent of the stock and Stener
twentyfive per cent more

This intoxicated him for immediately he saw the opportunity of
fulfilling his longcontemplated dreamthat of reorganizing the company
in conjunction with the North Pennsylvania line issuing three shares
where one had been before and after unloading all but a control on the
general public using the money secured to buy into other lines which
were to be boomed and sold in the same way In short he was one of
those early daring manipulators who later were to seize upon other
and ever larger phases of American natural development for their own
aggrandizement

In connection with this first consolidation his plan was to spread
rumors of the coming consolidation of the two lines to appeal to
the legislature for privileges of extension to get up an arresting
prospectus and later annual reports and to boom the stock on the stock
exchange as much as his swelling resources would permit The trouble is
that when you are trying to make a market for a stockto unload a large
issue such as his was over five hundred thousand dollars worthwhile
retaining five hundred thousand for yourself it requires large capital
to handle it The owner in these cases is compelled not only to go on
the market and do much fictitious buying thus creating a fictitious
demand but once this fictitious demand has deceived the public and he
has been able to unload a considerable quantity of his wares he is
unless he rids himself of all his stock compelled to stand behind it
If for instance he sold five thousand shares as was done in this
instance and retained five thousand he must see that the public price
of the outstanding five thousand shares did not fall below a certain
point because the value of his private shares would fall with it
And if as is almost always the case the private shares had been
hypothecated with banks and trust companies for money wherewith to
conduct other enterprises the falling of their value in the open market
merely meant that the banks would call for large margins to protect
their loans or call their loans entirely This meant that his work was
a failure and he might readily fail He was already conducting one such
difficult campaign in connection with this cityloan deal the price of
which varied from day to day and which he was only too anxious to have
vary for in the main he profited by these changes

But this second burden interesting enough as it was meant that he
had to be doubly watchful Once the stock was sold at a high price
the money borrowed from the city treasurer could be returned his
own holdings created out of foresight by capitalizing the future by
writing the shrewd prospectuses and reports would be worth their face
value or little less He would have money to invest in other lines
He might obtain the financial direction of the whole in which case he
would be worth millions One shrewd thing he did which indicated the
foresight and subtlety of the man was to make a separate organization
or company of any extension or addition which he made to his line Thus
if he had two or three miles of track on a street and he wanted to
extend it two or three miles farther on the same street instead of
including this extension in the existing corporation he would make a
second corporation to control the additional two or three miles of
right of way This corporation he would capitalize at so much and issue
stocks and bonds for its construction equipment and manipulation
Having done this he would then take the subcorporation over into the
parent concern issuing more stocks and bonds of the parent company
wherewith to do it and of course selling these bonds to the
public Even his brothers who worked for him did not know the various
ramifications of his numerous deals and executed his orders blindly
Sometimes Joseph said to Edward in a puzzled way Well Frank knows
what he is about I guess

On the other hand he was most careful to see that every current
obligation was instantly met and even anticipated for he wanted to
make a great show of regularity Nothing was so precious as reputation
and standing His forethought caution and promptness pleased the
bankers They thought he was one of the sanest shrewdest men they had
ever met

However by the spring and summer of 1871 Cowperwood had actually
without being in any conceivable danger from any source spread
himself out very thin Because of his great success he had grown more
liberaleasierin his financial ventures By degrees and largely
because of his own confidence in himself he had induced his father
to enter upon his streetcar speculations to use the resources of the
Third National to carry a part of his loans and to furnish capital at
such times as quick resources were necessary In the beginning the old
gentleman had been a little nervous and skeptical but as time had worn
on and nothing but profit eventuated he grew bolder and more confident

Frank he would say looking up over his spectacles arent you
afraid youre going a little too fast in these matters Youre carrying
a lot of loans these days

No more than I ever did father considering my resources You cant
turn large deals without large loans You know that as well as I do

Yes I know butnow that Green and Coatesarent you going pretty
strong there

Not at all I know the inside conditions there The stock is bound to
go up eventually Ill bull it up Ill combine it with my other lines
if necessary

Cowperwood stared at his boy Never was there such a defiant daring
manipulator

You neednt worry about me father If you are going to do that call
my loans Other banks will loan on my stocks Id like to see your bank
have the interest

So Cowperwood Sr was convinced There was no gainsaying this
argument His bank was loaning Frank heavily but not more so than any
other And as for the great blocks of stocks he was carrying in his
sons companies he was to be told when to get out should that prove
necessary Franks brothers were being aided in the same way to
make money on the side and their interests were also now bound up
indissolubly with his own

With his growing financial opportunities however Cowperwood had also
grown very liberal in what might be termed his standard of living
Certain young art dealers in Philadelphia learning of his artistic
inclinations and his growing wealth had followed him up with
suggestions as to furniture tapestries rugs objects of art
and paintingsat first the American and later the foreign masters
exclusively His own and his fathers house had not been furnished fully
in these matters and there was that other house in North Tenth Street
which he desired to make beautiful Aileen had always objected to the
condition of her own home Love of distinguished surroundings was a
basic longing with her though she had not the gift of interpreting
her longings But this place where they were secretly meeting must be
beautiful She was as keen for that as he was So it became a veritable
treasuretrove more distinguished in furnishings than some of the rooms
of his own home He began to gather here some rare examples of altar
cloths rugs and tapestries of the Middle Ages He bought furniture
after the Georgian theorya combination of Chippendale Sheraton and
Heppelwhite modified by the Italian Renaissance and the French Louis He
learned of handsome examples of porcelain statuary Greek vase forms
lovely collections of Japanese ivories and netsukes Fletcher Gray
a partner in Cable  Gray a local firm of importers of art objects
called on him in connection with a tapestry of the fourteenth century
weaving Gray was an enthusiast and almost instantly he conveyed some of
his suppressed and yet fiery love of the beautiful to Cowperwood

There are fifty periods of one shade of blue porcelain alone Mr
Cowperwood Gray informed him There are at least seven distinct
schools or periods of rugsPersian Armenian Arabian Flemish Modern
Polish Hungarian and so on If you ever went into that it
would be a distinguished thing to get a completeI mean a
representativecollection of some one period or of all these periods
They are beautiful I have seen some of them others Ive read about

Youll make a convert of me yet Fletcher replied Cowperwood You or
art will be the ruin of me Im inclined that way temperamentally as it
is I think and between you and Ellsworth and Gordon Strakeanother
young man intensely interested in paintingyoull complete my
downfall Strake has a splendid idea He wants me to begin right
nowIm using that word right in the sense of properly he
commentedand get what examples I can of just the few rare things in
each school or period of art which would properly illustrate each He
tells me the great pictures are going to increase in value and what I
could get for a few hundred thousand now will be worth millions later
He doesnt want me to bother with American art

Hes right exclaimed Gray although it isnt good business for me to
praise another art man It would take a great deal of money though

Not so very much At least not all at once It would be a matter
of years of course Strake thinks that some excellent examples of
different periods could be picked up now and later replaced if anything
better in the same held showed up

His mind in spite of his outward placidity was tinged with a great
seeking Wealth in the beginning had seemed the only goal to which
had been added the beauty of women And now art for arts sakethe
first faint radiance of a rosy dawnhad begun to shine in upon him and
to the beauty of womanhood he was beginning to see how necessary it was
to add the beauty of lifethe beauty of material backgroundhow in
fact the only background for great beauty was great art This girl
this Aileen Butler her raw youth and radiance was nevertheless
creating in him a sense of the distinguished and a need for it which
had never existed in him before to the same degree It is impossible to
define these subtleties of reaction temperament on temperament for no
one knows to what degree we are marked by the things which attract us A
love affair such as this had proved to be was little less or more than a
drop of coloring added to a glass of clear water or a foreign chemical
agent introduced into a delicate chemical formula

In short for all her crudeness Aileen Butler was a definite force
personally Her nature in a way a protest against the clumsy
conditions by which she found herself surrounded was almost
irrationally ambitious To think that for so long having been born into
the Butler family she had been the subject as well as the victim of
such commonplace and inartistic illusions and conditions whereas now
owing to her contact with and mental subordination to Cowperwood she
was learning so many wonderful phases of social as well as financial
refinement of which previously she had guessed nothing The wonder for
instance of a future social career as the wife of such a man as Frank
Cowperwood The beauty and resourcefulness of his mind which after
hours of intimate contact with her he was pleased to reveal and which
so definite were his comments and instructions she could not fail
to sense The wonder of his financial and artistic and future social
dreams And oh oh she was his and he was hers She was actually
beside herself at times with the glory as well as the delight of all
this

At the same time her fathers local reputation as a quondam garbage
contractor slopcollector was the unfeeling comment of the vulgarian
cognoscenti her own unavailing efforts to right a condition of
material vulgarity or artistic anarchy in her own home the hopelessness
of ever being admitted to those distinguished portals which she
recognized afar off as the last sanctum sanctorum of established
respectability and social distinction had bred in her even at this
early age a feeling of deadly opposition to her home conditions as they
stood Such a house compared to Cowperwoods Her dear but ignorant
father And this great man her lover had now condescended to love
hersee in her his future wife Oh God that it might not fail
Through the Cowperwoods at first she had hoped to meet a few people
young men and womenand particularly menwho were above the station in
which she found herself and to whom her beauty and prospective fortune
would commend her but this had not been the case The Cowperwoods
themselves in spite of Frank Cowperwoods artistic proclivities and
growing wealth had not penetrated the inner circle as yet In fact
aside from the subtle preliminary consideration which they were
receiving they were a long way off

None the less and instinctively in Cowperwood Aileen recognized a way
outa doorand by the same token a subtle impending artistic future
of great magnificence This man would rise beyond anything he
now dreamed ofshe felt it There was in him in some nebulous
unrecognizable form a great artistic reality which was finer than
anything she could plan for herself She wanted luxury magnificence
social station Well if she could get this man they would come to her
There were apparently insuperable barriers in the way but hers was no
weakling nature and neither was his They ran together temperamentally
from the first like two leopards Her own thoughtscrude half
formulated half spokennevertheless matched his to a degree in the
equality of their force and their raw directness

I dont think papa knows how to do she said to him one day It
isnt his fault He cant help it He knows that he cant And he knows
that I know it For years I wanted him to move out of that old house
there He knows that he ought to But even that wouldnt do much good

She paused looking at him with a straight clear vigorous glance
He liked the medallion sharpness of her featurestheir smooth Greek
modeling

Never mind pet he replied We will arrange all these things later
I dont see my way out of this just now but I think the best thing to
do is to confess to Lillian some day and see if some other plan cant
be arranged I want to fix it so the children wont suffer I can
provide for them amply and I wouldnt be at all surprised if Lillian
would be willing to let me go She certainly wouldnt want any
publicity

He was counting practically and manfashion on her love for her
children

Aileen looked at him with clear questioning uncertain eyes She was
not wholly without sympathy but in a way this situation did not appeal
to her as needing much Mrs Cowperwood was not friendly in her mood
toward her It was not based on anything save a difference in their
point of view Mrs Cowperwood could never understand how a girl could
carry her head so high and put on such airs and Aileen could not
understand how any one could be so lymphatic and lackadaisical as
Lillian Cowperwood Life was made for riding driving dancing going
It was made for airs and banter and persiflage and coquetry To see this
woman the wife of a young forceful man like Cowperwood acting even
though she were five years older and the mother of two children as
though life on its romantic and enthusiastic pleasurable side were all
over was too much for her Of course Lillian was unsuited to Frank of
course he needed a young woman like herself and fate would surely give
him to her Then what a delicious life they would lead

Oh Frank she exclaimed to him over and over if we could only
manage it Do you think we can

Do I think we can Certainly I do Its only a matter of time I think
if I were to put the matter to her clearly she wouldnt expect me to
stay You look out how you conduct your affairs If your father or your
brother should ever suspect me thered be an explosion in this town
if nothing worse Theyd fight me in all my money deals if they didnt
kill me Are you thinking carefully of what you are doing

All the time If anything happens Ill deny everything They cant
prove it if I deny it Ill come to you in the long run just the
same

They were in the Tenth Street house at the time She stroked his cheeks
with the loving fingers of the wildly enamored woman

Ill do anything for you sweetheart she declared Id die for you
if I had to I love you so

Well pet no danger You wont have to do anything like that But be
careful





Chapter XXIII


Then after several years of this secret relationship in which the ties
of sympathy and understanding grew stronger instead of weaker came
the storm It burst unexpectedly and out of a clear sky and bore no
relation to the intention or volition of any individual It was nothing
more than a fire a distant onethe great Chicago fire October 7th
1871 which burned that cityits vast commercial sectionto the
ground and instantly and incidentally produced a financial panic
vicious though of short duration in various other cities in America
The fire began on Saturday and continued apparently unabated until the
following Wednesday It destroyed the banks the commercial houses the
shipping conveniences and vast stretches of property The heaviest loss
fell naturally upon the insurance companies which instantly in many
casesthe majorityclosed their doors This threw the loss back on the
manufacturers and wholesalers in other cities who had had dealings with
Chicago as well as the merchants of that city Again very grievous
losses were borne by the host of eastern capitalists which had for years
past partly owned or held heavy mortgages on the magnificent buildings
for business purposes and residences in which Chicago was already
rivaling every city on the continent Transportation was disturbed and
the keen scent of Wall Street and Third Street in Philadelphia and
State Street in Boston instantly perceived in the early reports the
gravity of the situation Nothing could be done on Saturday or Sunday
after the exchange closed for the opening reports came too late On
Monday however the facts were pouring in thick and fast and the
owners of railroad securities government securities streetcar
securities and indeed all other forms of stocks and bonds began to
throw them on the market in order to raise cash The banks naturally
were calling their loans and the result was a stock stampede which
equaled the Black Friday of Wall Street of two years before

Cowperwood and his father were out of town at the time the fire began
They had gone with several friendsbankersto look at a proposed route
of extension of a local steamrailroad on which a loan was desired
In buggies they had driven over a good portion of the route and were
returning to Philadelphia late Sunday evening when the cries of newsboys
hawking an extra reached their ears

Ho Extra Extra All about the big Chicago fire

Ho Extra Extra Chicago burning down Extra Extra

The cries were longdrawnout ominous pathetic In the dusk of the
dreary Sunday afternoon when the city had apparently retired to Sabbath
meditation and prayer with that tinge of the dying year in the foliage
and in the air one caught a sense of something grim and gloomy

Hey boy called Cowperwood listening seeing a shabbily clothed
misfit of a boy with a bundle of papers under his arm turning a corner
Whats that Chicago burning

He looked at his father and the other men in a significant way as he
reached for the paper and then glancing at the headlines realized the
worst

ALL CHICAGO BURNING

FIRE RAGES UNCHECKED IN COMMERCIAL SECTION SINCE YESTERDAY EVENING
BANKS COMMERCIAL HOUSES PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN RUINS DIRECT TELEGRAPHIC
COMMUNICATION SUSPENDED SINCE THREE OCLOCK TODAY NO END TO PROGRESS
OF DISASTER IN SIGHT

That looks rather serious he said calmly to his companions a cold
commanding force coming into his eyes and voice To his father he said
a little later Its panic unless the majority of the banks and
brokerage firms stand together

He was thinking quickly brilliantly resourcefully of his own
outstanding obligations His fathers bank was carrying one hundred
thousand dollars worth of his streetrailway securities at sixty and
fifty thousand dollars worth of city loan at seventy His father
had up with him over forty thousand dollars in cash covering market
manipulations in these stocks The banking house of Drexel  Co was on
his books as a creditor for one hundred thousand and that loan would be
called unless they were especially merciful which was not likely
Jay Cooke  Co were his creditors for another one hundred and fifty
thousand They would want their money At four smaller banks and three
brokerage companies he was debtor for sums ranging from fifty thousand
dollars down The city treasurer was involved with him to the extent of
nearly five hundred thousand dollars and exposure of that would create
a scandal the State treasurer for two hundred thousand There were
small accounts hundreds of them ranging from one hundred dollars up
to five and ten thousand A panic would mean not only a withdrawal of
deposits and a calling of loans but a heavy depression of securities
How could he realize on his securitiesthat was the questionhow
without selling so many points off that his fortune would be swept away
and he would be ruined

He figured briskly the while he waved adieu to his friends who hurried
away struck with their own predicament

You had better go on out to the house father and Ill send some
telegrams The telephone had not yet been invented Ill be right
out and well go into this thing together It looks like black weather
to me Dont say anything to any one until after we have had our talk
then we can decide what to do

Cowperwood Sr was already plucking at his sidewhiskers in a confused
and troubled way He was cogitating as to what might happen to him
in case his son failed for he was deeply involved with him He was
a little gray in his complexion now frightened for he had already
strained many points in his affairs to accommodate his son If Frank
should not be able promptly on the morrow to meet the call which the
bank might have to make for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars the
onus and scandal of the situation would be on him

On the other hand his son was meditating on the tangled relation in
which he now found himself in connection with the city treasurer and the
fact that it was not possible for him to support the market alone Those
who should have been in a position to help him were now as bad off as
himself There were many unfavorable points in the whole situation
Drexel  Co had been booming railway stocksloaning heavily on them
Jay Cooke  Co had been backing Northern Pacificwere practically
doing their best to build that immense transcontinental system alone
Naturally they were long on that and hence in a ticklish position At
the first word they would throw over their surest securitiesgovernment
bonds and the likein order to protect their more speculative
holdings The bears would see the point They would hammer and hammer
selling short all along the line But he did not dare to do that He
would be breaking his own back quickly and what he needed was time If
he could only get timethree days a week ten daysthis storm would
surely blow over

The thing that was troubling him most was the matter of the halfmillion
invested with him by Stener A fall election was drawing near Stener
although he had served two terms was slated for reelection A scandal
in connection with the city treasury would be a very bad thing It would
end Steners career as an officialwould very likely send him to the
penitentiary It might wreck the Republican partys chances to win It
would certainly involve himself as having much to do with it If that
happened he would have the politicians to reckon with For if he were
hard pressed as he would be and failed the fact that he had been
trying to invade the city streetrailway preserves which they held
sacred to themselves with borrowed city money and that this borrowing
was liable to cost them the city election would all come out They
would not view all that with a kindly eye It would be useless to say
as he could that he had borrowed the money at two per cent most of
it to save himself had been covered by a protective clause of that
kind or that he had merely acted as an agent for Stener That might go
down with the unsophisticated of the outer world but it would never be
swallowed by the politicians They knew better than that

There was another phase to this situation however that encouraged him
and that was his knowledge of how city politics were going in general
It was useless for any politician however loftly to take a high and
mighty tone in a crisis like this All of them great and small were
profiting in one way and another through city privileges Butler
Mollenhauer and Simpson he knew made money out of contractslegal
enough though they might be looked upon as rank favoritismand also
out of vast sums of money collected in the shape of taxesland taxes
water taxes etcwhich were deposited in the various banks designated
by these men and others as legal depositories for city money The banks
supposedly carried the citys money in their vaults as a favor
without paying interest of any kind and then reinvested itfor whom
Cowperwood had no complaint to make for he was being well treated but
these men could scarcely expect to monopolize all the citys benefits
He did not know either Mollenhauer or Simpson personallybut he knew
they as well as Butler had made money out of his own manipulation
of city loan Also Butler was most friendly to him It was not
unreasonable for him to think in a crisis like this that if worst came
to worst he could make a clean breast of it to Butler and receive aid
In case he could not get through secretly with Steners help Cowperwood
made up his mind that he would do this

His first move he decided would be to go at once to Steners house and
demand the loan of an additional three or four hundred thousand dollars
Stener had always been very tractable and in this instance would see
how important it was that his shortage of half a million should not be
made public Then he must get as much more as possible But where to get
it Presidents of banks and trust companies large stock jobbers and
the like would have to be seen Then there was a loan of one hundred
thousand dollars he was carrying for Butler The old contractor might be
induced to leave that He hurried to his home secured his runabout and
drove rapidly to Steners

As it turned out however much to his distress and confusion Stener
was out of towndown on the Chesapeake with several friends shooting
ducks and fishing and was not expected back for several days He was in
the marshes back of some small town Cowperwood sent an urgent wire to
the nearest point and then to make assurance doubly sure to several
other points in the same neighborhood asking him to return immediately
He was not at all sure however that Stener would return in time and
was greatly nonplussed and uncertain for the moment as to what his next
step would be Aid must be forthcoming from somewhere and at once

Suddenly a helpful thought occurred to him Butler and Mollenhauer and
Simpson were long on local streetrailways They must combine to support
the situation and protect their interests They could see the big
bankers Drexel  Co and Cooke  Co and others and urge them to
sustain the market They could strengthen things generally by organizing
a buying ring and under cover of their support if they would he might
sell enough to let him out and even permit him to go short and make
somethinga whole lot It was a brilliant thought worthy of a greater
situation and its only weakness was that it was not absolutely certain
of fulfillment

He decided to go to Butler at once the only disturbing thought being
that he would now be compelled to reveal his own and Steners affairs
So reentering his runabout he drove swiftly to the Butler home

When he arrived there the famous contractor was at dinner He had not
heard the calling of the extras and of course did not understand
as yet the significance of the fire The servants announcement of
Cowperwood brought him smiling to the door

Wont you come in and join us Were just havin a light supper Have a
cup of coffee or tea nowdo

I cant replied Cowperwood Not tonight Im in too much of a
hurry I want to see you for just a few moments and then Ill be off
again I wont keep you very long

Why if thats the case Ill come right out And Butler returned to
the diningroom to put down his napkin Aileen who was also dining
had heard Cowperwoods voice and was on the qui vive to see him She
wondered what it was that brought him at this time of night to see her
father She could not leave the table at once but hoped to before he
went Cowperwood was thinking of her even in the face of this impending
storm as he was of his wife and many other things If his affairs
came down in a heap it would go hard with those attached to him In
this first clouding of disaster he could not tell how things
would eventuate He meditated on this desperately but he was not
panicstricken His naturally evenmolded face was set in fine classic
lines his eyes were as hard as chilled steel

Well now exclaimed Butler returning his countenance manifesting
a decidedly comfortable relationship with the world as at present
constituted Whats up with you tonight Nawthin wrong I hope Its
been too fine a day

Nothing very serious I hope myself replied Cowperwood But I want
to talk with you a few minutes anyhow Dont you think we had better go
up to your room

I was just going to say that replied Butlerthe cigars are up
there

They started from the receptionroom to the stairs Butler preceding
and as the contractor mounted Aileen came out from the diningroom in
a froufrou of silk Her splendid hair was drawn up from the base of the
neck and the line of the forehead into some quaint convolutions which
constituted a reddishgold crown Her complexion was glowing and her
bare arms and shoulders shone white against the dark red of her evening
gown She realized there was something wrong

Oh Mr Cowperwood how do you do she exclaimed coming forward and
holding out her hand as her father went on upstairs She was delaying
him deliberately in order to have a word with him and this bold acting
was for the benefit of the others

Whats the trouble honey she whispered as soon as her father was
out of hearing You look worried

Nothing much I hope sweet he said Chicago is burning up and
theres going to be trouble tomorrow I have to talk to your father

She had time only for a sympathetic distressed Oh before he withdrew
his hand and followed Butler upstairs She squeezed his arm and went
through the receptionroom to the parlor She sat down thinking for
never before had she seen Cowperwoods face wearing such an expression
of stern disturbed calculation It was placid like fine white wax
and quite as cold and those deep vague inscrutable eyes So Chicago
was burning What would happen to him Was he very much involved He had
never told her in detail of his affairs She would not have understood
fully any more than would have Mrs Cowperwood But she was worried
nevertheless because it was her Frank and because she was bound to him
by what to her seemed indissoluble ties

Literature outside of the masters has given us but one idea of the
mistress the subtle calculating siren who delights to prey on the
souls of men The journalism and the moral pamphleteering of the time
seem to foster it with almost partisan zeal It would seem that a
censorship of life had been established by divinity and the care of its
execution given into the hands of the utterly conservative Yet there
is that other form of liaison which has nothing to do with conscious
calculation In the vast majority of cases it is without design or
guile The average woman controlled by her affections and deeply in
love is no more capable than a child of anything save sacrificial
thoughtthe desire to give and so long as this state endures she
can only do this She may changeHell hath no fury etcbut the
sacrificial yielding solicitous attitude is more often the outstanding
characteristic of the mistress and it is this very attitude in
contradistinction to the grasping legality of established matrimony that
has caused so many wounds in the defenses of the latter The temperament
of man either male or female cannot help falling down before and
worshiping this nonseeking sacrificial note It approaches vast
distinction in life It appears to be related to that last word in art
that largeness of spirit which is the first characteristic of the
great picture the great building the great sculpture the great
decorationnamely a giving freely and without stint of itself of
beauty Hence the significance of this particular mood in Aileen

All the subtleties of the present combination were troubling Cowperwood
as he followed Butler into the room upstairs

Sit down sit down You wont take a little somethin You never do
I remember now Well have a cigar anyhow Now whats this thats
troublin you tonight

Voices could be heard faintly in the distance far off toward the
thicker residential sections

Extra Extra All about the big Chicago fire Chicago burning down

Just that replied Cowperwood hearkening to them Have you heard the
news

No Whats that theyre calling

Its a big fire out in Chicago

Oh replied Butler still not gathering the significance of it

Its burning down the business section there Mr Butler went on
Cowperwood ominously and I fancy its going to disturb financial
conditions here tomorrow That is what I have come to see you about
How are your investments Pretty well drawn in

Butler suddenly gathered from Cowperwoods expression that there was
something very wrong He put up his large hand as he leaned back in his
big leather chair and covered his mouth and chin with it Over those
big knuckles and bigger nose thick and cartilaginous his large
shaggyeyebrowed eyes gleamed His gray bristly hair stood up stiffly
in a short even growth all over his head

So thats it he said Youre expectin trouble tomorrow How are
your own affairs

Im in pretty good shape I think all told if the money element of
this town doesnt lose its head and go wild There has to be a lot of
common sense exercised tomorrow or tonight even You know we are
facing a real panic Mr Butler you may as well know that It may not
last long but while it does it will be bad Stocks are going to drop
tomorrow ten or fifteen points on the opening The banks are going to
call their loans unless some arrangement can be made to prevent them
No one man can do that It will have to be a combination of men You and
Mr Simpson and Mr Mollenhauer might do itthat is you could if you
could persuade the big banking people to combine to back the market
There is going to be a raid on local streetrailwaysall of them
Unless they are sustained the bottom is going to drop out I have always
known that you were long on those I thought you and Mr Mollenhauer
and some of the others might want to act If you dont I might as well
confess that it is going to go rather hard with me I am not strong
enough to face this thing alone

He was meditating on how he should tell the whole truth in regard to
Stener

Well now thats pretty bad said Butler calmly and meditatively
He was thinking of his own affairs A panic was not good for him either
but he was not in a desperate state He could not fail He might lose
some money but not a vast amountbefore he could adjust things Still
he did not care to lose any money

How is it youre so bad off he asked curiously He was wondering how
the fact that the bottom was going to drop out of local streetrailways
would affect Cowperwood so seriously Youre not carryin any of them
things are you he added

It was now a question of lying or telling the truth and Cowperwood
was literally afraid to risk lying in this dilemma If he did not gain
Butlers comprehending support he might fail and if he failed the truth
would come out anyhow

I might as well make a clean breast of this Mr Butler he said
throwing himself on the old mans sympathies and looking at him with
that brisk assurance which Butler so greatly admired He felt as proud
of Cowperwood at times as he did of his own sons He felt that he had
helped to put him where he was

The fact is that I have been buying streetrailway stocks but not for
myself exactly I am going to do something now which I think I ought not
to do but I cannot help myself If I dont do it it will injure
you and a lot of people whom I do not wish to injure I know you are
naturally interested in the outcome of the fall election The truth is
I have been carrying a lot of stocks for Mr Stener and some of his
friends I do not know that all the money has come from the city
treasury but I think that most of it has I know what that means to
Mr Stener and the Republican party and your interests in case I fail
I dont think Mr Stener started this of his own accord in the first
placeI think I am as much to blame as anybodybut it grew out of
other things As you know I handled that matter of city loan for him
and then some of his friends wanted me to invest in streetrailways
for them I have been doing that ever since Personally I have borrowed
considerable money from Mr Stener at two per cent In fact originally
the transactions were covered in that way Now I dont want to shift the
blame on any one It comes back to me and I am willing to let it stay
there except that if I fail Mr Stener will be blamed and that will
reflect on the administration Naturally I dont want to fail There is
no excuse for my doing so Aside from this panic I have never been in
a better position in my life But I cannot weather this storm without
assistance and I want to know if you wont help me If I pull through
I will give you my word that I will see that the money which has been
taken from the treasury is put back there Mr Stener is out of town or
I would have brought him here with me

Cowperwood was lying out of the whole cloth in regard to bringing Stener
with him and he had no intention of putting the money back in the city
treasury except by degrees and in such manner as suited his convenience
but what he had said sounded well and created a great seeming of
fairness

How much money is it Stener has invested with you asked Butler He
was a little confused by this curious development It put Cowperwood and
Stener in an odd light

About five hundred thousand dollars replied Cowperwood

The old man straightened up Is it as much as that he said

Just abouta little more or a little less Im not sure which

The old contractor listened solemnly to all Cowperwood had to say on
this score thinking of the effect on the Republican party and his own
contracting interests He liked Cowperwood but this was a rough thing
the latter was telling himrough and a great deal to ask He was a
slowthinking and a slowmoving man but he did well enough when he did
think He had considerable money invested in Philadelphia streetrailway
stocksperhaps as much as eight hundred thousand dollars Mollenhauer
had perhaps as much more Whether Senator Simpson had much or little he
could not tell Cowperwood had told him in the past that he thought
the Senator had a good deal Most of their holdings as in the case of
Cowperwoods were hypothecated at the various banks for loans and these
loans invested in other ways It was not advisable or comfortable
to have these loans called though the condition of no one of the
triumvirate was anything like as bad as that of Cowperwood They could
see themselves through without much trouble though not without probable
loss unless they took hurried action to protect themselves

He would not have thought so much of it if Cowperwood had told him that
Stener was involved say to the extent of seventyfive or a hundred
thousand dollars That might be adjusted But five hundred thousand
dollars

Thats a lot of money said Butler thinking of the amazing audacity
of Stener but failing at the moment to identify it with the astute
machinations of Cowperwood Thats something to think about Theres
no time to lose if theres going to be a panic in the morning How much
good will it do ye if we do support the market

A great deal returned Cowperwood although of course I have to raise
money in other ways I have that one hundred thousand dollars of yours
on deposit Is it likely that youll want that right away

It may be said Butler

Its just as likely that Ill need it so badly that I cant give it up
without seriously injuring myself added Cowperwood Thats just one
of a lot of things If you and Senator Simpson and Mr Mollenhauer
were to get togetheryoure the largest holders of streetrailway
stocksand were to see Mr Drexel and Mr Cooke you could fix things
so that matters would be considerably easier I will be all right if my
loans are not called and my loans will not be called if the market does
not slump too heavily If it does all my securities are depreciated
and I cant hold out

Old Butler got up This is serious business he said I wish youd
never gone in with Stener in that way It dont look quite right and it
cant be made to Its bad bad business he added dourly Still Ill
do what I can I cant promise much but Ive always liked ye and Ill
not be turning on ye now unless I have to But Im sorryvery And Im
not the only one that has a hand in things in this town At the same
time he was thinking it was right decent of Cowperwood to forewarn him
this way in regard to his own affairs and the city election even though
he was saving his own neck by so doing He meant to do what he could

I dont suppose you could keep this matter of Stener and the city
treasury quiet for a day or two until I see how I come out suggested
Cowperwood warily

I cant promise that replied Butler Ill have to do the best I can
I wont lave it go any further than I can helpyou can depend on that
He was thinking how the effect of Steners crime could be overcome if
Cowperwood failed

Owen

He stepped to the door and opening it called down over the banister

Yes father

Have Dan hitch up the light buggy and bring it around to the door And
you get your hat and coat I want you to go along with me

Yes father

He came back

Sure thats a nice little storm in a teapot now isnt it Chicago
begins to burn and I have to worry here in Philadelphia Well well
Cowperwood was up now and moving to the door And where are you going

Back to the house I have several people coming there to see me But
Ill come back here later if I may

Yes yes replied Butler To be sure Ill be here by midnight
anyhow Well good night Ill see you later then I suppose Ill tell
you what I find out

He went back in his room for something and Cowperwood descended the
stair alone From the hangings of the receptionroom entryway Aileen
signaled him to draw near

I hope its nothing serious honey she sympathized looking into his
solemn eyes

It was not time for love and he felt it

No he said almost coldly I think not

Frank dont let this thing make you forget me for long please You
wont will you I love you so

No no I wont he replied earnestly quickly and yet absently

I cant Dont you know I wont He had started to kiss her but a
noise disturbed him Sh

He walked to the door and she followed him with eager sympathetic
eyes

What if anything should happen to her Frank What if anything could
What would she do That was what was troubling her What would what
could she do to help him He looked so palestrained





Chapter XXIV


The condition of the Republican party at this time in Philadelphia
its relationship to George W Stener Edward Malia Butler Henry A
Mollenhauer Senator Mark Simpson and others will have to be briefly
indicated here in order to foreshadow Cowperwoods actual situation
Butler as we have seen was normally interested in and friendly to
Cowperwood Stener was Cowperwoods tool Mollenhauer and Senator
Simpson were strong rivals of Butler for the control of city affairs
Simpson represented the Republican control of the State legislature
which could dictate to the city if necessary making new election laws
revising the city charter starting political investigations and the
like He had many influential newspapers corporations banks at his
beck and call Mollenhauer represented the Germans some Americans and
some large stable corporationsa very solid and respectable man All
three were strong able and dangerous politically The two latter
counted on Butlers influence particularly with the Irish and a
certain number of ward leaders and Catholic politicians and laymen
who were as loyal to him as though he were a part of the church itself
Butlers return to these followers was protection influence aid
and goodwill generally The citys return to him via Mollenhauer
and Simpson was in the shape of contractsfat onesstreetpaving
bridges viaducts sewers And in order for him to get these contracts
the affairs of the Republican party of which he was a beneficiary as
well as a leader must be kept reasonably straight At the same time it
was no more a part of his need to keep the affairs of the party straight
than it was of either Mollenhauers or Simpsons and Stener was not his
appointee The latter was more directly responsible to Mollenhauer than
to any one else

As Butler stepped into the buggy with his son he was thinking about
this and it was puzzling him greatly

Cowperwoods just been here he said to Owen who had been rapidly
coming into a sound financial understanding of late and was already a
shrewder man politically and socially than his father though he had
not the latters magnetism Hes been tellin me that hes in a rather
tight place You hear that he continued as some voice in the distance
was calling Extra Extra Thats Chicago burnin and theres goin
to be trouble on the stock exchange tomorrow We have a lot of our
streetrailway stocks around at the different banks If we dont look
sharp theyll be callin our loans We have to tend to that the first
thing in the mornin Cowperwood has a hundred thousand of mine with him
that he wants me to let stay there and he has some money that belongs
to Stener he tells me

Stener asked Owen curiously Has he been dabbling in stocks Owen
had heard some rumors concerning Stener and others only very recently
which he had not credited nor yet communicated to his father How much
money of his has Cowperwood he asked

Butler meditated Quite a bit Im afraid he finally said As a
matter of fact its a great dealabout five hundred thousand dollars
If that should become known it would be makin a good deal of noise
Im thinkin

Whew exclaimed Owen in astonishment Five hundred thousand dollars
Good Lord father Do you mean to say Stener has got away with five
hundred thousand dollars Why I wouldnt think he was clever enough to
do that Five hundred thousand dollars It will make a nice row if that
comes out

Aisy now Aisy now replied Butler doing his best to keep all
phases of the situation in mind We cant tell exactly what the
circumstances were yet He maynt have meant to take so much It may all
come out all right yet The moneys invested Cowperwood hasnt failed
yet It may be put back The thing to be settled on now is whether
anything can be done to save him If hes tellin me the truthand I
never knew him to liehe can get out of this if streetrailway stocks
dont break too heavy in the mornin Im going over to see Henry
Mollenhauer and Mark Simpson Theyre in on this Cowperwood wanted me
to see if I couldnt get them to get the bankers together and have them
stand by the market He thought we might protect our loans by comin on
and buyin and holdin up the price

Owen was running swiftly in his mind over Cowperwoods affairsas much
as he knew of them He felt keenly that the banker ought to be shaken
out This dilemma was his fault not Stenershe felt It was strange
to him that his father did not see it and resent it

You see what it is father he said dramatically after a time
Cowperwoods been using this money of Steners to pick up stocks and
hes in a hole If it hadnt been for this fire hed have got away with
it but now he wants you and Simpson and Mollenhauer and the others to
pull him out Hes a nice fellow and I like him fairly well but youre
a fool if you do as he wants you to He has more than belongs to him
already I heard the other day that he has the Front Street line
and almost all of Green and Coates and that he and Stener own the
Seventeenth and Nineteenth but I didnt believe it Ive been intending
to ask you about it I think Cowperwood has a majority for himself
stowed away somewhere in every instance Stener is just a pawn He moves
him around where he pleases

Owens eyes gleamed avariciously opposingly Cowperwood ought to be
punished sold out driven out of the streetrailway business in which
Owen was anxious to rise

Now you know observed Butler thickly and solemnly I always thought
that young felly was clever but I hardly thought he was as clever as
all that So thats his game Youre pretty shrewd yourself arent you
Well we can fix that if we think well of it But theres more than
that to all this You dont want to forget the Republican party Our
success goes with the success of that you knowand he paused and
looked at his son If Cowperwood should fail and that money couldnt be
put back He broke off abstractedly The thing thats troublin me
is this matter of Stener and the city treasury If somethin aint done
about that it may go hard with the party this fall and with some of
our contracts You dont want to forget that an election is comin
along in November Im wonderin if I ought to call in that one hundred
thousand dollars Its goin to take considerable money to meet my loans
in the mornin

It is a curious matter of psychology but it was only now that the real
difficulties of the situation were beginning to dawn on Butler In
the presence of Cowperwood he was so influenced by that young mans
personality and his magnetic presentation of his need and his own liking
for him that he had not stopped to consider all the phases of his own
relationship to the situation Out here in the cool night air
talking to Owen who was ambitious on his own account and anything but
sentimentally considerate of Cowperwood he was beginning to sober down
and see things in their true light He had to admit that Cowperwood had
seriously compromised the city treasury and the Republican party and
incidentally Butlers own private interests Nevertheless he liked
Cowperwood He was in no way prepared to desert him He was now going
to see Mollenhauer and Simpson as much to save Cowperwood really as
the party and his own affairs And yet a scandal He did not like
thatresented it This young scalawag To think he should be so sly
None the less he still liked him even here and now and was feeling
that he ought to do something to help the young man if anything could
help him He might even leave his hundredthousanddollar loan with him
until the last hour as Cowperwood had requested if the others were
friendly

Well father said Owen after a time I dont see why you need to
worry any more than Mollenhauer or Simpson If you three want to help
him out you can but for the life of me I dont see why you should I
know this thing will have a bad effect on the election if it comes out
before then but it could be hushed up until then couldnt it Anyhow
your streetrailway holdings are more important than this election and
if you can see your way clear to getting the streetrailway lines in
your hands you wont need to worry about any elections My advice to
you is to call that onehundredthousanddollar loan of yours in
the morning and meet the drop in your stocks that way It may make
Cowperwood fail but that wont hurt you any You can go into the market
and buy his stocks I wouldnt be surprised if he would run to you and
ask you to take them You ought to get Mollenhauer and Simpson to scare
Stener so that he wont loan Cowperwood any more money If you dont
Cowperwood will run there and get more Steners in too far now If
Cowperwood wont sell out well and good the chances are he will bust
anyhow and then you can pick up as much on the market as any one
else I think hell sell You cant afford to worry about Steners five
hundred thousand dollars No one told him to loan it Let him look out
for himself It may hurt the party but you can look after that later
You and Mollenhauer can fix the newspapers so they wont talk about it
till after election

Aisy Aisy was all the old contractor would say He was thinking
hard





Chapter XXV


The residence of Henry A Mollenhauer was at that time in a section of
the city which was almost as new as that in which Butler was living It
was on South Broad Street near a handsome library building which had
been recently erected It was a spacious house of the type usually
affected by men of new wealth in those daysa structure four stories in
height of yellow brick and white stone built after no school which
one could readily identify but not unattractive in its architectural
composition A broad flight of steps leading to a wide veranda gave into
a decidedly ornate door which was set on either side by narrow windows
and ornamented to the right and left with paleblue jardinieres of
considerable charm of outline The interior divided into twenty rooms
was paneled and parqueted in the most expensive manner for homes of that
day There was a great receptionhall a large parlor or drawingroom
a diningroom at least thirty feet square paneled in oak and on the
second floor were a musicroom devoted to the talents of Mollenhauers
three ambitious daughters a library and private office for himself a
boudoir and bath for his wife and a conservatory

Mollenhauer was and felt himself to be a very important man His
financial and political judgment was exceedingly keen Although he was
a German or rather an American of German parentage he was a man of a
rather impressive American presence He was tall and heavy and shrewd
and cold His large chest and wide shoulders supported a head of
distinguished proportions both round and long when seen from different
angles The frontal bone descended in a protruding curve over the
nose and projected solemnly over the eyes which burned with a shrewd
inquiring gaze And the nose and mouth and chin below as well as his
smooth hard cheeks confirmed the impression that he knew very well
what he wished in this world and was very able without regard to let or
hindrance to get it It was a big face impressive well modeled He was
an excellent friend of Edward Malia Butlers as such friendships go
and his regard for Mark Simpson was as sincere as that of one tiger for
another He respected ability he was willing to play fair when fair
was the game When it was not the reach of his cunning was not easily
measured

When Edward Butler and his son arrived on this Sunday evening this
distinguished representative of onethird of the citys interests was
not expecting them He was in his library reading and listening to one
of his daughters playing the piano His wife and his other two daughters
had gone to church He was of a domestic turn of mind Still Sunday
evening being an excellent one for conference purposes generally in the
world of politics he was not without the thought that some one or other
of his distinguished confreres might call and when the combination
footman and butler announced the presence of Butler and his son he was
well pleased

So there you are he remarked to Butler genially extending his hand
Im certainly glad to see you And Owen How are you Owen What will
you gentlemen have to drink and what will you smoke I know youll have
something Johnto the servitorsee if you can find something for
these gentlemen I have just been listening to Caroline play but I
think youve frightened her off for the time being

He moved a chair into position for Butler and indicated to Owen another
on the other side of the table In a moment his servant had returned
with a silver tray of elaborate design carrying whiskies and wines of
various dates and cigars in profusion Owen was the new type of young
financier who neither smoked nor drank His father temperately did both

Its a comfortable place you have here said Butler without any
indication of the important mission that had brought him I dont
wonder you stay at home Sunday evenings Whats new in the city

Nothing much so far as I can see replied Mollenhauer pacifically
Things seem to be running smooth enough You dont know anything that
we ought to worry about do you

Well yes said Butler draining off the remainder of a brandy and
soda that had been prepared for him One thing You havent seen an
avenin paper have you

No I havent said Mollenhauer straightening up Is there one out
Whats the trouble anyhow

Nothingexcept Chicagos burning and it looks as though wed have a
little moneystorm here in the morning

You dont say I didnt hear that Theres a paper out is there Well
wellis it much of a fire

The city is burning down so they say put in Owen who was watching
the face of the distinguished politician with considerable interest

Well that is news I must send out and get a paper John he called
His manservant appeared See if you can get me a paper somewhere The
servant disappeared What makes you think that would have anything to
do with us observed Mollenhauer returning to Butler

Well theres one thing that goes with that that I didnt know till a
little while ago and that is that our man Stener is apt to be short in
his accounts unless things come out better than some people seem to
think suggested Butler calmly That might not look so well
before election would it His shrewd gray Irish eyes looked into
Mollenhauers who returned his gaze

Where did you get that queried Mr Mollenhauer icily He hasnt
deliberately taken much money has he How much has he takendo you
know

Quite a bit replied Butler quietly Nearly five hundred thousand
so I understand Only I wouldnt say that it has been taken as yet Its
in danger of being lost

Five hundred thousand exclaimed Mollenhauer in amazement and yet
preserving his usual calm You dont tell me How long has this been
going on What has he been doing with the money

Hes loaned a good dealabout five hundred thousand dollars to this
young Cowperwood in Third Street thats been handlin city
loan Theyve been investin it for themselves in one thing and
anothermostly in buyin up streetrailways At the mention of
streetrailways Mollenhauers impassive countenance underwent a barely
perceptible change This fire accordin to Cowperwood is certain to
produce a panic in the mornin and unless he gets considerable help he
doesnt see how hes to hold out If he doesnt hold out therell be
five hundred thousand dollars missin from the city treasury which cant
be put back Steners out of town and Cowperwoods come to me to see
what can be done about it As a matter of fact hes done a little
business for me in times past and he thought maybe I could help him
nowthat is that I might get you and the Senator to see the big
bankers with me and help support the market in the mornin If we dont
hes goin to fail and he thought the scandal would hurt us in the
election He doesnt appear to me to be workin any gamejust anxious
to save himself and do the square thing by meby us if he can Butler
paused

Mollenhauer sly and secretive himself was apparently not at all moved
by this unexpected development At the same time never having thought
of Stener as having any particular executive or financial ability
he was a little stirred and curious So his treasurer was using money
without his knowing it and now stood in danger of being prosecuted
Cowperwood he knew of only indirectly as one who had been engaged to
handle city loan He had profited by his manipulation of city loan
Evidently the banker had made a fool of Stener and had used the money
for streetrailway shares He and Stener must have quite some private
holdings then That did interest Mollenhauer greatly

Five hundred thousand dollars he repeated when Butler had finished
That is quite a little money If merely supporting the market would
save Cowperwood we might do that although if its a severe panic I do
not see how anything we can do will be of very much assistance to him
If hes in a very tight place and a severe slump is coming it will take
a great deal more than our merely supporting the market to save him
Ive been through that before You dont know what his liabilities are

I do not said Butler

He didnt ask for money you say

He wants me to lave a hundred thousand he has of mine until he sees
whether he can get through or not

Stener is really out of town I suppose Mollenhauer was innately
suspicious

So Cowperwood says We can send and find out

Mollenhauer was thinking of the various aspects of the case Supporting
the market would be all very well if that would save Cowperwood and the
Republican party and his treasurer At the same time Stener could then
be compelled to restore the five hundred thousand dollars to the
city treasury and release his holdings to some onepreferably to
himMollenhauer But here was Butler also to be considered in this
matter What might he not want He consulted with Butler and learned
that Cowperwood had agreed to return the five hundred thousand in case
he could get it together The various streetcar holdings were not asked
after But what assurance had any one that Cowperwood could be so saved
And could or would get the money together And if he were saved would
he give the money back to Stener If he required actual money who would
loan it to him in a time like thisin case a sharp panic was imminent
What security could he give On the other hand under pressure from
the right parties he might be made to surrender all his streetrailway
holdings for a songhis and Steners If he Mollenhauer could get
them he would not particularly care whether the election was lost this
fall or not although he felt satisfied as had Owen that it would not
be lost It could be bought as usual The defalcationif Cowperwoods
failure made Steners loan into onecould be concealed long enough
Mollenhauer thought to win Personally as it came to him now he would
prefer to frighten Stener into refusing Cowperwood additional aid
and then raid the latters streetrailway stock in combination with
everybody elses for that matterSimpsons and Butlers included One
of the big sources of future wealth in Philadelphia lay in these lines
For the present however he had to pretend an interest in saving the
party at the polls

I cant speak for the Senator thats sure pursued Mollenhauer
reflectively I dont know what he may think As for myself I am
perfectly willing to do what I can to keep up the price of stocks if
that will do any good I would do so naturally in order to protect my
loans The thing that we ought to be thinking about in my judgment is
how to prevent exposure in case Mr Cowperwood does fail until after
election We have no assurance of course that however much we support
the market we will be able to sustain it

We have not replied Butler solemnly

Owen thought he could see Cowperwoods approaching doom quite plainly
At that moment the doorbell rang A maid in the absence of the
footman brought in the name of Senator Simpson

Just the man said Mollenhauer Show him up You can see what he
thinks

Perhaps I had better leave you alone now suggested Owen to his
father Perhaps I can find Miss Caroline and she will sing for me
Ill wait for you father he added

Mollenhauer cast him an ingratiating smile and as he stepped out
Senator Simpson walked in

A more interesting type of his kind than Senator Mark Simpson never
flourished in the State of Pennsylvania which has been productive of
interesting types Contrasted with either of the two men who now greeted
him warmly and shook his hand he was physically unimpressive He was
smallfive feet nine inches to Mollenhauers six feet and Butlers
five feet eleven inches and a half and then his face was smooth with a
receding jaw In the other two this feature was prominent Nor were
his eyes as frank as those of Butler nor as defiant as those of
Mollenhauer but for subtlety they were unmatched by eitherdeep
strange receding cavernous eyes which contemplated you as might those
of a cat looking out of a dark hole and suggesting all the artfulness
that has ever distinguished the feline family He had a strange mop of
black hair sweeping down over a fine low white forehead and a skin
as pale and bluish as poor health might make it but there was
nevertheless resident here a strange resistant capable force that
ruled menthe subtlety with which he knew how to feed cupidity with
hope and gain and the ruthlessness with which he repaid those who said
him nay He was a still man as such a man might well have beenfeeble
and fishlike in his handshake wan and slightly lackadaisical in his
smile but speaking always with eyes that answered for every defect

Avnin Mark Im glad to see you was Butlers greeting

How are you Edward came the quiet reply

Well Senator youre not looking any the worse for wear Can I pour
you something

Nothing tonight Henry replied Simpson I havent long to stay I
just stopped by on my way home My wifes over here at the Cavanaghs
and I have to stop by to fetch her

Well its a good thing you dropped in Senator just when you did
began Mollenhauer seating himself after his guest Butler here has
been telling me of a little political problem that has arisen since I
last saw you I suppose youve heard that Chicago is burning

Yes Cavanagh was just telling me It looks to be quite serious I
think the market will drop heavily in the morning

I wouldnt be surprised myself put in Mollenhauer laconically

Heres the paper now said Butler as John the servant came in from
the street bearing the paper in his hand Mollenhauer took it and spread
it out before them It was among the earliest of the extras that were
issued in this country and contained a rather impressive spread of type
announcing that the conflagration in the lake city was growing hourly
worse since its inception the day before

Well that is certainly dreadful said Simpson Im very sorry for
Chicago I have many friends there I shall hope to hear that it is not
so bad as it seems

The man had a rather grandiloquent manner which he never abandoned under
any circumstances

The matter that Butler was telling me about continued Mollenhauer
has something to do with this in a way You know the habit our city
treasurers have of loaning out their money at two per cent

Yes said Simpson inquiringly

Well Mr Stener it seems has been loaning out a good deal of the
citys money to this young Cowperwood in Third Street who has been
handling city loans

You dont say said Simpson putting on an air of surprise Not much
I hope The Senator like Butler and Mollenhauer was profiting
greatly by cheap loans from the same source to various designated city
depositories

Well it seems that Stener has loaned him as much as five hundred
thousand dollars and if by any chance Cowperwood shouldnt be able
to weather this storm Stener is apt to be short that amount and that
wouldnt look so good as a voting proposition to the people in November
do you think Cowperwood owes Mr Butler here one hundred thousand
dollars and because of that he came to see him tonight He wanted
Butler to see if something couldnt be done through us to tide him over
If nothe waved one hand suggestivelywell he might fail

Simpson fingered his strange wide mouth with his delicate hand What
have they been doing with the five hundred thousand dollars he asked

Oh the boys must make a little somethin on the side said Butler
cheerfully I think theyve been buyin up streetrailways for
one thing He stuck his thumbs in the armholes of his vest Both
Mollenhauer and Simpson smiled wan smiles

Quite so said Mollenhauer Senator Simpson merely looked the deep
things that he thought

He too was thinking how useless it was for any one to approach a group
of politicians with a proposition like this particularly in a crisis
such as bid fair to occur He reflected that if he and Butler and
Mollenhauer could get together and promise Cowperwood protection in
return for the surrender of his streetrailway holdings it would be a
very different matter It would be very easy in this case to carry the
city treasury loan along in silence and even issue more money to support
it but it was not sure in the first place that Cowperwood could be
made to surrender his stocks and in the second place that either Butler
or Mollenhauer would enter into any such deal with him Simpson Butler
had evidently come here to say a good word for Cowperwood Mollenhauer
and himself were silent rivals Although they worked together
politically it was toward essentially different financial ends They
were allied in no one particular financial proposition any more than
Mollenhauer and Butler were And besides in all probability Cowperwood
was no fool He was not equally guilty with Stener the latter had
loaned him money The Senator reflected on whether he should broach
some such subtle solution of the situation as had occurred to him to his
colleagues but he decided not Really Mollenhauer was too treacherous
a man to work with on a thing of this kind It was a splendid chance but
dangerous He had better go it alone For the present they should demand
of Stener that he get Cowperwood to return the five hundred thousand
dollars if he could If not Stener could be sacrificed for the benefit
of the party if need be Cowperwoods stocks with this tip as to his
condition would Simpson reflected offer a good opportunity for a
little stockexchange work on the part of his own brokers They could
spread rumors as to Cowperwoods condition and then offer to take his
shares off his handsfor a song of course It was an evil moment that
led Cowperwood to Butler

Well now said the Senator after a prolonged silence I might
sympathize with Mr Cowperwood in his situation and I certainly dont
blame him for buying up streetrailways if he can but I really dont
see what can be done for him very well in this crisis I dont know
about you gentlemen but I am rather certain that I am not in a
position to pick other peoples chestnuts out of the fire if I wanted
to just now It all depends on whether we feel that the danger to
the party is sufficient to warrant our going down into our pockets and
assisting him

At the mention of real money to be loaned Mollenhauer pulled a
long face I cant see that I will be able to do very much for Mr
Cowperwood he sighed

Begad said Buler with a keen sense of humor it looks to me as if
Id better be gettin in my one hundred thousand dollars Thats the
first business of the early mornin Neither Simpson nor Mollenhauer
condescended on this occasion to smile even the wan smile they had
smiled before They merely looked wise and solemn

But this matter of the city treasury now said Senator Simpson after
the atmosphere had been allowed to settle a little is something to
which we shall have to devote a little thought If Mr Cowperwood should
fail and the treasury lose that much money it would embarrass us no
little What lines are they he added as an afterthought that this
man has been particularly interested in

I really dont know replied Butler who did not care to say what Owen
had told him on the drive over

I dont see said Mollenhauer unless we can make Stener get the
money back before this man Cowperwood fails how we can save ourselves
from considerable annoyance later but if we did anything which would
look as though we were going to compel restitution he would probably
shut up shop anyhow So theres no remedy in that direction And it
wouldnt be very kind to our friend Edward here to do it until we hear
how he comes out on his affair He was referring to Butlers loan

Certainly not said Senator Simpson with true political sagacity and
feeling

Ill have that one hundred thousand dollars in the mornin said
Butler and never fear

I think said Simpson if anything comes of this matter that we
will have to do our best to hush it up until after the election The
newspapers can just as well keep silent on that score as not
Theres one thing I would suggestand he was now thinking of
the streetrailway properties which Cowperwood had so judiciously
collectedand that is that the city treasurer be cautioned against
advancing any more money in a situation of this kind He might readily
be compromised into advancing much more I suppose a word from you
Henry would prevent that

Yes I can do that said Mollenhauer solemnly

My judgement would be said Butler in a rather obscure manner
thinking of Cowperwoods mistake in appealing to these noble protectors
of the public that its best to let sleepin dogs run be thimselves

Thus ended Frank Cowperwoods dreams of what Butler and his political
associates might do for him in his hour of distress

The energies of Cowperwood after leaving Butler were devoted to the task
of seeing others who might be of some assistance to him He had left
word with Mrs Stener that if any message came from her husband he was
to be notified at once He hunted up Walter Leigh of Drexel  Co
Avery Stone of Jay Cooke  Co and President Davison of the Girard
National Bank He wanted to see what they thought of the situation and
to negotiate a loan with President Davison covering all his real and
personal property

I cant tell you Frank Walter Leigh insisted I dont know how
things will be running by tomorrow noon Im glad to know how you
stand Im glad youre doing what youre doinggetting all your affairs
in shape It will help a lot Ill favor you all I possibly can But if
the chief decides on a certain group of loans to be called theyll have
to be called thats all Ill do my best to make things look better
If the whole of Chicago is wiped out the insurance companiessome of
them anyhoware sure to go and then look out I suppose youll call
in all your loans

Not any more than I have to

Well thats just the way it is hereor will be

The two men shook hands They liked each other Leigh was of the citys
fashionable coterie a society man to the manner born but with a wealth
of common sense and a great deal of worldly experience

Ill tell you Frank he observed at parting Ive always thought you
were carrying too much streetrailway Its great stuff if you can get
away with it but its just in a pinch like this that youre apt to get
hurt Youve been making money pretty fast out of that and city loans

He looked directly into his longtime friends eyes and they smiled

It was the same with Avery Stone President Davison and others They
had all already heard rumors of disaster when he arrived They were not
sure what the morrow would bring forth It looked very unpromising

Cowperwood decided to stop and see Butler again for he felt certain his
interview with Mollenhauer and Simpson was now over Butler who had
been meditating what he should say to Cowperwood was not unfriendly in
his manner So youre back he said when Cowperwood appeared

Yes Mr Butler

Well Im not sure that Ive been able to do anything for you Im
afraid not Butler said cautiously Its a hard job you set me
Mollenhauer seems to think that hell support the market on his own
account I think he will Simpson has interests which he has to protect
Im going to buy for myself of course

He paused to reflect

I couldnt get them to call a conference with any of the big moneyed
men as yet he added warily Theyd rather wait and see what happens
in the mornin Still I wouldnt be downhearted if I were you If
things turn out very bad they may change their minds I had to tell them
about Stener Its pretty bad but theyre hopin youll come through
and straighten that out I hope so About my own loanwell Ill see
how things are in the mornin If I raisonably can Ill lave it with
you Youd better see me again about it I wouldnt try to get any more
money out of Stener if I were you Its pretty bad as it is

Cowperwood saw at once that he was to get no aid from the politicians
The one thing that disturbed him was this reference to Stener Had they
already communicated with himwarned him If so his own coming to
Butler had been a bad move and yet from the point of view of his
possible failure on the morrow it had been advisable At least now the
politicians knew where he stood If he got in a very tight corner he
would come to Butler againthe politicians could assist him or not
as they chose If they did not help him and he failed and the election
were lost it was their own fault Anyhow if he could see Stener first
the latter would not be such a fool as to stand in his own light in a
crisis like this

Things look rather dark tonight Mr Butler he said smartly but I
still think Ill come through I hope so anyhow Im sorry to have put
you to so much trouble I wish of course that you gentlemen could
see your way clear to assist me but if you cant you cant I have a
number of things that I can do I hope that you will leave your loan as
long as you can

He went briskly out and Butler meditated A clever young chap that
he said Its too bad But he may come out all right at that

Cowperwood hurried to his own home only to find his father awake
and brooding To him he talked with that strong vein of sympathy and
understanding which is usually characteristic of those drawn by ties
of flesh and blood He liked his father He sympathized with his
painstaking effort to get up in the world He could not forget that as a
boy he had had the loving sympathy and interest of his father The loan
which he had from the Third National on somewhat weak Union Street
Railway shares he could probably replace if stocks did not drop too
tremendously He must replace this at all costs But his fathers
investments in streetrailways which had risen with his own ventures
and which now involved an additional two hundred thousandhow could he
protect those The shares were hypothecated and the money was used
for other things Additional collateral would have to be furnished the
several banks carrying them It was nothing except loans loans loans
and the need of protecting them If he could only get an additional
deposit of two or three hundred thousand dollars from Stener But that
in the face of possible financial difficulties was rank criminality
All depended on the morrow

Monday the ninth dawned gray and cheerless He was up with the first
ray of light shaved and dressed and went over under the graygreen
pergola to his fathers house He was up also and stirring about for
he had not been able to sleep His gray eyebrows and gray hair looked
rather shaggy and disheveled and his sidewhiskers anything but
decorative The old gentlemans eyes were tired and his face was gray
Cowperwood could see that he was worrying He looked up from a small
ornate escritoire of buhl which Ellsworth had found somewhere and
where he was quietly tabulating a list of his resources and liabilities
Cowperwood winced He hated to see his father worried but he could not
help it He had hoped sincerely when they built their houses together
that the days of worry for his father had gone forever

Counting up he asked familiarly with a smile He wanted to hearten
the old gentleman as much as possible

I was just running over my affairs again to see where I stood in
case He looked quizzically at his son and Frank smiled again

I wouldnt worry father I told you how I fixed it so that Butler and
that crowd will support the market I have Rivers and Targool and Harry
Eltinge on change helping me sell out and they are the best men there
Theyll handle the situation carefully I couldnt trust Ed or Joe in
this case for the moment they began to sell everybody would know what
was going on with me This way my men will seem like bears hammering the
market but not hammering too hard I ought to be able to unload enough
at ten points off to raise five hundred thousand The market may not go
lower than that You cant tell It isnt going to sink indefinitely
If I just knew what the big insurance companies were going to do The
morning paper hasnt come yet has it

He was going to pull a bell but remembered that the servants would
scarcely be up as yet He went to the front door himself There were the
Press and the Public Ledger lying damp from the presses He picked them
up and glanced at the front pages His countenance fell On one the
Press was spread a great black map of Chicago a most funereallooking
thing the black portion indicating the burned section He had never
seen a map of Chicago before in just this clear definite way That
white portion was Lake Michigan and there was the Chicago River
dividing the city into three almost equal portionsthe north side the
west side the south side He saw at once that the city was curiously
arranged somewhat like Philadelphia and that the business section was
probably an area of two or three miles square set at the juncture of
the three sides and lying south of the main stem of the river where
it flowed into the lake after the southwest and northwest branches had
united to form it This was a significant central area but according
to this map it was all burned out Chicago in Ashes ran a great
sideheading set in heavily leaded black type It went on to detail the
sufferings of the homeless the number of the dead the number of those
whose fortunes had been destroyed Then it descanted upon the probable
effect in the East Insurance companies and manufacturers might not be
able to meet the great strain of all this

Damn said Cowperwood gloomily I wish I were out of this
stockjobbing business I wish I had never gotten into it He returned
to his drawingroom and scanned both accounts most carefully

Then though it was still early he and his father drove to his office
There were already messages awaiting him a dozen or more to cancel
or sell While he was standing there a messengerboy brought him three
more One was from Stener and said that he would be back by twelve
oclock the very earliest he could make it Cowperwood was relieved and
yet distressed He would need large sums of money to meet various loans
before three Every hour was precious He must arrange to meet Stener at
the station and talk to him before any one else should see him Clearly
this was going to be a hard dreary strenuous day

Third Street by the time he reached there was stirring with other
bankers and brokers called forth by the exigencies of the occasion
There was a suspicious hurrying of feetthat intensity which makes
all the difference in the world between a hundred people placid and a
hundred people disturbed At the exchange the atmosphere was feverish
At the sound of the gong the staccato uproar began Its metallic
vibrations were still in the air when the two hundred men who composed
this local organization at its utmost stress of calculation threw
themselves upon each other in a gibbering struggle to dispose of or
seize bargains of the hour The interests were so varied that it was
impossible to say at which pole it was best to sell or buy

Targool and Rivers had been delegated to stay at the center of things
Joseph and Edward to hover around on the outside and to pick up such
opportunities of selling as might offer a reasonable return on the
stock The bears were determined to jam things down and it all
depended on how well the agents of Mollenhauer Simpson Butler and
others supported things in the streetrailway world whether those stocks
retained any strength or not The last thing Butler had said the night
before was that they would do the best they could They would buy up to
a certain point Whether they would support the market indefinitely he
would not say He could not vouch for Mollenhauer and Simpson Nor did
he know the condition of their affairs

While the excitement was at its highest Cowperwood came in As he
stood in the door looking to catch the eye of Rivers the change gong
sounded and trading stopped All the brokers and traders faced about
to the little balcony where the secretary of the change made his
announcements and there he stood the door open behind him a small
dark clerkly man of thirtyeight or forty whose spare figure and pale
face bespoke the methodic mind that knows no venturous thought In his
right hand he held a slip of white paper

The American Fire Insurance Company of Boston announces its inability
to meet its obligations The gong sounded again

Immediately the storm broke anew more voluble than before because
if after one hour of investigation on this Monday morning one insurance
company had gone down what would four or five hours or a day or two
bring forth It meant that men who had been burned out in Chicago would
not be able to resume business It meant that all loans connected
with this concern had been or would be called now And the cries of
frightened bulls offering thousand and five thousand lot holdings in
Northern Pacific Illinois Central Reading Lake Shore Wabash in all
the local streetcar lines and in Cowperwoods city loans at constantly
falling prices was sufficient to take the heart out of all concerned
He hurried to Arthur Riverss side in the lull but there was little he
could say

It looks as though the Mollenhauer and Simpson crowds arent doing much
for the market he observed gravely

Theyve had advices from New York explained Rivers solemnly It
cant be supported very well There are three insurance companies over
there on the verge of quitting I understand I expect to see them
posted any minute

They stepped apart from the pandemonium to discuss ways and means
Under his agreement with Stener Cowperwood could buy up to one hundred
thousand dollars of city loan above the customary wash sales or market
manipulation by which they were making money This was in case the
market had to be genuinely supported He decided to buy sixty thousand
dollars worth now and use this to sustain his loans elsewhere Stener
would pay him for this instantly giving him more ready cash It
might help him in one way and another and anyhow it might tend to
strengthen the other securities long enough at least to allow him to
realize a little something now at better than ruinous rates If only
he had the means to go short on this market If only doing so did not
really mean ruin to his present position It was characteristic of the
man that even in this crisis he should be seeing how the very thing that
of necessity because of his present obligations might ruin him might
also under slightly different conditions yield him a great harvest He
could not take advantage of it however He could not be on both sides
of this market It was either bear or bull and of necessity he was
bull It was strange but true His subtlety could not avail him here
He was about to turn and hurry to see a certain banker who might loan
him something on his house when the gong struck again Once more
trading ceased Arthur Rivers from his position at the State securities
post where city loan was sold and where he had started to buy for
Cowperwood looked significantly at him Newton Targool hurried to
Cowperwoods side

Youre up against it he exclaimed I wouldnt try to sell against
this market Its no use Theyre cutting the ground from under you
The bottoms out Things are bound to turn in a few days Cant you hold
out Heres more trouble

He raised his eyes to the announcers balcony

The Eastern and Western Fire Insurance Company of New York announces
that it cannot meet its obligations

A low sound something like Haw broke forth The announcers gavel
struck for order

The Erie Fire Insurance Company of Rochester announces that it cannot
meet its obligations

Again that Haaaw

Once more the gavel

The American Trust Company of New York has suspended payment

Haaaw

The storm was on

What do you think asked Targool You cant brave this storm Cant
you quit selling and hold out for a few days Why not sell short

They ought to close this thing up Cowperwood said shortly It would
be a splendid way out Then nothing could be done

He hurried to consult with those who finding themselves in a similar
predicament with himself might use their influence to bring it about
It was a sharp trick to play on those who now finding the market
favorable to their designs in its falling condition were harvesting a
fortune But what was that to him Business was business There was no
use selling at ruinous figures and he gave his lieutenants orders to
stop Unless the bankers favored him heavily or the stock exchange
was closed or Stener could be induced to deposit an additional three
hundred thousand with him at once he was ruined He hurried down
the street to various bankers and brokers suggesting that they do
thisclose the exchange At a few minutes before twelve oclock
he drove rapidly to the station to meet Stener but to his great
disappointment the latter did not arrive It looked as though he had
missed his train Cowperwood sensed something some trick and decided
to go to the city hall and also to Steners house Perhaps he had
returned and was trying to avoid him

Not finding him at his office he drove direct to his house Here he
was not surprised to meet Stener just coming out looking very pale and
distraught At the sight of Cowperwood he actually blanched

Why hello Frank he exclaimed sheepishly where do you come from

Whats up George asked Cowperwood I thought you were coming into
Broad Street

So I was returned Stener foolishly but I thought I would get off
at West Philadelphia and change my clothes Ive a lot of things
to tend to yet this afternoon I was coming in to see you After
Cowperwoods urgent telegram this was silly but the young banker let it
pass

Jump in George he said I have something very important to talk to
you about I told you in my telegram about the likelihood of a panic
Its on There isnt a moment to lose Stocks are way down and most of
my loans are being called I want to know if you wont let me have three
hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a few days at four or five per
cent Ill pay it all back to you I need it very badly If I dont get
it Im likely to fail You know what that means George It will tie up
every dollar I have Those streetcar holdings of yours will be tied up
with me I wont be able to let you realize on them and that will put
those loans of mine from the treasury in bad shape You wont be able
to put the money back and you know what that means Were in this thing
together I want to see you through safely but I cant do it without
your help I had to go to Butler last night to see about a loan of his
and Im doing my best to get money from other sources But I cant see
my way through on this Im afraid unless youre willing to help
me Cowperwood paused He wanted to put the whole case clearly and
succinctly to him before he had a chance to refuseto make him realize
it as his own predicament

As a matter of fact what Cowperwood had keenly suspected was literally
true Stener had been reached The moment Butler and Simpson had left
him the night before Mollenhauer had sent for his very able secretary
Abner Sengstack and despatched him to learn the truth about Steners
whereabouts Sengstack had then sent a long wire to Strobik who was
with Stener urging him to caution the latter against Cowperwood The
state of the treasury was known Stener and Strobik were to be met by
Sengstack at Wilmington this to forefend against the possibility of
Cowperwoods reaching Stener firstand the whole state of affairs
made perfectly plain No more money was to be used under penalty of
prosecution If Stener wanted to see any one he must see Mollenhauer
Sengstack having received a telegram from Strobik informing him of
their proposed arrival at noon the next day had proceeded to Wilmington
to meet them The result was that Stener did not come direct into the
business heart of the city but instead got off at West Philadelphia
proposing to go first to his house to change his clothes and then to see
Mollenhauer before meeting Cowperwood He was very badly frightened and
wanted time to think

I cant do it Frank he pleaded piteously Im in pretty bad in
this matter Mollenhauers secretary met the train out at Wilmington
just now to warn me against this situation and Strobik is against it
They know how much money Ive got outstanding You or somebody has told
them I cant go against Mollenhauer I owe everything Ive got to him
in a way He got me this place

Listen George Whatever you do at this time dont let this political
loyalty stuff cloud your judgment Youre in a very serious position and
so am I If you dont act for yourself with me now no one is going to
act for younow or laterno one And later will be too late I proved
that last night when I went to Butler to get help for the two of us
They all know about this business of our streetrailway holdings and
they want to shake us out and thats the big and little of itnothing
more and nothing less Its a case of dog eat dog in this game and
this particular situation and its up to us to save ourselves against
everybody or go down together and thats just what Im here to tell
you Mollenhauer doesnt care any more for you today than he does
for that lamppost It isnt that money youve paid out to me thats
worrying him but whos getting something for it and what Well they
know that you and I are getting streetrailways dont you see and they
dont want us to have them Once they get those out of our hands they
wont waste another day on you or me Cant you see that Once weve
lost all weve invested youre down and so am Iand no one is going to
turn a hand for you or me politically or in any other way I want you to
understand that George because its true And before you say you wont
or you will do anything because Mollenhauer says so you want to think
over what I have to tell you

He was in front of Stener now looking him directly in the eye and by
the kinetic force of his mental way attempting to make Stener take the
one step that might save himCowperwoodhowever little in the long run
it might do for Stener And more interesting still he did not care
Stener as he saw him now was a pawn in whosoevers hands he happened
to be at the time and despite Mr Mollenhauer and Mr Simpson and Mr
Butler he proposed to attempt to keep him in his own hands if possible
And so he stood there looking at him as might a snake at a bird
determined to galvanize him into selfish selfinterest if possible But
Stener was so frightened that at the moment it looked as though there
was little to be done with him His face was a grayishblue his eyelids
and eye rings puffy and his hands and lips moist God what a hole he
was in now

Say thats all right Frank he exclaimed desperately I know what
you say is true But look at me and my position if I do give you this
money What cant they do to me and wont If you only look at it from
my point of view If only you hadnt gone to Butler before you saw me

As though I could see you George when you were off duck shooting and
when I was wiring everywhere I knew to try to get in touch with you How
could I The situation had to be met Besides I thought Butler was more
friendly to me than he proved But theres no use being angry with me
now George for going to Butler as I did and anyhow you cant afford
to be now Were in this thing together Its a case of sink or swim
for just us twonot any one elsejust usdont you get that Butler
couldnt or wouldnt do what I wanted him to doget Mollenhauer and
Simpson to support the market Instead of that they are hammering it
They have a game of their own Its to shake us outcant you see that
Take everything that you and I have gathered It is up to you and me
George to save ourselves and thats what Im here for now If you
dont let me have three hundred and fifty thousand dollarsthree
hundred thousand anyhowyou and I are ruined It will be worse for
you George than for me for Im not involved in this thing in any
waynot legally anyhow But thats not what Im thinking of What I
want to do is to save us bothput us on easy street for the rest of our
lives whatever they say or do and its in your power with my help to
do that for both of us Cant you see that I want to save my business
so then I can help you to save your name and money He paused hoping
this had convinced Stener but the latter was still shaking

But what can I do Frank he pleaded weakly I cant go against
Mollenhauer They can prosecute me if I do that They can do it anyhow
I cant do that Im not strong enough If they didnt know if you
hadnt told them it might be different but this way He shook his
head sadly his gray eyes filled with a pale distress

George replied Cowperwood who realized now that only the sternest
arguments would have any effect here dont talk about what I did What
I did I had to do Youre in danger of losing your head and your nerve
and making a serious mistake here and I dont want to see you make
it I have five hundred thousand of the citys money invested for
youpartly for me and partly for you but more for you than for
mewhich by the way was not trueand here you are hesitating in
an hour like this as to whether you will protect your interest or not
I cant understand it This is a crisis George Stocks are tumbling on
every sideeverybodys stocks Youre not alone in thisneither am I
This is a panic brought on by a fire and you cant expect to come out
of a panic alive unless you do something to protect yourself You say
you owe your place to Mollenhauer and that youre afraid of what hell
do If you look at your own situation and mine youll see that it
doesnt make much difference what he does so long as I dont fail If
I fail where are you Whos going to save you from prosecution Will
Mollenhauer or any one else come forward and put five hundred thousand
dollars in the treasury for you He will not If Mollenhauer and the
others have your interests at heart why arent they helping me on
change today Ill tell you why They want your streetrailway holdings
and mine and they dont care whether you go to jail afterward or
not Now if youre wise you will listen to me Ive been loyal to you
havent I Youve made money through melots of it If youre wise
George youll go to your office and write me your check for three
hundred thousand dollars anyhow before you do a single other thing
Dont see anybody and dont do anything till youve done that You cant
be hung any more for a sheep than you can for a lamb No one can prevent
you from giving me that check Youre the city treasurer Once I have
that I can see my way out of this and Ill pay it all back to you next
week or the week afterthis panic is sure to end in that time With
that put back in the treasury we can see them about the five hundred
thousand a little later In three months or less I can fix it so that
you can put that back As a matter of fact I can do it in fifteen days
once I am on my feet again Time is all I want You wont have lost
your holdings and nobody will cause you any trouble if you put the
money back They dont care to risk a scandal any more than you do Now
whatll you do George Mollenhauer cant stop you from doing this any
more than I can make you Your life is in your own hands What will you
do

Stener stood there ridiculously meditating when as a matter of fact
his very financial blood was oozing away Yet he was afraid to act He
was afraid of Mollenhauer afraid of Cowperwood afraid of life and of
himself The thought of panic loss was not so much a definite thing
connected with his own property his money as it was with his social
and political standing in the community Few people have the sense of
financial individuality strongly developed They do not know what it
means to be a controller of wealth to have that which releases the
sources of social actionits medium of exchange They want money but
not for moneys sake They want it for what it will buy in the way
of simple comforts whereas the financier wants it for what it will
controlfor what it will represent in the way of dignity force power
Cowperwood wanted money in that way Stener not That was why he had
been so ready to let Cowperwood act for him and now when he should
have seen more clearly than ever the significance of what Cowperwood was
proposing he was frightened and his reason obscured by such things
as Mollenhauers probable opposition and rage Cowperwoods possible
failure his own inability to face a real crisis Cowperwoods innate
financial ability did not reassure Stener in this hour The banker was
too young too new Mollenhauer was older richer So was Simpson so
was Butler These men with their wealth represented the big forces
the big standards in his world And besides did not Cowperwood himself
confess that he was in great dangerthat he was in a corner That was
the worst possible confession to make to Steneralthough under the
circumstances it was the only one that could be madefor he had no
courage to face danger

So it was that now Stener stood by Cowperwood meditatingpale
flaccid unable to see the main line of his interests quickly unable
to follow it definitely surely vigorouslywhile they drove to his
office Cowperwood entered it with him for the sake of continuing his
plea

Well George he said earnestly I wish youd tell me Times short
We havent a moment to lose Give me the money wont you and Ill
get out of this quick We havent a moment I tell you Dont let those
people frighten you off Theyre playing their own little game you play
yours

I cant Frank said Stener finally very weakly his sense of his
own financial future overcome for the time being by the thought of
Mollenhauers hard controlling face Ill have to think I cant do it
right now Strobik just left me before I saw you and

Good God George exclaimed Cowperwood scornfully dont talk about
Strobik Whats he got to do with it Think of yourself Think of where
you will be Its your futurenot Strobiksthat you have to think
of

I know Frank persisted Stener weakly but really I dont see how
I can Honestly I dont You say yourself youre not sure whether you
can come out of things all right and three hundred thousand more is
three hundred thousand more I cant Frank I really cant It wouldnt
be right Besides I want to talk to Mollenhauer first anyhow

Good God how you talk exploded Cowperwood angrily looking at him
with illconcealed contempt Go ahead See Mollenhauer Let him tell
you how to cut your own throat for his benefit It wont be right to
loan me three hundred thousand dollars more but it will be right to let
the five hundred thousand dollars you have loaned stand unprotected
and lose it Thats right isnt it Thats just what you propose to
dolose it and everything else besides I want to tell you what it
is Georgeyouve lost your mind Youve let a single message from
Mollenhauer frighten you to death and because of that youre going to
risk your fortune your reputation your standingeverything Do you
really realize what this means if I fail You will be a convict I tell
you George You will go to prison This fellow Mollenhauer who is so
quick to tell you what not to do now will be the last man to turn a
hand for you once youre down Why look at meIve helped you havent
I Havent I handled your affairs satisfactorily for you up to now What
in Heavens name has got into you What have you to be afraid of

Stener was just about to make another weak rejoinder when the door
from the outer office opened and Albert Stires Steners chief clerk
entered Stener was too flustered to really pay any attention to Stires
for the moment but Cowperwood took matters in his own hands

What is it Albert he asked familiarly

Mr Sengstack from Mr Mollenhauer to see Mr Stener

At the sound of this dreadful name Stener wilted like a leaf Cowperwood
saw it He realized that his last hope of getting the three hundred
thousand dollars was now probably gone Still he did not propose to give
up as yet

Well George he said after Albert had gone out with instructions
that Stener would see Sengstack in a moment I see how it is This
man has got you mesmerized You cant act for yourself nowyoure too
frightened Ill let it rest for the present Ill come back But for
Heavens sake pull yourself together Think what it means Im telling
you exactly whats going to happen if you dont Youll be independently
rich if you do Youll be a convict if you dont

And deciding he would make one more effort in the street before seeing
Butler again he walked out briskly jumped into his light spring
runabout waiting outsidea handsome little yellowglazed vehicle
with a yellow leather cushion seat drawn by a young highstepping bay
mareand sent her scudding from door to door throwing down the lines
indifferently and bounding up the steps of banks and into office doors

But all without avail All were interested considerate but things were
very uncertain The Girard National Bank refused an hours grace and he
had to send a large bundle of his most valuable securities to cover
his stock shrinkage there Word came from his father at two that as
president of the Third National he would have to call for his one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars due there The directors were
suspicious of his stocks He at once wrote a check against fifty
thousand dollars of his deposits in that bank took twentyfive thousand
of his available office funds called a loan of fifty thousand against
Tighe  Co and sold sixty thousand Green  Coates a line he had been
tentatively dabbling in for onethird their valueand combining the
general results sent them all to the Third National His father was
immensely relieved from one point of view but sadly depressed from
another He hurried out at the noonhour to see what his own holdings
would bring He was compromising himself in a way by doing it but his
parental heart as well as is own financial interests were involved
By mortgaging his house and securing loans on his furniture carriages
lots and stocks he managed to raise one hundred thousand in cash and
deposited it in his own bank to Franks credit but it was a very light
anchor to windward in this swirling storm at that Frank had been
counting on getting all of his loans extended three or four days at
least Reviewing his situation at two oclock of this Monday afternoon
he said to himself thoughtfully but grimly Well Stener has to loan me
three hundred thousandthats all there is to it And Ill have to see
Butler now or hell be calling his loan before three

He hurried out and was off to Butlers house driving like mad





Chapter XXVI


Things had changed greatly since last Cowperwood had talked with Butler
Although most friendly at the time the proposition was made that he
should combine with Mollenhauer and Simpson to sustain the market alas
now on this Monday morning at nine oclock an additional complication
had been added to the already tangled situation which had changed
Butlers attitude completely As he was leaving his home to enter his
runabout at nine oclock in the morning of this same day in which
Cowperwood was seeking Steners aid the postman coming up had handed
Butler four letters all of which he paused for a moment to glance at
One was from a subcontractor by the name of OHiggins the second was
from Father Michel his confessor of St Timothys thanking him for
a contribution to the parish poor fund a third was from Drexel  Co
relating to a deposit and the fourth was an anonymous communication on
cheap stationery from some one who was apparently not very literatea
woman most likelywritten in a scrawling hand which read

 DEAR SIRThis is to warn you that your daughter
 Aileen is running around with a man that she shouldnt
 Frank A Cowperwood the banker If you dont believe
 it watch the house at 931 North Tenth Street Then you
 can see for yourself

There was neither signature nor mark of any kind to indicate from whence
it might have come Butler got the impression strongly that it might
have been written by some one living in the vicinity of the number
indicated His intuitions were keen at times As a matter of fact it
was written by a girl a member of St Timothys Church who did live
in the vicinity of the house indicated and who knew Aileen by sight
and was jealous of her airs and her position She was a thin anemic
dissatisfied creature who had the type of brain which can reconcile
the gratification of personal spite with a comforting sense of having
fulfilled a moral duty Her home was some five doors north of the
unregistered Cowperwood domicile on the opposite side of the street and
by degrees in the course of time she made out or imagined that she
had the significance of this institution piecing fact to fancy and
fusing all with that keen intuition which is so closely related to fact
The result was eventually this letter which now spread clear and grim
before Butlers eyes

The Irish are a philosophic as well as a practical race Their first
and strongest impulse is to make the best of a bad situationto put a
better face on evil than it normally wears On first reading these
lines the intelligence they conveyed sent a peculiar chill over Butlers
sturdy frame His jaw instinctively closed and his gray eyes narrowed
Could this be true If it were not would the author of the letter say
so practically If you dont believe it watch the house at 931
North Tenth Street Wasnt that in itself proof positivethe hard
matteroffact realism of it And this was the man who had come to him
the night before seeking aidwhom he had done so much to assist There
forced itself into his naturally slowmoving but rather accurate mind
a sense of the distinction and charm of his daughtera considerably
sharper picture than he had ever had before and at the same time a
keener understanding of the personality of Frank Algernon Cowperwood
How was it he had failed to detect the real subtlety of this man How
was it he had never seen any sign of it if there had been anything
between Cowperwood and Aileen

Parents are frequently inclined because of a timeflattered sense of
security to take their children for granted Nothing ever has happened
so nothing ever will happen They see their children every day and
through the eyes of affection and despite their natural charm and
their own strong parental love the children are apt to become not only
commonplaces but ineffably secure against evil Mary is naturally
a good girla little wild but what harm can befall her John is a
straightforward steadygoing boyhow could he get into trouble The
astonishment of most parents at the sudden accidental revelation of evil
in connection with any of their children is almost invariably pathetic
My John My Mary Impossible But it is possible Very possible
Decidedly likely Some through lack of experience or understanding
or both grow hard and bitter on the instant They feel themselves
astonishingly abased in the face of notable tenderness and sacrifice
Others collapse before the grave manifestation of the insecurity and
uncertainty of lifethe mystic chemistry of our being Still others
taught roughly by life or endowed with understanding or intuition
or both see in this the latest manifestation of that incomprehensible
chemistry which we call life and personality and knowing that it is
quite vain to hope to gainsay it save by greater subtlety put the best
face they can upon the matter and call a truce until they can think We
all know that life is unsolvablewe who think The remainder imagine a
vain thing and are full of sound and fury signifying nothing

So Edward Butler being a man of much wit and hard grim experience
stood there on his doorstep holding in his big rough hand his thin
slip of cheap paper which contained such a terrific indictment of his
daughter There came to him now a picture of her as she was when she was
a very little girlshe was his first baby girland how keenly he had
felt about her all these years She had been a beautiful childher
redgold hair had been pillowed on his breast many a time and his hard
rough fingers had stroked her soft cheeks lo these thousands of times
Aileen his lovely dashing daughter of twentythree He was lost in
dark strange unhappy speculations without any present ability to
think or say or do the right thing He did not know what the right thing
was he finally confessed to himself Aileen Aileen His Aileen If her
mother knew this it would break her heart She mustnt She mustnt And
yet mustnt she

The heart of a father The world wanders into many strange bypaths of
affection The love of a mother for her children is dominant leonine
selfish and unselfish It is concentric The love of a husband for his
wife or of a lover for his sweetheart is a sweet bond of agreement and
exchange trade in a lovely contest The love of a father for his son
or daughter where it is love at all is a broad generous sad
contemplative giving without thought of return a hail and farewell to a
troubled traveler whom he would do much to guard a balanced judgment of
weakness and strength with pity for failure and pride in achievement
It is a lovely generous philosophic blossom which rarely asks too
much and seeks only to give wisely and plentifully That my boy may
succeed That my daughter may be happy Who has not heard and dwelt
upon these twin fervors of fatherly wisdom and tenderness

As Butler drove downtown his huge slowmoving in some respects chaotic
mind turned over as rapidly as he could all of the possibilities in
connection with this unexpected sad and disturbing revelation Why had
Cowperwood not been satisfied with his wife Why should he enter
into his Butlers home of all places to establish a clandestine
relationship of this character Was Aileen in any way to blame She was
not without mental resources of her own She must have known what she
was doing She was a good Catholic or at least had been raised
so All these years she had been going regularly to confession and
communion True of late Butler had noticed that she did not care so
much about going to church would sometimes make excuses and stay at
home on Sundays but she had gone as a rule And now nowhis thoughts
would come to the end of a blind alley and then he would start back as
it were mentally to the center of things and begin all over again

He went up the stairs to his own office slowly He went in and sat down
and thought and thought Ten oclock came and eleven His son bothered
him with an occasional matter of interest but finding him moody
finally abandoned him to his own speculations It was twelve and then
one and he was still sitting there thinking when the presence of
Cowperwood was announced

Cowperwood on finding Butler not at home and not encountering Aileen
had hurried up to the office of the Edward Butler Contracting Company
which was also the center of some of Butlers streetrailway interests
The floor space controlled by the company was divided into the
usual official compartments with sections for the bookkeepers the
roadmanagers the treasurer and so on Owen Butler and his father
had small but attractively furnished offices in the rear where they
transacted all the important business of the company

During this drive curiously by reason of one of those strange
psychologic intuitions which so often precede a human difficulty of one
sort or another he had been thinking of Aileen He was thinking of the
peculiarity of his relationship with her and of the fact that now he
was running to her father for assistance As he mounted the stairs he
had a peculiar sense of the untoward but he could not in his view
of life give it countenance One glance at Butler showed him that
something had gone amiss He was not so friendly his glance was dark
and there was a certain sternness to his countenance which had never
previously been manifested there in Cowperwoods memory He perceived at
once that here was something different from a mere intention to refuse
him aid and call his loan What was it Aileen It must be that
Somebody had suggested something They had been seen together Well
even so nothing could be proved Butler would obtain no sign from him
But his loanthat was to be called surely And as for an additional
loan he could see now before a word had been said that that thought
was useless

I came to see you about that loan of yours Mr Butler he observed
briskly with an oldtime jaunty air You could not have told from his
manner or his face that he had observed anything out of the ordinary

Butler who was alone in the roomOwen having gone into an adjoining
roommerely stared at him from under his shaggy brows

Ill have to have that money he said brusquely darkly

An oldtime Irish rage suddenly welled up in his bosom as he
contemplated this jaunty sophisticated undoer of his daughters virtue
He fairly glared at him as he thought of him and her

I judged from the way things were going this morning that you might
want it Cowperwood replied quietly without sign of tremor The
bottoms out I see

The bottoms out and itll not be put back soon Im thinkin Ill
have to have whats belongin to me today I havent any time to
spare

Very well replied Cowperwood who saw clearly how treacherous the
situation was The old man was in a dour mood His presence was an
irritation to him for some reasona deadly provocation Cowperwood
felt clearly that it must be Aileen that he must know or suspect
something

He must pretend business hurry and end this Im sorry I thought
I might get an extension but thats all right I can get the money
though Ill send it right over

He turned and walked quickly to the door

Butler got up He had thought to manage this differently

He had thought to denounce or even assault this man He was about to
make some insinuating remark which would compel an answer some direct
charge but Cowperwood was out and away as jaunty as ever

The old man was flustered enraged disappointed He opened the small
office door which led into the adjoining room and called Owen

Yes father

Send over to Cowperwoods office and get that money

You decided to call it eh

I have

Owen was puzzled by the old mans angry mood He wondered what it all
meant but thought he and Cowperwood might have had a few words He went
out to his desk to write a note and call a clerk Butler went to the
window and stared out He was angry bitter brutal in his vein

The dirty dog he suddenly exclaimed to himself in a low voice Ill
take every dollar hes got before Im through with him Ill send him to
jail I will Ill break him I will Wait

He clinched his big fists and his teeth

Ill fix him Ill show him The dog The damned scoundrel

Never in his life before had he been so bitter so cruel so relentless
in his mood

He walked his office floor thinking what he could do Question
Aileenthat was what he would do If her face or her lips told him
that his suspicion was true he would deal with Cowperwood later This
city treasurer business now It was not a crime in so far as Cowperwood
was concerned but it might be made to be

So now telling the clerk to say to Owen that he had gone down the
street for a few moments he boarded a streetcar and rode out to his
home where he found his elder daughter just getting ready to go out
She wore a purplevelvet street dress edged with narrow flat gilt
braid and a striking goldandpurple turban She had on dainty new
boots of bronze kid and long gloves of lavender suede In her ears was
one of her latest affectations a pair of long jet earrings The old
Irishman realized on this occasion when he saw her perhaps more
clearly than he ever had in his life that he had grown a bird of rare
plumage

Where are you going daughter he asked with a rather unsuccessful
attempt to conceal his fear distress and smoldering anger

To the library she said easily and yet with a sudden realization
that all was not right with her father His face was too heavy and gray
He looked tired and gloomy

Come up to my office a minute he said I want to see you before you
go

Aileen heard this with a strange feeling of curiosity and wonder It was
not customary for her father to want to see her in his office just when
she was going out and his manner indicated in this instance that
the exceptional procedure portended a strange revelation of some kind
Aileen like every other person who offends against a rigid convention
of the time was conscious of and sensitive to the possible disastrous
results which would follow exposure She had often thought about what
her family would think if they knew what she was doing she had never
been able to satisfy herself in her mind as to what they would do Her
father was a very vigorous man But she had never known him to be cruel
or cold in his attitude toward her or any other member of the family
and especially not toward her Always he seemed too fond of her to be
completely alienated by anything that might happen yet she could not be
sure

Butler led the way planting his big feet solemnly on the steps as he
went up Aileen followed with a single glance at herself in the tall
piermirror which stood in the hall realizing at once how charming she
looked and how uncertain she was feeling about what was to follow
What could her father want It made the color leave her cheeks for the
moment as she thought what he might want

Butler strolled into his stuffy room and sat down in the big leather
chair disproportioned to everything else in the chamber but which
nevertheless accompanied his desk Before him against the light was
the visitors chair in which he liked to have those sit whose faces he
was anxious to study When Aileen entered he motioned her to it which
was also ominous to her and said Sit down there

She took the seat not knowing what to make of his procedure On the
instant her promise to Cowperwood to deny everything whatever happened
came back to her If her father was about to attack her on that score
he would get no satisfaction she thought She owed it to Frank Her
pretty face strengthened and hardened on the instant Her small white
teeth set themselves in two even rows and her father saw quite plainly
that she was consciously bracing herself for an attack of some kind He
feared by this that she was guilty and he was all the more distressed
ashamed outraged made wholly unhappy He fumbled in the lefthand
pocket of his coat and drew forth from among the various papers the
fatal communication so cheap in its physical texture His big fingers
fumbled almost tremulously as he fished the lettersheet out of the
small envelope and unfolded it without saying a word Aileen watched
his face and his hands wondering what it could be that he had here He
handed the paper over small in his big fist and said Read that

Aileen took it and for a second was relieved to be able to lower her
eyes to the paper Her relief vanished in a second when she realized
how in a moment she would have to raise them again and look him in the
face

 DEAR SIRThis is to warn you that your daughter
 Aileen is running around with a man that she shouldnt
 Frank A Cowperwood the banker If you dont believe
 it watch the house at 931 North Tenth Street Then you
 can see for yourself

In spite of herself the color fled from her cheeks instantly only to
come back in a hot defiant wave

Why what a lie she said lifting her eyes to her fathers To think
that any one should write such a thing of me How dare they I think
its a shame

Old Butler looked at her narrowly solemnly He was not deceived to any
extent by her bravado If she were really innocent he knew she would
have jumped to her feet in her defiant way Protest would have been
written all over her As it was she only stared haughtily He read
through her eager defiance to the guilty truth

How do ye know daughter that I havent had the house watched he
said quizzically How do ye know that ye havent been seen goin in
there

Only Aileens solemn promise to her lover could have saved her from
this subtle thrust As it was she paled nervously but she saw Frank
Cowperwood solemn and distinguished asking her what she would say if
she were caught

Its a lie she said catching her breath I wasnt at any house at
that number and no one saw me going in there How can you ask me that
father

In spite of his mixed feelings of uncertainty and yet unshakable
belief that his daughter was guilty he could not help admiring
her courageshe was so defiant as she sat there so set in her
determination to lie and thus defend herself Her beauty helped her in
his mood raised her in his esteem After all what could you do with
a woman of this kind She was not a tenyearold girl any more as in a
way he sometimes continued to fancy her

Ye oughtnt to say that if it isnt true Aileen he said Ye
oughtnt to lie Its against your faith Why would anybody write a
letter like that if it wasnt so

But its not so insisted Aileen pretending anger and outraged
feeling and I dont think you have any right to sit there and say
that to me I havent been there and Im not running around with Mr
Cowperwood Why I hardly know the man except in a social way

Butler shook his head solemnly

Its a great blow to me daughter Its a great blow to me he said
Im willing to take your word if ye say so but I cant help thinkin
what a sad thing it would be if ye were lyin to me I havent had the
house watched I only got this this mornin And whats written here may
not be so I hope it isnt But well not say any more about that now
If there is anythin in it and ye havent gone too far yet to save
yourself I want ye to think of your mother and your sister and your
brothers and be a good girl Think of the church ye was raised in and
the name weve got to stand up for in the world Why if ye were doin
anything wrong and the people of Philadelphy got a hold of it the
city big as it is wouldnt be big enough to hold us Your brothers
have got a reputation to make their work to do here You and your
sister want to get married sometime How could ye expect to look the
world in the face and do anythin at all if ye are doin what this
letter says ye are and it was told about ye

The old mans voice was thick with a strange sad alien emotion He did
not want to believe that his daughter was guilty even though he knew
she was He did not want to face what he considered in his vigorous
religious way to be his duty that of reproaching her sternly There
were some fathers who would have turned her out he fancied There were
others who might possibly kill Cowperwood after a subtle investigation
That course was not for him If vengeance he was to have it must be
through politics and financehe must drive him out But as for doing
anything desperate in connection with Aileen he could not think of it

Oh father returned Aileen with considerable histrionic ability in
her assumption of pettishness how can you talk like this when you know
Im not guilty When I tell you so

The old Irishman saw through her makebelieve with profound sadnessthe
feeling that one of his dearest hopes had been shattered He had
expected so much of her socially and matrimonially Why any one of a
dozen remarkable young men might have married her and she would have
had lovely children to comfort him in his old age

Well well not talk any more about it now daughter he said
wearily Yeve been so much to me during all these years that I can
scarcely belave anythin wrong of ye I dont want to God knows Yere
a grown woman though now and if ye are doin anythin wrong I dont
suppose I could do so much to stop ye I might turn ye out of course
as many a father would but I wouldnt like to do anythin like that
But if ye are doin anythin wrongand he put up his hand to stop a
proposed protest on the part of Aileenremember Im certain to find
it out in the long run and Philadelphy wont be big enough to hold
me and the man thats done this thing to me Ill get him he said
getting up dramatically Ill get him and when I do He turned
a livid face to the wall and Aileen saw clearly that Cowperwood in
addition to any other troubles which might beset him had her father
to deal with Was this why Frank had looked so sternly at her the night
before

Why your mother would die of a broken heart if she thought there
was anybody could say the least word against ye pursued Butler in a
shaken voice This man has a familya wife and children Ye oughtnt
to want to do anythin to hurt them Theyll have trouble enough if Im
not mistakenfacin whats comin to them in the future and Butlers
jaw hardened just a little Yere a beautiful girl Yere young Ye
have money Theres dozens of young mend be proud to make ye their
wife Whatever ye may be thinkin or doin dont throw away your life
Dont destroy your immortal soul Dont break my heart entirely

Aileen not ungenerousfool of mingled affection and passioncould now
have cried She pitied her father from her heart but her allegiance
was to Cowperwood her loyalty unshaken She wanted to say something
to protest much more but she knew that it was useless Her father knew
that she was lying

Well theres no use of my saying anything more father she said
getting up The light of day was fading in the windows The downstairs
door closed with a light slam indicating that one of the boys had come
in Her proposed trip to the library was now without interest to her
You wont believe me anyhow I tell you though that Im innocent
just the same

Butler lifted his big brown hand to command silence She saw that this
shameful relationship as far as her father was concerned had been
made quite clear and that this trying conference was now at an end She
turned and walked shamefacedly out He waited until he heard her steps
fading into faint nothings down the hall toward her room Then he arose
Once more he clinched his big fists

The scoundrel he said The scoundrel Ill drive him out of
Philadelphy if it takes the last dollar I have in the world





Chapter XXVII


For the first time in his life Cowperwood felt conscious of having been
in the presence of that interesting social phenomenonthe outraged
sentiment of a parent While he had no absolute knowledge as to why
Butler had been so enraged he felt that Aileen was the contributing
cause He himself was a father His boy Frank Jr was to him not so
remarkable But little Lillian with her dainty little slip of a body
and brightaureoled head had always appealed to him She was going to
be a charming woman one day he thought and he was going to do much
to establish her safely He used to tell her that she had eyes like
buttons feet like a pussycat and hands that were just five cents
worth they were so little The child admired her father and would
often stand by his chair in the library or the sittingroom or his
desk in his private office or by his seat at the table asking him
questions

This attitude toward his own daughter made him see clearly how Butler
might feel toward Aileen He wondered how he would feel if it were his
own little Lillian and still he did not believe he would make much fuss
over the matter either with himself or with her if she were as old as
Aileen Children and their lives were more or less above the willing
of parents anyhow and it would be a difficult thing for any parent
to control any child unless the child were naturally docileminded and
willing to be controlled

It also made him smile in a grim way to see how fate was raining
difficulties on him The Chicago fire Steners early absence Butler
Mollenhauer and Simpsons indifference to Steners fate and his And
now this probable revelation in connection with Aileen He could not
be sure as yet but his intuitive instincts told him that it must be
something like this

Now he was distressed as to what Aileen would do say if suddenly she
were confronted by her father If he could only get to her But if he
was to meet Butlers call for his loan and the others which would come
yet today or on the morrow there was not a moment to lose If he did
not pay he must assign at once Butlers rage Aileen his own danger
were brushed aside for the moment His mind concentrated wholly on how
to save himself financially

He hurried to visit George Waterman David Wiggin his wifes brother
who was now fairly well to do Joseph Zimmerman the wealthy drygoods
dealer who had dealt with him in the past Judge Kitchen a private
manipulator of considerable wealth Frederick Van Nostrand the State
treasurer who was interested in local streetrailway stocks and
others Of all those to whom he appealed one was actually not in
a position to do anything for him another was afraid a third
was calculating eagerly to drive a hard bargain a fourth was too
deliberate anxious to have much time All scented the true value of his
situation all wanted time to consider and he had no time to consider
Judge Kitchen did agree to lend him thirty thousand dollarsa paltry
sum Joseph Zimmerman would only risk twentyfive thousand dollars He
could see where all told he might raise seventyfive thousand dollars
by hypothecating double the amount in shares but this was ridiculously
insufficient He had figured again to a dollar and he must have at
least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars above all his present
holdings or he must close his doors Tomorrow at two oclock he would
know If he didnt he would be written down as failed on a score of
ledgers in Philadelphia

What a pretty pass for one to come to whose hopes had so recently run so
high There was a loan of one hundred thousand dollars from the Girard
National Bank which he was particularly anxious to clear off This bank
was the most important in the city and if he retained its good will
by meeting this loan promptly he might hope for favors in the future
whatever happened Yet at the moment he did not see how he could do
it He decided however after some reflection that he would deliver
the stocks which Judge Kitchen Zimmerman and others had agreed to
take and get their checks or cash yet this night Then he would persuade
Stener to let him have a check for the sixty thousand dollars worth of
city loan he had purchased this morning on change Out of it he could
take twentyfive thousand dollars to make up the balance due the bank
and still have thirtyfive thousand for himself

The one unfortunate thing about such an arrangement was that by doing
it he was building up a rather complicated situation in regard to these
same certificates Since their purchase in the morning he had not
deposited them in the sinkingfund where they belonged they had been
delivered to his office by half past one in the afternoon but on the
contrary had immediately hypothecated them to cover another loan It
was a risky thing to have done considering that he was in danger of
failing and that he was not absolutely sure of being able to take them
up in time

But he reasoned he had a working agreement with the city treasurer
illegal of course which would make such a transaction rather
plausible and almost all right even if he failed and that was that
none of his accounts were supposed necessarily to be put straight until
the end of the month If he failed and the certificates were not in the
sinkingfund he could say as was the truth that he was in the habit
of taking his time and had forgotten This collecting of a check
therefore for these as yet undeposited certificates would be
technically if not legally and morally plausible The city would be
out only an additional sixty thousand dollarsmaking five hundred and
sixty thousand dollars all told which in view of its probable loss of
five hundred thousand did not make so much difference But his caution
clashed with his need on this occasion and he decided that he would not
call for the check unless Stener finally refused to aid him with three
hundred thousand more in which case he would claim it as his right In
all likelihood Stener would not think to ask whether the certificates
were in the sinkingfund or not If he did he would have to liethat
was all

He drove rapidly back to his office and finding Butlers note as
he expected wrote a check on his fathers bank for the one hundred
thousand dollars which had been placed to his credit by his loving
parent and sent it around to Butlers office There was another note
from Albert Stires Steners secretary advising him not to buy or sell
any more city loanthat until further notice such transactions would
not be honored Cowperwood immediately sensed the source of this
warning Stener had been in conference with Butler or Mollenhauer and
had been warned and frightened Nevertheless he got in his buggy again
and drove directly to the city treasurers office

Since Cowperwoods visit Stener had talked still more with Sengstack
Strobik and others all sent to see that a proper fear of things
financial had been put in his heart The result was decidedly one which
spelled opposition to Cowperwood

Strobik was considerably disturbed himself He and Wycroft and Harmon
had also been using money out of the treasurymuch smaller sums of
course for they had not Cowperwoods financial imaginationand were
disturbed as to how they would return what they owed before the storm
broke If Cowperwood failed and Stener was short in his accounts
the whole budget might be investigated and then their loans would be
brought to light The thing to do was to return what they owed and
then at least no charge of malfeasance would lie against them

Go to Mollenhauer Strobik had advised Stener shortly after
Cowperwood had left the latters office and tell him the whole story
He put you here He was strong for your nomination Tell him just where
you stand and ask him what to do Hell probably be able to tell you
Offer him your holdings to help you out You have to You cant help
yourself Dont loan Cowperwood another damned dollar whatever you
do Hes got you in so deep now you can hardly hope to get out Ask
Mollenhauer if he wont help you to get Cowperwood to put that money
back He may be able to influence him

There was more in this conversation to the same effect and then Stener
hurried as fast as his legs could carry him to Mollenhauers office He
was so frightened that he could scarcely breathe and he was quite ready
to throw himself on his knees before the big GermanAmerican financier
and leader Oh if Mr Mollenhauer would only help him If he could just
get out of this without going to jail

Oh Lord Oh Lord Oh Lord he repeated over and over to himself
as he walked What shall I do

The attitude of Henry A Mollenhauer grim political boss that he
wastrained in a hard schoolwas precisely the attitude of every such
man in all such trying circumstances

He was wondering in view of what Butler had told him just how much he
could advantage himself in this situation If he could he wanted to get
control of whatever streetrailway stock Stener now had without in any
way compromising himself Steners shares could easily be transferred on
change through Mollenhauers brokers to a dummy who would eventually
transfer them to himself Mollenhauer Stener must be squeezed
thoroughly though this afternoon and as for his five hundred thousand
dollars indebtedness to the treasury Mollenhauer did not see what
could be done about that If Cowperwood could not pay it the city would
have to lose it but the scandal must be hushed up until after election
Stener unless the various party leaders had more generosity than
Mollenhauer imagined would have to suffer exposure arrest trial
confiscation of his property and possibly sentence to the penitentiary
though this might easily be commuted by the governor once public
excitement died down He did not trouble to think whether Cowperwood was
criminally involved or not A hundred to one he was not Trust a shrewd
man like that to take care of himself But if there was any way to
shoulder the blame on to Cowperwood and so clear the treasurer and the
skirts of the party he would not object to that He wanted to hear the
full story of Steners relations with the broker first Meanwhile the
thing to do was to seize what Stener had to yield

The troubled city treasurer on being shown in Mr Mollenhauers
presence at once sank feebly in a chair and collapsed He was entirely
done for mentally His nerve was gone his courage exhausted like a
breath

Well Mr Stener queried Mr Mollenhauer impressively pretending
not to know what brought him

I came about this matter of my loans to Mr Cowperwood

Well what about them

Well he owes me or the city treasury rather five hundred thousand
dollars and I understand that he is going to fail and that he cant pay
it back

Who told you that

Mr Sengstack and since then Mr Cowperwood has been to see me He
tells me he must have more money or he will fail and he wants to borrow
three hundred thousand dollars more He says he must have it

So said Mr Mollenhauer impressively and with an air of
astonishment which he did not feel You would not think of doing that
of course Youre too badly involved as it is If he wants to know why
refer him to me Dont advance him another dollar If you do and this
case comes to trial no court would have any mercy on you Its going
to be difficult enough to do anything for you as it is However if you
dont advance him any morewe will see It may be possible I cant
say but at any rate no more money must leave the treasury to bolster
up this bad business Its much too difficult as it now is He stared
at Stener warningly And he shaken and sick yet because of the faint
suggestion of mercy involved somewhere in Mollenhauers remarks now
slipped from his chair to his knees and folded his hands in the uplifted
attitude of a devotee before a sacred image

Oh Mr Mollenhauer he choked beginning to cry I didnt mean to do
anything wrong Strobik and Wycroft told me it was all right You sent
me to Cowperwood in the first place I only did what I thought the
others had been doing Mr Bode did it just like I have been doing
He dealt with Tighe and Company I have a wife and four children Mr
Mollenhauer My youngest boy is only seven years old Think of them Mr
Mollenhauer Think of what my arrest will mean to them I dont want to
go to jail I didnt think I was doing anything very wronghonestly I
didnt Ill give up all Ive got You can have all my stocks and houses
and lotsanythingif youll only get me out of this You wont let em
send me to jail will you

His fat white lips were tremblingwabbling nervouslyand big hot
tears were coursing down his previously pale but now flushed cheeks
He presented one of those almost unbelievable pictures which are yet so
intensely human and so true If only the great financial and political
giants would for once accurately reveal the details of their lives

Mollenhauer looked at him calmly meditatively How often had he seen
weaklings no more dishonest than himself but without his courage and
subtlety pleading to him in this fashion not on their knees exactly
but intellectually so Life to him as to every other man of large
practical knowledge and insight was an inexplicable tangle What were
you going to do about the socalled morals and precepts of the world
This man Stener fancied that he was dishonest and that he Mollenhauer
was honest He was here selfconvicted of sin pleading to him
Mollenhauer as he would to a righteous unstained saint As a matter
of fact Mollenhauer knew that he was simply shrewder more farseeing
more calculating not less dishonest Stener was lacking in force and
brainsnot morals This lack was his principal crime There were people
who believed in some esoteric standard of rightsome ideal of conduct
absolutely and very far removed from practical life but he had never
seen them practice it save to their own financial not moralhe would
not say that destruction They were never significant practical men
who clung to these fatuous ideals They were always poor nondescript
negligible dreamers He could not have made Stener understand all this
if he had wanted to and he certainly did not want to It was too bad
about Mrs Stener and the little Steners No doubt she had worked hard
as had Stener to get up in the world and be somethingjust a little
more than miserably poor and now this unfortunate complication had to
arise to undo themthis Chicago fire What a curious thing that was
If any one thing more than another made him doubt the existence of a
kindly overruling Providence it was the unheralded storms out of clear
skiesfinancial social anything you choosethat so often brought
ruin and disaster to so many

Get Up Stener he said calmly after a few moments You mustnt
give way to your feelings like this You must not cry These troubles
are never unraveled by tears You must do a little thinking for
yourself Perhaps your situation isnt so bad

As he was saying this Stener was putting himself back in his chair
getting out his handkerchief and sobbing hopelessly in it

Ill do what I can Stener I wont promise anything I cant tell you
what the result will be There are many peculiar political forces in
this city I may not be able to save you but I am perfectly willing to
try You must put yourself absolutely under my direction You must not
say or do anything without first consulting with me I will send my
secretary to you from time to time He will tell you what to do You
must not come to me unless I send for you Do you understand that
thoroughly

Yes Mr Mollenhauer

Well now dry your eyes I dont want you to go out of this office
crying Go back to your office and I will send Sengstack to see you
He will tell you what to do Follow him exactly And whenever I send for
you come at once

He got up large selfconfident reserved Stener buoyed up by the
subtle reassurance of his remarks recovered to a degree his equanimity
Mr Mollenhauer the great powerful Mr Mollenhauer was going to help
him out of his scrape He might not have to go to jail after all
He left after a few moments his face a little red from weeping but
otherwise free of telltale marks and returned to his office

Threequarters of an hour later Sengstack called on him for the second
time that dayAbner Sengstack small darkfaced clubfooted a great
sole of leather three inches thick under his short withered right leg
his slightly Slavic highly intelligent countenance burning with a pair
of keen piercing inscrutable black eyes Sengstack was a fit secretary
for Mollenhauer You could see at one glance that he would make Stener
do exactly what Mollenhauer suggested His business was to induce Stener
to part with his streetrailway holdings at once through Tighe  Co
Butlers brokers to the political subagent who would eventually
transfer them to Mollenhauer What little Stener received for them
might well go into the treasury Tighe  Co would manage the change
subtleties of this without giving any one else a chance to bid while at
the same time making it appear an openmarket transaction At the same
time Sengstack went carefully into the state of the treasurers office
for his masters benefitfinding out what it was that Strobik Wycroft
and Harmon had been doing with their loans Via another source they were
ordered to disgorge at once or face prosecution They were a part of
Mollenhauers political machine Then having cautioned Stener not to
set over the remainder of his property to any one and not to listen
to any one most of all to the Machiavellian counsel of Cowperwood
Sengstack left

Needless to say Mollenhauer was greatly gratified by this turn of
affairs Cowperwood was now most likely in a position where he would
have to come and see him or if not a good share of the properties he
controlled were already in Mollenhauers possession If by some hook or
crook he could secure the remainder Simpson and Butler might well talk
to him about this streetrailway business His holdings were now as
large as any if not quite the largest





Chapter XXVIII


It was in the face of this very altered situation that Cowperwood
arrived at Steners office late this Monday afternoon

Stener was quite alone worried and distraught He was anxious to see
Cowperwood and at the same time afraid

George began Cowperwood briskly on seeing him I havent much time
to spare now but Ive come finally to tell you that youll have to
let me have three hundred thousand more if you dont want me to fail
Things are looking very bad today Theyve caught me in a corner on
my loans but this storm isnt going to last You can see by the very
character of it that it cant

He was looking at Steners face and seeing fear and a pained and
yet very definite necessity for opposition written there Chicago is
burning but it will be built up again Business will be all the better
for it later on Now I want you to be reasonable and help me Dont get
frightened

Stener stirred uneasily Dont let these politicians scare you to
death It will all blow over in a few days and then well be better off
than ever Did you see Mollenhauer

Yes

Well what did he have to say

He said just what I thought hed say He wont let me do this I cant
Frank I tell you exclaimed Stener jumping up He was so nervous
that he had had a hard time keeping his seat during this short direct
conversation I cant Theyve got me in a corner Theyre after me
They all know what weve been doing Oh say Frankhe threw up his
arms wildlyyouve got to get me out of this Youve got to let me
have that five hundred thousand back and get me out of this If you
dont and you should fail theyll send me to the penitentiary Ive
got a wife and four children Frank I cant go on in this Its too big
for me I never should have gone in on it in the first place I never
would have if you hadnt persuaded me in a way I never thought when I
began that I would ever get in as bad as all this I cant go on Frank
I cant Im willing you should have all my stock Only give me back
that five hundred thousand and well call it even His voice rose
nervously as he talked and he wiped his wet forehead with his hand and
stared at Cowperwood pleadingly foolishly

Cowperwood stared at him in return for a few moments with a cold fishy
eye He knew a great deal about human nature and he was ready for and
expectant of any queer shift in an individuals attitude particularly
in time of panic but this shift of Steners was quite too much Whom
else have you been talking to George since I saw you Whom have you
seen What did Sengstack have to say

He says just what Mollenhauer does that I mustnt loan any more money
under any circumstances and he says I ought to get that five hundred
thousand back as quickly as possible

And you think Mollenhauer wants to help you do you inquired
Cowperwood finding it hard to efface the contempt which kept forcing
itself into his voice

I think he does yes I dont know who else will Frank if he dont
Hes one of the big political forces in this town

Listen to me began Cowperwood eyeing him fixedly Then he paused
What did he say you should do about your holdings

Sell them through Tighe  Company and put the money back in the
treasury if you wont take them

Sell them to whom asked Cowperwood thinking of Steners last words

To any one on change wholl take them I suppose I dont know

I thought so said Cowperwood comprehendingly I might have known
as much Theyre working you George Theyre simply trying to get your
stocks away from you Mollenhauer is leading you on He knows I cant do
what you wantgive you back the five hundred thousand dollars He wants
you to throw your stocks on the market so that he can pick them up
Depend on it thats all arranged for already When you do hes got me
in his clutches or he thinks he hashe and Butler and Simpson They
want to get together on this local streetrailway situation and I know
it I feel it Ive felt it coming all along Mollenhauer hasnt any
more intention of helping you than he has of flying Once youve sold
your stocks hes through with youmark my word Do you think hell
turn a hand to keep you out of the penitentiary once youre out of this
streetrailway situation He will not And if you think so youre a
bigger fool than I take you to be George Dont go crazy Dont lose
your head Be sensible Look the situation in the face Let me explain
it to you If you dont help me nowif you dont let me have three
hundred thousand dollars by tomorrow noon at the very latest Im
through and so are you There is not a thing the matter with our
situation Those stocks of ours are as good today as they ever were
Why great heavens man the railways are there behind them Theyre
paying The Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line is earning one
thousand dollars a day right now What better evidence do you want than
that Green  Coates is earning five hundred dollars Youre frightened
George These damned political schemers have scared you Why youve as
good a right to loan that money as Bode and Murtagh had before you They
did it Youve been doing it for Mollenhauer and the others only so
long as you do it for them its all right Whats a designated city
depository but a loan

Cowperwood was referring to the system under which certain portions of
city money like the sinkingfund were permitted to be kept in certain
banks at a low rate of interest or no ratebanks in which Mollenhauer
and Butler and Simpson were interested This was their safe graft

Dont throw your chances away George Dont quit now Youll be worth
millions in a few years and you wont have to turn a hand All you will
have to do will be to keep what you have If you dont help me mark my
word theyll throw you over the moment Im out of this and theyll let
you go to the penitentiary Whos going to put up five hundred thousand
dollars for you George Where is Mollenhauer going to get it or
Butler or anybody in these times They cant They dont intend to
When Im through youre through and youll be exposed quicker than any
one else They cant hurt me George Im an agent I didnt ask you to
come to me You came to me in the first place of your own accord If you
dont help me youre through I tell you and youre going to be sent
to the penitentiary as sure as there are jails Why dont you take a
stand George Why dont you stand your ground You have your wife and
children to look after You cant be any worse off loaning me three
hundred thousand more than you are right now What difference does it
makefive hundred thousand or eight hundred thousand Its all one and
the same thing if youre going to be tried for it Besides if you loan
me this there isnt going to be any trial Im not going to fail This
storm will blow over in a week or ten days and well be rich again
For Heavens sake George dont go to pieces this way Be sensible Be
reasonable

He paused for Steners face had become a jellylike mass of woe

I cant Frank he wailed I tell you I cant Theyll punish me
worse than ever if I do that Theyll never let up on me You dont know
these people

In Steners crumpling weakness Cowperwood read his own fate What could
you do with a man like that How brace him up You couldnt And with a
gesture of infinite understanding disgust noble indifference he threw
up his hands and started to walk out At the door he turned

George he said Im sorry Im sorry for you not for myself Ill
come out of things all right eventually Ill be rich But George
youre making the one great mistake of your life Youll be poor youll
be a convict and youll have only yourself to blame There isnt a
thing the matter with this money situation except the fire There isnt
a thing wrong with my affairs except this slump in stocksthis panic
You sit there a fortune in your hands and you allow a lot of schemers
highbinders who dont know any more of your affairs or mine than a
rabbit and who havent any interest in you except to plan what they can
get out of you to frighten you and prevent you from doing the one thing
that will save your life Three hundred thousand paltry dollars that in
three or four weeks from now I can pay back to you four and five
times over and for that you will see me go broke and yourself to the
penitentiary I cant understand it George Youre out of your mind
Youre going to rue this the longest day that you live

He waited a few moments to see if this by any twist of chance would
have any effect then noting that Stener still remained a wilted
helpless mass of nothing he shook his head gloomily and walked out

It was the first time in his life that Cowperwood had ever shown the
least sign of weakening or despair He had felt all along as though
there were nothing to the Greek theory of being pursued by the furies
Now however there seemed an untoward fate which was pursuing him
It looked that way Still fate or no fate he did not propose to be
daunted Even in this very beginning of a tendency to feel despondent he
threw back his head expanded his chest and walked as briskly as ever


In the large room outside Steners private office he encountered Albert
Stires Steners chief clerk and secretary He and Albert had exchanged
many friendly greetings in times past and all the little minor
transactions in regard to city loan had been discussed between them for
Albert knew more of the intricacies of finance and financial bookkeeping
than Stener would ever know

At the sight of Stires the thought in regard to the sixty thousand
dollars worth of city loan certificates previously referred to
flashed suddenly through his mind He had not deposited them in the
sinkingfund and did not intend to for the presentcould not unless
considerable free money were to reach him shortlyfor he had used them
to satisfy other pressing demands and had no free money to buy them
backor in other words release them And he did not want to just at
this moment Under the law governing transactions of this kind with the
city treasurer he was supposed to deposit them at once to the credit of
the city and not to draw his pay therefor from the city treasurer until
he had To be very exact the city treasurer under the law was not
supposed to pay him for any transaction of this kind until he or his
agents presented a voucher from the bank or other organization carrying
the sinkingfund for the city showing that the certificates so purchased
had actually been deposited there As a matter of fact under the custom
which had grown up between him and Stener the law had long been
ignored in this respect He could buy certificates of city loan for
the sinkingfund up to any reasonable amount hypothecate them where he
pleased and draw his pay from the city without presenting a voucher At
the end of the month sufficient certificates of city loan could usually
be gathered from one source and another to make up the deficiency or
the deficiency could actually be ignored as had been done on more than
one occasion for long periods of time while he used money secured by
hypothecating the shares for speculative purposes This was actually
illegal but neither Cowperwood nor Stener saw it in that light or
cared

The trouble with this particular transaction was the note that he had
received from Stener ordering him to stop both buying and selling which
put his relations with the city treasury on a very formal basis He
had bought these certificates before receiving this note but had not
deposited them He was going now to collect his check but perhaps the
old easy system of balancing matters at the end of the month might not
be said to obtain any longer Stires might ask him to present a voucher
of deposit If so he could not now get this check for sixty thousand
dollars for he did not have the certificates to deposit If not he
might get the money but also it might constitute the basis of
some subsequent legal action If he did not eventually deposit the
certificates before failure some charge such as that of larceny might
be brought against him Still he said to himself he might not really
fail even yet If any of his banking associates should for any reason
modify their decision in regard to calling his loans he would not
Would Stener make a row about this if he so secured this check Would
the city officials pay any attention to him if he did Could you get any
district attorney to take cognizance of such a transaction if Stener
did complain No not in all likelihood and anyhow nothing would
come of it No jury would punish him in the face of the understanding
existing between him and Stener as agent or broker and principal And
once he had the money it was a hundred to one Stener would think no
more about it It would go in among the various unsatisfied liabilities
and nothing more would be thought about it Like lightning the entire
situation hashed through his mind He would risk it He stopped before
the chief clerks desk

Albert he said in a low voice I bought sixty thousand dollars
worth of city loan for the sinkingfund this morning Will you give my
boy a check for it in the morning or better yet will you give it to
me now I got your note about no more purchases Im going back to
the office You can just credit the sinkingfund with eight hundred
certificates at from seventyfive to eighty Ill send you the itemized
list later

Certainly Mr Cowperwood certainly replied Albert with alacrity
Stocks are getting an awful knock arent they I hope youre not very
much troubled by it

Not very Albert replied Cowperwood smiling the while the chief
clerk was making out his check He was wondering if by any chance
Stener would appear and attempt to interfere with this It was a legal
transaction He had a right to the check provided he deposited the
certificates as was his custom with the trustee of the fund He waited
tensely while Albert wrote and finally with the check actually in
his hand breathed a sigh of relief Here at least was sixty thousand
dollars and tonights work would enable him to cash the seventyfive
thousand that had been promised him Tomorrow once more he must see
Leigh Kitchen Jay Cooke  Co Edward Clark  Coall the long list
of people to whom he owed loans and find out what could be done If he
could only get time If he could get just a week





Chapter XXIX


But time was not a thing to be had in this emergency With the
seventyfive thousand dollars his friends had extended to him and sixty
thousand dollars secured from Stires Cowperwood met the Girard call and
placed the balance thirtyfive thousand dollars in a private safe in
his own home He then made a final appeal to the bankers and financiers
but they refused to help him He did not however commiserate himself
in this hour He looked out of his office window into the little court
and sighed What more could he do He sent a note to his father asking
him to call for lunch He sent a note to his lawyer Harper Steger a
man of his own age whom he liked very much and asked him to call
also He evolved in his own mind various plans of delay addresses to
creditors and the like but alas he was going to fail And the worst
of it was that this matter of the city treasurers loans was bound to
become a public and more than a public a political scandal And the
charge of conniving if not illegally at least morally at the misuse
of the citys money was the one thing that would hurt him most

How industriously his rivals would advertise this fact He might get
on his feet again if he failed but it would be uphill work And his
father His father would be pulled down with him It was probable
that he would be forced out of the presidency of his bank With these
thoughts Cowperwood sat there waiting As he did so Aileen Butler was
announced by his officeboy and at the same time Albert Stires

Show in Miss Butler he said getting up Tell Mr Stires to wait
Aileen came briskly vigorously in her beautiful body clothed as
decoratively as ever The street suit that she wore was of a light
goldenbrown broadcloth faceted with small darkred buttons Her head
was decorated with a brownishred shake of a type she had learned was
becoming to her brimless and with a trailing plume and her throat was
graced by a threestrand necklace of gold beads Her hands were smoothly
gloved as usual and her little feet daintily shod There was a look
of girlish distress in her eyes which however she was trying hard to
conceal

Honey she exclaimed on seeing him her arms extendedwhat is the
trouble I wanted so much to ask you the other night Youre not going
to fail are you I heard father and Owen talking about you last night

What did they say he inquired putting his arm around her and looking
quietly into her nervous eyes

Oh you know I think papa is very angry with you He suspects Some
one sent him an anonymous letter He tried to get it out of me last
night but he didnt succeed I denied everything I was in here twice
this morning to see you but you were out I was so afraid that he might
see you first and that you might say something

Me Aileen

Well no not exactly I didnt think that I dont know what I
thought Oh honey Ive been so worried You know I didnt sleep at
all I thought I was stronger than that but I was so worried about you
You know he put me in a strong light by his desk where he could see my
face and then he showed me the letter I was so astonished for a moment
I hardly know what I said or how I looked

What did you say

Why I said What a shame It isnt so But I didnt say it right
away My heart was going like a triphammer Im afraid he must have
been able to tell something from my face I could hardly get my breath

Hes a shrewd man your father he commented He knows something
about life Now you see how difficult these situations are Its a
blessing he decided to show you the letter instead of watching the
house I suppose he felt too bad to do that He cant prove anything
now But he knows You cant deceive him

How do you know he knows

I saw him yesterday

Did he talk to you about it

No I saw his face He simply looked at me

Honey Im so sorry for him

I know you are So am I But it cant be helped now We should have
thought of that in the first place

But I love you so Oh honey he will never forgive me He loves me so
He mustnt know I wont admit anything But oh dear

She put her hands tightly together on his bosom and he looked
consolingly into her eyes Her eyelids were trembling and her lips
She was sorry for her father herself Cowperwood Through her he could
sense the force of Butlers parental affection the volume and danger of
his rage There were so many many things as he saw it now converging to
make a dramatic denouement

Never mind he replied it cant be helped now Where is my strong
determined Aileen I thought you were going to be so brave Arent you
going to be I need to have you that way now

Do you

Yes

Are you in trouble

I think I am going to fail dear

Oh no

Yes honey Im at the end of my rope I dont see any way out just at
present Ive sent for my father and my lawyer You mustnt stay
here sweet Your father may come in here at any time We must meet
somewheretomorrow saytomorrow afternoon You remember Indian
Rock out on the Wissahickon

Yes

Could you be there at four

Yes

Look out for whos following If Im not there by fourthirty dont
wait You know why It will be because I think some one is watching
There wont be though if we work it right And now you must run
sweet We cant use Ninethirtyone any more Ill have to rent another
place somewhere else

Oh honey Im so sorry

Arent you going to be strong and brave You see I need you to be

He was almost for the first time a little sad in his mood

Yes dear yes she declared slipping her arms under his and pulling
him tight Oh yes You can depend on me Oh Frank I love you so
Im so sorry Oh I do hope you dont fail But it doesnt make any
difference dear between you and me whatever happens does it We will
love each other just the same Ill do anything for you honey Ill do
anything you say You can trust me They shant know anything from me

She looked at his still pale face and a sudden strong determination
to fight for him welled up in her heart Her love was unjust illegal
outlawed but it was love just the same and had much of the fiery
daring of the outcast from justice

I love you I love you I love you Frank she declared He unloosed
her hands

Run sweet Tomorrow at four Dont fail And dont talk And dont
admit anything whatever you do

I wont

And dont worry about me Ill be all right

He barely had time to straighten his tie to assume a nonchalant
attitude by the window when in hurried Steners chief clerkpale
disturbed obviously out of key with himself

Mr Cowperwood You know that check I gave you last night Mr Stener
says its illegal that I shouldnt have given it to you that he will
hold me responsible He says I can be arrested for compounding a felony
and that he will discharge me and have me sent to prison if I dont
get it back Oh Mr Cowperwood I am only a young man Im just really
starting out in life Ive got my wife and little boy to look after You
wont let him do that to me Youll give me that check back wont you
I cant go back to the office without it He says youre going to fail
and that you knew it and that you havent any right to it

Cowperwood looked at him curiously He was surprised at the variety and
character of these emissaries of disaster Surely when troubles chose
to multiply they had great skill in presenting themselves in rapid
order Stener had no right to make any such statement The transaction
was not illegal The man had gone wild True he Cowperwood had
received an order after these securities were bought not to buy or sell
any more city loan but that did not invalidate previous purchases
Stener was browbeating and frightening his poor underling a better man
than himself in order to get back this sixtythousanddollar check
What a petty creature he was How true it was as somebody had remarked
that you could not possibly measure the petty meannesses to which a fool
could stoop

You go back to Mr Stener Albert and tell him that it cant be done
The certificates of loan were purchased before his order arrived and
the records of the exchange will prove it There is no illegality here
I am entitled to that check and could have collected it in any qualified
court of law The man has gone out of his head I havent failed yet
You are not in any danger of any legal proceedings and if you are Ill
help defend you I cant give you the check back because I havent it to
give and if I had I wouldnt That would be allowing a fool to make a
fool of me Im sorry very but I cant do anything for you

Oh Mr Cowperwood Tears were in Stiress eyes Hell discharge me
Hell forfeit my sureties Ill be turned out into the street I have
only a little property of my ownoutside of my salary

He wrung his hands and Cowperwood shook his head sadly

This isnt as bad as you think Albert He wont do what he says He
cant Its unfair and illegal You can bring suit and recover your
salary Ill help you in that as much as Im able But I cant give you
back this sixtythousanddollar check because I havent it to give
I couldnt if I wanted to It isnt here any more Ive paid for the
securities I bought with it The securities are not here Theyre in the
sinkingfund or will be

He paused wishing he had not mentioned that fact It was a slip of the
tongue one of the few he ever made due to the peculiar pressure of the
situation Stires pleaded longer It was no use Cowperwood told him
Finally he went away crestfallen fearsome broken There were tears
of suffering in his eyes Cowperwood was very sorry And then his father
was announced

The elder Cowperwood brought a haggard face He and Frank had had a long
conversation the evening before lasting until early morning but it had
not been productive of much save uncertainty

Hello father exclaimed Cowperwood cheerfully noting his fathers
gloom He was satisfied that there was scarcely a coal of hope to be
raked out of these ashes of despair but there was no use admitting it

Well said his father lifting his sad eyes in a peculiar way

Well it looks like stormy weather doesnt it Ive decided to call a
meeting of my creditors father and ask for time There isnt anything
else to do I cant realize enough on anything to make it worth while
talking about I thought Stener might change his mind but hes worse
rather than better His head bookkeeper just went out of here

What did he want asked Henry Cowperwood

He wanted me to give him back a check for sixty thousand that he paid
me for some city loan I bought yesterday morning Frank did not explain
to his father however that he had hypothecated the certificates this
check had paid for and used the check itself to raise money enough to
pay the Girard National Bank and to give himself thirtyfive thousand in
cash besides

Well I declare replied the old man Youd think hed have better
sense than that Thats a perfectly legitimate transaction When did you
say he notified you not to buy city loan

Yesterday noon

Hes out of his mind Cowperwood Sr commented laconically

Its Mollenhauer and Simpson and Butler I know They want my
streetrailway lines Well they wont get them Theyll get them
through a receivership and after the panics all over Our creditors
will have first chance at these If they buy theyll buy from them If
it werent for that fivehundredthousanddollar loan I wouldnt think a
thing of this My creditors would sustain me nicely But the moment that
gets noised around And this election I hypothecated those city loan
certificates because I didnt want to get on the wrong side of Davison
I expected to take in enough by now to take them up They ought to be in
the sinkingfund really

The old gentleman saw the point at once and winced

They might cause you trouble there Frank

Its a technical question replied his son I might have been
intending to take them up As a matter of fact I will if I can before
three Ive been taking eight and ten days to deposit them in the past
In a storm like this Im entitled to move my pawns as best I can

Cowperwood the father put his hand over his mouth again He felt very
disturbed about this He saw no way out however He was at the end
of his own resources He felt the sidewhiskers on his left cheek He
looked out of the window into the little green court Possibly it was a
technical question who should say The financial relations of the city
treasury with other brokers before Frank had been very lax Every banker
knew that Perhaps precedent would or should govern in this case He
could not say Still it was dangerousnot straight If Frank could get
them out and deposit them it would be so much better

Id take them up if I were you and I could he added

I will if I can

How much money have you

Oh twenty thousand all told If I suspend though Ill have to have
a little ready cash

I have eight or ten thousand or will have by night I hope

He was thinking of some one who would give him a second mortgage on his
house

Cowperwood looked quietly at him There was nothing more to be said to
his father Im going to make one more appeal to Stener after you leave
here he said Im going over there with Harper Steger when he comes
If he wont change Ill send out notice to my creditors and notify
the secretary of the exchange I want you to keep a stiff upper lip
whatever happens I know you will though Im going into the thing head
down If Stener had any sense He paused But whats the use talking
about a damn fool

He turned to the window thinking of how easy it would have been if
Aileen and he had not been exposed by this anonymous note to have
arranged all with Butler Rather than injure the party Butler in
extremis would have assisted him Now

His father got up to go He was as stiff with despair as though he were
suffering from cold

Well he said wearily

Cowperwood suffered intensely for him What a shame His father He felt
a great surge of sorrow sweep over him but a moment later mastered it
and settled to his quick defiant thinking As the old man went out
Harper Steger was brought in They shook hands and at once started
for Steners office But Stener had sunk in on himself like an empty
gasbag and no efforts were sufficient to inflate him They went out
finally defeated

I tell you Frank said Steger I wouldnt worry We can tie this
thing up legally until election and after and that will give all this
row a chance to die down Then you can get your people together and talk
sense to them Theyre not going to give up good properties like this
even if Stener does go to jail

Steger did not know of the sixty thousand dollars worth of hypothecated
securities as yet Neither did he know of Aileen Butler and her fathers
boundless rage





Chapter XXX


There was one development in connection with all of this of which
Cowperwood was as yet unaware The same day that brought Edward Butler
the anonymous communication in regard to his daughter brought almost a
duplicate of it to Mrs Frank Algernon Cowperwood only in this case the
name of Aileen Butler had curiously been omitted

Perhaps you dont know that your husband is running with another woman
If you dont believe it watch the house at 931 North Tenth Street

Mrs Cowperwood was in the conservatory watering some plants when this
letter was brought by her maid Monday morning She was most placid in
her thoughts for she did not know what all the conferring of the night
before meant Frank was occasionally troubled by financial storms but
they did not see to harm him

Lay it on the table in the library Annie Ill get it

She thought it was some social note

In a little while such was her deliberate way she put down her
sprinklingpot and went into the library There it was lying on the
green leather sheepskin which constituted a part of the ornamentation
of the large library table She picked it up glanced at it curiously
because it was on cheap paper and then opened it Her face paled
slightly as she read it and then her hand tremblednot much Hers
was not a soul that ever loved passionately hence she could not suffer
passionately She was hurt disgusted enraged for the moment and
frightened but she was not broken in spirit entirely Thirteen years
of life with Frank Cowperwood had taught her a number of things He was
selfish she knew now selfcentered and not as much charmed by her as
he had been The fear she had originally felt as to the effect of her
preponderance of years had been to some extent justified by the lapse
of time Frank did not love her as he hadhe had not for some time she
had felt it What was itshe had asked herself at timesalmost who
was it Business was engrossing him so

Finance was his master Did this mean the end of her regime she
queried Would he cast her off Where would she go What would she do
She was not helpless of course for she had money of her own which
he was manipulating for her Who was this other woman Was she young
beautiful of any social position Was it Suddenly she stopped Was
it Could it be by any chanceher mouth openedAileen Butler

She stood still staring at this letter for she could scarcely
countenance her own thought She had observed often in spite of all
their caution how friendly Aileen had been to him and he to her He
liked her he never lost a chance to defend her Lillian had thought of
them at times as being curiously suited to each other temperamentally
He liked young people But of course he was married and Aileen was
infinitely beneath him socially and he had two children and herself
And his social and financial position was so fixed and stable that he
did not dare trifle with it Still she paused for forty years and two
children and some slight wrinkles and the suspicion that we may be no
longer loved as we once were is apt to make any woman pause even in
the face of the most significant financial position Where would she go
if she left him What would people think What about the children
Could she prove this liaison Could she entrap him in a compromising
situation Did she want to

She saw now that she did not love him as some women love their husbands
She was not wild about him In a way she had been taking him for
granted all these years had thought that he loved her enough not to be
unfaithful to her at least fancied that he was so engrossed with the
more serious things of life that no petty liaison such as this letter
indicated would trouble him or interrupt his great career Apparently
this was not true What should she do What say How act Her none too
brilliant mind was not of much service in this crisis She did not know
very well how either to plan or to fight

The conventional mind is at best a petty piece of machinery It is
oysterlike in its functioning or perhaps better clamlike It has
its little siphon of thoughtprocesses forced up or down into the mighty
ocean of fact and circumstance but it uses so little pumps so faintly
that the immediate contiguity of the vast mass is not disturbed Nothing
of the subtlety of life is perceived No least inkling of its storms
or terrors is ever discovered except through accident When some crude
suggestive fact such as this letter proved to be suddenly manifests
itself in the placid flow of events there is great agony or disturbance
and clogging of the socalled normal processes The siphon does not
work right It sucks in fear and distress There is great grinding of
maladjusted partsnot unlike sand in a machineand life as is so
often the case ceases or goes lamely ever after

Mrs Cowperwood was possessed of a conventional mind She really knew
nothing about life And life could not teach her Reaction in her from
salty thoughtprocesses was not possible She was not alive in the
sense that Aileen Butler was and yet she thought that she was very
much alive All illusion She wasnt She was charming if you loved
placidity If you did not she was not She was not engaging brilliant
or forceful Frank Cowperwood might well have asked himself in the
beginning why he married her He did not do so now because he did
not believe it was wise to question the past as to ones failures and
errors It was according to him most unwise to regret He kept his
face and thoughts to the future

But Mrs Cowperwood was truly distressed in her way and she went about
the house thinking feeling wretchedly She decided since the letter
asked her to see for herself to wait She must think how she would
watch this house if at all Frank must not know If it were Aileen
Butler by any chancebut surely notshe thought she would expose her
to her parents Still that meant exposing herself She determined to
conceal her mood as best she could at dinnertimebut Cowperwood was
not able to be there He was so rushed so closeted with individuals so
closely in conference with his father and others that she scarcely saw
him this Monday night nor the next day nor for many days

For on Tuesday afternoon at twothirty he issued a call for a meeting of
his creditors and at fivethirty he decided to go into the hands of a
receiver And yet as he stood before his principal creditorsa group
of thirty menin his office he did not feel that his life was ruined
He was temporarily embarrassed Certainly things looked very black The
citytreasurership deal would make a great fuss Those hypothecated city
loan certificates to the extent of sixty thousand would make another
if Stener chose Still he did not feel that he was utterly destroyed

Gentlemen he said in closing his address of explanation at the
meeting quite as erect secure defiant convincing as he had ever
been you see how things are These securities are worth just as much
as they ever were There is nothing the matter with the properties
behind them If you will give me fifteen days or twenty I am satisfied
that I can straighten the whole matter out I am almost the only one who
can for I know all about it The market is bound to recover Business
is going to be better than ever Its time I want Time is the only
significant factor in this situation I want to know if you wont give
me fifteen or twenty daysa month if you can That is all I want

He stepped aside and out of the general room where the blinds were
drawn into his private office in order to give his creditors an
opportunity to confer privately in regard to his situation He had
friends in the meeting who were for him He waited one two nearly
three hours while they talked Finally Walter Leigh Judge Kitchen
Avery Stone of Jay Cooke  Co and several others came in They were a
committee appointed to gather further information

Nothing more can be done today Frank Walter Leigh informed him
quietly The majority want the privilege of examining the books There
is some uncertainty about this entanglement with the city treasurer
which you say exists They feel that youd better announce a temporary
suspension anyhow and if they want to let you resume later they can do
so

Im sorry for that gentlemen replied Cowperwood the least bit
depressed I would rather do anything than suspend for one hour if I
could help it for I know just what it means You will find assets
here far exceeding the liabilities if you will take the stocks at their
normal market value but that wont help any if I close my doors The
public wont believe in me I ought to keep open

Sorry Frank old boy observed Leigh pressing his hand
affectionately If it were left to me personally you could have all
the time you want Theres a crowd of old fogies out there that wont
listen to reason Theyre panicstruck I guess theyre pretty hard
hit themselves You can scarcely blame them Youll come out all right
though I wish you didnt have to shut up shop We cant do anything with
them however Why damn it man I dont see how you can fail really
In ten days these stocks will be all right

Judge Kitchen commiserated with him also but what good did that do He
was being compelled to suspend An expert accountant would have to
come in and go over his books Butler might spread the news of this
citytreasury connection Stener might complain of this last cityloan
transaction A halfdozen of his helpful friends stayed with him until
four oclock in the morning but he had to suspend just the same And
when he did that he knew he was seriously crippled if not ultimately
defeated in his race for wealth and fame

When he was really and finally quite alone in his private bedroom
he stared at himself in the mirror His face was pale and tired he
thought but strong and effective Pshaw he said to himself Im
not whipped Im still young Ill get out of this in some way yet
Certainly I will Ill find some way out

And so cogitating heavily wearily he began to undress Finally he
sank upon his bed and in a little while strange as it may seem with
all the tangle of trouble around him slept He could do thatsleep
and gurgle most peacefully the while his father paced the floor in his
room refusing to be comforted All was dark before the older manthe
future hopeless Before the younger man was still hope

And in her room Lillian Cowperwood turned and tossed in the face of this
new calamity For it had suddenly appeared from news from her father and
Frank and Anna and her motherinlaw that Frank was about to fail or
would or hadit was almost impossible to say just how it was Frank
was too busy to explain The Chicago fire was to blame There was no
mention as yet of the city treasurership Frank was caught in a trap
and was fighting for his life

In this crisis for the moment she forgot about the note as to his
infidelity or rather ignored it She was astonished frightened
dumbfounded confused Her little placid beautiful world was going
around in a dizzy ring The charming ornate ship of their fortune was
being blown most ruthlessly here and there She felt it a sort of duty
to stay in bed and try to sleep but her eyes were quite wide and her
brain hurt her Hours before Frank had insisted that she should not
bother about him that she could do nothing and she had left him
wondering more than ever what and where was the line of her duty To
stick by her husband convention told her and so she decided Yes
religion dictated that also custom There were the children They must
not be injured Frank must be reclaimed if possible He would get over
this But what a blow





Chapter XXXI


The suspension of the banking house of Frank A Cowperwood  Co
created a great stir on change and in Philadelphia generally It was so
unexpected and the amount involved was comparatively so large Actually
he failed for one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
and his assets under the depressed condition of stock values barely
totaled seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars There had been
considerable work done on the matter of his balancesheet before it
was finally given to the public but when it was stocks dropped an
additional three points generally and the papers the next day devoted
notable headlines to it Cowperwood had no idea of failing permanently
he merely wished to suspend temporarily and later if possible to
persuade his creditors to allow him to resume There were only two
things which stood in the way of this the matter of the five hundred
thousand dollars borrowed from the city treasury at a ridiculously low
rate of interest which showed plainer than words what had been going
on and the other the matter of the sixtythousanddollar check His
financial wit had told him there were ways to assign his holdings in
favor of his largest creditors which would tend to help him later to
resume and he had been swift to act Indeed Harper Steger had drawn up
documents which named Jay Cooke  Co Edward Clark  Co Drexel  Co
and others as preferred He knew that even though dissatisfied holders
of smaller shares in his company brought suit and compelled readjustment
or bankruptcy later the intention shown to prefer some of his most
influential aids was important They would like it and might help him
later when all this was over Besides suits in plenty are an excellent
way of tiding over a crisis of this kind until stocks and common sense
are restored and he was for many suits Harper Steger smiled once
rather grimly even in the whirl of the financial chaos where smiles
were few as they were figuring it out

Frank he said youre a wonder Youll have a network of suits
spread here shortly which no one can break through Theyll all be
suing each other

Cowperwood smiled

I only want a little time thats all he replied Nevertheless
for the first time in his life he was a little depressed for now this
business to which he had devoted years of active work and thought was
ended

The thing that was troubling him most in all of this was not the five
hundred thousand dollars which was owing the city treasury and which
he knew would stir political and social life to the center once it
was generally knownthat was a legal or semilegal transaction at
leastbut rather the matter of the sixty thousand dollars worth of
unrestored city loan certificates which he had not been able to replace
in the sinkingfund and could not now even though the necessary money
should fall from heaven The fact of their absence was a matter of
source He pondered over the situation a good deal The thing to do he
thought if he went to Mollenhauer or Simpson or both he had never
met either of them but in view of Butlers desertion they were his only
recourse was to say that although he could not at present return the
five hundred thousand dollars if no action were taken against him now
which would prevent his resuming his business on a normal scale a little
later he would pledge his word that every dollar of the involved five
hundred thousand dollars would eventually be returned to the treasury
If they refused and injury was done him he proposed to let them wait
until he was good and ready which in all probability would be never
But really it was not quite clear how action against him was to be
preventedeven by them The money was down on his books as owing the
city treasury and it was down on the city treasurys books as owing
from him Besides there was a local organization known as the Citizens
Municipal Reform Association which occasionally conducted investigations
in connection with public affairs His defalcation would be sure to come
to the ears of this body and a public investigation might well follow
Various private individuals knew of it already His creditors for
instance who were now examining his books

This matter of seeing Mollenhauer or Simpson or both was important
anyhow he thought but before doing so he decided to talk it all over
with Harper Steger So several days after he had closed his doors he
sent for Steger and told him all about the transaction except that he
did not make it clear that he had not intended to put the certificates
in the sinkingfund unless he survived quite comfortably

Harper Steger was a tall thin graceful rather elegant man of gentle
voice and perfect manners who walked always as though he were a cat
and a dog were prowling somewhere in the offing He had a longish thin
face of a type that is rather attractive to women His eyes were blue
his hair brown with a suggestion of sandy red in it He had a steady
inscrutable gaze which sometimes came to you over a thin delicate hand
which he laid meditatively over his mouth He was cruel to the limit
of the word not aggressively but indifferently for he had no faith in
anything He was not poor He had not even been born poor He was just
innately subtle with the rather constructive thought which was about
the only thing that compelled him to work that he ought to be richer
than he wasmore conspicuous Cowperwood was an excellent avenue toward
legal prosperity Besides he was a fascinating customer Of all his
clients Steger admired Cowperwood most

Let them proceed against you he said on this occasion his brilliant
legal mind taking in all the phases of the situation at once I dont
see that there is anything more here than a technical charge If it
ever came to anything like that which I dont think it will the charge
would be embezzlement or perhaps larceny as bailee In this instance
you were the bailee And the only way out of that would be to swear that
you had received the check with Steners knowledge and consent Then it
would only be a technical charge of irresponsibility on your part as I
see it and I dont believe any jury would convict you on the evidence
of how this relationship was conducted Still it might you never can
tell what a jury is going to do All this would have to come out at a
trial however The whole thing it seems to me would depend on which
of you twoyourself or Stenerthe jury would be inclined to believe
and on how anxious this city crowd is to find a scapegoat for Stener
This coming election is the rub If this panic had come at any other
time

Cowperwood waved for silence He knew all about that It all depends
on what the politicians decide to do Im doubtful The situation is too
complicated It cant be hushed up They were in his private office at
his house What will be will be he added

What would that mean Harper legally if I were tried on a charge of
larceny as bailee as you put it and convicted How many years in the
penitentiary at the outside

Steger thought a minute rubbing his chin with his hand Let me see
he said that is a serious question isnt it The law says one to
five years at the outside but the sentences usually average from one to
three years in embezzlement cases Of course in this case

I know all about that interrupted Cowperwood irritably My case
isnt any different from the others and you know it Embezzlement
is embezzlement if the politicians want to have it so He fell to
thinking and Steger got up and strolled about leisurely He was
thinking also

And would I have to go to jail at any time during the
proceedingsbefore a final adjustment of the case by the higher
courts Cowperwood added directly grimly after a time

Yes there is one point in all legal procedure of the kind replied
Steger cautiously now rubbing his ear and trying to put the matter as
delicately as possible You can avoid jail sentences all through
the earlier parts of a case like this but if you are once tried and
convicted its pretty hard to do anythingas a matter of fact it
becomes absolutely necessary then to go to jail for a few days five
or so pending the motion for a new trial and the obtaining of a
certificate of reasonable doubt It usually takes that long

The young banker sat there staring out of the window and Steger
observed It is a bit complicated isnt it

Well I should say so returned Frank and he added to himself
Jail Five days in prison That would be a terrific slap all things
considered Five days in jail pending the obtaining of a certificate of
reasonable doubt if one could be obtained He must avoid this Jail
The penitentiary His commercial reputation would never survive that





Chapter XXXII


The necessity of a final conference between Butler Mollenhauer and
Simpson was speedily reached for this situation was hourly growing more
serious Rumors were floating about in Third Street that in addition to
having failed for so large an amount as to have further unsettled
the already panicky financial situation induced by the Chicago fire
Cowperwood and Stener or Stener working with Cowperwood or the other
way round had involved the city treasury to the extent of five hundred
thousand dollars And the question was how was the matter to be kept
quiet until after election which was still three weeks away Bankers
and brokers were communicating odd rumors to each other about a check
that had been taken from the city treasury after Cowperwood knew he was
to fail and without Steners consent Also that there was danger
that it would come to the ears of that very uncomfortable political
organization known as the Citizens Municipal Reform Association
of which a wellknown ironmanufacturer of great probity and moral
rectitude one Skelton C Wheat was president Wheat had for years been
following on the trail of the dominant Republican administration in a
vain attempt to bring it to a sense of some of its political iniquities
He was a serious and austere manone of those solemn selfrighteous
souls who see life through a peculiar veil of duty and who undisturbed
by notable animal passions of any kind go their way of upholding the
theory of the Ten Commandments over the order of things as they are

The committee in question had originally been organized to protest
against some abuses in the tax department but since then from election
to election it had been drifting from one subject to another finding
an occasional evidence of its worthwhileness in some newspaper comment
and the frightened reformation of some minor political official who
ended usually by taking refuge behind the skirts of some higher
political powerin the last reaches Messrs Butler Mollenhauer and
Simpson Just now it was without important fuel or ammunition and this
assignment of Cowperwood with its attendant crime so far as the city
treasury was concerned threatened as some politicians and bankers saw
it to give it just the club it was looking for

However the decisive conference took place between Cowperwood and the
reigning political powers some five days after Cowperwoods failure at
the home of Senator Simpson which was located in Rittenhouse Squarea
region central for the older order of wealth in Philadelphia Simpson
was a man of no little refinement artistically of Quaker extraction
and of great wealthbreeding judgment which he used largely to satisfy
his craving for political predominance He was most liberal where money
would bring him a powerful or necessary political adherent He fairly
showered officescommissionerships trusteeships judgeships political
nominations and executive positions generallyon those who did his
bidding faithfully and without question Compared with Butler and
Mollenhauer he was more powerful than either for he represented the
State and the nation When the political authorities who were trying
to swing a national election were anxious to discover what the State of
Pennsylvania would do so far as the Republican party was concerned it
was to Senator Simpson that they appealed In the literal sense of
the word he knew The Senator had long since graduated from State to
national politics and was an interesting figure in the United States
Senate at Washington where his voice in all the conservative and
moneyed councils of the nation was of great weight

The house that he occupied of Venetian design and four stories in
height bore many architectural marks of distinction such as the
floriated window the door with the semipointed arch and medallions
of colored marble set in the walls The Senator was a great admirer of
Venice He had been there often as he had to Athens and Rome and had
brought back many artistic objects representative of the civilizations
and refinements of older days He was fond for one thing of the stern
sculptured heads of the Roman emperors and the fragments of gods and
goddesses which are the best testimony of the artistic aspirations of
Greece In the entresol of this house was one of his finest treasuresa
carved and floriated base bearing a tapering monolith some four feet
high crowned by the head of a peculiarly goatish Pan by the side of
which were the problematic remains of a lovely nude nymphjust the
little feet broken off at the ankles The base on which the feet of
the nymph and the monolith stood was ornamented with carved oxskulls
intertwined with roses In his reception hall were replicas of Caligula
Nero and other Roman emperors and on his stairwalls reliefs of
dancing nymphs in procession and priests bearing offerings of sheep and
swine to the sacrificial altars There was a clock in some corner of the
house which chimed the quarter the half the threequarters and the
hour in strange euphonious and pathetic notes On the walls of the
rooms were tapestries of Flemish origin and in the receptionhall the
library the livingroom and the drawingroom richly carved furniture
after the standards of the Italian Renaissance The Senators taste in
the matter of paintings was inadequate and he mistrusted it but such
as he had were of distinguished origin and authentic He cared more for
his curiocases filled with smaller imported bronzes Venetian glass
and Chinese jade He was not a collector of these in any notable
sensemerely a lover of a few choice examples Handsome tiger and
leopard skin rugs the fur of a muskox for his divan and tanned
and brownstained goat and kid skins for his tables gave a sense
of elegance and reserved profusion In addition the Senator had a
diningroom done after the Jacobean idea of artistic excellence and
a winecellar which the best of the local vintners looked after with
extreme care He was a man who loved to entertain lavishly and when his
residence was thrown open for a dinner a reception or a ball the best
of local society was to be found there

The conference was in the Senators library and he received his
colleagues with the genial air of one who has much to gain and little
to lose There were whiskies wines cigars on the table and while
Mollenhauer and Simpson exchanged the commonplaces of the day awaiting
the arrival of Butler they lighted cigars and kept their inmost
thoughts to themselves

It so happened that upon the previous afternoon Butler had
learned from Mr David Pettie the district attorney of the
sixtythousanddollarcheck transaction At the same time the matter
had been brought to Mollenhauers attention by Stener himself It was
Mollenhauer not Butler who saw that by taking advantage of Cowperwoods
situation he might save the local party from blame and at the same
time most likely fleece Cowperwood out of his streetrailway shares
without letting Butler or Simpson know anything about it The thing to
do was to terrorize him with a private threat of prosecution

Butler was not long in arriving and apologized for the delay
Concealing his recent grief behind as jaunty an air as possible he
began with

Its a lively life Im leadin what with every bank in the city
wantin to know how their loans are goin to be taken care of He took
a cigar and struck a match

It does look a little threatening said Senator Simpson smiling Sit
down I have just been talking with Avery Stone of Jay Cooke  Company
and he tells me that the talk in Third Street about Steners connection
with this Cowperwood failure is growing very strong and that the
newspapers are bound to take up the matter shortly unless something is
done about it I am sure that the news will also reach Mr Wheat of
the Citizens Reform Association very shortly We ought to decide now
gentlemen what we propose to do One thing I am sure is to eliminate
Stener from the ticket as quietly as possible This really looks to me
as if it might become a very serious issue and we ought to be doing
what we can now to offset its effect later

Mollenhauer pulled a long breath through his cigar and blew it out in
a rolling steelblue cloud He studied the tapestry on the opposite wall
but said nothing

There is one thing sure continued Senator Simpson after a time
seeing that no one else spoke and that is if we do not begin a
prosecution on our own account within a reasonable time some one else
is apt to and that would put rather a bad face on the matter My own
opinion would be that we wait until it is very plain that prosecution is
going to be undertaken by some one elsepossibly the Municipal Reform
Associationbut that we stand ready to step in and act in such a way
as to make it look as though we had been planning to do it all the time
The thing to do is to gain time and so I would suggest that it be
made as difficult as possible to get at the treasurers books
An investigation there if it begins at allas I think is very
likelyshould be very slow in producing the facts

The Senator was not at all for mincing words with his important
confreres when it came to vital issues He preferred in his
grandiloquent way to call a spade a spade

Now that sounds like very good sense to me said Butler sinking a
little lower in his chair for comforts sake and concealing his
true mood in regard to all this The boys could easily make that
investigation last three weeks I should think Theyre slow enough with
everything else if me memory doesnt fail me At the same time he was
cogitating as to how to inject the personality of Cowperwood and his
speedy prosecution without appearing to be neglecting the general
welfare of the local party too much

Yes that isnt a bad idea said Mollenhauer solemnly blowing a ring
of smoke and thinking how to keep Cowperwoods especial offense from
coming up at this conference and until after he had seen him

We ought to map out our program very carefully continued Senator
Simpson so that if we are compelled to act we can do so very quickly
I believe myself that this thing is certain to come to an issue within
a week if not sooner and we have no time to lose If my advice were
followed now I should have the mayor write the treasurer a letter
asking for information and the treasurer write the mayor his answer
and also have the mayor with the authority of the common council
suspend the treasurer for the time beingI think we have the authority
to do thator at least take over his principal duties but without for
the time being anyhow making any of these transactions publicuntil
we have to of course We ought to be ready with these letters to show
to the newspapers at once in case this action is forced upon us

I could have those letters prepared if you gentlemen have no
objection put in Mollenhauer quietly but quickly

Well that strikes me as sinsible said Butler easily Its about
the only thing we can do under the circumstances unless we could find
some one else to blame it on and I have a suggestion to make in that
direction Maybe were not as helpless as we might be all things
considered

There was a slight gleam of triumph in his eye as he said this at
the same time that there was a slight shadow of disappointment in
Mollenhauers So Butler knew and probably Simpson too

Just what do you mean asked the Senator looking at Butler
interestedly He knew nothing of the sixtythousanddollar check
transaction He had not followed the local treasury dealings very
closely nor had he talked to either of his confreres since the original
conference between them There havent been any outside parties mixed
up with this have there His own shrewd political mind was working

Noo I wouldnt call him an outside party exactly Senator went
on Butler suavely Its Cowperwood himself Im thinkin of Theres
somethin that has come up since I saw you gentlemen last that makes me
think that perhaps that young man isnt as innocent as he might be It
looks to me as though he was the ringleader in this business as though
he had been leadin Stener on against his will Ive been lookin into
the matter on me own account and as far as I can make out this man
Stener isnt as much to blame as I thought From all I can learn
Cowperwoods been threatenin Stener with one thing and another if he
didnt give him more money and only the other day he got a big sum
on false pretinses which might make him equally guilty with Stener
Theres sixtythousand dollars of city loan certificates that has been
paid for that arent in the sinkingfund And since the reputation of
the partys in danger this fall I dont see that we need to have any
particular consideration for him He paused strong in the conviction
that he had sent a most dangerous arrow flying in the direction of
Cowperwood as indeed he had Yet at this moment both the Senator and
Mollenhauer were not a little surprised seeing at their last meeting
he had appeared rather friendly to the young banker and this recent
discovery seemed scarcely any occasion for a vicious attitude on his
part Mollenhauer in particular was surprised for he had been looking
on Butlers friendship for Cowperwood as a possible stumbling block

Umm you dont tell me observed Senator Simpson thoughtfully
stroking his mouth with his pale hand

Yes I can confirm that said Mollenhauer quietly seeing his own
little private plan of browbeating Cowperwood out of his streetrailway
shares going glimmering I had a talk with Stener the other day about
this very matter and he told me that Cowperwood had been trying to
force him to give him three hundred thousand dollars more and that
when he refused Cowperwood managed to get sixty thousand dollars further
without his knowledge or consent

How could he do that asked Senator Simpson incredulously
Mollenhauer explained the transaction

Oh said the Senator when Mollenhauer had finished that indicates
a rather sharp person doesnt it And the certificates are not in the
sinkingfund eh

Theyre not chimed in Butler with considerable enthusiasm

Well I must say said Simpson rather relieved in his manner this
looks like a rather good thing than not to me A scapegoat possibly We
need something like this I see no reason under the circumstances for
trying to protect Mr Cowperwood We might as well try to make a point
of that if we have to The newspapers might just as well talk loud
about that as anything else They are bound to talk and if we give them
the right angle I think that the election might well come and go before
the matter could be reasonably cleared up even though Mr Wheat does
interfere I will be glad to undertake to see what can be done with the
papers

Well that bein the case said Butler I dont see that theres
so much more we can do now but I do think it will be a mistake if
Cowperwood isnt punished with the other one Hes equally guilty
with Stener if not more so and I for one want to see him get what he
deserves He belongs in the penitentiary and thats where hell go if
I have my say Both Mollenhauer and Simpson turned a reserved and
inquiring eye on their usually genial associate What could be the
reason for his sudden determination to have Cowperwood punished
Cowperwood as Mollenhauer and Simpson saw it and as Butler would
ordinarily have seen it was well within his human if not his strictly
legal rights They did not blame him half as much for trying to do what
he had done as they blamed Stener for letting him do it But since
Butler felt as he did and there was an actual technical crime here
they were perfectly willing that the party should have the advantage of
it even if Cowperwood went to the penitentiary

You may be right said Senator Simpson cautiously You might have
those letters prepared Henry and if we have to bring any action at
all against anybody before election it would perhaps be advisable
to bring it against Cowperwood Include Stener if you have to but not
unless you have to I leave it to you two as I am compelled to start
for Pittsburg next Friday but I know you will not overlook any point

The Senator arose His time was always valuable Butler was highly
gratified by what he had accomplished He had succeeded in putting the
triumvirate on record against Cowperwood as the first victim in case of
any public disturbance or demonstration against the party All that was
now necessary was for that disturbance to manifest itself and from
what he could see of local conditions it was not far off There was now
the matter of Cowperwoods disgruntled creditors to look into and if
by buying in these he should succeed in preventing the financier from
resuming business he would have him in a very precarious condition
indeed It was a sad day for Cowperwood Butler thoughtthe day he had
first tried to lead Aileen astrayand the time was not far off when he
could prove it to him





Chapter XXXIII


In the meantime Cowperwood from what he could see and hear was
becoming more and more certain that the politicians would try to make
a scapegoat of him and that shortly For one thing Stires had called
only a few days after he closed his doors and imparted a significant bit
of information Albert was still connected with the city treasury as
was Stener and engaged with Sengstack and another personal appointee of
Mollenhauers in going over the treasurers books and explaining their
financial significance Stires had come to Cowperwood primarily to get
additional advice in regard to the sixtythousanddollar check and his
personal connection with it Stener it seemed was now threatening to
have his chief clerk prosecuted saying that he was responsible for
the loss of the money and that his bondsmen could be held responsible
Cowperwood had merely laughed and assured Stires that there was nothing
to this

Albert he had said smilingly I tell you positively theres
nothing in it Youre not responsible for delivering that check to me
Ill tell you what you do now Go and consult my lawyerSteger It
wont cost you a cent and hell tell you exactly what to do Now go on
back and dont worry any more about it I am sorry this move of mine has
caused you so much trouble but its a hundred to one you couldnt have
kept your place with a new city treasurer anyhow and if I see any
place where you can possibly fit in later Ill let you know

Another thing that made Cowperwood pause and consider at this time was
a letter from Aileen detailing a conversation which had taken place at
the Butler dinner table one evening when Butler the elder was not
at home She related how her brother Owen in effect had stated that
theythe politiciansher father Mollenhauer and Simpson were going
to get him yet meaning Cowperwood for some criminal financial
manipulation of somethingshe could not explain whata check
or something Aileen was frantic with worry Could they mean the
penitentiary she asked in her letter Her dear lover Her beloved
Frank Could anything like this really happen to him

His brow clouded and he set his teeth with rage when he read her
letter He would have to do something about thissee Mollenhauer or
Simpson or both and make some offer to the city He could not promise
them money for the presentonly notesbut they might take them Surely
they could not be intending to make a scapegoat of him over such a
trivial and uncertain matter as this check transaction When there was
the five hundred thousand advanced by Stener to say nothing of all
the past shady transactions of former city treasurers How rotten How
political but how real and dangerous

But Simpson was out of the city for a period of ten days and
Mollenhauer having in mind the suggestion made by Butler in regard to
utilizing Cowperwoods misdeed for the benefit of the party had already
moved as they had planned The letters were ready and waiting Indeed
since the conference the smaller politicians taking their cue from
the overlords had been industriously spreading the story of the
sixtythousanddollar check and insisting that the burden of guilt
for the treasury defalcation if any lay on the banker The moment
Mollenhauer laid eyes on Cowperwood he realized however that he had
a powerful personality to deal with Cowperwood gave no evidence of
fright He merely stated in his bland way that he had been in the
habit of borrowing money from the city treasury at a low rate of
interest and that this panic had involved him so that he could not
possibly return it at present

I have heard rumors Mr Mollenhauer he said to the effect that
some charge is to be brought against me as a partner with Mr Stener
in this matter but I am hoping that the city will not do that and I
thought I might enlist your influence to prevent it My affairs are not
in a bad way at all if I had a little time to arrange matters I am
making all of my creditors an offer of fifty cents on the dollar now
and giving notes at one two and three years but in this matter of the
city treasury loans if I could come to terms I would be glad to make
it a hundred centsonly I would want a little more time Stocks are
bound to recover as you know and barring my losses at this time
I will be all right I realize that the matter has gone pretty far
already The newspapers are likely to start talking at any time
unless they are stopped by those who can control them He looked at
Mollenhauer in a complimentary way But if I could be kept out of
the general proceedings as much as possible my standing would not be
injured and I would have a better chance of getting on my feet It
would be better for the city for then I could certainly pay it what I
owe it He smiled his most winsome and engaging smile And Mollenhauer
seeing him for the first time was not unimpressed Indeed he looked at
this young financial David with an interested eye If he could have
seen a way to accept this proposition of Cowperwoods so that the money
offered would have been eventually payable to him and if Cowperwood had
had any reasonable prospect of getting on his feet soon he would have
considered carefully what he had to say For then Cowperwood could
have assigned his recovered property to him As it was there was small
likelihood of this situation ever being straightened out The Citizens
Municipal Reform Association from all he could hear was already on the
moveinvestigating or about to and once they had set their hands to
this would unquestionably follow it closely to the end

The trouble with this situation Mr Cowperwood he said affably is
that it has gone so far that it is practically out of my hands I really
have very little to do with it I dont suppose though really it is
this matter of the fivehundredthousanddollar loan that is worrying
you so much as it is this other matter of the sixtythousanddollar
check you received the other day Mr Stener insists that you secured
that illegally and he is very much wrought up about it The mayor and
the other city officials know of it now and they may force some action
I dont know

Mollenhauer was obviously not frank in his attitudea little bit
evasive in his sly reference to his official tool the mayor and
Cowperwood saw it It irritated him greatly but he was tactful enough
to be quite suave and respectful

I did get a check for sixty thousand dollars thats true he
replied with apparent frankness the day before I assigned It was for
certificates I had purchased however on Mr Steners order and was
due me I needed the money and asked for it I dont see that there is
anything illegal in that

Not if the transaction was completed in all its details replied
Mollenhauer blandly As I understand it the certificates were bought
for the sinkingfund and they are not there How do you explain that

An oversight merely replied Cowperwood innocently and quite as
blandly as Mollenhauer They would have been there if I had not been
compelled to assign so unexpectedly It was not possible for me to
attend to everything in person It has not been our custom to deposit
them at once Mr Stener will tell you that if you ask him

You dont say replied Mollenhauer He did not give me that
impression However they are not there and I believe that that makes
some difference legally I have no interest in the matter one way or the
other more than that of any other good Republican I dont see exactly
what I can do for you What did you think I could do

I dont believe you can do anything for me Mr Mollenhauer replied
Cowperwood a little tartly unless you are willing to deal quite
frankly with me I am not a beginner in politics in Philadelphia I know
something about the powers in command I thought that you could stop any
plan to prosecute me in this matter and give me time to get on my feet
again I am not any more criminally responsible for that sixty thousand
dollars than I am for the five hundred thousand dollars that I had as
loan before itnot as much so I did not create this panic I did not
set Chicago on fire Mr Stener and his friends have been reaping some
profit out of dealing with me I certainly was entitled to make some
effort to save myself after all these years of service and I cant
understand why I should not receive some courtesy at the hands of
the present city administration after I have been so useful to it I
certainly have kept city loan at par and as for Mr Steners money he
has never wanted for his interest on that and more than his interest

Quite so replied Mollenhauer looking Cowperwood in the eye steadily
and estimating the force and accuracy of the man at their real value I
understand exactly how it has all come about Mr Cowperwood No doubt
Mr Stener owes you a debt of gratitude as does the remainder of the
city administration Im not saying what the city administration ought
or ought not do All I know is that you find yourself wittingly or
unwittingly in a dangerous situation and that public sentiment in
some quarters is already very strong against you I personally have
no feeling one way or the other and if it were not for the situation
itself which looks to be out of hand would not be opposed to assisting
you in any reasonable way But how The Republican party is in a very
bad position so far as this election is concerned In a way however
innocently you have helped to put it there Mr Cowperwood Mr Butler
for some reason to which I am not a party seems deeply and personally
incensed And Mr Butler is a great power here Cowperwood began
to wonder whether by any chance Butler had indicated the nature of
his social offense against himself but he could not bring himself to
believe that It was not probable I sympathize with you greatly Mr
Cowperwood but what I suggest is that you first See Mr Butler and Mr
Simpson If they agree to any program of aid I will not be opposed to
joining But apart from that I do not know exactly what I can do I am
only one of those who have a slight say in the affairs of Philadelphia

At this point Mollenhauer rather expected Cowperwood to make an offer
of his own holdings but he did not Instead he said Im very much
obliged to you Mr Mollenhauer for the courtesy of this interview I
believe you would help me if you could I shall just have to fight it
out the best way I can Good day

And he bowed himself out He saw clearly how hopeless was his quest

In the meanwhile finding that the rumors were growing in volume and
that no one appeared to be willing to take steps to straighten the
matter out Mr Skelton C Wheat President of the Citizens Municipal
Reform Association was at last and that by no means against his will
compelled to call together the committee of ten estimable Philadelphians
of which he was chairman in a local committeehall on Market Street
and lay the matter of the Cowperwood failure before it

It strikes me gentlemen he announced that this is an occasion when
this organization can render a signal service to the city and the people
of Philadelphia and prove the significance and the merit of the title
originally selected for it by making such a thoroughgoing investigation
as will bring to light all the facts in this case and then by standing
vigorously behind them insist that such nefarious practices as we are
informed were indulged in in this case shall cease I know it may prove
to be a difficult task The Republican party and its local and State
interests are certain to be against us Its leaders are unquestionably
most anxious to avoid comment and to have their ticket go through
undisturbed and they will not contemplate with any equanimity our
opening activity in this matter but if we persevere great good will
surely come of it There is too much dishonesty in public life as it is
There is a standard of right in these matters which cannot permanently
be ignored and which must eventually be fulfilled I leave this matter
to your courteous consideration

Mr Wheat sat down and the body before him immediately took the
matter which he proposed under advisement It was decided to appoint a
subcommittee to investigate to quote the statement eventually given
to the public the peculiar rumors now affecting one of the most
important and distinguished offices of our municipal government and to
report at the next meeting which was set for the following evening at
nine oclock The meeting adjourned and the following night at nine
reassembled four individuals of very shrewd financial judgment
having meantime been about the task assigned them They drew up a very
elaborate statement not wholly in accordance with the facts but as
nearly so as could be ascertained in so short a space of time

It appears read the report after a preamble which explained why
the committee had been appointed that it has been the custom of city
treasurers for years when loans have been authorized by councils to
place them in the hands of some favorite broker for sale the broker
accounting to the treasurer for the moneys received by such sales at
short periods generally the first of each month In the present
case Frank A Cowperwood has been acting as such broker for the city
treasurer But even this vicious and unbusinesslike system appears not
to have been adhered to in the case of Mr Cowperwood The accident of
the Chicago fire the consequent depression of stock values and the
subsequent failure of Mr Frank A Cowperwood have so involved matters
temporarily that the committee has not been able to ascertain with
accuracy that regular accounts have been rendered but from the manner
in which Mr Cowperwood has had possession of bonds city loan for
hypothecation etc it would appear that he has been held to no
responsibility in these matters and that there have always been under
his control several hundred thousand dollars of cash or securities
belonging to the city which he has manipulated for various purposes
but the details of the results of these transactions are not easily
available

Some of the operations consisted of hypothecation of large amounts of
these loans before the certificates were issued the lender seeing that
the order for the hypothecated securities was duly made to him on the
books of the treasurer Such methods appear to have been occurring for
a long time and it being incredible that the city treasurer could
be unaware of the nature of the business there is indication of a
complicity between him and Mr Cowperwood to benefit by the use of the
city credit in violation of the law

Furthermore at the very time these hypothecations were being made and
the city paying interest upon such loans the money representing them
was in the hands of the treasurers broker and bearing no interest to
the city The payment of municipal warrants was postponed and they were
being purchased at a discount in large amounts by Mr Cowperwood with
the very money that should have been in the city treasury The bona fide
holders of the orders for certificates of loans are now unable to obtain
them and thus the citys credit is injured to a greater extent than
the present defalcation which amounts to over five hundred thousand
dollars An accountant is now at work on the treasurers books and a
few days should make clear the whole modus operandi It is hoped that
the publicity thus obtained will break up such vicious practices

There was appended to this report a quotation from the law governing the
abuse of a public trust and the committee went on to say that unless
some taxpayer chose to initiate proceedings for the prosecution of those
concerned the committee itself would be called upon to do so although
such action hardly came within the object for which it was formed

This report was immediately given to the papers Though some sort of
a public announcement had been anticipated by Cowperwood and the
politicians this was nevertheless a severe blow Stener was
beside himself with fear He broke into a cold sweat when he saw the
announcement which was conservatively headed Meeting of the Municipal
Reform Association All of the papers were so closely identified with
the political and financial powers of the city that they did not dare to
come out openly and say what they thought The chief facts had already
been in the hands of the various editors and publishers for a week and
more but word had gone around from Mollenhauer Simpson and Butler to
use the soft pedal for the present It was not good for Philadelphia
for local commerce etc to make a row The fair name of the city would
be smirched It was the old story

At once the question was raised as to who was really guilty the city
treasurer or the broker or both How much money had actually been lost
Where had it gone Who was Frank Algernon Cowperwood anyway Why was
he not arrested How did he come to be identified so closely with the
financial administration of the city And though the day of what later
was termed yellow journalism had not arrived and the local papers
were not given to such vital personal comment as followed later it
was not possible even bound as they were hand and foot by the local
political and social magnates to avoid comment of some sort Editorials
had to be written Some solemn conservative references to the shame and
disgrace which one single individual could bring to a great city and a
noble political party had to be ventured upon

That desperate scheme to cast the blame on Cowperwood temporarily which
had been concocted by Mollenhauer Butler and Simpson to get the odium
of the crime outside the party lines for the time being was now lugged
forth and put in operation It was interesting and strange to note
how quickly the newspapers and even the Citizens Municipal Reform
Association adopted the argument that Cowperwood was largely if not
solely to blame Stener had loaned him the money it is truehad put
bond issues in his hands for sale it is true but somehow every one
seemed to gain the impression that Cowperwood had desperately misused
the treasurer The fact that he had taken a sixtythousanddollar check
for certificates which were not in the sinkingfund was hinted at
though until they could actually confirm this for themselves both the
newspapers and the committee were too fearful of the State libel laws to
say so

In due time there were brought forth several noble municipal letters
purporting to be a stern call on the part of the mayor Mr Jacob
Borchardt on Mr George W Stener for an immediate explanation of
his conduct and the latters reply which were at once given to the
newspapers and the Citizens Municipal Reform Association These letters
were enough to show so the politicians figured that the Republican
party was anxious to purge itself of any miscreant within its ranks and
they also helped to pass the time until after election

 OFFICE OF THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA

 GEORGE W STENER ESQ October 18
 1871 City Treasurer

 DEAR SIRInformation has been given
 me that certificates of city loan to a large amount issued
 by you for sale on account of the city and I presume
 after the usual requisition from the mayor of the city have
 passed out of your custody and that the proceeds of the
 sale of said certificates have not been paid into the city
 treasury

 I have also been informed that a large amount of the citys
 money has been permitted to pass into the hands of some one
 or more brokers or bankers doing business on Third Street
 and that said brokers or bankers have since met with
 financial difficulties whereby and by reason of the above
 generally the interests of the city are likely to be very
 seriously affected

 I have therefore to request that you will promptly advise me
 of the truth or falsity of these statements so that such
 duties as devolve upon me as the chief magistrate of the
 city in view of such facts if they exist may be
 intelligently discharged Yours respectfully

 JACOB BORCHARDT Mayor of Philadelphia


 OFFICE OF THE TREASURER OF THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA

 HON JACOB BORCHARDT October 19 1871

 DEAR SIRI have to acknowledge the receipt of your
 communication of the 21st instant and to express my regret
 that I cannot at this time give you the information you ask
 There is undoubtedly an embarrassment in the city treasury
 owing to the delinquency of the broker who for several years
 past has negotiated the city loans and I have been since
 the discovery of this fact and still am occupied in
 endeavoring to avert or lessen the loss with which the city
 is threatened I am very respectfully GEORGE W STENER


 OFFICE OF THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA

 GEORGE W STENER ESQ October 21 1871
 City Treasurer

 DEAR SIRUnder the existing
 circumstances you will consider this as a notice of
 withdrawal and revocation of any requisition or authority by
 me for the sale of loan so far as the same has not been
 fulfilled Applications for loans may for the present be
 made at this office Very respectfully

 JACOB BORCHARDT Mayor of Philadelphia

And did Mr Jacob Borchardt write the letters to which his name
was attached He did not Mr Abner Sengstack wrote them in Mr
Mollenhauers office and Mr Mollenhauers comment when he saw them was
that he thought they would dothat they were very good in fact And
did Mr George W Stener city treasurer of Philadelphia write that
very politic reply He did not Mr Stener was in a state of complete
collapse even crying at one time at home in his bathtub Mr Abner
Sengstack wrote that also and had Mr Stener sign it And Mr
Mollenhauers comment on that before it was sent was that he thought
it was all right It was a time when all the little rats and mice were
scurrying to cover because of the presence of a great fieryeyed public
cat somewhere in the dark and only the older and wiser rats were able
to act

Indeed at this very time and for some days past now Messrs
Mollenhauer Butler and Simpson were and had been considering
with Mr Pettie the district attorney just what could be done about
Cowperwood if anything and in order to further emphasize the blame in
that direction and just what defense if any could be made for Stener
Butler of course was strong for Cowperwoods prosecution Pettie did
not see that any defense could be made for Stener since various records
of streetcar stocks purchased for him were spread upon Cowperwoods
books but for CowperwoodLet me see he said They were speculating
first of all as to whether it might not be good policy to arrest
Cowperwood and if necessary try him since his mere arrest would seem
to the general public at least positive proof of his greater guilt
to say nothing of the virtuous indignation of the administration and in
consequence might tend to divert attention from the evil nature of the
party until after election

So finally on the afternoon of October 26 1871 Edward Strobik
president of the common council of Philadelphia appeared before the
mayor as finally ordered by Mollenhauer and charged by affidavit that
Frank A Cowperwood as broker employed by the treasurer to sell the
bonds of the city had committed embezzlement and larceny as bailee It
did not matter that he charged George W Stener with embezzlement at the
same time Cowperwood was the scapegoat they were after





Chapter XXXIV


The contrasting pictures presented by Cowperwood and Stener at this
time are well worth a moments consideration Steners face was
grayishwhite his lips blue Cowperwood despite various solemn
thoughts concerning a possible period of incarceration which this hue
and cry now suggested and what that meant to his parents his wife
and children his business associates and his friends was as calm and
collected as one might assume his great mental resources would permit
him to be During all this whirl of disaster he had never once lost his
head or his courage That thing conscience which obsesses and rides
some people to destruction did not trouble him at all He had no
consciousness of what is currently known as sin There were just two
faces to the shield of life from the point of view of his peculiar
mindstrength and weakness Right and wrong He did not know about
those They were bound up in metaphysical abstrusities about which he
did not care to bother Good and evil Those were toys of clerics
by which they made money And as for social favor or social ostracism
which on occasion so quickly followed upon the heels of disaster of
any kind well what was social ostracism Had either he or his parents
been of the best society as yet And since not and despite this present
mixup might not the future hold social restoration and position for
him It might Morality and immorality He never considered them But
strength and weaknessoh yes If you had strength you could protect
yourself always and be something If you were weakpass quickly to the
rear and get out of the range of the guns He was strong and he knew
it and somehow he always believed in his star Somethinghe could
not say whatit was the only metaphysics he bothered aboutwas doing
something for him It had always helped him It made things come out
right at times It put excellent opportunities in his way Why had he
been given so fine a mind Why always favored financially personally
He had not deserved itearned it Accident perhaps but somehow
the thought that he would always be protectedthese intuitions
the hunches to act which he frequently hadcould not be so easily
explained Life was a dark insoluble mystery but whatever it was
strength and weakness were its two constituents Strength would
winweakness lose He must rely on swiftness of thought accuracy
his judgment and on nothing else He was really a brilliant picture of
courage and energymoving about briskly in a jaunty dapper way his
mustaches curled his clothes pressed his nails manicured his face
cleanshaven and tinted with health

In the meantime Cowperwood had gone personally to Skelton C Wheat and
tried to explain his side of the situation alleging that he had done no
differently from many others before him but Wheat was dubious He
did not see how it was that the sixty thousand dollars worth of
certificates were not in the sinkingfund Cowperwoods explanation
of custom did not avail Nevertheless Mr Wheat saw that others in
politics had been profiting quite as much as Cowperwood in other ways
and he advised Cowperwood to turn states evidence This however he
promptly refused to dohe was no squealer and indicated as much to
Mr Wheat who only smiled wryly

Butler Sr was delighted concerned though he was about party success
at the polls for now he had this villain in the toils and he would
have a fine time getting out of this The incoming district attorney to
succeed David Pettie if the Republican party won would be as was
now planned an appointee of Butlersa young Irishman who had done
considerable legal work for himone Dennis Shannon The other two party
leaders had already promised Butler that Shannon was a smart
athletic goodlooking fellow all of five feet ten inches in height
sandyhaired pinkcheeked blueeyed considerable of an orator and a
fine legal fighter He was very proud to be in the old mans favorto
be promised a place on the ticket by himand would he said if
elected do his bidding to the best of his knowledge and ability

There was only one fly in the ointment so far as some of the
politicians were concerned and that was that if Cowperwood were
convicted Stener must needs be also There was no escape in so far as
any one could see for the city treasurer If Cowperwood was guilty of
securing by trickery sixty thousand dollars worth of the city money
Stener was guilty of securing five hundred thousand dollars The
prison term for this was five years He might plead not guilty and by
submitting as evidence that what he did was due to custom save himself
from the odious necessity of pleading guilty but he would be convicted
nevertheless No jury could get by the fact in regard to him In spite
of public opinion when it came to a trial there might be considerable
doubt in Cowperwoods case There was none in Steners

The practical manner in which the situation was furthered after
Cowperwood and Stener were formally charged may be quickly noted
Steger Cowperwoods lawyer learned privately beforehand that
Cowperwood was to be prosecuted He arranged at once to have his
client appear before any warrant could be served and to forestall the
newspaper palaver which would follow it if he had to be searched for

The mayor issued a warrant for Cowperwoods arrest and in accordance
with Stegers plan Cowperwood immediately appeared before Borchardt in
company with his lawyer and gave bail in twenty thousand dollars W C
Davison president of the Girard National Bank being his surety for
his appearance at the central police station on the following Saturday
for a hearing Marcus Oldslaw a lawyer had been employed by Strobik
as president of the common council to represent him in prosecuting the
case for the city The mayor looked at Cowperwood curiously for he
being comparatively new to the political world of Philadelphia was not
so familiar with him as others were and Cowperwood returned the look
pleasantly enough

This is a great dumb show Mr Mayor he observed once to Borchardt
quietly and the latter replied with a smile and a kindly eye that as
far as he was concerned it was a form of procedure which was absolutely
unavoidable at this time

You know how it is Mr Cowperwood he observed The latter smiled I
do indeed he said

Later there followed several more or less perfunctory appearances in a
local police court known as the Central Court where when arraigned he
pleaded not guilty and finally his appearance before the November grand
jury where owing to the complicated nature of the charge drawn up
against him by Pettie he thought it wise to appear He was properly
indicted by the latter body Shannon the newly elected district
attorney making a demonstration in force and his trial ordered for
December 5th before a certain Judge Payderson in Part I of Quarter
Sessions which was the local branch of the State courts dealing with
crimes of this character His indictment did not occur however before
the coming and going of the muchmooted fall election which resulted
thanks to the clever political manipulations of Mollenhauer and Simpson
ballotbox stuffing and personal violence at the polls not barred in
another victory by however a greatly reduced majority The Citizens
Municipal Reform Association in spite of a resounding defeat at the
polls which could not have happened except by fraud continued to
fire courageously away at those whom it considered to be the chief
malefactors

Aileen Butler during all this time was following the trend of
Cowperwoods outward vicissitudes as heralded by the newspapers and the
local gossip with as much interest and bias and enthusiasm for him as
her powerful physical and affectional nature would permit She was no
great reasoner where affection entered in but shrewd enough without
it and although she saw him often and he told her muchas much as his
natural caution would permitshe yet gathered from the newspapers and
private conversation at her own familys table and elsewhere that
as bad as they said he was he was not as bad as he might be One item
only clipped from the Philadelphia Public Ledger soon after Cowperwood
had been publicly accused of embezzlement comforted and consoled her
She cut it out and carried it in her bosom for somehow it seemed to
show that her adored Frank was far more sinned against than sinning
It was a part of one of those very numerous pronunciamientos or reports
issued by the Citizens Municipal Reform Association and it ran

The aspects of the case are graver than have yet been allowed to reach
the public Five hundred thousand dollars of the deficiency arises not
from city bonds sold and not accounted for but from loans made by the
treasurer to his broker The committee is also informed on what it
believes to be good authority that the loans sold by the broker were
accounted for in the monthly settlements at the lowest prices current
during the month and that the difference between this rate and that
actually realized was divided between the treasurer and the broker thus
making it to the interest of both parties to bear the market at some
time during the month so as to obtain a low quotation for settlement
Nevertheless the committee can only regard the prosecution instituted
against the broker Mr Cowperwood as an effort to divert public
attention from more guilty parties while those concerned may be able to
fix matters to suit themselves

There thought Aileen when she read it there you have it
These politiciansher father among them as she gathered after his
conversation with herwere trying to put the blame of their own evil
deeds on her Frank He was not nearly as bad as he was painted The
report said so She gloated over the words an effort to divert public
attention from more guilty parties That was just what her Frank
had been telling her in those happy private hours when they had
been together recently in one place and another particularly the new
rendezvous in South Sixth Street which he had established since the
old one had to be abandoned He had stroked her rich hair caressed her
body and told her it was all a prearranged political scheme to cast the
blame as much as possible on him and make it as light as possible for
Stener and the party generally He would come out of it all right he
said but he cautioned her not to talk He did not deny his long and
profitable relations with Stener He told her exactly how it was She
understood or thought she did Anyhow her Frank was telling her and
that was enough

As for the two Cowperwood households so recently and pretentiously
joined in success now so gloomily tied in failure the life was going
out of them Frank Algernon was that life He was the courage and force
of his father the spirit and opportunity of his brothers the hope of
his children the estate of his wife the dignity and significance
of the Cowperwood name All that meant opportunity force emolument
dignity and happiness to those connected with him he was And his
marvelous sun was waning apparently to a black eclipse

Since the fatal morning for instance when Lillian Cowperwood had
received that utterly destructive note like a cannonball ripping
through her domestic affairs she had been walking like one in a trance
Each day now for weeks she had been going about her duties placidly
enough to all outward seeming but inwardly she was running with a
troubled tide of thought She was so utterly unhappy Her fortieth year
had come for her at a time when life ought naturally to stand fixed and
firm on a solid base and here she was about to be torn bodily from
the domestic soil in which she was growing and blooming and thrown out
indifferently to wither in the blistering noonday sun of circumstance

As for Cowperwood Senior his situation at his bank and elsewhere was
rapidly nearing a climax As has been said he had had tremendous
faith in his son but he could not help seeing that an error had been
committed as he thought and that Frank was suffering greatly for it
now He considered of course that Frank had been entitled to try to
save himself as he had but he so regretted that his son should have put
his foot into the trap of any situation which could stir up discussion
of the sort that was now being aroused Frank was wonderfully brilliant
He need never have taken up with the city treasurer or the politicians
to have succeeded marvelously Local streetrailways and speculative
politicians were his undoing The old man walked the floor all of the
days realizing that his sun was setting that with Franks failure
he failed and that this disgracethese public chargesmeant his own
undoing His hair had grown very gray in but a few weeks his step slow
his face pallid his eyes sunken His rather showy sidewhiskers seemed
now like flags or ornaments of a better day that was gone His only
consolation through it all was that Frank had actually got out of his
relationship with the Third National Bank without owing it a single
dollar Still as he knew the directors of that institution could not
possibly tolerate the presence of a man whose son had helped loot the
city treasury and whose name was now in the public prints in this
connection Besides Cowperwood Sr was too old He ought to retire

The crisis for him therefore came on the day when Frank was arrested
on the embezzlement charge The old man through Frank who had it from
Steger knew it was coming still had the courage to go to the bank but
it was like struggling under the weight of a heavy stone to do it But
before going and after a sleepless night he wrote his resignation to
Frewen Kasson the chairman of the board of directors in order that
he should be prepared to hand it to him at once Kasson a stocky
wellbuilt magnetic man of fifty breathed an inward sigh of relief at
the sight of it

I know its hard Mr Cowperwood he said sympathetically Weand
I can speak for the other members of the boardwe feel keenly the
unfortunate nature of your position We know exactly how it is that your
son has become involved in this matter He is not the only banker who
has been involved in the citys affairs By no means It is an old
system We appreciate all of us keenly the services you have rendered
this institution during the past thirtyfive years If there were any
possible way in which we could help to tide you over the difficulties at
this time we would be glad to do so but as a banker yourself you must
realize just how impossible that would be Everything is in a turmoil
If things were settledif we knew how soon this would blow over He
paused for he felt that he could not go on and say that he or the bank
was sorry to be forced to lose Mr Cowperwood in this way at present
Mr Cowperwood himself would have to speak

During all this Cowperwood Sr had been doing his best to pull himself
together in order to be able to speak at all He had gotten out a
large white linen handkerchief and blown his nose and had straightened
himself in his chair and laid his hands rather peacefully on his desk
Still he was intensely wrought up

I cant stand this he suddenly exclaimed I wish you would leave me
alone now

Kasson very carefully dressed and manicured arose and walked out of
the room for a few moments He appreciated keenly the intensity of the
strain he had just witnessed The moment the door was closed Cowperwood
put his head in his hands and shook convulsively I never thought Id
come to this he muttered I never thought it Then he wiped away his
salty hot tears and went to the window to look out and to think of what
else to do from now on





Chapter XXXV


As time went on Butler grew more and more puzzled and restive as to his
duty in regard to his daughter He was sure by her furtive manner and
her apparent desire to avoid him that she was still in touch with
Cowperwood in some way and that this would bring about a social
disaster of some kind He thought once of going to Mrs Cowperwood and
having her bring pressure to bear on her husband but afterwards he
decided that that would not do He was not really positive as yet that
Aileen was secretly meeting Cowperwood and besides Mrs Cowperwood
might not know of her husbands duplicity He thought also of going to
Cowperwood personally and threatening him but that would be a severe
measure and again as in the other case he lacked proof He hesitated
to appeal to a detective agency and he did not care to take the other
members of the family into his confidence He did go out and scan the
neighborhood of 931 North Tenth Street once looking at the house
but that helped him little The place was for rent Cowperwood having
already abandoned his connection with it

Finally he hit upon the plan of having Aileen invited to go somewhere
some distance offBoston or New Orleans where a sister of his wife
lived It was a delicate matter to engineer and in such matters he was
not exactly the soul of tact but he undertook it He wrote personally
to his wifes sister at New Orleans and asked her if she would without
indicating in any way that she had heard from him write his wife and
ask if she would not permit Aileen to come and visit her writing Aileen
an invitation at the same time but he tore the letter up A little
later he learned accidentally that Mrs Mollenhauer and her three
daughters Caroline Felicia and Alta were going to Europe early in
December to visit Paris the Riviera and Rome and he decided to ask
Mollenhauer to persuade his wife to invite Norah and Aileen or Aileen
only to go along giving as an excuse that his own wife would not leave
him and that the girls ought to go It would be a fine way of disposing
of Aileen for the present The party was to be gone six months
Mollenhauer was glad to do so of course The two families were fairly
intimate Mrs Mollenhauer was willingdelighted from a politic point
of viewand the invitation was extended Norah was overjoyed She
wanted to see something of Europe and had always been hoping for some
such opportunity Aileen was pleased from the point of view that Mrs
Mollenhauer should invite her Years before she would have accepted in
a flash But now she felt that it only came as a puzzling interruption
one more of the minor difficulties that were tending to interrupt her
relations with Cowperwood She immediately threw cold water on the
proposition which was made one evening at dinner by Mrs Butler who
did not know of her husbands share in the matter but had received a
call that afternoon from Mrs Mollenhauer when the invitation had been
extended

Shes very anxious to have you two come along if your father dont
mind volunteered the mother and I should think yed have a fine
time Theyre going to Paris and the Riveera

Oh fine exclaimed Norah Ive always wanted to go to Paris Havent
you Ai Oh wouldnt that be fine

I dont know that I want to go replied Aileen She did not care to
compromise herself by showing any interest at the start Its coming
on winter and I havent any clothes Id rather wait and go some other
time

Oh Aileen Butler exclaimed Norah How you talk Ive heard you say
a dozen times youd like to go abroad some winter Now when the chance
comesbesides you can get your clothes made over there

Couldnt you get somethin over there inquired Mrs Butler Besides
youve got two or three weeks here yet

They wouldnt want a man around as a sort of guide and adviser would
they mother put in Callum

I might offer my services in that capacity myself observed Owen
reservedly

Im sure I dont know returned Mrs Butler smiling and at the same
time chewing a lusty mouthful Youll have to ast em my sons

Aileen still persisted She did not want to go It was too sudden It
was this It was that Just then old Butler came in and took his seat
at the head of the table Knowing all about it he was most anxious to
appear not to

You wouldnt object Edward would you queried his wife explaining
the proposition in general

Object he echoed with a well simulated but rough attempt at gayety
A fine thing Id be doing for meselfobjectin Id be glad if I could
get shut of the whole pack of ye for a time

What talk ye have said his wife A fine mess youd make of it livin
alone

Id not be alone belave me replied Butler Theres many a place Id
be welcome in this townno thanks to ye

And theres many a place ye wouldnt have been if it hadnt been for
me Im tellin ye that retorted Mrs Butler genially

And thats not stretchin the troot much aither he answered fondly

Aileen was adamant No amount of argument both on the part of Norah and
her mother had any effect whatever Butler witnessed the failure of his
plan with considerable dissatisfaction but he was not through When he
was finally convinced that there was no hope of persuading her to accept
the Mollenhauer proposition he decided after a while to employ a
detective

At that time the reputation of William A Pinkerton of detective fame
and of his agency was great The man had come up from poverty through a
series of vicissitudes to a high standing in his peculiar and to many
distasteful profession but to any one in need of such in themselves
calamitous services his very famous and decidedly patriotic connection
with the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln was a recommendation He or
rather his service had guarded the latter all his stormy incumbency
at the executive mansion There were offices for the management of the
companys business in Philadelphia Washington and New York to say
nothing of other places Butler was familiar with the Philadelphia sign
but did not care to go to the office there He decided once his mind
was made up on this score that he would go over to New York where he
was told the principal offices were

He made the simple excuse one day of business which was common enough
in his case and journeyed to New Yorknearly five hours away as
the trains ran thenarriving at two oclock At the offices on lower
Broadway he asked to see the manager whom he found to be a large
grossfeatured heavybodied man of fifty grayeyed grayhaired
puffily outlined as to countenance but keen and shrewd and with short
fatfingered hands which drummed idly on his desk as he talked He
was dressed in a suit of darkbrown wool cloth which struck Butler as
peculiarly showy and wore a large horseshoe diamond pin The old man
himself invariably wore conservative gray

How do you do said Butler when a boy ushered him into the presence
of this worthy whose name was MartinsonGilbert Martinson of American
and Irish extraction The latter nodded and looked at Butler shrewdly
recognizing him at once as a man of force and probably of position He
therefore rose and offered him a chair

Sit down he said studying the old Irishman from under thick bushy
eyebrows What can I do for you

Youre the manager are you asked Butler solemnly eyeing the man
with a shrewd inquiring eye

Yes sir replied Martinson simply Thats my position here

This Mr Pinkerton that runs this agencyhe wouldnt be about this
place now would he asked Butler carefully Id like to talk to him
personally if I might meaning no offense to you

Mr Pinkerton is in Chicago at present replied Mr Martinson I
dont expect him back for a week or ten days You can talk to me
though with the same confidence that you could to him Im the
responsible head here However youre the best judge of that

Butler debated with himself in silence for a few moments estimating the
man before him Are you a family man yourself he asked oddly

Yes sir Im married replied Martinson solemnly I have a wife and
two children

Martinson from long experience conceived that this must be a matter
of family misconducta son daughter wife Such cases were not
infrequent

I thought I would like to talk to Mr Pinkerton himself but if youre
the responsible head Butler paused

I am replied Martinson You can talk to me with the same freedom
that you could to Mr Pinkerton Wont you come into my private office
We can talk more at ease in there

He led the way into an adjoining room which had two windows looking down
into Broadway an oblong table heavy brown smoothly polished four
leatherbacked chairs and some pictures of the Civil War battles in
which the North had been victorious Butler followed doubtfully He
hated very much to take any one into his confidence in regard to Aileen
He was not sure that he would even now He wanted to look these fellys
over as he said in his mind He would decide then what he wanted to
do He went to one of the windows and looked down into the street where
there was a perfect swirl of omnibuses and vehicles of all sorts Mr
Martinson quietly closed the door

Now then if theres anything I can do for you Mr Martinson paused
He thought by this little trick to elicit Buders real nameit often
workedbut in this instance the name was not forthcoming Butler was
too shrewd

Im not so sure that I want to go into this said the old man
solemnly Certainly not if theres any risk of the thing not being
handled in the right way Theres somethin I want to find out
aboutsomethin that I ought to know but its a very private matter
with me and He paused to think and conjecture looking at Mr
Martinson the while The latter understood his peculiar state of mind
He had seen many such cases

Let me say right here to begin with Mr

Scanlon interpolated Butler easily thats as good a name as any if
you want to use one Im keepin me own to meself for the present

Scanlon continued Martinson easily I really dont care whether
its your right name or not I was just going to say that it might not
be necessary to have your right name under any circumstancesit all
depends upon what you want to know But so far as your private affairs
are concerned they are as safe with us as if you had never told them
to any one Our business is built upon confidence and we never betray
it We wouldnt dare We have men and women who have been in our employ
for over thirty years and we never retire any one except for cause and
we dont pick people who are likely to need to be retired for cause
Mr Pinkerton is a good judge of men There are others here who consider
that they are We handle over ten thousand separate cases in all parts
of the United States every year We work on a case only so long as we
are wanted We try to find out only such things as our customers want
We do not pry unnecessarily into anybodys affairs If we decide that we
cannot find out what you want to know we are the first to say so Many
cases are rejected right here in this office before we ever begin Yours
might be such a one We dont want cases merely for the sake of having
them and we are frank to say so Some matters that involve public
policy or some form of small persecution we dont touch at allwe
wont be a party to them You can see how that is You look to me to
be a man of the world I hope I am one Does it strike you that an
organization like ours would be likely to betray any ones confidence
He paused and looked at Butler for confirmation of what he had just
said

It wouldnt seem likely said the latter thats the truth Its not
aisy to bring your private affairs into the light of day though added
the old man sadly

They both rested

Well said Butler finally you look to me to be all right and Id
like some advice Mind ye Im willing to pay for it well enough and it
isnt anything thatll be very hard to find out I want to know whether
a certain man where I live is goin with a certain woman and where You
could find that out aisy enough I belavecouldnt you

Nothing easier replied Martinson We are doing it all the time Let
me see if I can help you just a moment Mr Scanlon in order to make it
easier for you It is very plain to me that you dont care to tell any
more than you can help and we dont care to have you tell any more
than we absolutely need We will have to have the name of the city of
course and the name of either the man or the woman but not necessarily
both of them unless you want to help us in that way Sometimes if you
give us the name of one partysay the man for illustrationand the
description of the womanan accurate oneor a photograph we can tell
you after a little while exactly what you want to know Of course its
always better if we have full information You suit yourself about that
Tell me as much or as little as you please and Ill guarantee that
we will do our best to serve you and that you will be satisfied
afterward

He smiled genially

Well that bein the case said Butler finally taking the leap with
many mental reservations however Ill be plain with you My names
not Scanlon Its Butler I live in Philadelphy Theres a man there a
banker by the name of CowperwoodFrank A Cowperwood

Wait a moment said Martinson drawing an ample pad out of his pocket
and producing a leadpencil I want to get that How do you spell it

Butler told him

Yes now go on

He has a place in Third StreetFrank A Cowperwoodany one can show
you where it is Hes just failed there recently

Oh thats the man interpolated Martinson Ive heard of him Hes
mixed up in some city embezzlement case over there I suppose the reason
you didnt go to our Philadelphia office is because you didnt want our
local men over there to know anything about it Isnt that it

Thats the man and thats the reason said Butler I dont care to
have anything of this known in Philadelphy Thats why Im here This
man has a house on Girard AvenueNineteenthirtyseven You can find
that out too when you get over there

Yes agreed Mr Martinson

Well its him that I want to know abouthimand a certain woman
or girl rather The old man paused and winced at this necessity of
introducing Aileen into the case He could scarcely think of ithe was
so fond of her He had been so proud of Aileen A dark smoldering rage
burned in his heart against Cowperwood

A relative of yourspossibly I suppose remarked Martinson
tactfully You neednt tell me any morejust give me a description if
you wish We may be able to work from that He saw quite clearly what a
fine old citizen in his way he was dealing with here and also that the
man was greatly troubled Butlers heavy meditative face showed it
You can be quite frank with me Mr Butler he added I think I
understand We only want such information as we must have to help you
nothing more

Yes said the old man dourly She is a relative Shes me daughter
in fact You look to me like a sensible honest man Im her father and
I wouldnt do anything for the world to harm her Its tryin to save
her I am Its him I want He suddenly closed one big fist forcefully

Martinson who had two daughters of his own observed the suggestive
movement

I understand how you feel Mr Butler he observed I am a father
myself Well do all we can for you If you can give me an accurate
description of her or let one of my men see her at your house or
office accidentally of course I think we can tell you in no time
at all if they are meeting with any regularity Thats all you want to
know is itjust that

Thats all said Butler solemnly

Well that oughtnt to take any time at all Mr Butlerthree or four
days possibly if we have any lucka week ten days two weeks It
depends on how long you want us to shadow him in case there is no
evidence the first few days

I want to know however long it takes replied Butler bitterly I
want to know if it takes a month or two months or three to find out I
want to know The old man got up as he said this very positive very
rugged And dont send me men that havent sinselots of it plase I
want men that are fathers if youve got emand that have sinse enough
to hold their tonguesnot bys

I understand Mr Butler Martinson replied Depend on it youll
have the best we have and you can trust them Theyll be discreet You
can depend on that The way Ill do will be to assign just one man to
the case at first some one you can see for yourself whether you like or
not Ill not tell him anything You can talk to him If you like him
tell him and hell do the rest Then if he needs any more help he can
get it What is your address

Butler gave it to him

And therell be no talk about this

None whateverI assure you

And whenll he be comin along

Tomorrow if you wish I have a man I could send tonight He isnt
here now or Id have him talk with you Ill talk to him though and
make everything clear You neednt worry about anything Your daughters
reputation will be safe in his hands

Thank you kindly commented Butler softening the least bit in a
gingerly way Im much obliged to you Ill take it as a great favor
and pay you well

Never mind about that Mr Butler replied Martinson Youre welcome
to anything this concern can do for you at its ordinary rates

He showed Butler to the door and the old man went out He was feeling
very depressed over thisvery shabby To think he should have to put
detectives on the track of his Aileen his daughter





Chapter XXXVI


The very next day there called at Butlers office a long
preternaturally solemn man of noticeable height and angularity
darkhaired darkeyed sallow with a face that was long and leathery
and particularly hawklike who talked with Butler for over an hour
and then departed That evening he came to the Butler house around
dinnertime and being shown into Butlers room was given a look at
Aileen by a ruse Butler sent for her standing in the doorway just
far enough to one side to yield a good view of her The detective stood
behind one of the heavy curtains which had already been put up for the
winter pretending to look out into the street

Did any one drive Sissy this mornin asked Butler of Aileen
inquiring after a favorite family horse Butlers plan in case the
detective was seen was to give the impression that he was a horseman
who had come either to buy or to sell His name was Jonas Alderson and
be looked sufficiently like a horsetrader to be one

I dont think so father replied Aileen I didnt Ill find out

Never mind What I want to know is did you intend using her tomorrow

No not if you want her Jerry suits me just as well

Very well then Leave her in the stable Butler quietly closed the
door Aileen concluded at once that it was a horse conference She knew
he would not dispose of any horse in which she was interested without
first consulting her and so she thought no more about it

After she was gone Alderson stepped out and declared that he was
satisfied Thats all I need to know he said Ill let you know in a
few days if I find out anything

He departed and within thirtysix hours the house and office
of Cowperwood the house of Butler the office of Harper Steger
Cowperwoods lawyer and Cowperwood and Aileen separately and personally
were under complete surveillance It took six men to do it at first and
eventually a seventh when the second meetingplace which was located
in South Sixth Street was discovered All the detectives were from New
York In a week all was known to Alderson It bad been agreed between
him and Butler that if Aileen and Cowperwood were discovered to have any
particular rendezvous Butler was to be notified some time when she was
there so that he might go immediately and confront her in person if
he wished He did not intend to kill Cowperwoodand Alderson would have
seen to it that he did not in his presence at least but he would give
him a good tonguelashing fell him to the floor in all likelihood
and march Aileen away There would be no more lying on her part as to
whether she was or was not going with Cowperwood She would not be able
to say after that what she would or would not do Butler would lay down
the law to her She would reform or he would send her to a reformatory
Think of her influence on her sister or on any good girlknowing what
she knew or doing what she was doing She would go to Europe after
this or any place he chose to send her

In working out his plan of action it was necessary for Butler to
take Alderson into his confidence and the detective made plain his
determination to safeguard Cowperwoods person

We couldnt allow you to strike any blows or do any violence Alderson
told Butler when they first talked about it Its against the rules
You can go in there on a searchwarrant if we have to have one I
can get that for you without anybodys knowing anything about your
connection with the case We can say its for a girl from New York But
youll have to go in in the presence of my men They wont permit any
trouble You can get your daughter all rightwell bring her away and
him too if you say so but youll have to make some charge against
him if we do Then theres the danger of the neighbors seeing You
cant always guarantee you wont collect a crowd that way Butler had
many misgivings about the matter It was fraught with great danger of
publicity Still he wanted to know He wanted to terrify Aileen if he
couldto reform her drastically


Within a week Alderson learned that Aileen and Cowperwood were visiting
an apparently private residence which was anything but that The house
on South Sixth Street was one of assignation purely but in its way it
was superior to the average establishment of its kindof red brick
whitestone trimmings four stories high and all the rooms some
eighteen in number furnished in a showy but cleanly way Its patronage
was highly exclusive only those being admitted who were known to the
mistress having been introduced by others This guaranteed that privacy
which the illicit affairs of this world so greatly required The mere
phrase I have an appointment was sufficient where either of
the parties was known to cause them to be shown to a private suite
Cowperwood had known of the place from previous experiences and when
it became necessary to abandon the North Tenth Street house he had
directed Aileen to meet him here

The matter of entering a place of this kind and trying to find any
one was as Alderson informed Butler on hearing of its character
exceedingly difficult It involved the right of search which was
difficult to get To enter by sheer force was easy enough in most
instances where the business conducted was in contradistinction to the
moral sentiment of the community but sometimes one encountered violent
opposition from the tenants themselves It might be so in this case The
only sure way of avoiding such opposition would be to take the woman
who ran the place into ones confidence and by paying her sufficiently
insure silence But I do not advise that in this instance Alderson
had told Butler for I believe this woman is particularly friendly
to your man It might be better in spite of the risk to take it by
surprise To do that he explained it would be necessary to have at
least three men in addition to the leaderperhaps four who once one
man had been able to make his entrance into the hallway on the door
being opened in response to a ring would appear quickly and enter with
and sustain him Quickness of search was the next thingthe prompt
opening of all doors The servants if any would have to be overpowered
and silenced in some way Money sometimes did this force accomplished
it at other times Then one of the detectives simulating a servant
could tap gently at the different doorsButler and the others standing
byand in case a face appeared identify it or not as the case might
be If the door was not opened and the room was not empty it could
eventually be forced The house was one of a solid block so that there
was no chance of escape save by the front and rear doors which were
to be safeguarded It was a daringly conceived scheme In spite of all
this secrecy in the matter of removing Aileen was to be preserved

When Butler heard of this he was nervous about the whole terrible
procedure He thought once that without going to the house he would
merely talk to his daughter declaring that he knew and that she could
not possibly deny it He would then give her her choice between going
to Europe or going to a reformatory But a sense of the raw brutality of
Aileens disposition and something essentially coarse in himself made
him eventually adopt the other method He ordered Alderson to perfect
his plan and once he found Aileen or Cowperwood entering the house to
inform him quickly He would then drive there and with the assistance
of these men confront her

It was a foolish scheme a brutalizing thing to do both from the point
of view of affection and any corrective theory he might have had No
good ever springs from violence But Butler did not see that He wanted
to frighten Aileen to bring her by shock to a realization of the
enormity of the offense she was committing He waited fully a week after
his word had been given and then one afternoon when his nerves were
worn almost thin from fretting the climax came Cowperwood had already
been indicted and was now awaiting trial Aileen had been bringing him
news from time to time of just how she thought her father was feeling
toward him She did not get this evidence direct from Butler of
coursehe was too secretive in so far as she was concerned to let
her know how relentlessly he was engineering Cowperwoods final
downfallbut from odd bits confided to Owen who confided them to
Callum who in turn innocently enough confided them to Aileen For
one thing she had learned in this way of the new district attorney
electhis probable attitudefor he was a constant caller at the Butler
house or office Owen had told Callum that he thought Shannon was going
to do his best to send Cowperwood upthat the old man thought he
deserved it

In the next place she had learned that her father did not want
Cowperwood to resume businessdid not feel he deserved to be allowed
to It would be a Gods blessing if the community were shut of him
he had said to Owen one morning apropos of a notice in the papers of
Cowperwoods legal struggles and Owen had asked Callum why he thought
the old man was so bitter The two sons could not understand it
Cowperwood heard all this from her and morebits about Judge
Payderson the judge who was to try him who was a friend of
Butlersalso about the fact that Stener might be sent up for the full
term of his crime but that he would be pardoned soon afterward

Apparently Cowperwood was not very much frightened He told her that
he had powerful financial friends who would appeal to the governor to
pardon him in case he was convicted and anyhow that he did not think
that the evidence was strong enough to convict him He was merely a
political scapegoat through public clamor and her fathers influence
since the latters receipt of the letter about them he had been the
victim of Butlers enmity and nothing more If it werent for your
father honey he declared I could have this indictment quashed in
no time Neither Mollenhauer nor Simpson has anything against me
personally I am sure They want me to get out of the streetrailway
business here in Philadelphia and of course they wanted to make
things look better for Stener at first but depend upon it if your
father hadnt been against me they wouldnt have gone to any such length
in making me the victim Your father has this fellow Shannon and these
minor politicians just where he wants them too Thats where the
trouble lies They have to go on

Oh I know replied Aileen Its me just me thats all If
it werent for me and what he suspects hed help you in a minute
Sometimes you know I think Ive been very bad for you I dont know
what I ought to do If I thought it would help you any Id not see you
any more for a while though I dont see what good that would do now
Oh I love you love you Frank I would do anything for you I dont
care what people think or say I love you

Oh you just think you do he replied jestingly Youll get over it
There are others

Others echoed Aileen resentfully and contemptuously After you
there arent any others I just want one man my Frank If you ever
desert me Ill go to hell Youll see

Dont talk like that Aileen he replied almost irritated I dont
like to hear you You wouldnt do anything of the sort I love you You
know Im not going to desert you It would pay you to desert me just
now

Oh how you talk she exclaimed Desert you Its likely isnt it
But if ever you desert me Ill do just what I say I swear it

Dont talk like that Dont talk nonsense

I swear it I swear by my love I swear by your successmy own
happiness Ill do just what I say Ill go to hell

Cowperwood got up He was a little afraid now of this deepseated
passion he had aroused It was dangerous He could not tell where it
would lead

It was a cheerless afternoon in November when Alderson duly informed
of the presence of Aileen and Cowperwood in the South Sixth Street
house by the detective on guard drove rapidly up to Butlers office and
invited him to come with him Yet even now Butler could scarcely believe
that he was to find his daughter there The shame of it The horror
What would he say to her How reproach her What would he do to
Cowperwood His large hands shook as he thought They drove rapidly
to within a few doors of the place where a second detective on guard
across the street approached Butler and Alderson descended from the
vehicle and together they approached the door It was now almost
fourthirty in the afternoon In a room within the house Cowperwood
his coat and vest off was listening to Aileens account of her
troubles

The room in which they were sitting at the time was typical of the
rather commonplace idea of luxury which then prevailed Most of the
sets of furniture put on the market for general sale by the furniture
companies were when they approached in any way the correct idea of
luxury imitations of one of the Louis periods The curtains were always
heavy frequently brocaded and not infrequently red The carpets were
richly flowered in high colors with a thick velvet nap The furniture
of whatever wood it might be made was almost invariably heavy
floriated and cumbersome This room contained a heavily constructed
bed of walnut with washstand bureau and wardrobe to match A large
square mirror in a gold frame was hung over the washstand Some poor
engravings of landscapes and several nude figures were hung in
gold frames on the wall The giltframed chairs were upholstered in
pinkandwhiteflowered brocade with polished brass tacks The carpet
was of thick Brussels pale cream and pink in hue with large blue
jardinieres containing flowers woven in as ornaments The general effect
was light rich and a little stuffy

You know I get desperately frightened sometimes said Aileen Father
might be watching us you know Ive often wondered what Id do if he
caught us I couldnt lie out of this could I

You certainly couldnt said Cowperwood who never failed to respond
to the incitement of her charms She had such lovely smooth arms a
full luxuriously tapering throat and neck her goldenred hair floated
like an aureole about her head and her large eyes sparkled The
wondrous vigor of a full womanhood was herserrant illbalanced
romantic but exquisite but you might as well not cross that bridge
until you come to it he continued I myself have been thinking that
we had better not go on with this for the present That letter ought to
have been enough to stop us for the time

He came over to where she stood by the dressingtable adjusting her
hair

Youre such a pretty minx he said He slipped his arm about her
and kissed her pretty mouth Nothing sweeter than you this side of
Paradise he whispered in her ear

While this was enacting Butler and the extra detective had stepped out
of sight to one side of the front door of the house while Alderson
taking the lead rang the bell A negro servant appeared

Is Mrs Davis in he asked genially using the name of the woman in
control Id like to see her

Just come in said the maid unsuspectingly and indicated a
receptionroom on the right Alderson took off his soft widebrimmed
hat and entered When the maid went upstairs he immediately returned to
the door and let in Butler and two detectives The four stepped into the
receptionroom unseen In a few moments the madam as the current word
characterized this type of woman appeared She was tall fair rugged
and not at all unpleasant to look upon She had lightblue eyes and a
genial smile Long contact with the police and the brutalities of sex in
her early life had made her wary a little afraid of how the world would
use her This particular method of making a living being illicit and
she having no other practical knowledge at her command she was as
anxious to get along peacefully with the police and the public generally
as any struggling tradesman in any walk of life might have been She had
on a loose blueflowered peignoir or dressinggown open at the front
tied with blue ribbons and showing a little of her expensive underwear
beneath A large opal ring graced her left middle finger and turquoises
of vivid blue were pendent from her ears She wore yellow silk slippers
with bronze buckles and altogether her appearance was not out of
keeping with the character of the receptionroom itself which was a
composite of goldflowered wallpaper blue and creamcolored Brussels
carpet heavily goldframed engravings of reclining nudes and a
giltframed pierglass which rose from the floor to the ceiling
Needless to say Butler was shocked to the soul of him by this
suggestive atmosphere which was supposed to include his daughter in its
destructive reaches

Alderson motioned one of his detectives to get behind the womanbetween
her and the doorwhich he did

Sorry to trouble you Mrs Davis he said but we are looking for a
couple who are in your house here Were after a runaway girl We dont
want to make any disturbancemerely to get her and take her away Mrs
Davis paled and opened her mouth Now dont make any noise or try to
scream or well have to stop you My men are all around the house
Nobody can get out Do you know anybody by the name of Cowperwood

Mrs Davis fortunately from one point of view was not of a
particularly nervous nor yet contentious type She was more or less
philosophic She was not in touch with the police here in Philadelphia
hence subject to exposure What good would it do to cry out she
thought The place was surrounded There was no one in the house at the
time to save Cowperwood and Aileen She did not know Cowperwood by his
name nor Aileen by hers They were a Mr and Mrs Montague to her

I dont know anybody by that name she replied nervously

Isnt there a girl here with red hair asked one of Aldersons
assistants And a man with a gray suit and a lightbrown mustache They
came in here half an hour ago You remember them dont you

Theres just one couple in the house but Im not sure whether theyre
the ones you want Ill ask them to come down if you wish Oh I wish
you wouldnt make any disturbance This is terrible

Well not make any disturbance replied Alderson if you dont Just
you be quiet We merely want to see the girl and take her away Now you
stay where you are What room are they in

In the second one in the rear upstairs Wont you let me go though
It will be so much better Ill just tap and ask them to come out

No Well tend to that You stay where you are Youre not going to get
into any trouble You just stay where you are insisted Alderson

He motioned to Butler who however now that he had embarked on his
grim task was thinking that he had made a mistake What good would it
do him to force his way in and make her come out unless he intended
to kill Cowperwood If she were made to come down here that would be
enough She would then know that he knew all He did not care to quarrel
with Cowperwood in any public way he now decided He was afraid to He
was afraid of himself

Let her go he said grimly doggedly referring to Mrs Davis But
watch her Tell the girl to come downstairs to me

Mrs Davis realizing on the moment that this was some family tragedy
and hoping in an agonized way that she could slip out of it peacefully
started upstairs at once with Alderson and his assistants who were close
at his heels Reaching the door of the room occupied by Cowperwood
and Aileen she tapped lightly At the time Aileen and Cowperwood were
sitting in a big armchair At the first knock Aileen blanched and
leaped to her feet Usually not nervous today for some reason she
anticipated trouble Cowperwoods eyes instantly hardened

Dont be nervous he said no doubt its only the servant Ill go

He started but Aileen interfered Wait she said Somewhat reassured
she went to the closet and taking down a dressinggown slipped it on
Meanwhile the tap came again Then she went to the door and opened it
the least bit

Mrs Montague exclaimed Mrs Davis in an obviously nervous forced
voice theres a gentleman downstairs who wishes to see you

A gentleman to see me exclaimed Aileen astonished and paling Are
you sure

Yes he says he wants to see you There are several other men with him
I think its some one who belongs to you maybe

Aileen realized on the instant as did Cowperwood what had in all
likelihood happened Butler or Mrs Cowperwood had trailed themin all
probability her father He wondered now what he should do to protect
her not himself He was in no way deeply concerned for himself even
here Where any woman was concerned he was too chivalrous to permit
fear It was not at all improbable that Butler might want to kill him
but that did not disturb him He really did not pay any attention to
that thought and he was not armed

Ill dress and go down he said when he saw Aileens pale face
You stay here And dont you worry in any way for Ill get you out of
thisnow dont worry This is my affair I got you in it and Ill get
you out of it He went for his hat and coat and added as he did so
You go ahead and dress but let me go first

Aileen the moment the door closed had begun to put on her clothes
swiftly and nervously Her mind was working like a rapidly moving
machine She was wondering whether this really could be her father
Perhaps it was not Might there be some other Mrs Montaguea real one
Supposing it was her fatherhe had been so nice to her in not telling
the family in keeping her secret thus far He loved hershe knew that
It makes all the difference in the world in a childs attitude on an
occasion like this whether she has been loved and petted and spoiled or
the reverse Aileen had been loved and petted and spoiled She could not
think of her father doing anything terrible physically to her or to any
one else But it was so hard to confront himto look into his eyes
When she had attained a proper memory of him her fluttering wits told
her what to do

No Frank she whispered excitedly if its father youd better let
me go I know how to talk to him He wont say anything to me You stay
here Im not afraidreally Im not If I want you Ill call you

He had come over and taken her pretty chin in his hands and was looking
solemnly into her eyes

You mustnt be afraid he said Ill go down If its your father
you can go away with him I dont think hell do anything either to you
or to me If it is he write me something at the office Ill be there
If I can help you in any way I will We can fix up something Theres
no use trying to explain this Say nothing at all

He had on his coat and overcoat and was standing with his hat in
his hand Aileen was nearly dressed struggling with the row of red
currentcolored buttons which fastened her dress in the back Cowperwood
helped her When she was readyhat gloves and allhe said

Now let me go first I want to see

No please Frank she begged courageously Let me I know its
father Who else could it be She wondered at the moment whether her
father had brought her two brothers but would not now believe it He
would not do that she knew You can come if I call She went on
Nothings going to happen though I understand him He wont do
anything to me If you go it will only make him angry Let me go You
stand in the door here If I dont call its all right Will you

She put her two pretty hands on his shoulders and he weighed the matter
very carefully Very well he said only Ill go to the foot of the
stairs with you

They went to the door and he opened it Outside were Alderson with two
other detectives and Mrs Davis standing perhaps five feet away

Well said Cowperwood commandingly looking at Alderson

Theres a gentleman downstairs wishes to see the lady said Alderson
Its her father I think he added quietly

Cowperwood made way for Aileen who swept by furious at the presence of
men and this exposure Her courage had entirely returned She was angry
now to think her father would make a public spectacle of her Cowperwood
started to follow

Id advise you not to go down there right away cautioned Alderson
sagely Thats her father Butlers her name isnt it He dont want
you so much as he wants her

Cowperwood nevertheless walked slowly toward the head of the stairs
listening

What made you come here father he heard Aileen ask

Butlers reply he could not hear but he was now at ease for he knew how
much Butler loved his daughter

Confronted by her father Aileen was now attempting to stare defiantly
to look reproachful but Butlers deep gray eyes beneath their shaggy
brows revealed such a weight of weariness and despair as even she in
her anger and defiance could not openly flaunt It was all too sad

I never expected to find you in a place like this daughter he said
I should have thought you would have thought better of yourself His
voice choked and he stopped

I know who youre here with he continued shaking his head sadly
The dog Ill get him yet Ive had men watchin you all the time Oh
the shame of this day The shame of this day Youll be comin home with
me now

Thats just it father began Aileen Youve had men watching me
I should have thought She stopped because he put up his hand in a
strange agonized and yet dominating way

None of that none of that he said glowering under his strange sad
gray brows I cant stand it Dont tempt me Were not out of this
place yet Hes not Youll come home with me now

Aileen understood It was Cowperwood he was referring to That
frightened her

Im ready she replied nervously

The old man led the way brokenheartedly He felt he would never live to
forget the agony of this hour





Chapter XXXVII


In spite of Butlers rage and his determination to do many things to the
financier if he could he was so wrought up and shocked by the attitude
of Aileen that he could scarcely believe he was the same man he had
been twentyfour hours before She was so nonchalant so defiant He
had expected to see her wilt completely when confronted with her guilt
Instead he found to his despair after they were once safely out of
the house that he had aroused a fighting quality in the girl which was
not incomparable to his own She had some of his own and Owens grit
She sat beside him in the little runaboutnot his ownin which he was
driving her home her face coloring and blanching by turns as different
waves of thought swept over her determined to stand her ground now that
her father had so plainly trapped her to declare for Cowperwood and her
love and her position in general What did she care she asked
herself what her father thought now She was in this thing She loved
Cowperwood she was permanently disgraced in her fathers eyes What
difference could it all make now He had fallen so low in his parental
feeling as to spy on her and expose her before other menstrangers
detectives Cowperwood What real affection could she have for him after
this He had made a mistake according to her He had done a foolish and
a contemptible thing which was not warranted however bad her actions
might have been What could he hope to accomplish by rushing in on her
in this way and ripping the veil from her very soul before these other
menthese crude detectives Oh the agony of that walk from the
bedroom to the receptionroom She would never forgive her father for
thisnever never never He had now killed her love for himthat was
what she felt It was to be a battle royal between them from now on
As they rodein complete silence for a whileher hands clasped
and unclasped defiantly her nails cutting her palms and her mouth
hardened

It is an open question whether raw opposition ever accomplishes anything
of value in this world It seems so inherent in this mortal scheme of
things that it appears to have a vast validity It is more than likely
that we owe this spectacle called life to it and that this can be
demonstrated scientifically but when that is said and done what is the
value What is the value of the spectacle And what the value of a scene
such as this enacted between Aileen and her father

The old man saw nothing for it as they rode on save a grim contest
between them which could end in what What could he do with her They
were riding away fresh from this awful catastrophe and she was not
saying a word She had even asked him why he had come there How was he
to subdue her when the very act of trapping her had failed to do
so His ruse while so successful materially had failed so utterly
spiritually They reached the house and Aileen got out The old man
too nonplussed to wish to go further at this time drove back to his
office He then went out and walkeda peculiar thing for him to do he
had done nothing like that in years and yearswalking to think Coming
to an open Catholic church he went in and prayed for enlightenment
the growing dusk of the interior the single everlasting lamp before the
repository of the chalice and the high white altar set with candles
soothing his troubled feelings

He came out of the church after a time and returned home Aileen did not
appear at dinner and he could not eat He went into his private room
and shut the doorthinking thinking thinking The dreadful spectacle
of Aileen in a house of ill repute burned in his brain To think that
Cowperwood should have taken her to such a placehis Aileen his
and his wifes pet In spite of his prayers his uncertainty her
opposition the puzzling nature of the situation she must be got out
of this She must go away for a while give the man up and then the law
should run its course with him In all likelihood Cowperwood would go to
the penitentiaryif ever a man richly deserved to go it was he Butler
would see that no stone was left unturned He would make it a personal
issue if necessary All he had to do was to let it be known in judicial
circles that he wanted it so He could not suborn a jury that would
be criminal but he could see that the case was properly and forcefully
presented and if Cowperwood were convicted Heaven help him The appeal
of his financial friends would not save him The judges of the lower and
superior courts knew on which side their bread was buttered They would
strain a point in favor of the highest political opinion of the day and
he certainly could influence that Aileen meanwhile was contemplating
the peculiar nature of her situation In spite of their silence on the
way home she knew that a conversation was coming with her father
It had to be He would want her to go somewhere Most likely he would
revive the European trip in some formshe now suspected the invitation
of Mrs Mollenhauer as a trick and she had to decide whether she would
go Would she leave Cowperwood just when he was about to be tried She
was determined she would not She wanted to see what was going to happen
to him She would leave home firstrun to some relative some friend
some stranger if necessary and ask to be taken in She had some
moneya little Her father had always been very liberal with her She
could take a few clothes and disappear They would be glad enough
to send for her after she had been gone awhile Her mother would be
frantic Norah and Callum and Owen would be beside themselves with
wonder and worry her fathershe could see him Maybe that would bring
him to his senses In spite of all her emotional vagaries she was the
pride and interest of this home and she knew it

It was in this direction that her mind was running when her father a
few days after the dreadful exposure in the Sixth Street house sent for
her to come to him in his room He had come home from his office very
early in the afternoon hoping to find Aileen there in order that he
might have a private interview with her and by good luck found her in
She had had no desire to go out into the world these last few daysshe
was too expectant of trouble to come She had just written Cowperwood
asking for a rendezvous out on the Wissahickon the following afternoon
in spite of the detectives She must see him Her father she said had
done nothing but she was sure he would attempt to do something She
wanted to talk to Cowperwood about that

Ive been thinkin about ye Aileen and what ought to be done in this
case began her father without preliminaries of any kind once they were
in his office room in the house together Youre on the road to ruin
if any one ever was I tremble when I think of your immortal soul I
want to do somethin for ye my child before its too late Ive been
reproachin myself for the last month and more thinkin perhaps it
was somethin I had done or maybe had failed to do aither me or your
mother that has brought ye to the place where ye are today Needless
to say its on me conscience me child Its a heartbroken man youre
lookin at this day Ill never be able to hold me head up again Oh
the shamethe shame That I should have lived to see it

But father protested Aileen who was a little distraught at the
thought of having to listen to a long preachment which would relate to
her duty to God and the Church and her family and her mother and him
She realized that all these were important in their way but Cowperwood
and his point of view had given her another outlook on life They had
discussed this matter of familiesparents children husbands wives
brothers sistersfrom almost every point of view Cowperwoods
laissezfaire attitude had permeated and colored her mind completely
She saw things through his cold direct I satisfy myself attitude He
was sorry for all the little differences of personality that sprang
up between people causing quarrels bickerings oppositions and
separation but they could not be helped People outgrew each other
Their points of view altered at varying ratioshence changes
Moralsthose who had them had them those who hadnt hadnt There was
no explaining As for him he saw nothing wrong in the sex relationship
Between those who were mutually compatible it was innocent and
delicious Aileen in his arms unmarried but loved by him and he by
her was as good and pure as any living womana great deal purer than
most One found oneself in a given social order theory or scheme
of things For purposes of social success in order not to offend to
smooth ones path make things easy avoid useless criticism and the
like it was necessary to create an outward seemingostensibly conform
Beyond that it was not necessary to do anything Never fail never get
caught If you did fight your way out silently and say nothing That
was what he was doing in connection with his present financial troubles
that was what he had been ready to do the other day when they were
caught It was something of all this that was coloring Aileens mood as
she listened at present

But father she protested I love Mr Cowperwood Its almost the
same as if I were married to him He will marry me some day when he gets
a divorce from Mrs Cowperwood You dont understand how it is Hes
very fond of me and I love him He needs me

Butler looked at her with strange nonunderstanding eyes Divorce
did you say he began thinking of the Catholic Church and its dogma in
regard to that Hell divorce his own wife and childrenand for you
will he He needs you does he he added sarcastically What about
his wife and children I dont suppose they need him do they What talk
have ye

Aileen flung her head back defiantly Its true nevertheless she
reiterated You just dont understand

Butler could scarcely believe his ears He had never heard such talk
before in his life from any one It amazed and shocked him He was
quite aware of all the subtleties of politics and business but these
of romance were too much for him He knew nothing about them To think
a daughter of his should be talking like this and she a Catholic He
could not understand where she got such notions unless it was from the
Machiavellian corrupting brain of Cowperwood himself

How long have ye had these notions my child he suddenly asked
calmly and soberly Where did ye get them Ye certainly never heard
anything like that in this house I warrant Ye talk as though ye had
gone out of yer mind

Oh dont talk nonsense father flared Aileen angrily thinking how
hopeless it was to talk to her father about such things anyhow Im
not a child any more Im twentyfour years of age You just dont
understand Mr Cowperwood doesnt like his wife Hes going to get a
divorce when he can and will marry me I love him and he loves me and
thats all there is to it

Is it though asked Butler grimly determined by hook or by crook to
bring this girl to her senses Yell be takin no thought of his
wife and children then The fact that hes goin to jail besides
is nawthin to ye I suppose Yed love him just as much in convict
stripes I supposemore maybe The old man was at his best humanly
speaking when he was a little sarcastic Yell have him that way
likely if at all

Aileen blazed at once to a furious heat Yes I know she sneered
Thats what you would like I know what youve been doing Frank does
too Youre trying to railroad him to prison for something he didnt
doand all on account of me Oh I know But you wont hurt him You
cant Hes bigger and finer than you think he is and you wont hurt
him in the long run Hell get out again You want to punish him on my
account but he doesnt care Ill marry him anyhow I love him and
Ill wait for him and marry him and you can do what you please So
there

Yell marry him will you asked Butler nonplussed and further
astounded So yell wait for him and marry him Yell take him away
from his wife and children where if he were half a man hed be
stayin this minute instead of gallivantin around with you And marry
him Yed disgrace your father and yer mother and yer family Yell
stand here and say this to me I that have raised ye cared for ye and
made somethin of ye Where would you be if it werent for me and your
poor hardworkin mother schemin and plannin for you year in and
year out Yere smarter than I am I suppose Ye know more about the
world than I do or any one else that might want to say anythin to ye
Ive raised ye to be a fine lady and this is what I get Talk about me
not bein able to understand and ye lovin a convicttobe a robber
an embezzler a bankrupt a lyin thavin

Father exclaimed Aileen determinedly Ill not listen to you
talking that way Hes not any of the things that you say Ill not stay
here She moved toward the door but Butler jumped up now and stopped
her His face for the moment was flushed and swollen with anger

But Im not through with him yet he went on ignoring her desire to
leave and addressing her directconfident now that she was as capable
as another of understanding him Ill get him as sure as I have a name
Theres law in this land and Ill have it on him Ill show him whether
hell come sneakin into dacent homes and robbin parents of their
children

He paused after a time for want of breath and Aileen stared her face
tense and white Her father could be so ridiculous He was contrasted
with Cowperwood and his views so oldfashioned To think he could be
talking of some one coming into their home and stealing her away from
him when she had been so willing to go What silliness And yet why
argue What good could be accomplished arguing with him here in this
way And so for the moment she said nothing moremerely looked But
Butler was by no means done His mood was too stormy even though he was
doing his best now to subdue himself

Its too bad daughter he resumed quietly once he was satisfied that
she was going to have little if anything to say Im lettin my anger
get the best of me It wasnt that I intended talkin to ye about when
I ast ye to come in Its somethin else I have on me mind I was
thinkin perhaps yed like to go to Europe for the time bein to study
music Yere not quite yourself just at present Yere needin a rest
It would be good for ye to go away for a while Ye could have a nice
time over there Norah could go along with ye if you would and
Sister Constantia that taught you Ye wouldnt object to havin her I
suppose

At the mention of this idea of a trip of Europe again with Sister
Constantia and music thrown in to give it a slightly new form Aileen
bridled and yet halfsmiled to herself now It was so ridiculousso
tactless really for her father to bring up this now and especially
after denouncing Cowperwood and her and threatening all the things he
had Had he no diplomacy at all where she was concerned It was really
too funny But she restrained herself here again because she felt as
well as saw that argument of this kind was all futile now

I wish you wouldnt talk about that father she began having
softened under his explanation I dont want to go to Europe now I
dont want to leave Philadelphia I know you want me to go but I dont
want to think of going now I cant

Butlers brow darkened again What was the use of all this opposition on
her part Did she really imagine that she was going to master himher
father and in connection with such an issue as this How impossible
But tempering his voice as much as possible he went on quite softly
in fact But it would be so fine for ye Aileen Ye surely cant expect
to stay here after He paused for he was going to say what has
happened He knew she was very sensitive on that point His own conduct
in hunting her down had been such a breach of fatherly courtesy that he
knew she felt resentful and in a way properly so Still what could be
greater than her own crime After he concluded ye have made such
a mistake ye surely wouldnt want to stay here Ye wont be wantin to
keep up thatcommittin a mortal sin Its against the laws of God and
man

He did so hope the thought of sin would come to Aileenthe enormity of
her crime from a spiritual point of viewbut Aileen did not see it at
all

You dont understand me father she exclaimed hopelessly toward the
end You cant I have one idea and you have another But I dont seem
to be able to make you understand now The fact is if you want to know
it I dont believe in the Catholic Church any more so there

The moment Aileen had said this she wished she had not It was a slip of
the tongue Butlers face took on an inexpressibly sad despairing look

Ye dont believe in the Church he asked

No not exactlynot like you do

He shook his head

The harm that has come to yer soul he replied Its plain to me
daughter that somethin terrible has happened to ye This man has
ruined ye body and soul Somethin must be done I dont want to be
hard on ye but ye must leave Philadelphy Ye cant stay here I cant
permit ye Ye can go to Europe or ye can go to yer aunts in New
Orleans but ye must go somewhere I cant have ye stayin hereits
too dangerous Its sure to be comin out The papersll be havin it
next Yere young yet Yer life is before you I tremble for yer soul
but so long as yere young and alive ye may come to yer senses Its me
duty to be hard Its my obligation to you and the Church Ye must quit
this life Ye must lave this man Ye must never see him any more I
cant permit ye Hes no good He has no intintion of marrying ye and
it would be a crime against God and man if he did No no Never that
The mans a bankrupt a scoundrel a thafe If ye had him yed soon be
the unhappiest woman in the world He wouldnt be faithful to ye No
he couldnt Hes not that kind He paused sick to the depths of his
soul Ye must go away I say it once and for all I mane it kindly but
I want it I have yer best interests at heart I love ye but ye must
Im sorry to see ye goId rather have ye here No one will be sorrier
but ye must Ye must make it all seem natcheral and ordinary to yer
mother but ye must godye hear Ye must

He paused looking sadly but firmly at Aileen under his shaggy eyebrows
She knew he meant this It was his most solemn his most religious
expression But she did not answer She could not What was the use
Only she was not going She knew thatand so she stood there white and
tense

Now get all the clothes ye want went on Butler by no means grasping
her true mood Fix yourself up in any way you plase Say where ye want
to go but get ready

But I wont father finally replied Aileen equally solemnly equally
determinedly I wont go I wont leave Philadelphia

Ye dont mane to say ye will deliberately disobey me when Im asking ye
to do somethin thats intended for yer own good will ye daughter

Yes I will replied Aileen determinedly I wont go Im sorry but
I wont

Ye really mane that do ye asked Butler sadly but grimly

Yes I do replied Aileen grimly in return

Then Ill have to see what I can do daughter replied the old man
Yere still my daughter whatever ye are and Ill not see ye come to
wreck and ruin for want of doin what I know to be my solemn duty Ill
give ye a few more days to think this over but go ye must Theres an
end of that There are laws in this land still There are things that
can be done to those who wont obey the law I found ye this timemuch
as it hurt me to do it Ill find ye again if ye try to disobey me Ye
must change yer ways I cant have ye goin on as ye are Ye understand
now Its the last word Give this man up and ye can have anything ye
choose Yere my girlIll do everything I can in this world to make
ye happy Why why shouldnt I What else have I to live for but me
children Its ye and the rest of them that Ive been workin and
plannin for all these years Come now be a good girl Ye love your old
father dont ye Why I rocked ye in my arms as a baby Aileen Ive
watched over ye when ye were not bigger than what would rest in me two
fists here Ive been a good father to yeye cant deny that Look at
the other girls youve seen Have any of them had more nor what ye have
had Ye wont go against me in this Im sure ye wont Ye cant Ye
love me too muchsurely ye dodont ye His voice weakened His eyes
almost filled

He paused and put a big brown horny hand on Aileens arm She had
listened to his plea not unmovedreally more or less softenedbecause
of the hopelessness of it She could not give up Cowperwood Her father
just did not understand He did not know what love was Unquestionably
he had never loved as she had

She stood quite silent while Butler appealed to her

Id like to father she said at last and softly tenderly Really
I would I do love you Yes I do I want to please you but I cant in
thisI cant I love Frank Cowperwood You dont understandreally you
dont

At the repetition of Cowperwoods name Butlers mouth hardened He could
see that she was infatuatedthat his carefully calculated plea had
failed So he must think of some other way

Very well then he said at last and sadly oh so sadly as Aileen
turned away Have it yer own way if ye will Ye must go though
willynilly It cant be any other way I wish to God it could

Aileen went out very solemn and Butler went over to his desk and sat
down Such a situation he said to himself Such a complication





Chapter XXXVIII


The situation which confronted Aileen was really a trying one A girl of
less innate courage and determination would have weakened and yielded
For in spite of her various social connections and acquaintances the
people to whom Aileen could run in an emergency of the present kind were
not numerous She could scarcely think of any one who would be likely
to take her in for any lengthy period without question There were a
number of young women of her own age married and unmarried who were
very friendly to her but there were few with whom she was really
intimate The only person who stood out in her mind as having any real
possibility of refuge for a period was a certain Mary Calligan better
known as Mamie among her friends who had attended school with Aileen
in former years and was now a teacher in one of the local schools

The Calligan family consisted of Mrs Katharine Calligan the mother
a dressmaker by profession and a widowher husband a housemover by
trade having been killed by a falling wall some ten years beforeand
Mamie her twentythreeyearold daughter They lived in a small
twostory brick house in Cherry Street near Fifteenth Mrs Calligan
was not a very good dressmaker not good enough at least for the
Butler family to patronize in their present exalted state Aileen
went there occasionally for gingham housedresses underwear pretty
dressinggowns and alterations on some of her more important clothing
which was made by a very superior modiste in Chestnut Street She
visited the house largely because she had gone to school with Mamie
at St Agathas when the outlook of the Calligan family was much more
promising Mamie was earning forty dollars a month as the teacher of a
sixthgrade room in one of the nearby public schools and Mrs Calligan
averaged on the whole about two dollars a daysometimes not so much
The house they occupied was their own free and clear and the furniture
which it contained suggested the size of their joint income which was
somewhere near eighty dollars a month

Mamie Calligan was not goodlooking not nearly as goodlooking as her
mother had been before her Mrs Calligan was still plump bright and
cheerful at fifty with a fund of good humor Mamie was somewhat duller
mentally and emotionally She was seriousmindedmade so perhaps as
much by circumstances as by anything else for she was not at all vivid
and had little sex magnetism Yet she was kindly honest earnest
a good Catholic and possessed of that strangely excessive ingrowing
virtue which shuts so many people off from the worlda sense of duty
To Mamie Calligan duty a routine conformity to such theories and
precepts as she had heard and worked by since her childhood was the
allimportant thing her principal source of comfort and relief her
props in a queer and uncertain world being her duty to her Church her
duty to her school her duty to her mother her duty to her friends
etc Her mother often wished for Mamies sake that she was less dutiful
and more charming physically so that the men would like her

In spite of the fact that her mother was a dressmaker Mamies clothes
never looked smart or attractiveshe would have felt out of keeping
with herself if they had Her shoes were rather large and illfitting
her skirt hung in lifeless lines from her hips to her feet of good
material but seemingly bad design At that time the colored jersey
socalled was just coming into popular wear and being closefitting
looked well on those of good form Alas for Mamie Calligan The mode of
the time compelled her to wear one but she had neither the arms nor the
chest development which made this garment admirable Her hat by choice
was usually a pancake affair with a long single feather which somehow
never seemed to be in exactly the right position either to her hair
or her face At most times she looked a little weary but she was not
physically weary so much as she was bored Her life held so little of
real charm and Aileen Butler was unquestionably the most significant
element of romance in it

Mamies mothers very pleasant social disposition the fact that they
had a very cleanly if poor little home that she could entertain
them by playing on their piano and that Mrs Calligan took an adoring
interest in the work she did for her made up the sum and substance
of the attraction of the Calligan home for Aileen She went there
occasionally as a relief from other things and because Mamie Calligan
had a compatible and very understanding interest in literature
Curiously the books Aileen liked she likedJane Eyre Kenelm
Chillingly Tricotrin and A Bow of Orange Ribbon Mamie occasionally
recommended to Aileen some latest effusion of this character and
Aileen finding her judgment good was constrained to admire her

In this crisis it was to the home of the Calligans that Aileen turned in
thought If her father really was not nice to her and she had to leave
home for a time she could go to the Calligans They would receive her
and say nothing They were not sufficiently well known to the other
members of the Butler family to have the latter suspect that she had
gone there She might readily disappear into the privacy of Cherry
Street and not be seen or heard of for weeks It is an interesting
fact to contemplate that the Calligans like the various members of the
Butler family never suspected Aileen of the least tendency toward a
wayward existence Hence her flight from her own family if it ever
came would be laid more to the door of a temperamental pettishness than
anything else

On the other hand in so far as the Butler family as a unit was
concerned it needed Aileen more than she needed it It needed the light
of her countenance to keep it appropriately cheerful and if she went
away there would be a distinct gulf that would not soon be overcome

Butler senior for instance had seen his little daughter grow into
radiantly beautiful womanhood He had seen her go to school and convent
and learn to play the pianoto him a great accomplishment Also he had
seen her manner change and become very showy and her knowledge of life
broaden apparently and become to him at least impressive Her smart
dogmatic views about most things were to him at least well worth
listening to She knew more about books and art than Owen or Callum
and her sense of social manners was perfect When she came to the
tablebreakfast luncheon or dinnershe was to him always a charming
object to see He had produced Aileenhe congratulated himself He had
furnished her the money to be so fine He would continue to do so No
secondrate upstart of a man should be allowed to ruin her life He
proposed to take care of her alwaysto leave her so much money in a
legally involved way that a failure of a husband could not possibly
affect her Youre the charming lady this evenin Im thinkin was
one of his pet remarks and also My but were that fine At table
almost invariably she sat beside him and looked out for him That was
what he wanted He had put her there beside him at his meals years
before when she was a child

Her mother too was inordinately fond of her and Callum and Owen
appropriately brotherly So Aileen had thus far at least paid back with
beauty and interest quite as much as she received and all the family
felt it to be so When she was away for a day or two the house seemed
glumthe meals less appetizing When she returned all were happy and
gay again

Aileen understood this clearly enough in a way Now when it came to
thinking of leaving and shifting for herself in order to avoid a trip
which she did not care to be forced into her courage was based largely
on this keen sense of her own significance to the family She thought
over what her father had said and decided she must act at once She
dressed for the street the next morning after her father had gone and
decided to step in at the Calligans about noon when Mamie would be at
home for luncheon Then she would take up the matter casually If
they had no objection she would go there She sometimes wondered why
Cowperwood did not suggest in his great stress that they leave for
some parts unknown but she also felt that he must know best what he
could do His increasing troubles depressed her

Mrs Calligan was alone when she arrived and was delighted to see her
After exchanging the gossip of the day and not knowing quite how to
proceed in connection with the errand which had brought her she went to
the piano and played a melancholy air

Sure its lovely the way you play Aileen observed Mrs Calligan who
was unduly sentimental herself I love to hear you I wish youd come
oftener to see us Youre so rarely here nowadays

Oh Ive been so busy Mrs Calligan replied Aileen Ive had so
much to do this fall I just couldnt They wanted me to go to Europe
but I didnt care to Oh dear she sighed and in her playing swept
off with a movement of sad romantic significance The door opened and
Mamie came in Her commonplace face brightened at the sight of Aileen

Well Aileen Butler she exclaimed Where did you come from Where
have you been keeping yourself so long

Aileen rose to exchange kisses Oh Ive been very busy Mamie Ive
just been telling your mother How are you anyway How are you getting
along in your work

Mamie recounted at once some school difficulties which were puzzling
herthe growing size of classes and the amount of work expected While
Mrs Calligan was setting the table Mamie went to her room and Aileen
followed her

As she stood before her mirror arranging her hair Aileen looked at her
meditatively

Whats the matter with you Aileen today Mamie asked You look
so She stopped to give her a second glance

How do I look asked Aileen

Well as if you were uncertain or troubled about something I never saw
you look that way before Whats the matter

Oh nothing replied Aileen I was just thinking She went to one of
the windows which looked into the little yard meditating on whether she
could endure living here for any length of time The house was so small
the furnishings so very simple

There is something the matter with you today Aileen observed Mamie
coming over to her and looking in her face Youre not like yourself at
all

Ive got something on my mind replied Aileensomething thats
worrying me I dont know just what to dothats whats the matter

Well whatever can it be commented Mamie I never saw you act this
way before Cant you tell me What is it

No I dont think I cannot now anyhow Aileen paused Do you
suppose your mother would object she asked suddenly if I came here
and stayed a little while I want to get away from home for a time for a
certain reason

Why Aileen Butler how you talk exclaimed her friend Object You
know shed be delighted and so would I Oh dearcan you come But
what makes you want to leave home

Thats just what I cant tell younot now anyhow Not you so much
but your mother You know Im afraid of what shed think replied
Aileen But you mustnt ask me yet anyhow I want to think Oh dear
But I want to come if youll let me Will you speak to your mother or
shall I

Why I will said Mamie struck with wonder at this remarkable
development but its silly to do it I know what shell say before I
tell her and so do you You can just bring your things and come Thats
all Shed never say anything or ask anything either and you know
thatif you didnt want her to Mamie was all agog and aglow at the
idea She wanted the companionship of Aileen so much

Aileen looked at her solemnly and understood well enough why she was
so enthusiasticboth she and her mother Both wanted her presence to
brighten their world But neither of you must tell anybody that Im
here do you hear I dont want any one to knowparticularly no one of
my family Ive a reason and a good one but I cant tell you what it
isnot now anyhow Youll promise not to tell any one

Oh of course replied Mamie eagerly But youre not going to run
away for good are you Aileen she concluded curiously and gravely

Oh I dont know I dont know what Ill do yet I only know that I
want to get away for a while just nowthats all She paused while
Mamie stood before her agape

Well of all things replied her friend Wonders never cease do
they Aileen But it will be so lovely to have you here Mama will be
so pleased Of course we wont tell anybody if you dont want us to
Hardly any one ever comes here and if they do you neednt see them
You could have this big room next to me Oh wouldnt that be nice
Im perfectly delighted The young schoolteachers spirits rose to a
decided height Come on why not tell mama right now

Aileen hesitated because even now she was not positive whether she
should do this but finally they went down the stairs together Aileen
lingering behind a little as they neared the bottom Mamie burst in upon
her mother with Oh mama isnt it lovely Aileens coming to stay
with us for a while She doesnt want any one to know and shes coming
right away Mrs Calligan who was holding a sugarbowl in her hand
turned to survey her with a surprised but smiling face She was
immediately curious as to why Aileen should want to comewhy leave
home On the other hand her feeling for Aileen was so deep that she
was greatly and joyously intrigued by the idea And why not Was not the
celebrated Edward Butlers daughter a woman grown capable of regulating
her own affairs and welcome of course as the honored member of so
important a family It was very flattering to the Calligans to think
that she would want to come under any circumstances

I dont see how your parents can let you go Aileen but youre
certainly welcome here as long as you want to stay and thats forever
if you want to And Mrs Calligan beamed on her welcomingly The idea
of Aileen Butler asking to be permitted to come here And the hearty
comprehending manner in which she said this and Mamies enthusiasm
caused Aileen to breathe a sigh of relief The matter of the expense of
her presence to the Calligans came into her mind

I want to pay you of course she said to Mrs Calligan if I come

The very idea Aileen Butler exclaimed Mamie Youll do nothing of
the sort Youll come here and live with me as my guest

No I wont If I cant pay I wont come replied Aileen Youll have
to let me do that She knew that the Calligans could not afford to keep
her

Well well not talk about that now anyhow replied Mrs Calligan
You can come when you like and stay as long as you like Reach me
some clean napkins Mamie Aileen remained for luncheon and left soon
afterward to keep her suggested appointment with Cowperwood feeling
satisfied that her main problem had been solved Now her way was
clear She could come here if she wanted to It was simply a matter of
collecting a few necessary things or coming without bringing anything
Perhaps Frank would have something to suggest

In the meantime Cowperwood made no effort to communicate with Aileen
since the unfortunate discovery of their meeting place but had awaited
a letter from her which was not long in coming And as usual it was a
long optimistic affectionate and defiant screed in which she related
all that had occurred to her and her present plan of leaving home This
last puzzled and troubled him not a little

Aileen in the bosom of her family smart and wellcared for was one
thing Aileen out in the world dependent on him was another He had
never imagined that she would be compelled to leave before he was
prepared to take her and if she did now it might stir up complications
which would be anything but pleasant to contemplate Still he was fond
of her very and would do anything to make her happy He could support
her in a very respectable way even now if he did not eventually go to
prison and even there he might manage to make some shift for her It
would be so much better though if he could persuade her to remain at
home until he knew exactly what his fate was to be He never doubted but
that some day whatever happened within a reasonable length of time he
would be rid of all these complications and welltodo again in which
case if he could get a divorce he wanted to marry Aileen If not he
would take her with him anyhow and from this point of view it might
be just as well as if she broke away from her family now But from the
point of view of present complicationsthe search Butler would makeit
might be dangerous He might even publicly charge him with abduction He
therefore decided to persuade Aileen to stay at home drop meetings and
communications for the time being and even go abroad He would be all
right until she came back and so would shecommon sense ought to rule
in this case

With all this in mind he set out to keep the appointment she suggested
in her letter nevertheless feeling it a little dangerous to do so

Are you sure he asked after he had listened to her description of
the Calligan homestead that you would like it there It sounds rather
poor to me

Yes but I like them so much replied Aileen

And youre sure they wont tell on you

Oh no never never

Very well he concluded You know what youre doing I dont want
to advise you against your will If I were you though Id take your
fathers advice and go away for a while Hell get over this then and
Ill still be here I can write you occasionally and you can write me

The moment Cowperwood said this Aileens brow clouded Her love for him
was so great that there was something like a knife thrust in the merest
hint at an extended separation Her Frank here and in troubleon trial
maybe and she away Never What could he mean by suggesting such a
thing Could it be that he didnt care for her as much as she did for
him Did he really love her she asked herself Was he going to desert
her just when she was going to do the thing which would bring them
nearer together Her eyes clouded for she was terribly hurt

Why how you talk she exclaimed You know I wont leave Philadelphia
now You certainly dont expect me to leave you

Cowperwood saw it all very clearly He was too shrewd not to He was
immensely fond of her Good heaven he thought he would not hurt her
feelings for the world

Honey he said quickly when he saw her eyes you dont understand
I want you to do what you want to do Youve planned this out in order
to be with me so now you do it Dont think any more about me or
anything Ive said I was merely thinking that it might make matters
worse for both of us but I dont believe it will You think your father
loves you so much that after youre gone hell change his mind Very
good go But we must be very careful sweetyou and Ireally we must
This thing is getting serious If you should go and your father should
charge me with abductiontake the public into his confidence and tell
all about this it would be serious for both of usas much for you as
for me for Id be convicted sure then just on that account if nothing
else And then what Youd better not try to see me often for the
presentnot any oftener than we can possibly help If we had used
common sense and stopped when your father got that letter this wouldnt
have happened But now that it has happened we must be as wise as we
can dont you see So think it over and do what you think best and
then write me and whatever you do will be all right with medo you
hear He drew her to him and kissed her You havent any money have
you he concluded wisely

Aileen deeply moved by all he had just said was none the less
convinced once she had meditated on it a moment that her course was
best Her father loved her too much He would not do anything to hurt
her publicly and so he would not attack Cowperwood through her openly
More than likely as she now explained to Frank he would plead with her
to come back And he listening was compelled to yield Why argue She
would not leave him anyhow

He went down in his pocket for the first time since he had known Aileen
and produced a layer of bills Heres two hundred dollars sweet he
said until I see or hear from you Ill see that you have whatever
you need and now dont think that I dont love you You know I do Im
crazy about you

Aileen protested that she did not need so muchthat she did not really
need anyshe had some at home but he put that aside He knew that she
must have money

Dont talk honey he said I know what you need She had been
so used to receiving money from her father and mother in comfortable
amounts from time to time that she thought nothing of it Frank loved
her so much that it made everything right between them She softened
in her mood and they discussed the matter of letters reaching the
conclusion that a private messenger would be safest When finally they
parted Aileen from being sunk in the depths by his uncertain attitude
was now once more on the heights She decided that he did love her and
went away smiling She had her Frank to fall back onshe would teach
her father Cowperwood shook his head following her with his eyes She
represented an additional burden but give her up he certainly could
not Tear the veil from this illusion of affection and make her feel so
wretched when he cared for her so much No There was really nothing for
him to do but what he had done After all he reflected it might not
work out so badly Any detective work that Butler might choose to do
would prove that she had not run to him If at any moment it became
necessary to bring common sense into play to save the situation from
a deadly climax he could have the Butlers secretly informed as to
Aileens whereabouts That would show he had little to do with it
and they could try to persuade Aileen to come home again Good might
resultone could not tell He would deal with the evils as they arose
He drove quickly back to his office and Aileen returned to her home
determined to put her plan into action Her father had given her some
little time in which to decidepossibly he would give her longerbut
she would not wait Having always had her wish granted in everything
she could not understand why she was not to have her way this time It
was about five oclock now She would wait until all the members of the
family were comfortably seated at the dinnertable which would be about
seven oclock and then slip out

On arriving home however she was greeted by an unexpected reason
for suspending action This was the presence of a certain Mr and Mrs
Steinmetzthe former a wellknown engineer who drew the plans for many
of the works which Butler undertook It was the day before Thanksgiving
and they were eager to have Aileen and Norah accompany them for
a fortnights stay at their new home in West Chestera structure
concerning the charm of which Aileen had heard much They were
exceedingly agreeable peoplecomparatively young and surrounded by a
coterie of interesting friends Aileen decided to delay her flight and
go Her father was most cordial The presence and invitation of the
Steinmetzes was as much a relief to him as it was to Aileen West
Chester being forty miles from Philadelphia it was unlikely that Aileen
would attempt to meet Cowperwood while there

She wrote Cowperwood of the changed condition and departed and he
breathed a sigh of relief fancying at the time that this storm had
permanently blown over





Chapter XXXIX


In the meanwhile the day of Cowperwoods trial was drawing near He was
under the impression that an attempt was going to be made to convict him
whether the facts warranted it or not He did not see any way out of
his dilemma however unless it was to abandon everything and leave
Philadelphia for good which was impossible The only way to guard his
future and retain his financial friends was to stand trial as quickly as
possible and trust them to assist him to his feet in the future in
case he failed He discussed the possibilities of an unfair trial with
Steger who did not seem to think that there was so much to that In the
first place a jury could not easily be suborned by any one In the next
place most judges were honest in spite of their political cleavage
and would go no further than party bias would lead them in their rulings
and opinions which was in the main not so far The particular judge
who was to sit in this case one Wilbur Payderson of the Court of
Quarter Sessions was a strict party nominee and as such beholden to
Mollenhauer Simpson and Butler but in so far as Steger had ever
heard he was an honest man

What I cant understand said Steger is why these fellows should be
so anxious to punish you unless it is for the effect on the State at
large The elections over I understand theres a movement on now to
get Stener out in case he is convicted which he will be They have to
try him He wont go up for more than a year or two or three and if
he does hell be pardoned out in half the time or less It would be the
same in your case if you were convicted They couldnt keep you in and
let him out But it will never get that fartake my word for it Well
win before a jury or well reverse the judgment of conviction before
the State Supreme Court certain Those five judges up there are not
going to sustain any such poppycock idea as this

Steger actually believed what he said and Cowperwood was pleased Thus
far the young lawyer had done excellently well in all of his cases
Still he did not like the idea of being hunted down by Butler It was a
serious matter and one of which Steger was totally unaware Cowperwood
could never quite forget that in listening to his lawyers optimistic
assurances

The actual beginning of the trial found almost all of the inhabitants
of this city of six hundred thousand keyed up None of the women of
Cowperwoods family were coming into court He had insisted that there
should be no family demonstration for the newspapers to comment upon
His father was coming for he might be needed as a witness Aileen
had written him the afternoon before saying she had returned from West
Chester and wishing him luck She was so anxious to know what was
to become of him that she could not stay away any longer and had
returnednot to go to the courtroom for he did not want her to do
that but to be as near as possible when his fate was decided adversely
or otherwise She wanted to run and congratulate him if he won or to
console with him if he lost She felt that her return would be likely to
precipitate a collision with her father but she could not help that

The position of Mrs Cowperwood was most anomalous She had to go
through the formality of seeming affectionate and tender even when she
knew that Frank did not want her to be He felt instinctively now that
she knew of Aileen He was merely awaiting the proper hour in which to
spread the whole matter before her She put her arms around him at the
door on the fateful morning in the somewhat formal manner into which
they had dropped these later years and for a moment even though she
was keenly aware of his difficulties she could not kiss him He did not
want to kiss her but he did not show it She did kiss him though and
added Oh I do hope things come out all right

You neednt worry about that I think Lillian he replied buoyantly
Ill be all right

He ran down the steps and walked out on Girard Avenue to his former car
line where he boarded a car He was thinking of Aileen and how keenly
she was feeling for him and what a mockery his married life now was
and whether he would face a sensible jury and so on and so forth If he
didntif he didntthis day was crucial

He stepped off the car at Third and Market and hurried to his office
Steger was already there Well Harper observed Cowperwood
courageously todays the day

The Court of Quarter Sessions Part I where this trial was to take
place was held in famous Independence Hall at Sixth and Chestnut
Streets which was at this time as it had been for all of a century
before the center of local executive and judicial life It was a low
twostory building of red brick with a white wooden central tower of
old Dutch and English derivation compounded of the square the circle
and the octagon The total structure consisted of a central portion and
two Tshaped wings lying to the right and left whose small ovaltopped
oldfashioned windows and doors were set with those manypaned sashes so
much admired by those who love what is known as Colonial architecture
Here and in an addition known as State House Row since torn down
which extended from the rear of the building toward Walnut Street
were located the offices of the mayor the chief of police the city
treasurer the chambers of council and all the other important and
executive offices of the city together with the four branches of
Quarter Sessions which sat to hear the growing docket of criminal
cases The mammoth city hall which was subsequently completed at Broad
and Market Streets was then building

An attempt had been made to improve the reasonably large courtrooms by
putting in them raised platforms of dark walnut surmounted by large
dark walnut desks behind which the judges sat but the attempt was not
very successful The desks juryboxes and railings generally were
made too large and so the general effect was one of disproportion A
creamcolored wall had been thought the appropriate thing to go with
black walnut furniture but time and dust had made the combination
dreary There were no pictures or ornaments of any kind save the
stalky overelaborated gasbrackets which stood on his honors desk
and the single swinging chandelier suspended from the center of the
ceiling Fat bailiffs and court officers concerned only in holding
their workless jobs did not add anything to the spirit of the scene
Two of them in the particular court in which this trial was held
contended hourly as to which should hand the judge a glass of water One
preceded his honor like a fat stuffy dusty majordomo to and from his
dressingroom His business was to call loudly when the latter entered
His honor the Court hats off Everybody please rise while a second
bailiff standing at the left of his honor when he was seated and
between the jurybox and the witnesschair recited in an absolutely
unintelligible way that beautiful and dignified statement of collective
societys obligation to the constituent units which begins Hear ye
hear ye hear ye and ends All those of you having just cause for
complaint draw near and ye shall be heard However you would have
thought it was of no import here Custom and indifference had allowed it
to sink to a mumble A third bailiff guarded the door of the juryroom
and in addition to these there were present a court clerksmall
pale candlewaxy with colorless milkandwater eyes and thin
porkfatcolored hair and beard who looked for all the world like
an Americanized and decidedly decrepit Chinese mandarinand a court
stenographer

Judge Wilbur Payderson a lean herring of a man who had sat in this
case originally as the examining judge when Cowperwood had been indicted
by the grand jury and who had bound him over for trial at this term
was a peculiarly interesting type of judge as judges go He was so
meager and thinblooded that he was arresting for those qualities alone
Technically he was learned in the law actually so far as life was
concerned absolutely unconscious of that subtle chemistry of things
that transcends all written law and makes for the spirit and beyond
that the inutility of all law as all wise judges know You could have
looked at his lean pedantic body his frizzled gray hair his fishy
bluegray eyes without any depth of speculation in them and his
nicely modeled but unimportant face and told him that he was without
imagination but he would not have believed youwould have fined
you for contempt of court By the careful garnering of all his little
opportunities the furbishing up of every meager advantage by listening
slavishly to the voice of party and following as nearly as he could the
behests of intrenched property he had reached his present state It was
not very far along at that His salary was only six thousand dollars
a year His little fame did not extend beyond the meager realm of local
lawyers and judges But the sight of his name quoted daily as being
about his duties or rendering such and such a decision was a great
satisfaction to him He thought it made him a significant figure in
the world Behold I am not as other men he often thought and this
comforted him He was very much flattered when a prominent case came to
his calendar and as he sat enthroned before the various litigants and
lawyers he felt as a rule very significant indeed Now and then some
subtlety of life would confuse his really limited intellect but in all
such cases there was the letter of the law He could hunt in the reports
to find out what really thinking men had decided Besides lawyers
everywhere are so subtle They put the rules of law favorable or
unfavorable under the judges thumb and nose Your honor in the
thirtysecond volume of the Revised Reports of Massachusetts page so
and so line so and so in Arundel versus Bannerman you will find
etc How often have you heard that in a court of law The reasoning
that is left to do in most cases is not much And the sanctity of the
law is raised like a great banner by which the pride of the incumbent is
strengthened

Payderson as Steger had indicated could scarcely be pointed to as an
unjust judge He was a party judgeRepublican in principle or rather
belief beholden to the dominant party councils for his personal
continuance in office and as such willing and anxious to do whatever he
considered that he reasonably could do to further the party welfare and
the private interests of his masters Most people never trouble to look
into the mechanics of the thing they call their conscience too closely
Where they do too often they lack the skill to disentangle the tangled
threads of ethics and morals Whatever the opinion of the time
is whatever the weight of great interests dictates that they
conscientiously believe Some one has since invented the phrase a
corporationminded judge There are many such

Payderson was one He fairly revered property and power To him Butler
and Mollenhauer and Simpson were great menreasonably sure to be right
always because they were so powerful This matter of Cowperwoods and
Steners defalcation he had long heard of He knew by associating with
one political light and another just what the situation was The
party as the leaders saw it had been put in a very bad position by
Cowperwoods subtlety He had led Stener astraymore than an ordinary
city treasurer should have been led astrayand although Stener was
primarily guilty as the original mover in the scheme Cowperwood was
more so for having led him imaginatively to such disastrous lengths
Besides the party needed a scapegoatthat was enough for Payderson
in the first place Of course after the election had been won and it
appeared that the party had not suffered so much he did not understand
quite why it was that Cowperwood was still so carefully included in the
Proceedings but he had faith to believe that the leaders had some just
grounds for not letting him off From one source and another he learned
that Butler had some private grudge against Cowperwood What it was no
one seemed to know exactly The general impression was that Cowperwood
had led Butler into some unwholesome financial transactions Anyhow it
was generally understood that for the good of the party and in order to
teach a wholesome lesson to dangerous subordinatesit had been decided
to allow these several indictments to take their course Cowperwood was
to be punished quite as severely as Stener for the moral effect on the
community Stener was to be sentenced the maximum sentence for his crime
in order that the party and the courts should appear properly righteous
Beyond that he was to be left to the mercy of the governor who could
ease things up for him if he chose and if the leaders wished In the
silly mind of the general public the various judges of Quarter Sessions
like girls incarcerated in boardingschools were supposed in their
serene aloofness from life not to know what was going on in the
subterranean realm of politics but they knew well enough and
knowing particularly well from whence came their continued position and
authority they were duly grateful





Chapter XL


When Cowperwood came into the crowded courtroom with his father
and Steger quite fresh and jaunty looking the part of the shrewd
financier the man of affairs every one stared It was really too
much to expect most of them thought that a man like this would be
convicted He was no doubt guilty but also no doubt he had ways
and means of evading the law His lawyer Harper Steger looked very
shrewd and canny to them It was very cold and both men wore long
dark bluishgray overcoats cut in the latest mode Cowperwood was
given to small boutonnieres in fair weather but today he wore none
His tie however was of heavy impressive silk of lavender hue
set with a large clear green emerald He wore only the thinnest of
watchchains and no other ornament of any kind He always looked jaunty
and yet reserved goodnatured and yet capable and selfsufficient
Never had he looked more so than he did today

He at once took in the nature of the scene which had a peculiar
interest for him Before him was the as yet empty judges rostrum and
at its right the empty jurybox between which and to the judges left
as he sat facing the audience stood the witnesschair where he must
presently sit and testify Behind it already awaiting the arrival of
the court stood a fat bailiff one John Sparkheaver whose business it
was to present the aged greasy Bible to be touched by the witnesses in
making oath and to say Step this way when the testimony was over
There were other bailiffsone at the gate giving into the railed space
before the judges desk where prisoners were arraigned lawyers sat
or pleaded the defendant had a chair and so on another in the aisle
leading to the juryroom and still another guarding the door by which
the public entered Cowperwood surveyed Stener who was one of the
witnesses and who now in his helpless fright over his own fate was
without malice toward any one He had really never borne any He wished
if anything now that he had followed Cowperwoods advice seeing where
he now was though he still had faith that Mollenhauer and the political
powers represented by him would do something for him with the governor
once he was sentenced He was very pale and comparatively thin Already
he had lost that ruddy bulk which had been added during the days of
his prosperity He wore a new gray suit and a brown tie and was
cleanshaven When his eye caught Cowperwoods steady beam it faltered
and drooped He rubbed his ear foolishly Cowperwood nodded

You know he said to Steger I feel sorry for George Hes such a
fool Still I did all I could

Cowperwood also watched Mrs Stener out of the tail of his eyean
undersized peaked and sallow little woman whose clothes fitted her
abominably It was just like Stener to marry a woman like that he
thought The scrubby matches of the socially unelect or unfit always
interested though they did not always amuse him Mrs Stener had no
affection for Cowperwood of course looking on him as she did as the
unscrupulous cause of her husbands downfall They were now quite poor
again about to move from their big house into cheaper quarters and
this was not pleasing for her to contemplate

Judge Payderson came in after a time accompanied by his undersized but
stout court attendant who looked more like a pouterpigeon than a human
being and as they came Bailiff Sparkheaver rapped on the judges desk
beside which he had been slumbering and mumbled Please rise The
audience arose as is the rule of all courts Judge Payderson stirred
among a number of briefs that were lying on his desk and asked
briskly Whats the first case Mr Protus He was speaking to his
clerk

During the long and tedious arrangement of the days docket and while
the various minor motions of lawyers were being considered this
courtroom scene still retained interest for Cowperwood He was so eager
to win so incensed at the outcome of untoward events which had brought
him here He was always intensely irritated though he did not show
it by the whole process of footing delays and queries and quibbles by
which legally the affairs of men were too often hampered Law if you
had asked him and he had accurately expressed himself was a mist
formed out of the moods and the mistakes of men which befogged the sea
of life and prevented plain sailing for the little commercial and social
barques of men it was a miasma of misinterpretation where the ills
of life festered and also a place where the accidentally wounded were
ground between the upper and the nether millstones of force or chance
it was a strange weird interesting and yet futile battle of wits
where the ignorant and the incompetent and the shrewd and the angry and
the weak were made pawns and shuttlecocks for menlawyers who were
playing upon their moods their vanities their desires and their
necessities It was an unholy and unsatisfactory disrupting and delaying
spectacle a painful commentary on the frailties of life and men a
trick a snare a pit and gin In the hands of the strong like himself
when he was at his best the law was a sword and a shield a trap to
place before the feet of the unwary a pit to dig in the path of those
who might pursue It was anything you might choose to make of ita door
to illegal opportunity a cloud of dust to be cast in the eyes of
those who might choose and rightfully to see a veil to be dropped
arbitrarily between truth and its execution justice and its judgment
crime and punishment Lawyers in the main were intellectual mercenaries
to be bought and sold in any cause It amused him to hear the ethical
and emotional platitudes of lawyers to see how readily they would
lie steal prevaricate misrepresent in almost any cause and for any
purpose Great lawyers were merely great unscrupulous subtleties
like himself sitting back in dark closewoven lairs like spiders and
awaiting the approach of unwary human flies Life was at best a dark
inhuman unkind unsympathetic struggle built of cruelties and the law
and its lawyers were the most despicable representatives of the whole
unsatisfactory mess Still he used law as he would use any other trap or
weapon to rid him of a human ill and as for lawyers he picked them
up as he would any club or knife wherewith to defend himself He had no
particular respect for any of themnot even Harper Steger though he
liked him They were tools to be usedknives keys clubs anything
you will but nothing more When they were through they were paid
and droppedput aside and forgotten As for judges they were merely
incompetent lawyers at a rule who were shelved by some fortunate turn
of chance and who would not in all likelihood be as efficient as the
lawyers who pleaded before them if they were put in the same position
He had no respect for judgeshe knew too much about them He knew how
often they were sycophants political climbers political hacks tools
timeservers judicial doormats lying before the financially and
politically great and powerful who used them as such Judges were
fools as were most other people in this dusty shifty world Pah His
inscrutable eyes took them all in and gave no sign His only safety lay
he thought in the magnificent subtley of his own brain and nowhere
else You could not convince Cowperwood of any great or inherent virtue
in this mortal scheme of things He knew too much he knew himself

When the judge finally cleared away the various minor motions pending
he ordered his clerk to call the case of the City of Philadelphia
versus Frank A Cowperwood which was done in a clear voice Both Dennis
Shannon the new district attorney and Steger were on their feet at
once Steger and Cowperwood together with Shannon and Strobik who
had now come in and was standing as the representative of the State of
Pennsylvaniathe complainanthad seated themselves at the long table
inside the railing which inclosed the space before the judges desk
Steger proposed to Judge Payderson for effects sake more than anything
else that this indictment be quashed but was overruled

A jury to try the case was now quickly impaneledtwelve men out of
the usual list called to serve for the monthand was then ready to be
challenged by the opposing counsel The business of impaneling a
jury was a rather simple thing so far as this court was concerned It
consisted in the mandarinlike clerk taking the names of all the jurors
called to serve in this court for the monthsome fifty in alland
putting them each written on a separate slip of paper in a whirling
drum spinning it around a few times and then lifting out the first
slip which his hand encountered thus glorifying chance and settling on
who should be juror No 1 His hand reaching in twelve times drew out
the names of the twelve jurymen who as their names were called were
ordered to take their places in the jurybox

Cowperwood observed this proceeding with a great deal of interest What
could be more important than the men who were going to try him The
process was too swift for accurate judgment but he received a faint
impression of middleclass men One man in particular however an
old man of sixtyfive with irongray hair and beard shaggy eyebrows
sallow complexion and stooped shoulders struck him as having that
kindness of temperament and breadth of experience which might under
certain circumstances be argumentatively swayed in his favor Another
a small sharpnosed sharpchinned commercial man of some kind he
immediately disliked

I hope I dont have to have that man on my jury he said to Steger
quietly

You dont replied Steger Ill challenge him We have the right
to fifteen peremptory challenges on a case like this and so has the
prosecution

When the jurybox was finally full the two lawyers waited for the clerk
to bring them the small board upon which slips of paper bearing the
names of the twelve jurors were fastened in rows in order of their
selectionjurors one two and three being in the first row four
five and six in the second and so on It being the prerogative of the
attorney for the prosecution to examine and challenge the jurors first
Shannon arose and taking the board began to question them as to their
trades or professions their knowledge of the case before the court and
their possible prejudice for or against the prisoner

It was the business of both Steger and Shannon to find men who knew a
little something of finance and could understand a peculiar situation
of this kind without any of them looking at it from Stegers point of
view having any prejudice against a mans trying to assist himself by
reasonable means to weather a financial storm or looking at it from
Shannons point of view having any sympathy with such means if they
bore about them the least suspicion of chicanery jugglery or dishonest
manipulation of any kind As both Shannon and Steger in due course
observed for themselves in connection with this jury it was composed of
that assorted social fry which the dragnets of the courts cast into the
ocean of the city bring to the surface for purposes of this sort
It was made up in the main of managers agents tradesmen editors
engineers architects furriers grocers traveling salesmen authors
and every other kind of working citizen whose experience had fitted
him for service in proceedings of this character Rarely would you have
found a man of great distinction but very frequently a group of men who
were possessed of no small modicum of that interesting quality known as
hard common sense

Throughout all this Cowperwood sat quietly examining the men A young
florist with a pale face a wide speculative forehead and anemic
hands struck him as being sufficiently impressionable to his personal
charm to be worth while He whispered as much to Steger There was a
shrewd Jew a furrier who was challenged because he had read all of the
news of the panic and had lost two thousand dollars in streetrailway
stocks There was a stout wholesale grocer with red cheeks blue eyes
and flaxen hair who Cowperwood said he thought was stubborn He was
eliminated There was a thin dapper manager of a small retail clothing
store very anxious to be excused who declared falsely that he
did not believe in swearing by the Bible Judge Payderson eyeing him
severely let him go There were some ten more in allmen who knew
of Cowperwood men who admitted they were prejudiced men who were
hidebound Republicans and resentful of this crime men who knew
Stenerwho were pleasantly eliminated

By twelve oclock however a jury reasonably satisfactory to both sides
had been chosen





Chapter XLI


At two oclock sharp Dennis Shannon as district attorney began his
opening address He stated in a very simple kindly wayfor he had a
most engaging mannerthat the indictment as here presented charged Mr
Frank A Cowperwood who was sitting at the table inside the juryrail
first with larceny second with embezzlement third with larceny as
bailee and fourth with embezzlement of a certain sum of moneya
specific sum to wit sixty thousand dollarson a check given him
drawn to his order October 9 1871 which was intended to reimburse
him for a certain number of certificates of city loan which he as
agent or bailee of the check was supposed to have purchased for the
city sinkingfund on the order of the city treasurer under some form of
agreement which had been in existence between them and which had
been in force for some timesaid fund being intended to take up
such certificates as they might mature in the hands of holders and be
presented for paymentfor which purpose however the check in question
had never been used

Now gentlemen said Mr Shannon very quietly before we go into
this very simple question of whether Mr Cowperwood did or did not on
the date in question get from the city treasurer sixty thousand dollars
for which he made no honest return let me explain to you just what
the people mean when they charge him first with larceny second with
embezzlement third with larceny as bailee and fourth with embezzlement
on a check Now as you see there are four counts here as we lawyers
term them and the reason there are four counts is as follows A man may
be guilty of larceny and embezzlement at the same time or of larceny or
embezzlement separately and without being guilty of the other and the
district attorney representing the people might be uncertain not that
he was not guilty of both but that it might not be possible to present
the evidence under one count so as to insure his adequate punishment
for a crime which in a way involved both In such cases gentlemen it
is customary to indict a man under separate counts as has been done
in this case Now the four counts in this case in a way overlap and
confirm each other and it will be your duty after we have explained
their nature and character and presented the evidence to say whether
the defendant is guilty on one count or the other or on two or three of
the counts or on all four just as you see fit and properor to put
it in a better way as the evidence warrants Larceny as you may or
may not know is the act of taking away the goods or chattels of another
without his knowledge or consent and embezzlement is the fraudulent
appropriation to ones own use of what is intrusted to ones care and
management especially money Larceny as bailee on the other hand
is simply a more definite form of larceny wherein one fixes the act of
carrying away the goods of another without his knowledge or consent on
the person to whom the goods were delivered in trust that is the agent
or bailee Embezzlement on a check which constitutes the fourth charge
is simply a more definite form of fixing charge number two in an exact
way and signifies appropriating the money on a check given for a certain
definite purpose All of these charges as you can see gentlemen are
in a way synonymous They overlap and overlay each other The people
through their representative the district attorney contend that Mr
Cowperwood the defendant here is guilty of all four charges So now
gentlemen we will proceed to the history of this crime which proves to
me as an individual that this defendant has one of the most subtle and
dangerous minds of the criminal financier type and we hope by witnesses
to prove that to you also

Shannon because the rules of evidence and court procedure here admitted
of no interruption of the prosecution in presenting a case then went
on to describe from his own point of view how Cowperwood had first
met Stener how he had wormed himself into his confidence how little
financial knowledge Stener had and so forth coming down finally to
the day the check for sixty thousand dollars was given Cowperwood how
Stener as treasurer claimed that he knew nothing of its delivery
which constituted the base of the charge of larceny how Cowperwood
having it misappropriated the certificates supposed to have been
purchased for the sinkingfund if they were purchased at allall of
which Shannon said constituted the crimes with which the defendant was
charged and of which he was unquestionably guilty

We have direct and positive evidence of all that we have thus far
contended gentlemen Mr Shannon concluded violently This is not a
matter of hearsay or theory but of fact You will be shown by direct
testimony which cannot be shaken just how it was done If after you
have heard all this you still think this man is innocentthat he did
not commit the crimes with which he is chargedit is your business to
acquit him On the other hand if you think the witnesses whom we shall
put on the stand are telling the truth then it is your business to
convict him to find a verdict for the people as against the defendant
I thank you for your attention

The jurors stirred comfortably and took positions of ease in which they
thought they were to rest for the time but their idle comfort was of
short duration for Shannon now called out the name of George W Stener
who came hurrying forward very pale very flaccid very tiredlooking
His eyes as he took his seat in the witnesschair laying his hand on
the Bible and swearing to tell the truth roved in a restless nervous
manner

His voice was a little weak as he started to give his testimony He told
first how he had met Cowperwood in the early months of 1866he could
not remember the exact day it was during his first term as city
treasurerhe had been elected to the office in the fall of 1864 He had
been troubled about the condition of city loan which was below par
and which could not be sold by the city legally at anything but par
Cowperwood had been recommended to him by some oneMr Strobik
he believed though he couldnt be sure It was the custom of city
treasurers to employ brokers or a broker in a crisis of this kind
and he was merely following what had been the custom He went on to
describe under steady promptings and questions from the incisive mind
of Shannon just what the nature of this first conversation washe
remembered it fairly well how Mr Cowperwood had said he thought he
could do what was wanted how he had gone away and drawn up a plan or
thought one out and how he had returned and laid it before Stener
Under Shannons skillful guidance Stener elucidated just what this
scheme waswhich wasnt exactly so flattering to the honesty of men in
general as it was a testimonial to their subtlety and skill

After much discussion of Steners and Cowperwoods relations the
story finally got down to the preceding October when by reason
of companionship long business understanding mutually prosperous
relationship etc the place had been reached where it was explained
Cowperwood was not only handling several millions of city loan annually
buying and selling for the city and trading in it generally but in the
bargain had secured one five hundred thousand dollars worth of city
money at an exceedingly low rate of interest which was being invested
for himself and Stener in profitable streetcar ventures of one kind and
another Stener was not anxious to be altogether clear on this point
but Shannon seeing that he was later to prosecute Stener himself for
this very crime of embezzlement and that Steger would soon follow in
crossexamination was not willing to let him be hazy Shannon wanted to
fix Cowperwood in the minds of the jury as a clever tricky person and
by degrees he certainly managed to indicate a very subtleminded man
Occasionally as one sharp point after another of Cowperwoods skill was
brought out and made moderately clear one juror or another turned to
look at Cowperwood And he noting this and in order to impress them all
as favorably as possible merely gazed Stenerward with a steady air of
intelligence and comprehension

The examination now came down to the matter of the particular check for
sixty thousand dollars which Albert Stires had handed Cowperwood on the
afternoonlateof October 9 1871 Shannon showed Stener the check
itself Had he ever seen it Yes Where In the office of District
Attorney Pettie on October 20th or thereabouts last Was that the first
time he had seen it Yes Had he ever heard about it before then Yes
When On October 10th last Would he kindly tell the jury in his own way
just how and under what circumstances he first heard of it then Stener
twisted uncomfortably in his chair It was a hard thing to do It was
not a pleasant commentary on his own character and degree of moral
stamina to say the least However he cleared his throat again and
began a description of that small but bitter section of his lifes drama
in which Cowperwood finding himself in a tight place and about to
fail had come to him at his office and demanded that he loan him three
hundred thousand dollars more in one lump sum

There was considerable bickering just at this point between Steger and
Shannon for the former was very anxious to make it appear that Stener
was lying out of the whole cloth about this Steger got in his objection
at this point and created a considerable diversion from the main theme
because Stener kept saying he thought or he believed

Object shouted Steger repeatedly I move that that be stricken from
the record as incompetent irrelevant and immaterial The witness is
not allowed to say what he thinks and the prosecution knows it very
well

Your honor insisted Shannon I am doing the best I can to have the
witness tell a plain straightforward story and I think that it is
obvious that he is doing so

Object reiterated Steger vociferously Your honor I insist that
the district attorney has no right to prejudice the minds of the jury by
flattering estimates of the sincerity of the witness What he thinks of
the witness and his sincerity is of no importance in this case I must
ask that your honor caution him plainly in this matter

Objection sustained declared Judge Payderson the prosecution will
please be more explicit and Shannon went on with his case

Steners testimony in one respect was most important for it made
plain what Cowperwood did not want brought outnamely that he and
Stener had had a dispute before this that Stener had distinctly told
Cowperwood that he would not loan him any more money that Cowperwood
had told Stener on the day before he secured this check and again on
that very day that he was in a very desperate situation financially
and that if he were not assisted to the extent of three hundred thousand
dollars he would fail and that then both he and Stener would be ruined
On the morning of this day according to Stener he had sent Cowperwood
a letter ordering him to cease purchasing city loan certificates for the
sinkingfund It was after their conversation on the same afternoon that
Cowperwood surreptitiously secured the check for sixty thousand
dollars from Albert Stires without his Steners knowledge and it was
subsequent to this latter again that Stener sending Albert to demand
the return of the check was refused though the next day at five
oclock in the afternoon Cowperwood made an assignment And the
certificates for which the check had been purloined were not in the
sinkingfund as they should have been This was dark testimony for
Cowperwood

If any one imagines that all this was done without many vehement
objections and exceptions made and taken by Steger and subsequently
when he was crossexamining Stener by Shannon he errs greatly At
times the chamber was coruscating with these two gentlemens bitter
wrangles and his honor was compelled to hammer his desk with his gavel
and to threaten both with contempt of court in order to bring them to a
sense of order Indeed while Payderson was highly incensed the jury was
amused and interested

You gentlemen will have to stop this or I tell you now that you will
both be heavily fined This is a court of law not a barroom Mr
Steger I expect you to apologize to me and your colleague at once Mr
Shannon I must ask that you use less aggressive methods Your manner
is offensive to me It is not becoming to a court of law I will not
caution either of you again

Both lawyers apologized as lawyers do on such occasions but it really
made but little difference Their individual attitudes and moods
continued about as before

What did he say to you asked Shannon of Stener after one of these
troublesome interruptions on that occasion October 9th last when
he came to you and demanded the loan of an additional three hundred
thousand dollars Give his words as near as you can rememberexactly
if possible

Object interposed Steger vigorously His exact words are not
recorded anywhere except in Mr Steners memory and his memory of
them cannot be admitted in this case The witness has testified to the
general facts

Judge Payderson smiled grimly Objection overruled he returned

Exception shouted Steger

He said as near as I can remember replied Stener drumming on the
arms of the witnesschair in a nervous way that if I didnt give him
three hundred thousand dollars he was going to fail and I would be poor
and go to the penitentiary

Object shouted Stager leaping to his feet Your honor I object
to the whole manner in which this examination is being conducted by the
prosecution The evidence which the district attorney is here trying to
extract from the uncertain memory of the witness is in defiance of all
law and precedent and has no definite bearing on the facts of the case
and could not disprove or substantiate whether Mr Cowperwood thought
or did not think that he was going to fail Mr Stener might give one
version of this conversation or any conversation that took place at this
time and Mr Cowperwood another As a matter of fact their versions
are different I see no point in Mr Shannons line of inquiry
unless it is to prejudice the jurys minds towards accepting certain
allegations which the prosecution is pleased to make and which it cannot
possibly substantiate I think you ought to caution the witness to
testify only in regard to things that he recalls exactly not to what
he thinks he remembers and for my part I think that all that has been
testified to in the last five minutes might be well stricken out

Objection overruled replied Judge Payderson rather indifferently
and Steger who had been talking merely to overcome the weight of
Steners testimony in the minds of the jury sat down

Shannon once more approached Stener

Now as near as you can remember Mr Stener I wish you would tell
the jury what else it was that Mr Cowperwood said on that occasion He
certainly didnt stop with the remark that you would be ruined and go to
the penitentiary Wasnt there other language that was employed on that
occasion

He said as far as I can remember replied Stener that there were
a lot of political schemers who were trying to frighten me that if I
didnt give him three hundred thousand dollars we would both be ruined
and that I might as well be tried for stealing a sheep as a lamb

Ha yelled Shannon He said that did he

Yes sir he did said Stener

How did he say it exactly What were his exact words Shannon
demanded emphatically pointing a forceful forefinger at Stener in
order to key him up to a clear memory of what had transpired

Well as near as I can remember he said just that replied Stener
vaguely You might as well be tried for stealing a sheep as a lamb

Exactly exclaimed Shannon whirling around past the jury to look at
Cowperwood I thought so

Pure pyrotechnics your honor said Steger rising to his feet on the
instant All intended to prejudice the minds of the jury Acting
I wish you would caution the counsel for the prosecution to confine
himself to the evidence in hand and not act for the benefit of his
case

The spectators smiled and Judge Payderson noting it frowned severely
Do you make that as an objection Mr Steger he asked

I certainly do your honor insisted Steger resourcefully

Objection overruled Neither counsel for the prosecution nor for the
defense is limited to a peculiar routine of expression

Steger himself was ready to smile but he did not dare to

Cowperwood fearing the force of such testimony and regretting it still
looked at Stener pityingly The feebleness of the man the weakness of
the man the pass to which his cowardice had brought them both

When Shannon was through bringing out this unsatisfactory data Steger
took Stener in hand but he could not make as much out of him as he
hoped In so far as this particular situation was concerned Stener
was telling the exact truth and it is hard to weaken the effect of the
exact truth by any subtlety of interpretation though it can sometimes
be done With painstaking care Steger went over all the ground of
Steners long relationship with Cowperwood and tried to make it
appear that Cowperwood was invariably the disinterested agentnot the
ringleader in a subtle really criminal adventure It was hard to do
but he made a fine impression Still the jury listened with skeptical
minds It might not be fair to punish Cowperwood for seizing with
avidity upon a splendid chance to get rich quick they thought but it
certainly was not worth while to throw a veil of innocence over such
palpable human cupidity Finally both lawyers were through with Stener
for the time being anyhow and then Albert Stires was called to the
stand

He was the same thin pleasant alert rather agreeable soul that he had
been in the heyday of his clerkly prosperitya little paler now but
not otherwise changed His small property had been saved for him by
Cowperwood who had advised Steger to inform the Municipal Reform
Association that Stires bondsmen were attempting to sequestrate it for
their own benefit when actually it should go to the city if there
were any real claim against himwhich there was not That watchful
organization had issued one of its numerous reports covering this
point and Albert had had the pleasure of seeing Strobik and the others
withdraw in haste Naturally he was grateful to Cowperwood even though
once he had been compelled to cry in vain in his presence He was
anxious now to do anything he could to help the banker but his
naturally truthful disposition prevented him from telling anything
except the plain facts which were partly beneficial and partly not

Stires testified that he recalled Cowperwoods saying that he had
purchased the certificates that he was entitled to the money that
Stener was unduly frightened and that no harm would come to him
Albert He identified certain memoranda in the city treasurers books
which were produced as being accurate and others in Cowperwoods
books which were also produced as being corroborative His testimony
as to Steners astonishment on discovering that his chief clerk had
given Cowperwood a check was against the latter but Cowperwood hoped to
overcome the effect of this by his own testimony later

Up to now both Steger and Cowperwood felt that they were doing fairly
well and that they need not be surprised if they won their case





Chapter XLII


The trial moved on One witness for the prosecution after another
followed until the State had built up an arraignment that satisfied
Shannon that he had established Cowperwoods guilt whereupon he
announced that he rested Steger at once arose and began a long argument
for the dismissal of the case on the ground that there was no evidence
to show this that and the other but Judge Payderson would have none of
it He knew how important the matter was in the local political world

I dont think you had better go into all that now Mr Steger he
said wearily after allowing him to proceed a reasonable distance I
am familiar with the custom of the city and the indictment as here made
does not concern the custom of the city Your argument is with the jury
not with me I couldnt enter into that now You may renew your motion
at the close of the defendants case Motion denied

DistrictAttorney Shannon who had been listening attentively sat down
Steger seeing there was no chance to soften the judges mind by any
subtlety of argument returned to Cowperwood who smiled at the result

Well just have to take our chances with the jury he announced

I was sure of it replied Cowperwood

Steger then approached the jury and having outlined the case briefly
from his angle of observation continued by telling them what he was
sure the evidence would show from his point of view

As a matter of fact gentlemen there is no essential difference in
the evidence which the prosecution can present and that which we the
defense can present We are not going to dispute that Mr Cowperwood
received a check from Mr Stener for sixty thousand dollars or that
he failed to put the certificate of city loan which that sum of money
represented and to which he was entitled in payment as agent in the
sinkingfund as the prosecution now claims he should have done but
we are going to claim and prove also beyond the shadow of a reasonable
doubt that he had a right as the agent of the city doing business with
the city through its treasury department for four years to withhold
under an agreement which he had with the city treasurer all payments
of money and all deposits of certificates in the sinkingfund until the
first day of each succeeding monththe first month following any given
transaction As a matter of fact we can and will bring many traders and
bankers who have had dealings with the city treasury in the past in just
this way to prove this The prosecution is going to ask you to believe
that Mr Cowperwood knew at the time he received this check that he was
going to fail that he did not buy the certificates as he claimed with
the view of placing them in the sinkingfund and that knowing he
was going to fail and that he could not subsequently deposit them he
deliberately went to Mr Albert Stires Mr Steners secretary told
him that he had purchased such certificates and on the strength of a
falsehood implied if not actually spoken secured the check and walked
away

Now gentlemen I am not going to enter into a longwinded discussion
of these points at this time since the testimony is going to show very
rapidly what the facts are We have a number of witnesses here and
we are all anxious to have them heard What I am going to ask you to
remember is that there is not one scintilla of testimony outside of that
which may possibly be given by Mr George W Stener which will show
either that Mr Cowperwood knew at the time he called on the city
treasurer that he was going to fail or that he had not purchased the
certificates in question or that he had not the right to withhold
them from the sinkingfund as long as he pleased up to the first of
the month the time he invariably struck a balance with the city
Mr Stener the excity treasurer may possibly testify one way Mr
Cowperwood on his own behalf will testify another It will then be for
you gentlemen to decide between them to decide which one you prefer
to believeMr George W Stener the excity treasurer the former
commercial associate of Mr Cowperwood who after years and years of
profit solely because of conditions of financial stress fire and
panic preferred to turn on his onetime associate from whose labors he
had reaped so much profit or Mr Frank A Cowperwood the wellknown
banker and financier who did his best to weather the storm alone who
fulfilled to the letter every agreement he ever had with the city who
has even until this hour been busy trying to remedy the unfair financial
difficulties forced upon him by fire and panic and who only yesterday
made an offer to the city that if he were allowed to continue in
uninterrupted control of his affairs he would gladly repay as quickly as
possible every dollar of his indebtedness which is really not all his
including the five hundred thousand dollars under discussion between him
and Mr Stener and the city and so prove by his works not talk that
there was no basis for this unfair suspicion of his motives As you
perhaps surmise the city has not chosen to accept his offer and I
shall try and tell you why later gentlemen For the present we will
proceed with the testimony and for the defense all I ask is that you
give very close attention to all that is testified to here today
Listen very carefully to Mr W C Davison when he is put on the stand
Listen equally carefully to Mr Cowperwood when we call him to testify
Follow the other testimony closely and then you will be able to judge
for yourselves See if you can distinguish a just motive for this
prosecution I cant I am very much obliged to you for listening to me
gentlemen so attentively

He then put on Arthur Rivers who had acted for Cowperwood on change
as special agent during the panic to testify to the large quantities
of city loan he had purchased to stay the market and then after him
Cowperwoods brothers Edward and Joseph who testified to instructions
received from Rivers as to buying and selling city loan on that
occasionprincipally buying

The next witness was President W C Davison of the Girard National
Bank He was a large man physically not so round of body as full and
broad His shoulders and chest were ample He had a big blond head with
an ample breadth of forehead which was high and sanelooking He had
a thick squat nose which however was forceful and thin firm even
lips There was the faintest touch of cynical humor in his hard blue
eyes at times but mostly he was friendly alert placidlooking
without seeming in the least sentimental or even kindly His business
as one could see plainly was to insist on hard financial facts and
one could see also how he would naturally be drawn to Frank Algernon
Cowperwood without being mentally dominated or upset by him As he took
the chair very quietly and yet one might say significantly it was
obvious that he felt that this sort of legalfinancial palaver was above
the average man and beneath the dignity of a true financierin other
words a bother The drowsy Sparkheaver holding up a Bible beside him
for him to swear by might as well have been a block of wood His oath
was a personal matter with him It was good business to tell the truth
at times His testimony was very direct and very simple

He had known Mr Frank Algernon Cowperwood for nearly ten years He
had done business with or through him nearly all of that time He knew
nothing of his personal relations with Mr Stener and did not know
Mr Stener personally As for the particular check of sixty thousand
dollarsyes he had seen it before It had come into the bank on
October 10th along with other collateral to offset an overdraft on the
part of Cowperwood  Co It was placed to the credit of Cowperwood 
Co on the books of the bank and the bank secured the cash through the
clearinghouse No money was drawn out of the bank by Cowperwood  Co
after that to create an overdraft The banks account with Cowperwood
was squared

Nevertheless Mr Cowperwood might have drawn heavily and nothing would
have been thought of it Mr Davison did not know that Mr Cowperwood
was going to faildid not suppose that he could so quickly He had
frequently overdrawn his account with the bank as a matter of fact
it was the regular course of his business to overdraw it It kept his
assets actively in use which was the height of good business His
overdrafts were protected by collateral however and it was his custom
to send bundles of collateral or checks or both which were variously
distributed to keep things straight Mr Cowperwoods account was the
largest and most active in the bank Mr Davison kindly volunteered
When Mr Cowperwood had failed there had been over ninety thousand
dollars worth of certificates of city loan in the banks possession
which Mr Cowperwood had sent there as collateral Shannon on
crossexamination tried to find out for the sake of the effect on the
jury whether Mr Davison was not for some ulterior motive especially
favorable to Cowperwood It was not possible for him to do that Steger
followed and did his best to render the favorable points made by Mr
Davison in Cowperwoods behalf perfectly clear to the jury by having him
repeat them Shannon objected of course but it was of no use Steger
managed to make his point

He now decided to have Cowperwood take the stand and at the mention of
his name in this connection the whole courtroom bristled

Cowperwood came forward briskly and quickly He was so calm so jaunty
so defiant of life and yet so courteous to it These lawyers this
jury this strawandwater judge these machinations of fate did not
basically disturb or humble or weaken him He saw through the mental
equipment of the jury at once He wanted to assist his counsel in
disturbing and confusing Shannon but his reason told him that only an
indestructible fabric of fact or seeming would do it He believed in the
financial rightness of the thing he had done He was entitled to do it
Life was warparticularly financial life and strategy was its keynote
its duty its necessity Why should he bother about petty picayune
minds which could not understand this He went over his history for
Steger and the jury and put the sanest most comfortable light on it
that he could He had not gone to Mr Stener in the first place he
saidhe had been called He had not urged Mr Stener to anything He
had merely shown him and his friends financial possibilities which they
were only too eager to seize upon And they had seized upon them It
was not possible for Shannon to discover at this period how subtly he
had organized his streetcar companies so that he could have shaken
out Stener and his friends without their being able to voice a single
protest so he talked of these things as opportunities which he had made
for Stener and others Shannon was not a financier neither was
Steger They had to believe in a way though they doubted it
partlyparticularly Shannon He was not responsible for the custom
prevailing in the office of the city treasurer he said He was a banker
and broker

The jury looked at him and believed all except this matter of the
sixtythousanddollar check When it came to that he explained it all
plausibly enough When he had gone to see Stener those several last
days he had not fancied that he was really going to fail He had
asked Stener for some money it is truenot so very much all things
consideredone hundred and fifty thousand dollars but as Stener
should have testified he Cowperwood was not disturbed in his manner
Stener had merely been one resource of his He was satisfied at that
time that he had many others He had not used the forceful language or
made the urgent appeal which Stener said he had although he had pointed
out to Stener that it was a mistake to become panicstricken also to
withhold further credit It was true that Stener was his easiest his
quickest resource but not his only one He thought as a matter of
fact that his credit would be greatly extended by his principal money
friends if necessary and that he would have ample time to patch up his
affairs and keep things going until the storm should blow over He had
told Stener of his extended purchase of city loan to stay the market on
the first day of the panic and of the fact that sixty thousand dollars
was due him Stener had made no objection It was just possible that
he was too mentally disturbed at the time to pay close attention After
that to his Cowperwoods surprise unexpected pressure on great
financial houses from unexpected directions had caused them to be not
willingly but unfortunately severe with him This pressure coming
collectively the next day had compelled him to close his doors though
he had not really expected to up to the last moment His call for the
sixtythousanddollar check at the time had been purely fortuitous He
needed the money of course but it was due him and his clerks were
all very busy He merely asked for and took it personally to save time
Stener knew if it had been refused him he would have brought suit The
matter of depositing city loan certificates in the sinkingfund
when purchased for the city was something to which he never gave any
personal attention whatsoever His bookkeeper Mr Stapley attended to
all that He did not know as a matter of fact that they had not been
deposited This was a barefaced lie He did know As for the check
being turned over to the Girard National Bank that was fortuitous
It might just as well have been turned over to some other bank if the
conditions had been different

Thus on and on he went answering all of Stegers and Shannons
searching questions with the most engaging frankness and you could have
sworn from the solemnity with which he took it allthe serious business
attentionthat he was the soul of socalled commercial honor And to
say truly he did believe in the justice as well as the necessity and
the importance of all that he had done and now described He wanted the
jury to see it as he saw itput itself in his place and sympathize with
him

He was through finally and the effect on the jury of his testimony and
his personality was peculiar Philip Moultrie juror No 1 decided that
Cowperwood was lying He could not see how it was possible that he could
not know the day before that he was going to fail He must have known
he thought Anyhow the whole series of transactions between him
and Stener seemed deserving of some punishment and all during this
testimony he was thinking how when he got in the juryroom he would
vote guilty He even thought of some of the arguments he would use to
convince the others that Cowperwood was guilty Juror No 2 on the
contrary Simon Glassberg a clothier thought he understood how it
all came about and decided to vote for acquittal He did not think
Cowperwood was innocent but he did not think he deserved to be
punished Juror No 3 Fletcher Norton an architect thought Cowperwood
was guilty but at the same time that he was too talented to be sent to
prison Juror No 4 Charles Hillegan an Irishman a contractor and
a somewhat religiousminded person thought Cowperwood was guilty and
ought to be punished Juror No 5 Philip Lukash a coal merchant
thought he was guilty Juror No 6 Benjamin Fraser a mining expert
thought he was probably guilty but he could not be sure Uncertain
what he would do juror No 7 J J Bridges a broker in Third Street
small practical narrow thought Cowperwood was shrewd and guilty and
deserved to be punished He would vote for his punishment Juror No
8 Guy E Tripp general manager of a small steamboat company was
uncertain Juror No 9 Joseph Tisdale a retired glue manufacturer
thought Cowperwood was probably guilty as charged but to Tisdale it
was no crime Cowperwood was entitled to do as he had done under the
circumstances Tisdale would vote for his acquittal Juror No 10
Richard Marsh a young florist was for Cowperwood in a sentimental way
He had as a matter of fact no real convictions Juror No 11 Richard
Webber a grocer small financially but heavy physically was for
Cowperwoods conviction He thought him guilty Juror No 12 Washington
B Thomas a wholesale flour merchant thought Cowperwood was guilty
but believed in a recommendation to mercy after pronouncing him so Men
ought to be reformed was his slogan

So they stood and so Cowperwood left them wondering whether any of his
testimony had had a favorable effect





Chapter XLIII


Since it is the privilege of the lawyer for the defense to address the
jury first Steger bowed politely to his colleague and came forward
Putting his hands on the jurybox rail he began in a very quiet
modest but impressive way

Gentlemen of the jury my client Mr Frank Algernon Cowperwood a
wellknown banker and financier of this city doing business in Third
Street is charged by the State of Pennsylvania represented by the
district attorney of this district with fraudulently transferring from
the treasury of the city of Philadelphia to his own purse the sum of
sixty thousand dollars in the form of a check made out to his order
dated October 9 1871 and by him received from one Albert Stires the
private secretary and head bookkeeper of the treasurer of this city
at the time in question Now gentlemen what are the facts in this
connection You have heard the various witnesses and know the general
outlines of the story Take the testimony of George W Stener to begin
with He tells you that sometime back in the year 1866 he was greatly in
need of some one some banker or broker who would tell him how to bring
city loan which was selling very low at the time to parwho would not
only tell him this but proceed to demonstrate that his knowledge was
accurate by doing it Mr Stener was an inexperienced man at the time
in the matter of finance Mr Cowperwood was an active young man with
an enviable record as a broker and a trader on change He proceeded
to demonstrate to Mr Stener not only in theory but in fact how this
thing of bringing city loan to par could be done He made an arrangement
at that time with Mr Stener the details of which you have heard from
Mr Stener himself the result of which was that a large amount of city
loan was turned over to Mr Cowperwood by Mr Stener for sale and by
adroit manipulationmethods of buying and selling which need not be
gone into here but which are perfectly sane and legitimate in the world
in which Mr Cowperwood operated did bring that loan to par and kept
it there year after year as you have all heard here testified to

Now what is the bone of contention here gentlemen the significant
fact which brings Mr Stener into this court at this time charging his
oldtime agent and broker with larceny and embezzlement and alleging
that he has transferred to his own use without a shadow of return sixty
thousand dollars of the money which belongs to the city treasury What
is it Is it that Mr Cowperwood secretly with great stealth as it
were at some time or other unknown to Mr Stener or to his assistants
entered the office of the treasurer and forcibly and with criminal
intent carried away sixty thousand dollars worth of the citys money
Not at all The charge is as you have heard the district attorney
explain that Mr Cowperwood came in broad daylight at between four and
five oclock of the afternoon preceeding the day of his assignment was
closeted with Mr Stener for a half or threequarters of an hour came
out explained to Mr Albert Stires that he had recently bought sixty
thousand dollars worth of city loan for the city sinkingfund for
which he had not been paid asked that the amount be credited on the
citys books to him and that he be given a check which was his due
and walked out Anything very remarkable about that gentlemen Anything
very strange Has it been testified here today that Mr Cowperwood was
not the agent of the city for the transaction of just such business as
he said on that occasion that he had transacted Did any one say here on
the witnessstand that he had not bought city loan as he said he had

Why is it then that Mr Stener charges Mr Cowperwood with larcenously
securing and feloniously disposing of a check for sixty thousand dollars
for certificates which he had a right to buy and which it has not been
contested here that he did buy The reason lies just herelistenjust
here At the time my client asked for the check and took it away with
him and deposited it in his own bank to his own account he failed so
the prosecution insists to put the sixty thousand dollars worth of
certificates for which he had received the check in the sinkingfund
and having failed to do that and being compelled by the pressure of
financial events the same day to suspend payment generally he thereby
according to the prosecution and the anxious leaders of the
Republican party in the city became an embezzler a thief a this or
thatanything you please so long as you find a substitute for George W
Stener and the indifferent leaders of the Republican party in the eyes
of the people

And here Mr Steger proceeded boldly and defiantly to outline the entire
political situation as it had manifested itself in connection with the
Chicago fire the subsequent panic and its political consequences and
to picture Cowperwood as the unjustly maligned agent who before the
fire was valuable and honorable enough to suit any of the political
leaders of Philadelphia but afterward and when political defeat
threatened was picked upon as the most available scapegoat anywhere
within reach

And it took him a half hour to do that And afterward but only after he
had pointed to Stener as the true henchman and stalking horse who had
in turn been used by political forces above him to accomplish certain
financial results which they were not willing to have ascribed to
themselves he continued with

But now in the light of all this only see how ridiculous all this is
How silly Frank A Cowperwood had always been the agent of the city in
these matters for years and years He worked under certain rules
which he and Mr Stener had agreed upon in the first place and which
obviously came from others who were above Mr Stener since they were
holdover customs and rules from administrations which had been long
before Mr Stener ever appeared on the scene as city treasurer One of
them was that he could carry all transactions over until the first of
the month following before he struck a balance That is he need not pay
any money over for anything to the city treasurer need not send him any
checks or deposit any money or certificates in the sinkingfund until
the first of the month becausenow listen to this carefully gentlemen
it is importantbecause his transactions in connection with city loan
and everything else that he dealt in for the city treasurer were so
numerous so swift so uncalculated beforehand that he had to have a
loose easy system of this kind in order to do his work properlyto
do business at all Otherwise he could not very well have worked to the
best advantage for Mr Stener or for any one else It would have meant
too much bookkeeping for himtoo much for the city treasurer Mr
Stener has testified to that in the early part of his story Albert
Stires has indicated that that was his understanding of it Well then
what Why just this Would any jury suppose would any sane business
man believe that if such were the case Mr Cowperwood would be running
personally with all these items of deposit to the different banks or
the sinkingfund or the city treasurers office or would be saying to
his head bookkeeper Here Stapley here is a check for sixty thousand
dollars See that the certificates of loan which this represents are put
in the sinkingfund today And why not What a ridiculous supposition
any other supposition is As a matter of course and as had always been
the case Mr Cowperwood had a system When the time came this check
and these certificates would be automatically taken care of He handed
his bookkeeper the check and forgot all about it Would you imagine a
banker with a vast business of this kind doing anything else

Mr Steger paused for breath and inquiry and then having satisfied
himself that his point had been sufficiently made he continued

Of course the answer is that he knew he was going to fail Well Mr
Cowperwoods reply is that he didnt know anything of the sort He has
personally testified here that it was only at the last moment before it
actually happened that he either thought or knew of such an occurrence
Why then this alleged refusal to let him have the check to which he
was legally entitled I think I know I think I can give a reason if you
will hear me out

Steger shifted his position and came at the jury from another
intellectual angle

It was simply because Mr George W Stener at that time owing to
a recent notable fire and a panic imagined for some reasonperhaps
because Mr Cowperwood cautioned him not to become frightened over
local developments generallythat Mr Cowperwood was going to close his
doors and having considerable money on deposit with him at a low rate
of interest Mr Stener decided that Mr Cowperwood must not have any
more moneynot even the money that was actually due him for services
rendered and that had nothing whatsoever to do with the money loaned
him by Mr Stener at two and onehalf per cent Now isnt that a
ridiculous situation But it was because Mr George W Stener was filled
with his own fears based on a fire and a panic which had absolutely
nothing to do with Mr Cowperwoods solvency in the beginning that he
decided not to let Frank A Cowperwood have the money that was actually
due him because he Stener was criminally using the citys money to
further his own private interests through Mr Cowperwood as a broker
and in danger of being exposed and possibly punished Now where I ask
you does the good sense of that decision come in Is it apparent to
you gentlemen Was Mr Cowperwood still an agent for the city at the
time he bought the loan certificates as here testified He certainly
was If so was he entitled to that money Who is going to stand up here
and deny it Where is the question then as to his right or his honesty
in this matter How does it come in here at all I can tell you It
sprang solely from one source and from nowhere else and that is the
desire of the politicians of this city to find a scapegoat for the
Republican party

Now you may think I am going rather far afield for an explanation of
this very peculiar decision to prosecute Mr Cowperwood an agent of the
city for demanding and receiving what actually belonged to him But
Im not Consider the position of the Republican party at that time
Consider the fact that an exposure of the truth in regard to the
details of a large defalcation in the city treasury would have a very
unsatisfactory effect on the election about to be held The Republican
party had a new city treasurer to elect a new district attorney It
had been in the habit of allowing its city treasurers the privilege of
investing the funds in their possession at a low rate of interest for
the benefit of themselves and their friends Their salaries were small
They had to have some way of eking out a reasonable existence Was Mr
George Stener responsible for this custom of loaning out the city money
Not at all Was Mr Cowperwood Not at all The custom had been in vogue
long before either Mr Cowperwood or Mr Stener came on the scene Why
then this great hue and cry about it now The entire uproar sprang
solely from the fear of Mr Stener at this juncture the fear of the
politicians at this juncture of public exposure No city treasurer had
ever been exposed before It was a new thing to face exposure to face
the risk of having the publics attention called to a rather nefarious
practice of which Mr Stener was taking advantage that was all A great
fire and a panic were endangering the security and wellbeing of many
a financial organization in the cityMr Cowperwoods among others
It meant many possible failures and many possible failures meant one
possible failure If Frank A Cowperwood failed he would fail owing the
city of Philadelphia five hundred thousand dollars borrowed from the
city treasurer at the very low rate of interest of two and onehalf per
cent Anything very detrimental to Mr Cowperwood in that Had he gone
to the city treasurer and asked to be loaned money at two and onehalf
per cent If he had was there anything criminal in it from a business
point of view Isnt a man entitled to borrow money from any source he
can at the lowest possible rate of interest Did Mr Stener have to loan
it to Mr Cowperwood if he did not want to As a matter of fact didnt
he testify here today that he personally had sent for Mr Cowperwood
in the first place Why then in Heavens name this excited charge of
larceny larceny as bailee embezzlement embezzlement on a check etc
etc

Once more gentlemen listen Ill tell you why The men who stood
behind Stener and whose bidding he was doing wanted to make a
political scapegoat of some oneof Frank Algernon Cowperwood if they
couldnt get any one else Thats why No other reason under Gods blue
sky not one Why if Mr Cowperwood needed more money just at that time
to tide him over it would have been good policy for them to have given
it to him and hushed this matter up It would have been illegalthough
not any more illegal than anything else that has ever been done in this
connectionbut it would have been safer Fear gentlemen fear lack of
courage inability to meet a great crisis when a great crisis appears
was all that really prevented them from doing this They were afraid to
place confidence in a man who had never heretofore betrayed their trust
and from whose loyalty and great financial ability they and the city
had been reaping large profits The reigning city treasurer of the time
didnt have the courage to go on in the face of fire and panic and the
rumors of possible failure and stick by his illegal guns and so
he decided to draw in his horns as testified here todayto ask Mr
Cowperwood to return all or at least a big part of the five hundred
thousand dollars he had loaned him and which Cowperwood had been
actually using for his Steners benefit and to refuse him in addition
the money that was actually due him for an authorized purchase of city
loan Was Cowperwood guilty as an agent in any of these transactions
Not in the least Was there any suit pending to make him return the five
hundred thousand dollars of city money involved in his present failure
Not at all It was simply a case of wild silly panic on the part of
George W Stener and a strong desire on the part of the Republican
party leaders once they discovered what the situation was to find some
one outside of Stener the party treasurer upon whom they could blame
the shortage in the treasury You heard what Mr Cowperwood testified to
here in this case todaythat he went to Mr Stener to forfend against
any possible action of this kind in the first place And it was because
of this very warning that Mr Stener became wildly excited lost his
head and wanted Mr Cowperwood to return him all his money all the
five hundred thousand dollars he had loaned him at two and onehalf per
cent Isnt that silly financial business at the best Wasnt that a
fine time to try to call a perfectly legal loan

But now to return to this particular check of sixty thousand dollars
When Mr Cowperwood called that last afternoon before he failed Mr
Stener testified that he told him that he couldnt have any more money
that it was impossible and that then Mr Cowperwood went out into his
general office and without his knowledge or consent persuaded his chief
clerk and secretary Mr Albert Stires to give him a check for sixty
thousand dollars to which he was not entitled and on which he Stener
would have stopped payment if he had known

What nonsense Why didnt he know The books were there open to him
Mr Stires told him the first thing the next morning Mr Cowperwood
thought nothing of it for he was entitled to it and could collect it
in any court of law having jurisdiction in such cases failure or
no failure It is silly for Mr Stener to say he would have stopped
payment Such a claim was probably an afterthought of the next morning
after he had talked with his friends the politicians and was all a
part a trick a trap to provide the Republican party with a scapegoat
at this time Nothing more and nothing less and you may be sure no
one knew it better than the people who were most anxious to see Mr
Cowperwood convicted

Steger paused and looked significantly at Shannon

Gentlemen of the jury he finally concluded quietly and earnestly
you are going to find when you think it over in the juryroom this
evening that this charge of larceny and larceny as bailee and
embezzlement of a check for sixty thousand dollars which are contained
in this indictment and which represent nothing more than the eager
effort of the district attorney to word this one act in such a way that
it will look like a crime represents nothing more than the excited
imagination of a lot of political refugees who are anxious to protect
their own skirts at the expense of Mr Cowperwood and who care for
nothinghonor fair play or anything else so long as they are let off
scotfree They dont want the Republicans of Pennsylvania to think too
ill of the Republican party management and control in this city They
want to protect George W Stener as much as possible and to make a
political scapegoat of my client It cant be done and it wont be
done As honorable intelligent men you wont permit it to be done And
I think with that thought I can safely leave you

Steger suddenly turned from the jurybox and walked to his seat beside
Cowperwood while Shannon arose calm forceful vigorous much younger

As between man and man Shannon was not particularly opposed to the case
Steger had made out for Cowperwood nor was he opposed to Cowperwoods
having made money as he did As a matter of fact Shannon actually
thought that if he had been in Cowperwoods position he would have
done exactly the same thing However he was the newly elected district
attorney He had a record to make and besides the political powers
who were above him were satisfied that Cowperwood ought to be convicted
for the looks of the thing Therefore he laid his hands firmly on the
rail at first looked the jurors steadily in the eyes for a time and
having framed a few thoughts in his mind began

Now gentlemen of the jury it seems to me that if we all pay strict
attention to what has transpired here today we will have no difficulty
in reaching a conclusion and it will be a very satisfactory one if
we all try to interpret the facts correctly This defendant Mr
Cowperwood comes into this court today charged as I have stated to
you before with larceny with larceny as bailee with embezzlement
and with embezzlement of a specific checknamely one dated October 9
1871 drawn to the order of Frank A Cowperwood  Company for the sum
of sixty thousand dollars by the secretary of the city treasurer for the
city treasurer and by him signed as he had a perfect right to sign it
and delivered to the said Frank A Cowperwood who claims that he was
not only properly solvent at the time but had previously purchased
certificates of city loan to the value of sixty thousand dollars and
had at that time or would shortly thereafter as was his custom deposit
them to the credit of the city in the city sinkingfund and thus close
what would ordinarily be an ordinary transactionnamely that of Frank
A Cowperwood  Company as bankers and brokers for the city buying city
loan for the city depositing it in the sinkingfund and being promptly
and properly reimbursed Now gentlemen what are the actual facts
in this case Was the said Frank A Cowperwood  Companythere is no
company as you well know as you have heard testified here today only
Frank A Cowperwoodwas the said Frank A Cowperwood a fit person to
receive the check at this time in the manner he received itthat is
was he authorized agent of the city at the time or was he not Was he
solvent Did he actually himself think he was going to fail and was
this sixtythousanddollar check a last thin straw which he was grabbing
at to save his financial life regardless of what it involved legally
morally or otherwise or had he actually purchased certificates of city
loan to the amount he said he had in the way he said he had at the
time he said he had and was he merely collecting his honest due Did he
intend to deposit these certificates of loans in the city sinkingfund
as he said he wouldas it was understood naturally and normally that
he wouldor did he not Were his relations with the city treasurer as
broker and agent the same as they had always been on the day that he
secured this particular check for sixty thousand dollars or were they
not Had they been terminated by a conversation fifteen minutes before
or two days before or two weeks beforeit makes no difference when so
long as they had been properly terminatedor had they not A business
man has a right to abrogate an agreement at any time where there is
no specific form of contract and no fixed period of operation entered
intoas you all must know You must not forget that in considering the
evidence in this case Did George W Stener knowing or suspecting that
Frank A Cowperwood was in a tight place financially unable to fulfill
any longer properly and honestly the duties supposedly devolving on
him by this agreement terminate it then and there on October 9 1871
before this check for sixty thousand dollars was given or did he not
Did Mr Frank A Cowperwood then and there knowing that he was no
longer an agent of the city treasurer and the city and knowing also
that he was insolvent having as Mr Stener contends admitted to him
that he was so and having no intention of placing the certificates
which he subsequently declared he had purchased in the sinkingfund go
out into Mr Steners general office meet his secretary tell him he
had purchased sixty thousand dollars worth of city loan ask for the
check get it put it in his pocket walk off and never make any
return of any kind in any manner shape or form to the city and then
subsequently twentyfour hours later fail owing this and five hundred
thousand dollars more to the city treasury or did he not What are
the facts in this case What have the witnesses testified to What has
George W Stener testified to Albert Stires President Davison Mr
Cowperwood himself What are the interesting subtle facts in this case
anyhow Gentlemen you have a very curious problem to decide

He paused and gazed at the jury adjusting his sleeves as he did so
and looking as though he knew for certain that he was on the trail of a
slippery elusive criminal who was in a fair way to foist himself upon
an honorable and decent community and an honorable and innocent jury as
an honest man

Then he continued

Now gentlemen what are the facts You can see for yourselves exactly
how this whole situation has come about You are sensible men I dont
need to tell you Here are two men one elected treasurer of the city of
Philadelphia sworn to guard the interests of the city and to manipulate
its finances to the best advantage and the other called in at a time
of uncertain financial cogitation to assist in unraveling a possibly
difficult financial problem and then you have a case of a quiet
private financial understanding being reached and of subsequent illegal
dealings in which one man who is shrewder wiser more versed in
the subtle ways of Third Street leads the other along over seemingly
charming paths of fortunate investment into an accidental but none the
less criminal mire of failure and exposure and public calumny and what
not And then they get to the place where the more vulnerable individual
of the twothe man in the most dangerous position the city treasurer
of Philadelphia no lesscan no longer reasonably or let us say
courageously follow the other fellow and then you have such a
spectacle as was described here this afternoon in the witnesschair by
Mr Stenerthat is you have a vicious greedy unmerciful financial
wolf standing over a cowering unsophisticated commercial lamb and
saying to him his white shiny teeth glittering all the while If you
dont advance me the money I ask forthe three hundred thousand dollars
I now demandyou will be a convict your children will be thrown in the
street you and your wife and your family will be in poverty again and
there will be no one to turn a hand for you That is what Mr Stener
says Mr Cowperwood said to him I for my part havent a doubt in the
world that he did Mr Steger in his very guarded references to his
client describes him as a nice kind gentlemanly agent a broker
merely on whom was practically forced the use of five hundred thousand
dollars at two and a half per cent when money was bringing from ten to
fifteen per cent in Third Street on call loans and even more But I
for one dont choose to believe it The thing that strikes me as
strange in all of this is that if he was so nice and kind and gentle and
remotea mere hired and therefore subservient agenthow is it that
he could have gone to Mr Steners office two or three days before the
matter of this sixtythousanddollar check came up and say to him as
Mr Stener testifies under oath that he did say to him If you dont
give me three hundred thousand dollars worth more of the citys money
at once today I will fail and you will be a convict You will go
to the penitentiary Thats what he said to him I will fail and you
will be a convict They cant touch me but they will arrest you I
am an agent merely Does that sound like a nice mild innocent
wellmannered agent a hired broker or doesnt it sound like a hard
defiant contemptuous mastera man in control and ready to rule and win
by fair means or foul

Gentlemen I hold no brief for George W Stener In my judgment he is
as guilty as his smug copartner in crimeif not more sothis oily
financier who came smiling and in sheeps clothing pointing out subtle
ways by which the citys money could be made profitable for both but
when I hear Mr Cowperwood described as I have just heard him described
as a nice mild innocent agent my gorge rises Why gentlemen if you
want to get a right point of view on this whole proposition you will
have to go back about ten or twelve years and see Mr George W Stener
as he was then a rather povertystricken beginner in politics and
before this very subtle and capable broker and agent came along and
pointed out ways and means by which the citys money could be made
profitable George W Stener wasnt very much of a personage then and
neither was Frank A Cowperwood when he found Stener newly elected to
the office of city treasurer Cant you see him arriving at that time
nice and fresh and young and well dressed as shrewd as a fox and
saying Come to me Let me handle city loan Loan me the citys money
at two per cent or less Cant you hear him suggesting this Cant you
see him

George W Stener was a poor man comparatively a very poor man when
he first became city treasurer All he had was a small realestate
and insurance business which brought him in say twentyfive hundred
dollars a year He had a wife and four children to support and he had
never had the slightest taste of what for him might be called luxury or
comfort Then comes Mr Cowperwoodat his request to be sure but on
an errand which held no theory of evil gains in Mr Steners mind at the
timeand proposes his grand scheme of manipulating all the city loan
to their mutual advantage Do you yourselves think gentlemen from what
you have seen of George W Stener here on the witnessstand that it was
he who proposed this plan of illgotten wealth to that gentleman over
there

He pointed to Cowperwood

Does he look to you like a man who would be able to tell that gentleman
anything about finance or this wonderful manipulation that followed
I ask you does he look clever enough to suggest all the subtleties by
which these two subsequently made so much money Why the statement of
this man Cowperwood made to his creditors at the time of his failure
here a few weeks ago showed that he considered himself to be worth over
one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and he is only a
little over thirtyfour years old today How much was he worth at the
time he first entered business relations with the excity treasurer
Have you any idea I can tell I had the matter looked up almost a month
ago on my accession to office Just a little over two hundred thousand
dollars gentlemenjust a little over two hundred thousand dollars
Here is an abstract from the files of Dun  Company for that year Now
you can see how rapidly our Caesar has grown in wealth since then
You can see how profitable these few short years have been to him Was
George W Stener worth any such sum up to the time he was removed from
his office and indicted for embezzlement Was he I have here a schedule
of his liabilities and assets made out at the time You can see it for
yourselves gentlemen Just two hundred and twenty thousand dollars
measured the sum of all his property three weeks ago and it is an
accurate estimate as I have reason to know Why was it do you suppose
that Mr Cowperwood grew so fast in wealth and Mr Stener so slowly
They were partners in crime Mr Stener was loaning Mr Cowperwood vast
sums of the citys money at two per cent when callrates for money in
Third Street were sometimes as high as sixteen and seventeen per cent
Dont you suppose that Mr Cowperwood sitting there knew how to use this
very cheaply comeby money to the very best advantage Does he look to
you as though he didnt You have seen him on the witnessstand You
have heard him testify Very suave very straightforwardseeming very
innocent doing everything as a favor to Mr Stener and his friends of
course and yet making a million in a little over six years and allowing
Mr Stener to make one hundred and sixty thousand dollars or less
for Mr Stener had some little money at the time this partnership was
entered intoa few thousand dollars

Shannon now came to the vital transaction of October 9th when
Cowperwood called on Stener and secured the check for sixty thousand
dollars from Albert Stires His scorn for this as he appeared to think
subtle and criminal transaction was unbounded It was plain larceny
stealing and Cowperwood knew it when he asked Stires for the check

Think of it Shannon exclaimed turning and looking squarely at
Cowperwood who faced him quite calmly undisturbed and unashamed
Think of it Think of the colossal nerve of the manthe Machiavellian
subtlety of his brain He knew he was going to fail He knew after
two days of financial workafter two days of struggle to offset the
providential disaster which upset his nefarious schemesthat he had
exhausted every possible resource save one the city treasury and that
unless he could compel aid there he was going to fail He already owed
the city treasury five hundred thousand dollars He had already used the
city treasurer as a catspaw so much had involved him so deeply that
the latter because of the staggering size of the debt was becoming
frightened Did that deter Mr Cowperwood Not at all

He shook his finger ominously in Cowperwoods face and the latter
turned irritably away He is showing off for the benefit of his
future he whispered to Steger I wish you could tell the jury that

I wish I could replied Steger smiling scornfully but my hour is
over

Why continued Mr Shannon turning once more to the jury think of
the colossal wolfish nerve that would permit a man to say to Albert
Stires that he had just purchased sixty thousand dollars worth
additional of city loan and that he would then and there take the check
for it Had he actually purchased this city loan as he said he had
Who can tell Could any human being wind through all the mazes of the
complicated bookkeeping system which he ran and actually tell The best
answer to that is that if he did purchase the certificates he intended
that it should make no difference to the city for he made no effort
to put the certificates in the sinkingfund where they belonged His
counsel says and he says that he didnt have to until the first of
the month although the law says that he must do it at once and he knew
well enough that legally he was bound to do it His counsel says and he
says that he didnt know he was going to fail Hence there was no need
of worrying about it I wonder if any of you gentlemen really believed
that Had he ever asked for a check like that so quick before in his
life In all the history of these nefarious transactions was there
another incident like that You know there wasnt He had never before
on any occasion asked personally for a check for anything in this
office and yet on this occasion he did it Why Why should he ask for
it this time A few hours more according to his own statement wouldnt
have made any difference one way or the other would it He could have
sent a boy for it as usual That was the way it had always been done
before Why anything different now Ill tell you why Shannon suddenly
shouted varying his voice tremendously Ill tell you why He knew
that he was a ruined man He knew that his last semilegitimate avenue
of escapethe favor of George W Stenerhad been closed to him He
knew that honestly by open agreement he could not extract another
single dollar from the treasury of the city of Philadelphia He knew
that if he left the office without this check and sent a boy for it the
aroused city treasurer would have time to inform his clerks and
that then no further money could be obtained Thats why Thats why
gentlemen if you really want to know

Now gentlemen of the jury I am about done with my arraignment of this
fine honorable virtuous citizen whom the counsel for the defense
Mr Steger tells you you cannot possibly convict without doing a
great injustice All I have to say is that you look to me like sane
intelligent menjust the sort of men that I meet everywhere in the
ordinary walks of life doing an honorable American business in
an honorable American way Now gentlemen of the jury he was very
softspoken now all I have to say is that if after all you have heard
and seen here today you still think that Mr Frank A Cowperwood is
an honest honorable manthat he didnt steal willfully and knowingly
sixty thousand dollars from the Philadelphia city treasury that he had
actually bought the certificates he said he had and had intended to put
them in the sinkingfund as he said he did then dont you dare to do
anything except turn him loose and that speedily so that he can go
on back today into Third Street and start to straighten out his
muchentangled financial affairs It is the only thing for honest
conscientious men to doto turn him instantly loose into the heart of
this community so that some of the rank injustice that my opponent Mr
Steger alleges has been done him will be a little made up to him You
owe him if that is the way you feel a prompt acknowledgment of his
innocence Dont worry about George W Stener His guilt is established
by his own confession He admits he is guilty He will be sentenced
without trial later on But this manhe says he is an honest honorable
man He says he didnt think he was going to fail He says he used all
that threatening compelling terrifying language not because he was
in danger of failing but because he didnt want the bother of looking
further for aid What do you think Do you really think that he
had purchased sixty thousand dollars more of certificates for the
sinkingfund and that he was entitled to the money If so why didnt
he put them in the sinkingfund Theyre not there now and the sixty
thousand dollars is gone Who got it The Girard National Bank where he
was overdrawn to the extent of one hundred thousand dollars Did it get
it and forty thousand dollars more in other checks and certificates
Certainly Why Do you suppose the Girard National Bank might be in any
way grateful for this last little favor before he closed his doors Do
you think that President Davison whom you saw here testifying so kindly
in this case feels at all friendly and that that may possiblyI
dont say that it doesexplain his very kindly interpretation of Mr
Cowperwoods condition It might be You can think as well along that
line as I can Anyhow gentlemen President Davison says Mr Cowperwood
is an honorable honest man and so does his counsel Mr Steger You
have heard the testimony Now you think it over If you want to turn him
looseturn him loose He waved his hand wearily Youre the judges
I wouldnt but then I am merely a hardworking lawyerone person one
opinion You may think differentlythats your business He waved his
hand suggestively almost contemptuously However Im through and I
thank you for your courtesy Gentlemen the decision rests with you

He turned away grandly and the jury stirredso did the idle spectators
in the court Judge Payderson sighed a sigh of relief It was now quite
dark and the flaring gas forms in the court were all brightly lighted
Outside one could see that it was snowing The judge stirred among his
papers wearily and turning to the jurors solemnly began his customary
explanation of the law after which they filed out to the juryroom

Cowperwood turned to his father who now came over across the
fastemptying court and said

Well well know now in a little while

Yes replied Cowperwood Sr a little wearily I hope it comes out
right I saw Butler back there a little while ago

Did you queried Cowperwood to whom this had a peculiar interest

Yes replied his father Hes just gone

So Cowperwood thought Butler was curious enough as to his fate to want
to come here and watch him tried Shannon was his tool Judge Payderson
was his emissary in a way He Cowperwood might defeat him in the
matter of his daughter but it was not so easy to defeat him here
unless the jury should happen to take a sympathetic attitude They might
convict him and then Butlers Judge Payderson would have the privilege
of sentencing himgiving him the maximum sentence That would not be so
nicefive years He cooled a little as he thought of it but there was
no use worrying about what had not yet happened Steger came forward and
told him that his bail was now endedhad been the moment the jury left
the roomand that he was at this moment actually in the care of
the sheriff of whom he knewSheriff Adlai Jaspers Unless he were
acquitted by the jury Steger added he would have to remain in the
sheriffs care until an application for a certificate of reasonable
doubt could be made and acted upon

It would take all of five days Frank Steger said but Jaspers isnt
a bad sort Hed be reasonable Of course if were lucky you wont have
to visit him You will have to go with this bailiff now though Then if
things come out right well go home Say Id like to win this case
he said Id like to give them the laugh and see you do it I consider
youve been pretty badly treated and I think I made that perfectly
clear I can reverse this verdict on a dozen grounds if they happen to
decide against you

He and Cowperwood and the latters father now stalked off with the
sheriffs subordinatea small man by the name of Eddie Zanders who
had approached to take charge They entered a small room called the pen
at the back of the court where all those on trial whose liberty had
been forfeited by the jurys leaving the room had to wait pending its
return It was a dreary highceiled foursquare place with a window
looking out into Chestnut Street and a second door leading off into
somewhereone had no idea where It was dingy with a worn wooden
floor some heavy plain wooden benches lining the four sides no
pictures or ornaments of any kind A single twoarm gaspipe descended
from the center of the ceiling It was permeated by a peculiarly stale
and pungent odor obviously redolent of all the flotsam and jetsam of
lifecriminal and innocentthat had stood or sat in here from time to
time waiting patiently to learn what a deliberating fate held in store

Cowperwood was of course disgusted but he was too selfreliant
and capable to show it All his life he had been immaculate almost
fastidious in his care of himself Here he was coming perforce in
contact with a form of life which jarred upon him greatly Steger who
was beside him made some comforting explanatory apologetic remarks

Not as nice as it might be he said but you wont mind waiting a
little while The jury wont be long I fancy

That may not help me he replied walking to the window Afterward he
added What must be must be

His father winced Suppose Frank was on the verge of a long prison term
which meant an atmosphere like this Heavens For a moment he trembled
then for the first time in years he made a silent prayer





Chapter XLIV


Meanwhile the great argument had been begun in the juryroom and all
the points that had been meditatively speculated upon in the jurybox
were now being openly discussed

It is amazingly interesting to see how a jury will waver and speculate
in a case like thishow curious and uncertain is the process by which
it makes up its socalled mind Socalled truth is a nebulous thing at
best facts are capable of such curious inversion and interpretation
honest and otherwise The jury had a strongly complicated problem before
it and it went over it and over it

Juries reach not so much definite conclusions as verdicts in a curious
fashion and for curious reasons Very often a jury will have concluded
little so far as its individual members are concerned and yet it will
have reached a verdict The matter of time as all lawyers know plays
a part in this Juries speaking of the members collectively and
frequently individually object to the amount of time it takes to decide
a case They do not enjoy sitting and deliberating over a problem unless
it is tremendously fascinating The ramifications or the mystery of a
syllogism can become a weariness and a bore The juryroom itself may
and frequently does become a dull agony

On the other hand no jury contemplates a disagreement with any degree
of satisfaction There is something so inherently constructive in the
human mind that to leave a problem unsolved is plain misery It haunts
the average individual like any other important task left unfinished
Men in a juryroom like those scientifically demonstrated atoms of a
crystal which scientists and philosophers love to speculate upon like
finally to arrange themselves into an orderly and artistic whole to
present a compact intellectual front to be whatever they have set out
to be properly and rightlya compact sensible jury One sees this
same instinct magnificently displayed in every other phase of naturein
the drifting of seawood to the Sargasso Sea in the geometric
interrelation of airbubbles on the surface of still water in the
marvelous unreasoned architecture of so many insects and atomic forms
which make up the substance and the texture of this world It would seem
as though the physical substance of lifethis apparition of form which
the eye detects and calls real were shot through with some vast subtlety
that loves order that is order The atoms of our socalled being in
spite of our socalled reasonthe dreams of a moodknow where to go
and what to do They represent an order a wisdom a willing that is not
of us They build orderly in spite of us So the subconscious spirit
of a jury At the same time one does not forget the strange hypnotic
effect of one personality on another the varying effects of varying
types on each other until a solutionto use the word in its purely
chemical senseis reached In a juryroom the thought or determination
of one or two or three men if it be definite enough is likely to
pervade the whole room and conquer the reason or the opposition of the
majority One man standing out for the definite thought that is in him
is apt to become either the triumphant leader of a pliant mass or the
brutally battered target of a flaming concentrated intellectual fire
Men despise dull opposition that is without reason In a juryroom of
all places a man is expected to give a reason for the faith that is in
himif one is demanded It will not do to say I cannot agree Jurors
have been known to fight Bitter antagonisms lasting for years have been
generated in these close quarters Recalcitrant jurors have been hounded
commercially in their local spheres for their unreasoned oppositions or
conclusions

After reaching the conclusion that Cowperwood unquestionably deserved
some punishment there was wrangling as to whether the verdict should be
guilty on all four counts as charged in the indictment Since they did
not understand how to differentiate between the various charges very
well they decided it should be on all four and a recommendation to
mercy added Afterward this last was eliminated however either he was
guilty or he was not The judge could see as well as they could all the
extenuating circumstancesperhaps better Why tie his hands As a rule
no attention was paid to such recommendations anyhow and it only made
the jury look wabbly

So finally at ten minutes after twelve that night they were ready to
return a verdict and Judge Payderson who because of his interest in
the case and the fact that he lived not so far away had decided to wait
up this long was recalled Steger and Cowperwood were sent for
The courtroom was fully lighted The bailiff the clerk and the
stenographer were there The jury filed in and Cowperwood with Steger
at his right took his position at the gate which gave into the railed
space where prisoners always stand to hear the verdict and listen to any
commentary of the judge He was accompanied by his father who was very
nervous

For the first time in his life he felt as though he were walking in
his sleep Was this the real Frank Cowperwood of two months beforeso
wealthy so progressive so sure Was this only December 5th or 6th now
it was after midnight Why was it the jury had deliberated so long
What did it mean Here they were now standing and gazing solemnly
before them and here now was Judge Payderson mounting the steps of his
rostrum his frizzled hair standing out in a strange attractive
way his familiar bailiff rapping for order He did not look at
Cowperwoodit would not be courteousbut at the jury who gazed at him
in return At the words of the clerk Gentlemen of the jury have you
agreed upon a verdict the foreman spoke up We have

Do you find the defendant guilty or not guilty

We find the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment

How had they come to do this Because he had taken a check for sixty
thousand dollars which did not belong to him But in reality it did
Good Lord what was sixty thousand dollars in the sum total of all the
money that had passed back and forth between him and George W Stener
Nothing nothing A mere bagatelle in its way and yet here it had
risen up this miserable insignificant check and become a mountain of
opposition a stone wall a prisonwall barring his further progress It
was astonishing He looked around him at the courtroom How large and
bare and cold it was Still he was Frank A Cowperwood Why should he
let such queer thoughts disturb him His fight for freedom and privilege
and restitution was not over yet Good heavens It had only begun In
five days he would be out again on bail Steger would take an appeal
He would be out and he would have two long months in which to make an
additional fight He was not down yet He would win his liberty This
jury was all wrong A higher court would say so It would reverse their
verdict and he knew it He turned to Steger where the latter was
having the clerk poll the jury in the hope that some one juror had been
overpersuaded made to vote against his will

Is that your verdict he heard the clerk ask of Philip Moultrie juror
No 1

It is replied that worthy solemnly

Is that your verdict The clerk was pointing to Simon Glassberg

Yes sir

Is that your verdict He pointed to Fletcher Norton

Yes

So it went through the whole jury All the men answered firmly and
clearly though Steger thought it might barely be possible that one
would have changed his mind The judge thanked them and told them that
in view of their long services this night they were dismissed for the
term The only thing remaining to be done now was for Steger to persuade
Judge Payderson to grant a stay of sentence pending the hearing of a
motion by the State Supreme Court for a new trial

The Judge looked at Cowperwood very curiously as Steger made this
request in proper form and owing to the importance of the case and
the feeling he had that the Supreme Court might very readily grant
a certificate of reasonable doubt in this case he agreed There was
nothing left therefore but for Cowperwood to return at this late hour
with the deputy sheriff to the county jail where he must now remain for
five days at leastpossibly longer

The jail in question which was known locally as Moyamensing Prison
was located at Tenth and Reed Streets and from an architectural and
artistic point of view was not actually displeasing to the eye It
consisted of a central portionprison residence for the sheriff or
what you willthree stories high with a battlemented cornice and a
round battlemented tower about onethird as high as the central portion
itself and two wings each two stories high with battlemented turrets
at either end giving it a highly castellated and consequently from the
American point of view a very prisonlike appearance The facade of the
prison which was not more than thirtyfive feet high for the central
portion nor more than twentyfive feet for the wings was set back at
least a hundred feet from the street and was continued at either end
from the wings to the end of the street block by a stone wall all of
twenty feet high The structure was not severely prisonlike for the
central portion was pierced by rather large unbarred apertures hung on
the two upper stories with curtains and giving the whole front a
rather pleasant and residential air The wing to the right as one stood
looking in from the street was the section known as the county jail
proper and was devoted to the care of prisoners serving shortterm
sentences on some judicial order The wing to the left was devoted
exclusively to the care and control of untried prisoners The whole
building was built of a smooth lightcolored stone which on a snowy
night like this with the few lamps that were used in it glowing
feebly in the dark presented an eery fantastic almost supernatural
appearance

It was a rough and blowy night when Cowperwood started for this
institution under duress The wind was driving the snow before it in
curious interesting whirls Eddie Zanders the sheriffs deputy on
guard at the court of Quarter Sessions accompanied him and his father
and Steger Zanders was a little man dark with a short stubby
mustache and a shrewd though not highly intelligent eye He was anxious
first to uphold his dignity as a deputy sheriff which was a very
important position in his estimation and next to turn an honest penny
if he could He knew little save the details of his small world which
consisted of accompanying prisoners to and from the courts and the
jails and seeing that they did not get away He was not unfriendly to
a particular type of prisonerthe welltodo or moderately
prosperousfor he had long since learned that it paid to be so
Tonight he offered a few sociable suggestionsviz that it was rather
rough that the jail was not so far but that they could walk and that
Sheriff Jaspers would in all likelihood be around or could be aroused
Cowperwood scarcely heard He was thinking of his mother and his wife
and of Aileen

When the jail was reached he was led to the central portion as it was
here that the sheriff Adlai Jaspers had his private office Jaspers
had recently been elected to office and was inclined to conform to all
outward appearances in so far as the proper conduct of his office was
concerned without in reality inwardly conforming Thus it was generally
known among the politicians that one way he had of fattening his rather
lean salary was to rent private rooms and grant special privileges to
prisoners who had the money to pay for the same Other sheriffs had done
it before him In fact when Jaspers was inducted into office several
prisoners were already enjoying these privileges and it was not a part
of his scheme of things to disturb them The rooms that he let to the
right parties as he invariably put it were in the central portion
of the jail where were his own private living quarters They were
unbarred and not at all celllike There was no particular danger of
escape for a guard stood always at his private door instructed to
keep an eye on the general movements of all the inmates A prisoner so
accommodated was in many respects quite a free person His meals were
served to him in his room if he wished He could read or play cards or
receive guests and if he had any favorite musical instrument that was
not denied him There was just one rule that had to be complied with If
he were a public character and any newspaper men called he had to be
brought downstairs into the private interviewing room in order that
they might not know that he was not confined in a cell like any other
prisoner

Nearly all of these facts had been brought to Cowperwoods attention
beforehand by Steger but for all that when he crossed the threshold of
the jail a peculiar sensation of strangeness and defeat came over him
He and his party were conducted to a little office to the left of
the entrance where were only a desk and a chair dimly lighted by
a lowburning gasjet Sheriff Jaspers rotund and ruddy met them
greeting them in quite a friendly way Zanders was dismissed and went
briskly about his affairs

A bad night isnt it observed Jaspers turning up the gas and
preparing to go through the routine of registering his prisoner Steger
came over and held a short private conversation with him in his corner
over his desk which resulted presently in the sheriffs face lighting
up

Oh certainly certainly Thats all right Mr Steger to be sure
Why certainly

Cowperwood eyeing the fat sheriff from his position understood what
it was all about He had regained completely his critical attitude his
cool intellectual poise So this was the jail and this was the fat
mediocrity of a sheriff who was to take care of him Very good He
would make the best of it He wondered whether he was to be
searchedprisoners usually werebut he soon discovered that he was not
to be

Thats all right Mr Cowperwood said Jaspers getting up I guess
I can make you comfortable after a fashion Were not running a hotel
here as you knowhe chuckled to himselfbut I guess I can make you
comfortable John he called to a sleepy factotum who appeared from
another room rubbing his eyes is the key to Number Six down here

Yes sir

Let me have it

John disappeared and returned while Steger explained to Cowperwood that
anything he wanted in the way of clothing etc could be brought in
Steger himself would stop round next morning and confer with him as
would any of the members of Cowperwoods family whom he wished to see
Cowperwood immediately explained to his father his desire for as little
of this as possible Joseph or Edward might come in the morning and
bring a grip full of underwear etc but as for the others let them
wait until he got out or had to remain permanently He did think of
writing Aileen cautioning her to do nothing but the sheriff now
beckoned and he quietly followed Accompanied by his father and Steger
he ascended to his new room

It was a simple whitewalled chamber fifteen by twenty feet in size
rather highceiled supplied with a highbacked yellow wooden bed
a yellow bureau a small imitationcherry table three very ordinary
caneseated chairs with carved hickoryrod backs cherrystained also
and a washstand of yellowstained wood to match the bed containing
a washbasin a pitcher a soapdish uncovered and a small cheap
pinkflowered tooth and shaving brush mug which did not match the
other ware and which probably cost ten cents The value of this room
to Sheriff Jaspers was what he could get for it in cases like
thistwentyfive to thirtyfive dollars a week Cowperwood would pay
thirtyfive

Cowperwood walked briskly to the window which gave out on the lawn in
front now embedded in snow and said he thought this was all right
Both his father and Steger were willing and anxious to confer with him
for hours if he wished but there was nothing to say He did not wish
to talk

Let Ed bring in some fresh linen in the morning and a couple of suits
of clothes and I will be all right George can get my things together
He was referring to a family servant who acted as valet and in other
capacities Tell Lillian not to worry Im all right Id rather she
would not come here so long as Im going to be out in five days If Im
not it will be time enough then Kiss the kids for me And he smiled
goodnaturedly

After his unfulfilled predictions in regard to the result of this
preliminary trial Steger was almost afraid to suggest confidently
what the State Supreme Court would or would not do but he had to say
something

I dont think you need worry about what the outcome of my appeal will
be Frank Ill get a certificate of reasonable doubt and thats as
good as a stay of two months perhaps longer I dont suppose the bail
will be more than thirty thousand dollars at the outside Youll be out
again in five or six days whatever happens

Cowperwood said that he hoped so and suggested that they drop matters
for the night After a few fruitless parleys his father and Steger
finally said good night leaving him to his own private reflections He
was tired however and throwing off his clothes tucked himself in his
mediocre bed and was soon fast asleep





Chapter XLV


Say what one will about prison life in general modify it ever so much
by special chambers obsequious turnkeys a general tendency to make one
as comfortable as possible a jail is a jail and there is no getting
away from that Cowperwood in a room which was not in any way inferior
to that of the ordinary boardinghouse was nevertheless conscious of
the character of that section of this real prison which was not yet his
portion He knew that there were cells there probably greasy and smelly
and vermininfested and that they were enclosed by heavy iron bars
which would have as readily clanked on him as on those who were now
therein incarcerated if he had not had the price to pay for something
better So much for the alleged equality of man he thought which gave
to one man even within the grim confines of the machinery of justice
such personal liberty as he himself was now enjoying and to another
because he chanced to lack wit or presence or friends or wealth denied
the more comfortable things which money would buy

The morning after the trial on waking he stirred curiously and
then it suddenly came to him that he was no longer in the free and
comfortable atmosphere of his own bedroom but in a jailcell or rather
its very comfortable substitute a sheriffs rented bedroom He got up
and looked out the window The ground outside and Passayunk Avenue
were white with snow Some wagons were silently lumbering by A few
Philadelphians were visible here and there going to and fro on morning
errands He began to think at once what he must do how he must act
to carry on his business to rehabilitate himself and as he did so he
dressed and pulled the bellcord which had been indicated to him and
which would bring him an attendant who would build him a fire and later
bring him something to eat A shabby prison attendant in a blue uniform
conscious of Cowperwoods superiority because of the room he occupied
laid wood and coal in the grate and started a fire and later brought
him his breakfast which was anything but prison fare though poor
enough at that

After that he was compelled to wait in patience several hours in spite
of the sheriffs assumption of solicitous interest before his brother
Edward was admitted with his clothes An attendant for a consideration
brought him the morning papers and these except for the financial
news he read indifferently Late in the afternoon Steger arrived
saying he had been busy having certain proceedings postponed but that
he had arranged with the sheriff for Cowperwood to be permitted to see
such of those as had important business with him

By this time Cowperwood had written Aileen under no circumstances to
try to see him as he would be out by the tenth and that either that
day or shortly after they would meet As he knew she wanted greatly
to see him but he had reason to believe she was under surveillance by
detectives employed by her father This was not true but it was preying
on her fancy and combined with some derogatory remarks dropped by Owen
and Callum at the dinner table recently had proved almost too much for
her fiery disposition But because of Cowperwoods letter reaching her
at the Calligans she made no move until she read on the morning of the
tenth that Cowperwoods plea for a certificate of reasonable doubt had
been granted and that he would once more for the time being at least
be a free man This gave her courage to do what she had long wanted to
do and that was to teach her father that she could get along without
him and that he could not make her do anything she did not want to do
She still had the two hundred dollars Cowperwood had given her and some
additional cash of her ownperhaps three hundred and fifty dollars in
all This she thought would be sufficient to see her to the end of her
adventure or at least until she could make some other arrangement for
her personal wellbeing From what she knew of the feeling of her family
for her she felt that the agony would all be on their side not hers
Perhaps when her father saw how determined she was he would decide to
let her alone and make peace with her She was determined to try it
anyhow and immediately sent word to Cowperwood that she was going to
the Calligans and would welcome him to freedom

In a way Cowperwood was rather gratified by Aileens message for
he felt that his present plight bitter as it was was largely due to
Butlers opposition and he felt no compunction in striking him through
his daughter His former feeling as to the wisdom of not enraging Butler
had proved rather futile he thought and since the old man could not be
placated it might be just as well to have Aileen demonstrate to him that
she was not without resources of her own and could live without him She
might force him to change his attitude toward her and possibly even to
modify some of his political machinations against him Cowperwood Any
port in a stormand besides he had now really nothing to lose and
instinct told him that her move was likely to prove more favorable than
otherwiseso he did nothing to prevent it

She took her jewels some underwear a couple of dresses which she
thought would be serviceable and a few other things and packed them
in the most capacious portmanteau she had Shoes and stockings came into
consideration and despite her efforts she found that she could not
get in all that she wished Her nicest hat which she was determined to
take had to be carried outside She made a separate bundle of it
which was not pleasant to contemplate Still she decided to take it
She rummaged in a little drawer where she kept her money and jewels and
found the three hundred and fifty dollars and put it in her purse It
wasnt much as Aileen could herself see but Cowperwood would help
her If he did not arrange to take care of her and her father would not
relent she would have to get something to do Little she knew of the
steely face the world presents to those who have not been practically
trained and are not economically efficient She did not understand the
bitter reaches of life at all She waited humming for effect until she
heard her father go downstairs to dinner on this tenth day of December
then leaned over the upper balustrade to make sure that Owen Callum
Norah and her mother were at the table and that Katy the housemaid
was not anywhere in sight Then she slipped into her fathers den and
taking a note from inside her dress laid it on his desk and went out
It was addressed to Father and read

 Dear FatherI just cannot do what you want me to I have
 made up my mind that I love Mr Cowperwood too much so I am
 going away Dont look for me with him You wont find me
 where you think I am not going to him I will not be
 there I am going to try to get along by myself for a
 while until he wants me and can marry me Im terribly
 sorry but I just cant do what you want I cant ever
 forgive you for the way you acted to me Tell mama and Norah
 and the boys goodby for me

 Aileen

To insure its discovery she picked up Butlers heavyrimmed spectacles
which he employed always when reading and laid them on it For a moment
she felt very strange somewhat like a thiefa new sensation for
her She even felt a momentary sense of ingratitude coupled with pain
Perhaps she was doing wrong Her father had been very good to her Her
mother would feel so very bad Norah would be sorry and Callum and
Owen Still they did not understand her any more She was resentful of
her fathers attitude He might have seen what the point was but no he
was too old too hidebound in religion and conventional ideashe never
would He might never let her come back Very well she would get along
somehow She would show him She might get a place as a schoolteacher
and live with the Calligans a long while if necessary or teach music

She stole downstairs and out into the vestibule opening the outer door
and looking out into the street The lamps were already flaring in the
dark and a cool wind was blowing Her portmanteau was heavy but she
was quite strong She walked briskly to the corner which was some fifty
feet away and turned south walking rather nervously and irritably for
this was a new experience for her and it all seemed so undignified so
unlike anything she was accustomed to doing She put her bag down on
a street corner finally to rest A boy whistling in the distance
attracted her attention and as he drew near she called to him Boy
Oh boy

He came over looking at her curiously

Do you want to earn some money

Yes maam he replied politely adjusting a frowsy cap over one ear

Carry this bag for me said Aileen and he picked it up and marched
off

In due time she arrived at the Calligans and amid much excitement was
installed in the bosom of her new home She took her situation with
much nonchalance once she was properly placed distributing her toilet
articles and those of personal wear with quiet care The fact that she
was no longer to have the services of Kathleen the maid who had served
her and her mother and Norah jointly was odd though not trying She
scarcely felt that she had parted from these luxuries permanently and
so made herself comfortable

Mamie Calligan and her mother were adoring slaveys so she was not
entirely out of the atmosphere which she craved and to which she was
accustomed





Chapter XLVI


Meanwhile in the Butler home the family was assembling for dinner Mrs
Butler was sitting in rotund complacency at the foot of the table her
gray hair combed straight back from her round shiny forehead She had
on a darkgray silk dress trimmed with grayandwhite striped ribbon
It suited her florid temperament admirably Aileen had dictated her
mothers choice and had seen that it had been properly made Norah was
refreshingly youthful in a palegreen dress with redvelvet cuffs and
collar She looked young slender gay Her eyes complexion and hair
were fresh and healthy She was trifling with a string of coral beads
which her mother had just given her

Oh look Callum she said to her brother opposite her who was
drumming idly on the table with his knife and fork Arent they lovely
Mama gave them to me

Mama does more for you than I would You know what youd get from me
dont you

What

He looked at her teasingly For answer Norah made a face at him Just
then Owen came in and took his place at the table Mrs Butler saw
Norahs grimace

Well thatll win no love from your brother ye can depend on that
she commented

Lord what a day observed Owen wearily unfolding his napkin Ive
had my fill of work for once

Whats the trouble queried his mother feelingly

No real trouble mother he replied Just everythingducks and
drakes thats all

Well ye must ate a good hearty meal now and thatll refresh ye
observed his mother genially and feelingly Thompsonshe was
referring to the family grocerbrought us the last of his beans You
must have some of those

Sure beansll fix it whatever it is Owen joked Callum Mothers
got the answer

Theyre fine Id have ye know replied Mrs Butler quite unconscious
of the joke

No doubt of it mother replied Callum Real brainfood Lets feed
some to Norah

Youd better eat some yourself smarty My but youre gay I suppose
youre going out to see somebody Thats why

Right you are Norah Smart girl you Five or six Ten to fifteen
minutes each Id call on you if you were nicer

You would if you got the chance mocked Norah Id have you know I
wouldnt let you Id feel very bad if I couldnt get somebody better
than you

As good as you mean corrected Callum

Children children interpolated Mrs Butler calmly looking about
for old John the servant Youll be losin your tempers in a minute
Hush now Here comes your father Wheres Aileen

Butler walked heavily in and took his seat

John the servant appeared bearing a platter of beans among other
things and Mrs Butler asked him to send some one to call Aileen

Its gettin colder Im thinkin said Butler by way of
conversation and eyeing Aileens empty chair She would come soon
nowhis heavy problem He had been very tactful these last two
monthsavoiding any reference to Cowperwood in so far as he could help
in her presence

Its colder remarked Owen much colder Well soon see real winter
now

Old John began to offer the various dishes in order but when all had
been served Aileen had not yet come

See where Aileen is John observed Mrs Butler interestedly The
meal will be gettin cold

Old John returned with the news that Aileen was not in her room

Sure she must be somewhere commented Mrs Butler only slightly
perplexed Shell be comin though never mind if she wants to She
knows its mealtime

The conversation drifted from a new waterworks that was being planned
to the new city hall then nearing completion Cowperwoods financial
and social troubles and the state of the stock market generally a new
goldmine in Arizona the departure of Mrs Mollenhauer the following
Tuesday for Europe with appropriate comments by Norah and Callum and a
Christmas ball that was going to be given for charity

Aileenll be wantin to go to that commented Mrs Butler

Im going you bet put in Norah

Whos going to take you asked Callum

Thats my affair mister she replied smartly

The meal was over and Mrs Butler strolled up to Aileens room to see
why she had not come down to dinner Butler entered his den wishing so
much that he could take his wife into his confidence concerning all that
was worrying him On his desk as he sat down and turned up the light
he saw the note He recognized Aileens handwriting at once What could
she mean by writing him A sense of the untoward came to him and
he tore it open slowly and putting on his glasses contemplated it
solemnly

So Aileen was gone The old man stared at each word as if it had been
written in fire She said she had not gone with Cowperwood It was
possible just the same that he had run away from Philadelphia and
taken her with him This was the last straw This ended it Aileen
lured away from hometo whereto what Butler could scarcely believe
though that Cowperwood had tempted her to do this He had too much at
stake it would involve his own and Butlers families The papers would
be certain to get it quickly He got up crumpling the paper in his
hand and turned about at a noise His wife was coming in He pulled
himself together and shoved the letter in his pocket

Aileens not in her room she said curiously She didnt say
anything to you about going out did she

No he replied truthfully wondering how soon he should have to tell
his wife

Thats odd observed Mrs Butler doubtfully She must have gone out
after somethin Its a wonder she wouldnt tell somebody

Butler gave no sign He dared not Shell be back he said more in
order to gain time than anything else He was sorry to have to pretend
Mrs Butler went out and he closed the door Then he took out
the letter and read it again The girl was crazy She was doing an
absolutely wild inhuman senseless thing Where could she go except
to Cowperwood She was on the verge of a public scandal and this would
produce it There was just one thing to do as far as he could see
Cowperwood if he were still in Philadelphia would know He would go to
himthreaten cajole actually destroy him if necessary Aileen must
come back She need not go to Europe perhaps but she must come back
and behave herself at least until Cowperwood could legitimately marry
her That was all he could expect now She would have to wait and some
day perhaps he could bring himself to accept her wretched proposition
Horrible thought It would kill her mother disgrace her sister He got
up took down his hat put on his overcoat and started out

Arriving at the Cowperwood home he was shown into the receptionroom
Cowperwood at the time was in his den looking over some private papers
When the name of Butler was announced he immediately went downstairs
It was characteristic of the man that the announcement of Butlers
presence created no stir in him whatsoever So Butler had come That
meant of course that Aileen had gone Now for a battle not of words
but of weights of personalities He felt himself to be intellectually
socially and in every other way the more powerful man of the two That
spiritual content of him which we call life hardened to the texture of
steel He recalled that although he had told his wife and his father
that the politicians of whom Butler was one were trying to make a
scapegoat of him Butler nevertheless was not considered to be wholly
alienated as a friend and civility must prevail He would like very
much to placate him if he could to talk out the hard facts of life in a
quiet and friendly way But this matter of Aileen had to be adjusted now
once and for all And with that thought in his mind he walked quickly
into Butlers presence

The old man when he learned that Cowperwood was in and would see him
determined to make his contact with the financier as short and effective
as possible He moved the least bit when he heard Cowperwoods step as
light and springy as ever

Good evening Mr Butler said Cowperwood cheerfully when he saw
him extending his hand What can I do for you

Ye can take that away from in front of me for one thing said Butler
grimly referring to his hand I have no need of it Its my daughter
Ive come to talk to ye about and I want plain answers Where is she

You mean Aileen said Cowperwood looking at him with steady curious
unrevealing eyes and merely interpolating this to obtain a moment for
reflection What can I tell you about her

Ye can tell me where she is that I know And ye can make her come back
to her home where she belongs It was bad fortune that ever brought ye
across my doorstep but Ill not bandy words with ye here Yell tell me
where my daughter is and yell leave her alone from now or Ill The
old mans fists closed like a vise and his chest heaved with suppressed
rage Yell not be drivin me too far man if yere wise he added
after a time recovering his equanimity in part I want no truck with
ye I want my daughter

Listen Mr Butler said Cowperwood quite calmly relishing the
situation for the sheer sense of superiority it gave him I want to
be perfectly frank with you if you will let me I may know where your
daughter is and I may not I may wish to tell you and I may not She
may not wish me to But unless you wish to talk with me in a civil way
there is no need of our going on any further You are privileged to do
what you like Wont you come upstairs to my room We can talk more
comfortably there

Butler looked at his former protege in utter astonishment He had
never before in all his experience come up against a more ruthless
typesuave bland forceful unterrified This man had certainly
come to him as a sheep and had turned out to be a ravening wolf His
incarceration had not put him in the least awe

Ill not come up to your room Butler said and yell not get out of
Philadelphy with her if thats what yere plannin I can see to that
Ye think ye have the upper hand of me I see and yere anxious to make
something of it Well yere not It wasnt enough that ye come to me
as a beggar cravin the help of me and that I took ye in and helped ye
all I couldye had to steal my daughter from me in the bargain If it
wasnt for the girls mother and her sister and her brothersdacenter
men than ever yell know how to beId brain ye where ye stand Takin
a young innocent girl and makin an evil woman out of her and ye a
married man Its a Gods blessin for ye that its me and not one of
me sons thats here talkin to ye or ye wouldnt be alive to say what
yed do

The old man was grim but impotent in his rage

Im sorry Mr Butler replied Cowperwood quietly Im willing to
explain but you wont let me Im not planning to run away with your
daughter nor to leave Philadelphia You ought to know me well enough to
know that Im not contemplating anything of that kind my interests are
too large You and I are practical men We ought to be able to talk
this matter over together and reach an understanding I thought once
of coming to you and explaining this but I was quite sure you wouldnt
listen to me Now that you are here I would like to talk to you If you
will come up to my room I will be glad tootherwise not Wont you come
up

Butler saw that Cowperwood had the advantage He might as well go up
Otherwise it was plain he would get no information

Very well he said

Cowperwood led the way quite amicably and having entered his private
office closed the door behind him

We ought to be able to talk this matter over and reach an
understanding he said again when they were in the room and he had
closed the door I am not as bad as you think though I know I appear
very bad Butler stared at him in contempt I love your daughter and
she loves me I know you are asking yourself how I can do this while
I am still married but I assure you I can and that I do I am not
happily married I had expected if this panic hadnt come along to
arrange with my wife for a divorce and marry Aileen My intentions are
perfectly good The situation which you can complain of of course is
the one you encountered a few weeks ago It was indiscreet but it was
entirely human Your daughter does not complainshe understands At
the mention of his daughter in this connection Butler flushed with rage
and shame but he controlled himself

And ye think because she doesnt complain that its all right do ye
he asked sarcastically

From my point of view yes from yours no You have one view of life
Mr Butler and I have another

Yere right there put in Butler for once anyhow

That doesnt prove that either of us is right or wrong In my judgment
the present end justifies the means The end I have in view is to marry
Aileen If I can possibly pull myself out of this financial scrape that
I am in I will do so Of course I would like to have your consent
for thatso would Aileen but if we cant we cant Cowperwood was
thinking that while this might not have a very soothing effect on the
old contractors point of view nevertheless it must make some appeal to
his sense of the possible or necessary Aileens present situation
was quite unsatisfactory without marriage in view And even if he
Cowperwood was a convicted embezzler in the eyes of the public that
did not make him so He might get free and restore himselfwould
certainlyand Aileen ought to be glad to marry him if she could
under the circumstances He did not quite grasp the depth of Butlers
religious and moral prejudices Lately he went on you have been
doing all you can as I understand it to pull me down on account of
Aileen I suppose but that is simply delaying what I want to do

Yed like me to help ye do that I suppose suggested Butler with
infinite disgust and patience

I want to marry Aileen Cowperwood repeated for emphasis sake She
wants to marry me Under the circumstances however you may feel you
can have no real objection to my doing that I am sure yet you go on
fighting memaking it hard for me to do what you really know ought to
be done

Yere a scoundrel said Butler seeing through his motives quite
clearly Yere a sharper to my way of thinkin and its no child of
mine I want connected with ye Im not sayin seein that things are
as they are that if ye were a free man it wouldnt be better that she
should marry ye Its the one dacent thing ye could doif ye would
which I doubt But thats nayther here nor there now What can ye want
with her hid away somewhere Ye cant marry her Ye cant get a divorce
Yeve got your hands full fightin your lawsuits and kapin yourself out
of jail Shell only be an added expense to ye and yell be wantin all
the money ye have for other things Im thinkin Why should ye want to
be takin her away from a dacent home and makin something out of her
that yed be ashamed to marry if you could The laist ye could do if
ye were any kind of a man at all and had any of that thing that yere
plased to call love would be to lave her at home and keep her as
respectable as possible Mind ye Im not thinkin she isnt ten
thousand times too good for ye whatever yeve made of her But if ye
had any sinse of dacency left ye wouldnt let her shame her family and
break her old mothers heart and that for no purpose except to make
her worse than she is already What good can ye get out of it now What
good can ye expect to come of it Be hivins if ye had any sinse at all
I should think ye could see that for yerself Yere only addin to your
troubles not takin away from themand shell not thank ye for that
later on

He stopped rather astonished that he should have been drawn into an
argument His contempt for this man was so great that he could
scarcely look at him but his duty and his need was to get Aileen back
Cowperwood looked at him as one who gives serious attention to another
He seemed to be thinking deeply over what Butler had said

To tell you the truth Mr Butler he said I did not want Aileen to
leave your home at all and she will tell you so if you ever talk
to her about it I did my best to persuade her not to and when she
insisted on going the only thing I could do was to be sure she would
be comfortable wherever she went She was greatly outraged to think you
should have put detectives on her trail That and the fact that you
wanted to send her away somewhere against her will was the principal
reasons for her leaving I assure you I did not want her to go I think
you forget sometimes Mr Butler that Aileen is a grown woman and
that she has a will of her own You think I control her to her great
disadvantage As a matter of fact I am very much in love with her and
have been for three or four years and if you know anything about love
you know that it doesnt always mean control Im not doing Aileen any
injustice when I say that she has had as much influence on me as I have
had on her I love her and thats the cause of all the trouble You
come and insist that I shall return your daughter to you As a matter of
fact I dont know whether I can or not I dont know that she would go
if I wanted her to She might turn on me and say that I didnt care for
her any more That is not true and I would not want her to feel that
way She is greatly hurt as I told you by what you did to her and
the fact that you want her to leave Philadelphia You can do as much to
remedy that as I can I could tell you where she is but I do not know
that I want to Certainly not until I know what your attitude toward her
and this whole proposition is to be

He paused and looked calmly at the old contractor who eyed him grimly
in return

What proposition are ye talkin about asked Butler interested by
the peculiar developments of this argument In spite of himself he was
getting a slightly different angle on the whole situation The scene
was shifting to a certain extent Cowperwood appeared to be reasonably
sincere in the matter His promises might all be wrong but perhaps he
did love Aileen and it was possible that he did intend to get a divorce
from his wife some time and marry her Divorce as Butler knew was
against the rules of the Catholic Church which he so much revered The
laws of God and any sense of decency commanded that Cowperwood should
not desert his wife and children and take up with another womannot
even Aileen in order to save her It was a criminal thing to plan
sociologically speaking and showed what a villain Cowperwood inherently
was but nevertheless Cowperwood was not a Catholic his views of life
were not the same as his own Butlers and besides and worst of all no
doubt due in part to Aileens own temperament he had compromised her
situation very materially She might not easily be restored to a sense
of the normal and decent and so the matter was worth taking into
thought Butler knew that ultimately he could not countenance any such
thingcertainly not and keep his faith with the Churchbut he was
human enough none the less to consider it Besides he wanted Aileen to
come back and Aileen from now on he knew would have some say as to
what her future should be

Well its simple enough replied Cowperwood I should like to have
you withdraw your opposition to Aileens remaining in Philadelphia for
one thing and for another I should like you to stop your attacks
on me Cowperwood smiled in an ingratiating way He hoped really
to placate Butler in part by his generous attitude throughout this
procedure I cant make you do that of course unless you want to I
merely bring it up Mr Butler because I am sure that if it hadnt been
for Aileen you would not have taken the course you have taken toward me
I understood you received an anonymous letter and that afternoon you
called your loan with me Since then I have heard from one source and
another that you were strongly against me and I merely wish to say that
I wish you wouldnt be I am not guilty of embezzling any sixty thousand
dollars and you know it My intentions were of the best I did not
think I was going to fail at the time I used those certificates and
if it hadnt been for several other loans that were called I would have
gone on to the end of the month and put them back in time as I always
had I have always valued your friendship very highly and I am very
sorry to lose it Now I have said all I am going to say

Butler looked at Cowperwood with shrewd calculating eyes The man had
some merit but much unconscionable evil in him Butler knew very well
how he had taken the check and a good many other things in connection
with it The manner in which he had played his cards tonight was on a
par with the way he had run to him on the night of the fire He was just
shrewd and calculating and heartless

Ill make ye no promise he said Tell me where my daughter is and
Ill think the matter over Ye have no claim on me now and I owe ye no
good turn But Ill think it over anyhow

Thats quite all right replied Cowperwood Thats all I can expect
But what about Aileen Do you expect her to leave Philadelphia

Not if she settles down and behaves herself but there must be an end
of this between you and her Shes disgracin her family and ruinin her
soul in the bargain And thats what you are doin with yours Itll
be time enough to talk about anything else when youre a free man More
than that Ill not promise

Cowperwood satisfied that this move on Aileens part had done her a
real service if it had not aided him especially was convinced that it
would be a good move for her to return to her home at once He could
not tell how his appeal to the State Supreme Court would eventuate His
motion for a new trial which was now to be made under the privilege of
the certificate of reasonable doubt might not be granted in which case
he would have to serve a term in the penitentiary If he were compelled
to go to the penitentiary she would be saferbetter off in the bosom of
her family His own hands were going to be exceedingly full for the
next two months until he knew how his appeal was coming out And after
thatwell after that he would fight on whatever happened

During all the time that Cowperwood had been arguing his case in this
fashion he had been thinking how he could adjust this compromise so as
to retain the affection of Aileen and not offend her sensibilities by
urging her to return He knew that she would not agree to give up seeing
him and he was not willing that she should Unless he had a good and
sufficient reason he would be playing a wretched part by telling Butler
where she was He did not intend to do so until he saw exactly how to do
itthe way that would make it most acceptable to Aileen He knew that
she would not long be happy where she was Her flight was due in part to
Butlers intense opposition to himself and in part to his determination
to make her leave Philadelphia and behave but this last was now in part
obviated Butler in spite of his words was no longer a stern Nemesis
He was a melting manvery anxious to find his daughter very willing
to forgive her He was whipped literally beaten at his own game and
Cowperwood could see it in the old mans eyes If he himself could talk
to Aileen personally and explain just how things were he felt sure he
could make her see that it would be to their mutual advantage for the
present at least to have the matter amicably settled The thing to do
was to make Butler wait somewherehere possiblywhile he went and
talked to her When she learned how things were she would probably
acquiesce

The best thing that I can do under the circumstances he said after a
time would be to see Aileen in two or three days and ask her what she
wishes to do I can explain the matter to her and if she wants to go
back she can I will promise to tell her anything that you say

Two or three days exclaimed Butler irritably Two or three
fiddlesticks She must come home tonight Her mother doesnt know shes
left the place yet Tonight is the time Ill go and fetch her meself
tonight

No that wont do said Cowperwood I shall have to go myself If you
wish to wait here I will see what can be done and let you know

Very well grunted Butler who was now walking up and down with his
hands behind his back But for Heavens sake be quick about it Theres
no time to lose He was thinking of Mrs Butler Cowperwood called the
servant ordered his runabout and told George to see that his private
office was not disturbed Then as Butler strolled to and fro in this
to him objectionable room Cowperwood drove rapidly away





Chapter XLVII


Although it was nearly eleven oclock when he arrived at the Calligans
Aileen was not yet in bed In her bedroom upstairs she was confiding
to Mamie and Mrs Calligan some of her social experiences when the bell
rang and Mrs Calligan went down and opened the door to Cowperwood

Miss Butler is here I believe he said Will you tell her that there
is some one here from her father Although Aileen had instructed that
her presence here was not to be divulged even to the members of her
family the force of Cowperwoods presence and the mention of Butlers
name cost Mrs Calligan her presence of mind Wait a moment she said
Ill see

She stepped back and Cowperwood promptly stepped in taking off his hat
with the air of one who was satisfied that Aileen was there Say to her
that I only want to speak to her for a few moments he called as Mrs
Calligan went upstairs raising his voice in the hope that Aileen might
hear She did and came down promptly She was very much astonished
to think that he should come so soon and fancied in her vanity that
there must be great excitement in her home She would have greatly
grieved if there had not been

The Calligans would have been pleased to hear but Cowperwood was
cautious As she came down the stairs he put his finger to his lips in
sign for silence and said This is Miss Butler I believe

Yes replied Aileen with a secret smile Her one desire was to kiss
him Whats the trouble darling she asked softly

Youll have to go back dear Im afraid whispered Cowperwood
Youll have everything in a turmoil if you dont Your mother doesnt
know yet it seems and your father is over at my place now waiting for
you It may be a good deal of help to me if you do Let me tell you
He went off into a complete description of his conversation with Butler
and his own views in the matter Aileens expression changed from time
to time as the various phases of the matter were put before her but
persuaded by the clearness with which he put the matter and by
his assurance that they could continue their relations as before
uninterrupted once this was settled she decided to return In a way
her fathers surrender was a great triumph She made her farewells to
the Calligans saying with a smile that they could not do without her
at home and that she would send for her belongings later and returned
with Cowperwood to his own door There he asked her to wait in the
runabout while he sent her father down

Well said Butler turning on him when he opened the door and not
seeing Aileen

Youll find her outside in my runabout observed Cowperwood You may
use that if you choose I will send my man for it

No thank you well walk said Butler

Cowperwood called his servant to take charge of the vehicle and Butler
stalked solemnly out

He had to admit to himself that the influence of Cowperwood over his
daughter was deadly and probably permanent The best he could do would
be to keep her within the precincts of the home where she might still
possibly be brought to her senses He held a very guarded conversation
with her on his way home for fear that she would take additional
offense Argument was out of the question

Ye might have talked with me once more Aileen he said before ye
left Yer mother would be in a terrible state if she knew ye were gone
She doesnt know yet Yell have to say ye stayed somewhere to dinner

I was at the Calligans replied Aileen Thats easy enough Mama
wont think anything about it

Its a sore heart I have Aileen I hope yell think over your ways and
do better Ill not say anythin more now

Aileen returned to her room decidedly triumphant in her mood for the
moment and things went on apparently in the Butler household as before
But those who imagine that this defeat permanently altered the attitude
of Butler toward Cowperwood are mistaken

In the meanwhile between the day of his temporary release and the
hearing of his appeal which was two months off Cowperwood was going on
doing his best to repair his shattered forces He took up his work
where he left off but the possibility of reorganizing his business
was distinctly modified since his conviction Because of his action in
trying to protect his largest creditors at the time of his failure he
fancied that once he was free again if ever he got free his credit
other things being equal would be good with those who could help
him mostsay Cooke  Co Clark  Co Drexel  Co and the Girard
National Bankproviding his personal reputation had not been too badly
injured by his sentence Fortunately for his own hopefulness of mind
he failed fully to realize what a depressing effect a legal decision of
this character sound or otherwise had on the minds of even his most
enthusiastic supporters

His best friends in the financial world were by now convinced that his
was a sinking ship A student of finance once observed that nothing is
so sensitive as money and the financial mind partakes largely of the
quality of the thing in which it deals There was no use trying to
do much for a man who might be going to prison for a term of years
Something might be done for him possibly in connection with the
governor providing he lost his case before the Supreme Court and was
actually sentenced to prison but that was two months off or more and
they could not tell what the outcome of that would be So Cowperwoods
repeated appeals for assistance extension of credit or the acceptance
of some plan he had for his general rehabilitation were met with the
kindly evasions of those who were doubtful They would think it over
They would see about it Certain things were standing in the way And
so on and so forth through all the endless excuses of those who do
not care to act In these days he went about the money world in his
customary jaunty way greeting all those whom he had known there many
years and pretending when asked to be very hopeful to be doing very
well but they did not believe him and he really did not care whether
they did or not His business was to persuade or overpersuade any one
who could really be of assistance to him and at this task he worked
untiringly ignoring all others

Why hello Frank his friends would call on seeing him How are you
getting on

Fine Fine he would reply cheerfully Never better and he would
explain in a general way how his affairs were being handled He conveyed
much of his own optimism to all those who knew him and were interested
in his welfare but of course there were many who were not

In these days also he and Steger were constantly to be met with in
courts of law for he was constantly being reexamined in some petition
in bankruptcy They were heartbreaking days but he did not flinch He
wanted to stay in Philadelphia and fight the thing to a finishputting
himself where he had been before the fire rehabilitating himself in
the eyes of the public He felt that he could do it too if he were
not actually sent to prison for a long term and even then so naturally
optimistic was his mood when he got out again But in so far as
Philadelphia was concerned distinctly he was dreaming vain dreams

One of the things militating against him was the continued opposition
of Butler and the politicians Somehowno one could have said exactly
whythe general political feeling was that the financier and the former
city treasurer would lose their appeals and eventually be sentenced
together Stener in spite of his original intention to plead guilty and
take his punishment without comment had been persuaded by some of his
political friends that it would be better for his futures sake to plead
not guilty and claim that his offense had been due to custom rather
than to admit his guilt outright and so seem not to have had
any justification whatsoever This he did but he was convicted
nevertheless For the sake of appearances a trumpedup appeal was made
which was now before the State Supreme Court

Then too due to one whisper and another and these originating with
the girl who had written Butler and Cowperwoods wife there was at this
time a growing volume of gossip relating to the alleged relations of
Cowperwood with Butlers daughter Aileen There had been a house in
Tenth Street It had been maintained by Cowperwood for her No wonder
Butler was so vindictive This indeed explained much And even in the
practical financial world criticism was now rather against Cowperwood
than his enemies For was it not a fact that at the inception of his
career he had been befriended by Butler And what a way to reward that
friendship His oldest and firmest admirers wagged their heads For
they sensed clearly that this was another illustration of that innate I
satisfy myself attitude which so regulated Cowperwoods conduct He was
a strong man surelyand a brilliant one Never had Third Street seen a
more pyrotechnic and yet fascinating and financially aggressive and
at the same time conservative person Yet might one not fairly tempt
Nemesis by a too great daring and egotism Like Death it loves a
shining mark He should not perhaps have seduced Butlers daughter
unquestionably he should not have so boldly taken that check especially
after his quarrel and break with Stener He was a little too aggressive
Was it not questionable whetherwith such a recordhe could be
restored to his former place here The bankers and business men who were
closest to him were decidedly dubious

But in so far as Cowperwood and his own attitude toward life was
concerned at this timethe feeling he hadto satisfy myselfwhen
combined with his love of beauty and love and women still made him
ruthless and thoughtless Even now the beauty and delight of a girl
like Aileen Butler were far more important to him than the goodwill of
fifty million people if he could evade the necessity of having their
goodwill Previous to the Chicago fire and the panic his star had been
so rapidly ascending that in the helterskelter of great and favorable
events he had scarcely taken thought of the social significance of the
thing he was doing Youth and the joy of life were in his blood He felt
so young so vigorous so like new grass looks and feels The freshness
of spring evenings was in him and he did not care After the
crash when one might have imagined he would have seen the wisdom of
relinquishing Aileen for the time being anyhow he did not care to She
represented the best of the wonderful days that had gone before She was
a link between him and the past and a stilltobe triumphant future

His worst anxiety was that if he were sent to the penitentiary or
adjudged a bankrupt or both he would probably lose the privilege of
a seat on change and that would close to him the most distinguished
avenue of his prosperity here in Philadelphia for some time if not
forever At present because of his complications his seat had been
attached as an asset and he could not act Edward and Joseph almost
the only employees he could afford were still acting for him in a small
way but the other members on change naturally suspected his brothers
as his agents and any talk that they might raise of going into business
for themselves merely indicated to other brokers and bankers that
Cowperwood was contemplating some concealed move which would not
necessarily be advantageous to his creditors and against the law
anyhow Yet he must remain on change whatever happened potentially if
not actively and so in his quick mental searchings he hit upon the idea
that in order to forfend against the event of his being put into prison
or thrown into bankruptcy or both he ought to form a subsidiary silent
partnership with some man who was or would be well liked on change and
whom he could use as a catspaw and a dummy

Finally he hit upon a man who he thought would do He did not amount to
muchhad a small business but he was honest and he liked Cowperwood
His name was WingateStephen Wingateand he was eking out a not too
robust existence in South Third Street as a broker He was fortyfive
years of age of medium height fairly thickset not at all
unprepossessing and rather intelligent and active but not too forceful
and pushing in spirit He really needed a man like Cowperwood to make
him into something if ever he was to be made He had a seat on change
and was well thought of respected but not so very prosperous In times
past he had asked small favors of Cowperwoodthe use of small loans at
a moderate rate of interest tips and so forth and Cowperwood because
he liked him and felt a little sorry for him had granted them Now
Wingate was slowly drifting down toward a none too successful old age
and was as tractable as such a man would naturally be No one for the
time being would suspect him of being a hireling of Cowperwoods and
the latter could depend on him to execute his orders to the letter He
sent for him and had a long conversation with him He told him just what
the situation was what he thought he could do for him as a partner how
much of his business he would want for himself and so on and found him
agreeable

Ill be glad to do anything you say Mr Cowperwood he assured the
latter I know whatever happens that youll protect me and theres
nobody in the world I would rather work with or have greater respect
for This storm will all blow over and youll be all right We can try
it anyhow If it dont work out you can see what you want to do about
it later

And so this relationship was tentatively entered into and Cowperwood
began to act in a small way through Wingate





Chapter XLVIII


By the time the State Supreme Court came to pass upon Cowperwoods plea
for a reversal of the lower court and the granting of a new trial the
rumor of his connection with Aileen had spread far and wide As has been
seen it had done and was still doing him much damage It confirmed the
impression which the politicians had originally tried to create
that Cowperwood was the true criminal and Stener the victim His
semilegitimate financial subtlety backed indeed by his financial
genius but certainly on this account not worse than that being
practiced in peace and quiet and with much applause in many other
quarterswas now seen to be Machiavellian trickery of the most
dangerous type He had a wife and two children and without knowing what
his real thoughts had been the fruitfully imaginative public jumped
to the conclusion that he had been on the verge of deserting them
divorcing Lillian and marrying Aileen This was criminal enough
in itself from the conservative point of view but when taken in
connection with his financial record his trial conviction and general
bankruptcy situation the public was inclined to believe that he was all
the politicians said he was He ought to be convicted The Supreme
Court ought not to grant his prayer for a new trial It is thus that
our inmost thoughts and intentions burst at times via no known material
agency into public thoughts People know when they cannot
apparently possibly know why they know There is such a thing as
thoughttransference and transcendentalism of ideas

It reached for one thing the ears of the five judges of the State
Supreme Court and of the Governor of the State

During the four weeks Cowperwood had been free on a certificate of
reasonable doubt both Harper Steger and Dennis Shannon appeared before
the judges of the State Supreme Court and argued pro and con as to the
reasonableness of granting a new trial Through his lawyer Cowperwood
made a learned appeal to the Supreme Court judges showing how he
had been unfairly indicted in the first place how there was no real
substantial evidence on which to base a charge of larceny or anything
else It took Steger two hours and ten minutes to make his argument
and DistrictAttorney Shannon longer to make his reply during which the
five judges on the bench men of considerable legal experience but no
great financial understanding listened with rapt attention Three of
them Judges Smithson Rainey and Beckwith men most amenable to the
political feeling of the time and the wishes of the bosses were little
interested in this story of Cowperwoods transaction particularly since
his relations with Butlers daughter and Butlers consequent opposition
to him had come to them They fancied that in a way they were
considering the whole matter fairly and impartially but the manner in
which Cowperwood had treated Butler was never out of their minds Two of
them Judges Marvin and Rafalsky who were men of larger sympathies
and understanding but of no greater political freedom did feel that
Cowperwood had been badly used thus far but they did not see what they
could do about it He had put himself in a most unsatisfactory position
politically and socially They understood and took into consideration
his great financial and social losses which Steger described accurately
and one of them Judge Rafalsky because of a similar event in his own
life in so far as a girl was concerned was inclined to argue strongly
against the conviction of Cowperwood but owing to his political
connections and obligations he realized that it would not be wise
politically to stand out against what was wanted Still when he and
Marvin learned that Judges Smithson Rainey and Beckwith were inclined
to convict Cowperwood without much argument they decided to hand down a
dissenting opinion The point involved was a very knotty one Cowperwood
might carry it to the Supreme Court of the United States on some
fundamental principle of liberty of action Anyhow other judges in
other courts in Pennsylvania and elsewhere would be inclined to examine
the decision in this case it was so important The minority decided
that it would not do them any harm to hand down a dissenting
opinion The politicians would not mind as long as Cowperwood was
convictedwould like it better in fact It looked fairer Besides
Marvin and Rafalsky did not care to be included if they could help
it with Smithson Rainey and Beckwith in a sweeping condemnation of
Cowperwood So all five judges fancied they were considering the
whole matter rather fairly and impartially as men will under such
circumstances Smithson speaking for himself and Judges Rainey and
Beckwith on the eleventh of February 1872 said

The defendant Frank A Cowperwood asks that the finding of the jury
in the lower court the State of Pennsylvania vs Frank A Cowperwood
be reversed and a new trial granted This court cannot see that any
substantial injustice has been done the defendant Here followed
a rather lengthy resume of the history of the case in which it was
pointed out that the custom and precedent of the treasurers office to
say nothing of Cowperwoods easy method of doing business with the city
treasury could have nothing to do with his responsibility for failure
to observe both the spirit and the letter of the law The obtaining of
goods under color of legal process went on Judge Smithson speaking
for the majority may amount to larceny In the present case it was
the province of the jury to ascertain the felonious intent They have
settled that against the defendant as a question of fact and the
court cannot say that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain the
verdict For what purpose did the defendant get the check He was upon
the eve of failure He had already hypothecated for his own debts
the loan of the city placed in his hands for salehe had unlawfully
obtained five hundred thousand dollars in cash as loans and it is
reasonable to suppose that he could obtain nothing more from the city
treasury by any ordinary means Then it is that he goes there and
by means of a falsehood implied if not actual obtains sixty thousand
dollars more The jury has found the intent with which this was done

It was in these words that Cowperwoods appeal for a new trial was
denied by the majority

For himself and Judge Rafalsky Judge Marvin dissenting wrote

It is plain from the evidence in the case that Mr Cowperwood did not
receive the check without authority as agent to do so and it has not
been clearly demonstrated that within his capacity as agent he did not
perform or intend to perform the full measure of the obligation which
the receipt of this check implied It was shown in the trial that as a
matter of policy it was understood that purchases for the sinkingfund
should not be known or understood in the market or by the public in that
light and that Mr Cowperwood as agent was to have an absolutely
free hand in the disposal of his assets and liabilities so long as the
ultimate result was satisfactory There was no particular time when the
loan was to be bought nor was there any particular amount mentioned at
any time to be purchased Unless the defendant intended at the time
he received the check fraudulently to appropriate it he could not be
convicted even on the first count The verdict of the jury does not
establish this fact the evidence does not show conclusively that it
could be established and the same jury upon three other counts found
the defendant guilty without the semblance of shadow of evidence How
can we say that their conclusions upon the first count are unerring when
they so palpably erred on the other counts It is the opinion of the
minority that the verdict of the jury in charging larceny on the first
count is not valid and that that verdict should be set aside and a new
trial granted

Judge Rafalsky a meditative and yet practical man of Jewish extraction
but peculiarly American appearance felt called upon to write a third
opinion which should especially reflect his own cogitation and be
a criticism on the majority as well as a slight variation from and
addition to the points on which he agreed with Judge Marvin It was
a knotty question this of Cowperwoods guilt and aside from the
political necessity of convicting him nowhere was it more clearly shown
than in these varying opinions of the superior court Judge Rafalsky
held for instance that if a crime had been committed at all it was
not that known as larceny and he went on to add

It is impossible from the evidence to come to the conclusion either
that Cowperwood did not intend shortly to deliver the loan or that
Albert Stires the chief clerk or the city treasurer did not intend
to part not only with the possession but also and absolutely with the
property in the check and the money represented by it It was testified
by Mr Stires that Mr Cowperwood said he had bought certificates of
city loan to this amount and it has not been clearly demonstrated that
he had not His nonplacement of the same in the sinkingfund must in
all fairness the letter of the law to the contrary notwithstanding be
looked upon and judged in the light of custom Was it his custom so to
do In my judgment the doctrine now announced by the majority of the
court extends the crime of constructive larceny to such limits that any
business man who engages in extensive and perfectly legitimate stock
transactions may before he knows it by a sudden panic in the market
or a fire as in this instance become a felon When a principle is
asserted which establishes such a precedent and may lead to such
results it is to say the least startling

While he was notably comforted by the dissenting opinions of the judges
in minority and while he had been schooling himself to expect the worst
in this connection and had been arranging his affairs as well as he
could in anticipation of it Cowperwood was still bitterly disappointed
It would be untrue to say that strong and selfreliant as he normally
was he did not suffer He was not without sensibilities of the highest
order only they were governed and controlled in him by that cold iron
thing his reason which never forsook him There was no further appeal
possible save to the United States Supreme Court as Steger pointed out
and there only on the constitutionality of some phase of the decision
and his rights as a citizen of which the Supreme Court of the United
States must take cognizance This was a tedious and expensive thing to
do It was not exactly obvious at the moment on what point he could make
an appeal It would involve a long delayperhaps a year and a half
perhaps longer at the end of which period he might have to serve his
prison term anyhow and pending which he would certainly have to undergo
incarceration for a time

Cowperwood mused speculatively for a few moments after hearing Stegers
presentation of the case Then he said Well it looks as if I have to
go to jail or leave the country and Ive decided on jail I can fight
this out right here in Philadelphia in the long run and win I can get
that decision reversed in the Supreme Court or I can get the Governor
to pardon me after a time I think Im not going to run away and
everybody knows Im not These people who think they have me down
havent got one corner of me whipped Ill get out of this thing after
a while and when I do Ill show some of these petty little politicians
what it means to put up a real fight Theyll never get a damned dollar
out of me nownot a dollar I did intend to pay that five hundred
thousand dollars some time if they had let me go Now they can whistle

He set his teeth and his gray eyes fairly snapped their determination

Well Ive done all I can Frank pleaded Steger sympathetically
Youll do me the justice to say that I put up the best fight I knew
how I may not know howyoull have to answer for thatbut within my
limits Ive done the best I can I can do a few things more to carry
this thing on if you want me to but Im going to leave it to you now
Whatever you say goes

Dont talk nonsense at this stage Harper replied Cowperwood almost
testily I know whether Im satisfied or not and Id soon tell you if
I wasnt I think you might as well go on and see if you can find some
definite grounds for carrying it to the Supreme Court but meanwhile
Ill begin my sentence I suppose Payderson will be naming a day to have
me brought before him now shortly

It depends on how youd like to have it Frank I could get a stay
of sentence for a week maybe or ten days if it will do you any good
Shannon wont make any objection to that Im sure Theres only one
hitch Jaspers will be around here tomorrow looking for you Its his
duty to take you into custody again once hes notified that your appeal
has been denied Hell be wanting to lock you up unless you pay him
but we can fix that If you do want to wait and want any time off
I suppose hell arrange to let you out with a deputy but Im afraid
youll have to stay there nights Theyre pretty strict about that since
that Albertson case of a few years ago

Steger referred to the case of a noted bank cashier who being let out
of the county jail at night in the alleged custody of a deputy was
permitted to escape There had been emphatic and severe condemnation of
the sheriffs office at the time and since then repute or no repute
money or no money convicted criminals were supposed to stay in the
county jail at night at least

Cowperwood meditated this calmly looking out of the lawyers window
into Second Street He did not much fear anything that might happen
to him in Jasperss charge since his first taste of that gentlemans
hospitality although he did object to spending nights in the county
jail when his general term of imprisonment was being reduced no whit
thereby All that he could do now in connection with his affairs unless
he could have months of freedom could be as well adjusted from a prison
cell as from his Third Street officenot quite but nearly so Anyhow
why parley He was facing a prison term and he might as well accept it
without further ado He might take a day or two finally to look after
his affairs but beyond that why bother

When in the ordinary course of events if you did nothing at all
would I come up for sentence

Oh Friday or Monday I fancy replied Steger I dont know what move
Shannon is planning to make in this matter I thought Id walk around
and see him in a little while

I think youd better do that replied Cowperwood Friday or Monday
will suit me either way Im really not particular Better make it
Monday if you can You dont suppose there is any way you can induce
Jaspers to keep his hands off until then He knows Im perfectly
responsible

I dont know Frank Im sure Ill see Ill go around and talk to him
tonight Perhaps a hundred dollars will make him relax the rigor of his
rules that much

Cowperwood smiled grimly

I fancy a hundred dollars would make Jaspers relax a whole lot of
rules he replied and he got up to go

Steger arose also Ill see both these people and then Ill call
around at your house Youll be in will you after dinner

Yes

They slipped on their overcoats and went out into the cold February day
Cowperwood back to his Third Street office Steger to see Shannon and
Jaspers





Chapter XLIX


The business of arranging Cowperwoods sentence for Monday was soon
disposed of through Shannon who had no personal objection to any
reasonable delay

Steger next visited the county jail close on to five oclock when
it was already dark Sheriff Jaspers came lolling out from his private
library where he had been engaged upon the work of cleaning his pipe

How are you Mr Steger he observed smiling blandly How are you
Glad to see you Wont you sit down I suppose youre round here again
on that Cowperwood matter I just received word from the district
attorney that he had lost his case

Thats it Sheriff replied Steger ingratiatingly He asked me
to step around and see what you wanted him to do in the matter Judge
Payderson has just fixed the sentence time for Monday morning at ten
oclock I dont suppose youll be much put out if he doesnt show up
here before Monday at eight oclock will you or Sunday night anyhow
Hes perfectly reliable as you know Steger was sounding Jaspers
out politely trying to make the time of Cowperwoods arrival a trivial
matter in order to avoid paying the hundred dollars if possible But
Jaspers was not to be so easily disposed of His fat face lengthened
considerably How could Steger ask him such a favor and not even suggest
the slightest form of remuneration

Its agin the law Mr Steger as you know he began cautiously
and complainingly Id like to accommodate him everything else being
equal but since that Albertson case three years ago weve had to run
this office much more careful and

Oh I know Sheriff interrupted Steger blandly but this isnt an
ordinary case in any way as you can see for yourself Mr Cowperwood is
a very important man and he has a great many things to attend to Now
if it were only a mere matter of seventyfive or a hundred dollars
to satisfy some court clerk with or to pay a fine it would be easy
enough but He paused and looked wisely away and Mr Jasperss face
began to relax at once The law against which it was ordinarily so hard
to offend was not now so important Steger saw that it was needless to
introduce any additional arguments

Its a very ticklish business this Mr Steger put in the sheriff
yieldingly and yet with a slight whimper in his voice If anything
were to happen it would cost me my place all right I dont like to do
it under any circumstances and I wouldnt only I happen to know both
Mr Cowperwood and Mr Stener and I like em both I don think
they got their rights in this matter either I dont mind making an
exception in this case if Mr Cowperwood dont go about too publicly I
wouldnt want any of the men in the district attorneys office to know
this I dont suppose hell mind if I keep a deputy somewhere near all
the time for looks sake I have to you know really under the law
He wont bother him any Just keep on guard like Jaspers looked at
Mr Steger very flatly and wiselyalmost placatingly under the
circumstancesand Steger nodded

Quite right Sheriff quite right Youre quite right and he drew out
his purse while the sheriff led the way very cautiously back into his
library

Id like to show you the line of lawbooks Im fixing up for myself
in here Mr Steger he observed genially but meanwhile closing his
fingers gently on the small roll of tendollar bills Steger was handing
him We have occasional use for books of that kind here as you see I
thought it a good sort of thing to have them around He waved one arm
comprehensively at the line of State reports revised statutes prison
regulations etc the while he put the money in his pocket and Steger
pretended to look

A good idea I think Sheriff Very good indeed So you think if Mr
Cowperwood gets around here very early Monday morning say eight or
eightthirty that it will be all right

I think so replied the sheriff curiously nervous but agreeable
anxious to please I dont think that anything will come up that will
make me want him earlier If it does Ill let you know and you can
produce him I dont think so though Mr Steger I think everything
will be all right They were once more in the main hall now Glad to
have seen you again Mr Stegervery glad he added Call again some
day

Waving the sheriff a pleasant farewell he hurried on his way to
Cowperwoods house

You would not have thought seeing Cowperwood mount the front steps of
his handsome residence in his neat gray suit and wellcut overcoat on
his return from his office that evening that he was thinking that this
might be his last night here His air and walk indicated no weakening
of spirit He entered the hall where an early lamp was aglow and
encountered Wash Sims an old negro factotum who was just coming up
from the basement carrying a bucket of coal for one of the fireplaces

Mahty cold out dis evenin Mistah Coppahwood said Wash to whom
anything less than sixty degrees was very cold His one regret was that
Philadelphia was not located in North Carolina from whence he came

Tis sharp Wash replied Cowperwood absentmindedly He was thinking
for the moment of the house and how it had looked as he came toward it
west along Girard Avenuewhat the neighbors were thinking of him too
observing him from time to time out of their windows It was clear and
cold The lamps in the receptionhall and sittingroom had been lit for
he had permitted no air of funereal gloom to settle down over this
place since his troubles had begun In the far west of the street a last
tingling gleam of lavender and violet was showing over the cold white
snow of the roadway The house of graygreen stone with its lighted
windows and creamcolored lace curtains had looked especially
attractive He had thought for the moment of the pride he had taken in
putting all this here decorating and ornamenting it and whether ever
he could secure it for himself again Where is your mistress he added
to Wash when he bethought himself

In the sittingroom Mr Coppahwood ah think

Cowperwood ascended the stairs thinking curiously that Wash would soon
be out of a job now unless Mrs Cowperwood out of all the wreck of
other things chose to retain him which was not likely He entered the
sittingroom and there sat his wife by the oblong centertable sewing
a hook and eye on one of Lillian seconds petticoats She looked
up at his step with the peculiarly uncertain smile she used these
daysindication of her pain fear suspicionand inquired Well what
is new with you Frank Her smile was something like a hat or belt or
ornament which one puts on or off at will

Nothing in particular he replied in his offhand way except that I
understand I have lost that appeal of mine Steger is coming here in
a little while to let me know I had a note from him and I fancy its
about that

He did not care to say squarely that he had lost He knew that she was
sufficiently distressed as it was and he did not care to be too abrupt
just now

You dont say replied Lillian with surprise and fright in her voice
and getting up

She had been so used to a world where prisons were scarcely thought of
where things went on smoothly from day to day without any noticeable
intrusion of such distressing things as courts jails and the like
that these last few months had driven her nearly mad Cowperwood had so
definitely insisted on her keeping in the backgroundhe had told her
so very little that she was all at sea anyhow in regard to the whole
procedure Nearly all that she had had in the way of intelligence had
been from his father and mother and Anna and from a close and almost
secret scrutiny of the newspapers

At the time he had gone to the county jail she did not even know
anything about it until his father had come back from the courtroom and
the jail and had broken the news to her It had been a terrific blow to
her Now to have this thing suddenly broken to her in this offhand way
even though she had been expecting and dreading it hourly was too much

She was still a decidedly charminglooking woman as she stood holding
her daughters garment in her hand even if she was forty years old to
Cowperwoods thirtyfive She was robed in one of the creations of their
late prosperity a creamcolored gown of rich silk with dark brown
trimmingsa fetching combination for her Her eyes were a little
hollow and reddish about the rims but otherwise she showed no sign of
her keen mental distress There was considerable evidence of the former
tranquil sweetness that had so fascinated him ten years before

Isnt that terrible she said weakly her hands trembling in a
nervous way Isnt it dreadful Isnt there anything more you can do
truly You wont really have to go to prison will you He objected
to her distress and her nervous fears He preferred a stronger more
selfreliant type of woman but still she was his wife and in his day
he had loved her much

It looks that way Lillian he said with the first note of real
sympathy he had used in a long while for he felt sorry for her now At
the same time he was afraid to go any further along that line for fear
it might give her a false sense as to his present attitude toward her
which was one essentially of indifference But she was not so dull but
what she could see that the consideration in his voice had been brought
about by his defeat which meant hers also She choked a littleand
even so was touched The bare suggestion of sympathy brought back the
old days so definitely gone forever If only they could be brought back

I dont want you to feel distressed about me though he went on
before she could say anything to him Im not through with my fighting
Ill get out of this I have to go to prison it seems in order to get
things straightened out properly What I would like you to do is to keep
up a cheerful appearance in front of the rest of the familyfather and
mother particularly They need to be cheered up He thought once of
taking her hand then decided not She noted mentally his hesitation
the great difference between his attitude now and that of ten or twelve
years before It did not hurt her now as much as she once would have
thought She looked at him scarcely knowing what to say There was
really not so much to say

Will you have to go soon if you do have to go she ventured wearily

I cant tell yet Possibly tonight Possibly Friday Possibly not
until Monday Im waiting to hear from Steger I expect him here any
minute

To prison To prison Her Frank Cowperwood her husbandthe substance
of their home hereand all their soul destruction going to prison And
even now she scarcely grasped why She stood there wondering what she
could do

Is there anything I can get for you she asked starting forward as if
out of a dream Do you want me to do anything Dont you think perhaps
you had better leave Philadelphia Frank You neednt go to prison
unless you want to

She was a little beside herself for the first time in her life shocked
out of a deadly calm

He paused and looked at her for a moment in his direct examining way
his hard commercial business judgment restored on the instant

That would be a confession of guilt Lillian and Im not guilty
he replied almost coldly I havent done anything that warrants my
running away or going to prison either Im merely going there to save
time at present I cant be litigating this thing forever Ill get
outbe pardoned out or sued out in a reasonable length of time Just
now its better to go I think I wouldnt think of running away from
Philadelphia Two of five judges found for me in the decision Thats
pretty fair evidence that the State has no case against me

His wife saw she had made a mistake It clarified her judgment on
the instant I didnt mean in that way Frank she replied
apologetically You know I didnt Of course I know youre not guilty
Why should I think you were of all people

She paused expecting some retort some further argumenta kind word
maybe A trace of the older baffling love but he had quietly turned to
his desk and was thinking of other things

At this point the anomaly of her own state came over her again It was
all so sad and so hopeless And what was she to do in the future And
what was he likely to do She paused half trembling and yet decided
because of her peculiarly nonresisting naturewhy trespass on his time
Why bother No good would really come of it He really did not care for
her any morethat was it Nothing could make him nothing could bring
them together again not even this tragedy He was interested in another
womanAileenand so her foolish thoughts and explanations her fear
sorrow distress were not important to him He could take her agonized
wish for his freedom as a comment on his probable guilt a doubt of
his innocence a criticism of him She turned away for a minute and he
started to leave the room

Ill be back again in a few moments he volunteered Are the children
here

Yes theyre up in the playroom she answered sadly utterly
nonplussed and distraught

Oh Frank she had it on her lips to cry but before she could utter
it he had bustled down the steps and was gone She turned back to the
table her left hand to her mouth her eyes in a queer hazy melancholy
mist Could it be she thought that life could really come to
thisthat love could so utterly so thoroughly die Ten years
beforebut oh why go back to that Obviously it could and thoughts
concerning that would not help now Twice now in her life her affairs
had seemed to go to piecesonce when her first husband had died and
now when her second had failed her had fallen in love with another and
was going to be sent off to prison What was it about her that caused
such things Was there anything wrong with her What was she going to
do Where go She had no idea of course for how long a term of years
he would be sent away It might be one year or it might be five years
as the papers had said Good heavens The children could almost come to
forget him in five years She put her other hand to her mouth also and
then to her forehead where there was a dull ache She tried to think
further than this but somehow just now there was no further thought
Suddenly quite outside of her own volition with no thought that she
was going to do such a thing her bosom began to heave her throat
contracted in four or five short sharp aching spasms her eyes burned
and she shook in a vigorous anguished desperate almost one might have
said dryeyed cry so hot and few were the tears She could not stop
for the moment just stood there and shook and then after a while a
dull ache succeeded and she was quite as she had been before

Why cry she suddenly asked herself fiercelyfor her Why break
down in this stormy useless way Would it help

But in spite of her speculative philosophic observations to herself
she still felt the echo the distant rumble as it were of the storm in
her own soul Why cry Why not cry She might have saidbut wouldnt
and in spite of herself and all her logic she knew that this tempest
which had so recently raged over her was now merely circling around her
souls horizon and would return to break again





Chapter L


The arrival of Steger with the information that no move of any kind
would be made by the sheriff until Monday morning when Cowperwood could
present himself eased matters This gave him time to thinkto adjust
home details at his leisure He broke the news to his father and mother
in a consoling way and talked with his brothers and father about getting
matters immediately adjusted in connection with the smaller houses to
which they were now shortly to be compelled to move There was much
conferring among the different members of this collapsing organization
in regard to the minor details and what with his conferences with
Steger his seeing personally Davison Leigh Avery Stone of Jay Cooke
 Co George Waterman his oldtime employer Henry was dead
exState Treasurer Van Nostrand who had gone out with the last State
administration and others he was very busy Now that he was really
going into prison he wanted his financial friends to get together and
see if they could get him out by appealing to the Governor The division
of opinion among the judges of the State Supreme Court was his excuse
and strong point He wanted Steger to follow this up and he spared no
pains in trying to see all and sundry who might be of use to himEdward
Tighe of Tighe  Co who was still in business in Third Street Newton
Targool Arthur Rivers Joseph Zimmerman the drygoods prince now a
millionaire Judge Kitchen Terrence Relihan the former representative
of the money element at Harrisburg and many others

Cowperwood wanted Relihan to approach the newspapers and see if he could
not readjust their attitude so as to work to get him out and he wanted
Walter Leigh to head the movement of getting up a signed petition which
should contain all the important names of moneyed people and others
asking the Governor to release him Leigh agreed to this heartily as
did Relihan and many others

And afterwards there was really nothing else to do unless it was to
see Aileen once more and this in the midst of his other complications
and obligations seemed all but impossible at timesand yet he did
achieve that tooso eager was he to be soothed and comforted by the
ignorant and yet all embracing volume of her love Her eyes these days
The eager burning quest of him and his happiness that blazed in
them To think that he should be tortured soher Frank Oh she
knewwhatever he said and however bravely and jauntily he talked To
think that her love for him should have been the principal cause of his
being sent to jail as she now believed And the cruelty of her father
And the smallness of his enemiesthat fool Stener for instance whose
pictures she had seen in the papers Actually whenever in the presence
of her Frank she fairly seethed in a chemic agony for himher strong
handsome loverthe strongest bravest wisest kindest handsomest man
in the world Oh didnt she know And Cowperwood looking in her eyes
and realizing this reasonless if so comforting fever for him smiled
and was touched Such love That of a dog for a master that of a mother
for a child And how had he come to evoke it He could not say but it
was beautiful

And so now in these last trying hours he wished to see her muchand
didmeeting her at least four times in the month in which he had been
free between his conviction and the final dismissal of his appeal He
had one last opportunity of seeing herand she himjust before his
entrance into prison this last timeon the Saturday before the Monday
of his sentence He had not come in contact with her since the decision
of the Supreme Court had been rendered but he had had a letter from her
sent to a private mailbox and had made an appointment for Saturday at
a small hotel in Camden which being across the river was safer in
his judgment than anything in Philadelphia He was a little uncertain
as to how she would take the possibility of not seeing him soon again
after Monday and how she would act generally once he was where she
could not confer with him as often as she chose And in consequence he
was anxious to talk to her But on this occasion as he anticipated and
even feared so sorry for her was he she was not less emphatic in her
protestations than she had ever been in fact much more so When she
saw him approaching in the distance she went forward to meet him in
that direct forceful way which only she could attempt with him a sort
of mannish impetuosity which he both enjoyed and admired and slipping
her arms around his neck said Honey you neednt tell me I saw it
in the papers the other morning Dont you mind honey I love you
Ill wait for you Ill be with you yet if it takes a dozen years of
waiting It doesnt make any difference to me if it takes a hundred
only Im so sorry for you sweetheart Ill be with you every day
through this darling loving you with all my might

She caressed him while he looked at her in that quiet way which
betokened at once his selfpoise and yet his interest and satisfaction
in her He couldnt help loving Aileen he thought who could She was
so passionate vibrant desireful He couldnt help admiring her
tremendously now more than ever because literally in spite of all his
intellectual strength he really could not rule her She went at him
even when he stood off in a calm critical way as if he were
her special property her toy She would talk to him always and
particularly when she was excited as if he were just a baby her pet
and sometimes he felt as though she would really overcome him mentally
make him subservient to her she was so individual so sure of her
importance as a woman

Now on this occasion she went babbling on as if he were brokenhearted
in need of her greatest care and tenderness although he really wasnt
at all and for the moment she actually made him feel as though he was

It isnt as bad as that Aileen he ventured to say eventually and
with a softness and tenderness almost unusual for him even where she
was concerned but she went on forcefully paying no heed to him

Oh yes it is too honey I know Oh my poor Frank But Ill see
you I know how to manage whatever happens How often do they let
visitors come out to see the prisoners there

Only once in three months pet so they say but I think we can fix
that after I get there only do you think you had better try to come
right away Aileen You know what the feeling now is Hadnt you better
wait a while Arent you in danger of stirring up your father He might
cause a lot of trouble out there if he were so minded

Only once in three months she exclaimed with rising emphasis as
he began this explanation Oh Frank no Surely not Once in three
months Oh I cant stand that I wont Ill go and see the warden
myself Hell let me see you Im sure he will if I talk to him

She fairly gasped in her excitement not willing to pause in her tirade
but Cowperwood interposed with her Youre not thinking what youre
saying Aileen Youre not thinking Remember your father Remember your
family Your father may know the warden out there You dont want it to
get all over town that youre running out there to see me do you Your
father might cause you trouble Besides you dont know the small party
politicians as I do They gossip like a lot of old women Youll have to
be very careful what you do and how you do it I dont want to lose you
I want to see you But youll have to mind what youre doing Dont try
to see me at once I want you to but I want to find out how the land
lies and I want you to find out too You wont lose me Ill be there
well enough

He paused as he thought of the long tier of iron cells which must be
there one of which would be hisfor how longand of Aileen seeing
him through the door of it or in it At the same time he was thinking
in spite of all his other calculations how charming she was looking
today How young she kept and how forceful While he was nearing his
full maturity she was a comparatively young girl and as beautiful as
ever She was wearing a blackandwhitestriped silk in the curious
bustle style of the times and a set of sealskin furs including a
little sealskin cap set jauntily on top her redgold hair

I know I know replied Aileen firmly But think of three months
Honey I cant I wont Its nonsense Three months I know that
my father wouldnt have to wait any three months if he wanted to see
anybody out there nor anybody else that he wanted to ask favors for
And I wont either Ill find some way

Cowperwood had to smile You could not defeat Aileen so easily

But youre not your father honey and you dont want him to know

I know I dont but they dont need to know who I am I can go heavily
veiled I dont think that the warden knows my father He may Anyhow
he doesnt know me and he wouldnt tell on me if he did if I talked to
him

Her confidence in her charms her personality her earthly privileges
was quite anarchistic Cowperwood shook his head

Honey youre about the best and the worst there is when it comes to a
woman he observed affectionately pulling her head down to kiss
her but youll have to listen to me just the same I have a lawyer
Stegeryou know him Hes going to take up this matter with the warden
out thereis doing it today He may be able to fix things and he may
not Ill know tomorrow or Sunday and Ill write you But dont go and
do anything rash until you hear Im sure I can cut that visiting limit
in half and perhaps down to once a month or once in two weeks even
They only allow me to write one letter in three monthsAileen exploded
againand Im sure I can have that made differentsome but dont
write me until you hear or at least dont sign any name or put any
address in They open all mail and read it If you see me or write me
youll have to be cautious and youre not the most cautious person in
the world Now be good will you

They talked much moreof his family his court appearance Monday
whether he would get out soon to attend any of the suits still pending
or be pardoned Aileen still believed in his future She had read the
opinions of the dissenting judges in his favor and that of the
three agreed judges against him She was sure his day was not over in
Philadelphia and that he would some time reestablish himself and then
take her with him somewhere else She was sorry for Mrs Cowperwood but
she was convinced that she was not suited to himthat Frank needed some
one more like herself some one with youth and beauty and forceher no
less She clung to him now in ecstatic embraces until it was time to go
So far as a plan of procedure could have been adjusted in a situation so
incapable of accurate adjustment it had been done She was desperately
downcast at the last moment as was he over their parting but she
pulled herself together with her usual force and faced the dark future
with a steady eye





Chapter LI


Monday came and with it his final departure All that could be done had
been done Cowperwood said his farewells to his mother and father
his brothers and sister He had a rather distant but sensible and
matteroffact talk with his wife He made no special point of saying
goodby to his son or his daughter when he came in on Thursday Friday
Saturday and Sunday evenings after he had learned that he was to
depart Monday it was with the thought of talking to them a little in
an especially affectionate way He realized that his general moral or
unmoral attitude was perhaps working them a temporary injustice Still
he was not sure Most people did fairly well with their lives whether
coddled or deprived of opportunity These children would probably do as
well as most children whatever happenedand then anyhow he had no
intention of forsaking them financially if he could help it He did
not want to separate his wife from her children nor them from her She
should keep them He wanted them to be comfortable with her He would
like to see them wherever they were with her occasionally Only
he wanted his own personal freedom in so far as she and they were
concerned to go off and set up a new world and a new home with Aileen
So now on these last days and particularly this last Sunday night he
was rather noticeably considerate of his boy and girl without being too
openly indicative of his approaching separation from them

Frank he said to his notably lackadaisical son on this occasion
arent you going to straighten up and be a big strong healthy fellow
You dont play enough You ought to get in with a gang of boys and be a
leader Why dont you fit yourself up a gymnasium somewhere and see how
strong you can get

They were in the senior Cowperwoods sittingroom where they had all
rather consciously gathered on this occasion

Lillian second who was on the other side of the big library table from
her father paused to survey him and her brother with interest Both
had been carefully guarded against any real knowledge of their fathers
affairs or his present predicament He was going away on a journey for
about a month or so they understood Lillian was reading in a Chatterbox
book which had been given her the previous Christmas

He wont do anything she volunteered looking up from her reading in
a peculiarly critical way for her Why he wont ever run races with me
when I want him to

Aw who wants to run races with you anyhow returned Frank junior
sourly You couldnt run if I did want to run with you

Couldnt I she replied I could beat you all right

Lillian pleaded her mother with a warning sound in her voice

Cowperwood smiled and laid his hand affectionately on his sons head
Youll be all right Frank he volunteered pinching his ear lightly
Dont worryjust make an effort

The boy did not respond as warmly as he hoped Later in the evening Mrs
Cowperwood noticed that her husband squeezed his daughters slim little
waist and pulled her curly hair gently For the moment she was jealous
of her daughter

Going to be the best kind of a girl while Im away he said to her
privately

Yes papa she replied brightly

Thats right he returned and leaned over and kissed her mouth
tenderly Button Eyes he said

Mrs Cowperwood sighed after he had gone Everything for the children
nothing for me she thought though the children had not got so vastly
much either in the past

Cowperwoods attitude toward his mother in this final hour was about
as tender and sympathetic as any he could maintain in this world He
understood quite clearly the ramifications of her interests and how she
was suffering for him and all the others concerned He had not forgotten
her sympathetic care of him in his youth and if he could have done
anything to have spared her this unhappy breakdown of her fortunes in
her old age he would have done so There was no use crying over spilled
milk It was impossible at times for him not to feel intensely in
moments of success or failure but the proper thing to do was to bear
up not to show it to talk little and go your way with an air not so
much of resignation as of selfsufficiency to whatever was awaiting
you That was his attitude on this morning and that was what he
expected from those around himalmost compelled in fact by his own
attitude

Well mother he said genially at the last momenthe would not let
her nor his wife nor his sister come to court maintaining that it would
make not the least difference to him and would only harrow their own
feelings uselesslyIm going now Dont worry Keep up your spirits

He slipped his arm around his mothers waist and she gave him a long
unrestrained despairing embrace and kiss

Go on Frank she said choking when she let him go God bless you
Ill pray for you He paid no further attention to her He didnt dare

Goodby Lillian he said to his wife pleasantly kindly Ill be
back in a few days I think Ill be coming out to attend some of these
court proceedings

To his sister he said Goodby Anna Dont let the others get too
downhearted

Ill see you three afterward he said to his father and brothers and
so dressed in the very best fashion of the time he hurried down into
the receptionhall where Steger was waiting and was off His family
hearing the door close on him suffered a poignant sense of desolation
They stood there for a moment his mother crying his father looking
as though he had lost his last friend but making a great effort to seem
selfcontained and equal to his troubles Anna telling Lillian not to
mind and the latter staring dumbly into the future not knowing what
to think Surely a brilliant sun had set on their local scene and in a
very pathetic way





Chapter LII


When Cowperwood reached the jail Jaspers was there glad to see him but
principally relieved to feel that nothing had happened to mar his
own reputation as a sheriff Because of the urgency of court matters
generally it was decided to depart for the courtroom at nine oclock
Eddie Zanders was once more delegated to see that Cowperwood was brought
safely before Judge Payderson and afterward taken to the penitentiary
All of the papers in the case were put in his care to be delivered to
the warden

I suppose you know confided Sheriff Jaspers to Steger that Stener
is here He aint got no money now but I gave him a private room just
the same I didnt want to put a man like him in no cell Sheriff
Jaspers sympathized with Stener

Thats right Im glad to hear that replied Steger smiling to
himself

I didnt suppose from what Ive heard that Mr Cowperwood would want to
meet Stener here so Ive kept em apart George just left a minute ago
with another deputy

Thats good Thats the way it ought to be replied Steger He was
glad for Cowperwoods sake that the sheriff had so much tact Evidently
George and the sheriff were getting along in a very friendly way for
all the formers bitter troubles and lack of means

The Cowperwood party walked the distance not being great and as they
did so they talked of rather simple things to avoid the more serious

Things arent going to be so bad Edward said to his father Steger
says the Governor is sure to pardon Stener in a year or less and if he
does hes bound to let Frank out too

Cowperwood the elder had heard this over and over but he was never
tired of hearing it It was like some simple croon with which babies are
hushed to sleep The snow on the ground which was enduring remarkably
well for this time of year the fineness of the day which had started
out to be clear and bright the hope that the courtroom might not be
full all held the attention of the father and his two sons Cowperwood
senior even commented on some sparrows fighting over a piece of
bread marveling how well they did in winter solely to ease his
mind Cowperwood walking on ahead with Steger and Zanders talked of
approaching court proceedings in connection with his business and what
ought to be done

When they reached the court the same little pen in which Cowperwood had
awaited the verdict of his jury several months before was waiting to
receive him

Cowperwood senior and his other sons sought places in the courtroom
proper Eddie Zanders remained with his charge Stener and a deputy by
the name of Wilkerson were in the room but he and Cowperwood pretended
now not to see each other Frank had no objection to talking to his
former associate but he could see that Stener was diffident and
ashamed So he let the situation pass without look or word of any kind
After some threequarters of an hour of dreary waiting the door leading
into the courtroom proper opened and a bailiff stepped in

All prisoners up for sentence he called

There were six all told including Cowperwood and Stener Two of them
were confederate housebreakers who had been caught redhanded at their
midnight task

Another prisoner was no more and no less than a plain horsethief a
young man of twentysix who had been convicted by a jury of stealing
a grocers horse and selling it The last man was a negro a tall
shambling illiterate nebulousminded black who had walked off with
an apparently discarded section of lead pipe which he had found in a
lumberyard His idea was to sell or trade it for a drink He really
did not belong in this court at all but having been caught by an
undersized American watchman charged with the care of the property and
having at first refused to plead guilty not quite understanding what
was to be done with him he had been perforce bound over to this court
for trial Afterward he had changed his mind and admitted his guilt so
he now had to come before Judge Payderson for sentence or dismissal
The lower court before which he had originally been brought had lost
jurisdiction by binding him over to to higher court for trial
Eddie Zanders in his selfappointed position as guide and mentor to
Cowperwood had confided nearly all of this data to him as he stood
waiting

The courtroom was crowded It was very humiliating to Cowperwood to have
to file in this way along the side aisle with these others followed by
Stener well dressed but sickly looking and disconsolate

The negro Charles Ackerman was the first on the list

How is it this man comes before me asked Payderson peevishly when
he noted the value of the property Ackerman was supposed to have stolen

Your honor the assistant district attorney explained promptly
this man was before a lower court and refused because he was drunk
or something to plead guilty The lower court because the complainant
would not forego the charge was compelled to bind him over to this
court for trial Since then he has changed his mind and has admitted
his guilt to the district attorney He would not be brought before you
except we have no alternative He has to be brought here now in order to
clear the calendar

Judge Payderson stared quizzically at the negro who obviously not very
much disturbed by this examination was leaning comfortably on the gate
or bar before which the average criminal stood erect and terrified
He had been before policecourt magistrates before on one charge and
anotherdrunkenness disorderly conduct and the likebut his whole
attitude was one of shambling lackadaisical amusing innocence

Well Ackerman inquired his honor severely did you or did you not
steal this piece of lead pipe as charged herefour dollars and eighty
cents worth

Yassah I did he began I tell you how it was jedge I was acomin
along past dat lumberyard one Saturday afternoon and I hadnt been
wuckin an I saw dat piece o pipe thoo de fence lyin inside and I
jes reached thoo with a piece o boad I found dey and pulled it over
to me an tuck it An aftahwahd dis Mistah Watchman manhe waved his
hand oratorically toward the witnesschair where in case the judge
might wish to ask him some questions the complainant had taken his
standcome around tuh where I live an accused me of done takin it

But you did take it didnt you

Yassah I done tuck it

What did you do with it

I traded it foh twentyfive cents

You mean you sold it corrected his honor

Yassah I done sold it

Well dont you know its wrong to do anything like that Didnt you
know when you reached through that fence and pulled that pipe over to
you that you were stealing Didnt you

Yassah I knowed it was wrong replied Ackerman sheepishly I didn
think twuz stealin like zackly but I done knowed it was wrong I done
knowed I oughtn take it I guess

Of course you did Of course you did Thats just it You knew you were
stealing and still you took it Has the man to whom this negro sold
the lead pipe been apprehended yet the judge inquired sharply of the
district attorney He should be for hes more guilty than this negro
a receiver of stolen goods

Yes sir replied the assistant His case is before Judge Yawger

Quite right It should be replied Payderson severely This matter
of receiving stolen property is one of the worst offenses in my
judgment

He then turned his attention to Ackerman again Now look here
Ackerman he exclaimed irritated at having to bother with such a
pretty case I want to say something to you and I want you to pay
strict attention to me Straighten up there Dont lean on that gate
You are in the presence of the law now Ackerman had sprawled himself
comfortably down on his elbows as he would have if he had been leaning
over a backfence gate talking to some one but he immediately drew
himself straight still grinning foolishly and apologetically when he
heard this You are not so dull but that you can understand what I am
going to say to you The offense you have committedstealing a piece
of lead pipeis a crime Do you hear me A criminal offenseone that I
could punish you very severely for I could send you to the penitentiary
for one year if I chosethe law says I mayone year at hard labor for
stealing a piece of lead pipe Now if you have any sense you will pay
strict attention to what I am going to tell you I am not going to send
you to the penitentiary right now Im going to wait a little while I
am going to sentence you to one year in the penitentiaryone year
Do you understand Ackerman blanched a little and licked his lips
nervously And then I am going to suspend that sentencehold it over
your head so that if you are ever caught taking anything else you will
be punished for this offense and the next one also at one and the same
time Do you understand that Do you know what I mean Tell me Do you

Yessah I does sir replied the negro Youse gwine to let me go
nowthas it

The audience grinned and his honor made a wry face to prevent his own
grim grin

Im going to let you go only so long as you dont steal anything else
he thundered The moment you steal anything else back you come to this
court and then you go to the penitentiary for a year and whatever
more time you deserve Do you understand that Now I want you to
walk straight out of this court and behave yourself Dont ever steal
anything Get something to do Dont steal do you hear Dont touch
anything that doesnt belong to you Dont come back here If you do
Ill send you to the penitentiary sure

Yassah No sah I wont replied Ackerman nervously I wont take
nothin more that dont belong tuh me

He shuffled away after a moment urged along by the guiding hand of a
bailiff and was put safely outside the court amid a mixture of smiles
and laughter over his simplicity and Paydersons undue severity of
manner But the next case was called and soon engrossed the interest of
the audience

It was that of the two housebreakers whom Cowperwood had been and was
still studying with much curiosity In all his life before he had never
witnessed a sentencing scene of any kind He had never been in police
or criminal courts of any kindrarely in any of the civil ones He
was glad to see the negro go and gave Payderson credit for having some
sense and sympathymore than he had expected

He wondered now whether by any chance Aileen was here He had objected
to her coming but she might have done so She was as a matter of fact
in the extreme rear pocketed in a crowd near the door heavily veiled
but present She had not been able to resist the desire to know quickly
and surely her beloveds fateto be near him in his hour of real
suffering as she thought She was greatly angered at seeing him brought
in with a line of ordinary criminals and made to wait in this to her
shameful public manner but she could not help admiring all the more the
dignity and superiority of his presence even here He was not even pale
as she saw just the same firm calm soul she had always known him to
be If he could only see her now if he would only look so she could
lift her veil and smile He didnt though he wouldnt He didnt want
to see her here But she would tell him all about it when she saw him
again just the same

The two burglars were quickly disposed of by the judge with a sentence
of one year each and they were led away uncertain and apparently not
knowing what to think of their crime or their future

When it came to Cowperwoods turn to be called his honor himself
stiffened and straightened up for this was a different type of man and
could not be handled in the usual manner He knew exactly what he
was going to say When one of Mollenhauers agents a close friend of
Butlers had suggested that five years for both Cowperwood and Stener
would be about right he knew exactly what to do Frank Algernon
Cowperwood called the clerk

Cowperwood stepped briskly forward sorry for himself ashamed of his
position in a way but showing it neither in look nor manner Payderson
eyed him as he had the others

Name asked the bailiff for the benefit of the court stenographer

Frank Algernon Cowperwood

Residence

1937 Girard Avenue

Occupation

Banker and broker

Steger stood close beside him very dignified very forceful ready to
make a final statement for the benefit of the court and the public when
the time should come Aileen from her position in the crowd near the
door was for the first time in her life biting her fingers nervously
and there were great beads of perspiration on her brow Cowperwoods
father was tense with excitement and his two brothers looked quickly
away doing their best to hide their fear and sorrow

Ever convicted before

Never replied Steger for Cowperwood quietly

Frank Algernon Cowperwood called the clerk in his nasal singsong
way coming forward have you anything to say why judgment should not
now be pronounced upon you If so speak

Cowperwood started to say no but Steger put up his hand

If the court pleases my client Mr Cowperwood the prisoner at the
bar is neither guilty in his own estimation nor in that of twofifths
of the Pennsylvania State Supreme Courtthe court of last resort in
this State he exclaimed loudly and clearly so that all might hear

One of the interested listeners and spectators at this point was Edward
Malia Butler who had just stepped in from another courtroom where he
had been talking to a judge An obsequious court attendant had warned
him that Cowperwood was about to be sentenced He had really come here
this morning in order not to miss this sentence but he cloaked his
motive under the guise of another errand He did not know that Aileen
was there nor did he see her

As he himself testified at the time of his trial went on Steger and
as the evidence clearly showed he was never more than an agent for the
gentleman whose offense was subsequently adjudicated by this court
and as an agent he still maintains and twofifths of the State Supreme
Court agree with him that he was strictly within his rights and
privileges in not having deposited the sixty thousand dollars worth of
city loan certificates at the time and in the manner which the people
acting through the district attorney complained that he should have My
client is a man of rare financial ability By the various letters which
have been submitted to your honor in his behalf you will see that he
commands the respect and the sympathy of a large majority of the
most forceful and eminent men in his particular world He is a man of
distinguished social standing and of notable achievements Only the
most unheralded and the unkindest thrust of fortune has brought him
here before you todaya fire and its consequent panic which involved a
financial property of the most thorough and stable character In spite
of the verdict of the jury and the decision of threefifths of the State
Supreme Court I maintain that my client is not an embezzler that he
has not committed larceny that he should never have been convicted
and that he should not now be punished for something of which he is not
guilty

I trust that your honor will not misunderstand me or my motives when I
point out in this situation that what I have said is true I do not wish
to cast any reflection on the integrity of the court nor of any court
nor of any of the processes of law But I do condemn and deplore the
untoward chain of events which has built up a seeming situation
not easily understood by the lay mind and which has brought my
distinguished client within the purview of the law I think it is but
fair that this should be finally and publicly stated here and now I
ask that your honor be lenient and that if you cannot conscientiously
dismiss this charge you will at least see that the facts as I have
indicated them are given due weight in the measure of the punishment
inflicted

Steger stepped back and Judge Payderson nodded as much as to say he had
heard all the distinguished lawyer had to say and would give it such
consideration as it deservedno more Then he turned to Cowperwood
and summoning all his judicial dignity to his aid he began

Frank Algernon Cowperwood you have been convicted by a jury of your
own selection of the offense of larceny The motion for a new trial
made in your behalf by your learned counsel has been carefully
considered and overruled the majority of the court being entirely
satisfied with the propriety of the conviction both upon the law and
the evidence Your offense was one of more than usual gravity the more
so that the large amount of money which you obtained belonged to the
city And it was aggravated by the fact that you had in addition thereto
unlawfully used and converted to your own use several hundred thousand
dollars of the loan and money of the city For such an offense
the maximum punishment affixed by the law is singularly merciful
Nevertheless the facts in connection with your hitherto distinguished
position the circumstances under which your failure was brought about
and the appeals of your numerous friends and financial associates will
be given due consideration by this court It is not unmindful of any
important fact in your career Payderson paused as if in doubt
though he knew very well how he was about to proceed He knew what his
superiors expected of him

If your case points no other moral he went on after a moment toying
with the briefs it will at least teach the lesson much needed at the
present time that the treasury of the city is not to be invaded
and plundered with impunity under the thin disguise of a business
transaction and that there is still a power in the law to vindicate
itself and to protect the public

The sentence of the court he added solemnly the while Cowperwood
gazed unmoved is therefore that you pay a fine of five thousand
dollars to the commonwealth for the use of the county that you pay the
costs of prosecution and that you undergo imprisonment in the
State Penitentiary for the Eastern District by separate or solitary
confinement at labor for a period of four years and three months and
that you stand committed until this sentence is complied with

Cowperwoods father on hearing this bowed his head to hide his tears
Aileen bit her lower lip and clenched her hands to keep down her rage
and disappointment and tears Four years and three months That would
make a terrible gap in his life and hers Still she could wait It was
better than eight or ten years as she had feared it might be Perhaps
now once this was really over and he was in prison the Governor would
pardon him

The judge now moved to pick up the papers in connection with Steners
case satisfied that he had given the financiers no chance to say he had
not given due heed to their plea in Cowperwoods behalf and yet certain
that the politicians would be pleased that he had so nearly given
Cowperwood the maximum while appearing to have heeded the pleas for
mercy Cowperwood saw through the trick at once but it did not disturb
him It struck him as rather weak and contemptible A bailiff came
forward and started to hurry him away

Allow the prisoner to remain for a moment called the judge

The name of George W Stener had been called by the clerk and
Cowperwood did not quite understand why he was being detained but he
soon learned It was that he might hear the opinion of the court in
connection with his copartner in crime The latters record was taken
Roger OMara the Irish political lawyer who had been his counsel all
through his troubles stood near him but had nothing to say beyond
asking the judge to consider Steners previously honorable career

George W Stener said his honor while the audience including
Cowperwood listened attentively The motion for a new trial as well as
an arrest of judgment in your case having been overruled it remains
for the court to impose such sentence as the nature of your offense
requires I do not desire to add to the pain of your position by any
extended remarks of my own but I cannot let the occasion pass without
expressing my emphatic condemnation of your offense The misapplication
of public money has become the great crime of the age If not promptly
and firmly checked it will ultimately destroy our institutions When
a republic becomes honeycombed with corruption its vitality is gone It
must crumble upon the first pressure

In my opinion the public is much to blame for your offense and others
of a similar character Heretofore official fraud has been regarded
with too much indifference What we need is a higher and purer political
moralitya state of public opinion which would make the improper use of
public money a thing to be execrated It was the lack of this which made
your offense possible Beyond that I see nothing of extenuation in your
case Judge Payderson paused for emphasis He was coming to his finest
flight and he wanted it to sink in

The people had confided to you the care of their money he went on
solemnly It was a high a sacred trust You should have guarded the
door of the treasury even as the cherubim protected the Garden of Eden
and should have turned the flaming sword of impeccable honesty
against every one who approached it improperly Your position as the
representative of a great community warranted that

In view of all the facts in your case the court can do no less than
impose a major penalty The seventyfourth section of the Criminal
Procedure Act provides that no convict shall be sentenced by the court
of this commonwealth to either of the penitentiaries thereof for
any term which shall expire between the fifteenth of November and the
fifteenth day of February of any year and this provision requires me to
abate three months from the maximum of time which I would affix in your
casenamely five years The sentence of the court is therefore that
you pay a fine of five thousand dollars to the commonwealth for the use
of the countyPayderson knew well enough that Stener could never pay
that sumand that you undergo imprisonment in the State Penitentiary
for the Eastern District by separate and solitary confinement at
labor for the period of four years and nine months and that you stand
committed until this sentence is complied with He laid down the briefs
and rubbed his chin reflectively while both Cowperwood and Stener were
hurried out Butler was the first to leave after the sentencequite
satisfied Seeing that all was over so far as she was concerned Aileen
stole quickly out and after her in a few moments Cowperwoods father
and brothers They were to await him outside and go with him to the
penitentiary The remaining members of the family were at home eagerly
awaiting intelligence of the mornings work and Joseph Cowperwood was
at once despatched to tell them

The day had now become cloudy lowery and it looked as if there might
be snow Eddie Zanders who had been given all the papers in the case
announced that there was no need to return to the county jail In
consequence the five of themZanders Steger Cowperwood his father
and Edwardgot into a streetcar which ran to within a few blocks of
the prison Within half an hour they were at the gates of the Eastern
Penitentiary





Chapter LIII


The Eastern District Penitentiary of Pennsylvania standing at Fairmount
Avenue and Twentyfirst Street in Philadelphia where Cowperwood was
now to serve his sentence of four years and three months was a large
graystone structure solemn and momentous in its mien not at all
unlike the palace of Sforzas at Milan although not so distinguished
It stretched its gray length for several blocks along four different
streets and looked as lonely and forbidding as a prison should The
wall which inclosed its great area extending over ten acres and gave it
so much of its solemn dignity was thirtyfive feet high and some seven
feet thick The prison proper which was not visible from the outside
consisted of seven arms or corridors ranged octopuslike around a
central room or court and occupying in their sprawling length about
twothirds of the yard inclosed within the walls so that there was but
little space for the charm of lawn or sward The corridors fortytwo
feet wide from outer wall to outer wall were one hundred and eighty
feet in length and in four instances two stories high and extended
in their long reach in every direction There were no windows in the
corridors only narrow slits of skylights three and onehalf feet long
by perhaps eight inches wide let in the roof and the groundfloor
cells were accompanied in some instances by a small yard ten by
sixteenthe same size as the cells properwhich was surrounded by a
high brick wall in every instance The cells and floors and roofs were
made of stone and the corridors which were only ten feet wide between
the cells and in the case of the singlestory portion only fifteen
feet high were paved with stone If you stood in the central room or
rotunda and looked down the long stretches which departed from you
in every direction you had a sense of narrowness and confinement
not compatible with their length The iron doors with their outer
accompaniment of solid wooden ones the latter used at times to shut the
prisoner from all sight and sound were grim and unpleasing to behold
The halls were light enough being whitewashed frequently and set with
the narrow skylights which were closed with frosted glass in winter
but they were as are all such matteroffact arrangements for
incarceration barewearisome to look upon Life enough there was in
all conscience seeing that there were four hundred prisoners here at
that time and that nearly every cell was occupied but it was a life of
which no one individual was essentially aware as a spectacle He was of
it but he was not Some of the prisoners after long service were used
as trusties or runners as they were locally called but not many
There was a bakery a machineshop a carpentershop a storeroom
a flourmill and a series of gardens or truck patches but the
manipulation of these did not require the services of a large number

The prison proper dated from 1822 and it had grown wing by wing until
its present considerable size had been reached Its population consisted
of individuals of all degrees of intelligence and crime from murderers
to minor practitioners of larceny It had what was known as the
Pennsylvania System of regulation for its inmates which was nothing
more nor less than solitary confinement for all concerneda life of
absolute silence and separate labor in separate cells

Barring his comparatively recent experience in the county jail which
after all was far from typical Cowperwood had never been in a prison in
his life Once when a boy in one of his perambulations through several
of the surrounding towns he had passed a village lockup as the
town prisons were then calleda small square gray building with long
ironbarred windows and he had seen at one of these rather depressing
apertures on the second floor a none too prepossessing drunkard or town
neerdowell who looked down on him with bleary eyes unkempt hair and
a sodden waxy pallid face and calledfor it was summer and the jail
window was open

Hey sonny get me a plug of tobacco will you

Cowperwood who had looked up shocked and disturbed by the mans
disheveled appearance had called back quite without stopping to think

Naw I cant

Look out you dont get locked up yourself sometime you little runt
the man had replied savagely only half recovered from his debauch of
the day before

He had not thought of this particular scene in years but now suddenly
it came back to him Here he was on his way to be locked up in this
dull somber prison and it was snowing and he was being cut out of
human affairs as much as it was possible for him to be cut out

No friends were permitted to accompany him beyond the outer gatenot
even Steger for the time being though he might visit him later in
the day This was an inviolable rule Zanders being known to the
gatekeeper and bearing his commitment paper was admitted at once The
others turned solemnly away They bade a gloomy if affectionate farewell
to Cowperwood who on his part attempted to give it all an air of
inconsequenceas in part and even here it had for him

Well goodby for the present he said shaking hands Ill be all
right and Ill get out soon Wait and see Tell Lillian not to worry

He stepped inside and the gate clanked solemnly behind him Zanders led
the way through a dark somber hall wide and highceiled to a farther
gate where a second gateman trifling with a large key unlocked a
barred door at his bidding Once inside the prison yard Zanders turned
to the left into a small office presenting his prisoner before a small
chesthigh desk where stood a prison officer in uniform of blue
The latter the receiving overseer of the prisona thin practical
executivelooking person with narrow gray eyes and light hair took the
paper which the sheriffs deputy handed him and read it This was his
authority for receiving Cowperwood In his turn he handed Zanders a
slip showing that he had so received the prisoner and then Zanders
left receiving gratefully the tip which Cowperwood pressed in his hand

Well goodby Mr Cowperwood he said with a peculiar twist of his
detectivelike head Im sorry I hope you wont find it so bad here

He wanted to impress the receiving overseer with his familiarity with
this distinguished prisoner and Cowperwood true to his policy of
makebelieve shook hands with him cordially

Im much obliged to you for your courtesy Mr Zanders he said then
turned to his new master with the air of a man who is determined to make
a good impression He was now in the hands of petty officials he knew
who could modify or increase his comfort at will He wanted to impress
this man with his utter willingness to comply and obeyhis sense of
respect for his authoritywithout in any way demeaning himself He
was depressed but efficient even here in the clutch of that eventual
machine of the law the State penitentiary which he had been struggling
so hard to evade

The receiving overseer Roger Kendall though thin and clerical was
a rather capable man as prison officials goshrewd not particularly
well educated not overintelligent naturally not overindustrious
but sufficiently energetic to hold his position He knew something about
convictsconsiderablefor he had been dealing with them for nearly
twentysix years His attitude toward them was cold cynical critical

He did not permit any of them to come into personal contact with
him but he saw to it that underlings in his presence carried out the
requirements of the law

When Cowperwood entered dressed in his very good clothinga dark
grayblue twill suit of pure wool a light wellmade gray overcoat a
black derby hat of the latest shape his shoes new and of good leather
his tie of the best silk heavy and conservatively colored his hair and
mustache showing the attention of an intelligent barber and his hands
well manicuredthe receiving overseer saw at once that he was in the
presence of some one of superior intelligence and force such a man as
the fortune of his trade rarely brought into his net

Cowperwood stood in the middle of the room without apparently looking at
any one or anything though he saw all Convict number 3633 Kendall
called to a clerk handing him at the same time a yellow slip of paper
on which was written Cowperwoods full name and his record number
counting from the beginning of the penitentiary itself

The underling a convict took it and entered it in a book reserving
the slip at the same time for the penitentiary runner or trusty who
would eventually take Cowperwood to the manners gallery

You will have to take off your clothes and take a bath said Kendall
to Cowperwood eyeing him curiously I dont suppose you need one but
its the rule

Thank you replied Cowperwood pleased that his personality was
counting for something even here Whatever the rules are I want to
obey

When he started to take off his coat however Kendall put up his hand
delayingly and tapped a bell There now issued from an adjoining room
an assistant a prison servitor a weirdlooking specimen of the genus
trusty He was a small dark lopsided individual one leg being
slightly shorter and therefore one shoulder lower than the other He
was hollowchested squinteyed and rather shambling but spry enough
withal He was dressed in a thin poorly made baggy suit of striped
jeans the prison stripes of the place showing a soft rollcollar shirt
underneath and wearing a large widestriped cap peculiarly offensive
in its size and shape to Cowperwood He could not help thinking how
uncanny the mans squint eyes looked under its straight outstanding
visor The trusty had a silly sycophantic manner of raising one hand
in salute He was a professional secondstory man up for ten years
but by dint of good behavior he had attained to the honor of working
about this office without the degrading hood customary for prisoners to
wear over the cap For this he was properly grateful He now considered
his superior with nervous doglike eyes and looked at Cowperwood with a
certain cunning appreciation of his lot and a show of initial mistrust

One prisoner is as good as another to the average convict as a matter
of fact it is their only consolation in their degradation that all who
come here are no better than they The world may have misused them but
they misuse their confreres in their thoughts The holier than thou
attitude intentional or otherwise is quite the last and most deadly
offense within prison walls This particular trusty could no more
understand Cowperwood than could a fly the motions of a flywheel but
with the cocky superiority of the underling of the world he did not
hesitate to think that he could A crook was a crook to himCowperwood
no less than the shabbiest pickpocket His one feeling was that he would
like to demean him to pull him down to his own level

You will have to take everything you have out of your pockets Kendall
now informed Cowperwood Ordinarily he would have said Search the
prisoner

Cowperwood stepped forward and laid out a purse with twentyfive dollars
in it a penknife a leadpencil a small notebook and a little
ivory elephant which Aileen had given him once for luck and which
he treasured solely because she gave it to him Kendall looked at
the latter curiously Now you can go on he said to the trusty
referring to the undressing and bathing process which was to follow

This way said the latter addressing Cowperwood and preceding him
into an adjoining room where three closets held three oldfashioned
ironbodied woodentop bathtubs with their attendant shelves for
rough crash towels yellow soap and the like and hooks for clothes

Get in there said the trusty whose name was Thomas Kuby pointing to
one of the tubs

Cowperwood realized that this was the beginning of petty official
supervision but he deemed it wise to appear friendly even here

I see he said I will

Thats right replied the attendant somewhat placated What did you
bring

Cowperwood looked at him quizzically He did not understand The prison
attendant realized that this man did not know the lingo of the place
What did you bring he repeated How many years did you get

Oh exclaimed Cowperwood comprehendingly I understand Four and
three months

He decided to humor the man It would probably be better so

What for inquired Kuby familiarly

Cowperwoods blood chilled slightly Larceny he said

Yuh got off easy commented Kuby Im up for ten A rube judge did
that to me

Kuby had never heard of Cowperwoods crime He would not have understood
its subtleties if he had Cowperwood did not want to talk to this
man he did not know how He wished he would go away but that was not
likely He wanted to be put in his cell and let alone

Thats too bad he answered and the convict realized clearly that
this man was really not one of them or he would not have said anything
like that Kuby went to the two hydrants opening into the bathtub and
turned them on Cowperwood had been undressing the while and now stood
naked but not ashamed in front of this eighthrate intelligence

Dont forget to wash your head too said Kuby and went away

Cowperwood stood there while the water ran meditating on his fate It
was strange how life had dealt with him of lateso severely Unlike
most men in his position he was not suffering from a consciousness
of evil He did not think he was evil As he saw it he was merely
unfortunate To think that he should be actually in this great silent
penitentiary a convict waiting here beside this cheap iron bathtub
not very sweet or hygienic to contemplate with this crackbrained
criminal to watch over him

He stepped into the tub and washed himself briskly with the biting
yellow soap drying himself on one of the rough only partially bleached
towels He looked for his underwear but there was none At this point
the attendant looked in again Out here he said inconsiderately

Cowperwood followed naked He was led through the receiving overseers
office into a room where were scales implements of measurement a
recordbook etc The attendant who stood guard at the door now came
over and the clerk who sat in a corner automatically took down a
recordblank Kendall surveyed Cowperwoods decidedly graceful figure
already inclining to a slight thickening around the waist and approved
of it as superior to that of most who came here His skin as he
particularly noted was especially white

Step on the scale said the attendant brusquely

Cowperwood did so The former adjusted the weights and scanned the
record carefully

Weight one hundred and seventyfive he called Now step over here

He indicated a spot in the side wall where was fastened in a thin
slatwhich ran from the floor to about seven and one half feet above
perpendicularlya small movable wooden indicator which when a man was
standing under it could be pressed down on his head At the side of
the slat were the total inches of height laid off in halves quarters
eighths and so on and to the right a length measurement for the arm
Cowperwood understood what was wanted and stepped under the indicator
standing quite straight

Feet level back to the wall urged the attendant So Height five
feet nine and tensixteenths he called The clerk in the corner noted
it He now produced a tapemeasure and began measuring Cowperwoods
arms legs chest waist hips etc He called out the color of his
eyes his hair his mustache and looking into his mouth exclaimed
Teeth all sound

After Cowperwood had once more given his address age profession
whether he knew any trade etcwhich he did nothe was allowed
to return to the bathroom and put on the clothing which the prison
provided for himfirst the rough prickly underwear then the cheap
soft rollcollar whitecotton shirt then the thick bluishgray cotton
socks of a quality such as he had never worn in his life and over these
a pair of indescribable roughleather clogs which felt to his feet as
though they were made of wood or ironoily and heavy He then drew on
the shapeless baggy trousers with their telltale stripes and over his
arms and chest the loosecut shapeless coat and waistcoat He felt and
knew of course that he looked very strange wretched And as he stepped
out into the overseers room again he experienced a peculiar sense of
depression a gone feeling which before this had not assailed him and
which now he did his best to conceal This then was what society did
to the criminal he thought to himself It took him and tore away from
his body and his life the habiliments of his proper state and left him
these He felt sad and grim and try as he wouldhe could not help
showing it for a moment It was always his business and his intention
to conceal his real feelings but now it was not quite possible He felt
degraded impossible in these clothes and he knew that he looked
it Nevertheless he did his best to pull himself together and look
unconcerned willing obedient considerate of those above him After
all he said to himself it was all a play of sorts a dream even if
one chose to view it so a miasma even from which in the course of
time and with a little luck one might emerge safely enough He hoped so
It could not last He was only acting a strange unfamiliar part on the
stage this stage of life that he knew so well

Kendall did not waste any time looking at him however He merely said
to his assistant See if you can find a cap for him and the latter
going to a closet containing numbered shelves took down a capa
highcrowned straightvisored shabby striped affair which Cowperwood
was asked to try on It fitted well enough slipping down close over his
ears and he thought that now his indignities must be about complete
What could be added There could be no more of these disconcerting
accoutrements But he was mistaken Now Kuby you take him to Mr
Chapin said Kendall

Kuby understood He went back into the washroom and produced what
Cowperwood had heard of but never before seena blueandwhitestriped
cotton bag about half the length of an ordinary pillowcase and half
again as wide which Kuby now unfolded and shook out as he came toward
him It was a custom The use of this hood dating from the earliest
days of the prison was intended to prevent a sense of location and
direction and thereby obviate any attempt to escape Thereafter during
all his stay he was not supposed to walk with or talk to or see another
prisonernot even to converse with his superiors unless addressed It
was a grim theory and yet one definitely enforced here although as he
was to learn later even this could be modified here

Youll have to put this on Kuby said and opened it in such a way
that it could be put over Cowperwoods head

Cowperwood understood He had heard of it in some way in times past He
was a little shockedlooked at it first with a touch of real surprise
but a moment after lifted his hands and helped pull it down

Never mind cautioned the guard put your hands down Ill get it
over

Cowperwood dropped his arms When it was fully on it came to about his
chest giving him little means of seeing anything He felt very strange
very humiliated very downcast This simple thing of a blueandwhite
striped bag over his head almost cost him his sense of selfpossession
Why could not they have spared him this last indignity he thought

This way said his attendant and he was led out to where he could not
say

If you hold it out in front you can see to walk said his guide and
Cowperwood pulled it out thus being able to discern his feet and a
portion of the floor below He was thus conductedseeing nothing in his
transitdown a short walk then through a long corridor then through a
room of uniformed guards and finally up a narrow flight of iron steps
leading to the overseers office on the second floor of one of the
twotier blocks There he heard the voice of Kuby saying Mr Chapin
heres another prisoner for you from Mr Kendall

Ill be there in a minute came a peculiarly pleasant voice from the
distance Presently a big heavy hand closed about his arm and he was
conducted still further

You haint got far to go now the voice said and then Ill take
that bag off and Cowperwood felt for some reason a sense of sympathy
perhapsas though he would choke The further steps were not many

A cell door was reached and unlocked by the inserting of a great iron
key It was swung open and the same big hand guided him through A
moment later the bag was pulled easily from his head and he saw that he
was in a narrow whitewashed cell rather dim windowless but lighted
from the top by a small skylight of frosted glass three and one half
feet long by four inches wide For a night light there was a tinbodied
lamp swinging from a hook near the middle of one of the side walls A
rough iron cot furnished with a straw mattress and two pairs of dark
blue probably unwashed blankets stood in one corner There was a
hydrant and small sink in another A small shelf occupied the wall
opposite the bed A plain wooden chair with a homely round back stood at
the foot of the bed and a fairly serviceable broom was standing in one
corner There was an iron stool or pot for excreta giving as he could
see into a large drainpipe which ran along the inside wall and which
was obviously flushed by buckets of water being poured into it Rats
and other vermin infested this and it gave off an unpleasant odor which
filled the cell The floor was of stone Cowperwoods clearseeing
eyes took it all in at a glance He noted the hard cell door which was
barred and crossbarred with great round rods of steel and fastened
with a thick highly polished lock He saw also that beyond this was a
heavy wooden door which could shut him in even more completely than the
iron one There was no chance for any clear purifying sunlight here
Cleanliness depended entirely on whitewash soap and water and sweeping
which in turn depended on the prisoners themselves

He also took in Chapin the homely goodnatured cell overseer whom he
now saw for the first timea large heavy lumbering man rather dusty
and misshapenlooking whose uniform did not fit him well and whose
manner of standing made him look as though he would much prefer to sit
down He was obviously bulky but not strong and his kindly face was
covered with a short growth of grayishbrown whiskers His hair was cut
badly and stuck out in odd strings or wisps from underneath his big cap
Nevertheless Cowperwood was not at all unfavorably impressedquite the
contraryand he felt at once that this man might be more considerate of
him than the others had been He hoped so anyhow He did not know that
he was in the presence of the overseer of the manners squad who would
have him in charge for two weeks only instructing him in the rules of
the prison and that he was only one of twentysix all told who were
in Chapins care

That worthy by way of easy introduction now went over to the bed
and seated himself on it He pointed to the hard wooden chair which
Cowperwood drew out and sat on

Well now youre here haint yuh he asked and answered himself
quite genially for he was an unlettered man generously disposed of
long experience with criminals and inclined to deal kindly with kindly
temperament and a form of religious beliefQuakerismhad inclined him
to be merciful and yet his official duties as Cowperwood later found
out seemed to have led him to the conclusion that most criminals
were innately bad Like Kendall he regarded them as weaklings and
neerdowells with evil streaks in them and in the main he was not
mistaken Yet he could not help being what he was a fatherly kindly
old man having faith in those shibboleths of the weak and inexperienced
mentallyhuman justice and human decency

Yes Im here Mr Chapin Cowperwood replied simply remembering his
name from the attendant and flattering the keeper by the use of it

To old Chapin the situation was more or less puzzling This was the
famous Frank A Cowperwood whom he had read about the noted banker and
treasurylooter He and his copartner in crime Stener were destined
to serve as he had read comparatively long terms here Five hundred
thousand dollars was a large sum of money in those days much more
than five million would have been forty years later He was awed by the
thought of what had become of ithow Cowperwood managed to do all
the things the papers had said he had done He had a little formula of
questions which he usually went through with each new prisonerasking
him if he was sorry now for the crime he had committed if he meant to
do better with a new chance if his father and mother were alive
etc and by the manner in which they answered these questionssimply
regretfully defiantly or otherwisehe judged whether they were being
adequately punished or not Yet he could not talk to Cowperwood as
he now saw or as he would to the average secondstory burglar
storelooter pickpocket and plain cheap thief and swindler And yet he
scarcely knew how else to talk

Well now he went on I dont suppose you ever thought youd get to
a place like this did you Mr Cowperwood

I never did replied Frank simply I wouldnt have believed it a few
months ago Mr Chapin I dont think I deserve to be here now though
of course there is no use of my telling you that

He saw that old Chapin wanted to moralize a little and he was only too
glad to fall in with his mood He would soon be alone with no one to
talk to perhaps and if a sympathetic understanding could be reached
with this man now so much the better Any port in a storm any straw to
a drowning man

Well no doubt all of us makes mistakes continued Mr Chapin
superiorly with an amusing faith in his own value as a moral guide and
reformer We cant just always tell how the plans we think so fine are
coming out can we Youre here now an I suppose youre sorry certain
things didnt come out just as you thought but if you had a chance I
dont suppose youd try to do just as you did before now would yuh

No Mr Chapin I wouldnt exactly said Cowperwood truly enough
though I believed I was right in everything I did I dont think legal
justice has really been done me

Well thats the way continued Chapin meditatively scratching his
grizzled head and looking genially about Sometimes as I allers says
to some of these here young fellers that comes in here we dont know as
much as we thinks we does We forget that others are just as smart as we
are and that there are allers people that are watchin us all the time
These here courts and jails and detectivestheyre here all the time
and they get us I gadChapins moral version of by Godthey do
if we dont behave

Yes Cowperwood replied thats true enough Mr Chapin

Well continued the old man after a time after he had made a few more
solemn owllike and yet wellintentioned remarks now heres your
bed and theres your chair and theres your washstand and theres
your watercloset Now keep em all clean and use em right You would
have thought he was making Cowperwood a present of a fortune Youre
the ones got to make up your bed every mornin and keep your floor
swept and your toilet flushed and your cell clean There haint anybody
herell do that for yuh You want to do all them things the first thing
in the mornin when you get up and afterward youll get sumpin to eat
about sixthirty Youre supposed to get up at fivethirty

Yes Mr Chapin Cowperwood said politely You can depend on me to
do all those things promptly

There haint so much more added Chapin Youre supposed to wash
yourself all over once a week an Ill give you a clean towel for that
Next you gotta wash this floor up every Friday mornin Cowperwood
winced at that You kin have hot water for that if you want it Ill
have one of the runners bring it to you An as for your friends and
relationshe got up and shook himself like a big Newfoundland dog
You gotta wife haint you

Yes replied Cowperwood

Well the rules here are that your wife or your friends kin come to see
you once in three months and your lawyeryou gotta lawyer haint yuh

Yes sir replied Cowperwood amused

Well he kin come every week or so if he likesevery day I
guessthere haint no rules about lawyers But you kin only write one
letter once in three months yourself an if you want anything like
tobaccer or the like o that from the storeroom you gotta sign an
order for it if you got any money with the warden an then I can git
it for you

The old man was really above taking small tips in the shape of money
He was a holdover from a much more severe and honest regime but
subsequent presents or constant flattery were not amiss in making him
kindly and generous Cowperwood read him accurately

Very well Mr Chapin I understand he said getting up as the old
man did

Then when you have been here two weeks added Chapin rather
ruminatively he had forgot to state this to Cowperwood before the
warden ll come and git yuh and give yuh yer regular cell summers
downstairs Yuh kin make up yer mind by that time what yud like tuh
do what yud like to work at If you behave yourself proper moren
like theyll give yuh a cell with a yard Yuh never can tell

He went out locking the door with a solemn click and Cowperwood stood
there a little more depressed than he had been because of this latest
intelligence Only two weeks and then he would be transferred from this
kindly old mans care to anothers whom he did not know and with whom
he might not fare so well

If ever you want me for anythingif yere sick or sumpin like that
Chapin now returned to say after he had walked a few paces away we
have a signal here of our own Just hang your towel out through these
here bars Ill see it and Ill stop and find out what yuh want when
Im passin

Cowperwood whose spirits had sunk revived for the moment

Yes sir he replied thank you Mr Chapin

The old man walked away and Cowperwood heard his steps dying down
the cementpaved hall He stood and listened his ears being greeted
occasionally by a distant cough a faint scraping of some ones feet
the hum or whir of a machine or the iron scratch of a key in a lock
None of the noises was loud Rather they were all faint and far away
He went over and looked at the bed which was not very clean and without
linen and anything but wide or soft and felt it curiously So here
was where he was to sleep from now onhe who so craved and appreciated
luxury and refinement If Aileen or some of his rich friends should see
him here Worse he was sickened by the thought of possible vermin
How could he tell How would he do The one chair was abominable The
skylight was weak He tried to think of himself as becoming accustomed
to the situation but he rediscovered the offal pot in one corner and
that discouraged him It was possible that rats might come up hereit
looked that way No pictures no books no scene no person no space to
walkjust the four bare walls and silence which he would be shut into
at night by the thick door What a horrible fate

He sat down and contemplated his situation So here he was at last in
the Eastern Penitentiary and doomed according to the judgment of the
politicians Butler among others to remain here four long years and
longer Stener it suddenly occurred to him was probably being put
through the same process he had just gone through Poor old Stener
What a fool he had made of himself But because of his foolishness he
deserved all he was now getting But the difference between himself and
Stener was that they would let Stener out It was possible that already
they were easing his punishment in some way that he Cowperwood did not
know He put his hand to his chin thinkinghis business his house
his friends his family Aileen He felt for his watch but remembered
that they had taken that There was no way of telling the time Neither
had he any notebook pen or pencil with which to amuse or interest
himself Besides he had had nothing to eat since morning Still that
mattered little What did matter was that he was shut up here away from
the world quite alone quite lonely without knowing what time it
was and that he could not attend to any of the things he ought to
be attending tohis business affairs his future True Steger would
probably come to see him after a while That would help a little But
even sothink of his position his prospects up to the day of the fire
and his state now He sat looking at his shoes his suit God He got
up and walked to and fro to and fro but his own steps and movements
sounded so loud He walked to the cell door and looked out through the
thick bars but there was nothing to seenothing save a portion of two
cell doors opposite something like his own He came back and sat in his
single chair meditating but getting weary of that finally stretched
himself on the dirty prison bed to try it It was not uncomfortable
entirely He got up after a while however and sat then walked
then sat What a narrow place to walk he thought This was
horriblesomething like a living tomb And to think he should be here
now day after day and day after day untiluntil what Until
the Governor pardoned him or his time was up or his fortune eaten
awayor

So he cogitated while the hours slipped by It was nearly five oclock
before Steger was able to return and then only for a little while
He had been arranging for Cowperwoods appearance on the following
Thursday Friday and Monday in his several court proceedings When he
was gone however and the night fell and Cowperwood had to trim his
little shabby oillamp and to drink the strong tea and eat the rough
poor bread made of bran and white flour which was shoved to him
through the small aperture in the door by the trencher trusty who was
accompanied by the overseer to see that it was done properly he really
felt very badly And after that the center wooden door of his cell was
presently closed and locked by a trusty who slammed it rudely and said
no word Nine oclock would be sounded somewhere by a great bell he
understood when his smoky oillamp would have to be put out promptly
and he would have to undress and go to bed There were punishments
no doubt for infractions of these rulesreduced rations the
straitjacket perhaps stripeshe scarcely knew what He felt
disconsolate grim weary He had put up such a long unsatisfactory
fight After washing his heavy stone cup and tin plate at the hydrant
he took off the sickening uniform and shoes and even the drawers of
the scratching underwear and stretched himself wearily on the bed The
place was not any too warm and he tried to make himself comfortable
between the blanketsbut it was of little use His soul was cold

This will never do he said to himself This will never do Im not
sure whether I can stand much of this or not Still he turned his face
to the wall and after several hours sleep eventually came





Chapter LIV


Those who by any pleasing courtesy of fortune accident of birth
inheritance or the wisdom of parents or friends have succeeded in
avoiding making that anathema of the prosperous and comfortable a
mess of their lives will scarcely understand the mood of Cowperwood
sitting rather gloomily in his cell these first days wondering what in
spite of his great ingenuity was to become of him The strongest have
their hours of depression There are times when life to those endowed
with the greatest intelligenceperhaps mostly to thosetakes on a
somber hue They see so many phases of its dreary subtleties It is
only when the soul of man has been built up into some strange
selfconfidence some curious faith in its own powers based no doubt
on the actual presence of these same powers subtly involved in the body
that it fronts life unflinchingly It would be too much to say that
Cowperwoods mind was of the first order It was subtle enough in all
conscienceand involved as is common with the executively great with
a strong sense of personal advancement It was a powerful mind turning
like a vast searchlight a glittering ray into many a dark corner but
it was not sufficiently disinterested to search the ultimate dark
He realized in a way what the great astronomers sociologists
philosophers chemists physicists and physiologists were meditating
but he could not be sure in his own mind that whatever it was it was
important for him No doubt life held many strange secrets Perhaps it
was essential that somebody should investigate them However that might
be the call of his own soul was in another direction His business was
to make moneyto organize something which would make him much money
or better yet save the organization he had begun

But this as he now looked upon it was almost impossible It had been
too disarranged and complicated by unfortunate circumstances He might
as Steger pointed out to him string out these bankruptcy proceedings
for years tiring out one creditor and another but in the meantime the
properties involved were being seriously damaged Interest charges
on his unsatisfied loans were making heavy inroads court costs were
mounting up and to cap it all he had discovered with Steger that
there were a number of creditorsthose who had sold out to Butler and
incidentally to Mollenhauerwho would never accept anything except the
full value of their claims His one hope now was to save what he could
by compromise a little later and to build up some sort of profitable
business through Stephen Wingate The latter was coming in a day or two
as soon as Steger had made some working arrangement for him with
Warden Michael Desmas who came the second day to have a look at the new
prisoner

Desmas was a large man physicallyIrish by birth a politician by
trainingwho had been one thing and another in Philadelphia from a
policeman in his early days and a corporal in the Civil War to a
ward captain under Mollenhauer He was a canny man tall rawboned
singularly muscularlooking who for all his fiftyseven years looked
as though he could give a splendid account of himself in a physical
contest His hands were large and bony his face more square than
either round or long and his forehead high He had a vigorous growth
of shortclipped irongray hair and a bristly irongray mustache
very short keen intelligent bluegray eyes a florid complexion
and evenedged savagelooking teeth which showed the least bit in
a slightly wolfish way when he smiled However he was not as cruel a
person as he looked to be temperamental to a certain extent hard and
on occasions savage but with kindly hours also His greatest weakness
was that he was not quite mentally able to recognize that there were
mental and social differences between prisoners and that now and then
one was apt to appear here who with or without political influences
was eminently worthy of special consideration What he could recognize
was the differences pointed out to him by the politicians in special
cases such as that of Stenernot Cowperwood However seeing that
the prison was a public institution apt to be visited at any time by
lawyers detectives doctors preachers propagandists and the public
generally and that certain rules and regulations had to be enforced if
for no other reason than to keep a moral and administrative control over
his own help it was necessary to maintainand that even in the face
of the politiciana certain amount of discipline system and order
and it was not possible to be too liberal with any one There were
however exceptional casesmen of wealth and refinement victims
of those occasional uprisings which so shocked the political leaders
generallywho had to be looked after in a friendly way

Desmas was quite aware of course of the history of Cowperwood and
Stener The politicians had already given him warning that Stener
because of his past services to the community was to be treated with
special consideration Not so much was said about Cowperwood although
they did admit that his lot was rather hard Perhaps he might do a
little something for him but at his own risk

Butler is down on him Strobik said to Desmas on one occasion Its
that girl of his thats at the bottom of it all If you listened to
Butler youd feed him on bread and water but he isnt a bad fellow
As a matter of fact if George had had any sense Cowperwood wouldnt be
where he is today But the big fellows wouldnt let Stener alone They
wouldnt let him give Cowperwood any money

Although Strobik had been one of those who under pressure from
Mollenhauer had advised Stener not to let Cowperwood have any more
money yet here he was pointing out the folly of the victims course
The thought of the inconsistency involved did not trouble him in the
least

Desmas decided therefore that if Cowperwood were persona non grata to
the Big Three it might be necessary to be indifferent to him or at
least slow in extending him any special favors For Stener a good chair
clean linen special cutlery and dishes the daily papers privileges
in the matter of mail the visits of friends and the like For
Cowperwoodwell he would have to look at Cowperwood and see what he
thought At the same time Stegers intercessions were not without their
effect on Desmas So the morning after Cowperwoods entrance the warden
received a letter from Terrence Relihan the Harrisburg potentate
indicating that any kindness shown to Mr Cowperwood would be duly
appreciated by him Upon the receipt of this letter Desmas went up and
looked through Cowperwoods iron door On the way he had a brief talk
with Chapin who told him what a nice man he thought Cowperwood was

Desmas had never seen Cowperwood before but in spite of the shabby
uniform the clog shoes the cheap shirt and the wretched cell he was
impressed Instead of the weak anaemic body and the shifty eyes of the
average prisoner he saw a man whose face and form blazed energy and
power and whose vigorous erectness no wretched clothes or conditions
could demean He lifted his head when Desmas appeared glad that any
form should have appeared at his door and looked at him with large
clear examining eyesthose eyes that in the past had inspired so
much confidence and surety in all those who had known him Desmas was
stirred Compared with Stener whom he knew in the past and whom he had
met on his entry this man was a force Say what you will one vigorous
man inherently respects another And Desmas was vigorous physically He
eyed Cowperwood and Cowperwood eyed him Instinctively Desmas liked him
He was like one tiger looking at another

Instinctively Cowperwood knew that he was the warden This is Mr
Desmas isnt it he asked courteously and pleasantly

Yes sir Im the man replied Desmas interestedly These rooms are
not as comfortable as they might be are they The wardens even teeth
showed in a friendly yet wolfish way

They certainly are not Mr Desmas replied Cowperwood standing
very erect and soldierlike I didnt imagine I was coming to a hotel
however He smiled

There isnt anything special I can do for you is there Mr
Cowperwood began Desmas curiously for he was moved by a thought that
at some time or other a man such as this might be of service to him
Ive been talking to your lawyer Cowperwood was intensely gratified
by the Mr So that was the way the wind was blowing Well then within
reason things might not prove so bad here He would see He would sound
this man out

I dont want to be asking anything Warden which you cannot reasonably
give he now returned politely But there are a few things of course
that I would change if I could I wish I might have sheets for my bed
and I could afford better underwear if you would let me wear it This
that I have on annoys me a great deal

Theyre not the best wool thats true enough replied Desmas
solemnly Theyre made for the State out here in Pennsylvania
somewhere I suppose theres no objection to your wearing your own
underwear if you want to Ill see about that And the sheets too We
might let you use them if you have them Well have to go a little slow
about this There are a lot of people that take a special interest in
showing the warden how to tend to his business

I can readily understand that Warden went on Cowperwood briskly
and Im certainly very much obliged to you You may be sure that
anything you do for me here will be appreciated and not misused and
that I have friends on the outside who can reciprocate for me in the
course of time He talked slowly and emphatically looking Desmas
directly in the eye all of the time Desmas was very much impressed

Thats all right he said now that he had gone so far as to be
friendly I cant promise much Prison rules are prison rules But
there are some things that can be done because its the rule to do them
for other men when they behave themselves You can have a better chair
than that if you want it and something to read too If youre in
business yet I wouldnt want to do anything to stop that We cant have
people running in and out of here every fifteen minutes and you cant
turn a cell into a business officethats not possible It would break
up the order of the place Still theres no reason why you shouldnt
see some of your friends now and then As for your mailwell that will
have to be opened in the ordinary way for the time being anyhow Ill
have to see about that I cant promise too much Youll have to wait
until you come out of this block and downstairs Some of the cells
have a yard there if there are any empty The warden cocked his eye
wisely and Cowperwood saw that his tot was not to be as bad as he
had anticipatedthough bad enough The warden spoke to him about the
different trades he might follow and asked him to think about the one
he would prefer You want to have something to keep your hands busy
whatever else you want Youll find youll need that Everybody here
wants to work after a time I notice that

Cowperwood understood and thanked Desmas profusely The horror of
idleness in silence and in a cell scarcely large enough to turn around
in comfortably had already begun to creep over him and the thought of
being able to see Wingate and Steger frequently and to have his mail
reach him after a time untampered with was a great relief He was
to have his own underwear silk and woolthank Godand perhaps
they would let him take off these shoes after a while With these
modifications and a trade and perhaps the little yard which Desmas had
referred to his life would be if not ideal at least tolerable The
prison was still a prison but it looked as though it might not be so
much of a terror to him as obviously it must be to many

During the two weeks in which Cowperwood was in the manners squad
in care of Chapin he learned nearly as much as he ever learned of the
general nature of prison life for this was not an ordinary penitentiary
in the sense that the prison yard the prison squad the prison
lockstep the prison diningroom and prison associated labor make the
ordinary penitentiary There was for him and for most of those confined
there no general prison life whatsoever The large majority were
supposed to work silently in their cells at the particular tasks
assigned them and not to know anything of the remainder of the life
which went on around them the rule of this prison being solitary
confinement and few being permitted to work at the limited number of
outside menial tasks provided Indeed as he sensed and as old Chapin
soon informed him not more than seventyfive of the four hundred
prisoners confined here were so employed and not all of these
regularlycooking gardening in season milling and general cleaning
being the only avenues of escape from solitude Even those who so worked
were strictly forbidden to talk and although they did not have to wear
the objectionable hood when actually employed they were supposed
to wear it in going to and from their work Cowperwood saw them
occasionally tramping by his cell door and it struck him as strange
uncanny grim He wished sincerely at times since old Chapin was so
genial and talkative that he were to be under him permanently but it
was not to be

His two weeks soon passeddrearily enough in all conscience but
they passed interlaced with his few commonplace tasks of bedmaking
floorsweeping dressing eating undressing rising at fivethirty and
retiring at nine washing his several dishes after each meal etc He
thought he would never get used to the food Breakfast as has been
said was at sixthirty and consisted of coarse black bread made of
bran and some white flour and served with black coffee Dinner was at
eleventhirty and consisted of bean or vegetable soup with some coarse
meat in it and the same bread Supper was at six of tea and bread
very strong tea and the same breadno butter no milk no sugar
Cowperwood did not smoke so the small allowance of tobacco which was
permitted was without value to him Steger called in every day for two
or three weeks and after the second day Stephen Wingate as his new
business associate was permitted to see him alsoonce every day if he
wished Desmas stated though the latter felt he was stretching a point
in permitting this so soon Both of these visits rarely occupied more
than an hour or an hour and a half and after that the day was long He
was taken out on several days on a court order between nine and five
to testify in the bankruptcy proceedings against him which caused the
time in the beginning to pass quickly

It was curious once he was in prison safely shut from the world for
a period of years apparently how quickly all thought of assisting him
departed from the minds of those who had been most friendly He was
done so most of them thought The only thing they could do now would
be to use their influence to get him out some time how soon they could
not guess Beyond that there was nothing He would really never be of
any great importance to any one any more or so they thought It was
very sad very tragic but he was gonehis place knew him not

A bright young man that observed President Davison of the Girard
National on reading of Cowperwoods sentence and incarceration Too
bad Too bad He made a great mistake

Only his parents Aileen and his wifethe latter with mingled feelings
of resentment and sorrowreally missed him Aileen because of her
great passion for him was suffering most of all Four years and three
months she thought If he did not get out before then she would be
nearing twentynine and he would be nearing forty Would he want her
then Would she be so attractive And would nearly five years change his
point of view He would have to wear a convict suit all that time and
be known as a convict forever after It was hard to think about but
only made her more than ever determined to cling to him whatever
happened and to help him all she could

Indeed the day after his incarceration she drove out and looked at the
grim gray walls of the penitentiary Knowing nothing absolutely of the
vast and complicated processes of law and penal servitude it seemed
especially terrible to her What might not they be doing to her Frank
Was he suffering much Was he thinking of her as she was of him Oh the
pity of it all The pity The pity of herselfher great love for him
She drove home determined to see him but as he had originally told
her that visiting days were only once in three months and that he would
have to write her when the next one was or when she could come or when
he could see her on the outside she scarcely knew what to do Secrecy
was the thing

The next day however she wrote him just the same describing the drive
she had taken on the stormy afternoon beforethe terror of the
thought that he was behind those grim gray wallsand declaring
her determination to see him soon And this letter under the new
arrangement he received at once He wrote her in reply giving the
letter to Wingate to mail It ran

My sweet girlI fancy you are a little downhearted to think I cannot
be with you any more soon but you mustnt be I suppose you read
all about the sentence in the paper I came out here the same
morningnearly noon If I had time dearest Id write you a long
letter describing the situation so as to ease your mind but I havent
Its against the rules and I am really doing this secretly Im here
though safe enough and wish I were out of course Sweetest you must
be careful how you try to see me at first You cant do me much service
outside of cheering me up and you may do yourself great harm Besides
I think I have done you far more harm than I can ever make up to you and
that you had best give me up although I know you do not think so and
I would be sad if you did I am to be in the Court of Special Pleas
Sixth and Chestnut on Friday at two oclock but you cannot see me
there Ill be out in charge of my counsel You must be careful Perhaps
youll think better and not come here

This last touch was one of pure gloom the first Cowperwood had ever
introduced into their relationship but conditions had changed him
Hitherto he had been in the position of the superior being the one
who was being soughtalthough Aileen was and had been well worth
seekingand he had thought that he might escape unscathed and so grow
in dignity and power until she might not possibly be worthy of him
any longer He had had that thought But here in stripes it was a
different matter Aileens position reduced in value as it was by her
long ardent relationship with him was now nevertheless superior to
hisapparently so For after all was she not Edward Butlers daughter
and might she after she had been away from him a while wish to become
a convicts bride She ought not to want to and she might not want to
for all he knew she might change her mind She ought not to wait
for him Her life was not yet ruined The public did not know so he
thoughtnot generally anyhowthat she had been his mistress She might
marry Why not and so pass out of his life forever And would not that
be sad for him And yet did he not owe it to her to a sense of fair
play in himself to ask her to give him up or at least think over the
wisdom of doing so

He did her the justice to believe that she would not want to give him
up and in his position however harmful it might be to her it was an
advantage a connecting link with the finest period of his past life
to have her continue to love him He could not however scribbling this
note in his cell in Wingates presence and giving it to him to mail
Overseer Chapin was kindly keeping a respectful distance though he was
supposed to be present refrain from adding at the last moment this
little touch of doubt which when she read it struck Aileen to the
heart She read it as gloom on his partas great depression Perhaps
after all the penitentiary and so soon was really breaking his spirit
and he had held up so courageously so long Because of this now she was
madly eager to get to him to console him even though it was difficult
perilous She must she said

In regard to visits from the various members of his familyhis mother
and father his brother his wife and his sisterCowperwood made
it plain to them on one of the days on which he was out attending a
bankruptcy hearing that even providing it could be arranged he did
not think they should come oftener than once in three months unless he
wrote them or sent word by Steger The truth was that he really did not
care to see much of any of them at present He was sick of the whole
social scheme of things In fact he wanted to be rid of the turmoil he
had been in seeing it had proved so useless He had used nearly fifteen
thousand dollars thus far in defending himselfcourt costs family
maintenance Steger etc but he did not mind that He expected to make
some little money working through Wingate His family were not utterly
without funds sufficient to live on in a small way He had advised them
to remove into houses more in keeping with their reduced circumstances
which they had donehis mother and father and brothers and sister to
a threestory brick house of about the caliber of the old Buttonwood
Street house and his wife to a smaller less expensive twostory one on
North Twentyfirst Street near the penitentiary a portion of the money
saved out of the thirtyfive thousand dollars extracted from Stener
under false pretenses aiding to sustain it Of course all this was
a terrible descent from the Girard Avenue mansion for the elder
Cowperwood for here was none of the furniture which characterized
the other somewhat gorgeous domicilemerely storebought readymade
furniture and neat but cheap hangings and fixtures generally The
assignees to whom all Cowperwoods personal property belonged and to
whom Cowperwood the elder had surrendered all his holdings would not
permit anything of importance to be removed It had all to be sold for
the benefit of creditors A few very small things but only a few had
been kept as everything had been inventoried some time before One of
the things which old Cowperwood wanted was his own desk which Frank had
had designed for him but as it was valued at five hundred dollars and
could not be relinquished by the sheriff except on payment of that sum
or by auction and as Henry Cowperwood had no such sum to spare he had
to let the desk go There were many things they all wanted and Anna
Adelaide had literally purloined a few though she did not admit the fact
to her parents until long afterward

There came a day when the two houses in Girard Avenue were the scene
of a sheriffs sale during which the general public without let or
hindrance was permitted to tramp through the rooms and examine the
pictures statuary and objects of art generally which were
auctioned off to the highest bidder Considerable fame had attached to
Cowperwoods activities in this field owing in the first place to the
real merit of what he had brought together and in the next place to the
enthusiastic comment of such men as Wilton Ellsworth Fletcher Norton
Gordon Strakearchitects and art dealers whose judgment and taste were
considered important in Philadelphia All of the lovely things by which
he had set great storesmall bronzes representative of the best
period of the Italian Renaissance bits of Venetian glass which he had
collected with great carea full curio case statues by Powers Hosmer
and Thorwaldsenthings which would be smiled at thirty years later
but which were of high value then all of his pictures by representative
American painters from Gilbert to Eastman Johnson together with a few
specimens of the current French and English schools went for a song
Art judgment in Philadelphia at this time was not exceedingly high
and some of the pictures for lack of appreciative understanding were
disposed of at much too low a figure Strake Norton and Ellsworth
were all present and bought liberally Senator Simpson Mollenhauer and
Strobik came to see what they could see The smallfry politicians
were there en masse But Simpson calm judge of good art secured
practically the best of all that was offered To him went the curio
case of Venetian glass one pair of tall blueandwhite Mohammedan
cylindrical vases fourteen examples of Chinese jade including several
artists waterdishes and a pierced windowscreen of the faintest tinge
of green To Mollenhauer went the furniture and decorations of the
entryhall and receptionroom of Henry Cowperwoods house and to Edward
Strobik two of Cowperwoods birdseye maple bedroom suites for the most
modest of prices Adam Davis was present and secured the secretaire of
buhl which the elder Cowperwood prized so highly To Fletcher Norton
went the four Greek vasesa kylix a waterjar and two amphoraewhich
he had sold to Cowperwood and which he valued highly Various objects
of art including a Sevres dinner set a Gobelin tapestry Barye bronzes
and pictures by Detaille Fortuny and George Inness went to Walter
Leigh Arthur Rivers Joseph Zimmerman Judge Kitchen Harper Steger
Terrence Relihan Trenor Drake Mr and Mrs Simeon Jones W C
Davison Frewen Kasson Fletcher Norton and Judge Rafalsky

Within four days after the sale began the two houses were bare of their
contents Even the objects in the house at 931 North Tenth Street had
been withdrawn from storage where they had been placed at the time it
was deemed advisable to close this institution and placed on sale with
the other objects in the two homes It was at this time that the senior
Cowperwoods first learned of something which seemed to indicate a
mystery which had existed in connection with their son and his wife
No one of all the Cowperwoods was present during all this gloomy
distribution and Aileen reading of the disposition of all the wares
and knowing their value to Cowperwood to say nothing of their charm for
her was greatly depressed yet she was not long despondent for she was
convinced that Cowperwood would some day regain his liberty and attain a
position of even greater significance in the financial world She could
not have said why but she was sure of it





Chapter LV


In the meanwhile Cowperwood had been transferred to a new overseer and a
new cell in Block 3 on the ground door which was like all the others
in size ten by sixteen but to which was attached the small yard
previously mentioned Warden Desmas came up two days before he was
transferred and had another short conversation with him through his
cell door

Youll be transferred on Monday he said in his reserved slow way
Theyll give you a yard though it wont be much good to youwe
only allow a halfhour a day in it Ive told the overseer about your
business arrangements Hell treat you right in that matter Just be
careful not to take up too much time that way and things will work out
Ive decided to let you learn caning chairs Thatll be the best for
you Its easy and itll occupy your mind

The warden and some allied politicians made a good thing out of this
prison industry It was really not hard laborthe tasks set were simple
and not oppressive but all of the products were promptly sold and
the profits pocketed It was good therefore to see all the prisoners
working and it did them good Cowperwood was glad of the chance to
do something for he really did not care so much for books and his
connection with Wingate and his old affairs were not sufficient to
employ his mind in a satisfactory way At the same time he could not
help thinking if he seemed strange to himself now how much stranger
he would seem then behind these narrow bars working at so commonplace a
task as caning chairs Nevertheless he now thanked Desmas for this
as well as for the sheets and the toilet articles which had just been
brought in

Thats all right replied the latter pleasantly and softly by now
much intrigued by Cowperwood I know that there are men and men here
the same as anywhere If a man knows how to use these things and wants
to be clean I wouldnt be one to put anything in his way

The new overseer with whom Cowperwood had to deal was a very different
person from Elias Chapin His name was Walter Bonhag and he was not
more than thirtyseven years of agea big flabby sort of person with a
crafty mind whose principal object in life was to see that this prison
situation as he found it should furnish him a better income than his
normal salary provided A close study of Bonhag would have seemed to
indicate that he was a stoolpigeon of Desmas but this was really not
true except in a limited way Because Bonhag was shrewd and
sycophantic quick to see a point in his or anybody elses favor Desmas
instinctively realized that he was the kind of man who could be trusted
to be lenient on order or suggestion That is if Desmas had the least
interest in a prisoner he need scarcely say so much to Bonhag he might
merely suggest that this man was used to a different kind of life or
that because of some past experience it might go hard with him if he
were handled roughly and Bonhag would strain himself to be pleasant
The trouble was that to a shrewd man of any refinement his attentions
were objectionable being obviously offered for a purpose and to a poor
or ignorant man they were brutal and contemptuous He had built up an
extra income for himself inside the prison by selling the prisoners
extra allowances of things which he secretly brought into the prison It
was strictly against the rules in theory at least to bring in anything
which was not sold in the storeroomtobacco writing paper pens
ink whisky cigars or delicacies of any kind On the other hand and
excellently well for him it was true that tobacco of an inferior
grade was provided as well as wretched pens ink and paper so that no
selfrespecting man if he could help it would endure them Whisky
was not allowed at all and delicacies were abhorred as indicating rank
favoritism nevertheless they were brought in If a prisoner had the
money and was willing to see that Bonhag secured something for his
trouble almost anything would be forthcoming Also the privilege of
being sent into the general yard as a trusty or being allowed to stay
in the little private yard which some cells possessed longer than the
halfhour ordinarily permitted was sold

One of the things curiously enough at this time which worked in
Cowperwoods favor was the fact that Bonhag was friendly with the
overseer who had Stener in charge and Stener because of his political
friends was being liberally treated and Bonhag knew of this He was
not a careful reader of newspapers nor had he any intellectual grasp
of important events but he knew by now that both Stener and Cowperwood
were or had been individuals of great importance in the community
also that Cowperwood had been the more important of the two Better yet
as Bonhag now heard Cowperwood still had money Some prisoner who was
permitted to read the paper told him so And so entirely aside
from Warden Desmass recommendation which was given in a very quiet
noncommittal way Bonhag was interested to see what he could do for
Cowperwood for a price

The day Cowperwood was installed in his new cell Bonhag lolled up to
the door which was open and said in a semipatronizing way Got
all your things over yet It was his business to lock the door once
Cowperwood was inside it

Yes sir replied Cowperwood who had been shrewd enough to get the
new overseers name from Chapin this is Mr Bonhag I presume

Thats me replied Bonhag not a little flattered by the recognition
but still purely interested by the practical side of this encounter He
was anxious to study Cowperwood to see what type of man he was

Youll find it a little different down here from up there observed
Bonhag It aint so stuffy These doors out in the yards make a
difference

Oh yes said Cowperwood observantly and shrewdly that is the yard
Mr Desmas spoke of

At the mention of the magic name if Bonhag had been a horse his ears
would have been seen to lift For of course if Cowperwood was so
friendly with Desmas that the latter had described to him the type of
cell he was to have beforehand it behooved Bonhag to be especially
careful

Yes thats it but it aint much he observed They only allow a
halfhour a day in it Still it would be all right if a person could
stay out there longer

This was his first hint at graft favoritism and Cowperwood distinctly
caught the sound of it in his voice

Thats too bad he said I dont suppose good conduct helps a person
to get more He waited to hear a reply but instead Bonhag continued
with Id better teach you your new trade now Youve got to learn to
cane chairs so the warden says If you want we can begin right away
But without waiting for Cowperwood to acquiesce he went off returning
after a time with three unvarnished frames of chairs and a bundle
of cane strips or withes which he deposited on the floor Having so
doneand with a flourishhe now continued Now Ill show you if
youll watch me and he began showing Cowperwood how the strips were
to be laced through the apertures on either side cut and fastened
with little hickory pegs This done he brought a forcing awl a small
hammer a box of pegs and a pair of clippers After several brief
demonstrations with different strips as to how the geometric forms were
designed he allowed Cowperwood to take the matter in hand watching
over his shoulder The financier quick at anything manual or mental
went at it in his customary energetic fashion and in five minutes
demonstrated to Bonhag that barring skill and speed which could only
come with practice he could do it as well as another Youll make out
all right said Bonhag Youre supposed to do ten of those a day We
wont count the next few days though until you get your hand in After
that Ill come around and see how youre getting along You understand
about the towel on the door dont you he inquired

Yes Mr Chapin explained that to me replied Cowperwood I think I
know what most of the rules are now Ill try not to break any of them

The days which followed brought a number of modifications of his prison
lot but not sufficient by any means to make it acceptable to him
Bonhag during the first few days in which he trained Cowperwood in the
art of caning chairs managed to make it perfectly clear that there were
a number of things he would be willing to do for him One of the things
that moved him to this was that already he had been impressed by the
fact that Steners friends were coming to see him in larger numbers than
Cowperwoods sending him an occasional basket of fruit which he
gave to the overseers and that his wife and children had been already
permitted to visit him outside the regular visitingday This was a
cause for jealousy on Bonhags part His fellowoverseer was lording it
over himtelling him as it were of the high jinks in Block 4
Bonhag really wanted Cowperwood to spruce up and show what he could do
socially or otherwise

And so now he began with I see you have your lawyer and your partner
here every day There aint anybody else youd like to have visit you
is there Of course its against the rules to have your wife or sister
or anybody like that except on visiting days And here he paused
and rolled a large and informing eye on Cowperwoodsuch an eye as was
supposed to convey dark and mysterious things But all the rules aint
kept around here by a long shot

Cowperwood was not the man to lose a chance of this kind He smiled a
littleenough to relieve himself and to convey to Bonhag that he was
gratified by the information but vocally he observed Ill tell you
how it is Mr Bonhag I believe you understand my position better than
most men would and that I can talk to you There are people who would
like to come here but I have been afraid to let them come I did
not know that it could be arranged If it could be I would be very
grateful You and I are practical menI know that if any favors are
extended some of those who help to bring them about must be looked
after If you can do anything to make it a little more comfortable for
me here I will show you that I appreciate it I havent any money on my
person but I can always get it and I will see that you are properly
looked after

Bonhags short thick ears tingled This was the kind of talk he liked
to hear I can fix anything like that Mr Cowperwood he replied
servilely You leave it to me If theres any one you want to see at
any time just let me know Of course I have to be very careful and so
do you but thats all right too If you want to stay out in that yard
a little longer in the mornings or get out there afternoons or evenings
from now on why go ahead Its all right Ill just leave the door
open If the warden or anybody else should be around Ill just scratch
on your door with my key and you come in and shut it If theres
anything you want from the outside I can get it for youjelly or eggs
or butter or any little thing like that You might like to fix up your
meals a little that way

Im certainly most grateful Mr Bonhag returned Cowperwood in his
grandest manner and with a desire to smile but he kept a straight
face

In regard to that other matter went on Bonhag referring to the
matter of extra visitors I can fix that any time you want to I know
the men out at the gate If you want anybody to come here just write
em a note and give it to me and tell em to ask for me when they come
Thatll get em in all right When they get here you can talk to em
in your cell See Only when I tap they have to come out You want to
remember that So just you let me know

Cowperwood was exceedingly grateful He said so in direct choice
language It occurred to him at once that this was Aileens opportunity
and that he could now notify her to come If she veiled herself
sufficiently she would probably be safe enough He decided to write her
and when Wingate came he gave him a letter to mail

Two days later at three oclock in the afternoonthe time appointed
by himAileen came to see him She was dressed in gray broadcloth
with whitevelvet trimmings and cutsteel buttons which glistened like
silver and wore as additional ornaments as well as a protection
against the cold a cap stole and muff of snowwhite ermine Over
this rather striking costume she had slipped a long dark circular cloak
which she meant to lay off immediately upon her arrival She had made
a very careful toilet as to her shoes gloves hair and the gold
ornaments which she wore Her face was concealed by a thick green veil
as Cowperwood had suggested and she arrived at an hour when as near as
he had been able to prearrange he would be alone Wingate usually came
at four after business and Steger in the morning when he came at all
She was very nervous over this strange adventure leaving the streetcar
in which she had chosen to travel some distance away and walking up a
side street The cold weather and the gray walls under a gray sky gave
her a sense of defeat but she had worked very hard to look nice in
order to cheer her lover up She knew how readily he responded to the
influence of her beauty when properly displayed

Cowperwood in view of her coming had made his cell as acceptable as
possible It was clean because he had swept it himself and made his own
bed and besides he had shaved and combed his hair and otherwise put
himself to rights The caned chairs on which he was working had been put
in the corner at the end of the bed His few dishes were washed and
hung up and his clogs brushed with a brush which he now kept for the
purpose Never before he thought to himself with a peculiar feeling
of artistic degradation had Aileen seen him like this She had always
admired his good taste in clothes and the way he carried himself in
them and now she was to see him in garments which no dignity of body
could make presentable Only a stoic sense of his own souldignity aided
him here After all as he now thought he was Frank A Cowperwood
and that was something whatever he wore And Aileen knew it Again
he might be free and rich some day and he knew that she believed that
Best of all his looks under these or any other circumstances as he
knew would make no difference to Aileen She would only love him the
more It was her ardent sympathy that he was afraid of He was so glad
that Bonhag had suggested that she might enter the cell for it would be
a grim procedure talking to her through a barred door

When Aileen arrived she asked for Mr Bonhag and was permitted to go to
the central rotunda where he was sent for When he came she murmured
I wish to see Mr Cowperwood if you please and he exclaimed Oh
yes just come with me As he came across the rotunda floor from his
corridor he was struck by the evident youth of Aileen even though he
could not see her face This now was something in accordance with
what he had expected of Cowperwood A man who could steal five hundred
thousand dollars and set a whole city by the ears must have wonderful
adventures of all kinds and Aileen looked like a true adventure He led
her to the little room where he kept his desk and detained visitors and
then bustled down to Cowperwoods cell where the financier was working
on one of his chairs and scratching on the door with his key called
Theres a young lady here to see you Do you want to let her come
inside

Thank you yes replied Cowperwood and Bonhag hurried away
unintentionally forgetting in his boorish incivility to unlock the
cell door so that he had to open it in Aileens presence The long
corridor with its thick doors mathematically spaced gratings and
graystone pavement caused Aileen to feel faint at heart A prison
iron cells And he was in one of them It chilled her usually courageous
spirit What a terrible place for her Frank to be What a horrible thing
to have put him here Judges juries courts laws jails seemed like so
many foaming ogres ranged about the world glaring down upon her and
her loveaffair The clank of the key in the lock and the heavy outward
swinging of the door completed her sense of the untoward And then she
saw Cowperwood

Because of the price he was to receive Bonhag after admitting her
strolled discreetly away Aileen looked at Cowperwood from behind
her veil afraid to speak until she was sure Bonhag had gone And
Cowperwood who was retaining his selfpossession by an effort signaled
her but with difficulty after a moment or two Its all right he
said Hes gone away She lifted her veil removed her cloak and took
in without seeming to the stuffy narrow thickness of the room his
wretched shoes the cheap misshapen suit the iron door behind him
leading out into the little yard attached to his cell Against such a
background with his partially caned chairs visible at the end of the
bed he seemed unnatural weird even Her Frank And in this condition
She trembled and it was useless for her to try to speak She could only
put her arms around him and stroke his head murmuring My poor boymy
darling Is this what they have done to you Oh my poor darling She
held his head while Cowperwood anxious to retain his composure winced
and trembled too Her love was so fullso genuine It was so soothing
at the same time that it was unmanning as now he could see making of
him a child again And for the first time in his life some inexplicable
trick of chemistrythat chemistry of the body of blind forces which so
readily supersedes reason at timeshe lost his selfcontrol The
depth of Aileens feelings the cooing sound of her voice the velvety
tenderness of her hands that beauty that had drawn him all the
timemore radiant here perhaps within these hard walls and in the
face of his physical misery than it had ever been beforecompletely
unmanned him He did not understand how it could he tried to defy the
moods but he could not When she held his head close and caressed it
of a sudden in spite of himself his breast felt thick and stuffy and
his throat hurt him He felt for him an astonishingly strange feeling
a desire to cry which he did his best to overcome it shocked him so
There then combined and conspired to defeat him a strange rich picture
of the great world he had so recently lost of the lovely magnificent
world which he hoped some day to regain He felt more poignantly at this
moment than ever he had before the degradation of the clog shoes the
cotton shirt the striped suit the reputation of a convict permanent
and not to be laid aside He drew himself quickly away from her turned
his back clinched his hands drew his muscles taut but it was too
late He was crying and he could not stop

Oh damn it he exclaimed half angrily half selfcommiseratingly in
combined rage and shame Why should I cry What the devils the matter
with me anyhow

Aileen saw it She fairly flung herself in front of him seized his head
with one hand his shabby waist with the other and held him tight in a
grip that he could not have readily released

Oh honey honey honey she exclaimed pityingly feverishly I love
you I adore you They could cut my body into bits if it would do you
any good To think that they should make you cry Oh my sweet my
sweet my darling boy

She pulled his still shaking body tighter and with her free hand
caressed his head She kissed his eyes his hair his cheeks He pulled
himself loose again after a moment exclaiming What the devils got
into me but she drew him back

Never mind honey darling dont you be ashamed to cry Cry here on my
shoulder Cry here with me My babymy honey pet

He quieted down after a few moments cautioning her against Bonhag and
regaining his former composure which he was so ashamed to have lost

Youre a great girl pet he said with a tender and yet apologetic
smile Youre all rightall that I needa great help to me but dont
worry any longer about me dear Im all right It isnt as bad as you
think How are you

Aileen on her part was not to be soothed so easily His many woes
including his wretched position here outraged her sense of justice and
decency To think her fine wonderful Frank should be compelled to come
to thisto cry She stroked his head tenderly while wild deadly
unreasoning opposition to life and chance and untoward opposition surged
in her brain Her fatherdamn him Her familypooh What did she
care Her Frankher Frank How little all else mattered where he was
concerned Never never never would she desert himnevercome what
might And now she clung to him in silence while she fought in her
brain an awful battle with life and law and fate and circumstance
Lawnonsense Peoplethey were brutes devils enemies hounds She
was delighted eager crazy to make a sacrifice of herself She would go
anywhere for or with her Frank now She would do anything for him
Her family was nothinglife nothing nothing nothing She would do
anything he wished nothing more nothing less anything she could do to
save him to make his life happier but nothing for any one else





Chapter LVI


The days passed Once the understanding with Bonhag was reached
Cowperwoods wife mother and sister were allowed to appear on
occasions His wife and the children were now settled in the little
home for which he was paying and his financial obligations to her were
satisfied by Wingate who paid her one hundred and twenty five dollars
a month for him He realized that he owed her more but he was sailing
rather close to the wind financially these days The final collapse of
his old interests had come in March when he had been legally declared a
bankrupt and all his properties forfeited to satisfy the claims against
him The citys claim of five hundred thousand dollars would have eaten
up more than could have been realized at the time had not a pro rata
payment of thirty cents on the dollar been declared Even then the city
never received its due for by some hocuspocus it was declared to have
forfeited its rights Its claims had not been made at the proper time in
the proper way This left larger portions of real money for the others

Fortunately by now Cowperwood had begun to see that by a little
experimenting his business relations with Wingate were likely to
prove profitable The broker had made it clear that he intended to be
perfectly straight with him He had employed Cowperwoods two brothers
at very moderate salariesone to take care of the books and look after
the office and the other to act on change with him for their seats in
that organization had never been sold And also by considerable effort
he had succeeded in securing Cowperwood Sr a place as a clerk in a
bank For the latter since the day of his resignation from the Third
National had been in a deep sad quandary as to what further to do with
his life His sons disgrace The horror of his trial and incarceration
Since the day of Franks indictment and more so since his sentence and
commitment to the Eastern Penitentiary he was as one who walked in a
dream That trial That charge against Frank His own son a convict in
stripesand after he and Frank had walked so proudly in the front rank
of the successful and respected here Like so many others in his hour of
distress he had taken to reading the Bible looking into its pages for
something of that mind consolation that always from youth up although
rather casually in these latter years he had imagined was to be found
there The Psalms Isaiah the Book of Job Ecclesiastes And for
the most part because of the fraying nature of his present ills not
finding it

But day after day secreting himself in his rooma little hallbedroom
office in his newest home where to his wife he pretended that he
had some commercial matters wherewith he was still concernedand once
inside the door locked sitting and brooding on all that had befallen
himhis losses his good name Or after months of this and because of
the new position secured for him by Wingatea bookkeeping job in one
of the outlying banksslipping away early in the morning and returning
late at night his mind a gloomy epitome of all that had been or yet
might be

To see him bustling off from his new but very much reduced home at half
after seven in the morning in order to reach the small bank which was
some distance away and not accessible by streetcar line was one of
those pathetic sights which the fortunes of trade so frequently offer
He carried his lunch in a small box because it was inconvenient to
return home in the time allotted for this purpose and because his new
salary did not permit the extravagance of a purchased one It was his
one ambition now to eke out a respectable but unseen existence until he
should die which he hoped would not be long He was a pathetic
figure with his thin legs and body his gray hair and his snowwhite
sidewhiskers He was very lean and angular and when confronted by a
difficult problem a little uncertain or vague in his mind An old habit
which had grown on him in the years of his prosperity of putting his
hand to his mouth and of opening his eyes in an assumption of surprise
which had no basis in fact now grew upon him He really degenerated
although he did not know it into a mere automaton Life strews its
shores with such interesting and pathetic wrecks

One of the things that caused Cowperwood no little thought at this time
and especially in view of his present extreme indifference to her was
how he would bring up this matter of his indifference to his wife and
his desire to end their relationship Yet apart from the brutality of
the plain truth he saw no way As he could plainly see she was now
persisting in her pretense of devotion uncolored apparently by any
suspicion of what had happened Yet since his trial and conviction she
had been hearing from one source and another that he was still intimate
with Aileen and it was only her thought of his concurrent woes and the
fact that he might possibly be spared to a successful financial life
that now deterred her from speaking He was shut up in a cell she said
to herself and she was really very sorry for him but she did not love
him as she once had He was really too deserving of reproach for his
general unseemly conduct and no doubt this was what was intended as
well as being enforced by the Governing Power of the world

One can imagine how much such an attitude as this would appeal to
Cowperwood once he had detected it By a dozen little signs in spite
of the fact that she brought him delicacies and commiserated on his
fate he could see that she felt not only sad but reproachful and if
there was one thing that Cowperwood objected to at all times it was
the moral as well as the funereal air Contrasted with the cheerful
combative hopefulness and enthusiasm of Aileen the wearied uncertainty
of Mrs Cowperwood was to say the least a little tame Aileen after
her first burst of rage over his fate which really did not develop any
tears on her part was apparently convinced that he would get out and
be very successful again She talked success and his future all the time
because she believed in it Instinctively she seemed to realize that
prison walls could not make a prison for him Indeed on the first day
she left she handed Bonhag ten dollars and after thanking him in her
attractive voicewithout showing her face howeverfor his obvious
kindness to her bespoke his further favor for Cowperwooda very great
man as she described him which sealed that ambitious materialists
fate completely There was nothing the overseer would not do for the
young lady in the dark cloak She might have stayed in Cowperwoods cell
for a week if the visitinghours of the penitentiary had not made it
impossible

The day that Cowperwood decided to discuss with his wife the weariness
of his present married state and his desire to be free of it was some
four months after he had entered the prison By that time he had become
inured to his convict life The silence of his cell and the menial tasks
he was compelled to perform which had at first been so distressing
banal maddening in their pointless iteration had now become merely
commonplacedull but not painful Furthermore he had learned many of
the little resources of the solitary convict such as that of using his
lamp to warm up some delicacy which he had saved from a previous meal or
from some basket which had been sent him by his wife or Aileen He had
partially gotten rid of the sickening odor of his cell by persuading
Bonhag to bring him small packages of lime which he used with great
freedom Also he succeeded in defeating some of the more venturesome
rats with traps and with Bonhags permission after his cell door had
been properly locked at night and sealed with the outer wooden door he
would take his chair if it were not too cold out into the little back
yard of his cell and look at the sky where when the nights were clear
the stars were to be seen He had never taken any interest in astronomy
as a scientific study but now the Pleiades the belt of Orion the Big
Dipper and the North Star to which one of its lines pointed caught his
attention almost his fancy He wondered why the stars of the belt of
Orion came to assume the peculiar mathematical relation to each other
which they held as far as distance and arrangement were concerned
and whether that could possibly have any intellectual significance The
nebulous conglomeration of the suns in Pleiades suggested a soundless
depth of space and he thought of the earth floating like a little ball
in immeasurable reaches of ether His own life appeared very trivial
in view of these things and he found himself asking whether it was all
really of any significance or importance He shook these moods off with
ease however for the man was possessed of a sense of grandeur
largely in relation to himself and his affairs and his temperament was
essentially material and vital Something kept telling him that whatever
his present state he must yet grow to be a significant personage one
whose fame would be heralded the world overwho must try try try It
was not given all men to see far or to do brilliantly but to him it
was given and he must be what he was cut out to be There was no more
escaping the greatness that was inherent in him than there was for so
many others the littleness that was in them

Mrs Cowperwood came in that afternoon quite solemnly bearing several
changes of linen a pair of sheets some potted meat and a pie She was
not exactly doleful but Cowperwood thought that she was tending toward
it largely because of her brooding over his relationship to Aileen
which he knew that she knew Something in her manner decided him to
speak before she left and after asking her how the children were and
listening to her inquiries in regard to the things that he needed he
said to her sitting on his single chair while she sat on his bed

Lillian theres something Ive been wanting to talk with you about
for some time I should have done it before but its better late than
never I know that you know that there is something between Aileen
Butler and me and we might as well have it open and aboveboard Its
true I am very fond of her and she is very devoted to me and if ever I
get out of here I want to arrange it so that I can marry her That means
that you will have to give me a divorce if you will and I want to talk
to you about that now This cant be so very much of a surprise to you
because you must have seen this long while that our relationship hasnt
been all that it might have been and under the circumstances this cant
prove such a very great hardship to youI am sure He paused waiting
for Mrs Cowperwood at first said nothing

Her thought when he first broached this was that she ought to make
some demonstration of astonishment or wrath but when she looked into
his steady examining eyes so free from the illusion of or interest in
demonstrations of any kind she realized how useless it would be He was
so utterly matteroffact in what seemed to her quite private and secret
affairsvery shameless She had never been able to understand quite how
he could take the subtleties of life as he did anyhow Certain things
which she always fancied should be hushed up he spoke of with the
greatest nonchalance Her ears tingled sometimes at his frankness
in disposing of a social situation but she thought this must be
characteristic of notable men and so there was nothing to be said about
it Certain men did as they pleased society did not seem to be able to
deal with them in any way Perhaps God would latershe was not sure
Anyhow bad as he was direct as he was forceful as he was he was far
more interesting than most of the more conservative types in whom the
social virtues of polite speech and modest thoughts were seemingly
predominate

I know she said rather peacefully although with a touch of anger
and resentment in her voice Ive known all about it all this time I
expected you would say something like this to me some day Its a nice
reward for all my devotion to you but its just like you Frank When
you are set on something nothing can stop you It wasnt enough that
you were getting along so nicely and had two children whom you ought to
love but you had to take up with this Butler creature until her name
and yours are a byword throughout the city I know that she comes
to this prison I saw her out here one day as I was coming in and I
suppose every one else knows it by now She has no sense of decency and
she does not carethe wretched vain thingbut I would have thought
that you would be ashamed Frank to go on the way that you have when
you still have me and the children and your father and mother and when
you are certain to have such a hard fight to get yourself on your feet
as it is If she had any sense of decency she would not have anything to
do with youthe shameless thing

Cowperwood looked at his wife with unflinching eyes He read in her
remarks just what his observation had long since confirmedthat she was
sympathetically out of touch with him She was no longer so attractive
physically and intellectually she was not Aileens equal Also that
contact with those women who had deigned to grace his home in his
greatest hour of prosperity had proved to him conclusively she was
lacking in certain social graces Aileen was by no means so vastly
better still she was young and amenable and adaptable and could still
be improved Opportunity as he now chose to think might make Aileen
whereas for Lillianor at least as he now saw itit could do nothing

Ill tell you how it is Lillian he said Im not sure that you
are going to get what I mean exactly but you and I are not at all well
suited to each other any more

You didnt seem to think that three or four years ago interrupted his
wife bitterly

I married you when I was twentyone went on Cowperwood quite
brutally not paying any attention to her interruption and I was
really too young to know what I was doing I was a mere boy It doesnt
make so much difference about that I am not using that as an excuse
The point that I am trying to make is thisthat right or wrong
important or not important I have changed my mind since I dont love
you any more and I dont feel that I want to keep up a relationship
however it may look to the public that is not satisfactory to me You
have one point of view about life and I have another You think your
point of view is the right one and there are thousands of people who
will agree with you but I dont think so We have never quarreled about
these things because I didnt think it was important to quarrel about
them I dont see under the circumstances that I am doing you any great
injustice when I ask you to let me go I dont intend to desert you or
the childrenyou will get a good livingincome from me as long as I
have the money to give it to youbut I want my personal freedom when
I come out of here if ever I do and I want you to let me have it The
money that you had and a great deal more once I am out of here you
will get back when I am on my feet again But not if you oppose meonly
if you help me I want and intend to help you alwaysbut in my way

He smoothed the leg of his prison trousers in a thoughtful way and
plucked at the sleeve of his coat Just now he looked very much like
a highly intelligent workman as he sat here rather than like the
important personage that he was Mrs Cowperwood was very resentful

Thats a nice way to talk to me and a nice way to treat me she
exclaimed dramatically rising and walking the short spacesome two
stepsthat lay between the wall and the bed I might have known that
you were too young to know your own mind when you married me Money
of course thats all you think of and your own gratification I dont
believe you have any sense of justice in you I dont believe you ever
had You only think of yourself Frank I never saw such a man as you
You have treated me like a dog all through this affair and all the
while you have been running with that little snip of an Irish thing
and telling her all about your affairs I suppose You let me go on
believing that you cared for me up to the last moment and then you
suddenly step up and tell me that you want a divorce Ill not do it
Ill not give you a divorce and you neednt think it

Cowperwood listened in silence His position in so far as this marital
tangle was concerned as he saw was very advantageous He was a
convict constrained by the exigencies of his position to be out of
personal contact with his wife for a long period of time to come which
should naturally tend to school her to do without him When he came
out it would be very easy for her to get a divorce from a convict
particularly if she could allege misconduct with another woman which he
would not deny At the same time he hoped to keep Aileens name out of
it Mrs Cowperwood if she would could give any false name if he made
no contest Besides she was not a very strong person intellectually
speaking He could bend her to his will There was no need of saying
much more now the ice had been broken the situation had been put
before her and time should do the rest

Dont be dramatic Lillian he commented indifferently Im not such
a loss to you if you have enough to live on I dont think I want to
live in Philadelphia if ever I come out of here My idea now is to go
west and I think I want to go alone I shant get married right away
again even if you do give me a divorce I dont care to take anybody
along It would be better for the children if you would stay here and
divorce me The public would think better of them and you

Ill not do it declared Mrs Cowperwood emphatically Ill never
do it never so there You can say what you choose You owe it to me to
stick by me and the children after all Ive done for you and Ill not
do it You neednt ask me any more Ill not do it

Very well replied Cowperwood quietly getting up We neednt talk
about it any more now Your time is nearly up anyhow Twenty minutes
was supposed to be the regular allotment for visitors Perhaps youll
change your mind sometime

She gathered up her muff and the shawlstrap in which she had carried
her gifts and turned to go It had been her custom to kiss Cowperwood
in a makebelieve way up to this time but now she was too angry to make
this pretense And yet she was sorry toosorry for herself and she
thought for him

Frank she declared dramatically at the last moment I never saw
such a man as you I dont believe you have any heart Youre not worthy
of a good wife Youre worthy of just such a woman as youre getting
The idea Suddenly tears came to her eyes and she flounced scornfully
and yet sorrowfully out

Cowperwood stood there At least there would be no more useless kissing
between them he congratulated himself It was hard in a way but purely
from an emotional point of view He was not doing her any essential
injustice he reasonednot an economic onewhich was the important
thing She was angry today but she would get over it and in time
might come to see his point of view Who could tell At any rate he had
made it plain to her what he intended to do and that was something as he
saw it He reminded one of nothing so much as he stood there as of
a young chicken picking its way out of the shell of an old estate
Although he was in a cell of a penitentiary with nearly four years more
to serve yet obviously he felt within himself that the whole world
was still before him He could go west if he could not reestablish
himself in Philadelphia but he must stay here long enough to win the
approval of those who had known him formerlyto obtain as it were a
letter of credit which he could carry to other parts

Hard words break no bones he said to himself as his wife went out
A mans never done till hes done Ill show some of these people yet
Of Bonhag who came to close the cell door he asked whether it was
going to rain it looked so dark in the hall

Its sure to before night replied Bonhag who was always wondering
over Cowperwoods tangled affairs as he heard them retailed here and
there





Chapter LVII


The time that Cowperwood spent in the Eastern Penitentiary of
Pennsylvania was exactly thirteen months from the day of his entry
to his discharge The influences which brought about this result were
partly of his willing and partly not For one thing some six months
after his incarceration Edward Malia Butler died expired sitting in
his chair in his private office at his home The conduct of Aileen had
been a great strain on him From the time Cowperwood had been sentenced
and more particularly after the time he had cried on Aileens shoulder
in prison she had turned on her father in an almost brutal way Her
attitude unnatural for a child was quite explicable as that of a
tortured sweetheart Cowperwood had told her that he thought Butler was
using his influence to withhold a pardon for him even though one were
granted to Stener whose life in prison he had been following with
considerable interest and this had enraged her beyond measure She lost
no chance of being practically insulting to her father ignoring him on
every occasion refusing as often as possible to eat at the same table
and when she did sitting next her mother in the place of Norah with
whom she managed to exchange She refused to sing or play any more
when he was present and persistently ignored the large number of young
political aspirants who came to the house and whose presence in a way
had been encouraged for her benefit Old Butler realized of course
what it was all about He said nothing He could not placate her

Her mother and brothers did not understand it at all at first Mrs
Butler never understood But not long after Cowperwoods incarceration
Callum and Owen became aware of what the trouble was Once when Owen
was coming away from a reception at one of the houses where his growing
financial importance made him welcome he heard one of two men whom he
knew casually say to the other as they stood at the door adjusting
their coats You saw where this fellow Cowperwood got four years
didnt you

Yes replied the other A clever devil thatwasnt he I knew that
girl he was in with tooyou know who I mean Miss Butlerwasnt that
her name

Owen was not sure that he had heard right He did not get the connection
until the other guest opening the door and stepping out remarked
Well old Butler got even apparently They say he sent him up

Owens brow clouded A hard contentious look came into his eyes He had
much of his fathers force What in the devil were they talking about
What Miss Butler did they have in mind Could this be Aileen or Norah
and how could Cowperwood come to be in with either of them It could
not possibly be Norah he reflected she was very much infatuated with a
young man whom he knew and was going to marry him Aileen had been
most friendly with the Cowperwoods and had often spoken well of the
financier Could it be she He could not believe it He thought once of
overtaking the two acquaintances and demanding to know what they meant
but when he came out on the step they were already some distance down
the street and in the opposite direction from that in which he wished to
go He decided to ask his father about this

On demand old Butler confessed at once but insisted that his son keep
silent about it

I wish Id have known said Owen grimly Id have shot the dirty
dog

Aisy aisy said Butler Yer own lifes worth more than his and yed
only be draggin the rest of yer family in the dirt with him Hes had
somethin to pay him for his dirty trick and hell have more Just ye
say nothin to no one Wait Hell be wantin to get out in a year or
two Say nothin to her aither Talkin wont help there Shell come
to her sinses when hes been away long enough Im thinkin Owen had
tried to be civil to his sister after that but since he was a stickler
for social perfection and advancement and so eager to get up in the
world himself he could not understand how she could possibly have done
any such thing He resented bitterly the stumblingblock she had put in
his path Now among other things his enemies would have this to throw
in his face if they wanted toand they would want to trust life for
that

Callum reached his knowledge of the matter in quite another manner but
at about the same time He was a member of an athletic club which had an
attractive building in the city and a fine country club where he went
occasionally to enjoy the swimmingpool and the Turkish bath connected
with it One of his friends approached him there in the billiardroom
one evening and said Say Butler you know Im a good friend of yours
dont you

Why certainly I know it replied Callum Whats the matter

Well you know said the young individual whose name was Richard
Pethick looking at Callum with a look of almost strained affection
I wouldnt come to you with any story that I thought would hurt your
feelings or that you oughtnt to know about but I do think you ought to
know about this He pulled at a high white collar which was choking his
neck

I know you wouldnt Pethick replied Callum very much interested
What is it Whats the point

Well I dont like to say anything replied Pethick but that fellow
Hibbs is saying things around here about your sister

Whats that exclaimed Callum straightening up in the most dynamic
way and bethinking him of the approved social procedure in all such
cases He should be very angry He should demand and exact proper
satisfaction in some form or otherby blows very likely if his honor
had been in any way impugned What is it he says about my sister What
right has he to mention her name here anyhow He doesnt know her

Pethick affected to be greatly concerned lest he cause trouble between
Callum and Hibbs He protested that he did not want to when in
reality he was dying to tell At last he came out with Why hes
circulated the yarn that your sister had something to do with this man
Cowperwood who was tried here recently and that thats why hes just
gone to prison

Whats that exclaimed Callum losing the makebelieve of the
unimportant and taking on the serious mien of some one who feels
desperately He says that does he Where is he I want to see if hell
say that to me

Some of the stern fighting ability of his father showed in his slender
rather refined young face

Now Callum insisted Pethick realizing the genuine storm he had
raised and being a little fearful of the result do be careful what
you say You mustnt have a row in here You know its against the
rules Besides he may be drunk Its just some foolish talk hes heard
Im sure Now for goodness sake dont get so excited Pethick
having evoked the storm was not a little nervous as to its results in
his own case He too as well as Callum himself as the talebearer
might now be involved

But Callum by now was not so easily restrained His face was quite
pale and he was moving toward the old English grillroom where Hibbs
happened to be consuming a brandyandsoda with a friend of about his
own age Callum entered and called him

Oh Hibbs he said

Hibbs hearing his voice and seeing him in the door arose and came
over He was an interesting youth of the collegiate type educated
at Princeton He had heard the rumor concerning Aileen from various
sourcesother members of the club for oneand had ventured to repeat
it in Pethicks presence

Whats that you were just saying about my sister asked Callum
grimly looking Hibbs in the eye

WhyI hesitated Hibbs who sensed trouble and was eager to
avoid it He was not exceptionally brave and looked it His hair was
strawcolored his eyes blue and his cheeks pink Whynothing in
particular Who said I was talking about her He looked at Pethick
whom he knew to be the talebearer and the latter exclaimed excitedly

Now dont you try to deny it Hibbs You know I heard you

Well what did I say asked Hibbs defiantly

Well what did you say interrupted Callum grimly transferring the
conversation to himself Thats just what I want to know

Why stammered Hibbs nervously I dont think Ive said anything
that anybody else hasnt said I just repeated that some one said that
your sister had been very friendly with Mr Cowperwood I didnt say any
more than I have heard other people say around here

Oh you didnt did you exclaimed Callum withdrawing his hand from
his pocket and slapping Hibbs in the face He repeated the blow with his
left hand fiercely Perhaps thatll teach you to keep my sisters name
out of your mouth you pup

Hibbss arms flew up He was not without pugilistic training and he
struck back vigorously striking Callum once in the chest and once in
the neck In an instant the two rooms of this suite were in an uproar
Tables and chairs were overturned by the energy of men attempting to get
to the scene of action The two combatants were quickly separated sides
were taken by the friends of each excited explanations attempted and
defied Callum was examining the knuckles of his left hand which were
cut from the blow he had delivered He maintained a gentlemanly calm
Hibbs very much flustered and excited insisted that he had been most
unreasonably used The idea of attacking him here And anyhow as he
maintained now Pethick had been both eavesdropping and lying about him
Incidentally the latter was protesting to others that he had done
the only thing which an honorable friend could do It was a nine days
wonder in the club and was only kept out of the newspapers by the most
strenuous efforts on the part of the friends of both parties Callum was
so outraged on discovering that there was some foundation for the rumor
at the club in a general rumor which prevailed that he tendered his
resignation and never went there again

I wish to heaven you hadnt struck that fellow counseled Owen when
the incident was related to him It will only make more talk She ought
to leave this place but she wont Shes struck on that fellow yet and
we cant tell Norah and mother We will never hear the last of this you
and Ibelieve me

Damn it she ought to be made to go exclaimed Callum

Well she wont replied Owen Father has tried making her and
she wont go Just let things stand Hes in the penitentiary now and
thats probably the end of him The public seem to think that father put
him there and thats something Maybe we can persuade her to go after
a while I wish to God we had never had sight of that fellow If ever he
comes out Ive a good notion to kill him

Oh I wouldnt do anything like that replied Callum Its useless
It would only stir things up afresh Hes done for anyhow

They planned to urge Norah to marry as soon as possible And as for
their feelings toward Aileen it was a very chilly atmosphere which
Mrs Butler contemplated from now on much to her confusion grief and
astonishment

In this divided world it was that Butler eventually found himself all
at sea as to what to think or what to do He had brooded so long now
for months and as yet had found no solution And finally in a form of
religious despair sitting at his desk in his business chair he had
collapseda weary and disconsolate man of seventy A lesion of the
left ventricle was the immediate physical cause although brooding over
Aileen was in part the mental one His death could not have been laid to
his grief over Aileen exactly for he was a very large manapoplectic
and with sclerotic veins and arteries For a great many years now he
had taken very little exercise and his digestion had been considerably
impaired thereby He was past seventy and his time had been reached
They found him there the next morning his hands folded in his lap his
head on his bosom quite cold

He was buried with honors out of St Timothys Church the funeral
attended by a large body of politicians and city officials who
discussed secretly among themselves whether his grief over his daughter
had anything to do with his end All his good deeds were remembered
of course and Mollenhauer and Simpson sent great floral emblems in
remembrance They were very sorry that he was gone for they had been
a cordial three But gone he was and that ended their interest in the
matter He left all of his property to his wife in one of the shortest
wills ever recorded locally

I give and bequeath to my beloved wife Norah all my property of
whatsoever kind to be disposed of as she may see fit

There was no misconstruing this A private paper drawn secretly for her
sometime before by Butler explained how the property should be disposed
of by her at her death It was Butlers real will masquerading as hers
and she would not have changed it for worlds but he wanted her left
in undisturbed possession of everything until she should die Aileens
originally assigned portion had never been changed According to her
fathers will which no power under the sun could have made Mrs Butler
alter she was left 250000 to be paid at Mrs Butlers death Neither
this fact nor any of the others contained in the paper were communicated
by Mrs Butler who retained it to be left as her will Aileen often
wondered but never sought to know what had been left her Nothing she
fanciedbut felt that she could not help this

Butlers death led at once to a great change in the temper of the
home After the funeral the family settled down to a seemingly peaceful
continuance of the old life but it was a matter of seeming merely The
situation stood with Callum and Owen manifesting a certain degree of
contempt for Aileen which she understanding reciprocated She was
very haughty Owen had plans of forcing her to leave after Butlers
death but he finally asked himself what was the use Mrs Butler who
did not want to leave the old home was very fond of Aileen so therein
lay a reason for letting her remain Besides any move to force her out
would have entailed an explanation to her mother which was not deemed
advisable Owen himself was interested in Caroline Mollenhauer whom he
hoped some day to marryas much for her prospective wealth as for any
other reason though he was quite fond of her In the January following
Butlers death which occurred in August Norah was married very
quietly and the following spring Callum embarked on a similar venture

In the meanwhile with Butlers death the control of the political
situation had shifted considerably A certain Tom Collins formerly one
of Butlers henchmen but latterly a power in the First Second Third
and Fourth Wards where he had numerous saloons and control of other
forms of vice appeared as a claimant for political recognition
Mollenhauer and Simpson had to consult him as he could make very
uncertain the disposition of some hundred and fifteen thousand votes
a large number of which were fraudulent but which fact did not modify
their deadly character on occasion Butlers sons disappeared as
possible political factors and were compelled to confine themselves to
the streetrailway and contracting business The pardon of Cowperwood
and Stener which Butler would have opposed because by keeping Stener
in he kept Cowperwood in became a much easier matter The scandal of
the treasury defalcation was gradually dying down the newspapers had
ceased to refer to it in any way Through Steger and Wingate a large
petition signed by all important financiers and brokers had been sent
to the Governor pointing out that Cowperwoods trial and conviction had
been most unfair and asking that he be pardoned There was no need
of any such effort so far as Stener was concerned whenever the time
seemed ripe the politicians were quite ready to say to the Governor
that he ought to let him go It was only because Butler had opposed
Cowperwoods release that they had hesitated It was really not possible
to let out the one and ignore the other and this petition coupled with
Butlers death cleared the way very nicely

Nevertheless nothing was done until the March following Butlers death
when both Stener and Cowperwood had been incarcerated thirteen monthsa
length of time which seemed quite sufficient to appease the anger of
the public at large In this period Stener had undergone a considerable
change physically and mentally In spite of the fact that a number of
the minor aldermen who had profited in various ways by his largess
called to see him occasionally and that he had been given as it
were almost the liberty of the place and that his family had not
been allowed to suffer nevertheless he realized that his political and
social days were over Somebody might now occasionally send him a basket
of fruit and assure him that he would not be compelled to suffer much
longer but when he did get out he knew that he had nothing to depend
on save his experience as an insurance agent and realestate dealer
That had been precarious enough in the days when he was trying to get
some small political foothold How would it be when he was known only as
the man who had looted the treasury of five hundred thousand dollars
and been sent to the penitentiary for five years Who would lend him
the money wherewith to get a little start even so much as four or five
thousand dollars The people who were calling to pay their respects now
and then and to assure him that he had been badly treated Never All
of them could honestly claim that they had not so much to spare If he
had good security to offeryes but if he had good security he would
not need to go to them at all The man who would have actually helped
him if he had only known was Frank A Cowperwood Stener could have
confessed his mistake as Cowperwood saw it and Cowperwood would have
given him the money gladly without any thought of return But by his
poor understanding of human nature Stener considered that Cowperwood
must be an enemy of his and he would not have had either the courage or
the business judgment to approach him

During his incarceration Cowperwood had been slowly accumulating a
little money through Wingate He had paid Steger considerable sums from
time to time until that worthy finally decided that it would not be
fair to take any more

If ever you get on your feet Frank he said you can remember me
if you want to but I dont think youll want to Its been nothing
but lose lose lose for you through me Ill undertake this matter
of getting that appeal to the Governor without any charge on my part
Anything I can do for you from now on is free gratis for nothing

Oh dont talk nonsense Harper replied Cowperwood I dont know of
anybody that could have done better with my case Certainly there isnt
anybody that I would have trusted as much I dont like lawyers you
know

Yeswell said Steger theyve got nothing on financiers so well
call it even And they shook hands

So when it was finally decided to pardon Stener which was in the early
part of March 1873Cowperwoods pardon was necessarily but gingerly
included A delegation consisting of Strobik Harmon and Winpenny
representing as it was intended to appear the unanimous wishes of the
council and the city administration and speaking for Mollenhauer and
Simpson who had given their consent visited the Governor at Harrisburg
and made the necessary formal representations which were intended to
impress the public At the same time through the agency of Steger
Davison and Walter Leigh the appeal in behalf of Cowperwood was made
The Governor who had had instructions beforehand from sources quite
superior to this committee was very solemn about the whole procedure
He would take the matter under advisement He would look into the
history of the crimes and the records of the two men He could make no
promiseshe would see But in ten days after allowing the petitions to
gather considerable dust in one of his pigeonholes and doing absolutely
nothing toward investigating anything he issued two separate pardons in
writing One as a matter of courtesy he gave into the hands of Messrs
Strobik Harmon and Winpenny to bear personally to Mr Stener as they
desired that he should The other on Stegers request he gave to him
The two committees which had called to receive them then departed and
the afternoon of that same day saw Strobik Harmon and Winpenny arrive
in one group and Steger Wingate and Walter Leigh in another at the
prison gate but at different hours





Chapter LVIII


This matter of the pardon of Cowperwood the exact time of it was kept
a secret from him though the fact that he was to be pardoned soon
or that he had a very excellent chance of being had not been
deniedrather had been made much of from time to time Wingate had kept
him accurately informed as to the progress being made as had Steger
but when it was actually ascertained from the Governors private
secretary that a certain day would see the pardon handed over to them
Steger Wingate and Walter Leigh had agreed between themselves that
they would say nothing taking Cowperwood by surprise They even went so
farthat is Steger and Wingate didas to indicate to Cowperwood that
there was some hitch to the proceedings and that he might not now get
out so soon Cowperwood was somewhat depressed but properly stoical
he assured himself that he could wait and that he would be all right
sometime He was rather surprised therefore one Friday afternoon to
see Wingate Steger and Leigh appear at his cell door accompanied by
Warden Desmas

The warden was quite pleased to think that Cowperwood should finally
be going outhe admired him so muchand decided to come along to
the cell to see how he would take his liberation On the way Desmas
commented on the fact that he had always been a model prisoner He kept
a little garden out there in that yard of his he confided to Walter
Leigh He had violets and pansies and geraniums out there and they did
very well too

Leigh smiled It was like Cowperwood to be industrious and tasteful
even in prison Such a man could not be conquered A very remarkable
man that he remarked to Desmas

Very replied the warden You can tell that by looking at him

The four looked in through the barred door where he was working without
being observed having come up quite silently

Hard at it Frank asked Steger

Cowperwood glanced over his shoulder and got up He had been thinking
as always these days of what he would do when he did get out

What is this he askeda political delegation He suspected
something on the instant All four smiled cheeringly and Bonhag
unlocked the door for the warden

Nothing very much Frank replied Stager gleefully only youre
a free man You can gather up your traps and come right along if you
wish

Cowperwood surveyed his friends with a level gaze He had not expected
this so soon after what had been told him He was not one to be very
much interested in the practical joke or the surprise but this pleased
himthe sudden realization that he was free Still he had anticipated
it so long that the charm of it had been discounted to a certain extent
He had been unhappy here and he had not The shame and humiliation of
it to begin with had been much Latterly as he had become inured to
it all the sense of narrowness and humiliation had worn off Only the
consciousness of incarceration and delay irked him Barring his intense
desire for certain thingssuccess and vindication principallyhe
found that he could live in his narrow cell and be fairly comfortable
He had long since become used to the limy smell used to defeat a
more sickening one and to the numerous rats which he quite regularly
trapped He had learned to take an interest in chaircaning having
become so proficient that he could seat twenty in a day if he chose
and in working in the little garden in spring summer and fall Every
evening he had studied the sky from his narrow yard which resulted
curiously in the gift in later years of a great reflecting telescope
to a famous university He had not looked upon himself as an ordinary
prisoner by any meanshad not felt himself to be sufficiently punished
if a real crime had been involved From Bonhag he had learned the
history of many criminals here incarcerated from murderers up and down
and many had been pointed out to him from time to time He had been
escorted into the general yard by Bonhag had seen the general food of
the place being prepared had heard of Steners modified life here and
so forth It had finally struck him that it was not so bad only that
the delay to an individual like himself was wasteful He could do so
much now if he were out and did not have to fight court proceedings
Courts and jails He shook his head when he thought of the waste
involved in them

Thats all right he said looking around him in an uncertain way
Im ready

He stepped out into the hall with scarcely a farewell glance and
to Bonhag who was grieving greatly over the loss of so profitable a
customer he said I wish you would see that some of these things are
sent over to my house Walter Youre welcome to the chair that clock
this mirror those picturesall of these things in fact except my
linen razors and so forth

The last little act of beneficence soothed Bonhags lacerated soul
a little They went out into the receiving overseers office where
Cowperwood laid aside his prison suit and the soft shirt with a
considerable sense of relief The clog shoes had long since been
replaced by a better pair of his own He put on the derby hat and gray
overcoat he had worn the year before on entering and expressed himself
as ready At the entrance of the prison he turned and looked backone
last glanceat the iron door leading into the garden

You dont regret leaving that do you Frank asked Steger curiously

I do not replied Cowperwood It wasnt that I was thinking of It
was just the appearance of it thats all

In another minute they were at the outer gate where Cowperwood shook
the warden finally by the hand Then entering a carriage outside the
large impressive Gothic entrance the gates were locked behind them
and they were driven away

Well theres an end of that Frank observed Steger gayly that
will never bother you any more

Yes replied Cowperwood Its worse to see it coming than going

It seems to me we ought to celebrate this occasion in some way
observed Walter Leigh It wont do just to take Frank home Why dont
we all go down to Greens Thats a good idea

Id rather not if you dont mind replied Cowperwood feelingly
Ill get together with you all later Just now Id like to go home and
change these clothes

He was thinking of Aileen and his children and his mother and father and
of his whole future Life was going to broaden out for him considerably
from now on he was sure of it He had learned so much about taking care
of himself in those thirteen months He was going to see Aileen and
find how she felt about things in general and then he was going to
resume some such duties as he had had in his own concern with Wingate 
Co He was going to secure a seat on change again through his friends
and to escape the effect of the prejudice of those who might not
care to do business with an exconvict he was going to act as general
outside man and floor man on charge for Wingate  Co His practical
control of that could not be publicly proved Now for some important
development in the marketsome slump or something He would show the
world whether he was a failure or not

They let him down in front of his wifes little cottage and he entered
briskly in the gathering gloom

On September 18 1873 at twelvefifteen of a brilliant autumn day in
the city of Philadelphia one of the most startling financial tragedies
that the world has ever seen had its commencement The banking house of
Jay Cooke  Co the foremost financial organization of America doing
business at Number 114 South Third Street in Philadelphia and with
branches in New York Washington and London closed its doors Those
who know anything about the financial crises of the United States know
well the significance of the panic which followed It is spoken of in
all histories as the panic of 1873 and the widespread ruin and disaster
which followed was practically unprecedented in American history

At this time Cowperwood once more a brokerostensibly a brokers
agentwas doing business in South Third Street and representing
Wingate  Co on change During the six months which had elapsed
since he had emerged from the Eastern Penitentiary he had been quietly
resuming financial if not social relations with those who had known
him before

Furthermore Wingate  Co were prospering and had been for some time
a fact which redounded to his credit with those who knew Ostensibly he
lived with his wife in a small house on North Twentyfirst Street In
reality he occupied a bachelor apartment on North Fifteenth Street to
which Aileen occasionally repaired The difference between himself and
his wife had now become a matter of common knowledge in the family and
although there were some faint efforts made to smooth the matter over
no good resulted The difficulties of the past two years had so inured
his parents to expect the untoward and exceptional that astonishing as
this was it did not shock them so much as it would have years before
They were too much frightened by life to quarrel with its weird
developments They could only hope and pray for the best

The Butler family on the other hand what there was of it had become
indifferent to Aileens conduct She was ignored by her brothers and
Norah who now knew all and her mother was so taken up with religious
devotions and brooding contemplation of her loss that she was not as
active in her observation of Aileens life as she might have been
Besides Cowperwood and his mistress were more circumspect in their
conduct than they had ever been before Their movements were more
carefully guarded though the result was the same Cowperwood was
thinking of the Westof reaching some slight local standing here in
Philadelphia and then with perhaps one hundred thousand dollars in
capital removing to the boundless prairies of which he had heard
so muchChicago Fargo Duluth Sioux City places then heralded in
Philadelphia and the East as coming centers of great lifeand taking
Aileen with him Although the problem of marriage with her was
insoluble unless Mrs Cowperwood should formally agree to give him upa
possibility which was not manifest at this time neither he nor Aileen
were deterred by that thought They were going to build a future
togetheror so they thought marriage or no marriage The only thing
which Cowperwood could see to do was to take Aileen away with him and
to trust to time and absence to modify his wifes point of view

This particular panic which was destined to mark a notable change
in Cowperwoods career was one of those peculiar things which
spring naturally out of the optimism of the American people and
the irrepressible progress of the country It was the result to
be accurate of the prestige and ambition of Jay Cooke whose early
training and subsequent success had all been acquired in Philadelphia
and who had since become the foremost financial figure of his day
It would be useless to attempt to trace here the rise of this man to
distinction it need only be said that by suggestions which he made and
methods which he devised the Union government in its darkest hours was
able to raise the money wherewith to continue the struggle against
the South After the Civil War this man who had built up a tremendous
banking business in Philadelphia with great branches in New York and
Washington was at a loss for some time for some significant thing to
do some constructive work which would be worthy of his genius The war
was over the only thing which remained was the finances of peace and
the greatest things in American financial enterprise were those related
to the construction of transcontinental railway lines The Union
Pacific authorized in 1860 was already building the Northern Pacific
and the Southern Pacific were already dreams in various pioneer minds
The great thing was to connect the Atlantic and the Pacific by steel
to bind up the territorially perfected and newly solidified Union or
to enter upon some vast project of mining of which gold and silver were
the most important Actually railwaybuilding was the most significant
of all and railroad stocks were far and away the most valuable and
important on every exchange in America Here in Philadelphia New York
Central Rock Island Wabash Central Pacific St Paul Hannibal  St
Joseph Union Pacific and Ohio  Mississippi were freely traded in
There were men who were getting rich and famous out of handling these
things and such towering figures as Cornelius Vanderbilt Jay Gould
Daniel Drew James Fish and others in the East and Fair Crocker W
R Hearst and Collis P Huntington in the West were already raising
their heads like vast mountains in connection with these enterprises
Among those who dreamed most ardently on this score was Jay Cooke who
without the wolfish cunning of a Gould or the practical knowledge of a
Vanderbilt was ambitious to thread the northern reaches of America with
a band of steel which should be a permanent memorial to his name

The project which fascinated him most was one that related to the
development of the territory then lying almost unexplored between the
extreme western shore of Lake Superior where Duluth now stands
and that portion of the Pacific Ocean into which the Columbia River
emptiesthe extreme northern onethird of the United States Here if a
railroad were built would spring up great cities and prosperous towns
There were it was suspected mines of various metals in the region of
the Rockies which this railroad would traverse and untold wealth to be
reaped from the fertile corn and wheat lands Products brought only so
far east as Duluth could then be shipped to the Atlantic via the Great
Lakes and the Erie Canal at a greatly reduced cost It was a vision of
empire not unlike the Panama Canal project of the same period and one
that bade fair apparently to be as useful to humanity It had aroused
the interest and enthusiasm of Cooke Because of the fact that the
government had made a grant of vast areas of land on either side of the
proposed track to the corporation that should seriously undertake it
and complete it within a reasonable number of years and because of the
opportunity it gave him of remaining a distinguished public figure he
had eventually shouldered the project It was open to many objections
and criticisms but the genius which had been sufficient to finance
the Civil War was considered sufficient to finance the Northern Pacific
Railroad Cooke undertook it with the idea of being able to put the
merits of the proposition before the people directnot through the
agency of any great financial corporationand of selling to the
butcher the baker and the candlestickmaker the stock or shares that
he wished to dispose of

It was a brilliant chance His genius had worked out the sale of great
government loans during the Civil War to the people direct in this
fashion Why not Northern Pacific certificates For several years he
conducted a pyrotechnic campaign surveying the territory in question
organizing great railwayconstruction corps building hundreds of miles
of track under most trying conditions and selling great blocks of his
stock on which interest of a certain percentage was guaranteed If it
had not been that he knew little of railroadbuilding personally and
that the project was so vast that it could not well be encompassed by
one man even so great a man it might have proved successful as under
subsequent management it did However hard times the war between
France and Germany which tied up European capital for the time being
and made it indifferent to American projects envy calumny a certain
percentage of mismanagement all conspired to wreck it On September 18
1873 at twelvefifteen noon Jay Cooke  Co failed for approximately
eight million dollars and the Northern Pacific for all that had been
invested in itsome fifty million dollars more

One can imagine what the result wasthe most important financier and
the most distinguished railway enterprise collapsing at one and the same
time A financial thunderclap in a clear sky said the Philadelphia
Press No one could have been more surprised said the Philadelphia
Inquirer if snow had fallen amid the sunshine of a summer noon The
public which by Cookes previous tremendous success had been lulled
into believing him invincible could not understand it It was beyond
belief Jay Cooke fail Impossible or anything connected with him
Nevertheless he had failed and the New York Stock Exchange after
witnessing a number of crashes immediately afterward closed for eight
days The Lake Shore Railroad failed to pay a callloan of one million
seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars and the Union Trust Company
allied to the Vanderbilt interests closed its doors after withstanding
a prolonged run The National Trust Company of New York had eight
hundred thousand dollars of government securities in its vaults but not
a dollar could be borrowed upon them and it suspended Suspicion was
universal rumor affected every one

In Philadelphia when the news reached the stock exchange it came first
in the form of a brief despatch addressed to the stock board from the
New York Stock ExchangeRumor on street of failure of Jay Cooke  Co
Answer It was not believed and so not replied to Nothing was
thought of it The world of brokers paid scarcely any attention to
it Cowperwood who had followed the fortunes of Jay Cooke  Co with
considerable suspicion of its presidents brilliant theory of vending
his wares direct to the peoplewas perhaps the only one who had
suspicions He had once written a brilliant criticism to some inquirer
in which he had said that no enterprise of such magnitude as the
Northern Pacific had ever before been entirely dependent upon one house
or rather upon one man and that he did not like it I am not sure that
the lands through which the road runs are so unparalleled in climate
soil timber minerals etc as Mr Cooke and his friends would have
us believe Neither do I think that the road can at present or for many
years to come earn the interest which its great issues of stock call
for There is great danger and risk there So when the notice was
posted he looked at it wondering what the effect would be if by any
chance Jay Cooke  Co should fail

He was not long in wonder A second despatch posted on change read
New York September 18th Jay Cooke  Co have suspended

Cowperwood could not believe it He was beside himself with the thought
of a great opportunity In company with every other broker he hurried
into Third Street and up to Number 114 where the famous old banking
house was located in order to be sure Despite his natural dignity and
reserve he did not hesitate to run If this were true a great hour had
struck There would be widespread panic and disaster There would be a
terrific slump in prices of all stocks He must be in the thick of it
Wingate must be on hand and his two brothers He must tell them how to
sell and when and what to buy His great hour had come





Chapter LIX


The banking house of Jay Cooke  Co in spite of its tremendous
significance as a banking and promoting concern was a most
unpretentious affair four stories and a half in height of gray stone
and red brick It had never been deemed a handsome or comfortable
banking house Cowperwood had been there often Wharfrats as long as
the forearm of a man crept up the culverted channels of Dock Street
to run through the apartments at will Scores of clerks worked under
gasjets where light and air were not any too abundant keeping track
of the firms vast accounts It was next door to the Girard National
Bank where Cowperwoods friend Davison still flourished and where the
principal financial business of the street converged As Cowperwood ran
he met his brother Edward who was coming to the stock exchange with
some word for him from Wingate

Run and get Wingate and Joe he said Theres something big on this
afternoon Jay Cooke has failed

Edward waited for no other word but hurried off as directed

Cowperwood reached Cooke  Co among the earliest To his utter
astonishment the solid brownoak doors with which he was familiar
were shut and a notice posted on them which he quickly read ran

 September 18 1873
 To the Public

 We regret to be obliged to announce that owing to
 unexpected demands on us our firm has been obliged to
 suspend payment In a few days we will be able to present a
 statement to our creditors Until which time we must ask
 their patient consideration We believe our assets to be
 largely in excess of our liabilities

 Jay Cooke  Co

A magnificent gleam of triumph sprang into Cowperwoods eye In company
with many others he turned and ran back toward the exchange while a
reporter who had come for information knocked at the massive doors
of the banking house and was told by a porter who peered out of a
diamondshaped aperture that Jay Cooke had gone home for the day and
was not to be seen

Now thought Cowperwood to whom this panic spelled opportunity not
ruin Ill get my innings Ill go short of thisof everything

Before when the panic following the Chicago fire had occurred he had
been longhad been compelled to stay long of many things in order to
protect himself Today he had nothing to speak ofperhaps a paltry
seventyfive thousand dollars which he had managed to scrape together
Thank God he had only the reputation of Wingates old house to lose if
he lost which was nothing With it as a trading agency behind himwith
it as an excuse for his presence his right to buy and sellhe had
everything to gain Where many men were thinking of ruin he was
thinking of success He would have Wingate and his two brothers under
him to execute his orders exactly He could pick up a fourth and a fifth
man if necessary He would give them orders to selleverythingten
fifteen twenty thirty points off if necessary in order to trap the
unwary depress the market frighten the fearsome who would think he was
too daring and then he would buy buy buy below these figures as much
as possible in order to cover his sales and reap a profit

His instinct told him how widespread and enduring this panic would be
The Northern Pacific was a hundredmilliondollar venture It involved
the savings of hundreds of thousands of peoplesmall bankers
tradesmen preachers lawyers doctors widows institutions all over
the land and all resting on the faith and security of Jay Cooke Once
not unlike the Chicago fire map Cowperwood had seen a grand prospectus
and map of the location of the Northern Pacific landgrant which Cooke
had controlled showing a vast stretch or belt of territory extending
from DuluthThe Zenith City of the Unsalted Seas as Proctor Knott
speaking in the House of Representatives had sarcastically called
itthrough the Rockies and the headwaters of the Missouri to the
Pacific Ocean He had seen how Cooke had ostensibly managed to get
control of this government grant containing millions upon millions of
acres and extending fourteen hundred miles in length but it was only a
vision of empire There might be silver and gold and copper mines there
The land was usablewould some day be usable But what of it now It
would do to fire the imaginations of fools withnothing more It was
inaccessible and would remain so for years to come No doubt thousands
had subscribed to build this road but too thousands would now fail
if it had failed Now the crash had come The grief and the rage of the
public would be intense For days and days and weeks and months normal
confidence and courage would be gone This was his hour This was his
great moment Like a wolf prowling under glittering bitter stars in
the night he was looking down into the humble folds of simple men and
seeing what their ignorance and their unsophistication would cost them

He hurried back to the exchange the very same room in which only two
years before he had fought his losing fight and finding that his
partner and his brother had not yet come began to sell everything in
sight Pandemonium had broken loose Boys and men were fairly tearing in
from all sections with orders from panicstruck brokers to sell sell
sell and later with orders to buy the various tradingposts were
reeling swirling masses of brokers and their agents Outside in the
street in front of Jay Cooke  Co Clark  Co the Girard National
Bank and other institutions immense crowds were beginning to form
They were hurrying here to learn the trouble to withdraw their
deposits to protect their interests generally A policeman arrested a
boy for calling out the failure of Jay Cooke  Co but nevertheless the
news of the great disaster was spreading like wildfire

Among these panicstruck men Cowperwood was perfectly calm deadly cold
the same Cowperwood who had pegged solemnly at his ten chairs each day
in prison who had baited his traps for rats and worked in the little
garden allotted him in utter silence and loneliness Now he was vigorous
and energetic He had been just sufficiently about this exchange floor
once more to have made his personality impressive and distinguished
He forced his way into the center of swirling crowds of men already
shouting themselves hoarse offering whatever was being offered in
quantities which were astonishing and at prices which allured the few
who were anxious to make money out of the tumbling prices to buy
New York Central had been standing at 104 78 when the failure was
announced Rhode Island at 108 78 Western Union at 92 12 Wabash at
70 14 Panama at 117 38 Central Pacific at 99 58 St Paul at 51
Hannibal  St Joseph at 48 Northwestern at 63 Union Pacific at 26
34 Ohio and Mississippi at 38 34 Cowperwoods house had scarcely any
of the stocks on hand They were not carrying them for any customers
and yet he sold sold sold to whoever would take at prices which he
felt sure would inspire them

Five thousand of New York Central at ninetynine ninetyeight
ninetyseven ninetysix ninetyfive ninetyfour ninetythree
ninetytwo ninetyone ninety eightynine you might have heard him
call and when his sales were not sufficiently brisk he would turn to
something elseRock Island Panama Central Pacific Western Union
Northwestern Union Pacific He saw his brother and Wingate hurrying in
and stopped in his work long enough to instruct them Sell everything
you can he cautioned them quietly at fifteen points off if you have
tono lower than that nowand buy all you can below it Ed you see
if you cannot buy up some local streetrailways at fifteen off Joe you
stay near me and buy when I tell you

The secretary of the board appeared on his little platform

E W Clark  Company he announced at onethirty have just closed
their doors

Tighe  Company he called at onefortyfive announce that they are
compelled to suspend

The First National Bank of Philadelphia he called at two oclock
begs to state that it cannot at present meet its obligations

After each announcement always as in the past when the gong had
compelled silence the crowd broke into an ominous Aw aw aw

Tighe  Company thought Cowperwood for a single second when he
heard it Theres an end of him And then he returned to his task

When the time for closing came his coat torn his collar twisted
loose his necktie ripped his hat lost he emerged sane quiet
steadymannered

Well Ed he inquired meeting his brother howd you make out The
latter was equally torn scratched exhausted

Christ he replied tugging at his sleeves I never saw such a place
as this They almost tore my clothes off

Buy any local streetrailways

About five thousand shares

Wed better go down to Greens Frank observed referring to the lobby
of the principal hotel Were not through yet Therell be more trading
there

He led the way to find Wingate and his brother Joe and together they
were off figuring up some of the larger phases of their purchases and
sales as they went

And as he predicted the excitement did not end with the coming of the
night The crowd lingered in front of Jay Cooke  Cos on Third
Street and in front of other institutions waiting apparently for some
development which would be favorable to them For the initiated the
center of debate and agitation was Greens Hotel where on the evening
of the eighteenth the lobby and corridors were crowded with bankers
brokers and speculators The stock exchange had practically adjourned
to that hotel en masse What of the morrow Who would be the next to
fail From whence would money be forthcoming These were the topics from
each mind and upon each tongue From New York was coming momentarily
more news of disaster Over there banks and trust companies were falling
like trees in a hurricane Cowperwood in his perambulations seeing what
he could see and hearing what he could hear reaching understandings
which were against the rules of the exchange but which were
nevertheless in accord with what every other person was doing saw
about him men known to him as agents of Mollenhauer and Simpson and
congratulated himself that he would have something to collect from them
before the week was over He might not own a streetrailway but he
would have the means to He learned from hearsay and information which
had been received from New York and elsewhere that things were as bad
as they could be and that there was no hope for those who expected a
speedy return of normal conditions No thought of retiring for the night
entered until the last man was gone It was then practically morning

The next day was Friday and suggested many ominous things Would it be
another Black Friday Cowperwood was at his office before the street
was fairly awake He figured out his program for the day to a nicety
feeling strangely different from the way he had felt two years before
when the conditions were not dissimilar Yesterday in spite of the
sudden onslaught he had made one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
and he expected to make as much if not more today There was no
telling what he could make he thought if he could only keep his small
organization in perfect trim and get his assistants to follow his orders
exactly Ruin for others began early with the suspension of Fisk 
Hatch Jay Cookes faithful lieutenants during the Civil War They had
calls upon them for one million five hundred thousand dollars in the
first fifteen minutes after opening the doors and at once closed them
again the failure being ascribed to Collis P Huntingtons Central
Pacific Railroad and the Chesapeake  Ohio There was a longcontinued
run on the Fidelity Trust Company News of these facts and of failures
in New York posted on change strengthened the cause Cowperwood was so
much interested in for he was selling as high as he could and buying
as low as he could on a constantly sinking scale By twelve oclock he
figured with his assistants that he had cleared one hundred thousand
dollars and by three oclock he had two hundred thousand dollars more
That afternoon between three and seven he spent adjusting his trades
and between seven and one in the morning without anything to eat in
gathering as much additional information as he could and laying his
plans for the future Saturday morning came and he repeated his
performance of the day before following it up with adjustments on
Sunday and heavy trading on Monday By Monday afternoon at three oclock
he figured that all losses and uncertainties to one side he was once
more a millionaire and that now his future lay clear and straight
before him

As he sat at his desk late that afternoon in his office looking out
into Third Street where a hurrying of brokers messengers and
anxious depositors still maintained he had the feeling that so far as
Philadelphia and the life here was concerned his day and its day with
him was over He did not care anything about the brokerage business here
any more or anywhere Failures such as this and disasters such as the
Chicago fire that had overtaken him two years before had cured him of
all love of the stock exchange and all feeling for Philadelphia He had
been very unhappy here in spite of all his previous happiness and
his experience as a convict had made him he could see quite plainly
unacceptable to the element with whom he had once hoped to associate
There was nothing else to do now that he had reestablished himself as
a Philadelphia business man and been pardoned for an offense which
he hoped to make people believe he had never committed but to leave
Philadelphia to seek a new world

If I get out of this safely he said to himself this is the end I
am going West and going into some other line of business He thought
of streetrailways land speculation some great manufacturing project
of some kind even mining on a legitimate basis

I have had my lesson he said to himself finally getting up and
preparing to leave I am as rich as I was and only a little older
They caught me once but they will not catch me again He talked to
Wingate about following up the campaign on the lines in which he had
started and he himself intended to follow it up with great energy but
all the while his mind was running with this one rich thought I am a
millionaire I am a free man I am only thirtysix and my future is all
before me

It was with this thought that he went to visit Aileen and to plan for
the future

It was only three months later that a train speeding through the
mountains of Pennsylvania and over the plains of Ohio and Indiana bore
to Chicago and the West the young financial aspirant who in spite of
youth and wealth and a notable vigor of body was a solemn conservative
speculator as to what his future might be The West as he had carefully
calculated before leaving held much He had studied the receipts of the
New York Clearing House recently and the disposition of bankbalances
and the shipment of gold and had seen that vast quantities of the
latter metal were going to Chicago He understood finance accurately
The meaning of gold shipments was clear Where money was going trade
wasa thriving developing life He wished to see clearly for himself
what this world had to offer

Two years later following the meteoric appearance of a young speculator
in Duluth and after Chicago had seen the tentative opening of a
grain and commission company labeled Frank A Cowperwood  Co which
ostensibly dealt in the great wheat crops of the West a quiet divorce
was granted Mrs Frank A Cowperwood in Philadelphia because apparently
she wished it Time had not seemingly dealt badly with her Her
financial affairs once so bad were now apparently all straightened
out and she occupied in West Philadelphia near one of her sisters a
new and interesting home which was fitted with all the comforts of an
excellent middleclass residence She was now quite religious once more
The two children Frank and Lillian were in private schools returning
evenings to their mother Wash Sims was once more the negro general
factotum Frequent visitors on Sundays were Mr and Mrs Henry
Worthington Cowperwood no longer distressed financially but subdued
and wearied the wind completely gone from their once muchfavored
sails Cowperwood senior had sufficient money wherewith to sustain
himself and that without slaving as a petty clerk but his social joy
in life was gone He was old disappointed sad He could feel that with
his quondam honor and financial glory he was the sameand he was not
His courage and his dreams were gone and he awaited death

Here too came Anna Adelaide Cowperwood on occasion a clerk in the
city water office who speculated much as to the strange vicissitudes of
life She had great interest in her brother who seemed destined by fate
to play a conspicuous part in the world but she could not understand
him Seeing that all those who were near to him in any way seemed to
rise or fall with his prosperity she did not understand how justice and
morals were arranged in this world There seemed to be certain general
principlesor people assumed there werebut apparently there were
exceptions Assuredly her brother abided by no known rule and yet
he seemed to be doing fairly well once more What did this mean Mrs
Cowperwood his former wife condemned his actions and yet accepted of
his prosperity as her due What were the ethics of that

Cowperwoods every action was known to Aileen Butler his present
whereabouts and prospects Not long after his wifes divorce and after
many trips to and from this new world in which he was now living these
two left Philadelphia together one afternoon in the winter Aileen
explained to her mother who was willing to go and live with Norah that
she had fallen in love with the former banker and wished to marry
him The old lady gathering only a garbled version of it at first
consented

Thus ended forever for Aileen this longcontinued relationship with this
older world Chicago was before hera much more distinguished career
Frank told her than ever they could have had in Philadelphia

Isnt it nice to be finally going she commented

It is advantageous anyhow he said




Concerning Mycteroperca Bonaci

There is a certain fish the scientific name of which is Mycteroperca
Bonaci its common name Black Grouper which is of considerable value
as an afterthought in this connection and which deserves to be better
known It is a healthy creature growing quite regularly to a weight of
two hundred and fifty pounds and lives a comfortable lengthy existence
because of its very remarkable ability to adapt itself to conditions
That very subtle thing which we call the creative power and which
we endow with the spirit of the beatitudes is supposed to build this
mortal life in such fashion that only honesty and virtue shall prevail
Witness then the significant manner in which it has fashioned
the black grouper One might go far afield and gather less forceful
indictmentsthe horrific spider spinning his trap for the unthinking
fly the lovely Drosera Sundew using its crimson calyx for a
smotheringpit in which to seal and devour the victim of its beauty
the rainbowcolored jellyfish that spreads its prismed tentacles like
streamers of great beauty only to sting and torture all that falls
within their radiant folds Man himself is busy digging the pit and
fashioning the snare but he will not believe it His feet are in the
trap of circumstance his eyes are on an illusion

Mycteroperca moving in its dark world of green waters is as fine
an illustration of the constructive genius of nature which is
not beatific as any which the mind of man may discover Its great
superiority lies in an almost unbelievable power of simulation which
relates solely to the pigmentation of its skin In electrical mechanics
we pride ourselves on our ability to make over one brilliant scene into
another in the twinkling of an eye and flash before the gaze of an
onlooker picture after picture which appear and disappear as we look
The directive control of Mycteroperca over its appearance is much more
significant You cannot look at it long without feeling that you are
witnessing something spectral and unnatural so brilliant is its power
to deceive From being black it can become instantly white from being
an earthcolored brown it can fade into a delightful watercolored
green Its markings change as the clouds of the sky One marvels at the
variety and subtlety of its power

Lying at the bottom of a bay it can simulate the mud by which it is
surrounded Hidden in the folds of glorious leaves it is of the same
markings Lurking in a flaw of light it is like the light itself
shining dimly in water Its power to elude or strike unseen is of the
greatest

What would you say was the intention of the overruling intelligent
constructive force which gives to Mycteroperca this ability To fit it
to be truthful To permit it to present an unvarying appearance which
all honest lifeseeking fish may know Or would you say that subtlety
chicanery trickery were here at work An implement of illusion one
might readily suspect it to be a living lie a creature whose business
it is to appear what it is not to simulate that with which it has
nothing in common to get its living by great subtlety the power of its
enemies to forefend against which is little The indictment is fair

Would you say in the face of this that a beatific beneficent
creative overruling power never wills that which is either tricky or
deceptive Or would you say that this material seeming in which we dwell
is itself an illusion If not whence then the Ten Commandments and the
illusion of justice Why were the Beatitudes dreamed of and how do they
avail




The Magic Crystal

If you had been a mystic or a soothsayer or a member of that mysterious
world which divines by incantations dreams the mystic bowl or the
crystal sphere you might have looked into their mysterious depths at
this time and foreseen a world of happenings which concerned these
two who were now apparently so fortunately placed In the fumes of
the witches pot or the depths of the radiant crystal might have been
revealed cities cities cities a world of mansions carriages jewels
beauty a vast metropolis outraged by the power of one man a great
state seething with indignation over a force it could not control vast
halls of priceless pictures a palace unrivaled for its magnificence a
whole world reading with wonder at times of a given name And sorrow
sorrow sorrow

The three witches that hailed Macbeth upon the blasted heath might in
turn have called to Cowperwood Hail to you Frank Cowperwood master
of a great railway system Hail to you Frank Cowperwood builder of
a priceless mansion Hail to you Frank Cowperwood patron of arts and
possessor of endless riches You shall be famed hereafter But like the
Weird Sisters they would have lied for in the glory was also the ashes
of Dead Sea fruitan understanding that could neither be inflamed by
desire nor satisfied by luxury a heart that was long since wearied by
experience a soul that was as bereft of illusion as a windless moon
And to Aileen as to Macduff they might have spoken a more pathetic
promise one that concerned hope and failure To have and not to have
All the seeming and yet the sorrow of not having Brilliant society
that shone in a mirage yet locked its doors love that eluded as a
willothewisp and died in the dark Hail to you Frank Cowperwood
master and no master prince of a world of dreams whose reality was
disillusion So might the witches have called the bowl have danced
with figures the fumes with vision and it would have been true What
wise man might not read from such a beginning such an end
