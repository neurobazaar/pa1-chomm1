 CHORUS O for a Muse of fire that would ascend
 The brightest heaven of invention
 A kingdom for a stage princes to act
 And monarchs to behold the swelling scene
 Then should the warlike Harry like himself
 Assume the port of Mars and at his heels
 Leashd in like hounds should famine sword and fire
 Crouch for employment But pardon gentles all
 The flat unraised spirits that hath dard
 On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
 So great an object Can this cockpit hold
 The vasty fields of France Or may we cram
 Within this wooden O the very casques
 That did affright the air at Agincourt
 O pardon since a crooked figure may
 Attest in little place a million
 And let us ciphers to this great accompt
 On your imaginary forces work
 Suppose within the girdle of these walls
 Are now confind two mighty monarchies
 Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
 The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder
 Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts
 Into a thousand parts divide one man
 And make imaginary puissance
 Think when we talk of horses that you see them
 Printing their proud hoofs i th receiving earth
 For tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings
 Carry them here and there jumping oer times
 Turning th accomplishment of many years
 Into an hourglass for the which supply
 Admit me Chorus to this history
 Who prologuelike your humble patience pray
 Gently to hear kindly to judge our play Exit

ACT I SCENE I
London An antechamber in the KINGS palace

Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and the BISHOP OF ELY

 CANTERBURY My lord Ill tell you that self bill is urgd
 Which in th eleventh year of the last kings reign
 Was like and had indeed against us passd
 But that the scambling and unquiet time
 Did push it out of farther question
 ELY But how my lord shall we resist it now
 CANTERBURY It must be thought on If it pass against us
 We lose the better half of our possession
 For all the temporal lands which men devout
 By testament have given to the church
 Would they strip from us being valud thus
 As much as would maintain to the Kings honour
 Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights
 Six thousand and two hundred good esquires
 And to relief of lazars and weak age
 Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil
 A hundred almshouses right well supplied
 And to the coffers of the King beside
 A thousand pounds by th year thus runs the bill
 ELY This would drink deep
 CANTERBURY T would drink the cup and all
 ELY But what prevention
 CANTERBURY The King is full of grace and fair regard
 ELY And a true lover of the holy Church
 CANTERBURY The courses of his youth promisd it not
 The breath no sooner left his fathers body
 But that his wildness mortified in him
 Seemd to die too yea at that very moment
 Consideration like an angel came
 And whippd th offending Adam out of him
 Leaving his body as a paradise
 Tenvelop and contain celestial spirits
 Never was such a sudden scholar made
 Never came reformation in a flood
 With such a heady currance scouring faults
 Nor never Hydraheaded wilfulnes
 So soon did lose his seat and all at once
 As in this king
 ELY We are blessed in the change
 CANTERBURY Hear him but reason in divinity
 And alladmiring with an inward wish
 You would desire the King were made a prelate
 Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs
 You would say it hath been all in all his study
 List his discourse of war and you shall hear
 A fearful battle rendred you in music
 Turn him to any cause of policy
 The Gordian knot of it he will unloose
 Familiar as his garter that when he speaks
 The air a charterd libertine is still
 And the mute wonder lurketh in mens ears
 To steal his sweet and honeyd sentences
 So that the art and practic part of life
 Must be the mistress to this theoric
 Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it
 Since his addiction was to courses vain
 His companies unletterd rude and shallow
 His hours filld up with riots banquets sports
 And never noted in him any study
 Any retirement any sequestration
 From open haunts and popularity
 ELY The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
 And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
 Neighbourd by fruit of baser quality
 And so the Prince obscurd his contemplation
 Under the veil of wildness which no doubt
 Grew like the summer grass fastest by night
 Unseen yet crescive in his faculty
 CANTERBURY It must be so for miracles are ceasd
 And therefore we must needs admit the means
 How things are perfected
 ELY But my good lord
 How now for mitigation of this bill
 Urgd by the Commons Doth his Majesty
 Incline to it or no
 CANTERBURY He seems indifferent
 Or rather swaying more upon our part
 Than cherishing th exhibiters against us
 For I have made an offer to his Majesty
 Upon our spiritual convocation
 And in regard of causes now in hand
 Which I have opend to his Grace at large
 As touching France to give a greater sum
 Than ever at one time the clergy yet
 Did to his predecessors part withal
 ELY How did this offer seem receivd my lord
 CANTERBURY With good acceptance of his Majesty
 Save that there was not time enough to hear
 As I perceivd his Grace would fain have done
 The severals and unhidden passages
 Of his true tides to some certain dukedoms
 And generally to the crown and seat of France
 Derivd from Edward his greatgrandfather
 ELY What was th impediment that broke this off
 CANTERBURY The French ambassador upon that instant
 Cravd audience and the hour I think is come
 To give him hearing is it four oclock
 ELY It is
 CANTERBURY Then go we in to know his embassy
 Which I could with a ready guess declare
 Before the Frenchman speak a word of it
 ELY Ill wait upon you and I long to hear it Exeunt




SCENE II
London The Presence Chamber in the KINGS palace

Enter the KING GLOUCESTER BEDFORD EXETER WARWICK
WESTMORELAND
and attendants

 KING HENRY Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury
 EXETER Not here in presence
 KING HENRY Send for him good uncle
 WESTMORELAND Shall we call in th ambassador my liege
 KING HENRY Not yet my cousin we would be resolvd
 Before we hear him of some things of weight
 That task our thoughts concerning us and France

 Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and
 the BISHOP OF ELY

 CANTERBURY God and his angels guard your sacred throne
 And make you long become it
 KING HENRY Sure we thank you
 My learned lord we pray you to proceed
 And justly and religiously unfold
 Why the law Salique that they have in France
 Or should or should not bar us in our claim
 And God forbid my dear and faithful lord
 That you should fashion wrest or bow your reading
 Or nicely charge your understanding soul
 With opening titles miscreate whose right
 Suits not in native colours with the truth
 For God doth know how many now in health
 Shall drop their blood in approbation
 Of what your reverence shall incite us to
 Therefore take heed how you impawn our person
 How you awake our sleeping sword of war
 We charge you in the name of God take heed
 For never two such kingdoms did contend
 Without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops
 Are every one a woe a sore complaint
 Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords
 That makes such waste in brief mortality
 Under this conjuration speak my lord
 For we will hear note and believe in heart
 That what you speak is in your conscience washd
 As pure as sin with baptism
 CANTERBURY Then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers
 That owe yourselves your lives and services
 To this imperial throne There is no bar
 To make against your Highness claim to France
 But this which they produce from Pharamond
 In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant
 No woman shall succeed in Salique land
 Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
 To be the realm of France and Pharamond
 The founder of this law and female bar
 Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
 That the land Salique is in Germany
 Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe
 Where Charles the Great having subdud the Saxons
 There left behind and settled certain French
 Who holding in disdain the German women
 For some dishonest manners of their life
 Establishd then this law to wit no female
 Should be inheritrix in Salique land
 Which Salique as I said twixt Elbe and Sala
 Is at this day in Germany calld Meisen
 Then doth it well appear the Salique law
 Was not devised for the realm of France
 Nor did the French possess the Salique land
 Until four hundred one and twenty years
 After defunction of King Pharamond
 Idly supposd the founder of this law
 Who died within the year of our redemption
 Four hundred twentysix and Charles the Great
 Subdud the Saxons and did seat the French
 Beyond the river Sala in the year
 Eight hundred five Besides their writers say
 King Pepin which deposed Childeric
 Did as heir general being descended
 Of Blithild which was daughter to King Clothair
 Make claim and title to the crown of France
 Hugh Capet also who usurpd the crown
 Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine sole heir male
 Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great
 To find his title with some shows of truth
 Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught
 Conveyd himself as th heir to th Lady Lingare
 Daughter to Charlemain who was the son
 To Lewis the Emperor and Lewis the son
 Of Charles the Great Also King Lewis the Tenth
 Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet
 Could not keep quiet in his conscience
 Wearing the crown of France till satisfied
 That fair Queen Isabel his grandmother
 Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare
 Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine
 By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
 Was reunited to the Crown of France
 So that as clear as is the summers sun
 King Pepins title and Hugh Capets claim
 King Lewis his satisfaction all appear
 To hold in right and tide of the female
 So do the kings of France unto this day
 Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
 To bar your Highness claiming from the female
 And rather choose to hide them in a net
 Than amply to imbar their crooked tides
 Usurpd from you and your progenitors
 KING HENRY May I with right and conscience make this claim
 CANTERBURY The sin upon my head dread sovereign
 For in the book of Numbers is it writ
 When the man dies let the inheritance
 Descend unto the daughter Gracious lord
 Stand for your own unwind your bloody flag
 Look back into your mighty ancestors
 Go my dread lord to your greatgrandsires tomb
 From whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit
 And your greatuncles Edward the Black Prince
 Who on the French ground playd a tragedy
 Making defeat on the fun power of France
 Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
 Stood smiling to behold his lions whelp
 Forage in blood of French nobility
 O noble English that could entertain
 With half their forces the full pride of France
 And let another half stand laughing by
 All out of work and cold for action
 ELY Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
 And with your puissant arm renew their feats
 You are their heir you sit upon their throne
 The blood and courage that renowned them
 Runs in your veins and my thricepuissant liege
 Is in the very Maymorn of his youth
 Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises
 EXETER Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
 Do all expect that you should rouse yourself
 As did the former lions of your blood
 WESTMORELAND They know your Grace hath cause and means and
might
 So hath your Highness never King of England
 Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects
 Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
 And lie paviliond in the fields of France
 CANTERBURY O let their bodies follow my dear liege
 With blood and sword and fire to win your right
 In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
 Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum
 As never did the clergy at one time
 Bring in to any of your ancestors
 KING HENRY We must not only arm t invade the French
 But lay down our proportions to defend
 Against the Scot who will make road upon us
 With all advantages
 CANTERBURY They of those marches gracious sovereign
 Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
 Our inland from the pilfering borderers
 KING HENRY We do not mean the coursing snatchers only
 But fear the main intendment of the Scot
 Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us
 For you shall read that my greatgrandfather
 Never went with his forces into France
 But that the Scot on his unfurnishd kingdom
 Came pouring like the tide into a breach
 With ample and brim fulness of his force
 Galling the gleaned land with hot assays
 Girdling with grievous siege castles and towns
 That England being empty of defence
 Hath shook and trembled at th ill neighbourhood
 CANTERBURY She hath been then more feard than harmd my
liege
 For hear her but exampled by herself
 When all her chivalry hath been in France
 And she a mourning widow of her nobles
 She hath herself not only well defended
 But taken and impounded as a stray
 The King of Scots whom she did send to France
 To fill King Edwards fame with prisoner kings
 And make her chronicle as rich with praise
 As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
 With sunken wreck and sumless treasuries
 WESTMORELAND But theres a saying very old and true

 If that you will France win
 Then with Scotland first begin

 For once the eagle England being in prey
 To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
 Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs
 Playing the mouse in absence of the cat
 To tear and havoc more than she can eat
 EXETER It follows then the cat must stay at home
 Yet that is but a crushd necessity
 Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
 And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves
 While that the armed hand doth fight abroad
 Th advised head defends itself at home
 For government though high and low and lower
 Put into parts doth keep in one consent
 Congreeing in a full and natural close
 Like music
 CANTERBURY Therefore doth heaven divide
 The state of man in divers functions
 Setting endeavour in continual motion
 To which is fixed as an aim or but
 Obedience for so work the honey bees
 Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
 The act of order to a peopled kingdom
 They have a king and officers of sorts
 Where some like magistrates correct at home
 Others like merchants venture trade abroad
 Others like soldiers armed in their stings
 Make boot upon the summers velvet buds
 Which pillage they with merry march bring home
 To the tentroyal of their emperor
 Who busied in his majesty surveys
 The singing masons building roofs of gold
 The civil citizens kneading up the honey
 The poor mechanic porters crowding in
 Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate
 The sadeyd justice with his surly hum
 Delivering oer to executors pale
 The lazy yawning drone I this infer
 That many things having full reference
 To one consent may work contrariously
 As many arrows loosed several ways
 Come to one mark as many ways meet in one town
 As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea
 As many lines close in the dials centre
 So many a thousand actions once afoot
 End in one purpose and be all well home
 Without defeat Therefore to France my liege
 Divide your happy England into four
 Whereof take you one quarter into France
 And you withal shall make all Gallia shake
 If we with thrice such powers left at home
 Cannot defend our own doors from the dog
 Let us be worried and our nation lose
 The name of hardiness and policy
 KING HENRY Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin
 Exeunt some attendants
 Now are we well resolvd and by Gods help
 And yours the noble sinews of our power
 France being ours well bend it to our awe
 Or break it all to pieces or there well sit
 Ruling in large and ample empery
 Oer France and all her almost kingly dukedoms
 Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn
 Tombless with no remembrance over them
 Either our history shall with full mouth
 Speak freely of our acts or else our grave
 Like Turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth
 Not worshippd with a waxen epitaph

 Enter AMBASSADORS of France

 Now are we well prepard to know the pleasure
 Of our fair cousin Dauphin for we hear
 Your greeting is from him not from the King
 AMBASSADOR Mayt please your Majesty to give us leave
 Freely to render what we have in charge
 Or shall we sparingly show you far of
 The Dauphins meaning and our embassy
 KING HENRY We are no tyrant but a Christian king
 Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
 As are our wretches fettred in our prisons
 Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
 Tell us the Dauphins mind
 AMBASSADOR Thus then in few
 Your Highness lately sending into France
 Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right
 Of your great predecessor King Edward the Third
 In answer of which claim the Prince our master
 Says that you savour too much of your youth
 And bids you be advisd theres nought in France
 That can be with a nimble galliard won
 You cannot revel into dukedoms there
 He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
 This tun of treasure and in lieu of this
 Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
 Hear no more of you This the Dauphin speaks
 KING HENRY What treasure uncle
 EXETER Tennisballs my liege
 KING HENRY We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us
 His present and your pains we thank you for
 When we have matchd our rackets to these balls
 We will in France by Gods grace play a set
 Shall strike his fathers crown into the hazard
 Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
 That all the courts of France will be disturbd
 With chaces And we understand him well
 How he comes oer us with our wilder days
 Not measuring what use we made of them
 We never valud this poor seat of England
 And therefore living hence did give ourself
 To barbarous licence as tis ever common
 That men are merriest when they are from home
 But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state
 Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
 When I do rouse me in my throne of France
 For that I have laid by my majesty
 And plodded like a man for workingdays
 But I will rise there with so full a glory
 That I will dazzle all the eyes of France
 Yea strike the Dauphin blind to look on us
 And tell the pleasant Prince this mock of his
 Hath turnd his balls to gunstones and his soul
 Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
 That shall fly with them for many a thousand widows
 Shall this his mock mock of their dear husbands
 Mock mothers from their sons mock castles down
 And some are yet ungotten and unborn
 That shall have cause to curse the Dauphins scorn
 But this lies all within the will of God
 To whom I do appeal and in whose name
 Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on
 To venge me as I may and to put forth
 My rightful hand in a wellhallowd cause
 So get you hence in peace and tell the Dauphin
 His jest will savour but of shallow wit
 When thousands weep more than did laugh at it
 Convey them with safe conduct Fare you well
 Exeunt AMBASSADORS
 EXETER This was a merry message
 KING HENRY We hope to make the sender blush at it
 Therefore my lords omit no happy hour
 That may give furthrance to our expedition
 For we have now no thought in us but France
 Save those to God that run before our business
 Therefore let our proportions for these wars
 Be soon collected and all things thought upon
 That may with reasonable swiftness ad
 More feathers to our wings for God before
 Well chide this Dauphin at his fathers door
 Therefore let every man now task his thought
 That this fair action may on foot be brought Exeunt

ACT II PROLOGUE

Flourish Enter CHORUS

 CHORUS Now all the youth of England are on fire
 And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies
 Now thrive the armourers and honours thought
 Reigns solely in the breast of every man
 They sell the pasture now to buy the horse
 Following the mirror of all Christian kings
 With winged heels as English Mercuries
 For now sits Expectation in the air
 And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
 With crowns imperial crowns and coronets
 Promisd to Harry and his followers
 The French advisd by good intelligence
 Of this most dreadful preparation
 Shake in their fear and with pale policy
 Seek to divert the English purposes
 O England model to thy inward greatness
 Like little body with a mighty heart
 What mightst thou do that honour would thee do
 Were all thy children kind and natural
 But see thy fault France hath in thee found out
 A nest of hollow bosoms which he fills
 With treacherous crowns and three corrupted men
 One Richard Earl of Cambridge and the second
 Henry Lord Scroop of Masham and the third
 Sir Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland
 Have for the gilt of France O guilt indeed
 Confirmd conspiracy with fearful France
 And by their hands this grace of kings must die
 If hell and treason hold their promises
 Ere he take ship for France and in Southampton
 Linger your patience on and well digest
 Th abuse of distance force a play
 The sum is paid the traitors are agreed
 The King is set from London and the scene
 Is now transported gentles to Southampton
 There is the playhouse now there must you sit
 And thence to France shall we convey you safe
 And bring you back charming the narrow seas
 To give you gentle pass for if we may
 Well not offend one stomach with our play
 But till the King come forth and not till then
 Unto Southampton do we shift our scene Exit

Enter EXETER BEDFORD and WESTMORELAND

 BEDFORD Fore God his Grace is bold to trust these traitors
 EXETER They shall be apprehended by and by
 WESTMORELAND How smooth and even they do bear themselves
 As if allegiance in their bosoms sat
 Crowned with faith and constant loyalty
 BEDFORD The King hath note of all that they intend
 By interception which they dream not of
 EXETER Nay but the man that was his bedfellow
 Whom he hath dulld and cloyd with gracious favours
 That he should for a foreign purse so sell
 His sovereigns life to death and treachery

 Trumpets sound Enter the KING SCROOP
 CAMBRIDGE GREY and attendants

 KING HENRY Now sits the wind fair and we will aboard
 My Lord of Cambridge and my kind Lord of Masham
 And you my gentle knight give me your thoughts
 Think you not that the powrs we bear with us
 Will cut their passage through the force of France
 Doing the execution and the act
 For which we have in head assembled them
 SCROOP No doubt my liege if each man do his best
 KING HENRY I doubt not that since we are well persuaded
 We carry not a heart with us from hence
 That grows not in a fair consent with ours
 Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
 Success and conquest to attend on us
 CAMBRIDGE Never was monarch better feard and lovd
 Than is your Majesty Theres not I think a subject
 That sits in heartgrief and uneasines
 Under the sweet shade of your government
 GREY True those that were your fathers enemies
 Have steepd their galls in honey and do serve you
 With hearts create of duty and of zeal
 KING HENRY We therefore have great cause of thankfulness
 And shall forget the office of our hand
 Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
 According to the weight and worthiness
 SCROOP So service shall with steeled sinews toil
 And labour shall refresh itself with hope
 To do your Grace incessant services
 KING HENRY We judge no less Uncle of Exeter
 Enlarge the man committed yesterday
 That raild against our person We consider
 It was excess of wine that set him on
 And on his more advice we pardon him
 SCROOP Thats mercy but too much security
 Let him be punishd sovereign lest example
 Breed by his sufferance more of such a kind
 KING HENRY O let us yet be merciful
 CAMBRIDGE So may your Highness and yet punish too
 GREY Sir
 You show great mercy if you give him life
 After the taste of much correction
 KING HENRY Alas your too much love and care of me
 Are heavy orisons gainst this poor wretch
 If little faults proceeding on distemper
 Shall not be winkd at how shall we stretch our eye
 When capital crimes chewd swallowd and digested
 Appear before us Well yet enlarge that man
 Though Cambridge Scroop and Grey in their dear care
 And tender preservation of our person
 Would have him punishd And now to our French causes
 Who are the late commissioners
 CAMBRIDGE I one my lord
 Your Highness bade me ask for it today
 SCROOP So did you me my liege
 GREY And I my royal sovereign
 KING HENRY Then Richard Earl of Cambridge there is yours
 There yours Lord Scroop of Masham and Sir Knight
 Grey of Northumberland this same is yours
 Read them and know I know your worthiness
 My Lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeter
 We will aboard tonight Why how now gentlemen
 What see you in those papers that you lose
 So much complexion Look ye how they change
 Their cheeks are paper Why what read you there
 That have so cowarded and chasd your blood
 Out of appearance
 CAMBRIDGE I do confess my fault
 And do submit me to your Highness mercy
 GREY SCROOP To which we all appeal
 KING HENRY The mercy that was quick in us but late
 By your own counsel is suppressd and killd
 You must not dare for shame to talk of mercy
 For your own reasons turn into your bosoms
 As dogs upon their masters worrying you
 See you my princes and my noble peers
 These English monsters My Lord of Cambridge here
 You know how apt our love was to accord
 To furnish him with an appertinents
 Belonging to his honour and this man
 Hath for a few light crowns lightly conspird
 And sworn unto the practices of France
 To kill us here in Hampton to the which
 This knight no less for bounty bound to us
 Than Cambridge is hath likewise sworn But O
 What shall I say to thee Lord Scroop thou cruel
 Ingrateful savage and inhuman creature
 Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels
 That knewst the very bottom of my soul
 That almost mightst have coind me into gold
 Wouldst thou have practisd on me for thy use
 May it be possible that foreign hire
 Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
 That might annoy my finger Tis so strange
 That though the truth of it stands off as gross
 As black and white my eye will scarcely see it
 Treason and murder ever kept together
 As two yokedevils sworn to eithers purpose
 Working so grossly in a natural cause
 That admiration did not whoop at them
 But thou gainst all proportion didst bring in
 Wonder to wait on treason and on murder
 And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
 That wrought upon thee so preposterously
 Hath got the voice in hell for excellence
 And other devils that suggest by treasons
 Do botch and bungle up damnation
 With patches colours and with forms being fetchd
 From glistring semblances of piety
 But he that temperd thee bade thee stand up
 Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
 Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor
 If that same demon that hath gulld thee thus
 Should with his lion gait walk the whole world
 He might return to vasty Tartar back
 And tell the legions I can never win
 A soul so easy as that Englishmans
 O how hast thou with jealousy infected
 The sweetness of affiance Show men dutiful
 Why so didst thou Seem they grave and learned
 Why so didst thou Come they of noble family
 Why so didst thou Seem they religious
 Why so didst thou Or are they spare in diet
 Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger
 Constant in spirit not swerving with the blood
 Garnishd and deckd in modest complement
 Not working with the eye without the ear
 And but in purged judgment trusting neither
 Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
 And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
 To mark the fullfraught man and best indued
 With some suspicion I will weep for thee
 For this revolt of thine methinks is like
 Another fall of man Their faults are open
 Arrest them to the answer of the law
 And God acquit them of their practices
 EXETER I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Richard
Earl
 of Cambridge
 I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Henry Lord
Scroop
 of Masham
 I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Thomas Grey
 knight of Northumberland
 SCROOP Our purposes God justly hath discoverd
 And I repent my fault more than my death
 Which I beseech your Highness to forgive
 Although my body pay the price of it
 CAMBRIDGE For me the gold of France did not seduce
 Although I did admit it as a motive
 The sooner to effect what I intended
 But God be thanked for prevention
 Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice
 Beseeching God and you to pardon me
 GREY Never did faithful subject more rejoice
 At the discovery of most dangerous treason
 Than I do at this hour joy oer myself
 Prevented from a damned enterprise
 My fault but not my body pardon sovereign
 KING HENRY God quit you in his mercy Hear your sentence
 You have conspird against our royal person
 Joind with an enemy proclaimd and from his coffers
 Receivd the golden earnest of our death
 Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter
 His princes and his peers to servitude
 His subjects to oppression and contempt
 And his whole kingdom into desolation
 Touching our person seek we no revenge
 But we our kingdoms safety must so tender
 Whose ruin you have sought that to her laws
 We do deliver you Get you therefore hence
 Poor miserable wretches to your death
 The taste whereof God of his mercy give
 You patience to endure and true repentance
 Of all your dear offences Bear them hence
 Exeunt CAMBRIDGE SCROOP and GREY guarded
 Now lords for France the enterprise whereof
 Shall be to you as us like glorious
 We doubt not of a fair and lucky war
 Since God so graciously hath brought to light
 This dangerous treason lurking in our way
 To hinder our beginnings we doubt not now
 But every rub is smoothed on our way
 Then forth dear countrymen let us deliver
 Our puissance into the hand of God
 Putting it straight in expedition
 Cheerly to sea the signs of war advance
 No king of England if not king of France

SCENE IV
France The KINGS palace

Flourish Enter the FRENCH KING the DAUPHIN the DUKES OF BERRI
and BRITAINE the CONSTABLE and others

 FRENCH KING Thus comes the English with full power upon us
 And more than carefully it us concerns
 To answer royally in our defences
 Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Britaine
 Of Brabant and of Orleans shall make forth
 And you Prince Dauphin with all swift dispatch
 To line and new repair our towns of war
 With men of courage and with means defendant
 For England his approaches makes as fierce
 As waters to the sucking of a gulf
 It fits us then to be as provident
 As fear may teach us out of late examples
 Left by the fatal and neglected English
 Upon our fields
 DAUPHIN My most redoubted father
 It is most meet we arm us gainst the foe
 For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom
 Though war nor no known quarrel were in question
 But that defences musters preparations
 Should be maintaind assembled and collected
 As were a war in expectation
 Therefore I say tis meet we all go forth
 To view the sick and feeble parts of France
 And let us do it with no show of fear
 No with no more than if we heard that England
 Were busied with a Whitsun morrisdance
 For my good liege she is so idly kingd
 Her sceptre so fantastically borne
 By a vain giddy shallow humorous youth
 That fear attends her not
 CONSTABLE O peace Prince Dauphin
 You are too much mistaken in this king
 Question your Grace the late ambassadors
 With what great state he heard their embassy
 How well supplied with noble counsellors
 How modest in exception and withal
 How terrible in constant resolution
 And you shall find his vanities forespent
 Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus
 Covering discretion with a coat of folly
 As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
 That shall first spring and be most delicate
 DAUPHIN Well tis not so my Lord High Constable
 But though we think it so it is no matter
 In cases of defence tis best to weigh
 The enemy more mighty than he seems
 So the proportions of defence are filld
 Which of a weak and niggardly projection
 Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
 A little cloth
 FRENCH KING Think we King Harry strong
 And Princes look you strongly arm to meet him
 The kindred of him hath been fleshd upon us
 And he is bred out of that bloody strain
 That haunted us in our familiar paths
 Witness our too much memorable shame
 When Cressy battle fatally was struck
 And all our princes capdvd by the hand
 Of that black name Edward Black Prince of Wales
 Whiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing
 Up in the air crownd with the golden sun
 Saw his heroical seed and smild to see him
 Mangle the work of nature and deface
 The patterns that by God and by French fathers
 Had twenty years been made This is a stern
 Of that victorious stock and let us fear
 The native mightiness and fate of him

 Enter a MESSENGER

 MESSENGER Ambassadors from Harry King of England
 Do crave admittance to your Majesty
 FRENCH KING Well give them present audience Go and bring
them
 Exeunt MESSENGER and certain LORDS
 You see this chase is hotly followed friends
 DAUPHIN Turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs
 Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
 Runs far before them Good my sovereign
 Take up the English short and let them know
 Of what a monarchy you are the head
 Selflove my liege is not so vile a sin
 As selfneglecting

 Reenter LORDS with EXETER and train

 FRENCH KING From our brother of England
 EXETER From him and thus he greets your Majesty
 He wills you in the name of God Almighty
 That you divest yourself and lay apart
 The borrowed glories that by gift of heaven
 By law of nature and of nations longs
 To him and to his heirs namely the crown
 And all widestretched honours that pertain
 By custom and the ordinance of times
 Unto the crown of France That you may know
 Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim
 Pickd from the wormholes of longvanishd days
 Nor from the dust of old oblivion rakd
 He sends you this most memorable line Gives a paper
 In every branch truly demonstrative
 Willing you overlook this pedigree
 And when you find him evenly derivd
 From his most famd of famous ancestors
 Edward the Third he bids you then resign
 Your crown and kingdom indirectly held
 From him the native and true challenger
 FRENCH KING Or else what follows
 EXETER Bloody constraint for if you hide the crown
 Even in your hearts there will he rake for it
 Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming
 In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove
 That if requiring fail he will compel
 And bids you in the bowels of the Lord
 Deliver up the crown and to take mercy
 On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
 Opens his vasty jaws and on your head
 Turning the widows tears the orphans cries
 The dead mens blood the privy maidens groans
 For husbands fathers and betrothed lovers
 That shall be swallowed in this controversy
 This is his claim his threatning and my message
 Unless the Dauphin be in presence here
 To whom expressly I bring greeting too
 FRENCH KING For us we will consider of this further
 Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent
 Back to our brother of England
 DAUPHIN For the Dauphin
 I stand here for him What to him from England
 EXETER Scorn and defiance slight regard contempt
 And anything that may not misbecome
 The mighty sender doth he prize you at
 Thus says my king an if your fathers Highness
 Do not in grant of all demands at large
 Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty
 Hell call you to so hot an answer of it
 That caves and womby vaultages of France
 Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
 In second accent of his ordinance
 DAUPHIN Say if my father render fair return
 It is against my will for I desire
 Nothing but odds with England To that end
 As matching to his youth and vanity
 I did present him with the Paris balls
 EXETER Hell make your Paris Louvre shake for it
 Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe
 And be assurd youll find a difference
 As we his subjects have in wonder found
 Between the promise of his greener days
 And these he masters now Now he weighs time
 Even to the utmost grain that you shall read
 In your own losses if he stay in France
 FRENCH KING Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full
 EXETER Dispatch us with all speed lest that our king
 Come here himself to question our delay
 For he is footed in this land already
 FRENCH KING You shall be soon dispatchd with fair conditions

 A night is but small breath and little pause
 To answer matters of this consequence Flourish Exeunt

ACT III PROLOGUE

Flourish Enter CHORUS

 CHORUS Thus with imagind wing our swift scene flies
 In motion of no less celerity
 Than that of thought Suppose that you have seen
 The wellappointed King at Hampton pier
 Embark his royalty and his brave fleet
 With silken streamers the young Phorbus fanning
 Play with your fancies and in them behold
 Upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing
 Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
 To sounds confusd behold the threaden sails
 Borne with th invisible and creeping wind
 Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea
 Breasting the lofty surge O do but think
 You stand upon the rivage and behold
 A city on th inconstant billows dancing
 For so appears this fleet majestical
 Holding due course to Harfleur Follow follow
 Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy
 And leave your England as dead midnight still
 Guarded with grandsires babies and old women
 Either past or not arrivd to pith and puissance
 For who is he whose chin is but enrichd
 With one appearing hair that will not follow
 These culld and choicedrawn cavaliers to France
 Work work your thoughts and therein see a siege
 Behold the ordnance on their carriages
 With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur
 Suppose th ambassador from the French comes back
 Tells Harry that the King doth offer him
 Katherine his daughter and with her to dowry
 Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms
 The offer likes not and the nimble gunner
 With linstock now the devilish cannon touches
 Alarum and chambers go off
 And down goes an before them Still be kind
 And eke out our performance with your mind Exit

SCENE I
France Before Harfleur

Alarum Enter the KING EXETER BEDFORD GLOUCESTER
and soldiers with scalingladders

 KING Once more unto the breach dear friends once more
 Or close the wall up with our English dead
 In peace theres nothing so becomes a man
 As modest stillness and humility
 But when the blast of war blows in our ears
 Then imitate the action of the tiger
 Stiffen the sinews summon up the blood
 Disguise fair nature with hardfavourd rage
 Then lend the eye a terrible aspect
 Let it pry through the portage of the head
 Like the brass cannon let the brow oerwhelm it
 As fearfully as doth a galled rock
 Oerhang and jutty his confounded base
 Swilld with the wild and wasteful ocean
 Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide
 Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
 To his full height On on you noblest English
 Whose blood is fet from fathers of warproof
 Fathers that like so many Alexanders
 Have in these parts from morn till even fought
 And sheathd their swords for lack of argument
 Dishonour not your mothers now attest
 That those whom you calld fathers did beget you
 Be copy now to men of grosser blood
 And teach them how to war And you good yeomen
 Whose limbs were made in England show us here
 The mettle of your pasture let us swear
 That you are worth your breeding which I doubt not
 For there is none of you so mean and base
 That hath not noble lustre in your eyes
 I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips
 Straining upon the start The games afoot
 Follow your spirit and upon this charge
 Cry God for Harry England and Saint George
 Exeunt Alarum and chambers go off




SCENE II
Before Harfleur

Enter NYM BARDOLPH PISTOL and BOY

 BARDOLPH On on on on on to the breach to the breach
 NYM Pray thee Corporal stay the knocks are too hot and for
 mine own part I have not a case of lives The humour of it is
too
 hot that is the very plainsong of it
 PISTOL The plainsong is most just for humours do abound

 Knocks go and come Gods vassals drop and die
 And sword and shield
 In bloody field
 Doth win immortal fame

 BOY Would I were in an alehouse in London I wouid give all my
 fame for a pot of ale and safety
 PISTOL And I

 If wishes would prevail with me
 My purpose should not fail with me
 But thither would I hie

 BOY As duly but not as truly
 As bird doth sing on bough

 Enter FLUELLEN

 FLUELLEN Up to the breach you dogs
 Avaunt you cullions Driving them forward
 PISTOL Be merciful great duke to men of mould
 Abate thy rage abate thy manly rage
 Abate thy rage great duke
 Good bawcock bate thy rage Use lenity sweet chuck
 NYM These be good humours Your honour wins bad humours
 Exeunt all but BOY
 BOY As young as I am I have observd these three swashers I
am
 boy to them all three but all they three though they would
 serve me could not be man to me for indeed three such
antics do
 not amount to a man For Bardolph he is whiteliverd and
 redfacd by the means whereof a faces it out but fights
not
 For Pistol he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword by
the
 means whereof a breaks words and keeps whole weapons For
Nym
 he hath heard that men of few words are the best men and
 therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a should be
thought
 a coward but his few bad words are matchd with as few good
 deeds for a never broke any mans head but his own and
that
 was against a post when he was drunk They will steal
anything
 and call it purchase Bardolph stole a lutecase bore it
twelve
 leagues and sold it for three halfpence Nym and Bardolph
are
 sworn brothers in filching and in Calais they stole a
 fireshovel I knew by that piece of service the men would
carry
 coals They would have me as familiar with mens pockets as
their
 gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my
 manhood if I should take from anothers pocket to put into
mine
 for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs I must leave them and
 seek some better service their villainy goes against my weak
 stomach and therefore I must cast it up Exit

SCENE III
Before the gates of Harfleur

Enter the GOVERNOR and some citizens on the walls Enter the
KING
and all his train before the gates

 KING HENRY How yet resolves the Governor of the town
 This is the latest parle we will admit
 Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves
 Or like to men proud of destruction
 Defy us to our worst for as I am a soldier
 A name that in my thoughts becomes me best
 If I begin the battry once again
 I will not leave the halfachieved Harfleur
 Till in her ashes she lie buried
 The gates of mercy shall be all shut up
 And the fleshd soldier rough and hard of heart
 In liberty of bloody hand shall range
 With conscience wide as hell mowing like grass
 Your fresh fair virgins and your flowring infants
 What is it then to me if impious war
 Arrayd in flames like to the prince of fiends
 Do with his smirchd complexion all fell feats
 Enlinkd to waste and desolation
 What ist to me when you yourselves are cause
 If your pure maidens fall into the hand
 Of hot and forcing violation
 What rein can hold licentious wickednes
 When down the hill he holds his fierce career
 We may as bootless spend our vain command
 Upon th enraged soldiers in their spoil
 As send precepts to the Leviathan
 To come ashore Therefore you men of Harfleur
 Take pity of your town and of your people
 Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command
 Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
 Oerblows the filthy and contagious clouds
 Of heady murder spoil and villainy
 If not why in a moment look to see
 The blind and bloody with foul hand
 Defile the locks of your shrillshrieking daughters
 Your fathers taken by the silver beards
 And their most reverend heads dashd to the walls
 Your naked infants spitted upon pikes
 Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confusd
 Do break the clouds as did the wives of Jewry
 At Herods bloodyhunting slaughtermen
 What say you Will you yield and this avoid
 Or guilty in defence be thus destroyd
 GOVERNOR Our expectation hath this day an end
 The Dauphin whom of succours we entreated
 Returns us that his powers are yet not ready
 To raise so great a siege Therefore great King
 We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy
 Enter our gates dispose of us and ours
 For we no longer are defensible
 KING HENRY Open your gates Exit GOVERNOR Come uncle
Exeter
 Go you and enter Harfleur there remain
 And fortify it strongly gainst the French
 Use mercy to them all For us dear uncle
 The winter coming on and sickness growing
 Upon our soldiers we will retire to Calais
 Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest
 Tomorrow for the march are we addrest
 Flourish The KING and his train enter the town

SCENE V
The FRENCH KINGS palace

Enter the KING OF FRANCE the DAUPHIN DUKE OF BRITAINE
the CONSTABLE OF FRANCE and others

 FRENCH KING Tis certain he hath passd the river Somme
 CONSTABLE And if he be not fought withal my lord
 Let us not live in France let us quit an
 And give our vineyards to a barbarous people
 DAUPHIN O Dieu vivant Shall a few sprays of us
 The emptying of our fathers luxury
 Our scions put in wild and savage stock
 Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds
 And overlook their grafters
 BRITAINE Normans but bastard Normans Norman bastards
 Mort Dieu ma vie if they march along
 Unfought withal but I will sell my dukedom
 To buy a slobbry and a dirty farm
 In that nookshotten isle of Albion
 CONSTABLE Dieu de batailles where have they this mettle
 Is not their climate foggy raw and dull
 On whom as in despite the sun looks pale
 Killing their fruit with frowns Can sodden water
 A drench for surreind jades their barleybroth
 Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat
 And shall our quick blood spirited with wine
 Seem frosty O for honour of our land
 Let us not hang like roping icicles
 Upon our houses thatch whiles a more frosty people
 Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields
 Poor we call them in their native lords
 DAUPHIN By faith and honour
 Our madams mock at us and plainly say
 Our mettle is bred out and they will give
 Their bodies to the lust of English youth
 To newstore France with bastard warriors
 BRITAINE They bid us to the English dancingschools
 And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos
 Saying our grace is only in our heels
 And that we are most lofty runaways
 FRENCH KING Where is Montjoy the herald Speed him hence
 Let him greet England with our sharp defiance
 Up Princes and with spirit of honour edged
 More sharper than your swords hie to the field
 Charles Delabreth High Constable of France
 You Dukes of Orleans Bourbon and of Berri
 Alengon Brabant Bar and Burgundy
 Jaques Chatillon Rambures Vaudemont
 Beaumont Grandpre Roussi and Fauconbridge
 Foix Lestrake Bouciqualt and Charolois
 High dukes great princes barons lords and knights
 For your great seats now quit you of great shames
 Bar Harry England that sweeps through our land
 With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur
 Rush on his host as doth the melted snow
 Upon the valleys whose low vassal seat
 The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon
 Go down upon him you have power enough
 And in a captive chariot into Rouen
 Bring him our prisoner
 CONSTABLE This becomes the great
 Sorry am I his numbers are so few
 His soldiers sick and famishd in their march
 For I am sure when he shall see our army
 Hell drop his heart into the sink of fear
 And for achievement offer us his ransom
 FRENCH KING Therefore Lord Constable haste on Montjoy
 And let him say to England that we send
 To know what willing ransom he will give
 Prince Dauphin you shall stay with us in Rouen
 DAUPHIN Not so I do beseech your Majesty
 FRENCH KING Be patient for you shall remain with us
 Now forth Lord Constable and Princes all
 And quickly bring us word of Englands fall Exeunt




SCENE VI
The English camp in Picardy

Enter CAPTAINS English and Welsh GOWER and FLUELLEN

 GOWER How now Captain Fluellen Come you from the bridge
 FLUELLEN I assure you there is very excellent services
committed
 at the bridge
 GOWER Is the Duke of Exeter safe
 FLUELLEN The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon
and a
 man that I love and honour with my soul and my heart and my
 duty and my live and my living and my uttermost power He
is
 not God be praised and blessed any hurt in the world but
 keeps the bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline
There
 is an aunchient Lieutenant there at the bridge I think in my
 very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony and he
is
 man of no estimation in the world but I did see him do as
 gallant service
 GOWER What do you call him
 FLUELLEN He is calld Aunchient Pistol
 GOWER I know him not

 Enter PISTOL

 FLUELLEN Here is the man
 PISTOL Captain I thee beseech to do me favours
 The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well
 FLUELLEN Ay I praise God and I have merited some love at his
 hands
 PISTOL Bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart
 And of buxom valour hath by cruel fate
 And giddy Fortunes furious fickle wheel
 That goddess blind
 That stands upon the rolling restless stone
 FLUELLEN By your patience Aunchient Pistol Fortune is
painted
 blind with a muffler afore her eyes to signify to you that
 Fortune is blind and she is painted also with a wheel to
 signify to you which is the moral of it that she is
turning
 and inconstant and mutability and variation and her foot
look
 you is fixed upon a spherical stone which rolls and rolls
and
 rolls In good truth the poet makes a most excellent
description
 of it Fortune is an excellent moral
 PISTOL Fortune is Bardolphs foe and frowns on him
 For he hath stoln a pax and hanged must a be
 A damned death
 Let gallows gape for dog let man go free
 And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate
 But Exeter hath given the doom of death
 For pax of little price
 Therefore go speak the Duke will hear thy voice
 And let not Bardolphs vital thread be cut
 With edge of penny cord and vile reproach
 Speak Captain for his life and I will thee requite
 FLUELLEN Aunchient Pistol I do partly understand your
meaning
 PISTOL Why then rejoice therefore
 FLUELLEN Certainly Aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice
at
 for if look you he were my brother I would desire the Duke
to
 use his good pleasure and put him to execution for
discipline
 ought to be used
 PISTOL Die and be damnd and figo for thy friendship
 FLUELLEN It is well
 PISTOL The fig of Spain Exit

 FLUELLEN Very good
 GOWER Why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal I remember
him
 now a bawd a cutpurse
 FLUELLEN Ill assure you a uttred as prave words at the
pridge
 as you shall see in a summers day But it is very well what
he
 has spoke to me that is well I warrant you when time is
serve
 GOWER Why tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then goes
to
 the wars to grace himself at his return into London under
the
 form of a soldier And such fellows are perfect in the great
 commanders names and they will learn you by rote where
services
 were done at such and such a sconce at such a breach at
such a
 convoy who came off bravely who was shot who disgracd
what
 terms the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in the
 phrase of war which they trick up with newtuned oaths and
what
 a beard of the Generals cut and a horrid suit of the camp
will
 do among foaming bottles and alewashd wits is wonderful to
be
 thought on But you must learn to know such slanders of the
age
 or else you may be marvellously mistook
 FLUELLEN I tell you what Captain Gower I do perceive he is
not
 the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is if
I
 find a hole in his coat I will tell him my mind Drum
within
 Hark you the King is coming and I must speak with him from
the
 pridge

 Drum and colours Enter the KING and his poor soldiers
 and GLOUCESTER

 God pless your Majesty
 KING HENRY How now Fluellen Camst thou from the bridge
 FLUELLEN Ay so please your Majesty The Duke of Exeter has
very
 gallantly maintaind the pridge the French is gone off look
 you and there is gallant and most prave passages Marry th
 athversary was have possession of the pridge but he is
enforced
 to retire and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge I
can
 tell your Majesty the Duke is a prave man
 KING HENRY What men have you lost Fluellen
 FLUELLEN The perdition of th athversary hath been very great
 reasonable great marry for my part I think the Duke hath
lost
 never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing
a
 church one Bardolph if your Majesty know the man his face
is
 all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o fire and
his
 lips blows at his nose and it is like a coal of fire
sometimes
 plue and sometimes red but his nose is executed and his
fires
 out
 KING HENRY We would have all such offenders so cut off And we
 give express charge that in our marches through the country
there
 be nothing compelld from the villages nothing taken but
paid
 for none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful
 language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the
 gentler gamester is the soonest winner

 Tucket Enter MONTJOY

 MONTJOY You know me by my habit
 KING HENRY Well then I know thee what shall I know of thee
 MONTJOY My masters mind
 KING HENRY Unfold it
 MONTJOY Thus says my king Say thou to Harry of England
Though we
 seemd dead we did but sleep advantage is a better soldier
than
 rashness Tell him we could have rebukd him at Harfleur but

 that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
full
 ripe Now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial
 England shall repent his folly see his weakness and admire
our
 sufferance Bid him therefore consider of his ransom which
must
 proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have
lost
 the disgrace we have digested which in weight to reanswer
his
 pettiness would bow under For our losses his exchequer is
too
 poor for th effusion of our blood the muster of his
kingdom
 too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person
kneeling
 at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction To this
add
 defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his
 followers whose condemnation is pronouncd So far my king
and
 master so much my office
 KING HENRY What is thy name I know thy quality
 MONTJOY Montjoy
 KING HENRY Thou dost thy office fairly Turn thee back
 And tell thy king I do not seek him now
 But could be willing to march on to Calais
 Without impeachment for to say the sooth
 Though tis no wisdom to confess so much
 Unto an enemy of craft and vantage
 My people are with sickness much enfeebled
 My numbers lessend and those few I have
 Almost no better than so many French
 Who when they were in health I tell thee herald
 I thought upon one pair of English legs
 Did march three Frenchmen Yet forgive me God
 That I do brag thus this your air of France
 Hath blown that vice in me I must repent
 Go therefore tell thy master here I am
 My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk
 My army but a weak and sickly guard
 Yet God before tell him we will come on
 Though France himself and such another neighbour
 Stand in our way Theres for thy labour Montjoy
 Go bid thy master well advise himself
 If we may pass we will if we be hindred
 We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
 Discolour and so Montjoy fare you well
 The sum of all our answer is but this
 We would not seek a battle as we are
 Nor as we are we say we will not shun it
 So tell your master
 MONTJOY I shall deliver so Thanks to your Highness Exit
 GLOUCESTER I hope they will not come upon us now
 KING HENRY We are in Gods hand brother not in theirs
 March to the bridge it now draws toward night
 Beyond the river well encamp ourselves
 And on tomorrow bid them march away Exeunt




SCENE VII
The French camp near Agincourt

Enter the CONSTABLE OF FRANCE the LORD RAMBURES the DUKE OF
ORLEANS
the DAUPHIN with others

 CONSTABLE Tut I have the best armour of the world
 Would it were day
 ORLEANS You have an excellent armour but let my horse have
his
 due
 CONSTABLE It is the best horse of Europe
 ORLEANS Will it never be morning
 DAUPHIN My Lord of Orleans and my Lord High Constable you
talk of
 horse and armour
 ORLEANS You are as well provided of both as any prince in the
 world
 DAUPHIN What a long night is this I will not change my horse
with
 any that treads but on four pasterns Ca ha he bounds from
the
 earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the
 Pegasus chez les narines de feu When I bestride him I soar
I
 am a hawk He trots the air the earth sings when he touches
it
 the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of

 Hermes
 ORLEANS Hes of the colour of the nutmeg
 DAUPHIN And of the heat of the ginger It is a beast for
Perseus
 he is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and
water
 never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his
 rider mounts him he is indeed a horse and all other jades
you
 may call beasts
 CONSTABLE Indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent
 horse
 DAUPHIN It is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the
 bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage
 ORLEANS No more cousin
 DAUPHIN Nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising
of
 the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on
my
 palfrey It is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands
into
 eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all tis
a
 subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereigns
 sovereign to ride on and for the world familiar to us and
 unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder
at
 him I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus
Wonder
 of nature
 ORLEANS I have heard a sonnet begin so to ones mistress
 DAUPHIN Then did they imitate that which I composd to my
courser
 for my horse is my mistress
 ORLEANS Your mistress bears well
 DAUPHIN Me well which is the prescript praise and perfection
of a
 good and particular mistress
 CONSTABLE Nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
 shook your back
 DAUPHIN So perhaps did yours
 CONSTABLE Mine was not bridled
 DAUPHIN O then belike she was old and gentle and you rode
like a
 kern of Ireland your French hose off and in your strait
 strossers
 CONSTABLE You have good judgment in horsemanship
 DAUPHIN Be warnd by me then they that ride so and ride not
 warily fall into foul bogs I had rather have my horse to my
 mistress
 CONSTABLE I had as lief have my mistress a jade
 DAUPHIN I tell thee Constable my mistress wears his own
hair
 CONSTABLE I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow
to
 my mistress
 DAUPHIN Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement et la
 truie lavee au bourbier Thou makst use of anything
 CONSTABLE Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress or any
such
 proverb so little kin to the purpose
 RAMBURES My Lord Constable the armour that I saw in your tent
 tonight are those stars or suns upon it
 CONSTABLE Stars my lord
 DAUPHIN Some of them will fall tomorrow I hope
 CONSTABLE And yet my sky shall not want
 DAUPHIN That may be for you bear a many superfluously and
twere
 more honour some were away
 CONSTABLE Evn as your horse bears your praises who would
trot as
 well were some of your brags dismounted
 DAUPHIN Would I were able to load him with his desert Will it
 never be day I will trot tomorrow a mile and my way shall
be
 paved with English faces
 CONSTABLE I will not say so for fear I should be facd out of
my
 way but I would it were morning for I would fain be about
the
 ears of the English
 RAMBURES Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners
 CONSTABLE You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have
them
 DAUPHIN Tis midnight Ill go arm myself Exit
 ORLEANS The Dauphin longs for morning
 RAMBURES He longs to eat the English
 CONSTABLE I think he will eat all he kills
 ORLEANS By the white hand of my lady hes a gallant prince
 CONSTABLE Swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath
 ORLEANS He is simply the most active gentleman of France
 CONSTABLE Doing is activity and he will still be doing
 ORLEANS He never did harm that I heard of
 CONSTABLE Nor will do none tomorrow he will keep that good
name
 still
 ORLEANS I know him to be valiant
 CONSTABLE I was told that by one that knows him better than
you
 ORLEANS Whats he
 CONSTABLE Marry he told me so himself and he said he card
not
 who knew it
 ORLEANS He needs not it is no hidden virtue in him
 CONSTABLE By my faith sir but it is never anybody saw it
but
 his lackey
 Tis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bate
 ORLEANS Illwind never said well
 CONSTABLE I will cap that proverb with There is flattery in
 friendship
 ORLEANS And I will take up that with Give the devil his due
 CONSTABLE Well placd There stands your friend for the devil
 have at the very eye of that proverb with A pox of the
devil
 ORLEANS You are the better at proverbs by how much A fools
bolt
 is soon shot
 CONSTABLE You have shot over
 ORLEANS Tis not the first time you were overshot

 Enter a MESSENGER

 MESSENGER My Lord High Constable the English lie within
fifteen
 hundred paces of your tents
 CONSTABLE Who hath measurd the ground
 MESSENGER The Lord Grandpre
 CONSTABLE A valiant and most expert gentleman Would it were
day
 Alas poor Harry of England he longs not for the dawning as
we
 do
 ORLEANS What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of
 England to mope with his fatbraind followers so far out of
his
 knowledge
 CONSTABLE If the English had any apprehension they would run
 away
 ORLEANS That they lack for if their heads had any
intellectual
 armour they could never wear such heavy headpieces
 RAMBURES That island of England breeds very valiant creatures
 their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage
 ORLEANS Foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a
Russian
 bear and have their heads crushd like rotten apples You
may as
 well say thats a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on
the
 lip of a lion
 CONSTABLE Just just and the men do sympathise with the
mastiffs
 in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with
their
 wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and
steel
 they will eat like wolves and fight like devils
 ORLEANS Ay but these English are shrewdly out of beef
 CONSTABLE Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs
to
 eat and none to fight Now is it time to arm Come shall we
 about it
 ORLEANS It is now two oclock but let me see by ten
 We shall have each a hundred Englishmen Exeunt

ACT IV PROLOGUE

Enter CHORUS

 CHORUS Now entertain conjecture of a time
 When creeping murmur and the poring dark
 Fills the wide vessel of the universe
 From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
 The hum of either army stilly sounds
 That the fixd sentinels almost receive
 The secret whispers of each others watch
 Fire answers fire and through their paly flames
 Each battle sees the others umberd face
 Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs
 Piercing the nights dull ear and from the tents
 The armourers accomplishing the knights
 With busy hammers closing rivets up
 Give dreadful note of preparation
 The country cocks do crow the clocks do ton
 And the third hour of drowsy morning name
 Proud of their numbers and secure in soul
 The confident and overlusty French
 Do the lowrated English play at dice
 And chide the cripple tardygaited night
 Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
 So tediously away The poor condemned English
 Like sacrifices by their watchful fires
 Sit patiently and inly ruminate
 The mornings danger and their gesture sad
 Investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats
 Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
 So many horrid ghosts O now who will behold
 The royal captain of this ruind band
 Walking from watch to watch from tent to tent
 Let him cry Praise and glory on his head
 For forth he goes and visits all his host
 Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
 And calls them brothers friends and countrymen
 Upon his royal face there is no note
 How dread an army hath enrounded him
 Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
 Unto the weary and allwatched night
 But freshly looks and overbears attaint
 With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty
 That every wretch pining and pale before
 Beholding him plucks comfort from his looks
 A largess universal like the sun
 His liberal eye doth give to every one
 Thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all
 Behold as may unworthiness define
 A little touch of Harry in the night
 And so our scene must to the battle fly
 Where O for pity we shall much disgrace
 With four or five most vile and ragged foils
 Right illdisposd in brawl ridiculous
 The name of Agincourt Yet sit and see
 Minding true things by what their mockries be Exit




SCENE I
France The English camp at Agincourt

Enter the KING BEDFORD and GLOUCESTER

 KING HENRY Gloucester tis true that we are in great danger
 The greater therefore should our courage be
 Good morrow brother Bedford God Almighty
 There is some soul of goodness in things evil
 Would men observingly distil it out
 For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers
 Which is both healthful and good husbandry
 Besides they are our outward consciences
 And preachers to us all admonishing
 That we should dress us fairly for our end
 Thus may we gather honey from the weed
 And make a moral of the devil himself

 Enter ERPINGHAM

 Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham
 A good soft pillow for that good white head
 Were better than a churlish turf of France
 ERPINGHAM Not so my liege this lodging likes me better
 Since I may say Now lie I like a king
 KING HENRY Tis good for men to love their present pains
 Upon example so the spirit is eased
 And when the mind is quickned out of doubt
 The organs though defunct and dead before
 Break up their drowsy grave and newly move
 With casted slough and fresh legerity
 Lend me thy cloak Sir Thomas Brothers both
 Commend me to the princes in our camp
 Do my good morrow to them and anon
 Desire them all to my pavilion
 GLOUCESTER We shall my liege
 ERPINGHAM Shall I attend your Grace
 KING HENRY No my good knight
 Go with my brothers to my lords of England
 I and my bosom must debate awhile
 And then I would no other company
 ERPINGHAM The Lord in heaven bless thee noble Harry
 Exeunt all but the KING
 KING HENRY Godamercy old heart thou speakst cheerfully

 PISTOL Art thou his friend
 KING HENRY And his kinsman too
 PISTOL The figo for thee then

 PISTOL My name is Pistol calld Exit
 KING HENRY It sorts well with your fierceness

 Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER

 GOWER Captain Fluellen
 FLUELLEN So in the name of Jesu Christ speak fewer It is
the
 greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and

 aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept if
you
 would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the
Great
 you shall find I warrant you that there is no tiddletaddle
nor
 pibblepabble in Pompeys camp I warrant you you shall find
the
 ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of
it
 and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be
otherwise
 GOWER Why the enemy is loud you hear him all night
 FLUELLEN If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating
 coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look

 an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb In your own
 conscience now
 GOWER I will speak lower
 FLUELLEN I pray you and beseech you that you will
 Exeunt GOWER and FLUELLEN
 KING HENRY Though it appear a little out of fashion
 There is much care and valour in this Welshman

 Enter three soldiers JOHN BATES ALEXANDER COURT
 and MICHAEL WILLIAMS

 COURT Brother John Bates is not that the morning which breaks
 yonder
 BATES I think it be but we have no great cause to desire the
 approach of day
 WILLIAMS We see yonder the beginning of the day but I think
we
 shall never see the end of it Who goes there
 KING HENRY A friend
 WILLIAMS Under what captain serve you
 KING HENRY Under Sir Thomas Erpingham
 WILLIAMS A good old commander and a most kind gentleman I
pray
 you what thinks he of our estate
 KING HENRY Even as men wreckd upon a sand that look to be
washd
 off the next tide
 BATES He hath not told his thought to the King
 KING HENRY No nor it is not meet he should For though I
speak it
 to you I think the King is but a man as I am the violet
smells
 to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth
to
 me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies
laid
 by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his
 affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they
stoop
 they stoop with the like wing Therefore when he sees reason
of
 fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same
relish
 as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with
any
 appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten
his
 army
 BATES He may show what outward courage he will but I believe
as
 cold a night as tis he could wish himself in Thames up to
the
 neck and so I would he were and I by him at all
adventures so
 we were quit here
 KING HENRY By my troth I will speak my conscience of the
King I
 think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is
 BATES Then I would he were here alone so should he be sure to
be
 ransomed and a many poor mens lives saved
 KING HENRY I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here
 alone howsoever you speak this to feel other mens minds
 methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the
Kings
 company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable
 WILLIAMS Thats more than we know
 BATES Ay or more than we should seek after for we know
enough if
 we know we are the Kings subjects If his cause be wrong
our
 obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us
 WILLIAMS But if the cause be not good the King himself hath a
 heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and
heads
 choppd off in a battle shall join together at the latter
day
 and cry all We died at such a place some swearing some
crying
 for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them
some
 upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left
I
 am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for
how
 can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their
 argument Now if these men do not die well it will be a
black
 matter for the King that led them to it who to disobey were
 against all proportion of subjection
 KING HENRY So if a son that is by his father sent about
 merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation
of
 his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his
father
 that sent him or if a servant under his masters command
 transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die
in
 many irreconcild iniquities you may call the business of
the
 master the author of the servants damnation But this is not
so
 the King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his

 soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his
servant
 for they purpose not their death when they purpose their
 services Besides there is no king be his cause never so
 spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it
out
 with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them
the
 guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of
beguiling
 virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the
wars
 their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of
peace
 with pillage and robbery Now if these men have defeated the
law
 and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men
they
 have no wings to fly from God war is His beadle war is His
 vengeance so that here men are punishd for beforebreach of
the
 Kings laws in now the Kings quarrel Where they feared the
 death they have borne life away and where they would be safe
 they perish Then if they die unprovided no more is the King
 guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those
 impieties for the which they are now visited Every subjects
 duty is the Kings but every subjects soul is his own
 Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick
man
 in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying
so
 death is to him advantage or not dying the time was
blessedly
 lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that
escapes
 it were not sin to think that making God so free an offer
He
 let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
 others how they should prepare
 WILLIAMS Tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon
his
 own head the King is not to answer for it
 BATES I do not desire he should answer for me and yet I
determine
 to fight lustily for him
 KING HENRY I myself heard the King say he would not be
ransomd
 WILLIAMS Ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when
our
 throats are cut he may be ransomd and we neer the wiser
 KING HENRY If I live to see it I will never trust his word
after
 WILLIAMS You pay him then Thats a perilous shot out of an
 eldergun that a poor and a private displeasure can do
against a
 monarch You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with
 fanning in his face with a peacocks feather Youll never
trust
 his word after Come tis a foolish saying
 KING HENRY Your reproof is something too round I should be
angry
 with you if the time were convenient
 WILLIAMS Let it be a quarrel between us if you live
 KING HENRY I embrace it
 WILLIAMS How shall I know thee again
 KING HENRY Give me any gage of thine and I will wear it in my
 bonnet then if ever thou darst acknowledge it I will make
it
 my quarrel
 WILLIAMS Heres my glove give me another of thine
 KING HENRY There
 WILLIAMS This will I also wear in my cap if ever thou come to
me
 and say after tomorrow This is my glove by this hand I
will
 take thee a box on the ear
 KING HENRY If ever I live to see it I will challenge it
 WILLIAMS Thou darst as well be hangd
 KING HENRY Well I will do it though I take thee in the
Kings
 company
 WILLIAMS Keep thy word Fare thee well
 BATES Be friends you English fools be friends we have
 French quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon
 KING HENRY Indeed the French may lay twenty French crowns to
one
 they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but
it
 is no English treason to cut French crowns and tomorrow the
 King himself will be a clipper
 Exeunt soldiers
 Upon the King Let us our lives our souls
 Our debts our careful wives
 Our children and our sins lay on the King
 We must bear all O hard condition
 Twinborn with greatness subject to the breath
 Of every fool whose sense no more can feel
 But his own wringing What infinite hearts ease
 Must kings neglect that private men enjoy
 And what have kings that privates have not too
 Save ceremony save general ceremony
 And what art thou thou idol Ceremony
 What kind of god art thou that sufferst more
 Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers
 What are thy rents What are thy comingsin
 O Ceremony show me but thy worth
 What is thy soul of adoration
 Art thou aught else but place degree and form
 Creating awe and fear in other men
 Wherein thou art less happy being feard
 Than they in fearing
 What drinkst thou oft instead of homage sweet
 But poisond flattery O be sick great greatness
 And bid thy ceremony give thee cure
 Thinks thou the fiery fever will go out
 With titles blown from adulation
 Will it give place to flexure and low bending
 Canst thou when thou commandst the beggars knee
 Command the health of it No thou proud dream
 That playst so subtly with a kings repose
 I am a king that find thee and I know
 Tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball
 The sword the mace the crown imperial
 The intertissued robe of gold and pearl
 The farced tide running fore the king
 The throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp
 That beats upon the high shore of this world
 No not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony
 Not all these laid in bed majestical
 Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave
 Who with a body filld and vacant mind
 Gets him to rest crammd with distressful bread
 Never sees horrid night the child of hell
 But like a lackey from the rise to set
 Sweats in the eye of Pheebus and all night
 Sleeps in Elysium next day after dawn
 Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse
 And follows so the everrunning year
 With profitable labour to his grave
 And but for ceremony such a wretch
 Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep
 Had the forehand and vantage of a king
 The slave a member of the countrys peace
 Enjoys it but in gross brain little wots
 What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace
 Whose hours the peasant best advantages

 Enter ERPINGHAM

 ERPINGHAM My lord your nobles jealous of your absence
 Seek through your camp to find you
 KING Good old knight
 Collect them all together at my tent
 Ill be before thee
 ERPINGHAM I shall dot my lord Exit
 KING O God of battles steel my soldiers hearts
 Possess them not with fear Take from them now
 The sense of reckning if th opposed numbers
 Pluck their hearts from them Not today O Lord
 O not today think not upon the fault
 My father made in compassing the crown
 I Richards body have interred new
 And on it have bestowed more contrite tears
 Than from it issued forced drops of blood
 Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay
 Who twice a day their witherd hands hold up
 Toward heaven to pardon blood and I have built
 Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests
 Sing still for Richards soul More will I do
 Though all that I can do is nothing worth
 Since that my penitence comes after all
 Imploring pardon

 Enter GLOUCESTER

 GLOUCESTER My liege

 DAUPHIN Mount them and make incision in their hides

 And dout them with superfluous courage ha
 RAMBURES What will you have them weep our horses blood
 How shall we then behold their natural tears

 Enter a MESSENGER

 MESSENGER The English are embattld you French peers
 CONSTABLE To horse you gallant Princes straight to horse
 Do but behold yon poor and starved band
 And your fair show shall suck away their souls
 Leaving them but the shales and husks of men
 There is not work enough for all our hands
 Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
 To give each naked curtleaxe a stain
 That our French gallants shall today draw out
 And sheathe for lack of sport Let us but blow on them
 The vapour of our valour will oerturn them
 Tis positive gainst all exceptions lords
 That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants
 Who in unnecessary action swarm
 About our squares of battle were enow
 To purge this field of such a hilding foe
 Though we upon this mountains basis by
 Took stand for idle speculation
 But that our honours must not Whats to say
 A very little little let us do
 And all is done Then let the trumpets sound
 The tucket sonance and the note to mount
 For our approach shall so much dare the field
 That England shall couch down in fear and yield

 Enter GRANDPRE

 GRANDPRE Why do you stay so long my lords of France
 Yond island carrions desperate of their bones
 Illfavouredly become the morning field
 Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose
 And our air shakes them passing scornfully
 Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggard host
 And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps
 The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks
 With torchstaves in their hand and their poor jades
 Lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips
 The gum downroping from their paledead eyes
 And in their pale dull mouths the gimmald bit
 Lies foul with chawd grass still and motionless
 And their executors the knavish crows
 Fly oer them all impatient for their hour
 Description cannot suit itself in words
 To demonstrate the life of such a battle
 In life so lifeless as it shows itself
 CONSTABLE They have said their prayers and they stay for
death
 DAUPHIN Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
 And give their fasting horses provender
 And after fight with them
 CONSTABLE I stay but for my guidon To the field
 I will the banner from a trumpet take
 And use it for my haste Come come away
 The sun is high and we outwear the day Exeunt

 WESTMORELAND Of fighting men they have full threescore
thousand
 EXETER Theres five to one besides they all are fresh
 SALISBURY Gods arm strike with us tis a fearful odds
 God bye you Princes all Ill to my charge
 If we no more meet till we meet in heaven
 Then joyfully my noble Lord of Bedford
 My dear Lord Gloucester and my good Lord Exeter
 And my kind kinsman warriors all adieu
 BEDFORD Farewell good Salisbury and good luck go with thee
 EXETER Farewell kind lord Fight valiantly today
 And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it
 For thou art framd of the firm truth of valour
 Exit SALISBURY
 BEDFORD He is as full of valour as of kindness
 Princely in both

 Enter the KING

 WESTMORELAND O that we now had here
 But one ten thousand of those men in England
 That do no work today
 KING Whats he that wishes so
 My cousin Westmoreland No my fair cousin
 If we are markd to die we are enow
 To do our country loss and if to live
 The fewer men the greater share of honour
 Gods will I pray thee wish not one man more
 By Jove I am not covetous for gold
 Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost
 It yearns me not if men my garments wear
 Such outward things dwell not in my desires
 But if it be a sin to covet honour
 I am the most offending soul alive
 No faith my coz wish not a man from England
 Gods peace I would not lose so great an honour
 As one man more methinks would share from me
 For the best hope I have O do not wish one more
 Rather proclaim it Westmoreland through my host
 That he which hath no stomach to this fight
 Let him depart his passport shall be made
 And crowns for convoy put into his purse
 We would not die in that mans company
 That fears his fellowship to die with us
 This day is calld the feast of Crispian
 He that outlives this day and comes safe home
 Will stand a tiptoe when this day is namd
 And rouse him at the name of Crispian
 He that shall live this day and see old age
 Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours
 And say Tomorrow is Saint Crispian
 Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars
 And say These wounds I had on Crispians day
 Old men forget yet all shall be forgot
 But hell remember with advantages
 What feats he did that day Then shall our names
 Familiar in his mouth as household words
 Harry the King Bedford and Exeter
 Warwick and Talbot Salisbury and Gloucester
 Be in their flowing cups freshly remembred
 This story shall the good man teach his son
 And Crispin Crispian shall neer go by
 From this day to the ending of the world
 But we in it shall be remembered
 We few we happy few we band of brothers
 For he today that sheds his blood with me
 Shall be my brother be he neer so vile
 This day shall gentle his condition
 And gentlemen in England nowabed
 Shall think themselves accursd they were not here
 And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
 That fought with us upon Saint Crispins day

 Reenter SALISBURY

 SALISBURY My sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed
 The French are bravely in their battles set
 And will with all expedience charge on us
 KING HENRY All things are ready if our minds be so
 WESTMORELAND Perish the man whose mind is backward now
 KING HENRY Thou dost not wish more help from England coz
 WESTMORELAND Gods will my liege would you and I alone
 Without more help could fight this royal battle
 KING HENRY Why now thou hast unwishd five thousand men
 Which likes me better than to wish us one
 You know your places God be with you all

 Tucket Enter MONTJOY

 MONTJOY Once more I come to know of thee King Harry
 If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound
 Before thy most assured overthrow
 For certainly thou art so near the gulf
 Thou needs must be englutted Besides in mercy
 The constable desires thee thou wilt mind
 Thy followers of repentance that their souls
 May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
 From off these fields where wretches their poor bodies
 Must lie and fester
 KING HENRY Who hath sent thee now
 MONTJOY The Constable of France
 KING HENRY I pray thee bear my former answer back
 Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones
 Good God why should they mock poor fellows thus
 The man that once did sell the lions skin
 While the beast livd was killd with hunting him
 A many of our bodies shall no doubt
 Find native graves upon the which I trust
 Shall witness live in brass of this days work
 And those that leave their valiant bones in France
 Dying like men though buried in your dunghills
 They shall be famd for there the sun shall greet them
 And draw their honours reeking up to heaven
 Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
 The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France
 Mark then abounding valour in our English
 That being dead like to the bullets grazing
 Break out into a second course of mischief
 Killing in relapse of mortality
 Let me speak proudly tell the Constable
 We are but warriors for the workingday
 Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirchd
 With rainy marching in the painful field
 Theres not a piece of feather in our host
 Good argument I hope we will not fly
 And time hath worn us into slovenry
 But by the mass our hearts are in the trim
 And my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night
 Theyll be in fresher robes or they will pluck
 The gay new coats oer the French soldiers heads
 And turn them out of service If they do this
 As if God please they shall my ransom then
 Will soon be levied Herald save thou thy labour
 Come thou no more for ransom gentle herald
 They shall have none I swear but these my joints
 Which if they have as I will leave em them
 Shall yield them little tell the Constable
 MONTJOY I shall King Harry And so fare thee well
 Thou never shalt hear herald any more Exit
 KING HENRY I fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom

 My soul shall thine keep company to heaven
 Tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast
 As in this glorious and wellfoughten field
 We kept together in our chivalry
 Upon these words I came and cheerd him up
 He smild me in the face raught me his hand
 And with a feeble grip says Dear my lord
 Commend my service to my sovereign
 So did he turn and over Suffolks neck
 He threw his wounded arm and kissd his lips
 And so espousd to death with blood he seald

 That we may wander oer this bloody field

 To sort our nobles from our common men

 Lie drownd and soakd in mercenary blood
 So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
 In blood of princes and their wounded steeds

 Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters
 Killing them twice O give us leave great King
 To view the field in safety and dispose
 Of their dead bodies

 CHORUS Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story
 That I may prompt them and of such as have
 I humbly pray them to admit th excuse
 Of time of numbers and due course of things
 Which cannot in their huge and proper life
 Be here presented Now we bear the King
 Toward Calais Grant him there There seen
 Heave him away upon your winged thoughts
 Athwart the sea Behold the English beach
 Pales in the flood with men with wives and boys
 Whose shouts and claps outvoice the deepmouthd sea
 Which like a mighty whiffler fore the King
 Seems to prepare his way So let him land
 And solemnly see him set on to London
 So swift a pace hath thought that even now
 You may imagine him upon Blackheath
 Where that his lords desire him to have borne
 His bruised helmet and his bended sword
 Before him through the city He forbids it
 Being free from vainness and selfglorious pride
 Giving full trophy signal and ostent
 Quite from himself to God But now behold
 In the quick forge and workinghouse of thought
 How London doth pour out her citizens
 The mayor and all his brethren in best sort
 Like to the senators of th antique Rome
 With the plebeians swarming at their heels
 Go forth and fetch their conquring Caesar in
 As by a lower but loving likelihood
 Were now the General of our gracious Empress
 As in good time he may from Ireland coming
 Bringing rebellion broached on his sword
 How many would the peaceful city quit
 To welcome him Much more and much more cause
 Did they this Harry Now in London place him
 As yet the lamentation of the French
 Invites the King of Englands stay at home
 The Emperors coming in behalf of France
 To order peace between them and omit
 All the occurrences whatever chancd
 Till Harrys backreturn again to France
 There must we bring him and myself have playd
 The interim by remembring you tis past
 Then brook abridgment and your eyes advance
 After your thoughts straight back again to France Exit

SCENE II
France The FRENCH KINGS palace

Enter at one door KING HENRY EXETER BEDFORD GLOUCESTER
WARWICK
WESTMORELAND and other LORDS at another the FRENCH KING QUEEN
ISABEL
the PRINCESS KATHERINE ALICE and other LADIES the DUKE OF
BURGUNDY
and his train

 KING HENRY Peace to this meeting wherefore we are met
 Unto our brother France and to our sister
 Health and fair time of day joy and good wishes
 To our most fair and princely cousin Katherine
 And as a branch and member of this royalty
 By whom this great assembly is contrivd
 We do salute you Duke of Burgundy
 And princes French and peers health to you all
 FRENCH KING Right joyous are we to behold your face
 Most worthy brother England fairly met
 So are you princes English every one
 QUEEN ISABEL So happy be the issue brother England
 Of this good day and of this gracious meeting
 As we are now glad to behold your eyes
 Your eyes which hitherto have home in them
 Against the French that met them in their bent
 The fatal balls of murdering basilisks
 The venom of such looks we fairly hope
 Have lost their quality and that this day
 Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love
 KING HENRY To cry amen to that thus we appear
 QUEEN ISABEL You English princes an I do salute you
 BURGUNDY My duty to you both on equal love
 Great Kings of France and England That I have labourd
 With all my wits my pains and strong endeavours
 To bring your most imperial Majesties
 Unto this bar and royal interview
 Your mightiness on both parts best can witness
 Since then my office hath so far prevaild
 That face to face and royal eye to eye
 You have congreeted let it not disgrace me
 If I demand before this royal view
 What rub or what impediment there is
 Why that the naked poor and mangled Peace
 Dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births
 Should not in this best garden of the world
 Our fertile France put up her lovely visage
 Alas she hath from France too long been chasd
 And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps
 Corrupting in it own fertility
 Her vine the merry cheerer of the heart
 Unpruned dies her hedges evenpleachd
 Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair
 Put forth disorderd twigs her fallow leas
 The darnel hemlock and rank fumitory
 Doth root upon while that the coulter rusts
 That should deracinate such savagery
 The even mead that erst brought sweetly forth
 The freckled cowslip burnet and green clover
 Wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank
 Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
 But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs
 Losing both beauty and utility
 And as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges
 Defective in their natures grow to wildness
 Even so our houses and ourselves and children
 Have lost or do not learn for want of time
 The sciences that should become our country
 But grow like savages as soldiers will
 That nothing do but meditate on blood
 To swearing and stern looks diffusd attire
 And everything that seems unnatural
 Which to reduce into our former favout
 You are assembled and my speech entreats
 That I may know the let why gentle Peace
 Should not expel these inconveniences
 And bless us with her former qualities
 KING HENRY If Duke of Burgundy you would the peace
 Whose want gives growth to th imperfections
 Which you have cited you must buy that peace
 With full accord to all our just demands
 Whose tenours and particular effects
 You have enscheduld briefly in your hands
 BURGUNDY The King hath heard them to the which as yet
 There is no answer made
 KING HENRY Well then the peace
 Which you before so urgd lies in his answer
 FRENCH KING I have but with a cursorary eye
 Oerglanced the articles pleaseth your Grace
 To appoint some of your council presently
 To sit with us once more with better heed
 To resurvey them we will suddenly
 Pass our accept and peremptory answer
 KING HENRY Brother we shall Go uncle Exeter
 And brother Clarence and you brother Gloucester
 Warwick and Huntington go with the King
 And take with you free power to ratify
 Augment or alter as your wisdoms best
 Shall see advantageable for our dignity
 Any thing in or out of our demands
 And well consign thereto Will you fair sister
 Go with the princes or stay here with us
 QUEEN ISABEL Our gracious brother I will go with them
 Haply a womans voice may do some good
 When articles too nicely urgd be stood on
 KING HENRY Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us
 She is our capital demand comprisd
 Within the forerank of our articles
 QUEEN ISABEL She hath good leave
 Exeunt all but the KING KATHERINE and ALICE
 KING HENRY Fair Katherine and most fair
 Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
 Such as will enter at a ladys ear
 And plead his lovesuit to her gentle heart
 KATHERINE Your Majesty shall mock me I cannot speak your
England
 KING HENRY O fair Katherine if you will love me soundly with
your
 French heart I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly
with
 your English tongue Do you like me Kate
 KATHERINE Pardonnezmoi I cannot tell vat is like me
 KING HENRY An angel is like you Kate and you are like an
angel
 KATHERINE Que ditil que je suis semblable a les anges
 ALICE Oui vraiment sauf votre grace ainsi ditil
 KING HENRY I said so dear Katherine and I must not blush to

 affirm it
 KATHERINE O bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de
 tromperies
 KING HENRY What says she fair one that the tongues of men
are
 full of deceits
 ALICE Oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits
dat is
 de Princess
 KING HENRY The Princess is the better Englishwoman I faith
 Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding I am glad thou
 canst speak no better English for if thou couldst thou
wouldst
 find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold
my
 farm to buy my crown I know no ways to mince it in love but
 directly to say I love you Then if you urge me farther
than
 to say Do you in faith I wear out my suit Give me your
 answer i faith do and so clap hands and a bargain How
say
 you lady
 KATHERINE Sauf votre honneur me understand well
 KING HENRY Marry if you would put me to verses or to dance
for
 your sake Kate why you undid me for the one I have neither
 words nor measure and for the other I have no strength in
 measure yet a reasonable measure in strength If I could win
a
 lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my
armour
 on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken I
 should quickly leap into wife Or if I might buffet for my
love
 or bound my horse for her favours I could lay on like a
butcher
 and sit like a jackanapes never off But before God
Kate I
 cannot look greenly nor gasp out my cloquence nor I have no
 cunning in protestation only downright oaths which I never
use
 till urgd nor never break for urging If thou canst love a
 fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth
sunburning
 that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees
there
 let thine eye be thy cook I speak to thee plain soldier If
thou
 canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that
I
 shall die is true but for thy love by the Lord no yet I
love
 thee too And while thou livst dear Kate take a fellow of
 plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee
right
 because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for
these
 fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into
 ladies favours they do always reason themselves out again
 What a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad A
good
 leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will
 turn white a curld pate will grow bald a fair face will
 wither a full eye will wax hollow But a good heart Kate
is
 the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon
for
 it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course
truly
 If thou would have such a one take me and take me take a
 soldier take a soldier take a king And what sayst thou
then
 to my love Speak my fair and fairly I pray thee
 KATHERINE Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France
 KING HENRY No it is not possible you should love the enemy of
 France Kate but in loving me you should love the friend of
 France for I love France so well that I will not part with a
 village of it I will have it all mine And Kate when
France is
 mine and I am yours then yours is France and you are mine
 KATHERINE I cannot tell vat is dat
 KING HENRY No Kate I will tell thee in French which I am
sure
 will hang upon my tongue like a newmarried wife about her
 husbands neck hardly to be shook off Je quand sur le
 possession de France et quand vous avez le possession de
moi
 let me see what then Saint Denis be my speed donc votre
est
 France et vous etes mienne It is as easy for me Kate to
 conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French I shall
 never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at me
 KATHERINE Sauf votre honneur le Francais que vous parlez il
est
 meilleur que lAnglais lequel je parle
 KING HENRY No faith ist not Kate but thy speaking of my
 tongue and I thine most truly falsely must needs be
granted to
 be much at one But Kate dost thou understand thus much
 English Canst thou love me
 KATHERINE I cannot tell
 KING HENRY Can any of your neighbours tell Kate Ill ask
them
 Come I know thou lovest me and at night when you come into
 your closet youll question this gentlewoman about me and I
 know Kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that
you
 love with your heart But good Kate mock me mercifully the
 rather gentle Princess because I love thee cruelly If ever
 thou beest mine Kate as I have a saving faith within me
tells
 me thou shalt I get thee with scambling and thou must
therefore
 needs prove a good soldierbreeder Shall not thou and I
between
 Saint Denis and Saint George compound a boy half French
half
 English that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by
the
 beard Shall we not What sayst thou my fair
flowerdeluce
 KATHERINE I do not know dat
 KING HENRY No tis hereafter to know but now to promise do
but
 now promise Kate you will endeavour for your French part of
 such a boy and for my English moiety take the word of a king
and
 a bachelor How answer you la plus belle Katherine du monde
mon
 tres cher et divin deesse
 KATHERINE Your Majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de
 most sage damoiselle dat is en France
 KING HENRY Now fie upon my false French By mine honour in
true
 English I love thee Kate by which honour I dare not swear
thou
 lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost
 notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage
Now
 beshrew my fathers ambition He was thinking of civil wars
when
 he got me therefore was I created with a stubborn outside
with
 an aspect of iron that when I come to woo ladies I fright
them
 But in faith Kate the elder I wax the better I shall
appear
 my comfort is that old age that in layerup of beauty can
do
 no more spoil upon my face thou hast me if thou hast me at
the
 worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and
 better And therefore tell me most fair Katherine will you
have
 me Put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your
 heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and
say
 Harry of England I am thine Which word thou shalt no
sooner
 bless mine ear withal but I will tell thee aloud England is
 thine Ireland is thine France is thine and Henry
Plantagenet
 is thine who though I speak it before his face if he be
not
 fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of
good
 fellows Come your answer in broken music for thy voice is
 music and thy English broken therefore Queen of all
Katherine
 break thy mind to me in broken English wilt thou have me
 KATHERINE Dat is as it shall please de roi mon pere
 KING HENRY Nay it will please him well Kate it shall please
 him Kate
 KATHERINE Den it sall also content me
 KING HENRY Upon that I kiss your hand and I can you my queen
 KATHERINE Laissez mon seigneur laissez laissez Ma foi je
ne
 veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant la
main
 dune notre seigneur indigne serviteur excusezmoi je
vous

 KING HENRY Then I will kiss your lips Kate
 KATHERINE Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant

 noces il nest pas la coutume de France
 KING HENRY Madame my interpreter what says she
 ALICE Dat it is not be de fashion pour le ladies of France I
 cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish
 KING HENRY To kiss
 ALICE Your Majestee entendre bettre que moi
 KING HENRY It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss
 before they are married would she say
 ALICE Oui vraiment
 KING HENRY O Kate nice customs curtsy to great kings Dear
Kate
 you and I cannot be confind within the weak list of a
countrys
 fashion we are the makers of manners Kate and the liberty
that
 follows our places stops the mouth of all findfaults as I
will
 do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in
 denying me a kiss therefore patiently and yielding
Kissing
 her You have witchcraft in your lips Kate there is more
 eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the

 French council and they should sooner persuade Henry of
England
 than a general petition of monarchs Here comes your father

 Enter the FRENCH POWER and the ENGLISH LORDS

 BURGUNDY God save your Majesty My royal cousin
 Teach you our princess English
 KING HENRY I would have her learn my fair cousin how
perfectly I
 love her and that is good English
 BURGUNDY Is she not apt
 KING HENRY Our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not
 smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of
 flattery about me I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love
in
 her that he will appear in his true likeness
 BURGUNDY Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for
 that If you would conjure in her you must make a circle if
 conjure up love in her in his true likeness he must appear
naked
 and blind Can you blame her then being a maid yet rosd
over
 with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the
appearance of
 a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self It were my lord
a
 hard condition for a maid to consign to
 KING HENRY Yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and
 enforces
 BURGUNDY They are then excusd my lord when they see not
what
 they do
 KING HENRY Then good my lord teach your cousin to consent
 winking
 BURGUNDY I will wink on her to consent my lord if you will
teach
 her to know my meaning for maids well summerd and warm kept
are
 like flies at Bartholomewtide blind though they have their
 eyes and then they will endure handling which before would
not
 abide looking on
 KING HENRY This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer
and
 so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and
she
 must be blind too
 BURGUNDY As love is my lord before it loves
 KING HENRY It is so and you may some of you thank love for
my
 blindness who cannot see many a fair French city for one
fair
 French maid that stands in my way
 FRENCH KING Yes my lord you see them perspectively the
cities
 turned into a maid for they are all girdled with maiden
walls
 that war hath never entred
 KING HENRY Shall Kate be my wife
 FRENCH KING So please you
 KING HENRY I am content so the maiden cities you talk of may
wait
 on her so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall
show
 me the way to my will
 FRENCH KING We have consented to all terms of reason
 KING HENRY Ist so my lords of England
 WESTMORELAND The king hath granted every article
 His daughter first and then in sequel all
 According to their firm proposed natures
 EXETER Only he hath not yet subscribed this
 Where your Majesty demands that the King of France having
any
 occasion to write for matter of grant shall name your
Highness
 in this form and with this addition in French Notre tres
cher
 fils Henri Roi dAngleterre Heritier de France and thus in
 Latin Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus Rex Angliae et
 Haeres Franciae
 FRENCH KING Nor this I have not brother so denied
 But our request shall make me let it pass
 KING HENRY I pray you then in love and dear alliance
 Let that one article rank with the rest
 And thereupon give me your daughter
 FRENCH KING Take her fair son and from her blood raise up
 Issue to me that the contending kingdoms
 Of France and England whose very shores look pale
 With envy of each others happiness
 May cease their hatred and this dear conjunction
 Plant neighbourhood and Christianlike accord
 In their sweet bosoms that never war advance
 His bleeding sword twixt England and fair France
 LORDS Amen
 KING HENRY Now welcome Kate and bear me witness all
 That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen Floulish
 QUEEN ISABEL God the best maker of all marriages
 Combine your hearts in one your realms in one
 As man and wife being two are one in love
 So be there twixt your kingdoms such a spousal
 That never may ill office or fell jealousy
 Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage
 Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms
 To make divorce of their incorporate league
 That English may as French French Englishmen
 Receive each other God speak this Amen
 ALL Amen
 KING HENRY Prepare we for our marriage on which day
 My Lord of Burgundy well take your oath
 And all the peers for surety of our leagues
 Then shall I swear to Kate and you to me
 And may our oaths well kept and prosprous be
 Sennet Exeunt

 Enter CHORUS

 CHORUS Thus far with rough and allunable pen
 Our bending author hath pursud the story
 In little room confining mighty men
 Mangling by starts the full course of their glory
 Small time but in that small most greatly lived
 This star of England Fortune made his sword
 By which the worlds best garden he achieved
 And of it left his son imperial lord
 Henry the Sixth in infant bands crownd king
 Of France and England did this king succeed
 Whose state so many had the managing
 That they lost France and made his England bleed
 Which oft our stage hath shown and for their sake
 In your fair minds let this acceptance take Exit
