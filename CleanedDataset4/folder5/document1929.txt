THE TEXT OF THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL

The text of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL in this edition is taken by Mr
Fraser Raes generous permission from his SHERIDANS PLAYS NOW PRINTED
AS HE WROTE THEM In his Prefatory Notes xxxvii Mr Rae writes The
manuscript of it THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL in Sheridans own handwriting
is preserved at Frampton Court and is now printed in this volume This
version differs in many respects from that which is generally known
and I think it is even better than that which has hitherto been read and
acted As I have endeavoured to reproduce the works of Sheridan as he
wrote them I may be told that he was a bad hand at punctuating and very
bad at spelling    But Sheridans shortcomings as a speller have
been exaggerated Lest Sheridans shortcomings either in spelling
or in punctuation should obscure the text I have in this edition
inserted in brackets some explanatory suggestions It has seemed best
also to adopt a uniform method for indicating stagedirections and
abbreviations of the names of characters There can be no gain to the
reader in reproducing for example Sheridans different indications for
the part of Lady SneerwellLADY SNEERWELL LADY SNEER LADY SN and
LADY Sor his varying use of EXIT and EX or his inconsistencies in
the use of italics in the stagedirections Since however Sheridans
biographers from Moore to Fraser Rae have shown that no authorised or
correct edition of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL was published in Sheridans
lifetime there seems unusual justification for reproducing the text of
the play itself with absolute fidelity to the original manuscript Mr
Ridgway who repeatedly sought to obtain a copy corrected by the author
according to Moores account LIFE OF SHERIDAN I p 260 was told
by Mr Sheridan as an excuse for keeping it back that he had been
nineteen years endeavouring to satisfy himself with the style of The
School for Scandal but had not yet succeeded Mr Rae SHERIDAN I p
332 recorded his discovery of the manuscript of two acts of The School
for Scandal prepared by Sheridan for publication and hoped before his
death to publish this partial revision Numberless unauthorized changes
in the play have been made for histrionic purposes from the first
undated Dublin edition to that of Mr Augustin Daly Current texts may
usually be traced directly or indirectly to the twovolume Murray
edition of Sheridans plays in 1821 Some of the changes from the
original manuscript such as the blending of the parts of Miss Verjuice
and Snake are doubtless effective for reasons of dramatic economy but
many of the cuts are to be regretted from the readers standpoint The
student of English drama will prefer Sheridans own text to editorial
emendations however clever or effective for dramatic ends





THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL


ADDRESSED TO MRS CREWE

WITH THE COMEDY OF THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL

 Tell me ye prim adepts in Scandals school
 Who rail by precept and detract by rule
 Lives there no character so tried so known
 So deckd with grace and so unlike your own
 That even you assist her fame to raise
 Approve by envy and by silence praise
 Attenda model shall attract your view
 Daughters of calumny I summon you
 You shall decide if this a portrait prove
 Or fond creation of the Muse and Love
 Attend ye virgin critics shrewd and sage
 Ye matron censors of this childish age
 Whose peering eye and wrinkled front declare
 A fixt antipathy to young and fair
 By cunning cautious or by nature cold
 In maiden madness virulently bold
 Attend ye skilled to coin the precious tale
 Creating proof where innuendos fail
 Whose practised memories cruelly exact
 Omit no circumstance except the fact
 Attend all ye who boastor old or young
 The living libel of a slanderous tongue
 So shall my theme as far contrasted be
 As saints by fiends or hymns by calumny
 Come gentle Amoret for neath that name
 In worthier verse is sung thy beautys fame
 Comefor but thee who seeks the Muse and while
 Celestial blushes check thy conscious smile
 With timid grace and hesitating eye
 The perfect model which I boast supply
 Vain Muse couldst thou the humblest sketch create
 Of her or slightest charm couldst imitate
 Could thy blest strain in kindred colours trace
 The faintest wonder of her form and face
 Poets would study the immortal line
 And REYNOLDS own HIS art subdued by thine
 That art which well might added lustre give
 To Natures best and Heavens superlative
 On GRANBYS cheek might bid new glories rise
 Or point a purer beam from DEVONS eyes
 Hard is the task to shape that beautys praise
 Whose judgment scorns the homage flattery pays
 But praising Amoret we cannot err
 No tongue oervalues Heaven or flatters her
 Yet she by Fates perversenessshe alone
 Would doubt our truth nor deem such praise her own
 Adorning Fashion unadornd by dress
 Simple from taste and not from carelessness
 Discreet in gesture in deportment mild
 Not stiff with prudence nor uncouthly wild
 No state has AMORET no studied mien
 She frowns no GODDESS and she moves no QUEEN
 The softer charm that in her manner lies
 Is framed to captivate yet not surprise
 It justly suits th expression of her face
 Tis less than dignity and more than grace
 On her pure cheek the native hue is such
 That formd by Heavn to be admired so much
 The hand divine with a less partial care
 Might well have fixd a fainter crimson there
 And bade the gentle inmate of her breast
 Inshrined Modestysupply the rest
 But who the peril of her lips shall paint
 Strip them of smilesstill still all words are faint
 But moving Love himself appears to teach
 Their action though denied to rule her speech
 And thou who seest her speak and dost not hear
 Mourn not her distant accents scape thine ear
 Viewing those lips thou still mayst make pretence
 To judge of what she says and swear tis sense
 Clothd with such grace with such expression fraught
 They move in meaning and they pause in thought
 But dost thou farther watch with charmd surprise
 The mild irresolution of her eyes
 Curious to mark how frequent they repose
 In brief eclipse and momentary close
 Ah seest thou not an ambushd Cupid there
 Too timrous of his charge with jealous care
 Veils and unveils those beams of heavnly light
 Too full too fatal else for mortal sight
 Nor yet such pleasing vengeance fond to meet
 In pardning dimples hope a safe retreat
 What though her peaceful breast should neer allow
 Subduing frowns to arm her altered brow
 By Love I swear and by his gentle wiles
 More fatal still the mercy of her smiles
 Thus lovely thus adornd possessing all
 Of bright or fair that can to woman fall
 The height of vanity might well be thought
 Prerogative in her and Natures fault
 Yet gentle AMORET in mind supreme
 As well as charms rejects the vainer theme
 And half mistrustful of her beautys store
 She barbs with wit those darts too keen before
 Read in all knowledge that her sex should reach
 Though GREVILLE or the MUSE should deign to teach
 Fond to improve nor timrous to discern
 How far it is a womans grace to learn
 In MILLARS dialect she would not prove
 Apollos priestess but Apollos love
 Graced by those signs which truth delights to own
 The timid blush and mild submitted tone
 Whateer she says though sense appear throughout
 Displays the tender hue of female doubt
 Deckd with that charm how lovely wit appears
 How graceful SCIENCE when that robe she wears
 Such too her talents and her bent of mind
 As speak a sprightly heart by thought refined
 A taste for mirth by contemplation schoold
 A turn for ridicule by candour ruled
 A scorn of folly which she tries to hide
 An awe of talent which she owns with pride
 Peace idle Muse no more thy strain prolong
 But yield a theme thy warmest praises wrong
 Just to her merit though thou canst not raise
 Thy feeble verse behold th acknowledged praise
 Has spread conviction through the envious train
 And cast a fatal gloom oer Scandals reign
 And lo each pallid hag with blisterd tongue
 Mutters assent to all thy zeal has sung
 Owns all the colours justthe outline true
 Thee my inspirer and my MODELCREWE

PROLOGUE WRITTEN BY MR GARRICK

 A school for Scandal tell me I beseech you
 Needs there a school this modish art to teach you
 No need of lessons now the knowing think
 We might as well be taught to eat and drink
 Caused by a dearth of scandal should the vapours
 Distress our fair oneslet them read the papers
 Their powerful mixtures such disorders hit
 Crave what you willtheres quantum sufficit
 Lord cries my Lady Wormwood who loves tattle
 And puts much salt and pepper in her prattle
 Just risen at noon all night at cards when threshing
 Strong tea and scandalBless me how refreshing
 Give me the papers Lisphow bold and free Sips
 LAST NIGHT LORD L Sips WAS CAUGHT WITH LADY D
 For aching heads what charming sal volatile Sips
 IF MRS B WILL STILL CONTINUE FLIRTING
 WE HOPE SHELL draw OR WELL undraw THE CURTAIN
 Fine satire pozin public all abuse it
 But by ourselves Sips our praise we cant refuse it
 Now Lisp read youthere at that dash and star
 Yes maamA CERTAIN LORD HAD BEST BEWARE
 WHO LIVES NOT TWENTY MILES FROM GROSVENOR SQUARE
 FOR SHOULD HE LADY W FIND WILLING
 WORMWOOD IS BITTEROh thats me the villain
 Throw it behind the fire and never more
 Let that vile paper come within my door
 Thus at our friends we laugh who feel the dart
 To reach our feelings we ourselves must smart
 Is our young bard so young to think that he
 Can stop the full springtide of calumny
 Knows he the world so little and its trade
 Alas the devils sooner raised than laid
 So strong so swift the monster theres no gagging
 Cut Scandals head off still the tongue is wagging
 Proud of your smiles once lavishly bestowd
 Again our young Don Quixote takes the road
 To show his gratitude he draws his pen
 And seeks his hydra Scandal in his den
 For your applause all perils he would through
 Hell fightthats writea cavalliero true
 Till every drop of bloodthats inkis spilt for you




ACT I


SCENE ILADY SNEERWELLS House

LADY SNEERWELL at her dressing table with LAPPET MISS VERJUICE drinking
chocolate

LADY SNEERWELL The Paragraphs you say were all inserted

VERJUICE They were Madamand as I copied them myself in a feigned Hand
there can be no suspicion whence they came

LADY SNEERWELL Did you circulate the Report of Lady Brittles Intrigue
with Captain Boastall

VERJUICE Madam by this Time Lady Brittle is the Talk of half the
Townand I doubt not in a week the Men will toast her as a Demirep

LADY SNEERWELL What have you done as to the insinuation as to a certain
Baronets Lady and a certain Cook

VERJUICE That is in as fine a Train as your Ladyship could wish I told
the story yesterday to my own maid with directions to communicate it
directly to my Hairdresser He I am informed has a Brother who courts a
Milliners Prentice in Pallmall whose mistress has a first cousin whose
sister is Feme Femme de Chambre to Mrs Clackitso that in the
common course of Things it must reach Mrs Clackits Ears within
fourandtwenty hours and then you know the Business is as good as done

LADY SNEERWELL Why truly Mrs Clackit has a very pretty Talenta great
deal of industryyetyesbeen tolerably successful in her wayTo my
knowledge she has been the cause of breaking off six matches of three
sons being disinherited and four Daughters being turned out of Doors
Of three several Elopements as many close confinementsnine separate
maintenances and two Divorcesnay I have more than once traced her
causing a TeteaTete in the Town and Country Magazinewhen the Parties
perhaps had never seen each others Faces before in the course of their
Lives

VERJUICE She certainly has Talents

LADY SNEERWELL But her manner is gross

VERJUICE Tis very true She generally designs well has a free
tongue and a bold inventionbut her colouring is too dark and her
outline often extravagantShe wants that delicacy of Tintand
mellowness of sneerwhich distinguish your Ladyships Scandal

LADY SNEERWELL Ah you are Partial Verjuice

VERJUICE Not in the leasteverybody allows that Lady Sneerwell can do
more with a word or a Look than many can with the most laboured Detail
even when they happen to have a little truth on their side to support
it

LADY SNEERWELL Yes my dear Verjuice I am no Hypocrite to deny the
satisfaction I reap from the Success of my Efforts Wounded myself in
the early part of my Life by the envenomed Tongue of Slander I confess
I have since known no Pleasure equal to the reducing others to the Level
of my own injured Reputation

VERJUICE Nothing can be more naturalBut my dear Lady Sneerwell There
is one affair in which you have lately employed me wherein I confess I
am at a Loss to guess your motives

LADY SNEERWELL I conceive you mean with respect to my neighbour Sir
Peter Teazle and his FamilyLappetAnd has my conduct in this matter
really appeared to you so mysterious

 Exit MAID

VERJUICE Entirely so

LADY SNEERWELL VERJUICE An old Batchelor as Sir Peter was having
taken a young wife from out of the Countryas Lady Teazle isare
certainly fair subjects for a little mischievous raillerybut here are
two young mento whom Sir Peter has acted as a kind of Guardian since
their Fathers death the eldest possessing the most amiable Character
and universally well spoken of the youngest the most dissipated
and extravagant young Fellow in the Kingdom without Friends or
caracterthe former one an avowed admirer of yours and apparently
your Favourite the latter attached to Maria Sir Peters wardand
confessedly beloved by her Now on the face of these circumstances it
is utterly unaccountable to me why you a young Widow with no great
jointureshould not close with the passion of a man of such character
and expectations as Mr Surfaceand more so why you should be so
uncommonly earnest to destroy the mutual Attachment subsisting between
his Brother Charles and Maria

LADY SNEERWELL Then at once to unravel this misteryI must inform you
that Love has no share whatever in the intercourse between Mr Surface
and me

VERJUICE No

LADY SNEERWELL His real attachment is to Maria or her Fortunebut
finding in his Brother a favoured Rival He has been obliged to mask his
Pretensionsand profit by my Assistance

VERJUICE Yet still I am more puzzled why you should interest yourself
in his success

LADY SNEERWELL Heavens how dull you are cannot you surmise the
weakness which I hitherto thro shame have concealed even from
youmust I confess that Charlesthat Libertine that extravagant that
Bankrupt in Fortune and Reputationthat He it is for whom I am thus
anxious and malicious and to gain whom I would sacrificeeverything

VERJUICE Now indeedyour conduct appears consistent and I no longer
wonder at your enmity to Maria but how came you and Surface so
confidential

LADY SNEERWELL For our mutual interestbut I have found out him a long
time since altho He has contrived to deceive everybody besideI
know him to be artful selfish and maliciouswhile with Sir Peter and
indeed with all his acquaintance He passes for a youthful Miracle of
Prudencegood sense and Benevolence

VERJUICE Yes yesI know Sir Peter vows He has not his equal in
England and above all He praises him as a MAN OF SENTIMENT

LADY SNEERWELL True and with the assistance of his sentiments and
hypocrisy he has brought Sir Peter entirely in his interests with
respect to Maria and is now I believe attempting to flatter Lady Teazle
into the same good opinion towards himwhile poor Charles has no Friend
in the Housethough I fear he has a powerful one in Marias Heart
against whom we must direct our schemes

SERVANT Mr Surface

LADY SNEERWELL Shew him up He generally calls about this Time I dont
wonder at Peoples giving him to me for a Lover

 Enter SURFACE

SURFACE My dear Lady Sneerwell how do you do todayyour most
obedient

LADY SNEERWELL Miss Verjuice has just been arraigning me on our mutual
attachment now but I have informed her of our real views and the
Purposes for which our Geniuses at present cooperate You know
how useful she has been to usand believe me the confidence is not
illplaced

SURFACE Madam it is impossible for me to suspect that a Lady of Miss
Verjuices sensibility and discernment

LADY SNEERWELL Wellwellno compliments nowbut tell me when you saw
your mistress or what is more material to me your Brother

SURFACE I have not seen either since I saw youbut I can inform you
that they are at present at Variancesome of your stories have taken
good effect on Maria

LADY SNEERWELL Ah my dear Verjuice the merit of this belongs to you
But do your Brothers Distresses encrease

SURFACE Every hour I am told He had another execution in his house
yesterdayin short his Dissipation and extravagance exceed anything I
have ever heard of

LADY SNEERWELL Poor Charles

SURFACE True Madamnotwithstanding his Vices one cant help feeling
for himah poor Charles Im sure I wish it was in my Power to be of
any essential Service to himfor the man who does not share in
the Distresses of a Brothereven though merited by his own
misconductdeserves

LADY SNEERWELL O Lud you are going to be moral and forget that you are
among Friends

SURFACE Egad thats trueIll keep that sentiment till I see Sir
Peter However it is certainly a charity to rescue Maria from such a
Libertine whoif He is to be reclaimd can be so only by a Person of
your Ladyships superior accomplishments and understanding

VERJUICE Twould be a Hazardous experiment

SURFACE ButMadamlet me caution you to place no more confidence in
our Friend Snake the LibellerI have lately detected him in frequent
conference with old Rowland Rowley who was formerly my Fathers
Steward and has never been a friend of mine

LADY SNEERWELL Im not disappointed in Snake I never suspected the
fellow to have virtue enough to be faithful even to his own Villany

 Enter MARIA

Maria my dearhow do you dowhats the matter

MARIA O here is that disagreeable lover of mine Sir Benjamin Backbite
has just calld at my guardians with his odious Uncle Crabtreeso I
slipt out and ran hither to avoid them

LADY SNEERWELL Is that all

VERJUICE Lady SneerwellIll go and write the Letter I mentiond to
you

SURFACE If my Brother Charles had been of the Party madam perhaps you
would not have been so much alarmed

LADY SNEERWELL Nay nowyou are severe for I dare swear the Truth
of the matter is Maria heard YOU were herebut my dearwhat has Sir
Benjamin done that you should avoid him so

MARIA Oh He has done nothingbut his conversation is a perpetual Libel
on all his Acquaintance

SURFACE Aye and the worst of it is there is no advantage in not knowing
Them for Hell abuse a stranger just as soon as his best Friendand
Crabtree is as bad

LADY SNEERWELL Nay but we should make allowanceSir Benjamin is a
wit and a poet

MARIA For my PartI own madamwit loses its respect with me when I
see it in company with maliceWhat do you think Mr Surface

SURFACE Certainly Madam to smile at the jest which plants a Thorn on
anothers Breast is to become a principal in the mischief

LADY SNEERWELL Pshawtheres no possibility of being witty without a
little ill naturethe malice of a good thing is the Barb that makes
it stickWhats your opinion Mr Surface

SURFACE Certainly madamthat conversation where the Spirit of Raillery
is suppressed will ever appear tedious and insipid

MARIA Well Ill not debate how far Scandal may be allowablebut in a
man I am sure it is always contemtableWe have Pride envy Rivalship
and a Thousand motives to depreciate each otherbut the maleslanderer
must have the cowardice of a woman before He can traduce one

LADY SNEERWELL I wish my Cousin Verjuice hadnt left usshe should
embrace you

SURFACE Ah shes an old maid and is privileged of course

 Enter SERVANT

Madam Mrs Candour is below and if your Ladyships at leisure will leave
her carriage

LADY SNEERWELL Beg her to walk in Now Maria however here is a
Character to your Taste for tho Mrs Candour is a little talkative
everybody allows her to be the bestnatured and best sort of woman

MARIA Yes with a very gross affectation of good Nature and
Benevolenceshe does more mischief than the Direct malice of old
Crabtree

SURFACE Efaith tis very true Lady SneerwellWhenever I hear the
current running again the characters of my Friends I never think them
in such Danger as when Candour undertakes their Defence

LADY SNEERWELL Hush here she is

 Enter MRS CANDOUR

MRS CANDOUR My dear Lady Sneerwell how have you been this Century
I have never seen you tho I have heard of you very oftenMr
Surfacethe World says scandalous things of youbut indeed it is
no matter what the world says for I think one hears nothing else but
scandal

SURFACE Just so indeed Maam

MRS CANDOUR Ah Maria Childwhat is the whole affair off between
you and Charles His extravagance I presumeThe Town talks of nothing
else

MARIA I am very sorry Maam the Town has so little to do

MRS CANDOUR True true Child but theres no stopping peoples
Tongues I own I was hurt to hear itas I indeed was to learn from the
same quarter that your guardian Sir Peter and Lady Teazle have not
agreed lately so well as could be wishd

MARIA Tis strangely impertinent for people to busy themselves so

MRS CANDOUR Very true Child but whats to be done People will
talktheres no preventing itwhy it was but yesterday I was told
that Miss Gadabout had eloped with Sir Filagree Flirt But Lord there
is no minding what one hears tho to be sure I had this from very good
authority

MARIA Such reports are highly scandalous

MRS CANDOUR So they are Childshameful shameful but the world is
so censorious no character escapes Lord now who would have suspected
your friend Miss Prim of an indiscretion Yet such is the illnature
of people that they say her unkle stopped her last week just as she was
stepping into a Postchaise with her Dancingmaster

MARIA Ill answer fort there are no grounds for the Report

MRS CANDOUR Oh no foundation in the world I dare swear no more
probably than for the story circulated last month of Mrs Festinos
affair with Colonel Cassinotho to be sure that matter was never
rightly cleard up

SURFACE The license of invention some people take is monstrous indeed

MARIA Tis so but in my opinion those who report such things are
equally culpable

MRS CANDOUR To be sure they are Tale Bearers are as bad as the Tale
makerstis an old observation and a very true onebut whats to be
done as I said beforehow will you prevent People from talkingtoday
Mrs Clackitt assured me Mr and Mrs Honeymoon were at last become
mere man and wifelike the rest of their acquaintanceshe likewise
hinted that a certain widow in the next street had got rid of her Dropsy
and recovered her shape in a most surprising mannerat the same time
Miss Tattle who was by affirmd that Lord Boffalo had discoverd his
Lady at a house of no extraordinary Fameand that Sir Harry Bouquet and
Tom Saunter were to measure swords on a similar Provocation ButLord
do you think I would report these ThingsNo no Tale Bearers as I
said before are just as bad as the talemakers

SURFACE Ah Mrs Candour if everybody had your Forbearance and good
nature

MRS CANDOUR I confess Mr Surface I cannot bear to hear People
traduced behind their Backs and when ugly circumstances come out
against our acquaintances I own I always love to think the bestby the
bye I hope tis not true that your Brother is absolutely ruind

SURFACE I am afraid his circumstances are very bad indeed Maam

MRS CANDOUR Ah I heard sobut you must tell him to keep up his
Spiritseverybody almost is in the same wayLord Spindle Sir Thomas
Splint Captain Quinze and Mr Nickitall up I hear within this
week so if Charles is undone Hell find half his Acquaintance ruind
too and that you know is a consolation

SURFACE Doubtless Maama very great one

 Enter SERVANT

SERVANT Mr Crabtree and Sir Benjamin Backbite

LADY SNEERWELL Soh Maria you see your lover pursues youPositively
you shant escape

 Enter CRABTREE and SIR BENJAMIN BACKBITE

CRABTREE Lady Sneerwell I kiss your hand Mrs Candour I dont believe
you are acquainted with my Nephew Sir Benjamin BackbiteEgad Maam He
has a pretty witand is a pretty Poet too isnt He Lady Sneerwell

SIR BENJAMIN O fie Uncle

CRABTREE Nay egad its trueI back him at a Rebus or a Charade against
the best Rhymer in the Kingdomhas your Ladyship heard the Epigram he
wrote last week on Lady Frizzles Feather catching FireDo Benjamin
repeat itor the Charade you made last Night extempore at Mrs
Drowzies conversazioneCome now your first is the Name of a Fish your
second a great naval commanderand

SIR BENJAMIN Dear Unclenowprithee

CRABTREE Efaith Maamtwould surprise you to hear how ready he is at
all these Things

LADY SNEERWELL I wonder Sir Benjamin you never publish anything

SIR BENJAMIN To say truth Maam tis very vulgar to Print and as my
little Productions are mostly Satires and Lampoons I find they
circulate more by giving copies in confidence to the Friends of the
Partieshowever I have some loveElegies which when favoured with
this ladys smile I mean to give to the Public

Pointing to MARIA

CRABTREE Fore Heaven maam theyll immortalize youyoull be handed
down to Posterity like Petrarchs Laura or Wallers Sacharissa

SIR BENJAMIN Yes Madam I think you will like themwhen you shall see
in a beautiful Quarto Page how a neat rivulet of Text shall meander
thro a meadow of marginfore Gad they will be the most elegant
Things of their kind

CRABTREE But Ladies have you heard the news

MRS CANDOUR What Sir do you mean the Report of

CRABTREE No maam thats not itMiss Nicely is going to be married to
her own Footman

MRS CANDOUR Impossible

CRABTREE Ask Sir Benjamin

SIR BENJAMIN Tis very true Maameverything is fixed and the wedding
Livery bespoke

CRABTREE Yes and they say there were pressing reasons fort

MRS CANDOUR It cannot beand I wonder any one should believe such a
story of so prudent a Lady as Miss Nicely

SIR BENJAMIN O Lud maam thats the very reason twas believed at
once She has always been so cautious and so reserved that everybody
was sure there was some reason for it at bottom

LADY SNEERWELL Yes a Tale of Scandal is as fatal to the Reputation of
a prudent Lady of her stamp as a Fever is generally to those of the
strongest Constitutions but there is a sort of puny sickly Reputation
that is always ailing yet will outlive the robuster characters of a
hundred Prudes

SIR BENJAMIN True Madam there are Valetudinarians in Reputation as well
as constitutionwho being conscious of their weak Part avoid the
least breath of air and supply their want of Stamina by care and
circumspection

MRS CANDOUR Well but this may be all mistakeYou know Sir Benjamin
very trifling circumstances often give rise to the most injurious Tales

CRABTREE That they do Ill be sworn Maamdid you ever hear how
Miss Shepherd came to lose her Lover and her Character last summer at
TunbridgeSir Benjamin you remember it

SIR BENJAMIN O to be sure the most whimsical circumstance

LADY SNEERWELL How was it Pray

CRABTREE Why one evening at Mrs Pontos Assemblythe conversation
happened to turn on the difficulty of breeding NovaScotia Sheep in
this countrysays a young Lady in company I have known instances
of itfor Miss Letitia Shepherd a first cousin of mine had a
NovaScotia Sheep that produced her TwinsWhat cries the old
Dowager Lady Dundizzy who you know is as deaf as a Post has Miss
Letitia Shepherd had twinsThis Mistakeas you may imagine threw
the whole company into a fit of LaughingHowever twas the next morning
everywhere reported and in a few Days believed by the whole Town that
Miss Letitia Shepherd had actually been brought to Bed of a fine Boy
and Girland in less than a week there were People who could name the
Father and the Farm House where the Babies were put out to Nurse

LADY SNEERWELL Strange indeed

CRABTREE Matter of Fact I assure youO Lud Mr Surface pray is it
true that your uncle Sir Oliver is coming home

SURFACE Not that I know of indeed Sir

CRABTREE He has been in the East Indies a long timeyou can scarcely
remember himI believesad comfort on his arrival to hear how your
Brother has gone on

SURFACE Charles has been imprudent Sir to be sure but I hope no Busy
people have already prejudiced Sir Oliver against himHe may reform

SIR BENJAMIN To be sure He mayfor my Part I never believed him to be
so utterly void of Principle as People sayand tho he has lost all his
Friends I am told nobody is better spoken ofby the Jews

CRABTREE Thats true egad nephewif the Old Jewry was a Ward I believe
Charles would be an aldermanno man more popular there fore Gad I
hear He pays as many annuities as the Irish Tontine and that whenever
Hes sick they have Prayers for the recovery of his Health in the
synagogue

SIR BENJAMIN Yet no man lives in greater Splendourthey tell me when
He entertains his FriendsHe can sit down to dinner with a dozen of his
own Securities have a score Tradesmen waiting in the AntiChamber and
an officer behind every guests Chair

SURFACE This may be entertainment to you Gentlemen but you pay very
little regard to the Feelings of a Brother

MARIA Their malice is intolerableLady Sneerwell I must wish you a
good morningIm not very well

 Exit MARIA

MRS CANDOUR O dear she changd colour very much

LADY SNEERWELL Do Mrs Candour follow hershe may want assistance

MRS CANDOUR That I will with all my soul maamPoor dear Girlwho
knowswhat her situation may be

 Exit MRS CANDOUR

LADY SNEERWELL Twas nothing but that she could not bear to hear
Charles reflected on notwithstanding their difference

SIR BENJAMIN The young Ladys Penchant is obvious

CRABTREE But Benjaminyou mustnt give up the Pursuit for thatfollow
her and put her into good humourrepeat her some of your versescome
Ill assist you

SIR BENJAMIN Mr Surface I did not mean to hurt youbut depend ont
your Brother is utterly undone

 Going

CRABTREE O Lud ayeundoneas ever man wascant raise a guinea

SIR BENJAMIN And everything soldIm toldthat was movable

 Going

CRABTREE I was at his housenot a thing left but some empty Bottles
that were overlooked and the Family Pictures which I believe are framed
in the Wainscot

 Going

SIR BENJAMIN And Im very sorry to hear also some bad stories against
him

CRABTREE O He has done many mean thingsthats certain

SIR BENJAMIN But however as He is your Brother

CRABTREE Well tell you all another opportunity

 Exeunt

LADY SNEERWELL Ha ha ha tis very hard for them to leave a subject
they have not quite run down

SURFACE And I believe the Abuse was no more acceptable to your Ladyship
than Maria

LADY SNEERWELL I doubt her Affections are farther engaged than we
imagind but the Family are to be here this Evening so you may as
well dine where you are and we shall have an opportunity of observing
fartherin the meantime Ill go and plot Mischief and you shall study
Sentiments

 Exeunt




SCENE IISIR PETERS House

SIR PETER When an old Bachelor takes a young Wifewhat is He to
expectTis now six months since Lady Teazle made me the happiest
of menand I have been the most miserable Dog ever since that ever
committed wedlock We tift a little going to churchand came to a
Quarrel before the Bells had done ringingI was more than once nearly
chokd with gall during the Honeymoonand had lost all comfort in Life
before my Friends had done wishing me Joyyet I chose with cautiona
girl bred wholly in the countrywho never knew luxury beyond one silk
gownnor dissipation above the annual Gala of a RaceBallYet she now

is always in the wrong But Lady Sneerwell and the Set she meets at her
House encourage the perverseness of her Dispositionthen to complete
my vexationsMariamy Wardwhom I ought to have the Power of a Father

bestow herself on his profligate Brother

SIR PETER You are wrong Master Rowleyon their Fathers Death you

Olivers Eastern Bounty gave them an early independence Of course no
person could have more opportunities of judging of their Heartsand I
was never mistaken in my life Joseph is indeed a model for the young
men of the AgeHe is a man of Sentimentand acts up to the Sentiments
he professesbut for the other take my word fort if he had any
grain of Virtue by descenthe has dissipated it with the rest of his
inheritance Ah my old Friend Sir Oliver will be deeply mortified when
he finds how Part of his Bounty has been misapplied

SCENE ISIR PETER and LADY TEAZLE

SIR PETER Lady TeazleLady Teazle Ill not bear it

LADY TEAZLE Sir PeterSir Peter youmay scold or smile according to
your Humour but I ought to have my own way in everything and whats
more I will toowhat tho I was educated in the country I know very
well that women of Fashion in London are accountable to nobody after
they are married

SIR PETER Very well maam very well so a husband is to have no
influence no authority

LADY TEAZLE Authority no to be sureif you wanted authority over me
you should have adopted me and not married me I am sure you were old
enough

SIR PETER Old enoughaye there it iswellwellLady Teazle tho
my life may be made unhappy by your TemperIll not be ruined by your
extravagance

LADY TEAZLE My extravagance Im sure Im not more extravagant than a
woman of Fashion ought to be

SIR PETER No no Madam you shall throw away no more sums on such
unmeaning LuxurySlife to spend as much to furnish your Dressing Room
with Flowers in winter as would suffice to turn the Pantheon into a
Greenhouse and give a Fete Champetre at Christmas

LADY TEAZLE Lord Sir Peter am I to blame because Flowers are dear in
cold weather You should find fault with the Climate and not with me
For my Part Im sure I wish it was spring all the year roundand that
Roses grew under ones Feet

SIR PETER Oons Madamif you had been born to those Fopperies I
shouldnt wonder at your talking thusbut you forget what your
situation was when I married you

LADY TEAZLE No no I donttwas a very disagreeable one or I should
never nave married you

SIR PETER Yes yes madam you were then in somewhat a humbler
Stylethe daughter of a plain country Squire Recollect Lady Teazle
when I saw you firstsitting at your tambour in a pretty figured linen
gownwith a Bunch of Keys at your side and your apartment hung round
with Fruits in worsted of your own working

LADY TEAZLE O horriblehorribledont put me in mind of it

SIR PETER Yes yes Madam and your daily occupation to inspect
the Dairy superintend the Poultry make extracts from the Family
Receiptbook and comb your aunt Deborahs Lap Dog

LADY TEAZLE Abominable

SIR PETER Yes Madamand what were your evening amusements to draw
Patterns for Ruffles which you hadnt the materials to makeplay Pope
Joan with the Curateto read a sermon to your Auntor be stuck down to
an old Spinet to strum your father to sleep after a Fox Chase

LADY TEAZLE ScandalousSir Peter not a word of it true

SIR PETER Yes MadamThese were the recreations I took you fromand
nowno one more extravagantly in the FashionEvery Fopery adopteda
headdress to oer top Lady Pagoda with feathers pendant horizontal and
perpendicularyou forget Lady Teazlewhen a little wired gauze with
a few Beads made you a fly Cap not much bigger than a blewbottle and
your Hair was combd smooth over a Roll

LADY TEAZLE Shocking horrible Roll

SIR PETER But nowyou must have your coachVisavis and three
powderd Footmen before your Chairand in the summer a pair of white
cobs to draw you to Kensington Gardensno recollection when y ou were
content to ride double behind the Butler on a docked CoachHorse

LADY TEAZLE HorridI swear I never did

SIR PETER This madam was your situationand what have I not done
for you I have made you woman of Fashion of Fortune of Rankin short I
have made you my wife

LADY TEAZLE Well then and there is but one thing more you can make me
to add to the obligation

SIR PETER Whats that pray

LADY TEAZLE Your widow

SIR PETER Thank you Madambut dont flatter yourself for though your
illconduct may disturb my Peace it shall never break my Heart I promise
youhowever I am equally obliged to you for the Hint

LADY TEAZLE Then why will you endeavour to make yourself so
disagreeable to meand thwart me in every little elegant expense

SIR PETER SlifeMadam I pray had you any of these elegant expenses
when you married me

LADY TEAZLE Lud Sir Peter would you have me be out of the Fashion

SIR PETER The Fashion indeedwhat had you to do with the Fashion
before you married me

LADY TEAZLE For my PartI should think you would like to have your
wife thought a woman of Taste

SIR PETER Aye there againTaste Zounds Madam you had no Taste when
you married me

LADY TEAZLE Thats very true indeed Sir Peter after having married you
I should never pretend to Taste again I allow

SIR PETER Soso thenMadamif these are your Sentiments pray how
came I to be honourd with your Hand

LADY TEAZLE Shall I tell you the Truth

SIR PETER If its not too great a Favour

LADY TEAZLE Why the Fact is I was tired of all those agreeable
Recreations which you have so good naturally naturedly Describedand
having a Spirit to spend and enjoy a FortuneI determined to marry the
first rich man that would have me

SIR PETER A very honest confessiontrulybut pray madam was there no
one else you might have tried to ensnare but me

LADY TEAZLE O ludI drew my net at several but you were the only one I
could catch

SIR PETER This is plain dealing indeed

LADY TEAZLE But now Sir Peter if we have finishd our daily Jangle I
presume I may go to my engagement at Lady Sneerwells

SIR PETER Ayetheres another Precious circumstancea charming set of
acquaintanceyou have made there

LADY TEAZLE Nay Sir Peter they are People of Rank and Fortuneand
remarkably tenacious of reputation

SIR PETER Yes egad they are tenacious of Reputation with a vengeance
for they dont chuse anybody should have a Character but themselves
Such a crew Ah many a wretch has rid on hurdles who has done less
mischief than these utterers of forged Tales coiners of Scandal and
clippers of Reputation

LADY TEAZLE What would you restrain the freedom of speech

SIR PETER Aye they have made you just as bad as any one of the
Society

LADY TEAZLE WhyI believe I do bear a Part with a tolerable GraceBut
I vow I bear no malice against the People I abuse when I say an
illnatured thing tis out of pure Good Humourand I take it for
granted they deal exactly in the same manner with me but Sir Peter you
know you promised to come to Lady Sneerwells too

SIR PETER Well well Ill call in just to look after my own character

LADY TEAZLE Then indeed you must make Haste after me or youll be
too lateso good bye to ye

SIR PETER SoI have gaind much by my intended expostulationyet
with what a charming air she contradicts every thing I sayand how
pleasingly she shows her contempt of my authorityWell tho I cant
make her love me there is certainly a great satisfaction in quarrelling
with her and I think she never appears to such advantage as when she is
doing everything in her Power to plague me

LADY SNEERWELL Nay positively we will hear it

SURFACE Yesyes the Epigram by all means

SiR BENJAMIN O plague ont unkletis mere nonsense

CRABTREE No no fore gad very clever for an extempore

SIR BENJAMIN But ladies you should be acquainted with the
circumstances You must know that one day last week as Lady Betty
Curricle was taking the Dust in High Park in a sort of duodecimo
Phaetonshe desired me to write some verses on her Poniesupon which I
took out my PocketBookand in one moment producedthe following

 Sure never were seen two such beautiful Ponies
 Other Horses are Clownsand these macaronies
 Nay to give em this Title Im sure isnt wrong
 Their Legs are so slimand their Tails are so long

CRABTREE There Ladiesdone in the smack of a whip and on Horseback

LADY SNEERWELL Maria my love you look grave Come you sit down to
Piquet with Mr Surface

MARIA I take very little Pleasure in cardshowever Ill do as you
Please

LADY TEAZLE I am surprised Mr Surface should sit down herI thought
He would have embraced this opportunity of speaking to me before Sir
Peter cameAside

MRS CANDOUR Now Ill die but you are so scandalous Ill forswear your
society

LADY TEAZLE Whats the matter Mrs Candour

MRS CANDOUR Theyll not allow our friend Miss Vermillion to be
handsome

LADY SNEERWELL Oh surely she is a pretty woman   

CRABTREE I am very glad you think so maam

MRS CANDOUR She has a charming fresh Colour

CRABTREE Yes when it is fresh put on

LADY TEAZLE O fie Ill swear her colour is naturalI have seen it
come and go

CRABTREE I dare swear you have maam it goes of a Night and comes
again in the morning

SIR BENJAMIN True uncle it not only comes and goes but whats more
egad her maid can fetch and carry it

MRS CANDOUR Ha ha ha how I hate to hear you talk so But surely
now her Sister is or was very handsome

CRABTREE Who Mrs Stucco O lud shes sixandfifty if shes an hour

MRS CANDOUR Now positively you wrong her fiftytwo or fiftythree
is the utmostand I dont think she looks more

SIR BENJAMIN Ah theres no judging by her looks unless one was to see
her Face

LADY SNEERWELL Wellwellif she does take some pains to repair the
ravages of Timeyou must allow she effects it with great ingenuityand
surely thats better than the careless manner in which the widow Ocre
chaulks her wrinkles

SIR BENJAMIN Nay nowyou are severe upon the widowcomecome it
isnt that she paints so illbut when she has finished her Face she
joins it on so badly to her Neck that she looks like a mended Statue
in which the Connoisseur sees at once that the Heads modern tho the
Trunks antique

CRABTREE Ha ha ha well said Nephew

MRS CANDOUR Ha ha ha Well you make me laugh but I vow I hate you
for itwhat do you think of Miss Simper

SIR BENJAMIN Why she has very pretty Teeth

LADY TEAZLE Yes and on that account when she is neither speaking nor
laughing which very seldom happensshe never absolutely shuts her
mouth but leaves it always on aJar as it were

MRS CANDOUR How can you be so illnatured

LADY TEAZLE Nay I allow even thats better than the Pains Mrs Prim
takes to conceal her losses in Frontshe draws her mouth till it
resembles the aperture of a PoorsBox and all her words appear to
slide out edgewise

LADY SNEERWELL Very well Lady Teazle I see you can be a little severe

LADY TEAZLE In defence of a Friend it is but justice but here comes
Sir Peter to spoil our Pleasantry

 Enter SIR PETER

SIR PETER Ladies your obedientMercy on mehere is the whole set a
characters dead at every word I suppose

MRS CANDOUR I am rejoiced you are come Sir Peterthey have been so
censorious and Lady Teazle as bad as any one

SIR PETER That must be very distressing to you Mrs Candour I dare
swear

MRS CANDOUR O they will allow good Qualities to nobodynot even good
nature to our Friend Mrs Pursy

LADY TEAZLE What the fat dowager who was at Mrs Codrilles
Quadrilles last Night

LADY SNEERWELL Nayher bulk is her misfortune and when she takes such
Pains to get rid of it you ought not to reflect on her

MRS CANDOUR Tis very true indeed

LADY TEAZLE Yes I know she almost lives on acids and small wheylaces
herself by pulleys and often in the hottest noon of summer you may
see her on a little squat Pony with her hair plaited up behind like a
Drummers and puffing round the Ring on a full trot

MRS CANDOUR I thank you Lady Teazle for defending her

SIR PETER Yes a good Defence truly

MRS CANDOUR But for Sir Benjamin He is as censorious as Miss Sallow

CRABTREE Yes and she is a curious Being to pretend to be censoriousan
awkward Gawky without any one good Point under Heaven

LADY SNEERWELL Positively you shall not be so very severe Miss
Sallow is a Relation of mine by marriage and as for her Person great
allowance is to be madefor let me tell you a woman labours under many
disadvantages who tries to pass for a girl at sixandthirty

MRS CANDOUR Tho surely she is handsome stilland for the weakness
in her eyes considering how much she reads by candlelight it is not to
be wonderd at

LADY SNEERWELL True and then as to her mannerupon my word I think
it is particularly graceful considering she never had the least
Education for you know her Mother was a Welch milliner and her
Father a sugarBaker at Bristow

SIR BENJAMIN Ah you are both of you too goodnatured

SIR PETER Yes damned goodnatured Her own relation mercy on me
Aside

MRS CANDOUR For my Part I own I cannot bear to hear a friend
illspoken of

SIR PETER No to be sure

SIR BENJAMIN Ah you are of a moral turn Mrs Candour and can sit for an
hour to hear Lady Stucco talk sentiments

LADY SNEERWELL Nay I vow Lady Stucco is very well with the Dessert
after Dinner for shes just like the Spanish Fruit one cracks for
mottoesmade up of Paint and Proverb

MRS CANDOUR Well I never will join in ridiculing a Friendand so I
constantly tell my cousin Ogleand you all know what pretensions she
has to be critical in Beauty

LADY TEAZLE O to be sure she has herself the oddest countenance that
ever was seentis a collection of Features from all the different
Countries of the globe

SIR BENJAMIN So she has indeedan Irish Front

CRABTREE Caledonian Locks

SIR BENJAMIN Dutch Nose

CRABTREE Austrian Lips

SIR BENJAMIN Complexion of a Spaniard

CRABTREE And Teeth a la Chinoise

SIR BENJAMIN In short her Face resembles a table dhote at Spawhere
no two guests are of a nation

CRABTREE Or a Congress at the close of a general Warwherein all the
members even to her eyes appear to have a different interest and her
Nose and Chin are the only Parties likely to join issue

MRS CANDOUR Ha ha ha

SIR PETER Mercy on my Life a Person they dine with twice a week
Aside

LADY SNEERWELL Gogoyou are a couple of provoking Toads

MRS CANDOUR Nay but I vow you shall not carry the Laugh off sofor
give me leave to say that Mrs Ogle

SIR PETER MadammadamI beg your Pardontheres no stopping these
good Gentlemens Tonguesbut when I tell you Mrs Candour that the Lady
they are abusing is a particular Friend of mine I hope youll not take
her Part

LADY SNEERWELL Ha ha ha well said Sir Peterbut you are a cruel
creaturetoo Phlegmatic yourself for a jest and too peevish to allow
wit in others

SIR PETER Ah Madam true wit is more nearly allowd allied to good
Nature than your Ladyship is aware of

LADY SNEERWELL True Sir PeterI believe they are so near akin that
they can never be united

SIR BENJAMIN O rather Madam suppose them man and wife because one
seldom sees them together

LADY TEAZLE But Sir Peter is such an Enemy to Scandal I believe He
would have it put down by Parliament

SIR PETER Fore heaven Madam if they were to consider the Sporting
with Reputation of as much importance as poaching on manorsand pass
an Act for the Preservation of Famethere are many would thank them for
the Bill

LADY SNEERWELL O Lud Sir Peter would you deprive us of our
Privileges

SIR PETER Aye Madamand then no person should be permitted to
kill characters or run down reputations but qualified old Maids and
disappointed Widows

LADY SNEERWELL Go you monster

MRS CANDOUR But sure you would not be quite so severe on those who
only report what they hear

SIR PETER Yes Madam I would have Law Merchant for that tooand in all
cases of slander currency whenever the Drawer of the Lie was not to
be found the injured Party should have a right to come on any of the
indorsers

CRABTREE Well for my Part I believe there never was a Scandalous Tale
without some foundation3

LADY SNEERWELL Come Ladies shall we sit down to Cards in the next Room

 Enter SERVANT whispers SIR PETER

SIR PETER Ill be with them directly

 Exit SERVANT
Ill get away unperceived

LADY SNEERWELL Sir Peter you are not leaving us

SIR PETER Your Ladyship must excuse meIm called away by particular
Businessbut I leave my Character behind me

 Exit

SIR BENJAMIN Well certainly Lady Teazle that lord of yours is a
strange beingI could tell you some stories of him would make you laugh
heartily if He wernt your Husband

LADY TEAZLE O pray dont mind thatcome do lets hear em

 join the rest of the Company going into the Next Room

SURFACE Maria I see you have no satisfaction in this society

MARIA How is it possible I should If to raise malicious smiles at the
infirmities or misfortunes of those who have never injured us be
the province of wit or Humour Heaven grant me a double Portion of
Dullness

SURFACE Yet they appear more illnatured than they arethey have no
malice at heart

MARIA Then is their conduct still more contemptible for in my
opinionnothing could excuse the intemperance of their tongues but a
natural and ungovernable bitterness of Mind

SURFACE Undoubtedly Madamand it has always been a sentiment of
minethat to propagate a malicious Truth wantonlyis more despicable
than to falsify from Revenge but can you Maria feel thus for others
and be unkind to me alonenay is hope to be denied the tenderest
Passion

MARIA Why will you distress me by renewing this subject

SURFACE Ah Maria you would not treat me thus and oppose your
guardians Sir Peters wishesbut that I see that my Profligate Brother
is still a favourd Rival

MARIA Ungenerously urgedbut whatever my sentiments of that
unfortunate young man are be assured I shall not feel more bound to
give him up because his Distresses have sunk him so low as to deprive
him of the regard even of a Brother

SURFACE Nay but Maria do not leave me with a Frownby all thats
honest I swearGads Life heres Lady Teazleyou must notno you
shallfor tho I have the greatest Regard for Lady Teazle

MARIA Lady Teazle

SURFACE Yet were Sir Peter to suspect

 Enter LADY TEAZLE and comes forward

LADY TEAZLE Whats this Praydo you take her for meChild you are
wanted in the next RoomWhats all this pray

SURFACE O the most unlucky circumstance in Nature Maria has somehow
suspected the tender concern I have for your happiness and threatend
to acquaint Sir Peter with her suspicionsand I was just endeavouring
to reason with her when you came

LADY TEAZLE Indeed but you seemd to adopta very tender mode of
reasoningdo you usually argue on your knees

SURFACE O shes a Childand I thought a little Bombastbut Lady
Teazle when are you to give me your judgment on my Library as you
promised

LADY TEAZLE Nono I begin to think it would be imprudentand you know
I admit you as a Lover no farther than Fashion requires

SURFACE Truea mere Platonic Cicisbeo what every London wife is
entitled to

LADY TEAZLE Certainly one must not be out of the Fashionhowever I
have so much of my country Prejudices leftthatthough Sir Peters ill
humour may vex me ever so it never shall provoke me to

SURFACE The only revenge in your Powerwell I applaud your moderation

LADY TEAZLE Goyou are an insinuating Hypocritebut we shall be
missdlet us join the company

SURFACE True but we had best not return together

LADY TEAZLE Well dont stayfor Maria shant come to hear any more of
your Reasoning I promise you

 Exit

SURFACE A curious Dilemma truly my Politics have run me into I wanted
at first only to ingratiate myself with Lady Teazle that she might not
be my enemy with Mariaand I have I dont know howbecome her
serious Lover so that I stand a chance of Committing a Crime I never
meditatedand probably of losing Maria by the PursuitSincerely I
begin to wish I had never made such a Point of gaining so very good a
character for it has led me into so many curst Rogueries that I doubt I
shall be exposed at last

SCENE IIIAt SIR PETERS

 ROWLEY and SIR OLIVER

SIR OLIVER Ha ha ha and so my old Friend is married heya young
wife out of the countryha ha that he should have stood Bluff to old
Bachelor so long and sink into a Husband at last

ROWLEY But you must not rally him on the subject Sir Olivertis a
tender Point I assure you though He has been married only seven months

SIR OLIVER Ah then he has been just half a year on the stool
of RepentancePoor Peter But you say he has entirely given up
Charlesnever sees him hey

ROWLEY His Prejudice against him is astonishingand I am sure greatly
increased by a jealousy of him with Lady Teazlewhich he has
been industriously led into by a scandalous Societyin the
neighbourhoodwho have contributed not a little to Charless ill name
Whereas the truth is I believe if the lady is partial to either of
them his Brother is the Favourite

SIR OLIVER AyeI knowthere are a set of malicious prating prudent
Gossips both male and Female who murder characters to kill time and
will rob a young Fellow of his good name before He has years to know the
value of it   but I am not to be prejudiced against my nephew by
such I promise you No noif Charles has done nothing false or mean I
shall compound for his extravagance

ROWLEY Then my life ont you will reclaim him Ah Sir it gives me
new vigour to find that your heart is not turned against himand that
the son of my good old master has one friend however left

SIR OLIVER What shall I forget Master Rowleywhen I was at his
house myselfegad my Brother and I were neither of us very prudent
youthsand yet I believe you have not seen many better men than your
old master was

ROWLEY Tis this Reflection gives me assurance that Charles may yet be
a credit to his Familybut here comes Sir Peter

SIR OLIVER Egad so He doesmercy on meHes greatly alteredand
seems to have a settled married lookone may read Husband in his Face
at this Distance

SIR PETER Wildoh my old FriendI grieve for your disappointment
thereHes a lost young man indeedhowever his Brother will make you
amends Joseph is indeed what a youth should beeverybody in the world
speaks well of him

SIR OLIVER I am sorry to hear ithe has too good a character to be an
honest Fellow Everybody speaks well of him Psha then He has bowd as
low to Knaves and Fools as to the honest dignity of Virtue

SIR PETER What Sir Oliver do you blame him for not making Enemies

SIR OLIVER Yesif He has merit enough to deserve them

SIR PETER Wellwellyoull be convinced when you know himtis
edification to hear him conversehe professes the noblest Sentiments

SIR OLIVER Ah plague on his Sentimentsif he salutes me with a scrap
sentence of morality in his mouth I shall be sick directlybut however
dont mistake me Sir Peter I dont mean to defend Charless Errorsbut
before I form my judgment of either of them I intend to make a trial of
their Heartsand my Friend Rowley and I have planned something for the
Purpose

guidance

SIR OLIVER Odds my LifeI am not sorry that He has run out of the
course a littlefor my Part I hate to see dry Prudence clinging to
the green juices of youthtis like ivy round a sapling and spoils the
growth of the Tree

 END OF THE SECOND ACT




ACT III




SCENE IAt SIR PETERS

 SIR PETER SIR OLIVER and ROWLEY

SIR PETER Well then we will see the Fellows first and have our wine
afterwardsbut how is this Master RowleyI dont see the Jet of your
scheme

ROWLEY Why Sirthis Mr Stanley whom I was speaking of is nearly
related to them by their mother He was once a merchant in Dublinbut
has been ruined by a series of undeserved misfortunesand now lately
coming over to solicit the assistance of his friends herehas been
flyng flung into prison by some of his Creditorswhere he is now with
two helpless Boys

SIR OLIVER Aye and a worthy Fellow too I remember him But what is this
to lead to

ROWLEY You shall hearHe has applied by letter both to Mr Surface and
Charlesfrom the former he has received nothing but evasive promises
of future service while Charles has done all that his extravagance has
left him power to doand He is at this time endeavouring to raise a sum
of moneypart of which in the midst of his own distresses I know He
intends for the service of poor Stanley

SIR OLIVER Ah he is my Brothers Son

SIR PETER Well but how is Sir Oliver personally to

ROWLEY Why Sir I will inform Charles and his Brother that Stanley has
obtaind permission to apply in person to his Friendsand as they
have neither of them ever seen him let Sir Oliver assume his
characterand he will have a fair opportunity of judging at least of
the Benevolence of their Dispositions

SIR PETER Pshaw this will prove nothingI make no doubt Charles is
Coxcomb and thoughtless enough to give money to poor relations if he had
it

SIR OLIVER Then He shall never want it I have brought a few Rupees
home with me Sir Peterand I only want to be sure of bestowing them
rightly

ROWLEY Then Sir believe me you will find in the youngest Brother one
who in the midst of Folly and dissipationhas still as our immortal
Bard expresses it

 a Tear for Pity and a Hand open as the day for melting Charity

SIR PETER Pish What signifies his having an open Hand or Purse
either when He has nothing left to givebut if you talk of humane
SentimentsJoseph is the manWell well make the trial if you
please But where is the fellow whom you brought for Sir Oliver to
examine relative to Charless affairs

ROWLEY Below waiting his commands and no one can give him better
intelligenceThis Sir Oliver is a friendly Jew who to do him
justice has done everything in his power to bring your nephew to a
proper sense of his extravagance

SIR PETER Pray let us have him in

ROWLEY Desire Mr Moses to walk upstairs

 Calls to SERVANT

SIR PETER But Pray why should you suppose he will speak the truth

ROWLEY Oh I have convinced him that he has no chance of recovering
certain Sums advanced to Charles but through the bounty of Sir Oliver
who He knows is arrived so that you may depend on his Fidelity to his
interest I have also another evidence in my Power one Snake whom I
shall shortly produce to remove some of YOUR Prejudices Sir Peter
relative to Charles and Lady Teazle

SIR PETER I have heard too much on that subject

ROWLEY Here comes the honest Israelite

 Enter MOSES
This is Sir Oliver

SIR OLIVER SirI understand you have lately had great dealings with my
Nephew Charles

MOSES Yes Sir OliverI have done all I could for him but He was
ruined before He came to me for Assistance

SIR OLIVER That was unlucky trulyfor you have had no opportunity of
showing your Talents

MOSES None at allI hadnt the Pleasure of knowing his Distresses till
he was some thousands worse than nothing till it was impossible to add
to them

SIR OLIVER Unfortunate indeed but I suppose you have done all in your
Power for him honest Moses

MOSES Yes he knows thatThis very evening I was to have brought him a
gentleman from the city who does not know him and will I believe advance
some money

SIR PETER What one Charles has never had money from before

MOSES YesMr Premium of Crutched Friars

SIR PETER Egad Sir Oliver a Thought strikes meCharles you say
doesnt know Mr Premium

MOSES Not at all

SIR PETER Now then Sir Oliver you may have a better opportunity of
satisfying yourself than by an old romancing tale of a poor Relationgo
with my friend Moses and represent Mr Premium and then Ill answer
fort youll see your Nephew in all his glory

SIR OLIVER Egad I like this Idea better than the other and I may visit
Joseph afterwards as old Stanley

SIR PETER True so you may

ROWLEY Well this is taking Charles rather at a disadvantage to be
surehowever Mosesyou understand Sir Peter and will be faithful

MOSES You may depend upon meand this is near the Time I was to have
gone

SIR OLIVER Ill accompany you as soon as you please Mosesbut
holdI have forgot one thinghow the plague shall I be able to pass
for a Jew

MOSES Theres no needthe Principal is Christian

SIR OLIVER Is HeIm very sorry to hear itbut then againant I
rather too smartly dressed to look like a moneyLender

SIR PETER Not at all twould not be out of character if you went in
your own carriagewould it Moses

MOSES Not in the least

SIR OLIVER Wellbuthow must I talk theres certainly some cant of
usury and mode of treating that I ought to know

SIR PETER Oh theres not much to learnthe great point as I take it
is to be exorbitant enough in your Demands hey Moses

MOSES Yes thats very great Point

SIR OLIVER Ill answer fort Ill not be wanting in thatIll ask him
eight or ten per cent on the loanat least

MOSES Youll be found out directlyif you ask him no more than that
youll be discovered immediately

SIR OLIVER Heywhat the Plaguehow much then

MOSES That depends upon the Circumstancesif he appears not very
anxious for the supply you should require only forty or fifty per
centbut if you find him in great Distress and want the monies very
badyou may ask double

SIR PETER A goodhonest Trade youre learning Sir Oliver

SIR OLIVER Truly I think soand not unprofitable

MOSES Then you knowyou havent the monies yourself but are forced to
borrow them for him of a Friend

SIR OLIVER O I borrow it of a Friend do I

MOSES And your friend is an unconsciond Dogbut you cant help it

SIR OLIVER My Friends an unconscionable Dog is he

MOSES Yesand He himself hasnt the monies by himbut is forced to
sell stockat a great loss

SIR OLIVER He is forced to sell stock is heat a great loss is
hewell thats very kind of him

SIR PETER Efaith Sir OliverMr Premium I meanyoull soon be master
of the Tradebut Moses would have him inquire if the borrower is a
minor

MOSES O yes

SIR PETER And in that case his Conscience will direct him

MOSES To have the Bond in another Name to be sure

SIR OLIVER Wellwell I shall be perfect

SIR PETER But hearkee wouldnt you have him also run out a little
against the annuity Billthat would be in character I should think

MOSES Very much

ROWLEY And lament that a young man now must be at years of discretion
before He is suffered to ruin himself

MOSES Aye great Pity

SIR PETER And abuse the Public for allowing merit to an act whose only
object is to snatch misfortune and imprudence from the rapacious Relief
of usury and give the minor a chance of inheriting his estate without
being undone by coming into Possession

SIR OLIVER SosoMoses shall give me further instructions as we go
together

SIR PETER You will not have much time for your Nephew lives hard
bye

SIR OLIVER Oh Neverfear my Tutor appears so able that tho Charles
lived in the next street it must be my own Fault if I am not a compleat
Rogue before I turn the Corner

MOSES Sir this is Mr Premium a gentleman of the strictest honour
and secrecy and always performs what he undertakes Mr Premium this
is

CHARLES Psha have done Sir my friend Moses is a very honest fellow
but a little slow at expression hell be an hour giving us our titles
Mr Premium the plain state of the matter is this I am an extravagant
young fellow who wants to borrow money you I take to be a prudent old
fellow who have got money to lend I am blockhead enough to give fifty
per cent sooner than not have it and you I presume are rogue enough
to take a hundred if you can get it Now sir you see we are acquainted
at once and may proceed to business without further ceremony

SIR OLIVER Exceeding frank upon my word I see sir you are not a man
of many compliments

CHARLES Oh no sir plain dealing in business I always think best

SIR OLIVER Sir I like you the better for it However You are mistaken
in one thing I have no money to lend but I believe I could procure
some of a friend but then hes an unconscionable dog Isnt he Moses
And must sell stock to accommodate you Mustnt he Moses

MOSES Yes indeed You know I always speak the truth and scorn to tell
a lie

CHARLES Right People that speak truth generally do But these are
trifles Mr Premium What I know money isnt to be bought without
paying fort

SIR OLIVER Well but what security could you give You have no land I
suppose

CHARLES Not a molehill nor a twig but whats in the bough pots out
of the window

SIR OLIVER Nor any stock I presume

CHARLES Nothing but live stockand thats only a few pointers and
ponies But pray Mr Premium are you acquainted at all with any of my
connections

SIR OLIVER Why to say the truth I am

CHARLES Then you must know that I have a devilish rich uncle in
the East Indies Sir Oliver Surface from whom I have the greatest
expectations

SIR OLIVER That you have a wealthy uncle I have heard but how your
expectations will turn out is more I believe than you can tell

CHARLES Oh nothere can be no doubt They tell me Im a prodigious
favourite and that he talks of leaving me everything

SIR OLIVER Indeed this is the first Ive heard of it

CHARLES Yes yes tis just so Moses knows tis true dont you
Moses

MOSES Oh yes Ill swear tot

SIR OLIVER Egad theyll persuade me presently Im at Bengal Aside

CHARLES Now I propose Mr Premium if its agreeable to you a
postobit on Sir Olivers life though at the same time the old fellow
has been so liberal to me that I give you my word I should be very
sorry to hear that anything had happened to him

SIR OLIVER Not more than I should I assure you But the bond you
mention happens to be just the worst security you could offer mefor I
might live to a hundred and never see the principal

CHARLES Oh yes you would the moment Sir Oliver dies you know you
would come on me for the money

SIR OLIVER Then I believe I should be the most unwelcome dun you ever
had in your life

CHARLES What I suppose youre afraid that Sir Oliver is too good a
life

SIR OLIVER No indeed I am not though I have heard he is as hale and
healthy as any man of his years in Christendom

CHARLES There again now you are misinformed No no the climate has
hurt him considerably poor uncle Oliver Yes yes he breaks apace Im
toldand is so much altered lately that his nearest relations would not
know him

SIR OLIVER No Ha ha ha so much altered lately that his nearest
relations would not know him Ha ha ha egadha ha ha

CHARLES Ha hayoure glad to hear that little Premium

SIR OLIVER No no Im not

CHARLES Yes yes you areha ha hayou know that mends your
chance

SIR OLIVER But Im told Sir Oliver is coming over nay some say he is
actually arrived

CHARLES Psha sure I must know better than you whether hes come or
not No no rely ont hes at this moment at Calcutta Isnt he Moses

MOSES Oh yes certainly

SIR OLIVER Very true as you say you must know better than I though I
have it from pretty good authority Havent I Moses

MOSES Yes most undoubted

SIR OLIVER But Sir as I understand you want a few hundreds
immediately is there nothing you could dispose of

CHARLES How do you mean

SIR OLIVER For instance now I have heard that your father left behind
him a great quantity of massy old plate

CHARLES O Lud thats gone long ago Moses can tell you how better than
I can

SIR OLIVER Aside Good lack all the family racecups and
corporationbowlsAloud Then it was also supposed that his library
was one of the most valuable and compact

CHARLES Yes yes so it wasvastly too much so for a private
gentleman For my part I was always of a communicative disposition so
I thought it a shame to keep so much knowledge to myself

SIR OLIVER Aside Mercy upon me learning that had run in the family
like an heirloomAloud Pray what has become of the books

CHARLES You must inquire of the auctioneer Master Premium for I dont
believe even Moses can direct you

MOSES I know nothing of books

SIR OLIVER So so nothing of the family property left I suppose

CHARLES Not much indeed unless you have a mind to the family
pictures I have got a room full of ancestors above and if you have a
taste for old paintings egad you shall have em a bargain

SIR OLIVER Hey what the devil sure you wouldnt sell your
forefathers would you

CHARLES Every man of them to the best bidder

Shylock in the play that you would raise money of me on your own flesh
and blood

CHARLES Nay my little broker dont be angry what need you care if

family canvasAside Oh Ill never forgive him this never

 Enter ROWLEY

Ha old Rowley egad you are just come in time to take leave of your

affort to part with my spirits but I shall be rich and splenetic all
in good time However I suppose you are surprised that I am not more
sorrowful at parting with so many near relations to be sure tis very
affecting but you see they never move a muscle so why should I

pressing and if you dont make haste we shall have some one call that
has a better right to the money

ROWLEY Ah theres the point I never will cease dunning you with the
old proverb

CHARLES BE JUST BEFORE YOURE GENEROUSWhy so I would if I could
but Justice is an old hobbling beldame and I cant get her to keep pace
with Generosity for the soul of me

ROWLEY Yet Charles believe me one hours reflection

SCENE IIIA Library

 SURFACE and SERVANT

SURFACE No letter from Lady Teazle

SERVANT No Sir

SURFACE I am surprised she hasnt sent if she is prevented from
coming Sir Peter certainly does not suspect meyet I wish I may
not lose the Heiress thro the scrape I have drawn myself in with the
wifeHowever Charless imprudence and bad character are great Points
in my Favour

SERVANT SirI believe that must be Lady Teazle

SURFACE Hold seewhether it is or not before you go to the DoorI
have a particular Message for you if it should be my Brother

SERVANT Tis her ladyship SirShe always leaves her Chair at the
milliners in the next Street

SURFACE Staystaydraw that Screen before the Windowthat will
domy opposite Neighbour is a maiden Lady of so curious a temper

 SERVANT draws the screen and exit

I have a difficult Hand to play in this AffairLady Teazle as lately
suspected my Views on Mariabut She must by no means be let into that
secret at least till I have her more in my Power

 Enter LADY TEAZLE

LADY TEAZLE What Sentiment in soliloquyhave you been very
impatient nowO Lud dont pretend to look graveI vow I couldnt
come before

SURFACE O Madam Punctuality is a species of Constancy a very
unfashionable quality in a Lady

LADY TEAZLE Upon my word you ought to pity me do you now Sir Peter
is grown so illtempered to me of Late and so jealous of Charles too
thats the best of the story isnt it

SURFACE I am glad my scandalous Friends keep that up Aside

LADY TEAZLE I am sure I wish He would let Maria marry himand then
perhaps He would be convinceddont youMr Surface

SURFACE Indeed I do notAside O certainly I dofor then my dear
Lady Teazle would also be convinced how wrong her suspicions were of my
having any design on the silly Girl

LADY TEAZLE Wellwell Im inclined to believe youbesides I really
never could perceive why she should have so any admirers

SURFACE O for her Fortunenothing else

LADY TEAZLE I believe so for tho she is certainly very prettyyet she
has no conversation in the worldand is so grave and reservedthat I
declare I think shed have made an excellent wife for Sir Peter

SURFACE So she would

LADY TEAZLE Thenone never hears her speak ill of anybodywhich you
know is mighty dull

SURFACE Yet she doesnt want understanding

LADY TEAZLE No more she doesyet one is always disapointed when
one hears her speakFor though her Eyes have no kind of meaning in
themshe very seldom talks Nonsense

SURFACE Naynay surelyshe has very fine eyes

LADY TEAZLE Why so she hastho sometimes one fancies theres a little
sort of a squint

SURFACE A squintO fieLady Teazle

LADY TEAZLE Yes yesI vow nowcome there is a lefthanded Cupid in
one eyethats the Truth ont

SURFACE Wellhis aim is very direct howeverbut Lady Sneerwell has
quite corrupted you

LADY TEAZLE No indeedI have not opinion enough of her to be taught
by her and I know that she has lately raisd many scandalous hints of
mewhich you know one always hears from one common Friend or other

SURFACE Why to say truth I believe you are not more obliged to her than
others of her acquaintance

LADY TEAZLE But isnt it provoking to hear the most illnatured
Things said to one and theres my friend Lady Sneerwell has circulated
I dont know how many scandalous tales of me and all without any
foundation too thats what vexes me

SURFACE Aye Madam to be sure that is the Provoking
circumstancewithout Foundationyes yestheres the mortification
indeedfor when a slanderous story is believed against onethere
certainly is no comfort like the consciousness of having deserved it

LADY TEAZLE No to be surethen Id forgive their malicebut to attack
me who am really so innocentand who never say an illnatured thing of
anybodythat is of any Friend and then Sir Peter tooto have
him so peevishand so suspiciouswhen I know the integrity of my own
Heartindeed tis monstrous

SURFACE But my dear Lady Teazle tis your own fault if you suffer
itwhen a Husband entertains a groundless suspicion of his Wife and
withdraws his confidence from herthe original compact is broke and she
owes it to the Honour of her sex to endeavour to outwit him

LADY TEAZLE IndeedSo that if He suspects me without cause it follows
that the best way of curing his jealousy is to give him reason fort

SURFACE Undoubtedlyfor your Husband should never be deceived in
youand in that case it becomes you to be frail in compliment to his
discernment

LADY TEAZLE To be sure what you say is very reasonableand when the
consciousness of my own Innocence

SURFACE Ah my dearMadam there is the great mistaketis this very
conscious Innocence that is of the greatest Prejudice to youwhat is
it makes you negligent of Forms and careless of the worlds opinionwhy
the consciousness of your Innocencewhat makes you thoughtless in
your Conduct and apt to run into a thousand little imprudenceswhy the
consciousness of your Innocencewhat makes you impatient of Sir Peters
temper and outrageous at his suspicionswhy the consciousness of your
own Innocence

LADY TEAZLE Tis very true

SURFACE Now my dear Lady Teazle if you but once make a trifling Faux
Pas you cant conceive how cautious you would grow and how ready to
humour and agree with your Husband

LADY TEAZLE Do you think so

SURFACE O Im sure ont and then youd find all scandal would cease
at oncefor in short your Character at Present is like a Person in a
Plethora absolutely dying of too much Health

LADY TEAZLE Sosothen I perceive your Prescription is that I
must sin in my own Defenceand part with my virtue to preserve my
Reputation

SURFACE Exactly so upon my credit Maam

LADY TEAZLE Well certainly this is the oddest Doctrineand the newest
Receipt for avoiding calumny

SURFACE An infallible one believe mePrudence like experience must be
paid for

LADY TEAZLE Why if my understanding were once convinced

SURFACE Oh certainly Madam your understanding SHOULD be
convincedyesyesHeaven forbid I should persuade you to do anything
you THOUGHT wrongnonoI have too much honor to desire it

LADY TEAZLE Dontyou think we may as well leave Honor out of the
Argument Rises

SURFACE Ahthe ill effects of your country education I see still
remain with you

LADY TEAZLE I doubt they do indeedand I will fairly own to you
that If I could be persuaded to do wrong it would be by Sir Peters
illusagesooner than your honourable Logic after all

SURFACE Then by this Hand which He is unworthy of

 Enter SERVANT

Sdeath you Blockheadwhat do you want

SERVANT I beg your Pardon Sir but I thought you wouldnt chuse Sir
Peter to come up without announcing him

SURFACE Sir PeterOonsthe Devil

since I fitted up this RoomBooks you know are the only Things I am a
Coxcomb in

SIR PETER Tis very neat indeedwell well thats properand you make
even your Screen a source of knowledgehung I perceive with Maps

SURFACE O yesI find great use in that Screen

SIR PETER I dare say you mustcertainlywhen you want to find out
anything in a Hurry

SURFACE Aye or to hide anything in a Hurry either

SIR PETER Well I have a little private Businessif we were alone

SURFACE You neednt stay

SERVANT NoSir

 Exit SERVANT

SURFACE Heres a ChairSir PeterI beg

SIR PETER Wellnow we are alonethere IS a subjectmy dear
Friendon which I wish to unburthen my Mind to youa Point of the
greatest moment to my Peacein short my good FriendLady Teazles
conduct of late has made me very unhappy

SURFACE Indeed Im very sorry to hear it

SIR PETER Yes tis but too plain she has not the least regard for
mebut whats worse I have pretty good Authority to suspect that she
must have formed an attachment to another

SURFACE Indeed you astonish me

SIR PETER Yesand between ourselvesI think I have discoverd the
Person

SURFACE Howyou alarm me exceedingly

SIR PETER Ah my dear Friend I knew you would sympathize with me

SURFACE Yesbelieve me Sir Petersuch a discovery would hurt me just
as much as it would you

SIR PETER I am convinced of itahit is a happiness to have a Friend
whom one can trust even with ones Family secretsbut have you no guess
who I mean

SURFACE I havent the most distant Ideait cant be Sir Benjamin
Backbite

SIR PETER ONo What say you to Charles

SURFACE My BrotherimpossibleO no Sir Peter you mustnt credit the
scandalous insinuations you hearno noCharles to be sure has been
charged with many things but go I can never think He would meditate so
gross an injury

SIR PETER Ah my dear Friendthe goodness of your own Heart misleads
youyou judge of others by yourself

SURFACE Certainly Sir Peterthe Heart that is conscious of its own
integrity is ever slowest to credit anothers Treachery

SIR PETER Truebut your Brother has no sentimentyou never hear him
talk so

SURFACE Well there certainly is no knowing what men are capable
ofnothere is no knowingyet I cant but think Lady Teazle herself
has too much Principle

SIR PETER Aye but whats Principle against the Flattery of a
handsomelively young Fellow

SURFACE Thats very true

SIR PETER And then you know the difference of our ages makes it very
improbable that she should have any great affection for meand if she
were to be frail and I were to make it Publicwhy the Town would only
laugh at the foolish old Batchelor who had married a girl

SURFACE Thats trueto be sure People would laugh

SIR PETER Laughaye and make Balladsand Paragraphs and the Devil
knows what of me

SURFACE Noyou must never make it public

SIR PETER But then again that the Nephew of my old Friend Sir
Oliver should be the Person to attempt such an injuryhurts me more
nearly

SURFACE Undoubtedlywhen Ingratitude barbs the Dart of Injurythe
wound has double danger in it

SIR PETER AyeI that was in a manner left his Guardianin his House
he had been so often entertaindwho never in my Life denied him my
advice

SURFACE O tis not to be creditedThere may be a man capable of such
Baseness to be surebut for my Part till you can give me positive
Proofs you must excuse me withholding my Belief However if this should
be proved on him He is no longer a brother of mine I disclaim kindred
with himfor the man who can break thro the Laws of Hospitalityand
attempt the wife of his Friend deserves to be branded as the Pest of
Society

SIR PETER What a difference there is between youwhat noble
sentiments

SURFACE But I cannot suspect Lady Teazles honor

SIR PETER Im sure I wish to think well of herand to remove all
ground of Quarrel between usShe has lately reproachd me more than
once with having made no settlement on herand in our last Quarrel
she almost hinted that she should not break her Heart if I was
deadnow as we seem to differ in our Ideas of Expense I have resolved
she shall be her own Mistress in that Respect for the futureand if
I were to dieshe shall find that I have not been inattentive to her
Interests while livingHere my Friend are the Draughts of two Deeds
which I wish to have your opinion onby one she will enjoy eight
hundred a year independent while I liveand by the other the bulk of my
Fortune after my Death

SURFACE This conduct Sir Peter is indeed truly Generous I wish it may
not corrupt my pupilAside

SIR PETER Yes I am determined she shall have no cause to complaintho
I would not have her acquainted with the latter instance of my affection
yet awhile

SURFACE Nor Iif I could help it

SIR PETER And now my dear Friend if you please we will talk over the
situation of your Hopes with Maria

SURFACE NonoSir Peteranother Time if you Pleasesoftly

SIR PETER I am sensibly chagrined at the little Progress you seem to
make in her affection

SURFACE I beg you will not mention itWhat are my Disappointments when
your Happiness is in Debate softly Sdeath I shall be ruined every
way

SIR PETER And tho you are so averse to my acquainting Lady Teazle with
YOUR passion I am sure shes not your Enemy in the Affair

SURFACE Pray Sir Peter now oblige meI am really too much affected
by the subject we have been speaking of to bestow a thought on my own
concernsThe Man who is entrusted with his Friends Distresses can
never

 Enter SERVANT

SCENE IThe Library

 Enter SURFACE and SERVANT

SURFACE Mr Stanley and why should you think I would see himyou
must know he came to ask something

SERVANT SirI shouldnt have let him in but that Mr Rowley came to
the Door with him

SURFACE PshawBlockhead to suppose that I should now be in a Temper
to receive visits from poor Relationswell why dont you show the
Fellow up

SERVANT I willSirWhy Sirit was not my Fault that Sir Peter
discoverd my Lady

SURFACE Go fool

 Exit SERVANT

Sure Fortune never playd a man of my policy such a Trick beforemy
character with Sir Petermy Hopes with Mariadestroyd in a
momentIm in a rare Humour to listen to other Peoples DistressesI
shant be able to bestow even a benevolent sentiment on StanleySo
hereHe comes and Rowley with himI MUST try to recover myself and
put a little Charity into my Face however

 Exit

 Enter SIR OLIVER and ROWLEY

SIR OLIVER What does He avoid us that was Hewas it not

ROWLEY It was Sirbut I doubt you are come a little too abruptlyhis
Nerves are so weak that the sight of a poor Relation may be too much for
himI should have gone first to break you to him

SIR OLIVER A Plague of his Nervesyet this is He whom Sir Peter
extolls as a Man of the most Benevolent way of thinking

ROWLEY As to his way of thinkingI cant pretend to decide for to
do him justice He appears to have as much speculative Benevolence as any
private Gentleman in the Kingdomthough he is seldom so sensual as to
indulge himself in the exercise of it

SIR OLIVER Yet he has a string of charitable Sentiments I suppose at
his Fingers ends

ROWLEY Or rather at his Tongues end Sir Oliver for I believe there
is no sentiment he has more faith in than that Charity begins at Home

SIR OLIVER And his I presume is of that domestic sort which never stirs
abroad at all

ROWLEY I doubt youll find it sobut Hes comingI mustnt seem to
interrupt youand you know immediatelyas you leave himI come in to
announceyour arrival in your real Character

SIR OLIVER Trueand afterwards youll meet me at Sir Peters

ROWLEY Without losing a moment

 Exit

SIR OLIVER SoI see he has premeditated a Denial by the Complaisance
of his Features

 Enter SURFACE

SURFACE SirI beg you ten thousand Pardons for keepingyou a moment
waitingMr StanleyI presume

SIR OLIVER At your Service

SURFACE SirI beg you will do me the honour to sit downI entreat you
Sir

SIR OLIVER Dear Sir theres no occasiontoo civil by half

SURFACE I have not the Pleasure of knowing you Mr Stanleybut I am
extremely happy to see you look so wellyou were nearly related to my
motherI think Mr Stanley

SIR OLIVER I was Sirso nearly that my present Poverty I fear may do
discredit to her Wealthy Childrenelse I should not have presumed to
trouble you

SURFACE Dear Sirthere needs no apologyHe that is in Distress tho a
stranger has a right to claim kindred with the wealthyI am sure I wish
I was of that class and had it in my power to offer you even a small
relief

SIR OLIVER If your Unkle Sir Oliver were hereI should have a
Friend

SURFACE I wish He was Sir with all my Heartyou should not want an
advocate with himbelieve me Sir

SIR OLIVER I should not need onemy Distresses would recommend
mebut I imaginedhis Bounty had enabled you to become the agent of
his Charity

SURFACE My dear Siryou are strangely misinformedSir Oliver is a
worthy Man a worthy mana very worthy sort of Manbut avarice
Mr Stanley is the vice of ageI will tell you my good Sir in
confidencewhat he has done for me has been a merenothing tho
People I know have thought otherwise and for my Part I never chose to
contradict the Report

SIR OLIVER Whathas he never

indian Crackers

SURFACE Then my dearSiryou have heard I doubt not of the
extravagance of my BrotherSirthere are very few would credit what I

SURFACE The sums I have lent him indeedI have been exceedingly to
blameit was an amiable weakness however I dont pretend to defend
itand now I feel it doubly culpablesince it has deprived me of the
power of serving YOU Mr Stanley as my Heart directs

SIR OLIVER Dissembler Then Siryou cannot assist me

SURFACE At Present it grieves me to say I cannotbut whenever I have
the ability you may depend upon hearing from me

SIR OLIVER I am extremely sorry

SURFACE Not more than I am believe meto pity without the Power to
relieve is still more painful than to ask and be denied

SIR OLIVER Kind Siryour most obedient humble servant

open the door

SURFACE You may depend on hearing from me whenever I can be of

SURFACE In the mean time I wish you Health and Spirits

SIR OLIVER Your ever grateful and perpetual humble Servant

SURFACE Siryours as sincerely

SIR OLIVER Charlesyou are my Heir

 Exit

SURFACE solus SohThis is one bad effect of a good Characterit
invites applications from the unfortunate and there needs no small
degree of address to gain the reputation of Benevolence without
incurring the expenceThe silver ore of pure Charity is an expensive
article in the catalogue of a mans good Qualitieswhereas the
sentimental French Plate I use instead of it makes just as good a
shewand pays no tax

 Enter ROWLEY

accountshowever you agree that Sir Peter is dangerously wounded

SIR PETER Sir what Business is that of yours

MRS CANDOUR Tho Indeed as Sir Peter made so good a Husband hes
very much to be pitied

SIR PETER Plague on your pity Maam I desire none of it

SIR BENJAMIN However Sir Peter you must not mind the Laughing and

SIR PETER A Precious Couple they are

ROWLEY Yes and Sir Oliveris convinced that your judgment was right
Sir Peter

SIR OLIVER Yes I find Joseph is Indeed the Man after all

ROWLEY Aye as Sir Peter says Hes a man of Sentiment

SIR OLIVER And acts up to the Sentiments he professes

ROWLEY It certainly is Edification to hear him talk

SIR OLIVER Oh Hes a model for the young men of the age But hows
this Sir Peter you dont Join us in your Friend Josephs Praise as I
expected

SIR PETER Sir Oliver we live in a damned wicked world and the fewer
we praise the better

ROWLEY What do YOU say so Sir Peterwho were never mistaken in your
Life

SIR PETER PshawPlague on you bothI see by your sneering you have
heardthe whole affairI shall go mad among you

ROWLEY Then to fret you no longer Sir Peterwe are indeed acquainted

that she deigned to request ME to be her advocate with you

SIR PETER And does Sir Oliver know all too

SIR OLIVER Every circumstance

SIR PETER What of the closet and the screenhey

SIR OLIVER Yes yesand the little French Milliner Oh I have been
vastly diverted with the story ha ha ha

situationO yesand then of a morning to read the Paragraphs about
Mr S Lady T and Sir P will be so entertainingI shall
certainly leave town tomorrow and never look mankind in the Face again

ROWLEY Without affectation Sir Peter you may despise the ridicule of
Foolsbut I see Lady Teazle going towards the next RoomI am sure you
must desire a Reconciliation as earnestly as she does

SIR OLIVER Perhaps MY being here prevents her coming to youwell Ill
leave honest Rowley to mediate between you but he must bring you all
presently to Mr Surfaceswhere I am now returningif not to reclaim
a Libertine at least to expose Hypocrisy

SIR PETER Ah Ill be present at your discovering yourself there with
all my heart though tis a vile unlucky Place for discoveries

SIR OLIVER However it is very convenient to the carrying on of my Plot
that you all live so near one another

 Exit SIR OLIVER

ROWLEY Well follow

SIR PETER She is not coming here you see Rowley

ROWLEY No but she has left the Door of that Room open you
perceivesee she is in Tears

SIR PETER She seems indeed to wish I should go to herhow dejected
she appears

ROWLEY And will you refrain from comforting her

SIR PETER Certainly a little mortification appears very becoming in a
wifedont you think it will do her good to let her Pine a little

ROWLEY O this is ungenerous in you

SIR PETER Well I know not what to thinkyou remember Rowley the Letter
I found of hersevidently intended for Charles

ROWLEY A mere forgery Sir Peterlaid in your way on Purposethis is
one of the Points which I intend Snake shall give you conviction on

SIR PETER I wish I were once satisfied of thatShe looks this
waywhat a remarkably elegant Turn of the Head she has Rowley Ill
go to her

ROWLEY Certainly

SIR PETER Tho when it is known that we are reconciled People will
laugh at me ten times more

ROWLEY Letthem laughand retort their malice only by showing them
you are happy in spite of it

SIR PETER Efaith so I willand if Im not mistaken we may yet be the
happiest couple in the country

ROWLEY Nay Sir PeterHe who once lays aside suspicion

SIR PETER Hold Master Rowleyif you have any Regard for menever let
me hear you utter anything like a Sentiment I have had enough of THEM
to serve me the rest of my Life

 Exeunt




SCENE THE LASTThe Library

 SURFACE and LADY SNEERWELL

LADY SNEERWELL Impossible will not Sir Peter immediately be reconciled
to CHARLES and of consequence no longer oppose his union with MARIA

SURFACE Can Passionfurnish a Remedy

LADY SNEERWELL Nonor cunning either O I was a Fool an Ideotto
league with such a Blunderer

SURFACE Surely Lady Sneerwell I am the greatest Suffereryet you see I
bear the accident with Calmness

LADY SNEERWELL Because the Disappointment hasnt reached your
HEARTyour interest only attached you to Mariahad you felt for
herwhat I have for that ungrateful Libertineneither your Temper nor
Hypocrisy could prevent your showing the sharpness of your Vexation

SURFACE But why should your Reproaches fall on me for this
Disappointment

LADY SNEERWELL Are not you the cause of it what had you to bate in
your Pursuit of Maria to pervert Lady Teazle by the wayhad you not a
sufficient field for your Roguery in blinding Sir Peter and supplanting
your BrotherI hate such an avarice of crimestis an unfair monopoly
and never prospers

SURFACE Well I admit I have been to blameI confess I deviated from
the direct Road of wrong but I dont think were so totally defeated
neither

LADY SNEERWELL No

SURFACE You tell me you have made a trial of Snake since we metand
that you still believe him faithful to us

LADY SNEERWELL I do believe so

SURFACE And that he has undertaken should it be necessaryto swear and
prove that Charles is at this Time contracted by vows and Honour to
your Ladyshipwhich some of his former letters to you will serve to
support

LADY SNEERWELL This indeed might have assisted

SURFACE Comecome it is not too late yetbut hark this is probably
my Unkle Sir Oliverretire to that Roomwell consult further when
Hes gone

LADY SNEERWELL Well but if HE should find you out to

SURFACE O I have no fear of thatSir Peter will hold his tongue for

Olivers weak side

ROWLEY Truly it wasfor I perceive Sir Oliver the character of old

not extort a shilling from that benevolent Gentleman and with the other
I stood a chance of faring worse than my Ancestors and being knocked
down without being bid for

SURFACE Charles

CHARLES Joseph

SURFACE Tis compleat

CHARLES Very

SIR OLIVER Sir Petermy Friend and Rowley toolook on that elder
Nephew of mineYou know what He has already received from my Bounty and
you know also how gladly I would have lookd on half my Fortune as held

destitute of TruthCharityand Gratitude

SIR PETER Sir OliverI should be more surprized at this Declaration
if I had not myself found him to be selfishtreacherous and
Hypocritical

LADY TEAZLE And if the Gentleman pleads not guilty to these pray let
him call ME to his Character

SIR PETER Then I believe we need add no moreif He knows himself He
will consider it as the most perfect Punishment that He is known to the
world

CHARLES If they talk this way to Honestywhat will they say to ME by
and bye

SIR OLIVER As for that Prodigalhis Brother there

CHARLES Aye now comes my Turnthe damnd Family Pictures will ruin
me

SURFACE Sir OliverUnklewill you honour me with a hearing

entirely

SURFACE I trust I could

SIR OLIVER Nayif you desert your Roguery in its Distress and try to
be justifiedyou have even less principle than I thought you hadTo
CHARLES SURFACE Well Sirand YOU could JUSTIFY yourself too I

I presume

mentioned again you know

ROWLEY Come Sir Oliver I know you cannot speak of Charless Follies
with anger

SIR OLIVER Odds heart no more I cannor with gravity eitherSir
Peter do you know the Rogue bargaind with me for all his
Ancestorssold me judges and Generals by the Foot and Maiden Aunts as
cheap as broken China

CHARLES To be sure Sir Oliver I did make a little free with the
Family Canvas thats the truth ontmy Ancestors may certainly rise in
judgment against me theres no denying itbut believe me sincere when I
tell you and upon my soul I would not say so if I was notthat if I do
not appear mortified at the exposure of my Follies it is because I
feel at this moment the warmest satisfaction in seeing you my liberal
benefactor

SIR OLIVER CharlesI believe yougive me your hand again the
illlooking little fellow over the Couch has made your Peace

CHARLES Then Sirmy Gratitude to the original is still encreased

LADY TEAZLE Advancing Yet I believe Sir Oliver here is one whom
Charles is still more anxious to be reconciled to

SIR OLIVER O I have heard of his Attachment thereand with the young
Ladys Pardon if I construe right that Blush

SIR PETER WellChildspeak your sentimentsyou knowwe are going to
be reconciled to Charles

MARIA SirI have little to saybut that I shall rejoice to hear that

incorrigible Rake you would give your hand to no one else and now that
Hes likely to reform Ill warrant You wont have him

this Point but my Regard to justice obliges meand Lady Sneerwells
injuries can no longerbe concealedGoes to the Door

 Enter LADY SNEERWELL

SIR PETER Soh another French milliner egad He has one in every Room
in the House I suppose

LADY SNEERWELL Ungrateful Charles Well may you be surprised and feel
for the indelicate situation which your Perfidy has forced me into

CHARLES Pray Unkle is this another Plot of yours for as I have Life I
dont understand it

SURFACE I believe Sir there is but the evidence of one Person more
necessary to make it extremely clear

SIR PETER And that PersonI imagine is Mr SnakeRowleyyou were
perfectly right to bring him with usand pray let him appear

ROWLEY Walk in Mr Snake

 Enter SNAKE

I thought his Testimony might be wantedhowever it happens unluckily
that He comes to confront Lady Sneerwell and not to support her

LADY SNEERWELL A VillainTreacherous to me at last Speak Fellow

SNAKE I beg your Ladyshipten thousand Pardonsyou paid me extremely
Liberally for the Lie in questionbut I unfortunately have been offerd

SIR PETER Oons what a Fury

LADY TEAZLE A malicious Creature indeed

SIR PETER Heynot for her last wish

LADY TEAZLE O No

SIR OLIVER Well Sir and what have you to say now

SURFACE Sir I am so confounded to find that Lady Sneerwell could be
guilty of suborning Mr Snake in this manner to impose on us all that
I know not what to sayhowever lest her Revengeful Spirit should
prompt her to injure my Brother I had certainly better follow her
directly

 Exit

SIR PETER Moral to the last drop

SIR OLIVER Aye and marry her Joseph if you canOil and Vinegar

SNAKE Before I goI beg Pardon once for all for whatever uneasiness I

thing once in your life

CHARLES Why as to reforming Sir Peter Ill make no promisesand that
I take to be a proof that I intend to set about itBut here shall be my
Monitormy gentle Guideah can I leave the Virtuous path those Eyes
illumine

 Tho thou dear Maid shouldst wave waive thy Beautys Sway
 Thou still must Rulebecause I will obey
 An humbled fugitive from Folly View
 No sanctuary near but Love and YOU
 You can indeed each anxious Fear remove
 For even Scandal dies if you approve To the audience

 EPILOGUE

 BY MR COLMAN

 SPOKEN BY LADY TEAZLE

 I who was late so volatile and gay
 Like a tradewind must now blow all one way
 Bend all my cares my studies and my vows
 To one dull rusty weathercockmy spouse
 So wills our virtuous bardthe motley Bayes
 Of crying epilogues and laughing plays
 Old bachelors who marry smart young wives
 Learn from our play to regulate your lives
 Each bring his dear to town all faults upon her
 London will prove the very source of honour
 Plunged fairly in like a cold bath it serves
 When principles relax to brace the nerves
 Such is my case and yet I must deplore
 That the gay dream of dissipations oer
 And say ye fair was ever lively wife
 Born with a genius for the highest life
 Like me untimely blasted in her bloom
 Like me condemnd to such a dismal doom
 Save moneywhen I just knew how to waste it
 Leave Londonjust as I began to taste it
 Must I then watch the early crowing cock
 The melancholy ticking of a clock
 In a lone rustic hall for ever pounded
 With dogs cats rats and squalling brats surrounded
 With humble curate can I now retire
 While good Sir Peter boozes with the squire
 And at backgammon mortify my soul
 That pants for loo or flutters at a vole
 Sevens the main Dear sound that must expire
 Lost at hot cockles round a Christmas fire
 The transient hour of fashion too soon spent
 Farewell the tranquil mind farewell content
 Farewell the plumed head the cushiond tete
 That takes the cushion from its proper seat
 That spiritstirring drumcard drums I mean
 Spadilleodd trickpambastoking and queen
 And you ye knockers that with brazen throat
 The welcome visitors approach denote
 Farewell all quality of high renown
 Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious town
 Farewell your revels I partake no more
 And Lady Teazles occupations oer
 All this I told our bard he smiled and said twas clear
 I ought to play deep tragedy next year
 Meanwhile he drew wise morals from his play
 And in these solemn periods stalkd away
 Blessd were the fair like you her faults who stoppd
 And closed her follies when the curtain droppd
 No more in vice or error to engage
 Or play the fool at large on lifes great stage

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 wwwgutenbergorg

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
