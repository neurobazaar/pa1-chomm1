CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS

A STORY OF THE GRAND BANKS


by

Rudyard Kipling




 TO
 JAMES CONLAND MD
 Brattleboro Vermont


 I ploughed the land with horses
 But my heart was ill at ease
 For the old seafaring men
 Came to me now and then
 With their sagas of the seas

 Longfellow




CHAPTER I

The weather door of the smokingroom had been left open to the North
Atlantic fog as the big liner rolled and lifted whistling to warn the
fishingfleet

That Cheyne boys the biggest nuisance aboard said a man in a frieze
overcoat shutting the door with a bang He isnt wanted here Hes
too fresh

A whitehaired German reached for a sandwich and grunted between
bites I know der breed Ameriga is full of dot kind I dell you you
should imbort ropes ends free under your dariff

Pshaw There isnt any real harm to him Hes more to be pitied than
anything a man from New York drawled as he lay at full length along
the cushions under the wet skylight Theyve dragged him around from
hotel to hotel ever since he was a kid I was talking to his mother
this morning Shes a lovely lady but she dont pretend to manage him
Hes going to Europe to finish his education

Education isnt begun yet This was a Philadelphian curled up in a
corner That boy gets two hundred a month pocketmoney he told me He
isnt sixteen either

Railroads his father aindt it said the German

Yep That and mines and lumber and shipping Built one place at San
Diego the old man has another at Los Angeles owns half a dozen
railroads half the lumber on the Pacific slope and lets his wife
spend the money the Philadelphian went on lazily The West dont
suit her she says She just tracks around with the boy and her nerves
trying to find out whatll amuse him I guess Florida Adirondacks
Lakewood Hot Springs New York and round again He isnt much more
than a secondhand hotel clerk now When hes finished in Europe hell
be a holy terror

Whats the matter with the old man attending to him personally said
a voice from the frieze ulster

Old mans piling up the rocks Dont want to be disturbed I guess
Hell find out his error a few years from now Pity because theres a
heap of good in the boy if you could get at it

Mit a ropes end mit a ropes end growled the German

Once more the door banged and a slight slimbuilt boy perhaps fifteen
years old a halfsmoked cigarette hanging from one corner of his
mouth leaned in over the high footway His pasty yellow complexion did
not show well on a person of his years and his look was a mixture of
irresolution bravado and very cheap smartness He was dressed in a
cherrycoloured blazer knickerbockers red stockings and bicycle
shoes with a red flannel cap at the back of the head After whistling
between his teeth as he eyed the company he said in a loud high
voice Say its thick outside You can hear the fishboats squawking
all around us Say wouldnt it be great if we ran down one

Shut the door Harvey said the New Yorker Shut the door and stay
outside Youre not wanted here

Wholl stop me he answered deliberately Did you pay for my
passage Mister Martin Guess Ive as good right here as the next man

He picked up some dice from a checkerboard and began throwing right
hand against left

Say genelmen this is deadern mud Cant we make a game of poker
between us

There was no answer and he puffed his cigarette swung his legs and
drummed on the table with rather dirty fingers Then he pulled out a
roll of bills as if to count them

Hows your mamma this afternoon a man said I didnt see her at
lunch

In her stateroom I guess Shes most always sick on the ocean Im
going to give the stewardess fifteen dollars for looking after her I
dont go down more n I can avoid It makes me feel mysterious to pass
that butlerspantry place Say this is the first time Ive been on
the ocean

Oh dont apologize Harvey

Whos apologizing This is the first time Ive crossed the ocean
genelmen and except the first day I havent been sick one little
bit No sir He brought down his fist with a triumphant bang wetted
his finger and went on counting the bills

Oh youre a highgrade machine with the writing in plain sight the
Philadelphian yawned Youll blossom into a credit to your country if
you dont take care

I know it Im an Americanfirst last and all the time Ill show
em that when I strike Europe Piff My cigs out I cant smoke the
truck the steward sells Any genelman got a real Turkish cig on him

The chief engineer entered for a moment red smiling and wet Say
Mac cried Harvey cheerfully how are we hitting it

Vara much in the ordinary way was the grave reply The young are as
polite as ever to their elders an their elders are een tryin to
appreciate it

A low chuckle came from a corner The German opened his cigarcase and
handed a skinny black cigar to Harvey

Dot is der broper apparatus to smoke my young friendt he said You
vill dry it Yes Den you vill be efer so happy

Harvey lit the unlovely thing with a flourish he felt that he was
getting on in grownup society

It would take more n this to keel me over he said ignorant that he
was lighting that terrible article a Wheeling stogie

Dot we shall bresently see said the German Where are we now Mr
Mactonal

Just there or thereabouts Mr Schaefer said the engineer Well be
on the Grand Bank tonight but in a general way o speakin were all
among the fishingfleet now Weve shaved three dories an near scalped
the boom off a Frenchman since noon an thats close sailing ye may
say

You like my cigar eh the German asked for Harveys eyes were full
of tears

Fine full flavor he answered through shut teeth Guess weve
slowed down a little havent we Ill skip out and see what the log
says

I might if I vhas you said the German

Harvey staggered over the wet decks to the nearest rail He was very
unhappy but he saw the decksteward lashing chairs together and
since he had boasted before the man that he was never seasick his
pride made him go aft to the secondsaloon deck at the stern which was
finished in a turtleback The deck was deserted and he crawled to the
extreme end of it near the flagpole There he doubled up in limp
agony for the Wheeling stogie joined with the surge and jar of the
screw to sieve out his soul His head swelled sparks of fire danced
before his eyes his body seemed to lose weight while his heels
wavered in the breeze He was fainting from seasickness and a roll of
the ship tilted him over the rail on to the smooth lip of the
turtleback Then a low gray motherwave swung out of the fog tucked
Harvey under one arm so to speak and pulled him off and away to
leeward the great green closed over him and he went quietly to sleep

He was roused by the sound of a dinnerhorn such as they used to blow
at a summerschool he had once attended in the Adirondacks Slowly he
remembered that he was Harvey Cheyne drowned and dead in midocean
but was too weak to fit things together A new smell filled his
nostrils wet and clammy chills ran down his back and he was
helplessly full of salt water When he opened his eyes he perceived
that he was still on the top of the sea for it was running round him
in silvercoloured hills and he was lying on a pile of halfdead fish
looking at a broad human back clothed in a blue jersey

Its no good thought the boy Im dead sure enough and this thing
is in charge

He groaned and the figure turned its head showing a pair of little
gold rings half hidden in curly black hair

Aha You feel some pretty well now it said Lie still so we trim
better

With a swift jerk he sculled the flickering boathead on to a foamless
sea that lifted her twenty full feet only to slide her into a glassy
pit beyond But this mountainclimbing did not interrupt bluejerseys
talk Fine good job I say that I catch you Eh whaat Better good
job I say your boat not catch me How you come to fall out

I was sick said Harvey sick and couldnt help it

Just in time I blow my horn and your boat she yaw a little Then I
see you come all down Eh whaat I think you are cut into baits by
the screw but you dreeftdreeft to me and I make a big fish of you
So you shall not die this time

Where am I said Harvey who could not see that life was particularly
safe where he lay

You are with me in the doryManuel my name and I come from schooner
_Were Here_ of Gloucester I live to Gloucester Byandby we get
supper Eh whaat

He seemed to have two pairs of hands and a head of castiron for not
content with blowing through a big conchshell he must needs stand up
to it swaying with the sway of the flatbottomed dory and send a
grinding thuttering shriek through the fog How long this
entertainment lasted Harvey could not remember for he lay back
terrified at the sight of the smoking swells He fancied he heard a gun
and a horn and shouting Something bigger than the dory but quite as
lively loomed alongside Several voices talked at once he was dropped
into a dark heaving hole where men in oilskins gave him a hot drink
and took off his clothes and he fell asleep

When he waked he listened for the first breakfastbell on the steamer
wondering why his stateroom had grown so small Turning he looked
into a narrow triangular cave lit by a lamp hung against a huge
square beam A threecornered table within arms reach ran from the
angle of the bows to the foremast At the after end behind a wellused
Plymouth stove sat a boy about his own age with a flat red face and a
pair of twinkling gray eyes He was dressed in a blue jersey and high
rubber boots Several pairs of the same sort of footwear an old cap
and some wornout woollen socks lay on the floor and black and yellow
oilskins swayed to and fro beside the bunks The place was packed as
full of smells as a bale is of cotton The oilskins had a peculiarly
thick flavor of their own which made a sort of background to the smells
of fried fish burnt grease paint pepper and stale tobacco but
these again were all hooped together by one encircling smell of ship
and salt water Harvey saw with disgust that there were no sheets on
his bedplace He was lying on a piece of dingy ticking full of lumps
and nubbles Then too the boats motion was not that of a steamer
She was neither sliding nor rolling but rather wriggling herself about
in a silly aimless way like a colt at the end of a halter
Waternoises ran by close to his ear and beams creaked and whined
about him All these things made him grunt despairingly and think of
his mother

Feelin better said the boy with a grin Hev some coffee He
brought a tin cup full and sweetened it with molasses

Isnt there milk said Harvey looking round the dark double tier of
bunks as if he expected to find a cow there

Well no said the boy Ner there aint likely to be till baout
midSeptember Taint bad coffee I made it

Harvey drank in silence and the boy handed him a plate full of pieces
of crisp fried pork which he ate ravenously

Ive dried your clothes Guess theyve shrunk some said the boy
They aint our style muchnone of em Twist round an see if youre
hurt any

Harvey stretched himself in every direction but could not report any
injuries

Thats good the boy said heartily Fix yerself an go on deck Dad
wants to see you Im his sonDan they call mean Im cooks
helper an everything else aboard thats too dirty for the men There
aint no boy here cep me sence Otto went overboardan he was only a
Dutchy an twenty year old at that Howd you come to fall off in a
dead flat caam

Twasnt a calm said Harvey sulkily It was a gale and I was
seasick Guess I must have rolled over the rail

There was a little common swell yesday an last night said the boy
But ef thets your notion of a gale He whistled Youll know
more fore youre through Hurry Dads waitin

Like many other unfortunate young people Harvey had never in all his
life received a direct ordernever at least without long and
sometimes tearful explanations of the advantages of obedience and the
reasons for the request Mrs Cheyne lived in fear of breaking his
spirit which perhaps was the reason that she herself walked on the
edge of nervous prostration He could not see why he should be expected
to hurry for any mans pleasure and said so Your dad can come down
here if hes so anxious to talk to me I want him to take me to New
York right away Itll pay him

Dan opened his eyes as the size and beauty of this joke dawned on him
Say Dad he shouted up the focsle hatch he says you kin slip down
an see him ef youre anxious that way Hear Dad

The answer came back in the deepest voice Harvey had ever heard from a
human chest Quit foolin Dan and send him to me

Dan sniggered and threw Harvey his warped bicycle shoes There was
something in the tones on the deck that made the boy dissemble his
extreme rage and console himself with the thought of gradually
unfolding the tale of his own and his fathers wealth on the voyage
home This rescue would certainly make him a hero among his friends for
life He hoisted himself on deck up a perpendicular ladder and
stumbled aft over a score of obstructions to where a small
thickset cleanshaven man with gray eyebrows sat on a step that led
up to the quarterdeck The swell had passed in the night leaving a
long oily sea dotted round the horizon with the sails of a dozen
fishingboats Between them lay little black specks showing where the
dories were out fishing The schooner with a triangular ridingsail on
the mainmast played easily at anchor and except for the man by the
cabinroofhouse they call itshe was deserted

MorninGood afternoon I should say Youve nigh slep the clock
round young feller was the greeting

Mornin said Harvey He did not like being called young feller
and as one rescued from drowning expected sympathy His mother
suffered agonies whenever he got his feet wet but this mariner did not
seem excited

Naow lets hear all abaout it Its quite providential first an
last fer all concerned What might be your name Where from we
mistrust its Noo York an where baound we mistrust its Europe

Harvey gave his name the name of the steamer and a short history of
the accident winding up with a demand to be taken back immediately to
New York where his father would pay anything any one chose to name

Hm said the shaven man quite unmoved by the end of Harveys
speech I cant say we think special of any man or boy even that
falls overboard from that kind o packet in a flat caam Least of all
when his excuse is that hes seasick

Excuse cried Harvey Dyou suppose Id fall overboard into your
dirty little boat for fun

Not knowin what your notions o fun may be I cant rightly say
young feller But if I was you I wouldnt call the boat which under
Providence was the means o savin ye names In the first place its
blame irreligious In the second its annoyin to my feelinsan Im
Disko Troop o the _Were Here_ o Gloucester which you dont seem
rightly to know

I dont know and I dont care said Harvey Im grateful enough for
being saved and all that of course but I want you to understand that
the sooner you take me back to New York the better itll pay you

Meaninhaow Troop raised one shaggy eyebrow over a suspiciously
mild blue eye

Dollars and cents said Harvey delighted to think that he was making
an impression Cold dollars and cents He thrust a hand into a
pocket and threw out his stomach a little which was his way of being
grand Youve done the best days work you ever did in your life when
you pulled me in Im all the son Harvey Cheyne has

Hes bin favoured said Disko dryly

And if you dont know who Harvey Cheyne is you dont know
muchthats all Now turn her around and lets hurry

Harvey had a notion that the greater part of America was filled with
people discussing and envying his fathers dollars

Mebbe I do an mebbe I dont Take a reef in your stummick young
feller Its full o my vittles

Harvey heard a chuckle from Dan who was pretending to be busy by the
stumpforemast and blood rushed to his face Well pay for that too
he said When do you suppose we shall get to New York

I dont use Noo York any Ner Boston We may see Eastern Point about
September an your paIm real sorry I haint heerd tell of himmay
give me ten dollars efter all your talk Then o course he maynt

Ten dollars Why see here I Harvey dived into his pocket for the
wad of bills All he brought up was a soggy packet of cigarettes

Not lawful currency an bad for the lungs Heave em overboard young
feller and try agin

Its been stolen cried Harvey hotly

Youll hev to wait till you see your pa to reward me then

A hundred and thirtyfour dollarsall stolen said Harvey hunting
wildly through his pockets Give them back

A curious change flitted across old Troops hard face What might you
have been doin at your time o life with one hundred an thirtyfour
dollars young feller

It was part of my pocketmoneyfor a month This Harvey thought
would be a knockdown blow and it wasindirectly

Oh One hundred and thirtyfour dollars is only part of his
pocketmoneyfor one month only You dont remember hittin anything
when you fell over do you Crack agin a stanchion les say Old man
Hasken o the East WindTroop seemed to be talking to himselfhe
tripped on a hatch an butted the mainmast with his headhardish
Baout three weeks afterwards old man Hasken he would hev it that the
East Wind was a commercedestroyin manowar an so he declared
war on Sable Island because it was Bridish an the shoals run aout too
far They sewed him up in a bedbag his head an feet appearin fer
the rest o the trip an now hes to home in Essex playin with little
rag dolls

Harvey choked with rage but Troop went on consolingly Were sorry
fer you Were very sorry fer youan so young We wont say no more
abaout the money I guess

Course you wont You stole it

Suit yourself We stole it ef its any comfort to you Naow abaout
goin back Allowin we could do it which we cant you aint in no
fit state to go back to your home an weve jest come on to the Banks
workin fer our bread We dont see the haaf of a hundred dollars a
month let alone pocketmoney an with good luck well be ashore again
somewheres abaout the first weeks o September

Butbut its May now and I cant stay here doin nothing just
because you want to fish I cant I tell you

Right an jest jest an right No one asks you to do nothin Theres
a heap as you can do for Otto he went overboard on Le Have I mistrust
he lost his grip in a gale we fund there Anyways he never come back
to deny it Youve turned up plain plumb providential for all
concerned I mistrust though theres ruther few things you kin do
Aint thet so

I can make it lively for you and your crowd when we get ashore said
Harvey with a vicious nod murmuring vague threats about piracy at
which Troop almostnot quitesmiled

Excep talk Id forgot that You aint asked to talk moren youve a
mind to aboard the _Were Here_ Keep your eyes open an help Dan to
do ez hes bid an sechlike an Ill give youyou aint wuth it but
Ill giveten an a haaf a month say thirtyfive at the end o the
trip A little work will ease up your head and you kin tell us all
abaout your dad an your ma an your money afterwards

Shes on the steamer said Harvey his eyes filling with tears Take
me to New York at once

Poor womanpoor woman When she has you back shell forgit it all
though Theres eight of us on the _Were Here_ an ef we went back
naowits moren a thousand milewed lose the season The men they
wouldnt hev it allowin I was agreeable

But my father would make it all right

Hed try I dont doubt hed try said Troop but a whole seasons
catch is eight mens bread an youll be better in your health when
you see him in the fall Go forward an help Dan Its ten an a haaf
a month e I said an o course all fund same e the rest o us

Do you mean Im to clean pots and pans and things said Harvey

An other things Youve no call to shout young feller

I wont My father will give you enough to buy this dirty little
fishkettleHarvey stamped on the deckten times over if you take
me to New York safe andandyoure in a hundred and thirty by me
anyhow

Haow said Troop the iron face darkening

How You know how well enough On top of all that you want me to do
menial workHarvey was very proud of that adjectivetill the Fall
I tell you I will not You hear

Troop regarded the top of the mainmast with deep interest for a while
as Harvey harangued fiercely all around him

Hsh he said at last Im figurin out my responsibilities in my own
mind Its a matter o jedgment

Dan stole up and plucked Harvey by the elbow Dont go to tamperin
with Dad any more he pleaded Youve called him a thief two or three
times over an he dont take that from any livin bein

I wont Harvey almost shrieked disregarding the advice and still
Troop meditated

Seems kinder unneighbourly he said at last his eye travelling down
to Harvey Idont blame you not a mite young feeler nor you wont
blame me when the biles out o your systim Be sure you sense what I
say Ten an a haaf fer second boy on the schooneran all foundfer
to teach you an fer the sake o your health Yes or no

No said Harvey Take me back to New York or Ill see you

He did not exactly remember what followed He was lying in the
scuppers holding on to a nose that bled while Troop looked down on him
serenely

Dan he said to his son I was sot agin this young feeler when I
first saw him on account o hasty jedgments Never you be led astray by
hasty jedgments Dan Naow Im sorry for him because hes clear
distracted in his upper works He aint responsible fer the names hes
give me nor fer his other statementsnor fer jumpin overboard which
Im abaout haaf convinced he did You be gentle with him Dan r Ill
give you twice what Ive give him Them hemmeridges clears the head
Let him sluice it off

Troop went down solemnly into the cabin where he and the older men
bunked leaving Dan to comfort the luckless heir to thirty millions



CHAPTER II

I warned ye said Dan as the drops fell thick and fast on the dark
oiled planking Dad aint noways hasty but you fair earned it Pshaw
theres no sense takin on so Harveys shoulders were rising and
falling in spasms of dry sobbing I know the feelin First time Dad
laid me out was the lastand that was my first trip Makes ye feel
sickish an lonesome I know

It does moaned Harvey That mans either crazy or drunk andand I
cant do anything

Dont say that to Dad whispered Dan Hes set agin all liquor
anwell he told me you was the madman What in creation made you
call him a thief Hes my dad

Harvey sat up mopped his nose and told the story of the missing wad
of bills Im not crazy he wound up Onlyyour father has never
seen more than a fivedollar bill at a time and my father could buy up
this boat once a week and never miss it

You dont know what the _Were Heres_ worth Your dad must hev a pile
o money How did he git it Dad sez loonies cant shake out a straight
yarn Go ahead

In gold mines and things West

Ive read o that kind o business Out West too Does he go around
with a pistol on a trickpony same ez the circus They call that the
Wild West and Ive heard that their spurs an bridles was solid
silver

You are a chump said Harvey amused in spite of himself My father
hasnt any use for ponies When he wants to ride he takes his car

Haow Lobstercar

No His own private car of course Youve seen a private car some
time in your life

Slatin Beeman he hez one said Dan cautiously I saw her at the
Union Depot in Boston with three niggers hoggin her run Dan meant
cleaning the windows But Slatin Beeman he owns baout every railroad
on Long Island they say an they say hes bought baout haaf Noo
Hampshire an run a line fence around her an filled her up with lions
an tigers an bears an buffalo an crocodiles an such all Slatin
Beeman hes a millionaire Ive seen his car Yes

Well my fathers what they call a multimillionaire and he has two
private cars Ones named for me the Harvey and one for my mother
the Constance

Hold on said Dan Dad dont ever let me swear but I guess you can
Fore we go ahead I want you to say hope you may die if youre lyin

Of course said Harvey

The aint niff Say Hope I may die if I aint speaking truth

Hope I may die right here said Harvey if every word Ive spoken
isnt the cold truth

Hundred an thirtyfour dollars an all said Dan I heard ye
talkin to Dad an I haaf looked youd be swallered up sames Jonah

Harvey protested himself red in the face Dan was a shrewd young person
along his own lines and ten minutes questioning convinced him that
Harvey was not lyingmuch Besides he had bound himself by the most
terrible oath known to boyhood and yet he sat alive with a redended
nose in the scuppers recounting marvels upon marvels

Gosh said Dan at last from the very bottom of his soul when Harvey
had completed an inventory of the car named in his honour Then a grin
of mischievous delight overspread his broad face I believe you
Harvey Dads made a mistake fer once in his life

He has sure said Harvey who was meditating an early revenge

Hell be mad clear through Dad jest hates to be mistook in his
jedgments Dan lay back and slapped his thigh Oh Harvey dont you
spile the catch by lettin on

I dont want to be knocked down again Ill get even with him though

Never heard any man ever got even with dad But hed knock ye down
again sure The more he was mistook the more hed do it But goldmines
and pistols

I never said a word about pistols Harvey cut in for he was on his
oath

Thets so no more you did Two private cars then one named fer you
an one fer her an two hundred dollars a month pocketmoney all
knocked into the scuppers fer not workin fer ten an a haaf a month
Its the top haul o the season He exploded with noiseless chuckles

Then I was right said Harvey who thought he had found a sympathiser

You was wrong the wrongest kind o wrong You take right hold an
pitch in longside o me or youll catch it an Ill catch it fer
backin you up Dad always gives me double helps cause Im his son
an he hates favourin folk Guess youre kinder mad at dad Ive been
that way time an again But dads a mighty jest man all the fleet
says so

Looks like justice this dont it Harvey pointed to his outraged
nose

Thets nothin Lets the shore blood outer you Dad did it for yer
health Say though I cant have dealins with a man that thinks me or
dad or any one on the _Were Heres_ a thief We aint any common
wharfend crowd by any manner o means Were fishermen an weve
shipped together for six years an more Dont you make any mistake on
that I told ye dad dont let me swear He calls em vain oaths and
pounds me but ef I could say what you said baout your pap an his
fixins Id say that baout your dollars I dunno what was in your
pockets when I dried your kit fer I didnt look to see but Id say
using the very same words ez you used jest now neither me nor dadan
we was the only two that teched you after you was brought aboardknows
anythin baout the money Thets my say Naow

The bloodletting had certainly cleared Harveys brain and maybe the
loneliness of the sea had something to do with it Thats all right
he said Then he looked down confusedly Seems to me that for a
fellow just saved from drowning I havent been over and above grateful
Dan

Well you was shook up and silly said Dan Anyway there was only
dad an me aboard to see it The cook he dont count

I might have thought about losing the bills that way Harvey said
half to himself instead of calling everybody in sight a thief
Wheres your father

In the cabin What d you want o him again

Youll see said Harvey and he stepped rather groggily for his
head was still singing to the cabin steps where the little ships
clock hung in plain sight of the wheel Troop in the
chocolateandyellow painted cabin was busy with a notebook and an
enormous black pencil which he sucked hard from time to time

I havent acted quite right said Harvey surprised at his own
meekness

Whats wrong naow said the skipper Walked into Dan hev ye

No its about you

Im here to listen

Well IIm here to take things back said Harvey very quickly
When a mans saved from drowning he gulped

Ey Youll make a man yet ef you go on this way

He oughtnt begin by calling people names

Jest an rightright an jest said Troop with the ghost of a dry
smile

So Im here to say Im sorry Another big gulp

Troop heaved himself slowly off the locker he was sitting on and held
out an eleveninch hand I mistrusted twould do you sights o good
an this shows I werent mistook in my jedgments A smothered chuckle
on deck caught his ear I am very seldom mistook in my jedgments The
eleveninch hand closed on Harveys numbing it to the elbow Well
put a little more gristle to that fore weve done with you young
feller an I dont think any worse of ye fer anythin thes gone by
You wasnt fairly responsible Go right abaout your business an you
wont take no hurt

Youre white said Dan as Harvey regained the deck flushed to the
tips of his ears

I dont feel it said he

I didnt mean that way I heard what Dad said When Dad allows he
dont think the worse of any man Dads give himself away He hates to
be mistook in his jedgments too Ho ho Onct Dad has a jedgment hed
sooner dip his colours to the British than change it Im glad its
settled right eend up Dads right when he says he cant take you back
Its all the livin we make herefishin The menll be back like
sharks after a dead whale in haaf an hour

What for said Harvey

Supper o course Dont your stummick tell you Youve a heap to
learn

Guess I have said Harvey dolefully looking at the tangle of ropes
and blocks overhead

Shes a daisy said Dan enthusiastically misunderstanding the look
Wait till our mainsails bent an she walks home with all her salt
wet Theres some work first though He pointed down into the
darkness of the open mainhatch between the two masts

Whats that for Its all empty said Harvey

You an me an a few more hev got to fill it said Dan Thats where
the fish goes

Alive said Harvey

Well no Theyre sos to be ruther deadan flatan salt Theres
a hundred hogshead o salt in the bins an we haint moren covered
our dunnage to now

Where are the fish though

In the sea they say in the boats we pray said Dan quoting a
fishermans proverb You come in last night with baout forty of em

He pointed to a sort of wooden pen just in front of the quarterdeck

You an me well sluice that out when theyre through Send well hev
full pens tonight Ive seen her down haaf a foot with fish waitin
to clean an we stood to the tables till we was splittin ourselves
instid o them we was so sleepy Yes theyre comm in naow Dan
looked over the low bulwarks at half a dozen dories rowing towards them
over the shining silky sea

Ive never seen the sea from so low down said Harvey Its fine

The low sun made the water all purple and pinkish with golden lights
on the barrels of the long swells and blue and green mackerel shades
in the hollows Each schooner in sight seemed to be pulling her dories
towards her by invisible strings and the little black figures in the
tiny boats pulled like clockwork toys

Theyve struck on good said Dan between his halfshut eyes Manuel
haint room fer another fish Low ez a lilypad in still water Aeneid
he

Which is Manuel I dont see how you can tell em way off as you do

Last boat to the southard He fund you last night said Dan
pointing Manuel rows Portugoosey ye cant mistake him East o
himhes a heap bettern he rowsis Pennsylvania Loaded with
saleratus by the looks of him East o himsee how pretty they string
out all alongwith the humpy shoulders is Long Jack Hes a Galway
man inhabitin South Boston where they all live mostly an mostly
them Galway men are good in a boat North away yonderyoull hear him
tune up in a minute is Tom Platt Manowars man he was on the old
Ohio first of our navy he says to go araound the Horn He never talks
of much else cept when he sings but he has fair fishin luck There
What did I tell you

A melodious bellow stole across the water from the northern dory
Harvey heard something about somebodys hands and feet being cold and
then

 Bring forth the chart the doleful chart
 See where them mountings meet
 The clouds are thick around their heads
 The mists around their feet

Full boat said Dan with a chuckle If he give us O Captain its
topping too

The bellow continued

 And naow to thee O Capting
 Most earnestly I pray
 That they shall never bury me
 In church or cloister gray

Double game for Tom Platt Hell tell you all about the old Ohio
tomorrow See that blue dory behind him Hes my uncleDads own
brotheran ef theres any bad luck loose on the Banks shell fetch
up agin Uncle Salters sure Look how tender hes rowin Ill lay my
wage and share hes the only man stung up todayan hes stung up
good

Whatll sting him said Harvey getting interested

Strawberries mostly Pumpkins sometimes an sometimes lemons an
cucumbers Yes hes stung up from his elbows down That mans lucks
perfectly paralyzin Naow well take aholt o the tackles an hist
em in Is it true what you told me jest now that you never done a
hands turn o work in all your born life Must feel kinder awful
dont it

Im going to try to work anyway Harvey replied stoutly Only its
all dead new

Lay aholt o that tackle then Behind ye

Harvey grabbed at a rope and long iron hook dangling from one of the
stays of the mainmast while Dan pulled down another that ran from
something he called a toppinglift as Manuel drew alongside in his
loaded dory The Portuguese smiled a brilliant smile that Harvey
learned to know well later and with a shorthandled fork began to
throw fish into the pen on deck Two hundred and thirtyone he
shouted

Give him the hook said Dan and Harvey ran it into Manuels hands
He slipped it through a loop of rope at the dorys bow caught Dans
tackle hooked it to the sternbecket and clambered into the schooner

Pull shouted Dan and Harvey pulled astonished to find how easily
the dory rose

Hold on she dont nest in the crosstrees Dan laughed and Harvey
held on for the boat lay in the air above his head

Lower away Dan shouted and as Harvey lowered Dan swayed the light
boat with one hand till it landed softly just behind the mainmast
They dont weigh nothin empty Thet was right smart fer a passenger
Theres more trick to it in a seaway

Ah ha said Manuel holding out a brown hand You are some pretty
well now This time last night the fish they fish for you Now you fish
for fish Eh whaat

ImIm ever so grateful Harvey stammered and his unfortunate hand
stole to his pocket once more but he remembered that he had no money
to offer When he knew Manuel better the mere thought of the mistake he
might have made would cover him with hot uneasy blushes in his bunk

There is no to be thankful for to me said Manuel How shall I leave
you dreeft dreeft all around the Banks Now you are a fisherman eh
whaat Ouh Auh He bent backward and forward stiffly from the hips
to get the kinks out of himself

I have not cleaned boat today Too busy They struck on queek Danny
my son clean for me

Harvey moved forward at once Here was something he could do for the
man who had saved his life

Dan threw him a swab and he leaned over the dory mopping up the slime
clumsily but with great goodwill Hike out the footboards they
slide in them grooves said Dan Swab em an lay em down Never let
a footboard jam Ye may want her bad some day Heres Long Jack

A stream of glittering fish flew into the pen from a dory alongside

Manuel you take the tackle Ill fix the tables Harvey clear
Manuels boat Long Jacks nestin on the top of her

Harvey looked up from his swabbing at the bottom of another dory just
above his head

Jest like the Injian puzzleboxes aint they said Dan as the one
boat dropped into the other

Takes to ut like a duck to water said Long Jack a grizzlychinned
longlipped Galway man bending to and fro exactly as Manuel had done
Disko in the cabin growled up the hatchway and they could hear him
suck his pencil

Wan hunder an fortynine an a halfbad luck to ye Discobolus said
Long Jack Im murderin meself to fill your pockuts Slate ut for a
bad catch The Portugee has bate me

Whack came another dory alongside and more fish shot into the pen

Two hundred and three Lets look at the passenger The speaker was
even larger than the Galway man and his face was made curious by a
purple cut running slantways from his left eye to the right corner of
his mouth

Not knowing what else to do Harvey swabbed each dory as it came down
pulled out the footboards and laid them in the bottom of the boat

Hes caught on good said the scarred man who was Tom Platt
watching him critically There are two ways o doin everything Ones
fisherfashionany end first an a slippery hitch over allan the
others

What we did on the old Ohio Dan interrupted brushing into the knot
of men with a long board on legs Get out o here Tom Platt an
leave me fix the tables

He jammed one end of the board into two nicks in the bulwarks kicked
out the leg and ducked just in time to avoid a swinging blow from the
manowars man

An they did that on the Ohio too Danny See said Tom Platt
laughing

Guess they was swiveleyed then fer it didnt git home and I know
wholl find his boots on the maintruck ef he dont leave us alone
Haul ahead Im busy cant ye see

Danny ye lie on the cable an sleep all day said Long Jack Youre
the hoight av impidence an Im persuaded yell corrupt our supercargo
in a week

His names Harvey said Dan waving two strangely shaped knives an
hell be worth five of any Sou Boston clamdigger fore long He laid
the knives tastefully on the table cocked his head on one side and
admired the effect

I think its fortytwo said a small voice overside and there was a
roar of laughter as another voice answered Then my lucks turned fer
onct caze Im fortyfive though I be stung outer all shape

Fortytwo or fortyfive Ive lost count the small voice said

Its Penn an Uncle Salters caountin catch This beats the circus any
day said Dan Jest look at em

Come income in roared Long Jack Its wet out yondher children

Fortytwo ye said This was Uncle Salters

Ill count again then the voice replied meekly The two dories
swung together and bunted into the schooners side

Patience o Jerusalem snapped Uncle Salters backing water with a
splash What possest a farmer like you to set foot in a boat beats me
Youve nigh stove me all up

I am sorry Mr Salters I came to sea on account of nervous
dyspepsia You advised me I think

You an your nervis dyspepsy be drowned in the Whalehole roared
Uncle Salters a fat and tubby little man Youre comin down on me
agin Did ye say fortytwo or fortyfive

Ive forgotten Mr Salters Lets count

Dont see as it could be fortyfive Im fortyfive said Uncle
Salters You count keerful Penn

Disko Troop came out of the cabin Salters you pitch your fish in
naow at once he said in the tone of authority

Dont spile the catch Dad Dan murmured Them two are ony jest
beginnin

Mother av delight Hes forkin them wan by wan howled Long Jack as
Uncle Salters got to work laboriously the little man in the other dory
counting a line of notches on the gunwale

That was last weeks catch he said looking up plaintively his
forefinger where he had left off

Manuel nudged Dan who darted to the aftertackle and leaning far
overside slipped the hook into the sternrope as Manuel made her fast
forward The others pulled gallantly and swung the boat inman fish
and all

One two fournine said Tom Platt counting with a practised eye
Fortyseven Penn youre it Dan let the aftertackle run and slid
him out of the stern on to the deck amid a torrent of his own fish

Hold on roared Uncle Salters bobbing by the waist Hold on Im a
bit mixed in my caount

He had no time to protest but was hove inboard and treated like
Pennsylvania

Fortyone said Tom Platt Beat by a farmer Salters An you sech a
sailor too

Twerent fair caount said he stumbling out of the pen an Im
stung up all to pieces

His thick hands were puffy and mottled purply white

Some folks will find strawberrybottom said Dan addressing the
newly risen moon ef they hev to dive fer it seems to me

An others said Uncle Salters eats the fat o the land in sloth
an mocks their own bloodkin

Seat ye Seat ye a voice Harvey had not heard called from the
focsle Disko Troop Tom Platt Long Jack and Salters went forward on
the word Little Penn bent above his square deepsea reel and the
tangled codlines Manuel lay down full length on the deck and Dan
dropped into the hold where Harvey heard him banging casks with a
hammer

Salt he said returning Soon as were through supper we git to
dressingdown Youll pitch to Dad Tom Platt an Dad they stow
together an youll hear em arguin Were second haaf you an me
an Manuel an Pennthe youth an beauty o the boat

Whats the good of that said Harvey Im hungry

Theyll be through in a minute Suff She smells good tonight Dad
ships a good cook ef he do suffer with his brother Its a full catch
today Aeneid it He pointed at the pens piled high with cod What
water did ye hev Manuel

Twentyfife father said the Portuguese sleepily They strike on
good an queek Some day I show you Harvey

The moon was beginning to walk on the still sea before the elder men
came aft The cook had no need to cry second half Dan and Manuel
were down the hatch and at table ere Tom Platt last and most
deliberate of the elders had finished wiping his mouth with the back
of his hand Harvey followed Penn and sat down before a tin pan of
cods tongues and sounds mixed with scraps of pork and fried potato a
loaf of hot bread and some black and powerful coffee Hungry as they
were they waited while Pennsylvania solemnly asked a blessing Then
they stoked in silence till Dan drew a breath over his tin cup and
demanded of Harvey how he felt

Most full but theres just room for another piece

The cook was a huge jetblack negro and unlike all the negroes
Harvey had met did not talk contenting himself with smiles and
dumbshow invitations to eat more

See Harvey said Dan rapping with his fork on the table its jest
as I said The young an handsome menlike me an Pennsy an you an
Manuelwere second haaf an we eats when the first haaf are
through Theyre the old fish an theyre mean an humpy an their
stummicks has to be humoured so they come first which they dont
deserve Aeneid that so doctor

The cook nodded

Cant he talk said Harvey in a whisper

Nough to get along Not much o anything we know His natural
tongues kinder curious Comes from the innards of Cape Breton he
does where the farmers speak homemade Scotch Cape Bretons full o
niggers whose folk run in there durin aour war an they talk like
farmersall huffychuffy

That is not Scotch said Pennsylvania That is Gaelic So I read
in a book

Penn reads a heap Most of what he says is socep when it comes to
a caount o fisheh

Does your father just let them say how many theyve caught without
checking them said Harvey

Why yes Wheres the sense of a man lyin fer a few old cod

Was a man once lied for his catch Manuel put in Lied every day
Fife ten twentyfife more fish than come he say there was

Where was that said Dan None o aour folk

Frenchman of Anguille

Ah Them West Shore Frenchmen dont caount anyway Stands to reason
they cant caount Ef you run acrost any of their soft hooks Harvey
youll know why said Dan with an awful contempt

 Always more and never less
 Every time we come to dress

Long Jack roared down the hatch and the second haaf scrambled up at
once

The shadow of the masts and rigging with the neverfurled ridingsail
rolled to and fro on the heaving deck in the moonlight and the pile of
fish by the stern shone like a dump of fluid silver In the hold there
were tramplings and rumblings where Disko Troop and Tom Platt moved
among the saltbins Dan passed Harvey a pitchfork and led him to the
inboard end of the rough table where Uncle Salters was drumming
impatiently with a knifehaft A tub of salt water lay at his feet

You pitch to dad an Tom Platt down the hatch an take keer Uncle
Salters dont cut yer eye out said Dan swinging himself into the
hold Ill pass salt below

Penn and Manuel stood knee deep among cod in the pen flourishing drawn
knives Long Jack a basket at his feet and mittens on his hands faced
Uncle Salters at the table and Harvey stared at the pitchfork and the
tub

Hi shouted Manuel stooping to the fish and bringing one up with a
finger under its gill and a finger in its eyes He laid it on the edge
of the pen the knifeblade glimmered with a sound of tearing and the
fish slit from throat to vent with a nick on either side of the neck
dropped at Long Jacks feet

Hi said Long Jack with a scoop of his mittened hand The cods
liver dropped in the basket Another wrench and scoop sent the head and
offal flying and the empty fish slid across to Uncle Salters who
snorted fiercely There was another sound of tearing the backbone flew
over the bulwarks and the fish headless gutted and open splashed
in the tub sending the salt water into Harveys astonished mouth
After the first yell the men were silent The cod moved along as
though they were alive and long ere Harvey had ceased wondering at the
miraculous dexterity of it all his tub was full

Pitch grunted Uncle Salters without turning his head and Harvey
pitched the fish by twos and threes down the hatch

Hi Pitch em bunchy shouted Dan Dont scatter Uncle Salters is
the best splitter in the fleet Watch him mind his book

Indeed it looked a little as though the round uncle were cutting
magazine pages against time Manuels body cramped over from the hips
stayed like a statue but his long arms grabbed the fish without
ceasing Little Penn toiled valiantly but it was easy to see he was
weak Once or twice Manuel found time to help him without breaking the
chain of supplies and once Manuel howled because he had caught his
finger in a Frenchmans hook These hooks are made of soft metal to be
rebent after use but the cod very often get away with them and are
hooked again elsewhere and that is one of the many reasons why the
Gloucester boats despise the Frenchmen

Down below the rasping sound of rough salt rubbed on rough flesh
sounded like the whirring of a grindstonesteady undertune to the
clicknick of knives in the pen the wrench and shloop of torn heads
dropped liver and flying offal the caraaah of Uncle Salterss knife
scooping away backbones and the flap of wet open bodies falling into
the tub

At the end of an hour Harvey would have given the world to rest for
fresh wet cod weigh more than you would think and his back ached with
the steady pitching But he felt for the first time in his life that he
was one of the working gang of men took pride in the thought and held
on sullenly

Knife oh shouted Uncle Salters at last Penn doubled up gasping
among the fish Manuel bowed back and forth to supple himself and Long
Jack leaned over the bulwarks The cook appeared noiseless as a black
shadow collected a mass of backbones and heads and retreated

Bloodends for breakfast an headchowder said Long Jack smacking
his lips

Knife oh repeated Uncle Salters waving the flat curved splitters
weapon

Look by your foot Harve cried Dan below

Harvey saw half a dozen knives stuck in a cleat in the hatch combing
He dealt these around taking over the dulled ones

Water said Disko Troop

Scuttlebutts forard an the dippers alongside Hurry Harve said
Dan

He was back in a minute with a big dipperful of stale brown water which
tasted like nectar and loosed the jaws of Disko and Tom Platt

These are cod said Disko They aint Damarskus figs Tom Platt nor
yet silver bars Ive told you that ever single time since weve sailed
together

A matter o seven seasons returned Tom Platt coolly Good stowins
good stowin all the same an theres a right an a wrong way o
stowin ballast even If youd ever seen four hundred ton o iron set
into the

Hi With a yell from Manuel the work began again and never stopped
till the pen was empty The instant the last fish was down Disko Troop
rolled aft to the cabin with his brother Manuel and Long Jack went
forward Tom Platt only waited long enough to slide home the hatch ere
he too disappeared In half a minute Harvey heard deep snores in the
cabin and he was staring blankly at Dan and Penn

I did a little better that time Danny said Penn whose eyelids were
heavy with sleep But I think it is my duty to help clean

Wouldnt hev your conscience fer a thousand quintal said Dan Turn
in Penn Youve no call to do boys work Draw a bucket Harvey Oh
Penn dump these in the gurrybutt fore you sleep Kin you keep awake
that long

Penn took up the heavy basket of fishlivers emptied them into a cask
with a hinged top lashed by the focsle then he too dropped out of
sight in the cabin

Boys clean up after dressin down an first watch in caam weather is
boys watch on the _Were Here_ Dan sluiced the pen energetically
unshipped the table set it up to dry in the moonlight ran the red
knifeblades through a wad of oakum and began to sharpen them on a
tiny grindstone as Harvey threw offal and backbones overboard under
his direction

At the first splash a silverywhite ghost rose bolt upright from the
oily water and sighed a weird whistling sigh Harvey started back with
a shout but Dan only laughed

Grampus said he Beggin fer fishheads They upeend the way when
theyre hungry Breath on him like the doleful tombs haint he A
horrible stench of decayed fish filled the air as the pillar of white
sank and the water bubbled oilily Haint ye never seen a grampus
upeend before Youll see em by hundreds fore yere through Say
its good to hev a boy aboard again Otto was too old an a Dutchy at
that Him an me we fought considble Wouldnt ha keered fer that ef
hed hed a Christian tongue in his head Sleepy

Dead sleepy said Harvey nodding forward

Mustnt sleep on watch Rouse up an see ef our anchorlights bright
an shinin Youre on watch now Harve

Pshaw Whats to hurt us Brights day Snorrr

Jest when things happen Dad says Fine weathers good sleepin an
fore you know mebbe youre cut in two by a liner an seventeen
brassbound officers all genelmen lift their hand to it that your
lights was aout an there was a thick fog Harve Ive kinder took to
you but ef you nod onct more Ill lay into you with a ropes end

The moon who sees many strange things on the Banks looked down on a
slim youth in knickerbockers and a red jersey staggering around the
cluttered decks of a seventyton schooner while behind him waving a
knotted rope walked after the manner of an executioner a boy who
yawned and nodded between the blows he dealt

The lashed wheel groaned and kicked softly the ridingsail slatted a
little in the shifts of the light wind the windlass creaked and the
miserable procession continued Harvey expostulated threatened
whimpered and at last wept outright while Dan the words clotting on
his tongue spoke of the beauty of watchfulness and slashed away with
the ropes end punishing the dories as often as he hit Harvey At last
the clock in the cabin struck ten and upon the tenth stroke little
Penn crept on deck He found two boys in two tumbled heaps side by side
on the main hatch so deeply asleep that he actually rolled them to
their berths



CHAPTER III

It was the fortyfathom slumber that clears the soul and eye and heart
and sends you to breakfast ravening They emptied a big tin dish of
juicy fragments of fishthe bloodends the cook had collected
overnight They cleaned up the plates and pans of the elder mess who
were out fishing sliced pork for the midday meal swabbed down the
focsle filled the lamps drew coal and water for the cook and
investigated the forehold where the boats stores were stacked It
was another perfect daysoft mild and clear and Harvey breathed to
the very bottom of his lungs

More schooners had crept up in the night and the long blue seas were
full of sails and dories Far away on the horizon the smoke of some
liner her hull invisible smudged the blue and to eastward a big
ships topgallant sails just lifting made a square nick in it Disko
Troop was smoking by the roof of the cabinone eye on the craft
around and the other on the little fly at the mainmasthead

When Dad kerflummoxes that way said Dan in a whisper hes doin
some highline thinkin fer all hands Ill lay my wage an share well
make berth soon Dad he knows the cod an the Fleet they know Dad
knows See em comm up one by one lookin fer nothin in particular
o course but scrowgin on us all the time Theres the _Prince Leboo_
shes a Chatham boat Shes crep up sence last night An see that
big one with a patch in her foresail an a new jib Shes the _Carrie
Pitman_ from West Chatham She wont keep her canvas long onless her
lucks changed since last season She dont do much cep drift There
aint an anchor made ll hold her    When the smoke puffs up in
little rings like that Dads studyin the fish Ef we speak to him
now hell git mad Las time I did he jest took an hove a boot at
me

Disko Troop stared forward the pipe between his teeth with eyes that
saw nothing As his son said he was studying the fishpitting his
knowledge and experience on the Banks against the roving cod in his own
sea He accepted the presence of the inquisitive schooners on the
horizon as a compliment to his powers But now that it was paid he
wished to draw away and make his berth alone till it was time to go up
to the Virgin and fish in the streets of that roaring town upon the
waters So Disko Troop thought of recent weather and gales currents
foodsupplies and other domestic arrangements from the point of view
of a twentypound cod was in fact for an hour a cod himself and
looked remarkably like one Then he removed the pipe from his teeth

Dad said Dan weve done our chores Cant we go overside a piece
Its good catchin weather

Not in that cherrycoloured rig ner them haaf baked brown shoes Give
him suthin fit to wear

Dads pleasedthat settles it said Dan delightedly dragging
Harvey into the cabin while Troop pitched a key down the steps Dad
keeps my spare rig where he kin overhaul it cause Ma sez Im
keerless He rummaged through a locker and in less than three minutes
Harvey was adorned with fishermans rubber boots that came half up his
thigh a heavy blue jersey well darned at the elbows a pair of
nippers and a souwester

Naow ye look somethin like said Dan Hurry

Keep nigh an handy said Troop an dont go visitin raound the
Fleet If any one asks you what Im callatin to do speak the
truthfer ye dont know

A little red dory labelled Hattie S lay astern of the schooner Dan
hauled in the painter and dropped lightly on to the bottom boards
while Harvey tumbled clumsily after

Thats no way o gettin into a boat said Dan Ef there was any sea
youd go to the bottom sure You got to learn to meet her

Dan fitted the tholepins took the forward thwart and watched Harveys
work The boy had rowed in a ladylike fashion on the Adirondack
ponds but there is a difference between squeaking pins and
wellbalanced ruflockslight sculls and stubby eightfoot seaoars
They stuck in the gentle swell and Harvey grunted

Short Row short said Dan Ef you cramp your oar in any kind o sea
youre liable to turn her over Aint she a daisy Mine too

The little dory was specklessly clean In her bows lay a tiny anchor
two jugs of water and some seventy fathoms of thin brown doryroding
A tin dinnerhorn rested in cleats just under Harveys right hand
beside an uglylooking maul a short gaff and a shorter wooden stick
A couple of lines with very heavy leads and double codhooks all
neatly coiled on square reels were stuck in their place by the gunwale

Wheres the sail and mast said Harvey for his hands were beginning
to blister

Dan chuckled Ye dont sail fishindories much Ye pull but ye
neednt pull so hard Dont you wish you owned her

Well I guess my father might give me one or two if I asked em
Harvey replied He had been too busy to think much of his family till
then

Thats so I forgot your dads a millionaire You dont act millionary
any naow But a dory an craft an gearDan spoke as though she were
a whaleboatcosts a heap Think your dad ud give you one ferfer a
pet like

Shouldnt wonder It would be most the only thing I havent stuck him
for yet

Must be an expensive kinder kid to home Dont slitheroo thet way
Harve Shorts the trick because no seas ever dead still an the
swells ll

Crack The loom of the oar kicked Harvey under the chin and knocked him
backwards

That was what I was goin to say I hed to learn too but I wasnt
more than eight years old when I got my schoolin

Harvey regained his seat with aching jaws and a frown

No good gettin mad at things Dad says Its our own fault ef we
cant handle em he says Les try here Manuel ll give us the water

The Portugee was rocking fully a mile away but when Dan upended an
oar he waved his left arm three times

Thirty fathom said Dan stringing a salt clam on to the hook Over
with the doughboys Bait sames I do Harvey an dont snarl your
reel

Dans line was out long before Harvey had mastered the mystery of
baiting and heaving out the leads The dory drifted along easily It
was not worth while to anchor till they were sure of good ground

Here we come Dan shouted and a shower of spray rattled on Harveys
shoulders as a big cod flapped and kicked alongside Muckle Harvey
muckle Under your hand Quick

Evidently muckle could not be the dinnerhorn so Harvey passed over
the maul and Dan scientifically stunned the fish before he pulled it
inboard and wrenched out the hook with the short wooden stick he
called a gobstick Then Harvey felt a tug and pulled up zealously

Why these are strawberries he shouted Look

The hook had fouled among a bunch of strawberries red on one side and
white on the otherperfect reproductions of the land fruit except
that there were no leaves and the stem was all pipy and slimy

Dont tech em Slat em off Dont

The warning came too late Harvey had picked them from the hook and
was admiring them

Ouch he cried for his fingers throbbed as though he had grasped
many nettles

Now ye know what strawberrybottom means Nothin cep fish should be
teched with the naked fingers Dad says Slat em off agin the gunnel
an bait up Harve Lookin wont help any Its all in the wages

Harvey smiled at the thought of his ten and a half dollars a month and
wondered what his mother would say if she could see him hanging over
the edge of a fishingdory in midocean She suffered agonies whenever
he went out on Saranac Lake and by the way Harvey remembered
distinctly that he used to laugh at her anxieties Suddenly the line
flashed through his hand stinging even through the nippers the
woolen circlets supposed to protect it

Hes a logy Give him room accordin to his strength cried Dan
Ill help ye

No you wont Harvey snapped as he hung on to the line Its my
first fish Isis it a whale

Halibut mebbe Dan peered down into the water alongside and
flourished the big muckle ready for all chances Something white and
oval flickered and fluttered through the green Ill lay my wage an
share hes over a hundred Are you so everlastin anxious to land him
alone

Harveys knuckles were raw and bleeding where they had been banged
against the gunwale his face was purpleblue between excitement and
exertion he dripped with sweat and was halfblinded from staring at
the circling sunlit ripples about the swiftly moving line The boys
were tired long ere the halibut who took charge of them and the dory
for the next twenty minutes But the big flat fish was gaffed and
hauled in at last

Beginners luck said Dan wiping his forehead Hes all of a
hundred

Harvey looked at the huge grayandmottled creature with unspeakable
pride He had seen halibut many times on marble slabs ashore but it
had never occurred to him to ask how they came inland Now he knew and
every inch of his body ached with fatigue

Ef Dad was along said Dan hauling up hed read the signs plains
print The fish are runnin smaller an smaller an youve took baout
as logy a halibuts were apt to find this trip Yesterdays catchdid
ye notice itwas all big fish an no halibut Dad hed read them
signs right off Dad says everythin on the Banks is signs an can be
read wrong er right Dads deepern the Whalehole

Even as he spoke some one fired a pistol on the _Were Here_ and a
potatobasket was run up in the forerigging

What did I say naow Thats the call fer the whole crowd Dads onter
something er hed never break fishin this time o day Reel up
Harve an well pull back

They were to windward of the schooner just ready to flirt the dory
over the still sea when sounds of woe half a mile off led them to
Penn who was careering around a fixed point for all the world like a
gigantic waterbug The little man backed away and came down again with
enormous energy but at the end of each maneuver his dory swung round
and snubbed herself on her rope

Well hev to help him else hell root an seed here said Dan

Whats the matter said Harvey This was a new world where he could
not lay down the law to his elders but had to ask questions humbly
And the sea was horribly big and unexcited

Anchors fouled Penns always losing em Lost two this trip
areadyon sandy bottom tooan Dad says next one he loses sures
fishin hell give him the kelleg That ud break Penns heart

Whats a kelleg said Harvey who had a vague idea it might be some
kind of marine torture like keelhauling in the storybooks

Big stone instid of an anchor You kin see a kelleg ridin in the bows
furs you can see a dory an all the fleet knows what it means Theyd
guy him dreadful Penn couldnt stand that no moren a dog with a
dipper to his tail Hes so everlastin sensitive Hello Penn Stuck
again Dont try any more o your patents Come up on her and keep
your rodin straight up an down

It doesnt move said the little man panting It doesnt move at
all and instead I tried everything

Whats all this hurrahsnest forard said Dan pointing to a wild
tangle of spare oars and doryroding all matted together by the hand
of inexperience

Oh that said Penn proudly is a Spanish windlass Mr Salters
showed me how to make it but even that doesnt move her

Dan bent low over the gunwale to hide a smile twitched once or twice
on the roding and behold the anchor drew at once

Haul up Penn he said laughing er shell git stuck again

They left him regarding the weedhung flukes of the little anchor with
big pathetic blue eyes and thanking them profusely

Oh say while I think of it Harve said Dan when they were out of
earshot Penn aint quite all caulked He aint nowise dangerous but
his minds give out See

Is that so or is it one of your fathers judgments

Harvey asked as he bent to his oars He felt he was learning to handle
them more easily

Dad aint mistook this time Penns a sure nuff loony

No he aint thet exactly so much ez a harmless ijut It was this way
youre rowin quite so Harve an I tell you cause its right you
orter know He was a Moravian preacher once Jacob Boiler wuz his name
Dad told me an he lived with his wife an four children somewheres
out Pennsylvania way Well Penn he took his folks along to a Moravian
meetincampmeetin most likean they stayed over jest one night in
Johnstown Youve heered talk o Johnstown

Harvey considered Yes I have But I dont know why It sticks in my
head same as Ashtabula

Both was big accidentsthets why Harve Well that one single night
Penn and his folks was to the hotel Johnstown was wiped out Dam bust
an flooded her an the houses struck adrift an bumped into each
other an sunk Ive seen the pictures an theyre dretful Penn he
saw his folk drowned alln a heap fore he rightly knew what was
comin His mind give out from that on He mistrusted somethin hed
happened up to Johnstown but for the poor life of him he couldnt
remember what an he jest drifted araound smilin an wonderin He
didnt know what he was nor yit what he hed bin an thet way he run
agin Uncle Salters who was visitin n Allegheny City Haaf my
mothers folks they live scattered inside o Pennsylvania an Uncle
Salters he visits araound winters Uncle Salters he kinder adopted
Penn well knowin what his trouble wuz an he brought him East an
he give him work on his farm

Why I heard him calling Penn a farmer last night when the boats
bumped Is your Uncle Salters a farmer

Farmer shouted Dan There aint water enough tween here an
Hattrus to wash the furrermold offn his boots Hes jest everlastin
farmer Why Harve Ive seen thet man hitch up a bucket long towards
sundown an set twiddlin the spigot to the scuttlebutt sames ef

an layin an wrote to Uncle Salters Never heerd what they said
exactly but Uncle Salters was mad Hes a piscopolian mostlybut he

sez he warnt goin to give up Penn to any blame Moravian connection in
Pennsylvania or anywheres else Then he come to Dad towin Pennthet
was two trips backan sez he an Penn must fish a trip fer their
health Guess he thought the Moravians wouldnt hunt the Banks fer
Jacob Boiler Dad was agreeable fer Uncle Salters hed been fishin
off an on fer thirty years when he warnt inventin patent manures
an he took quartershare in the _Were Here_ an the trip done Penn
so much good Dad made a habit o takin him Some day Dad sez hell
remember his wife an kids an Johnstown an then like as not hell
die Dad sez Dont ye talk abaout Johnstown ner such things to Penn
r Uncle Salters hell heave ye overboard

Poor Penn murmured Harvey I shouldnt ever have thought Uncle
Salters cared for him by the look of em together

I like Penn though we all do said Dan We ought to ha give him a
tow but I wanted to tell ye first

They were close to the schooner now the other boats a little behind
them

You neednt heave in the dories till after dinner said Troop from
the deck Well dress daown right off Fix table boys

Deepern the Whaledeep said Dan with a wink as he set the gear
for dressing down Look at them boats that hev edged up sence mornin
Theyre all waitin on Dad See em Harve

They are all alike to me And indeed to a landsman the nodding
schooners around seemed run from the same mold

They aint though That yaller dirty packet with her bowsprit
steeved that way shes the Hope of Prague Nick Bradys her skipper
the meanest man on the Banks Well tell him so when we strike the Main
Ledge Way off yonders the Days Eye The two Jeraulds own her Shes
from Harwich fastish too an hez good luck but Dad hed find fish
in a graveyard Them other three side along theyre the Margie Smith
Rose and Edith S Walen all from home Guess well see the Abbie M
Deering tomorrer Dad wont we Theyre all slippin over from the
shaol o Oueereau

You wont see many boats tomorrow Danny When Troop called his son
Danny it was a sign that the old man was pleased Boys were too
crowded he went on addressing the crew as they clambered inboard
Well leave em to bait big an catch small He looked at the catch
in the pen and it was curious to see how little and level the fish
ran Save for Harveys halibut there was nothing over fifteen pounds
on deck

Im waitin on the weather he added

Yell have to make it yourself Disko for theres no sign I can see
said Long Jack sweeping the clear horizon

And yet half an hour later as they were dressing down the Bank fog
dropped on them between fish and fish as they say It drove
steadily and in wreaths curling and smoking along the colourless
water The men stopped dressingdown without a word Long Jack and
Uncle Salters slipped the windlass brakes into their sockets and began
to heave up the anchor the windlass jarring as the wet hempen cable
strained on the barrel Manuel and Tom Platt gave a hand at the last
The anchor came up with a sob and the ridingsail bellied as Troop
steadied her at the wheel Up jib and foresail said he

Slip em in the smother shouted Long Jack making fast the
jibsheet while the others raised the clacking rattling rings of the
foresail and the foreboom creaked as the _Were Here_ looked up into
the wind and dived off into blank whirling white

Theres wind behind this fog said Troop

It was wonderful beyond words to Harvey and the most wonderful part
was that he heard no orders except an occasional grunt from Troop
ending with Thats good my son

Never seen anchor weighed before said Tom Platt to Harvey gaping at
the damp canvas of the foresail

No Where are we going

Fish and make berth as youll find out fore youve been a week
aboard Its all new to you but we never know what may come to us
Now take meTom PlattId never ha thought

Its better than fourteen dollars a month an a bullet in your belly
said Troop from the wheel Ease your jumbo a grind

Dollars an cents better returned the manowars man doing
something to a big jib with a wooden spar tied to it But we didnt
think o that when we manned the windlassbrakes on the Miss Jim Buck
I outside Beaufort Harbor with Fort Macon heavin hot shot at our
stern an a livin gale atop of all Where was you then Disko

Jest here or hereabouts Disko replied earnin my bread on the
deep waters an dodgin Reb privateers Sorry I cant accommodate you
with redhot shot Tom Platt but I guess well come aout all right on
wind fore we see Eastern Point

There was an incessant slapping and chatter at the bows now varied by
a solid thud and a little spout of spray that clattered down on the
focsle The rigging dripped clammy drops and the men lounged along
the lee of the houseall save Uncle Salters who sat stiffly on the
mainhatch nursing his stung hands

Guess shed carry staysl said Disko rolling one eye at his brother

Guess she wouldnt to any sorter profit Whats the sense o wastin
canvas the farmersailor replied

The wheel twitched almost imperceptibly in Diskos hands A few seconds
later a hissing wavetop slashed diagonally across the boat smote
Uncle Salters between the shoulders and drenched him from head to
foot He rose sputtering and went forward only to catch another

See Dad chase him all around the deck said Dan Uncle Salters he
thinks his quarter shares our canvas Dads put this duckin act up on
him two trips runnin Hi That found him where he feeds Uncle
Salters had taken refuge by the foremast but a wave slapped him over
the knees Diskos face was as blank as the circle of the wheel

Guess shed lie easier under staysl Salters said Disko as though
he had seen nothing

Set your old kite then roared the victim through a cloud of spray
only dont lay it to me if anything happens Penn you go below right
off an git your coffee You ought to hev more sense than to bum
araound on deck this weather

Now theyll swill coffee an play checkers till the cows come home
said Dan as Uncle Salters hustled Penn into the forecabin Looks to
me likes if wed all be doin so fer a spell Theres nothin in
creation deaderlimpseyidlern a Banker when she aint on fish

Im glad ye spoke Danny cried Long Jack who had been casting round
in search of amusement Id clean forgot wed a passenger under that
Twharf hat Theres no idleness for thim that dont know their ropes
Pass him along Tom Platt an well larn him

Taint my trick this time grinned Dan Youve got to go it alone
Dad learned me with a ropes end

For an hour Long Jack walked his prey up and down teaching as he
said things at the sea that ivry man must know blind dhrunk or
asleep There is not much gear to a seventyton schooner with a
stumpforemast but Long Jack had a gift of expression When he wished
to draw Harveys attention to the peakhalyards he dug his knuckles
into the back of the boys neck and kept him at gaze for half a minute
He emphasized the difference between fore and aft generally by rubbing
Harveys nose along a few feet of the boom and the lead of each rope
was fixed in Harveys mind by the end of the rope itself

The lesson would have been easier had the deck been at all free but
there appeared to be a place on it for everything and anything except a
man Forward lay the windlass and its tackle with the chain and hemp
cables all very unpleasant to trip over the focsle stovepipe and
the gurrybutts by the focsle hatch to hold the fishlivers Aft of
these the foreboom and booby of the mainhatch took all the space that
was not needed for the pumps and dressingpens Then came the nests of
dories lashed to ringbolts by the quarterdeck the house with tubs
and oddments lashed all around it and last the sixtyfoot mainboom
in its crutch splitting things lengthwise to duck and dodge under
every time

Tom Platt of course could not keep his oar out of the business but
ranged alongside with enormous and unnecessary descriptions of sails
and spars on the old Ohio

Niver mind fwhat he says attind to me Innocince Tom Platt this
ballyhoos not the Ohio an youre mixing the bhoy bad

Hell be ruined for life beginnin on a foreanafter this way Tom
Platt pleaded Give him a chance to know a few leadin principles
Sailins an art Harvey as Id show you if I had ye in the foretop o
the

I know ut Yed talk him dead an cowld Silince Tom Platt Now
after all Ive said howd you reef the foresail Harve Take your time
answerin

Haul that in said Harvey pointing to leeward

Fwhat The North Atlantuc

No the boom Then run that rope you showed me back there

Thats no way Tom Platt burst in

Quiet Hes larnin an has not the names good yet Go on Harve

Oh its the reefpennant Id hook the tackle on to the reefpennant
and then let down

Lower the sail child Lower said Tom Platt in a professional agony

Lower the throat and peak halyards Harvey went on Those names stuck
in his head

Lay your hand on thim said Long Jack

Harvey obeyed Lower till that ropeloopon the afterleachkrisno
its cringletill the cringle was down on the boom Then Id tie her
up the way you said and then Id hoist up the peak and throat halyards
again

Youve forgot to pass the tackearing but wid time and help yell
larn Theres good and just reason for ivry rope aboard or else
twould be overboard Dye follow me Tis dollars an cents Im
puttin into your pocket ye skinny little supercargo so that fwhin
yeve filled out ye can ship from Boston to Cuba an tell thim Long
Jack larned you Now Ill chase ye around a piece callin the ropes
an youll lay your hand on thim as I call

He began and Harvey who was feeling rather tired walked slowly to
the rope named A ropes end licked round his ribs and nearly knocked
the breath out of him

When you own a boat said Tom Platt with severe eyes you can walk
Till then take all orders at the run Once moreto make sure

Harvey was in a glow with the exercise and this last cut warmed him
thoroughly Now he was a singularly smart boy the son of a very clever
man and a very sensitive woman with a fine resolute temper that
systematic spoiling had nearly turned to mulish obstinacy He looked at
the other men and saw that even Dan did not smile It was evidently
all in the days work though it hurt abominably so he swallowed the
hint with a gulp and a gasp and a grin The same smartness that led him
to take such advantage of his mother made him very sure that no one on
the boat except maybe Penn would stand the least nonsense One
learns a great deal from a mere tone Long Jack called over half a
dozen ropes and Harvey danced over the deck like an eel at ebbtide
one eye on Tom Platt

Ver good Ver good don said Manuel After supper I show you a
little schooner I make with all her ropes So we shall learn

Fustclass fera passenger said Dan Dad hes jest allowed youll
be wuth your salt maybe fore youre draownded Thets a heap fer Dad
Ill learn you more our next watch together

Taller grunted Disko peering through the fog as it smoked over the
bows There was nothing to be seen ten feet beyond the surging
jibboom while alongside rolled the endless procession of solemn pale
waves whispering and lipping one to the other

Now Ill learn you something Long Jack cant shouted Tom Platt as
from a locker by the stern he produced a battered deepsea lead
hollowed at one end smeared the hollow from a saucer full of mutton
tallow and went forward Ill learn you how to fly the Blue Pigeon
Shooo

Disko did something to the wheel that checked the schooners way while
Manuel with Harvey to help and a proud boy was Harvey let down the
jib in a lump on the boom The lead sung a deep droning song as Tom
Platt whirled it round and round

Go ahead man said Long Jack impatiently Were not drawin
twentyfive fut off Fire Island in a fog Theres no trick to ut

Dont be jealous Galway The released lead plopped into the sea far
ahead as the schooner surged slowly forward

Soundin is a trick though said Dan when your dipsey leads all
the eye youre like to hev for a week What dyou make it Dad

Diskos face relaxed His skill and honour were involved in the march
he had stolen on the rest of the Fleet and he had his reputation as a
master artist who knew the Banks blindfold Sixty mebbeef Im any
judge he replied with a glance at the tiny compass in the window of
the house

Sixty sung out Tom Platt hauling in great wet coils

The schooner gathered way once more Heave said Disko after a
quarter of an hour

What dyou make it Dan whispered and he looked at Harvey proudly
But Harvey was too proud of his own performances to be impressed just
then

Fifty said the father I mistrust were right over the nick o
Green Bank on old SixtyFifty

Fifty roared Tom Platt They could scarcely see him through the fog
Shes bust within a yardlike the shells at Fort Macon

Bait up Harve said Dan diving for a line on the reel

The schooner seemed to be straying promiscuously through the smother
her headsail banging wildly The men waited and looked at the boys who
began fishing

Heugh Dans lines twitched on the scored and scarred rail Now haow
in thunder did Dad know Help us here Harve Its a big un
Pokehooked too They hauled together and landed a goggleeyed
twentypound cod He had taken the bait right into his stomach

Why hes all covered with little crabs cried Harvey turning him
over

By the great hookblock theyre lousy already said Long Jack
Disko ye kape your spare eyes under the keel

Splash went the anchor and they all heaved over the lines each man
taking his own place at the bulwarks

Are they good to eat Harvey panted as he lugged in another
crabcovered cod

Sure When theyre lousy its a sign theyve all been herdin together
by the thousand and when they take the bait that way theyre hungry
Never mind how the bait sets Theyll bite on the bare hook

Say this is great Harvey cried as the fish came in gasping and
splashingnearly all pokehooked as Dan had said Why cant we
always fish from the boat instead of from the dories

Allus can till we begin to dress daown Efter thet the heads and
offals ud scare the fish to Fundy Boatfishin aint reckoned
progressive though unless ye know as much as dad knows Guess well
run aout aour trawl tonight Harder on the back this than frum the
dory aint it

It was rather backbreaking work for in a dory the weight of a cod is
waterborne till the last minute and you are so to speak abreast of
him but the few feet of a schooners freeboard make so much extra
deadhauling and stooping over the bulwarks cramps the stomach But it
was wild and furious sport so long as it lasted and a big pile lay
aboard when the fish ceased biting

Wheres Penn and Uncle Salters Harvey asked slapping the slime off
his oilskins and reeling up the line in careful imitation of the
others

Git s coffee and see

Under the yellow glare of the lamp on the pawlpost the focsle table
down and opened utterly unconscious of fish or weather sat the two
men a checkerboard between them Uncle Salters snarling at Penns
every move

Whats the matter naow said the former as Harvey one hand in the
leather loop at the head of the ladder hung shouting to the cook

Big fish and lousyheaps and heaps Harvey replied quoting Long
Jack Hows the game

Little Penns jaw dropped Twerent none o his fault snapped Uncle
Salters Penns deef

Checkers werent it said Dan as Harvey staggered aft with the
steaming coffee in a tin pail That lets us out o cleanin up
tonight Dads a jest man Theyll have to do it

An two young fellers I knowll bait up a tub or so o trawl while
theyre cleanin said Disko lashing the wheel to his taste

Um Guess Id ruther clean up Dad

Dont doubt it Ye wunt though Dress daown Dress daown Pennll
pitch while you two bait up

Why in thunder didnt them blame boys tell us youd struck on said
Uncle Salters shuffling to his place at the table This knifes
gumblunt Dan

Ef stickin out cable dont wake ye guess youd better hire a boy o
your own said Dan muddling about in the dusk over the tubs full of
trawlline lashed to windward of the house Oh Harve dont ye want
to slip down an git s bait

Bait ez we are said Disko I mistrust shagfishin will pay better
ez things go

That meant the boys would bait with selected offal of the cod as the
fish were cleanedan improvement on paddling barehanded in the little
baitbarrels below The tubs were full of neatly coiled line carrying a
big hook each few feet and the testing and baiting of every single
hook with the stowage of the baited line so that it should run clear
when shot from the dory was a scientific business Dan managed it in
the dark without looking while Harvey caught his fingers on the barbs
and bewailed his fate But the hooks flew through Dans fingers like
tatting on an old maids lap I helped bait up trawl ashore fore I
could well walk he said But its a putterin job all the same Oh
Dad This shouted towards the hatch where Disko and Tom Platt were
salting How many skates you reckon well need

Baout three Hurry

Theres three hundred fathom to each tub Dan explained moren
enough to lay out tonight Ouch Slipped up there I did He stuck
his finger in his mouth I tell you Harve there aint money in
Gloucester ud hire me to ship on a reglar trawler It may be
progressive but barrin that its the putterinest slimjammest
business top of earth

I dont know what this is if tisnt regular trawling said Harvey
sulkily My fingers are all cut to frazzles

Pshaw This is just one o Dads blame experiments He dont trawl
less theres mighty good reason fer it Dad knows Thets why hes
baitin ez he is Well hev her saggin full when we take her up er we
wont see a fin

Penn and Uncle Salters cleaned up as Disko had ordained but the boys
profited little No sooner were the tubs furnished than Tom Platt and
Long Jack who had been exploring the inside of a dory with a lantern
snatched them away loaded up the tubs and some small painted
trawlbuoys and hove the boat overboard into what Harvey regarded as
an exceedingly rough sea Theyll be drowned Why the dorys loaded
like a freightcar he cried

Well be back said Long Jack an in case youll not be lookin for
us well lay into you both if the trawls snarled

The dory surged up on the crest of a wave and just when it seemed
impossible that she could avoid smashing against the schooners side
slid over the ridge and was swallowed up in the damp dusk

Take ahold here an keep ringin steady said Dan passing Harvey
the lanyard of a bell that hung just behind the windlass

Harvey rang lustily for he felt two lives depended on him But Disko
in the cabin scrawling in the logbook did not look like a murderer
and when he went to supper he even smiled dryly at the anxious Harvey

This aint no weather said Dan Why you an me could set thet
trawl Theyve only gone out jest far nough sos not to foul our
cable They dont need no bell reelly

Clang clang clang Harvey kept it up varied with occasional
rubadubs for another halfhour There was a bellow and a bump
alongside Manuel and Dan raced to the hooks of the dorytackle Long
Jack and Tom Platt arrived on deck together it seemed one half the
North Atlantic at their backs and the dory followed them in the air
landing with a clatter

Nary snarl said Tom Platt as he dripped Danny youll do yet

The pleasure av your compny to the banquit said Long Jack
squelching the water from his boots as he capered like an elephant and
stuck an oilskinned arm into Harveys face We do be condescending to
honour the second half wid our presence And off they all four rolled
to supper where Harvey stuffed himself to the brim on fishchowder and
fried pies and fell fast asleep just as Manuel produced from a locker
a lovely twofoot model of the Lucy Holmes his first boat and was
going to show Harvey the ropes Harvey never even twiddled his fingers
as Penn pushed him into his bunk

It must be a sad thinga very sad thing said Penn watching the
boys face for his mother and his father who think he is dead To
lose a childto lose a manchild

Git out o this Penn said Dan Go aft and finish your game with
Uncle Salters Tell Dad Ill stand Harves watch ef he dont keer Hes
played aout

Ver good boy said Manuel slipping out of his boots and
disappearing into the black shadows of the lower bunk Expec he make
good man Danny I no see he is any so mad as your parpa he says Eh
whaat

Dan chuckled but the chuckle ended in a snore

It was thick weather outside with a rising wind and the elder men
stretched their watches The hour struck clear in the cabin the nosing
bows slapped and scuffed with the seas the focsle stovepipe hissed
and sputtered as the spray caught it and the boys slept on while
Disko Long Jack Tom Platt and Uncle Salters each in turn stumped
aft to look at the wheel forward to see that the anchor held or to
veer out a little more cable against chafing with a glance at the dim
anchorlight between each round



CHAPTER IV

Harvey waked to find the first half at breakfast the focsle door
drawn to a crack and every square inch of the schooner singing its own
tune The black bulk of the cook balanced behind the tiny galley over
the glare of the stove and the pots and pans in the pierced wooden
board before it jarred and racketed to each plunge Up and up the
focsle climbed yearning and surging and quivering and then with a
clear sicklelike swoop came down into the seas He could hear the
flaring bows cut and squelch and there was a pause ere the divided
waters came down on the deck above like a volley of buckshot Followed
the woolly sound of the cable in the hawsehole and a grunt and squeal
of the windlass a yaw a punt and a kick and the _Were Here_
gathered herself together to repeat the motions

Now ashore he heard Long Jack saying yeve chores an ye must do
thim in any weather Here were well clear of the fleet an weve no
choresan thats a blessin Good night all He passed like a big
snake from the table to his bunk and began to smoke Tom Platt
followed his example Uncle Salters with Penn fought his way up the
ladder to stand his watch and the cook set for the second half

It came out of its bunks as the others had entered theirs with a shake
and a yawn It ate till it could eat no more and then Manuel filled
his pipe with some terrible tobacco crotched himself between the
pawlpost and a forward bunk cocked his feet up on the table and
smiled tender and indolent smiles at the smoke Dan lay at length in
his bunk wrestling with a gaudy giltstopped accordion whose tunes
went up and down with the pitching of the _Were Here_ The cook his
shoulders against the locker where he kept the fried pies Dan was fond
of fried pies peeled potatoes with one eye on the stove in event of
too much water finding its way down the pipe and the general smell and
smother were past all description

Harvey considered affairs wondered that he was not deathly sick and
crawled into his bunk again as the softest and safest place while Dan
struck up I dont want to play in your yard as accurately as the
wild jerks allowed

How long is this for Harvey asked of Manuel

Till she get a little quiet and we can row to trawl Perhaps
tonight Perhaps two days more You do not like Eh whaat

I should have been crazy sick a week ago but it doesnt seem to upset
me nowmuch

That is because we make you fisherman these days If I was you when
I come to Gloucester I would give two three big candles for my good
luck

Give who

To be surethe Virgin of our Church on the Hill She is very good to
fishermen all the time That is why so few of us Portugee men ever are
drowned

Youre a Roman Catholic then

I am a Madeira man I am not a Porto Pico boy Shall I be Baptist
then Eh whaat I always give candlestwo three more when I come to
Gloucester The good Virgin she never forgets me Manuel

I dont sense it that way Tom Platt put in from his bunk his
scarred face lit up by the glare of a match as he sucked at his pipe
It stands to reason the seas the sea and youll get jest about
whats goin candles or kerosene fer that matter

Tis a mighty good thing said Long Jack to have a frind at coort
though Im o Manuels way o thinkin About tin years back I was crew
to a Sou Boston marketboat We was off Minots Ledge wid a
northeaster butt first atop of us thickern burgoo The ould man was
dhrunk his chin waggin on the tiller an I sez to myself If iver I
stick my boathuk into Twharf again Ill show the saints fwhat manner
o craft they saved me out av Now Im here as ye can well see an
the model of the dhirty ould Kathleen that took me a month to make I
gave ut to the priest an he hung ut up forninst the altar Theres
more sense in givin a model thats by way o bein a work av art than
any candle Ye can buy candles at store but a model shows the good
saints yeve tuk trouble an are grateful

Dyou believe that Irish said Tom Platt turning on his elbow

Would I do ut if I did not Ohio

Waal Enoch Fuller he made a model o the old Ohio and shes to
Calem museum now Mighty pretty model too but I guess Enoch he never
done it fer no sacrifice an the way I take it is

There were the makings of an hourlong discussion of the kind that
fishermen love where the talk runs in shouting circles and no one
proves anything at the end had not Dan struck up this cheerful rhyme

 Up jumped the mackerel with his striped back
 Reef in the mainsail and haul on the tack
 _For_ its windy weather

Here Long Jack joined in

 _And_ its blowy weather
 _When_ the winds begin to blow pipe all hands together

Dan went on with a cautious look at Tom Platt holding the accordion
low in the bunk

 Up jumped the cod with his chucklehead
 Went to the mainchains to heave at the lead
 _For_ its windy weather etc

Tom Platt seemed to be hunting for something Dan crouched lower but
sang louder

 Up jumped the flounder that swims to the ground
 Chucklehead Chucklehead Mind where ye sound

Tom Platts huge rubber boot whirled across the focsle and caught
Dans uplifted arm There was war between the man and the boy ever
since Dan had discovered that the mere whistling of that tune would
make him angry as he heaved the lead

Thought Id fetch yer said Dan returning the gift with precision
Ef you dont like my music git out your fiddle I aint goin to lie
here all day an listen to you an Long Jack arguin baout candles
Fiddle Tom Platt or Ill learn Harve here the tune

Tom Platt leaned down to a locker and brought up an old white fiddle
Manuels eye glistened and from somewhere behind the pawlpost he drew
out a tiny guitarlike thing with wire strings which he called a
machette

Tis a concert said Long Jack beaming through the smoke A reglar
Boston concert

There was a burst of spray as the hatch opened and Disko in yellow
oilskins descended

Yere just in time Disko Fwhats she doin outside

Jest this He dropped on to the lockers with the push and heave of
the _Were Here_

Were singin to kape our breakfasts down Yell lead av course
Disko said Long Jack

Guess there aint moren baout two old songs I know an yeve heerd
them both

His excuses were cut short by Tom Platt launching into a most dolorous
tune like unto the moaning of winds and the creaking of masts With
his eyes fixed on the beams above Disko began this ancient ancient
ditty Tom Platt flourishing all round him to make the tune and words
fit a little

 There is a crack packetcrack packet o fame
 She hails from Noo York an the _Dreadnoughts_ her name
 You may talk o your fliersSwallowtail and Black Ball
 But the _Dreadnoughts_ the packet that can beat them all
 Now the _Dreadnought_ she lies in the River Mersey
 Because of the tugboat to take her to sea
 But when shes off soundings you shortly will know

Chorus

 Shes the Liverpool packetO Lord let her go

 Now the _Dreadnought_ shes howlin crost the Banks o Newfoundland
 Where the waters all shallow and the bottoms all sand
 Sez all the little fishes that swim to and fro

Chorus

 Shes the Liverpool packetO Lord let her go

There were scores of verses for he worked the _Dreadnought_ every mile
of the way between Liverpool and New York as conscientiously as though
he were on her deck and the accordion pumped and the fiddle squeaked
beside him Tom Platt followed with something about the rough and
tough McGinn who would pilot the vessel in Then they called on
Harvey who felt very flattered to contribute to the entertainment
but all that he could remember were some pieces of Skipper Iresons
Ride that he had been taught at the campschool in the Adirondacks It
seemed that they might be appropriate to the time and place but he had
no more than mentioned the title when Disko brought down one foot with
a bang and cried Dont go on young feller Thats a mistaken
jedgmentone o the worst kind too becaze its catchin to the ear

I orter ha warned you said Dan Thet allus fetches Dad

Whats wrong said Harvey surprised and a little angry

All youre goin to say said Disko All dead wrong from start to
finish an Whittier hes to blame I have no special call to right any
Marblehead man but twerent no fault o Iresons My father he told
me the tale time an again an this is the way twuz

For the wan hundredth time put in Long Jack under his breath

Ben Ireson he was skipper o the Betty young feller comin home frum
the Banksthat was before the war of 1812 but jestice is jestice at
all times They fund the Active o Portland an Gibbons o that town
he was her skipper they fund her leakin off Cape Cod Light There was
a terrble gale on an they was gettin the Betty home s fast as they
could craowd her Well Ireson he said there warnt any sense to
reskin a boat in that sea the men they wouldnt hev it and he laid
it before them to stay by the Active till the sea run daown a piece
They wouldnt hev that either hangin araound the Cape in any sech
weather leak or no leak They jest up staysl an quit natrally
takin Ireson with em Folks to Marblehead was mad at him not runnin
the risk and becaze nex day when the sea was caam they never
stopped to think o that some of the Actives folks was took off by a
Truro man They come into Marblehead with their own tale to tell
sayin how Ireson had shamed his town an so forth an so on an
Iresons men they was scared seein public feelin agin em an they
went back on Ireson an swore he was responsble for the hull act
Twerent the women neither that tarred and feathered himMarblehead
women dont act that waytwas a passel o men an boys an they
carted him araound town in an old dory till the bottom fell aout and
Ireson he told em theyd be sorry for it some day Well the facts
come aout later sames they usually do too late to be any ways useful
to an honest man an Whittier he come along an picked up the slack
eend of a lyin tale an tarred and feathered Ben Ireson all over onct
more after he was dead Twas the only tune Whittier ever slipped up
an twerent fair I whaled Dan good when he brought that piece back
from school You dont know no better o course but Ive give you the
facts hereafter an evermore to be remembered Ben Ireson werent no
sech kind o man as Whittier makes aout my father he knew him well
before an after that business an you beware o hasty jedgments
young feller Next

Harvey had never heard Disko talk so long and collapsed with burning
cheeks but as Dan said promptly a boy could only learn what he was
taught at school and life was too short to keep track of every lie
along the coast

Then Manuel touched the jangling jarring little machette to a queer
tune and sang something in Portuguese about Nina innocente ending
with a fullhanded sweep that brought the song up with a jerk Then
Disko obliged with his second song to an oldfashioned creaky tune
and all joined in the chorus This is one stanza

 Now Aprile is over and melted the snow
 And outer Noo Bedford we shortly must tow
 Yes out o Noo Bedford we shortly must clear
 Were the whalers that never see wheat in the ear

Here the fiddle went very softly for a while by itself and then

 Wheatintheear my trueloves posy blowin
 Wheatintheear were goin off to sea
 Wheatintheear I left you fit for sowin
 When I come back a loaf o bread youll be

That made Harvey almost weep though he could not tell why But it was
much worse when the cook dropped the potatoes and held out his hands
for the fiddle Still leaning against the locker door he struck into a
tune that was like something very bad but sure to happen whatever you
did After a little he sang in an unknown tongue his big chin down on
the fiddletail his white eyeballs glaring in the lamplight Harvey
swung out of his bunk to hear better and amid the straining of the
timbers and the wash of the waters the tune crooned and moaned on like
lee surf in a blind fog till it ended with a wail

Jimmy Christmas Thet gives me the blue creevles said Dan What in
thunder is it

The song of Fin McCoul said the cook when he wass going to
Norway His English was not thick but all clearcut as though it
came from a phonograph

Faith Ive been to Norway but I didnt make that unwholesim noise
Tis like some of the old songs though said Long Jack sighing

Dont lets hev another thout somethin between said Dan and the
accordion struck up a rattling catchy tune that ended

 Its six an twenty Sundays sence las we saw the land
 With fifteen hunder quintal
 An fifteen hunder quintal
 Teen hunder toppin quintal
 Twix old Queereau an Grand

Hold on roared Tom Platt Dye want to nail the trip Dan Thats
Jonah sure less you sing it after all our salts wet

No taint is it Dad Not unless you sing the very las verse You
cant learn me anything on Jonahs

Whats that said Harvey Whats a Jonah

A Jonahs anything that spoils the luck Sometimes its a
mansometimes its a boyor a bucket Ive known a splittinknife
Jonah two trips till we was on to her said Tom Platt Theres all
sorts o Jonahs Jim Bourke was one till he was drowned on Georges Id
never ship with Jim Bourke not if I was starvin There wuz a green
dory on the Ezra Flood Thet was a Jonah too the worst sort o Jonah
Drowned four men she did an used to shine fiery O nights in the
nest

And you believe that said Harvey remembering what Tom Platt had
said about candles and models Havent we all got to take whats
served

A mutter of dissent ran round the bunks Outboard yes inboard
things can happen said Disko Dont you go makin a mock of Jonahs
young feller

Well Harve aint no Jonah Day after we catched him Dan cut in we
had a toppin good catch

The cook threw up his head and laughed suddenlya queer thin laugh
He was a most disconcerting nigger

Murder said Long Jack Dont do that again doctor We aint used
to ut

Whats wrong said Dan Aint he our mascot and didnt they strike
on good after wed struck him

Oh yess said the cook I know that but the catch iss not finish
yet

He aint goin to do us any harm said Dan hotly Where are ye
hintin an edgin to Hes all right

No harm No But one day he will be your master Danny

That all said Dan placidly He wuntnot by a jugful

Master said the cook pointing to Harvey Man and he pointed to
Dan

Thats news Haow soon said Dan with a laugh

In some years and I shall see it Master and manman and master

How in thunder dye work that out said Tom Platt

In my head where I can see

Haow This from all the others at once

I do not know but so it will be He dropped his head and went on
peeling the potatoes and not another word could they get out of him

Well said Dan a heap o thingsll hev to come abaout fore Harves
any master o mine but Im glad the doctor aint choosen to mark him
for a Jonah Now I mistrust Uncle Salters fer the Jonerest Jonah in
the Fleet regardin his own special luck Dunno ef its spreadin
sames smallpox He ought to be on the _Carrie Pitman_ That boats her
own Jonah surecrews an gear made no differ to her driftin Jiminy
Christmas Shell etch loose in a flat caam

Were well clear o the Fleet anyway said Disko _Carrie Pitman_ an
all There was a rapping on the deck

Uncle Salters has catched his luck said Dan as his father departed

Its blown clear Disko cried and all the focsle tumbled up for a
bit of fresh air The fog had gone but a sullen sea ran in great
rollers behind it The _Were Here_ slid as it were into long sunk
avenues and ditches which felt quite sheltered and homelike if they
would only stay still but they changed without rest or mercy and
flung up the schooner to crown one peak of a thousand gray hills while
the wind hooted through her rigging as she zigzagged down the slopes
Far away a sea would burst into a sheet of foam and the others would
follow suit as at a signal till Harveys eyes swam with the vision of
interlacing whites and grays Four or five Mother Careys chickens
stormed round in circles shrieking as they swept past the bows A
rainsquall or two strayed aimlessly over the hopeless waste ran down
wind and back again and melted away

Seems to me I saw somethin flicker jest naow over yonder said Uncle
Salters pointing to the northeast

Cant be any of the fleet said Disko peering under his eyebrows a
hand on the focsle gangway as the solid bows hatcheted into the
troughs Seas oilin over dretful fast Danny dont you want to skip
up a piece an see how aour trawlbuoy lays

Danny in his big boots trotted rather than climbed up the main
rigging this consumed Harvey with envy hitched himself around the
reeling crosstrees and let his eye rove till it caught the tiny black
buoyflag on the shoulder of a mileaway swell

Shes all right he hailed Sail O Dead to the nothard comin
down like smoke Schooner she be too

They waited yet another halfhour the sky clearing in patches with a
flicker of sickly sun from time to time that made patches of
olivegreen water Then a stumpforemast lifted ducked and
disappeared to be followed on the next wave by a high stern with
oldfashioned wooden snailshorn davits The snails were redtanned

Frenchmen shouted Dan No taint neither Daad

Thats no French said Disko Salters your blame luck holds
tightern a screw in a keghead

Ive eyes Its Uncle Abishai

You cant nowise tell fer sure

The headking of all Jonahs groaned Tom Platt Oh Salters
Salters why wasnt you abed an asleep

How could I tell said poor Salters as the schooner swung up

She might have been the very Flying Dutchman so foul draggled and
unkempt was every rope and stick aboard Her oldstyle quarterdeck was
some or five feet high and her rigging flew knotted and tangled like
weed at a wharfend She was running before the windyawing
frightfullyher staysail let down to act as a sort of extra
foresailscandalized they call itand her foreboom guyed out
over the side Her bowsprit cocked up like an oldfashioned frigates
her jibboom had been fished and spliced and nailed and clamped beyond
further repair and as she hove herself forward and sat down on her
broad tail she looked for all the world like a blouzy frouzy bad old
woman sneering at a decent girl

Thats Abishai said Salters Full o gin an Judique men an the
judgments o Providence layin fer him an never takin good holt Hes
run in to bait Miquelon way

Hell run her under said Long Jack Thats no rig fer this weather

Not he r heda done it long ago Disko replied Looks s if he
callated to run us under Aint she daown by the head more n natural
Tom Platt

Ef its his style o loadin her she aint safe said the sailor
slowly Ef shes spewed her oakum hed better git to his pumps mighty
quick

The creature threshed up wore round with a clatter and raffle and lay
head to wind within earshot

A graybeard wagged over the bulwark and a thick voice yelled
something Harvey could not understand But Diskos face darkened Hed
resk every stick he hez to carry bad news Says were in fer a shift o
wind Hes in fer worse Abishai Abishai He waved his arm up and
down with the gesture of a man at the pumps and pointed forward The
crew mocked him and laughed

Jounce ye an strip ye an trip ye yelled Uncle Abishai A livin
galea livin gale Yab Cast up fer your last trip all you
Gloucester haddocks You wont see Gloucester no more no more

Crazy fullas usual said Tom Platt Wish he hadnt spied us
though

She drifted out of hearing while the grayhead yelled something about a
dance at the Bay of Bulls and a dead man in the focsle Harvey
shuddered He had seen the sloven tilled decks and the savageeyed crew

An thats a fine little floatin hell fer her draught said Long
Jack I wondher what mischief hes been at ashore

Hes a trawler Dan explained to Harvey an he runs in fer bait all
along the coast Oh no not home he dont go He deals along the
south an east shore up yonder He nodded in the direction of the
pitiless Newfoundland beaches Dad wont never take me ashore there
Theyre a mighty tough crowdan Abishais the toughest You saw his
boat Well shes nigh seventy year old they say the last o the old
Marblehead heeltappers They dont make them quarterdecks any more
Abishai dont use Marblehead though He aint wanted there He jes
drifs araound in debt trawlin an cussin like youve heard Bin a
Jonah fer years an years he hez Gits liquor frum the Feecamp boats
fer makin spells an selling winds an such truck Crazy I guess

Twont be any use underrunnin the trawl tonight said Tom Platt
with quiet despair He come alongside special to cuss us Id give my
wage an share to see him at the gangway o the old Ohio fore we quit
floggin Jest abaout six dozen an Sam Mocatta layin em on
crisscross

The disheveled heeltapper danced drunkenly down wind and all eyes
followed her Suddenly the cook cried in his phonograph voice It wass
his own death made him speak so He iss feyfey I tell you Look
She sailed into a patch of watery sunshine three or four miles distant
The patch dulled and faded out and even as the light passed so did the
schooner She dropped into a hollow andwas not

Run under by the Great HookBlock shouted Disko jumping aft
Drunk or sober weve got to help em Heave short and break her out
Smart

Harvey was thrown on the deck by the shock that followed the setting of
the jib and foresail for they hove short on the cable and to save
time jerked the anchor bodily from the bottom heaving in as they
moved away This is a bit of brute force seldom resorted to except in
matters of life and death and the little _Were Here_ complained like
a human They ran down to where Abishais craft had vanished found two
or three trawltubs a ginbottle and a stovein dory but nothing
more Let em go said Disko though no one had hinted at picking
them up I wouldnt hev a match that belonged to Abishai aboard Guess
she run clear under Must ha been spewin her oakum fer a week an
they never thought to pump her Thats one more boat gone along o
leavin port all hands drunk

Glory be said Long Jack Wed ha been obliged to help em if they
was top o water

Thinkin o that myself said Tom Platt

Fey Fey said the cook rolling his eyes He haas taken his own
luck with him

Ver good thing I think to tell the Fleet when we see Eh whaat
said Manuel If you runna that way before the wind and she work open
her seams He threw out his hands with an indescribable gesture
while Penn sat down on the house and sobbed at the sheer horror and
pity of it all Harvey could not realize that he had seen death on the
open waters but he felt very sick Then Dan went up the crosstrees
and Disko steered them back to within sight of their own trawlbuoys
just before the fog blanketed the sea once again

We go mighty quick hereabouts when we do go was all he said to
Harvey You think on that fer a spell young feller That was liquor

After dinner it was calm enough to fish from the decksPenn and
Uncle Salters were very zealous this timeand the catch was large and
large fish

Abishai has shorely took his luck with him said Salters The wind
haint backed ner riz ner nothin How abaout the trawl I despise
superstition anyway

Tom Platt insisted that they had much better haul the thing and make a
new berth But the cook said The luck iss in two pieces You will
find it so when you look I know This so tickled Long Jack that he
overbore Tom Platt and the two went out together

Underrunning a trawl means pulling it in on one side of the dory
picking off the fish rebaiting the hooks and passing them back to the
sea againsomething like pinning and unpinning linen on a washline
It is a lengthy business and rather dangerous for the long sagging
line may twitch a boat under in a flash But when they heard And naow
to thee O Capting booming out of the fog the crew of the _Were
Here_ took heart The dory swirled alongside well loaded Tom Platt
yelling for Manuel to act as reliefboat

The lucks cut square in two pieces said Long Jack forking in the
fish while Harvey stood openmouthed at the skill with which the
plunging dory was saved from destruction One half was jest punkins
Tom Platt wanted to haul her an ha done wid ut but I said Ill
back the doctor that has the second sight an the other half come up
sagging full o big uns Hurry Mannle an brings a tub o bait
Theres luck afloat tonight

The fish bit at the newly baited hooks from which their brethren had
just been taken and Tom Platt and Long Jack moved methodically up and
down the length of the trawl the boats nose surging under the wet
line of hooks stripping the seacucumbers that they called pumpkins
slatting off the freshcaught cod against the gunwale rebaiting and
loading Manuels dory till dusk

Ill take no risks said Disko thennot with him floatin around so
near Abishai wont sink fer a week Heave in the dories an well
dress daown after supper

That was a mighty dressingdown attended by three or four blowing
grampuses It lasted till nine oclock and Disko was thrice heard to
chuckle as Harvey pitched the split fish into the hold

Say youre haulin ahead dretful fast said Dan when they ground
the knives after the men had turned in Theres somethin of a sea
tonight an I haint heard you make no remarks on it

Too busy Harvey replied testing a blades edge Come to think of
it she is a highkicker

The little schooner was gambolling all around her anchor among the
silvertipped waves Backing with a start of affected surprise at the
sight of the strained cable she pounced on it like a kitten while the
spray of her descent burst through the hawseholes with the report of a
gun Shaking her head she would say Well Im sorry I cant stay any
longer with you Im going North and would sidle off halting
suddenly with a dramatic rattle of her rigging As I was just going to
observe she would begin as gravely as a drunken man addressing a
lamppost The rest of the sentence she acted her words in dumbshow
of course was lost in a fit of the fidgets when she behaved like a
puppy chewing a string a clumsy woman in a sidesaddle a hen with her
head cut off or a cow stung by a hornet exactly as the whims of the
sea took her

See her sayin her piece Shes Patrick Henry naow said Dan

She swung sideways on a roller and gesticulated with her jibboom from
port to starboard

Butezfer me give me libertyer give medeath

Wop She sat down in the moonpath on the water courtesying with a
flourish of pride impressive enough had not the wheelgear sniggered
mockingly in its box

Harvey laughed aloud Why its just as if she was alive he said

Shes as stiddy as a haouse an as dry as a herrin said Dan
enthusiastically as he was slung across the deck in a batter of spray
Fends em off an fends em off an Dont ye come anigh me she
sez Look at herjest look at her Sakes You should see one o them
toothpicks histin up her anchor on her spike outer fifteenfathom
water

Whats a toothpick Dan

Them new haddockers an herrinboats Fines a yacht forward with
yacht sterns to em an spike bowsprits an a haouse that ud take
our hold Ive heard that Burgess himself he made the models fer three
or four of em Dads sot agin em on account o their pitchin an
joltin but theres heaps o money in em Dad can find fish but he
aint no ways progressivehe dont go with the march o the times
Theyre chockfull o laboursavin jigs an sech all Ever seed the
Elector o Gloucester Shes a daisy ef she is a toothpick

What do they cost Dan

Hills o dollars Fifteen thousand phaps more mebbe Theres
goldleaf an everything you kin think of Then to himself half under
his breath Guess Id call her Hattie S too



CHAPTER V

That was the first of many talks with Dan who told Harvey why he would
transfer his dorys name to the imaginary Burgessmodelled haddocker
Harvey heard a good deal about the real Hattie at Gloucester saw a
lock of her hairwhich Dan finding fair words of no avail had
hooked as she sat in front of him at school that winterand a
photograph Hattie was about fourteen years old with an awful contempt
for boys and had been trampling on Dans heart through the winter All
this was revealed under oath of solemn secrecy on moonlit decks in the
dead dark or in choking fog the whining wheel behind them the
climbing deck before and without the unresting clamorous sea Once
of course as the boys came to know each other there was a fight
which raged from bow to stern till Penn came up and separated them but
promised not to tell Disko who thought fighting on watch rather worse
than sleeping Harvey was no match for Dan physically but it says a
great deal for his new training that he took his defeat and did not try
to get even with his conqueror by underhand methods

That was after he had been cured of a string of boils between his
elbows and wrists where the wet jersey and oilskins cut into the
flesh The salt water stung them unpleasantly but when they were ripe
Dan treated them with Diskos razor and assured Harvey that now he was
a blooded Banker the affliction of gurrysores being the mark of the
caste that claimed him

Since he was a boy and very busy he did not bother his head with too
much thinking He was exceedingly sorry for his mother and often
longed to see her and above all to tell her of this wonderful new life
and how brilliantly he was acquitting himself in it Otherwise he
preferred not to wonder too much how she was bearing the shock of his
supposed death But one day as he stood on the focsle ladder guying
the cook who had accused him and Dan of hooking fried pies it
occurred to him that this was a vast improvement on being snubbed by
strangers in the smokingroom of a hired liner

He was a recognized part of the scheme of things on the Were Here had
his place at the table and among the bunks and could hold his own in
the long talks on stormy days when the others were always ready to
listen to what they called his fairytales of his life ashore It did
not take him more than two days and a quarter to feel that if he spoke
of his own lifeit seemed very far awayno one except Dan and even
Dans belief was sorely tried credited him So he invented a friend a
boy he had heard of who drove a miniature fourpony drag in Toledo
Ohio and ordered five suits of clothes at a time and led things called
germans at parties where the oldest girl was not quite fifteen but
all the presents were solid silver Salters protested that this kind of
yarn was desperately wicked if not indeed positively blasphemous but
he listened as greedily as the others and their criticisms at the end
gave Harvey entirely new notions on germans clothes cigarettes with
goldleaf tips rings watches scent small dinnerparties champagne
cardplaying and hotel accommodation Little by little he changed his
tone when speaking of his friend whom Long Jack had christened the
Crazy Kid the Giltedged Baby the Suckin Vanderpoop and other
pet names and with his seabooted feet cocked up on the table would
even invent histories about silk pajamas and specially imported
neckwear to the friends discredit Harvey was a very adaptable
person with a keen eye and ear for every face and tone about him

Before long he knew where Disko kept the old greencrusted quadrant that
they called the hogyokeunder the bedbag in his bunk When he took
the sun and with the help of The Old Farmers almanac found the
latitude Harvey would jump down into the cabin and scratch the
reckoning and date with a nail on the rust of the stovepipe Now the
chief engineer of the liner could have done no more and no engineer of
thirty years service could have assumed one half of the
ancientmariner air with which Harvey first careful to spit over the
side made public the schooners position for that day and then and
not till then relieved Disko of the quadrant There is an etiquette in
all these things

The said hogyoke an Eldridge chart the farming almanac Blunts
Coast Pilot and Bowditchs Navigator were all the weapons Disko
needed to guide him except the deepsea lead that was his spare eye
Harvey nearly slew Penn with it when Tom Platt taught him first how to
fly the blue pigeon and though his strength was not equal to
continuous sounding in any sort of a sea for calm weather with a
sevenpound lead on shoal water Disko used him freely As Dan said

Taint soundins dad wants Its samples Grease her up good Harve
Harvey would tallow the cup at the end and carefully bring the sand
shell sludge or whatever it might be to Disko who fingered and
smelt it and gave judgment As has been said when Disko thought of cod
he thought as a cod and by some longtested mixture of instinct and
experience moved the Were Here from berth to berth always with the
fish as a blindfolded chessplayer moves on the unseen board

But Diskos board was the Grand Banka triangle two hundred and fifty
miles on each sidea waste of wallowing sea cloaked with dank fog
vexed with gales harried with drifting ice scored by the tracks of
the reckless liners and dotted with the sails of the fishingfleet

For days they worked in fogHarvey at the belltill grown familiar
with the thick airs he went out with Tom Platt his heart rather in
his mouth But the fog would not lift and the fish were biting and no
one can stay helplessly afraid for six hours at a time Harvey devoted
himself to his lines and the gaff or gobstick as Tom Platt called for
them and they rowed back to the schooner guided by the bell and Toms
instinct Manuels conch sounding thin and faint beside them But it
was an unearthly experience and for the first time in a month Harvey
dreamed of the shifting smoking floors of water round the dory the
lines that strayed away into nothing and the air above that melted on
the sea below ten feet from his straining eyes A few days later he was
out with Manuel on what should have been fortyfathom bottom but the
whole length of the roding ran out and still the anchor found nothing
and Harvey grew mortally afraid for that his last touch with earth was
lost Whalehole said Manuel hauling in That is good joke on
Disko Come and he rowed to the schooner to find Tom Platt and the
others jeering at the skipper because for once he had led them to the
edge of the barren Whaledeep the blank hole of the Grand Bank They
made another berth through the fog and that time the hair of Harveys
head stood up when he went out in Manuels dory A whiteness moved in
the whiteness of the fog with a breath like the breath of the grave
and there was a roaring a plunging and spouting It was his first
introduction to the dread summer berg of the Banks and he cowered in
the bottom of the boat while Manuel laughed There were days though
clear and soft and warm when it seemed a sin to do anything but loaf
over the handlines and spank the drifting sunscalds with an oar
and there were days of light airs when Harvey was taught how to steer
the schooner from one berth to another

It thrilled through him when he first felt the keel answer to his band
on the spokes and slide over the long hollows as the foresail scythed
back and forth against the blue sky That was magnificent in spite of
Disko saying that it would break a snakes back to follow his wake
But as usual pride ran before a fall They were sailing on the wind
with the staysailan old one luckilyset and Harvey jammed her
right into it to show Dan how completely he had mastered the art The
foresail went over with a bang and the foregaff stabbed and ripped
through the staysail which was of course prevented from going over
by the mainstay They lowered the wreck in awful silence and Harvey
spent his leisure hours for the next few days under Tom Platts lee
learning to use a needle and palm Dan hooted with joy for as he
said he had made the very same blunder himself in his early days

Boylike Harvey imitated all the men by turns till he had combined
Diskos peculiar stoop at the wheel Long Jacks swinging overhand when
the lines were hauled Manuels roundshouldered but effective stroke
in a dory and Tom Platts generous Ohio stride along the deck

Tis beautiful to see how he takes to ut said Long Jack when Harvey
was looking out by the windlass one thick noon Ill lay my wage an
share tis moren half playactin to him an he consates himself hes
a bowld mariner Watch his little bit av a back now

Thats the way we all begin said Tom Platt The boys they make
believe all the time till theyve cheated emselves into bein men an
so till they diepretendin an pretendin I done it on the old Ohio
I know Stood my first watchharborwatchfeelin finern Farragut
Dans full o the same kind o notions See em now actin to be
genewine mossbacksvery hair a ropeyarn an blood Stockholm tar He
spoke down the cabin stairs Guess youre mistook in your judgments
fer once Disko What in Rome made ye tell us all here the kid was
crazy

He wuz Disko replied Crazy ez a loon when he come aboard but Ill
say hes sobered up considble sence I cured him

He yarns good said Tom Platt Tother night he told us abaout a kid
of his own size steerin a cunnin little rig an four ponies up an
down Toledo Ohio I think twas an givin suppers to a crowd o
simlar kids Curus kind o fairytale but blame interestin He
knows scores of em

Guess he strikes em outen his own head Disko called from the cabin
where he was busy with the logbook Stands to reason that sort is all
made up It dont take in no one but Dan an he laughs at it Ive
heard him behind my back

Yever hear what Simon Peter Cahoun said when they whacked up a match
twix his sister Hitty an Lorin Jerauld an the boys put up that
joke on him daown to Georges drawled Uncle Salters who was dripping
peaceably under the lee of the starboard dorynest

Tom Platt puffed at his pipe in scornful silence he was a Cape Cod
man and had not known that tale more than twenty years Uncle Salters
went on with a rasping chuckie

Simon Peter Cahoun he said an he was jest right abaout Lorin
Haaf on the taown he said an tother haaf blame fool an they
told me shes married a ich man Simon Peter Cahoun he hednt no
roof to his mouth an talked that way

He didnt talk any Pennsylvania Dutch Tom Platt replied Youd
better leave a Cape man to tell that tale The Cahouns was gypsies
frum way back

Wal I dont profess to be any elocutionist Salters said Im
comin to the moral o things Thats jest abaout what aour Harve be
Haaf on the taown an tother haaf blame fool an theres somell
believe hes a rich man Yah

Did ye ever think how sweet twould be to sail wid a full crew o
Salterses said Long Jack Haaf in the furrer an other haaf in the
muckheap as Cahoun did not say an makes out hes a fisherman

A little laugh went round at Salterss expense

Disko held his tongue and wrought over the logbook that he kept in a
hatchetfaced square hand this was the kind of thing that ran on
page after soiled page

July 17 This day thick fog and few fish Made berth to northward So
ends this day

July 18 This day comes in with thick fog Caught a few fish

July 19 This day comes in with light breeze from NE and fine
weather Made a berth to eastward Caught plenty fish

July 20 This the Sabbath comes in with fog and light winds So ends
this day Total fish caught this week 3478

They never worked on Sundays but shaved and washed themselves if it
were fine and Pennsylvania sang hymns Once or twice he suggested
that if it was not an impertinence he thought he could preach a
little Uncle Salters nearly jumped down his throat at the mere notion
reminding him that he was not a preacher and mustnt think of such
things Wed hev him rememberin Johnstown next Salters explained
an what would happen then so they compromised on his reading aloud
from a book called Josephus It was an old leatherbound volume
smelling of a hundred voyages very solid and very like the Bible but
enlivened with accounts of battles and sieges and they read it nearly
from cover to cover Otherwise Penn was a silent little body He would
not utter a word for three days on end sometimes though he played
checkers listened to the songs and laughed at the stories When they
tried to stir him up he would answer I dont wish to seem
unneighbourly but it is because I have nothing to say My head feels
quite empty Ive almost forgotten my name He would turn to Uncle
Salters with an expectant smile

Why Pennsylvania Pratt Salters would shout Youll fergit me next

Nonever Penn would say shutting his lips firmly Pennsylvania
Pratt of course he would repeat over and over Sometimes it was
Uncle Salters who forgot and told him he was Haskins or Rich or
McVitty but Penn was equally contenttill next time

He was always very tender with Harvey whom he pitied both as a lost
child and as a lunatic and when Salters saw that Penn liked the boy
he relaxed too Salters was not an amiable person He esteemed it his
business to keep the boys in order and the first time Harvey in fear
and trembling on a still day managed to shin up to the maintruck
Dan was behind him ready to help he esteemed it his duty to hang
Salterss big seaboots up therea sight of shame and derision to the
nearest schooner With Disko Harvey took no liberties not even when
the old man dropped direct orders and treated him like the rest of
the crew to Dont you want to do so and so and Guess youd
better and so forth There was something about the cleanshaven lips
and the puckered corners of the eyes that was mightily sobering to
young blood

Disko showed him the meaning of the thumbed and pricked chart which
he said laid over any government publication whatsoever led him
pencil in hand from berth to berth over the whole string of banksLe
Have Western Banquereau St Pierre Green and Grandtalking cod
meantime Taught him too the principle on which the hogyoke was
worked

In this Harvey excelled Dan for he had inherited a head for figures
and the notion of stealing information from one glimpse of the sullen
Bank sun appealed to all his keen wits For other seamatters his age
handicapped him As Disko said he should have begun when he was ten
Dan could bait up trawl or lay his hand on any rope in the dark and at
a pinch when Uncle Salters had a gurryscore on his palm could dress
down by sense of touch He could steer in anything short of half a gale
from the feel of the wind on his face humouring the _Were Here_ just
when she needed it These things he did as automatically as he skipped
about the rigging or made his dory a part of his own will and body
But he could not communicate his knowledge to Harvey

Still there was a good deal of general information flying about the
schooner on stormy days when they lay up in the focsle or sat on the
cabin lockers while spare eyebolts leads and rings rolled and
rattled in the pauses of the talk Disko spoke of whaling voyages in
the Fifties of great shewhales slain beside their young of death
agonies on the black tossing seas and blood that spurted forty feet in
the air of boats smashed to splinters of patent rockets that went off
wrongendfirst and bombarded the trembling crews of cuttingin and
boilingdown and that terrible nip of 71 when twelve hundred men
were made homeless on the ice in three dayswonderful tales all true
But more wonderful still were his stories of the cod and how they
argued and reasoned on their private businesses deep down below the
keel

Long Jacks tastes ran more to the supernatural He held them silent
with ghastly stories of the Yohoes on Monomoy Beach that mock and
terrify lonely clamdiggers of sandwalkers and dunehaunters who were
never properly buried of hidden treasure on Fire Island guarded by the
spirits of Kidds men of ships that sailed in the fog straight over
Truro township of that harbor in Maine where no one but a stranger
will lie at anchor twice in a certain place because of a dead crew who
row alongside at midnight with the anchor in the bow of their
oldfashioned boat whistlingnot calling but whistlingfor the soul
of the man who broke their rest

Harvey had a notion that the east coast of his native land from Mount
Desert south was populated chiefly by people who took their horses
there in the summer and entertained in countryhouses with hardwood
floors and Vantine portires He laughed at the ghosttalesnot as
much as he would have done a month beforebut ended by sitting still
and shuddering

Tom Platt dealt with his interminable trip round the Horn on the old
Ohio in flogging days with a navy more extinct than the dodothe navy
that passed away in the great war He told them how redhot shot are
dropped into a cannon a wad of wet clay between them and the
cartridge how they sizzle and reek when they strike wood and how the
little shipboys of the Miss Jim Buck hove water over them and shouted
to the fort to try again And he told tales of blockadelong weeks of
swaying at anchor varied only by the departure and return of steamers
that had used up their coal there was no chance for the
sailingships of gales and cold that kept two hundred men night and
day pounding and chopping at the ice on cable blocks and rigging
when the galley was as redhot as the forts shot and men drank cocoa
by the bucket Tom Platt had no use for steam His service closed when
that thing was comparatively new He admitted that it was a specious
invention in time of peace but looked hopefully for the day when sails
should come back again on tenthousandton frigates with
hundredandninetyfoot booms

Manuels talk was slow and gentleall about pretty girls in Madeira
washing clothes in the dry beds of streams by moonlight under waving
bananas legends of saints and tales of queer dances or fights away in
the cold Newfoundland baitingports Salters was mainly agricultural
for though he read Josephus and expounded it his mission in life
was to prove the value of green manures and specially of clover
against every form of phosphate whatsoever He grew libellous about
phosphates he dragged greasy Orange Judd books from his bunk and
intoned them wagging his finger at Harvey to whom it was all Greek
Little Penn was so genuinely pained when Harvey made fun of Salterss
lectures that the boy gave it up and suffered in polite silence That
was very good for Harvey

The cook naturally did not join in these conversations As a rule he
spoke only when it was absolutely necessary but at times a queer gift
of speech descended on him and he held forth half in Gaelic half in
broken English an hour at a time He was especially communicative with
the boys and he never withdrew his prophecy that one day Harvey would
be Dans master and that he would see it He told them of
mailcarrying in the winter up Cape Breton way of the dogtrain that
goes to Coudray and of the ramsteamer _Arctic_ that breaks the ice
between the mainland and Prince Edward Island Then he told them
stories that his mother had told him of life far to the southward
where water never froze and he said that when he died his soul would
go to lie down on a warm white beach of sand with palmtrees waving
above That seemed to the boys a very odd idea for a man who had never
seen a palm in his life Then too regularly at each meal he would
ask Harvey and Harvey alone whether the cooking was to his taste and
this always made the second half laugh Yet they had a great respect
for the cooks judgment and in their hearts considered Harvey
something of a mascot by consequence

And while Harvey was taking in knowledge of new things at each pore and
hard health with every gulp of the good air the Were Here went her
ways and did her business on the Bank and the silverygray kenches of
wellpressed fish mounted higher and higher in the hold No one days
work was out of common but the average days were many and close
together

Naturally a man of Diskos reputation was closely watchedscrowged
upon Dan called itby his neighbours but he had a very pretty knack
of giving them the slip through the curdling glidy fogbanks Disko
avoided company for two reasons He wished to make his own
experiments in the first place and in the second he objected to the
mixed gatherings of a fleet of all nations The bulk of them were
mainly Gloucester boats with a scattering from Provincetown Harwich
Chatham and some of the Maine ports but the crews drew from goodness
knows where Risk breeds recklessness and when greed is added there
are fine chances for every kind of accident in the crowded fleet
which like a mob of sheep is huddled round some unrecognized leader
Let the two Jeraulds lead em said Disko Were baound to lay among
em for a spell on the Eastern Shoals though ef luck holds we wont
hev to lay long Where we are naow Harve aint considered noways good
graound

Aint it said Harvey who was drawing water he had learned just how
to wiggle the bucket after an unusually long dressingdown
Shouldnt mind striking some poor ground for a change then

All the graound I want to seedont want to strike heris Eastern
Point said Dan Say Dad it lookss if we wouldnt hev to lay
moren two weeks on the Shoals Youll meet all the compny you want
then Harve Thats the time we begin to work No reglar meals fer no
one then Mugup when yere hungry an sleep when ye cant keep
awake Good job you wasnt picked up a month later than you was or
wed never ha had you dressed in shape fer the Old Virgin

Harvey understood from the Eldridge chart that the Old Virgin and a
nest of curiously named shoals were the turningpoint of the cruise
and that with good luck they would wet the balance of their salt there
But seeing the size of the Virgin it was one tiny dot he wondered
how even Disko with the hogyoke and the lead could find her He
learned later that Disko was entirely equal to that and any other
business and could even help others A big fourbyfive blackboard hung
in the cabin and Harvey never understood the need of it till after
some blinding thick days they heard the unmelodious tooting of a
footpower foghorna machine whose note is as that of a consumptive
elephant

They were making a short berth towing the anchor under their foot to
save trouble Squarerigger bellowin fer his latitude said Long
Jack The dripping red headsails of a bark glided out of the fog and
the _Were Here_ rang her bell thrice using sea shorthand

The larger boat backed her topsail with shrieks and shoutings

Frenchman said Uncle Salters scornfully Miquelon boat from St
Malo The farmer had a weatherly seaeye Im most outer baccy
too Disko

Same here said Tom Platt Hi Backez vousbackez vous Standez
awayez you buttended muchobono Where you fromSt Malo eh

Ah ha Mucho bono Oui oui Clos PouletSt Malo St Pierre et
Miquelon cried the other crowd waving woollen caps and laughing
Then all together Bord Bord

Bring up the board Danny Beats me how them Frenchmen fetch
anywheres exceptin Americas fairish broadly Fortysix fortynines
good enough fer them an I guess its abaout right too

Dan chalked the figures on the board and they hung it in the
mainrigging to a chorus of mercis from the bark

Seems kinder uneighbourly to let em swedge off like this Salters
suggested feeling in his pockets

Hev ye learned French then sence last trip said Disko I dont want
no more stoneballast hove at us long o your callin Miquelon boats
footy cochins sames you did off Le Have

Harmon Rush he said that was the way to rise em Plain United States
is good enough fer me Were all dretful short on terbakker Young
feller dont you speak French

Oh yes said Harvey valiantly and he bawled Hi Say Arretez
vous Attendez Nous sommes venant pour tabac

Ah tabac tabac they cried and laughed again

That hit em Lets heave a dory over anyway said Tom Platt I
dont exactly hold no certificates on French but I know another lingo
that goes I guess Come on Harve an interpret

The raffle and confusion when he and Harvey were hauled up the barks
black side was indescribable Her cabin was all stuck round with
glaring coloured prints of the Virginthe Virgin of Newfoundland they
called her Harvey found his French of no recognized Bank brand and
his conversation was limited to nods and grins But Tom Platt waved his
arms and got along swimmingly The captain gave him a drink of
unspeakable gin and the operacomique crew with their hairy throats
red caps and long knives greeted him as a brother Then the trade
began They had tobacco plenty of itAmerican that had never paid
duty to France They wanted chocolate and crackers Harvey rowed back
to arrange with the cook and Disko who owned the stores and on his
return the cocoatins and crackerbags were counted out by the
Frenchmans wheel It looked like a piratical division of loot but Tom
Platt came out of it roped with black pigtail and stuffed with cakes of
chewing and smoking tobacco Then those jovial mariners swung off into
the mist and the last Harvey heard was a gay chorus

 Par derriere chez ma tante
 Ily a un bois joli
 Et le rossignol y chante
 Et le jour et la nuit

 Que donneriez vous belle
 Qui lamenerait ici
 Je donnerai Quebec
 Sorel et Saint Denis

How was it my French didnt go and your signtalk did Harvey
demanded when the barter had been distributed among the Were Heres

Signtalk Platt guffawed Well yes twas signtalk but a heap
oldern your French Harve Them French boats are chockfull o
Freemasons an thats why

Are you a Freemason then

Looks that way dont it said the manowars man stuffing his
pipe and Harvey had another mystery of the deep sea to brood upon



CHAPTER VI

The thing that struck him most was the exceedingly casual way in which
some craft loafed about the broad Atlantic Fishingboats as Dan said
were naturally dependent on the courtesy and wisdom of their
neighbours but one expected better things of steamers That was after
another interesting interview when they had been chased for three
miles by a big lumbering old cattleboat all boarded over on the upper
deck that smelt like a thousand cattlepens A very excited officer
yelled at them through a speakingtrumpet and she lay and lollopped
helplessly on the water while Disko ran the _Were Here_ under her lee
and gave the skipper a piece of his mind Where might ye beeh Ye
dont deserve to be anywheres You barnyard tramps go hoggin the road
on the high seas with no blame consideration fer your neighbours an
your eyes in your coffeecups instid o in your silly heads

At this the skipper danced on the bridge and said something about
Diskos own eyes We havent had an observation for three days Dyou
suppose we can run her blind he shouted

Waal I can Disko retorted Whats come to your lead Et it Cant
ye smell bottom or are them cattle too rank

What d ye feed em said Uncle Salters with intense seriousness for
the smell of the pens woke all the farmer in him They say they fall
off dretful on a vyage Dunno as its any o my business but Ive a
kind o notion that oilcake broke small an sprinkled

Thunder said a cattleman in a red jersey as he looked over the
side What asylum did they let His Whiskers out of

Young feller Salters began standing up in the forerigging let me
tell yeou fore we go any further that Ive

The officer on the bridge took off his cap with immense politeness
Excuse me he said but Ive asked for my reckoning If the
agricultural person with the hair will kindly shut his head the
seagreen barnacle with the walleye may perhaps condescend to
enlighten us

Naow youve made a show o me Salters said Disko angrily He could
not stand up to that particular sort of talk and snapped out the
latitude and longitude without more lectures

Well thats a boatload of lunatics sure said the skipper as he
rang up the engineroom and tossed a bundle of newspapers into the
schooner

Of all the blamed fools next to you Salters him an his crowd are
abaout the likeliest Ive ever seen said Disko as the _Were Here_
slid away I was jest givin him my jedgment on lullsikin round these
waters like a lost child an you must cut in with your fool farmin
Cant ye never keep things seprate

Harvey Dan and the others stood back winking one to the other and
full of joy but Disko and Salters wrangled seriously till evening
Salters arguing that a cattleboat was practically a barn on blue
water and Disko insisting that even if this were the case decency
and fisherpride demanded that he should have kept things seprate
Long Jack stood it in silence for a timean angry skipper makes an
unhappy crewand then he spoke across the table after supper

Fwhats the good o bodderin fwhat theyll say said he

Theyll tell that tale agin us fer yearsthats all said Disko
Oilcake sprinkled

With salt o course said Salters impenitent reading the farming
reports from a weekold New York paper

Its plumb mortifyin to all my feelins the skipper went on

Cant see ut that way said Long Jack the peacemaker Look at here
Disko Is there another packet afloat this day in this weather cud ha
met a tramp an over an above givin her her reckoninover an
above that I saycud ha discoorsed wid her quite intelligent on the
management av steers an such at sea Forgit ut Av coorse they will
not Twas the most compenjus conversation that iver accrued Double
game an twice runninall to us Dan kicked Harvey under the table
and Harvey choked in his cup

Well said Salters who felt that his honour had been somewhat
plastered I said I didnt know as twuz any business o mine fore I
spoke

An right there said Tom Platt experienced in discipline and
etiquetteright there I take it Disko you should ha asked him to
stop ef the conversation wuz likely in your jedgment to be
anywayswhat it shouldnt

Dunno but thats so said Disko who saw his way to an honourable
retreat from a fit of the dignities

Why o course it was so said Salters you bein skipper here an
Id cheerful hev stopped on a hintnot from any leadin or conviction
but fer the sake o bearin an example to these two blame boys of
aours

Didnt I tell you Harve twould come araound to us fore wed done
Always those blame boys But I wouldnt have missed the show fer a
halfshare in a halibutter Dan whispered

Still things should ha been kep seprate said Disko and the
light of new argument lit in Salterss eye as he crumbled cut plug into
his pipe

Theres a power av vartue in keepin things seprate said Long Jack
intent on stilling the storm Thats fwhat Steyning of Steyning and
Hares fund when he sent Counahan fer skipper on the _Marilla D Kuhn_
instid o Cap Newton that was took with inflamtry rheumatism an
couldnt go Counahan the Navigator we called him

Nick Counahan he never went aboard fer a night thout a pond o rum
somewheres in the manifest said Tom Platt playing up to the lead
He used to bum araound the cmission houses to Boston lookin fer the
Lord to make him captain of a towboat on his merits Sam Coy up to
Atlantic Avenoo give him his board free fer a year or more on account
of his stories

Counahan the Navigator Tck Tck Dead these fifteen year aint he

Seventeen I guess He died the year the _Caspar McVeagh_ was built but
he could niver keep things seprate Steyning tuk him fer the reason
the thief tuk the hot stovebekaze there was nothin else that season
The men was all to the Banks and Counahan he whacked up an iverlastin
hard crowd fer crew Rum Ye cud ha floated the _Marilla_ insurance an
all in fwhat they stowed aboard her They lef Boston Harbour for the
great Grand Bank wid a roarin norwester behind em an all hands full
to the bung An the hivens looked after thim for divil a watch did
they set an divil a rope did they lay hand to till theyd seen the
bottom av a fifteengallon cask o bugjuice That was about wan week
so far as Counahan remembered If I cud only tell the tale as he told
ut All that whoile the wind blew like ould glory an the
_Marilla_twas summer and theyd give her a foretopmaststruck her
gait and kept ut Then Counahan tuk the hogyoke an thrembled over it
for a whoile an made out betwix that an the chart an the singin
in his head that they was to the southard o Sable Island gettin
along glorious but speakin nothin Then they broached another keg
an quit speculatin about anythin fer another spell The _Marilla_ she
lay down whin she dropped Boston Light and she never lufted her
leerail up to that timehustlin on one an the same slant But they
saw no weed nor gulls nor schooners an prisintly they obsarved
theyd bin out a matter o fourteen days and they mistrusted the Bank
has suspinded payment So they sounded an got sixty fathom Thats
me sez Counahan Thats me ivry time Ive run her slat on the Bank
fer you an when we get thirty fathom well turn in like little men
Counahan is the by sez he Counahan the Navigator

Nex cast they got ninety Sez Counahan Either the leadlines tuk
to stretchin or else the Banks sunk

They hauled ut up bein just about in that state when ut seemed right
an reasonable and sat down on the deck countin the knots an
gettin her snarled up hijjus The _Marilla_ shed struck her gait an
she hild ut an prisintly along came a tramp an Counahan spoke her

Hev ye seen any fishinboats now sez he quite casual

Theres lashins av them off the Irish coast sez the tramp

Aah go shake yerself sez Counahan Fwhat have I to do wid the
Irish coast

Then fwhat are ye doin here sez the tramp

Sufferin Christianity sez Counahan he always said that whin his
pumps sucked an he was not feelin goodSufferin Christianity he
sez where am I at

Thirtyfive mile westsouwest o Cape Clear sez the tramp if
thats any consolation to you

Counahan fetched wan jump four feet sivin inches measured by the
cook

Consolation sez he bould as brass Dye take me fer a dialect
Thirtyfive mile from Cape Clear an fourteen days from Boston Light
Sufferin Christianity tis a record an by the same token Ive a
mother to Skibbereen Think av ut The gall av um But ye see he could
niver keep things seprate

The crew was mostly Cork an Kerry men barrin one Marylander that
wanted to go back but they called him a mutineer an they ran the
ould _Marilla_ into Skibbereen an they had an illigant time visitin
around with frinds on the ould sod fer a week Thin they wint back an
it cost em two an thirty days to beat to the Banks again Twas
gettin on towards fall and grub was low so Counahan ran her back to
Boston wid no more bones to ut

And what did the firm say Harvey demanded

Fwhat could they The fish was on the Banks an Counahan was at
Twharf talkin av his record trip east They tuk their satisfaction
out av that an ut all came av not keepin the crew and the rum
seprate in the first place an confusin Skibbereen wid Queereau in
the second Counahan the Navigator rest his sowl He was an imprompju
citizen

Once I was in the Lucy Holmes said Manuel in his gentle voice
They not want any of her feesh in Gloucester Eh whaat Give us no
price So we go across the water and think to sell to some Fayal man
Then it blow fresh and we cannot see well Eh whaat Then it blow
some more fresh and we go down below and drive very fastno one know
where By and by we see a land and it get some hot Then come two
three nigger in a brick Eh whaat We ask where we are and they
saynow what you all think

Grand Canary said Disko after a moment Manuel shook his head
smiling

Blanco said Tom Platt

No Worse than that We was below Bezagos and the brick she was from
Liberia So we sell our feesh there Not bad so Eh whaat

Can a schooner like this go right across to Africa said Harvey

Go araound the Horn ef theres anythin worth goin fer and the grub
holds aout said Disko My father he run his packet an she was a
kind o pinkey abaout fifty ton I guessthe Ruperthe run her
over to Greenlands icy mountains the year haaf our fleet was tryin
after cod there An whats more he took my mother along with himto
show her haow the money was earned I presooman they was all iced
up an I was born at Disko Dont remember nothin abaout it o
course We come back when the ice eased in the spring but they named
me fer the place Kinder mean trick to put up on a baby but were all
baound to make mistakes in aour lives

Sure Sure said Salters wagging his head All baound to make
mistakes an I tell you two boys here thet after youve made a
mistakeye dont make fewern a hundred a daythe next best things
to own up to it like men

Long Jack winked one tremendous wink that embraced all hands except
Disko and Salters and the incident was closed

Then they made berth after berth to the northward the dories out
almost every day running along the east edge of the Grand Bank in
thirty to fortyfathom water and fishing steadily

It was here Harvey first met the squid who is one of the best
codbaits but uncertain in his moods They were waked out of their
bunks one black night by yells of Squid O from Salters and for an
hour and a half every soul aboard hung over his squidjiga piece of
lead painted red and armed at the lower end with a circle of pins bent
backward like halfopened umbrella ribs The squidfor some unknown
reasonlikes and wraps himself round this thing and is hauled up
ere he can escape from the pins But as he leaves his home he squirts
first water and next ink into his captors face and it was curious to
see the men weaving their heads from side to side to dodge the shot
They were as black as sweeps when the flurry ended but a pile of fresh
squid lay on the deck and the large cod thinks very well of a little
shiny piece of squid tentacle at the tip of a clambaited hook Next
day they caught many fish and met the _Carrie Pitman_ to whom they
shouted their luck and she wanted to tradeseven cod for one
fairsized squid but Disko would not agree at the price and the
_Carrie_ dropped sullenly to leeward and anchored half a mile away in
the hope of striking on to some for herself

Disco said nothing till after supper when he sent Dan and Manuel out
to buoy the _Were Heres_ cable and announced his intention of turning
in with the broadaxe Dan naturally repeated these remarks to the dory
from the _Carrie_ who wanted to know why they were buoying their cable
since they were not on rocky bottom

Dad sez he wouldnt trust a ferryboat within five mile o you Dan
howled cheerfully

Why dont he git out then Whos hinderin said the other

Cause youve jest the same ez leebowed him an he dont take that
from any boat not to speak o sech a driftin gurrybutt as you be

She aint driftin any this trip said the man angrily for the
_Carrie Pitman_ had an unsavory reputation for breaking her groundtackle

Then haow dyou make berths said Dan Its her best pint o
sailin An ef shes quit driftin what in thunder are you doin with
a new jibboom That shot went home

Hey you Portugoosy organgrinder take your monkey back to
Gloucester Go back to school Dan Troop was the answer

Overalls Overalls yelled Dan who knew that one of the _Carries_
crew had worked in an overall factory the winter before

Shrimp Gloucester shrimp Git aout you Novy

To call a Gloucester man a Nova Scotian is not well received Dan
answered in kind

Novy yourself ye Scrabbletowners ye Chatham wreckers Git aout with
your brick in your stockin And the forces separated but Chatham
had the worst of it

I knew haow twould be said Disko Shes drawed the wind raound
already Some one oughter put a deesist on thet packet Shell snore
till midnight an jest when were gettin our sleep shell strike
adrift Good job we aint crowded with craft hereaways But I aint
goin to up anchor fer Chatham She may hold

The wind which had hauled round rose at sundown and blew steadily
There was not enough sea though to disturb even a dorys tackle but
the _Carrie Pitman_ was a law unto herself At the end of the boys watch
they heard the crackcrackcrack of a huge muzzleloading revolver
aboard her

Glory glory hallelujah sung Dan Here she comes Dad buttend
first walkin in her sleep sames she done on Queereau

Had she been any other boat Disko would have taken his chances but now
he cut the cable as the _Carrie Pitman_ with all the North Atlantic to
play in lurched down directly upon them The _Were Here_ under jib
and ridingsail gave her no more room than was absolutely
necessaryDisko did not wish to spend a week hunting for his
cablebut scuttled up into the wind as the _Carrie_ passed within easy
hail a silent and angry boat at the mercy of a raking broadside of
Bank chaff

Good evenin said Disko raising his headgear an haow does your
garden grow

Go to Ohio an hire a mule said Uncle Salters We dont want no
farmers here

Will I lend YOU my doryanchor cried Long Jack

Unship your rudder an stick it in the mud bawled Tom Platt

Say Dans voice rose shrill and high as he stood on the wheelbox
Saay Is there a strike in the overall factory or hev they hired
girls ye Shackamaxons

Veer out the tillerlines cried Harvey and nail em to the
bottom That was a saltflavoured jest he had been put up to by Tom
Platt Manuel leaned over the stern and yelled Johanna Morgan play
the organ Ahaaaa He flourished his broad thumb with a gesture of
unspeakable contempt and derision while little Penn covered himself
with glory by piping up Gee a little Hssh Come here Haw

They rode on their chain for the rest of the night a short snappy
uneasy motion as Harvey found and wasted half the forenoon recovering
the cable But the boys agreed the trouble was cheap at the price of
triumph and glory and they thought with grief over all the beautiful
things that they might have said to the discomfited _Carrie_



CHAPTER VII

Next day they fell in with more sails all circling slowly from the
east northerly towards the west But just when they expected to make
the shoals by the Virgin the fog shut down and they anchored
surrounded by the tinklings of invisible bells There was not much
fishing but occasionally dory met dory in the fog and exchanged news

That night a little before dawn Dan and Harvey who had been sleeping
most of the day tumbled out to hook fried pies There was no reason
why they should not have taken them openly but they tasted better so
and it made the cook angry The heat and smell below drove them on deck
with their plunder and they found Disko at the bell which he handed
over to Harvey

Keep her goin said he I mistrust I hear somethin Ef its
anything Im best where I am sos to get at things

It was a forlorn little jingle the thick air seemed to pinch it off
and in the pauses Harvey heard the muffled shriek of a liners siren
and he knew enough of the Banks to know what that meant It came to
him with horrible distinctness how a boy in a cherrycoloured
jerseyhe despised fancy blazers now with all a fishermans
contempthow an ignorant rowdy boy had once said it would be great
if a steamer ran down a fishingboat That boy had a stateroom with a
hot and cold bath and spent ten minutes each morning picking over a
giltedged bill of fare And that same boyno his very much older
brotherwas up at four of the dim dawn in streaming crackling
oilskins hammering literally for the dear life on a bell smaller
than the stewards breakfastbell while somewhere close at hand a
thirtyfoot steel stem was storming along at twenty miles an hour The
bitterest thought of all was that there were folks asleep in dry
upholstered cabins who would never learn that they had massacred a boat
before breakfast So Harvey rang the bell

Yes they slow daown one turn o their blame propeller said Dan
applying himself to Manuels conch fer to keep inside the law an
thats consolin when were all at the bottom Hark to her Shes a
humper

Aooowhoowhupp went the siren Wingletingletink went the bell
Graaaouch went the conch while sea and sky were all mired up in
milky fog Then Harvey felt that he was near a moving body and found
himself looking up and up at the wet edge of a clifflike bow leaping
it seemed directly over the schooner A jaunty little feather of water
curled in front of it and as it lifted it showed a long ladder of
Roman numeralsXV XVI XVII XVIII and so forthon a
salmoncoloured gleaming side It tilted forward and downward with a
heartstilling Ssssooo the ladder disappeared a line of
brassrimmed portholes flashed past a jet of steam puffed in Harveys
helplessly uplifted hands a spout of hot water roared along the rail
of the _Were Here_ and the little schooner staggered and shook in a
rush of screwtorn water as a liners stern vanished in the fog
Harvey got ready to faint or be sick or both when he heard a crack
like a trunk thrown on a sidewalk and all small in his ear a
faraway telephone voice drawling Heave to Youve sunk us

Is it us he gasped

No Boat out yonder Ring Were goin to look said Dan running out
a dory

In half a minute all except Harvey Penn and the cook were overside
and away Presently a schooners stumpforemast snapped clean across
drifted past the bows Then an empty green dory came by knocking on
the _Were Heres_ side as though she wished to be taken in Then
followed something face down in a blue jersey butit was not the
whole of a man Penn changed colour and caught his breath with a click
Harvey pounded despairingly at the bell for he feared they might be
sunk at any minute and he jumped at Dans hail as the crew came back

The Jennie Cushman said Dan hysterically cut clean in
halfgraound up an trompled on at that Not a quarter of a mile away
Dads got the old man There aint any one else andthere was his
son too Oh Harve Harve I cant stand it Ive seen He dropped
his head on his arms and sobbed while the others dragged a grayheaded
man aboard

What did you pick me up for the stranger groaned Disko what did
you pick me up for

Disko dropped a heavy hand on his shoulder for the mans eyes were
wild and his lips trembled as he stared at the silent crew Then up and
spoke Pennsylvania Pratt who was also Haskins or Rich or McVitty when
Uncle Salters forgot and his face was changed on him from the face of
a fool to the countenance of an old wise man and he said in a strong
voice The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the
name of the Lord I wasI am a minister of the Gospel Leave him to
me

Oh you be be you said the man Then pray my son back to me Pray
back a ninethousanddollar boat an a thousand quintal of fish If
youd left me alone my widow could ha gone on to the Provident an
worked fer her board an never knownan never known Now Ill hev to
tell her

There aint nothin to say said Disko Better lie down a piece
Jason Olley

When a man has lost his only son his summers work and his means of
livelihood in thirty counted seconds it is hard to give consolation

All Gloucester men wasnt they said Tom Platt fiddling helplessly
with a dorybecket

Oh that dont make no odds said Jason wringing the wet from his
beard Ill be rowin summer boarders araound East Gloucester this
fall He rolled heavily to the rail singing

 Happy birds that sing and fly
 Round thine altars O Most High

Come with me Come below said Penn as though he had a right to give
orders Their eyes met and fought for a quarter of a minute

I dunno who you be but Ill come said Jason submissively Mebbe
Ill get back some o thesome o thenine thousand dollars Penn led
him into the cabin and slid the door behind

That aint Penn cried Uncle Salters Its Jacob Boiler anhes
remembered Johnstown I never seed such eyes in any livin mans head
Whats to do naow Whatll I do naow

They could hear Penns voice and Jasons together Then Penns went on
alone and Salters slipped off his hat for Penn was praying Presently
the little man came up the steps huge drops of sweat on his face and
looked at the crew Dan was still sobbing by the wheel

He dont know us Salters groaned Its all to do over again
checkers and everythingan whatll he say to me

Penn spoke they could hear that it was to strangers I have prayed
said he Our people believe in prayer I have prayed for the life of
this mans son Mine were drowned before my eyesshe and my eldest
andthe others Shall a man be more wise than his Maker I prayed
never for their lives but I have prayed for this mans son and he
will surely be sent him

Salters looked pleadingly at Penn to see if he remembered

How long have I been mad Penn asked suddenly His mouth was
twitching

Pshaw Penn You werent never mad Salters began Only a little
distracted like

I saw the houses strike the bridge before the fires broke out I do
not remember any more How long ago is that

I cant stand it I cant stand it cried Dan and Harvey whimpered
in sympathy

Abaout five year said Disko in a shaking voice

Then I have been a charge on some one for every day of that time Who
was the man

Disko pointed to Salters

Ye haintye haint cried the seafarmer twisting his hands
together Yeve moren earned your keep twicetold an theres money
owin you Penn besides haaf o my quartershare in the boat which
is yours fer value received

You are good men I can see that in your faces But

Mother av Mercy whispered Long Jack an hes been wid us all these
trips Hes clean bewitched

A schooners bell struck up alongside and a voice hailed through the
fog O Disko Heard abaout the Jennie Cushman

They have found his son cried Penn Stand you still and see the
salvation of the Lord

Got Jason aboard here Disko answered but his voice quavered
Therewarnt any one else

Weve fund one though Run acrost him snarled up in a mess o lumber
thet might ha bin a focsle His heads cut some

Who is he

The _Were Heres_ heartbeats answered one another

Guess its young Olley the voice drawled

Penn raised his hands and said something in German Harvey could have
sworn that a bright sun was shining upon his lifted face but the drawl
went on Saay You fellers guyed us considrable tother night

We dont feel like guyin any now said Disko

I know it but to tell the honest truth we was kinderkinder driftin
when we run agin young Olley

It was the irrepressible _Carrie Pitman_ and a roar of unsteady laughter
went up from the deck of the _Were Here_

Hednt you baouts well send the old man aboard Were runnin in fer
more bait an graoundtackle Guess you wont want him anyway an
this blame windlass work makes us shorthanded Well take care of him
He married my womans aunt

Ill give you anything in the boat said Troop

Dont want nothin less mebbe an anchor thatll hold Say Young
Olleys gittin kinder baulky an excited Send the old man along

Penn waked him from his stupor of despair and Tom Platt rowed him
over He went away without a word of thanks not knowing what was to
come and the fog closed over all

And now said Penn drawing a deep breath as though about to preach
And nowthe erect body sank like a sword driven home into the
scabbard the light faded from the overbright eyes the voice returned
to its usual pitiful little titterand now said Pennsylvania Pratt
do you think its too early for a little game of checkers Mr
Salters

The very thingthe very thing I was goin to say myself cried
Salters promptly It beats all Penn how ye git on to whats in a
mans mind

The little fellow blushed and meekly followed Salters forward

Up anchor Hurry Lets quit these crazy waters shouted Disko and
never was he more swiftly obeyed

Now what in creation dye suppose is the meanin o that all said
Long Jack when they were working through the fog once more damp
dripping and bewildered

The way I sense it said Disko at the wheel is this The Jennie
Cushman business comin on an empty stummick

Hhe saw one of them go by sobbed Harvey

An that o course kinder hove him outer water julluk runnin a
craft ashore hove him right aout I take it to rememberin Johnstown
an Jacob Boiler an suchlike reminiscences Well consolin Jason
there held him up a piece sames shorin up a boat Then bein weak
them props slipped an slipped an he slided down the ways an naow
hes waterborne agin Thats haow I sense it

They decided that Disko was entirely correct

Twould ha bruk Salters all up said Long Jack if Penn had stayed
Jacob Boilerin Did ye see his face when Penn asked who hed been
charged on all these years How is ut Salters

Asleepdead asleep Turned in like a child Salters replied
tiptoeing aft There wont be no grub till he wakes natural Did ye
ever see sech a gift in prayer He everlastinly hiked young Olley
outer the ocean Thets my belief Jason was turble praoud of his boy
an I mistrusted all along twas a jedgment on worshippin vain idols

Theres others jes as sot said Disko

Thats difrunt Salters retorted quickly Penns not all caulked
an I aint only but doin my duty by him

They waited those hungry men three hours till Penn reappeared with a
smooth face and a blank mind He said he believed that he had been
dreaming Then he wanted to know why they were so silent and they
could not tell him


Disko worked all hands mercilessly for the next three or four days and
when they could not go out turned them into the hold to stack the
ships stores into smaller compass to make more room for the fish The
packed mass ran from the cabin partition to the sliding door behind the
focsle stove and Disko showed how there is great art in stowing cargo
so as to bring a schooner to her best draft The crew were thus kept
lively till they recovered their spirits and Harvey was tickled with a
ropes end by Long Jack for being as the Galway man said sorrowful
as a sick cat over fwhat couldnt be helped He did a great deal of
thinking in those weary days and told Dan what he thought and Dan
agreed with himeven to the extent of asking for fried pies instead of
hooking them

But a week later the two nearly upset the Hattie S in a wild attempt
to stab a shark with an old bayonet tied to a stick The grim brute
rubbed alongside the dory begging for small fish and between the three
of them it was a mercy they all got off alive

At last after playing blindmansbuff in the fog there came a morning
when Disko shouted down the focsle Hurry boys Were in taown



CHAPTER VIII

To the end of his days Harvey will never forget that sight The sun
was just clear of the horizon they had not seen for nearly a week and
his low red light struck into the ridingsails of three fleets of
anchored schoonersone to the north one to the westward and one to
the south There must have been nearly a hundred of them of every
possible make and build with far away a squarerigged Frenchman all
bowing and courtesying one to the other From every boat dories were
dropping away like bees from a crowded hive and the clamour of voices
the rattling of ropes and blocks and the splash of the oars carried
for miles across the heaving water The sails turned all colours
black pearlygray and white as the sun mounted and more boats swung
up through the mists to the southward

The dories gathered in clusters separated reformed and broke again
all heading one way while men hailed and whistled and catcalled and
sang and the water was speckled with rubbish thrown overboard

Its a town said Harvey Disko was right It IS a town

Ive seen smaller said Disko Theres about a thousand men here
an yonders the Virgin He pointed to a vacant space of greenish sea
where there were no dories

The _Were Here_ skirted round the northern squadron Disko waving his
hand to friend after friend and anchored as nearly as a racing yacht
at the end of the season The Bank fleet pass good seamanship in
silence but a bungler is jeered all along the line

Jest in time fer the caplin cried the Mary Chilton

Salt most wet asked the King Philip

Hey Tom Platt Come t supper tonight said the Henry Clay and so
questions and answers flew back and forth Men had met one another
before doryfishing in the fog and there is no place for gossip like
the Bank fleet They all seemed to know about Harveys rescue and
asked if he were worth his salt yet The young bloods jested with Dan
who had a lively tongue of his own and inquired after their health by
the townnicknames they least liked Manuels countrymen jabbered at
him in their own language and even the silent cook was seen riding the
jibboom and shouting Gaelic to a friend as black as himself After
they had buoyed the cableall around the Virgin is rocky bottom and
carelessness means chafed groundtackle and danger from driftingafter
they had buoyed the cable their dories went forth to join the mob of
boats anchored about a mile away The schooners rocked and dipped at a
safe distance like mother ducks watching their brood while the dories
behaved like mannerless ducklings

As they drove into the confusion boat banging boat Harveys ears
tingled at the comments on his rowing Every dialect from Labrador to
Long Island with Portuguese Neapolitan Lingua Franca French and
Gaelic with songs and shoutings and new oaths rattled round him and
he seemed to be the butt of it all For the first time in his life he
felt shyperhaps that came from living so long with only the _Were
Heres_among the scores of wild faces that rose and fell with the
reeling small craft A gentle breathing swell three furlongs from
trough to barrel would quietly shoulder up a string of variously
painted dories They hung for an instant a wonderful frieze against
the skyline and their men pointed and hailed Next moment the open
mouths waving arms and bare chests disappeared while on another
swell came up an entirely new line of characters like paper figures in
a toy theatre So Harvey stared Watch out said Dan flourishing a
dipnet When I tell you dip you dip The caplinll school any time
from naow on Wherell we lay Tom Platt

Pushing shoving and hauling greeting old friends here and warning
old enemies there Commodore Tom Platt led his little fleet well to
leeward of the general crowd and immediately three or four men began
to haul on their anchors with intent to leebow the _Were Heres_ But
a yell of laughter went up as a dory shot from her station with
exceeding speed its occupant pulling madly on the roding

Give her slack roared twenty voices Let him shake it out

Whats the matter said Harvey as the boat flashed away to the
southward Hes anchored isnt he

Anchored sure enough but his graoundtackles kinder shifty said
Dan laughing Whales fouled it    Dip Harve Here they come

The sea round them clouded and darkened and then frizzed up in showers
of tiny silver fish and over a space of five or six acres the cod
began to leap like trout in May while behind the cod three or four
broad graybacks broke the water into boils

Then everybody shouted and tried to haul up his anchor to get among the
school and fouled his neighbours line and said what was in his heart
and dipped furiously with his dipnet and shrieked cautions and advice
to his companions while the deep fizzed like freshly opened
sodawater and cod men and whales together flung in upon the
luckless bait Harvey was nearly knocked overboard by the handle of
Dans net But in all the wild tumult he noticed and never forgot the
wicked set little eyesomething like a circus elephants eyeof a
whale that drove along almost level with the water and so he said
winked at him Three boats found their rodings fouled by these reckless
midsea hunters and were towed half a mile ere their horses shook the
line free

Then the caplin moved off and five minutes later there was no sound
except the splash of the sinkers overside the flapping of the cod and
the whack of the muckles as the men stunned them It was wonderful
fishing Harvey could see the glimmering cod below swimming slowly in
droves biting as steadily as they swam Bank law strictly forbids more
than one hook on one line when the dories are on the Virgin or the
Eastern Shoals but so close lay the boats that even single hooks
snarled and Harvey found himself in hot argument with a gentle hairy
Newfoundlander on one side and a howling Portuguese on the other

Worse than any tangle of fishinglines was the confusion of the
doryrodings below water Each man had anchored where it seemed good to
him drifting and rowing round his fixed point As the fish struck on
less quickly each man wanted to haul up and get to better ground but
every third man found himself intimately connected with some four or
five neighbours To cut anothers roding is crime unspeakable on the
Banks yet it was done and done without detection three or four times
that day Tom Platt caught a Maine man in the black act and knocked him
over the gunwale with an oar and Manuel served a fellowcountryman in
the same way But Harveys anchorline was cut and so was Penns and
they were turned into reliefboats to carry fish to the _Were Here_ as
the dories filled The caplin schooled once more at twilight when the
mad clamour was repeated and at dusk they rowed back to dress down by
the light of kerosenelamps on the edge of the pen

It was a huge pile and they went to sleep while they were dressing
Next day several boats fished right above the cap of the Virgin and
Harvey with them looked down on the very weed of that lonely rock
which rises to within twenty feet of the surface The cod were there in
legions marching solemnly over the leathery kelp When they bit they
bit all together and so when they stopped There was a slack time at
noon and the dories began to search for amusement It was Dan who
sighted the Hope Of Prague just coming up and as her boats joined the
company they were greeted with the question Whos the meanest man in
the Fleet

Three hundred voices answered cheerily Nick Braady It sounded like
an organ chant

Who stole the lampwicks That was Dans contribution

Nick Braady sang the boats

Who biled the salt bait fer soup This was an unknown backbiter a
quarter of a mile away

Again the joyful chorus Now Brady was not especially mean but he had
that reputation and the Fleet made the most of it Then they
discovered a man from a Truro boat who six years before had been
convicted of using a tackle with five or six hooksa scrowger they
call itin the Shoals Naturally he had been christened Scrowger
Jim and though he had hidden himself on the Georges ever since he
found his honours waiting for him full blown They took it up in a sort
of firecracker chorus Jim O Jim Jim O Jim Sssscrowger Jim That
pleased everybody And when a poetical Beverly manhe had been making
it up all day and talked about it for weekssang The _Carrie
Pitmans_ anchor doesnt hold her for a cent the dories felt that they
were indeed fortunate Then they had to ask that Beverly man how he was
off for beans because even poets must not have things all their own
way Every schooner and nearly every man got it in turn Was there a
careless or dirty cook anywhere The dories sang about him and his
food Was a schooner badly found The Fleet was told at full length
Had a man hooked tobacco from a messmate He was named in meeting the
name tossed from roller to roller Diskos infallible judgments Long
Jacks marketboat that he had sold years ago Dans sweetheart oh
but Dan was an angry boy Penns bad luck with doryanchors Salters
views on manure Manuels little slips from virtue ashore and Harveys
ladylike handling of the oarall were laid before the public and as
the fog fell around them in silvery sheets beneath the sun the voices
sounded like a bench of invisible judges pronouncing sentence

The dories roved and fished and squabbled till a swell underran the
sea Then they drew more apart to save their sides and some one called
that if the swell continued the Virgin would break A reckless Galway
man with his nephew denied this hauled up anchor and rowed over the
very rock itself Many voices called them to come away while others
dared them to hold on As the smoothbacked rollers passed to the
southward they hove the dory high and high into the mist and dropped
her in ugly sucking dimpled water where she spun round her anchor
within a foot or two of the hidden rock It was playing with death for
mere bravado and the boats looked on in uneasy silence till Long Jack
rowed up behind his countrymen and quietly cut their roding

Cant ye hear ut knockin he cried Pull for you miserable lives
Pull

The men swore and tried to argue as the boat drifted but the next
swell checked a little like a man tripping on a carpet There was a
deep sob and a gathering roar and the Virgin flung up a couple of
acres of foaming water white furious and ghastly over the shoal sea
Then all the boats greatly applauded Long Jack and the Galway men held
their tongue

Aint it elegant said Dan bobbing like a young seal at home
Shell break about once every haaf hour now les the swell piles up
good Whats her reglar time when shes at work Tom Platt

Once ivry fifteen minutes to the tick Harve youve seen the
greatest thing on the Banks an but for Long Jack youd seen some dead
men too

There came a sound of merriment where the fog lay thicker and the
schooners were ringing their bells A big bark nosed cautiously out of
the mist and was received with shouts and cries of Come along
darlin from the Irishry

Another Frenchman said Harvey

Haint you eyes Shes a Baltimore boat goin in fear an tremblin
said Dan Well guy the very sticks out of her Guess its the fust
time her skipper ever met up with the Fleet this way

She was a black buxom eighthundredton craft Her mainsail was
looped up and her topsail flapped undecidedly in what little wind was
moving Now a bark is feminine beyond all other daughters of the sea
and this tall hesitating creature with her white and gilt figurehead
looked just like a bewildered woman half lifting her skirts to cross a
muddy street under the jeers of bad little boys That was very much her
situation She knew she was somewhere in the neighbourhood of the
Virgin had caught the roar of it and was therefore asking her way
This is a small part of what she heard from the dancing dories

The Virgin Fwhat are you talkin of This is Le Have on a Sunday
mornin Go home an sober up

Go home ye tarrapin Go home an tell em were comin

Half a dozen voices together in a most tuneful chorus as her stern
went down with a roll and a bubble into the troughs
Thayaahshestrikes

Hard up Hard up fer your life Youre on top of her now

Daown Hard daown Let go everything

All hands to the pumps

Daown jib an pole her

Here the skipper lost his temper and said things Instantly fishing was
suspended to answer him and he heard many curious facts about his boat
and her next port of call They asked him if he were insured and
whence he had stolen his anchor because they said it belonged to the
_Carrie Pitman_ they called his boat a mudscow and accused him of
dumping garbage to frighten the fish they offered to tow him and
charge it to his wife and one audacious youth slipped up almost under
the counter smacked it with his open palm and yelled Gid up Buck

The cook emptied a pan of ashes on him and he replied with codheads
The barks crew fired small coal from the galley and the dories
threatened to come aboard and razee her They would have warned her
at once had she been in real peril but seeing her well clear of the
Virgin they made the most of their chances The fun was spoilt when
the rock spoke again a halfmile to windward and the tormented bark
set everything that would draw and went her ways but the dories felt
that the honours lay with them

All that night the Virgin roared hoarsely and next morning over an
angry whiteheaded sea Harvey saw the Fleet with flickering masts
waiting for a lead Not a dory was hove out till ten oclock when the
two Jeraulds of the Days Eye imagining a lull which did not exist
set the example In a minute half the boats were out and bobbing in the
cockly swells but Troop kept the _Were Heres_ at work dressing down
He saw no sense in dares and as the storm grew that evening they had
the pleasure of receiving wet strangers only too glad to make any
refuge in the gale The boys stood by the dorytackles with lanterns
the men ready to haul one eye cocked for the sweeping wave that would
make them drop everything and hold on for dear life Out of the dark
would come a yell of Dory dory They would hook up and haul in a
drenched man and a halfsunk boat till their decks were littered down
with nests of dories and the bunks were full Five times in their watch
did Harvey with Dan jump at the foregaff where it lay lashed on the
boom and cling with arms legs and teeth to rope and spar and sodden
canvas as a big wave filled the decks One dory was smashed to pieces
and the sea pitched the man head first on to the decks cutting his
forehead open and about dawn when the racing seas glimmered white all
along their cold edges another man blue and ghastly crawled in with
a broken hand asking news of his brother Seven extra mouths sat down
to breakfast A Swede a Chatham skipper a boy from Hancock Maine
one Duxbury and three Provincetown men

There was a general sorting out among the Fleet next day and though no
one said anything all ate with better appetites when boat after boat
reported full crews aboard Only a couple of Portuguese and an old man
from Gloucester were drowned but many were cut or bruised and two
schooners had parted their tackle and been blown to the southward
three days sail A man died on a Frenchmanit was the same bark that
had traded tobacco with the _Were Heres_ She slipped away quite
quietly one wet white morning moved to a patch of deep water her
sails all hanging anyhow and Harvey saw the funeral through Diskos
spyglass It was only an oblong bundle slid overside They did not
seem to have any form of service but in the night at anchor Harvey
heard them across the starpowdered black water singing something that
sounded like a hymn It went to a very slow tune

 La brigantine
 Qui va tourner
 Roule et sincline
 Pour mentrainer
 Oh Vierge Marie
 Pour moi priez Dieu
 Adieu patrie
 Quebec adieu

Tom Platt visited her because he said the dead man was his brother
as a Freemason It came out that a wave had doubled the poor fellow
over the heel of the bowsprit and broken his back The news spread like
a flash for contrary to general custom the Frenchman held an auction
of the dead mans kithe had no friends at St Malo or Miquelonand
everything was spread out on the top of the house from his red knitted
cap to the leather belt with the sheathknife at the back Dan and
Harvey were out on twentyfathom water in the Hattie S and naturally
rowed over to join the crowd It was a long pull and they stayed some
little time while Dan bought the knife which had a curious brass
handle When they dropped overside and pushed off into a drizzle of
rain and a lop of sea it occurred to them that they might get into
trouble for neglecting the lines

Guess twont hurt us any to be warmed up said Dan shivering under
his oilskins and they rowed on into the heart of a white fog which
as usual dropped on them without warning

Theres too much blame tide hereabouts to trust to your instinks he
said Heave over the anchor Harve and well fish a piece till the
thing lifts Bend on your biggest lead Three pound aint any too much
in this water See how shes tightened on her rodin already

There was quite a little bubble at the bows where some irresponsible
Bank current held the dory full stretch on her rope but they could not
see a boats length in any direction Harvey turned up his collar and
bunched himself over his reel with the air of a wearied navigator Fog
had no special terrors for him now They fished a while in silence and
found the cod struck on well Then Dan drew the sheathknife and tested
the edge of it on the gunwale

Thats a daisy said Harvey How did you get it so cheap

On account o their blame Cathlic superstitions said Dan jabbing
with the bright blade They dont fancy takin iron from off a dead
man so to speak See them Arichat Frenchmen step back when I bid

But an auction aint taking anythink off a dead man Its business

We know it aint but theres no goin in the teeth o superstition
Thats one o the advantages o livin in a progressive country And
Dan began whistling

 Oh Double Thatcher how are you
 Now Eastern Point comes inter view
 The girls an boys we soon shall see
 At anchor off Cape Ann

Why didnt that Eastport man bid then He bought his boots Aint
Maine progressive

Maine Pshaw They dont know enough or they haint got money enough
to paint their haouses in Maine Ive seen em The Eastport man he
told me that the knife had been usedso the French captain told
himused up on the French coast last year

Cut a man Heave s the muckle Harvey hauled in his fish rebaited
and threw over

Killed him Course when I heard that I was keenern ever to get it

Christmas I didnt know it said Harvey turning round Ill give
you a dollar for it when Iget my wages Say Ill give you two
dollars

Honest Dyou like it as much as all that said Dan flushing Well
to tell the truth I kinder got it for youto give but I didnt let
on till I saw how youd take it Its yours and welcome Harve because
were dorymates and so on and so forth an so followin Catch
aholt

He held it out belt and all

But look at here Dan I dont see

Take it Taint no use to me I wish you to hev it The temptation
was irresistible Dan youre a white man said Harvey Ill keep it
as long as I live

Thats good hearin said Dan with a pleasant laugh and then
anxious to change the subject Looks if your line was fast to
somethin

Fouled I guess said Harve tugging Before he pulled up he fastened
the belt round him and with deep delight heard the tip of the sheath
click on the thwart Concern the thing he cried She acts as though
she were on strawberrybottom Its all sand here aint it

Dan reached over and gave a judgmatic tweak Hollbutll act that way
f hes sulky Thets no strawberrybottom Yank her once or twice She
gives sure Guess wed better haul up an make certain

They pulled together making fast at each turn on the cleats and the
hidden weight rose sluggishly

Prize oh Haul shouted Dan but the shout ended in a shrill double
shriek of horror for out of the sea came the body of the dead
Frenchman buried two days before The hook had caught him under the
right armpit and he swayed erect and horrible head and shoulders
above water His arms were tied to his side andhe had no face The
boys fell over each other in a heap at the bottom of the dory and
there they lay while the thing bobbed alongside held on the shortened
line

The tidethe tide brought him said Harvey with quivering lips as
he fumbled at the clasp of the belt

Oh Lord Oh Harve groaned Dan be quick Hes come for it Let
him have it Take it off

I dont want it I dont want it cried Harvey I cant find the
bubuckle

Quick Harve Hes on your line

Harvey sat up to unfasten the belt facing the head that had no face
under its streaming hair Hes fast still he whispered to Dan who
slipped out his knife and cut the line as Harvey flung the belt far
overside The body shot down with a plop and Dan cautiously rose to
his knees whiter than the fog

He come for it He come for it Ive seen a stale one hauled up on a
trawl and I didnt much care but he come to us special

I wishI wish I hadnt taken the knife Then hed have come on your
line

Dunno as thet would ha made any differ Were both scared out o ten
years growth Oh Harve did ye see his head

Did I Ill never forget it But look at here Dan it couldnt have
been meant It was only the tide

Tide He come for it Harve Why they sunk him six miles to southard
o the Fleet an were two miles from where shes lyin now They told
me he was weighted with a fathom an a half o chaincable

Wonder what he did with the knifeup on the French coast

Something bad Guess hes bound to take it with him to the Judgment
an so What are you doin with the fish

Heaving em overboard said Harvey

What for We shant eat em

I dont care I had to look at his face while I was takin the belt
off You can keep your catch if you like Ive no use for mine

Dan said nothing but threw his fish over again

Guess its best to be on the safe side he murmured at last Id
give a months pay if this fog ud lift Things go abaout in a fog
that ye dont see in clear weatheryohoes an hollerers and such
like Im sorter relieved he come the way he did instid o walkin He
might ha walked

Dont Dan Were right on top of him now Wish I was safe aboard
hem pounded by Uncle Salters

Theyll be lookin fer us in a little Gimme the tooter Dan took the
tin dinnerhorn but paused before he blew

Go on said Harvey I dont want to stay here all night

Question is haow hed take it There was a man frum down the coast
told me once he was in a schooner where they darsent ever blow a horn
to the dories becaze the skippernot the man he was with but a
captain that had run her five years beforehed drowned a boy
alongside in a drunk fit an ever after that boy hed row alongside
too and shout Dory dory with the rest

Dory dory a muffled voice cried through the fog They cowered
again and the horn dropped from Dans hand

Hold on cried Harvey its the cook

Dunno what made me think o thet fool tale either said Dan Its
the doctor sure enough

Dan Danny Oooh Dan Harve Harvey Oooh Haarveee

Were here sung both boys together They heard oars but could see
nothing till the cook shining and dripping rowed into them

What iss happened said he You will be beaten at home

Thets what we want Thets what were sufferin for said Dan
Anything homeys good enough fer us Weve had kinder depressin
company As the cook passed them a line Dan told him the tale

Yess He come for hiss knife was all he said at the end

Never had the little rocking _Were Here_ looked so deliciously
homelike as when the cook born and bred in fogs rowed them back to
her There was a warm glow of light from the cabin and a satisfying
smell of food forward and it was heavenly to hear Disko and the
others all quite alive and solid leaning over the rail and promising
them a firstclass pounding But the cook was a black master of
strategy He did not get the dories aboard till he had given the more
striking points of the tale explaining as he backed and bumped round
the counter how Harvey was the mascot to destroy any possible bad luck
So the boys came override as rather uncanny heroes and every one asked
them questions instead of pounding them for making trouble Little Penn
delivered quite a speech on the folly of superstitions but public
opinion was against him and in favour of Long Jack who told the most
excruciating ghoststories till nearly midnight Under that influence
no one except Salters and Penn said anything about idolatry when the
cook put a lighted candle a cake of flour and water and a pinch of
salt on a shingle and floated them out astern to keep the Frenchman
quiet in case he was still restless Dan lit the candle because he had
bought the belt and the cook grunted and muttered charms as long as he
could see the ducking point of flame

Said Harvey to Dan as they turned in after watch

How about progress and Catholic superstitions

Huh I guess Im as enlightened and progressive as the next man but
when it comes to a dead St Malo deckhand scarin a couple o pore
boys stiff fer the sake of a thirtycent knife why then the cook can
take hold fer all o me I mistrust furriners livin or dead

Next morning all except the cook were rather ashamed of the
ceremonies and went to work double tides speaking gruffly to one
another

The _Were Here_ was racing neck and neck for her last few loads
against the Parry Norman and so close was the struggle that the Fleet
took side and betted tobacco All hands worked at the lines or
dressingdown till they fell asleep where they stoodbeginning before
dawn and ending when it was too dark to see They even used the cook as
pitcher and turned Harvey into the hold to pass salt while Dan helped
to dress down Luckily a Parry Norman man sprained his ankle falling
down the focsle and the _Were Heres_ gained Harvey could not see
how one more fish could be crammed into her but Disko and Tom Platt
stowed and stowed and planked the mass down with big stones from the
ballast and there was always jest another days work Disko did not
tell them when all the salt was wetted He rolled to the lazarette aft
the cabin and began hauling out the big mainsail This was at ten in
the morning The ridingsail was down and the main and topsail were up
by noon and dories came alongside with letters for home envying their
good fortune At last she cleared decks hoisted her flagas is the
right of the first boat off the Banksupanchored and began to move
Disko pretended that he wished to accomodate folk who had not sent in
their mail and so worked her gracefully in and out among the
schooners In reality that was his little triumphant procession and
for the fifth year running it showed what kind of mariner he was Dans
accordion and Tom Platts fiddle supplied the music of the magic verse
you must not sing till all the salt is wet

 Hih Yih Yoho Send your letters raound
 All our salt is wetted an the anchors off the graound
 Bend oh bend your mainsl were back to Yankeeland
 With fifteen hunder quintal
 An fifteen hunder quintal
 Teen hunder toppin quintal
 Twix old Queereau an Grand


The last letters pitched on deck wrapped round pieces of coal and the
Gloucester men shouted messages to their wives and womenfolks and
owners while the _Were Here_ finished the musical ride through the
Fleet her headsails quivering like a mans hand when he raises it to
say goodby

Harvey very soon discovered that the _Were Here_ with her
ridingsail strolling from berth to berth and the _Were Here_ headed
west by south under home canvas were two very different boats There
was a bite and kick to the wheel even in boys weather he could feel
the dead weight in the hold flung forward mightily across the surges
and the streaming line of bubbles overside made his eyes dizzy

Disko kept them busy fiddling with the sails and when those were
flattened like a racing yachts Dan had to wait on the big topsail
which was put over by hand every time she went about In spare moments
they pumped for the packed fish dripped brine which does not improve
a cargo But since there was no fishing Harvey had time to look at the
sea from another point of view The lowsided schooner was naturally on
most intimate terms with her surroundings They saw little of the
horizon save when she topped a swell and usually she was elbowing
fidgeting and coasting her steadfast way through gray grayblue or
black hollows laced across and across with streaks of shivering foam
or rubbing herself caressingly along the flank of some bigger
waterhill It was as if she said You wouldnt hurt me surely Im
only the little _Were Here_ Then she would slide away chuckling
softly to herself till she was brought up by some fresh obstacle The
dullest of folk cannot see this kind of thing hour after hour through
long days without noticing it and Harvey being anything but dull
began to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of wavetops turning over
with a sound of incessant tearing the hurry of the winds working
across open spaces and herding the purpleblue cloudshadows the
splendid upheaval of the red sunrise the folding and packing away of
the morning mists wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors
the salty glare and blaze of noon the kiss of rain falling over
thousands of dead flat square miles the chilly blackening of
everything at the days end and the million wrinkles of the sea under
the moonlight when the jibboom solemnly poked at the low stars and
Harvey went down to get a doughnut from the cook

But the best fun was when the boys were put on the wheel together Tom
Platt within hail and she cuddled her leerail down to the crashing
blue and kept a little homemade rainbow arching unbroken over her
windlass Then the jaws of the booms whined against the masts and the
sheets creaked and the sails filled with roaring and when she slid
into a hollow she trampled like a woman tripped in her own silk dress
and came out her jib wet halfway up yearning and peering for the
tall twinlights of Thatchers Island

They left the cold gray of the Bank sea saw the lumberships making
for Quebec by the Straits of St Lawrence with the Jersey saltbrigs
from Spain and Sicily found a friendly northeaster off Artimon Bank
that drove them within view of the East light of Sable Islanda sight
Disko did not linger overand stayed with them past Western and Le
Have to the northern fringe of Georges From there they picked up the
deeper water and let her go merrily

Hatties pulling on the string Dan confided to Harvey Hattie an
Ma Next Sunday youll be hirin a boy to throw water on the windows to
make ye go to sleep Guess youll keep with us till your folks come
Do you know the best of gettin ashore again

Hot bath said Harvey His eyebrows were all white with dried spray

Thats good but a nightshirts better Ive been dreamin o
nightshirts ever since we bent our mainsail Ye can wiggle your toes
then Mall hev a new one fer me all washed soft Its home Harve
Its home Ye can sense it in the air Were runnin into the aidge of
a hot wave naow an I can smell the bayberries Wonder if well get in
fer supper Port a trifle

The hesitating sails flapped and lurched in the close air as the deep
smoothed out blue and oily round them When they whistled for a wind
only the rain came in spiky rods bubbling and drumming and behind the
rain the thunder and the lightning of midAugust They lay on the deck
with bare feet and arms telling one another what they would order at
their first meal ashore for now the land was in plain sight A
Gloucester swordfishboat drifted alongside a man in the little pulpit
on the bowsprit flourished his harpoon his bare head plastered down
with the wet And alls well he sang cheerily as though he were
watch on a big liner Wouvermans waiting fer you Disko Whats the
news o the Fleet

Disko shouted it and passed on while the wild summer storm pounded
overhead and the lightning flickered along the capes from four
different quarters at once It gave the low circle of hills round
Gloucester Harbor Ten Pound Island the fishsheds with the broken
line of houseroofs and each spar and buoy on the water in blinding
photographs that came and went a dozen times to the minute as the
_Were Here_ crawled in on halfflood and the whistlingbuoy moaned
and mourned behind her Then the storm died out in long separated
vicious dags of bluewhite flame followed by a single roar like the
roar of a mortarbattery and the shaken air tingled under the stars as
it got back to silence

The flag the flag said Disko suddenly pointing upward

What is ut said Long Jack

Otto Haaf mast They can see us frum shore now

Id clean forgot Hes no folk to Gloucester has he

Girl he was goin to be married to this fall

Mary pity her said Long Jack and lowered the little flag halfmast
for the sake of Otto swept overboard in a gale off Le Have three
months before

Disko wiped the wet from his eyes and led the _Were Here_ to
Wouvermans wharf giving his orders in whispers while she swung round
moored tugs and nightwatchmen hailed her from the ends of inkyblack
piers Over and above the darkness and the mystery of the procession
Harvey could feel the land close round him once more with all its
thousands of people asleep and the smell of earth after rain and the
familiar noise of a switchingengine coughing to herself in a
freightyard and all those things made his heart beat and his throat
dry up as he stood by the foresheet They heard the anchorwatch
snoring on a lighthousetug nosed into a pocket of darkness where a
lantern glimmered on either side somebody waked with a grunt threw
them a rope and they made fast to a silent wharf flanked with great
ironroofed sheds fall of warm emptiness and lay there without a sound

Then Harvey sat down by the wheel and sobbed and sobbed as though his
heart would break and a tall woman who had been sitting on a
weighscale dropped down into the schooner and kissed Dan once on the
cheek for she was his mother and she had seen the _Were Here_ by the
lightning flashes She took no notice of Harvey till he had recovered
himself a little and Disko had told her his story Then they went to
Diskos house together as the dawn was breaking and until the
telegraph office was open and he could wire his folk Harvey Cheyne was
perhaps the loneliest boy in all America But the curious thing was
that Disko and Dan seemed to think none the worse of him for crying

Wouverman was not ready for Diskos prices till Disko sure that the
_Were Here_ was at least a week ahead of any other Gloucester boat
had given him a few days to swallow them so all hands played about the
streets and Long Jack stopped the Rocky Neck trolley on principle as
he said till the conductor let him ride free But Dan went about with
his freckled nose in the air bungfull of mystery and most haughty to
his family

Dan Ill hev to lay inter you ef you act this way said Troop
pensively Sence weve come ashore this time youve bin a heap too
fresh

Id lay into him naow ef he was mine said Uncle Salters sourly He
and Penn boarded with the Troops

Oho said Dan shuffling with the accordion round the backyard ready
to leap the fence if the enemy advanced Dad youre welcome to your
own judgment but remember Ive warned ye Your own flesh an blood ha
warned ye Taint any o my fault ef youre mistook but Ill be on
deck to watch ye An ez fer yeou Uncle Salters Pharaohs chief
butler aint in it longside o you You watch aout an wait Youll be
plowed under like your own blamed clover but meDan TroopIll
flourish like a green baytree because I warnt stuck on my own
opinion

Disko was smoking in all his shore dignity and a pair of beautiful
carpetslippers Youre gettin ez crazy as poor Harve You two go
araound gigglin an squinchin an kickin each other under the table
till theres no peace in the haouse said he

Theres goin to be a heap lessfer some folks Dan replied You
wait an see

He and Harvey went out on the trolley to East Gloucester where they
tramped through the bayberry bushes to the lighthouse and lay down on
the big red boulders and laughed themselves hungry Harvey had shown
Dan a telegram and the two swore to keep silence till the shell burst

Harves folk said Dan with an unruffled face after supper Well I
guess they dont amount to much of anything or wed ha heard from em
by naow His pop keeps a kind o store out West Maybe hell give you
s much as five dollars Dad

What did I tell ye said Salters Dont sputter over your vittles
Dan



CHAPTER IX

Whatever his private sorrows may be a multimillionaire like any other
workingman should keep abreast of his business Harvey Cheyne senior
had gone East late in June to meet a woman broken down half mad who
dreamed day and night of her son drowning in the gray seas He had
surrounded her with doctors trained nurses massagewomen and even
faithcure companions but they were useless Mrs Cheyne lay still and
moaned or talked of her boy by the hour together to any one who would
listen Hope she had none and who could offer it All she needed was
assurance that drowning did not hurt and her husband watched to guard
lest she should make the experiment Of his own sorrow he spoke
littlehardly realized the depth of it till he caught himself asking
the calendar on his writingdesk Whats the use of going on

There had always lain a pleasant notion at the back of his head that
some day when he had rounded off everything and the boy had left
college he would take his son to his heart and lead him into his
possessions Then that boy he argued as busy fathers do would
instantly become his companion partner and ally and there would
follow splendid years of great works carried out togetherthe old head
backing the young fire Now his boy was deadlost at sea as it might
have been a Swede sailor from one of Cheynes big teaships the wife
dying or worse he himself was trodden down by platoons of women and
doctors and maids and attendants worried almost beyond endurance by
the shift and change of her poor restless whims hopeless with no
heart to meet his many enemies

He had taken the wife to his raw new palace in San Diego where she and
her people occupied a wing of great price and Cheyne in a
verandaroom between a secretary and a typewriter who was also a
telegraphist toiled along wearily from day to day There was a war of
rates among four Western railroads in which he was supposed to be
interested a devastating strike had developed in his lumber camps in
Oregon and the legislature of the State of California which has no
love for its makers was preparing open war against him

Ordinarily he would have accepted battle ere it was offered and have
waged a pleasant and unscrupulous campaign But now he sat limply his
soft black hat pushed forward on to his nose his big body shrunk
inside his loose clothes staring at his boots or the Chinese junks in
the bay and assenting absently to the secretarys questions as he
opened the Saturday mail

Cheyne was wondering how much it would cost to drop everything and pull
out He carried huge insurances could buy himself royal annuities and
between one of his places in Colorado and a little society that would
do the wife good say in Washington and the South Carolina islands a
man might forget plans that had come to nothing On the other hand

The click of the typewriter stopped the girl was looking at the
secretary who had turned white

He passed Cheyne a telegram repeated from San Francisco

Picked up by fishing schooner _Were Here_ having fallen off boat great
times on Banks fishing all well waiting Gloucester Mass care Disko
Troop for money or orders wire what shall do and how is Mama Harvey N
Cheyne

The father let it fall laid his head down on the rollertop of the
shut desk and breathed heavily The secretary ran for Mrs Cheynes
doctor who found Cheyne pacing to and fro

Whatwhat d you think of it Is it possible Is there any meaning to
it I cant quite make it out he cried

I can said the doctor I lose seven thousand a yearthats all
He thought of the struggling New York practice he had dropped at
Cheynes imperious bidding and returned the telegram with a sigh

You mean youd tell her May be a fraud

Whats the motive said the doctor coolly Detections too certain
Its the boy sure enough

Enter a French maid impudently as an indispensable one who is kept on
only by large wages

Mrs Cheyne she say you must come at once She think you are seek

The master of thirty millions bowed his head meekly and followed
Suzanne and a thin high voice on the upper landing of the great
whitewood square staircase cried What is it What has happened

No doors could keep out the shriek that rang through the echoing house
a moment later when her husband blurted out the news

And thats all right said the doctor serenely to the typewriter
About the only medical statement in novels with any truth to it is
that joy dont kill Miss Kinzey

I know it but weve a heap to do first Miss Kinzey was from
Milwaukee somewhat direct of speech and as her fancy leaned towards
the secretary she divined there was work in hand He was looking
earnestly at the vast rollermap of America on the wall

Milsom were going right across Private carstraight
throughBoston Fix the connections shouted Cheyne down the
staircase

I thought so

The secretary turned to the typewriter and their eyes met out of that
was born a storynothing to do with this story She looked
inquiringly doubtful of his resources He signed to her to move to the
Morse as a general brings brigades into action Then he swept his hand
musicianwise through his hair regarded the ceiling and set to work
while Miss Kinzeys white fingers called up the Continent of America

_K H Wade Los Angeles_ The Constance is at Los Angeles isnt she
Miss Kinzey

Yep Miss Kinzey nodded between clicks as the secretary looked at his
watch

Ready _Send Constance private car here and arrange for special to
leave here Sunday in time to connect with New York Limited at Sixteenth
Street Chicago Tuesday next_

Clickclickclick Couldnt you better that

Not on those grades That gives em sixty hours from here to Chicago
They wont gain anything by taking a special east of that Ready _Also
arrange with Lake Shore and Michigan Southern to take Constance on
New York Central and Hudson River Buffalo to Albany and B and A the
same Albany to Boston Indispensable I should reach Boston Wednesday
evening Be sure nothing prevents Have also wired Canniff Toucey and
Barnes_Sign Cheyne

Miss Kinzey nodded and the secretary went on

Now then Canniff Toucey and Barnes of course Ready _Canniff
Chicago Please take my private car Constance from Santa Fe at
Sixteenth Street next Tuesday p m on N Y Limited through to Buffalo
and deliver N Y C for Albany_Ever bin to N York Miss Kinzey
Well go some dayReady _Take car Buffalo to Albany on Limited
Tuesday p m_ Thats for Toucey

Havent bin to Noo York but I know that with a toss of the head

Beg pardon Now Boston and Albany Barnes same instructions from
Albany through to Boston Leave threefive P M you neednt wire
that arrive ninefive P M Wednesday That covers everything Wade
will do but it pays to shake up the managers

Its great said Miss Kinzey with a look of admiration This was the
kind of man she understood and appreciated

Tisnt bad said Milsom modestly Now any one but me would have
lost thirty hours and spent a week working out the run instead of
handing him over to the Santa Fe straight through to Chicago

But see here about that Noo York Limited Chauncey Depew himself
couldnt hitch his car to her Miss Kinzey suggested recovering
herself

Yes but this isnt Chauncey Its Cheynelightning It goes

Even so Guess wed better wire the boy Youve forgotten that
anyhow

Ill ask

When he returned with the fathers message bidding Harvey meet them in
Boston at an appointed hour he found Miss Kinzey laughing over the
keys Then Milsom laughed too for the frantic clicks from Los Angeles
ran We want to know whywhywhy General uneasiness developed and
spreading

Ten minutes later Chicago appealed to Miss Kinzey in these words If
crime of century is maturing please warn friends in time We are all
getting to cover here

This was capped by a message from Topeka and wherein Topeka was
concerned even Milsom could not guess Dont shoot Colonel Well
come down

Cheyne smiled grimly at the consternation of his enemies when the
telegrams were laid before him They think were on the warpath Tell
em we dont feel like fighting just now Milsom Tell em what were
going for I guess you and Miss Kinsey had better come along though it
isnt likely I shall do any business on the road Tell em the
truthfor once

So the truth was told Miss Kinzey clicked in the sentiment while the
secretary added the memorable quotation Let us have peace and in
board rooms two thousand miles away the representatives of sixtythree
million dollars worth of variously manipulated railroad interests
breathed more freely Cheyne was flying to meet the only son so
miraculously restored to him The bear was seeking his cub not the
bulls Hard men who had their knives drawn to fight for their financial
lives put away the weapons and wished him Godspeed while half a dozen
panicsmitten tinpot toads perked up their heads and spoke of the
wonderful things they would have done had not Cheyne buried the hatchet

It was a busy weekend among the wires for now that their anxiety was
removed men and cities hastened to accommodate Los Angeles called to
San Diego and Barstow that the Southern California engineers might know
and be ready in their lonely roundhouses Barstow passed the word to
the Atlantic and Pacific and Albuquerque flung it the whole length of
the Atchinson Topeka and Santa Fe management even into Chicago An
engine combinationcar with crew and the great and gilded Constance
private car were to be expedited over those two thousand three
hundred and fifty miles The train would take precedence of one hundred
and seventyseven others meeting and passing despatchers and crews of
every one of those said trains must be notified Sixteen locomotives
sixteen engineers and sixteen firemen would be neededeach and every
one the best available Two and one half minutes would be allowed for
changing engines three for watering and two for coaling Warn the
men and arrange tanks and chutes accordingly for Harvey Cheyne is in
a hurry a hurry a hurry sang the wires Forty miles an hour will
be expected and division superintendents will accompany this special
over their respective divisions From San Diego to Sixteenth Street
Chicago let the magic carpet be laid down Hurry Oh hurry

It will be hot said Cheyne as they rolled out of San Diego in the
dawn of Sunday Were going to hurry Mama just as fast as ever we
can but I really dont think theres any good of your putting on your
bonnet and gloves yet Youd much better lie down and take your
medicine Id play you a game of dominoes but its Sunday

Ill be good Oh I will be good Onlytaking off my bonnet makes me
feel as if wed never get there

Try to sleep a little Mama and well be in Chicago before you know

But its Boston Father Tell them to hurry

The sixfoot drivers were hammering their way to San Bernardino and the
Mohave wastes but this was no grade for speed That would come later
The heat of the desert followed the heat of the hills as they turned
east to the Needles and the Colorado River The car cracked in the
utter drouth and glare and they put crushed ice to Mrs Cheynes neck
and toiled up the long long grades past Ash Fork towards Flagstaff
where the forests and quarries are under the dry remote skies The
needle of the speedindicator flicked and wagged to and fro the
cinders rattled on the roof and a whirl of dust sucked after the
whirling wheels The crew of the combination sat on their bunks
panting in their shirtsleeves and Cheyne found himself among them
shouting old old stories of the railroad that every trainman knows
above the roar of the car He told them about his son and how the sea
had given up its dead and they nodded and spat and rejoiced with him
asked after her back there and whether she could stand it if the
engineer let her out a piece and Cheyne thought she could
Accordingly the great firehorse was let ut from Flagstaff to
Winslow till a division superintendent protested

But Mrs Cheyne in the boudoir stateroom where the French maid
sallowwhite with fear clung to the silver doorhandle only moaned a
little and begged her husband to bid them hurry And so they dropped
the dry sands and moonstruck rocks of Arizona behind them and grilled
on till the crash of the couplings and the wheeze of the brakehose
told them they were at Coolidge by the Continental Divide

Three bold and experienced mencool confident and dry when they
began white quivering and wet when they finished their trick at
those terrible wheelsswung her over the great lift from Albuquerque
to Glorietta and beyond Springer up and up to the Raton Tunnel on the
State line whence they dropped rocking into La Junta had sight of the
Arkansaw and tore down the long slope to Dodge City where Cheyne took
comfort once again from setting his watch an hour ahead

There was very little talk in the car The secretary and typewriter sat
together on the stamped Spanishleather cushions by the plateglass
observationwindow at the rear end watching the surge and ripple of
the ties crowded back behind them and it is believed making notes of
the scenery Cheyne moved nervously between his own extravagant
gorgeousness and the naked necessity of the combination an unlit cigar
in his teeth till the pitying crews forgot that he was their tribal
enemy and did their best to entertain him

At night the bunched electrics lit up that distressful palace of all
the luxuries and they fared sumptuously swinging on through the
emptiness of abject desolation

Now they heard the swish of a watertank and the guttural voice of a
Chinaman the clickclink of hammers that tested the Krupp steel
wheels and the oath of a tramp chased off the rearplatform now the
solid crash of coal shot into the tender and now a beating back of
noises as they flew past a waiting train Now they looked out into
great abysses a trestle purring beneath their tread or up to rocks
that barred out half the stars Now scour and ravine changed and rolled
back to jagged mountains on the horizons edge and now broke into
hills lower and lower till at last came the true plains

At Dodge City an unknown hand threw in a copy of a Kansas paper
containing some sort of an interview with Harvey who had evidently
fallen in with an enterprising reporter telegraphed on from Boston
The joyful journalese revealed that it was beyond question their boy
and it soothed Mrs Cheyne for a while Her one word hurry was
conveyed by the crews to the engineers at Nickerson Topeka and
Marceline where the grades are easy and they brushed the Continent
behind them Towns and villages were close together now and a man
could feel here that he moved among people

I cant see the dial and my eyes ache so What are we doing

The very best we can Mama Theres no sense in getting in before the
Limited Wed only have to wait

I dont care I want to feel were moving Sit down and tell me the
miles

Cheyne sat down and read the dial for her there were some miles which
stand for records to this day but the seventyfoot car never changed
its long steamerlike roll moving through the heat with the hum of a
giant bee Yet the speed was not enough for Mrs Cheyne and the heat
the remorseless August heat was making her giddy the clockhands
would not move and when oh when would they be in Chicago

It is not true that as they changed engines at Fort Madison Cheyne
passed over to the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers an
endowment sufficient to enable them to fight him and his fellows on
equal terms for evermore He paid his obligations to engineers and
firemen as he believed they deserved and only his bank knows what he
gave the crews who had sympathized with him It is on record that the
last crew took entire charge of switching operations at Sixteenth
Street because she was in a doze at last and Heaven was to help any
one who bumped her

Now the highly paid specialist who conveys the Lake Shore and Michigan
Southern Limited from Chicago to Elkhart is something of an autocrat
and he does not approve of being told how to back up to a car None the
less he handled the Constance as if she might have been a load of
dynamite and when the crew rebuked him they did it in whispers and
dumb show

Pshaw said the Atchinson Topeka and Santa Fe men discussing life
later we werent runnin for a record Harvey Cheynes wife she were
sick back an we didnt want to jounce her Come to think of it our
runnin time from San Diego to Chicago was 5754 You can tell that to
them Eastern waytrains When were tryin for a record well let you
know

To the Western man though this would not please either city Chicago
and Boston are cheek by jowl and some railroads encourage the
delusion The Limited whirled the Constance into Buffalo and the arms
of the New York Central and Hudson River illustrious magnates with
white whiskers and gold charms on their watchchains boarded her here
to talk a little business to Cheyne who slid her gracefully into
Albany where the Boston and Albany completed the run from tidewater
to tidewatertotal time eightyseven hours and thirtyfive minutes
or three days fifteen hours and one half Harvey was waiting for them

After violent emotion most people and all boys demand food They
feasted the returned prodigal behind drawn curtains cut off in their
great happiness while the trains roared in and out around them Harvey
ate drank and enlarged on his adventures all in one breath and when
he had a hand free his mother fondled it His voice was thickened with
living in the open salt air his palms were rough and hard his wrists
dotted with marks of gurrysores and a fine full flavour of codfish
hung round rubber boots and blue jersey

The father well used to judging men looked at him keenly He did not
know what enduring harm the boy might have taken Indeed he caught
himself thinking that he knew very little whatever of his son but he
distinctly remembered an unsatisfied doughfaced youth who took
delight in calling down the old man and reducing his mother to
tearssuch a person as adds to the gaiety of public rooms and hotel
piazzas where the ingenuous young of the wealthy play with or revile
the bellboys But this well setup fisheryouth did not wriggle
looked at him with eyes steady clear and unflinching and spoke in a
tone distinctly even startlingly respectful There was that in his
voice too which seemed to promise that the change might be permanent
and that the new Harvey had come to stay

Some ones been coercing him thought Cheyne Now Constance would
never have allowed that Dont see as Europe could have done it any
better

But why didnt you tell this man Troop who you were the mother
repeated when Harvey had expanded his story at least twice

Disko Troop dear The best man that ever walked a deck I dont care
who the next is

Why didnt you tell him to put you ashore You know Papa would have
made it up to him ten times over

I know it but he thought I was crazy Im afraid I called him a thief
because I couldnt find the bills in my pocket

A sailor found them by the flagstaff thatthat night sobbed Mrs
Cheyne

That explains it then I dont blame Troop any I just said I
wouldnt workon a Banker tooand of course he hit me on the nose
and oh I bled like a stuck hog

My poor darling They must have abused you horribly

Dunno quite Well after that I saw a light

Cheyne slapped his leg and chuckled This was going to be a boy after
his own hungry heart He had never seen precisely that twinkle in
Harveys eye before

And the old man gave me ten and a half a month hes paid me half now
and I took hold with Dan and pitched right in I cant do a mans work
yet But I can handle a dory most as well as Dan and I dont get
rattled in a fogmuch and I can take my trick in light windsthats
steering dearand I can most bait up a trawl and I know my ropes
of course and I can pitch fish till the cows come home and Im great
on old Josephus and Ill show you how I can clear coffee with a piece
of fishskin andI think Ill have another cup please Say youve
no notion what a heap of work there is in ten and a half a month

I began with eight and a half my son said Cheyne

That so You never told me sir

You never asked Harve Ill tell you about it some day if you care
to listen Try a stuffed olive

Troop says the most interesting thing in the world is to find out how
the next man gets his vittles Its great to have a trimmedup meal
again We were well fed though But mug on the Banks Disko fed us
firstclass Hes a great man And Danthats his sonDans my
partner And theres Uncle Salters and his manures an he reads
Josephus Hes sure Im crazy yet And theres poor little Penn and he
is crazy You mustnt talk to him about Johnstown because

And oh you must know Tom Platt and Long Jack and Manuel Manuel
saved my life Im sorry hes a Portuguee He cant talk much but hes
an everlasting musician He found me struck adrift and drifting and
hauled me in

I wonder your nervous system isnt completely wrecked said Mrs
Cheyne

What for Mama I worked like a horse and I ate like a hog and I slept
like a dead man

That was too much for Mrs Cheyne who began to think of her visions of
a corpse rocking on the salty seas She went to her stateroom and
Harvey curled up beside his father explaining his indebtedness

You can depend upon me to do everything I can for the crowd Harve
They seem to be good men on your showing

Best in the Fleet sir Ask at Gloucester said Harvey But Disko
believes still hes cured me of being crazy Dans the only one Ive
let on to about you and our private cars and all the rest of it and
Im not quite sure Dan believes I want to paralyze em tomorrow Say
cant they run the Constance over to Gloucester Mama dont look fit
to be moved anyway and were bound to finish cleaning out by
tomorrow Wouverman takes our fish You see were the first off the
Banks this season and its four twentyfive a quintal We held out
till he paid it They want it quick

You mean youll have to work tomorrow then

I told Troop I would Im on the scales Ive brought the tallies with
me He looked at the greasy notebook with an air of importance that
made his father choke There isnt but threenotwo ninetyfour or
five quintal more by my reckoning

Hire a substitute suggested Cheyne to see what Harvey would say

Cant sir Im tallyman for the schooner Troop says Ive a better
head for figures than Dan Troops a mighty just man

Well suppose I dont move the Constance tonight howll you fix
it

Harvey looked at the clock which marked twenty past eleven

Then Ill sleep here till three and catch the four oclock freight
They let us men from the Fleet ride free as a rule

Thats a notion But I think we can get the Constance around about
as soon as your mens freight Better go to bed now

Harvey spread himself on the sofa kicked off his boots and was asleep
before his father could shade the electrics Cheyne sat watching the
young face under the shadow of the arm thrown over the forehead and
among many things that occurred to him was the notion that he might
perhaps have been neglectful as a father

One never knows when ones taking ones biggest risks he said It
might have been worse than drowning but I dont think it hasI dont
think it has If it hasnt I havent enough to pay Troop thats all
and I dont think it has

Morning brought a fresh sea breeze through the windows the Constance
was sidetracked among freightcars at Gloucester and Harvey had gone
to his business

Then hell fall overboard again and be drowned the mother said
bitterly

Well go and look ready to throw him a rope in case Youve never
seen him working for his bread said the father

What nonsense As if any one expected

Well the man that hired him did Hes about right too

They went down between the stores full of fishermens oilskins to
Wouvermans wharf where the _Were Here_ rode high her Bank flag still
flying all hands busy as beavers in the glorious morning light Disko
stood by the main hatch superintending Manuel Penn and Uncle Salters
at the tackle Dan was swinging the loaded baskets inboard as Long Jack
and Tom Platt filled them and Harvey with a notebook represented the
skippers interests before the clerk of the scales on the
saltsprinkled wharfedge

Ready cried the voices below Haul cried Disko Hi said
Manuel Here said Dan swinging the basket Then they heard Harveys
voice clear and fresh checking the weights

The last of the fish had been whipped out and Harvey leaped from the
stringpiece six feet to a ratline as the shortest way to hand Disko
the tally shouting Two ninetyseven and an empty hold

Whats the total Harve said Disko

Eight sixtyfive Three thousand six hundred and seventysix dollars
and a quarter Wish Id share as well as wage

Well I wont go so far as to say you hevnt deserved it Harve Dont
you want to slip up to Wouvermans office and take him our tallies

Whos that boy said Cheyne to Dan well used to all manner of
questions from those idle imbeciles called summer boarders

Well hes kind o supercargo was the answer We picked him up
struck adrift on the Banks Fell overboard from a liner he sez He was
a passenger Hes by way o hem a fisherman now

Is he worth his keep

Yeep Dad this man wants to know ef Harves worth his keep Say
would you like to go aboard Well fix up a ladder for her

I should very much indeed Twont hurt you Mama and youll be able
to see for yourself

The woman who could not lift her head a week ago scrambled down the
ladder and stood aghast amid the mess and tangle aft

Be you anyways interested in Harve said Disko

Well yees

Hes a good boy an ketches right hold jest as hes bid Youve heard
haow we found him He was sufferin from nervous prostration I guess
r else his head had hit somethin when we hauled him aboard Hes all
over that naow Yes this is the cabin Taint in order but youre
quite welcome to look araound Those are his figures on the stovepipe
where we keep the reckonin mostly

Did he sleep here said Mrs Cheyne sitting on a yellow locker and
surveying the disorderly bunks

No He berthed forward madam an only fer him an my boy hookin
fried pies an muggin up when they ought to ha been asleep I dunno as
Ive any special fault to find with him

There werent nothin wrong with Harve said Uncle Salters
descending the steps He hung my boots on the maintruck and he aint
over an above respectful to such as knows moren he do specially
about farmin but he were mostly misled by Dan

Dan in the meantime profiting by dark hints from Harvey early that
morning was executing a wardance on deck Tom Tom he whispered
down the hatch His folks has come an Dad haint caught on yet an
theyre powwowin in the cabin Shes a daisy an hes all Harve
claimed he was by the looks of him

Howly Smoke said Long Jack climbing out covered with salt and
fishskin Dye belave his tale av the kid an the little fourhorse
rig was thrue

I knew it all along said Dan Come an see Dad mistook in his
judgments

They came delightedly just in time to hear Cheyne say Im glad he
has a good character becausehes my son

Diskos jaw fellLong Jack always vowed that he heard the click of
itand he stared alternately at the man and the woman

I got his telegram in San Diego four days ago and we came over

In a private car said Dan He said ye might

In a private car of course

Dan looked at his father with a hurricane of irreverent winks

There was a tale he told us av drivin four little ponies in a rig av
his own said Long Jack Was that thrue now

Very likely said Cheyne Was it Mama

He had a little drag when we were in Toledo I think said the mother

Long Jack whistled Oh Disko said he and that was all

I wuzI am mistook in my jedgmentsworsen the men o Marblehead
said Disko as though the words were being windlassed out of him I
dont mind ownin to you Mr Cheyne as I mistrusted the boy to be
crazy He talked kinder odd about money

So he told me

Did he tell ye anything else Cause I pounded him once This with a
somewhat anxious glance at Mrs Cheyne

Oh yes Cheyne replied I should say it probably did him more good
than anything else in the world

I jedged twuz necessary er I wouldnt ha done it I dont want you
to think we abuse our boys any on this packet

I dont think you do Mr Troop

Mrs Cheyne had been looking at the facesDiskos ivoryyellow
hairless iron countenance Uncle Salterss with its rim of
agricultural hair Penns bewildered simplicity Manuels quiet smile
Long Jacks grin of delight and Tom Platts scar Rough by her
standards they certainly were but she had a mothers wits in her
eyes and she rose with outstretched hands

Oh tell me which is who said she half sobbing I want to thank
you and bless youall of you

Faith that pays me a hunder time said Long Jack

Disko introduced them all in due form The captain of an oldtime
Chinaman could have done no better and Mrs Cheyne babbled
incoherently She nearly threw herself into Manuels arms when she
understood that he had first found Harvey

But how shall I leave him dreeft said poor Manuel What do you
yourself if you find him so Eh whaat We are in one good boy and I
am ever so pleased he come to be your son

And he told me Dan was his partner she cried Dan was already
sufficiently pink but he turned a rich crimson when Mrs Cheyne kissed
him on both cheeks before the assembly Then they led her forward to
show her the focsle at which she wept again and must needs go down
to see Harveys identical bunk and there she found the nigger cook
cleaning up the stove and he nodded as though she were some one he had
expected to meet for years They tried two at a time to explain the
boats daily life to her and she sat by the pawlpost her gloved
hands on the greasy table laughing with trembling lips and crying with
dancing eyes

And whos ever to use the _Were Here_ after this said Long Jack to
Tom Platt I feel as if shed made a cathedral av ut all

Cathedral sneered Tom Platt Oh if it had bin even the Fish
Cmmission boat instid of this ballyhoo o blazes If we only hed some
decency an order an sideboys when she goes over Shell have to
climb that ladder like a hen an wewe ought to be mannin the yards

Then Harvey was not mad said Penn slowly to Cheyne

No indeedthank God the big millionaire replied stooping down
tenderly

It must be terrible to be mad Except to lose your child I do not
know anything more terrible But your child has come back Let us thank
God for that

Hello cried Harvey looking down upon them benignly from the wharf

I wuz mistook Harve I wuz mistook said Disko swiftly holding up
a hand I wuz mistook in my jedgments Ye neednt rub in any more

Guess Ill take care o that said Dan under his breath

Youll be goin off naow wont ye

Well not without the balance of my wages less you want to have the
_Were Here_ attached

Thets so Id clean forgot and he counted out the remaining
dollars You done all you contracted to do Harve and you done it
baouts well as if youd been brought up Here Disko brought himself
up He did not quite see where the sentence was going to end

Outside of a private car suggested Dan wickedly

Come on and Ill show her to you said Harvey

Cheyne stayed to talk with Disko but the others made a procession to
the depot with Mrs Cheyne at the head The French maid shrieked at
the invasion and Harvey laid the glories of the Constance before
them without a word They took them in in equal silencestamped
leather silver doorhandles and rails cut velvet plateglass
nickel bronze hammered iron and the rare woods of the continent
inlaid

I told you said Harvey I told you This was his crowning revenge
and a most ample one

Mrs Cheyne decreed a meal and that nothing might be lacking to the
tale Long Jack told afterwards in his boardinghouse she waited on
them herself Men who are accustomed to eat at tiny tables in howling
gales have curiously neat and finished manners but Mrs Cheyne who
did not know this was surprised She longed to have Manuel for a
butler so silently and easily did he comport himself among the frail
glassware and dainty silver Tom Platt remembered the great days on the
Ohio and the manners of foreign potentates who dined with the officers
and Long Jack being Irish supplied the small talk till all were at
their ease

In the _Were Heres_ cabin the fathers took stock of each other behind
their cigars Cheyne knew well enough when he dealt with a man to whom
he could not offer money equally well he knew that no money could pay
for what Disko had done He kept his own counsel and waited for an
opening

I hevnt done anything to your boy or fer your boy excep make him
work a piece an learn him how to handle the hogyoke said Disko He
has twice my boys head for figgers

By the way Cheyne answered casually what dyou calculate to make
of your boy

Disko removed his cigar and waved it comprehensively round the cabin
Dans jest plain boy an he dont allow me to do any of his thinkin
Hell hev this able little packet when Im laid by He aint noways
anxious to quit the business I know that

Mmm Ever been West Mr Troop

Bins fer ez Noo York once in a boat Ive no use for railroads No
more hez Dan Salt waters good enough fer the Troops Ive been most
everywherein the natral way o course

I can give him all the salt water hes likely to needtill hes a
skipper

Haows that I thought you wuz a kinder railroad king Harve told me
so whenI was mistook in my jedgments

Were all apt to be mistaken I fancied perhaps you might know I own a
line of teaclippersSan Francisco to Yokohamasix of
emironbuilt about seventeen hundred and eighty tons apiece

Blame that boy He never told Id ha listened to that instid o his
truck abaout railroads an ponycarriages

He didnt know

Little thing like that slipped his mind I guess

No I only capttook hold of the Blue M freightersMorgan and
McQuades old linethis summer Disko collapsed where he sat beside
the stove

Great Caesar Almighty I mistrust Ive been fooled from one end to the
other Why Phil Airheart he went from this very town six year
backno sevenan hes mate on the San Josenowtwentysix days
was her time out His sister shes livin here yet an she reads his
letters to my woman An you own the Blue M freighters

Cheyne nodded

If Id known that Id ha jerked the _Were Here_ back to port all
standin on the word

Perhaps that wouldnt have been so good for Harvey

If Id only known If hed only said about the cussed Line Id ha
understood Ill never stand on my own jedgments againnever Theyre
wellfound packets Phil Airheart he says so

Im glad to have a recommend from that quarter Airhearts skipper of
the San Jose now What I was getting at is to know whether youd lend
me Dan for a year or two and well see if we cant make a mate of him
Would you trust him to Airheart

Its a resk taking a raw boy

I know a man who did more for me

Thats diffrunt Look at here naow I aint recommendin Dan special
because hes my own flesh an blood I know Bank ways aint clipper
ways but he haint much to learn Steer he canno boy better if I
say itan the rests in our blood an get but I could wish he warnt
so cussed weak on navigation

Airheart will attend to that Hell ship as boy for a voyage or two
and then we can put him in the way of doing better Suppose you take
him in hand this winter and Ill send for him early in the spring I
know the Pacifics a long ways off

Pshaw We Troops livin an dead are all around the earth an the
seas thereof

But I want you to understandand I mean thisany time you think
youd like to see him tell me and Ill attend to the transportation
Twont cost you a cent

If youll walk a piece with me well go to my house an talk this to
my woman Ive bin so crazy mistook in all my jedgments it dont seem
to me this was like to be real

They went bluetrimmed of nasturtiums over to Troops
eighteenhundreddollar white house with a retired dory full in the
front yard and a shuttered parlour which was a museum of oversea
plunder There sat a large woman silent and grave with the dim eyes
of those who look long to sea for the return of their beloved Cheyne
addressed himself to her and she gave consent wearily

We lose one hundred a year from Gloucester only Mr Cheyne she
saidone hundred boys an men and Ive come sos to hate the sea as
if twuz alive an listenin God never made it fer humans to anchor
on These packets o yours they go straight out I take it and
straight home again

As straight as the winds let em and I give a bonus for record
passages Tea dont improve by being at sea

When he wuz little he used to play at keeping store an I had hopes
he might follow that up But soons he could paddle a dory I knew that
were goin to be denied me

Theyre squareriggers Mother ironbuilt an well found Remember
what Phils sister reads you when she gits his letters

Ive never known as Phil told lies but hes too venturesome like
most of em that use the sea If Dan sees fit Mr Cheyne he can
gofer all o me

She jest despises the ocean Disko explained an II dunno haow to
act polite I guess er Id thank you better

My fathermy own eldest brothertwo nephewsan my second sisters
man she said dropping her head on her hand Would you care fer any
one that took all those

Cheyne was relieved when Dan turned up and accepted with more delight
than he was able to put into words Indeed the offer meant a plain and
sure road to all desirable things but Dan thought most of commanding
watch on broad decks and looking into faraway harbours

Mrs Cheyne had spoken privately to the unaccountable Manuel in the
matter of Harveys rescue He seemed to have no desire for money
Pressed hard he said that he would take five dollars because he
wanted to buy something for a girl OtherwiseHow shall I take money
when I make so easy my eats and smokes You will giva some if I like or
no Eh whaat Then you shall giva me money but not that way You
shall giva all you can think He introduced her to a snuffy Portuguese
priest with a list of semidestitute widows as long as his cassock As
a strict Unitarian Mrs Cheyne could not sympathize with the creed
but she ended by respecting the brown voluble little man

Manuel faithful son of the Church appropriated all the blessings
showered on her for her charity That letta me out said he I have
now ver good absolutions for six months and he strolled forth to get
a handkerchief for the girl of the hour and to break the hearts of all
the others

Salters went West for a season with Penn and left no address behind
He had a dread that these millionary people with wasteful private
cars might take undue interest in his companion It was better to
visit inland relatives till the coast was clear Never you be adopted
by rich folk Penn he said in the cars or Ill take n break this
checkerboard over your head Ef you forgit your name aginwhich is
Prattyou remember you belong with Salters Troop an set down right
where you are till I come fer you Dont go taggin araound after them
whose eyes bung out with fatness accordin to Scripcher



CHAPTER X

But it was otherwise with the _Were Heres_ silent cook for he came
up his kit in a handkerchief and boarded the Constance Pay was no
particular object and he did not in the least care where he slept His
business as revealed to him in dreams was to follow Harvey for the
rest of his days They tried argument and at last persuasion but
there is a difference between one Cape Breton and two Alabama negroes
and the matter was referred to Cheyne by the cook and porter The
millionaire only laughed He presumed Harvey might need a bodyservant
some day or other and was sure that one volunteer was worth five
hirelings Let the man stay therefore even though he called himself
MacDonald and swore in Gaelic The car could go back to Boston where
if he were still of the same mind they would take him West

With the Constance which in his heart of hearts he loathed departed
the last remnant of Cheynes millionairedom and he gave himself up to
an energetic idleness This Gloucester was a new town in a new land
and he purposed to take it in as of old he had taken in all the
cities from Snohomish to San Diego of that world whence he hailed They
made money along the crooked street which was half wharf and half
ships store as a leading professional he wished to learn how the
noble game was played Men said that four out of every five fishballs
served at New Englands Sunday breakfast came from Gloucester and
overwhelmed him with figures in proofstatistics of boats gear
wharffrontage capital invested salting packing factories
insurance wages repairs and profits He talked with the owners of
the large fleets whose skippers were little more than hired men and
whose crews were almost all Swedes or Portuguese Then he conferred
with Disko one of the few who owned their craft and compared notes in
his vast head He coiled himself away on chaincables in marine
junkshops asking questions with cheerful unslaked Western curiosity
till all the waterfront wanted to know what in thunder that man was
after anyhow He prowled into the Mutual Insurance rooms and
demanded explanations of the mysterious remarks chalked up on the
blackboard day by day and that brought down upon him secretaries of
every Fishermans Widow and Orphan Aid Society within the city limits
They begged shamelessly each man anxious to beat the other
institutions record and Cheyne tugged at his beard and handed them
all over to Mrs Cheyne

She was resting in a boardinghouse near Eastern Pointa strange
establishment managed apparently by the boarders where the
tablecloths were redandwhitecheckered and the population who
seemed to have known one another intimately for years rose up at
midnight to make Welsh rarebits if it felt hungry On the second
morning of her stay Mrs Cheyne put away her diamond solitaires before
she came down to breakfast

Theyre most delightful people she confided to her husband so
friendly and simple too though they are all Boston nearly

That isnt simpleness Mama he said looking across the boulders
behind the appletrees where the hammocks were slung Its the other
thing that what I havent got

It cant be said Mrs Cheyne quietly There isnt a woman here owns
a dress that cost a hundred dollars Why we

I know it dear We haveof course we have I guess its only the
style they wear East Are you having a good time

I dont see very much of Harvey hes always with you but I aint
near as nervous as I was

I havent had such a good time since Willie died I never rightly
understood that I had a son before this Harves got to be a great boy
Anything I can fetch you dear Cushion under your head Well well
go down to the wharf again and look around

Harvey was his fathers shadow in those days and the two strolled
along side by side Cheyne using the grades as an excuse for laying his
hand on the boys square shoulder It was then that Harvey noticed and
admired what had never struck him beforehis fathers curious power of
getting at the heart of new matters as learned from men in the street

How dyou make em tell you everything without opening your head
demanded the son as they came out of a riggers loft

Ive dealt with quite a few men in my time Harve and one sizes em
up somehow I guess I know something about myself too Then after a
pause as they sat down on a wharfedge Men can most always tell
when a man has handled things for himself and then they treat him as
one of themselves

Same as they treat me down at Wouvermans wharf Im one of the crowd
now Disko has told every one Ive earned my pay Harvey spread out
his hands and rubbed the palms together Theyre all soft again he
said dolefully

Keep em that way for the next few years while youre getting your
education You can harden em up after

Yees I suppose so was the reply in no delighted voice

It rests with you Harve You can take cover behind your mama of
course and put her on to fussing about your nerves and your
highstrungness and all that kind of poppycock

Have I ever done that said Harvey uneasily

His father turned where he sat and thrust out a long hand You know as
well as I do that I cant make anything of you if you dont act
straight by me I can handle you alone if youll stay alone but I
dont pretend to manage both you and Mama Lifes too short anyway

Dont make me out much of a fellow does it

I guess it was my fault a good deal but if you want the truth you
havent been much of anything up to date Now have you

Umm Disko thinks    Say what dyou reckon its cost you to raise
me from the startfirst last and all over

Cheyne smiled Ive never kept track but I should estimate in
dollars and cents nearer fifty than forty thousand maybe sixty The
young generation comes high It has to have things and it tires of
em andthe old man foots the bill

Harvey whistled but at heart he was rather pleased to think that his
upbringing had cost so much And all thats sunk capital isnt it

Invested Harve Invested I hope

Making it only thirty thousand the thirty Ive earned is about ten
cents on the hundred Thats a mighty poor catch Harvey wagged his
head solemnly

Cheyne laughed till he nearly fell off the pile into the water

Disko has got a heap more than that out of Dan since he was ten and
Dans at school half the year too

Oh thats what youre after is it

No Im not after anything Im not stuck on myself any just
nowthats all    I ought to be kicked

I cant do it old man or I would I presume if Id been made that
way

Then Id have remembered it to the last day I livedand never
forgiven you said Harvey his chin on his doubled fists

Exactly Thats about what Id do You see

I see The faults with me and no one else All the same somethings
got to be done about it

Cheyne drew a cigar from his vestpocket bit off the end and fell to
smoking Father and son were very much alike for the beard hid
Cheynes mouth and Harvey had his fathers slightly aquiline nose
closeset black eyes and narrow high cheekbones With a touch of
brown paint he would have made up very picturesquely as a Red Indian of
the storybooks

Now you can go on from here said Cheyne slowly costing me between
six or eight thousand a year till youre a voter Well well call you
a man then You can go right on from that living on me to the tune of
forty or fifty thousand besides what your mother will give you with a
valet and a yacht or a fancyranch where you can pretend to raise
trottingstock and play cards with your own crowd

Like Lorry Tuck Harvey put in

Yep or the two De Vitre boys or old man McQuades son Californias
full of em and heres an Eastern sample while were talking

A shiny black steamyacht with mahogany deckhouse nickelplated
binnacles and pinkandwhitestriped awnings puffed up the harbour
flying the burgee of some New York club Two young men in what they
conceived to be sea costumes were playing cards by the saloon skylight
and a couple of women with red and blue parasols looked on and laughed
noisily

Shouldnt care to be caught out in her in any sort of a breeze No
beam said Harvey critically as the yacht slowed to pick up her
mooringbuoy

Theyre having what stands them for a good time I can give you that
and twice as much as that Harve Howd you like it

Caesar Thats no way to get a dinghy overside said Harvey still
intent on the yacht If I couldnt slip a tackle better than that Id
stay ashore    What if I dont

Stay ashoreor what

Yacht and ranch and live on the old man andget behind Mama where
theres trouble said Harvey with a twinkle in his eye

Why in that case you come right in with me my son

Ten dollars a month Another twinkle

Not a cent more until youre worth it and you wont begin to touch
that for a few years

Id sooner begin sweeping out the officeisnt that how the big bugs
startand touch something now than

I know it we all feel that way But I guess we can hire any sweeping
we need I made the same mistake myself of starting in too soon

Thirty million dollars worth o mistake wasnt it Id risk it for
that

I lost some and I gained some Ill tell you

Cheyne pulled his beard and smiled as he looked over the still water
and spoke away from Harvey who presently began to be aware that his
father was telling the story of his life He talked in a low even
voice without gesture and without expression and it was a history for
which a dozen leading journals would cheerfully have paid many
dollarsthe story of forty years that was at the same time the story
of the New West whose story is yet to be written

It began with a kinless boy turned loose in Texas and went on
fantastically through a hundred changes and chops of life the scenes
shifting from State after Western State from cities that sprang up in
a month andin a season utterly withered away to wild ventures in
wilder camps that are now laborious paved municipalities It covered
the building of three railroads and the deliberate wreck of a fourth
It told of steamers townships forests and mines and the men of
every nation under heaven manning creating hewing and digging
these It touched on chances of gigantic wealth flung before eyes that
could not see or missed by the merest accident of time and travel and
through the mad shift of things sometimes on horseback more often
afoot now rich now poor in and out and back and forth deckhand
trainhand contractor boardinghouse keeper journalist engineer
drummer realestate agent politician deadbeat rumseller
mineowner speculator cattleman or tramp moved Harvey Cheyne
alert and quiet seeking his own ends and so he said the glory and
advancement of his country

He told of the faith that never deserted him even when he hung on the
ragged edge of despairthe faith that comes of knowing men and things
He enlarged as though he were talking to himself on his very great
courage and resource at all times The thing was so evident in the
mans mind that he never even changed his tone He described how he had
bested his enemies or forgiven them exactly as they had bested or
forgiven him in those careless days how he had entreated cajoled and
bullied towns companies and syndicates all for their enduring good
crawled round through or under mountains and ravines dragging a
string and hoopiron railroad after him and in the end how he had sat
still while promiscuous communities tore the last fragments of his
character to shreds

The tale held Harvey almost breathless his head a little cocked to one
side his eyes fixed on his fathers face as the twilight deepened and
the red cigarend lit up the furrowed cheeks and heavy eyebrows It
seemed to him like watching a locomotive storming across country in the
darka mile between each glare of the open firedoor but this
locomotive could talk and the words shook and stirred the boy to the
core of his soul At last Cheyne pitched away the cigarbutt and the
two sat in the dark over the lapping water

Ive never told that to any one before said the father

Harvey gasped Its just the greatest thing that ever was said he

Thats what I got Now Im coming to what I didnt get It wont sound
much of anything to you but I dont wish you to be as old as I am
before you find out I can handle men of course and Im no fool along
my own lines butbutI cant compete with the man who has been
taught Ive picked up as I went along and I guess it sticks out all
over me

Ive never seen it said the son indignantly

You will though Harve You willjust as soon as youre through
college Dont I know it Dont I know the look on mens faces when
they think me aa mucker as they call it out here I can break them
to little piecesyesbut I cant get back at em to hurt em where
they live I dont say theyre way way up but I feel Im way way
way off somehow Now youve got your chance Youve got to soak up
all the learning thats around and youll live with a crowd that are
doing the same thing Theyll be doing it for a few thousand dollars a
year at most but remember youll be doing it for millions Youll
learn law enough to look after your own property when Im out o the
light and youll have to be solid with the best men in the market
they are useful later and above all youll have to stow away the
plain common sitdownwithyour chinon yourelbows booklearning
Nothing pays like that Harve and its bound to pay more and more each
year in our countryin business and in politics Youll see

Theres no sugar in my end of the deal said Harvey Four years at
college Wish Id chosen the valet and the yacht

Never mind my son Cheyne insisted Youre investing your capital
where itll bring in the best returns and I guess you wont find our
property shrunk any when youre ready to take hold Think it over and
let me know in the morning Hurry Well be late for supper

As this was a business talk there was no need for Harvey to tell his
mother about it and Cheyne naturally took the same point of view But
Mrs Cheyne saw and feared and was a little jealous Her boy who rode
roughshod over her was gone and in his stead reigned a keenfaced
youth abnormally silent who addressed most of his conversation to his
father She understood it was business and therefore a matter beyond
her premises If she had any doubts they were resolved when Cheyne
went to Boston and brought back a new diamond marquise ring

What have you two been doing now she said with a weak little smile
as she turned it in the light

Talkingjust talking Mama theres nothing mean about Harvey

There was not The boy had made a treaty on his own account Railroads
he explained gravely interested him as little as lumber real estate
or mining What his soul yearned after was control of his fathers
newly purchased sailingship If that could be promised him within what
he conceived to be a reasonable time he for his part guaranteed
diligence and sobriety at college for four or five years In vacation
he was to be allowed full access to all details connected with the
linehe had not asked more than two thousand questions about itfrom
his fathers most private papers in the safe to the tug in San
Francisco harbour

Its a deal said Cheyne at the last Youll alter your mind twenty
times before you leave college o course but if you take hold of it
in proper shape and if you dont tie it up before youre twentythree
Ill make the thing over to you Hows that Harve

Nope never pays to split up a going concern Theres too much
competition in the world anyway and Disko says bloodkin hev to stick
together His crowd never go back on him Thats one reason he says
why they make such big fares Say the _Were Here_ goes off to the
Georges on Monday They dont stay long ashore do they

Well we ought to be going too I guess Ive left my business hung
up at loose ends between two oceans and its time to connect again I
just hate to do it though havent had a holiday like this for twenty
years

We cant go without seeing Disko off said Harvey and Mondays
Memorial Day Lets stay over that anyway

What is this memorial business They were talking about it at the
boardinghouse said Cheyne weakly He too was not anxious to spoil
the golden days

Well as far as I can make out this business is a sort of
songanddance act whacked up for the summer boarders Disko dont
think much of it he says because they take up a collection for the
widows and orphans Diskos independent Havent you noticed that

Wellyes A little In spots Is it a town show then

The summer convention is They read out the names of the fellows
drowned or gone astray since last time and they make speeches and
recite and all Then Disko says the secretaries of the Aid Societies
go into the back yard and fight over the catch The real show he says
is in the spring The ministers all take a hand then and there arent
any summer boarders around

I see said Cheyne with the brilliant and perfect comprehension of
one born into and bred up to city pride Well stay over for Memorial
Day and get off in the afternoon

Guess Ill go down to Diskos and make him bring his crowd up before
they sail Ill have to stand with them of course

Oh thats it is it said Cheyne Im only a poor summer boarder
and youre

A Bankerfullblooded Banker Harvey called back as he boarded a
trolley and Cheyne went on with his blissful dreams for the future

Disko had no use for public functions where appeals were made for
charity but Harvey pleaded that the glory of the day would be lost so
far as he was concerned if the _Were Heres_ absented themselves Then
Disko made conditions He had heardit was astonishing how all the
world knew all the worlds business along the waterfronthe had heard
that a Philadelphia actresswoman was going to take part in the
exercises and he mistrusted that she would deliver Skipper Iresons
Ride Personally he had as little use for actresses as for summer
boarders but justice was justice and though he himself here Dan
giggled had once slipped up on a matter of judgment this thing must
not be So Harvey came back to East Gloucester and spent half a day
explaining to an amused actress with a royal reputation on two
seaboards the inwardness of the mistake she contemplated and she
admitted that it was justice even as Disko had said

Cheyne knew by old experience what would happen but anything of the
nature of a public palaver was meat and drink to the mans soul He saw
the trolleys hurrying west in the hot hazy morning full of women in
light summer dresses and whitefaced strawhatted men fresh from
Boston desks the stack of bicycles outside the post office the
comeandgo of busy officials greeting one another the slow flick and
swash of bunting in the heavy air and the important man with a hose
sluicing the brick sidewalk

Mother he said suddenly dont you rememberafter Seattle was
burned outand they got her going again

Mrs Cheyne nodded and looked critically down the crooked street Like
her husband she understood these gatherings all the West over and
compared them one against another The fishermen began to mingle with
the crowd about the townhall doorsbluejowled Portuguese their
women bareheaded or shawled for the most part cleareyed Nova
Scotians and men of the Maritime Provinces French Italians Swedes
and Danes with outside crews of coasting schooners and everywhere
women in black who saluted one another with gloomy pride for this was
their day of great days And there were ministers of many
creedspastors of great giltedged congregations at the seaside for
a rest with shepherds of the regular workfrom the priests of the
Church on the Hill to bushbearded exsailor Lutherans hailfellow
with the men of a score of boats There were owners of lines of
schooners large contributors to the societies and small men their
few craft pawned to the mastheads with bankers and marineinsurance
agents captains of tugs and waterboats riggers fitters lumpers
salters boatbuilders and coopers and all the mixed population of
the waterfront

They drifted along the line of seats made gay with the dresses of the
summer boarders and one of the town officials patrolled and perspired
till he shone all over with pure civic pride Cheyne had met him for
five minutes a few days before and between the two there was entire
understanding

Well Mr Cheyne and what dyou think of our cityYes madam you
can sit anywhere you pleaseYou have this kind of thing out West I
presume

Yes but we arent as old as you

Thats so of course You ought to have been at the exercises when we
celebrated our two hundred and fiftieth birthday I tell you Mr
Cheyne the old city did herself credit

So I heard It pays too Whats the matter with the town that it
dont have a firstclass hotel though

Right over there to the left Pedro Heaps o room for you and your
crowdWhy thats what I tell em all the time Mr Cheyne Theres
big money in it but I presume that dont affect you any What we want
is

A heavy hand fell on his broadcloth shoulder and the flushed skipper
of a Portland coalandice coaster spun him half round What in
thunder do you fellows mean by clappin the law on the town when all
decent men are at sea this way Heh Towns dry as a bone an smells a
sight worse sence I quit Might ha left us one saloon for soft
drinks anyway

Dont seem to have hindered your nourishment this morning Carsen
Ill go into the politics of it later Sit down by the door and think
over your arguments till I come back

What good is arguments to me In Miquelon champagnes eighteen dollars
a case and The skipper lurched into his seat as an organprelude
silenced him

Our new organ said the official proudly to Cheyne Cost us four
thousand dollars too Well have to get back to highlicense next year
to pay for it I wasnt going to let the ministers have all the
religion at their convention Those are some of our orphans standing up
to sing My wife taught em See you again later Mr Cheyne Im
wanted on the platform

High clear and true childrens voices bore down the last noise of
those settling into their places

O all ye Works of the Lord bless ye the Lord praise him and magnify
him for ever

The women throughout the hall leaned forward to look as the reiterated
cadences filled the air Mrs Cheyne with some others began to
breathe short she had hardly imagined there were so many widows in the
world and instinctively searched for Harvey He had found the _Were
Heres_ at the back of the audience and was standing as by right
between Dan and Disko Uncle Salters returned the night before with
Penn from Pamlico Sound received him suspiciously

Haint your folk gone yet he grunted What are you doin here
young feller

O ye Seas and Floods bless ye the Lord praise him and magnify him
for ever

Haint he good right said Dan Hes bin there same as the rest of
us

Not in them clothes Salters snarled

Shut your head Salters said Disko Your biles gone back on you
Stay right where ye are Harve

Then up and spoke the orator of the occasion another pillar of the
municipality bidding the world welcome to Gloucester and incidentally
pointing out wherein Gloucester excelled the rest of the world Then he
turned to the seawealth of the city and spoke of the price that must
be paid for the yearly harvest They would hear later the names of
their lost dead one hundred and seventeen of them The widows stared a
little and looked at one another here Gloucester could not boast any
overwhelming mills or factories Her sons worked for such wage as the
sea gave and they all knew that neither Georges nor the Banks were
cowpastures The utmost that folk ashore could accomplish was to help
the widows and the orphans and after a few general remarks he took
this opportunity of thanking in the name of the city those who had so
publicspiritedly consented to participate in the exercises of the
occasion

I jest despise the beggin pieces in it growled Disko It dont
give folk a fair notion of us

Ef folk wont be forehanded an put by when theyve the chance
returned Salters it stands in the nature o things they hev to be
shamed You take warnin by that young feller Riches endureth but
for a season ef you scatter them araound on lugsuries

But to lose everything everything said Penn What can you do then
Once Ithe watery blue eyes stared up and down as if looking for
something to steady themonce I readin a book I thinkof a boat
where every one was run downexcept some oneand he said to me

Shucks said Salters cutting in You read a little less an take
more intrust in your vittles and youll come nearer earnin your
keep Penn

Harvey jammed among the fishermen felt a creepy crawly tingling
thrill that began in the back of his neck and ended at his boots He
was cold too though it was a stifling day

That the actress from Philadelphia said Disko Troop scowling at the
platform Youve fixed it about old man Ireson haint ye Harve Ye
know why naow

It was not Iresons Ride that the woman delivered but some sort of
poem about a fishingport called Brixham and a fleet of trawlers
beating in against storm by night while the women made a guiding fire
at the head of the quay with everything they could lay hands on

 They took the grandmas blanket
 Who shivered and bade them go
 They took the babys cradle
 Who could not say them no

Whew said Dan peering over Long Jacks shoulder Thats great
Must ha bin expensive though

Groundhog case said the Galway man Badly lighted port Danny

      
 And knew not all the while
 If they were lighting a bonfire
 Or only a funeral pile

The wonderful voice took hold of people by their heartstrings and when
she told how the drenched crews were flung ashore living and dead and
they carried the bodies to the glare of the fires asking Child is
this your father or Wife is this your man you could hear hard
breathing all over the benches


 And when the boats of Brixham
 Go out to face the gales
 Think of the love that travels
 Like light upon their sails

There was very little applause when she finished The women were
looking for their handkerchiefs and many of the men stared at the
ceiling with shiny eyes

Hm said Salters that ud cost ye a dollar to hear at any
theatremaybe two Some folk I presoom can afford it Seems
downright waste to me    Naow how in Jerusalem did Cap Bart
Edwardes strike adrift here

No keepin him under said an Eastport man behind Hes a poet an
hes baound to say his piece Comes from daown aour way too

He did not say that Captain B Edwardes had striven for five
consecutive years to be allowed to recite a piece of his own
composition on Gloucester Memorial Day An amused and exhausted
committee had at last given him his desire The simplicity and utter
happiness of the old man as he stood up in his very best Sunday
clothes won the audience ere he opened his mouth They sat unmurmuring
through sevenandthirty hatchetmade verses describing at fullest
length the loss of the schooner _Joan Hasken_ off the Georges in the gale
of 1867 and when he came to an end they shouted with one kindly throat

A farsighted Boston reporter slid away for a full copy of the epic and
an interview with the author so that earth had nothing more to offer
Captain Bart Edwardes exwhaler shipwright masterfisherman and
poet in the seventythird year of his age

Naow I call that sensible said the Eastport man Ive bin over
that graound with his writin jest as he read it in my two hands and
I can testify that hes got it all in

If Dan here couldnt do bettern that with one hand before breakfast
he ought to be switched said Salters upholding the honor of
Massachusetts on general principles Not but what Im free to own hes
considerable litteryfer Maine Still

Guess Uncle Salterss goin to die this trip Fust compliment hes
ever paid me Dan sniggered Whats wrong with you Harve You act
all quiet and you look greenish Feelin sick

Dont know whats the matter with me Harvey implied Seems if my
insides were too big for my outsides Im all crowded up and shivery

Dispepsy Pshawtoo bad Well wait for the readin an then well
quit an catch the tide

The widowsthey were nearly all of that seasons makingbraced
themselves rigidly like people going to be shot in cold blood for they
knew what was coming The summerboarder girls in pink and blue
shirtwaists stopped tittering over Captain Edwardess wonderful poem
and looked back to see why all was silent The fishermen pressed
forward as that town official who had talked to Cheyne bobbed up on the
platform and began to read the years list of losses dividing them
into months Last Septembers casualties were mostly single men and
strangers but his voice rang very loud in the stillness of the hall

September 9th Schooner _Florrie Anderson_ lost with all aboard off
the Georges

Reuben Pitman master 50 single Main Street City

Emil Olsen 19 single 329 Hammond Street City Denmark

Oscar Standberg single 25 Sweden

Carl Stanberg single 28 Main Street City

Pedro supposed Madeira single Keenes boardinghouse City

Joseph Welsh alias Joseph Wright 30 St Johns Newfoundland

NoAugusty Maine a voice cried from the body of the hall

He shipped from St Johns said the reader looking to see

I know it He belongs in Augusty My nevvy

The reader made a pencilled correction on the margin of the list and
resumed

Same schooner Charlie Ritchie Liverpool Nova Scotia 33 single

Albert May 267 Rogers Street City 27 single

September 27thOrvin Dollard 30 married drowned in dory off
Eastern Point

That shot went home for one of the widows flinched where she sat
clasping and unclasping her hands Mrs Cheyne who had been listening
with wideopened eyes threw up her head and choked Dans mother a
few seats to the right saw and heard and quickly moved to her side
The reading went on By the time they reached the January and February
wrecks the shots were falling thick and fast and the widows drew
breath between their teeth

February 14thSchooner _Harry Randolph_ dismasted on the way home from
Newfoundland Asa Musie married 32 Main Street City lost overboard

February 23dSchooner _Gilbert Hope_ went astray in dory Robert
Beavon 29 married native of Pubnico Nova Scotia

But his wife was in the hall They heard a low cry as though a little
animal had been hit It was stifled at once and a girl staggered out
of the hall She had been hoping against hope for months because some
who have gone adrift in dories have been miraculously picked up by
deepsea sailingships Now she had her certainty and Harvey could see
the policeman on the sidewalk hailing a hack for her Its fifty cents
to the depotthe driver began but the policeman held up his
handbut Im goin there anyway Jump right in Look at here Al you
dont pull me next time my lamps aint lit See

The sidedoor closed on the patch of bright sunshine and Harveys eyes
turned again to the reader and his endless list

April 19thSchooner _Mamie Douglas_ lost on the Banks with all hands

Edward Canton 43 master married City

D Hawkins alias Williams 34 married Shelbourne Nova Scotia

G W Clay coloured 28 married City

And so on and so on Great lumps were rising in Harveys throat and
his stomach reminded him of the day when he fell from the liner

May 10thSchooner _Were Here_ the blood tingled all over him Otto
Svendson 20 single City lost overboard

Once more a low tearing cry from somewhere at the back of the hall

She shouldnt ha come She shouldnt ha come said Long Jack with
a cluck of pity

Dont scrowge Harve grunted Dan Harvey heard that much but the
rest was all darkness spotted with fiery wheels Disko leaned forward
and spoke to his wife where she sat with one arm round Mrs Cheyne
and the other holding down the snatching catching ringed hands

Lean your head daownright daown he whispered Itll go off in a
minute

I caant I dodont Oh let me Mrs Cheyne did not at all know
what she said

You must Mrs Troop repeated Your boys jest fainted dead away
They do that some when theyre gettin their growth Wish to tend to
him We can git aout this side Quite quiet You come right along with
me Psha my dear were both women I guess We must tend to aour
menfolk Come

The _Were Heres_ promptly went through the crowd as a bodyguard and
it was a very white and shaken Harvey that they propped up on a bench
in an anteroom

Favours his ma was Mrs Troops only comment as the mother bent
over her boy

How dyou suppose he could ever stand it she cried indignantly to
Cheyne who had said nothing at all It was horriblehorrible We
shouldnt have come Its wrong and wicked Itit isnt right
Whywhy couldnt they put these things in the papers where they
belong Are you better darling

That made Harvey very properly ashamed Oh Im all right I guess
he said struggling to his feet with a broken giggle Must ha been
something I ate for breakfast

Coffee perhaps said Cheyne whose face was all in hard lines as
though it had been cut out of bronze We wont go back again

Guess twould be baouts well to git daown to the wharf said Disko
Its close in along with them Dagoes an the fresh air will fresh
Mrs Cheyne up

Harvey announced that he never felt better in his life but it was not
till he saw the _Were Here_ fresh from the lumpers hands at
Wouvermans wharf that he lost his alloverish feelings in a queer
mixture of pride and sorrowfulness Other peoplesummer boarders and
suchlikeplayed about in catboats or looked at the sea from
pierheads but he understood things from the insidemore things than
he could begin to think about None the less he could have sat down
and howled because the little schooner was going off Mrs Cheyne
simply cried and cried every step of the way and said most
extraordinary things to Mrs Troop who babied her till Dan who had
not been babied since he was six whistled aloud

And so the old crowdHarvey felt like the most ancient of mariners
dropped into the old schooner among the battered dories while Harvey
slipped the sternfast from the pierhead and they slid her along the
wharfside with their hands Every one wanted to say so much that no
one said anything in particular Harvey bade Dan take care of Uncle
Salterss seaboots and Penns doryanchor and Long Jack entreated
Harvey to remember his lessons in seamanship but the jokes fell flat
in the presence of the two women and it is hard to be funny with green
harbourwater widening between good friends

Up jib and foresl shouted Disko getting to the wheel as the wind
took her See you later Harve Dunno but I come near thinkin a heap
o you an your folks

Then she glided beyond earshot and they sat down to watch her up the
harbour And still Mrs Cheyne wept

Pshaw my dear said Mrs Troop were both women I guess Likes
not itll ease your heart to hev your cry aout God He knows it never
done me a mite o good but then He knows Ive had something to cry
fer


Now it was a few years later and upon the other edge of America that
a young man came through the clammy sea fog up a windy street which is
flanked with most expensive houses built of wood to imitate stone To
him as he was standing by a hammered iron gate entered on
horsebackand the horse would have been cheap at a thousand
dollarsanother young man And this is what they said

Hello Dan

Hello Harve

Whats the best with you

Well Im sos to be that kind o animal called second mate this trip
Aint you most through with that triple invoiced college of yours

Getting that way I tell you the Leland Stanford Junior isnt a
circumstance to the old _Were Here_ but Im coming into the business
for keeps next fall

Meanin aour packets

Nothing else You just wait till I get my knife into you Dan Im
going to make the old line lie down and cry when I take hold

Ill resk it said Dan with a brotherly grin as Harvey dismounted
and asked whether he were coming in

Thats what I took the cable fer but say is the doctor anywheres
araound Ill draown that crazy nigger some day his one cussed joke
an all

There was a low triumphant chuckle as the excook of the _Were Here_
came out of the fog to take the horses bridle He allowed no one but
himself to attend to any of Harveys wants

Thick as the Banks aint it doctor said Dan propitiatingly

But the coalblack Celt with the secondsight did not see fit to reply
till he had tapped Dan on the shoulder and for the twentieth time
croaked the old old prophecy in his ear

Masterman Manmaster said he You remember Dan Troop what I
said On the _Were Here_

Well I wont go so far as to deny that it do look like it as things
stand at present said Dan She was a noble packet and one way an
another I owe her a heapher and Dad

Me too quoth Harvey Cheyne
