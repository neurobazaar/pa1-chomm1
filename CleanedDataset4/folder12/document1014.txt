THE LURE OF THE DIM TRAILS

By B M Bower




CHAPTER I IN SEARCH OF THE WESTERN TONE

What do you care anyway asked ReeveHoward philosophically It
isnt as if you depended on the work for a living Why worry over the
fact that a mere pastime fails to be financially a success You dont
need to write

Neither do you need to slave over those drypoint things Thurston
retorted in none the best humor with his comforter Youve an income
bigger than mine yet you toil over Greciannosed women with untidy hair
as if each one meant a meal and a bed

A meal and a bedthats good you must think I live like a king

And I notice you hate like the mischief to fail even though

Only I never have failed put in ReeveHoward with the amused
complacency born of much adulation

Thurston kicked a footrest out of his way Well I have The fashion
now is for swashbuckling tales with a haze of powder smoke rising
to high heaven The public taste runs to gore and more gore and
kidnappings of beautiful maidensbah

Follow the fashion thenif you must write Get out of your pink tea
and orchid atmosphere and take your heroines out Westaway out beyond
the Mississippi and let them be kidnapped Or New Mexico would do

New Mexico is also beyond the Mississippi I believe Thurston hinted

Perhaps it is What I mean is write what the public wants since you
dont relish failure Why dont you do things about the plains It
ought to be easy and you were born out there somewhere It should come
natural

I have Thurston sighed My last rejection states that the local
color is weak and unconvincing Hang the local color The footrest
suffered again

ReeveHoward was getting into his topcoat languidly as he did
everything else The thing to do then he drawled is to go out and
study up on it Get in touch with that country and your local color
will convince Personally though I like those little society skits you
do

Skits exploded Thurston My last was a fourpart serial I never did
a skit in my life

Beg pardonwhich is more than you did after accusing my studies of
having untidy hair Dont look so glum Phil Go out and learn your
West a month or so will put you up to dateand by Jove I half envy
you the trip

That is what put the idea into Thurstons head and as Thurstons ideas
generally bore fruit of one sort or another he went out that very day
and ordered from his tailor a complete riding outfit and because he
was a good customer the tailor consented to rush the work It seemed to
Thurston looking over cuts of the very latest styles in riding clothes
that already he was breathing the atmosphere of the plains

That night he stayed at home and dreamed of the West His memory
coupled with what he had heard and idealized by his imagination
conjured dim visions of what he had once known had known and forgotten
of a land here men and conditions harked back to the raw foundations
of civilization where wide plains flecked with sagebrush and ribboned
with faint brown trails spread away and away to a far skyline For
Phil Thurston was rangeborn if not rangebred His father had chosen
always to live out on the edge of thingsout where the trails of men
are dim and far apartand the silent prairie bequeaths a heritage of
distancehunger to her sons

While he brooded grew a keen longing to see again the little town
huddled under the bare brown hills that shut out the world to see the
gayblanketed Indians who stole like painted shadows about the place
and the broad river always hurrying away to the sunrise He had been
afraid of the river and of the bare hills and the Indians He felt that
his mother also had been afraid He pictured againand he picture was
blurred and indistinctthe day when strange men had brought his father
mysteriously home men who were silent save for the shuffling of their
feet and who carried their big hats awkwardly in their hands

There had been a day of hushed voices and much weeping and gloom and
he had been afraid to play Then they had carried his father as
mysteriously away again and his mother had hugged him close and cried
bitterly and long The rest was blank When one is only five the
present quickly blurs what is past and he wondered that after
all these years he should feel the grip of something very like
homesicknessand for something more than half forgotten But though
he did not realize it in his veins flowed the adventurous blood of his
father and to it the dim trails were calling

In four days he set his face eagerly toward the dun deserts and the
sagebrush gray

At Chicago a man took the upper berth in Thurstons section and settled
into the seat with a deep sighpresumably of thankfulness Thurston
with the quick eye of those who write observed the whiteness of his
ungloved hands the coppery tan of cheeks and throat the clear keenness
of his eyes and the four dimples in the crown of his soft gray hat
and recognized him as a fine specimen of the Western type of farmer
returning home from the stockmans Mecca After that he went calmly back
to his magazine and forgot all about him

Twenty miles out the stranger leaned forward and tapped him lightly on
the knee Say I hate to interrupt yuh he began in a whimsical drawl
evidently characteristic of the man but Id like to know where it is
Ive seen yuh before

Thurston glanced up impersonally hesitated between annoyance and a
natural desire to be courteous and replied that he had no memory of
any previous meeting

Mebby not admitted the other and searched the face of Thurston with
his keen eyes It came to Phil that they were also a bit wistful but he
went unsympathetically back to his reading

Five miles more and be touched Thurston again apologetically yet
insistently Say he drawled aint your name Thurston Ill bet
a carload uh steers it isBud Thurston And your home range is Fort
Benton

Phil stared and confessed to all but the Bud

Thats what me and your dad always called yuh the man asserted
Well Ill be hanged But I knew it I knew Id run acrost yuh
somewheres Youre the dead image uh your dad Bill Thurston And me and
Bill freighted together from Whoopup to Benton along in the seventies
Before yuh was born we was chums I dont reckon youd remember me Hank
Graves that used to pack yuh around on his back and fill yuh up on
dried pruneswhen dried prunes was worth money Yuh used to call em
frumes andWhy it was me with your dad when the Indians potshot
him at Chimney Rock and it was me helped your mother straighten things
up so she could pull out back where she come from She never took to
the West much How is she Dead Too bad she was a mighty fine woman
your mother was

Well Illbehanged Bud Thurston little towheaded Bud that used to
holler for frumes if he seen me coming a mile off Doggone your measly
hide wheres all them pink apurns yuh used to wear He leaned back and
laugheda silent inner convulsion of pure gladness

Philip Thurston was generally speaking a conservative young man
and one slow to make friends slower still to discard them He was
astonished to feel a choky sensation in his throat and a stinging of
eyelids and a leap in his blood To be thus taken possession of by
a bluntspeaking stranger not at all in his class to be addressed
as Bud and informed that he once devoured dried prunes to be told
Doggone your measly hide should have affronted him much Instead he
seemed to be swept mysteriously back into the primitive past and to
feel akin to this stranger with the drawl and the keen eyes It was the
blood of his father coming to its own

From that hour the two were friends Hank Graves in his whimsical
drawl told Phil things about his father that made his blood tingle
with pride his father whom he had almost forgotten yet who had lived
bravely his life daring where other men quailed going steadfastly upon
his way when other men hesitated

So borne swiftly into the West they talked and the time seemed short
The train had long since been racing noisily over the silent prairies
spread invitingly with tender greengreat lonely inscrutable luring
men with a spell as sure and as strong as is the spell of the sea

The train reeled across a trestle that spanned a deep dry gash in the
earth In the green bottom huddled a cluster of pygmy cattle and mounted
men farther down were two white flakes of tents like huge snowflakes
left unmelted in the green canyon

Thats the Lazy Eightmy outfit Graves informed Thurston with the
unconscious pride of possession pointing a forefinger as they whirled
on Ive got to get off next station Yuh want to remember Bud the
Lazy Eights your home from now on Well make a cowpuncher of yuh in
no time youve got it in yuh or yuh wouldnt look so much like your
dad And you can write stories about us all yuh wantwe wont kick
The way Ive got the summer planned out youll waller chindeep in
material all yuh got to do is foller the Lazy Eight through till
shipping time

Thurston had not intended learning to be a cowpuncher or following
the Lazy Eight or any other hieroglyphic through till shipping
timewhenever that was

But facing Hank Graves he had not the heart to tell him so or that he
had planned to spend only a monthor six weeks at mostin the West
gathering local color and perhaps a plot or two and a few types
Thurston was great on types

The train slowed at a little station with a dismal red section house in
the immediate background and a redfronted saloon close beside Here
we are cried Graves and I aint sorry only I wisht you was going
to stop right now But Ill look for yuh in three or four days at the
outside Solong Bud Remember the Lazy Eights your hangout



CHAPTER II LOCAL COLOR IN THE RAW

For the rest of the way Thurston watched the green hills slide byand
the greener hollowsand gave himself up to visions of Fort Benton
visions of creaking bulltrains crawling slowly like giant brown worms
up and down the long hill of many highpiled bales of buffalo hides
upon the river bank and clamorous little steamers churning up against
the current the Fort Benton that had for many rushing miles filled
and colored the speech of Hank Graves and stimulated his childish
halfmemory

But when he reached the place and wandered aimlessly about the streets
the vision faded into halfresentful realization that these things were
no more forever For the bulltrains a roundup outfit clattered
noisily out of town and disappeared in an elusive dustcloud for the
gayblanketed Indians slipping like painted shadows from view stray
cowboys galloped into town slid from their saddles and clanked with
dragging rowels into the nearest saloon or the postoffice Between
whiles the town cuddled luxuriously down in the deep little valley
and slept while the river undisturbed by pompous steamers murmured a
lullaby

It was not the Fort Benton he had come far to see so that on the second
day he went away up the long hill that shut out the world and until the
eastbound train came from over the prairies paced the depot platform
impatiently with never a vision to keep him company

For a long time the gaze of Thurston clung fascinated to the wide
prairie land feeling again the stir in his blood Then when a deep cut
shut from him the sight of the wilderness he chanced to turn his head
and looked straight into the clear bluegray eyes of a girl across
the aisle Thurston considered himself immune from bluegrayor any
othereyes so that he permitted himself to regard her calmly and
judicially his mind reverting to the fact that he would need a heroine
to be kidnapped and wondering if she would do She was a Western girl
he could tell that by the tan and by her various little departures from
the Eastern stylessuch as doing her hair low rather than high Where
he had been used to seeing the hair of woman piled high and skewered
with many pins hers was brushed smoothly backsmoothly save for little
irresponsible waves here and there Thurston decided that the style was
becoming to her He wondered if the fellow beside her were her brother
and then reminded himself sagely that brothers do not as a rule devote
their time quite so assiduously to the entertainment of their sisters
He could not stare at her forever and so he gave over his speculations
and went back to the prairies

Another hour and Thurston was stiffing a yawn when the coaches bumped
sharply together and with wheels screeching protest as the brakes
clutched them the train grinding protest in every joint came with a
final heavy jar to a dead stop Thurston thought it was a wreck until
out ahead came the sharp crackling of rifles A passenger behind him
leaned out of the window and a bullet shattered the glass above his
head he drew back hastily

Some one hurried through the front vestibule the door was pushed
unceremoniously open and a mana giant he seemed to Thurstonstopped
just inside glared down the length of the coach through slits in the
black cloth over his face and bawled Hands up

Thurston was so utterly surprised that his hands jerked themselves
involuntarily above his head though he did not feel particularly
frightened he was filled with a stupefied sort of curiosity to know
what would come next The coach so far as he could see seemed filled
with uplifted trembling hands so that he did not feel ashamed of his
own The man behind him put up his hands with the otherbut one of them
held a revolver that barked savagely and unexpectedly close against the
car of Thurston Thurston ducked There was an echo from the front and
the man behind who risked so much on one shot lurched into the aisle
swaying uncertainly between the seats He of the mask fired again
viciously and the other collapsed into a still awkwardly huddled heap
on the floor The revolver dropped from his fingers and struck against
Thurstons foot making him wince

Thurston had never before seen death come to a man and the very
suddenness of it unnerved him All his faculties were numbed before that
terrible pitiless form in the door and the limp dead body at his feet
in the aisle He did not even remember that here was the savage
local color he had come far aseeking He quite forgot to improve the
opportunity by making mental note of all the little convincing details
as was his wont

Presently he awoke to the realization of certain words spoken
insistently close beside him He turned his eyes and saw that the girl
her eyes staring straight before her her slim brown hands uplifted
was yet commanding him imperiously her voice holding to that murmuring
monotone more discreet than a whisper

The gundrop downand get it He cant see to shoot for the seat in
front Get the gun Get the gun was what she was saying

Thurston looked at her helplessly imploringly In truth he had never
fired a gun in all his peaceful life

The gunget itand shoot Her eyes moved quickly in a cautious
sidelong glance that commanded impatiently Her straight eyebrows drew
together imperiously Then when he met her eyes with that same helpless
look she said another word that hurt It was Coward

Thurston looked down at the gun and at the huddled form A tiny river
of blood was creeping toward him Already it had reached his foot and
his shoe was red along the sole He moved his foot quickly away from it
and shuddered

Coward murmured the girl contemptuously again and a splotch of anger
showed under the tan of her cheek

Thurston caught his breath and wondered if he could do it he looked
toward the door and thought how far it was to send a bullet straight
when a man has never in all his life fired a gun And without looking
he could see that horrible red stream creeping toward him like some
monster in a nightmare His flesh crimpled with physical repulsion but
he meant to try perhaps he could shoot the man in the mask so that
there would be another huddled lifeless Thing on the floor and another
creeping red stream

At that instant the tawnyhaired young fellow beside the girl gathered
himself for a spring flung himself headlong before her and into the
aisle caught the dead mans pistol from the floor and fired seemingly
with one movement Then he sprang up still firing as fast as the
trigger could move From the door came answer shot for shot and the
car was filled with the stifling odor of burnt powder A woman screamed
hysterically

Then a puff of cool prairie breeze came in through the shattered window
behind Thurston and the smokecloud lifted like a curtain blown upward
in the wind The tawnyhaired young fellow was walking coolly down the
aisle the smoking revolver pointing like an accusing finger toward the
outlaw who lay stretched upon his face his fingers twitching

Outside rifles were crackling like corn in a giant popper Presently
it slackened to an occasional shot A brakeman followed by two coatless
mailclerks with Winchesters ran down the length of the train calling
out that there was no danger The thud of their running feet and the
wholesome mingling of their shouting struck sharply in the silence after
the shooting One of the men swung up on the steps of the day coach and
came in

Hello Park he cried to the tawny haired boy Got one did yuh
Thats good We did too got him alive Think uh the nerve uh that
Wagner bunch to go up against a train in broad daylight Made an easy
getaway too except the feller we gloomed in the express car Hows
this one Dead

No I reckon hell get well enough to stretch a rope he killed a man
in here He motioned toward the huddled figure in the aisle They came
together lifted the dead man and carried him away to the baggage car
A brakeman came with a cloth and wiped up the red pool and Thurston
pressed his lips tightly together and turned away his head he could not
remember when the sight of anything had made him so deathly sick Once
he glanced slyly at the girl opposite and saw that she was very white
under her tan and that the hands in her lap were clasped tightly and
yet shook But she met his eyes squarely and Thurston did not look at
her again he did not like the expression of her mouth

News of the holdup had been telegraphed ahead and all Shellannewhich
was not much of a crowdgathered at the station to meet the train and
congratulate the heroes Thurston alighted almost shamefacedly into the
midst of the loudvoiced commotion While he was looking uncertainly
about him wondering where to go and what to do a voice he knew hailed
him with drawling welcome

Hello Bud Got back quicker than you expected didnt yuh Its lucky
I happened to be in townyuh can ride out with me Say yuh got quite
a bunch uh local color for a story didnt yuh Youll be writing
bloodandthunder for a month on the strength of this little episode I
reckon his twinkling eyes teased though his face was quite serious
as was his voice

She of the bluegray eyes turned and measured Thurston with a
deliberate leisurely glance and her mouth still had that unpleasant
expression Thurston colored guiltily but Hank Graves lifted his hat
and called her Mona and asked her if she wasnt scared stiff and if
she were home to stay Then he beckoned to the tawnyhaired fellow with
his finger and winked at Monaa proceeding which shocked Thurston
considerably

Monahere hold on a minute cant yuh Mona this is a friend uh
mine Bud Thurstons his name Hes come out to study us up and round up
a hunch uh real Western atmosphere Hes a storywriter I used to whack
bulls all over the country with his father Bud this is Mona Stevens
she ranges down close to the Lazy Eight so the sooner yuh git
acquainted the quicker He did not explain what would be the quicker
and Thurstons embarrassment was only aggravated by the introduction

Miss Stevens gave him a chilly smile the kind that is worse than none
at all and turned her back thinly pretending that she heard her brother
calling her which she did not Her brother was loudly explaining what
would have happened if he had been on that train and had got a whack at
the robbers and his sister was far from his mind

Graves slapped the shoulder of the fellow they had called Park
You young devil next time I leave the place for a weekyes or
overnightIll lock yuh up in the blacksmith shop Have yuh got to be
Monas special escort these days

Wish I was Park retorted unmoved

Different hereyuh aint much account as it is Bud this heres my
wagonboss Park Holloway one of em that is Im going to turn yuh
over to him and let him wise yuh up Say you young bucks ought to get
along together pretty smooth Your dads run buffalo together before
either of yuh was born Well lets be movingwe aint home yet Got a
warbag Bud

Late that night Thurston lay upon a homemade bed and listened to the
frogs croaking monotonously in the hollow behind the house and to
the lone coyote which harped upon the subject of his wrongs away on a
distant hillside and to the subdued snoring of Hank Graves in the room
beyond He was trying to adjust himself to this new condition of things
and the new condition refused utterly to be measured by his accepted
standard

According to that standard he should feel repulsed and annoyed by the
familiarity of strangers who persisted in calling him Bud without
taking the trouble to find out whether or not he liked it And what
puzzled Thurston and put him all at sea was the consciousness that he
did like it and that it struck familiarly upon his ears as something to
which he had been accustomed in the past

Also according to his wellordered past he should hate this raw life
and rawer country where could occur such brutal things as he had that
day witnessed He should dislike a man like Park Holloway who having
wounded a man unto death had calmly dismissed the subject with the
regret that his aim had not been better so that he could have saved the
county the expense of trying and hanging the fellow Thurston was amazed
to find that down in the inner man of him he admired Park Holloway
exceedingly and privately resolved to perfect himself in the use of
firearms he who had been wont to deplore the thinly veneered savagery
of men who liked such things

After much speculation he decided that Mona Stevens would not do for a
kidnapped heroine He could not seem to see her in such a position
and besides he told himself that such a type of girl did not attract
him at all She had called him a cowardand why simply because he
straight from the trammels of civilization had not been prepared to
meet the situation thrust upon himwhich she had thrust upon him She
had demanded of him something he had not the power to accomplish and
she had called him a coward And in his heart Thurston knew that it was
unjust and that he was not a coward



CHAPTER III FIRST IMPRESSIONS

Thurston dressed immaculately in riding clothes of the latest English
cut went airily down the stairs and discovered that he was not early
as he had imagined Seven oclock he had told himself proudly was not
bad for a beginner and he had smiled in anticipation of Hank Graves
surprise which was fortunate since he would otherwise have been cheated
of smiling at all For Hank Graves he learned from the cook had eaten
breakfast at five and had left the ranch more than an hour before the
men also were scattered to their work

Properly humbled in spirit he sat down to the kitchen table and ate his
belated breakfast while the cook kneaded bread at the other end of the
same table and eyed Thurston with frank amusement Thurston had never
before been conscious of feeling ill at ease in the presence of a
servant and hurried through the meal so that he could escape into the
clear sunshine feeling a bit foolish in the unaccustomed bagginess of
his riding breeches and the snugness of his leggings for he had never
taken to outdoor sports except as an onlooker from the shade of a grand
stand or piazza

While he was debating the wisdom of writing a detailed description of
yesterdays tragedy while it was still fresh in his mind and stowing it
away for future color Park Holloway rode into the yard and on to the
stables He nodded at Thurston and grinned without apparent cause as
the cook had done Thurston followed him to the corral and watched him
pull the saddle off his horse and throw it carelessly to one side It
looked cumbersome that saddle quite unlike the ones he had inspected
in the New York shops He grasped the horn lifted upon it and said
Jove

Heavy aint it Park laughed and slipped the bridle down over the
ears of his horse and dismissed him with a slap on the rump Dont yuh
like the looks of it he added indulgently

Thurston engaged in wondering what all those little strings were for
felt the indulgence and straightened How should I know he retorted
Anyone can see that my ignorance is absolute I expect you to laugh at
me Mr Holloway

Call me Park said he of the tawny hair and leaned against the fence
looking extremely boyish and utterly incapable of walking calmly down
upon a barking revolver and shooting as he went Youre bound to learn
all about saddles and what theyre made for he went on So long as
yuh dont get swellheaded the first time yuh stick on a horse that
sidesteps a little or back down from a few hard knocks youll be all
right

Thurston had not intended getting out and actually living the life he
had come to observe but something got in his nerves and his blood and
bred an impulse to which he yielded without reserve Park see
here he said eagerly Graves said hed turn me over to you so you
coulderteach me wisdom Its deuced rough on you but I hope you
wont refuse to be bothered with me I want to learneverything And I
want you to find fault like the mischief anderknock me into shape
if its possible He was very modest over his ignorance and his voice
rang true

Park studied him gravely Bud he said at last youll do Youre
greener right now than a bluejoint meadow in June but yuh got the
right stuff in yuh and its a go with me You come along with us after
that trailherd and youll get knocked into shape fast enough Smoke

Thurston shook his head Not those

I dunno Im afraid yuh cant be the real thing unless yuh fan your
lungs with cigarette smoke regular The twinkle belied him though
Say where did you pick them bloomers

They were made in New York Thurston smiled in sickly fashion He had
all along been uncomfortably aware of the sharp contrast between his own
modish attire and the somewhat disreputable leathern chaps of his hosts
foreman

Well commented Park you told me to find fault like the mischief
and Im going to call your bluff This heres Montana recollect and I
raise the long howl over them habiliments The best thing you can do is
pace along to the house and discard before the boys get sight of yuh
Theyd queer yuh with the whole outfit sure Uh course he went on
soothingly when he saw the resentment in Thurstons eyes I expect
theyre real stylishback Eastbut the boys aint educated to stand
for anything like that theyd likely tell yuh they set like the hide
on the hind legs of an elephantwhich is a fact I hate to say it Kid
but they sure do look like the devil

So would you in New York Thurston flung back at him

Why sure But this aint New York this heres the Lazy Eight corral
and Im doing yuh a favor You wouldnt like to have the boys shooting
holes through the slack would yuh You amble right along and get some
pants onand when youve wised up some youll thank me a lot Im going
on a little jaunt down the creek before dinner and you might go along
youll need to get hardened to the saddle anyway before we start for
Billings or youll do most uh riding on the messwagon

Thurston albeit in resentful mood went meekly and did as he was
commanded to do and no man save Park and the cook ever glimpsed those
smart riding clothes of English cut

Now yuh look a heap more human was the way Park signified his
approval of the change Heres a little horse thats easy to ride and
dead gentle if yuh dont spur him in the neck which you aint liable
to do at present and Hank says you can have this saddle for keeps Hank
used to ride it but he outgrowed it and got one longer in the seat
When we start for Billings to trail up them cattle of course youll get
a string of your own to ride

A string Im afraid I dont quite understand

Yuh dont savvy riding a string A string mson is ten or a dozen
saddlehorses that yuh ride turn about and nobody else has got any
right to top one every fellow has got his own string yuh see

Thurston eyed his horse distrustfully I think he ventured one will
be enough for me Ill scarcely need a dozen The truth was that he
thought Park was laughing at him

Park slid sidewise in the saddle and proceeded to roll another
cigarette Id be willing to bet that by fall youll have a goodsized
string rode down to a whisper You wait wait till it gets in your
blood Why Id die if you took me off the range Wait till yuh set out
in the dark on your horse and count the stars and watch the big dipper
swing around towards morning and listen to the cattle breathing close
bysleeping while you ride around em playing guardian angel over their
dreams Wait till yuh get up at daybreak and are in the saddle with
the pink uh sunrise and know youll sleep fifteen or twenty miles from
there that night and yuh lay down at night with the smell of new grass
in your nostrils where your bed had bruised it

Why Bud if youre a man youll be plumb spoiled for your little
old East Then he swung back his feet and the horses broke into a lope
which jarred the unaccustomed frame of Thurston mightily though he kept
the pace doggedly

Ive got to go down to the Stevens place Park informed him You
met Mona yesterdayit was her come down on the train with me yuh
remember Thurston did remember very distinctly Hank says yuh compose
stories Is that right

Thurstons mind came back from wondering how Mona Stevens mouth looked
when she was pleased with one and he nodded

Well theres a lot in this country that aint ever been wrote about I
guess at least if it was I never read it and I read considerable But
the trouble is them that know aint in the writing business and them
that write dont know The way Ive figured it they set back East
somewhere and write it like they think maybe it is and its a hell of a
job they make of it

Thurston remembering the time when he too set back East and wrote
it like he thought maybe it was blushed guiltily He was thankful that
his stories of the West had without exception been rejected as of
little worth He shuddered to think of one of them falling into the
hands of Park Holloway

I came out to learn and I want to learn it thoroughly he said in
the face of much physical discomfort Just then the horses slowed for a
climb and he breathed thanks In the first place he began again when
he had readjusted himself carefully in the saddle I wish youd tell me
just where you are going with the wagons and what you mean by trailing
a herd

Why I thought I said we were going to Billings Park answered
surprised What were going to do when we get there is to receive a
shipment of cattle young steer thats coming up from the Panhandle which
is a part uh Texas And we trail em up here and turn em loose this
side the river After that well start the calf roundup The Lazy Eight
runs two wagons yuh know I run one and Deacon Smith runs the other
we work together though most of the time It makes quite a crew
twentyfive or thirty men

I didnt know said Thurston dubiously that you ever shipped cattle
into this country I supposed you shipped them out Is Mr Graves buying
some

Hank I guess yes six thousand head uh yearlings and two yearolds
this spring some seasons its more We get in young stock every year
and turn em loose on the range till theyre ready to ship Its cheaper
than raising calves yuh know When yuh get to Billings Bud youll see
some cattle Why our bunch alone will make seven trains and that aint
a commencement Cattles cheap down South this year and seems like
everybodys buying Hank didnt buy as much as some because he runs
quite a bunch uh cows well brand six or seven thousand calves this
spring Hank sure knows how to rake in the coin

Thurston agreed as politely as he could for the jolting They had
again struck the level and seven miles at Parks usual pace was
heartbreaking to a man not accustomed to the saddle Thurston had
written just before leaving home a musical bit of verse born of his
luring dreams about the joy of speeding fleetly where the grassland
meets the sky and he was gritting his teeth now over the idiotic
lines

When they reached the ranch and Monas mother came to the door and
invited them in he declined almost rudely for he had a feeling that
once out of the saddle he would have difficulty in getting into it
again Besides Mona was not at home according to her mother

So they did not tarry and Thurston reached the Lazy Eight alive but
with the glamour quite gone from his West If he had not been the son of
his father he would have taken the first train which pointed its
nose to the East and he would never again have essayed the writing
of Western stories or musical verse which sung the joys of galloping
blithely off to the skyline He had just been galloping off to a
skyline that was always just before and he had not been blithe nor did
the memory of it charm Of a truth the very thought of things Western
made him swear mild citybred oaths

He choked back his awe of the cook and asked him quite humbly what
was good to take the soreness from ones muscles afterward he had crept
painfully up the stairs clasping to his bosom a beer bottle filled with
pungent homemade liniment which the cook had gravely declared out uh
sight for saddlegalls

Hank Graves when he heard the story with artistic touches from the
cook slapped his thigh and laughed one of his soundless chuckles The
sonofagun Hes the right stuff Never whined eh I knew it Hes
his dad over again from the ground up And loved him the better



CHAPTER IV THE TRAILHERD

Thurston tucked the bulb of his camera down beside the bellows and
closed the box with a snap I wonder what old Reeve would say to that
view he mused aloud

Old who

Oh a fellow back in New York Jove hed throw up his drypoint heads
and take to oils and landscapes if he could see this

The this was a panoramic view of the town and surrounding valley of
Billings The day was sunlit and still and far objects stood up with
sharp outlines in the clear atmosphere Here and there the white tents
of waiting trailoutfits splotched the bright green of the prairie
Horsemen galloped to and from the town at top speed and a long grimy
red stock train had just snorted out on a siding by the stockyards where
the bellowing of thirsty cattle came faintly like the roar of pounding
surf in the distance

Thurstonquite a different Thurston from the trim pale young man who
had followed the lure of the West two weeks beforedrew a long breath
and looked out over the hurrying waters of the Yellowstone It was good
to be alive and young and to live the tented life of the plains it
was good even to be speeding fleetly where the grassland meets the sky
for two weeks in the saddle had changed considerably his viewpoint
He turned again to the dust and roar of the stockyards a mile or so
away

Perhaps he remarked hopefully the next train will be ours Strange
how soon a man may identify himself with new conditions and new aims He
had come West to look upon the life from the outside and now his chief
thought was of the coming steers which he referred to unblushingly as
our cattle Such is the spell of the range

Lets ride on over Bud Park proposed Thats likely the Circle Bar
shipment Their bunch comes from the same place ours does and I want to
see how they stack up

Thurston agreed and went to saddle up He had mastered the art of
saddling and could on lucky days and when he was in what he called
form rope the horse he wanted to say nothing of the times when his
loop settled unexpectedly over the wrong victim Park Holloway for
instance who once got it neatly under his chin much to his disgust and
the astonishment of Thurston

Im going to take my Kodak said he I like to watch them unload and
I can get some good pictures with this sunlight

When youve hollered em up and down the chutes as many times as I
have Park told him yuh wont need no pictures to help yuh remember
what its like

It was an old story with Park and Thurstons enthusiasm struck him as
a bit funny He perched upon a corner of the fence out of the way and
smoked cigarettes while he watched the cattle and shouted pleasantries
to the men who prodded and swore and gesticulated at the wildeyed
huddle in the pens Soon his turn would come but just now he was
content to look on and take his ease

For the life of me cried Thurston sidling gingerly over to him I
cant see where they all come from For two days these yards have never
been empty The country will soon be one vast herd

Two dayshuh this thingll go on for weeks mson And after all is
over youll wonder where the dickens they all went to Montana is some
bigger than you realize I guess And next fall when shipping starts
youll think youre seeing raw porterhouse steaks for the whole world
Lets drift out uh this dust youll have time to get a carload uh
pictures before our bunch rolls in

As a matter of fact it was two weeks before the Lazy Eight consignment
arrived Thurston haunted the stockyards with his Kodak but after the
first two or three days he took no pictures For every day was but a
repetition of those that had gone before a great grimy engine shunting
cars back and forth on the siding an endless stream of weary young
cattle flowing down the steep chutes into the pens from the pens to the
branding chutes where they were burned deep with the mark of their new
owners then out through the great gate crowding pushing wild to flee
from restraint yet held in and guided by mounted cowboys out upon the
green prairie where they could feast once more upon sweet grasses and
drink their fill from the river of clear mountain water out upon the
weary march of the trail on and on for long days until some boundary
which their drivers hailed with joy was passed and they were free at
last to roam at will over the windbrushed range land to lie down in
some cool sweetscented swale and chew their cuds in peace

Two weeks and then came a telegram for Park In the reading of it he
shuffled off his attitude of boyish irresponsibility and became in a
breath the cool businesslike leader of men Holding the envelope still
in his hand he sought out Thurston who was practicing with a rope As
Park approached him he whirled the noose and cast it neatly over the
peak of the nighthawks teepee

Good shot Park encouraged but Id advise yuh to take another
target Youll have the tent down over Scottys ears and then youll
think yuh stirred up a mess uh hornets

Say Bud our cattle are coming and Im going to be short uh men If
youd like a job Ill take yuh on and take chances on licking yuh into
shape Maybe the wages wont appeal to yuh but Im willing to throw in
heaps uh valuable experience that wont cost yuh a cent He lowered an
eyelid toward the cooktent although no one was visible

Thurston studied the matter while he coiled his rope and no longer
Secretly he had wanted all along to be a part of the life instead of an
onlooker Ill take the job Parkif you think I can hold it down
The speech would doubtless have astonished ReeveHoward in more ways
than one but ReeveHoward was already a part of the past in Thurstons
mind He was for living the present

Well Park retorted itll be your own funeral if yuh get fired
Better stake yourself to a pair uh chaps youll need em on the trip

Also a large rainbowhued silk handkerchief if I want to look the
part Thurston bantered

If yuh dont want your darned neck blistered yuh mean Park flung
over his shoulders Your wages and schooling start in tomorrow at
sunup

It was early in the morning when the first train arrived hungry
thirsty tired bawling a general protest against fate and mans mode
of travel Thurston with a long pole in his hand stood on the narrow
plank near the top of a chute wall and prodded vaguely at an endless
moving incline of backs Incidentally he took his cue from his
neighbors and shouted till his voice was a croakthough he could
not see that he accomplished anything either by his prodding or his
shouting

Below him surged the sea of hide and horns which was barely suggestive
of the animals as individuals Out in the corrals the dustcloud hung
low just as it had hovered every day for more than two weeks just as
it would hover every day for two weeks longer Across the yards near the
big outer gate Deacon Smiths crew was already beginning to brand The
first train was barely unloaded when the second trailed in and out
on the siding and so the third came also Then came a lull for the
consignment had been split in two and the second section was several
hours behind the first

Thurston rode out to camp aching with the strain and ravenously hungry
after toiling with his muscles for the first time in his life for his
had been days of physical ease He had yet to learn the art of working
so that every movement counted something accomplished as did the
others besides he had been in constant fear of losing his hold on the
fence and plunging headlong amongst the trampling hoofs below a fate
that he shuddered to contemplate He did not however mention that
fear or his muscle ache to any man he might be green but he was not
the man to whine

When he went back into the dust and roar Park ordered him curtly to
tend the branding fire since both crews would brand that afternoon and
get the corrals cleared for the next shipment Thurston thanked Park
mentally tending brandingfire sounded very much like childs play

Soon the gray dustcloud took on a shade of blue in places where the
smoke from the fires cut through a new tang smote the nostrils the
rank odor of burning hair and searing hides a new note crept into the
clamoring roar the lowkeyed blat of pain and fright

Thurston turned away his head from the sight and the smell and piled
on wood until Park stopped him with Say Bud we aint celebrating any
election It aint a bonfire we want its heat just keep her going and
save wood all yuh can After an hour of firetending Thurston decided
that there were things more wearisome than hollering em down the
chutes His eyes were smarting intolerably with smoke and heat and the
smell of the branding was not nice but through the long afternoon he
stuck to the work shrewdly guessing that the others were not having any
fun either Park and the Deacon worked as hard as any branding the
steers as they were squeezed one by one fast in the little branding
chutes The setting sun shone redly through the smoke before Thurston
was free to kick the halfburnt sticks apart and pour water upon them as
directed by Park

Think yuh earned your little old dollar and thirty three cents Bud
Park asked him And Thurston smiled a tired sooty smile that seemed all
teeth

I hope so at any rate I have a deep inner knowledge of the joys of
branding cattle

Wait till yuh burn Lazy Eights on wriggling blatting calves for two
or three hours at a stretch before yuh talk about the joys uh branding
Park rubbed eloquently his aching biceps

At dusk Thurston crept into his blankets feeling that he would like the
night to be at least thirty six hours long He was just settling into
a luxurious leatherupholstered dream chair preparatory to telling
ReeveHoward his Western experiences when Parks voice bellowed into the
tent

Roll out boyswe got a train pulling in

There was hurried dressing in the dark of the bedtent hasty mounting
and a hastier ride through the cool night air There were long hours at
the chutes prodding down at a wavering line of moving shadows while
the big dipper hung bright in the sky and lighted lanterns bobbed back
and forth along the train waving signals to one another At intervals
Parks voice cut crisply through the turmoil giving orders to men whom
he could not see

The east was lightening to a pale yellow when the men climbed at last
into their saddles and galloped out to camp for a hurried breakfast
Thurston had been comforting his aching body with the promise of rest
and sleep but three thousand cattle were milling impatiently in the
stockyards so presently he found himself fanning a sickly little blaze
with his hat while he endeavored to keep the smoke from his tired eyes
Of a truth ReeveHoward would have stared mightily at sight of him

Once Park passing by smiled down upon him grimly Heres where yuh
get the real thing in local color he taunted but Thurston was
too busy to answer The stress of living had dimmed his eye for the
picturesque

That night one Philip Thurston slept as sleeps the dead But he awoke
with the others and thanked the Lord there were no more cattle to unload
and brand

When he went out on dayherd that afternoon he fancied that he was
getting into the midst of things and taking his place with the veterans
He would have been filled with resentment had he suspected the truth
that Park carefully eased those first days of his novitiate That was
why none of the nightguarding fell to him until they had left Billings
many miles behind them



CHAPTER V THE STORM

The third night he was detailed to stand with Bob MacGregor on the
middle guard which lasts from eleven oclock until two The outfit had
camped near the head of a long shallow basin that had a creek running
through down the winding banks of it lay the whitetented camps of
seven other trailherds the cattle making great brown blotches against
the green at sundown Thurston hoped they would all be there in the
morning when the sun came up so that he could get a picture

Aw theyll be miles away by then Bob assured him unfeelingly By
the signs you can take snapshots by lightning in another hour Got
your slicker Bud

Thurston said he hadnt and Bob shook his head prophetically Youll
sure wish yuh had it before yuh hit camp again when yuh get wise
youll ride with your slicker behind the cantle rain or shine Theyll
need singing to tonight

Thurston prudently kept silent since he knew nothing whatever about it
and Bob gave him minute directions about riding his rounds and how to
turn a stray animal back into the herd without disturbing the others

The man they relieved met them silently and rode away to camp Off
to the right an animal coughed and a black shape moved out from the
shadows

Bob swung towards it and the shape melted again into the splotch of
shade which was the sleeping herd He motioned to the left Yuh can go
that way and yuh want to sing something or whistle so theyll know
what yuh are His tone was subdued as it had not been before He
seemed to drift away into the darkness and soon his voice rose away
across the herd singing As he drew nearer Thurston caught the words
at first disjointed and indistinct then plainer as they met It was a
song he had never heard before because its first popularity had swept
far below his social plane

 Shes oonly a bird in a gilded cage
 A beautiful sight to seeee
 You may think she seems haaaappy and free from caare

The singer passed on and away and only the high notes floated across to
Thurston who whistled softly under his breath while he listened Then
as they neared again on the second round the words came pensively

 Her beauty was sooold
 For an old mans gooold Shes a bird in a gilded caaage

Thurston rode slowly like one in a dream and the lure of the rangeland
was strong upon him The deep breathing of three thousand sleeping
cattle the strong animal odor the black night which grew each moment
blacker and the rhythmic ebb and flow of the clear untrained voice
of a cowboy singing to his charge If he could put it into words if
he could but picture the broody stillness with frogs crekk erekking
along the reedy creekbank and a coyote yapping weirdly upon a distant
hilltop From the southwest came mutterings halfdefiant and ominous
A breeze whispered something to the grasses as it crept away down the
valley

 I stood in a churchyard just at eeeve
 While the sunset adorned the west

It was Bob drawing close out of the night Youre doing fine Kid
keep her agoing he commended in an undertone as he passed and
Thurston moistened his unaccustomed lips and began industriously
whistling The Heart Bowed Down and from that jumped to Faust Fifteen
minutes exhausted his memory of the whistleable parts and he was not
given to tiresome repetitions He stopped for a moment and Bobs voice
chanted admonishingly from somewhere Keep her agooing Bud old
boy So Thurston took breath and began on The Holy City and came
near laughing at the incongruity of the song only he remembered that he
must not frighten the cattle and checked the impulse

Say Bob began when he came near enough do yuh know the words uh
that piece Its a peach I wisht youd sing it He rode on still
humming the woes of the lady who married for gold

Thurston obeyed while the highpiled thunderheads rumbled deep
accompaniment like the resonant lower tones of a bass viol

 Last night I lay asleeping there came a dream so fair
 I stood in old Jerusalem beside the temple there

A steer stepped restlessly out of the herd and Thurstons horse
trained to the work of his own accord turned him gently back

 I heard the children singing and ever as they sang
 Me thought the voice of angels from heaven in answer rang

From the west the thunder boomed drowning the words in its
deepthroated growl

 Jerusalem Jerusalem lift up your gates and sing

Hit her up a little faster Bud or well lose some Theyre getting on
their feet with that thunder

Sunfish in answer to Thurstons touch on the reins quickened to a
trot The joggling was not conducive to the best vocal expression but
the singer persevered

 Hosanna in the highest
 Hosanna to your King

Flash the lightning cut through the stormclouds and Bob who had
contented himself with a subdued whistling while he listened took up
the refrain

 Jerusalem Jerusalem

It was as if a battery of heavy field pieces boomed overhead The entire
herd was on its feet and stood closehuddled their tails to the coming
storm Now the horses were loping steadily in their endless circlinga
pace they could hold for hours if need be For one blinding instant
Thurston saw far down the valley then the black curtain dropped as
suddenly as it had lifted

Keep ahollering Bud came the command and after it Bobs voice
trilled high above the thundergrowl

 Hosanna in the highest
 Hosanna to your King

A strange thrill of excitement came to Thurston It was all new to him
for his life had been sheltered from the rages of nature He had never
before been out under the night sky when it was threatening as now He
flinched when came an earsplitting crash that once again lifted the
black curtain and showed him whitelighted the plain In the dark that
followed came a rhythmic thud of hoofs far up the creek and the rattle
of living castanets Sunfish threw up his head and listened muscles
aquiver

Theres a bunch arunning called Bob from across the frightened herd
If they hit us give Sunfish his head hes been there beforeand keep
on the outside

Thurston yelled All right but the pounding roar of the stampede
drowned his voice A whirlwind of frenzied steers bore down upon
himtwentyfive hundred Panhandle twoyearolds though he did not know
it then his mind was all a daze with one sentence zigzagging through
it like the lightning over his head Give Sunfish his head and keep on
the outside

That was what saved him for he had the sense to obey After a few
minutes of breathless racing with a roar as of breakers in his ears and
the crackle of clashing horns and the gleaming of rolling eyeballs close
upon his horses heels he found himself washed high and dry as it
were while the tumult swept by Presently he was galloping along behind
and wondering dully how he got there though perhaps Sunfish knew well
enough

In his story of the Westthe one that had failed to be convincinghe
had in his ignorance described a stampede and it had not been in the
least like this one He blushed at the memory and wondered if he should
ever again feel qualified to write of these things

Great drops of rain pounded him on the back as he rodechill drops
that went to the skin He thought of his new canarycolored slicker in
the bedtent and before he knew it swore just as any of the other
men would have done under similar provocation it was the first real
ablebodied oath he had ever uttered He was becoming assimilated with
the raw conditions of life

He heard a mans voice calling to him and distinguished the dim shape
of a rider close by He shouted that password of the range Hello

What outfit is this the man cried again

The Lazy Eight snapped Thurston sure that the other had come with
the stampede Then feeling the anger of temporary authority What in
hell are you up to letting your cattle run If Park could have heard
him say that for ReeveHoward

Down the long length of the valley they swept gathering to themselves
other herds and other riders as incensed as were themselves It is not
pretty work nor amusing to gallop madly in the wake of a stampede at
night keeping up the stragglers and taking the chance of a broken neck
with the rain to make matters worse

Bob MacGregor sought Thurston with much shouting and having found him
they rode side by side And always the thunder boomed overhead and by
the lightning flashes they glimpsed the turbulent sea of cattle fleeing
they knew not where or why with blind fear crowding their heels

The noise of it roused the camps as they thundered by men rose up
peered out from bedtents as the stampede swept past cursed the delay
it would probably make hoped none of the boys got hurt and thanked the
Lord the tents were pitched close to the creek and out of the track of
the maddened herds

Then they went back to bed to wait philosophically for daylight

When Sunfish between flashes stumbled into a shallow washout and sent
Thurston sailing unbeautifully over his head Bob pulled up and slid off
his horse in a hurry

Yuh hurt Bud he cried anxiously bending over him For Thurston
from the very frankness of his verdant ignorance had won for himself
the indulgent protectiveness of the whole outfit not a man but watched
unobtrusively over his welfareand Bob MacGregor went farther and
loved him wholeheartedly His voice when he spoke was unequivocally
frightened

Thurston sat up and wiped a handful of mud off his face if it had not
been so dark Bob would have shouted at the spectacle Im kinda sorter
shuck up like he quoted ruefully And my nose is skinned thank you
Wheres that devil of a horse

Bob stood over him and grinned My Im surprised at yuh Bud What
would your Sundayschool teacher say if she heard yuh Anyway yuh aint
got any call to cuss Sunfish he aint to blame Hes used to fellows
that can ride

Shut up Thurston commanded inelegantly Id like to see you ride a
horse when hes upside down

Aw come on urged Bob giving up the argument Well be plumb lost
from the herd if we dont hustle

They got into their saddles again and went on riding by sound and the
rare glimpses the lightning gave them as it flared through the storm
away to the east

Wet Bob sung out sympathetically from the streaming shelter of his
slicker Thurston wriggling away from his soaked clothing grunted a
sarcastic negative

The cattle were drifting now before the storm which had settled to a
monotonous downpour The riderstwo or three men for every herd that
had joined in the paniccircled a veritable picket line without the
password There would be no relief ride out to them that night and they
knew it and settled to the long wait for morning

Thurston took up his station next to Bob rode until he met the next
man and then retraced his steps till he faced Bob again rode until the
world seemed unreal and far away with nothing left but the night and
the riding back and forth on his beat and the rain that oozed through
his clothes and trickled uncomfortably down inside his collar He lost
all count of time and was startled when at last came gray dawn

As the light grew brighter his eyes widened and forgot their
sleephunger he had not thought it would be like this He was riding
part way across one end of a herd larger than his imagination had ever
pictured three thousand cattle had seemed to him a multitudeyet
here were more than twenty thousand wet draggled their backs humped
miserably from the rain which but a half hour since had ceased He was
still gazing and wondering when Park rode up to him

Lord Bud youre a sight Did the bunch walk over yuh he greeted

No only Sunfish snapped Thurston crossly Time was when Philip
Thurston would not have answered any man abruptly however great the
provocation He was only lately getting down to the real elemental man
of him to the son of Bill Thurston bullwhacker prospector
follower of dim trails He rode silently back to camp with Bob ate
his breakfast got into dry clothes and went out and tied his slicker
deliberately and securely behind the cantle of his saddle though the
sun was shining straight into his eyes and the sky fairly twinkled it
was so clean of clouds

Bob watched him with eyes that laughed My youre an ambitious
sonofagun he chuckled And youve got the slicker question settled
in your mind I see yuh learn easy it takes two or three soakings to
learn some folks

Weve got to go back and help with the herd havent we Thurston
asked The horses are all out

Yep Theyll stay out too till noon mson We hike to bed if
anybody should ask yuh

So it was not till after dinner that he rode back to the great
herdwith his Kodak in his pocketto find the cattle split up
into several bunches The riders at once went to work separating the
different brands He was too green a hand to do anything but help hold
the cut and that was so much like ordinary herding that his interest
flagged He wanted more than anything to ride into the bunch and
single out a Lazy Eight steer skillfully hazing him down the slope to
the cut as he saw the others do

Bob told him it was the biggest mixup he had ever seen and Bob had
ridden the range in every State where beef grows wild He was in the
thickest of the huddle was Bob working as if he did not know the
meaning of fatigue Thurston watching him thread his way in and out of
the restless milling herd only to reappear unexpectedly at the edge
with a steer just before the nose of his horse rush it out from among
the otherswheeling darting this way and that as it tried to dodge
back and always coming off victor wondered if he could ever learn to
do it

Being in pessimistic mood he told himself that he would probably always
remain a greenhorn to be borne with and coached and given boys work to
do all because he had been cheated of his legacy of the dim trails and
forced to grow up in a city hedged about all his life by artificial
conditions his conscience wedded to convention



CHAPTER VI THE BIG DIVIDE

The long drive was nearly over Even Thurstons eyes brightened when
he saw away upon the skyline the hills that squatted behind the home
ranch of the Lazy Eight The past month had been one of rapid living
under new conditions and at sight of them it seemed only a few days
since he had first glimpsed that broken line of hills and the bachelor
household in the coulee below

As the travelweary herd swung down the long hill into the valley of the
Milk River stepping out briskly as they sighted the cool water in the
near distance the past month dropped away from Thurston and what had
gone just before came back fresh as the happenings of the morning
There was the Stevens ranch a scant half mile away from where the tents
already gleamed on their last camp of the long trail the smoke from
the cooktent telling of savory meats and puddings the bare thought of
which made one hurry his horse

His eyes dwelt longest however upon the Stevens house half hidden
among the giant cottonwoods and he wondered if Mona would still smile
at him with that unpleasant uplift at the corner of her red mouth He
would take care that she did not get the chance to smile at him in any
fashion he told himself with decision

He wondered if those trainrobbers had been captured and if the one
Park wounded was still alive He shivered when he thought of the dead
man in the aisle and hoped he would never witness another death
involuntarily he glanced down at his right stirrup half expecting to
see his boot red with human blood It was not nice to remember that
scene and he gave his shoulders an impatient hitch and tried to think
of something else

Mindful of his vow he had bought a gun in Billings but he had not yet
learned to hit anything he aimed at for firearms are hushed in roundup
camps except when dire necessity breeds a law of its own Range cattle
do not take kindly to the popping of pistols So Thurstons revolver was
yet unstained with powder grime and was packed away inside his bed
He was promising his pride that he would go up on the hill back of the
Lazy Eight corrals and shoot until even Mona Stevens must respect his
marksmanship when Park galloped back to himThe world has moved some
while we was gone he announced in the tone of one who has news to tell
and enjoys thoroughly the telling Yuh mind the fellow I laid out in
the holdup He got all right again and they stuck him in jail along
with another one old Lauman the sheriff glommed a week ago Well they
didnt do a thing last night but knock a deputy in the head annex his
gun swipe a Winchester and a box uh shells out uh the office and hit
the high places Old Lauman is hot on their trail but he aint met
up with em yet that anybodys heard When he does therell sure be
something doing They say the deputys about all in they smashed his
skull with a big iron poker

I wish I could handle a gun Thurston said between his teeth Id
go after them myself I wish Id been left to grow up out here where I
belong Im all West but the trainingand I never knew it till a month
ago I ought to ride and rope and shoot with the best of you and I
cant do a thing All I know is books I can criticize an opera and a
new play and Im considered something of an authority on clothes but I
cant shoot

Aw go easy Park laughed at him What if yuh cant do the
doubleroll Riding and shooting and ropings all rightwe couldnt
very well get along without them accomplishments But thats all they
are just accomplishments We know a man when we see him and it dont
matter whether he can ride a bronk straight up or dont know which way
a saddle sets on a horse If hes a man he gets as square a deal as we
can give him Park reached for his cigarette book And as for hunting
outlaws he finished weve got old Lauman paid to do that And hes
dead onto his job you bet when he goes out after a man he comes pretty
near getting him mson But I sure do wish Id killed that jasper while
I was about it it would have saved Lauman a lot uh hard riding

Thurston could scarcely explain to Park that his desire to hunt
trainrobbers was born of a halfdefiant wish to vindicate to Mona
Stevens his courage and so he said nothing at all He wondered if Park
had heard her whisper that day and knew how he had failed to obey
her commands and if he had heard her call him a coward He had often
wondered that but Park had a way of keeping things to himself and
Thurston could never quite bring himself to open the subject boldly At
any rate if Park had heard he hoped that he understood how it was and
did not secretly despise him for it Women he told himself bitterly
are never quite just

After the four oclock supper he and Bob MacGregor went up the valley
to relieve the men on herd There was one nice thing about Park as a
foreman he tried to pair off his crew according to their congeniality
That was why Thurston usually stood guard with Bob whom he liked better
than any of the othersalways excepting Park himself

I brought my gun along Bob told him apologetically when they were
left to themselves Its a habit Ive got when I know theres bad men
rampaging around the country The boys kinda gave me the laugh when
they seen me haul it out uh my war bag but I just told em to go to
thunder

Do you think those

Naw Uh course not I just pack it on general principles same as an
old woman packs her umbrella

Say this is dead easy The bunch is pretty well broke aint it Im
sure glad to see old Milk River again this here trailing cattle gets
plumb monotonous He got down and settled his back comfortably against
a rock Below them spread the herd feeding quietly Yes sir this is
sure a snap he repeated after he had made himself a smoke Theys
only two ways a bunch could drift if they wanted to which they dontup
the river or down This hills a little too steep for em to tackle
unless they was crowded hard Good feed here too

Too bad yuh dont smoke Bud Theres nothing like a good smooth rock
to your back and a cigarette in your face on a nice lazy day like
this Its the only kind uh dayherding I got any use for

Ill take the rock to my back if youll just slide along and make
room Thurston laughed I dont hanker for a cigarette but I do wish
I had my Kodak

Aw tell with your Kodak Bob snorted Cant yuh carry this layout
in your head Ive got a picture gallery in mine that I wouldnt trade
for a farm I dont need no Kodak in mine thankye You just let this
here view soak into your system Bud where yuh cant lose it

Thurston did Long after he could close his eyes and see it in every
detail the long green slope with hundreds of cattle loitering in the
rank grassgrowth the winding sweep of the river and the green rolling
hills beyond and Bob leaning against the rock beside him smoking
luxuriously with halfclosed eyes while their horses dozed with
drooping heads a reinlength away

Say Bud Bobs voice drawled sleepily I wisht youd sing that
Jerusalem song I want to learn the words to it Im plumb stuck on that
piece Its different from the general run uh songs dont yuh think
Most of ems about your old home that yuh left in boyhoods happy days
and go back to find your girl dead and sleeping in a little churchyard
or else its your mother or your girl marries the other man and you get
it handed to yuh right alongand they make a fellow kinda sick to his
stomach when hes got to sing em two or three hours at a stretch on
nightguard just because hes plumb ignorant of anything better This
here Jerusalem one sounds kinda grand andthe cattle seems to like it
too for a change

The composer would feel flattered if he heard that Thurston laughed
He wanted to be left alone to daydream and watch the clouds trail
lazily across to meet the hills and there was an embryonic poem
forming phrase by phrase in his mind But he couldnt refuse Bob
anything so he sat a bit straighter and cleared his throat He sang
wellwell enough indeed to be sought after at informal affairs among
his set at home When he came to the refrain Bob took his cigarette from
between his lips and held it in his fingers while he joined his voice
lustily to Thurstons

 Jerusalem Jerusalem
 Lift up your gates and sing
 Hosanna in the highest
 Hosanna to your King

The near cattle lifted their heads to stare stupidly a moment then
moved a few steps slowly nosing for the sweetest grasstufts The
horses shifted their weight resting one leg with the hoof barely
touching the earth twitched their ears at the flies and slept again

 And then me thought my dream was changed
 The streets no longer rang
 Hushed were the glad Hosannas
 The little children sang

Tamale lifted his head and gazed inquiringly up the hill but Bob was
not observant of signs just then He was Striving with his recreant
memory for the words that came after

 The sun grew dark with mystery
 The morn was cold and still
 As the shadow of a cross arose
 Upon a lonely hill

Tamale stirred restlessly with head uplifted and ears pointed straight
before up the steep bluff Old Ironsides Thurstons mount was not the
sort to worry about anything but his feed and paid no attention Bob
turned and glanced the way Tamale was looking saw nothing and settled
down again on the small of his back

He sees a badger or something he Said Go on Bud with the chorus

 Jerusalem Jerusalem
 Lift up your gates and sing

Lift up your hands damn quick mimicked a voice just behind If yuh
aint got anything to do but lay in the shade of a rock and yawp well
borrow your cayuses You aint needin em by the looks

They squirmed around until they could stare into two black
gunbarrelsand then their hands went up their faces held a
particularly foolish expression that must have been amusing to the men
behind the guns

One of the gunbarrels lowered and a hand reached out and quietly took
possession of Tamales reins the owner of the hand got calmly into
Bobs saddle Bob gritted his teeth It was evident their movements had
been planned minutely in advance for once settled to his liking the
fellow tested the stirrups to make sure they were the right length and
raising his gun pointed it at the two in a businesslike manner that
left no doubt of his meaning Whereupon the man behind them came forward
and appropriated Old Ironsides to his own use

Too bad we had to interrupt Sundayschool he remarked ironically
You can go ahead with the meetin nowthe collection has been took
up He laughed without any real mirth in his voice and gathered up the
reins If yuh want our horses theyre up on the bench I dont
reckon theyll ever turn another cow but such as they are youre quite
welcome Better set still boys till we get out uh sight one of usll
keep an eye peeled for yuh So long and much obliged They turned and
rode warily down the slope

Now wouldnt that jar yuh asked Bob in deep disgust His hands
dropped to his sides in another second he was up and shooting savagely
Get behind the rock Bud he commanded

Just then a rifle cracked and Bob toppled drunkenly and went limply to
the grass

My God cried Thurston and didnt know that he spoke He snatched up
Bobs revolver and fired shot after shot at the galloping figures Not
one seemed to do any good the first shot hit a twoyearold square in
the ribs After that there were no cattle within rifle range

One of the outlaws stopped took deliberate aim with the stolen
Winchester and fired meaning to kill but he miscalculated the range a
bit and Thurston crumpled down with a bullet in his thigh The revolver
was empty now and fell smoking at his feet So he lay and cursed
impotently while he watched the marauders ride out of sight up the
valley

When the rank timbergrowth hid their flying figures he crawled over to
where Bob lay and tried to lift him

Art you hurt was the idiotic question he asked

Bob opened his eyes and waited a breath as if to steady his thought
Did I get one Bud

Im afraid not Thurston confessed and immediately after wished that
he had lied and said yes Are you hurt he repeated senselessly

Who me Bobs eyes wavered in their directness Dont yuh bother
none about me evasively

But youve got to tell me Youthey He choked over the words

WellI guess they got me all right But dont let that worry yuh it
dont me He tried to speak carelessly and convincingly but it was
a miserable failure He did not want to die did Bob however much he
might try to hide the fact

Thurston was not in the least imposed upon He turned away his head
pretending to look after the outlaws and set his teeth together tight
He did not want to act a fool All at once he grew dizzy and sick and
lay down heavily till the faintness passed

Bob tried to lift himself to his elbow failing that he put out a hand
and laid it on Thurstons shoulder Did theyget youtoo he queried
anxiously

The damn coyotes

Its nothing just a leg put out of business Thurston hurried to
assure him Where are you hurt Bob

Aw I aint any Xray Bob retorted weakly but gamely Somewheres
inside uh me It went in my side but the Lord knows where it wound
up It hurts like the devil He lay quiet a minute I wishdo yuh
feellike finishingthat song Bud

Thurston gulped down a lump that was making his throat ache When he
answered his voice was very gentle

Ill try a verse old man

The last onewed just come to the last Its most like church II
never wentmuch on religion Bud but when a fellowsgoing out over
the Big Divide

Youre not Thurston contradicted fiercely as if that could make it
different He thought he could not bear those jerky sentences

All rightBud We wont fight over it Go ahead The last verse

Thurston eased his leg to a better position drew himself up till his
shoulders rested against the rock and began with an occasional odd
break in his voice

 I saw the holy city
 Beside the tideless Sea
 The light of God was on its street
 The gates were open wide
 And all who would might enter
 And no one was denied

Wonder if that thereappliesto boneheadedcowpunchers Bob
muttered drowsily And allwho would Thurston glanced quickly at
his face caught his breath sharply at what he saw there written and
dropped his head upon his arms

And so Park and his men hurrying to the sound of the shooting found
them in the shadow of the rock



CHAPTER VII AT THE STEVENS PLACE

When the excitement of the outrage had been pushed aside by the
insistent routine of everyday living Thurston found himself thrust from
the fascination of range life and into the monotony of invalidism and
he was anything but resigned To be sure he was well cared for at the
Stevens ranch where Park and the boys had taken him that day and Mrs
Stevens mothered him as he could not remember being mothered before

Hank Graves rode over nearly every day to sit beside the bed and curse
the Wagner gang back to their greatgreatgrandfathers and down to more
than the third generation yet unborn and to tell him the news On the
second visit he started to give him the details of Bobs funeral but
Thurston would not listen and told him so plainly

All right then Bud I wont talk about it But we sure done the right
thing by the boy had the best preacher in Shellanne out and flowers
till further notice a cross uh carnations and the boys sent up to
Minot and had a spur made uhoh well all right Ill shut up about
it I know how yuh feel Bud it broke us all up to have him go that
way He sure was a white boy if ever there was one andahem

Id give a thousand dollars hard coin to get my hands on them
Wagners It would uh been all off with them sure if the boys had run
acrost em Id uh let em stay out and hunt a while longer only old
Laumanll get em all right and were late as it is with the calf
roundup Laumanll run em downand by the Lord Ill hire Bowman
myself and ship him out from Helena to help prosecute em Theyre dead
men if he takes the case against em Bud and Ill get him sureand
to hell with the cost of it Theyll swing for what they done to you and
Bob if it takes every hoof I own

Thurston told him he hoped they would be caught andyes hanged though
he had never before advocated capital punishment

But when he thought of Bob the carenaught wholesouled fellow

He tried not to think of him for thinking unmanned him He had the
softest of hearts where his friends were concerned and there were
times when he felt that he could with relish officiate at the Wagners
execution

He fought against remembrance of that day and for sake of diversion he
took to studying a large pastel portrait of Mona which hung against the
wall opposite his bed It was rather badly done and at first when he
saw it he laughed at the thought that even the great still plains of
the range land cannot protect one against the ubiquitous picture
agent In the parlor he supposed there would be crayon pictures of
grandmothers and auntsfurther evidence of the agents glibness

He was glad that it was Mona who smiled down at him instead of a
grandmother or an aunt For Mona did smile and in spite of the cheap
crudity the smile was roguish with little dimply creases at the corners
of the mouth and not at all unpleasant If the girl would only look
like that in real life he told himself a fellow would probably get to
liking her He supposed she thought him a greater coward than ever now
just because he hadnt got killed If he had he would be a hero now
like Bob Well Bob was a hero the way he had jumped up and begun
shooting required courage of the suicidal sort He had stood up and
shot also and had succeeded only in being ridiculous he hoped nobody
had told Mona about his hitting that steer When he could walk again he
would learn to shoot so that the range stock wouldnt suffer from his
marksmanship

After a week of seeing only Mrs Stevens or sympathetic men
acquaintances he began to wonder why Mona stayed so persistently away
Then one morning she came in to take his breakfast things out She did
not however stay a second longer than was absolutely necessary and
she was perfectly composed and said good morning in her most impersonal
tone At least Thurston hoped she had no tone more impersonal than that
He decided that she had really beautiful eyes and hair after she had
gone he looked up at the picture told himself that it did not begin
to do her justice and sighed a bit He was very dull and even her
companionship he thought would be pleasant if only she would come down
off her pedestal and be humanly sociable

When he wrote a story about a fellow being laid up in the same house
with a girla girl with big bluegray eyes and ripply brown hairhe
would have the girl treat the fellow at least decently She would read
poetry to him and bring him flowers and do ever so many nice things
that would make him hate to get well He decided that he would write
just that kind of story he would idealize it of course and have the
fellow in love with the girl you have to in stories In real life it
doesnt necessarily follow that because a fellow admires a girls hair
and eyes and wants to be on friendly terms he is in love with her
For example he emphatically was not in love with Mona Stevens He only
wanted her to be decently civil and to stop holding a foolish grudge
against him for not standing up and letting himself be shot full of
holes because she commanded it

In the afternoons Mrs Stevens would sit beside him and knit things
and talk to him in a pleasantly garrulous fashion and he would lie and
listen to herand to Mona singing somewhere Mona sang very well he
thought he wondered if she had ever had any training Also he wished
he dared ask her not to sing that song about Shes only a bird in a
gilded cage It brought back too vividly the nights when he and Bob
stood guard under the quiet stars

And then one day he hobbled out into the diningroom and ate dinner with
the family Since he sat opposite Mona she was obliged to look at
him occasionally whether she would or no Thurston had a strain of
obstinacy in his nature and when he decided that Mona should not only
look at him but should talk to him as well he set himself diligently
to attain that end He was not the man to sit down supinely and let a
girl calmly ignore him so Mona presently found herself talking to him
with some degree of cordiality and what is more to the point listening
to him when he talked It is probable that Thurston never had tried so
hard in his life to win a girls attention

It was while he was still hobbling with a cane and taxing his
imagination daily to invent excuses for remaining that Lauman the
sheriff rode up to the door with a deputy and asked shelter for
themselves and the two Wagners who glowered sullenly down from their
weary horses When they had been safely disposed in Thurstons bedroom
with one of the ranch hands detailed to guard them Lauman and his man
gave themselves up to the joy of a good meal Their own cooking they
said got mighty tame especially when they hadnt much to cook and dared
not have a fire

They had come upon the outlaws by mere accident and it is hard telling
which was the most surprised But Lauman was perhaps the quickest man
with a gun in Valley County else he would not have been serving his
fourth term as sheriff He got the drop and kept it while his deputy
did the rest It had been a hard chase he said and a long one if you
counted time instead of miles But he had them now harmless as rattlers
with their fangs fresh drawn He wanted to get them to Glasgow before
people got to hear of their capture he thought they wouldnt be any too
safe if the boys knew he had them

If he had known that the Lazy Eight roundup had just pulled in to the
home ranch that afternoon and that Dick Farney one of the Stevens
men had slipped out to the corral and saddled his swiftest horse it
is quite possible that Lauman would not have lingered so long over his
supper or drank his third cup of coffeewith real cream in itwith so
great a relish And if he had known that the Circle Bar boys were camped
just three miles away within hailing distance of the Lazy Eight trail
he would doubtless have postponed his aftersupper smoke

He was sitting revolver in hand watching the Wagners give a practical
demonstration of the extent of their appetites when Thurston limped in
from the porch his eyes darker than usual There are a lot of riders
coming Mr Lauman he announced quietly It sounds like a whole
roundup I thought you ought to know

The prisoners went white and put down knife and fork If they had never
feared before plainly they were afraid then

Laumans face did not in the least change Put the handcuffs on
Waller he said If youve got a room that aint easy to get at from
the outside Mrs Stevens I guess Ill have to ask yuh for the use of
it

Mrs Stevens had lived long in Valley County and had learned how to
meet emergencies Put em right down cellar she invited briskly
Theres just the trapdoor into it and the windows aint big enough
for a cat to go through Mona get a candle for Mr Lauman She turned
to hurry the girl and found Mona at her elbow with a light

Thats the kind uh woman I like to have around Lauman chuckled Come
on boys hustle down there if yuh want to see Glasgow again

Trembling all their daredevil courage sapped from them by the menace
of Thurstons words they stumbled down the steep stairs and the
darkness swallowed them Lauman beckoned to his deputy

You go with em Waller he ordered If anybody but me offers to lift
this trap shoot Dont yuh take any chances Blow out that candle soon
as youre located

It was then that fifty riders clattered into the yard and up to the
front door grouping in a way that left no exit unseen Thurston
standing in the doorway knew them almost to a man Lazy Eight boys
they were men who night after night had spread their blankets under the
tentroof with him and with Bob MacGregor Bob who lay silently out
on the hill back of the home ranchhouse waiting for the last great
roundup They glanced at him in mute greeting and dismounted without a
word With them mingled the Circle Bar boys as silent and grim as their
fellows Lauman came up and peered into the dusk Thurston observed that
he carried his Winchester unobtrusively in one hand

Why hello boys he greeted cheerfully But for the rifle you never
would have guessed he knew their errand

Hello Lauman answered Park matching him for cheerfulness Then

We rode over to hang them Wagners Lauman grinned I hate to
disappoint yuh Park but Ive kinda set my heart on doing that little
job myself Im the one that caught em and if youd followed my trail
the last month youd say I earned the privilege

Maybe so Park admitted pleasantly but weve got a little personal
matter to settle up with those jaspers Bob MacGregor was one of us yuh
remember

Ill hang em just as dead as you can Lauman argued

But yuh wont do it so quick Park lashed back Theyre spoiling the
air every breath they draw We want em and I guess that pretty near
settles it

Not by a damn sight it dont Ive never had a man took away from me
yet boys and Ive been your sheriff a good many years You hike right
back to camp yuh cant have em

Thurston could scarcely realize the deadliness of their purpose He knew
them for kindhearted laughterloving young fellows who would give
their last dollar to a friend He could not believe that they would
resort to violence now Besides this was not his idea of a mob he
had fancied they would howl threats and wave bludgeons as they did in
stories Mobs always howled and seethed with passion at ones doors
they did not stand about and talk quietly as though the subject was
trivial and did not greatly concern them

But the men were pressing closer and their very calmness had he known
it was ominous Lauman shifted his rifle ready for instant aim

Boys look here he began more gravely I cant say I blame yuh
looking at it from your viewpoint If youd caught these men when yuh
was out hunting em you could uh strung em upand Id likely uh had
business somewhere else about that time But yuh didnt catch em yuh
give up the chase and left em to me And yuh got to remember that Im
the one that brought em in Theyre in my care Im sworn to protect
em and turn em over to the lawand it aint a question uh whether
they deserve it or not Thats what Im paid for and I expect to go
right ahead according to orders and hang em by law You cant have
emunless yuh lay me out first and I dont reckon any of yuh would go
that far

Theres never been a man hung by law in this county yet a voice cried
angrily and impatiently

That aint saying there never will be Lauman flung back Dont yuh
worry theyll get all thats coming to them all right

How about the time yuh had em in your rotten old jail and let em get
out and run loose around the country killing off white men drawled
anothera CircleBar man

Now boys

A handthe hand of him who had stood guard over the Wagners in the
bedroom during supperreached out through the doorway and caught his
rifle arm Taken unawares from behind he whirled and then went down
under the weight of men used to wrassling calves Even old Lauman was
no match for them and presently he found himself stretched upon the
porch with three Lazy Eight boys sitting on his person which being
inclined to portliness he found very uncomfortable

Moved by an impulse he had no name for Thurston snatched the sheriffs
revolver from its scabbard As the heap squirmed pantingly upon the
porch he stepped into the doorway to avoid being tripped which was the
wisest move he could have made for it put him in the shadowand
there were men of the Circle Bar whose triggerfinger would not have
hesitated just then had he been in plain sight and had they known his
purpose

Just hold on there boys he called and they could see the glimmer of
the gunbarrel Those of the Lazy Eight laughed at him

Aw put it down Bud Park admonished Thats too dangerous a toy for
you to be playing withand yuh know damn well yuh cant hit anything

I killed a steer once Thurston reminded him meekly whereat the laugh
hushed for they remembered

I know I cant shoot straight he went on frankly but youre taking
that much the greater chance If I have to Ill cut looseand theres
no telling where the bullets may strike

Thats right Park admitted Stand still boys hes more dangerous
than a gun that isnt loaded What dyuh want mson

I want to talk to you for about five minutes Ive got a game leg so
that I can neither run nor fight but I hope youll listen to me The
Wagners cant get awaytheyre locked up with a deputy standing over
them with a gun and on top of that theyre handcuffed Theyre as
helpless boys as two trapped coyotes He looked down over the crowd
which shifted uneasily no one spoke

Thats what struck me most he continued You know what I thought of
Bob dont you And I didnt thank them for boring a hole in my leg it
wasnt any kindness of theirs that it didnt land higherthey werent
shooting at me for fun And Id have killed them both with a clear
conscience if I could I tried hard enough But it was different then
out in the open where a man had an even break I dont believe if I
had shot as straight as I wanted to that Id ever have felt a moments
compunction But now when theyre disarmed and shackled and altogether
helpless I couldnt walk up to them deliberately and kill them could
you

It could be done and done easily You have Lauman where he cant do
anything and Im not of much account in a fight so youve really only
one deputy sheriff and two women to get the best of You could drag
these men out and hang them in the cottonwoods and they couldnt raise
a hand to defend themselves We could do it easilybut when it was done
and the excitement had passed Id have a picture in my memory that Id
hate to look at Id have an hour in my life that would haunt me And
so would you Youd hate to look back and think that one time you helped
kill a couple of men who couldnt fight back

Let the law do it boys You dont want them to live and I dont
nobody does for they deserve to die But it isnt for us to play judge
and jury and hangman here tonight Let them get whats coming to them
at the hands of the officers youve elected for that purpose They wont
get off Hank Graves says they will hang if it takes every hoof he owns
He said he would bring Bowman down here to help prosecute them I dont
know Bowman

I do a voice spoke somewhere in the darkness Lawyer from Helena
Never lost a case

Im glad to hear it for hes the man that will prosecute They havent
a ghost of a show to get out of it Lauman here is responsible for their
safe keeping and I guess now that he knows them better we neednt be
afraid theyll escape again And its as Lauman said hell hang them
quite as dead as you can Hes drawing a salary to do these things make
him earn it Its a nasty job boys and you wouldnt get anything out
of it but a nasty memory

A hand that did not feel like the hand of a man rested for an instant on
his arm Mona brushed by him and stepped out where the rising moon shone
on her hair and into her big bluegray eyes

I wish you all would please go away she said You are making mamma
sick Shes got it in her head that you are going to do something awful
and I cant convince her youre not I told her you wouldnt do anything
so sneaking but shes awfully nervous about it Wont you please go
right now

They looked sheepishly at one another every man of them feared the
ridicule of his neighbor

Why sure well go cried Park rallying We were going anyway in a
minute Tell your mother we were just congratulating Lauman on rounding
up these Wagners Come on boys And you Bud hurry up and get well
again we miss yuh round the Lazy Eight

The three who were sitting on Lauman got up and he gave a sigh of
relief Say yuh darned cowpunchers dont have no mercy on an old mans
carcass at all he groaned in exaggerated selfpity Next time yuh
want to congratulate me I wish youd put it in writing and send it by
mail

A little ripple of laughter went through the crowd Then they swung up
on their horses and galloped away in the moonlight



CHAPTER VIII A QUESTION OF NERVE

That was your victory Miss Stevens Allow me to congratulate you If
Thurston showed any ill grace in his tone it was without intent But it
did seem unfortunate that just as he was waxing eloquent and felt sure
of himself and something of a hero Mona should push him aside as though
he were of no account and disperse a bunch of angry cowboys with half a
dozen words

She looked at him with her direct bluegray eyes and smiled And
her smile had no unpleasant uplift at the corners it was the dimply
roguish smile of the pastel portrait only several times nicer Re could
hardly believe it he just opened his eyes wide and stared When he came
to a sense of his rudeness Mona was back in the kitchen helping with
the supper dishes just as though nothing had happenedunless one
observed the deep applered of her cheekswhile her mother who showed
not the faintest symptoms of collapse flourished a dish towel made of
a bleached flour sack with the stamp showing a faint pink and blue XXXX
across the center

I knew all the time they wouldnt do anything when it came right
to the point she declared Bless their hearts they thought they
wouldbut theyre too softhearted even when they are mad If yuh go
at em right yuh can talk em over easy It done me good to hear yuh
talk right up to em Bud Mrs Stevens had called hi Bud from
the first time she laid eyes on him Thats all under the sun they
neededjust somebody to set em thinking about the other side Youre a
real good speaker seems to me you ought to study to be a preacher

Thurstons face turned red But presently he forgot everything in his
amazement for Mona the dignified Mona of the scornful eyes and the
chilly smile actually giggledgiggled like any ordinary girl and shot
him a glance that had in it pure mirth and roguish teasing and a dash
of coquetry He sat down and giggled with her feeling idiotically happy
and for no reason under the sun that he could name

He had promised his conscience that he would go home to the Lazy Eight
in the morning but he didnt he somehow contrived overnight to
invent a brand new excuse for his conscience to swallow or not as it
liked Hank Graves had the same privilege as for the Stevens trio he
blessed their hospitable souls for not wanting any excuse whatever for
his staying They were frankly glad to have him there at least Mrs
Stevens and Jack were As for Mona he was not so sure but he hoped she
didnt mind

This was the reason inspired by his great desire he was going to write
a story and Mona was unconsciously to furnish the material for his
heroine and so of course he needed to be there so that he might study
his subject That sounded very well to himself but to Hank Graves
for some reason it seemed very funny When Thurston told him Hank
was taken with a fit of strangling that turned his face a dark purple
Afterward he explained brokenly that something had got down his Sunday
throatand Thurston who had never heard of a mans Sunday throat
eyed him with suspicion Hank blinked at him with tears still in
his quizzical eyes and slapped him on the back after the way of the
Westand any other enlightened country where men are not too dignified
to be their real selvesand drawled in a way peculiar to himself

Thats all right Bud You stay right here as long as yuh want to I
dont blame yuhif I was you Id want to spend a lot uh time studying
this particular brand uh female girl myself Shes out uh sight
Budand I dont believe any uh the boys has got his loop on her so far
though I could name a dozen or so that would be tickled to death if they
had You just go right ahead and file your little old claim

Youre getting things mixed Thurston interrupted rather testily
Im not in love with her I well its like this if you were going to
paint a picture of those mountains off there youd want to be where you
could look at themwouldnt you You wouldnt necessarily want toto
own them just because you felt theyd make a fine picture Your
interest would be er entirely impersonal

Uhhuh Hank agreed his keen eyes searching Phils face amusedly

Therefore it doesnt follow that Im getting foolish about a girl just
because Ihang it what the Dickens makes you look at a fellow that
way You make me

Uhhuh said Hank again smoothing the lower half of his face with one
hand Youre a mighty nice little boy Bud Ill bet Mona thinks so
too and when yuh get growed up youll know a whole lot more than yuh do
right now Well I guess Ill be moving When yuh get thaterstory
done youll come back to the ranch I reckon Be good

Thurston watched him ride away and then flounced oh men do flounce at
times in spirit if not in deed and there would be no lack of the deed
if only they wore skirts that could rustle indignantly in sympathy with
the wearerto his room Plainly Hank did not swallow the excuse any
more readily than did his conscience

To prove the sincerity of his assertion to himself his conscience
and to Hank Graves he straightway got out a thick pad of paper and
sharpened three lead pencils to an exceeding fine point Then he sat him
down by the windowwhere he could see the kitchen door which was the
one most used by the familyand nibbled the tip off one of the pencils
like any schoolgirl For ten minutes he bluffed himself into believing
that he was trying to think of a title the plain truth is he was
wondering if Mona would go for a ride that afternoon and if so might he
venture to suggest going with her

He thought of the crimply waves in Monas hair and pondered what
adjectives would best describe it without seeming commonplace
Rippling was too old though it did seem to hit the case all right
He laid down the pad and nearly stood on his head trying to reach his
Dictionary of Synonyms and Antonyms without getting out of his chair
While he was clawing after itit lay on the floor where he had thrown
it that morning because it refused to divulge some information he
wantedhe heard some one open and close the kitchen door and came near
kinking his neck trying to get up in time to see who it was He failed
to see anyone and returned to the dictionary

Rippleto have waveslike running water That was just the way
her hair looked especially over the temples and at the nape of her
neckJove what a tempting white neck it was Umm Ripple wave
undulate uneven irregular Lord what fools are the men who write
dictionaries Antonymhang the antonyms

The kitchen door slammed He craned again It was Jackgoing to town
most likely Thurston shrewdly guessed that Mrs Stevens leaned far more
upon Mona than she did upon Jack although he could hardly accuse her
of leaning on anyone But he observed that the men looked to her for
orders

He perceived that the point was gone from his pencil and proceeded to
sharpen it Then he heard Mona singing in the kitchen and recollected
that Mrs Stevens had promised him warm doughnuts for supper Perhaps
Mona was frying them at that identical momentand he had never seen
anyone frying doughnuts He caught up his cane and limped out to
investigate That is how much his heart just then was set upon writing a
story that would breathe of the plains

One great hindrance to the progress of his story was the difficulty he
had in selecting a hero for his heroine Hank Graves suggested that he
use Park and even went so far as to supply Thurston with considerable
data which went to prove that Park would not be averse to figuring in
a love story with Mona But Thurston was not what one might call
enthusiastic and Hank laughed his deep inner laugh when he was well
away from the house

Thurston on the contrary glowered at the world for two hours after
Park was a fine fellow and Thurston liked him about as well as any man
he knew in the West butAnd thus it went On each and every visit to
the Stevens ranchand they were manyHank learning by direct inquiry
that the story still suffered for lack of a hero suggested some fellow
whom he had at one time and another caught shining around Mona And
with each suggestion Thurston would draw down his eyebrows till he came
near getting a permanent frown

A love story without a hero while it would no doubt be original and
all that would hardly appeal to an editor Phil tried heroes wholly
imaginary but he had a trick of making his characters seem very real
to himself and sometimes to other people as well So that after a few
passages of more or less ardent lovemaking he would in a sense grow
jealous and spoil the story by annihilating the hero thereof

Heaven only knows how long the thing would have gone on if he hadnt
one temptingly beautiful evening reverted to the day of the holdup and
apologized for not obeying her command He explained as well as he could
just why he sat petrified with his hands in the air

And then having brought the thing freshly to her mind he somehow lost
control of his wits and told her he loved her He told her a good deal
in the next two minutes that he might better have kept to himself just
then But a man generally makes a glorious fool of himself once or twice
in his life and it seems the more sensible the man the more thorough a
job he makes of it

Mona moved a little farther away from him and when she answered she
did not choose her words Of all things she said evenly I admire
a brave man and despise a coward You were chickenhearted that day and
you know it youve just admitted it Why in another minute Id have
had that gun myself and Id have shown youbut Park got it before
I really had a chance I hated to seem spectacular but it served you
right If youd had any nerve I wouldnt have had to sit there and tell
you what to do If ever I marry anybody Mr Thurston it will be a
man

Which means I suppose that Im not one he asked angrily

I dont know yet Mona smiled her unpleasant smilethe one that
did not belong in the story he was going to write Youre new to the
country you see Maybe youve got nerve you havent shown much so far
as I knowexcept when you talked to the boys that night But you must
have known that they wouldnt hurt you anyway A man must have a little
courage as much as I have which isnt asking muchor Id never marry
him in the world

Not even if youliked him his smile was wistful

Not even if I loved him Mona declared and fled into the house

Thurston gathered himself together and went down to the stable and
borrowed a horse of Jack who had just got back from town and rode home
to the Lazy Eight

When Hank heard that he was home to stayat least until he could join
the roundup againhe didnt say a word for full five minutes Then
Got your story done he drawled and his eyes twinkled

Thurston was going up the stairs to his old room and Hank could not
swear positively to the reply he got But he thought it sounded like
Oh damn the story



CHAPTER IX THE DRIFT OF THE HERDS

Weeks slipped by and to Thurston they seemed but days His
worldweariness and cynicism disappeared the first time he met Mona
after he had left there so unceremoniously for Mona not being aware of
his cynicism received him on the old friendly footing and seemed to
have quite forgotten that she had ever called him a coward or refused
to marry him So Thurston forgot it alsoso long as he was with her

How he filled in the hours he could scarcely have told certain it
is that he accomplished nothing at all so far as Western stories were
concerned ReeveHoward wrote in slightly shocked phrases to ask what
was keeping him so long and assured him that he was missing much by
staying away Thurston mentally agreed with him long enough to begin
packing his trunk it was idiotic to keep staying on when he was clearly
receiving no benefit thereby When however he picked up a book which
he had told Mona he would take over to her the next time he went he
stopped and considered

There was the Wagner trial coming off in a month or so he couldnt get
out of attending it for he had been subpoenaed as a witness for the
prosecution And there was the beef roundup going to start before
longhe really ought to stay and take that in there would be some fine
chances for pictures And really he didnt care so much for the Barry
Wilson bunch and the long list of festivities which trailed ever in
its wake at any rate they werent worth rushing twothirds across the
continent for

He sat down and wrote at length to ReeveHoward explaining very
carefullyand not altogether convincinglyjust why he could not
possibly go home at present After that he saddled and rode over to the
Stevens place with the book leaving his trunk yawning emptily in the
middle of his badly jumbled belongings

After that he spent three weeks on the beef roundup At first he was
full of enthusiasm and worked quite as if he had need of the wages but
after two or three big drives the novelty wore off quite suddenly and
nothing then remained but a lot of hard work For instance standing
guard on long rainy nights when the cattle walked and walked might at
first seem picturesque and all that but must at length cease to be
amusing

Likewise the long hours which he spent on dayherd when the wind
was raw and penetrating and like to blow him out of the saddle also
standing at the stockyard chutes and forcing an unwilling stream of
rollicky wildeyed steers up into the cars that would carry them to
Chicago

After three weeks of it he awoke one particularly nasty morning and
thanked the Lord he was not obliged to earn his bread at all to say
nothing of earning it in so distressful a fashion There was a lull
in the shipping because cars were not then available He promptly took
advantage of it and rode by the very shortest trail to the ranchand
Mona But Mona was visiting friends in Chinook and there was no telling
when she would return Thurston in the next few days owned to himself
that there was no good reason for his tarrying longer in the big
unpeopled West and that the proper thing for him to do was go back
home to New York

He had come to stay a month and he had stayed five He could ride and
rope like an oldtimer and he was well qualified to put up a stiff
gunfight had the necessity ever arisenwhich it had not

He had three hundred and seventyone pictures of different phases of
range life not counting as many that were overexposed or underexposed
or out of focus He had six unfinished stories in each of which the
heroine had big bluegray eyes and crimply hair and the title and bare
skeleton of a seventh in which the same sort of eyes and hair would
probably develop later He had proposed to Mona three times and had
been three times rebuffedthough not it must be owned with that tone
of finality which precludes hope

He was tanned a fine brown which became him well His eyes had lost the
dreamy introspective look of the student and author and had grown keen
with the habit of studying objects at long range He walked with that
peculiar stifflegged gait which betrays long hours spent in the
saddle and he wore a silk handkerchief around his neck habitually and
had forgotten the feel of a dresssuit

He answered to the name Bud more readily than to his own and he made
practical use of the slang and colloquialisms of the plains without any
mental quotation marks

By all these signs and tokens he had learned his West and should have
taken himself back to civilization when came the frost He had come to
get into touch with his chosen field of fiction that he might write
as one knowing whereof he spoke So far as he had gone he was in touch
with it he was steeped to the eyes in local colorand there was the
rub The lure of it was strong upon him and he might not loosen its
hold He was the son of his father he had found himself and knew that
like him he loved best to travel the dim trails

Gene Wasson came in and slammed the door emphatically shut after him
Shes sure coming he complained while he pulled the icicles from
his mustache and cast them into the fire Shes going to be a real old
howler by the signs What yuh doing Bud Writing poetry

Thurston nodded assent with certain mental reservations so far the
editors couldnt seem to make up their minds that it was poetry

Well say I wish youd slap in a lot uh things about hazy lazy daisy
days in the springthat jingles fineand green grass and the
sun shining and making the hills all goldy yellow and prairie dogs
chipchipchipping on the dobe flats Prairie dogs would go all right
in poetry wouldnt they Theyre sassy little cusses and I dont know
of anything that would rhyme with em but maybe you do And read it
all out to me after supper Maybe itll make me kinda forget theres a
blizzard on

Another one Thurston got up to scratch a trench in the halfinch
layer of frost on the cabin window Why it only cleared up this
morning after three days of it

Cant help that This is just another chapter uh that same story When
these here Klondike Chinooks gets to lapping over each other they never
know when to quit Every darn one has got to be continued tacked onto
the tail of it the winter All the difference is you cant read the
writing but I can

Ive got some mail for yuh Bud And old Hank wanted me to ask yuh if
youd like to go to Glasgow next Thursday and watch old Lauman start the
Wagner boys for wherevers hot enough He can get yuh in you being in
the writing business He says to tell yuh its a good chance to take
notes so yuh can write a real stylish story with lots uh murder and
sudden death in it We dont hang folks out here very often and yuh
might have to go back East after pointers if yuh pass this up

Oh go easy It turns me sick when I think about it how they looked
when they got their sentence and all that I certainly dont care to
see them hanged though they do deserve it Where are the letters
Thurston sprawled across the table for them One was from ReeveHoward
he put it by Another had a printed address in the corneran address
that started his pulse a beat or two faster for he had not yet reached
that blase stage where he could receive a personal letter from one of
the Eight Leading without the flicker of an eyelash He still gloated
over his successes and was cast into the deeps by his failures

He held the envelope to the light shook it tentatively like any woman
guessed hastily and hopefully at the contents and tore off an end
impatiently From the great fireplace Gene watched him curiously and
half enviously He wished he could get importantlooking letters from
New York every few days It must make a fellow feel that he amounted to
something

Gene you remember that story I read to you one nightthat yarn about
the fellow that lived alone in the hills and how the wolves used to
come and sit on the ridge and howl o nightsyou know the one you
said was out uh sight They took it all right andhere what do you
think of that He tossed the letter over to Gene who caught it just as
it was about to be swept into the flame with the draught in Thurston in
the days which he spent one of the halfdozen Lazy Eight linecamps with
Gene down by the river had been writing of the Westwriting in
fear and trembling for now he knew how great was his subject and his
ignorance of it In the long evenings while the fire crackled and the
flames played a game they had invented a game where they tried which
could leap highest up the great chimney while the north wind whooooed
around the eaves and fine frozen snow meal swished against the one
little window while shivering drifting range cattle tramped restlessly
through the sparse willowgrowth seeking comfort where was naught but
cold and snow and bitter driving wind while the gray wolves hunted in
packs and had not long to wait for their supper Thurston had written
better than he knew He had sent the cold of the blizzards and the howl
of the wolves he had sent bits of the windswept plains back to New
York in long white envelopes And the editors were beginning to watch
for his white envelopes and to seize them eagerly when they came greedy
for what was within Not every day can they look upon a few typewritten
pages and see the rangeland spread now frowning now smiling before
them

Gee they say here they want a lot the same brand and at any old price
yuh might name I wouldnt mind writing stories myself Gene kicked
a log back into the flame where it would do the most good His big
squareshouldered figure stood out sharply against the glow

Thurston watching him meditatively wanted to tell him that he was
the sort of whom good stories are made But for men like Genestrong
purposeful brave the West would lose half its charm He was like Bob
in many ways and for that Thurston liked him and stayed with him in
the linecamp when he might have been taking his ease at the home ranch

It was wild and lonely down there between the bare hills and the frozen
river but the wildness and the loneliness appealed to him It was
primitive and at times uncomfortable He slept in a bunk built against
the wall with hard boards under him and a sod roof over his head There
were times when the wind blew its fiercest and rattled dirt down into
his face unless he covered it with a blanket And every other day he
had to wash the dishes and cook and when it was Genes turn to cook
Thurston chopped great armloads of wood for the fireplace to eat o
nights Also he must fare forth wrapped to the eyes and help Gene
drive back the cattle which drifted into the river bottom lest they
cross the river on the ice and range where they should not

But in the evenings he could sit in the fireglow and listen to the wind
and to the coyotes and the gray wolves and weave stories that even the
most hypercritical of editors could not fail to find convincing By
day he could push the coffeebox that held his typewriter over by the
frosted windowwhen he had an hour or two to spareand whang away at
a rate which filled Gene with wonder Sometimes he rode over to the home
ranch for a day or two but Mona was away studying music so he found no
inducement to remain and drifted back to the little sodroofed cabin
by the river and to Gene

The winter settled down with bared teeth like a bulldog and never
a chinook came to temper the cold and give respite to man or beast
Blizzards that held them in fear of their lives close to shelter for
days came down from the north and with them came the drifting herds
By hundreds they came hurrying miserably before the storms When the
wind lashed them without mercy even in the bottomland they pushed
reluctantly out upon the snowcovered ice of the Missouri Then Gene and
Thurston watching from their cabin window would ride out and turn them
pitilessly back into the teeth of the storm

They came by hundredsthin gaunt from cold and hunger They came by
thousands lowing their misery as they wandered aimlessly seeking that
which none might find food and shelter and warmth for their chilled
bodies When the Canada herds pushed down upon them the boys gave over
trying to keep them north of the river while they turned one bunch a
dozen others were straggling out from shore the timid following
single file behind a leader more venturesome or more desperate than his
fellows

So the march went on and on big Southernbred steer grappling the
problem of his first Northern winter thinflanked cow with shivering
roughcoated calf trailing at her heels humpbacked yearling with little
nubs of horns telling that he was lately in his calfhood red cattle
spotted cattle white cattle black cattle whitefaced Herefords
Shorthorns scrubs Texas longhornsof the sort invariably pictured
in stampedesstill they came drifting out of the cold wilderness and on
into wilderness as cold

Through the shifting wall of the worst blizzard that season Thurston
watched the weary fruitless endless march of the range Where do they
all come from he exclaimed once when the snowveil lifted and showed
the river black with cattle

Lord I dunno Gene answered shrugging his shoulders against the
pity of it I seen some brands yesterday that I know belongs up in the
Cypress Hills country If things dont loosen up pretty soon the whole
darned range will be swept clean uh stock as far north as cattle run
Im looking for reindeer next

Something ought to be done Thurston declared uneasily turning away
from the sight Ive had the bellowing of starving cattle in my ears
day and night for nearly a month The things getting on my nerves

Its getting on the nerves uh them that own em a heap worse Gene
told him grimly and piled more wood on the fire for the cold bit
through even the thick walls of the cabin when the flames in the
fireplace died and the door hinges were crusted deep with ice Theres
going to be the biggest loss this range has ever known

Its the owners fault snapped Thurston whose nerves were in
that irritable state which calls loudly for a vent of some sort Even
argument with Gene fruitless though it perforce must be would be a
relief Its their own fault I dont pity them anywhy dont they
take care of their stock If I owned cattle do you think Id sit in the
house and watch them starve through the winter

What if yuh owned more than yuh could feed Itd be a case uh haveto
then Theres fifty thousand Lazy Eight cattle walking the range
somewhere today How the dickens is old Hank going to feed them fifty
thousand or five thousand It takes every spear uh hay hes got to feed
his calves

He could buy hay Thurston persisted

Buy hay for fifty thousand cattle Where would he get it Say Bud I
guess yuh dont realize thats some cattle All ails you is yuh dont
savvy the size uh the thing Ill bet yuh there wont be less than three
hundred thousand head cross this river before spring

Some of them belong in Canadayou said so yourself

I know it but look at all the country south of us all the other cow
States Why Bud when yuh talk about feeding every critter that runs
the range youre plumb foolish

Anyway its a damnable pity Thurston asserted petulantly

Sure it is The grass is there but its under fourteen inches uh snow
right now and more coming they say its twelve feet deep up in the
mountains Youll see some great old times in the spring Bud if yuh
stay You will wont yuh

Thurston laughed shortly I suppose its safe to say I will he
answered I ought to have gone last fall but I didnt It will
probably be the same thing over again I ought to go in the spring but
I wont

You bet you wont Talk about big roundups what yuh seen last spring
wasnt a commencement Every hoof that crosses this river and lives till
spring will have to be rounded up and brought back again Theyll be
scattered clean down to the Yellowstone and every Northern outfit has
got to go down and help work the range from there back I tell yuh Bud
yuh want to lay in a carload uh films and throw away all them little
jerkwater snapshots yuh got Theres going to be roundups like these
old Panhandle rannies tell about when the green grass comes Gene
thinking blissfully of the tented life sprawled his long legs toward
the snapping blaze and crooned dreamily while without the blizzard
raged more fiercely a verse from an old camp song

 Out on the roundup boys I tell yuh what yuh get
 Little chunk uh bread and a little chunk uh meat
 Little black coffee boys chuck full uh alkali
 Dust in your throat boys and gravel in your eye
 So polish up your saddles oil your slickers and your guns
 For were bound for Lonesome Prairie when the green grass comes



CHAPTER X THE CHINOOK

One night in late March a sullen faraway roar awakened Thurston in
his bunk He turned over and listened wondering what on earth was the
matter More than anything it sounded like a hurrying freight train only
the railroad lay many miles to the north and trains do not run at large
over the prairie Gene snored peacefully an arms length away Outside
the snow lay deep on the levels while in the hollows were great white
drifts that at bedtime had glittered frostily in the moonlight On the
hilltops the gray wolves howled across coulees to their neighbors and
slinking coyotes yapped foolishly at the moon

Thurston drew the blanket up over his ears for the fire had died to a
heap of whitening embers and the cold of the cabin made the nose of
him tingle The roar grew louder and nearerthen the cabin shivered and
creaked in the suddenness of the blast that struck it A clod of dirt
plumbed down upon his shoulder bringing with it a shower of finer
particles Another blizzard he groaned and the worst weve had yet
by the sound

The wind shrieked down the chimney and sought the places where the
chinking was loose It howled up the coulees putting the wolves
themselves to shame Gene flopped over like a newly landed fish grunted
some unintelligible words and slept again

For an hour Thurston lay and listened to the blast and selfishly thanked
heaven it was his turn at the cooking If the storm kept up like that
he told himself he was glad he did not have to chop the wood He
lifted the blanket and sniffed tentatively then cuddled back into cover
swearing that a thermometer would register zero at that very moment on
his pillow

The storm came in gusts as the worst blizzards do at times It made him
think of the nursery story about the fifth little pig who built a cabin
of rocks and how the wolf threatened Ill huff and Ill puff and
Ill blow your house down It was as if he himself were the fifth
little pig and as if the wind were the wolf The wolfwind would stop
for whole minutes gather his great lungs full of air and then without
warning would huff and puff his hardest But though the cabin was
not built of rocks it was nevertheless a staunch little shelter and
sturdily withstood the shocks

He pitied the poor cattle still fighting famine and frost as only
rangebred stock can fight He pictured them drifting miserably before
the fury of the wind or crowding for shelter under some friendly
cutback their tails to the storm waiting stolidly for the dawn that
would bring no relief Then with the roar and rattle in his ears he
fell asleep

In that particular linecamp on the Missouri the cooks duties began
with building a fire in the morning Thurston waked reluctantly
shivered in anticipation under the blankets gathered together his
fortitude and crept out of his bunk While he was dressing his teeth
chattered like castanets in a minstrel show He lighted the fire
hurriedly and stood backed close before it listening to the rage of the
wind He was growing very tired of the monotony of winter he could no
longer see any beauty in the highturreted snowclad hills nor the
bare red faces of the cliffs frowning down upon him

I dont suppose you could see to the river bank he mused and Gene
will certainly tear the third commandment to shreds before he gets the
waterhole open

He went over to the window meaning to scratch a peephole in the frost
just as he had done every day for the past three months lifted a hand
then stopped bewildered For instead of frost there was only steam with
ridges of ice yet clinging to the sash and dripping water in a tiny
rivulet He wiped the steam hastily away with his palm and looked out

Good heavens Gene he shouted in a voice to wake the Seven Sleepers
The worlds gone mad overnight Are you dead man Get up and look out
The whole damn country is running water and the hills are bare as this
floor

Uhhuh Gene knuckled his eyes and sat up Chinook struck us in the
night Didnt yuh hear it

Thurston pulled open the door and stood face to face with the miracle of
the West He had seen Mother Nature in many a changeful mood but never
like this The wind blew warm from the southwest and carried hints of
green things growing and the song of birds he breathed it gratefully
into his lungs and let it riot in his hair The sky was purplish and
soft with heavy drifting clouds highpiled like a summer storm It
looked like rain he thought

The bare hills were sodden with snowwater and the drifts in the
coulees were dirtgrimed and forbidding The great river lay a gray
stretch of watersoaked snow over the ice with little clear pools
reflecting the drab clouds above A crow flapped lazily across the
foreground and perched like a blot of freshspilled ink on the top of a
dead cottonwood and cawed raucous greeting to the spring

The wonder of it dazed Thurston and made him do unusual things that
morning All winter he had been puffed with pride over his cooking but
now he scorched the oatmeal let the coffee boil over and blackened the
bacon and committed divers other grievous sins against Genes clamoring
appetite Nor did he feel the shame that he should have felt He simply
could not stay in the cabin five minutes at a time and for it he had no
apology

After breakfast he left the dishes unwashed upon the table and went out
and made merry with nature He could scarce believe that yesterday he
had frosted his left ear while he brought a bucket of water up from the
river and that it had made his lungs ache to breathe the chill air Now
the path to the river was black and dry and steamed with warmth Across
the water cattle were feeding greedily upon the brown grasses that only
a few hours before had been locked away under a crust of frozen snow

They wont starve now he exulted pointing them out to Gene

No you bet not Gene answered If this dont freeze up on us the
wagons ll be starting in a month or so I guess we can be thinking
about hitting the trail for home pretty soon now The riverll break up
if this keeps going a week Say this is out uh sight Its warmer out
uh doors than it is in the house Darn the old shack anyway Im plumb
sick uh the sight of it It looked all right to me in a blizzard but
nowits me for the range mson He went off to the stable with long
swinging strides that matched all nature for gladness singing cheerily

 So polish up your saddles oil your slickers and your guns
 For were hound for Lonesome Prairie when the green grass comes



CHAPTER XI FOLLOWING THE DIM TRAILS

Thurston did not go on the horse roundup He explained to the boys
when they clamored against his staying that he had a host of things to
write and it would keep him busy till they were ready to start with
the wagons for the big rendezvous on the Yellowstone the exact point of
which had yet to be decided upon by the Stock Association when it met
The editors were after him he said and if he ever expected to get
anywhere in a literary sense it behooved him to keep on the smiley
side of the editors

That sounded all right as far as it went but unfortunately it did
not go far The boys winked at one another gravely behind his back and
jerked their thumbs knowingly toward Milk River by which pantomime they
reminded one anotherquite unnecessarily that Mona Stevens had come
home However they kept their skepticism from becoming obtrusive so
that Thurston believed his excuses passed on their face value The boys
it would seem realized that it is against human nature for a man to
declare openly to his fellows his intention of laying last desperate
siege to the heart of a girl who has already refused him three times
and to ask her for the fourth time if she will reconsider her former
decisions and marry him

That is really what kept Thurston at the Lazy Eight His writing became
once more a mere incident in his life During the winter when he did
not see her he could bring himself to think occasionally of other
things and it is a fact that the stories he wrote with no heroine at
all hit the mark the straightest

Now when he was once again under the spell of big clear blue gray
eyes and crimply brown hair his stories lost something of their
virility and verged upon the sentimental in tone And since he was not a
fool he realized the falling off and chafed against it and wondered why
it was Surely a man who is in love should be well qualified to write
convincingly of the obsession but Thurston did not He came near going
to the other extreme and refusing to write at all

The wagons were out two weekswhich is quite long enough for a crisis
to arise in the love affair of any man By the time the horse roundup
was over one Philip Thurston was in pessimistic mood and quite ready
to follow the wagons the farther the better Also they could not start
too soon to please him His thoughts still ran to bluegray eyes and
ripply hair but he made no attempt to put them into a story

He packed his trunk carefully with everything he would not need on
the roundup and his typewriter he put in the middle He told himself
bitterly that he had done with crimply haired girls and with every
other sort of girl If he could figure in something heroiconly he
said melodramatiche might possibly force her to think well of him
But heroic situations and opportunities come not every day to a man and
girls who demand that their knights shall be brave in face of death need
not complain if they are left knightless at the last

He wrote to ReeveHoward the night before they were to start and
apologized gracefully for having neglected him during the past three
weeks and told him he would certainly be home in another month He said
that he was in danger of being satiated with the Western tone and
would be glad to shake the hand of civilized man once more This was
distinctly unfair because he had no quarrel with the masculine portion
of the West If he had said civilized woman it would have been more just
and more illuminating to ReeveHoward who wondered what scrape Phil had
gotten himself into with those savages

For the first few days of the trip Thurston was in that frame of mind
which makes a man want to ride by himself with shoulders hunched
moodily and eyes staring straight before the nose of his horse

But the sky was soft and seemed to smile down at him and the clouds
loitered in the blue of it and drifted aimlessly with no thought of
reaching harbor on the skyline From under his horses feet the prairie
sod sent up sweet earthy odors into his nostrils and the tinkle of the
bells in the saddlebunch behind him made music in his earsthe sort of
music a true cowboy loves Yellowthroated meadow larks perched swaying
in the top of gray sage bushes and sang to him that the world was good
Sober gray curlews circled over his head their long funny bills thrust
out straight as if to point the way for their bodies to follow and
cried Korreck korreckwhich means just what the meadow larks
sang So Thurston hearing it all about him seeing it and smelling it
and feeling the riot of Spring in his blood straightened the hunch out
of his shoulders and admitted that it was all true that the world was
good

At Miles City he found himself in the midst of a small army the
regulars of the rangewhich grew hourly larger as the outfits rolled
in The rattle of messwagons driven by the camp cook and followed by
the bedwagon was heard from all directions Jingling cavvies herds of
saddle horses they were driven and watched over by the horse wrangler
came out of the wilderness in the wake of the wagons Thurston got out
his camera and took pictures of the scene In the first ten different
camps appeared he mourned because two others were perforced omitted
Two hours later he snapped the Kodak upon fifteen and there were four
beyond range of the lens

Park came along saw what he was doing and laughed Yuh better wait
till they commence to come he said When yuh can stand on this little
hill and count fifty or sixty outfits camped within two or three miles
uh here yuh might begin taking pictures

I think youre loading me Thurston retorted calmly winding up the
roll for another exposure

All rightsuit yourself about it Park walked off and left him
peering into the viewfinder

Still they came From Swift Current to the Cypress Hills the Canadian
cattlemen sent their wagons to join the big meet From the Sweet Grass
Hills to the mouth of Milk River not a stockgrower but was represented
From the upper Musselshell they came and from out the Judith Basin
from Shellanne east to Fort Buford Truly it was a gathering of the
clans such as eastern Montana had never before seen

For a day and a night the cowboys made merry in town while their foremen
consulted and the captains appointed by the Association mapped out the
different routes At times like these foremen such as Park and Deacon
Smith were shorn of their accustomed power and worked under orders as
strict as those they gave their men

Their future movements thoroughly understood the army moved down upon
the range in companies of five and six crews and the long summers work
began each rider a unit in the war against the chaos which the winter
had wrought in the fight of the stockmen to wrest back their fortunes
from the wilderness and to hold once more their sway over the
rangeland

Their method called for concerted action although it was simple enough
Two of the Lazy Eight wagons under Park and Gene Wasson for Hank that
spring was running four crews and had promoted Gene wagonboss of one
joined forces with the CircleBar the Flying U and a Yellowstone
outfit whose wagonboss knowing best the range was captain of the five
crews and drove north gathering and holding all stock which properly
ranged beyond the Missouri

That meant day after day of riding circlewhich is being
interpreted riding out ten or twelve miles from camp then turning and
driving everything before them to a point near the center of the circle
thus formed When they met the cattle were bunched and all stock which
belonged on that range was cut out leaving only those which had crossed
the river during the storms of winter These were driven on to the
next camping place and held which meant constant dayherding and
nightguarding work which cowboys hate more than anything else

There would be no calf roundup proper that spring for all calves were
branded as they were gathered Many there were among the shestock that
would not cross the river again their carcasses made unsightly blots in
the couleebottoms and on the windswept levels Of the calves that had
followed their mothers on the long trail hundreds had dropped out of
the march and been left behind for the wolves But not all Rangebred
cattle are blessed with rugged constitutions and can bear much of cold
and hunger The cow that can turn tail to a biting wind the while she
ploughs to the eyes in snow and roots out a very satisfactory living
for herself breeds calves that will in time do likewise and grow fat and
strong in the doing He is a sturdy selfreliant little rascal is the
rangebred calf

When fifteen hundred head of mixed stock bearing Northern brands were
in the hands of the dayherders Park and his crew were detailed to take
them on and turn them loose upon their own range north of Milk River
Thurston felt that he had gleaned about all the experience he needed
and more than enough hard riding and short sleeping and hurried eating
He announced that he was ready to bid goodby to the range He would
help take the herd home he told Park and then he intended to hit the
trail for little old New York

He still agreed with the meadow larks that the world was good but he
had made himself believe that he really thought the civilized portion
of it was better especially when the uncivilized part holds a girl who
persists in saying no when she should undoubtedly say yes and insists
that a man must be a hero else she will have none of him



CHAPTER XII HIGH WATER

It was nearing the middle of June and it was getting to be a very hot
June at that For two days the trailherd had toiled wearily over the
hills and across the coulees between the Missouri and Milk River Then
the sky threatened for a day and after that they plodded in the rain

Thank the Lord thats done with sighed Park when he saw the last
of the herd climb all dripping up the north bank of the Milk River
Tomorrow we can turn em loose And I tell yuh Bud we didnt get
across none too soon Yuh notice how the rivers coming up A day later
and wed have had to hold the herd on the other side no telling how
long

It is higher than usual I noticed that Thurston agreed absently He
was thinking more of Mona just then than of the river He wondered if
she would be at home He could easily ride down there and find out
It wasnt far not a quarter of a mile but he assured himself that he
wasnt going and that he was not quite a fool he hoped Even if she
were at home what good could that possibly do him Just give him
several bad nights when he would lie in his corner of the tent and
listen to the boys snoring with a different key for every man Such
nights were not pleasant nor were the thoughts that caused them

From where they were camped upon a ridge which bounded a broad coulee
on the east he could look down upon the Stevens ranch nestling in the
bottomland the house half hidden among the cottonwoods Through the
last hours of the afternoon he watched it hungrily The big corral ran
down to the waters edge and he noted idly that three panels of the
fence extended out into the river and that the muddy water was creeping
steadily up until at sundown the posts of the first panel barely showed
above the water

Park came up to him and looked down upon the little valley I never
did see any sense in Jack Stevens building where he did he remarked
There aint a June flood that dont put his corral under water and
some uh these days its going to get the house He was too lazy to dig
a well back on high ground hed rather take chances on having the whole
business washed off the face uh the earth

There must be danger of it this year if ever Thurston observed
uneasily The river is coming up pretty fast it seems to me It must
have raised three feet since we crossed this afternoon

Ill course theres danger with all that snow coming out uh the
mountains And like as not Jacks in Shellanne roosting on somebodys
pool table and telling it scary instead uh staying at home looking
after his stuff Where yuh going Bud

Im going to ride down there Thurston answered constrainedly The
women may be all alone

Well Ill go along if youll hold on a minute Jack aint got a lick
uh sense I dont care if he is Monas brother

Half brother corrected Thurston as he swung up into the saddle He
had a poor opinion of Jack and resented even that slight relation to
Mona

The road was soggy with the rain which fell steadily down in the
bottom the low places in the road were already under water and the
river widening almost perceptibly in its headlong rush down the narrow
valley crept inch by inch up its low banks When they galloped into the
yard which sloped from the house gently down to the river fifty yards
away Monas face appeared for a moment in the window Evidently she had
been watching for some one and Thurstons heart flopped in his chest
as he wondered fleetingly if it could be himself When she opened the
door her eyes greeted him with a certain wistful expression that he had
never seen in them before He was guilty of wishing that Park had stayed
in camp

Oh Im glad you rode over she welcomedbut she was careful after
that first swift glance to look at Park Jack wasnt at camp was he
He went to town this morning and I looked for hi back long before now
But its a mistake ever to look for Jack until hes actually in sight

Park smiled vaguely He was afraid it would not be polite to agree with
her as emphatically as he would like to have done But Thurston had no
smile ready polite or otherwise Instead he drew down his brows in a
way not complimentary to Jack

Where is your mother he asked almost peremptorily

Mamma went to Great Falls last week she told him primly just
grazing him with one of her impersonal glances which nearly drove him to
desperation Aunt Mary has typhoid feverthere seems to be so much of
that this spring and they sent for mamma Shes such a splendid nurse
you know

Thurston did know but he passed over the subject And youre alone
he demanded

Certainly not arent you two here Mona could be very pert when she
tried Jack and I are holding down the ranch just now the boys are all
on roundup of course Jack went to town today to see some one

Ummyes of course It was Park still trying to be polite and not
commit himself on the subject of Jack The some one whom Jack went
oftenest to see was the bartender in the Palace saloon but it was not
necessary to tell her that

The rivers coming up pretty fast Mona he ventured Dont yuh think
yuh ought to pull out and go visiting

No I dont Monas tone was very decided I wouldnt drop down on a
neighbor without warning just because the river happens to be coming up
It has come up every June since weve been living here and there have
been several of them At the worst it never came inside the gate

You can never tell what it might do Park argued Yuh know yourself
theres never been so much snow in the mountains This hot weather weve
been having lately and then the rain will bring it awhooping Cant
yuh ride over to the Jonses One of usll go with yuh

No I cant Monas chin went up perversely Im no coward I hope
even if there was any danger which there isnt

Thurstons chin went up also and he sat a bit straighter Whether she
meant it or not he took her words as a covert stab at himself Probably
she did not mean it at any rate the blood flew consciously to her
cheeks after she had spoken and she caught her under lip sharply
between her teeth And that did not help matters or make her temper more
yielding

Anyway she added hurriedly Jack will be here hes likely to come
any minute now

Uh course if Jacks got some new kind of halfhitch he can put on
the river and hold it back yuhll be all right fleered Park with the
freedom of an old friend He had known Mona when she wore dresses to her
shoetops and her hair in long brown curls down her back

She wrinkled her nose at him also with the freedom of an old friend and
Thurston stirred restlessly in his chair He did not like even Park to
be too familiar with Mona though he knew there was a girl in Shellanne
whose name Park sometimes spoke in his sleep

She lifted the big glass lamp down from its place on the clock shelf
and lighted it with fingers not quite steady You men she remarked
think women ought to be wrapped in pink cotton and put in a glass
cabinet If by any miracle the river should come up around the house
I flatter myself I should be able to cope with the situation Id just
saddle my horse and ride out to high ground

Would yuh Park grinned skeptically The road from here to the hill
is half under water right now the rivers got over the bank above and
is flooding down through the horse pasture By the time the water got up
here the riverd be as wide and deep one side uh yuh as the other Then
whered yuh be at

It wont get up here though Mona asserted coolly It never has

No and the Lazy Eight never had to work the Yellowstone range on
spring roundup before either Park told her meaningly

Whereupon Mona got upon her pedestal and smiled her unpleasant smile
against which even Park had no argument ready

They lingered till long after all good cowpunchers are supposed to be
in their bedsunless they are standing nightguardbut Jack failed to
appear The rain drummed upon the roof and the river swished and gurgled
against the crumbling banks and grumbled audibly to itself because the
hills stood immovably in their places and set bounds which it could not
pass however much it might rage against their base

When the clock struck a wheezy nine Mona glanced at it significantly
and smothered a yawn more than half affected It was a hint which no man
with an atom of selfrespect could overlook With mutual understanding
the two rose

I guess well have to be going Park said with some ceremony I kept
think ing maybe Jack would show up it aint right to leave yuh here
alone like this

I dont see why not Im not the least bit afraid Mona said Her tone
was impersonal and had in it a note of dismissal

So there being nothing else that they could do they said goodnight
and took themselves off

This is sure fierce Park grumbled when they struck the lower ground
Darn a man like Jack Stevens Hell hang out there in town and bowl up
on other mens money till plumb daylight Its a wonder Mona didnt go
with her mother But noitd be awful if Jack had to cook his own grub
for a week Say the water has come up a lot dont yuh think Bud
If it raises much more Monall sure have a chance to cope with the
situation Itd just about serve her right too

Thurston did not think so but he was in too dispirited a mood to argue
the point It had not been good for his peace of mind to sit and
watch the color come and go in Monas cheeks and the laughter spring
unheralded into her dear big eyes and the light tangle itself in the
waves of her hair

He guided his horse carefully through the deep places and noted
uneasily how much deeper it was than when they had crossed before He
cursed the conventions which forbade his staying and watching over the
girl back there in the house which already stood upon an island cut off
from the safe high land by a strip of backwater that was widening and
deepening every minute and when it rose high enough to flow into the
river below would have a current that would make a nasty crossing

On the first rise he stopped and looked back at the light which shone
out from among the dripping cottonwoods Even then he was tempted to go
back and brave her anger that he might feel assured of her safety

Oh come on Park cried impatiently We cant do any good sitting
out here in the rain I dont suppose the water will get clear up to
the house itll likely do things to the sheds and corrals though and
serve Jack right Come on Bud Mona wont have us around so the sooner
we get under cover the better for us Shes got lots uh nerve I guess
shell make out all right

There was common sense in the argument and Thurston recognized it and
rode on to camp But instead of unsaddling as he would naturally have
done he tied Sunfish to the bedwagon and threw his slicker over his
back to protect him from the rain And though Park said nothing he
followed Thurstons example



CHAPTER XIII Ill STAYALWAYS

For a long time Thurston lay with wideopen eyes staring up at nothing
listening to the rain and thinking By and by the rain ceased and he
could tell by the dim whiteness of the tent roof that the clouds must
have been swept away from before the moon then just past the full

He got up carefully so as not to disturb the others and crept over two
or three sleeping forms on his way to the opening untied the flap and
went out The whole hilltop and the valley below were bathed in mellow
radiance He studied critically the wide sweep of the river He might
almost have thought it the Missouri itself it stretched so far
from bank to bank indeed it seemed to know no banks but the hills
themselves He turned toward where the light had shone among the
cottonwoods below there was nothing but a great blot of shade that told
him nothing

A step sounded just behind A hand the hand of Park rested upon his
shoulder Looks kinda dubious dont it kid Was yuh thinking about
riding down there

Yes Thurston answered simply Are you coming

Sure Park assented

They got upon their horses and headed down the trail to the Stevens
place Thurston would have put Sunfish to a run but Park checked him

Go easy he admonished If theres swimming to be done and its a
cinch there will be hes going to need all the wind hes got

Down the hill they stopped at the edge of a raging torrent and strained
their eyes to see what lay on the other side While they looked a
light twinkled out from among the treetops Thurston caught his breath
sharply

Shes upstairs he said and his voice sounded strained and unnatural
Its just a loft where they store stuff He started to ride into the
flood

Come on back here yuh chump Park roared Get off and loosen the
cinch before yuh go in there or yuh wont get far Sunfishll need
room to breathe once he gets to bucking that current Hes a good water
horse just give him his head and dont get rattled and interfere with
him And weve got to go up a ways before we start in

He led the way upstream skirting under the bluff and Thurston chafing
against the delay followed obediently Trees were racing down their
cleanwashed roots reaching up in a tangle from the water their
branches waving like imploring arms A black tarpapered shack went
scudding past lodged upon a ridge where the water was shallower and
sat there swaying drunkenly Upon it a great yellow cat clung and yowled
his fear

Thats old Dutch Henrys house Park shouted above the roar Ill bet
hes cussing things blue on some pinnacle up there He laughed at the
picture his imagination conjured and rode out into the swirl

Thurston kept close behind mindful of Parks command to give Sunfish
his head Sunfish had carried him safely out of the stampede and he had
no fear of him now

His chief thought was a wish that he might do this thing quite alone
He was jealous of Parks leading and thought bitterly that Mona would
thank Park alone and pass him by with scant praise and he did so want
to vindicate himself The next minute he was cursing his damnable
selfishness A tree had swept down just before him caught Park and his
horse in its branches and hurried on as if ashamed of what it had done
Thurston in that instant came near jerking Sunfish around to follow
but he checked the impulse as it was formed and left the reins alone
which was wise He could not have helped Park and he could very easily
have drowned himself Though it was not thought of himself but of Mona
that stayed his hand

They landed at the gate Sunfish scrambled with his feet for secure
footing found it and waded up to the front door The water was a foot
deep on the porch Thurston beat an imperative tattoo upon the door
with the butt of his quirt and shouted And Monas voice shorn of its
customary assurance answered faintly from the loft

He shouted again giving directions in a tone of authority which must
have sounded strange to her but which she did not seem to resent and
obeyed without protest She had to wade from the stairs to the door and
when Thurston stooped and lifted her up in front of him she looked as
if she were very glad to have him there

You didnt cope with the situation after all he remarked while she
was settling herself firmly in the saddle

I went to sleep and didnt notice the water till it was coming in at
the door she explained And then She stopped abruptly

Then what he demanded maliciously Were you afraid

A little she confessed reluctantly

Thurston gloated over it in silenceuntil he remembered Park After
that he could think of little else As before now Sunfish battled as
seemed to him best for Thurston astride behind the saddle held Mona
somewhat tighter than he need to have done and let the horse go

So long as Sunfish had footing he braced himself against the mad rush of
waters and forged ahead But out where the current ran swimming deep
he floundered desperately under his double burden While his strength
lasted he kept his head above water struggling gamely against the flood
that lapped over his back and bubbled in his nostrils Thurston felt his
laboring and clutched Mona still tighter Of a sudden the horses head
went under the black water came up around Thurstons throat with a
hungry swish and Sunfish went out from under him like an eel

There was a confused roaring in his ears a horrid sense of suffocation
for a moment But he had learned to swim when he was a boy at school
and he freed one hand from its grip on Mona and set to paddling with
much vigor and considerably less skill And though the undercurrent
clutched him and the weight of Mona taxed his strength he managed to
keep them both afloat and to make a little headway until the deepest
part lay behind them

How thankful he was when his feet touched bottom no one but himself
ever knew His ears hummed from the water in them and the roar of
the river was to him as the roar of the sea his eyes smarted from the
clammy touch of the dingy froth that went hurrying by in monster flakes
his lungs ached and his heart pounded heavily against his ribs when he
stopped gasping beyond reach of the waterdevils that lapped viciously
behind

He stood a minute with his arm still around her and coughed his voice
clear Park went down he began hardly knowing what it was he was
saying Park He stopped then shouted the name aloud Park Ohh
Park

And from somewhere down the river came a faint reassuring whoop

Thank the Lord gasped Thurston and leaned against her for a second
Then he straightened Are you all right he asked and drew her toward
a rock near at handfor in truth the knees of him were shaking They
sat down and he looked more closely at her face and discovered that
it was wet with something more than river water Mona the selfassured
Mona the stronghearted was crying And instinctively he knew that not
the chill alone made her shiver He was keeping his arm around her waist
deliberately and it pleased him that she let it stay After a minute
she did something which surprised him mightilyand pleased him more
she dropped her face down against the soaked lapels of his coat and
left it there He laid a hand tenderly against her cheek and wondered if
he dared feel so happy

Little girloh little girl he said softly and stopped For the
crowding emotions in his heart and brain the English language has no
words

Mona lifted her face and looked into his eyes Her own were soft and
shining in the moonlight and she was smiling a littlethe roguish
little smile of the imitation pastel portrait Youyoull unpack your
typewriter wont you please andand stay

Thurston crushed her close Stay The rangeland will never get rid
of me now he cried jubilantly Hank wanted to take me into the Lazy
Eight so now Ill buy an interest and stayalways

You dear Mona snuggled close and learned how it feels to be kissed
if she had never known before

Sunfish having scrambled ashore a few yards farther down came up to
them and stood waiting as if to be forgiven for his failure to carry
them safe to land but Thurston after the first inattentive glance
ungratefully took no heed of him

There was a sound of scrambling footsteps and Park came dripping up to
them Well say he greeted Aint yuh got anything to do but set here
and erlook at the moon Break away and come up to camp Ill rout out
the cook and make him boil us some coffee

Thurston turned joyfully toward him Park old fellow I was afraid

Yuh better reform and quit being afraid Park bantered I got out uh
the mixup fine but I guess my horse went on downpoor devil I was
poking around below there looking for him

Well Mona I see yuh was able to cope with the situation all
rightbut yuh needed Bud mighty bad I reckon The chances is yuh wont
have no house in the morning so Budll have to get busy and rustle one
for yuh I guess youll own up now that the water can get through the
gate He laughed in his teasing way

Mona stood up and her shining eyes were turned to Thurston I dont
care she asserted with reddened cheeks Im just glad it did get
through

Same here said Thurston with much emphasis

Then with Mona once more in the saddle and with Thurston leading
Sunfish by the bridlerein they trailed damply and happily up the long
ridge to where the white tents of the roundup gleamed sharply against
the skyline
