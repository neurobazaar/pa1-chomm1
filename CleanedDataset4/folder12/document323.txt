BARRACKROOM BALLADS AND OTHER VERSES

 18891891

TO WOLCOTT BALESTIER


 Beyond the path of the outmost sun through utter darkness hurled 
 Further than ever comet flared or vagrant stardust swirled 
 Live such as fought and sailed and ruled and loved and made our world

 They are purged of pride because they died they know the worth of their bays
 They sit at wine with the Maidens Nine and the Gods of the Elder Days
 It is their will to serve or be still as fitteth our Fathers praise

 Tis theirs to sweep through the ringing deep where Azraels outposts are
 Or buffet a path through the Pits red wrath when God goes out to war
 Or hang with the reckless Seraphim on the rein of a redmaned star

 They take their mirth in the joy of the Earth 
 they dare not grieve for her pain 
 They know of toil and the end of toil they know Gods law is plain
 So they whistle the Devil to make them sport who know that Sin is vain

 And ofttimes cometh our wise Lord God master of every trade
 And tells them tales of His daily toil of Edens newly made
 And they rise to their feet as He passes by gentlemen unafraid

 To these who are cleansed of base Desire Sorrow and Lust and Shame 
 Gods for they knew the hearts of men men for they stooped to Fame
 Borne on the breath that men call Death my brothers spirit came

 He scarce had need to doff his pride or slough the dross of Earth 
 Een as he trod that day to God so walked he from his birth
 In simpleness and gentleness and honour and clean mirth

 So cup to lip in fellowship they gave him welcome high
 And made him place at the banquet board  the Strong Men ranged thereby
 Who had done his work and held his peace and had no fear to die

 Beyond the loom of the last lone star through open darkness hurled
 Further than rebel comet dared or hiving starswarm swirled
 Sits he with those that praise our God for that they served His world




BARRACKROOM BALLADS


 To T A


 I have made for you a song
 And it may be right or wrong
 But only you can tell me if its true
 I have tried for to explain
 Both your pleasure and your pain
 And Thomas heres my best respects to you

 O therell surely come a day
 When theyll give you all your pay
 And treat you as a Christian ought to do
 So until that day comes round
 Heaven keep you safe and sound
 And Thomas heres my best respects to you

DANNY DEEVER


 What are the bugles blowin for said FilesonParade
 To turn you out to turn you out the ColourSergeant said
 What makes you look so white so white said FilesonParade
 Im dreadin what Ive got to watch the ColourSergeant said
 For theyre hangin Danny Deever you can hear the Dead March play
 The regiments in ollow square  theyre hangin him today
 Theyve taken of his buttons off an cut his stripes away
 An theyre hangin Danny Deever in the mornin

 What makes the rearrank breathe so ard said FilesonParade
 Its bitter cold its bitter cold the ColourSergeant said
 What makes that frontrank man fall down said FilesonParade
 A touch o sun a touch o sun the ColourSergeant said
 They are hangin Danny Deever they are marchin of im round
 They ave alted Danny Deever by is coffin on the ground
 An ell swing in arf a minute for a sneakin shootin hound 
 O theyre hangin Danny Deever in the mornin

 Is cot was rightand cot to mine said FilesonParade
 Es sleepin out an far tonight the ColourSergeant said
 Ive drunk is beer a score o times said FilesonParade
 Es drinkin bitter beer alone the ColourSergeant said
 They are hangin Danny Deever you must mark im to is place
 For e shot a comrade sleepin  you must look im in the face
 Nine undred of is county an the regiments disgrace
 While theyre hangin Danny Deever in the mornin

 Whats that so black agin the sun said FilesonParade
 Its Danny fightin ard for life the ColourSergeant said
 Whats that that whimpers overead said FilesonParade
 Its Dannys soul thats passin now the ColourSergeant said
 For theyre done with Danny Deever you can ear the quickstep play
 The regiments in column an theyre marchin us away
 Ho the young recruits are shakin an theyll want their beer today
 After hangin Danny Deever in the mornin




TOMMY


 I went into a publicouse to get a pint o beer
 The publican e up an sez We serve no redcoats here
 The girls beind the bar they laughed an giggled fit to die
 I outs into the street again an to myself sez I
 O its Tommy this an Tommy that an Tommy go away
 But its Thank you Mister Atkins when the band begins to play
 The band begins to play my boys the band begins to play
 O its Thank you Mister Atkins when the band begins to play

 I went into a theatre as sober as could be
 They gave a drunk civilian room but adnt none for me
 They sent me to the gallery or round the musicalls
 But when it comes to fightin Lord theyll shove me in the stalls
 For its Tommy this an Tommy that an Tommy wait outside
 But its Special train for Atkins when the troopers on the tide
 The troopships on the tide my boys the troopships on the tide
 O its Special train for Atkins when the troopers on the tide

 Yes makin mock o uniforms that guard you while you sleep
 Is cheaper than them uniforms an theyre starvation cheap
 An hustlin drunken soldiers when theyre goin large a bit
 Is five times better business than paradin in full kit
 Then its Tommy this an Tommy that an Tommy ows yer soul
 But its Thin red line of eroes when the drums begin to roll
 The drums begin to roll my boys the drums begin to roll
 O its Thin red line of eroes when the drums begin to roll

 We arent no thin red eroes nor we arent no blackguards too
 But single men in barricks most remarkable like you
 An if sometimes our conduck isnt all your fancy paints
 Why single men in barricks dont grow into plaster saints
 While its Tommy this an Tommy that an Tommy fall beind
 But its Please to walk in front sir when theres trouble in the wind
 Theres trouble in the wind my boys theres trouble in the wind
 O its Please to walk in front sir when theres trouble in the wind

 You talk o better food for us an schools an fires an all
 Well wait for extry rations if you treat us rational
 Dont mess about the cookroom slops but prove it to our face
 The Widows Uniform is not the soldiermans disgrace
 For its Tommy this an Tommy that an Chuck him out the brute
 But its Saviour of is country when the guns begin to shoot
 An its Tommy this an Tommy that an anything you please
 An Tommy aint a bloomin fool  you bet that Tommy sees




FUZZYWUZZY

 Soudan Expeditionary Force


 Weve fought with many men acrost the seas
 An some of em was brave an some was not
 The Paythan an the Zulu an Burmese
 But the Fuzzy was the finest o the lot
 We never got a haporths change of im
 E squatted in the scrub an ocked our orses
 E cut our sentries up at Sua_kim_
 An e played the cat an banjo with our forces
 So eres _to_ you FuzzyWuzzy at your ome in the Soudan
 Youre a pore benighted eathen but a firstclass fightin man
 We gives you your certificate an if you want it signed
 Well come an ave a romp with you whenever youre inclined

 We took our chanst among the Khyber ills
 The Boers knocked us silly at a mile
 The Burman give us Irriwaddy chills
 An a Zulu _impi_ dished us up in style
 But all we ever got from such as they
 Was pop to what the Fuzzy made us swaller
 We eld our bloomin own the papers say
 But man for man the Fuzzy knocked us oller
 Then eres _to_ you FuzzyWuzzy an the missis and the kid
 Our orders was to break you an of course we went an did
 We sloshed you with Martinis an it wasnt ardly fair
 But for all the odds agin you FuzzyWuz you broke the square

 E asnt got no papers of is own
 E asnt got no medals nor rewards
 So we must certify the skill es shown
 In usin of is long twoanded swords
 When es oppin in an out among the bush
 With is coffineaded shield an shovelspear
 An appy day with Fuzzy on the rush
 Will last an ealthy Tommy for a year
 So eres _to_ you FuzzyWuzzy an your friends which are no more
 If we adnt lost some messmates we would elp you to deplore
 But give an takes the gospel an well call the bargain fair
 For if you ave lost more than us you crumpled up the square

 E rushes at the smoke when we let drive
 An before we know es ackin at our ead
 Es all ot sand an ginger when alive
 An es generally shammin when es dead
 Es a daisy es a ducky es a lamb
 Es a injiarubber idiot on the spree
 Es the ony thing that doesnt give a damn
 For a Regiment o British Infantree
 So eres _to_ you FuzzyWuzzy at your ome in the Soudan
 Youre a pore benighted eathen but a firstclass fightin man
 An eres _to_ you FuzzyWuzzy with your ayrick ead of air 
 You big black boundin beggar  for you broke a British square

SCREWGUNS


 Smokin my pipe on the mountings sniffin the mornin cool
 I walks in my old brown gaiters along o my old brown mule
 With seventy gunners beind me an never a beggar forgets
 Its only the pick of the Army
 that handles the dear little pets  Tss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns  the screwguns they all love you
 So when we call round with a few guns
 o course you will know what to do  hoo hoo
 Jest send in your Chief an surrender 
 its worse if you fights or you runs
 You can go where you please you can skid up the trees
 but you dont get away from the guns

 They sends us along where the roads are but mostly we goes where they aint
 Wed climb up the side of a signboard an trust to the stick o the paint
 Weve chivied the Naga an Looshai weve give the Afreedeeman fits
 For we fancies ourselves at two thousand
 we guns that are built in two bits  Tss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns   

 If a man doesnt work why we drills im an teaches im ow to behave
 If a beggar cant march why we kills im an rattles im into is grave
 Youve got to stand up to our business an spring without snatchin or fuss
 Dyou say that you sweat with the fieldguns
 By God you must lather with us  Tss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns   

 The eagles is screamin around us the rivers amoanin below
 Were clear o the pine an the oakscrub
 were out on the rocks an the snow
 An the wind is as thin as a whiplash what carries away to the plains
 The rattle an stamp o the leadmules 
 the jingletyjink o the chains  Tss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns   

 Theres a wheel on the Horns o the Mornin
 an a wheel on the edge o the Pit
 An a drop into nothin beneath you as straight as a beggar can spit
 With the sweat runnin out o your shirtsleeves
 an the sun off the snow in your face
 An arf o the men on the dragropes
 to hold the old gun in er place  Tss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns   

 Smokin my pipe on the mountings sniffin the mornin cool
 I climbs in my old brown gaiters along o my old brown mule
 The monkey can say what our road was 
 the wildgoat e knows where we passed
 Stand easy you longeared old darlins
 Out dragropes With shrapnel Hold fast  Tss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns  the screwguns they all love you
 So when we take tea with a few guns
 o course you will know what to do  hoo hoo
 Jest send in your Chief an surrender 
 its worse if you fights or you runs
 You may hide in the caves theyll be only your graves
 but you cant get away from the guns




CELLS


 Ive a head like a concertina Ive a tongue like a buttonstick
 Ive a mouth like an old potato and Im more than a little sick
 But Ive had my fun o the Corprals Guard Ive made the cinders fly
 And Im here in the Clink for a thundering drink
 and blacking the Corporals eye
 With a secondhand overcoat under my head
 And a beautiful view of the yard
 O its packdrill for me and a fortnights CB
 For drunk and resisting the Guard
 Mad drunk and resisting the Guard 
 Strewth but I socked it them hard
 So its packdrill for me and a fortnights CB
 For drunk and resisting the Guard

 I started o canteen porter I finished o canteen beer
 But a dose o gin that a mate slipped in it was that that brought me here
 Twas that and an extry double Guard that rubbed my nose in the dirt
 But I fell away with the Corprals stock
 and the best of the Corprals shirt

 I left my cap in a publichouse my boots in the public road
 And Lord knows where and I dont care my belt and my tunic goed
 Theyll stop my pay theyll cut away the stripes I used to wear
 But I left my mark on the Corprals face and I think hell keep it there

 My wife she cries on the barrackgate my kid in the barrackyard
 It aint that I mind the Ordly room  its _that_ that cuts so hard
 Ill take my oath before them both that I will sure abstain
 But as soon as Im in with a mate and gin I know Ill do it again
 With a secondhand overcoat under my head
 And a beautiful view of the yard
 Yes its packdrill for me and a fortnights CB
 For drunk and resisting the Guard
 Mad drunk and resisting the Guard 
 Strewth but I socked it them hard
 So its packdrill for me and a fortnights CB
 For drunk and resisting the Guard




GUNGA DIN


 You may talk o gin and beer
 When youre quartered safe out ere
 An youre sent to pennyfights an Aldershot it
 But when it comes to slaughter
 You will do your work on water
 An youll lick the bloomin boots of im thats got it
 Now in Injias sunny clime
 Where I used to spend my time
 Aservin of Er Majesty the Queen
 Of all them blackfaced crew
 The finest man I knew
 Was our regimental bhisti Gunga Din
 He was Din Din Din
 You limpin lump o brickdust Gunga Din
 Hi slippery _hitherao_
 Water get it _Panee lao_ Bring water swiftly
 You squidgynosed old idol Gunga Din

 The uniform e wore
 Was nothin much before
 An rather less than arf o that beind
 For a piece o twisty rag
 An a goatskin waterbag
 Was all the fieldequipment e could find
 When the sweatin trooptrain lay
 In a sidin through the day
 Where the eat would make your bloomin eyebrows crawl
 We shouted Harry By Mr Atkinss equivalent for O brother
 Till our throats were brickydry
 Then we wopped im cause e couldnt serve us all
 It was Din Din Din
 You eathen where the mischief ave you been
 You put some _juldee_ in it Be quick
 Or Ill _marrow_ you this minute Hit you
 If you dont fill up my helmet Gunga Din

 E would dot an carry one
 Till the longest day was done
 An e didnt seem to know the use o fear
 If we charged or broke or cut
 You could bet your bloomin nut
 Ed be waitin fifty paces right flank rear
 With is _mussick_ on is back Waterskin
 E would skip with our attack
 An watch us till the bugles made Retire
 An for all is dirty ide
 E was white clear white inside
 When e went to tend the wounded under fire
 It was Din Din Din
 With the bullets kickin dustspots on the green
 When the cartridges ran out
 You could hear the frontfiles shout
 Hi ammunitionmules an Gunga Din

 I shant forgit the night
 When I dropped beind the fight
 With a bullet where my beltplate should a been
 I was chokin mad with thirst
 An the man that spied me first
 Was our good old grinnin gruntin Gunga Din
 E lifted up my ead
 An he plugged me where I bled
 An e guv me arfapint o watergreen
 It was crawlin and it stunk
 But of all the drinks Ive drunk
 Im gratefullest to one from Gunga Din
 It was Din Din Din
 Eres a beggar with a bullet through is spleen
 Es chawin up the ground
 An es kickin all around
 For Gawds sake git the water Gunga Din

 E carried me away
 To where a dooli lay
 An a bullet come an drilled the beggar clean
 E put me safe inside
 An just before e died
 I ope you liked your drink sez Gunga Din
 So Ill meet im later on
 At the place where e is gone 
 Where its always double drill and no canteen
 Ell be squattin on the coals
 Givin drink to poor damned souls
 An Ill get a swig in hell from Gunga Din
 Yes Din Din Din
 You Lazarushianleather Gunga Din
 Though Ive belted you and flayed you
 By the livin Gawd that made you
 Youre a better man than I am Gunga Din




OONTS

 Northern India Transport Train


 Wot makes the soldiers eart to penk wot makes im to perspire
 It isnt standin up to charge nor lyin down to fire
 But its everlastin waitin on a everlastin road
 For the commissariat camel an is commissariat load
 O the oont O the oont O the commissariat oont
 With is silly neck abobbin like a basket full o snakes
 We packs im like an idol an you ought to ear im grunt
 An when we gets im loaded up is blessed girthrope breaks

  Camel  _oo_ is pronounced like _u_ in bull but
 by Mr Atkins to rhyme with front

 Wot makes the rearguard swear so ard when night is drorin in
 An every native follower is shiverin for is skin
 It aint the chanst o being rushed by Paythans from the ills
 Its the commissariat camel puttin on is bloomin frills
 O the oont O the oont O the hairy scary oont
 Atrippin over tentropes when weve got the night alarm
 We socks im with a stretcherpole an eads im off in front
 An when weve saved is bloomin life e chaws our bloomin arm

 The orse e knows above a bit the bullocks but a fool
 The elephants a gentleman the batterymules a mule
 But the commissariat camuel when all is said an done
 Es a devil an a ostrich an a orphanchild in one
 O the oont O the oont O the Gawdforsaken oont
 The lumpyumpy umminbird asingin where e lies
 Es blocked the whole division from the rearguard to the front
 An when we get him up again  the beggar goes an dies

 Ell gall an chafe an lame an fight  e smells most awful vile
 Ell lose isself for ever if you let im stray a mile
 Es game to graze the ole day long an owl the ole night through
 An when e comes to greasy ground e splits isself in two
 O the oont O the oont O the floppin droppin oont
 When is long legs give from under an is meltin eye is dim
 The tribes is up beind us and the tribes is out in front 
 It aint no jam for Tommy but its kites an crows for im

 So when the cruel march is done an when the roads is blind
 An when we sees the camp in front an ears the shots beind
 Ho then we strips is saddle off and all is woes is past
 E thinks on us that used im so and gets revenge at last
 O the oont O the oont O the floatin bloatin oont
 The late lamented camel in the watercut e lies
 We keeps a mile beind im an we keeps a mile in front
 But e gets into the drinkincasks and then o course we dies




LOOT


 If youve ever stole a pheasantegg beind the keepers back
 If youve ever snigged the washin from the line
 If youve ever crammed a gander in your bloomin aversack
 You will understand this little song o mine
 But the service rules are ard an from such we are debarred
 For the same with English morals does not suit
 _Cornet_ Toot toot
 Wy they call a man a robber if e stuffs is marchin clobber
 With the 
 _Chorus_ Loo loo Lulu lulu Loo loo Loot loot loot
 Ow the loot
 Bloomin loot
 Thats the thing to make the boys git up an shoot
 Its the same with dogs an men
 If youd make em come again
 Clap em forward with a Loo loo Lulu Loot
 _ff_ Whoopee Tear im puppy Loo loo Lulu Loot loot loot

 If youve knocked a nigger edgeways when es thrustin for your life
 You must leave im very careful where e fell
 An may thank your stars an gaiters if you didnt feel is knife
 That you aint told off to bury im as well
 Then the sweatin Tommies wonder as they spade the beggars under
 Why lootin should be entered as a crime
 So if my song youll ear I will learn you plain an clear
 Ow to pay yourself for fightin overtime
 _Chorus_ With the loot   

 Now remember when youre acking round a gilded Burma god
 That is eyes is very often precious stones
 An if you treat a nigger to a dose o cleaninrod
 Es like to show you everything e owns
 When e wont prodooce no more pour some water on the floor
 Where you ear it answer ollow to the boot
 _Cornet_ Toot toot 
 When the ground begins to sink shove your baynick down the chink
 An youre sure to touch the 
 _Chorus_ Loo loo Lulu Loot loot loot
 Ow the loot   

 When from ouse to ouse youre unting you must always work in pairs 
 It alves the gain but safer you will find 
 For a single man gets bottled on them twistywisty stairs
 An a woman comes and clobs im from beind
 When youve turned em inside out an it seems beyond a doubt
 As if there werent enough to dust a flute
 _Cornet_ Toot toot 
 Before you sling your ook at the ousetops take a look
 For its underneath the tiles they ide the loot
 _Chorus_ Ow the loot   

 You can mostly square a Sergint an a Quartermaster too
 If you only take the proper way to go
 _I_ could never keep my pickins but Ive learned you all I knew 
 An dont you never say I told you so
 An now Ill bid goodbye for Im gettin rather dry

SNARLEYOW


 This appened in a battle to a battry of the corps
 Which is first among the women an amazin first in war
 An what the bloomin battle was I dont remember now
 But Twos offlead e answered to the name o _Snarleyow_
 Down in the Infantry nobody cares
 Down in the Cavalry Colonel e swears
 But down in the lead with the wheel at the flog
 Turns the bold Bombardier to a little whipped dog

 They was movin into action they was needed very sore
 To learn a little schoolin to a native army corps
 They ad nipped against an uphill they was tuckin down the brow
 When a tricky trundlin roundshot give the knock to _Snarleyow_

 They cut im loose an left im  e was almost tore in two 
 But he tried to follow after as a welltrained orse should do
 E went an fouled the limber an the Drivers Brother squeals
 Pull up pull up for _Snarleyow_  is heads between is eels

 The Driver umped is shoulder for the wheels was goin round
 An there aint no Stop conductor when a battrys changin ground
 Sez e I broke the beggar in an very sad I feels
 But I couldnt pull up not for _you_  your ead between your eels

 E adnt ardly spoke the word before a droppin shell
 A little right the battry an between the sections fell
 An when the smoke ad cleared away before the limber wheels
 There lay the Drivers Brother with is ead between is eels

 Then sez the Drivers Brother an is words was very plain
 For Gawds own sake get over me an put me out o pain
 They saw is wounds was mortial an they judged that it was best
 So they took an drove the limber straight across is back an chest

 The Driver e give nothin cept a little coughin grunt
 But e swung is orses andsome when it came to Action Front
 An if one wheel was juicy you may lay your Monday head
 Twas juicier for the niggers when the case begun to spread

 The moril of this story it is plainly to be seen
 You avnt got no families when servin of the Queen 
 You avnt got no brothers fathers sisters wives or sons 
 If you want to win your battles take an work your bloomin guns
 Down in the Infantry nobody cares
 Down in the Cavalry Colonel e swears
 But down in the lead with the wheel at the flog
 Turns the bold Bombardier to a little whipped dog

BELTS


 There was a row in Silver Street thats near to Dublin Quay
 Between an Irish regiment an English cavalree
 It started at Revelly an it lasted on till dark
 The first man dropped at Harrisons the last forninst the Park
 For it was  Belts belts belts an thats one for you
 An it was Belts belts belts an thats done for you
 O buckle an tongue
 Was the song that we sung
 From Harrisons down to the Park

 There was a row in Silver Street  the regiments was out
 They called us Delhi Rebels an we answered Threes about
 That drew them like a hornets nest  we met them good an large
 The English at the double an the Irish at the charge
 Then it was  Belts   

 There was a row in Silver Street  an I was in it too
 We passed the time o day an then the belts went whirraru
 I misremember what occurred but subsequint the storm
 A _Freemans Journal Supplemint_ was all my uniform
 O it was  Belts   

 There was a row in Silver Street  they sent the Polis there
 The English were too drunk to know the Irish didnt care
 But when they grew impertinint we simultaneous rose
 Till half o them was Liffey mud an half was tatthered cloes
 For it was  Belts   

 There was a row in Silver Street  it might ha raged till now
 But some one drew his sidearm clear an nobody knew how
 Twas Hogan took the point an dropped we saw the red blood run
 An so we all was murderers that started out in fun
 While it was  Belts   

 There was a row in Silver Street  but that put down the shine
 Wid each man whisperin to his next Twas never work o mine
 We went away like beaten dogs an down the street we bore him
 The poor dumb corpse that couldnt tell the bhoys were sorry for him
 When it was  Belts   

 There was a row in Silver Street  it isnt over yet
 For half of us are under guard wid punishments to get
 Tis all a merricle to me as in the Clink I lie
 There was a row in Silver Street  begod I wonder why
 But it was  Belts belts belts an thats one for you
 An it was Belts belts belts an thats done for you
 O buckle an tongue
 Was the song that we sung
 From Harrisons down to the Park




THE YOUNG BRITISH SOLDIER


 When the arfmade recruity goes out to the East
 E acts like a babe an e drinks like a beast
 An e wonders because e is frequent deceased
 Ere es fit for to serve as a soldier
 Serve serve serve as a soldier
 Serve serve serve as a soldier
 Serve serve serve as a soldier
 Sooldier _OF_ the Queen

 Now all you recruities whats drafted today
 You shut up your ragbox an ark to my lay
 An Ill sing you a soldier as far as I may
 A soldier whats fit for a soldier
 Fit fit fit for a soldier   

 First mind you steer clear o the grogsellers huts
 For they sell you Fixed Baynets that rots out your guts 
 Ay drink that ud eat the live steel from your butts 
 An its bad for the young British soldier
 Bad bad bad for the soldier   

 When the cholera comes  as it will past a doubt 
 Keep out of the wet and dont go on the shout
 For the sickness gets in as the liquor dies out
 An it crumples the young British soldier
 Crum crum crumples the soldier   

 But the worst o your foes is the sun overead
 You _must_ wear your elmet for all that is said
 If e finds you uncovered ell knock you down dead
 An youll die like a fool of a soldier
 Fool fool fool of a soldier   

 If youre cast for fatigue by a sergeant unkind
 Dont grouse like a woman nor crack on nor blind
 Be handy and civil and then you will find
 That its beer for the young British soldier
 Beer beer beer for the soldier   

 Now if you must marry take care she is old 
 A troopsergeants widows the nicest Im told
 For beauty wont help if your rations is cold
 Nor love aint enough for a soldier
 Nough nough nough for a soldier   

 If the wife should go wrong with a comrade be loath
 To shoot when you catch em  youll swing on my oath 
 Make im take er and keep er thats Hell for them both
 An youre shut o the curse of a soldier
 Curse curse curse of a soldier   

 When first under fire an youre wishful to duck
 Dont look nor take eed at the man that is struck
 Be thankful youre livin and trust to your luck
 And march to your front like a soldier
 Front front front like a soldier   

 When arf of your bullets fly wide in the ditch
 Dont call your Martini a crosseyed old bitch
 Shes human as you are  you treat her as sich
 An shell fight for the young British soldier
 Fight fight fight for the soldier   

 When shakin their bustles like ladies so fine
 The guns o the enemy wheel into line
 Shoot low at the limbers an dont mind the shine
 For noise never startles the soldier
 Start start startles the soldier   

 If your officers dead and the sergeants look white
 Remember its ruin to run from a fight
 So take open order lie down and sit tight
 And wait for supports like a soldier
 Wait wait wait like a soldier   

 When youre wounded and left on Afghanistans plains
 And the women come out to cut up what remains
 Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains
 An go to your Gawd like a soldier
 Go go go like a soldier
 Go go go like a soldier
 Go go go like a soldier
 Sooldier _of_ the Queen




MANDALAY


 By the old Moulmein Pagoda lookin eastward to the sea
 Theres a Burma girl asettin and I know she thinks o me
 For the wind is in the palmtrees and the templebells they say
 Come you back you British soldier come you back to Mandalay
 Come you back to Mandalay
 Where the old Flotilla lay
 Cant you ear their paddles chunkin from Rangoon to Mandalay
 On the road to Mandalay
 Where the flyinfishes play
 An the dawn comes up like thunder outer China crost the Bay

 Er petticoat was yaller an er little cap was green
 An er name was Supiyawlat  jes the same as Theebaws Queen
 An I seed her first asmokin of a whackin white cheroot
 An awastin Christian kisses on an eathen idols foot
 Bloomin idol made omud 
 Wot they called the Great Gawd Budd 
 Plucky lot she cared for idols when I kissed er where she stud
 On the road to Mandalay   

 When the mist was on the ricefields an the sun was droppin slow
 Shed git er little banjo an shed sing _Kullalolo_
 With er arm upon my shoulder an er cheek agin my cheek
 We useter watch the steamers an the _hathis_ pilin teak
 Elephints apilin teak
 In the sludgy squdgy creek
 Where the silence ung that eavy you was arf afraid to speak
 On the road to Mandalay   

 But thats all shove beind me  long ago an fur away
 An there aint no busses runnin from the Bank to Mandalay
 An Im learnin ere in London what the tenyear soldier tells
 If youve eard the East acallin you wont never eed naught else
 No you wont eed nothin else
 But them spicy garlic smells
 An the sunshine an the palmtrees an the tinkly templebells
 On the road to Mandalay   

 I am sick o wastin leather on these gritty pavinstones
 An the blasted Henglish drizzle wakes the fever in my bones
 Tho I walks with fifty ousemaids outer Chelsea to the Strand
 An they talks a lot o lovin but wot do they understand
 Beefy face an grubby and 
 Law wot do they understand
 Ive a neater sweeter maiden in a cleaner greener land
 On the road to Mandalay   

 Ship me somewheres east of Suez where the best is like the worst
 Where there arent no Ten Commandments an a man can raise a thirst
 For the templebells are callin an its there that I would be 
 By the old Moulmein Pagoda looking lazy at the sea
 On the road to Mandalay
 Where the old Flotilla lay
 With our sick beneath the awnings when we went to Mandalay
 On the road to Mandalay
 Where the flyinfishes play
 An the dawn comes up like thunder outer China crost the Bay

GENTLEMENRANKERS


 To the legion of the lost ones to the cohort of the damned
 To my brethren in their sorrow overseas
 Sings a gentleman of England cleanly bred machinely crammed
 And a trooper of the Empress if you please
 Yea a trooper of the forces who has run his own six horses
 And faith he went the pace and went it blind
 And the world was more than kin while he held the ready tin
 But today the Sergeants something less than kind
 Were poor little lambs whove lost our way
 Baa Baa Baa
 Were little black sheep whove gone astray
 Baaaaaa
 Gentlemenrankers out on the spree
 Damned from here to Eternity
 God ha mercy on such as we
 Baa Yah Bah

 Oh its sweet to sweat through stables sweet to empty kitchen slops
 And its sweet to hear the tales the troopers tell
 To dance with blowzy housemaids at the regimental hops
 And thrash the cad who says you waltz too well
 Yes it makes you cockahoop to be Rider to your troop
 And branded with a blasted worsted spur
 When you envy O how keenly one poor Tommy being cleanly
 Who blacks your boots and sometimes calls you Sir

 If the home we never write to and the oaths we never keep
 And all we know most distant and most dear
 Across the snoring barrackroom return to break our sleep
 Can you blame us if we soak ourselves in beer
 When the drunken comrade mutters and the great guardlantern gutters
 And the horror of our fall is written plain
 Every secret selfrevealing on the aching whitewashed ceiling
 Do you wonder that we drug ourselves from pain

 We have done with Hope and Honour we are lost to Love and Truth
 We are dropping down the ladder rung by rung
 And the measure of our torment is the measure of our youth
 God help us for we knew the worst too young
 Our shame is clean repentance for the crime that brought the sentence
 Our pride it is to know no spur of pride
 And the Curse of Reuben holds us till an alien turf enfolds us
 And we die and none can tell Them where we died
 Were poor little lambs whove lost our way
 Baa Baa Baa
 Were little black sheep whove gone astray
 Baaaaaa
 Gentlemenrankers out on the spree
 Damned from here to Eternity
 God ha mercy on such as we
 Baa Yah Bah




ROUTE MARCHIN


 Were marchin on relief over Injias sunny plains
 A little front o Christmastime an just beind the Rains
 Ho get away you bullockman youve eard the bugle blowed
 Theres a regiment acomin down the Grand Trunk Road
 With its best foot first
 And the road asliding past
 An every bloomin campinground exactly like the last
 While the Big Drum says
 With is _rowdydowdydow_ 
 _Kiko kissywarsti_ dont you _hamsher argy jow_

  Why dont you get on

 Oh theres them Injian temples to admire when you see
 Theres the peacock round the corner an the monkey up the tree
 An theres that rummy silver grass awavin in the wind
 An the old Grand Trunk atrailin like a riflesling beind
 While its best foot first   

 At halfpast fives Revelly an our tents they down must come
 Like a lot of button mushrooms when you pick em up at ome
 But its over in a minute an at six the column starts
 While the women and the kiddies sit an shiver in the carts
 An its best foot first   

 Oh then its open order an we lights our pipes an sings
 An we talks about our rations an a lot of other things
 An we thinks o friends in England an we wonders what theyre at
 An ow they would admire for to hear us sling the _bat_
 An its best foot first   

  Language Thomass first and firmest conviction is that
 he is a profound Orientalist and a fluent speaker of Hindustani
 As a matter of fact he depends largely on the signlanguage

 Its none so bad o Sunday when youre lyin at your ease
 To watch the kites awheelin round them feathereaded trees
 For although there aint no women yet there aint no barrickyards
 So the orficers goes shootin an the men they plays at cards
 Till its best foot first   

 So ark an eed you rookies which is always grumblin sore
 Theres worser things than marchin from Umballa to Cawnpore
 An if your eels are blistered an they feels to urt like ell
 You drop some tallow in your socks an that will make em well
 For its best foot first   

 Were marchin on relief over Injias coral strand
 Eight undred fightin Englishmen the Colonel and the Band
 Ho get away you bullockman youve eard the bugle blowed
 Theres a regiment acomin down the Grand Trunk Road
 With its best foot first
 And the road asliding past
 An every bloomin campinground exactly like the last
 While the Big Drum says
 With is _rowdydowdydow_ 
 _Kiko kissywarsti_ dont you _hamsher argy jow_




SHILLIN A DAY


 My name is OKelly Ive heard the Revelly
 From Birr to Bareilly from Leeds to Lahore
 HongKong and Peshawur
 Lucknow and Etawah
 And fiftyfive more all endin in pore
 Black Death and his quickness the depth and the thickness
 Of sorrow and sickness Ive known on my way
 But Im old and Im nervis
 Im cast from the Service
 And all I deserve is a shillin a day
 _Chorus_ Shillin a day
 Bloomin good pay 
 Lucky to touch it a shillin a day

 Oh it drives me half crazy to think of the days I
 Went slap for the Ghazi my sword at my side
 When we rode Hellforleather
 Both squadrons together
 That didnt care whether we lived or we died
 But its no use despairin my wife must go charin
 An me commissairin the paybills to better
 So if me you beold
 In the wet and the cold
 By the Grand Metropold wont you give me a letter
 _Full chorus_ Give im a letter 
 Cant do no better
 Late TroopSergeantMajor an  runs with a letter
 Think what es been
 Think what es seen
 Think of his pension an 

 GAWD SAVE THE QUEEN






OTHER VERSES




THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST


 Oh East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet
 Till Earth and Sky stand presently at Gods great Judgment Seat
 But there is neither East nor West Border nor Breed nor Birth
 When two strong men stand face to face
 tho they come from the ends of the earth

 Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Borderside
 And he has lifted the Colonels mare that is the Colonels pride
 He has lifted her out of the stabledoor between the dawn and the day
 And turned the calkins upon her feet and ridden her far away
 Then up and spoke the Colonels son that led a troop of the Guides
 Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides
 Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan the son of the Ressaldar
 If ye know the track of the morningmist ye know where his pickets are
 At dusk he harries the Abazai  at dawn he is into Bonair
 But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare
 So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly
 By the favour of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tongue of Jagai
 But if he be past the Tongue of Jagai right swiftly turn ye then
 For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamals men
 There is rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn between
 And ye may hear a breechbolt snick where never a man is seen
 The Colonels son has taken a horse and a raw rough dun was he
 With the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell
 and the head of the gallowstree
 The Colonels son to the Fort has won they bid him stay to eat 
 Who rides at the tail of a Border thief he sits not long at his meat
 Hes up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly
 Till he was aware of his fathers mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai
 Till he was aware of his fathers mare with Kamal upon her back
 And when he could spy the white of her eye he made the pistol crack
 He has fired once he has fired twice but the whistling ball went wide
 Ye shoot like a soldier Kamal said Show now if ye can ride
 Its up and over the Tongue of Jagai as blown dustdevils go
 The dun he fled like a stag of ten but the mare like a barren doe
 The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above
 But the red mare played with the snafflebars as a maiden plays with a glove
 There was rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn between
 And thrice he heard a breechbolt snick tho never a man was seen
 They have ridden the low moon out of the sky their hoofs drum up the dawn
 The dun he went like a wounded bull but the mare like a newroused fawn
 The dun he fell at a watercourse  in a woful heap fell he
 And Kamal has turned the red mare back and pulled the rider free
 He has knocked the pistol out of his hand  small room was there to strive
 Twas only by favour of mine quoth he ye rode so long alive
 There was not a rock for twenty mile there was not a clump of tree
 But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee
 If I had raised my bridlehand as I have held it low
 The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row
 If I had bowed my head on my breast as I have held it high
 The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly
 Lightly answered the Colonels son Do good to bird and beast
 But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast
 If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away
 Belike the price of a jackals meal were more than a thief could pay
 They will feed their horse on the standing crop
 their men on the garnered grain
 The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain
 But if thou thinkest the price be fair  thy brethren wait to sup
 The hound is kin to the jackalspawn  howl dog and call them up
 And if thou thinkest the price be high in steer and gear and stack
 Give me my fathers mare again and Ill fight my own way back
 Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet
 No talk shall be of dogs said he when wolf and gray wolf meet
 May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath
 What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death
 Lightly answered the Colonels son I hold by the blood of my clan
 Take up the mare for my fathers gift  by God she has carried a man
 The red mare ran to the Colonels son and nuzzled against his breast
 We be two strong men said Kamal then but she loveth the younger best
 So she shall go with a lifters dower my turquoisestudded rein
 My broidered saddle and saddlecloth and silver stirrups twain
 The Colonels son a pistol drew and held it muzzleend
 Ye have taken the one from a foe said he
 will ye take the mate from a friend
 A gift for a gift said Kamal straight a limb for the risk of a limb
 Thy father has sent his son to me Ill send my son to him
 With that he whistled his only son that dropped from a mountaincrest 
 He trod the ling like a buck in spring and he looked like a lance in rest
 Now here is thy master Kamal said who leads a troop of the Guides
 And thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides
 Till Death or I cut loose the tie at camp and board and bed
 Thy life is his  thy fate it is to guard him with thy head
 So thou must eat the White Queens meat and all her foes are thine
 And thou must harry thy fathers hold for the peace of the Borderline
 And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power 
 Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur

 They have looked each other between the eyes and there they found no fault
 They have taken the Oath of the BrotherinBlood on leavened bread and salt
 They have taken the Oath of the BrotherinBlood on fire and freshcut sod
 On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife and the Wondrous Names of God
 The Colonels son he rides the mare and Kamals boy the dun
 And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one
 And when they drew to the QuarterGuard full twenty swords flew clear 
 There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer
 Ha done ha done said the Colonels son
 Put up the steel at your sides
 Last night ye had struck at a Border thief 
 tonight tis a man of the Guides

 Oh East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet
 Till Earth and Sky stand presently at Gods great Judgment Seat
 But there is neither East nor West Border nor Breed nor Birth
 When two strong men stand face to face
 tho they come from the ends of the earth




THE LAST SUTTEE

 Not many years ago a King died in one of the Rajpoot States
 His wives disregarding the orders of the English against Suttee
 would have broken out of the palace had not the gates been barred
 But one of them disguised as the Kings favourite dancinggirl
 passed through the line of guards and reached the pyre There
 her courage failing she prayed her cousin a baron of the court
 to kill her This he did not knowing who she was


 Udai Chand lay sick to death
 In his hold by Gungra hill
 All night we heard the deathgongs ring
 For the soul of the dying Rajpoot King
 All night beat up from the womens wing
 A cry that we could not still

 All night the barons came and went
 The lords of the outer guard
 All night the cressets glimmered pale
 On Ulwar sabre and Tonk jezail
 Mewar headstall and Marwar mail
 That clinked in the palace yard

 In the Golden room on the palace roof
 All night he fought for air
 And there was sobbing behind the screen
 Rustle and whisper of women unseen
 And the hungry eyes of the Boondi Queen
 On the death she might not share

 He passed at dawn  the deathfire leaped
 From ridge to riverhead
 From the Malwa plains to the Abu scars
 And wail upon wail went up to the stars
 Behind the grim zenanabars
 When they knew that the King was dead

 The dumb priest knelt to tie his mouth
 And robe him for the pyre
 The Boondi Queen beneath us cried
 See now that we die as our mothers died
 In the bridalbed by our masters side
 Out women  to the fire

 We drove the great gates home apace
 White hands were on the sill
 But ere the rush of the unseen feet
 Had reached the turn to the open street
 The bars shot down the guarddrum beat 
 We held the dovecot still

 A face looked down in the gathering day
 And laughing spoke from the wall
 Ohe they mourn here let me by 
 Azizun the Lucknow nautchgirl I
 When the house is rotten the rats must fly
 And I seek another thrall

 For I ruled the King as neer did Queen 
 Tonight the Queens rule me
 Guard them safely but let me go
 Or ever they pay the debt they owe
 In scourge and torture She leaped below
 And the grim guard watched her flee

 They knew that the King had spent his soul
 On a Northbred dancinggirl
 That he prayed to a flatnosed Lucknow god
 And kissed the ground where her feet had trod
 And doomed to death at her drunken nod
 And swore by her lightest curl

 We bore the King to his fathers place
 Where the tombs of the Sunborn stand
 Where the gray apes swing and the peacocks preen
 On fretted pillar and jewelled screen
 And the wild boar couch in the house of the Queen
 On the drift of the desert sand

 The herald read his titles forth
 We set the logs aglow
 Friend of the English free from fear
 Baron of Luni to Jeysulmeer
 Lord of the Desert of Bikaneer
 King of the Jungle  go

 All night the red flame stabbed the sky
 With wavering windtossed spears
 And out of a shattered temple crept
 A woman who veiled her head and wept
 And called on the King  but the great King slept
 And turned not for her tears

 Small thought had he to mark the strife 
 Cold fear with hot desire 
 When thrice she leaped from the leaping flame
 And thrice she beat her breast for shame
 And thrice like a wounded dove she came
 And moaned about the fire

 One watched a bowshot from the blaze
 The silent streets between
 Who had stood by the King in sport and fray
 To blade in ambush or boar at bay
 And he was a baron old and gray
 And kin to the Boondi Queen

 He said O shameless put aside
 The veil upon thy brow
 Who held the King and all his land
 To the wanton will of a harlots hand
 Will the white ash rise from the blistered brand
 Stoop down and call him now

 Then she By the faith of my tarnished soul
 All things I did not well
 I had hoped to clear ere the fire died
 And lay me down by my masters side
 To rule in Heaven his only bride
 While the others howl in Hell

 But I have felt the fires breath
 And hard it is to die
 Yet if I may pray a Rajpoot lord
 To sully the steel of a Thakurs sword
 With baseborn blood of a trade abhorred 
 And the Thakur answered Ay

 He drew and struck the straight blade drank
 The life beneath the breast
 I had looked for the Queen to face the flame
 But the harlot dies for the Rajpoot dame 
 Sister of mine pass free from shame
 Pass with thy King to rest

 The black log crashed above the white
 The little flames and lean
 Red as slaughter and blue as steel
 That whistled and fluttered from head to heel
 Leaped up anew for they found their meal
 On the heart of  the Boondi Queen




THE BALLAD OF THE KINGS MERCY


 _Abdhur Rahman the Durani Chief of him is the story told
 His mercy fills the Khyber hills  his grace is manifold
 He has taken toll of the North and the South 
 his glory reacheth far
 And they tell the tale of his charity from Balkh to Kandahar_

 Before the old Peshawur Gate where Kurd and Kaffir meet
 The Governor of Kabul dealt the Justice of the Street
 And that was strait as running noose and swift as plunging knife
 Tho he who held the longer purse might hold the longer life

 There was a hound of Hindustan had struck a Euzufzai
 Wherefore they spat upon his face and led him out to die
 It chanced the King went forth that hour when throat was bared to knife
 The Kaffir grovelled underhoof and clamoured for his life

 Then said the King Have hope O friend Yea Death disgraced is hard
 Much honour shall be thine and called the Captain of the Guard
 Yar Khan a bastard of the Blood so citybabble saith
 And he was honoured of the King  the which is salt to Death
 And he was son of Daoud Shah the Reiver of the Plains
 And blood of old Durani Lords ran fire in his veins
 And twas to tame an Afghan pride nor Hell nor Heaven could bind
 The King would make him butcher to a yelping cur of Hind

 Strike said the King Kings blood art thou 
 his death shall be his pride
 Then louder that the crowd might catch Fear not  his arms are tied
 Yar Khan drew clear the Khyber knife and struck and sheathed again
 O man thy will is done quoth he a King this dog hath slain

 _Abdhur Rahman the Durani Chief to the North and the South is sold
 The North and the South shall open their mouth
 to a Ghilzai flag unrolled
 When the big guns speak to the Khyber peak and his dogHeratis fly
 Ye have heard the song  How long How long
 Wolves of the Abazai_

 That night before the watch was set when all the streets were clear
 The Governor of Kabul spoke My King hast thou no fear
 Thou knowest  thou hast heard  his speech died at his masters face
 And grimly said the Afghan King I rule the Afghan race
 My path is mine  see thou to thine  tonight upon thy bed
 Think who there be in Kabul now that clamour for thy head

 That night when all the gates were shut to City and to throne
 Within a little gardenhouse the King lay down alone
 Before the sinking of the moon which is the Night of Night
 Yar Khan came softly to the King to make his honour white
 The children of the town had mocked beneath his horses hoofs
 The harlots of the town had hailed him butcher from their roofs
 But as he groped against the wall two hands upon him fell
 The King behind his shoulder spake Dead man thou dost not well
 Tis ill to jest with Kings by day and seek a boon by night
 And that thou bearest in thy hand is all too sharp to write
 But three days hence if God be good and if thy strength remain
 Thou shalt demand one boon of me and bless me in thy pain
 For I am merciful to all and most of all to thee
 My butcher of the shambles rest  no knife hast thou for me

 _Abdhur Rahman the Durani Chief
 holds hard by the South and the North
 But the Ghilzai knows ere the melting snows
 when the swollen banks break forth
 When the redcoats crawl to the sungar wall
 and his Usbeg lances fail
 Ye have heard the song  How long How long
 Wolves of the Zuka Kheyl_

 They stoned him in the rubbishfield when dawn was in the sky
 According to the written word See that he do not die

 They stoned him till the stones were piled above him on the plain
 And those the labouring limbs displaced they tumbled back again

 One watched beside the dreary mound that veiled the battered thing
 And him the King with laughter called the Herald of the King

 It was upon the second night the night of Ramazan
 The watcher leaning earthward heard the message of Yar Khan
 From shattered breast through shrivelled lips broke forth the rattling breath
 Creature of God deliver me from agony of Death

 They sought the King among his girls and risked their lives thereby
 Protector of the Pitiful give orders that he die

 Bid him endure until the day a lagging answer came
 The night is short and he can pray and learn to bless my name

 Before the dawn three times he spoke and on the day once more
 Creature of God deliver me and bless the King therefor

 They shot him at the morning prayer to ease him of his pain
 And when he heard the matchlocks clink he blessed the King again

 Which thing the singers made a song for all the world to sing
 So that the Outer Seas may know the mercy of the King

 _Abdhur Rahman the Durani Chief of him is the story told
 He has opened his mouth to the North and the South
 they have stuffed his mouth with gold
 Ye know the truth of his tender ruth  and sweet his favours are
 Ye have heard the song  How long How long
 from Balkh to Kandahar_




THE BALLAD OF THE KINGS JEST


 When springtime flushes the desert grass
 Our kafilas wind through the Khyber Pass
 Lean are the camels but fat the frails
 Light are the purses but heavy the bales
 As the snowbound trade of the North comes down
 To the marketsquare of Peshawur town

 In a turquoise twilight crisp and chill
 A kafila camped at the foot of the hill
 Then blue smokehaze of the cooking rose
 And tentpeg answered to hammernose
 And the picketed ponies shag and wild
 Strained at their ropes as the feed was piled
 And the bubbling camels beside the load
 Sprawled for a furlong adown the road
 And the Persian pussycats brought for sale
 Spat at the dogs from the camelbale
 And the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food
 And the campfires twinkled by Fort Jumrood
 And there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk
 A savour of camels and carpets and musk
 A murmur of voices a reek of smoke
 To tell us the trade of the Khyber woke

 The lid of the fleshpot chattered high
 The knives were whetted and  then came I
 To Mahbub Ali the muleteer
 Patching his bridles and counting his gear
 Crammed with the gossip of half a year
 But Mahbub Ali the kindly said
 Better is speech when the belly is fed
 So we plunged the hand to the midwrist deep
 In a cinnamon stew of the fattailed sheep
 And he who never hath tasted the food
 By Allah he knoweth not bad from good

 We cleansed our beards of the muttongrease
 We lay on the mats and were filled with peace
 And the talk slid north and the talk slid south
 With the sliding puffs from the hookahmouth
 Four things greater than all things are 
 Women and Horses and Power and War
 We spake of them all but the last the most
 For I sought a word of a Russian post
 Of a shifty promise an unsheathed sword
 And a graycoat guard on the Helmund ford
 Then Mahbub Ali lowered his eyes
 In the fashion of one who is weaving lies
 Quoth he Of the Russians who can say
 When the night is gathering all is gray
 But we look that the gloom of the night shall die
 In the morning flush of a bloodred sky
 Friend of my heart is it meet or wise
 To warn a King of his enemies
 We know what Heaven or Hell may bring
 But no man knoweth the mind of the King
 That unsought counsel is cursed of God
 Attesteth the story of Wali Dad

 His sire was leaky of tongue and pen
 His dam was a clucking Khuttuck hen
 And the colt bred close to the vice of each
 For he carried the curse of an unstanched speech
 Therewith madness  so that he sought
 The favour of kings at the Kabul court
 And travelled in hope of honour far
 To the line where the graycoat squadrons are
 There have I journeyed too  but I
 Saw naught said naught and  did not die
 He harked to rumour and snatched at a breath
 Of this one knoweth and that one saith 
 Legends that ran from mouth to mouth
 Of a graycoat coming and sack of the South
 These have I also heard  they pass
 With each new spring and the winter grass

 Hotfoot southward forgotten of God
 Back to the city ran Wali Dad
 Even to Kabul  in full durbar
 The King held talk with his Chief in War
 Into the press of the crowd he broke
 And what he had heard of the coming spoke

 Then Gholam Hyder the Red Chief smiled
 As a mother might on a babbling child
 But those who would laugh restrained their breath
 When the face of the King showed dark as death
 Evil it is in full durbar
 To cry to a ruler of gathering war
 Slowly he led to a peachtree small
 That grew by a cleft of the city wall
 And he said to the boy They shall praise thy zeal
 So long as the red spurt follows the steel
 And the Russ is upon us even now
 Great is thy prudence  await them thou
 Watch from the tree Thou art young and strong
 Surely thy vigil is not for long
 The Russ is upon us thy clamour ran
 Surely an hour shall bring their van
 Wait and watch When the host is near
 Shout aloud that my men may hear

 Friend of my heart is it meet or wise
 To warn a King of his enemies
 A guard was set that he might not flee 
 A score of bayonets ringed the tree
 The peachbloom fell in showers of snow
 When he shook at his death as he looked below
 By the power of God who alone is great
 Till the seventh day he fought with his fate
 Then madness took him and men declare
 He mowed in the branches as ape and bear
 And last as a sloth ere his body failed
 And he hung as a bat in the forks and wailed
 And sleep the cord of his hands untied
 And he fell and was caught on the points and died

 Heart of my heart is it meet or wise
 To warn a King of his enemies
 We know what Heaven or Hell may bring
 But no man knoweth the mind of the King
 Of the graycoat coming who can say
 When the night is gathering all is gray
 Two things greater than all things are
 The first is Love and the second War
 And since we know not how War may prove
 Heart of my heart let us talk of Love




WITH SCINDIA TO DELHI


 _More than a hundred years ago in a great battle fought near Delhi
 an Indian Prince rode fifty miles after the day was lost
 with a beggargirl who had loved him and followed him in all his camps
 on his saddlebow He lost the girl when almost within sight of safety
 A Maratta trooper tells the story_


 The wreath of banquet overnight lay withered on the neck
 Our hands and scarfs were saffrondyed for signal of despair
 When we went forth to Paniput to battle with the _Mlech_ 
 Ere we came back from Paniput and left a kingdom there

 Thrice thirty thousand men were we to force the Jumna fords 
 The hawkwinged horse of Damajee mailed squadrons of the Bhao
 Stark levies of the southern hills the Deccans sharpest swords
 And he the harlots traitor son the goatherd Mulhar Rao

 Thrice thirty thousand men were we before the mists had cleared
 The low white mists of morning heard the warconch scream and bray
 We called upon Bhowani and we gripped them by the beard
 We rolled upon them like a flood and washed their ranks away

 The children of the hills of Khost before our lances ran
 We drove the black Rohillas back as cattle to the pen
 Twas then we needed Mulhar Rao to end what we began
 A thousand men had saved the charge he fled the field with ten

 There was no room to clear a sword  no power to strike a blow
 For foot to foot ay breast to breast the battle held us fast 
 Save where the naked hillmen ran and stabbing from below
 Brought down the horse and rider and we trampled them and passed

 To left the roar of musketry rang like a falling flood 
 To right the sunshine rippled red from redder lance and blade 
 Above the dark _Upsaras_ flew beneath us plashed the blood
 And bellying black against the dust the Bhagwa Jhanda swayed

  The Choosers of the Slain

 I saw it fall in smoke and fire the banner of the Bhao
 I heard a voice across the press of one who called in vain 
 Ho Anand Rao Nimbalkhur ride Get aid of Mulhar Rao
 Go shame his squadrons into fight  the Bhao  the Bhao is slain

 Thereat as when a sandbar breaks in clotted spume and spray 
 When rain of later autumn sweeps the Jumna waterhead
 Before their charge from flank to flank our riven ranks gave way
 But of the waters of that flood the Jumna fords ran red

 I held by Scindia my lord as close as man might hold
 A Soobah of the Deccan asks no aid to guard his life
 But Holkars Horse were flying and our chiefest chiefs were cold
 And like a flame among us leapt the long lean Northern knife

 I held by Scindia  my lance from butt to tuft was dyed
 The froth of battle bossed the shield and roped the bridlechain 
 What time beneath our horses feet a maiden rose and cried
 And clung to Scindia and I turned a swordcut from the twain

 He set a spell upon the maid in woodlands long ago
 A hunter by the Tapti banks she gave him water there
 He turned her heart to water and she followed to her woe
 What need had he of Lalun who had twenty maids as fair

 Now in that hour strength left my lord he wrenched his mare aside
 He bound the girl behind him and we slashed and struggled free
 Across the reeling wreck of strife we rode as shadows ride
 From Paniput to Delhi town but not alone were we

 Twas LutufUllah Populzai laid horse upon our track
 A swinefed reiver of the North that lusted for the maid
 I might have barred his path awhile but Scindia called me back
 And I  O woe for Scindia  I listened and obeyed

 League after league the formless scrub took shape and glided by 
 League after league the white road swirled behind the white mares feet 
 League after league when leagues were done we heard the Populzai
 Where sure as Time and swift as Death the tireless footfall beat

 Noons eye beheld that shame of flight the shadows fell we fled
 Where steadfast as the wheeling kite he followed in our train
 The black wolf warred where we had warred the jackal mocked our dead
 And terror born of twilighttide made mad the labouring brain

 I gasped  A kingdom waits my lord her love is but her own
 A day shall mar a day shall cure for her but what for thee
 Cut loose the girl he follows fast Cut loose and ride alone
 Then Scindia twixt his blistered lips  My Queens Queen shall she be

 Of all who ate my bread last night twas she alone that came
 To seek her love between the spears and find her crown therein
 One shame is mine today what need the weight of double shame
 If once we reach the Delhi gate though all be lost I win

 We rode  the white mare failed  her trot a staggering stumble grew 
 The cookingsmoke of even rose and weltered and hung low
 And still we heard the Populzai and still we strained anew
 And Delhi town was very near but nearer was the foe

 Yea Delhi town was very near when Lalun whispered  Slay
 Lord of my life the mare sinks fast  stab deep and let me die
 But Scindia would not and the maid tore free and flung away
 And turning as she fell we heard the clattering Populzai

 Then Scindia checked the gasping mare that rocked and groaned for breath
 And wheeled to charge and plunged the knife a handsbreadth in her side 
 The hunter and the hunted know how that last pause is death 
 The blood had chilled about her heart she reared and fell and died

 Our Gods were kind Before he heard the maidens piteous scream
 A log upon the Delhi road beneath the mare he lay 
 Lost mistress and lost battle passed before him like a dream
 The darkness closed about his eyes  I bore my King away




THE BALLAD OF BOH DA THONE


 _This is the ballad of Boh Da Thone
 Erst a Pretender to Theebaws throne
 Who harried the district of Alalone
 How he met with his fate and the VPP
 At the hand of Harendra Mukerji
 Senior Gomashta GBT_

 _ Value Payable Parcels Post in which the Government
 collects the money for the sender_

 Boh Da Thone was a warrior bold
 His sword and his Snider were bossed with gold

 And the Peacock Banner his henchmen bore
 Was stiff with bullion but stiffer with gore

 He shot at the strong and he slashed at the weak
 From the Salween scrub to the Chindwin teak

 He crucified noble he sacrificed mean
 He filled old ladies with kerosene

 While over the water the papers cried
 The patriot fights for his countryside

 But little they cared for the Native Press
 The worn white soldiers in Khaki dress

 Who tramped through the jungle and camped in the byre
 Who died in the swamp and were tombed in the mire

 Who gave up their lives at the Queens Command
 For the Pride of their Race and the Peace of the Land

 Now first of the foemen of Boh Da Thone
 Was Captain ONeil of the Black Tyrone

 And his was a Company seventy strong
 Who hustled that dissolute Chief along

 There were lads from Galway and Louth and Meath
 Who went to their death with a joke in their teeth

 And worshipped with fluency fervour and zeal
 The mud on the bootheels of Crook ONeil

 But ever a blight on their labours lay
 And ever their quarry would vanish away

 Till the sundried boys of the Black Tyrone
 Took a brotherly interest in Boh Da Thone

 And sooth if pursuit in possession ends
 The Boh and his trackers were best of friends

 The word of a scout  a march by night 
 A rush through the mist  a scattering fight 

 A volley from cover  a corpse in the clearing 
 The glimpse of a loincloth and heavy jade earring 

 The flare of a village  the tally of slain 
 And  the Boh was abroad on the raid again

 They cursed their luck as the Irish will
 They gave him credit for cunning and skill

 They buried their dead they bolted their beef
 And started anew on the track of the thief

 Till in place of the Kalends of Greece men said
 When Crook and his darlings come back with the head

 They had hunted the Boh from the hills to the plain 
 He doubled and broke for the hills again

 They had crippled his power for rapine and raid
 They had routed him out of his pet stockade

 And at last they came when the Day Star tired
 To a camp deserted  a village fired

 A black cross blistered the Morninggold
 And the body upon it was stark and cold

 The wind of the dawn went merrily past
 The high grass bowed her plumes to the blast

 And out of the grass on a sudden broke
 A spirtle of fire a whorl of smoke 

 And Captain ONeil of the Black Tyrone
 Was blessed with a slug in the ulnarbone 
 The gift of his enemy Boh Da Thone

 Now a slug that is hammered from telegraphwire
 Is a thorn in the flesh and a rankling fire

     

 The shotwound festered  as shotwounds may
 In a steaming barrack at Mandalay

 The left arm throbbed and the Captain swore
 Id like to be after the Boh once more

 The fever held him  the Captain said
 Id give a hundred to look at his head

 The Hospital punkahs creaked and whirred
 But Babu Harendra Gomashta heard

 He thought of the canebrake green and dank
 That girdled his home by the Dacca tank

 He thought of his wife and his High School son
 He thought  but abandoned the thought  of a gun

 His sleep was broken by visions dread
 Of a shining Boh with a silver head

 He kept his counsel and went his way
 And swindled the cartmen of half their pay

     

 And the months went on as the worst must do
 And the Boh returned to the raid anew

 But the Captain had quitted the longdrawn strife
 And in far Simoorie had taken a wife

 And she was a damsel of delicate mould
 With hair like the sunshine and heart of gold

 And little she knew the arms that embraced
 Had cloven a man from the brow to the waist

 And little she knew that the loving lips
 Had ordered a quivering lifes eclipse

 And the eye that lit at her lightest breath
 Had glared unawed in the Gates of Death

 For these be matters a man would hide
 As a general rule from an innocent Bride

 And little the Captain thought of the past
 And of all men Babu Harendra last

     

 But slow in the sludge of the Kathun road
 The Government Bullock Train toted its load

 Speckless and spotless and shining with _ghee_
 In the rearmost cart sat the Babujee

 And ever a phantom before him fled
 Of a scowling Boh with a silver head

 Then the leadcart stuck though the coolies slaved
 And the cartmen flogged and the escort raved

 And out of the jungle with yells and squeals
 Pranced Boh Da Thone and his gang at his heels

 Then belching blunderbuss answered back
 The Sniders snarl and the carbines crack

 And the blithe revolver began to sing
 To the blade that twanged on the lockingring

 And the brown flesh blued where the baynet kissed
 As the steel shot back with a wrench and a twist

 And the great white bullocks with onyx eyes
 Watched the souls of the dead arise

 And over the smoke of the fusillade
 The Peacock Banner staggered and swayed

 Oh gayest of scrimmages man may see
 Is a wellworked rush on the GBT

 The Babu shook at the horrible sight
 And girded his ponderous loins for flight

 But Fate had ordained that the Boh should start
 On a lonehand raid of the rearmost cart

 And out of that cart with a bellow of woe
 The Babu fell  flat on the top of the Boh

 For years had Harendra served the State
 To the growth of his purse and the girth of his _pet_

 There were twenty stone as the tallyman knows
 On the broad of the chest of this best of Bohs

 And twenty stone from a height discharged
 Are bad for a Boh with a spleen enlarged

 Oh short was the struggle  severe was the shock 
 He dropped like a bullock  he lay like a block

 And the Babu above him convulsed with fear
 Heard the labouring lifebreath hissed out in his ear

 And thus in a fashion undignified
 The princely pest of the Chindwin died

     

 Turn now to Simoorie where lapped in his ease
 The Captain is petting the Bride on his knees

 Where the _whit_ of the bullet the wounded mans scream
 Are mixed as the mist of some devilish dream 

 Forgotten forgotten the sweat of the shambles
 Where the hilldaisy blooms and the gray monkey gambols

 From the swordbelt set free and released from the steel
 The Peace of the Lord is with Captain ONeil

     

 Up the hill to Simoorie  most patient of drudges 
 The bags on his shoulder the mailrunner trudges

 For Captain ONeil _Sahib_ One hundred and ten
 Rupees to collect on delivery
 Then

 Their breakfast was stopped while the screwjack and hammer
 Tore waxcloth split teakwood and chipped out the dammer

 Openeyed openmouthed on the naperys snow
 With a crash and a thud rolled  the Head of the Boh

 And gummed to the scalp was a letter which ran 
 IN FIELDING FORCE SERVICE
 _Encampment_
 10th Jan

 Dear Sir  I have honour to send _as you said_
 For final approval see under Bohs Head

 Was took by myself in most bloody affair
 By High Education brought pressure to bear

 Now violate Liberty time being bad
 To mail VPP rupees hundred Please add

 Whatever Your Honour can pass Price of Blood
 Much cheap at one hundred and children want food

 So trusting Your Honour will somewhat retain
 True love and affection for Govt Bullock Train

 And show awful kindness to satisfy me
 I am
 Graceful Master
 Your
 H MUKERJI

     

 As the rabbit is drawn to the rattlesnakes power
 As the smokers eye fills at the opium hour

 As a horse reaches up to the manger above
 As the waiting ear yearns for the whisper of love

 From the arms of the Bride ironvisaged and slow
 The Captain bent down to the Head of the Boh

 And een as he looked on the Thing where It lay
 Twixt the winking new spoons and the napkins array

 The freed mind fled back to the longago days 
 The handtohand scuffle  the smoke and the blaze 

 The forced march at night and the quick rush at dawn 
 The banjo at twilight the burial ere morn 

 The stench of the marshes  the raw piercing smell
 When the overhand stabbingcut silenced the yell 

 The oaths of his Irish that surged when they stood
 Where the black crosses hung oer the Kuttamow flood

 As a derelict ship drifts away with the tide
 The Captain went out on the Past from his Bride

 Back back through the springs to the chill of the year
 When he hunted the Boh from Maloon to Tsaleer

 As the shape of a corpse dimmers up through deep water
 In his eye lit the passionless passion of slaughter

 And men who had fought with ONeil for the life
 Had gazed on his face with less dread than his wife

 For she who had held him so long could not hold him 
 Though a fourmonth Eternity should have controlled him 

 But watched the twin Terror  the head turned to head 
 The scowling scarred Black and the flushed savage Red 

 The spirit that changed from her knowing and flew to
 Some grim hidden Past she had never a clue to

 But It knew as It grinned for he touched it unfearing
 And muttered aloud So you kept that jade earring

 Then nodded and kindly as friend nods to friend
 Old man you fought well but you lost in the end

     

 The visions departed and Shame followed Passion 
 He took what I said in this horrible fashion

 _Ill_ write to Harendra With language unsainted
 The Captain came back to the Bride  who had fainted

     

 And this is a fiction No Go to Simoorie
 And look at their baby a twelvemonth old Houri

 A pert little Irisheyed Kathleen Mavournin 
 Shes always about on the Mall of a mornin 

 And youll see if her right shoulderstrap is displaced
 This _Gules_ upon _argent_ a Bohs Head _erased_





THE LAMENT OF THE BORDER CATTLE THIEF


 O woe is me for the merry life
 I led beyond the Bar
 And a treble woe for my winsome wife
 That weeps at Shalimar

 They have taken away my long jezail
 My shield and sabre fine
 And heaved me into the Central jail
 For lifting of the kine

 The steer may low within the byre
 The Jat may tend his grain
 But therell be neither loot nor fire
 Till I come back again

 And God have mercy on the Jat
 When once my fetters fall
 And Heaven defend the farmers hut
 When I am loosed from thrall

 Its woe to bend the stubborn back
 Above the grinching quern
 Its woe to hear the legbar clack
 And jingle when I turn

 But for the sorrow and the shame
 The brand on me and mine
 Ill pay you back in leaping flame
 And loss of the butchered kine

 For every cow I spared before
 In charity set free
 If I may reach my hold once more
 Ill reive an honest three

 For every time I raised the low
 That scared the dusty plain
 By sword and cord by torch and tow
 Ill light the land with twain

 Ride hard ride hard to Abazai
 Young _Sahib_ with the yellow hair 
 Lie close lie close as khuttucks lie
 Fat herds below Bonair

 The one Ill shoot at twilighttide
 At dawn Ill drive the other
 The black shall mourn for hoof and hide
 The white man for his brother

 Tis war red war Ill give you then
 War till my sinews fail
 For the wrong you have done to a chief of men
 And a thief of the Zukka Kheyl

 And if I fall to your hand afresh
 I give you leave for the sin
 That you cram my throat with the foul pigs flesh
 And swing me in the skin




THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS


 _This ballad appears to refer to one of the exploits of the notorious
 Paul Jones the American pirate It is founded on fact_


    At the close of a winter day
 Their anchors down by London town the Three Great Captains lay
 And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye
 And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby
 And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall
 And he was Captain of the Fleet  the bravest of them all
 Their good guns guarded their great gray sides
 that were thirty foot in the sheer
 When there came a certain tradingbrig with news of a privateer
 Her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a Northern breeze
 Her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the Eastern seas
 Light she rode in the rude tiderip to left and right she rolled
 And the skipper sat on the scuttlebutt and stared at an empty hold
 I ha paid Port dues for your Law quoth he and where is the Law ye boast
 If I sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a Christian coast
 Ye have smoked the hives of the Laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk
 We tack not now to a Gallang prow or a plunging Peiho junk
 I had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare
 Till I met with a limewashed Yankee brig that rode off Finisterre
 There were canvas blinds to his bowgun ports to screen the weight he bore
 And the signals ran for a merchantman from Sandy Hook to the Nore
 He would not fly the Rovers flag  the bloody or the black
 But now he floated the Gridiron and now he flaunted the Jack
 He spoke of the Law as he crimped my crew  he swore it was only a loan
 But when I would ask for my own again he swore it was none of my own
 He has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the Line
 He has stripped my rails of the shaddockfrails and the green unripened pine
 He has taken my bale of dammer and spice I won beyond the seas
 He has taken my grinning heathen gods  and what should he want o these
 My foremast would not mend his boom my deckhouse patch his boats
 He has whittled the two this Yank Yahoo to peddle for shoepeg oats
 I could not fight for the failing light and a rough beamsea beside
 But I hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied
 Had I had guns as I had goods to work my Christian harm
 I had run him up from his quarterdeck to trade with his own yardarm
 I had nailed his ears to my capstanhead and ripped them off with a saw
 And soused them in the bilgewater and served them to him raw
 I had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark
 I had towed him aft of his own craft a bait for his brother shark
 I had lapped him round with cocoa husk and drenched him with the oil
 And lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil
 I had stripped his hide for my hammockside
 and tasselled his beard i the mesh
 And spitted his crew on the live bamboo
 that grows through the gangrened flesh
 I had hove him down by the mangroves brown
 where the mudreef sucks and draws
 Moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the landcrabs claws
 He is lazar within and lime without ye can nose him far enow
 For he carries the taint of a musky ship  the reek of the slavers dhow
 The skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold
 And the Captains Three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold
 And the Captains Three called courteously from deck to scuttlebutt 
 Good Sir we ha dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut
 Your words be words of a lawless race and the Law it standeth thus
 He comes of a race that have never a Law and he never has boarded us
 We ha sold him canvas and rope and spar  we know that his price is fair
 And we know that he weeps for the lack of a Law as he rides off Finisterre
 And since he is damned for a gallowsthief by you and better than you
 We hold it meet that the English fleet should know that we hold him true
 The skipper called to the tall taffrail  And what is that to me
 Did ever you hear of a Yankee brig that rifled a Seventythree
 Do I loom so large from your quarterdeck that I lift like a ship o the Line
 He has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine
 There is never a Law on the Cocos Keys to hold a white man in
 But we do not steal the niggers meal for that is a niggers sin
 Must he have his Law as a quid to chaw or laid in brass on his wheel
 Does he steal with tears when he buccaneers
 Fore Gad then why does he steal
 The skipper bit on a deepsea word and the word it was not sweet
 For he could see the Captains Three had signalled to the Fleet
 But three and two in white and blue the whimpering flags began 
 We have heard a tale of a  foreign sail but he is a merchantman
 The skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the Great Horn Spoon 
 Fore Gad the Chaplain of the Fleet would bless my picaroon
 By two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air 
 We have sold our spars to the merchantman  we know that his price is fair
 The skipper winked his Western eye and swore by a China storm 
 They ha rigged him a Josephs jurycoat to keep his honour warm
 The halliards twanged against the tops the bunting bellied broad
 The skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord
 Masthead  masthead the signal sped by the line o the British craft
 The skipper called to his Lascar crew and put her about and laughed 
 Its mainsail haul my bully boys all  well out to the seas again 
 Ere they set us to paint their pirate saint or scrub at his grapnelchain
 Its foresheet free with her head to the sea
 and the swing of the unbought brine 
 Well make no sport in an English court till we come as a ship o the Line
 Till we come as a ship o the Line my lads of thirty foot in the sheer
 Lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer
 Flying his pluck at our mizzentruck for weft of Admiralty
 Heaving his head for our dipseylead in sign that we keep the sea
 Then foresheet home as she lifts to the foam  we stand on the outward tack
 We are paid in the coin of the white mans trade 
 the bezant is hard ay and black
 The frigatebird shall carry my word to the Kling and the OrangLaut
 How a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a Christian port
 How a man may be robbed in Christian port while Three Great Captains there
 Shall dip their flag to a slavers rag  to show that his trade is fair




THE BALLAD OF THE CLAMPHERDOWN


 It was our warship _Clampherdown_
 Would sweep the Channel clean
 Wherefore she kept her hatches close
 When the merry Channel chops arose
 To save the bleached marine

 She had one bowgun of a hundred ton
 And a great sterngun beside
 They dipped their noses deep in the sea
 They racked their stays and stanchions free
 In the wash of the windwhipped tide

 It was our warship _Clampherdown_
 Fell in with a cruiser light
 That carried the dainty Hotchkiss gun
 And a pair o heels wherewith to run
 From the grip of a closefought fight

 She opened fire at seven miles 
 As ye shoot at a bobbing cork 
 And once she fired and twice she fired
 Till the bowgun drooped like a lily tired
 That lolls upon the stalk

 Captain the bowgun melts apace
 The deckbeams break below
 Twere well to rest for an hour or twain
 And botch the shattered plates again
 And he answered Make it so

 She opened fire within the mile 
 As ye shoot at the flying duck 
 And the great sterngun shot fair and true
 With the heave of the ship to the stainless blue
 And the great sternturret stuck

 Captain the turret fills with steam
 The feedpipes burst below 
 You can hear the hiss of the helpless ram
 You can hear the twisted runners jam
 And he answered Turn and go

 It was our warship _Clampherdown_
 And grimly did she roll
 Swung round to take the cruisers fire
 As the White Whale faces the Threshers ire
 When they war by the frozen Pole

 Captain the shells are falling fast
 And faster still fall we
 And it is not meet for English stock
 To bide in the heart of an eightday clock
 The death they cannot see

 Lie down lie down my bold AB
 We drift upon her beam
 We dare not ram for she can run
 And dare ye fire another gun
 And die in the peeling steam

 It was our warship _Clampherdown_
 That carried an armourbelt
 But fifty feet at stern and bow
 Lay bare as the paunch of the pursers sow
 To the hail of the _Nordenfeldt_

 Captain they hack us through and through
 The chilled steel bolts are swift
 We have emptied the bunkers in open sea
 Their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be
 And he answered Let her drift

 It was our warship _Clampherdown_
 Swung round upon the tide
 Her two dumb guns glared south and north
 And the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth
 And she ground the cruisers side

 Captain they cry the fight is done
 They bid you send your sword
 And he answered Grapple her stern and bow
 They have asked for the steel They shall have it now
 Out cutlasses and board

 It was our warship _Clampherdown_
 Spewed up four hundred men
 And the scalded stokers yelped delight
 As they rolled in the waist and heard the fight
 Stamp oer their steelwalled pen

 They cleared the cruiser end to end
 From conningtower to hold
 They fought as they fought in Nelsons fleet
 They were stripped to the waist they were bare to the feet
 As it was in the days of old

 It was the sinking _Clampherdown_
 Heaved up her battered side 
 And carried a million pounds in steel
 To the cod and the corpsefed congereel
 And the scour of the Channel tide

 It was the crew of the _Clampherdown_
 Stood out to sweep the sea
 On a cruiser won from an ancient foe
 As it was in the days of long ago
 And as it still shall be




THE BALLAD OF THE BOLIVAR


 Seven men from all the world back to Docks again
 Rolling down the Ratcliffe Road drunk and raising Cain
 Give the girls another drink fore we sign away 
 We that took the _Bolivar_ out across the Bay

 We put out from Sunderland loaded down with rails
 We put back to Sunderland cause our cargo shifted
 We put out from Sunderland  met the winter gales 
 Seven days and seven nights to the Start we drifted
 Racketing her rivets loose smokestack white as snow
 All the coals adrift adeck half the rails below
 Leaking like a lobsterpot steering like a dray 
 Out we took the _Bolivar_ out across the Bay

 One by one the Lights came up winked and let us by
 Mile by mile we waddled on coal and focsle short
 Met a blow that laid us down heard a bulkhead fly
 Left the _Wolf_ behind us with a twofoot list to port
 Trailing like a wounded duck working out her soul
 Clanging like a smithyshop after every roll
 Just a funnel and a mast lurching through the spray 
 So we threshed the _Bolivar_ out across the Bay

 Felt her hog and felt her sag betted when shed break
 Wondered every time she raced if shed stand the shock
 Heard the seas like drunken men pounding at her strake
 Hoped the Lord ud keep his thumb on the plummerblock
 Banged against the iron decks bilges choked with coal
 Flayed and frozen foot and hand sick of heart and soul
 Last we prayed shed buck herself into judgment Day 
 Hi we cursed the _Bolivar_ knocking round the Bay

 O her nose flung up to sky groaning to be still 
 Up and down and back we went never time for breath
 Then the money paid at Lloyds caught her by the heel
 And the stars ran round and round dancin at our death
 Aching for an hours sleep dozing off between
 Heard the rotten rivets draw when she took it green
 Watched the compass chase its tail like a cat at play 
 That was on the _Bolivar_ south across the Bay

 Once we saw between the squalls lyin head to swell 
 Mad with work and weariness wishin they was we 
 Some damned Liners lights go by like a long hotel
 Cheered her from the _Bolivar_ swampin in the sea
 Then a grayback cleared us out then the skipper laughed
 Boys the wheel has gone to Hell  rig the winches aft
 Yoke the kicking rudderhead  get her under way
 So we steered her pulleyhaul out across the Bay

 Just a pack o rotten plates puttied up with tar
 In we came an time enough cross Bilbao Bar
 Overloaded undermanned meant to founder we
 Euchred God Almightys storm bluffed the Eternal Sea

 Seven men from all the world back to town again
 Rollin down the Ratcliffe Road drunk and raising Cain
 Seven men from out of Hell Aint the owners gay
 Cause we took the Bolivar safe across the Bay




THE SACRIFICE OF ERHEB


 ErHeb beyond the Hills of AoSafai
 Bears witness to the truth and AoSafai
 Hath told the men of Gorukh Thence the tale
 Comes westward oer the peaks to India

 The story of Bisesa Armods child 
 A maiden plighted to the Chief in War
 The Man of Sixty Spears who held the Pass
 That leads to Thibet but today is gone
 To seek his comfort of the God called Budh
 The Silent  showing how the Sickness ceased
 Because of her who died to save the tribe

 Taman is One and greater than us all
 Taman is One and greater than all Gods
 Taman is Two in One and rides the sky
 Curved like a stallions croup from dusk to dawn
 And drums upon it with his heels whereby
 Is bred the neighing thunder in the hills

 This is Taman the God of all ErHeb
 Who was before all Gods and made all Gods
 And presently will break the Gods he made
 And step upon the Earth to govern men
 Who give him milkdry ewes and cheat his Priests
 Or leave his shrine unlighted  as ErHeb
 Left it unlighted and forgot Taman
 When all the Valley followed after Kysh
 And Yabosh little Gods but very wise
 And from the sky Taman beheld their sin

 He sent the Sickness out upon the hills
 The Red Horse Sickness with the iron hooves
 To turn the Valley to Taman again

 And the Red Horse snuffed thrice into the wind
 The naked wind that had no fear of him
 And the Red Horse stamped thrice upon the snow
 The naked snow that had no fear of him
 And the Red Horse went out across the rocks
 The ringing rocks that had no fear of him
 And downward where the lean birch meets the snow
 And downward where the gray pine meets the birch
 And downward where the dwarf oak meets the pine
 Till at his feet our cuplike pastures lay

 That night the slow mists of the evening dropped
 Dropped as a cloth upon a dead mans face
 And weltered in the Valley bluishwhite
 Like water very silent  spread abroad
 Like water very silent from the Shrine
 Unlighted of Taman to where the stream
 Is dammed to fill our cattletroughs  sent up
 White waves that rocked and heaved and then were still
 Till all the Valley glittered like a marsh
 Beneath the moonlight filled with sluggish mist
 Kneedeep so that men waded as they walked

 That night the Red Horse grazed above the Dam
 Beyond the cattletroughs Men heard him feed
 And those that heard him sickened where they lay

 Thus came the Sickness to ErHeb and slew
 Ten men strong men and of the women four
 And the Red Horse went hillward with the dawn
 But near the cattletroughs his hoofprints lay

 That night the slow mists of the evening dropped
 Dropped as a cloth upon the dead but rose
 A little higher to a young girls height
 Till all the Valley glittered like a lake
 Beneath the moonlight filled with sluggish mist

 That night the Red Horse grazed beyond the Dam
 A stonesthrow from the troughs Men heard him feed
 And those that heard him sickened where they lay
 Thus came the Sickness to ErHeb and slew
 Of men a score and of the women eight
 And of the children two

 Because the road
 To Gorukh was a road of enemies
 And AoSafai was blocked with early snow
 We could not flee from out the Valley Death
 Smote at us in a slaughterpen and Kysh
 Was mute as Yabosh though the goats were slain
 And the Red Horse grazed nightly by the stream
 And later outward towards the Unlighted Shrine
 And those that heard him sickened where they lay

 Then said Bisesa to the Priests at dusk
 When the white mist rose up breasthigh and choked
 The voices in the houses of the dead 
 Yabosh and Kysh avail not If the Horse
 Reach the Unlighted Shrine we surely die
 Ye have forgotten of all Gods the Chief
 Taman Here rolled the thunder through the Hills
 And Yabosh shook upon his pedestal
 Ye have forgotten of all Gods the Chief
 Too long And all were dumb save one who cried
 On Yabosh with the Sapphire twixt His knees
 But found no answer in the smoky roof
 And being smitten of the Sickness died
 Before the altar of the Sapphire Shrine

 Then said Bisesa  I am near to Death
 And have the Wisdom of the Grave for gift
 To bear me on the path my feet must tread
 If there be wealth on earth then I am rich
 For Armod is the first of all ErHeb
 If there be beauty on the earth  her eyes
 Dropped for a moment to the temple floor 
 Ye know that I am fair If there be love
 Ye know that love is mine The Chief in War
 The Man of Sixty Spears broke from the press
 And would have clasped her but the Priests withstood
 Saying  She has a message from Taman
 Then said Bisesa  By my wealth and love
 And beauty I am chosen of the God
 Taman Here rolled the thunder through the Hills
 And Kysh fell forward on the Mound of Skulls

 In darkness and before our Priests the maid
 Between the altars cast her bracelets down
 Therewith the heavy earrings Armod made
 When he was young out of the watergold
 Of Gorukh  threw the breastplate thick with jade
 Upon the turquoise anklets  put aside
 The bands of silver on her brow and neck
 And as the trinkets tinkled on the stones
 The thunder of Taman lowed like a bull

 Then said Bisesa stretching out her hands
 As one in darkness fearing Devils  Help
 O Priests I am a woman very weak
 And who am I to know the will of Gods
 Taman hath called me  whither shall I go
 The Chief in War the Man of Sixty Spears
 Howled in his torment fettered by the Priests
 But dared not come to her to drag her forth
 And dared not lift his spear against the Priests
 Then all men wept

 There was a Priest of Kysh
 Bent with a hundred winters hairless blind
 And taloned as the great SnowEagle is
 His seat was nearest to the altarfires
 And he was counted dumb among the Priests
 But whether Kysh decreed or from Taman
 The impotent tongue found utterance we know
 As little as the bats beneath the eaves
 He cried so that they heard who stood without 
 To the Unlighted Shrine and crept aside
 Into the shadow of his fallen God
 And whimpered and Bisesa went her way

 That night the slow mists of the evening dropped
 Dropped as a cloth upon the dead and rose
 Above the roofs and by the Unlighted Shrine
 Lay as the slimy water of the troughs
 When murrain thins the cattle of ErHeb
 And through the mist men heard the Red Horse feed

 In Armods house they burned Bisesas dower
 And killed her black bull Tor and broke her wheel
 And loosed her hair as for the marriagefeast
 With cries more loud than mourning for the dead

 Across the fields from Armods dwellingplace
 We heard Bisesa weeping where she passed
 To seek the Unlighted Shrine the Red Horse neighed
 And followed her and on the rivermint
 His hooves struck dead and heavy in our ears

 Out of the mists of evening as the star
 Of AoSafai climbs through the black snowblur
 To show the Pass is clear Bisesa stepped
 Upon the great gray slope of mortised stone
 The Causeway of Taman The Red Horse neighed
 Behind her to the Unlighted Shrine  then fled
 North to the Mountain where his stable lies

 They know who dared the anger of Taman
 And watched that night above the clinging mists
 Far up the hill Bisesas passing in

 She set her hand upon the carven door
 Fouled by a myriad bats and black with time
 Whereon is graved the Glory of Taman
 In letters older than the AoSafai
 And twice she turned aside and twice she wept
 Cast down upon the threshold clamouring
 For him she loved  the Man of Sixty Spears
 And for her father  and the black bull Tor
 Hers and her pride Yea twice she turned away
 Before the awful darkness of the door
 And the great horror of the Wall of Man
 Where Man is made the plaything of Taman
 An Eyeless Face that waits above and laughs

 But the third time she cried and put her palms
 Against the hewn stone leaves and prayed Taman
 To spare ErHeb and take her life for price

 They know who watched the doors were rent apart
 And closed upon Bisesa and the rain
 Broke like a flood across the Valley washed
 The mist away but louder than the rain
 The thunder of Taman filled men with fear

 Some say that from the Unlighted Shrine she cried
 For succour very pitifully thrice
 And others that she sang and had no fear
 And some that there was neither song nor cry
 But only thunder and the lashing rain

 Howbeit in the morning men rose up
 Perplexed with horror crowding to the Shrine
 And when ErHeb was gathered at the doors
 The Priests made lamentation and passed in
 To a strange Temple and a God they feared
 But knew not

 From the crevices the grass
 Had thrust the altarslabs apart the walls
 Were gray with stains unclean the roofbeams swelled
 With manycoloured growth of rottenness
 And lichen veiled the Image of Taman
 In leprosy The Basin of the Blood
 Above the altar held the morning sun
 A winking ruby on its heart below
 Face hid in hands the maid Bisesa lay

 ErHeb beyond the Hills of AoSafai
 Bears witness to the truth and AoSafai
 Hath told the men of Gorukh Thence the tale
 Comes westward oer the peaks to India




THE EXPLANATION


 Love and Death once ceased their strife
 At the Tavern of Mans Life
 Called for wine and threw  alas 
 Each his quiver on the grass
 When the bout was oer they found
 Mingled arrows strewed the ground
 Hastily they gathered then
 Each the loves and lives of men
 Ah the fateful dawn deceived
 Mingled arrows each one sheaved
 Deaths dread armoury was stored
 With the shafts he most abhorred
 Loves light quiver groaned beneath
 Venomheaded darts of Death

 Thus it was they wrought our woe
 At the Tavern long ago
 Tell me do our masters know
 Loosing blindly as they fly
 Old men love while young men die




THE GIFT OF THE SEA


 The dead child lay in the shroud
 And the widow watched beside
 And her mother slept and the Channel swept
 The gale in the teeth of the tide

 But the mother laughed at all
 I have lost my man in the sea
 And the child is dead Be still she said
 What more can ye do to me

 The widow watched the dead
 And the candle guttered low
 And she tried to sing the Passing Song
 That bids the poor soul go

 And Mary take you now she sang
 That lay against my heart
 And Mary smooth your crib tonight
 But she could not say Depart

 Then came a cry from the sea
 But the searime blinded the glass
 And Heard ye nothing mother she said
 Tis the child that waits to pass

 And the nodding mother sighed
 Tis a lambing ewe in the whin
 For why should the christened soul cry out
 That never knew of sin

 O feet I have held in my hand
 O hands at my heart to catch
 How should they know the road to go
 And how should they lift the latch

 They laid a sheet to the door
 With the little quilt atop
 That it might not hurt from the cold or the dirt
 But the crying would not stop

 The widow lifted the latch
 And strained her eyes to see
 And opened the door on the bitter shore
 To let the soul go free

 There was neither glimmer nor ghost
 There was neither spirit nor spark
 And Heard ye nothing mother she said
 Tis crying for me in the dark

 And the nodding mother sighed
 Tis sorrow makes ye dull
 Have ye yet to learn the cry of the tern
 Or the wail of the windblown gull

 The terns are blown inland
 The gray gull follows the plough
 Twas never a bird the voice I heard
 O mother I hear it now

 Lie still dear lamb lie still
 The child is passed from harm
 Tis the ache in your breast that broke your rest
 And the feel of an empty arm

 She put her mother aside
 In Marys name let be
 For the peace of my soul I must go she said
 And she went to the calling sea

 In the heel of the windbit pier
 Where the twisted weed was piled
 She came to the life she had missed by an hour
 For she came to a little child

 She laid it into her breast
 And back to her mother she came
 But it would not feed and it would not heed
 Though she gave it her own childs name

 And the dead child dripped on her breast
 And her own in the shroud lay stark
 And God forgive us mother she said
 We let it die in the dark




EVARRA AND HIS GODS


 _Read here
 This is the story of Evarra  man 
 Maker of Gods in lands beyond the sea_
 Because the city gave him of her gold
 Because the caravans brought turquoises
 Because his life was sheltered by the King
 So that no man should maim him none should steal
 Or break his rest with babble in the streets
 When he was weary after toil he made
 An image of his God in gold and pearl
 With turquoise diadem and human eyes
 A wonder in the sunshine known afar
 And worshipped by the King but drunk with pride
 Because the city bowed to him for God
 He wrote above the shrine _Thus Gods are made
 And whoso makes them otherwise shall die_
 And all the city praised him    Then he died

 _Read here the story of Evarra  man 
 Maker of Gods in lands beyond the sea_
 Because the city had no wealth to give
 Because the caravans were spoiled afar
 Because his life was threatened by the King
 So that all men despised him in the streets
 He hewed the living rock with sweat and tears
 And reared a God against the morninggold
 A terror in the sunshine seen afar
 And worshipped by the King but drunk with pride
 Because the city fawned to bring him back
 He carved upon the plinth _Thus Gods are made
 And whoso makes them otherwise shall die_
 And all the people praised him    Then he died

 _Read here the story of Evarra  man 
 Maker of Gods in lands beyond the sea_
 Because he lived among a simple folk
 Because his village was between the hills
 Because he smeared his cheeks with blood of ewes
 He cut an idol from a fallen pine
 Smeared blood upon its cheeks and wedged a shell
 Above its brows for eyes and gave it hair
 Of trailing moss and plaited straw for crown
 And all the village praised him for this craft
 And brought him butter honey milk and curds
 Wherefore because the shoutings drove him mad
 He scratched upon that log _Thus Gods are made
 And whoso makes them otherwise shall die_
 And all the people praised him    Then he died

 _Read here the story of Evarra  man 
 Maker of Gods in lands beyond the sea_
 Because his God decreed one clot of blood
 Should swerve one hairsbreadth from the pulses path
 And chafe his brain Evarra mowed alone
 Ragwrapped among the cattle in the fields
 Counting his fingers jesting with the trees
 And mocking at the mist until his God
 Drove him to labour Out of dung and horns
 Dropped in the mire he made a monstrous God
 Abhorrent shapeless crowned with plantain tufts
 And when the cattle lowed at twilighttime
 He dreamed it was the clamour of lost crowds
 And howled among the beasts _Thus Gods are made
 And whoso makes them otherwise shall die_
 Thereat the cattle bellowed    Then he died

 Yet at the last he came to Paradise
 And found his own four Gods and that he wrote
 And marvelled being very near to God
 What oaf on earth had made his toil Gods law
 Till God said mocking Mock not These be thine
 Then cried Evarra I have sinned  Not so
 If thou hadst written otherwise thy Gods
 Had rested in the mountain and the mine
 And I were poorer by four wondrous Gods
 And thy more wondrous law Evarra Thine
 Servant of shouting crowds and lowing kine
 Thereat with laughing mouth but tearwet eyes
 Evarra cast his Gods from Paradise

 _This is the story of Evarra  man 
 Maker of Gods in lands beyond the sea_




THE CONUNDRUM OF THE WORKSHOPS


 When the flush of a newborn sun fell first on Edens green and gold
 Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched with a stick in the mould
 And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart
 Till the Devil whispered behind the leaves Its pretty but is it Art

 Wherefore he called to his wife and fled to fashion his work anew 
 The first of his race who cared a fig for the first most dread review
 And he left his lore to the use of his sons  and that was a glorious gain
 When the Devil chuckled Is it Art in the ear of the branded Cain

 They fought and they talked in the North and the South
 they talked and they fought in the West
 Till the waters rose on the pitiful land and the poor Red Clay had rest 
 Had rest till that dank blankcanvas dawn when the dove was preened to start
 And the Devil bubbled below the keel Its human but is it Art

 They builded a tower to shiver the sky and wrench the stars apart
 Till the Devil grunted behind the bricks Its striking but is it Art
 The stone was dropped at the quarryside and the idle derrick swung
 While each man talked of the aims of Art and each in an alien tongue

 The tale is as old as the Eden Tree  and new as the newcut tooth 
 For each man knows ere his lipthatch grows he is master of Art and Truth
 And each man hears as the twilight nears to the beat of his dying heart
 The Devil drum on the darkened pane You did it but was it Art

 We have learned to whittle the Eden Tree to the shape of a surplicepeg
 We have learned to bottle our parents twain in the yelk of an addled egg
 We know that the tail must wag the dog for the horse is drawn by the cart
 But the Devil whoops as he whooped of old Its clever but is it Art

 When the flicker of London sun falls faint on the Clubrooms green and gold
 The sons of Adam sit them down and scratch with their pens in the mould 
 They scratch with their pens in the mould of their graves
 and the ink and the anguish start
 For the Devil mutters behind the leaves Its pretty but is it Art

 Now if we could win to the Eden Tree where the Four Great Rivers flow
 And the Wreath of Eve is red on the turf as she left it long ago
 And if we could come when the sentry slept and softly scurry through
 By the favour of God we might know as much  as our father Adam knew




THE LEGEND OF EVIL


 I

 This is the sorrowful story
 Told when the twilight fails
 And the monkeys walk together
 Holding their neighbours tails 

 Our fathers lived in the forest
 Foolish people were they
 They went down to the cornland
 To teach the farmers to play

 Our fathers frisked in the millet
 Our fathers skipped in the wheat
 Our fathers hung from the branches
 Our fathers danced in the street

 Then came the terrible farmers
 Nothing of play they knew
 Only  they caught our fathers
 And set them to labour too

 Set them to work in the cornland
 With ploughs and sickles and flails
 Put them in mudwalled prisons
 And  cut off their beautiful tails

 Now we can watch our fathers
 Sullen and bowed and old
 Stooping over the millet
 Sharing the silly mould

 Driving a foolish furrow
 Mending a muddy yoke
 Sleeping in mudwalled prisons
 Steeping their food in smoke

 We may not speak to our fathers
 For if the farmers knew
 They would come up to the forest
 And set us to labour too

 This is the horrible story
 Told as the twilight fails
 And the monkeys walk together
 Holding their kinsmens tails


 II

 Twas when the rain fell steady an the Ark was pitched an ready
 That Noah got his orders for to take the bastes below
 He dragged them all together by the horn an hide an feather
 An all excipt the Donkey was agreeable to go

 Thin Noah spoke him fairly thin talked to him sevarely
 An thin he cursed him squarely to the glory av the Lord 
 Divil take the ass that bred you and the greater ass that fed you 
 Divil go wid you ye spalpeen an the Donkey went aboard

 But the wind was always failin an twas most onaisy sailin
 An the ladies in the cabin couldnt stand the stable air
 An the bastes betwuxt the hatches they tuk an died in batches
 Till Noah said  Theres wan av us that hasnt paid his fare

 For he heard a flusteration mid the bastes av all creation 
 The trumpetin av elephints an bellowin av whales
 An he saw forninst the windy whin he wint to stop the shindy
 The Divil wid a stablefork bedivillin their tails

 The Divil cursed outrageous but Noah said umbrageous 
 To what am I indebted for this tenantright invasion
 An the Divil gave for answer  Evict me if you can sir
 For I came in wid the Donkey  on Your Honours invitation




THE ENGLISH FLAG



 _Above the portico a flagstaff bearing the Union Jack
 remained fluttering in the flames for some time but ultimately
 when it fell the crowds rent the air with shouts
 and seemed to see significance in the incident  DAILY PAPERS_


 Winds of the World give answer They are whimpering to and fro 
 And what should they know of England who only England know 
 The poor little streetbred people that vapour and fume and brag
 They are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the English Flag

 Must we borrow a clout from the Boer  to plaster anew with dirt
 An Irish liars bandage or an English cowards shirt
 We may not speak of England her Flags to sell or share
 What is the Flag of England Winds of the World declare

 The North Wind blew  From Bergen my steelshod vanguards go
 I chase your lazy whalers home from the Disko floe
 By the great North Lights above me I work the will of God
 And the liner splits on the icefield or the Dogger fills with cod

 I barred my gates with iron I shuttered my doors with flame
 Because to force my ramparts your nutshell navies came
 I took the sun from their presence I cut them down with my blast
 And they died but the Flag of England blew free ere the spirit passed

 The lean white bear hath seen it in the long long Arctic night
 The muskox knows the standard that flouts the Northern Light
 What is the Flag of England Ye have but my bergs to dare
 Ye have but my drifts to conquer Go forth for it is there

 The South Wind sighed  From the Virgins my midsea course was taen
 Over a thousand islands lost in an idle main
 Where the seaegg flames on the coral and the longbacked breakers croon
 Their endless ocean legends to the lazy locked lagoon

 Strayed amid lonely islets mazed amid outer keys
 I waked the palms to laughter  I tossed the scud in the breeze 
 Never was isle so little never was sea so lone
 But over the scud and the palmtrees an English flag was flown

 I have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the Horn
 I have chased it north to the Lizard  ribboned and rolled and torn
 I have spread its fold oer the dying adrift in a hopeless sea
 I have hurled it swift on the slaver and seen the slave set free

 My basking sunfish know it and wheeling albatross
 Where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the Southern Cross
 What is the Flag of England Ye have but my reefs to dare
 Ye have but my seas to furrow Go forth for it is there

 The East Wind roared  From the Kuriles the Bitter Seas I come
 And me men call the HomeWind for I bring the English home
 Look  look well to your shipping By the breath of my mad typhoon
 I swept your closepacked Praya and beached your best at Kowloon

 The reeling junks behind me and the racing seas before
 I raped your richest roadstead  I plundered Singapore
 I set my hand on the Hoogli as a hooded snake she rose
 And I flung your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows

 Never the lotus closes never the wildfowl wake
 But a soul goes out on the East Wind that died for Englands sake 
 Man or woman or suckling mother or bride or maid 
 Because on the bones of the English the English Flag is stayed

 The desertdust hath dimmed it the flying wildass knows
 The scared white leopard winds it across the taintless snows
 What is the Flag of England Ye have but my sun to dare
 Ye have but my sands to travel Go forth for it is there

 The West Wind called  In squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly
 That bear the wheat and cattle lest streetbred people die
 They make my might their porter they make my house their path
 Till I loose my neck from their rudder and whelm them all in my wrath

 I draw the gliding fogbank as a snake is drawn from the hole
 They bellow one to the other the frighted shipbells toll
 For day is a drifting terror till I raise the shroud with my breath
 And they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death

 But whether in calm or wrackwreath whether by dark or day
 I heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away
 First of the scattered legions under a shrieking sky
 Dipping between the rollers the English Flag goes by

 The dead dumb fog hath wrapped it  the frozen dews have kissed 
 The naked stars have seen it a fellowstar in the mist
 What is the Flag of England Ye have but my breath to dare
 Ye have but my waves to conquer Go forth for it is there




CLEARED

 In Memory of a Commission


 Help for a patriot distressed a spotless spirit hurt
 Help for an honourable clan sore trampled in the dirt
 From Queenstown Bay to Donegal O listen to my song
 The honourable gentlemen have suffered grievous wrong

 Their noble names were mentioned  O the burning black disgrace 
 By a brutal Saxon paper in an Irish shootingcase
 They sat upon it for a year then steeled their heart to brave it
 And coruscating innocence the learned Judges gave it

 Bear witness Heaven of that grim crime beneath the surgeons knife
 The honourable gentlemen deplored the loss of life
 Bear witness of those chanting choirs that burk and shirk and snigger
 No man laid hand upon the knife or finger to the trigger

 Cleared in the face of all mankind beneath the winking skies
 Like phoenixes from Phoenix Park and what lay there they rise
 Go shout it to the emerald seas  give word to Erin now
 Her honourable gentlemen are cleared  and this is how 

 They only paid the Moonlighter his cattlehocking price
 They only helped the murderer with counsels best advice
 But  sure it keeps their honour white  the learned Court believes
 They never gave a piece of plate to murderers and thieves

 They never told the ramping crowd to card a womans hide
 They never marked a man for death  what fault of theirs he died 
 They only said intimidate and talked and went away 
 By God the boys that did the work were braver men than they

 Their sin it was that fed the fire  small blame to them that heard 
 The bhoys get drunk on rhetoric and madden at a word 
 They knew whom they were talking at if they were Irish too
 The gentlemen that lied in Court they knew and well they knew

 They only took the Judasgold from Fenians out of jail
 They only fawned for dollars on the blooddyed ClannaGael
 If black is black or white is white in black and white its down
 Theyre only traitors to the Queen and rebels to the Crown

 Cleared honourable gentlemen Be thankful its no more 
 The widows curse is on your house the dead are at your door
 On you the shame of open shame on you from North to South
 The hand of every honest man flatheeled across your mouth

 Less black than we were painted  Faith no word of black was said
 The lightest touch was human blood and that you know runs red
 Its sticking to your fist today for all your sneer and scoff
 And by the Judges wellweighed word you cannot wipe it off

 Hold up those hands of innocence  go scare your sheep together
 The blundering tripping tups that bleat behind the old bellwether
 And if they snuff the taint and break to find another pen
 Tell them its tar that glistens so and daub them yours again

 The charge is old  As old as Cain  as fresh as yesterday
 Old as the Ten Commandments  have ye talked those laws away
 If words are words or death is death or powder sends the ball
 You spoke the words that sped the shot  the curse be on you all

 Our friends believe  Of course they do  as sheltered women may
 But have they seen the shrieking soul ripped from the quivering clay
 They  If their own front door is shut
 theyll swear the whole worlds warm
 What do they know of dread of death or hanging fear of harm

 The secret half a county keeps the whisper in the lane
 The shriek that tells the shot went home behind the broken pane
 The dry blood crisping in the sun that scares the honest bees
 And shows the bhoys have heard your talk  what do they know of these

 But you  you know  ay ten times more the secrets of the dead
 Black terror on the countryside by word and whisper bred
 The mangled stallions scream at night the tailcropped heifers low
 Who set the whisper going first You know and well you know

 My soul Id sooner lie in jail for murder plain and straight
 Pure crime Id done with my own hand for money lust or hate
 Than take a seat in Parliament by fellowfelons cheered
 While one of those not provens proved me cleared as you are cleared

 Cleared  you that lost the League accounts  go guard our honour still
 Go help to make our countrys laws that broke Gods law at will 
 One hand stuck out behind the back to signal strike again
 The other on your dressshirtfront to show your heart is clane

 If black is black or white is white in black and white its down
 Youre only traitors to the Queen and rebels to the Crown
 If print is print or words are words the learned Court perpends 
 We are not ruled by murderers but only  by their friends




AN IMPERIAL RESCRIPT


 Now this is the tale of the Council the German Kaiser decreed
 To ease the strong of their burden to help the weak in their need
 He sent a word to the peoples who struggle and pant and sweat
 That the straw might be counted fairly and the tally of bricks be set

 The Lords of Their Hands assembled from the East and the West they drew 
 Baltimore Lille and Essen Brummagem Clyde and Crewe
 And some were black from the furnace and some were brown from the soil
 And some were blue from the dyevat but all were wearied of toil

 And the young King said  I have found it the road to the rest ye seek
 The strong shall wait for the weary the hale shall halt for the weak
 With the even tramp of an army where no man breaks from the line
 Ye shall march to peace and plenty in the bond of brotherhood  sign

 The paper lay on the table the strong heads bowed thereby
 And a wail went up from the peoples  Ay sign  give rest for we die
 A hand was stretched to the goosequill a fist was cramped to scrawl
 When  the laugh of a blueeyed maiden ran clear through the councilhall

 And each one heard Her laughing as each one saw Her plain 
 Saidie Mimi or Olga Gretchen or Mary Jane
 And the Spirit of Man that is in Him to the light of the vision woke
 And the men drew back from the paper as a Yankee delegate spoke 

 Theres a girl in Jersey City who works on the telephone
 Were going to hitch our horses and dig for a house of our own
 With gas and water connections and steamheat through to the top
 And W Hohenzollern I guess I shall work till I drop

 And an English delegate thundered  The weak an the lame be blowed
 Ive a berth in the SouWest workshops a home in the Wandsworth Road
 And till the sociation has footed my buryin bill
 I work for the kids an the missus Pull up I be damned if I will

 And over the German benches the bearded whisper ran 
 Lager der girls und der dollars dey makes or dey breaks a man
 If Schmitt haf collared der dollars he collars der girl deremit
 But if Schmitt bust in der pizness we collars der girl from Schmitt

 They passed one resolution  Your subcommittee believe
 You can lighten the curse of Adam when youve lightened the curse of Eve
 But till we are built like angels with hammer and chisel and pen
 We will work for ourself and a woman for ever and ever amen

 Now this is the tale of the Council the German Kaiser held 
 The day that they razored the Grindstone the day that the Cat was belled
 The day of the Figs from Thistles the day of the Twisted Sands
 The day that the laugh of a maiden made light of the Lords of Their Hands




TOMLINSON


 Now Tomlinson gave up the ghost in his house in Berkeley Square
 And a Spirit came to his bedside and gripped him by the hair 
 A Spirit gripped him by the hair and carried him far away
 Till he heard as the roar of a rainfed ford the roar of the Milky Way
 Till he heard the roar of the Milky Way die down and drone and cease
 And they came to the Gate within the Wall where Peter holds the keys
 Stand up stand up now Tomlinson and answer loud and high
 The good that ye did for the sake of men or ever ye came to die 
 The good that ye did for the sake of men in little earth so lone
 And the naked soul of Tomlinson grew white as a rainwashed bone
 O I have a friend on earth he said that was my priest and guide
 And well would he answer all for me if he were by my side
  For that ye strove in neighbourlove it shall be written fair
 But now ye wait at Heavens Gate and not in Berkeley Square
 Though we called your friend from his bed this night
 he could not speak for you
 For the race is run by one and one and never by two and two
 Then Tomlinson looked up and down and little gain was there
 For the naked stars grinned overhead and he saw that his soul was bare
 The Wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife
 And Tomlinson took up his tale and spoke of his good in life
 This I have read in a book he said and that was told to me
 And this I have thought that another man thought of a Prince in Muscovy
 The good souls flocked like homing doves and bade him clear the path
 And Peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrath
 Ye have read ye have heard ye have thought he said
 and the tale is yet to run
 By the worth of the body that once ye had give answer  what ha ye done
 Then Tomlinson looked back and forth and little good it bore
 For the Darkness stayed at his shoulderblade and Heavens Gate before 
 O this I have felt and this I have guessed and this I have heard men say
 And this they wrote that another man wrote of a carl in Norroway
  Ye have read ye have felt ye have guessed good lack
 Ye have hampered Heavens Gate
 Theres little room between the stars in idleness to prate
 O none may reach by hired speech of neighbour priest and kin
 Through borrowed deed to Gods good meed that lies so fair within
 Get hence get hence to the Lord of Wrong for doom has yet to run
 And  the faith that ye share with Berkeley Square uphold you Tomlinson

     

 The Spirit gripped him by the hair and sun by sun they fell
 Till they came to the belt of Naughty Stars that rim the mouth of Hell
 The first are red with pride and wrath the next are white with pain
 But the third are black with clinkered sin that cannot burn again
 They may hold their path they may leave their path
 with never a soul to mark
 They may burn or freeze but they must not cease
 in the Scorn of the Outer Dark
 The Wind that blows between the worlds it nipped him to the bone
 And he yearned to the flare of HellGate
 there as the light of his own hearthstone
 The Devil he sat behind the bars where the desperate legions drew
 But he caught the hasting Tomlinson and would not let him through
 Wot ye the price of good pitcoal that I must pay said he
 That ye rank yoursel so fit for Hell and ask no leave of me
 I am all oersib to Adams breed that ye should give me scorn
 For I strove with God for your First Father the day that he was born
 Sit down sit down upon the slag and answer loud and high
 The harm that ye did to the Sons of Men or ever you came to die
 And Tomlinson looked up and up and saw against the night
 The belly of a tortured star bloodred in HellMouth light
 And Tomlinson looked down and down and saw beneath his feet
 The frontlet of a tortured star milkwhite in HellMouth heat
 O I had a love on earth said he that kissed me to my fall
 And if ye would call my love to me I know she would answer all
  All that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fair
 But now ye wait at HellMouth Gate and not in Berkeley Square
 Though we whistled your love from her bed tonight I trow she would not run
 For the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one
 The Wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife
 And Tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life 
 Once I ha laughed at the power of Love and twice at the grip of the Grave
 And thrice I ha patted my God on the head that men might call me brave
 The Devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool 
 Do ye think I would waste my good pitcoal on the hide of a brainsick fool
 I see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye did
 That I should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a grid
 Then Tomlinson looked back and forth and there was little grace
 For HellGate filled the houseless Soul with the Fear of Naked Space
 Nay this I ha heard quo Tomlinson and this was noised abroad
 And this I ha got from a Belgian book on the word of a dead French lord
  Ye ha heard ye ha read ye ha got good lack
 and the tale begins afresh 
 Have ye sinned one sin for the pride o the eye
 or the sinful lust of the flesh
 Then Tomlinson he gripped the bars and yammered Let me in 
 For I mind that I borrowed my neighbours wife to sin the deadly sin
 The Devil he grinned behind the bars and banked the fires high
 Did ye read of that sin in a book said he and Tomlinson said Ay
 The Devil he blew upon his nails and the little devils ran
 And he said Go husk this whimpering thief that comes in the guise of a man
 Winnow him out twixt star and star and sieve his proper worth
 Theres sore decline in Adams line if this be spawn of earth
 Empusas crew so nakednew they may not face the fire
 But weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desire
 Over the coal they chased the Soul and racked it all abroad
 As children rifle a caddiscase or the ravens foolish hoard
 And back they came with the tattered Thing as children after play
 And they said The soul that he got from God he has bartered clean away
 We have threshed a stook of print and book and winnowed a chattering wind
 And many a soul wherefrom he stole but his we cannot find
 We have handled him we have dandled him we have seared him to the bone
 And sure if tooth and nail show truth he has no soul of his own
 The Devil he bowed his head on his breast and rumbled deep and low 
 Im all oersib to Adams breed that I should bid him go
 Yet close we lie and deep we lie and if I gave him place
 My gentlemen that are so proud would flout me to my face
 Theyd call my house a common stews and me a careless host
 And  I would not anger my gentlemen for the sake of a shiftless ghost
 The Devil he looked at the mangled Soul that prayed to feel the flame
 And he thought of Holy Charity but he thought of his own good name 
 Now ye could haste my coal to waste and sit ye down to fry
 Did ye think of that theft for yourself said he and Tomlinson said Ay
 The Devil he blew an outward breath for his heart was free from care 
 Ye have scarce the soul of a louse he said
 but the roots of sin are there
 And for that sin should ye come in were I the lord alone
 But sinful pride has rule inside  and mightier than my own
 Honour and Wit foredamned they sit to each his priest and whore
 Nay scarce I dare myself go there and you theyd torture sore
 Ye are neither spirit nor spirk he said ye are neither book nor brute 
 Go get ye back to the flesh again for the sake of Mans repute
 Im all oersib to Adams breed that I should mock your pain
 But look that ye win to worthier sin ere ye come back again
 Get hence the hearse is at your door  the grim black stallions wait 
 They bear your clay to place today Speed lest ye come too late
 Go back to Earth with a lip unsealed  go back with an open eye
 And carry my word to the Sons of Men or ever ye come to die
 That the sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one 
 And  the God that you took from a printed book be with you Tomlinson




LENVOI TO LIFES HANDICAP


 My newcut ashlar takes the light
 Where crimsonblank the windows flare
 By my own work before the night
 Great Overseer I make my prayer

 If there be good in that I wrought
 Thy hand compelled it Master Thine
 Where I have failed to meet Thy thought
 I know through Thee the blame is mine

 One instants toil to Thee denied
 Stands all Eternitys offence
 Of that I did with Thee to guide
 To Thee through Thee be excellence

 Who lest all thought of Eden fade
 Bringst Eden to the craftsmans brain
 Godlike to muse oer his own trade
 And Manlike stand with God again

 The depth and dream of my desire
 The bitter paths wherein I stray
 Thou knowest Who hast made the Fire
 Thou knowest Who hast made the Clay

 One stone the more swings to her place
 In that dread Temple of Thy Worth 
 It is enough that through Thy grace
 I saw naught common on Thy earth

 Take not that vision from my ken
 Oh whatsoeer may spoil or speed
 Help me to need no aid from men
 That I may help such men as need




LENVOI


 Theres a whisper down the field where the year has shot her yield
 And the ricks stand gray to the sun
 Singing  Over then come over for the bee has quit the clover
 And your English summers done
 You have heard the beat of the offshore wind
 And the thresh of the deepsea rain
 You have heard the song  how long how long
 Pull out on the trail again

 Ha done with the Tents of Shem dear lass
 Weve seen the seasons through
 And its time to turn on the old trail our own trail the out trail
 Pull out pull out on the Long Trail  the trail that is always new

 Its North you may run to the rimeringed sun
 Or South to the blind Horns hate
 Or East all the way into Mississippi Bay
 Or West to the Golden Gate
 Where the blindest bluffs hold good dear lass
 And the wildest tales are true
 And the men bulk big on the old trail our own trail the out trail
 And life runs large on the Long Trail  the trail that is always new

 The days are sick and cold and the skies are gray and old
 And the twicebreathed airs blow damp
 And Id sell my tired soul for the bucking beamsea roll
 Of a black Bilbao tramp
 With her loadline over her hatch dear lass
 And a drunken Dago crew
 And her nose held down on the old trail our own trail the out trail
 From Cadiz Bar on the Long Trail  the trail that is always new

 There be triple ways to take of the eagle or the snake
 Or the way of a man with a maid
 But the fairest way to me is a ships upon the sea
 In the heel of the NorthEast Trade
 Can you hear the crash on her bows dear lass
 And the drum of the racing screw
 As she ships it green on the old trail our own trail the out trail
 As she lifts and scends on the Long Trail 
 the trail that is always new

 See the shaking funnels roar with the Peter at the fore
 And the fenders grind and heave
 And the derricks clack and grate as the tackle hooks the crate
 And the fallrope whines through the sheave
 Its Gangplank up and in dear lass
 Its Hawsers warp her through
 And its All clear aft on the old trail our own trail the out trail
 Were backing down on the Long Trail  the trail that is always new

 O the mutter overside when the portfog holds us tied
 And the sirens hoot their dread
 When foot by foot we creep oer the hueless viewless deep
 To the sob of the questing lead
 Its down by the Lower Hope dear lass
 With the Gunfleet Sands in view
 Till the Mouse swings green on the old trail
 our own trail the out trail
 And the Gull Light lifts on the Long Trail 
 the trail that is always new

 O the blazing tropic night when the wakes a welt of light
 That holds the hot sky tame
 And the steady forefoot snores through the planetpowdered floors
 Where the scared whale flukes in flame
 Her plates are scarred by the sun dear lass
 And her ropes are taut with the dew
 For were booming down on the old trail our own trail the out trail
 Were sagging south on the Long Trail  the trail that is always new

 Then home get her home where the drunken rollers comb
 And the shouting seas drive by
 And the engines stamp and ring and the wet bows reel and swing
 And the Southern Cross rides high
 Yes the old lost stars wheel back dear lass
 That blaze in the velvet blue
 Theyre all old friends on the old trail our own trail the out trail
 Theyre Gods own guides on the Long Trail 
 the trail that is always new

 Fly forward O my heart from the Foreland to the Start 
 Were steaming alltoo slow
 And its twenty thousand mile to our little lazy isle
 Where the trumpetorchids blow
 You have heard the call of the offshore wind
 And the voice of the deepsea rain
 You have heard the song  how long how long
 Pull out on the trail again

 The Lord knows what we may find dear lass
 And The Deuce knows what we may do 
 But were back once more on the old trail our own trail the out trail
 Were down hull down on the Long Trail  the trail that is always new

DEDICATION

To the City of Bombay


 The Cities are full of pride
 Challenging each to each 
 This from her mountainside
 That from her burthened beach

 They count their ships full tale 
 Their corn and oil and wine
 Derrick and loom and bale
 And ramparts gunflecked line
 City by City they hail
 Hast aught to match with mine

 And the men that breed from them
 They traffic up and down
 But cling to their cities hem
 As a child to their mothers gown

 When they talk with the stranger bands
 Dazed and newly alone
 When they walk in the stranger lands
 By roaring streets unknown
 Blessing her where she stands
 For strength above their own

 On high to hold her fame
 That stands all fame beyond
 By oath to back the same
 Most faithfulfoolishfond
 Making her merebreathed name
 Their bond upon their bond

 So thank I God my birth
 Fell not in isles aside 
 Waste headlands of the earth
 Or warring tribes untried 
 But that she lent me worth
 And gave me right to pride

 Surely in toil or fray
 Under an alien sky
 Comfort it is to say
 Of no mean city am I

 Neither by service nor fee
 Come I to mine estate 
 Mother of Cities to me
 For I was born in her gate
 Between the palms and the sea
 Where the worldend steamers wait

 Now for this debt I owe
 And for her farborne cheer
 Must I make haste and go
 With tribute to her pier

 And she shall touch and remit
 After the use of kings
 Orderly ancient fit
 My deepsea plunderings
 And purchase in all lands
 And this we do for a sign
 Her power is over mine
 And mine I hold at her hands




THE SEVEN SEAS




A SONG OF THE ENGLISH


 Fair is our lot  O goodly is our heritage
 Humble ye my people and be fearful in your mirth
 For the Lord our God Most High
 He hath made the deep as dry
 He hath smote for us a pathway to the ends of all the Earth

 Yea though we sinned  and our rulers went from righteousness 
 Deep in all dishonour though we stained our garments hem
 Oh be ye not dismayed
 Though we stumbled and we strayed
 We were led by evil counsellors  the Lord shall deal with them

 Hold ye the Faith  the Faith our Fathers sealed us
 Whoring not with visions  overwise and overstale
 Except ye pay the Lord
 Single heart and single sword
 Of your children in their bondage shall He ask them trebletale

 Keep ye the Law  be swift in all obedience 
 Clear the land of evil drive the road and bridge the ford
 Make ye sure to each his own
 That he reap where he hath sown
 By the peace among Our peoples let men know we serve the Lord

     

 Hear now a song  a song of broken interludes 
 A song of little cunning of a singer nothing worth
 Through the naked words and mean
 May ye see the truth between
 As the singer knew and touched it in the ends of all the Earth



The Coastwise Lights


 Our brows are bound with spindrift and the weed is on our knees
 Our loins are battered neath us by the swinging smoking seas
 From reef and rock and skerry  over headland ness and voe 
 The Coastwise Lights of England watch the ships of England go

 Through the endless summer evenings on the lineless level floors
 Through the yelling Channel tempest when the siren hoots and roars 
 By day the dipping houseflag and by night the rockets trail 
 As the sheep that graze behind us so we know them where they hail

 We bridge across the dark and bid the helmsman have a care
 The flash that wheeling inland wakes his sleeping wife to prayer
 From our vexed eyries head to gale we bind in burning chains
 The lover from the searim drawn  his love in English lanes

 We greet the clippers wingandwing that race the Southern wool
 We warn the crawling cargotanks of Bremen Leith and Hull
 To each and all our equal lamp at peril of the sea 
 The white wallsided warships or the whalers of Dundee

 Come up come in from Eastward from the guardports of the Morn
 Beat up beat in from Southerly O gipsies of the Horn
 Swift shuttles of an Empires loom that weave us main to main
 The Coastwise Lights of England give you welcome back again

 Go get you gone upChannel with the seacrust on your plates
 Go get you into London with the burden of your freights
 Haste for they talk of Empire there and say if any seek
 The Lights of England sent you and by silence shall ye speak



The Song of the Dead


 Hear now the Song of the Dead  in the North by the torn bergedges 
 They that look still to the Pole asleep by their hidestripped sledges
 Song of the Dead in the South  in the sun by their skeleton horses
 Where the warrigal whimpers and bays through the dust
 of the sear rivercourses

 Song of the Dead in the East  in the heatrotted jungle hollows
 Where the dogape barks in the kloof 
 in the brake of the buffalowallows
 Song of the Dead in the West 
 in the Barrens the waste that betrayed them
 Where the wolverene tumbles their packs
 from the camp and the gravemound they made them
 Hear now the Song of the Dead


 I

 We were dreamers dreaming greatly in the manstifled town
 We yearned beyond the skyline where the strange roads go down
 Came the Whisper came the Vision came the Power with the Need
 Till the Soul that is not mans soul was lent us to lead
 As the deer breaks  as the steer breaks  from the herd where they graze
 In the faith of little children we went on our ways
 Then the wood failed  then the food failed  then the last water dried 
 In the faith of little children we lay down and died
 On the sanddrift  on the veldtside  in the fernscrub we lay
 That our sons might follow after by the bones on the way
 Follow after  follow after We have watered the root
 And the bud has come to blossom that ripens for fruit
 Follow after  we are waiting by the trails that we lost
 For the sounds of many footsteps for the tread of a host
 Follow after  follow after  for the harvest is sown
 By the bones about the wayside ye shall come to your own

 When Drake went down to the Horn
 And England was crowned thereby
 Twixt seas unsailed and shores unhailed
 Our Lodge  our Lodge was born
 And England was crowned thereby

 Which never shall close again
 By day nor yet by night
 While man shall take his life to stake
 At risk of shoal or main
 By day nor yet by night

 But standeth even so
 As now we witness here
 While men depart of joyful heart
 Adventure for to know
 As now bear witness here


 II

 We have fed our sea for a thousand years
 And she calls us still unfed
 Though theres never a wave of all her waves
 But marks our English dead
 We have strawed our best to the weeds unrest
 To the shark and the sheering gull
 If blood be the price of admiralty
 Lord God we ha paid in full

 Theres never a flood goes shoreward now
 But lifts a keel we manned
 Theres never an ebb goes seaward now
 But drops our dead on the sand 
 But slinks our dead on the sands forlore
 From the Ducies to the Swin
 If blood be the price of admiralty
 If blood be the price of admiralty
 Lord God we ha paid it in

 We must feed our sea for a thousand years
 For that is our doom and pride
 As it was when they sailed with the _Golden Hind_
 Or the wreck that struck last tide 
 Or the wreck that lies on the spouting reef
 Where the ghastly bluelights flare
 If blood be the price of admiralty
 If blood be the price of admiralty
 If blood be the price of admiralty
 Lord God we ha bought it fair



The DeepSea Cables


 The wrecks dissolve above us their dust drops down from afar 
 Down to the dark to the utter dark where the blind white seasnakes are
 There is no sound no echo of sound in the deserts of the deep
 Or the great gray level plains of ooze where the shellburred cables creep

 Here in the womb of the world  here on the tieribs of earth
 Words and the words of men flicker and flutter and beat 
 Warning sorrow and gain salutation and mirth 
 For a Power troubles the Still that has neither voice nor feet

 They have wakened the timeless Things they have killed their father Time
 Joining hands in the gloom a league from the last of the sun
 Hush Men talk today oer the waste of the ultimate slime
 And a new Word runs between whispering Let us be one



The Song of the Sons


 One from the ends of the earth  gifts at an open door 
 Treason has much but we Mother thy sons have more
 From the whine of a dying man from the snarl of a wolfpack freed
 Turn and the world is thine Mother be proud of thy seed
 Count are we feeble or few Hear is our speech so rude
 Look are we poor in the land Judge are we men of The Blood

 Those that have stayed at thy knees Mother go call them in 
 We that were bred overseas wait and would speak with our kin
 Not in the dark do we fight  haggle and flout and gibe
 Selling our love for a price loaning our hearts for a bribe
 Gifts have we only today  Love without promise or fee 
 Hear for thy children speak from the uttermost parts of the sea



The Song of the Cities


 BOMBAY

 Royal and Dowerroyal I the Queen
 Fronting thy richest sea with richer hands 
 A thousand mills roar through me where I glean
 All races from all lands


 CALCUTTA

 Me the Seacaptain loved the River built
 Wealth sought and Kings adventured life to hold
 Hail England I am Asia  Power on silt
 Death in my hands but Gold


 MADRAS

 Clive kissed me on the mouth and eyes and brow
 Wonderful kisses so that I became
 Crowned above Queens  a withered beldame now
 Brooding on ancient fame


 RANGOON

 Hail Mother Do they call me rich in trade
 Little care I but hear the shorn priest drone
 And watch my silkclad lovers man by maid
 Laugh neath my Shwe Dagon


 SINGAPORE

 Hail Mother East and West must seek my aid
 Ere the spent gear may dare the ports afar
 The second doorway of the wide worlds trade
 Is mine to loose or bar


 HONGKONG

 Hail Mother Hold me fast my Praya sleeps
 Under innumerable keels today
 Yet guard and landward or tomorrow sweeps
 Thy warships down the bay


 HALIFAX

 Into the mist my guardian prows put forth
 Behind the mist my virgin ramparts lie
 The Warden of the Honour of the North
 Sleepless and veiled am I


 QUEBEC AND MONTREAL

 Peace is our portion Yet a whisper rose
 Foolish and causeless half in jest half hate
 Now wake we and remember mighty blows
 And fearing no man wait


 VICTORIA

 From East to West the circling word has passed
 Till West is East beside our landlocked blue
 From East to West the tested chain holds fast
 The wellforged link rings true


 CAPE TOWN

 Hail Snatched and bartered oft from hand to hand
 I dream my dream by rock and heath and pine
 Of Empire to the northward Ay one land
 From Lions Head to Line


 MELBOURNE

 Greeting Nor fear nor favour won us place
 Got between greed of gold and dread of drouth
 Loudvoiced and reckless as the wild tiderace
 That whips our harbourmouth


 SYDNEY

 Greeting My birthstain have I turned to good
 Forcing strong wills perverse to steadfastness
 The first flush of the tropics in my blood
 And at my feet Success


 BRISBANE

 The northern stirp beneath the southern skies 
 I build a Nation for an Empires need
 Suffer a little and my land shall rise
 Queen over lands indeed


 HOBART

 Mans love first found me mans hate made me Hell
 For my babes sake I cleansed those infamies
 Earnest for leave to live and labour well
 God flung me peace and ease


 AUCKLAND

 Last loneliest loveliest exquisite apart 
 On us on us the unswerving season smiles
 Who wonder mid our fern why men depart
 To seek the Happy Isles



Englands Answer


 Truly ye come of The Blood slower to bless than to ban
 Little used to lie down at the bidding of any man
 Flesh of the flesh that I bred bone of the bone that I bare
 Stark as your sons shall be  stern as your fathers were
 Deeper than speech our love stronger than life our tether
 But we do not fall on the neck nor kiss when we come together
 My arm is nothing weak my strength is not gone by
 Sons I have borne many sons but my dugs are not dry
 Look I have made ye a place and opened wide the doors
 That ye may talk together your Barons and Councillors 
 Wards of the Outer March Lords of the Lower Seas
 Ay talk to your gray mother that bore you on her knees 
 That ye may talk together brother to brothers face 
 Thus for the good of your peoples  thus for the Pride of the Race
 Also we will make promise So long as The Blood endures
 I shall know that your good is mine ye shall feel that my strength is yours
 In the day of Armageddon at the last great fight of all
 That Our House stand together and the pillars do not fall
 Draw now the threefold knot firm on the ninefold bands
 And the Law that ye make shall be law after the rule of your lands
 This for the waxen Heath and that for the Wattlebloom
 This for the Mapleleaf and that for the southern Broom
 The Law that ye make shall be law and I do not press my will
 Because ye are Sons of The Blood and call me Mother still
 Now must ye speak to your kinsmen and they must speak to you
 After the use of the English in straightflung words and few
 Go to your work and be strong halting not in your ways
 Balking the end halfwon for an instant dole of praise
 Stand to your work and be wise  certain of sword and pen
 Who are neither children nor Gods but men in a world of men




THE FIRST CHANTEY



 Mine was the woman to me darkling I found her
 Haling her dumb from the camp took her and bound her
 Hot rose her tribe on our track ere I had proved her
 Hearing her laugh in the gloom greatly I loved her

 Swift through the forest we ran none stood to guard us
 Few were my people and far then the flood barred us 
 Him we call Son of the Sea sullen and swollen
 Panting we waited the death stealer and stolen

 Yet ere they came to my lance laid for the slaughter
 Lightly she leaped to a log lapped in the water
 Holding on high and apart skins that arrayed her
 Called she the God of the Wind that He should aid her

 Life had the tree at that word Praise we the Giver
 Otterlike left he the bank for the full river
 Far fell their axes behind flashing and ringing
 Wonder was on me and fear  yet she was singing

 Low lay the land we had left Now the blue bound us
 Even the Floor of the Gods level around us
 Whisper there was not nor word shadow nor showing
 Till the light stirred on the deep glowing and growing

 Then did He leap to His place flaring from under
 He the Compeller the Sun bared to our wonder
 Nay not a league from our eyes blinded with gazing
 Cleared He the gate of the world huge and amazing

 This we beheld and we live  the Pit of the Burning
 Then the God spoke to the tree for our returning
 Back to the beach of our flight fearless and slowly
 Back to our slayers went he but we were holy

 Men that were hot in that hunt women that followed
 Babes that were promised our bones trembled and wallowed
 Over the necks of the Tribe crouching and fawning 
 Prophet and priestess we came back from the dawning




THE LAST CHANTEY

 _And there was no more sea_


 Thus said The Lord in the Vault above the Cherubim
 Calling to the Angels and the Souls in their degree
 Lo Earth has passed away
 On the smoke of Judgment Day
 That Our word may be established shall We gather up the sea

 Loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners
 Plague upon the hurricane that made us furl and flee
 But the war is done between us
 In the deep the Lord hath seen us 
 Our bones well leave the barracout and God may sink the sea

 Then said the soul of Judas that betrayed Him
 Lord hast Thou forgotten Thy covenant with me
 How once a year I go
 To cool me on the floe
 And Ye take my day of mercy if Ye take away the sea

 Then said the soul of the Angel of the Offshore Wind
 He that bits the thunder when the bullmouthed breakers flee
 I have watch and ward to keep
 Oer Thy wonders on the deep
 And Ye take mine honour from me if Ye take away the sea

 Loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners
 Nay but we were angry and a hasty folk are we
 If we worked the ship together
 Till she foundered in foul weather
 Are we babes that we should clamour for a vengeance on the sea

 Then said the souls of the slaves that men threw overboard
 Kennelled in the picaroon a weary band were we
 But Thy arm was strong to save
 And it touched us on the wave
 And we drowsed the long tides idle till Thy Trumpets tore the sea

 Then cried the soul of the stout Apostle Paul to God
 Once we frapped a ship and she laboured woundily
 There were fourteen score of these
 And they blessed Thee on their knees
 When they learned Thy Grace and Glory under Malta by the sea

 Loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners
 Plucking at their harps and they plucked unhandily
 Our thumbs are rough and tarred
 And the tune is something hard 
 May we lift a Deepsea Chantey such as seamen use at sea

 Then said the souls of the gentlemenadventurers 
 Fettered wrist to bar all for red iniquity
 Ho we revel in our chains
 Oer the sorrow that was Spains
 Heave or sink it leave or drink it we were masters of the sea

 Up spake the soul of a gray Gothavn speckshioner 
 He that led the flinching in the fleets of fair Dundee
 Oh the iceblink white and near
 And the bowhead breaching clear
 Will Ye whelm them all for wantonness that wallow in the sea

 Loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners
 Crying Under Heaven here is neither lead nor lee
 Must we sing for evermore
 On the windless glassy floor
 Take back your golden fiddles and well beat to open sea

 Then stooped the Lord and He called the good sea up to Him
 And stablished his borders unto all eternity
 That such as have no pleasure
 For to praise the Lord by measure
 They may enter into galleons and serve Him on the sea

 Sun wind and cloud shall fail not from the face of it
 Stinging ringing spindrift nor the fulmar flying free
 And the ships shall go abroad
 To the Glory of the Lord
 Who heard the silly sailorfolk and gave them back their sea




THE MERCHANTMEN


 King Solomon drew merchantmen
 Because of his desire
 For peacocks apes and ivory
 From Tarshish unto Tyre
 With cedars out of Lebanon
 Which Hiram rafted down
 But we be only sailormen
 That use in London Town

 _Coastwise  crossseas  round the world and back again 
 Where the flaw shall head us or the full Trade suits 
 Plainsail  stormsail  lay your board and tack again 
 And thats the way well pay Paddy Doyle for his boots_

 We bring no store of ingots
 Of spice or precious stones
 But that we have we gathered
 With sweat and aching bones
 In flame beneath the tropics
 In frost upon the floe
 And jeopardy of every wind
 That does between them go

 And some we got by purchase
 And some we had by trade
 And some we found by courtesy
 Of pike and carronade 
 At midnight midsea meetings
 For charity to keep
 And light the rolling homewardbound
 That rode a foot too deep

 By sport of bitter weather
 Were walty strained and scarred
 From the kentledge on the kelson
 To the slings upon the yard
 Six oceans had their will of us
 To carry all away 
 Our galleys in the Baltic
 And our booms in Mossel Bay

 Weve floundered off the Texel
 Awash with sodden deals
 Weve slipped from Valparaiso
 With the Norther at our heels
 Weve ratched beyond the Crossets
 That tusk the Southern Pole
 And dipped our gunnels under
 To the dread Agulhas roll

 Beyond all outer charting
 We sailed where none have sailed
 And saw the landlights burning
 On islands none have hailed
 Our hair stood up for wonder
 But when the night was done
 There danced the deep to windward
 Blueempty neath the sun

 Strange consorts rode beside us
 And brought us evil luck
 The witchfire climbed our channels
 And flared on vane and truck
 Till through the red tornado
 That lashed us nigh to blind
 We saw The Dutchman plunging
 Full canvas head to wind

 Weve heard the Midnight Leadsman
 That calls the black deep down 
 Ay thrice weve heard The Swimmer
 The Thing that may not drown
 On frozen bunt and gasket
 The sleetcloud drave her hosts
 When manned by more than signed with us
 We passed the Isle o Ghosts

 And north amid the hummocks
 A biscuittoss below
 We met the silent shallop
 That frighted whalers know
 For down a cruel icelane
 That opened as he sped
 We saw dead Henry Hudson
 Steer North by West his dead

 So dealt Gods waters with us
 Beneath the roaring skies
 So walked His signs and marvels
 All naked to our eyes
 But we were heading homeward
 With trade to lose or make 
 Good Lord they slipped behind us
 In the tailing of our wake

 Let go let go the anchors
 Now shamed at heart are we
 To bring so poor a cargo home
 That had for gift the sea
 Let go the great bowanchors 
 Ah fools were we and blind 
 The worst we stored with utter toil
 The best we left behind

 _Coastwise  crossseas  round the world and back again
 Whither flaw shall fail us or the Trades drive down
 Plainsail  stormsail  lay your board and tack again 
 And all to bring a cargo up to London Town_




MANDREWS HYMN


 Lord Thou hast made this world below the shadow of a dream
 An taught by time I tak it so  exceptin always Steam
 From couplerflange to spindleguide I see Thy Hand O God 
 Predestination in the stride o yon connectinrod
 John Calvin might ha forged the same  enorrmous certain slow 
 Ay wrought it in the furnaceflame  _my_ Institutio
 I cannot get my sleep tonight old bones are hard to please
 Ill stand the middle watch up here  alone wi God an these
 My engines after ninety days o race an rack an strain
 Through all the seas of all Thy world slambangin home again
 Slambang too much  they knock a wee  the crossheadgibs are loose
 But thirty thousand mile o sea has gied them fair excuse   
 Fine clear an dark  a fulldraught breeze wi Ushant out o sight
 An Ferguson relievin Hay Old girl yell walk tonight
 His wifes at Plymouth    Seventy 
 One  Two  Three since he began 
 Three turns for Mistress Ferguson  and whos to blame the man
 Theres none at any port for me by drivin fast or slow
 Since Elsie Campbell went to Thee Lord thirty years ago
 The year the _Sarah Sands_ was burned Oh roads we used to tread
 Fra Maryhill to Pollokshaws  fra Govan to Parkhead
 Not but theyre ceevil on the Board Yell hear Sir Kenneth say
 Goodmorrn MAndrew Back again An hows your bilge today
 Miscallin technicalities but handin me my chair
 To drink Madeira wi three Earls  the auld Fleet Engineer
 That started as a boilerwhelp  when steam and he were low
 I mind the time we used to serve a broken pipe wi tow
 Ten pound was all the pressure then  Eh Eh  a man wad drive
 An here our workin gauges give one hunder fiftyfive
 Were creepin on wi each new rig  less weight an larger power
 Therell be the locoboiler next an thirty knots an hour
 Thirty an more What I ha seen since oceansteam began
 Leaves me no doot for the machine but what about the man
 The man that counts wi all his runs one million mile o sea
 Four time the span from earth to moon    How far O Lord from Thee
 That wast beside him night an day Ye mind my first typhoon
 It scoughed the skipper on his way to jock wi the saloon
 Three feet were on the stokeholdfloor  just slappin to an fro 
 An cast me on a furnacedoor I have the marks to show
 Marks I ha marks o more than burns  deep in my soul an black
 An times like this when things go smooth my wickudness comes back
 The sins o four and forty years all up an down the seas
 Clack an repeat like valves halffed    Forgies our trespasses
 Nights when Id come on deck to mark wi envy in my gaze
 The couples kittlin in the dark between the funnel stays
 Years when I raked the ports wi pride to fill my cup o wrong 
 Judge not O Lord my steps aside at Gay Street in HongKong
 Blot out the wastrel hours of mine in sin when I abode 
 Jane Harrigans an Number Nine The Reddick an Grant Road
 An waur than all  my crownin sin  rank blasphemy an wild
 I was not four and twenty then  Ye wadna judge a child
 Id seen the Tropics first that run  new fruit new smells new air 
 How could I tell  blindfou wi sun  the Deil was lurkin there
 By day like playhousescenes the shore slid past our sleepy eyes
 By night those soft lasceevious stars leered from those velvet skies
 In port we used no cargosteam Id daunder down the streets 
 An ijjit grinnin in a dream  for shells an parrakeets
 An walkinsticks o carved bamboo an blowfish stuffed an dried 
 Fillin my bunk wi rubbishry the Chief put overside
 Till off Sambawa Head Ye mind I heard a landbreeze ca
 Milkwarm wi breath o spice an bloom MAndrew come awa
 Firm clear an low  no haste no hate  the ghostly whisper went
 Just statin eevidential facts beyon all argument
 Your mithers Gods a graspin deil the shadow o yoursel
 Got out o books by meenisters clean daft on Heaven an Hell
 They mak Him in the Broomielaw o Glasgie cold an dirt
 A jealous pridefu fetich lad thats only strong to hurt
 Yell not go back to Him again an kiss His redhot rod
 But come wi Us Now who were _They_ an know the Leevin God
 That does not kipper souls for sport or break a life in jest
 But swells the ripenin cocoanuts an ripes the womans breast
 An there it stopped cut off no more that quiet certain voice 
 For me six months o twentyfour to leave or take at choice
 Twas on me like a thunderclap  it racked me through an through 
 Temptation past the show o speech unnameable an new 
 The Sin against the Holy Ghost    An under all our screw
 That storm blew by but left behind her anchorshiftin swell
 Thou knowest all my heart an mind Thou knowest Lord I fell
 Third on the _Mary Gloster_ then and first that night in Hell
 Yet was Thy hand beneath my head about my feet Thy care 
 Fra Deli clear to Torres Strait the trial o despair
 But when we touched the Barrier Reef Thy answer to my prayer
 We dared not run that sea by night but lay an held our fire
 An I was drowsin on the hatch  sick  sick wi doubt an tire
 _Better the sight of eyes that see than wanderin o desire_
 Ye mind that word Clear as our gongs  again an once again
 When rippin down through coraltrash ran out our moorinchain
 An by Thy Grace I had the Light to see my duty plain
 Light on the engineroom  no more  bright as our carbons burn
 Ive lost it since a thousand times but never past return

     

 Obsairve Per annum well have here two thousand souls aboard 
 Think not I dare to justify myself before the Lord
 But  average fifteen hunder souls safeborne fra port to port 
 I _am_ o service to my kind Ye wadna blame the thought
 Maybe they steam from grace to wrath  to sin by folly led 
 It isna mine to judge their path  their lives are on my head
 Mine at the last  when all is done it all comes back to me
 The fault that leaves six thousand ton a log upon the sea
 Well tak one stretch  three weeks an odd by any road ye steer 
 Fra Cape Town east to Wellington  ye need an engineer
 Fail there  yeve time to weld your shaft  ay eat it ere yere spoke
 Or make Kerguelen under sail  three jiggers burned wi smoke
 An home again the Rio run its no childs play to go
 Steamin to bell for fourteen days o snow an floe an blow 
 The bergs like kelpies overside that girn an turn an shift
 Whaur grindin like the Mills o God goes by the big South drift
 Hail snow an ice that praise the Lord Ive met them at their work
 An wished we had anither route or they anither kirk
 Yons strain hard strain o head an hand for though Thy Power brings
 All skill to naught Yell understand a man must think o things
 Then at the last well get to port an hoist their baggage clear 
 The passengers wi gloves an canes  an this is what Ill hear
 Well thank ye for a pleasant voyage The tenders comin now
 While I go testin followerbolts an watch the skipper bow
 Theyve words for every one but me  shake hands wi half the crew
 Except the dour Scots engineer the man they never knew
 An yet I like the wark for all weve dam few pickins here 
 No pension an the most we earns four hunder pound a year
 Better myself abroad Maybe _Id_ sooner starve than sail
 Wi such as call a snifterrod _ross_  French for nightingale
 Commeesion on my stores Some do but I can not afford
 To lie like stewards wi pattypans  Im older than the Board
 A bonus on the coal I save Ou ay the Scots are close
 But when I grudge the strength Ye gave Ill grudge their food to _those_
 Theres bricks that I might recommend  an clink the firebars cruel
 No Welsh  Wangarti at the worst  an damn all patent fuel
 Inventions Ye must stay in port to mak a patent pay
 My Deeferential ValveGear taught me how that business lay
 I blame no chaps wi clearer head for aught they make or sell
 _I_ found that I could not invent an look to these  as well
 So wrestled wi Apollyon  Nah  fretted like a bairn 
 But burned the workinplans last run wi all I hoped to earn
 Ye know how hard an Idol dies an what that meant to me 
 Een tak it for a sacrifice acceptable to Thee   
 _Below there Oiler Whats your wark Ye find it runnin hard
 Ye neednt swill the cap wi oil  this isnt the Cunard
 Ye thought Ye are not paid to think Go sweat that off again_
 Tck Tck Its deeficult to sweer nor tak The Name in vain
 Men ay an women call me stern Wi these to oversee
 Yell note Ive little time to burn on social repartee
 The bairns see what their elders miss theyll hunt me to an fro
 Till for the sake of  well a kiss  I tak em down below
 That minds me of our Viscount loon  Sir Kenneths kin  the chap
 Wi Russia leather tennisshoon an spardecked yachtincap
 I showed him round last week oer all  an at the last says he
 Mister MAndrew dont you think steam spoils romance at sea
 Damned ijjit Id been doon that morn to see what ailed the throws
 Manholin on my back  the cranks three inches off my nose
 Romance Those firstclass passengers they like it very well
 Printed an bound in little books but why dont poets tell
 Im sick of all their quirks an turns  the loves an doves they dream 
 Lord send a man like Robbie Burns to sing the Song o Steam
 To match wi Scotias noblest speech yon orchestra sublime
 Whaurto  uplifted like the Just  the tailrods mark the time
 The crankthrows give the doublebass the feedpump sobs an heaves
 An now the main eccentrics start their quarrel on the sheaves
 Her time her own appointed time the rocking linkhead bides
 Till  hear that note  the rods return
 whings glimmerin through the guides
 Theyre all awa True beat full power the clangin chorus goes
 Clear to the tunnel where they sit my purrin dynamos
 Interdependence absolute foreseen ordained decreed
 To work Yell note at any tilt an every rate o speed
 Fra skylightlift to furnacebars backed bolted braced an stayed
 An singin like the Mornin Stars for joy that they are made
 While out o touch o vanity the sweatin thrustblock says
 Not unto us the praise or man  not unto us the praise
 Now a together hear them lift their lesson  theirs an mine
 Law Orrder Duty an Restraint Obedience Discipline
 Mill forge an trypit taught them that when roarin they arose
 An whiles I wonder if a soul was gied them wi the blows
 Oh for a man to weld it then in one triphammer strain
 Till even firstclass passengers could tell the meanin plain
 But no one cares except mysel that serve an understand
 My seven thousand horsepower here
 Eh Lord Theyre grand  theyre grand
 Uplift am I When first in store the newmade beasties stood
 Were Ye cast down that breathed the Word declarin all things good
 Not so O that warldliftin joy no afterfall could vex
 Yeve left a glimmer still to cheer the Man  the Arrtifex
 _That_ holds in spite o knock and scale o friction waste an slip
 An by that light  now mark my word  well build the Perfect Ship
 Ill never last to judge her lines or take her curve  not I
 But I ha lived an I ha worked Be thanks to Thee Most High
 An I ha done what I ha done  judge Thou if ill or well 
 Always Thy Grace preventin me   
 Losh Yons the Stand by bell
 Pilot so soon His flare it is The morninwatch is set
 Well God be thanked as I was sayin Im no Pelagian yet
 Now Ill tak on   
 _Morrn Ferguson Man have ye ever thought
 What your good leddy costs in coal    Ill burn em down to port_




THE MIRACLES


 I sent a message to my dear 
 A thousand leagues and more to Her 
 The dumb sealevels thrilled to hear
 And Lost Atlantis bore to Her

 Behind my message hard I came
 And nigh had found a grave for me
 But that I launched of steel and flame
 Did war against the wave for me

 Uprose the deep by gale on gale
 To bid me change my mind again 
 He broke his teeth along my rail
 And roaring swung behind again

 I stayed the sun at noon to tell
 My way across the waste of it
 I read the storm before it fell
 And made the better haste of it

 Afar I hailed the land at night 
 The towers I built had heard of me 
 And ere my rocket reached its height
 Had flashed my Love the word of me

 Earth sold her chosen men of strength
 They lived and strove and died for me
 To drive my road a nations length
 And toss the miles aside for me

 I snatched their toil to serve my needs 
 Too slow their fleetest flew for me 
 I tired twenty smoking steeds
 And bade them bait a new for me

 I sent the lightnings forth to see
 Where hour by hour She waited me
 Among ten million one was She
 And surely all men hated me

 Dawn ran to meet me at my goal 
 Ah day no tongue shall tell again
 And little folk of little soul
 Rose up to buy and sell again




THE NATIVEBORN


 Weve drunk to the Queen  God bless her 
 Weve drunk to our mothers land
 Weve drunk to our English brother
 But he does not understand
 Weve drunk to the wide creation
 And the Cross swings low for the morn
 Last toast and of obligation
 A health to the Nativeborn

 They change their skies above them
 But not their hearts that roam
 We learned from our wistful mothers
 To call old England home
 We read of the English skylark
 Of the spring in the English lanes
 But we screamed with the painted lories
 As we rode on the dusty plains

 They passed with their oldworld legends 
 Their tales of wrong and dearth 
 Our fathers held by purchase
 But we by the right of birth
 Our hearts where they rocked our cradle
 Our love where we spent our toil
 And our faith and our hope and our honour
 We pledge to our native soil

 I charge you charge your glasses 
 I charge you drink with me
 To the men of the Four New Nations
 And the Islands of the Sea 
 To the last least lump of coral
 That none may stand outside
 And our own good pride shall teach us
 To praise our comrades pride

 To the hush of the breathless morning
 On the thin tin crackling roofs
 To the haze of the burned backranges
 And the dust of the shoeless hoofs 
 To the risk of a death by drowning
 To the risk of a death by drouth 
 To the men of a million acres
 To the Sons of the Golden South

 To the Sons of the Golden South Stand up
 And the life we live and know
 Let a fellow sing o the little things he cares about
 If a fellow fights for the little things he cares about
 With the weight of a single blow

 To the smoke of a hundred coasters
 To the sheep on a thousand hills
 To the sun that never blisters
 To the rain that never chills 
 To the land of the waiting springtime
 To our fivemeal meatfed men
 To the tall deepbosomed women
 And the children nine and ten

 And the children nine and ten Stand up
 And the life we live and know
 Let a fellow sing o the little things he cares about
 If a fellow fights for the little things he cares about
 With the weight of a twofold blow

 To the farflung fenceless prairie
 Where the quick cloudshadows trail
 To our neighbours barn in the offing
 And the line of the newcut rail
 To the plough in her leaguelong furrow
 With the gray Lake gulls behind 
 To the weight of a halfyears winter
 And the warm wet western wind

 To the home of the floods and thunder
 To her pale dry healing blue 
 To the lift of the great Cape combers
 And the smell of the baked Karroo
 To the growl of the sluicing stamphead 
 To the reef and the watergold
 To the last and the largest Empire
 To the map that is half unrolled

 To our dear dark fostermothers
 To the heathen songs they sung 
 To the heathen speech we babbled
 Ere we came to the white mans tongue
 To the cool of our deep verandas 
 To the blaze of our jewelled main
 To the night to the palms in the moonlight
 And the firefly in the cane

 To the hearth of our peoples people 
 To her wellploughed windy sea
 To the hush of our dread highaltar
 Where The Abbey makes us We
 To the grist of the slowground ages
 To the gain that is yours and mine 
 To the Bank of the Open Credit
 To the Powerhouse of the Line

 Weve drunk to the Queen  God bless her 
 Weve drunk to our mothers land
 Weve drunk to our English brother
 And we hope hell understand
 Weve drunk as much as were able
 And the Cross swings low for the morn
 Last toast  and your foot on the table 
 A health to the Nativeborn

 A health to the Nativeborn Stand up
 Were six white men arow
 All bound to sing o the little things we care about
 All bound to fight for the little things we care about
 With the weight of a sixfold blow
 By the might of our cabletow Take hands
 From the Orkneys to the Horn
 All round the world and a little loop to pull it by
 All round the world and a little strap to buckle it
 A health to the Nativeborn




THE KING


 Farewell Romance the Cavemen said
 With bone well carved he went away
 Flint arms the ignoble arrowhead
 And jasper tips the spear today
 Changed are the Gods of Hunt and Dance
 And he with these Farewell Romance

 Farewell Romance the Lakefolk sighed
 We lift the weight of flatling years
 The caverns of the mountainside
 Hold him who scorns our hutted piers
 Lost hills whereby we dare not dwell
 Guard ye his rest Romance farewell

 Farewell Romance the Soldier spoke
 By sleight of sword we may not win
 But scuffle mid uncleanly smoke
 Of arquebus and culverin
 Honour is lost and none may tell
 Who paid good blows Romance farewell

 Farewell Romance the Traders cried
 Our keels ha lain with every sea
 The dullreturning wind and tide
 Heave up the wharf where we would be
 The known and noted breezes swell
 Our trudging sail Romance farewell

 Goodbye Romance the Skipper said
 He vanished with the coal we burn
 Our dial marks full steam ahead
 Our speed is timed to half a turn
 Sure as the ferried barge we ply
 Twixt port and port Romance goodbye

 Romance the seasontickets mourn
 _He_ never ran to catch his train
 But passed with coach and guard and horn 
 And left the local  late again
 Confound Romance    And all unseen
 Romance brought up the ninefifteen

 His hand was on the lever laid
 His oilcan soothed the worrying cranks
 His whistle waked the snowbound grade
 His foghorn cut the reeking Banks
 By dock and deep and mine and mill
 The Boygod reckless laboured still

 Robed crowned and throned he wove his spell
 Where heartblood beat or hearthsmoke curled
 With unconsidered miracle
 Hedged in a backwardgazing world
 Then taught his chosen bard to say
 Our King was with us  yesterday




THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS


 Away by the lands of the Japanee
 Where the paper lanterns glow
 And the crews of all the shipping drink
 In the house of Blood Street Joe
 At twilight when the landward breeze
 Brings up the harbour noise
 And ebb of Yokohama Bay
 Swigs chattering through the buoys
 In Ciscos Dewdrop DiningRooms
 They tell the tale anew
 Of a hidden sea and a hidden fight
 When the _Baltic_ ran from the _Northern Light_
 And the _Stralsund_ fought the two

 Now this is the Law of the Muscovite that he proves with shot and steel
 When ye come by his isles in the Smoky Sea ye must not take the seal
 Where the gray sea goes nakedly between the weedhung shelves
 And the little blue fox he is bred for his skin
 and the seal they breed for themselves
 For when the _matkas_ seek the shore to drop their pups aland
 The great manseal haul out of the sea aroaring band by band
 And when the first September gales have slaked their ruttingwrath
 The great manseal haul back to the sea and no man knows their path
 Then dark they lie and stark they lie  rookery dune and floe
 And the Northern Lights come down o nights to dance with the houseless snow
 And God Who clears the grounding berg and steers the grinding floe
 He hears the cry of the little kitfox and the wind along the snow
 But since our women must walk gay and money buys their gear
 The sealingboats they filch that way at hazard year by year
 English they be and Japanee that hang on the Brown Bears flank
 And some be Scot but the worst of the lot and the boldest thieves be Yank

 It was the sealer _Northern Light_ to the Smoky Seas she bore
 With a stovepipe stuck from a starboard port and the Russian flag at her fore
 _Baltic_ _Stralsund_ and _Northern Light_ 
 oh they were birds of a feather 
 Slipping away to the Smoky Seas three sealthieves together
 And at last she came to a sandy cove and the Baltic lay therein
 But her men were up with the herding seal to drive and club and skin
 There were fifteen hundred skins abeach cool pelt and proper fur
 When the _Northern Light_ drove into the bight
 and the seamist drove with her
 The _Baltic_ called her men and weighed  she could not choose but run 
 For a stovepipe seen through the closing mist it shows like a fourinch gun
 And loss it is that is sad as death to lose both trip and ship
 And lie for a rotting contraband on Vladivostock slip
 She turned and dived in the seasmother as a rabbit dives in the whins
 And the _Northern Light_ sent up her boats to steal the stolen skins
 They had not brought a load to side or slid their hatches clear
 When they were aware of a sloopofwar ghostwhite and very near
 Her flag she showed and her guns she showed  three of them black abeam
 And a funnel white with the crusted salt but never a show of steam

 There was no time to man the brakes they knocked the shackle free
 And the _Northern Light_ stood out again goosewinged to open sea
 For life it is that is worse than death by force of Russian law
 To work in the mines of mercury that loose the teeth in your jaw
 They had not run a mile from shore  they heard no shots behind 
 When the skipper smote his hand on his thigh and threw her up in the wind
 Bluffed  raised out on a bluff said he for if my names Tom Hall
 You must set a thief to catch a thief  and a thief has caught us all
 By every butt in Oregon and every spar in Maine
 The hand that spilled the wind from her sail was the hand of Reuben Paine
 He has rigged and trigged her with paint and spar
 and faith he has faked her well 
 But Id know the _Stralsund_s deckhouse yet from here to the booms o Hell
 Oh once we ha met at Baltimore and twice on Boston pier
 But the sickest day for you Reuben Paine was the day that you came here 
 The day that you came here my lad to scare us from our seal
 With your funnel made o your painted cloth and your guns o rotten deal
 Ring and blow for the _Baltic_ now and head her back to the bay
 And well come into the game again  with a double deck to play

 They rang and blew the sealers call  the poaching cry of the sea 
 And they raised the _Baltic_ out of the mist and an angry ship was she
 And blind they groped through the whirling white and blind to the bay again
 Till they heard the creak of the _Stralsund_s boom
 and the clank of her mooring chain
 They laid them down by bitt and boat their pistols in their belts
 And Will you fight for it Reuben Paine or will you share the pelts

 A dogtoothed laugh laughed Reuben Paine and bared his flenchingknife
 Yea skin for skin and all that he hath a man will give for his life
 But Ive six thousand skins below and Yeddo Port to see
 And theres never a law of God or man runs north of FiftyThree
 So go in peace to the naked seas with empty holds to fill
 And Ill be good to your seal this catch as many as I shall kill

 Answered the snap of a closing lock and the jar of a gunbutt slid
 But the tender fog shut fold on fold to hide the wrong they did
 The weeping fog rolled fold on fold the wrath of man to cloak
 And the flamespurts pale ran down the rail as the sealingrifles spoke
 The bullets bit on bend and butt the splinter slivered free
 Little they trust to sparrowdust that stop the seal in his sea
 The thick smoke hung and would not shift leaden it lay and blue
 But three were down on the _Baltic_s deck and two of the _Stralsund_s crew
 An armslength out and overside the banked fog held them bound
 But as they heard or groan or word they fired at the sound
 For one cried out on the Name of God and one to have him cease
 And the questing volley found them both and bade them hold their peace
 And one called out on a heathen joss and one on the Virgins Name
 And the schooling bullet leaped across and showed them whence they came
 And in the waiting silences the rudder whined beneath
 And each man drew his watchful breath slow taken tween the teeth 
 Trigger and ear and eye acock knit brow and harddrawn lips 
 Bracing his feet by chock and cleat for the rolling of the ships
 Till they heard the cough of a wounded man that fought in the fog for breath
 Till they heard the torment of Reuben Paine that wailed upon his death

 The tides theyll go through Fundy Race but Ill go nevermore
 And see the hogs from ebbtide mark turn scampering back to shore
 No more Ill see the trawlers drift below the Bass Rock ground
 Or watch the tall Fall steamer lights tear blazing up the Sound
 Sorrow is me in a lonely sea and a sinful fight I fall
 But if theres law o God or man youll swing for it yet Tom Hall
 Tom Hall stood up by the quarterrail Your words in your teeth said he
 Theres never a law of God or man runs north of FiftyThree
 So go in grace with Him to face and an illspent life behind
 And Ill be good to your widows Rube as many as I shall find

 A _Stralsund_ man shot blind and large and a warlock Finn was he
 And he hit Tom Hall with a bursting ball a handsbreadth over the knee
 Tom Hall caught hold by the toppinglift and sat him down with an oath
 Youll wait a little Rube he said the Devil has called for both
 The Devil is driving both this tide and the killinggrounds are close
 And well go up to the Wrath of God as the holluschickie goes
 O men put back your guns again and lay your rifles by
 Weve fought our fight and the best are down Let up and let us die
 Quit firing by the bow there  quit Call off the _Baltic_s crew
 Youre sure of Hell as me or Rube  but wait till we get through
 There went no word between the ships but thick and quick and loud
 The lifeblood drummed on the dripping decks
 with the fogdew from the shroud
 The seapull drew them side by side gunnel to gunnel laid
 And they felt the sheerstrakes pound and clear but never a word was said

 Then Reuben Paine cried out again before his spirit passed
 Have I followed the sea for thirty years to die in the dark at last
 Curse on her work that has nipped me here with a shifty trick unkind 
 I have gotten my death where I got my bread but I dare not face it blind
 Curse on the fog Is there never a wind of all the winds I knew
 To clear the smother from off my chest and let me look at the blue
 The good fog heard  like a splitten sail to left and right she tore
 And they saw the sundogs in the haze and the seal upon the shore
 Silver and gray ran spit and bay to meet the steelbacked tide
 And pinched and white in the clearing light the crews stared overside
 O rainbowgay the red pools lay that swilled and spilled and spread
 And gold raw gold the spent shell rolled between the careless dead 
 The dead that rocked so drunkenwise to weather and to lee
 And they saw the work their hands had done as God had bade them see

 And a little breeze blew over the rail that made the headsails lift
 But no man stood by wheel or sheet and they let the schooners drift
 And the rattle rose in Reubens throat and he cast his soul with a cry
 And Gone already Tom Hall he said Then its time for me to die
 His eyes were heavy with great sleep and yearning for the land
 And he spoke as a man that talks in dreams his wound beneath his hand
 Oh there comes no good o the westering wind that backs against the sun
 Wash down the decks  theyre all too red  and share the skins and run
 _Baltic_ _Stralsund_ and _Northern Light_  clean share and share for all
 Youll find the fleets off Tolstoi Mees but you will not find Tom Hall
 Evil he did in shoalwater and blacker sin on the deep
 But now hes sick of watch and trick and now hell turn and sleep
 Hell have no more of the crawling sea that made him suffer so
 But hell lie down on the killinggrounds where the holluschickie go
 And west youll sail and south again beyond the seafogs rim
 And tell the Yoshiwara girls to burn a stick for him
 And youll not weight him by the heels and dump him overside
 But carry him up to the sandhollows to die as Bering died
 And make a place for Reuben Paine that knows the fight was fair
 And leave the two that did the wrong to talk it over there

 Halfsteam ahead by guess and lead for the sun is mostly veiled 
 Through fog to fog by luck and log sail ye as Bering sailed
 And if the light shall lift aright to give your landfall plain
 North and by west from Zapne Crest ye raise the Crosses Twain
 Fair marks are they to the inner bay the reckless poacher knows
 What time the scarred seecatchie lead their sleek seraglios
 Ever they hear the floepack clear and the blast of the old bullwhale
 And the deep sealroar that beats offshore above the loudest gale
 Ever they wait the winters hate as the thundering _boorga_ calls
 Where northward look they to St George and westward to St Pauls
 Ever they greet the hunted fleet  lone keels off headlands drear 
 When the sealingschooners flit that way at hazard year by year
 Ever in Yokohama port men tell the tale anew
 Of a hidden sea and a hidden fight
 When the _Baltic_ ran from the _Northern Light_
 And the _Stralsund_ fought the two




THE DERELICT

 _And reports the derelict _Mary Pollock_ still at sea_
 SHIPPING NEWS


 I was the staunchest of our fleet
 Till the sea rose beneath our feet
 Unheralded in hatred past all measure
 Into his pits he stamped my crew
 Buffeted blinded bound and threw
 Bidding me eyeless wait upon his pleasure

 Man made me and my will
 Is to my maker still
 Whom now the currents con the rollers steer 
 Lifting forlorn to spy
 Trailed smoke along the sky
 Falling afraid lest any keel come near

 Wrenched as the lips of thirst
 Wried dried and split and burst
 Bonebleached my decks windscoured to the graining
 And jarred at every roll
 The gear that was my soul
 Answers the anguish of my beams complaining

 For life that crammed me full
 Gangs of the prying gull
 That shriek and scrabble on the riven hatches
 For roar that dumbed the gale
 My hawsepipes guttering wail
 Sobbing my heart out through the uncounted watches

 Blind in the hot blue ring
 Through all my points I swing 
 Swing and return to shift the sun anew
 Blind in my wellknown sky
 I hear the stars go by
 Mocking the prow that cannot hold one true

 White on my wasted path
 Wave after wave in wrath
 Frets gainst his fellow warring where to send me
 Flung forward heaved aside
 Witless and dazed I bide
 The mercy of the comber that shall end me

 North where the bergs careen
 The spray of seas unseen
 Smokes round my head and freezes in the falling
 South where the corals breed
 The footless floating weed
 Folds me and fouls me strake on strake upcrawling

 I that was clean to run
 My race against the sun 
 Strength on the deep am bawd to all disaster 
 Whipped forth by night to meet
 My sisters careless feet
 And with a kiss betray her to my master

 Man made me and my will
 Is to my maker still 
 To him and his our peoples at their pier
 Lifting in hope to spy
 Trailed smoke along the sky
 Falling afraid lest any keel come near




THE ANSWER


 A Rose in tatters on the garden path
 Cried out to God and murmured gainst His Wrath
 Because a sudden wind at twilights hush
 Had snapped her stem alone of all the bush
 And God Who hears both sundried dust and sun
 Had pity whispering to that luckless one
 Sister in that thou sayest We did not well 
 What voices heardst thou when thy petals fell
 And the Rose answered In that evil hour
 A voice said Father wherefore falls the flower
 For lo the very gossamers are still
 And a voice answered Son by Allahs will

 Then softly as a rainmist on the sward
 Came to the Rose the Answer of the Lord
 Sister before We smote the dark in twain
 Ere yet the stars saw one another plain
 Time Tide and Space We bound unto the task
 That thou shouldst fall and such an one should ask
 Whereat the withered flower all content
 Died as they die whose days are innocent
 While he who questioned why the flower fell
 Caught hold of God and saved his soul from Hell




THE SONG OF THE BANJO


 You couldnt pack a Broadwood half a mile 
 You mustnt leave a fiddle in the damp 
 You couldnt raft an organ up the Nile
 And play it in an Equatorial swamp
 _I_ travel with the cookingpots and pails 
 _Im_ sandwiched tween the coffee and the pork 
 And when the dusty column checks and tails
 You should hear me spur the rearguard to a walk
 With my _Pillywillywinkywinky popp_
 Oh its any tune that comes into my head
 So I keep em moving forward till they drop
 So I play em up to water and to bed

 In the silence of the camp before the fight
 When its good to make your will and say your prayer
 You can hear my _strumptytumpty_ overnight
 Explaining ten to one was always fair
 Im the Prophet of the Utterly Absurd
 Of the Patently Impossible and Vain 
 And when the Thing that Couldnt has occurred
 Give me time to change my leg and go again
 With my _Tumpatumpatumpatumpa tump_
 In the desert where the dungfed campsmoke curled
 There was never voice before us till I led our lonely chorus
 I  the wardrum of the White Man round the world

 By the bitter road the Younger Son must tread
 Ere he win to hearth and saddle of his own 
 Mid the riot of the shearers at the shed
 In the silence of the herders hut alone 
 In the twilight on a bucket upside down
 Hear me babble what the weakest wont confess 
 I am Memory and Torment  I am Town
 I am all that ever went with evening dress
 With my _Tunka tunkatunkatunkatunk_
 So the lights  the London Lights  grow near and plain
 So I rowel em afresh towards the Devil and the Flesh
 Till I bring my broken rankers home again

 In desire of many marvels over sea
 Where the newraised tropic city sweats and roars
 I have sailed with Young Ulysses from the quay
 Till the anchor rumbled down on stranger shores
 He is blooded to the open and the sky
 He is taken in a snare that shall not fail
 He shall hear me singing strongly till he die
 Like the shouting of a backstay in a gale
 With my _Hya Heeya Heeya Hullah Haul_
 O the green that thunders aft along the deck
 Are you sick o towns and men You must sign and sail again
 For its Johnny Bowlegs pack your kit and trek

 Through the gorge that gives the stars at noonday clear 
 Up the pass that packs the scud beneath our wheel 
 Round the bluff that sinks her thousand fathom sheer 
 Down the valley with our guttering brakes asqueal
 Where the trestle groans and quivers in the snow
 Where the manyshedded levels loop and twine
 So I lead my reckless children from below
 Till we sing the Song of Roland to the pine
 With my _Tinkatinkatinkatinkatink_
 And the axe has cleared the mountain croup and crest
 So we ride the iron stallions down to drink
 Through the canyons to the waters of the West

 And the tunes that mean so much to you alone 
 Common tunes that make you choke and blow your nose
 Vulgar tunes that bring the laugh that brings the groan 
 I can rip your very heartstrings out with those
 With the feasting and the folly and the fun 
 And the lying and the lusting and the drink
 And the merry play that drops you when youre done
 To the thoughts that burn like irons if you think
 With my _Plunkalunkalunkalunkalunk_
 Heres a trifle on account of pleasure past
 Ere the wit that made you win gives you eyes to see your sin
 And the heavier repentance at the last

 Let the organ moan her sorrow to the roof 
 I have told the naked stars the Grief of Man
 Let the trumpets snare the foeman to the proof 
 I have known Defeat and mocked it as we ran
 My bray ye may not alter nor mistake
 When I stand to jeer the fatted Soul of Things
 But the Song of Lost Endeavour that I make
 Is it hidden in the twanging of the strings
 With my _Tararararararararrrp_
 Is it naught to you that hear and pass me by
 But the word  the word is mine when the order moves the line
 And the lean locked ranks go roaring down to die

 Of the driven dust of speech I make a flame
 And a scourge of broken withes that men let fall
 For the words that had no honour till I came 
 Lo I raise them into honour over all
 By the wisdom of the centuries I speak 
 To the tune of yestermorn I set the truth 
 I the joy of life unquestioned  I the Greek 
 I the everlasting Wonder Song of Youth
 With my _Tinkatinkatinkatinkatink_
 What dye lack my noble masters What dye lack
 So I draw the world together link by link
 Yea from Delos up to Limerick and back

MULHOLLANDS CONTRACT


 The fear was on the cattle for the gale was on the sea
 An the pens broke up on the lower deck an let the creatures free 
 An the lights went out on the lower deck an no one near but me

 I had been singin to them to keep em quiet there
 For the lower deck is the dangerousest requirin constant care
 An give to me as the strongest man though used to drink and swear

 I see my chance was certain of bein horned or trod
 For the lower deck was packed with steers thickern peas in a pod
 An more pens broke at every roll  so I made a Contract with God

 An by the terms of the Contract as I have read the same
 If He got me to port alive I would exalt His Name
 An praise His Holy Majesty till further orders came

 He saved me from the cattle an He saved me from the sea
 For they found me tween two drownded ones where the roll had landed me 
 An a fourinch crack on top of my head as crazy as could be

 But that were done by a stanchion an not by a bullock at all
 An I lay still for seven weeks convalessing of the fall
 An readin the shiny Scripture texts in the Seamans Hospital

 An I spoke to God of our Contract an He says to my prayer
 I never puts on My ministers no more than they can bear
 So back you go to the cattleboats an preach My Gospel there

 For human life is chancy at any kind of trade
 But most of all as well you know when the steers are madafraid
 So you go back to the cattleboats an preach em as Ive said

 They must quit drinkin an swearin they mustnt knife on a blow
 They must quit gamblin their wages and you must preach it so
 For now those boats are more like Hell than anything else I know

 I didnt want to do it for I knew what I should get
 An I wanted to preach Religion handsome an out of the wet
 But the Word of the Lord were lain on me an I done what I was set

 I have been smit an bruised as warned would be the case
 An turned my cheek to the smiter exactly as Scripture says
 But following that I knocked him down an led him up to Grace

 An we have preaching on Sundays whenever the sea is calm
 An I use no knife or pistol an I never take no harm
 For the Lord abideth back of me to guide my fighting arm

 An I sign for fourpoundten a month and save the money clear
 An I am in charge of the lower deck an I never lose a steer
 An I believe in Almighty God an preach His Gospel here

 The skippers say Im crazy but I can prove em wrong
 For I am in charge of the lower deck with all that doth belong 
 _Which they would not give to a lunatic and the competition so strong_




ANCHOR SONG


 Heh Walk her round Heave ah heave her short again
 Over snatch her over there and hold her on the pawl
 Loose all sail and brace your yards back and full 
 Ready jib to pay her off and heave short all
 Well ah fare you well we can stay no more with you my love 
 Down set down your liquor and your girl from off your knee
 For the wind has come to say
 You must take me while you may
 If youd go to Mother Carey
 Walk her down to Mother Carey
 Oh were bound to Mother Carey where she feeds her chicks at sea

 Heh Walk her round Break ah break it out o that
 Break our starboardbower out apeak awash and clear
 Port  port she casts with the harbourmud beneath her foot
 And thats the last o bottom we shall see this year
 Well ah fare you well for weve got to take her out again 
 Take her out in ballast riding light and cargofree
 And its time to clear and quit
 When the hawser grips the bitt
 So well pay you with the foresheet and a promise from the sea

 Heh Tally on Aft and walk away with her
 Handsome to the cathead now O tally on the fall
 Stop seize and fish and easy on the davitguy
 Up well up the fluke of her and inboard haul
 Well ah fare you well for the Channel winds took hold of us
 Choking down our voices as we snatch the gaskets free
 And its blowing up for night
 And shes dropping Light on Light
 And shes snorting under bonnets for a breath of open sea

 Wheel full and by but shell smell her road alone tonight
 Sick she is and harboursick  O sick to clear the land
 Roll down to Brest with the old Red Ensign over us 
 Carry on and thrash her out with all shell stand
 Well ah fare you well and its Ushant slams the door on us
 Whirling like a windmill through the dirty scud to lee
 Till the last last flicker goes
 From the tumbling waterrows
 And were off to Mother Carey
 Walk her down to Mother Carey
 Oh were bound for Mother Carey where she feeds her chicks at sea




THE LOST LEGION


 Theres a Legion that never was listed
 That carries no colours or crest
 But split in a thousand detachments
 Is breaking the road for the rest
 Our fathers they left us their blessing 
 They taught us and groomed us and crammed
 But weve shaken the Clubs and the Messes
 To go and find out and be damned
 Dear boys
 To go and get shot and be damned

 So some of us chivy the slaver
 And some of us cherish the black
 And some of us hunt on the Oil Coast
 And some on  the Wallaby track
 And some of us drift to Sarawak
 And some of us drift up The Fly
 And some share our tucker with tigers
 And some with the gentle Masai
 Dear boys
 Take tea with the giddy Masai

 Weve painted The Islands vermilion
 Weve pearled on halfshares in the Bay
 Weve shouted on sevenounce nuggets
 Weve starved on a Seedeeboys pay
 Weve laughed at the world as we found it 
 Its women and cities and men 
 From Sayyid Burgash in a tantrum
 To the smokereddened eyes of Loben
 Dear boys
 Weve a little account with Loben

 The ends o the Earth were our portion
 The ocean at large was our share
 There was never a skirmish to windward
 But the Leaderless Legion was there
 Yes somehow and somewhere and always
 We were first when the trouble began
 From a lotteryrow in Manila
 To an IDB race on the Pan
 Dear boys
 With the Mounted Police on the Pan

 We preach in advance of the Army
 We skirmish ahead of the Church
 With never a gunboat to help us
 When were scuppered and left in the lurch
 But we know as the cartridges finish
 And were filed on our last little shelves
 That the Legion that never was listed
 Will send us as good as ourselves
 Good men
 Five hundred as good as ourselves

 Then a health we must drink it in whispers
 To our wholly unauthorised horde 
 To the line of our dusty foreloopers
 The Gentlemen Rovers abroad 
 Yes a health to ourselves ere we scatter
 For the steamer wont wait for the train
 And the Legion that never was listed
 Goes back into quarters again
 Regards
 Goes back under canvas again
 Hurrah
 The swag and the billy again
 Heres how
 The trail and the packhorse again
 Salue
 The trek and the laager again




THE SEAWIFE


 There dwells a wife by the Northern Gate
 And a wealthy wife is she
 She breeds a breed o rovin men
 And casts them over sea

 And some are drowned in deep water
 And some in sight o shore
 And word goes back to the weary wife
 And ever she sends more

 For since that wife had gate or gear
 Or hearth or garth or bield
 She willed her sons to the white harvest
 And that is a bitter yield

 She wills her sons to the wet ploughing
 To ride the horse of tree
 And syne her sons come back again
 Farspent from out the sea

 The good wifes sons come home again
 With little into their hands
 But the lore of men that ha dealt with men
 In the new and naked lands

 But the faith of men that ha brothered men
 By more than easy breath
 And the eyes o men that ha read wi men
 In the open books of death

 Rich are they rich in wonders seen
 But poor in the goods o men
 So what they ha got by the skin o their teeth
 They sell for their teeth again

 For whether they lose to the naked life
 Or win to their hearts desire
 They tell it all to the weary wife
 That nods beside the fire

 Her hearth is wide to every wind
 That makes the white ash spin
 And tide and tide and tween the tides
 Her sons go out and in

 Out with great mirth that do desire
 Hazard of trackless ways
 In with content to wait their watch
 And warm before the blaze

 And some return by failing light
 And some in waking dream
 For she hears the heels of the dripping ghosts
 That ride the rough roofbeam

 Home they come home from all the ports
 The living and the dead
 The good wifes sons come home again
 For her blessing on their head




HYMN BEFORE ACTION


 The earth is full of anger
 The seas are dark with wrath
 The Nations in their harness
 Go up against our path
 Ere yet we loose the legions 
 Ere yet we draw the blade
 Jehovah of the Thunders
 Lord God of Battles aid

 High lust and froward bearing
 Proud heart rebellious brow 
 Deaf ear and soul uncaring
 We seek Thy mercy now
 The sinner that forswore Thee
 The fool that passed Thee by
 Our times are known before Thee 
 Lord grant us strength to die

 For those who kneel beside us
 At altars not Thine own
 Who lack the lights that guide us
 Lord let their faith atone
 If wrong we did to call them
 By honour bound they came
 Let not Thy Wrath befall them
 But deal to us the blame

 From panic pride and terror
 Revenge that knows no rein
 Light haste and lawless error
 Protect us yet again
 Cloak Thou our undeserving
 Make firm the shuddering breath
 In silence and unswerving
 To taste Thy lesser death

 Ah Mary pierced with sorrow
 Remember reach and save
 The soul that comes tomorrow
 Before the God that gave
 Since each was born of woman
 For each at utter need 
 True comrade and true foeman 
 Madonna intercede

 Een now their vanguard gathers
 Een now we face the fray 
 As Thou didst help our fathers
 Help Thou our host today
 Fulfilled of signs and wonders
 In life in death made clear 
 Jehovah of the Thunders
 Lord God of Battles hear




TO THE TRUE ROMANCE


 Thy face is far from this our war
 Our call and countercry
 I shall not find Thee quick and kind
 Nor know Thee till I die
 Enough for me in dreams to see
 And touch Thy garments hem
 Thy feet have trod so near to God
 I may not follow them

 Through wantonness if men profess
 They weary of Thy parts
 Een let them die at blasphemy
 And perish with their arts
 But we that love but we that prove
 Thine excellence august
 While we adore discover more
 Thee perfect wise and just

 Since spoken word Mans Spirit stirred
 Beyond his bellyneed
 What is is Thine of fair design
 In thought and craft and deed
 Each stroke aright of toil and fight
 That was and that shall be
 And hope too high wherefore we die
 Has birth and worth in Thee

 Who holds by Thee hath Heaven in fee
 To gild his dross thereby
 And knowledge sure that he endure
 A child until he die 
 For to make plain that mans disdain
 Is but new Beautys birth 
 For to possess in loneliness
 The joy of all the earth

 As Thou didst teach all lovers speech
 And Life all mystery
 So shalt Thou rule by every school
 Till love and longing die
 Who wast or yet the Lights were set
 A whisper in the Void
 Who shalt be sung through planets young
 When this is clean destroyed

 Beyond the bounds our staring rounds
 Across the pressing dark
 The children wise of outer skies
 Look hitherward and mark
 A light that shifts a glare that drifts
 Rekindling thus and thus
 Not all forlorn for Thou hast borne
 Strange tales to them of us

 Time hath no tide but must abide
 The servant of Thy will
 Tide hath no time for to Thy rhyme
 The ranging stars stand still 
 Regent of spheres that lock our fears
 Our hopes invisible
 Oh twas certes at Thy decrees
 We fashioned Heaven and Hell

 Pure Wisdom hath no certain path
 That lacks thy morningeyne
 And captains bold by Thee controlled
 Most like to Gods design
 Thou art the Voice to kingly boys
 To lift them through the fight
 And Comfortress of Unsuccess
 To give the dead goodnight 

 A veil to draw twixt God His Law
 And Mans infirmity
 A shadow kind to dumb and blind
 The shambles where we die
 A rule to trick th arithmetic
 Too base of leaguing odds 
 The spur of trust the curb of lust
 Thou handmaid of the Gods

 O Charity all patiently
 Abiding wrack and scaith
 O Faith that meets ten thousand cheats
 Yet drops no jot of faith
 Devil and brute Thou dost transmute
 To higher lordlier show
 Who art in sooth that lovely Truth
 The careless angels know

 Thy face is far from this our war
 Our call and countercry
 I may not find Thee quick and kind
 Nor know Thee till I die

 Yet may I look with heart unshook
 On blow brought home or missed 
 Yet may I hear with equal ear
 The clarions down the List
 Yet set my lance above mischance
 And ride the barriere 
 Oh hit or miss how little tis
 My Lady is not there




THE FLOWERS

 To our private taste there is always something a little exotic
 almost artificial in songs which under an English aspect and dress
 are yet so manifestly the product of other skies They affect us
 like translations the very fauna and flora are alien remote
 the dogstooth violet is but an ill substitute for the rathe primrose
 nor can we ever believe that the woodrobin sings as sweetly in April
 as the English thrush  THE ATHENAEUM


 Buy my English posies
 Kent and Surrey may 
 Violets of the Undercliff
 Wet with Channel spray
 Cowslips from a Devon combe 
 Midland furze afire 
 Buy my English posies
 And Ill sell your hearts desire

 Buy my English posies
 You that scorn the May
 Wont you greet a friend from home
 Half the world away
 Green against the draggled drift
 Faint and frail and first 
 Buy my Northern bloodroot
 And Ill know where you were nursed
 Robin down the loggingroad whistles Come to me
 Spring has found the maplegrove the sap is running free
 All the winds of Canada call the ploughingrain
 Take the flower and turn the hour and kiss your love again

 Buy my English posies
 Heres to match your need 
 Buy a tuft of royal heath
 Buy a bunch of weed
 White as sand of Muysenberg
 Spun before the gale 
 Buy my heath and lilies
 And Ill tell you whence you hail
 Under hot Constantia broad the vineyards lie 
 Throned and thorned the aching berg props the speckless sky 
 Slow below the Wynberg firs trails the tilted wain 
 Take the flower and turn the hour and kiss your love again

 Buy my English posies
 You that will not turn 
 Buy my hotwood clematis
 Buy a frond o fern
 Gathered where the Erskine leaps
 Down the road to Lorne 
 Buy my Christmas creeper
 And Ill say where you were born
 West away from Melbourne dust holidays begin 
 They that mock at Paradise woo at Cora Lynn 
 Through the great South Otway gums sings the great South Main 
 Take the flower and turn the hour and kiss your love again

 Buy my English posies
 Heres your choice unsold
 Buy a bloodred myrtlebloom
 Buy the kowhais gold
 Flung for gift on Taupos face
 Sign that spring is come 
 Buy my clinging myrtle
 And Ill give you back your home
 Broom behind the windy town pollen o the pine 
 Bellbird in the leafy deep where the _ratas_ twine 
 Fern above the saddlebow flax upon the plain 
 Take the flower and turn the hour and kiss your love again

 Buy my English posies
 Ye that have your own
 Buy them for a brothers sake
 Overseas alone
 Weed ye trample underfoot
 Floods his heart abrim 
 Bird ye never heeded
 Oh she calls his dead to him
 Far and far our homes are set round the Seven Seas
 Woe for us if we forget we that hold by these
 Unto each his motherbeach bloom and bird and land 
 Masters of the Seven Seas oh love and understand




THE LAST RHYME OF TRUE THOMAS


 The King has called for priest and cup
 The King has taken spur and blade
 To dub True Thomas a belted knight
 And all for the sake o the songs he made

 They have sought him high they have sought him low
 They have sought him over down and lea
 They have found him by the milkwhite thorn
 That guards the gates o Faerie

 Twas bent beneath and blue above
 Their eyes were held that they might not see
 The kine that grazed beneath the knowes
 Oh they were the Queens o Faerie

 Now cease your song the King he said
 Oh cease your song and get you dight
 To vow your vow and watch your arms
 For I will dub you a belted knight

 For I will give you a horse o pride
 Wi blazon and spur and page and squire
 Wi keep and tail and seizin and law
 And land to hold at your desire

 True Thomas smiled above his harp
 And turned his face to the naked sky
 Where blown before the wastrel wind
 The thistledown she floated by

 I ha vowed my vow in another place
 And bitter oath it was on me
 I ha watched my arms the leelong night
 Where fivescore fighting men would flee

 My lance is tipped o the hammered flame
 My shield is beat o the moonlight cold
 And I won my spurs in the Middle World
 A thousand fathom beneath the mould

 And what should I make wi a horse o pride
 And what should I make wi a sword so brown
 But spill the rings o the Gentle Folk
 And flyte my kin in the Fairy Town

 And what should I make wi blazon and belt
 Wi keep and tail and seizin and fee
 And what should I do wi page and squire
 That am a king in my own countrie

 For I send east and I send west
 And I send far as my will may flee
 By dawn and dusk and the drinking rain
 And syne my Sendings return to me

 They come wi news of the groanin earth
 They come wi news o the roarin sea
 Wi word of Spirit and Ghost and Flesh
 And man thats mazed among the three

 The King he bit his nether lip
 And smote his hand upon his knee
 By the faith o my soul True Thomas he said
 Ye waste no wit in courtesie

 As I desire unto my pride
 Can I make Earls by three and three
 To run before and ride behind
 And serve the sons o my body

 And what care I for your rowfoot earls
 Or all the sons o your body
 Before they win to the Pride o Name
 I trow they all ask leave o me

 For I make Honour wi muckle mouth
 As I make Shame wi mincin feet
 To sing wi the priests at the marketcross
 Or run wi the dogs in the naked street

 And some they give me the good red gold
 And some they give me the white money
 And some they give me a clout o meal
 For they be people o low degree

 And the song I sing for the counted gold
 The same I sing for the white money
 But best I sing for the clout o meal
 That simple people given me

 The King cast down a silver groat
 A silver groat o Scots money
 If I come wi a poor mans dole he said
 True Thomas will ye harp to me

 Whenas I harp to the children small
 They press me close on either hand
 And who are you True Thomas said
 That you should ride while they must stand

 Light down light down from your horse o pride
 I trow ye talk too loud and hie
 And I will make you a triple word
 And syne if ye dare ye shall noble me

 He has lighted down from his horse o pride
 And set his back against the stone
 Now guard you well True Thomas said
 Ere I rax your heart from your breastbone

 True Thomas played upon his harp
 The fairy harp that couldna lee
 And the first least word the proud King heard
 It harpit the salt tear out o his ee

 Oh I see the love that I lost long syne
 I touch the hope that I may not see
 And all that I did o hidden shame
 Like little snakes they hiss at me

 The sun is lost at noon  at noon
 The dread o doom has grippit me
 True Thomas hide me under your cloak
 God wot Im little fit to dee

 Twas bent beneath and blue above 
 Twas open field and running flood 
 Where hot on heath and dike and wall
 The high sun warmed the adders brood

 Lie down lie down True Thomas said
 The God shall judge when all is done
 But I will bring you a better word
 And lift the cloud that I laid on

 True Thomas played upon his harp
 That birled and brattled to his hand
 And the next least word True Thomas made
 It garred the King take horse and brand

 Oh I hear the tread o the fighting men
 I see the sun on splent and spear
 I mark the arrow outen the fern
 That flies so low and sings so clear

 Advance my standards to that war
 And bid my good knights prick and ride
 The gled shall watch as fierce a fight
 As eer was fought on the Border side

 Twas bent beneath and blue above
 Twas nodding grass and naked sky
 Where ringing up the wastrel wind
 The eyas stooped upon the pie

 True Thomas sighed above his harp
 And turned the song on the midmost string
 And the last least word True Thomas made
 He harpit his dead youth back to the King

 Now I am prince and I do well
 To love my love withouten fear
 To walk wi man in fellowship
 And breathe my horse behind the deer

 My hounds they bay unto the death
 The buck has couched beyond the burn
 My love she waits at her window
 To wash my hands when I return

 For that I live am I content
 Oh I have seen my true loves eyes
 To stand wi Adam in Edenglade
 And run in the woods o Paradise

 Twas naked sky and nodding grass
 Twas running flood and wastrel wind
 Where checked against the open pass
 The red deer belled to call the hind

 True Thomas laid his harp away
 And louted low at the saddleside
 He has taken stirrup and hauden rein
 And set the King on his horse o pride

 Sleep ye or wake True Thomas said
 That sit so still that muse so long
 Sleep ye or wake  till the latter sleep
 I trow yell not forget my song

 I ha harpit a shadow out o the sun
 To stand before your face and cry
 I ha armed the earth beneath your heel
 And over your head I ha dusked the sky

 I ha harpit ye up to the throne o God
 I ha harpit your midmost soul in three
 I ha harpit ye down to the Hinges o Hell
 And  ye  would  make  a Knight o me




IN THE NEOLITHIC AGE


 In the Neolithic Age savage warfare did I wage
 For food and fame and woolly horses pelt
 I was singer to my clan in that dim red Dawn of Man
 And I sang of all we fought and feared and felt

 Yea I sang as now I sing when the Prehistoric spring
 Made the piled Biscayan icepack split and shove
 And the troll and gnome and dwerg and the Gods of Cliff and Berg
 Were about me and beneath me and above

 But a rival of Solutre told the tribe my style was _outre_ 
 Neath a tomahawk of diorite he fell
 And I left my views on Art barbed and tanged below the heart
 Of a mammothistic etcher at Grenelle

 Then I stripped them scalp from skull and my hunting dogs fed full
 And their teeth I threaded neatly on a thong
 And I wiped my mouth and said It is well that they are dead
 For I know my work is right and theirs was wrong

 But my Totem saw the shame from his ridgepole shrine he came
 And he told me in a vision of the night 
 There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays
 And every single one of them is right

     

 Then the silence closed upon me till They put new clothing on me
 Of whiter weaker flesh and bone more frail
 And I stepped beneath Times finger once again a tribal singer
 And a minor poet certified by Trll

 Still they skirmish to and fro men my messmates on the snow
 When we headed off the aurochs turn for turn
 When the rich Allobrogenses never kept amanuenses
 And our only plots were piled in lakes at Berne

 Still a cultured Christian age sees us scuffle squeak and rage
 Still we pinch and slap and jabber scratch and dirk
 Still we let our business slide  as we dropped the halfdressed hide 
 To show a fellowsavage how to work

 Still the world is wondrous large  seven seas from marge to marge 
 And it holds a vast of various kinds of man
 And the wildest dreams of Kew are the facts of Khatmandhu
 And the crimes of Clapham chaste in Martaban

 Heres my wisdom for your use as I learned it when the moose
 And the reindeer roared where Paris roars tonight 
 There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays
 And  every  single  one  of  them  is  right




THE STORY OF UNG


 Once on a glittering icefield ages and ages ago
 Ung a maker of pictures fashioned an image of snow
 Fashioned the form of a tribesman  gaily he whistled and sung
 Working the snow with his fingers _Read ye the Story of Ung_

 Pleased was his tribe with that image  came in their hundreds to scan 
 Handled it smelt it and grunted Verily this is a man
 Thus do we carry our lances  thus is a warbelt slung
 Lo it is even as we are Glory and honour to Ung

 Later he pictured an aurochs  later he pictured a bear 
 Pictured the sabretooth tiger dragging a man to his lair 
 Pictured the mountainous mammoth hairy abhorrent alone 
 Out of the love that he bore them scribing them clearly on bone

 Swift came the tribe to behold them peering and pushing and still 
 Men of the bergbattered beaches men of the boulderhatched hill 
 Hunters and fishers and trappers presently whispering low
 Yea they are like  and it may be  But how does the Pictureman know

 Ung  hath he slept with the Aurochs  watched where the Mastodon roam
 Spoke on the ice with the Bowhead  followed the Sabretooth home
 Nay These are toys of his fancy If he have cheated us so
 How is there truth in his image  the man that he fashioned of snow

 Wroth was that maker of pictures  hotly he answered the call
 Hunters and fishers and trappers children and fools are ye all
 Look at the beasts when ye hunt them Swift from the tumult he broke
 Ran to the cave of his father and told him the shame that they spoke

 And the father of Ung gave answer that was old and wise in the craft
 Maker of pictures aforetime he leaned on his lance and laughed
 If they could see as thou seest they would do what thou hast done
 And each man would make him a picture and  what would become of my son

 There would be no pelts of the reindeer flung down at thy cave for a gift
 Nor dole of the oily timber that comes on the Baltic drift
 No store of welldrilled needles nor ouches of amber pale
 No newcut tongues of the bison nor meat of the stranded whale

 _Thou_ hast not toiled at the fishing when the sodden trammels freeze
 Nor worked the warboats outward through the rush of the rockstaked seas
 Yet they bring thee fish and plunder  full meal and an easy bed 
 And all for the sake of thy pictures And Ung held down his head

 _Thou_ hast not stood to the Aurochs when the red snow reeks of the fight
 Men have no time at the houghing to count his curls aright
 And the heart of the hairy Mammoth thou sayest they do not see
 Yet they save it whole from the beaches and broil the best for thee

 And now do they press to thy pictures with opened mouth and eye
 And a little gift in the doorway and the praise no gift can buy
 But  sure they have doubted thy pictures and that is a grievous stain 
 Son that can see so clearly return them their gifts again

 And Ung looked down at his deerskins  their broad shelltasselled bands 
 And Ung drew downward his mitten and looked at his naked hands
 And he gloved himself and departed and he heard his father behind
 Son that can see so clearly rejoice that thy tribe is blind

 Straight on the glittering icefield by the caves of the lost Dordogne
 Ung a maker of pictures fell to his scribing on bone
 Even to mammoth editions Gaily he whistled and sung
 Blessing his tribe for their blindness _Heed ye the Story of Ung_




THE THREEDECKER

 _The threevolume novel is extinct_


 Full thirty foot she towered from waterline to rail
 It cost a watch to steer her and a week to shorten sail
 But spite all modern notions I found her first and best 
 The only certain packet for the Islands of the Blest

 Fair held the breeze behind us  twas warm with lovers prayers
 Wed stolen wills for ballast and a crew of missing heirs
 They shipped as Able Bastards till the Wicked Nurse confessed
 And they worked the old threedecker to the Islands of the Blest

 By ways no gaze could follow a course unspoiled of Cook
 Per Fancy fleetest in man our titled berths we took
 With maids of matchless beauty and parentage unguessed
 And a Church of England parson for the Islands of the Blest

 We asked no social questions  we pumped no hidden shame 
 We never talked obstetrics when the Little Stranger came
 We left the Lord in Heaven we left the fiends in Hell
 We werent exactly Yussufs but  Zuleika didnt tell

 No moral doubt assailed us so when the port we neared
 The villain had his flogging at the gangway and we cheered
 Twas fiddle in the forcsle  twas garlands on the mast
 For every one got married and I went ashore at last

 I left em all in couples akissing on the decks
 I left the lovers loving and the parents signing cheques
 In endless English comfort by countyfolk caressed
 I left the old threedecker at the Islands of the Blest

 That route is barred to steamers youll never lift again
 Our purplepainted headlands or the lordly keeps of Spain
 Theyre just beyond your skyline howeer so far you cruise
 In a ramyoudamnyou liner with a brace of bucking screws

 Swing round your aching searchlight  twill show no havens peace
 Ay blow your shrieking sirens to the deaf graybearded seas
 Boom out the dripping oilbags to skin the deeps unrest 
 And you arent one knot the nearer to the Islands of the Blest

 But when youre threshing crippled with broken bridge and rail
 At a drogue of dead convictions to hold you head to gale
 Calm as the Flying Dutchman from truck to taffrail dressed
 Youll see the old threedecker for the Islands of the Blest

 Youll see her tiering canvas in sheeted silver spread
 Youll hear the longdrawn thunder neath her leaping figurehead
 While far so far above you her tall pooplanterns shine
 Unvexed by wind or weather like the candles round a shrine

 Hull down  hull down and under  she dwindles to a speck
 With noise of pleasant music and dancing on her deck
 Alls well  alls well aboard her  shes left you far behind
 With a scent of oldworld roses through the fog that ties you blind

 Her crew are babes or madmen Her port is all to make
 Youre manned by Truth and Science and you steam for steamings sake
 Well tinker up your engines  you know your business best 
 _She_s taking tired people to the Islands of the Blest




AN AMERICAN


 The American Spirit speaks


 If the Led Striker call it a strike
 Or the papers call it a war
 They know not much what I am like
 Nor what he is my Avatar

 Through many roads by me possessed
 He shambles forth in cosmic guise
 He is the Jester and the Jest
 And he the Text himself applies

 The Celt is in his heart and hand
 The Gaul is in his brain and nerve
 Where cosmopolitanly planned
 He guards the Redskins dry reserve

 His easy unswept hearth he lends
 From Labrador to Guadeloupe
 Till elbowed out by sloven friends
 He camps at sufferance on the stoop

 Calmeyed he scoffs at sword and crown
 Or panicblinded stabs and slays
 Blatant he bids the world bow down
 Or cringing begs a crust of praise

 Or sombredrunk at mine and mart
 He dubs his dreary brethren Kings
 His hands are black with blood  his heart
 Leaps as a babes at little things

 But through the shift of mood and mood
 Mine ancient humour saves him whole 
 The cynic devil in his blood
 That bids him mock his hurrying soul

 That bids him flout the Law he makes
 That bids him make the Law he flouts
 Till dazed by many doubts he wakes
 The drumming guns that  have no doubts

 That checks him foolish  hot and fond
 That chuckles through his deepest ire
 That gilds the slough of his despond
 But dims the goal of his desire

 Inopportune shrillaccented
 The acrid Asiatic mirth
 That leaves him careless mid his dead
 The scandal of the elder earth

 How shall he clear himself how reach
 Your bar or weighed defence prefer
 A brother hedged with alien speech
 And lacking all interpreter

 Which knowledge vexes him a space
 But while Reproof around him rings
 He turns a keen untroubled face
 Home to the instant need of things

 Enslaved illogical elate
 He greets th embarrassed Gods nor fears
 To shake the iron hand of Fate
 Or match with Destiny for beers

 Lo imperturbable he rules
 Unkempt disreputable vast 
 And in the teeth of all the schools
 I  I shall save him at the last




THE MARY GLOSTER


 Ive paid for your sickest fancies Ive humoured your crackedest whim 
 Dick its your daddy dying youve got to listen to him
 Good for a fortnight am I The doctor told you He lied
 I shall go under by morning and  Put that nurse outside
 Never seen death yet Dickie Well now is your time to learn
 And youll wish you held my record before it comes to your turn
 Not counting the Line and the Foundry the yards and the village too
 Ive made myself and a million but Im damned if I made you
 Master at twoandtwenty and married at twentythree 
 Ten thousand men on the payroll and forty freighters at sea
 Fifty years between em and every year of it fight
 And now Im Sir Anthony Gloster dying a baronite
 For I lunched with his Royal Ighness  what was it the papers ahad
 Not least of our merchantprinces Dickie thats me your dad
 _I_ didnt begin with askings _I_ took my job and I stuck
 And I took the chances they wouldnt an now theyre calling it luck
 Lord what boats Ive handled  rotten and leaky and old
 Ran em or  opened the bilgecock precisely as I was told
 Grub that ud bind you crazy and crews that ud turn you grey
 And a big fat lump of insurance to cover the risk on the way
 The others they dursnt do it they said they valued their life
 Theyve served me since as skippers _I_ went and I took my wife
 Over the world I drove em married at twentythree
 And your mother saving the money and making a man of me
 _I_ was content to be master but she said there was better behind
 She took the chances I wouldnt and I followed your mother blind
 She egged me to borrow the money an she helped me to clear the loan
 When we bought half shares in a cheap un and hoisted a flag of our own
 Patching and coaling on credit and living the Lord knew how
 We started the Red Ox freighters  weve eightandthirty now
 And those were the days of clippers and the freights were clipperfreights
 And we knew we were making our fortune but she died in Macassar Straits 
 By the Little Paternosters as you come to the Union Bank 
 And we dropped her in fourteen fathom I pricked it off where she sank
 Owners we were full owners and the boat was christened for her
 And she died in the _Mary Gloster_ My heart how young we were
 So I went on a spree round Java and wellnigh ran her ashore
 But your mother came and warned me and I wouldnt liquor no more
 Strict I stuck to my business afraid to stop or Id think
 Saving the money she warned me and letting the other men drink
 And I met MCullough in London Id turned five undred then
 And tween us we started the Foundry  three forges and twenty men
 Cheap repairs for the cheap uns It paid and the business grew
 For I bought me a steamlathe patent and that was a gold mine too
 Cheaper to build em than buy em _I_ said but MCullough he shied
 And we wasted a year in talking before we moved to the Clyde
 And the Lines were all beginning and we all of us started fair
 Building our engines like houses and staying the boilers square
 But MCullough e wanted cabins with marble and maple and all
 And Brussels an Utrecht velvet and baths and a Social Hall
 And pipes for closets all over and cutting the frames too light
 But MCullough he died in the Sixties and  Well Im dying tonight   
 I knew  _I_ knew what was coming when we bid on the _Byfleet_s keel 
 They piddled and piffled with iron Id given my orders for steel
 Steel and the first expansions It paid I tell you it paid
 When we came with our nineknot freighters and collared the longrun trade
 And they asked me how I did it and I gave em the Scripture text
 You keep your light so shining a little in front o the next
 They copied all they could follow but they couldnt copy my mind
 And I left em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind
 Then came the armourcontracts but that was MCulloughs side
 He was always best in the Foundry but better perhaps he died
 I went through his private papers the notes was plainer than print
 And Im no fool to finish if a manll give me a hint
 I remember his widow was angry So I saw what the drawings meant
 And I started the sixinch rollers and it paid me sixty per cent 
 Sixty per cent _with_ failures and more than twice we could do
 And a quartermillion to credit and I saved it all for you
 I thought  it doesnt matter  you seemed to favour your ma
 But youre nearer forty than thirty and I know the kind you are
 Harrer an Trinity College I ought to ha sent you to sea 
 But I stood you an education an what have you done for me
 The things I knew was proper you wouldnt thank me to give
 And the things I knew was rotten you said was the way to live
 For you muddled with books and pictures an china an etchins an fans
 And your rooms at college was beastly  more like a whores than a mans 
 Till you married that thinflanked woman as white and as stale as a bone
 An she gave you your social nonsense but wheres that kid o your own
 Ive seen your carriages blocking the half o the Cromwell Road
 But never the doctors brougham to help the missus unload
 So there isnt even a grandchild an the Gloster familys done
 Not like your mother she isnt _She_ carried her freight each run
 But they died the pore little beggars At sea she had em  they died
 Only you an you stood it you havent stood much beside
 Weak a liar and idle and mean as a colliers whelp
 Nosing for scraps in the galley No help  my son was no help
 So he gets three undred thousand in trust and the interest paid
 I wouldnt give it you Dickie  you see I made it in trade
 Youre saved from soiling your fingers and if you have no child
 It all comes back to the business Gad wont your wife be wild
 Calls and calls in her carriage her andkerchief up to er eye
 Daddy dear daddys dyin and doing her best to cry
 Grateful Oh yes Im grateful but keep her away from here
 Your mother ud never ha stood er and anyhow women are queer   
 Theres women will say Ive married a second time
 Not quite But give pore Aggie a hundred and tell her your lawyersll fight
 She was the best o the boiling  youll meet her before it ends
 Im in for a row with the mother  Ill leave you settle my friends
 For a man he must go with a woman which women dont understand 
 Or the sort that say they can see it they arent the marrying brand
 But I wanted to speak o your mother thats Lady Gloster still 
 Im going to up and see her without its hurting the will
 Here Take your hand off the bellpull Five thousands waiting for you
 If youll only listen a minute and do as I bid you do
 Theyll try to prove me crazy and if you bungle they can
 And Ive only you to trust to O God why aint he a man
 Theres some waste money on marbles the same as MCullough tried 
 Marbles and mausoleums  but I call that sinful pride
 Theres some ship bodies for burial  weve carried em soldered and packed
 Down in their wills they wrote it and nobody called _them_ cracked
 But me  Ive too much money and people might    All my fault
 It come o hoping for grandsons and buying that Wokin vault
 Im sick o the ole dam business Im going back where I came
 Dick youre the son o my body and youll take charge o the same
 I want to lie by your mother ten thousand mile away
 And theyll want to send me to Woking and thats where youll earn your pay
 Ive thought it out on the quiet the same as it ought to be done 
 Quiet and decent and proper  an heres your orders my son
 You know the Line You dont though You write to the Board and tell
 Your fathers death has upset you an youre goin to cruise for a spell
 An youd like the _Mary Gloster_  Ive held her ready for this 
 Theyll put her in working order and youll take her out as she is
 Yes it was money idle when I patched her and put her aside
 Thank God I can pay for my fancies  the boat where your mother died
 By the Little Paternosters as you come to the Union Bank
 We dropped her  I think I told you  and I pricked it off where she sank 
 Tiny she looked on the grating  that oily treacly sea 
 Hundred and eighteen East remember and South just three
 Easy bearings to carry  three South  three to the dot
 But I gave MAndrew a copy in case of dying  or not
 And so youll write to MAndrew hes Chief of the Maori Line
 Theyll give him leave if you ask em and say its business o mine
 I built three boats for the Maoris an very well pleased they were
 An Ive known Mac since the Fifties and Mac knew me  and her
 After the first stroke warned me I sent him the money to keep
 Against the time youd claim it committin your dad to the deep
 For you are the son o my body and Mac was my oldest friend
 Ive never asked im to dinner but hell see it out to the end
 Stiffnecked Glasgow beggar Ive heard hes prayed for my soul
 But he couldnt lie if you paid him and hed starve before he stole
 Hell take the _Mary_ in ballast  youll find her a lively ship
 And youll take Sir Anthony Gloster that goes on is weddingtrip
 Lashed in our old deckcabin with all three portholes wide
 The kick o the screw beneath him and the round blue seas outside
 Sir Anthony Glosters carriage  our ouseflag flyin free 
 Ten thousand men on the payroll and forty freighters at sea
 He made himself and a million but this world is a fleetin show
 And hell go to the wife of is bosom the same as he ought to go 
 By the heel of the Paternosters  there isnt a chance to mistake 
 And Macll pay you the money as soon as the bubbles break
 Five thousand for six weeks cruising the staunchest freighter afloat
 And Mac hell give you your bonus the minute Im out o the boat
 Hell take you round to Macassar and youll come back alone
 He knows what I want o the _Mary_    Ill do what I please with my own
 Your mother ud call it wasteful but Ive sevenandthirty more
 Ill come in my private carriage and bid it wait at the door   
 For my son e was never a credit e muddled with books and art
 And e lived on Sir Anthonys money and e broke Sir Anthonys heart
 There isnt even a grandchild and the Gloster familys done 
 The only one you left me O mother the only one
 Harrer and Trinity College  me slavin early an late 
 An he thinks Im dying crazy and youre in Macassar Strait
 Flesh o my flesh my dearie for ever an ever amen
 That first stroke come for a warning I ought to ha gone to you then
 But  cheap repairs for a cheap un  the doctors said Id do
 Mary why didnt _you_ warn me Ive allus heeded to you
 Excep  I know  about women but you are a spirit now
 An wife they was only women and I was a man Thats how
 An a man e must go with a woman as you could not understand
 But I never talked em secrets I paid em out o hand
 Thank Gawd I can pay for my fancies Now whats five thousand to me
 For a berth off the Paternosters in the haven where I would be
 _I_ believe in the Resurrection if I read my Bible plain
 But I wouldnt trust em at Wokin were safer at sea again
 For the heart it shall go with the treasure  go down to the sea in ships
 Im sick of the hired women  Ill kiss my girl on her lips
 Ill be content with my fountain Ill drink from my own well
 And the wife of my youth shall charm me  an the rest can go to Hell
 Dickie _he_ will thats certain Ill lie in our standinbed
 An Macll take her in ballast  an she trims best by the head   
 Down by the head an sinkin her fires are drawn and cold
 And the waters splashin hollow on the skin of the empty hold 
 Churning an choking and chuckling quiet and scummy and dark 
 Full to her lower hatches and risin steady Hark
 That was the afterbulkhead    Shes flooded from stem to stern   
 Never seen death yet Dickie    Well now is your time to learn






SESTINA OF THE TRAMPROYAL


 Speakin in general I ave tried em all
 The appy roads that take you oer the world
 Speakin in general I ave found them good
 For such as cannot use one bed too long
 But must get ence the same as I ave done
 An go observin matters till they die

 What do it matter where or ow we die
 So long as weve our ealth to watch it all 
 The different ways that different things are done
 An men an women lovin in this world 
 Takin our chances as they come along
 An when they aint pretendin they are good

 In cash or credit  no it arent no good
 You ave to ave the abit or youd die
 Unless you lived your life but one day long
 Nor didnt prophesy nor fret at all
 But drew your tucker someow from the world
 An never bothered what you might ha done

 But Gawd what things are they I avent done
 Ive turned my and to most an turned it good
 In various situations round the world 
 For im that doth not work must surely die
 But thats no reason man should labour all
 Is life on one same shift lifes none so long

 Therefore from job to job Ive moved along
 Pay couldnt old me when my time was done
 For something in my ead upset me all
 Till I ad dropped whatever twas for good
 An out at sea beeld the docklights die
 An met my mate  the wind that tramps the world

 Its like a book I think this bloomin world
 Which you can read and care for just so long
 But presently you feel that you will die
 Unless you get the page youre readin done
 An turn another  likely not so good
 But what youre after is to turn em all

BARRACKROOM BALLADS


 When Omer smote is bloomin lyre
 Hed eard men sing by land an sea
 An what he thought e might require
 E went an took  the same as me

 The marketgirls an fishermen
 The shepherds an the sailors too
 They eard old songs turn up again
 But kep it quiet  same as you

 They knew e stole e knew they knowed
 They didnt tell nor make a fuss
 But winked at Omer down the road
 An e winked back  the same as us

BIRDS OF PREY MARCH

 Cheer Get on  Gawd elp the married men today

 Hoi Come up you ungry beggars to yer sorrow
 Ear them say they want their tea an want it quick

 Course its blocked the bloomin gangway up again
 Cheer O cheer the Orse Guards watchin tender oer us
 Keepin us since eight this mornin in the rain

SOLDIER AN SAILOR TOO


 As I was spittin into the Ditch aboard o the _Crocodile_
 I seed a man on a manowar got up in the Reglars style
 E was scrapin the paint from off of er plates
 an I sez to im Oo are you
 Sez e Im a Jolly  Er Majestys Jolly  soldier an sailor too
 Now is work begins by Gawd knows when and is work is never through
 E isnt one o the reglar Line nor e isnt one of the crew
 Es a kind of a giddy harumfrodite  soldier an sailor too

 An after I met im all over the world adoin all kinds of things
 Like landin isself with a Gatlin gun to talk to them eathen kings
 E sleeps in an ammick instead of a cot
 an e drills with the deck on a slew
 An e sweats like a Jolly  Er Majestys Jolly  soldier an sailor too
 For there isnt a job on the top o the earth the beggar dont know nor do 
 You can leave im at night on a bald mans ead to paddle is own canoe 
 Es a sort of a bloomin cosmopolouse  soldier an sailor too

 Weve fought em in trooper weve fought em in dock
 and drunk with em in betweens
 When they called us the seasick scullrymaids
 an we called em the Ass Marines
 But when we was down for a double fatigue from Woolwich to Bernardmyo
 We sent for the Jollies  Er Majestys Jollies  soldier an sailor too
 They think for emselves an they steal for emselves
 and they never ask whats to do
 But theyre camped an fed an theyre up an fed before our bugles blew
 Ho they aint no limpin procrastitutes  soldier an sailor too

 You may say we are fond of an arnesscut or ootin in barrickyards
 Or startin a Board School mutiny along o the Onion Guards
 But once in a while we can finish in style for the ends of the earth to view
 The same as the Jollies  Er Majestys Jollies  soldier an sailor too
 They come of our lot they was brothers to us
 they was beggars wed met an knew
 Yes barrin an inch in the chest an the arm they was doubles o me an you
 For they werent no special chrysanthemums  soldier an sailor too

 To take your chance in the thick of a rush with firing all about
 Is nothing so bad when youve cover to and an leave an likin to shout
 But to stand an be still to the _Birkenead_ drill
 is a damn tough bullet to chew
 An they done it the Jollies  Er Majestys Jollies 
 soldier an sailor too
 Their work was done when it adnt begun they was younger nor me an you
 Their choice it was plain between drownin in eaps
 an bein mopped by the screw
 So they stood an was still to the _Birkenead_ drill soldier an sailor too

 Were most of us liars were arf of us thieves
 an the rest are as rank as can be
 But once in a while we can finish in style
 which I ope it wont appen to me
 But it makes you think better o you an your friends
 an the work you may ave to do
 When you think o the sinkin _Victorier_s Jollies  soldier an sailor too
 Now there isnt no room for to say ye dont know 
 they ave proved it plain and true 
 That whether its Widow or whether its ship Victoriers work is to do
 An they done it the Jollies  Er Majestys Jollies 
 soldier an sailor too

THAT DAY


 It got beyond all orders an it got beyond all ope
 It got to shammin wounded an retirin from the alt
 Ole companies was lookin for the nearest road to slope
 It were just a bloomin knockout  an our fault

 Now there aint no chorus ere to give
 Nor there aint no band to play
 An I wish I was dead fore I done what I did
 Or seen what I seed that day

 We was sick o bein punished an we let em know it too
 An a companycommander up an it us with a sword
 An some one shouted Ook it an it come to _sovekipoo_
 An we chucked our rifles from us  O my Gawd

 There was thirty dead an wounded on the ground we wouldnt keep 
 No there wasnt more than twenty when the front begun to go
 But Christ along the line o flight they cut us up like sheep
 An that was all we gained by doin so

 I eard the knives beind me but I dursnt face my man
 Nor I dont know where I went to cause I didnt alt to see
 Till I eard a beggar squealin out for quarter as e ran
 An I thought I knew the voice an  it was me

 We was idin under bedsteads more than arf a march away
 We was lyin up like rabbits all about the countryside
 An the major cursed is Maker cause e lived to see that day
 An the colonel broke is sword acrost an cried

 We was rotten fore we started  we was never disci_plined_
 We made it out a favour if an order was obeyed
 Yes every little drummer ad is rights an wrongs to mind
 So we had to pay for teachin  an we paid

 The papers id it andsome but you know the Army knows
 We was put to groomin camels till the regiments withdrew
 An they gave us each a medal for subduin Englands foes
 An I ope you like my song  because its true

 An there aint no chorus ere to give
 Nor there aint no band to play
 But I wish I was dead fore I done what I did
 Or seen what I seed that day




THE MEN THAT FOUGHT AT MINDEN

 A Song of Instruction


 The men that fought at Minden they was rookies in their time 
 So was them that fought at Waterloo
 All the ole command yuss from Minden to Maiwand
 They was once dam sweeps like you

 Then do not be discouraged Eaven is your elper
 Well learn you not to forget
 An you mustnt swear an curse or youll only catch it worse
 For well make you soldiers yet

 The men that fought at Minden they ad stocks beneath their chins
 Six inch igh an more
 But fatigue it was their pride and they _would_ not be denied
 To clean the cookouse floor

 The men that fought at Minden they had anarchistic bombs
 Served to em by name of andgrenades
 But they got it in the eye same as you will byanby
 When they clubbed their fieldparades

 The men that fought at Minden they ad buttons up an down
 Twoantwenty dozen of em told
 But they didnt grouse an shirk at an hours extry work
 They kept em bright as gold

 The men that fought at Minden they was armed with musketoons
 Also they was drilled by alberdiers
 I dont know what they were but the sergeants took good care
 They washed beind their ears

 The men that fought at Minden they ad ever cash in and
 Which they did not bank nor save
 But spent it gay an free on their betters  such as me 
 For the good advice I gave

 The men that fought at Minden they was civil  yuss they was 
 Never didnt talk o rights an wrongs
 But they got it with the toe same as you will get it  so 
 For interrupting songs

 The men that fought at Minden they was several other things
 Which I dont remember clear
 But _thats_ the reason why now the sixyear men are dry
 The rooks will stand the beer

 Then do not be discouraged Eaven is your elper
 Well learn you not to forget
 An you mustnt swear an curse or youll only catch it worse
 For well make you soldiers yet

 Soldiers yet if youve got it in you 
 All for the sake of the Core
 Soldiers yet if we ave to skin you 
 Run an get the beer Johnny Raw  Johnny Raw
 Ho run an get the beer Johnny Raw




CHOLERA CAMP


 Weve got the cholerer in camp  its worse than forty fights
 Were dyin in the wilderness the same as Isrulites
 Its before us an beind us an we cannot get away
 An the doctors just reported weve ten more today

 Oh strike your camp an go the Bugles callin
 The Rains are fallin 
 The dead are bushed an stoned to keep em safe below
 The Bands adoin all she knows to cheer us
 The Chaplains gone and prayed to Gawd to ear us 
 To ear us 
 O Lord for its akillin of us so

 Since August when it started its been stickin to our tail
 Though theyve ad us out by marches an theyve ad us back by rail
 But it runs as fast as trooptrains and we cannot get away
 An the sicklist to the Colonel makes ten more today

 There aint no fun in women nor there aint no bite to drink
 Its much too wet for shootin we can only march and think
 An at evenin down the _nullahs_ we can ear the jackals say
 Get up you rotten beggars youve ten more today

 Twould make a monkey cough to see our way o doin things 
 Lieutenants takin companies an captains takin wings
 An Lances actin Sergeants  eight file to obey 
 For weve lots o quick promotion on ten deaths a day

 Our Colonels white an twitterly  e gets no sleep nor food
 But mucks about in orspital where nothing does no good
 E sends us eaps o comforts all bought from is pay 
 But there arent much comfort andy on ten deaths a day

 Our Chaplains got a banjo an a skinny mule e rides
 An the stuff e says an sings us Lord it makes us split our sides
 With is black coattails abobbin to _Tarara Boomderay_
 Es the proper kind o _padre_ for ten deaths a day

 An Father Victor elps im with our Roman Catholicks 
 He knows an eap of Irish songs an rummy conjurin tricks
 An the two they works together when it comes to play or pray
 So we keep the ball arollin on ten deaths a day

 Weve got the cholerer in camp  weve got it ot an sweet
 It aint no Christmas dinner but its elped an we must eat
 Weve gone beyond the funkin cause weve found it doesnt pay
 An were rockin round the Districk on ten deaths a day

 Then strike your camp an go the Rains are fallin
 The Bugles callin
 The dead are bushed an stoned to keep em safe below
 An them that do not like it they can lump it
 An them that cannot stand it they can jump it
 Weve got to die somewhere  some way  someow 
 We might as well begin to do it now
 Then Number One let down the tentpole slow
 Knock out the pegs an old the corners  so
 Fold in the flies furl up the ropes an stow
 Oh strike  oh strike your camp an go
 Gawd elp us




THE LADIES


 Ive taken my fun where Ive found it
 Ive rogued an Ive ranged in my time
 Ive ad my pickin o sweetearts
 An four o the lot was prime
 One was an arfcaste widow
 One was a woman at Prome
 One was the wife of a _jemadarsais_ Headgroom
 An one is a girl at ome

 Now I arent no and with the ladies
 For takin em all along
 You never can say till youve tried em
 An then you are like to be wrong
 Theres times when youll think that you mightnt
 Theres times when youll know that you might
 But the things you will learn from the Yellow an Brown
 Theyll elp you a lot with the White

 I was a young un at Oogli
 Shy as a girl to begin
 Aggie de Castrer she made me
 An Aggie was clever as sin
 Older than me but my first un 
 More like a mother she were 
 Showed me the way to promotion an pay
 An I learned about women from er

 Then I was ordered to Burma
 Actin in charge o Bazar
 An I got me a tiddy live eathen
 Through buyin supplies off er pa
 Funny an yellow an faithful 
 Doll in a teacup she were
 But we lived on the square like a truemarried pair
 An I learned about women from er

 Then we was shifted to Neemuch
 Or I might ha been keepin er now
 An I took with a shiny shedevil
 The wife of a nigger at Mhow
 Taught me the gipsyfolks _bolee_ Slang
 Kind o volcano she were
 For she knifed me one night cause I wished she was white
 And I learned about women from er

 Then I come ome in the trooper
 Long of a kid o sixteen 
 Girl from a convent at Meerut
 The straightest I ever ave seen
 Love at first sight was er trouble
 _She_ didnt know what it were
 An I wouldnt do such cause I liked er too much
 But  I learned about women from er

 Ive taken my fun where Ive found it
 An now I must pay for my fun
 For the more you ave known o the others
 The less will you settle to one
 An the end of its sittin and thinkin
 An dreamin Hellfires to see
 So be warned by my lot which I know you will not
 An learn about women from me

 What did the Colonels Lady think
 Nobody never knew
 Somebody asked the Sergeants wife
 _An_ she told em true
 When you get to a man in the case
 Theyre like as a row of pins 
 For the Colonels Lady an Judy OGrady
 Are sisters under their skins




BILL AWKINS


 As anybody seen Bill Awkins
 Now ow in the devil would I know
 Es taken my girl out walkin
 An Ive got to tell im so 
 Gawd  bless  im
 Ive got to tell im so

 Dyer know what es like Bill Awkins
 Now what in the devil would I care
 Es the livin breathin image of an organgrinders monkey
 With a pound of grease in is air 
 Gawd  bless  im
 An a pound o grease in is air

 Now what in the devil ud ye do
 Id open is cheek to is chinstrap buckle
 An bung up is both eyes too 
 Gawd  bless  im
 An bung up is both eyes too

 Look ere where e comes Bill Awkins
 Now what in the devil will you say
 It isnt fit an proper to be fightin on a Sunday
 So Ill pass im the time o day 
 Gawd  bless  im
 Ill pass im the time o day

 Till mornin waked the parrots
 An that dam brainfeverbird

 Changin pickets in our ead

 Full oft on Guvment service
 This rovin foot ath pressed
 An bore fraternal greetins
 To the Lodges east an west
 Accordin as commanded
 From Kohat to Singapore
 But I wish that I might see them
 In my MotherLodge once more

 I wish that I might see them

 With the trichies smellin pleasant
 An the _hogdarn_ passin down Cigarlighter
 An the old khansamah snorin Butler
 On the bottlekhana floor Pantry
 Like a Master in good standing
 With my MotherLodge once more

 Outside  Sergeant Sir Salute Salaam
 Inside  Brother an it doesnt do no arm

THE JACKET


 Through the Plagues of Egyp we was chasin Arabi
 Gettin down an shovin in the sun
 An you might ave called us dirty an you might ha called us dry
 An you might ave eard us talkin at the gun
 But the Captain ad is jacket an the jacket it was new 
 Orse Gunners listen to my song
 An the wettin of the jacket is the proper thing to do
 Nor we didnt keep im waitin very long

 One day they gave us orders for to shell a sand redoubt
 Loadin down the axlearms with case
 But the Captain knew is dooty an he took the crackers out
 An he put some proper liquor in its place
 An the Captain saw the shrapnel which is sixanthirty clear
 Orse Gunners listen to my song
 Will you draw the weight sez e or will you draw the beer
 An we didnt keep im waitin very long
 _For the Captain etc_

 Then we trotted gentle not to break the bloomin glass
 Though the Arabites ad all their ranges marked
 But we dursnt ardly gallop for the most was bottled Bass
 An wed dreamed of it since we was disembarked
 So we fired economic with the shells we ad in and
 Orse Gunners listen to my song
 But the beggars under cover ad the impidence to stand
 An we couldnt keep em waitin very long
 _And the Captain etc_

 So we finished arf the liquor an the Captain took champagne
 An the Arabites was shootin all the while
 An we left our wounded appy with the empties on the plain
 An we used the bloomin guns for projectile
 We limbered up an galloped  there were nothin else to do 
 Orse Gunners listen to my song
 An the Battery came aboundin like a boundin kangaroo
 But they didnt watch us comin very long
 _As the Captain etc_

 We was goin most extended  we was drivin very fine
 An the Arabites were loosin igh an wide
 Till the Captain took the glassy with a rattlin right incline
 An we dropped upon their eads the other side
 Then we give em quarter  such as adnt up and cut
 Orse Gunners listen to my song
 An the Captain stood a limberful of fizzy  somethin Brutt
 But we didnt leave it fizzing very long
 _For the Captain etc_

 We might ha been courtmartialled but it all come out all right
 When they signalled us to join the main command
 There was every round expended there was every gunner tight
 An the Captain waved a corkscrew in is and
 _But the Captain ad is jacket etc_




THE EATHEN


 The eathen in is blindness bows down to wood an stone
 E dont obey no orders unless they is is own
 E keeps is sidearms awful e leaves em all about
 An then comes up the regiment an pokes the eathen out

 All along o dirtiness all along o mess
 All along o doin things rathermoreorless
 All along of abbynay kul an hazarho 
 Mind you keep your rifle an yourself jus so

 _ abbynay Not now kul Tomorrow hazarho
 Wait a bit_

 The young recruit is aughty  e drafs from Gawd knows where
 They bid im show is stockins an lay is mattress square
 E calls it bloomin nonsense  e doesnt know no more 
 An then up comes is Company an kicks im round the floor

 The young recruit is ammered  e takes it very ard
 E angs is ead an mutters  e sulks about the yard
 E talks o cruel tyrants ell swing for byanby
 An the others ears an mocks im an the boy goes orf to cry

 The young recruit is silly  e thinks o suicide
 Es lost is gutterdevil e asnt got is pride
 But day by day they kicks im which elps im on a bit
 Till e finds isself one mornin with a full an proper kit

 Gettin clear o dirtiness gettin done with mess
 Gettin shut o doin things rathermoreorless
 Not so fond of abbynay kul nor hazarho
 Learns to keep is rifle an isself jus so

 The young recruit is appy  e throws a chest to suit
 You see im grow mustaches you ear im slap is boot
 E learns to drop the bloodies from every word e slings
 An e shows an ealthy brisket when e strips for bars an rings

 The crueltyrantsergeants they watch im arf a year
 They watch im with is comrades they watch im with is beer
 They watch im with the women at the regimental dance
 And the crueltyrantsergeants send is name along for Lance

 An now es arf o nothin an all a private yet
 Is room they up an rags im to see what they will get
 They rags im low an cunnin each dirty trick they can
 But e learns to sweat is temper an e learns to sweat is man

 An last a ColourSergeant as such to be obeyed
 E schools is men at cricket e tells em on parade
 They sees em quick an andy uncommon set an smart
 An so e talks to orficers which ave the Core at eart

 E learns to do is watchin without it showin plain
 E learns to save a dummy an shove im straight again
 E learns to check a ranker thats buyin leave to shirk
 An e learns to make men like im so theyll learn to like their work

 An when it comes to marchin hell see their socks are right
 An when it comes to action e shows em ow to sight
 E knows their ways of thinkin and just whats in their mind
 E knows when they are takin on an when theyve fell beind

 E knows each talkin corpril that leads a squad astray
 E feels is innards eavin is bowels givin way
 E sees the bluewhite faces all tryin ard to grin
 An e stands an waits an suffers till its time to cap em in

 An now the hugly bullets come peckin through the dust
 An no one wants to face em but every beggar must
 So like a man in irons which isnt glad to go
 They moves em off by companies uncommon stiff an slow

 Of all is five years schoolin they dont remember much
 Excep the not retreatin the step an keepin touch
 It looks like teachin wasted when they duck an spread an op
 But if e adnt learned em theyd be all about the shop

 An now its Oo goes backward an now its Oo comes on
 And now its Get the doolies an now the captains gone
 An now its bloody murder but all the while they ear
 Is voice the same as barrick drill ashepherdin the rear

 Es just as sick as they are is eart is like to split
 But e works em works em works em till he feels em take the bit
 The rest is oldin steady till the watchful bugles play
 An e lifts em lifts em lifts em through the charge that wins the day

 The eathen in is blindness bows down to wood an stone
 E dont obey no orders unless they is is own
 The eathen in is blindness must end where e began
 But the backbone of the Army is the noncommissioned man

 Keep away from dirtiness  keep away from mess
 Dont get into doin things rathermoreorless
 Lets ha done with abbynay kul an hazarho
 Mind you keep your rifle an yourself jus so

 There was me ed kissed in the sentrybox
 As I ave not told in my song
 But I took my oath which were Bible truth
 I adnt seen nothin wrong

 Theres them thats ot an aughty

 But there comes a night when the best gets tight
 And then turns out the Guard

 In every kind o way
 But most depends on makin friends
 With Privit Thomas A

 Well elp im for is mother an ell elp us byanby




MARY PITY WOMEN


 You call yourself a man
 For all you used to swear

 You done the worst you know
 I ate you grinnin there   
 Ah Gawd I love you so

 Nice while it lasted an now it is over 
 Tear out your eart an goodbye to your lover
 Whats the use o grievin when the mother that bore you
 Mary pity women knew it all before you

 It arent no false alarm
 The finish to your fun
 You  you ave brung the arm
 An Im the ruined one
 An now youll off an run
 With some new fool in tow
 Your eart You avent none   
 Ah Gawd I love you so

 When a man is tired there is naught will bind im
 All e solemn promised e will shove beind im
 Whats the good o prayin for The Wrath to strike im
 Mary pity women when the rest are like im

 But this  but this is you
 So elp me Christ its true
 Where can I ide or go
 You coward through and through   
 Ah Gawd I love you so

 All the more you give em the less are they for givin 
 Love lies dead an you cannot kiss im livin
 Down the road e led you there is no returnin
 Mary pity women but youre late in learnin

 Youd like to treat me fair

 The name an lines to show
 An not to be an ore   
 Ah Gawd I love you so

 Whats the good o pleadin when the mother that bore you
 Mary pity women knew it all before you
 Sleep on is promises an wake to your sorrow
 Mary pity women for we sail tomorrow




FOR TO ADMIRE


 The Injian Ocean sets an smiles
 So sof so bright so bloomin blue
 There arent a wave for miles an miles
 Excep the jiggle from the screw
 The ship is swep the day is done
 The bugles gone for smoke and play
 An black agin the settin sun
 The Lascar sings _Hum deckty hai_ Im looking out

 For to admire an for to see
 For to beold this world so wide 
 It never done no good to me
 But I cant drop it if I tried

 I see the sergeants pitchin quoits
 I ear the women laugh an talk
 I spy upon the quarterdeck
 The orficers an lydies walk
 I thinks about the things that was
 An leans an looks acrost the sea
 Till spite of all the crowded ship
 Theres no one lef alive but me

 The things that was which I ave seen
 In barrick camp an action too
 I tells them over by myself
 An sometimes wonders if theyre true
 For they was odd  most awful odd 
 But all the same now they are oer
 There must be eaps o plenty such
 An if I wait Ill see some more

 Oh I ave come upon the books
 An frequent broke a barrick rule
 An stood beside an watched myself
 Beavin like a bloomin fool
 I paid my price for findin out
 Nor never grutched the price I paid
 But sat in Clink without my boots
 Admirin ow the world was made

 Beold a crowd upon the beam
 An umped above the sea appears
 Old Aden like a barrickstove
 That no ones lit for years an years
 I passed by that when I began
 An I go ome the road I came
 A timeexpired soldierman
 With six years service to is name

 My girl she said Oh stay with me
 My mother eld me to er breast
 Theyve never written none an so
 They must ave gone with all the rest 
 With all the rest which I ave seen
 An found an known an met along
 I cannot say the things I feel
 And so I sing my evenin song

 For to admire an for to see
 For to beold this world so wide 
 It never done no good to me
 But I cant drop it if I tried




LENVOI


 When Earths last picture is painted and the tubes are twisted and dried
 When the oldest colours have faded and the youngest critic has died
 We shall rest and faith we shall need it  lie down for an aeon or two
 Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall put us to work anew

 And those that were good shall be happy they shall sit in a golden chair
 They shall splash at a tenleague canvas with brushes of comets hair
 They shall find real saints to draw from  Magdalene Peter and Paul
 They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all

 And only the Master shall praise us and only the Master shall blame
 And no one shall work for money and no one shall work for fame
 But each for the joy of the working and each in his separate star
 Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God of Things as They Are
