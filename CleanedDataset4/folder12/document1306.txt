ENOCH SOAMES




When a book about the literature of the eighteennineties was given by
Mr Holbrook Jackson to the world I looked eagerly in the index for
SOAMES ENOCH I had feared he would not be there He was not there
But everybody else was Many writers whom I had quite forgotten or
remembered but faintly lived again for me they and their work in Mr
Holbrook Jacksons pages The book was as thorough as it was brilliantly
written And thus the omission found by me was an all the deadlier
record of poor Soames failure to impress himself on his decade

I daresay I am the only person who noticed the omission Soames had
failed so piteously as all that Nor is there a counterpoise in the
thought that if he had had some measure of success he might have passed
like those others out of my mind to return only at the historians
beck It is true that had his gifts such as they were been
acknowledged in his lifetime he would never have made the bargain I
saw him makethat strange bargain whose results have kept him always in
the foreground of my memory But it is from those very results that the
full piteousness of him glares out

Not my compassion however impels me to write of him For his sake
poor fellow I should be inclined to keep my pen out of the ink It is
ill to deride the dead And how can I write about Enoch Soames without
making him ridiculous Or rather how am I to hush up the horrid fact
that he WAS ridiculous I shall not be able to do that Yet sooner or
later write about him I must You will see in due course that I have
no option And I may as well get the thing done now


In the Summer Term of 93 a bolt from the blue flashed down on Oxford
It drove deep it hurtlingly embedded itself in the soil Dons and
undergraduates stood around rather pale discussing nothing but it
Whence came it this meteorite From Paris Its name Will Rothenstein
Its aim To do a series of twentyfour portraits in lithograph These
were to be published from the Bodley Head London The matter was
urgent Already the Warden of A and the Master of B and the Regius
Professor of C had meekly sat Dignified and doddering old men who
had never consented to sit to any one could not withstand this dynamic
little stranger He did not sue he invited he did not invite he
commanded He was twentyone years old He wore spectacles that flashed
more than any other pair ever seen He was a wit He was brimful of
ideas He knew Whistler He knew Edmond de Goncourt He knew every one
in Paris He knew them all by heart He was Paris in Oxford It was
whispered that so soon as he had polished off his selection of dons
he was going to include a few undergraduates It was a proud day for me
when IIwas included I liked Rothenstein not less than I feared him
and there arose between us a friendship that has grown ever warmer and
been more and more valued by me with every passing year

At the end of Term he settled inor rather meteoritically
intoLondon It was to him I owed my first knowledge of that forever
enchanting little worldinitself Chelsea and my first acquaintance
with Walter Sickert and other august elders who dwelt there It was
Rothenstein that took me to see in Cambridge Street Pimlico a young
man whose drawings were already famous among the fewAubrey Beardsley
by name With Rothenstein I paid my first visit to the Bodley Head
By him I was inducted into another haunt of intellect and daring the
domino room of the Cafe Royal

There on that October eveningthere in that exuberant vista of
gilding and crimson velvet set amidst all those opposing mirrors and
upholding caryatids with fumes of tobacco ever rising to the painted
and pagan ceiling and with the hum of presumably cynical conversation
broken into so sharply now and again by the clatter of dominoes shuffled
on marble tables I drew a deep breath and This indeed said I to
myself is life

It was the hour before dinner We drank vermouth Those who knew
Rothenstein were pointing him out to those who knew him only by name
Men were constantly coming in through the swingdoors and wandering
slowly up and down in search of vacant tables or of tables occupied by
friends One of these rovers interested me because I was sure he wanted
to catch Rothensteins eye He had twice passed our table with a
hesitating look but Rothenstein in the thick of a disquisition on
Puvis de Chavannes had not seen him He was a stooping shambling
person rather tall very pale with longish and brownish hair He had
a thin vague beardor rather he had a chin on which a large number
of hairs weakly curled and clustered to cover its retreat He was an
oddlooking person but in the nineties odd apparitions were more
frequent I think than they are now The young writers of that eraand
I was sure this man was a writerstrove earnestly to be distinct in
aspect This man had striven unsuccessfully He wore a soft black hat
of clerical kind but of Bohemian intention and a grey waterproof cape
which perhaps because it was waterproof failed to be romantic I
decided that dim was the mot juste for him I had already essayed to
write and was immensely keen on the mot juste that Holy Grail of the
period

The dim man was now again approaching our table and this time he made
up his mind to pause in front of it You dont remember me he said in
a toneless voice

Rothenstein brightly focussed him Yes I do he replied after a
moment with pride rather than effusionpride in a retentive memory
Edwin Soames

Enoch Soames said Enoch

Enoch Soames repeated Rothenstein in a tone implying that it was
enough to have hit on the surname We met in Paris two or three times
when you were living there We met at the Cafe Groche

And I came to your studio once

Oh yes I was sorry I was out

But you were in You showed me some of your paintings you know I
hear youre in Chelsea now

Yes

I almost wondered that Mr Soames did not after this monosyllable pass
along He stood patiently there rather like a dumb animal rather like
a donkey looking over a gate A sad figure his It occurred to me that
hungry was perhaps the mot juste for him buthungry for what He
looked as if he had little appetite for anything I was sorry for him
and Rothenstein though he had not invited him to Chelsea did ask him
to sit down and have something to drink

Seated he was more selfassertive He flung back the wings of his cape
with a gesture whichhad not those wings been waterproofmight
have seemed to hurl defiance at things in general And he ordered an
absinthe Je me tiens toujours fidele he told Rothenstein a la
sorciere glauque

It is bad for you said Rothenstein dryly

Nothing is bad for one answered Soames Dans ce monde il ny a ni de
bien ni de mal

Nothing good and nothing bad How do you mean

I explained it all in the preface to Negations

Negations

Yes I gave you a copy of it

Oh yes of course But did you explainfor instancethat there was no
such thing as bad or good grammar

Nno said Soames Of course in Art there is the good and the evil
But in Lifeno He was rolling a cigarette He had weak white hands
not well washed and with fingertips much stained by nicotine In Life
there are illusions of good and evil buthis voice trailed away to a
murmur in which the words vieux jeu and rococo were faintly audible
I think he felt he was not doing himself justice and feared that
Rothenstein was going to point out fallacies Anyhow he cleared his
throat and said Parlons dautre chose

It occurs to you that he was a fool It didnt to me I was young and
had not the clarity of judgment that Rothenstein already had Soames was
quite five or six years older than either of us Also he had written a
book

It was wonderful to have written a book

If Rothenstein had not been there I should have revered Soames Even as
it was I respected him And I was very near indeed to reverence when
he said he had another book coming out soon I asked if I might ask what
kind of book it was to be

My poems he answered Rothenstein asked if this was to be the title
of the book The poet meditated on this suggestion but said he rather
thought of giving the book no title at all If a book is good in
itself he murmured waving his cigarette

Rothenstein objected that absence of title might be bad for the sale
of a book If he urged I went into a booksellers and said simply
Have you got or Have you a copy of how would they know what I
wanted

Oh of course I should have my name on the cover Soames answered
earnestly And I rather want he added looking hard at Rothenstein
to have a drawing of myself as frontispiece Rothenstein admitted
that this was a capital idea and mentioned that he was going into the
country and would be there for some time He then looked at his watch
exclaimed at the hour paid the waiter and went away with me to dinner
Soames remained at his post of fidelity to the glaucous witch

Why were you so determined not to draw him I asked

Draw him Him How can one draw a man who doesnt exist

He is dim I admitted But my mot juste fell flat Rothenstein
repeated that Soames was nonexistent

Still Soames had written a book I asked if Rothenstein had read
Negations He said he had looked into it but he added crisply
I dont profess to know anything about writing A reservation very
characteristic of the period Painters would not then allow that any one
outside their own order had a right to any opinion about painting This
law graven on the tablets brought down by Whistler from the summit of
Fujiyama imposed certain limitations If other arts than painting were
not utterly unintelligible to all but the men who practised them
the law totteredthe Monroe Doctrine as it were did not hold good
Therefore no painter would offer an opinion of a book without warning
you at any rate that his opinion was worthless No one is a better judge
of literature than Rothenstein but it wouldnt have done to tell him
so in those days and I knew that I must form an unaided judgment on
Negations

Not to buy a book of which I had met the author face to face would
have been for me in those days an impossible act of selfdenial When
I returned to Oxford for the Christmas Term I had duly secured
Negations I used to keep it lying carelessly on the table in my room
and whenever a friend took it up and asked what it was about I would
say Oh its rather a remarkable book Its by a man whom I know Just
what it was about I never was able to say Head or tail was just what
I hadnt made of that slim green volume I found in the preface no clue
to the exiguous labyrinth of contents and in that labyrinth nothing to
explain the preface


Lean near to life Lean very nearnearer

Life is web and therein nor warp nor woof is but web only

It is for this I am Catholick in church and in thought yet do let
swift Mood weave there what the shuttle of Mood wills


These were the opening phrases of the preface but those which followed
were less easy to understand Then came Stark A Conte about a
midinette who so far as I could gather murdered or was about to
murder a mannequin It was rather like a story by Catulle Mendes in
which the translator had either skipped or cut out every alternate
sentence Next a dialogue between Pan and St Ursulalacking I felt
in snap Next some aphorisms entitled Aphorismata spelled in
Greek Throughout in fact there was a great variety of form and
the forms had evidently been wrought with much care It was rather the
substance that eluded me Was there I wondered any substance at all
It did now occur to me suppose Enoch Soames was a fool Up cropped a
rival hypothesis suppose _I_ was I inclined to give Soames the benefit
of the doubt I had read LApresmidi dun Faune without extracting a
glimmer of meaning Yet Mallarmeof coursewas a Master How was I to
know that Soames wasnt another There was a sort of music in his
prose not indeed arresting but perhaps I thought haunting and laden
perhaps with meanings as deep as Mallarmes own I awaited his poems
with an open mind

And I looked forward to them with positive impatience after I had had a
second meeting with him This was on an evening in January Going into
the aforesaid domino room I passed a table at which sat a pale man with
an open book before him He looked from his book to me and I looked
back over my shoulder with a vague sense that I ought to have recognised
him I returned to pay my respects After exchanging a few words I said
with a glance to the open book I see I am interrupting you and was
about to pass on but I prefer Soames replied in his toneless voice
to be interrupted and I obeyed his gesture that I should sit down

I asked him if he often read here Yes things of this kind I read
here he answered indicating the title of his bookThe Poems of
Shelley

Anything that you reallyand I was going to say admire But I
cautiously left my sentence unfinished and was glad that I had done so
for he said with unwonted emphasis Anything secondrate

I had read little of Shelley but Of course I murmured hes very
uneven

I should have thought evenness was just what was wrong with him A
deadly evenness Thats why I read him here The noise of this place
breaks the rhythm Hes tolerable here Soames took up the book and
glanced through the pages He laughed Soames laugh was a short single
and mirthless sound from the throat unaccompanied by any movement of
the face or brightening of the eyes What a period he uttered laying
the book down And What a country he added

I asked rather nervously if he didnt think Keats had more or less held
his own against the drawbacks of time and place He admitted that there
were passages in Keats but did not specify them Of the older men
as he called them he seemed to like only Milton Milton he said
wasnt sentimental Also Milton had a dark insight And again I
can always read Milton in the readingroom

The readingroom

Of the British Museum I go there every day

You do Ive only been there once Im afraid I found it rather a
depressing place Itit seemed to sap ones vitality

It does Thats why I go there The lower ones vitality the more
sensitive one is to great art I live near the Museum I have rooms in
Dyott Street

And you go round to the readingroom to read Milton

Usually Milton He looked at me It was Milton he certificatively
added who converted me to Diabolism

Diabolism Oh yes Really said I with that vague discomfort and that
intense desire to be polite which one feels when a man speaks of his own
religion Youworship the Devil

Soames shook his head Its not exactly worship he qualified sipping
his absinthe Its more a matter of trusting and encouraging

Ah yes But I had rather gathered from the preface to Negations
that you were aa Catholic

Je letais a cette epoque Perhaps I still am Yes Im a Catholic
Diabolist

This profession he made in an almost cursory tone I could see that what
was upmost in his mind was the fact that I had read Negations His
pale eyes had for the first time gleamed I felt as one who is about to
be examined viva voce on the very subject in which he is shakiest I
hastily asked him how soon his poems were to be published Next week
he told me

And are they to be published without a title

No I found a title at last But I shant tell you what it is as
though I had been so impertinent as to inquire I am not sure that
it wholly satisfies me But it is the best I can find It suggests
something of the quality of the poems Strange growths natural and
wild yet exquisite he added and manyhued and full of poisons

I asked him what he thought of Baudelaire He uttered the snort that
was his laugh and Baudelaire he said was a bourgeois malgre lui
France had had only one poet Villon and twothirds of Villon were
sheer journalism Verlaine was an epicier malgre lui Altogether
rather to my surprise he rated French literature lower than English
There were passages in Villiers de lIsleAdam But I he summed up
owe nothing to France He nodded at me Youll see he predicted

I did not when the time came quite see that I thought the author of
Fungoids didunconsciously of courseowe something to the young
Parisian decadents or to the young English ones who owed something to
THEM I still think so The little bookbought by me in Oxfordlies
before me as I write Its pale grey buckram cover and silver lettering
have not worn well Nor have its contents Through these with a
melancholy interest I have again been looking They are not much But
at the time of their publication I had a vague suspicion that they MIGHT
be I suppose it is my capacity for faith not poor Soames work that
is weaker than it once was


 TO A YOUNG WOMAN

 Thou art who hast not been
 Pale tunes irresolute
 And traceries of old sounds
 Blown from a rotted flute
 Mingle with noise of cymbals rouged with rust
 Nor not strange forms and epicene
 Lie bleeding in the dust
 Being wounded with wounds

 For this it is
 That in thy counterpart
 Of agelong mockeries
 Thou hast not been nor art


There seemed to me a certain inconsistency as between the first and last
lines of this I tried with bent brows to resolve the discord But I
did not take my failure as wholly incompatible with a meaning in Soames
mind Might it not rather indicate the depth of his meaning As for the
craftsmanship rouged with rust seemed to me a fine stroke and nor
not instead of and had a curious felicity I wondered who the Young
Woman was and what she had made of it all I sadly suspect that Soames
could not have made more of it than she Yet even now if one doesnt
try to make any sense at all of the poem and reads it just for the
sound there is a certain grace of cadence Soames was an artistin so
far as he was anything poor fellow

It seemed to me when first I read Fungoids that oddly enough the
Diabolistic side of him was the best Diabolism seemed to be a cheerful
even a wholesome influence in his life


 NOCTURNE

 Round and round the shutterd Square
 I strolld with the Devils arm in mine
 No sound but the scrape of his hoofs was there
 And the ring of his laughter and mine
 We had drunk black wine

 I screamd I will race you Master
 What matter he shriekd tonight
 Which of us runs the faster
 There is nothing to fear tonight
 In the foul moons light

 Then I lookd him in the eyes
 And I laughd full shrill at the lie he told
 And the gnawing fear he would fain disguise
 It was true what Id time and again been told
 He was oldold


There was I felt quite a swing about that first stanzaa joyous
and rollicking note of comradeship The second was slightly hysterical
perhaps But I liked the third it was so bracingly unorthodox even
according to the tenets of Soames peculiar sect in the faith Not much
trusting and encouraging here Soames triumphantly exposing the Devil
as a liar and laughing full shrill cut a quite heartening figure
I thoughtthen Now in the light of what befell none of his poems
depresses me so much as Nocturne

I looked out for what the metropolitan reviewers would have to say They
seemed to fall into two classes those who had little to say and those
who had nothing The second class was the larger and the words of the
first were cold insomuch that

 Strikes a note of modernity throughout These tripping
 numbersPreston Telegraph

was the only lure offered in advertisements by Soames publisher I had
hopes that when next I met the poet I could congratulate him on having
made a stir for I fancied he was not so sure of his intrinsic greatness
as he seemed I was but able to say rather coarsely when next I did
see him that I hoped Fungoids was selling splendidly He looked at
me across his glass of absinthe and asked if I had bought a copy His
publisher had told him that three had been sold I laughed as at a
jest

You dont suppose I CARE do you he said with something like a
snarl I disclaimed the notion He added that he was not a tradesman I
said mildly that I wasnt either and murmured that an artist who gave
truly new and great things to the world had always to wait long for
recognition He said he cared not a sou for recognition I agreed that
the act of creation was its own reward

His moroseness might have alienated me if I had regarded myself as a
nobody But ah hadnt both John Lane and Aubrey Beardsley suggested
that I should write an essay for the great new venture that was
afootThe Yellow Book And hadnt Henry Harland as editor accepted
my essay And wasnt it to be in the very first number At Oxford I
was still in statu pupillari In London I regarded myself as very much
indeed a graduate nowone whom no Soames could ruffle Partly to show
off partly in sheer goodwill I told Soames he ought to contribute to
The Yellow Book He uttered from the throat a sound of scorn for that
publication

Nevertheless I did a day or two later tentatively ask Harland if he
knew anything of the work of a man called Enoch Soames Harland paused
in the midst of his characteristic stride around the room threw up his
hands towards the ceiling and groaned aloud he had often met that
absurd creature in Paris and this very morning had received some poems
in manuscript from him

Has he NO talent I asked

He has an income Hes all right Harland was the most joyous of men
and most generous of critics and he hated to talk of anything about
which he couldnt be enthusiastic So I dropped the subject of Soames
The news that Soames had an income did take the edge off solicitude I
learned afterwards that he was the son of an unsuccessful and deceased
bookseller in Preston but had inherited an annuity of 300 pounds from
a married aunt and had no surviving relatives of any kind Materially
then he was all right But there was still a spiritual pathos about
him sharpened for me now by the possibility that even the praises of
The Preston Telegraph might not have been forthcoming had he not been
the son of a Preston man He had a sort of weak doggedness which I
could not but admire Neither he nor his work received the slightest
encouragement but he persisted in behaving as a personage always
he kept his dingy little flag flying Wherever congregated the
jeunes feroces of the arts in whatever Soho restaurant they had just
discovered in whatever musichall they were most frequenting there was
Soames in the midst of them or rather on the fringe of them a dim but
inevitable figure He never sought to propitiate his fellowwriters
never bated a jot of his arrogance about his own work or of his contempt
for theirs To the painters he was respectful even humble but for the
poets and prosaists of The Yellow Book and later of The Savoy he
had never a word but of scorn He wasnt resented It didnt occur to
anybody that he or his Catholic Diabolism mattered When in the autumn
of 96 he brought out at his own expense this time a third book his
last book nobody said a word for or against it I meant but forgot to
buy it I never saw it and am ashamed to say I dont even remember
what it was called But I did at the time of its publication say to
Rothenstein that I thought poor old Soames was really a rather
tragic figure and that I believed he would literally die for want of
recognition Rothenstein scoffed He said I was trying to get credit for
a kind heart which I didnt possess and perhaps this was so But at the
private view of the New English Art Club a few weeks later I beheld a
pastel portrait of Enoch Soames Esq It was very like him and very
like Rothenstein to have done it Soames was standing near it in his
soft hat and his waterproof cape all through the afternoon Anybody who
knew him would have recognised the portrait at a glance but nobody who
didnt know him would have recognised the portrait from its bystander
it existed so much more than he it was bound to Also it had not
that expression of faint happiness which on this day was discernible
yes in Soames countenance Fame had breathed on him Twice again in
the course of the month I went to the New English and on both occasions
Soames himself was on view there Looking back I regard the close of
that exhibition as having been virtually the close of his career He had
felt the breath of Fame against his cheekso late for such a little
while and at its withdrawal he gave in gave up gave out He who had
never looked strong or well looked ghastly nowa shadow of the shade
he had once been He still frequented the domino room but having lost
all wish to excite curiosity he no longer read books there You read
only at the Museum now asked I with attempted cheerfulness He said
he never went there now No absinthe there he muttered It was the
sort of thing that in the old days he would have said for effect but it
carried conviction now Absinthe erst but a point in the personality
he had striven so hard to build up was solace and necessity now He no
longer called it la sorciere glauque He had shed away all his French
phrases He had become a plain unvarnished Preston man

Failure if it be a plain unvarnished complete failure and even
though it be a squalid failure has always a certain dignity I avoided
Soames because he made me feel rather vulgar John Lane had published
by this time two little books of mine and they had had a pleasant
little success of esteem I was aslight but definitepersonality
Frank Harris had engaged me to kick up my heels in The Saturday Review
Alfred Harmsworth was letting me do likewise in The Daily Mail I was
just what Soames wasnt And he shamed my gloss Had I known that he
really and firmly believed in the greatness of what he as an artist
had achieved I might not have shunned him No man who hasnt lost his
vanity can be held to have altogether failed Soames dignity was an
illusion of mine One day in the first week of June 1897 that illusion
went But on the evening of that day Soames went too

I had been out most of the morning and as it was too late to reach
home in time for luncheon I sought the Vingtieme This little
placeRestaurant du Vingtieme Siecle to give it its full titlehad
been discovered in 96 by the poets and prosaists but had now been more
or less abandoned in favour of some later find I dont think it lived
long enough to justify its name but at that time there it still was in
Greek Street a few doors from Soho Square and almost opposite to that
house where in the first years of the century a little girl and with
her a boy named De Quincey made nightly encampment in darkness and
hunger among dust and rats and old legal parchments The Vingtieme was
but a small whitewashed room leading out into the street at one end and
into a kitchen at the other The proprietor and cook was a Frenchman
known to us as Monsieur Vingtieme the waiters were his two daughters
Rose and Berthe and the food according to faith was good The tables
were so narrow and were set so close together that there was space for
twelve of them six jutting from either wall

Only the two nearest to the door as I went in were occupied On one
side sat a tall flashy rather Mephistophelian man whom I had seen from
time to time in the domino room and elsewhere On the other side sat
Soames They made a queer contrast in that sunlit roomSoames sitting
haggard in that hat and cape which nowhere at any season had I seen him
doff and this other this keenly vital man at sight of whom I more
than ever wondered whether he were a diamond merchant a conjurer or
the head of a private detective agency I was sure Soames didnt want my
company but I asked as it would have seemed brutal not to whether
I might join him and took the chair opposite to his He was smoking
a cigarette with an untasted salmi of something on his plate and a
halfempty bottle of Sauterne before him and he was quite silent I
said that the preparations for the Jubilee made London impossible I
rather liked them really I professed a wish to go right away till
the whole thing was over In vain did I attune myself to his gloom He
seemed not to hear me nor even to see me I felt that his behaviour made
me ridiculous in the eyes of the other man The gangway between the two
rows of tables at the Vingtieme was hardly more than two feet wide Rose
and Berthe in their ministrations had always to edge past each other
quarrelling in whispers as they did so and any one at the table
abreast of yours was practically at yours I thought our neighbour was
amused at my failure to interest Soames and so as I could not explain
to him that my insistence was merely charitable I became silent
Without turning my head I had him well within my range of vision I
hoped I looked less vulgar than he in contrast with Soames I was sure
he was not an Englishman but what WAS his nationality Though his
jetblack hair was en brosse I did not think he was French To Berthe
who waited on him he spoke French fluently but with a hardly native
idiom and accent I gathered that this was his first visit to the
Vingtieme but Berthe was offhand in her manner to him he had not made
a good impression His eyes were handsome butlike the Vingtiemes
tablestoo narrow and set too close together His nose was predatory
and the points of his moustache waxed up beyond his nostrils gave
a fixity to his smile Decidedly he was sinister And my sense of
discomfort in his presence was intensified by the scarlet waistcoat
which tightly and so unseasonably in June sheathed his ample chest
This waistcoat wasnt wrong merely because of the heat either It was
somehow all wrong in itself It wouldnt have done on Christmas morning
It would have struck a jarring note at the first night of Hernani
I was trying to account for its wrongness when Soames suddenly and
strangely broke silence A hundred years hence he murmured as in a
trance

We shall not be here I briskly but fatuously added

We shall not be here No he droned but the Museum will still be
just where it is And the readingroom just where it is And people
will be able to go and read there He inhaled sharply and a spasm as
of actual pain contorted his features

I wondered what train of thought poor Soames had been following He did
not enlighten me when he said after a long pause You think I havent
minded

Minded what Soames

Neglect Failure

FAILURE I said heartily Failure I repeated vaguely
Neglectyes perhaps but thats quite another matter Of course you
havent beenappreciated But what then Any artist whowho gives
What I wanted to say was Any artist who gives truly new and great
things to the world has always to wait long for recognition but the
flattery would not out in the face of his misery a misery so genuine
and so unmasked my lips would not say the words

And thenhe said them for me I flushed Thats what you were going to
say isnt it he asked

How did you know

Its what you said to me three years ago when Fungoids was
published I flushed the more I need not have done so at all for
Its the only important thing I ever heard you say he continued
And Ive never forgotten it Its a true thing Its a horrible truth
Butdyou remember what I answered I said I dont care a sou for
recognition And you believed me Youve gone on believing Im above
that sort of thing Youre shallow What should YOU know of the feelings
of a man like me You imagine that a great artists faith in himself and
in the verdict of posterity is enough to keep him happy Youve never
guessed at the bitterness and loneliness thehis voice broke but
presently he resumed speaking with a force that I had never known in
him Posterity What use is it to ME A dead man doesnt know that
people are visiting his gravevisiting his birthplaceputting up
tablets to himunveiling statues of him A dead man cant read the
books that are written about him A hundred years hence Think of it
If I could come back to life thenjust for a few hoursand go to the
readingroom and READ Or better still if I could be projected now
at this moment into that future into that readingroom just for this
one afternoon Id sell myself body and soul to the devil for
that Think of the pages and pages in the catalogue SOAMES
ENOCH endlesslyendless editions commentaries prolegomena
biographiesbut here he was interrupted by a sudden loud creak of the
chair at the next table Our neighbour had half risen from his place He
was leaning towards us apologetically intrusive

Excusepermit me he said softly I have been unable not to hear
Might I take a liberty In this little restaurantsansfaconhe spread
wide his handsmight I as the phrase is cut in

I could but signify our acquiescence Berthe had appeared at the kitchen
door thinking the stranger wanted his bill He waved her away with his
cigar and in another moment had seated himself beside me commanding a
full view of Soames

Though not an Englishman he explained I know my London well Mr
Soames Your name and fameMr Beerbohms toovery known to me Your
point is who am _I_ He glanced quickly over his shoulder and in a
lowered voice said I am the Devil

I couldnt help it I laughed I tried not to I knew there was nothing
to laugh at my rudeness shamed me butI laughed with increasing
volume The Devils quiet dignity the surprise and disgust of his
raised eyebrows did but the more dissolve me I rocked to and fro I
lay back aching I behaved deplorably

I am a gentleman and he said with intense emphasis I thought I was
in the company of GENTLEMEN

Dont I gasped faintly Oh dont

Curious nicht wahr I heard him say to Soames There is a type of
person to whom the very mention of my name isohsoawfullyfunny In
your theatres the dullest comedian needs only to say The Devil and
right away they give him the loud laugh that speaks the vacant mind
Is it not so

I had now just breath enough to offer my apologies He accepted them
but coldly and readdressed himself to Soames

I am a man of business he said and always I would put things
through right now as they say in the States You are a poet Les
affairesyou detest them So be it But with me you will deal eh What
you have said just now gives me furiously to hope

Soames had not moved except to light a fresh cigarette He sat crouched
forward with his elbows squared on the table and his head just above
the level of his hands staring up at the Devil Go on he nodded I
had no remnant of laughter in me now

It will be the more pleasant our little deal the Devil went on
because you areI mistake nota Diabolist

A Catholic Diabolist said Soames

The Devil accepted the reservation genially You wish he resumed to
visit nowthis afternoon aseveristhe readingroom of the British
Museum yes but of a hundred years hence yes Parfaitement Timean
illusion Past and futurethey are as everpresent as the present or
at any rate only what you call justroundthecorner I switch you
on to any date I project youpouf You wish to be in the readingroom
just as it will be on the afternoon of June 3 1997 You wish to find
yourself standing in that room just past the swingdoors this very
minute yes and to stay there till closing time Am I right

Soames nodded

The Devil looked at his watch Ten past two he said Closing time in
summer same then as now seven oclock That will give you almost five
hours At seven oclockpoufyou find yourself again here sitting
at this table I am dining tonight dans le mondedans le higlif That
concludes my present visit to your great city I come and fetch you
here Mr Soames on my way home

Home I echoed

Be it never so humble said the Devil lightly

All right said Soames

Soames I entreated But my friend moved not a muscle

The Devil had made as though to stretch forth his hand across the table
and touch Soames forearm but he paused in his gesture

A hundred years hence as now he smiled no smoking allowed in the
readingroom You would better therefore

Soames removed the cigarette from his mouth and dropped it into his
glass of Sauterne

Soames again I cried Cant youbut the Devil had now stretched
forth his hand across the table He brought it slowly down onthe
tablecloth Soames chair was empty His cigarette floated sodden in his
wineglass There was no other trace of him

For a few moments the Devil let his hand rest where it lay gazing at me
out of the corners of his eyes vulgarly triumphant

A shudder shook me With an effort I controlled myself and rose from my
chair Very clever I said condescendingly ButThe Time Machine
is a delightful book dont you think So entirely original

You are pleased to sneer said the Devil who had also risen but it
is one thing to write about an impossible machine it is a quite other
thing to be a Supernatural Power All the same I had scored

Berthe had come forth at the sound of our rising I explained to her
that Mr Soames had been called away and that both he and I would be
dining here It was not until I was out in the open air that I began to
feel giddy I have but the haziest recollection of what I did where I
wandered in the glaring sunshine of that endless afternoon I remember
the sound of carpenters hammers all along Piccadilly and the bare
chaotic look of the halferected stands Was it in the Green Park or
in Kensington Gardens or WHERE was it that I sat on a chair beneath a
tree trying to read an evening paper There was a phrase in the leading
article that went on repeating itself in my fagged mindLittle is
hidden from this august Lady full of the garnered wisdom of sixty years
of Sovereignty I remember wildly conceiving a letter to reach Windsor
by express messenger told to await answer


MADAMWell knowing that your Majesty is full of the garnered wisdom
of sixty years of Sovereignty I venture to ask your advice in the
following delicate matter Mr Enoch Soames whose poems you may or may
not know


Was there NO way of helping himsaving him A bargain was a bargain
and I was the last man to aid or abet any one in wriggling out of a
reasonable obligation I wouldnt have lifted a little finger to save
Faust But poor Soamesdoomed to pay without respite an eternal price
for nothing but a fruitless search and a bitter disillusioning

Odd and uncanny it seemed to me that he Soames in the flesh in the
waterproof cape was at this moment living in the last decade of the
next century poring over books not yet written and seeing and seen by
men not yet born Uncannier and odder still that tonight and evermore
he would be in Hell Assuredly truth was stranger than fiction

Endless that afternoon was Almost I wished I had gone with Soamesnot
indeed to stay in the readingroom but to sally forth for a brisk
sightseeing walk around a new London I wandered restlessly out of the
Park I had sat in Vainly I tried to imagine myself an ardent tourist
from the eighteenth century Intolerable was the strain of the
slowpassing and empty minutes Long before seven oclock I was back at
the Vingtieme

I sat there just where I had sat for luncheon Air came in listlessly
through the open door behind me Now and again Rose or Berthe appeared
for a moment I had told them I would not order any dinner till Mr
Soames came A hurdygurdy began to play abruptly drowning the noise
of a quarrel between some Frenchmen further up the street Whenever the
tune was changed I heard the quarrel still raging I had bought another
evening paper on my way I unfolded it My eyes gazed ever away from it
to the clock over the kitchen door

Five minutes now to the hour I remembered that clocks in restaurants
are kept five minutes fast I concentrated my eyes on the paper I vowed
I would not look away from it again I held it upright at its full
width close to my face so that I had no view of anything but it
Rather a tremulous sheet Only because of the draught I told myself

My arms gradually became stiff they ached but I could not drop
themnow I had a suspicion I had a certainty Well what then
What else had I come for Yet I held tight that barrier of newspaper
Only the sound of Berthes brisk footstep from the kitchen enabled me
forced me to drop it and to utter

What shall we have to eat Soames

Il est souffrant ce pauvre Monsieur Soames asked Berthe

Hes onlytired I asked her to get some wineBurgundyand whatever
food might be ready Soames sat crouched forward against the table
exactly as when last I had seen him It was as though he had never
movedhe who had moved so unimaginably far Once or twice in the
afternoon it had for an instant occurred to me that perhaps his journey
was not to be fruitlessthat perhaps we had all been wrong in our
estimate of the works of Enoch Soames That we had been horribly right
was horribly clear from the look of him But Dont be discouraged I
falteringly said Perhaps its only that youdidnt leave enough time
Two three centuries hence perhaps

Yes his voice came Ive thought of that

And nownow for the more immediate future Where are you going to
hide How would it be if you caught the Paris express from Charing
Cross Almost an hour to spare Dont go on to Paris Stop at Calais
Live in Calais Hed never think of looking for you in Calais

Its like my luck he said to spend my last hours on earth with
an ass But I was not offended And a treacherous ass he strangely
added tossing across to me a crumpled bit of paper which he had been
holding in his hand I glanced at the writing on itsome sort of
gibberish apparently I laid it impatiently aside

Come Soames pull yourself together This isnt a mere matter of life
and death Its a question of eternal torment mind you You dont mean
to say youre going to wait limply here till the Devil comes to fetch
you

I cant do anything else Ive no choice

Come This is trusting and encouraging with a vengeance This is
Diabolism run mad I filled his glass with wine Surely now that
youve SEEN the brute

Its no good abusing him

You must admit theres nothing Miltonic about him Soames

I dont say hes not rather different from what I expected

Hes a vulgarian hes a swellmobsman hes the sort of man who hangs
about the corridors of trains going to the Riviera and steals ladies
jewelcases Imagine eternal torment presided over by HIM

You dont suppose I look forward to it do you

Then why not slip quietly out of the way

Again and again I filled his glass and always mechanically he emptied
it but the wine kindled no spark of enterprise in him He did not eat
and I myself ate hardly at all I did not in my heart believe that any
dash for freedom could save him The chase would be swift the capture
certain But better anything than this passive meek miserable waiting
I told Soames that for the honour of the human race he ought to make
some show of resistance He asked what the human race had ever done for
him Besides he said cant you understand that Im in his power
You saw him touch me didnt you Theres an end of it Ive no will
Im sealed

I made a gesture of despair He went on repeating the word sealed
I began to realise that the wine had clouded his brain No wonder
Foodless he had gone into futurity foodless he still was I urged him
to eat at any rate some bread It was maddening to think that he who
had so much to tell might tell nothing How was it all I asked
yonder Come Tell me your adventures

Theyd make firstrate copy wouldnt they

Im awfully sorry for you Soames and I make all possible allowances
but what earthly right have you to insinuate that I should make copy
as you call it out of you

The poor fellow pressed his hands to his forehead I dont know he
said I had some reason I know Ill try to remember

Thats right Try to remember everything Eat a little more bread What
did the readingroom look like

Much as usual he at length muttered

Many people there

Usual sort of number

What did they look like

Soames tried to visualise them They all he presently remembered
looked very like one another

My mind took a fearsome leap All dressed in Jaeger

Yes I think so Greyishyellowish stuff

A sort of uniform He nodded With a number on it perhapsa number
on a large disc of metal sewn on to the left sleeve DKF 78910that
sort of thing It was even so And all of themmen and women
alikelooking very wellcaredfor very Utopian and smelling rather
strongly of carbolic and all of them quite hairless I was right every
time Soames was only not sure whether the men and women were hairless
or shorn I hadnt time to look at them very closely he explained

No of course not But

They stared at ME I can tell you I attracted a great deal of
attention At last he had done that I think I rather scared them
They moved away whenever I came near They followed me about at a
distance wherever I went The men at the round desk in the middle
seemed to have a sort of panic whenever I went to make inquiries

What did you do when you arrived

Well he had gone straight to the catalogue of courseto the S
volumes and had stood long before SNSOF unable to take this volume
out of the shelf because his heart was beating so At first
he said he wasnt disappointedhe only thought there was some new
arrangement He went to the middle desk and asked where the catalogue of
TWENTIETHcentury books was kept He gathered that there was still only
one catalogue Again he looked up his name stared at the three little
pasted slips he had known so well Then he went and sat down for a long
time

And then he droned I looked up the Dictionary of National
Biography and some encyclopedias I went back to the middle desk
and asked what was the best modern book on late nineteenthcentury
literature They told me Mr T K Nuptons book was considered the
best I looked it up in the catalogue and filled in a form for it It
was brought to me My name wasnt in the index butYes he said with
a sudden change of tone Thats what Id forgotten Wheres that bit of
paper Give it me back

I too had forgotten that cryptic screed I found it fallen on the
floor and handed it to him

He smoothed it out nodding and smiling at me disagreeably I found
myself glancing through Nuptons book he resumed Not very easy
reading Some sort of phonetic spelling All the modern books I saw
were phonetic

Then I dont want to hear any more Soames please

The proper names seemed all to be spelt in the old way But for that I
mightnt have noticed my own name

Your own name Really Soames Im VERY glad

And yours

No

I thought I should find you waiting here tonight So I took the
trouble to copy out the passage Read it

I snatched the paper Soames handwriting was characteristically dim
It and the noisome spelling and my excitement made me all the slower
to grasp what T K Nupton was driving at

The document lies before me at this moment Strange that the words
I here copy out for you were copied out for me by poor Soames just
seventyeight years hence

I found that by murmuring the words aloud a device which I commend to
my reader I was able to master them little by little The clearer they
became the greater was my bewilderment my distress and horror The
whole thing was a nightmare Afar the great grisly background of what
was in store for the poor dear art of letters here at the table
fixing on me a gaze that made me hot all over the poor fellow
whomwhom evidently but no whatever downgrade my character might
take in coming years I should never be such a brute as to

Again I examined the screed Immajnaribut here Soames was no more
imaginary alas than I And labudwhat on earth was that To this
day I have never made out that word Its all verybaffling I at
length stammered

Soames said nothing but cruelly did not cease to look at me

Are you sure I temporised quite sure you copied the thing out
correctly

Quite

Well then its this wretched Nupton who must have mademust be going
to makesome idiotic mistake Look here Soames you know me better
than to suppose that I After all the name Max Beerbohm is not at
all an uncommon one and there must be several Enoch Soameses running
aroundor rather Enoch Soames is a name that might occur to any
one writing a story And I dont write stories Im an essayist an
observer a recorder I admit that its an extraordinary coincidence
But you must see

I see the whole thing said Soames quietly And he added with a touch
of his old manner but with more dignity than I had ever known in him
Parlons dautre chose

I accepted that suggestion very promptly I returned straight to the
more immediate future I spent most of the long evening in renewed
appeals to Soames to slip away and seek refuge somewhere I remember
saying at last that if indeed I was destined to write about him the
supposed stauri had better have at least a happy ending Soames
repeated those last three words in a tone of intense scorn In Life and
in Art he said all that matters is an INEVITABLE ending

But I urged more hopefully than I felt an ending that can be
avoided ISNT inevitable

You arent an artist he rasped And youre so hopelessly not an
artist that so far from being able to imagine a thing and make it seem
true youre going to make even a true thing seem as if youd made it
up Youre a miserable bungler And its like my luck

I protested that the miserable bungler was not Iwas not going to be
Ibut T K Nupton and we had a rather heated argument in the thick
of which it suddenly seemed to me that Soames saw he was in the wrong
he had quite physically cowered But I wondered whyand now I guessed
with a cold throb just whyhe stared so past me The bringer of that
inevitable ending filled the doorway

I managed to turn in my chair and to say not without a semblance of
lightness Aha come in Dread was indeed rather blunted in me by
his looking so absurdly like a villain in a melodrama The sheen of his
tilted hat and of his shirtfront the repeated twists he was giving to
his moustache and most of all the magnificence of his sneer gave token
that he was there only to be foiled

He was at our table in a stride I am sorry he sneered witheringly
to break up your pleasant party but

You dont you complete it I assured him Mr Soames and I want
to have a little talk with you Wont you sit Mr Soames got
nothingfrankly nothingby his journey this afternoon We dont wish
to say that the whole thing was a swindlea common swindle On the
contrary we believe you meant well But of course the bargain such as
it was is off

The Devil gave no verbal answer He merely looked at Soames and pointed
with rigid forefinger to the door Soames was wretchedly rising from
his chair when with a desperate quick gesture I swept together two
dinnerknives that were on the table and laid their blades across
each other The Devil stepped sharp back against the table behind him
averting his face and shuddering

You are not superstitious he hissed

Not at all I smiled

Soames he said as to an underling but without turning his face put
those knives straight

With an inhibitive gesture to my friend Mr Soames I said
emphatically to the Devil is a CATHOLIC Diabolist but my poor friend
did the Devils bidding not mine and now with his masters eyes again
fixed on him he arose he shuffled past me I tried to speak It was
he that spoke Try was the prayer he threw back at me as the Devil
pushed him roughly out through the door TRY to make them know that I
did exist

In another instant I too was through that door I stood staring all
waysup the street across it down it There was moonlight and
lamplight but there was not Soames nor that other

Dazed I stood there Dazed I turned back at length into the little
room and I suppose I paid Berthe or Rose for my dinner and luncheon
and for Soames I hope so for I never went to the Vingtieme again
Ever since that night I have avoided Greek Street altogether And for
years I did not set foot even in Soho Square because on that same night
it was there that I paced and loitered long and long with some such
dull sense of hope as a man has in not straying far from the place where
he has lost something Round and round the shutterd Squarethat
line came back to me on my lonely beat and with it the whole stanza
ringing in my brain and bearing in on me how tragically different from
the happy scene imagined by him was the poets actual experience of that
prince in whom of all princes we should put not our trust

Butstrange how the mind of an essayist be it never so stricken roves
and rangesI remember pausing before a wide doorstep and wondering if
perchance it was on this very one that the young De Quincey lay ill and
faint while poor Ann flew as fast as her feet would carry her to Oxford
Street the stonyhearted stepmother of them both and came back
bearing that glass of port wine and spices but for which he might so
he thought actually have died Was this the very doorstep that the old
De Quincey used to revisit in homage I pondered Anns fate the cause
of her sudden vanishing from the ken of her boyfriend and presently I
blamed myself for letting the past override the present Poor vanished
Soames

And for myself too I began to be troubled What had I better do Would
there be a hue and cryMysterious Disappearance of an Author and all
that He had last been seen lunching and dining in my company Hadnt I
better get a hansom and drive straight to Scotland Yard They would
think I was a lunatic After all I reassured myself London was a
very large place and one very dim figure might easily drop out of it
unobservednow especially in the blinding glare of the near Jubilee
Better say nothing at all I thought

And I was right Soames disappearance made no stir at all He was
utterly forgotten before any one so far as I am aware noticed that he
was no longer hanging around Now and again some poet or prosaist may
have said to another What has become of that man Soames but I never
heard any such question asked The solicitor through whom he was paid
his annuity may be presumed to have made inquiries but no echo of
these resounded There was something rather ghastly to me in the general
unconsciousness that Soames had existed and more than once I caught
myself wondering whether Nupton that babe unborn were going to be
right in thinking him a figment of my brain

In that extract from Nuptons repulsive book there is one point which
perhaps puzzles you How is it that the author though I have here
mentioned him by name and have quoted the exact words he is going to
write is not going to grasp the obvious corollary that I have invented
nothing The answer can be only this Nupton will not have read the
later passages of this memoir Such lack of thoroughness is a serious
fault in any one who undertakes to do scholars work And I hope these
words will meet the eye of some contemporary rival to Nupton and be the
undoing of Nupton

I like to think that some time between 1992 and 1997 somebody will have
looked up this memoir and will have forced on the world his inevitable
and startling conclusions And I have reasons for believing that this
will be so You realise that the readingroom into which Soames was
projected by the Devil was in all respects precisely as it will be on
the afternoon of June 3 1997 You realise therefore that on that
afternoon when it comes round there the selfsame crowd will be and
there Soames too will be punctually he and they doing precisely what
they did before Recall now Soames account of the sensation he made
You may say that the mere difference of his costume was enough to make
him sensational in that uniformed crowd You wouldnt say so if you had
ever seen him I assure you that in no period could Soames be anything
but dim The fact that people are going to stare at him and follow him
around and seem afraid of him can be explained only on the hypothesis
that they will somehow have been prepared for his ghostly visitation
They will have been awfully waiting to see whether he really would come
And when he does come the effect will of course beawful

An authentic guaranteed proven ghost butonly a ghost alas Only
that In his first visit Soames was a creature of flesh and blood
whereas the creatures into whose midst he was projected were but ghosts
I take itsolid palpable vocal but unconscious and automatic ghosts
in a building that was itself an illusion Next time that building and
those creatures will be real It is of Soames that there will be but
the semblance I wish I could think him destined to revisit the world
actually physically consciously I wish he had this one brief escape
this one small treat to look forward to I never forget him for long
He is where he is and forever The more rigid moralists among you may
say he has only himself to blame For my part I think he has been
very hardly used It is well that vanity should be chastened and Enoch
Soames vanity was I admit above the average and called for special
treatment But there was no need for vindictiveness You say he
contracted to pay the price he is paying yes but I maintain that he
was induced to do so by fraud Wellinformed in all things the Devil
must have known that my friend would gain nothing by his visit to
futurity The whole thing was a very shabby trick The more I think of
it the more detestable the Devil seems to me

Of him I have caught sight several times here and there since that day
at the Vingtieme Only once however have I seen him at close quarters
This was in Paris I was walking one afternoon along the Rue dAntin
when I saw him advancing from the opposite directionoverdressed as
ever and swinging an ebony cane and altogether behaving as though
the whole pavement belonged to him At thought of Enoch Soames and the
myriads of other sufferers eternally in this brutes dominion a great
cold wrath filled me and I drew myself up to my full height Butwell
one is so used to nodding and smiling in the street to anybody whom one
knows that the action becomes almost independent of oneself to prevent
it requires a very sharp effort and great presence of mind I was
miserably aware as I passed the Devil that I nodded and smiled to him
And my shame was the deeper and hotter because he if you please stared
straight at me with the utmost haughtiness

To be cutdeliberately cutby HIM I was I still am furious at
having had that happen to me





HILARY MALTBY AND STEPHEN BRAXTON


People still go on comparing Thackeray and Dickens quite cheerfully
But the fashion of comparing Maltby and Braxton went out so long ago as
1795 No I am wrong But anything that happened in the bland old days
before the war does seem to be a hundred more years ago than actually
it is The year I mean is the one in whose springtime we all went
bicycling O thrill in Battersea Park and ladies wore sleeves that
billowed enormously out from their shoulders and Lord Rosebery was
Prime Minister

In that Park in that springtime in that sea of sleeves there was
almost as much talk about the respective merits of Braxton and Maltby as
there was about those of Rudge and Humber For the benefit of my younger
readers and perhaps so feeble is human memory for the benefit of
their elders too let me state that Rudge and Humber were rival makers
of bicycles that Hilary Maltby was the author of Ariel in Mayfair
and Stephen Braxton of A Faun on the Cotswolds

Which do you think is REALLY the bestAriel or A Faun Ladies
were always asking one that question Oh well you know the two are
so different Its really very hard to compare them One was always
giving that answer One was not very brilliant perhaps

The vogue of the two novels lasted throughout the summer As both were
firstlings and Great Britain had therefore nothing else of Braxtons
or Maltbys to fall back on the horizon was much scanned for what
Maltby and what Braxton would give us next In the autumn Braxton
gave us his secondling It was an instantaneous failure No more was he
compared with Maltby In the spring of 96 came Maltbys secondling
Its failure was instantaneous Maltby might once more have been compared
with Braxton But Braxton was now forgotten So was Maltby

This was not kind This was not just Maltbys first novel and
Braxtons had brought delight into many thousands of homes People
should have paused to say of Braxton Perhaps his third novel will be
better than his second and to say as much for Maltby I blame people
for having given no sign of wanting a third from either and I blame
them with the more zest because neither A Faun on the Cotswolds nor
Ariel in Mayfair was a merely popular book each I maintain was a
good book I dont go so far as to say that the one had more of natural
magic more of British woodland glamour more of the sheer joy of life
in it than anything since As You Like It though Higsby went so far
as this in the Daily Chronicle nor can I allow the claim made for the
other by Grigsby in the Globe that for pungency of satire there has
been nothing like it since Swift laid down his pen and for sheer
sweetness and tenderness of feelingex forti dulcedonothing to be
mentioned in the same breath with it since the lute fell from the tired
hand of Theocritus These were foolish exaggerations But one must not
condemn a thing because it has been overpraised Maltbys Ariel was
a delicate brilliant work and Braxtons Faun crude though it was
in many ways had yet a genuine power and beauty This is not a mere
impression remembered from early youth It is the reasoned and seasoned
judgment of middle age Both books have been out of print for many
years but I secured a secondhand copy of each not long ago and found
them well worth reading again

From the time of Nathaniel Hawthorne to the outbreak of the war current
literature did not suffer from any lack of fauns But when Braxtons
first book appeared fauns had still an air of novelty about them We had
not yet tired of them and their hoofs and their slanting eyes and their
way of coming suddenly out of woods to wean quiet English villages from
respectability We did tire later But Braxtons faun even now seems
to me an admirable specimen of his classwild and weird earthy
goatlike almost convincing And I find myself convinced altogether by
Braxtons rustics I admit that I do not know much about rustics
except from novels But I plead that the little I do know about them by
personal observation does not confirm much of what the many novelists
have taught me I plead also that Braxton may well have been right about
the rustics of Gloucestershire because he was as so many interviewers
recorded of him in his brief heyday the son of a yeoman farmer at Far
Oakridge and his boyhood had been divided between that village and the
Grammar School at Stroud Not long ago I happened to be staying in the
neighbourhood and came across several villagers who might I assure
you have stepped straight out of Braxtons pages For that matter
Braxton himself whom I met often in the spring of 95 might have
stepped straight out of his own pages

I am guilty of having wished he would step straight back into them He
was a very surly fellow very rugged and gruff He was the antithesis of
pleasant little Maltby I used to think that perhaps he would have been
less unamiable if success had come to him earlier He was thirty years
old when his book was published and had had a very hard time since
coming to London at the age of sixteen Little Maltby was a year
older and so had waited a year longer but then he had waited under
a comfortable roof at Twickenham emerging into the metropolis for no
grimmer purpose than to sit and watch the fashionable riders and
walkers in Rotten Row and then going home to write a little or to play
lawntennis with the young ladies of Twickenham He had been the only
child of his parents neither of whom alas survived to take pleasure
in their darlings sudden fame He had now migrated from Twickenham and
taken rooms in Ryder Street Had he ever shared with Braxton the bread
of adversitybut no I think he would in any case have been pleasant
And conversely I cannot imagine that Braxton would in any case have been
so

No one seeing the two rivals together no one meeting them at Mr
Hookworths famous luncheon parties in the Authors Club or at Mrs
FosterDugdales not less famous garden parties in Greville Place
would have supposed offhand that the pair had a single point in common
Dapper little Maltbyblond bland diminutive Maltby with his monocle
and his gardenia big black Braxton with his lanky hair and his square
blue jaw and his square sallow forehead Canary and crow Maltby had a
perpetual chirrup of amusing smalltalk Braxton was usually silent but
very well worth listening to whenever he did croak He had distinction
I admit it the distinction of one who steadfastly refuses to adapt
himself to surroundings He stood out He awed Mr Hookworth Ladies
were always asking one another rather intently what they thought of
him One could imagine that Mr FosterDugdale had he come home from
the City to attend the garden parties might have regarded him as
one from whom Mrs FosterDugdale should be shielded But the casual
observer of Braxton and Maltby at Mrs FosterDugdales or elsewhere was
wrong in supposing that the two were totally unlike He overlooked one
simple and obvious point This was that he had met them both at Mrs
FosterDugdales or elsewhere Wherever they were invited there
certainly there punctually they would be They were both of them
gluttons for the fruits and signs of their success

Interviewers and photographers had as little reason as had hostesses to
complain of two men so earnestly and assiduously on the make as Maltby
and Braxton Maltby for all his sparkle was earnest Braxton for all
his arrogance assiduous

A Faun on the Cotswolds had no more eager eulogist than the author of
Ariel in Mayfair When any one praised his work Maltby would lightly
disparage it in comparison with BraxtonsAh if I could write like
THAT Maltby won golden opinions in this way Braxton on the
other hand would let slip no opportunity for sneering at Maltbys
workgimcrack as he called it This was not good for Maltby
Different men different methods

The Rape of the Lock was gimcrack if you care to call it so but it
was a delicate brilliant work and so I repeat was Maltbys Ariel
Absurd to compare Maltby with Pope I am not so sure I have read
Ariel but have never read The Rape of the Lock Braxtons
opprobrious term for Ariel may not however have been due to jealousy
alone Braxton had imagination and his rival did not soar above fancy
But the point is that Maltbys fancifulness went far and well In
telling how Ariel reembodied himself from thin air leased a small
house in Chesterfield Street was presented at a Levee played the part
of good fairy in a matter of true love not running smooth and worked
meanwhile all manner of amusing changes among the aristocracy before he
vanished again Maltby showed a very pretty range of ingenuity In one
respect his work was a more surprising achievement than Braxtons For
whereas Braxton had been born and bred among his rustics Maltby knew
his aristocrats only through Thackeray through the photographs and
paragraphs in the newspapers and through those passionate excursions
of his to Rotten Row Yet I found his aristocrats as convincing as
Braxtons rustics It is true that I may have been convinced wrongly
That is a point which I could settle only by experience I shift my
ground claiming for Maltbys aristocrats just this that they pleased
me very much

Aristocrats when they are presented solely through a novelists sense
of beauty do not satisfy us They may be as beautiful as all that
but for fear of thinking ourselves snobbish we wont believe it We do
believe it however and revel in it when the novelist saves his face
and ours by a pervading irony in the treatment of what he loves The
irony must mark you be pervading and obvious Disraelis great ladies
and lords wont do for his irony was but latent in his homage and
thus the reader feels himself called on to worship and in duty bound
to scoff Alls well though when the homage is latent in the irony
Thackeray inviting us to laugh and frown over the follies of Mayfair
enables us to reel with him in a secret orgy of veneration for those
fools

Maltby too in his measure enabled us to reel thus That is mainly
why before the end of April his publisher was in a position to state
that the Seventh Large Impression of Ariel in Mayfair is almost
exhausted Let it be put to our credit however that at the same
moment Braxtons publisher had the honour to inform the public that
an Eighth Large Impression of A Faun on the Cotswolds is in instant
preparation

Indeed it seemed impossible for either author to outvie the other in
success and glory Week in week out you saw cancelled eithers every
momentary advantage A neckandneck race As thusMaltby appears as
a Celebrity At Home in the World Tuesday Ha No Vanity
Fair Wednesday has a perfect presentment of Braxton by Spy
Neckandneck No Vanity Fair says the subject of next weeks cartoon
will be Mr Hilary Maltby Maltby wins No next week Braxtons in the
World

Throughout May I kept as it were my eyes glued to my fieldglasses
On the first Monday in June I saw that which drew from me a hoarse
ejaculation

Let me explain that always on Monday mornings at this time of year when
I opened my daily paper I looked with respectful interest to see what
bevy of the great world had been entertained since Saturday at Keeb
Hall The list was always august and inspiring Statecraft and Diplomacy
were well threaded there with mere Lineage and mere Beauty with Royalty
sometimes with mere Wealth never with privileged Genius now and then
A noble composition always It was said that the Duke of Hertfordshire
cared for nothing but his collection of birds eggs and that the
collections of guests at Keeb were formed entirely by his young
Duchess It was said that he had climbed trees in every corner of every
continent The Duchess hobby was easier She sat aloft and beckoned
desirable specimens up

The list published on that first Monday in June began ordinarily enough
began with the AustroHungarian Ambassador and the Portuguese Minister
Then came the Duke and Duchess of Mull followed by four lesser Peers
two of them Proconsuls however with their Peeresses three Peers
without their Peeresses four Peeresses without their Peers and a dozen
bearers of courtesytitles with or without their wives or husbands The
rear was brought up by Mr A J Balfour Mr Henry Chaplin and Mr
Hilary Maltby

Youth tends to look at the darker side of things I confess that my
first thought was for Braxton

I forgave and forgot his faults of manner Youth is generous It does
not criticise a strong man stricken

And anon so habituated was I to the parity of those two strivers I
conceived that there might be some mistake Daily newspapers are printed
in a hurry Might not Henry Chaplin be a typographical error for
Stephen Braxton I went out and bought another newspaper But Mr
Chaplins name was in that too

Patience I said to myself Braxton crouches only to spring He will
be at Keeb Hall on Saturday next

My mind was free now to dwell with pleasure on Maltbys great
achievement I thought of writing to congratulate him but feared this
might be in bad taste I did however write asking him to lunch with
me He did not answer my letter I was therefore all the more sorry
next Monday at not finding and Mr Stephen Braxton in Keebs weekend
catalogue

A few days later I met Mr Hookworth He mentioned that Stephen Braxton
had left town He has taken said Hookworth a delightful bungalow on
the east coast He has gone there to WORK He added that he had a great
liking for Braxtona man utterly UNSPOILT I inferred that he too
had written to Maltby and received no answer

That butterfly did not however appear to be hovering from flower
to flower in the parterres of rank and fashion In the daily lists of
guests at dinners receptions dances balls the name of Maltby figured
never Maltby had not caught on

Presently I heard that he too had left town I gathered that he had
gone quite early in Junequite soon after Keeb Nobody seemed to know
where he was My own theory was that he had taken a delightful bungalow
on the west coast to balance Braxton Anyhow the parity of the two
strivers was now somewhat reestablished

In point of fact the disparity had been less than I supposed While
Maltby was at Keeb there Braxton was alsoin a sense It was a
strange story I did not hear it at the time Nobody did I heard it
seventeen years later I heard it in Lucca


Little Lucca I found so enchanting that though I had only a day or two
to spare I stayed there a whole month I formed the habit of walking
every morning round that highpitched path which girdles Lucca that
wide and treeshaded path from which one looks down over the city wall
at the fertile plains beneath Lucca There were never many people there
but the few who did come came daily so that I grew to like seeing them
and took a mild personal interest in them

One of them was an old lady in a wheeled chair She was not less than
seventy years old and might or might not have once been beautiful
Her chair was slowly propelled by an Italian woman She herself was
obviously Italian Not so however the little gentleman who walked
assiduously beside her Him I guessed to be English He was a very stout
little gentleman with gleaming spectacles and a full blond beard and
he seemed to radiate cheerfulness I thought at first that he might be
the old ladys resident physician but no there was something subtly
unprofessional about him I became sure that his constancy was
gratuitous and his radiance real And one day I know not how there
dawned on me a suspicion that he waswhosome one I had knownsome
writerwhatshisnamesomething with an MMaltbyHilary Maltby of
the longago

At sight of him on the morrow this suspicion hardened almost to
certainty I wished I could meet him alone and ask him if I were not
right and what he had been doing all these years and why he had left
England He was always with the old lady It was only on my last day in
Lucca that my chance came

I had just lunched and was seated on a comfortable bench outside my
hotel with a cup of coffee on the table before me gazing across the
faded old sunny piazza and wondering what to do with my last afternoon
It was then that I espied yonder the back of the putative Maltby I
hastened forth to him He was buying some pink roses a great bunch of
them from a marketwoman under an umbrella He looked very blank he
flushed greatly when I ventured to accost him He admitted that his
name was Hilary Maltby I told him my own name and by degrees he
remembered me He apologised for his confusion He explained that he had
not talked English had not talked to an Englishman foroh hundreds
of years He said that he had in the course of his long residence in
Lucca seen two or three people whom he had known in England but that
none of them had recognised him He accepted but as though he were
embarking on the oddest adventure in the world my invitation that
he should come and sit down and take coffee with me He laughed with
pleasure and surprise at finding that he could still speak his native
tongue quite fluently and idiomatically I know absolutely nothing he
said about England nowadaysexcept from stray references to it in the
Corriere della Sera nor did he show the faintest desire that I should
enlighten him England he mused how it all comes back to me

But not you to it

Ah no indeed he said gravely looking at the roses which he had laid
carefully on the marble table I am the happiest of men

He sipped his coffee and stared out across the piazza out beyond it
into the past

I am the happiest of men he repeated I plied him with the spur of
silence

And I owe it all to having once yielded to a bad impulse Absurd the
threads our destinies hang on

Again I plied him with that spur As it seemed not to prick him I
repeated the words he had last spoken For instance I added

Take he said a certain evening in the spring of 95 If on that
evening the Duchess of Hertfordshire had had a bad cold or if she
had decided that it WOULDNT be rather interesting to go on to that
partythat Annual Soiree I think it wasof the Inkwomens Club or
againto go a step further backif she hadnt ever written that one
little poem and if it HADNT been printed in The Gentlewoman and if
the Inkwomens committee HADNT instantly and unanimously elected her an
Honorary VicePresident because of that one little poem or ifwell
if a millionandone utterly irrelevant things hadnt happened
dontyouknow I shouldnt be here I might be THERE he smiled
with a vague gesture indicating England

Suppose he went on I hadnt been invited to that Annual Soiree or
suppose that other fellow

Braxton I suggested I had remembered Braxton at the moment of
recognising Maltby

Suppose HE hadnt been asked But of course we both were It
happened that I was the first to be presented to the Duchess It was
a great moment I hoped I should keep my head She wore a tiara I had
often seen women in tiaras at the Opera But I had never talked to
a woman in a tiara Tiaras were symbols to me Eyes are just a human
feature I fixed mine on the Duchesss I kept my head by not looking
at hers I behaved as one human being to another She seemed very
intelligent We got on very well Presently she asked whether I should
think her VERY bold if she said how PERFECTLY divine she thought my
book I said something about doing my best and asked with animation
whether she had read A Faun on the Cotswolds She had She said it was
TOO wonderful she said it was TOO great If she hadnt been a Duchess
I might have thought her slightly hysterical Her innate goodsense
quickly reasserted itself She used her great power With a wave of her
magic wand she turned into a fact the glittering possibility that had
haunted me She asked me down to Keeb

She seemed very pleased that I would come Was I by any chance free
on Saturday week She hoped there would be some amusing people to meet
me Could I come by the 330 It was only an hourandaquarter from
Victoria On Saturday there were always compartments reserved for people
coming to Keeb by the 330 She hoped I would bring my bicycle with me
She hoped I wouldnt find it very dull She hoped I wouldnt forget to
come She said how lovely it must be to spend ones life among clever
people She supposed I knew everybody here tonight She asked me to
tell her who everybody was She asked who was the tall dark man over
there I told her it was Stephen Braxton She said they had promised to
introduce her to him She added that he looked rather wonderful Oh he
is very I assured her She turned to me with a sudden appeal DO you
think if I took my courage in both hands and asked him hed care to
come to Keeb

I hesitated It would be easy to say that Satan answered FOR me easy
but untrue it was I that babbled Wellas a matter of factsince you
ask meif I were youreally I think youd better not Hes very odd in
some ways He has an extraordinary hatred of sleeping out of London He
has the real Gloucestershire LOVE of London At the same time hes very
shy and if you asked him he wouldnt very well know how to refuse I
think it would be KINDER not to ask him

At that moment Mrs Wilphamthe Presidentloomed up to us bringing
Braxton He bore himself well Rough dignity with a touch of mellowness
I daresay you never saw him smile He smiled gravely down at the
Duchess while she talked in her pretty little quick humble way He made
a great impression

What I had done was not merely base it was very dangerous I was in
terror that she might rally him on his devotion to London I didnt dare
to move away I was immensely relieved when at length she said she must
be going

Braxton seemed loth to relax his grip on her hand at parting I feared
she wouldnt escape without uttering that invitation But all was
well In saying good night to me she added in a murmur Dont
forget KeebSaturday weekthe 330 Merely an exquisite murmur
But Braxton heard it I knew by the diabolical look he gave me that
Braxton had heard it If he hadnt I shouldnt be here

Was I a prey to remorse Well in the days between that Soiree and that
Saturday remorse often claimed me but rapture wouldnt give me up
Arcady Olympus the right people at last I hadnt realised how good
my book wasnot till it got me this guerdon not till I got it this
huge advertisement I foresaw how pleased my publisher would be In some
great houses I knew it was possible to stay without any one knowing
you had been there But the Duchess of Hertfordshire hid her light under
no bushel Exclusive she was but not of publicity Next to Windsor
Castle Keeb Hall was the most advertised house in all England

Meanwhile I had plenty to do I rather thought of engaging a valet
but decided that this wasnt necessary On the other hand I felt a need
for three new summer suits and a new evening suit and some new white
waistcoats Also a smoking suit And had any man ever stayed at Keeb
without a dressingcase Hitherto I had been content with a pair of
wooden brushes and so forth I was afraid these would appal the footman
who unpacked my things I ordered for his sake a large dressingcase
with my initials engraved throughout it It looked compromisingly new
when it came to me from the shop I had to kick it industriously and
throw it about and scratch it so as to avert possible suspicion The
tailor did not send my things home till the Friday evening I had to sit
up late wearing the new suits in rotation

Next day at Victoria I saw strolling on the platform many people
male and female who looked as if they were going to Keebtall
cool ornate people who hadnt packed their own things and had reached
Victoria in broughams I was ornate but not tall nor cool My porter
was rather offhand in his manner as he wheeled my things along to
the 330 I asked severely if there were any compartments reserved for
people going to stay with the Duke of Hertfordshire This worked an
instant change in him Having set me in one of those shrines he seemed
almost loth to accept a tip A snob I am afraid

A selection of the tall the cool the ornate the intimately
acquainted with one another soon filled the compartment There I
was and I think they felt they ought to try to bring me into the
conversation As they were all talking about a cotillion of the previous
night I shouldnt have been able to shine I gazed out of the window
with middleclass aloofness Presently the talk drifted on to the topic
of bicycles But by this time it was too late for me to come in

I gazed at the squalid outskirts of London as they flew by I doubted
as I listened to my fellowpassengers whether I should be able to shine
at Keeb I rather wished I were going to spend the weekend at one of
those little houses with backgardens beneath the railwayline I was
filled with fears

For shame thought I Was I nobody Was the author of Ariel in
Mayfair nobody

I reminded myself how glad Braxton would be if he knew of my
faintheartedness I thought of Braxton sitting at this moment in his
room in Cliffords Inn and glowering with envy of his hated rival in the
330 And after all how enviable I was My spirits rose I would acquit
myself well

I much admired the scene at the little railway station where we
alighted It was like a fete by Lancret I knew from the talk of my
fellowpassengers that some people had been going down by an earlier
train and that others were coming by a later But the 330 had brought
a full score of us Us That was the final touch of beauty

Outside there were two broughams a landau dogcarts a phaeton a
wagonette I know not what But almost everybody it seemed was going
to bicycle Lady Rodfitten said SHE was going to bicycle Year after
year I had seen that famous Countess riding or driving in the Park
I had been told at fourth hand that she had a masculine intellect and
could make and unmake Ministries She was nearly sixty now a trifle
dyed and stout and weatherbeaten but still tremendously handsome and
hard as nails One would not have said she had grown older but merely
that she belonged now to a rather later period of the Roman Empire I
had never dreamed of a time when one roof would shelter Lady Rodfitten
and me Somehow she struck my imagination more than any of these
othersmore than Count Deym more than Mr Balfour more than the
lovely Lady Thisbe Crowborough

I might have had a ducal vehicle all to myself and should have liked
that but it seemed more correct that I should use my bicycle On the
other hand I didnt want to ride with all these peoplea stranger in
their midst I lingered around the luggage till they were off and then
followed at a long distance

The sun had gone behind clouds But I rode slowly so as to be sure not
to arrive hot I passed not without a thrill through the massive
open gates into the Dukes park A massive man with a cockade saluted
mehearteninglyfrom the door of the lodge The park seemed endless
I came at length to a long straight avenue of elms that were almost
blatantly immemorial At the end of it waswell I felt like a gnat
going to stay in a public building

If there had been turnstilesIN and OUTand a shilling to pay
I should have felt easier as I passed into that hallthat
PalladioGargantuan hall Some one some butler or groomofthechamber
murmured that her Grace was in the garden I passed out through the
great opposite doorway on to a wide spectacular terrace with lawns
beyond Tea was on the nearest of these lawns In the central group of
peoplesome standing others sittingI espied the Duchess She sat
pouring out tea a deft and animated little figure I advanced firmly
down the steps from the terrace feeling that all would be well so soon
as I had reported myself to the Duchess

But I had a staggering surprise on my way to her I espied in one of
the smaller groupswhom dyou think Braxton

I had no time to wonder how he had got theretime merely to grasp the
black fact that he WAS there

The Duchess seemed really pleased to see me She said it was TOO
splendid of me to come You know Mr Maltby she asked Lady Rodfitten
who exclaimed Not Mr HILARY Maltby with a vigorous grace that
was overwhelming Lady Rodfitten declared she was the greatest of my
admirers and I could well believe that in whatever she did she excelled
all competitors On the other hand I found it hard to believe she was
afraid of me Yet I had her word for it that she was

Her womanly charm gave place now to her masculine grip She
eulogised me in the language of a seasoned reviewer on the staff of a
longestablished journalwordy perhaps but sound I revered and loved
her I wished I could give her my undivided attention But whilst I sat
there teacup in hand between her and the Duchess part of my brain
was fearfully concerned with that glimpse I had had of Braxton It
didnt so much matter that he was here to halve my triumph But suppose
he knew what I had told the Duchess And suppose he hadno surely if
he HAD shown me up in all my meanness she wouldnt have received me
so very cordially I wondered where she could have met him since that
evening of the Inkwomen I heard Lady Rodfitten concluding her review
of Ariel with two or three sentences that might have been framed
specially to give the publisher an easy quote And then I heard myself
asking mechanically whether she had read A Faun on the Cotswolds The
Duchess heard me too She turned from talking to other people and said
I did like Mr Braxton so VERY much

Yes I threw out with a sickly smile Im so glad you asked him to
come

But I didnt ask him I didnt DARE

Butbutsurely he wouldnt bebe HERE if We stared at each other
blankly Here she echoed glancing at the scattered little groups of
people on the lawn I glanced too I was much embarrassed I explained
that I had seen Braxton standing just over there when I arrived and
had supposed he was one of the people who came by the earlier train
Well she said with a slightly irritated laugh you must have
mistaken some one else for him She dropped the subject talked to
other people and presently moved away

Surely thought I she didnt suspect me of trying to make fun of her
On the other hand surely she hadnt conspired with Braxton to make a
fool of ME And yet how could Braxton be here without an invitation
and without her knowledge My brain whirled One thing only was clear
I could NOT have mistaken anybody for Braxton There Braxton had
stoodStephen Braxton in that old pepperandsalt suit of his with
his red tie all askew and without a hathis hair hanging over his
forehead All this I had seen sharp and cleancut There he had stood
just beside one of the women who travelled down in the same compartment
as I a very pretty woman in a pale blue dress a tall womanbut I had
noticed how small she looked beside Braxton This woman was now walking
to and fro yonder with M de Soveral I had seen Braxton beside her as
clearly as I now saw M de Soveral

Lady Rodfitten was talking about India to a recent Viceroy She seemed
to have as firm a grip of India as of Ariel I sat forgotten I wanted
to arise and wander offin a vague search for Braxton But I feared
this might look as if I were angry at being ignored Presently Lady
Rodfitten herself arose to have what she called her annual look
round She bade me come too and strode off between me and the
recent Viceroy noting improvements that had been made in the grounds
suggesting improvements that might be made indicating improvements that
MUST be made She was great on landscapegardening The recent Viceroy
was less great on it but great enough I dont say I walked forgotten
the eminent woman constantly asked my opinion but my opinion though of
course it always coincided with hers sounded quite worthless somehow
I longed to shine I could only bother about Braxton

Lady Rodfittens voice sounded overstrong for the stillness of
evening The shadows lengthened My spirits sank lower and lower with
the sun I was a naturally cheerful person but always towards sunset
I had a vague sense of melancholy I seemed always to have grown weaker
morbid misgivings would come to me On this particular evening there was
one such misgiving that crept in and out of me again and again a very
horrible misgiving as to the NATURE of what I had seen

Well dressing for dinner is a great tonic Especially if one shaves
My spirits rose as I lathered my face I smiled to my reflection in
the mirror The afterglow of the sun came through the window behind
the dressingtable but I had switched on all the lights My new
silvertopped bottles and things made a fine array Tonight _I_ was
going to shine too I felt I might yet be the life and soul of the
party Anyway my new evening suit was without a fault And meanwhile
this new razor was perfect Having shaved down I lathered myself
again and proceeded to shave up It was then that I uttered a sharp
sound and swung round on my heel

No one was there Yet this I knew Stephen Braxton had just looked over
my shoulder I had seen the reflection of his face beside minecraned
forward to the mirror I had met his eyes

He had been with me This I knew

I turned to look again at that mirror One of my cheeks was all covered
with blood I stanched it with a towel Three long cuts where the razor
had slipped and skipped I plunged the towel into cold water and held it
to my cheek The bleeding went onalarmingly I rang the bell No one
came I vowed I wouldnt bleed to death for Braxton I rang again At
last a very tall powdered footman appearedmore reproachfullooking
than sympathetic as though I hadnt ordered that dressingcase
specially on his behalf He said he thought one of the housemaids would
have some stickingplaster He was very sorry he was needed downstairs
but he would tell one of the housemaids I continued to dab and to
curse The blood flowed less I showed great spirit I vowed Braxton
should not prevent me from going down to dinner

Buta pretty sight I was when I did go down Pale but determined with
three long strips of black stickingplaster forming a sort of Z on my
left cheek Mr Hilary Maltby at Keeb Literatures Ambassador

I dont know how late I was Dinner was in full swing Some servant
piloted me to my place I sat down unobserved The woman on either side
of me was talking to her other neighbour I was near the Duchess end of
the table Soup was served to methat darkred soup that you pour cream
intoBortsch I felt it would steady me I raised the first spoonful to
my lips andmy hand gave a sudden jerk

I was aware of two separate horrorsa horror that had been a horror
that was Braxton had vanished Not for more than an instant had he
stood scowling at me from behind the opposite diners Not for more than
the fraction of an instant But he had left his mark on me I gazed down
with a frozen stare at my shirtfront at my white waistcoat both dark
with Bortsch I rubbed them with a napkin I made them worse

I looked at my glass of champagne I raised it carefully and drained
it at one draught It nerved me But behind that shirtfront was a broken
heart

The woman on my left was Lady Thisbe Crowborough I dont know who was
the woman on my right She was the first to turn and see me I thought
it best to say something about my shirtfront at once I said it to her
sideways without showing my left cheek Her handsome eyes rested on the
splashes She said after a moments thought that they looked rather
gay She said she thought the eternal black and white of mens
evening clothes was so very dreary She did her best Lady Thisbe
Crowborough did her best too I suppose but breeding isnt proof
against all possible shocks she visibly started at sight of me and my
Z I explained that I had cut myself shaving I said with an attempt at
lightness that shy men ought always to cut themselves shaving it
made such a good conversational opening But surely she said after a
pause you dont cut yourself on purpose She was an abysmal fool I
didnt think so at the time She was Lady Thisbe Crowborough This fact
hallowed her That we didnt get on at all well was a misfortune
for which I blamed only myself and my repulsive appearance andthe
unforgettable horror that distracted me Nor did I blame Lady Thisbe for
turning rather soon to the man on her other side

The woman on my right was talking to the man on HER other side so that
I was left a prey to secret memory and dread I wasnt wondering wasnt
attempting to explain I was merely rememberingand dreading Andhow
odd one ison the toplayer of my consciousness I hated to be seen
talking to no one Mr Maltby at Keeb I caught the Duchess eye once
or twice and she nodded encouragingly as who should say You do look
rather awful and you do seem rather out of it but I dont for a moment
regret having asked you to come Presently I had another chance of
talking I heard myself talk My feverish anxiety to please rather
touched ME But I noticed that the eyes of my listener wandered And
yet I was sorry when the ladies went away I had a sense of greater
exposure Men who hadnt seen me saw me now The Duke as he came round
to the Duchess end of the table must have wondered who I was But he
shyly offered me his hand as he passed and said it was so good of me
to come I had thought of slipping away to put on another shirt and
waistcoat but had decided that this would make me the more ridiculous
I sat drinking portpoison to me after champagne but a lulling
poisonand listened to noblemen with unstained shirtfronts talking
about the Australian cricket match

Is Rubicon Bezique still played in England There was a mania for it at
that time The floor of Keebs PalladioGargantuan hall was dotted with
innumerable little tables I didnt know how to play My hostess told me
I must come and amuse the dear old Duke and Duchess of Mull and led
me to a remote sofa on which an old gentleman had just sat down beside
an old lady They looked at me with a dim kind interest My hostess had
set me and left me on a small gilt chair in front of them Before going
she had conveyed to them loudlyone of them was very deafthat I was
the famous writer It was a long time before they understood that I
was not a political writer The Duke asked me after a troubled pause
whether I had known old Mr Abraham Hayward The Duchess said I was
too young to have known Mr Hayward and asked if I knew her clever
friend Mr Mallock I said I had just been reading Mr Mallocks new
novel I heard myself shouting a confused precis of the plot The place
where we were sitting was near the foot of the great marble staircase
I said how beautiful the staircase was The Duchess of Mull said she had
never cared very much for that staircase The Duke after a pause said
he had often heard old Mr Abraham Hayward hold a whole dinner table
There were long and frequent pausesbetween which I heard myself
talking loudly frantically sinking lower and lower in the esteem of my
small audience I felt like a man drowning under the eyes of an elderly
couple who sit on the bank regretting that they can offer NO assistance
Presently the Duke looked at his watch and said to the Duchess that it
was time to be thinking of bed

They rose as it were from the bank and left me so to speak under
water I watched them as they passed slowly out of sight up the marble
staircase which I had mispraised I turned and surveyed the brilliant
silent scene presented by the cardplayers

I wondered what old Mr Abraham Hayward would have done in my place
Would he have just darted in among those tables and held them I
presumed that he would not have stolen silently away quickly and
cravenly away up the marble staircaseas _I_ did

I dont know which was the greater the relief or the humiliation of
finding myself in my bedroom Perhaps the humiliation was the greater
There on a chair was my grand new smokingsuit laid out for mewhat
a mockery Once I had foreseen myself wearing it in the smokingroom
at a late hourthe centre of a group of eminent men entranced by the
brilliancy of my conversation And now I was nothing but a small
dull soupstained stickingplastered nerveracked recluse Nerves
yes I assured myself that I had not seenwhat I had seemed to see All
very odd of course and very unpleasant but easily explained Nerves
Excitement of coming to Keeb too much for me A good nights rest that
was all I needed Tomorrow I should laugh at myself

I wondered that I wasnt tired physically There my grand new silk
pyjamas were yet I felt no desire to go to bed none while it was
still possible for me to go The little writingtable at the foot of my
bed seemed to invite me I had brought with me in my portmanteau a sheaf
of letters letters that I had purposely left unanswered in order that I
might answer them on KEEB HALL notepaper These the footman had neatly
laid beside the blottingpad on that little writingtable at the foot
of the bed I regretted that the notepaper stacked there had no ducal
coronet on it What matter The address sufficed If I hadnt yet made a
good impression on the people who were staying here I could at any rate
make one on the people who werent I sat down I set to work I wrote a
prodigious number of fluent and graceful notes

Some of these were to strangers who wanted my autograph I was always
delighted to send my autograph and never perfunctory in the manner of
sending it Dear Madam I remember writing to somebody that night
were it not that you make your request for it so charmingly I should
hesitate to send you that which rarity alone can render valuableYours
truly Hilary Maltby I remember reading this over and wondering
whether the word render looked rather commercial It was in the act
of wondering thus that I raised my eyes from the notepaper and saw
through the bars of the brass bedstead the naked sole of a large human
footsaw beyond it the calf of a great leg a nightshirt and the face
of Stephen Braxton I did not move


I thought of making a dash for the door dashing out into the corridor
shouting at the top of my voice for help I sat quite still

What kept me to my chair was the fear that if I tried to reach the door
Braxton would spring off the bed to intercept me If I sat quite still
perhaps he wouldnt move I felt that if he moved I should collapse
utterly

I watched him and he watched me He lay there with his body
halfraised one elbow propped on the pillow his jaw sunk on his
breast and from under his black brows he watched me steadily

No question of mere nerves now That hope was gone No mere optical
delusion this abiding presence Here Braxton was He and I were
together in the bright silent room How long would he be content to
watch me

Eleven nights ago he had given me one horrible look It was this look
that I had to meet in infinite prolongation now not daring to shift
my eyes He lay as motionless as I sat I did not hear him breathing
but I knew by the rise and fall of his chest under his nightshirt
that he was breathing heavily Suddenly I started to my feet For he had
moved He had raised one hand slowly He was stroking his chin And
as he did so and as he watched me his mouth gradually slackened to a
grin It was worse it was more malign this grin than the scowl that
remained with it and its immediate effect on me was an impulse that was
as hard to resist as it was hateful The window was open It was nearer
to me than the door I could have reached it in time

Well I live to tell the tale I stood my ground And there dawned on
me now a new fact in regard to my companion I had all the while been
conscious of something abnormal in his attitudea lack of ease in his
gross possessiveness I saw now the reason for this effect The pillow
on which his elbow rested was still uniformly puffed and convex like
a pillow untouched His elbow rested but on the very surface of it
not changing the shape of it at all His body made not the least furrow
along the bed He had no weight

I knew that if I leaned forward and thrust my hand between those brass
rails to clutch his foot I should clutchnothing He wasnt tangible
He was realistic He wasnt real He was opaque He wasnt solid

Odd as it may seem to you these certainties took the edge off my
horror During that walk with Lady Rodfitten I had been appalled by the
doubt that haunted me But now the very confirmation of that doubt gave
me a sort of courage I could cope better with anything tonight than
with actual Braxton And the measure of the relief I felt is that I sat
down again on my chair

More than once there came to me a wild hope that the thing might be an
optical delusion after all Then would I shut my eyes tightly shaking
my head sharply but when I looked again there the presence was of
course Ithenot actual Braxton but roughly speaking Braxtonhad
come to stay I was conscious of intense fatigue taut and alert though
every particle of me was so that I became in the course of that
ghastly night conscious of a great envy also For some time before the
dawn came in through the window Braxtons eyes had been closed little
by little now his head drooped sideways then fell on his forearm and
rested there He was asleep

Cut off from sleep I had a great longing for smoke I had cigarettes
on me I had matches on me But I didnt dare to strike a match The
sound might have waked Braxton up In slumber he was less terrible
though perhaps more odious I wasnt so much afraid now as indignant
Its intolerable I sat saying to myself utterly intolerable

I had to bear it nevertheless I was aware that I had in some degree
brought it on myself If I hadnt interfered and lied actual Braxton
would have been here at Keeb and I at this moment sleeping soundly But
this was no excuse for Braxton Braxton didnt know what I had done He
was merely envious of me Andwanly I puzzled it out in the dawnby
very force of the envy hatred and malice in him he had projected
hither into my presence this simulacrum of himself I had known that he
would be thinking of me I had known that the thought of me at Keeb Hall
would be of the last bitterness to his most sacred feelings ButI had
reckoned without the passionate force and intensity of the mans nature

If by this same strength and intensity he had merely projected himself
as an invisible guest under the Duchess roofif his feat had been
wholly as perhaps it was in part a feat of mere wistfulness and
longingthen I should have felt really sorry for him and my conscience
would have soundly rated me in his behalf But no if the wretched
creature HAD been invisible to me I shouldnt have thought of Braxton
at allexcept with gladness that he wasnt here That he was visible to
me and to me alone wasnt any sign of proper remorse within me It was
but the gauge of his incredible illwill

Well it seemed to me that he was avengedwith a vengeance There I
sat hotbrowed from sleeplessness cold in the feet stiff in the legs
cowed and indignant all throughsat there in the broadening daylight
and in that new evening suit of mine with the Braxtonised shirtfront
and waistcoat that by day were more than ever loathsome Literatures
Ambassador at Keeb I rose gingerly from my chair and caught
sight of my face of my Braxtonised cheek in the mirror I heard
the twittering of birds in distant trees I saw through my window the
elaborate landscape of the Dukes grounds all soft in the grey bloom of
early morning I think I was nearer to tears than I had ever been since
I was a child But the weakness passed I turned towards the personage
on my bed and summoning all such power as was in me WILLED him to be
gone My effort was not without resultan inadequate result Braxton
turned in his sleep

I resumed my seat and and sat up staring and blinking at a tall
man with red hair I must have fallen asleep I said Yessir he
replied and his toneless voice touched in me one or two springs
of memory I was at Keeb this was the footman who looked after me
Butwhy wasnt I in bed Had Ino surely it had been no nightmare
Surely I had SEEN Braxton on that white bed

The footman was impassively putting away my smokingsuit I was too
dazed to wonder what he thought of me Nor did I attempt to stifle a
cry when a moment later turning in my chair I beheld Braxton leaning
moodily against the mantelpiece Are you unwell sir asked the footman
No I said faintly Im quite wellYessir Will you wear the blue
suit or the greyThe greyYessirIt seemed almost incredible
that HE didnt see Braxton HE didnt appear to me one whit more solid
than the nightshirted brute who stood against the mantelpiece and
watched him lay out my thingsShall I let your bathwater run
now sirPlease yesYour bathrooms the second door to the left
sirHe went out with my bathtowel and sponge leaving me alone with
Braxton

I rose to my feet mustering once more all the strength that was in
me Hoping against hope with set teeth and clenched hands I faced him
thrust forth my will at him with everything but words commanded him to
vanishto cease to be

Suddenly utterly he vanished And you can imagine the truly exquisite
sense of triumph that thrilled me and continued to thrill me till I went
into the bathroom and found him in my bath

Quivering with rage I returned to my bedroom Intolerable I heard
myself repeating like a parrot that knew no other word A bath was just
what I had needed Could I have lain for a long time basking in very
hot water and then have sponged myself with cold water I should have
emerged calm and brave comparatively so at any rate I should have
looked less ghastly and have had less of a headache and something of
an appetite when I went down to breakfast Also I shouldnt have been
the very first guest to appear on the scene There were five or six
round tables instead of last nights long table At the further end
of the room the butler and two other servants were lighting the little
lamps under the hot dishes I didnt like to make myself ridiculous by
running away On the other hand was it right for me to begin breakfast
all by myself at one of these round tables I supposed it was But
I dreaded to be found eating alone in that vast room by the first
downcomer I sat dallying with dry toast and watching the door It
occurred to me that Braxton might occur at any moment Should I be able
to ignore him

Some man and wifea very handsome couplewere the first to appear
They nodded and said good morning when they noticed me on their way to
the hot dishes I roseuncomfortably guiltilyand sat down again I
rose again when the wife drifted to my table followed by the husband
with two steaming plates She asked me if it wasnt a heavenly morning
and I replied with nervous enthusiasm that it was She then ate kedgeree
in silence You just finishing what the husband asked looking at
my plate Oh nonoonly just beginning I assured him and helped
myself to butter He then ate kedgeree in silence He looked like some
splendid bull and she like some splendid cow grazing I envied them
their eupeptic calm I surmised that ten thousand Braxtons would not
have prevented THEM from sleeping soundly by night and grazing steadily
by day Perhaps their stolidity infected me a little Or perhaps what
braced me was the great quantity of strong tea that I consumed Anyhow
I had begun to feel that if Braxton came in now I shouldnt blench nor
falter

Well I wasnt put to the test Plenty of people drifted in but
Braxton wasnt one of them Lady Rodfittenno she didnt drift she
marched in and presently at an adjacent table she was drawing a
comparison in clarion tones between Jean and Edouard de Reszke It
seemed to me that her own voice had much in common with Edouards Even
more was it akin to a military band I found myself beating time to it
with my foot Decidedly my spirits had risen I was in a mood to face
and outface anything When I rose from the table and made my way to the
door I walked with something of a swingto the tune of Lady Rodfitten

My buoyancy didnt last long though There was no swing in my walk
when a little later I passed out on to the spectacular terrace I had
seen my enemy again and had beaten a furious retreat No doubt I should
see him yet again soonhere perhaps on this terrace Two of the
guests were bicycling slowly up and down the long paven expanse both of
them smiling with pride in the new delicious form of locomotion There
was a great array of bicycles propped neatly along the balustrade I
recognised my own among them I wondered whether Braxton had projected
from Cliffords Inn an image of his own bicycle He may have done so
but Ive no evidence that he did I myself was bicycling when next I saw
him but he I remember was on foot

This was a few minutes later I was bicycling with dear Lady Rodfitten
She seemed really to like me She had come out and accosted me heartily
on the terrace asking me because of my stickingplaster with whom I
had fought a duel since yesterday I did not tell her with whom and
she had already branched off on the subject of duelling in general She
regretted the extinction of duelling in England and gave cogent
reasons for her regret Then she asked me what my next book was to be
I confided that I was writing a sort of sequelAriel Returns to
Mayfair She shook her head said with her usual soundness that sequels
were very dangerous things and asked me to tell her briefly the lines
along which I was working I did so She pointed out two or three weak
points in my scheme She said she could judge better if I would let
her see my manuscript She asked me to come and lunch with her next
Fridayjust our two selvesat Rodfitten House and to bring my
manuscript with me Need I say that I walked on air

And now she said strenuously let us take a turn on our bicycles
By this time there were a dozen riders on the terrace all of them
smiling with pride and rapture We mounted and rode along together The
terrace ran round two sides of the house and before we came to the end
of it these words had provisionally marshalled themselves in my mind


 TO
 ELEANOR
 COUNTESS OF RODFITTEN
 THIS BOOK WHICH OWES ALL
 TO HER WISE COUNSEL
 AND UNWEARYING SUPERVISION
 IS GRATEFULLY DEDICATED
 BY HER FRIEND
 THE AUTHOR


Smiled to masonically by the passing bicyclists and smiling
masonically to them in return I began to feel that the rest of my visit
would run smooth if only

Lets go a little faster Lets race said Lady Rodfitten and we did
sojust our two selves I was on the side nearer to the balustrade
and it was on that side that Braxton suddenly appeared from nowhere
solidlooking as a rock his arms akimbo less than three yards ahead
of me so that I swerved involuntarily sharply striking broadside the
front wheel of Lady Rodfitten and collapsing with her and with a crash
of machinery to the ground

I wasnt hurt She had broken my fall I wished I was dead She
was furious She sat speechless with fury A crowd had quickly
collectedjust as in the case of a street accident She accused me now
to the crowd She said I had done it on purpose She said such terrible
things of me that I think the crowds sympathy must have veered towards
me She was assisted to her feet I tried to be one of the assistants
Dont let him come near me she thundered I caught sight of Braxton
on the fringe of the crowd grinning at me It was all HIS fault
I madly cried pointing at him Everybody looked at Mr Balfour
just behind whom Braxton was standing There was a general murmur
of surprise in which I have no doubt Mr Balfour joined He gave a
charming blank deprecating smile I meanI cant explain what I
mean I groaned Lady Rodfitten moved away refusing support limping
terribly towards the house The crowd followed her solicitous I stood
helplessly desperately where I was

I stood an outlaw a speck on the now empty terrace Mechanically
I picked up my straw hat and wheeled the two bent bicycles to the
balustrade I suppose Mr Balfour has a charming nature For he
presently came out againon purpose I am sure to alleviate my misery
He told me that Lady Rodfitten had suffered no harm He took me for a
stroll up and down the terrace talking thoughtfully and enchantingly
about things in general Then having done his deed of mercy this Good
Samaritan went back into the house My eyes followed him with gratitude
but I was still bleeding from wounds beyond his skill I escaped down
into the gardens I wanted to see no one Still more did I want to be
seen by no one I dreaded in every nerve of me my reappearance among
those people I walked ever faster and faster to stifle thought but in
vain Why hadnt I simply ridden THROUGH Braxton I was aware of being
now in the park among great trees and undulations of wild green ground
But Nature did not achieve the task that Mr Balfour had attempted and
my anguish was unassuaged

I paused to lean against a tree in the huge avenue that led to the huge
hateful house I leaned wondering whether the thought of reentering
that house were the more hateful because I should have to face my
fellowguests or because I should probably have to face Braxton A
church bell began ringing somewhere And anon I was aware of another
sounda twitter of voices A consignment of hatted and parasoled ladies
was coming fast adown the avenue My first impulse was to dodge behind
my tree But I feared that I had been observed so that what was left to
me of selfrespect compelled me to meet these ladies

The Duchess was among them I had seen her from afar at breakfast
but not since She carried a prayerbook which she waved to me as I
approached I was a disastrous guest but still a guest and nothing
could have been prettier than her smile Most of my men this week
she said are Pagans and all the others have dispatchboxes to go
throughexcept the dear old Duke of Mull whos a member of the Free
Kirk Youre Pagan of course

I saidand indeed it was a heartcrythat I should like very much to
come to church If I shant be in the way I rather abjectly added
It didnt strike me that Braxton would try to intercept me I dont know
why but it never occurred to me as I walked briskly along beside the
Duchess that I should meet him so far from the house The church was in
a corner of the park and the way to it was by a side path that branched
off from the end of the avenue A little way along casting its shadow
across the path was a large oak It was from behind this tree when we
came to it that Braxton sprang suddenly forth and tripped me up with
his foot

Absurd to be tripped up by the mere semblance of a foot But remember
I was walking quickly and the whole thing happened in a flash of
time It was inevitable that I should throw out my hands and come down
headlongjust as though the obstacle had been as real as it looked
Down I came on palms and kneecaps and up I scrambled very much hurt
and shaken and apologetic POOR Mr Maltby REALLY the Duchess
wailed for me in this latest of my mishaps Some other lady chased my
straw hat which had bowled far ahead Two others helped to brush me
They were all very kind with a quaver of mirth in their concern for me
I looked furtively around for Braxton but he was gone The palms of my
hands were abraded with gravel The Duchess said I must on no account
come to church NOW I was utterly determined to reach that sanctuary I
marched firmly on with the Duchess Come what might on the way I wasnt
going to be left out here I was utterly bent on winning at least one
respite

Well I reached the little church without further molestation To be
there seemed almost too good to be true The organ just as we entered
sounded its first notes The ladies rustled into the front pew I
being the one male of the party sat at the end of the pew beside the
Duchess I couldnt help feeling that my position was a proud one But I
had gone through too much to take instant pleasure in it and was beset
by thoughts of what new horror might await me on the way back to
the house I hoped the Service would not be brief The swelling and
dwindling strains of the voluntary on the small organ were strangely
soothing I turned to give an almost feudal glance to the simple
villagers in the pews behind and saw a sight that cowed my soul

Braxton was coming up the aisle He came slowly casting a tourists
eye at the stainedglass windows on either side Walking heavily yet
with no sound of boots on the pavement he reached our pew There
towering and glowering he halted as though demanding that we should
make room for him A moment later he edged sullenly into the pew
Instinctively I had sat tight back drawing my knees aside in a shudder
of revulsion against contact But Braxton did not push past me What he
did was to sit slowly and fully down on me

No not down ON me Down THROUGH meand around me What befell me
was not mere ghastly contact with the intangible It was inclusion
envelopment eclipse What Braxton sat down on was not I but the seat
of the pew and what he sat back against was not my face and chest but
the back of the pew I didnt realise this at the moment All I knew was
a sudden black blottingout of all things an infinite and impenetrable
darkness I dimly conjectured that I was dead What was wrong with me
in point of fact was that my eyes with the rest of me were inside
Braxton You remember what a great hulking fellow Braxton was I
calculate that as we sat there my eyes were just beneath the roof of his
mouth Horrible

Out of the unfathomable depths of that pitch darkness I could yet hear
the voluntary swelling and dwindling just as before It was by this
I knew now that I wasnt dead And I suppose I must have craned my head
forward for I had a sudden glimpse of thingsa close quick downward
glimpse of a pepperandsalt waistcoat and of two great hairy hands
clasped across it Then darkness again Either I had drawn back my head
or Braxton had thrust his forward I dont know which Are you all
right the Duchess voice whispered and no doubt my face was ashen
Quite whispered my voice But this pathetic monosyllable was the last
gasp of the social instinct in me Suddenly as the voluntary swelled
to its close there was a great sharp shuffling noise The congregation
had risen to its feet at the entry of choir and vicar Braxton had
risen leaving me in daylight I beheld his towering back The Duchess
beside him glanced round at me But I could not dared not stand up
into that presented back into that great waiting darkness I did but
clutch my hat from beneath the seat and hurry distraught down the aisle
out through the porch into the open air

Whither To what goal I didnt reason I merely fledlike Orestes
fled like an automaton along the path we had come by And was followed
Yes yes Glancing back across my shoulder I saw that brute some
twenty yards behind me gaining on me I broke into a sharper run A few
sickening moments later he was beside me scowling down into my face

I swerved dodged doubled on my tracks but he was always at me Now
and again for lack of breath I halted and he halted with me And
then when I had got my wind I would start running again in the insane
hope of escaping him We came by what twisting and turning course
I know not to the great avenue and as I stood there in an agony of
panting I had a dazed vision of the distant Hall Really I had quite
forgotten I was staying at the Duke of Hertfordshires But Braxton
hadnt forgotten He planted himself in front of me He stood between me
and the house

Faint though I was I could almost have laughed Good heavens was THAT
all he wanted that I shouldnt go back there Did he suppose I wanted
to go back therewith HIM Was I the Dukes prisoner on parole What
was there to prevent me from just walking off to the railway station I
turned to do so

He accompanied me on my way I thought that when once I had passed
through the lodge gates he might vanish satisfied But no he didnt
vanish It was as though he suspected that if he let me out of his
sight I should sneak back to the house He arrived with me this quiet
companion of mine at the little railway station Evidently he meant to
see me off I learned from an elderly and solitary porter that the next
train to London was the 43

Well Braxton saw me off by the 43 I reflected as I stepped up into
an empty compartment that it wasnt yet twentyfour hours ago since I
or some one like me had alighted at that station

The guard blew his whistle the engine shrieked and the train jolted
forward and away but I did not lean out of the window to see the last
of my attentive friend

Really not twentyfour hours ago Not twentyfour years


Maltby paused in his narrative Well well he said I dont want you
to think I overrate the ordeal of my visit to Keeb A man of stronger
nerve than mine and of greater resourcefulness might have coped
successfully with Braxton from first to lastmight have stayed on till
Monday making a very favourable impression on every one all the while
Even as it was even after my manifold failures and sudden flight I
dont say my position was impossible I only say it seemed so to me A
man less sensitive than I and less vain might have cheered up after
writing a letter of apology to his hostess and have resumed his normal
existence as though nothing very terrible had happened after all I
wrote a few lines to the Duchess that night but I wrote amidst the
preparations for my departure from England I crossed the Channel next
morning Throughout that Sunday afternoon with Braxton at the Keeb
railway station pacing the desolate platform with him waiting in
the desolating waitingroom with him I was numb to regrets and was
thinking of nothing but the 43 On the way to Victoria my brain worked
and my soul wilted Every incident in my stay at Keeb stood out clear
to me a dreadful a hideous pattern I had done for myself so far as
THOSE people were concerned And now that I had sampled THEM what cared
I for others Too low for a hawk too high for a buzzard That homely
old saying seemed to sum me up And suppose I COULD still take pleasure
in the company of my own old uppermiddle class how would that class
regard me now Gossip percolates Little by little I was sure the
story of my Keeb fiasco would leak down into the drawingroom of Mrs
FosterDugdale I felt I could never hold up my head in any company
where anything of that story was known Are you quite sure you never
heard anything

I assured Maltby that all I had known was the great bare fact of his
having stayed at Keeb Hall

Its curious he reflected Its a fine illustration of the loyalty
of those people to one another I suppose there was a general agreement
for the Duchess sake that nothing should be said about her queer guest
But even if I had dared hope to be so efficiently hushed up I couldnt
have not fled I wanted to forget I wanted to leap into some void
far away from all reminders I leapt straight from Ryder Street into
VaulelaRochette a place of which I had once heard that it was
the least frequented seasideresort in Europe I leapt leaving no
addressleapt telling my landlord that if a suitcase and a portmanteau
arrived for me he could regard them them and their contents as his own
for ever I daresay the Duchess wrote me a kind little letter forcing
herself to express a vague hope that I would come again some other
time I daresay Lady Rodfitten did NOT write reminding me of my promise
to lunch on Friday and bring Ariel Returns to Mayfair with me I
left that manuscript at Ryder Street in my bedroom grate a shuffle of
ashes Not that Id yet given up all thought of writing But I certainly
wasnt going to write now about the two things I most needed to forget
I wasnt going to write about the British aristocracy nor about any
kind of supernatural presence I did write a novelmy lastwhile I
was at Vaule Mr and Mrs Robinson Did you ever come across a copy
of it

I nodded gravely

Ah I wasnt sure said Maltby whether it was ever published A
dreary affair wasnt it I knew a great deal about suburban life
Butwell I suppose one cant really understand what one doesnt love
and one cant make good fun without real understanding Besides what
chance of virtue is there for a book written merely to distract
the authors mind I had hoped to be healed by sea and sunshine and
solitude These things were useless The labour of Mr and Mrs
Robinson did help a little When I had finished it I thought I might
as well send it off to my publisher He had given me a large sum of
money down after Ariel for my next bookso large that I was rather
loth to disgorge In the note I sent with the manuscript I gave no
address and asked that the proofs should be read in the office I
didnt care whether the thing were published or not I knew it would be
a dead failure if it were What mattered one more drop in the foaming
cup of my humiliation I knew Braxton would grin and gloat I didnt
mind even that

Oh well I said Braxton was in no mood for grinning and gloating
The Drones had already appeared

Maltby had never heard of The Droneswhich I myself had remembered
only in the course of his disclosures I explained to him that it was
Braxtons second novel and was by way of being a savage indictment
of the British aristocracy that it was written in the worst possible
taste but was so very dull that it fell utterly flat that Braxton
had forthwith taken with all of what Maltby had called the passionate
force and intensity of his nature to drink and had presently gone
under and not reemerged

Maltby gave signs of genuine though not deep emotion and cited two
or three of the finest passages from A Faun on the Cotswolds He even
expressed a conviction that The Drones must have been misjudged He
said he blamed himself more than ever for yielding to that bad impulse
at that Soiree

And yet he mused and yet honestly I cant find it in my heart
to regret that I did yield I can only wish that all had turned out as
well in the end for Braxton as for me I wish he could have won out
as I did into a great and lasting felicity For about a year after I
had finished Mr and Mrs Robinson I wandered from place to place
trying to kill memory shunning all places frequented by the English
At last I found myself in Lucca Here if anywhere I thought might a
bruised and tormented spirit find gradual peace I determined to move
out of my hotel into some permanent lodging Not for felicity not for
any complete restoration of selfrespect was I hoping only for peace
A mezzano conducted me to a noble and ancient house of which he
told me the owner was anxious to let the first floor It was in much
disrepair but even so seemed to me very cheap According to the simple
Luccan standard I am rich I took that first floor for a year had it
repaired and engaged two servants My padrona inhabited the ground
floor From time to time she allowed me to visit her there She was
the Contessa AdrianoRizzoli the last of her line She is the Contessa
AdrianoRizzoliMaltby We have been married fifteen years

Maltby looked at his watch He rose and took tenderly from the table
his great bunch of roses She is a lineal descendant he said of the
Emperor Hadrian





SAVONAROLA BROWN


I like to remember that I was the first to call him so for though he
always deprecated the nickname in his heart he was pleased by it I
know and encouraged to go on

Quite apart from its significance he had reason to welcome it He had
been unfortunate at the font His parents at the time of his birth
lived in Ladbroke Crescent XV They must have been an extraordinarily
unimaginative couple for they could think of no better name for their
child than Ladbroke This was all very well for him till he went to
school But you can fancy the indignation and delight of us boys at
finding among us a newcomer who on his own confession had been named
after a Crescent I dont know how it is nowadays but thirtyfive years
ago certainly schoolboys regarded the possession of ANY Christian name
as rather unmanly As we all had these encumbrances we had to wreak our
scorn on any one who was cumbered in a queer fashion I myself bearer
of a Christian name adjudged eccentric though brief had had much to put
up with in my first term Browns arrival therefore at the beginning
of my second term was a good thing for me and I am afraid I was very
prominent among his persecutors Trafalgar Brown Tottenham Court Brown
Bond Brownwhat names did we little brutes NOT cull for him from
the London Directory Except how miserable we made his life I do not
remember much about him as he was at that time and the only important
part of the little else that I do recall is that already he showed
a strong sense for literature For the majority of us Carthusians
literature was bounded on the north by Whyte Melville on the south by
Hawley Smart on the east by the former and on the west by the latter
Little Brown used to read Harrison Ainsworth Wilkie Collins and other
writers whom we had we assayed them would have dismissed as deep It
has been said by Mr Arthur Symons that all art is a mode of escape
The art of letters did not however enable Brown to escape so far from
us as he would have wished In my third term he did not reappear among
us His parents had in some sort atoned Unimaginative though they
were it seems they could understand a tale of woe laid before them
circumstantially and had engaged a private tutor for their boy Fifteen
years elapsed before I saw him again

This was at the second night of some play I was dramatic critic for the
Saturday Review and weary of meeting the same lot of people over and
over again at first nights had recently sent a circular to the managers
asking that I might have seats for second nights instead I found that
there existed as distinct and invariable a lot of secondnighters as of
firstnighters The secondnighters were less showy but then they
came rather to see than to be seen and there was an air that I liked
of earnestness and hopefulness about them I used to write a great deal
about the future of the British drama and they for their part used
to think and talk a great deal about it People who care about books
and pictures find much to interest and please them in the present It
is only the students of the theatre who always fall back or rather
forward on the future Though secondnighters do come to see they
remain rather to hope and pray I should have known anywhere by the
visionary look in his eyes that Brown was a confirmed secondnighter

What surprises me is that I knew he was Brown It is true that he
had not grown much in those fifteen years his brow was still
disproportionate to his body and he looked young to have become
confirmed in any habit But it is also true that not once in the past
ten years at any rate had he flitted through my mind and poised on my
conscience

I hope that I and those other boys had long ago ceased from recurring to
him in nightmares Cordial though the hand was that I offered him and
highly civilised my whole demeanour he seemed afraid that at any moment
I might begin to dance around him shooting out my lips at him and
calling him SevenSisters Brown or something of that kind It was only
after constant meetings at second nights and innumerable entracte
talks about the future of the drama that he began to trust me In
course of time we formed the habit of walking home together as far as
Cumberland Place at which point our ways diverged I gathered that he
was still living with his parents but he did not tell me where for
they had not as I learned by reference to the Red Book moved from
Ladbroke Crescent

I found his company restful rather than inspiring His days were
spent in clerkship at one of the smaller Government Offices his
eveningsexcept when there was a second nightin reading and writing
He did not seem to know much or to wish to know more about life Books
and plays first editions and second nights were what he cared for On
matters of religion and ethics he was as little keen as he seemed to be
on human character in the raw so that though I had already suspected
him of writing or meaning to write a play my eyebrows did rise when
he told me he meant to write a play about Savonarola

He made me understand however that it was rather the name than the
man that had first attracted him He said that the name was in itself a
great incentive to blankverse He uttered it to me slowly in a voice
so much deeper than his usual voice that I nearly laughed For the
actual bearer of the name he had no heroworship and said it was by a
mere accident that he had chosen him as central figure He had
thought of writing a tragedy about Sardanapalus but the volume of the
Encyclopedia Britannica in which he was going to look up the main
facts about Sardanapalus happened to open at Savonarola Hence a sudden
and complete peripety in the students mind He told me he had read the
Encyclopedias article carefully and had dipped into one or two of
the books there mentioned as authorities He seemed almost to wish he
hadnt Facts get in ones way so he complained History is one
thing drama is another Aristotle said drama was more philosophic than
history because it showed us what men WOULD do not just what they DID
I think thats so true dont you I want to show what Savonarola WOULD
have done if He paused

If what

Well thats just the point I havent settled that yet When Ive
thought of a plot I shall go straight ahead

I said I supposed he intended his tragedy rather for the study than for
the stage This seemed to hurt him I told him that what I meant was
that managers always shied at anything without a strong feminine
interest This seemed to worry him I advised him not to think about
managers He promised that he would think only about Savonarola

I know now that this promise was not exactly kept by him and he may
have felt slightly awkward when some weeks later he told me he had
begun the play Ive hit on an initial idea he said and thats
enough to start with I gave up my notion of inventing a plot in
advance I thought it would be a mistake I dont want puppets on wires
I want Savonarola to work out his destiny in his own way Now that I
have the initial idea what Ive got to do is to make Savonarola LIVE
I hope I shall be able to do this Once hes alive I shant interfere
with him I shall just watch him Wont it be interesting He isnt
alive yet But theres plenty of time You see he doesnt come on at
the rise of the curtain A Friar and a Sacristan come on and talk about
him By the time theyve finished perhaps hell be alive But they
wont have finished yet Not that theyre going to say very much But I
write slowly

I remember the mild thrill I had when one evening he took me aside and
said in an undertone Savonarola has come on Alive For me the MS
hereinafter printed has an interest that for you it cannot have so
abristle am I with memories of the meetings I had with its author
throughout the nine years he took over it He never saw me without
reporting progress or lack of progress Just what was going on or
standing still he did not divulge After the entry of Savonarola
he never told me what characters were appearing All sorts of people
appear he would say rather helplessly They insist I cant prevent
them I used to say it must be great fun to be a creative artist but
at this he always shook his head I dont create THEY do Savonarola
especially of course I just look on and record I never know whats
going to happen next He had the advantage of me in knowing at any rate
what had happened last But whenever I pled for a glimpse he would again
shake his head

The thing MUST be judged as a whole Wait till Ive come to the end of
the Fifth Act

So impatient did I become that as the years went by I used rather to
resent his presence at second nights I felt he ought to be at his
desk His I used to tell him was the only drama whose future ought
to concern him now And in point of fact he had I think lost the true
spirit of the secondnighter and came rather to be seen than to see
He liked the knowledge that here and there in the auditorium when he
entered it some one would be saying Who is that and receiving the
answer Oh dont you know Thats Savonarola Brown This sort of
thing however did not make him cease to be the modest unaffected
fellow I had known He always listened to the advice I used to offer
him though inwardly he must have chafed at it Myself a fidgety and
uninspired person unable to begin a piece of writing before I know just
how it shall end I had always been afraid that sooner or later Brown
would take some turning that led nowhitherwould lose himself and come
to grief This fear crept into my gladness when one evening in the
spring of 1909 he told me he had finished the Fourth Act Would he win
out safely through the Fifth

He himself was looking rather glum and as we walked away from the
theatre I said to him I suppose you feel rather like Thackeray when
hed killed the Colonel youve got to kill the Monk

Not quite that he answered But of course hell die very soon now A
couple of years or so And it does seem rather sad Its not merely that
hes so full of life He has been becoming much more HUMAN lately At
first I only respected him Now I have a real affection for him

This was an interesting glimpse at last but I turned from it to my
besetting fear

Havent you I asked any notion of HOW he is to die

Brown shook his head

But in a tragedy I insisted the catastrophe MUST be led up to
step by step My dear Brown the end of the hero MUST be logical and
rational

I dont see that he said as we crossed Piccadilly Circus In actual
life it isnt so What is there to prevent a motoromnibus from knocking
me over and killing me at this moment

At that moment by what has always seemed to me the strangest of
coincidences and just the sort of thing that playwrights ought to
avoid a motoromnibus knocked Brown over and killed him

He had as I afterwards learned made a will in which he appointed me
his literary executor Thus passed into my hands the unfinished play by
whose name he had become known to so many people


I hate to say that I was disappointed in it but I had better confess
quite frankly that on the whole I was Had Brown written it quickly
and read it to me soon after our first talk about it it might in some
ways have exceeded my hopes But he had become for me by reason of that
quiet and unhasting devotion to his work while the years came and went
a sort of hero and the very mystery involving just what he was about
had addicted me to those ideas of magnificence which the unknown is said
always to foster

Even so however I am not blind to the great merits of the play as it
stands It is well that the writer of poetic drama should be a dramatist
and a poet Here is a play that abounds in striking situations and I
have searched it vainly for one line that does not scan What I nowhere
feel is that I have not elsewhere been thrilled or lulled by the same
kind of thing I do not go so far as to say that Brown inherited his
parents deplorable lack of imagination But I do wish he had been less
sensitive than he was to impressions or else had seen and read fewer
poetic dramas ancient and modern Remembering that visionary look in
his eyes remembering that he was as displeased as I by the work of all
living playwrights and as dissatisfied with the great efforts of the
Elizabethans I wonder that he was not more immune from influences

Also I cannot but wish still that he had faltered in his decision
to make no scenario There is much to be said for the theory that a
dramatist should first vitalise his characters and then leave them
unfettered but I do feel that Browns misused the confidence he reposed
in them The labour of so many years has somewhat the air of being
a mere improvisation Savonarola himself after the First Act or so
strikes me as utterly inconsistent It may be that he is just complex
like Hamlet He does in the Fourth Act show traces of that Prince I
suppose this is why he struck Brown as having become more human To me
he seems merely a poorer creature

But enough of these reservations In my anxiety for poor Browns sake
that you should not be disappointed perhaps I have been carrying
tactfulness too far and prejudicing you against that for which I
specially want your favour Here without more ado is




SAVONAROLA

A TRAGEDY

By L Brown


 ACT I

 SCENE A Room in the Monastery of San Marco Florence
 TIME 1490 AD A summer morning

 Enter the SACRISTAN and a FRIAR

 SACR
 Savonarola looks more grim today
 Than ever Should I speak my mind Id say
 That he was fashioning some new great scourge
 To flay the backs of men

 FRI
 Tis even so
 Brother Filippo saw him stand last night
 In solitary vigil till the dawn
 Lept oer the Arno and his face was such
 As men may wear in Purgatorynay
 Een in the inmost core of Hells own fires

 SACR
 I often wonder if some womans face
 Seen at some rout in his old worldling days
 Haunts him een now een here and urges him
 To fierier fury gainst the Florentines

 FRI
 Savonarola lovesick Ha ha ha
 Lovesick He lovesick Tis a goodly jest
 The CONfirmd misogyn a ladies man
 Thou must have eaten of some strange red herb
 That takes the reason captive I will swear
 Savonarola never yet hath seen
 A woman but he spurnd her Hist He comes

 Enter SAVONAROLA rapt in thought

 Give thee good morrow Brother

 SACR
 And therewith
 A multitude of morrows equalgood
 Till thou by Heavens grace hast wrought the work
 Nearest thine heart

 SAV
 I thank thee Brother yet
 I thank thee not for that my thankfulness
 An such there be gives thanks to Heaven alone

 FRI To SACR
 Tis a right answer he hath given thee
 Had Savnarola spoken less than thus
 Methinks me the less Savnarola he
 As when the snow lies on yon Apennines
 White as the hem of Mary Mothers robe
 And insusceptible to the suns rays
 Being harder to the touch than temperd steel
 Een so this great gaunt monk whitevisaged
 Upstands to Heaven and to Heavn devotes
 The scarped thoughts that crown the upper slopes
 Of his abrupt and AUStere nature

 SACR
 Aye

 Enter LUCREZIA BORGIA ST FRANCIS OF ASSISI and LEONARDO
 DA VINCI LUC is thickly veiled

 ST FRAN
 This is the place

 LUC Pointing at SAV
 And this the man Aside And I
 By the hot blood that courses i my veins
 I swear it ineluctablythe woman

 SAV
 Who is this wanton
 LUC throws back her hood revealing her face SAV starts back
 gazing at her

 ST FRAN
 Hush Sir Tis my little sister
 The poisoner right wellbelovd by all
 Whom she as yet hath spared Hither she came
 Mounted upon another little sister of mine
 A mare caparisond in goodly wise
 SheI refer now to Lucrezia
 Desireth to have word of thee anent
 Some matter that befrets her

 SAV To LUC
 Hence Begone
 Savonarola will not tempted be
 By face of woman een tho t be tho tis
 Surpassing fair All hope abandon therefore
 I charge thee Vade retro Satanas

 LEONARDO
 Sirrah thou speakst in haste as is the way
 Of monkish men The beauty of Lucrezia
 Commends not discommends her to the eyes
 Of keener thinkers than I take thee for
 I am an artist and an engineer
 Givn oer to subtile dreams of what shall be
 On this our planet I foresee a day
 When men shall skim the earth i certain chairs
 Not drawn by horses but sped on by oil
 Or other matter and shall thread the sky
 Birdlike

 LUC
 It may be as thou sayest friend
 Or may be not To SAV As touching this our errand
 I crave of thee Sir Monk an audience
 Instanter

 FRI
 Lo Here Alighieri comes
 I had methought me he was still at Parma

 Enter DANTE

 ST FRAN To DAN
 How fares my little sister Beatrice

 DAN
 She died alack last sennight

 ST FRAN
 Did she so
 If the condolences of men avail
 Thee aught take mine

 DAN
 They are of no avail

 SAV To LUC
 I do refuse thee audience

 LUC
 Then why
 Didst thou not say so promptly when I askd it

 SAV
 Full well thou knowst that I was interrupted
 By Alighieris entry
 Noise without Enter Guelfs and Ghibellines fighting
 What is this

 LUC
 I did not think that in this cloisterd spot
 There would be so much doing I had lookd
 To find Savonarola all alone
 And tempt him in his uneventful cell
 Instead o whichSpurnd am I I am I
 There was a time Sir look to t O damnation
 What is t Anon then These my toys my gauds
 That in the cradleaye t my mothers breast
 I puled and lisped atTis impossible
 Tho faith tis not so forasmuch as tis
 And I a daughter of the Borgias
 Or so they told me Liars Flatterers
 Currying lickspoons Wheres the Hell of t then
 Tis time that I were going Farewell Monk
 But Ill avenge me ere the sun has sunk
 Exeunt LUC ST FRAN and LEONARDO followed by DAN SAV having
 watched LUC out of sight sinks to his knees sobbing FRI and SACR

 the Curtain falls

 SECOND APP
 For whom is the brew destind

 FIRST APP
 I know not
 Lady Lucrezia did but lay on me
 Injunctions as regards the making of t
 The which I have obeyd It is compounded
 Of a malignant and a deadly weed
 Found not save in the Gulf of Spezia
 And one small phial of t I am advisd
 Were more than nough to slay a regiment
 Of Messer Malatestas condottieri

 The evil surface of its nether slime

 Enter LUC

 LUC To FIRST APP
 Is t done Sir Sluggard

 FIRST APP
 Madam to a turn

 LUC
 Had it not been so I with mine own hand
 Would have outpourd it down thy gullet knave
 See heres a ring of cunninglywrought gold

 That I on a dark night did purchase from
 A goldsmith on the Ponte Vecchio
 Small was his shop and hoar of visage he
 I did bemark that from the ceilings beams
 Spiders had spun their webs for many a year
 The which hung erst like swathes of gossamer
 Seen in the shadows of a fairy glade
 But now most woefully were weighted oer
 With gatherd dust Look well now at the ring
 Touchd here behold it opes a cavity
 Capacious of three drops of yon fell stuff
 Dost heed Whoso then puts it on his finger
 Dies and his soul is from his body rapt
 To Hell or Heaven as the case may be
 Take thou this toy and pour the three drops in

 Hands ring to FIRST APP and comes down c

 So Savnarola thou shalt learn that I
 Utter no threats but I do make them good
 Ere this days sun hath westerd from the view
 Thou art to preach from out the Loggia
 Dei Lanzi to the cits in the Piazza
 I thy Lucrezia will be upon the steps
 To offer thee with phrases seemingfair
 That which shall seal thine eloquence for ever
 O mighty lips that held the world in spell
 But would not meet these little lips of mine
 In the sweet way that lovers useO thin
 Cold tightdrawn bloodless lips which natheless I
 Deem of all lips the most magnifical
 In this our city

 in rebus ambulantibus Argal I stick at nothing but cobblestones
 which by the same token are stuck to the road by mens fingers

 LUC
 How many crows may nest in a grocers jerkin

 FOOL
 A full dozen at cockcrow and something less under the dogstar by
 reason of the dew which lies heavy on men taken by the scurvy

 LUC To FIRST APP
 Methinks the Fool is a fool

 FOOL
 And therefore by auricular deduction am I own twin to the Lady
 Lucrezia

 Sings

 When pears hang green on the garden wall
 With a nid and a nod and a niddyniddyo

 Tis time for loons to count the cost
 With a yea etc

 Enter the PORTER

 PORTER
 O my dear Mistress there is one below
 Demanding to have instant word of thee
 I told him that your Ladyship was not
 At home Vain perjury He would not take
 Nay for an answer

 LUC
 Ah What manner of man
 Is he

 PORTER
 A personage the like of whom
 Is wholly unfamiliar to my gaze
 Cowld is he but I saw his great eyes glare
 From their deep sockets in such wise as leopards
 Glare from their caverns crouching ere they spring
 On their reluctant prey

 LUC
 And what name gave he

 PORTER After a pause
 Somethingarola

 LUC

 Throws off cowl and frock and stands forth in the costume of a
 Renaissance nobleman LUCREZIA looks him up and down

 LUC
 Thou cutst a sorry figure

 SAV
 That
 Is neither here nor there I love you Madam

 LUC
 And this methinks is neither there nor here
 For that my love of thee hath vanished
 Seeing thee thus beprankt Go pad thy calves
 Thus mightst thou just conceivably with luck
 Capture the fancy of some servingwench

 SAV
 And this is all thou hast to say to me

 LUC
 It is

 SAV
 I am dismissd

 LUC

 Resumes frock and cowl
 Savonarola is himself once more

 LUC

 Tis with the ring Ill have the final laugh
 Tho love be sweet revenge is sweeter far
 To the Piazza Ha ha ha ha har
 Seizes ring and exit Through open door are heard as the Curtain
 falls sounds of a terrific hubbub in the Piazza


 ACT III

 SCENE The Piazza
 TIME A few minutes anterior to close of preceding Act

 The Piazza is filled from end to end with a vast seething crowd that
 is drawn entirely from the lower orders There is a sprinkling of
 wildeyed and dishevelled women in it The men are lanternjawed
 with several days growth of beard Most of them carry rude weapons
 staves billhooks crowbars and the likeand are in as excited a
 condition as the women Some of them are bareheaded others affect a
 kind of Phrygian cap Cobblers predominate

 Enter LORENZO DE MEDICI and COSIMO DE MEDICI They wear cloaks of scarlet
 brocade and to avoid notice hold masks to their faces

 COS
 What purpose doth the foul and greasy plebs
 Ensue today here

 LOR
 I nor know nor care

 COS
 How thralld thou art to the philosophy
 Of Epicurus Naught thats human I
 Deem alien from myself To a COBBLER Make answer fellow
 What empty hope hath drawn thee by a thread
 Forth from the OBscene hovel where thou starvest

 COB
 No empty hope your Honour but the full
 Assurance that today as yesterday
 Savonarola will let loose his thunder
 Against the vices of the idle rich
 And from the brimming cornucopia
 Of his immense vocabulary pour
 Scorn on the lamentable heresies
 Of the New Learning and on all the art
 Later than Giotto

 COS
 Mark how absolute
 The knave is

 LOR
 Then are parrots rational
 When they regurgitate the thing they hear
 This fool is but an unit of the crowd
 And crowds are senseless as the vasty deep
 That sinks or surges as the moon dictates
 I know these crowds and know that any man
 That hath a glib tongue and a rolling eye
 Can as he willeth with them
 Removes his mask and mounts steps of Loggia
 Citizens
 Prolonged yells and groans from the crowd
 Yes I am he I am that same Lorenzo
 Whom you have nicknamed the Magnificent
 Further terrific yells shakings of fists brandishings of bill
 hooks insistent cries of Death to Lorenzo Down with the
 Magnificent Cobblers on fringe of crowd down c exhibit especially
 all the symptoms of epilepsy whoopingcough and other ailments
 You love not me
 The crowd makes an ugly rush LOR appears likely to be dragged down
 and torn limb from limb but raises one hand in nick of time and
 continues
 Yet I deserve your love
 The yells are now variegated with dubious murmurs A cobbler down c
 thrusts his face feverishly in the face of another and repeats in a
 hoarse interrogative whisper Deserves our love
 Not for the sundry boons I have bestowd
 And benefactions I have lavished
 Upon Firenze City of the Flowers
 But for the love that in this rugged breast
 I bear you
 The yells have now died away and there is a sharp fall in dubious
 murmurs The cobbler down c says in an earpiercing whisper The
 love he bears us drops his lower jaw nods his head repeatedly and
 awaits in an intolerable state of suspense the orators next words
 I am not a blameless man
 Some dubious murmurs
 Yet for that I have lovd you passing much
 Shall some things be forgiven me
 Noises of cordial assent
 There dwells
 In this our city known unto you all
 A man more virtuous than I am and
 A thousand times more intellectual
 Yet envy not I him forshall I name him
 He loves not you His name I will not cut
 Your hearts by speaking it Here let it stay
 On tip o tongue
 Insistent clamour
 Then steel you to the shock
 Savonarola
 For a moment or so the crowd reels silently under the shock Cobbler
 down c is the first to recover himself and cry Death to Savonarola
 The cry instantly becomes general LOR holds up his hand and
 gradually imposes silence
 His twin bugbears are
 Yourselves and that New Learning which I hold
 Less dear than only you
 Profound sensation Everybody whispers Than only you to everybody
 else A woman near steps of Loggia attempts to kiss hem of LORs
 garment
 Would you but con
 With me the old philosophers of Hellas
 Her fervent bards and calm historians
 You would arise and say We will not hear
 Another word against them
 The crowd already says this repeatedly with great emphasis
 Take the Dialogues
 Of Plato for example You will find
 A spirit far more truly Christian
 In them than in the ravings of the soursould
 Savonarola
 Prolonged cries of Death to the SourSouled Savonarola Several
 cobblers detach themselves from the crowd and rush away to read the
 Platonic Dialogues Enter SAVONAROLA The crowd as he makes his way
 through it gives up all further control of its feelings and makes a
 noise for which even the best zoologists might not find a good
 comparison The staves and billhooks wave like twigs in a storm
 One would say that SAV must have died a thousand deaths already He
 is however unharmed and unruffled as he reaches the upper step of
 the Loggia LOR meanwhile has rejoined COS in the Piazza

 SAV
 Pax vobiscum brothers
 This does but exacerbate the crowds frenzy

 VOICE OF A COBBLER
 Hear his false lips cry Peace when there is no
 Peace

 SAV
 Are not you ashamed O Florentines
 Renewed yells but also some symptoms of manly shame
 That hearkend to Lorenzo and now reel
 Inebriate with the exuberance
 Of his verbosity
 The crowd makes an obvious effort to pull itself together
 A man can fool
 Some of the people all the time and can
 Fool all the people sometimes but he cannot
 Fool ALL the people ALL the time
 Loud cheers Several cobblers clap one another on the back Cries
 of Death to Lorenzo The meeting is now well in hand
 Today
 I must adopt a somewhat novel course
 In dealing with the awful wickedness
 At present noticeable in this city
 I do so with reluctance Hitherto
 I have avoided personalities
 But now my sense of duty forces me
 To a departure from my custom of
 Naming no names One name I must and shall
 Name
 All eyes are turned on LOR who smiles uncomfortably
 No I do not mean Lorenzo He
 Is neath contempt
 Loud and prolonged laughter accompanied with hideous grimaces at LOR
 Exeunt LOR and COS
 I name a womans name
 The women in the crowd eye one another suspiciously
 A name known to you allfoursyllabled
 Beginning with an L
 Pause Enter hurriedly LUC carrying the ring She stands
 unobserved by any one on outskirt of crowd SAV utters the name
 Lucrezia

 LUC With equal intensity
 Savonarola
 SAV starts violently and stares in direction of her voice
 Yes I come I come
 Forces her way to steps of Loggia The crowd is much bewildered and
 the cries of Death to Lucrezia Borgia are few and sporadic
 Why didst thou call me
 SAV looks somewhat embarrassed
 What is thy distress
 I see it all The sanguinary mob
 Clusters to rend thee As the antlerd stag
 With fine eyes glazed from the toolong chase
 Turns to defy the foamfleckd pack and thinks
 In his last moment of some graceful hind
 Seen once afar upon a mountaintop
 Een so Savonarola didst thou think
 In thy most dire extremity of me
 And here I am Courage The horrid hounds
 Droop tail at sight of me and fawn away
 Innocuous
 The crowd does indeed seem to have fallen completely under the sway
 of LUCs magnetism and is evidently convinced that it had been about
 to make an end of the monk
 Take thou and wear henceforth
 As a sure talisman gainst future perils
 This little little ring
 SAV makes awkward gesture of refusal Angry murmurs from the crowd
 Cries of Take thou the ring Churl Put it on etc
 Enter the Borgias FOOL and stands unnoticed on fringe of crowd
 I hoped you ld like it
 Neat but not gaudy Is my taste at fault
 Id so lookd forward to
 Sob No Im not crying
 But just a little hurt
 Hardly a dry eye in the crowd Also swayings and snarlings
 indicative that SAVs life is again not worth a moments purchase
 SAV makes awkward gesture of acceptance but just as he is about to
 put ring on finger the FOOL touches his lute and sings

 Wear not the ring
 It hath an unkind sting
 Ding dong ding
 Bide a minute
 Theres poison in it
 Poison in it
 Dingadong dong ding

 LUC
 The fellow lies
 The crowd is torn with conflicting opinions Mingled cries of Wear
 not the ring The fellow lies Bide a minute Death to the
 Fool Silence for the Fool Dingadong dong ding etc

 FOOL Sings
 Wear not the ring
 For Deaths a robberking
 Ding etc
 Theres no trinket
 Is what you think it
 What you think it
 Dingadong etc

 SAV throws ring in LUCs face Enter POPE JULIUS II with Papal
 army
 POPE
 Arrest that man and woman
 Reenter Guelfs and Ghibellines fighting SAV and LUC are arrested
 by Papal officers Enter MICHAEL ANGELO ANDREA DEL SARTO appears for a
 moment at a window PIPPA passes Brothers of the Misericordia go by
 singing a Requiem for Francesca da Rimini Enter BOCCACCIO BENVENUTO
 CELLINI and many others making remarks highly characteristic of
 themselves but scarcely audible through the terrific thunderstorm
 which now bursts over Florence and is at its loudest and darkest
 crisis as the Curtain falls


 ACT IV

 TIME Three hours later
 SCENE A Dungeon on the groundfloor of the Palazzo Civico

 The stage is bisected from top to bottom by a wall on one side of
 which is seen the interior of LUCREZIAS cell on the other that of
 SAVONAROLAS

 Neither he nor she knows that the other is in the next cell The
 audience however knows this

 Each cell because of the width and height of the proscenium is of
 more than the average Florentine size but is bare even to the point
 of severity its sole amenities being some straw a hunk of bread and
 a stone pitcher The door of each is facing the audience Dimish
 light

 LUCREZIA wears long and clanking chains on her wrists as does also
 SAVONAROLA Imprisonment has left its mark on both of them SAVONAROLAS
 hair has turned white His whole aspect is that of a very old old
 man LUCREZIA looks no older than before but has gone mad

 SAV
 Alas how long ago this morning seems
 This evening A thousand thousand eons
 Are scarce the measure of the gulf betwixt
 My then and now Methinks I must have been
 Here since the dim creation of the world
 And never in that interval have seen
 The tremulous hawthorn burgeon in the brake
 Nor heard the hum o bees nor woven chains
 Of buttercups on Mount Fiesole
 What time the sap lept in the cypresses
 Imbuing with the friskfulness of Spring
 Those melancholy trees I do forget
 The aspect of the sun Yet I was born
 A freeman and the Saints of Heaven smiled
 Down on my crib What would my sire have said
 And what my dam had anybody told them
 The time would come when I should occupy
 A felons cell O the disgrace of it
 The scandal the incredible comedown
 It masters me I see i my minds eye
 The public printsSharp Sentence on a Monk
 What then I thought I was of sterner stuff
 Than is affrighted by what people think
 Yet thought I so because twas thought of me
 And so twas thought of me because I had
 A hawklike profile and a baleful eye
 Lo my souls chin recedes soft to the touch
 As halfchurnd butter Seeming hawk is dove
 And doves a gaolbird now Fie out upon t

 LUC
 How comes it I am Empress Dowager
 Of Chinayet was never crownd This must
 Be seen to
 Quickly gathers some straw and weaves a crown which she puts on

 SAV
 O what a degringolade
 The great career I had mappd out for me
 Nippd i the bud What life when I come out
 Awaits me Why the very Novices
 And callow Postulants will draw aside
 As I pass by and say That man hath done
 Time And yet shall I wince The worst of Time
 Is not in having done it but in doing t

 LUC
 Ha ha ha ha Eleven billion pigtails
 Do tremble at my nod imperial
 The which is as it should be

 SAV
 I have heard
 That gaolers oft are willing to carouse
 With them they watch oer and do sink at last
 Into a drunken sleep and thens the time
 To snatch the keys and make a bid for freedom
 Gaoler Ho Gaoler
 Sounds of lock being turned and bolts withdrawn Enter the Borgias
 FOOL in plain clothes carrying bunch of keys
 I have seen thy face
 Before

 FOOL
 I saved thy life this afternoon Sir

 SAV
 Thou art the Borgias Fool

 FOOL
 Say rather was
 Unfortunately I have been dischargd
 For my betrayal of Lucrezia
 So that I have to speak like other men
 Decasyllabically and with sense
 An hour ago the gaoler of this dungeon
 Died of an apoplexy Hearing which
 I askd for and obtaind his billet

 SAV
 Fetch
 A stoup o liquor for thyself and me
 Exit GAOLER
 Freedom theres nothing that thy votaries
 Grudge in the cause of thee That decent man
 Is doomd by me to lose his place again
 Tomorrow morning when he wakes from out
 His hoggish slumber Yet I care not
 Reenter GAOLER with a leathern bottle and two glasses
 Ho
 This is the stuff to warm our vitals this
 The panacea for all mortal ills
 And sure elixir of eternal youth
 Drink bonniman
 GAOLER drains a glass and shows signs of instant intoxication SAV
 claps him on shoulder and replenishes glass GAOLER drinks again lies
 down on floor and snores SAV snatches the bunch of keys laughs
 long but silently and creeps out on tiptoe leaving door ajar
 LUC meanwhile has lain down on the straw in her cell and fallen
 asleep
 Noise of bolts being shot back jangling of keys grating of lock and
 the door of LUCS cell flies open SAV takes two steps across the
 threshold his arms outstretched and his upturned face transfigured
 with a great joy
 How sweet the open air
 Leaps to my nostrils O the good brown earth
 That yields once more to my elastic tread
 And laves these feet with its rememberd dew
 Takes a few more steps still looking upwards
 FreeI am free O naked arc of heaven
 Enspangled with innumerableno
 Stars are not there Yet neither are there clouds
 The thing looks like a ceiling Gazes downward And this thing
 Looks like a floor Gazes around And that white bundle yonder
 Looks curiously like Lucrezia
 LUC awakes at sound of her name and sits up sane
 There must be some mistake

 LUC Rises to her feet
 There is indeed
 A pretty sort of prison I have come to
 In which a selfrespecting ladys cell
 Is treated as a lounge

 SAV
 I had no notion
 You were in here I thought I was out there
 I will explainbut first Ill make amends
 Here are the keys by which your durance ends
 The gate is somewhere in this corridor
 And so goodbye to this interior
 Exeunt SAV and LUC Noise a moment later of a key grating in a
 lock then of gate creaking on its hinges triumphant laughs of
 fugitives loud slamming of gate behind them
 In SAVs cell the GAOLER starts in his sleep turns his face to the
 wall and snores more than ever deeply Through open door comes a
 cloaked figure

 CLOAKED FIGURE
 Sleep on Savonarola and awake
 Not in this dungeon but in ruby Hell
 Stabs Gaoler whose snores cease abruptly Enter POPE JULIUS II with
 Papal retinue carrying torches MURDERER steps quickly back into
 shadow

 POPE To body of GAOLER
 Savonarola I am come to taunt
 Thee in thy misery and dire abjection
 Rise Sir and hear me out

 MURD Steps forward
 Great Julius
 Waste not thy breath Savonarolas dead
 I murderd him

 POPE
 Thou hadst no right to do so
 Who art thou pray

 MURD
 Cesare Borgia
 Lucrezias brother and I claim a brothers
 Right to assassinate whatever man
 Shall wantonly and in cold blood reject
 Her timid offer of a poisond ring

 POPE
 Of this anon
 Stands over body of GAOLER
 Our present business
 Is general woe No nobler corse hath ever
 Impressd the ground O let the trumpets speak it
 Flourish of trumpets
 This was the noblest of the Florentines
 His character was flawless and the world
 Held not his parallel O bear him hence
 With all such honours as our State can offer
 He shall interred be with noise of cannon
 As doth befit so militant a nature
 Prepare these obsequies
 Papal officers lift body of GAOLER

 A PAPAL OFFICER
 But this is not
 Savonarola It is some one else

 CESARE
 Lo tis none other than the Fool that I
 Hoofd from my household but two hours agone
 I deemd him no good riddance for he had
 The knack of setting tables on a roar
 What shadows we pursue Good night sweet Fool
 And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest

 POPE
 Interred shall he be with signal pomp
 No honour is too great that we can pay him
 He leaves the world a vacuum Meanwhile
 Go we in chase of the accursed villain
 That hath made escapado from this cell
 To horse Away Well scour the country round
 For Savnarola till we hold him bound
 Then shall you see a cinder not a man
 Beneath the lightnings of the Vatican
 Flourish alarums and excursions flashes of Vatican lightning roll
 of drums etc Through open door of cell is led in a large milkwhite
 horse which the POPE mounts as the Curtain falls


Remember please before you formulate your impressions that saying
of Browns The thing must be judged as a whole I like to think that
whatever may seem amiss to us in these Four Acts of his would have been
righted by collation with that Fifth which he did not live to achieve

I like too to measure with my eyes the yawning gulf between stage and
study Very different from the message of cold print to our imagination
are the messages of flesh and blood across footlights to our eyes and
ears In the warmth and brightness of a crowded theatre Savonarola
might for aught one knows seem perfect Then why I hear my gentle
readers asking did you thrust the play on US and not on a theatrical
manager

That question has a false assumption in it In the course of the past
eight years I have thrust Savonarola on any number of theatrical
managers They have all of them been to use the technical phrase very
kind All have seen great merits in the work and if I added
together all the various merits thus seen I should have no doubt that
Savonarola was the best play never produced The point on which all
the managers are unanimous is that they have no use for a play without
an ending This is why I have fallen back at last on gentle readers
whom now I hear asking why I did not as Browns literary executor try
to finish the play myself Can they never ask a question without a false
assumption in it I did try hard to finish Savonarola

Artistically of course the making of such an attempt was indefensible
Humanly not so It is clear throughout the playespecially perhaps in
Acts III and IVthat if Brown had not steadfastly in his mind the hope
of production on the stage he had nothing in his mind at all Horrified
though he would have been by the idea of letting me kill his Monk
he would rather have done even this than doom his play to everlasting
unactedness I took therefore my courage in both hands and made out a
scenario

Dawn on summit of Mount Fiesole Outspread view of Florence Duomo
Giottos Tower etc as seen from that eminenceNICCOLO MACHIAVELLI
asleep on grass wakes as sun rises Deplores his exile from Florence
LORENZOS unappeasable hostility etc Wonders if he could not somehow
secure the POPES favour Very cynical Breaks off But who are these
that scale the mountainside  Savonarola and Lucrezia  BorgiaEnter
through a trapdoor back c trapdoor veiled from audience by a
grassy ridge SAV and LUC Both gasping and footsore from their climb
Still with chains on their wrists or notMACH steps unobserved
behind a cypress and listensSAV has a speech to the rising sunTh
effulgent hope that westers from the east  Daily Says that his hope
on the contrary lies in escape To that which easters not from out
the west  That fixd abode of freedom which men call  America Very
bitter against POPELUC says that she for her part means To start
afresh in that uncharted land  Which austers not from out the antipod
 AustraliaExit MACH unobserved down trapdoor behind ridge to
betray LUC and SAVSeveral longish speeches by SAV and LUC Time is
thus given for MACH to get into touch with POPE and time for POPE and
retinue to reach the slope of Fiesole SAV glancing down across ridge
sees these sleuthhounds points them out to LUC and cries Bewrayd
LUC By whom SAV I know not but suspect  The hand of that sleek
serpent Niccolo  MachiavelliSAV and LUC rush down c but find
their way barred by the footlightsLUC We will not be taen Alive
And here availeth us my lore  In what pertains to poison Yonder herb
 points to a herb growing down r Is deadly nightshade Quick
Monk Pluck we itSAV and LUC die just as POPE appears over ridge
followed by retinue in full cryPOPES annoyance at being foiled
is quickly swept away on the great wave of Shakespearean chivalry and
charity that again rises in him He gives SAV a funeral oration similar
to the one meant for him in Act IV but even more laudatory and more
stricken Of LUC too he enumerates the virtues and hints that the
whole terrestrial globe shall be hollowed to receive her bones Ends
by saying In deference to this our double sorrow  Sun shall not shine
today nor shine tomorrowSun drops quickly back behind eastern
horizon leaving a great darkness on which the Curtain slowly falls


All this might be worse yes The skeleton passes muster But in the
attempt to incarnate and ensanguine it I failed wretchedly I saw that
Brown was in comparison with me a master Thinking I might possibly
fare better in his method of work than in my own I threw the skeleton
into a cupboard sat down and waited to see what Savonarola and those
others would do

They did absolutely nothing I sat watching them pen in hand ready to
record their slightest movement Not a little finger did they raise
Yet I knew they must be alive Brown had always told me they were quite
independent of him Absurd to suppose that by the accident of his
own death they had ceased to breathe Now and then overcome with
weariness I dozed at my desk and whenever I woke I felt that these
rigid creatures had been doing all sorts of wonderful things while my
eyes were shut I felt that they disliked me I came to dislike them in
return and forbade them my room

Some of you my readers might have better luck with them than I Invite
them propitiate them watch them The writer of the best Fifth Act sent
to me shall have his work tacked on to Browns and I suppose I could
get him a free pass for the second night
