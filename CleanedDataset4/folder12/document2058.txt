A NOTE ON THE AUTHOR OF MESSER MARCO POLO

So Celtic in feeling and atmosphere are the stories of Donn Byrne that
many of his devotees have come to believe that he never lived anywhere
but in Ireland Actually Donn Byrne was born in New York City
Shortly after his birth however his parents took him back to the land
of his forefathers There he was educated and came to know the people
of whom he wrote so magically At Dublin University his love for the
Irish language and for a good fight won him many prizes first as a
writer in Gaelic and second as the Universitys lightweight boxing
champion After continuing his studies at the Sorbonne and the
University of Leipzig he returned to the United States where in
1911 he married and established a home in Brooklyn Heights He earned
his living while trying to write short stories as an editor of
dictionaries Soon his tales began to attract attention and he added to
his collection of boxing prizes many others won in shortstory
contests When MESSER MARCO POLO appeared in 1921 his reputation in
the literary world was firmly established Thereafter whatever he
wrote was hailed enthusiastically by his evergrowing public until
1928 when his tragic death in an automobile accident cut short the
career of one of Americas bestloved storytellers


JTABLE 4 23 1


MESSER MARCO POLO

The message came to me at the second check of the hunt that a
countryman and a clansman needed me The ground was heavy the day
raw and it was a drag too fast for fun and too tame for sport So I
blessed the countryman and the clansman and turned my back on the
field

But when they told me his name I all but fell from the saddle

But that mans dead

But he wasnt dead He was in New York He was traveling from the
craigs of Ulster to his grandson who had an orangegrove on the Indian
River in Florida He wasnt dead And I said to myself with
impatience Must every man born ninety years ago be dead

But this is a damned thing I thought to be saddled with a man over
ninety years old To have to act as GARDEMALADE at my age Why
couldnt he have stayed and died at home Sure one of these days he
will die as we all die and the ghost of him will never be content on
the sluggish river by the mossy trees where the blue herons and the
white cranes and the great gray pelicans fly It will be going back I
know to the booming surf and the redberried rowantrees and the
barking eagles of Antrim To die out of Ulster when one can die in
Ulster there is a gey foolish thing

But the harsh logic of Ulster left me and the soft mood of Ulster came
on me as I remembered him and I going into the town on the train And
the late winter grass of Westchester spare scrofulous the
jerrybuilt bungalows the lines of uncomely linen the blatant
advertising boardsall the unbeauty of it passed away and I was again
in the Antrim glens There was the soft purple of the Irish Channel
and there the soft dim outline of Scotland There was the herring
school silver in the sun and I could see it from the crags where the
surf boomed like a drum And underfoot was the springy heather the
belled and purple heather

And there came to me again the vision of the old mans thatched
farmhouse when the moon was up and the bats were out and the winds of
the County Antrim came bellying down the glens The turf fire burned
on the hearth now red now yellow and there was the golden light of
lamps and Malachi of the Long Glen was reciting some poem of Blind
Rafterys or the lament of Pierre Ronsard for Mary Queen of Scots

 Ta ribin o mo cheadshearc ann mo phocs sios
 Agas mna Eirip ni leigheasfadaois mo bhron faraor
 Ta me reidh leat go ndeantar comhra caol
 Agas gobhfasfaidh an fear no dhiaidh sin thrid mo lar anios

 There is a ribbon from my only love in my pocket deep
 And the women of Europe they could not cure my grief alas
 I am done with you until a narrow coffin be made for me
 And until the grass shall grow after that up through my heart

And I suddenly discovered on the rumbling train that apart from the
hurling and the football and the jumping of horses what life I
remembered of Ulster was bound up in Malachi Campbell of the Long
Glen

A very strange old man hardy as a blackthorn immense bowed
shoulders the face of some old hawk of the mountains hair white and
plentiful as some old cardinals All his kinsfolk were dead except
for one granddaughter And he had become a tradition in the glens
It was said he had been an ecclesiastical student abroad in
Valladolidand that he had forsaken that life And in France he had
been a tutor in the family of MacMahon roi d Irlandeand somewhere
he had married and his wife had died and left him moneyand he had
come back to Antrim He had been in the Papal Zouaves and fought
also in the American Civil War A strange old figure who knew Greek
and Latin as well as most professors and who had never forgotten his
Gaelic

Antrim will ever color my own writing My Fifth Avenue will have
something in it of the heather glen My people will have always a
phrase a thought a flash of ScotsIrish mysticism and for that I
must either thank or blame Malachi Campbell of the Long Glen The
stories I heard and I young were not of Little Rollo and Sir Walter
Scotts but the horrible tale of the Naked Hangman who goes through
the Valleys on Midsummers Eve of Dermot and Granye of the Bright
Breasts of the Cattle Raid of Maeve Queen of Connacht of the old age
of Cuchulain in the Island of Skye grisly homely stories such as yon
of the ghostly footballers of Cushendun whose ball is a skull and
whose goal is the portals of a ruined graveyard strange religious
poems like the Dialogue of Death and the Sinner

 Do thugainn loistin do gach deoraidh treithlag
 I used to give lodging to every poor wanderer
 Food and drink to him I would see in want
 His proper payment to the man requesting reckoning
 Och Is not Jesus hard if he condemns me

All these stories of all these people he told had the unreal
shimmering quality of that mirage that is seen from Portrush cliffs a
glittering city in a golden desert surrounded by a strange sea mist
All these songs all these words he spoke were native had the same
tang as the turf smoke the Gaelic quality that is in dark lakes on
mountains summits in plovers nests amid the heather And to
remember them now in New York to see him

Fifteen years had changed him but little little more tremor and
slowness in the walk a bow to the great shoulders an eye that flashed
like a knife

And what do you think of New York Malachi

I was here before your honor will remember I fought at the
Wilderness

I forbore asking him what change he had found I saw his quivering
nostrils

In a few days he would proceed south when he had orientated himself
after the days of shipboard

That night it seemed every one chose to come in and cluster around the
fire Randall the poet and the two blond Danish girls with their
hair like flax Fraser the golfer just over from Prestwick and a
young writer with his spurs yet to win and this oneand that one

They all kept silence as old Malach spoke sportsmen artists men and
women of the world a hush came on them and their eyes showed they were
not before the crackling fire in the long rooms but amazed in the
Antrim glens

Yes old Malachi said things were changed over there and a greater
change was liable People whispered that in the Valley of the Black
Pig the Boar without Bristles had been seen at the close of the day
and in Templemore there was a bleeding image and these were ominous
portents Some folks believed and some didnt And the great Irish
hunter that had won the Grand National the greatest horse in the
world But our Man of War Malachi Oh sure all he could do was
run and a hare or a greyhound could beat him at that but Shawn
Spadah a great jumper him as well as a runner in fine a horse
And did I know that Red Simon McEwer of Cushundall had gone around
Portrush in eighteen consecutive fours A Rathlin Islander had tried
the swim across to Scotland but didnt make it and there was great
arguing as to whether it was because of the currents or of lack of
strength There were rumblings in the Giants Causewayvery
strange A woman in Oran had the second sight the most powerful gift
of second sight in generations There was a new piper in Islay and
it was said he was a second McCrimmon And a new poet had arisen in
Uist and all over the Highlands they were reciting his songs and his
Lament for the Bruce Was I still as keen for did I still remember
the poems and the great stories

Behold the night is of great length I quoted Unbearable Tell
us therefore of those wondrous deeds

If youve remembered your Gaidhlig as youve remembered your Greek

Its a long time since youve had a story of me twelve long years
and its a long time before youll have another and I going away
tomorrow Old Sergeant Death has his warrant out for me this many a
day and its only the wisdom of an old dog fox that eludes him but
hell lay me by the heels one of these daysthen therell be an end
to the grand stories So after this if youre wanting a story you
must be writing it yourself

But before I die Ill leave you the story of Marco Polo Theres
been a power of books written about Marco Polo The scholars have
pushed up their spectacles and brushed the cobwebs from their ears and
theyve said Theres all there is about Marco Polo

But the scholars are a queer and blind people Brian Oge Ive heard
tell theres a doctor in Spain can weigh the earth But he cant plow
a furrow that is needful for planting corn The scholars can tell how
many are the feathers in a birds wing but it takes me to inform the
doctors why the call comes to them and they fly over oceans without
compass or sextant or sight of land

Did you ever see a scholar standing in front of a slip of a girl In
all his learning he can find nothing to say to her And every penny
poet in the country knows

Let you be listening now Brian Oge and let also the scholars be
listening But whether the scholars do or not Im not caring A pope
once listened to me with great respect and a marshal of France and
poets without number But the scholars do be turning up their noses
And mind you Ive got as much scholarship as the next man as youll
see from my story

Barring myself is there no one in this house that takes snuff No
Ah well times do be changing



CHAPTER I

Now its nearing night on the first day of spring and you could see
how loath day was to be going for even the short time until the rising
of the sun again And though there was a chill on the canals yet
there was great color to the sunset the red of it on the water ebbing
into orange and then to purple and losing itself in the olive pools
near the mooringties And a little wind came up from the Greek
islands and now surged and fluttered the way youd think a harper
might be playing Youd hear no sound but the melody was there It
was the rhythm of spring that the old people recognize

But the young people would know it was spring too by token of the
gaiety that was in the air For nothing brings joy to the heart like
the coming of spring The folk who do be blind all the rest of the
year their eyes do open then and a sunset takes them and the wee
virgin flowers coming up between the stones or the twitter of a bird
upon the bough And young women do be preening themselves and young
men do be singing even they that have the voices of rooks There is
something stirring in them that is stirring in the ground with the
bursting of the seeds

And young Marco Polo threw down the quill in the counting house where
he was learning his trade The night was coming on He was only a
strip of a lad and to lads the night is not rest from work and the
quietness of sleeping but gaming and drinking and courting young
women Now there were two women he might have gone to and one was a
great Venetian lady with hair the red of a queens cloak and a great
noble shape to her and great dignity But with her he would only be
reciting verses or making grand stilted compliments the like of those
you would hear in a play And while that seemed to fit in with winter
and candlelight it was poor sport for spring The other one was a
black plump little gownmaker a pleasant singing little woman very
affectionate and very proud to have one of the great Polos loving her
She was eager for kissing and always asking the lad to be careful of
himself to be putting his cloak on or to be sure and drink something
warm when he got home that night for the air from the canals was
chill The great lady was too much of the mind and the little
gownmaker was too much of the body either of them to be pleasing
young Marco on the first night of spring

Now it is a queer thing will be pleasing a young man on the first
night of spring The wandering foot itches and the mind and body are
keen to follow There is that inside a young man that makes the
hunting dog rise from the hearth on a moonlit night Begor its
myselfll take a turn through the fields on the chance of a bit of
coursing A weasel maybe or an otter would be out the night Or a
hare itself Ay there would be sport for you The hare running
hellforleather and me after him over brake and dell Ay Ay Ay
A good hunts a jewel Ill take a stretch along the road

Or there is in him what does be troubling the birds and they on tropic
islands Tweettweet they grumble A grand place this surely and
very comfortable for the winter The palmtrees are green but Id
rather have the green of young grass And the sea you ken it becomes
monotonous Do you remember the peaches of Champagne wife and the
cherrytrees of Antrim Do you remember the farmer who was such a bad
shot and his wife with the red petticoat Im feeling fine and strong
in the wings AVOURNEEN What do you say Lets bundle and go

He wandered out with the discontent of the season on him The sun had
dropped at last and everywhere youd see torches and the image of
torches in the water On the canals of the town great barges moved
Everywhere were fine noble shadows and the splashing of oars There
was a great admirals galley ready to put to sea against Genoa There
a big merchantman back from Africa And along the canals went all the
people in the world youd think Now it was a Frenchman all silks
and satins and ladida monsieur Or a Spaniard with a pointed
beard and long lean legs and a long lean sword And now it was a
Greek courtesan white as milk sitting in her gondola as on a throne
Here was a Muscovite hairy dirty with fine fur and fine jewels and
teeth sharp as a dogs And now an effeminate Greek nobleman languid
as a bride And here were Moorish captains Othellos men great
giants of black marble and swarthy hooknosed merchants of Palestine
and the squires of Crusaderspretty ringleted boys swearing like
demons And here and there were Scots and Irish mercenaries kilted
sensitive folk one moment smiling at you and the next a knife in your
gizzard

And as he went through the courts there were whispers and laughter and
occasionally a soft voice invited him to enter but he smiled and shook
his head Near the Canal de Mestre which is close by the Ghetto he
stopped by the wineshop called The Prince of Bulgaria and he could
hear great disputation And some were speaking of Baldwin II and how
he had no guts to have let Palaeologus take Constantinople from him
And others were murmuring about Genoa

Mark us they mean trouble those dogs Better wipe them off the face
of the earth now And a group were discussing the chances of raiding
the Jewish Kingdom of the Yemen Theyve got temples there roofed
with gold And an Irish piper was playing on a little silver set
of pipes and an Indian magician was doing great sleight of hand

Ill go in and talk to the strange foreign people said Marco Polo



CHAPTER II

Now you might be thinking that the picture Im drawing is out of my
own head Let you not be thinking of it as it is now a city of
shadows and ghosts with a few scant visitors mooning in the canals
The Pride of the West she was the Jewel of the East Constantinople
was her courtyard Greece Egypt Abyssinia Bulgaria and Muscovy
her tenacre fields The Crusaders on their way to fight the Saracen
stopped to plead for her help and generosity There were no soldiers
more chivalrous not even the French There were no better fighters
not even the Highland clans Sailors Youd think those fellows had
invented the sea And as for riches and treasures oh the wonder of
the world she was Tribute she had from everywhere the four great
horses of Saint Mark they came from Constantinople The two great
marble columns facing the Piazetta sure they came from Acre When
foreign powers wanted the loan of money it was to Venice they came
Consider the probity of Venetian men They once held as pledge the
Crown of Thorns itself King Louis IX of France redeemed it

The processions of the tradespeople were like a kings retinue and
they marching in state on the election of a doge Each in their
separate order theyd come the master smiths first as is right every
one garlanded like a conqueror with their banner and their buglers
The furriers next in ermine and taffeta the tanners with silver cups
filled with wine the tailors in white with vermilion stars the
woolworkers with olive branches the quiltmakers in cloaks trimmed
with fleurdelis the clothofgold weavers with golden crowns set
with pearls the shoemakers in fine silk while the silkworkers were
in fustian the cheesedealers and porkbutchers in scarlet and purple
the fishmongers and poulterers armed like menofwar the
glassmakers with elegant specimens of their art the combmakers
with little birds in cages the barbersurgeons on horseback very
dignified very learned and with that youd think thered be an end to
them but cast your eye back on that procession and youd find guilds
as far as your sight would reach

Let you be going down the markets and what would you see for sale
Boots clothes bread No they were out of sight but scattered on
the booths the like of farls of bread on a fairday youd find cloves
and nutmegs mace and ebony from Moluccas that had come by way of
Alexandria and the Syrian ports sandalwood from Timor in Asia
camphor from Borneo Sumatra and Java sent benzoin to her markets
Cochin China sent bitter aloeswood From China and Japan and from
Siam came gum spices silks chessmen and curiosities for the parlor
Rubies from Peru fine cloths from Coromandel and finer still from
Bengal They got spikenard from Nepaul and Bhutan Their diamonds were
from Golconda From Nirmul they purchased Damascus steel for their
swords Nor is that all youd see and youd be going down by the
markets on a sunny morning and a finethinking lowvoiced woman on
your arm Youd see pearls and sapphires topaz and cinnamon from
Ceylon lac and agates brocades and coral from Cambay hammered
vessels and inlaid weapons and embroidered shawls from Cashmere As
for spices never would your nostrils meet such an odor bdellium from
Scinde musk from Tibet galbanum from Khorasan from Afghanistan
asafetida from Persia sagapenum ambergris and civet from Zanzibar
and from Zanzibar came ivory too And from Zeila Berbera and Shehri
came balsam and frankincense

And that was Venice and Marco Polo a young man And now its only a
town like any other town but for its churches and canals Theres many
a town has ghosts but none the ghosts that Venice has not Rome
itself or Tara of the kings

 Once did she hold Randall quoted the gorgeous East in fee
 And was the safeguard of the West the worth
 Of Venice did not fall below her birth
 Venice the eldest Child of Liberty
 She was a maiden city bright and free
 No guile seduced no force could violate
 And when she took unto herself a mate
 She must espouse the everlasting Sea

Time is the greatest rogue of all Not all the arrows of Attila can do
the damage of a trickle of sand in an hourglass Tyre and Sidon
Carthage ancient Babylon and Venice queen of them all

I am describing Venice to you for this reason You might now stand
where Troys walls once were and say to yourself Was this where
Helen walked with her little son Was this where the loveliest face of
ages wept And a chill of doubt would come on you and you would
think Ive been wasting my sorrow and wasting my love for it was all
nothing but an old tale made up in a minstrels head

And sometime in Venice after your dinner in a hotel youd go out for
a while in a BARCA that would have no more romance to it nor the bark
a gillie would row and you salmonfishing on a cold blustery day and
you would feel disappointed you having come so far and youd say It
was a grand story surely and bravely did it pass the winter evening
but wasnt old Malachi of the Long Glen the liar of the world

I wouldnt have you saying that and I dead In all Im telling you
Id have you to know theres not a haporth of lie



CHAPTER III

And so Marco Polo went into the wineshop to see and hear the strange
foreign people

It was a dark long room very high full of shadows between the
flaming torches on the wall At one side of it was a great fire
burning for all it was the first night of spring At one end of it
were the great barrels of liquor for the thirsty customers black beer
for the English and the Irish grand hairy stuff with great foam to
it and brown beer for the Germans and there was white wine there for
the French people and red wine for the Italians asquebaugh for the
Scots and rum from the sugar cane for such as had cold in their bones
There was all kind of drink there in the brassbound barrelsdrink
would make you mad and drink would make you merry drink would put
heart in a timid man and drink would make fighting men peaceful as
pigeons and drink that would make you forget troubleall in the
brassbound barrels at the end of the room And pleasant fat little
men were roaming around serving the varied liquor in little silver
cups and fine Venetian glasses for the wine and in broadbellied
drinkingpots that would hold more than a quart

And there was such a babel of language as was never heard but in one
place before

Some of the drinkers were dicing and shouting as they won and
grumbling and cursing when they lost And some were singing And some
were dancing to the Irish pipes And there was a knot around the
Indian conjurer

But there was one man by himself at a table And him being so silent
youd think he was shouting for attention He was so restful against
the great commotion youd know he was a great man You might turn
your back on him and youd know he was there though he never even
whispered nor put out a finger A fat pleasant closecoupled man he
was in loose green clothes with gold brocade on them And there
were two big gold earrings in his lobes He smoked a wee pipe with
the bowl halfways up it The pipe was silver and all stem and the
bowl no bigger than a tencent piece His shoulders were very
powerful so youd know he was a man you should be polite to and out
of that chest of his a great shout could come He might have been a
workingman only when he fingered his pipe youd see his hands were
as well kept as a lords ladys fine as silk and polished to a degree
And youd think maybe a pleasant poet which is a scarce thing until
you looked at the brown face of him and big gold earrings And then
youd know what he was he was a great seacaptain

But where did he come from You might know from the high cheek bones
and the eyes that were on a slant as it were that it was an Eastern
man was in it It might be Java and it might be Borneo or it might be
the strange country of Japan

And there were a couple of strange occurrences in the wineshop The
Indian juggler was being baited by the fighting men as people will be
after poking coarse fun at a foreigner The slim Hindu fellow wasnt
taking it at all well He was looking with eyes like gimlets at a big
bullock of a soldier that was leading the tormenters

Show me something would surprise me he was ordering Be damned to
this old womans entertainment says he As a magician says he
youre the worst I ever saw If youre a magician says he Im a
rabbit

And there was a roar at that because he was known to be a very brave
man

Show me a magic trick says he

Says the Hindu

Maybe youd wish you hadnt seen it

Be damned to that says the big fellow

Look at this man well the Hindu told the room Look at him well
He throws a handful of powder in the fire and chants in his foreign
language A cloud of white smoke arises from the fire He makes a
pass before it and lo and behold ye its a screen against the wall
And theres a great commotion of shadows on the screen and suddenly
you see what its all about Its a platform and a man kneeling with
his head on the block You dont see who it is but you get chilled
And suddenly theres a headsman in a red cloak and a red mask and the
ax swings and falls The head pops off and the body falls limp And
the head rolls down the platform and stops and you see its the head
of the fellow who wanted to see something and its in the grisly grin
of death

Theres your latter end for you says the conjurer You wanted to
see something I hope youre content

The big fellow turns white gulps gives a bellow and makes a rush
but the conjurer isnt there nor his screen nor anything

Everybody in the room was white and shakenall but the seacaptain He
just tamps his pipe as if nothing had happened and smokes on He
doesnt even take a drink from his glass

And a little while later an Irish chieftain walks in Hes poor and
ragged and very thin You might know hed been fighting the heathen
for the Holy sepulchre and so entitled to respect no matter what his
condition And behind him are five clansmen as ragged as he But a
big German trooper rolls up

And what are you says the big burly fellow

A gentleman I hope says the ragged chief

Tis yourself that says it laughs the German trooper The chieftain
snicks the knife from his armpit and sticks him in the jugular as neat
as be damned

Youd might take that out Kevin Begthe Irish chief points to the
killed manand throw it in the canal Somebody might stumble over it
and bark their shins

Now this as you can conceive roused a powerful commotion in the room
They were all on their feet captains and mariners and menatarms
cheering or grumbling and arguing the rights and wrongs of the matter
All but the seacaptain who saw it all and he never blinked an
eyelid never even missed a draw of the pipe

And then Marco Polo knew him to be a Chinaman because as all the
world knows Chinamen are never surprised at anything



CHAPTER IV

So Marco Polo goes over and salutes him politely

I wonder if you mind my sitting down by you for a while he says I
perceive youre from China

The seacaptain waves him politely to his place

Im from China He smiles You guessed right

Is it long since youve been in China

Well that depends upon what you call long says the captain If you
mean time its one thing If you mean voyage its another For
youve got to take into account says he adverse winds roundabout
turns to avoid currents possible delays to have the ship scraped free
from the parasite life that does be attaching itself to the strakes
time spent in barter and trade Other matters too the attacks of
pirates crossgrained princes who dont want you to be leaving their
ports with a good cargo in your hold sickness loss of sails and
masts repairs to the ship It wasnt a short journey and it wasnt a
long one

It will be a long ways to China Im thinking

I can tell you how long it is from China to here and you can reverse
that and you will get a fair idea of how long it is from here to
China I left Zeitoon with a cargo of porcelain for Japan and traded
it for golddust and from Japan I went to Chamba to lay in a store of
chessmen and pencases And from Chamba I sailed to Java which is the
greatest island in the world Java is fifteen hundred miles from
Chamba south and southeast and it took me four months sailing but a
seacaptain cannot pass Java by for it is the chief place for black
pepper nutmegs spikenard galingale cubebs doves and all the
spices that grow

And I stopped at various small islands from there until I came to
Basma which is the island of the unicorns And there we trade in
pygmies which ignorant people think are human folk They are just a
wee monkey with all the hair plucked out except the hair of the beard
There is great money in them

I stopped at Sumatra for cocoanuts and toddy and just for water at
Dragoian Dragoian is not a good city It is filled with sorcerers
who have tattooed faces At Lambri I put in for the sago you buy from
the hairy men with tails

Son never stop at the isle of Andaman The men there have faces like
dogs They are a cruel generation and eat every one they can catch
I could tell you a story but I would not spoil this fine spring night
Go rather to the island of Ceylon and see the Kings Ruby which is
the greatest jewel in the world I stopped there and at Coromandel for
the pearls the divers go down in the sea for and there are no clothes
on that island so that every one goes naked as a fish And there is
the shrine of Saint Thomas I was there

Gujarat Tana I stopped there The Male and Female Islands I put
into for ambergris Svestra which is full of magiciansI was there
too Madagascar and Zanzibar where they live on camel flesh I was
there And from Zanzibar I came north to Abyssinia because I had to
get an ostrich there for the King of Siam And there was a letter and
a parcel for the Sultan of Egypt So I went to Cairo I had a month
on my hands so I thought Id run over and see Venice because its a
hobby of mine you might say to see the world

Now let me reckon Four and three makes seven and four more are
eleven and six are seventeen and let us say nine with that and you
have twentysix And the month Im forgetting on the rocks of Aden is
twentyseven and a week here and a week there for bad winds and such
like It would be safe to put that at three months So its two years
and a half since I left China

You never says young Marco met anybody in China by the name of
Polo

Pohlo Pohlo Chinas a bigger place nor you would imagine
laddie Theres half a hundred million people there

These were foreigners Marco explained traders They were at the
court of the great Khan

Polo Polo Well now I think Ive heard of them Was one of them
a big redbearded man with a great eye for a horse and a great eye for
a woman

That would be my Uncle Matthew

For Gods sake And was the other a cold dark man a good judge of a
jewel and a grand judge of a sword

My father Nicholas Polo

For Gods sake Youre the son of one and the nephew of the other

Did you know them

Ah laddie how would I be knowing people like that Sure theyre
great folks high in the esteem of the grand Khan and Im only a poor
sailorman

But you heard of them

I heard of them They were in good health And I heard they were on
their way home though they would travel overland and not risk the
great dangers of the sea I suppose if they go back to China youll
be going with them

I dont know says Marco Polo

You ought to see China Its a great country a beautiful country

It would have to be very great and beautiful says Marco Polo to
outweigh the greatness and the beauty that are here You mustnt
think Im running down your country mister says he but for
greatness where is the beating of Venice in this day What struck
Constantinople like a thunderbolt but the mailed hand of Venice When
the Barbary corsairs roamed the seven seas so that it was no more safe
for a merchant vessel to be sailing than for a babe to be walking
through a wild jungle it was Venice who accepted the challenge and
made the great sea as peaceful as the Grand Canal Who humbled proud
Genoa And hurled the Saracen from Saint John of Acres walls Venice
And as for magnificence the retinue of our doge when he goes to marry
the sea with a ring it makes the court of Lorenzo seem like a
hucksters train

It is a crowning city

And as for beauty sir went on Marco Polo there is nothing in the
world like San Marcos and it ablaze in the setting sun and the great
pillars before it rising in tongues of flame And was there ever in
all time anything like the Grand Canal at the dusk of day and the
torches beginning to show like fireflies and the lap of the water and
stringed music and the great barges going by like swans now a
battlehacked captain of war now a great gracious lady And the moon
does be rising

Youve sailed all the way from China and seen strange and beautiful
things but I remember one summers day when I took out my little
sailingboat and went out on the water to compose a poem for a lady
and the water was blueoh as blue as the skys self and the sands of
the Lido were silver and the water shuffled gently over them as
gently as a childs little feet And there was a clump of olivetrees
there so green as to be black and there alighted before it a great
scarlet Egyptian bird And the beauty of that brought the tears to my
eyes so that I thought of nuns in their cells and barefoot friars in
the hollow lands and they striving for paradise What did I care
about paradise A Venetian I So why should I want to go to China

You have made a great case for the grandeur and beauty of Venice
says the seacaptain It is lovely surely says he filling his
pipe but finer poets nor you my lad says he lighting it have
tried to describe the grace and beauty of TaoTuen and says he
taking a draw have failed

TaoTuen is a beautiful name It is like two notes plucked on a harp
And it must be a wonderful place surely if great poets cannot
describe it

It is not a place said the captain its a girl

As for women Venice

Venice be damned said the seacaptain Not in Venice not in all
the world is there the like for grace or beauty of TaoTuen They call
her Golden Bells he says

Is she a dancinggirl Marco asked

She is not a dancinggirl says the seacaptain she is the daughter
of Kubla the great Khan

A cold and beautiful princess says Marco Polo

She is not a cold and beautiful princess says the seacaptain She
is warm as the sun in early June and she may be beautiful and a
princess but we all think of her as Golden Bells the little girl in
the Chinese garden

Did you ever see her says Marco eagerly Tell me

I saw her before I left says the seacaptain I was at the Khans
palace of Chagannor says he seeing of the chief of the stewards was
there anything I could get for him and I in foreign parts And as I
was being rowed back along the river by my ten brawny sailormen what
did I pass but the garden of Golden Bells

And there she was by the riverside a little brown slip of a girl in
green coat and trousers with a flower in her dark hair

And I lower my head in reverence as we pass by But I hear her low
merry voice by reason of which they call her Golden Bells

Ho master of the vessel she calls Where do you go

And the sailors back water with a swish and I stand up respectfully
for all she is only a slip of a girl

I go to foreign parts Golden Bells I tell her to far and
dangerous places into the Indian Ocean To the Island of Unicorns and
to the land where men eat men

I hope you come back safe master of the vessel she says I hope
you have a good voyage and come back safe It must be a dreadful
strain on your people to think of you so far away

In all this wide land I tell her there is none to worry about me
I have neither chick nor child

Golden Bells will worry about you then she said and you in the
hazards of the sea And take this flower for luck And she gave me
the flower from her hair And let it bring you luck against the anger
of the ocean and the enemies all men have And let me know when you
are back because Ill be worried about a man of China and him in
danger on the open sea

And wasnt that a wonderful thing from a daughter of Kubla to me a
poor sailorman

The son of the King of Siam came to woo her with a hundred princes on
a hundred elephants but she wouldnt have him I dont wish to be a
queen she told her father How could I be a queen I am only
Golden Bells Nor would she have anything to say to the Prince of the
Land of Darkness who came to her with sea ivory and pale Arctic gold
The sun of China is in my heart and you wouldnt have me go up into
the great coldness to shiver and die

So she remains in her garden by the lake of Cranes with Li Po the
great poet him they call the Drinker of Wine to make songs for her
and the SANANG Tung Chih the great magician to perform wonders for
her when she is wearied and Bulagan her nurse to take her to her
heart when she is sad

And sad she is a lot of the time they tell me She sits in her
garden in the dusk playing her lute and singing the song of the
Willow branches which is the saddest lovesong in the world

And why she should be singing a sad lovesong is a mystery for her
soft brown beauty is the flower of the world For there would be no
lack of suitors for her nor is she the one to refuse love The only
thing I make of it is that the right hour hasnt come

The beauty of Venice jumps to your eyes but the beauty of this pulls
at your heart Little brown Golden Bells in her Chinese garden
singing the song of the Willow Branches at the close of day Is that
not better nor Venice

But he got no word out of Marco Polo sitting with his chin cupped in
his hands And that was the finest answer at all at all



CHAPTER V

The times went by and Marco Polo busied himself with his daily
affairs keeping track of the galleasses with merchandise to strange
faraway ports buying presents for refractory governors who didnt
care for foreign trade in their domains getting wisdom from the old
clerks and knowledge from the mariners in the main acting as the son
of a great house while the heads of it were away

You would think that he would have forgotten what the seacaptain of
China told him about Golden Bells what with work and sport and other
women near him You would think that would drop out of his memory like
an old rime But it stuck there as an old rime sometimes sticks and
by dint of thinking he had her fast now in his mindso fast so clear
so full of life that she might be some one he had seen an hour ago or
was going to see an hour from now He would think of the now merry
now sad eyes of her and the soft sweet voice of her by reason of
which they called her Golden Bells and the dusky little face and the
hair like black silk and the splotch of the red flower in it She was
as distinct to him as the five fingers on his hand It wasnt only she
was clear in his minds eye but she was inside of him closer than his
heart She was there when the sun rose so he would be saying Its a
grand day is in it surely Golden Bells She was there in the dim
counting house and he going over in the great intricate ledgers the
clerks do be posting carefully with quills of the gray goose so that
he would be saying I wonder where this is and that is Sure I had my
finger on it only a moment ago Golden Bells And when the dusk was
falling and the bats came out and the quiet of Christ was over
everything and the swallows flew low on the great canals she would be
beside him and never a word would he say to her so near to him would
she be

And she wrought strangeness between him and the women he knew the
great grave lady with the large pale mouth her that was of his mind
and the little black cloakmaker with the eager red mouth her that
was closer than mind or heart to him So that the first found fault
with his poetry

I dont know whats come over you Marco Poloand there was a touch
of temper in her voicebut these poems of yours show me you havent
your mind on your subject Would you mind telling me when I had bound
black hair she says And you say my bosom is like two little russet
apples Now a regular poet once compared it to two great silver cups
and that was a good comparison though in truth she says he knew as
little about it as you And my hands are not like soft Eastern
flowers Theyre like lilies I dont know where you do be getting
these Eastern comparisons she says But I dont like them Tell me
pretty boyshe looks suspiciousyou havent been taking any of
the strange Egyptian drugs the dark people do be selling in the dim
shops on the quiet canals Look out pretty boy Look out

And the little cloakmaker grumbled when he was gone I dont know
whats wrong with him says she Or maybe its something thats
wrong with myself but this delicate love isnt all its cracked up to
be Its all right in books she says and its a grand sight and
the players doing it but I like a hug she says would put the
breath out of you and a kiss she says you could feel in the soles
of your feet And she lay awake and grumbled Let him be taking his
ladida courting to those as favor it says she Its not my kind
and she grumbled through the lonely night I wonder where my husband
is now she said And wasnt I the foolish girl to be sending him
off Sure he drank like a fish and beat me something cruel but he
was a rare lover and the mood on him Sure a woman never knows when
shes well off says she

And Marco Polo didnt miss them any more nor youd miss an old overcoat
and the winter past All his mind was on was the Golden Bells of
China And he thought long until his uncle and father came so that he
could be off with them to the strange Chinese land

But theres no use to me going there says he I couldnt marry
her She would laugh at me he says She who refused the son of
the King of Siam with his hundred princes on a hundred elephants what
use would she have for me whos no better nor a peddler with his pack
But it would be worth walking the world barefoot for to see that little
golden face to hear the low sweet voice they call Golden Bells

They came back in due time his uncle Matthew the red hairy man and
his father the thin dark man who knew precious stones And he told
them he wanted to go with them when they made their next expedition to
China

We could be using you after your training in trade says the father
But Marco Polo would take no interest in barter Sure youd better
come along says his uncle Matthew Theres great sport to be had on
the road kissing and courting the foreign women and not a word of
language between you barring a smile and a laugh

I have no interest in the foreign women Uncle Matthew

Then its the horses youve been hearing about the fine Arab horses
faster nor the wind and the little Persian ponies they do be playing
polo on and the grand Tatar hunters that can jump the heighth of a
man and they surefooted as a goat Ah the horses the bonny horses

Ah sure Uncle Matthew tis little I know of horses Sure I know
all about boats racing and trade and war boats but a horse is not kin
to me

Then what the hells the use of your going to China

Ah sure thats the question Im asking myself Uncle Matthew But I
have to go I do so There is something calling me Uncle Matthewa
bell in my ear fathers brother and theres a ringing bell in my
heart



CHAPTER VI

I shall now tell you how it came about that Marco Polo went to China
with his uncle and father though he had no eye for a bargain or
interest in courting foreign women or sense of horses

Now as you may know this was a great religious time The Crusaders
feeling shame that the Sepulchre of the Lord Jesus should be in Saracen
hands had come with horse foot and artillery to Palestine to give
tribute of arms to Him who had died for them on the Bitter Tree And
great feats were performed and grand battles won And kings became
saints like Louis of France and saints became kings like Baldwin of
Constantinople Mighty wonders were seen and miracles performed so
that people said Now will be the second coming of Christ and the end
of the world

And a great desire came on the Christian people to tell the truth of
Christ to the strange and foreign peoples of the world So that every
day out of Jerusalem you would see friars hitting the road some of
them to confront the wizards of the Land of Darkness and some to argue
theology with the old lamas of Tibet and some to convert the sunny
Southern islands where the young women do be letting down their hair
and the men do be forgetting God for them And all over the world there
was spreading a great rumor that the truth of all things was at last
known

Even Kubla Khan had heard of it far off in China and he had charged
the uncle and father of Marco with a message to the Pope of Rome Let
the pope be sending some theologians to his court and theyd argue the
matter out and if he was satisfied that this new religion was the True
Religion then hed turn Christian and tell his people to turn
Christian too And let them be bringing back some of the Oil of the
Lamp which burns in the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem and is a cure for
all the ills in the world

And when they came to the City of Acre sure the pope was dead And
they waited a long time but no new pope was chosen so they decided to
go back because they had a good business there and they didnt want
to lose it And yet they knew thered be trouble with the Grand Khan
if they didnt bring back the news of the True Religion and people to
argue it

Ive been a long time trading says Nicolo and its a queer thing
but the more trading you do the less religion you have The arguing
of religion would not come easy to me And Id be up against experts
Im not the man for it says he How about you Matthew

Oh sure theyd never listen to me Matthew laughsme thats drank
with them and deludhered their women and gambled until I left them
nothing but the sweat of their brows Id be a great one to preach
religion to them Why man theyd laugh at me But I tell you what
Nicolas Theres a bishop in Negropont and I know where he lives and
I know his house and everything What do you say Nicolas Well just
throw a bag over his head and tie him on a horse Oh sure hed give
grand discourses to the Great Khan

Have sense Matthew have sense Youre always too rough always
ready to end an argument with a knife or just lift what you want Have
sense man you cant kidnap a bishop like youd kidnap a woman

Well I dont see why not says Matthew It would be easier too
because a woman will scratch like a wildcat But if youre set against
it I wont do it he says Well then how about young Marco

My sound man Matthew My bully fellow Sure you were never at a loss
yet Young Marco it is sure tis the elegant idea Theres not a
man born of woman better for the job

Now all the Christian world had gone religious and young Marco was no
exception fort is not only the old that are religious The young are
too but theres a difference The religion of old men is reason and
translation the religion of the young is just a burning cloud The
Tragedy of the Bitter Tree is not a symbol to them but a reality and
their tears are not of the spirit but of the body too

And there are no halfway houses no compromises in a young mans
creed Its swallow all or be damned to you Its believe or be lost

And thinking over the little girl in the Chinese garden there had come
into Marcos heart a thought past enduring If little Golden Bells
did not believe then little Golden Bells was lost She might have
everything in this world in this life an emperor for a father kings
for suitors a great poet for a minstrel a wizard for an entertainer
but once the little blue shadow left her body she was lost forever
And the sight came to him of little Golden Bells going down the dim and
lonely alleys of death and weeping weeping weeping Her eyes
would be shot with panic and the little mouth twisted and the little
flowery hands twitching at each other And it would be cold there for
her who was so warm and it would be dark there for her who loved
light and the Golden Bells of her voice would be lost in the whistling
and clanging of the stars as they swung by in their orbits He to be
in the great delight of paradise and she to be in the bluegray maze
between the worldswhat tragedy

Kings might bring her presents a husband might bring her happiness
but if he could only bring her salvation If he could only tell her of
the Bitter Tree

The body when you came to think of it mattered little All the
beauty in the world could not endure more than its appointed span
Helen was dust now and Deirdre nothing What had become of the beauty
of Semiramis Alexanders darling and Cleopatra who loved the great
proconsul and Bathsheba for whom David of the Psalms fell from grace
And Balkis queen of Sheba with her apes ivory and peacocks Dust
and ashes dust and ashes And Scheherazade was but a strange sad
sound Beauty increased and waned like the moon A little shadow
around the eyes a little crinkle in the neck the backs of the hands
stiffening like parchment Dust and ashes dust and ashes

But the little blue shadow would glow like an Easter morning

Or it would be a poor lonely unlit shadow in the cold gloom of the
clanging worlds

Poor Golden Bells Poor little weeping Golden Bells If he could only
tell her about the Bitter Tree

And then what happens but his uncle Matthew claps him on the back

How would you like to go to China Marco Markeen says he and
preach religion to the benighted people

How did you know Uncle Matthew

How did I know what

That I wanted to go to China and preach religion to thethe people

Well if that doesnt beat Banagher says Matthew Polo and Banagher
beats the devil Tell me did you ever hear an old tune called Bundle
and Go

And so the three of them leave upon their journey but at Layas where
the King of Armenia had his castle they heard of the election of a new
pope so they came back to Acre to get his instructions and blessing



CHAPTER VII

The pope said a grand mass for them and at the gospel he enters the
pulpit a burly figure of a man with sad eyes

The blessing of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost be with you
and about you Amen

It is not to you Nicolo Polo that I wish to speak nor to you
Matthew Polo for neither of you are my ambassadors to the Great Khan
Merchant and sportsmen I honor you and you have my blessing but you
have no hopes of mine The dirty diversions of the world are between
your eyes and glory said he Its only myself an old and sorrowful
man and this child a young and hopeful one can understand old men
having sight of visions and young men dreaming dreams

Now in the matter of converting the Great Khan and his numerous
millions first let wisdom speak I have little hopes He wants to be
argued into it you see Religion is not a matter of argument It is a
wisdom that surpasses wisdom It drifts in mens souls as the foggy
dew comes unbidden to the trees It is born before our soul as the
horned moon is born before our eyes

And now my child you might say What is the use of sending me to
China if he knows I cannot bring these millions into the fold My dear
son there is the wisdom surpassing wisdom A great and noble thought
must not die Things of the spirit we cannot reckon as a husbandman
reckons his crops There is a folk on the marches of Europe and they
are ever going into battle and they always fall Their results are
nothing But their name and their glory will endure forever

My dear son God has put wisdom in my head and beauty into yours
Wisdom is needed for the governance of this world but beauty is needed
for its existence In arid deserts there is no life Birds do not
sing in the dark of night Show me a waste country and Ill show you
a brutal people No faith can live that is not beautiful

The beauty God has put in your heart child you must always keep
How much I think of it Ill tell you Im an old man now an old and
broken man and in a few years Ill stand before my Master

What have you seen on my earth Hell ask me you who followed St
Peter

Lord Lord Ill tell Him Ive seen mighty things Ive seen the
bridegroom leave his bride and the king his kingdom the huckster leave
his booth and the reaper drop his hook that they might rescue Your
Holy Sepulchre from pagan hands

And anything else Hell ask

And Ive seen a young man go out into the desert and over his head
was a star

You may think you have failed child but remember that in the coming
times your name and fame will awaken beauty and manys the traveler on
the hard road will find his courage again and he thinking of Marco
Polo And manys the young man will dream dreams and manys the old
man will see visions and they reading the book by the golden
candlelight and manys the young girl will give you love and you
dead for centuries But for this you must keep your dream

Now youll think its the queer pope I am to be telling you things
like this instead of demanding converts But the wisdom that surpasses
wisdom comes to you with the Annointing of the Oil I knew a man in
Christ above fourteen years ago writes Saint Paul whether in the
body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God
knoweth

How that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words
which is not lawful for a man to utter

Now you see there is a wisdom surpassing wisdom and it is out of this
fount of wisdom I am drawing when I speak to you these words

Child I will not keep you any longer Only to say this and this is
the chiefest thing never let your dream be taken from you Keep it
unspotted from the world In darkness and in tribulation it will go
with you as a friend but in wealth and power hold fast to it for then
is danger Let not the mists of the world the gay diversions the
little trifles draw you from glory

Remember

Si oblitus fuero tui JerusalemIf I forget thee O Jerusalem

Oblivioni detur dextera mealet my right hand forget her cunning

Adhaereat lingua mea faucibus meis si non meminero tuiif I do not
remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth

Si non proposuero Jerusalem in principis laetitiae meaeIf I prefer
not Jerusalem above my chief joy

I shall now send a prayer to Heaven he said to keep you safe in
the strange foreign ways to protect you against wind and tempest
against pestilence and sudden death against the powers of darkness
and Him who goes up and down the world for the ruin of souls

And he turned to the high altar again and now youd hear his voice
loud and powerful and now low and secret and the bell struck and the
acolyte intoned the responses and all of a sudden he turned and spread
forth his hands

Ite Let you go now Missa est



CHAPTER VIII

And so they set forth with their great train of red snarling camels
and little patient donkeys and slender nervous horses toward the
rising sun Behind them the green hills of Palestine died out as a
rainbow dies out and now there was sand before them and now bleak
mountains and by day the wind was swift and hot and by night it was
black and cold And moons were born and died

And they passed through the land of the King of Armenia and they
passed Ararat the mountain where Noah brought his ark to anchor and
where it still is and where it can be seen still but cannot be
reached so cold and high and terrible is that mountain

And they passed ruined Babel that was built of Nimrod the first king
of the world and now is desolation They passed it on a waning moon
And out of the ruins the dragons came and hissed at them and strange
obscene birds flapped their wings in the air and cawed and pecked at
them and over the desert the satyr called unto her mate

And they passed through the Kingdom of Georgia whose kings are born
with the mark of an eagle on their right shoulder They passed through
Persia where the magicians worship fire And they passed through the
city of Saba where sleep the three magi who came to worship at
Bethlehem and their names were Kaspar Balthlasar and Melchior

And they passed through Camadi where great ruins are and robbers roam
through the magical darkness And they passed northward of the
Perilous Valley where the Devils Head is in black stone and that is
one of the nine entrances to hell and passed the Valley of the
Cockadrills where there are serpents five fathoms in length and
passed the Valley of Cruel Women who have precious stones in place of
eyes

And they went through the Dismal Desert where no stream sang

And in the desert they passed the Trees of the Sun and Moon which
speak with the voices of men And it was from the Speaking Tree that
Alexander heard of his death And it was near there that he and Darius
fought And they passed the Arbre Sec the Dry Tree which has a green
bark on one side and white on the other and there are no trees within
a hundred miles of that tree and it is sprung from the staff of Adam

And they passed through Balkh the Mother of Cities And they passed
through Tailian where the great salt mountains are And they passed
through Badashan where the mountains of the rubies are And they
passed through Kashmir whose women are very beautiful and whose
magicians weave the strongest spells in the world

And moons were born and died

And they came to Alamoot the fortess of Senex de Monte the Old Man of
the Mountain the King of the Assassins the greatest wizard of all
time

Now this is the tale of the Old Man the Mountain

Whenever within his dominions there was a fine young horseman the Old
Man would put a spell on him and draw him to the Castle of Alamoot and
outside of the castle sleep would come on him And when he woke up he
would be inside the castle in the wonderful gardens And theyd tell
him he was dead and in paradise And paradise it would be for him what
with the lovely women and the great playing on the flutes the birds
singing and the sun shining the crystal rivers and the flowers of the
world And after a while the Old Man of the Mountain would call for
him and tell him he was sending him back on earth again on a mission
to punish SuchandSuch And the Old Man would put sleep on him and a
knife in his hand and when he woke he would be outside the Castle of
Alamoot And he would start on his mission And when he came back he
would be readmitted to paradise And if he didnt come back there
were others to take his place

The Old Man of the Mountain always kept one hundred and one assassins
and four hundred and four women to tend them

Now when the caravan of the Polos had come to rest for the day the Old
Man of the Mountain put out white not black magic and he drew Marco
Polo to the castle as a magnet draws a needle And Marco Polo galloped
up to the Castle in the waning moon and the Old Man looked down on him
from the battlements and stroked his long white beard

Do you know me Marco Polo

I know you and I have no fear of you Old Man of the Mountain

And why have you no fear of me Marco Polo

Because the cross of the Lord Jesus is between me and harm Because it
protects me night and day

I know Eesa benMiriam said the Old Man He was a great prophet
But whether he would have protected you from me we will differ about
that Ive often thought of you Marco Polo and you coming this way
I could have used you in my work of keeping the kings and chieftains of
the world in fear and subjection

Then why am nt I in your garden Old Man of the Mountain

The four most beautiful women in the world are in my garden There is
a tall blackhaired woman and she is fairer and more adroit than
Lilith who was before Eve and there is a tall blond woman and she
is like a queen and there is a slim coppercolored woman and she is
like an idol in a shrine and there is a little brownhaired woman and
she is like a child But none of those women could make you believe
you were in paradise while theres a face in your heart Not the cross
of the Lord Jesus is between you and me but the face of little Golden
Bells of China

But I am not going to China to woo Golden Bells Old Man of the
Mountain I am going to convert the men of Cathay

The Old Man of the Mountain laughed and stroked his beard

You had a sermon from Gregory before you came away Did he tell you
you were to convert the men of Cathay

He did not

Ali Gregorys a sound man He knew you cant make saints in a day
Why child Ive seen the beginning of the world and Ive seen the end
of it Ive seen the beginning in a crystal glass and Ive seen the
end in a pool of ink in a slaves hand Ive seen mankind begin lower
nor the gibbering ape and Ive seen them end the shining sons of God
Millions on millions on millions of years multiplied unto dizziness
crawling infinitesimal work overcoming nature overcoming themselves
overcoming the princes of the powers of darkness one of whom I am
But this is too deep for you Marco Polo

Now you can go on your way without hindrance from me Marco Polo
because of the memory of an old time when the courting of a woman was
more to me than the killing of a man when beauty meant more nor power

Let you be on your way Marco Polo while I sit here a lonely old man
with wee soft ghosts whispering to him Let you be hastening on your
way before I remember I am a prince of the powers of darkness and
should do you harm



CHAPTER IX

And so they went on eastward ever eastward and the moons were born
grew waned and died

They passed through Khotan where the divers bring up jade from the
rivers white jade and black jade and green jade veined with gold
They passed through Carnal the shameful city whose women are fair and
wanton whose men are cuckolds And they passed through the province
of Chitingolos where are the mountains of the Salamanders They passed
through the city of Campicha where there are more idols than men And
they passed through the great city of Samarkand where the Green Stone
is on which Timurs throne was set And were born and died

They passed through Tangut where the men will not carry the dead out
through the door of a house but must break a hole in the wall And
they passed through Kialehta where there are snowwhite camels And
they passed through the lands of Prester John

And now they were in the Tatar lands There passed them lowing musk
oxen There passed them the wild asses of Mongolia There passed them
the barbarians with their great tents on wheels There passed them
the blackjowled savage idolaters There passed them the pretty
whitefaced women There passed them huge abominable dogs

And they came to the town of Lob and a new moon arose and they
entered the Desert of the Singing Sands



CHAPTER X

Wherever they went now was sand and a dull haze that made the sun look
like a copper coin And a great silence fell on the caravan and
nothing was heard but the crunch of the camels pads and the tinkle of
the camels bells And no green thing was seen

And a great terror fell on the caravan so that one night a third of
the caravan deserted The rest went on in silence under the dull sun
And now they came across a village of white skeletons grinning in the
silent sand And at night there was nothing heard not even the
barking of a dog And others of the caravan deserted and others were
lost

And now they had come so far into the desert that they could not
return but must keep on their way and on the fifth day they came to
the Hill of the Drum And all through the night they could not sleep
for the booming of the Drum And some of the caravan went mad there
and fled screaming into the waste

And now there was only a great haze about them and they looked at one
another with terror saying Were we ever any place where green was
where birds sang or there was sweet water Or maybe we are dead Or
maybe this was all our life and the pleasant towns and the lamplight
in the villages and the apricots in the garden and our wives and
children maybe they were all a dream that we woke in the middle of
Let us lie down and sleep that we may dream again

But Marco Polo would not let them lie down for to lie down was death
But he drove them onward And again they complained Surely God never
saw this place that He left it so terrible Surely He was never here
He was never here

And now that their minds were pitched to the height of madness the
warlocks of the desert took shape and jeered at them and the
whitesheeted ghosts flitted alongside of them and the goblins of the
Gobi harried them from behind And the sun was like dull copper
through the haze and the moon like a guttering candle and stars there
were none

And when the moon was at its full they came to the Hill of the Bell
And through the night the Bell went GONGH GONGH GONGH until they
could feel it in every fiber of their bodies and their skin itched
with it They would stop their ears But they would hear it in the
palms of their hands and the soles of their feet GONGH GONGH GONGH

And when they left the Hill of the Bell there were only six of the
caravan left and a multitude of whitesheeted ghosts And the caravan
plodded onward dully And now the warlocks of the desert played
another cruelty Afar off they would put a seeming of a lake and the
travelers would press on gladly crying There is water Water God
lives God lives But there was only sand And now it would be a
green vision and they would cry We have come to the edge of the
desert After the long night dawn God lives God lives But there
would be only sand sand And now it would be a city of shining domes
in the distance And they would nudge one another and croak There
are men there brother secure streets and merchants in their booths
people to talk with and water for our poor throats But there would
be only sand sand sand And they would cry like children God is
dead Havent you heard Dont you know God is dead in His heaven
and the warlocks are loosed on the land

And on the last day of the moon they were all but in sight of the
deserts edge though they didnt know And the goblins and the
warlocks took counsel for they were now afraid Marco and his few
people would escape They gathered together and they read the runes of
the Flowing Sand

And suddenly the camels rushed screaming into the desert with sudden
panic and a burning wind came and the sands rose and the desert
heeled like a ship and the day became night

And young Marco Polo could stand no more That was the end the end of
him the end of the world the end of everything There was red
darkness every where and he could see nobody O my Lord Jesus he
cried O little Golden Bells The wind boomed like an organ The
sand screamed O my Lord Jesus O little Golden Bells And the
voices of his father and uncle were like the tweeting birds Wheres
the lad Matthew Wheres our lad Mark Mark where have you got
to Lad of our heart where are you But they couldnt find each
other The sand buffeted them like shuttlecocks Boy Mark The sand
snarled like a dog the wind hammered like drums Oh Golden Bells
O little Golden Bells O my Lord Jesus must it end here

And the fight went out of him and a big sob broke in him and he lay
down to die



CHAPTER XI

I shall now tell you of Golden Bells and her in the Chinese Garden



CHAPTER XII

I would have you now see her as I see her standing before Li Po the
great poet in her green costume And Li Po big fat with sad eyes
and a twisted mouth uncomfortable as be damned The sun shone in the
garden the butterflies the red and black and golden butterflies
flitted from blossom to blossom And the bees droned And on the banks
of the green lake the kingfisher tunneled his wee house and the wind
shook the blossoms of the appletrees And Li Po sat on the marble
slab and was very uncomfortable And in a dark bower was Sanany the
magician brooding like an owl And Golden Bells stood before Li Po
and there were hurt tears in her eyes

Did my father or I ever do anything to you Li Po that you should
make a song such as they sing in the marketplace

What song

The Song of the Cockatoo

I dont remember

Ill remind you Li Po There alighted on the balcony of the King of
Annam the song goes a red cockatoo It was colored as a
peachtreeblossom and it spoke the tongue of men And the King of
Annam did to it what is always done to the learned and eloquent He
took a cage with stout bars and shut up inside And wasnt that the
cruel thing to write And are you so imprisoned here Li Po Ah Li
Po Im thinking hard of you Im thinking hard

Well now Golden Bells to tell you the truth there was no excuse for
it But often times I do be feeling sad and thinking of the friends
of my youth who are gone Yuan Chen who might have been a better poet
nor me if he had been spared and Hsiengyang and Li Chien too Ah
they were great poets Golden Bells They never sang a poor song
Golden Bells that they might wear a fine coat And theyd write what
was true wee mistress were all the world to turn from them And Im
the laureate now the court singer living in my glory and theyre
dead with their dreams Im the last of the seven minstrels And wee
Golden Bells I do be thinking long

And sometimes an old woman in the street or a man with gray in his
hair will lift a song and before the words come to me theres a pain
in my heart

And I go down to the drinking booths and the passion of drinking
comes on mea fury against myself and a fury against the world And
the folk do be following me to see will I let drop one gem of verse
that they can tell their grandchildren they heard from the lips of Li
Po And when my heart is high with the drinking I take a lute from a
traveling poet and not knowing what Im saying I compose the song
Out of fallow sorrow bloom the little songs You mustnt be hard on an
old man wee Golden Bells and he thinking long for his dead friends

Ah poor Li Po she said and she had grown all soft again Is it so
terrible to be old

Now you ask me a question Golden Bells and Ill give you an answer
Besides its part of my duties to teach you wisdom Now it is not a
terrible thing at all at all to be old I see the young folk start
out in life and before them theres the showers of April theres
wind and heat and thunder and lightning But Im in warm brown
October and all of its gone by me And in a little while Ill sleep
and tis I need it God help me The old dont sleep much wee Golden
Bells so tis a comfort to look forward to ones rest after the
hardness of the world In a hundred or more years or five hundred
just as the fancy takes me Ill wake up for a while and wander down
the world to hear the people sing my songs and then Ill go back to my
sleep

And she was going to ask him another question when the Sanang came up
The magician was a thick man with merry eyes and a cruel mouth

Golden Bells he says theres rare entertainment in the crystal
glass

What is it Sanang

The warlocks of the Gobi have a young lad down and theyre waiting
until the soul comes out of his body Come Ill show you

And in the crystal glass he showed her Marco Polo and the knees going
from under him in the roaring sands She gave a quick cry of pity

Oh the poor lad

Sanang chuckled He started out with a big caravan to preach what he
thought was a truth to China Ive been watching him all along and
its been rare sport I knew it would come to this

Couldnt you save him Sanang she cried O Sanang hes so young
and he set out to come to us Couldnt you save him

Well I might Sanang was not pleased Itll be a while before the
shadow comes out of him But it would be rare sport to watch and see
the warlocks and the ghouls and the goblins set on it the way terriers
do be setting on an otter

Oh save him Sanang Save him

Now Golden Bells I might be able to save him and again I mightnt

Save him Sanang Li Po broke in Save him the way the wee one
wants For if you dont Sanang Ill write a song about you thatll
be remembered for generations and theyll point out your grandchildren
and your grandchildrens grandchildren and theyll laugh and sing Li
Pos song

There was a fat worm who considered himself a serpent

Oh now Li Po for Gods sake let you not be composing poems on me
for tis you have the bitter tongue Promise me now and Ill save
him Well send for the keeper of the khans drums

And they sent for the keeper and Sanang gave a message to be put on
the Speaking Drums

Let you now he told his helper get me the Distant Ears

And the helper brought him the Golden Ears which were the like of a
great birds wings and he put them on his head and he listened

I hear the drums of the battlements he said and I hear the
Drums of the Hill of Graves

And he listened a while and Golden Bells was white

I hear the Drums of the Dim Mountainand for a while he said
nothing

Those would be the drums of Yung Chang

I hear the Drums of Kai Yu Kwan he said

Yes Sanang yes Little Golden Bells was one quiver of fear

I hear the Drums of the Convent of the Red Monks said Sanang I
hear drums calling the Tatar tribes I hear the slap of saddles I
hear the jingle of bits I hear galloping ponies

Yes Sanang Oh hurry Sanang hurry

He listened a little while longer and then he took off the Distant
Ears

Your mans saved he said

Then little Golden Bells laughed and then she cried She caught Li
Pos hand and laughed again and again she cried Sanang shook his head
to get out of his ears the deafening noises of the world And Li Po
smiled out of his sad eyes

I think Ill go and write a marriagesong Golden Bells

Whom will you write the marriagesong for Li Po

Ill write it for you Golden Bells

But Im not going to be married Li Po There is no one I love no
one Li Po I do not I do not indeed

Then take your lute and sing me the Song of the Willow Branches
which is the saddest song in the world

She shook her head and blushed I cannot sing that song Li Po I
dont feel like singing that song

Then I must write you another song Little Golden Bells



CHAPTER XIII

And now when Marco Polo was rested and had recovered they brought him
from the Convent of the Red Monks to where the khan was in the city of
Chandu Now there were two palaces in Chandu there was the winter
palace which was of marble and the summer palace which was of gilt
cane Around these palaces there was built a wall sixteen miles in
compass and inside of it was a park of fountains and rivers and
brooks with the speckled trout in them and meadows with the lark at
her ease in the grass and trees of all varieties where the little
birds do be building and none to grudge them a home And all the wild
animals were abundant the timid hare and the wild deer and the wee
croaking frogs longlegged colts by their white mothers and little
dogs tumbling over themselves with the sport of spring Brown bees
among the clover strawberries in profusion trees would delight your
eyes and brown cows and black cows and dappled moilies under the
great leaves of them and lambs would be snowy of fleece All the
flowers of the world were there the paradise of wild things it was
the park of Kubla Khan

 In Xanadu did Kubla Khan quoted young Randall
 A stately pleasure dome decree
 Where Alph the sacred river ran
 Through caverns measureless to man
 Down to a sunless sea
 So twice five miles of fertile ground
 With walls and towers were girdled round
 And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
 Where blossomed many an incensebearing tree
 And here were forests ancient as the hills
 Enfolding sunny spots of greenery

Whose poem is that poem Brian Oge

It is a poem of Coleridges Malachi

I though it was maybe a poem of Colquitto Dall McCracken of Skye that
one of you lads had put English on It is a poem of the head you ken
and Colquitto being a dark man could only see with the eyes ghost
But it hasnt the warmth the life of the work of Blind Colquitto
Brian Oge do you mind the poem Angus More Campbell of Rathlin wrote to
Colquitto Dall

Is aoibhinn duid Colquitto Dall I remembered It is happy for
thee blind Colquitto who dost not see much of women If thou wert to
see what we see thou wouldst be tormented even as I am My sorrow O
God that I was not stricken blind before I saw her amber twisted
hair

Thats it thats it Brian Oge But this is not the place to be
talking of poetry There is no poetry in this story

I will now tell you of Marco Polo and him entering the presence of the
great khan



CHAPTER XIV

And Marco Polo was brought into the presence And among all assembled
there you could hear a pin drop

At the north end of the great hall sat the Khan himself and Marco Polo
nearly dropped with surprise for where he expected a great
magnificent figure of a man with majesty shining from his eyes he saw
only a pleasant bearded man not quarter so well dressed as the
meanest servant on the room and a fine welcoming smile in his face
His throne was elevated so that his feet were on the level of the heads
of the kinsmen of the Blood Royal beneath him and they in silk and
ermine and fine brocades and jewels And beneath these were the barons
and dukes and knights And beneath these were the captains of the
fighting men three thousand and three And beneath these were the
musicians and the sorcerers And behind Kubla Khan very big very
erect stood his three great servants the Keeper of the Hunting
Leopards the Keeper of the Speaking Drums and the Keeper of the
Khans Swords

And beside Kubla Khan on a little throne sat Golden Bells And it
was the sight of her more than the sight of the great assembly that
dumbed the words in his mouth And Kubla was smiling at him and she
was smiling too

And Kubla saw there was something wrong with him that there was
embarrassment on him and he rose from his throne

There is welcome for you here Marco Polo and no enmity There is
interest in and eagerness for your message There is none here will
criticize you or make it hard for you Let there be no shame on you in
speaking before so many people Say what you have to say as if there
were nobody here if that will help you barring myself and the little
daughter beside me

O Emperor the words came back to Marco Polo and ye great princes
dukes and marquises counts knights and burgesses and people of all
degrees who desire the light of the world grace be to you and peace
from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ

The message I have to give you I shall give in the words of Him
Whose perfect message it is

Beati pauperes spirituBlessed are the poor in spirit

Quoniam ipsorum est regnum caelorumfor theirs is the kingdom of
heaven

Beati mitesBlessed are the meek

And Marco Polo went on and quoted for them the words that were spoken
on the Mount in Galilee And they listened to him with great civility
and attention And little Golden Bells leaned forward with her chin
on her hands and Kubla leaned back in his throne with his eyes half
closed

But I say unto you that ye resist not evil but whoever shall smite
thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also And at this the
great Khan looked up puzzled and a movement went through the fighting
men in the hall But wee Golden Bells never budged a minute and Marco
Polo went on

Et factum est cum consummasset Jesus verba haecAnd it came to
pass when Jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at
his doctrine

I shall now tell you of the life and death of the Lord Jesus

He told them of the birth in Bethlehem and of the teaching on the
hills and the poets nodded their heads and he told them of the
cleansing of the lepers and of the casting out of devils and the
raising of Lazarus from the dead and the magicians wondered and he
told them of the betrayal by Judas with a kiss and the
captainsatarms shuffled in their seats and he told them of the
scourging and of the crowning with thorns and the great Khan snicked
his dagger in and out of the sheath And a mist of tears came into the
eyes of Golden Bells

And he told them of the crucifixion between two thieves and a great
oath ripped from the beard of Kubla Khan and the silver tears ran from
the eyes of Golden Bells

And on the third day He arose from the dead

And a great shout came from the throat of Kubla Khan and he stood up

He arose from among the dead men Ill warrant He showed himself to
the Roman Pilate in all His power and majesty

No said Marco Palo

Then He showed himself to the thousands who had seen him die upon the
gallows tree

No said Marco Polo

Who saw Him then

His twelve Apostles and they in a little room

And Kubla Khan sat down suddenly and said no more There was a
moments murmur of wonder among the assembly and then silence And
Marcos heart fell And he was aware of two things of the great
politeness of the Chinese people and of Golden Bells pitying eyes



CHAPTER XV

When Kubla Khan dismissed the assembly and he took Marco Polo into a
sittingroom and Golden Bells came with them

And what did you think sir of what I said And can you not see
sir the truth thats in me

Well now laddie said the great Khan when we come to examine this
sermon you quoted to us what is there in it but the rule of the
righteous man Weve had a great thinker and pious man of our own
Confucius Im not a reading man says he but Ive got an idea
says he that there isnt a thing you said but is embraced in the
Analects And if it isnt itll be in the teachings of the Lord
Buddha

Ah but sir Marco Polo said Youll have to admit that He of Whom
I speak was the true God made man

Now laddie remember Im an old man set in my head and my ways and
Ive been used to one belief so long it would be hard changing So
dont press me now dont press me I ask you

Ah sir pleaded Marco Polo its terrible to think of as great a
prince as you to be in the black spaces outside of heaven because you
wouldnt accept the truth

Well maybe they wont be so hard on one my dear lad When my time
comes and I rap on the gate of your heaven maybe theyll say Its
only old Kubla the soldier is in it He knows devil and all about
religion but his fights were fair fights and he never hit a man when
he was down He had a soft heart for wee children and he was easy on
horses Sure whats the difference Let him in And if they say
no Ill tuck the old nicked claymore under my arm and be off to where
the other old fighters are

I see sir that there was little success to my message

I wouldnt say that said Kubla Khan Wait a little until you
perform miracles before the people to prove your truth Youll know
better then

Ah sir said Marco Polo I can perform no miracles Tis only a
saint can perform miracles and I couldnt lace a saints shoes I have
no miracles

Oh well now my dear boy said Kubla Khan I hate to tell you but
theres no use going further Sure youd be up against the sorcerers
of the world Theyd ask you for a sign and youd have no sign and
theyd have signs in abundance I wouldnt think of letting you go
against them Fair plays a jewel and you wouldnt have a chance
Theres the Red Pope from Tibet and theres the Black Magician from
Korea and a hundred minor ones and the Warlock of the North from the
Islands of Ice who governs the hail and the snow Child I wouldnt
let you get into the same ring with them Theyd ruin you

But sir wasnt it a great miracle of the Lords my rescue in the
Gobi Desert

A miracle of the Lords A miracle of Golden Bells here It was her
magician saw you and she had the message put on the drums and the
desert patrols went to seek you It was herself here wee Golden
Bells And Golden Bells mouth gave a smile of shame that his thought
should be broken in his mind

A long way Im after coming said Marco Polo and when I set out my
heart was high

Now dont be taking it too hard says the khan kindly Sure
theres a power of good you can be doing here Maybe you can do
something with Li Po says he Id like fine for you to try The man
is worrying the life out of me with his drinking I never know when he
goes out whether hell come back all right or feet foremost on a door
For hes got the bitter tongue when the drinks in him and China could
ill afford to lose him And there are some of my captains and the
tune theyre always piping is War War War And lets show up this
Alexander who said he conquered the world And Im past the age when
you make war for devilment So let you be helping me out with them
Marco Polo

But Marco Polo knew this was only meant in kindness and his heart was
broken

Ah wee ladyhe turned to Golden Bellswee lady wee lady why
didnt you let me die in the desert Why didnt I die

And why should you die Marco Polo Her low sweet voice rang in the
heart of him Didnt you come here to give your message And to make
converts And didnt I hear your message And am nt I your convert
Marco Polo



CHAPTER XVI

And now the place of Li Po was usurped and gone Sanang with his magic
glass and in the jasmine garden by the Lake of Cranes Marco Polo sat
and instructed Golden Bells



CHAPTER XVII

And he told of the flight into Egypt when savage Herod reigned and of
the Jewish maid and her child sleeping beneath the shadow of the great
Sphinx while the shades of the old Afric gods looked on in reverence
Amenalk and Thoth and the moonhorned Io Isis and Osiris And the
painted kings knelt in their pyramids and out of the sluggish Nile
came the strange aquatic population the torpid crocodiles and
monstrous water lizards and the great hippopotami lumbered to bow
before the little Lord of all things

And he told her how Satan had tempted Him on the lonely black craigs

But you are not listening little Golden Bells

Indeed I am listening Marco Polo Yes indeed I am I love to hear
your voice Marco Polo You are so earnest Marco Polo there is such
a light in your eyes Listen Marco Polo Li Po once wrote a poem
White Gleam the Gulls and it is the poem by which he is best known
and every time I hear it there is an echo in my heart But Marco Polo
I never listened to Li Pos song so eagerly as I am listening to your
voice

But you are not taking it in little Golden Bells

It is very hard to take in Marco Polo It happened so long ago It
is hard to think of a tragedy in a strange country and we in this
garden on the second moon of spring And it was so very long ago Do
you hear the bees Marco Polothe bees among the almondblossoms And
see the blue heron by the lotus flowers And do you see the little
tortoise Marco Polo and he sunning himself on a leaf If I throw a
pebble Marco Polo he will dive and he is such a clumsy diver Marco
Polo

But you must listen Golden Bells and believe me

I do believe Marco Polo I honestly do Dont you know I believe
you Anything you say Marco Polo I believe You wouldnt be coming
all the way over the world to be telling me a lie Of course I
believe

And doesnt it make you happy Golden Bells

Once I was unhappy Marco Polo I used sit here and on my lute I
used play the Song of the Willow Branches which is the saddest song
in the world Under the moon I used be lonely and the droning of the
bees meant nothing to me and now it is a sweet brave song I cannot
play Willow Branches any more so alien is sadness to me And the
moon smiles I am very happy Marco Polo

It is the True Religion little Golden Bells that makes you happy

Is it Marco Polo Is it It must be I suppose I dont know what
it is but I am very happy



CHAPTER XVIII

And he told her of Paul who had seen a vision and gone preaching
through the world who was persecuted who was shipwrecked who was
bitten by a viper and who survived everything that he might preach the
Lord Jesus He was a fierce ragged man with burning eyes And he
told her of Pauls instructions to women

You do not look at me when you speak Marco Polo Only your voice
comes to me not your eyes Is it because of Paul

And Marco Polo felt great trouble on him because he could not explain
But Golden Bells went on

There is little in your faith about women Marco Polo Is it a faith
only for men then Is it against women Must the young men not look
at the young women

No Golden Bells the young men must not look too much on the young
women

But that is very foolish Marco Polo Is it wrong to see the beauty
of the almond blossoms wrong to taste the scented wind Is it wrong to
watch the kingfisher seeking his nest Is it wrong to watch the moon
the stars All these are very beautiful Marco Polo so beautiful as
to make me cry Is it wrong to watch them

It is not wrong Golden Bells The glory of God is in the beauty of
his handicraft

Li Po is old and wise and a great poet Marco Polo and Li Po says
there is beauty in a running horse and beauty in a running stream but
there is no beauty like the beauty of a young woman and she letting
down her hair God made the beauty of women too Marco Polo as well
as the beauty of the stars Wont you please explain to me Marco
Polo Why should Li Po say one thing and Saint Paul another

But Golden Bells Saint Paul is inspired of God

But Li Po is inspired of God too Marco Polo You mustnt be
thinking little of Li Po He is fat and old and drunken but when he
sings Marco Polo it is the song of the wandering stars But why must
not the young men look at the young women Marco Polo Why must they
not look with their eyes

It will be hard for me to tell you Golden Bells

Look at me now Marco Polo Lift up your eyes and look into my eyes
Is there evil in me Marco Polo that your eyes should avoid me as the
fox avoids the dog Or maybe I am not beautiful Maybe they told me
wrong because I was a kings daughter and they would not have me think
little of myself Maybe I am not beautiful Marco Polo maybe I hurt
your eyes

Ah Golden Bells the little horned moon is not more beautiful

Then why must not the young men look at the young women Marco Polo
You are here to instruct me Wont you tell me why

Maybemaybemaybe it is for fear of sin Golden Bells

Sin Sin Why should there be sin I know sin Marco Polo They
have warned me against it since I crept upon the floor There are two
sins There is meanness Marco Polo and there is cruelty and those
are the only sins I know your heart Marco Polo there is no meanness
there You would not have come here were you mean The mean do not
travel afar for other people And cruelty Surely you would not be
cruel to me Marco Polo You would not be cruel to anybody dear Marco
Polo You would not be cruel to me

Cruel to you little Golden Bells How could I be cruel to you

But the sin Marco Polo

I dont know Golden Bells I dont know



CHAPTER XIX

And one dusk the moon rose over the Chinese garden and Marco Polo
finished telling her of what John saw on Patmos and he an old man

Veni Domine Jesu

Gratia Domini nostri Jesu Christi cum omnibus vobis Amen

It is very difficult Marco Polo I dont quite understand

I dont quite understand myself Golden Bells But that is all I can
tell you But you will understand more he said My mission is
finished now and I will go back I will stop at the court of Prester
John and he will send a bishop surely or some great cardinal to
baptize you and to teach you the rest

You will go back A great pain stabbed her I never thought some
how of you as going back

I have come on a mission Golden Bells and I must go back

There is a woman maybe in Venice And she turned her head away
from him and from the moon

I would not have you thinking that Golden Bells There is none in
Venice has duty from me And if the queen of the world were there and
she pledged me I could never look at her and I after knowing you
Golden Bells

Is it money Marco Polo she whispered in the dusk It is maybe
your uncle and your father are pressing you to return Let you not
worry then for my father the great Khan will settle with them too
There is not a horse in all Tartary that your uncle cannot have nor a
woman either And your father can have all the jewels of the
treasury and all the swords too even the sword with which my father
conquered China My father will give him that if I ask Only let you
not be leaving this moonlit garden

Dear Golden Bells it isnt that but I came here for converts

Oh Marco Polo listen There is a folk at Kaifungfu and they are
an evil folk and a cowardly folk and my father abhors them I shall
ask my father to send captains of war and fighting men to convert them
to your faith Marco Polo or lop off their heads And we can send a
few hundreds to the Pope at Rome and he will never know how they were
converted and he will be satisfied Only let you not be going away
from me in my moonlit garden You will only be turning to trade Marco
Polo and marrying a woman Let you stay here in the moonlit garden

Ah little Golden Bells there is no place in the world like your
moonlit garden There is no place Id be liefer than in the moonlit
garden But little Golden Bells I set out in life to preach the Lord
Jesus crucified It was for that I came China

Let you not be fooling yourself young Marco Polo Let you not always
be ascribing to God the things that are mine You did not come to
preach to China you came to see me and your mind stirred up with the
story the seacaptain told of me playing Willow Branches at the Lake
of Cranes O Marco Polo before you came there were the moon and the
sun and the stars and I was lonely O Marco Polo she cried you
wouldnt go you couldnt go What would you be doing in cold Venice
far from the warm moonlit garden

Sure Ill be lonely too little Golden Bells a white monk in a
monastery praying for you

But I dont want to be prayed for Marco Polo She stamped her foot
I want to be loved And there you have it out of me and a great
shame to you that you made me say it me that was desired of many and
would have no man until you came And surely it is the harsh God you
have made out of The Kindly Person you spoke of And tis not He would
have my heart broken and you turning yourself into a crabbed monk
And how do you know your preaching will convert any Tis few you
converted here Ah Im sorry dear Marco Polo I shouldnt have said
it but there is despair on me and I afraid of losing you

Tis true though I have nothing nobody to show

You have me Am nt I converted Am nt I a Christian Marco Polo
let me tell you something I said to my father I wanted to marry you
and I asked him if he would give you a province to govern and he said
Sure and welcome And I asked him for Yangchan the pleasantest city
in all China And he said Sure and welcome Golden Bells And I
told him we would be married and go there and govern his people
kindly And you wouldnt shame me before my own father and all the
people of China You couldnt do that Marco Polo Marco Poloshe
came toward him her eye shininglet you stay

Christ protect me Christ guide me Christ before me

Marco Polo

Christ behind me

The moon Marco Polo and me Golden Bells and the nightingale in the
appletree

Christ on my right hand Christ my left Christ below me

Her arms were around his neck cheek came close to his

Marco Polo Marco Polo

Christ above me

My Marco Polo

O God Golden Bells

And he put his arms around her and his cheek to hers and all the
battle and the disappointment and the fear and the strangeness went out
of him And down by the lake the wee frogs chirruped and in the
appletree the nightingale never ceased from singing And they stayed
there shoulder to shoulder and cheek to cheek And the moon rose
higher And it seemed only a moment they were there until they heard
the voice of Li Po in the garden

Are you there Golden Bells Are you there at all at all For two
hours Ive been hunting and couldnt get sight or sign of you I have
the new song Golden Bells For a long time I was dumb but a little
while ago the power came to me and I have the new song Golden Bells
the marrying song



CHAPTER XX

Thus far said Malachi of the Long Glen the story of Marco Polo

That is a warm story Malachi of the Glen a warm and colored story
and great life to it and Golden Bells is as alive to me as herself
there by the fire and I can see Marco Polo as plain as I can see my
cousin Randall and he playing with dogs

If they werent real and live and warm what would a story be Brian
Oge but a jumble of dead words A house with nobody in it the
poorest thing in the world

But Marco Polo came back to Venice Malachi and fought in the
seawars

Theres more to tell Brian Oge But sometimes I wonder shouldnt the
best part of the story be kept to yourself The people arent as wise
as they used to be brown lad The end of a story now is a bit of
kissing and courting and the kettle boiling to be making tea

But the older ones were wiser Brian Donn They knew that the rhythm
of life is long and swinging and that time doesnt stop short as a
clock Sure what is a kiss from the finest of women but a pleasant
thing like a long putt sunk or the first salmon of the year caught
like a trout or the ball through the goal before the whistle blows
And theres many a wellfilled belly over a hungry soul

But a story is how destiny is interwoven the fine and gallant and the
tragic points of life And you mustnt look at them with the eyes of
the body but you must feel with the antennae of your being Now if
you were to look at the Lord Jesus with physical eyes what would it be
but a kindly crazy man and He coming to a hard and bitter end Look
at it simply and what was the story of Troy but a dirty row over a
woman

But often times the stories with endings that grocers daughters do
not be liking are the stories that are worth while And the worth
while stories do be lasting Never clip a story halfways because
Widow Robinson doesnt like to have her mind disturbed and she warming
her breadth at the fire The Widow Robinson may have a white coin to
buy a book with and think youre the grand author entirely and you
pleasing her But Lord God who gave you the stories know you for a
louse

I call to your mind the stories of great English writerthe plays of
the Prince of Denmark and the poor blind king on the cliff and the
Scottish chieftain and his terrible wife The Widow Robinson will not
like those stories and she will be keeping her white coin But those
stories will endure forever

I will now tell you of Marco Polo and him leaving China



CHAPTER XXI

You must see him now as he was seventeen years after he had come to
China and fourteen years after his wife little Golden Bells had
died a lean figure of a man with his hair streaked with gray a lean
hard face on him and savage eyes and all the body of him steel and
whalebone from riding on the great Khans business and riding fast
and furious so that he might sleep and forget but forgetting never
came to him You might think he was a harsh man from his face and
eyes but he was the straight man in administering justice and he had
the soft heart for the poorthe heart of Golden Bells He was easily
moved to anger but the fine Chinese people never minded him knowing
he was a suffering man Though never a word of Golden Bells came from
his mouth barring maybe that line of Dantes the saddest line in the
world and that he used to repeat to himself and no one there

 la bella persona
 Che mi fu toltache mi fu tolta who was
 taken from me Taken Taken from me

And oftentimes a look would come over his face as if he were listening
for a voice to speaklistening listening and then a wee harsh laugh
would come from him very heartbreaking to hear and whatever was in
his hand papers or a ridingwhip he would pitch down and walk away

He had just come in from the borders of the Arctic lands from giving
the khans orders to the squat hairy tribes who live by the icy
shores and had come to the garden by the Lake of Cranes the garden
where the Golden Bells of singing and laughter were dumb this armful of
years and he was alone and the listening look was on his face when
there came Kubla and Li Po and the old magician

Now Kubla was very old so old he could hardly walk and very frail
and Li Po was very old too and gray in the face and sadder in the
eyes than ever and the magicians white beard had grown to his knees
but there was no more humor in his eyes And Marco Polo helped the
old khan to sit down

Oh sir why did you come to me Sure I was going to you the moment I
had changed my ridingclothes Sir you should have stayed in your
bed

There was something on my mind Marco and the old do be thinking long
to get things off their mind

What can I do sir

Marco my child you mustnt take what I say amiss But I want you to
be going back to be going back to Venice

Sir what have I done to dissatisfy you In all my embassies have I
been weak to the strong or bullying toward the weak Does an oppressed
man complain of injustice does a merchant complain of being cheated
or a woman say she was wronged

Now Marco of my heart didnt I say not to be taking it amiss Is
there any one closer to me nor you or is it likely Id be listening to
stories brought against you Its just this Im an old and tired
man Marco Beag and in a week or a moon at most Im due to die so the
Sanang tells me Dont be sorry son Be glad for me Life has been
a wee bit too long

And now son dear I want to tell you Youve been closer to me than
my own sons and youve been the dear lad And theres not one man in
all China can say you did a harsh or an unjust thing but my dear son
tis just the way of people theres a power of hard feeling against
you in this land you being a stranger and having stood so high

So when Im dead dear son theres many would do you an injury and
treat you badly aye in our family itself though they smile on you
now Let you be going now Marco Ill miss you to close my eyes for
me but my heart will be lighter It will so I couldnt sleep easy
and you ill treated in this land of mine You ask him too Li Po

Ah sir Marco laughedand Li Po what is ill treatment to me
Sorrows my blood brother What Ive suffered Do you think I could
suffer more

I know Marco I know

Dont you think I suffer now sir Fourteen years shes dead now the
wee one who lay by my side in sleep And never a word and never a
sign In the house where we were married I can see the pool and the
willows and the hibiscus but there is never a token of her he broke
out The leaves of trees cover the pavilion the hair of the
musicians is silver and dust is on the blue and white tiles And she
never comes to comfort pie I cant sleep with waiting The stars
never seem to wane and the hoar frost comes on the grass and Im
always waiting Christ Why should I go back Ive forgotten Venice
Ive even forgotten my God for her

Sanang says Kubla Khan to the magician couldnt you do something
for this poor lad

It was now dusk in the garden by the Lake of Cranes

I dont need any damned wizard to bring my wife to me raged Marco
Polo If she were to come she would come and I in the dark of the
moon and the moorfowl calling She would have come because my heart
needed her And he raged through the dusk by the Lake of Cranes

Now Marco dear lad dont be flying off again but remember that
there is science needed to all things And think too that maybe she
was not permitted The older we get the more we understand the
destiny that rules all things with now a nudge with now a leading
finger with now a terrible blow over the heart and what we think at
twentyfive was a trifling accident at seventyfive we know to have
been the enormous gesture of God We are not asked when we like to be
born Marco nor is it up to us when to die

And again Marco consider If she were to have come to you in the
dark of the moontime in the strange mystic hours when you can hear
eternity tick like a clock your eyes would have been not on this
world but the next Your look would have been vacant thats now keen
to discover injustice Your body would have been flabby thats now
whalebone and steel And there would have been no memory of you in
China thats now like sweet honey in the mouth

Would a wee dead spirit be proud of a man Marco and he just crying
crying crying and letting the days go by while even the brown bee
works and even the grass grows that cattle may fatten and men eat She
might be sorry but would there be pride on her Even a dead woman
wants a strong man

Now Im not saying that the silent dead should not have a voice in
our affairs when we need them But they have wisdom else what is the
use of having died And if the Sanang can bring her shell come now
and join with us in asking you now being the time shes needed

Child be guided by us three ancient men I have lived long and have
knowledge of the world Li Po has lived long and has knowledge of the
heart The Sanang has lived long and knows the secrets of the dead
If to our three voices who love you there is added a sign from Golden
Bells will you leave China

If there is a sign from her Ill leave China said Marco Polo

And it was dusk in the Garden by the Lake of Cranes



CHAPTER XXII

The Sanang came over to Marco Polo

Give me the black tress thats over your heart

And Marco Polo undid his coat and his undercoat and his fine sark and
took out the perfumed hair and gave it to the Sanang

Let you sing a little song Li Po the magician said the way shell
be hearing and come I have part of her here and let you put in the
garden the atmosphere she loved And Li Po took his lute and plucked
gently at the strings

 The swish of your silken skirt is discontinued

he sang

 And the grass grows through the broken hearth stone
 And your room that was so warm and swept is cold and mouldy
 But he the beloved of your heart clings on
 A fallen leaf in the chink of a door
 In the chink of a closed door

And it was dusk in the garden and the voice of Li Po broke and his
lute stilled and the old Emperor breathed his aged gentle breathing
and the Sanang said his secret terrible formulae and Marco Polo was
tense as a hunting dog

And suddenly at the end of the garden in the perfumed Asian dusk
there was a beam like moonlight and into the soft ray of it trod
little Golden Bells with her wee warm face and her wee warm hands
and her hair dark as a cloud and her eyes pleading pleading

Go now Marco Polo please go Her lips made the words but no sound
came to him

Oh Golden Bells Golden Bells he rushed forward but the moonlight
of no moon faded and there was nothing and he dropped on his knees
sobbing in the dusk by the Lake of Cranes



CHAPTER XXIII

And after a while he got up from his knees and set his teeth on his
sobbing and threw his head back and squared his shoulders and notched
his belt and faced the three ancient men

Well he said thats that

He went over and knelt and kissed the Khans hand

Youll be seeing her soon sir youll be telling her everything

Yes son Ill tell her

Then he patted the Sanang on the shoulder and Thanks said he
simply and he took Li Pos hand in both his and they looked at each
other for a moment and no words came to either

Well he says at length Ill be hitting the road then Ill not
say goodby to any of you Ill be seeing you all pretty soon again
Theres a war on between Venice and the Genoese and where thats
hottest youll find me and the quicker my end the better Ill be
pleased But it would be like my luck he said bitterly not to be
killed but to be taken prisoner and to end my life in some lousy jail
Oh well well hope for the best He laughed Soso long

And the four of them looked at one another trying to smile and great
grief on them

China will miss you my son said old Kubla

Its nothing to how Ill be missing China said Marco Polo Venice
Its only a sound to me Ill be an exile in the city of my birth
But whats the use of complaining If its go its go But itll be
funny said he My body will be there but my heart and mind will be
in China Therell be a gray eye always turning to China and it will
never see China Queer All the voices and all the instruments
in Saint Marks and in my ears the little drums of China All the
sunlight will be glinting on the Grand Canal but the little rain of
Chinathe little rain of China will be falling in my heart

Ah well if its go its go Id better be hitting the road So
Ill say goodby for the presentand

Oh my God Almighty
