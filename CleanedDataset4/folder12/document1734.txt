THE SECRET PLACES OF THE HEART




CHAPTER THE FIRST

THE CONSULTATION

Section 1

The maid was a young woman of great natural calmness she was accustomed
to let in visitors who had this air of being annoyed and finding one
umbrella too numerous for them It mattered nothing to her that the
gentleman was asking for Dr Martineau as if he was asking for something
with an unpleasant taste Almost imperceptibly she relieved him of his
umbrella and juggled his hat and coat on to a massive mahogany stand
What name Sir she asked holding open the door of the consulting
room

Hardy said the gentleman and then yielding it reluctantly with its
distasteful threeyearold honour Sir Richmond Hardy

The door closed softly behind him and he found himself in undivided
possession of the large indifferent apartment in which the nervous and
mental troubles of the outer world eddied for a time on their way to
the distinguished specialist A bowl of daffodils a handsome bookcase
containing bound Victorian magazines and antiquated medical works some
paintings of Scotch scenery three big armchairs a buhl clock and
a bronze Dancing Faun by their want of any collective idea enhanced
rather than mitigated the promiscuous disregard of the room He drifted
to the midmost of the three windows and stared out despondently at
Harley Street

For a minute or so he remained as still and limp as an empty jacket on
its peg and then a gust of irritation stirred him

Damned fool I was to come here he said DAMNED fool

Rush out of the place

Ive given my name

He heard the door behind him open and for a moment pretended not to
hear Then he turned round I dont see what you can do for me he
said

Im sure _I_ dont said the doctor People come here and talk

There was something reassuringly inaggressive about the figure that
confronted Sir Richmond Dr Martineaus height wanted at least three
inches of Sir Richmonds five feet eleven he was humanly plump his
face was round and pink and cheerfully wistful a little suggestive of
the full moon of what the full moon might be if it could get fresh air
and exercise Either his tailor had made his trousers too short or he
had braced them too high so that he seemed to have grown out of them
quite recently Sir Richmond had been dreading an encounter with some
dominating and mesmeric personality this amiable presence dispelled his
preconceived resistances

Dr Martineau a little out of breath as though he had been running
upstairs with his hands in his trouser pockets seemed intent only on
disavowals People come here and talk It does them good and sometimes
I am able to offer a suggestion

Talking to someone who understands a little he expanded the idea

Im jangling damnablyoverwork

Not overwork Dr Martineau corrected Not overwork Overwork never
hurt anyone Fatigue stops that A man can workgood straightforward
work without internal resistance until he dropsand never hurt
himself You must be working against friction

Friction Im like a machine without oil Im grinding to death
And its so DAMNED important I SHOULDNT break down Its VITALLY
important

He stressed his words and reinforced them with a quivering gesture
of his upraised clenched hand My tempers in rags I explode at any
little thing Im RAW I cant work steadily for ten minutes and I cant
leave off working

Your name said the doctor is familiar Sir Richmond Hardy In the
papers What is it

Fuel

Of course The Fuel Commission Stupid of me We certainly cant afford
to have you ill

I AM ill But you cant afford to have me absent from that Commission

Your technical knowledge

Technical knowledge be damned Those men mean to corner the national
fuel supply And waste it For their profits Thats what Im up
against You dont know the job I have to do You dont know what a
Commission of that sort is The moral tangle of it You dont know how
its possibilities and limitations are canvassed and schemed about long
before a single member is appointed Old Cassidy worked the whole thing
with the prime minister I can see that now as plain as daylight I
might have seen it at first Three experts whod been got at they
thought _I_d been got at two Labour men whod do anything you wanted
them to do provided you called them levelheaded Wagstaffe the
socialist art critic who could be trusted to play the fool and make
nationalization look silly and the rest mine owners railway managers
oil profiteers financial adventurers

He was fairly launched Its the blind folly of it In the days before
the war it was different Then there was abundance A little grabbing
or cornering was all to the good All to the good It prevented things
being used up too fast And the world was running by habit the inertia
was tremendous You could take all sorts of liberties But all this
is altered Were living in a different world The public wont stand
things it used to stand Its a new public Itswild Itll smash up
the show if they go too far Everything short and running shorterfood
fuel material But these people go on They go on as though nothing had
changed Strikes Russia nothing will warn them There are men on
that Commission who would steal the brakes off a mountain railway just
before they went down in it Its a struggle with suicidal imbeciles
Its But Im talking I didnt come here to talk Fuel

You think there may be a smashup

I lie awake at night thinking of it

A social smashup

Economic Social Yes Dont you

A social smashup seems to me altogether a possibility All sorts of
people I find think that said the doctor All sorts of people lie
awake thinking of it

I wish some of my damned Committee would

The doctor turned his eyes to the window I lie awake too he said and
seemed to reflect But he was observing his patient acutelywith his
ears

But you see how important it is said Sir Richmond and left his
sentence unfinished

Ill do what I can for you said the doctor and considered swiftly
what line of talk he had best follow

Section 2

This sense of a coming smash is epidemic said the doctor Its at
the back of all sorts of mental trouble It is a new state of mind
Before the war it was abnormala phase of neurasthenia Now it is
almost the normal state with whole classes of intelligent people
Intelligent I say The others always have been casual and adventurous
and always will be A loss of confidence in the general background of
life So that we seem to float over abysses

We do said Sir Richmond

And we have nothing but the old habits and ideas acquired in the days
of our assurance There is a discord a jarring

The doctor pursued his train of thought A new raw and dreadful sense
of responsibility for the universe Accompanied by a realization that
the job is overwhelmingly too big for us

Weve got to stand up to the job said Sir Richmond Anyhow what
else is there to do We MAY keep things together Ive got to do my
bit And if only I could hold myself at it I could beat those fellows
But thats where the devil of it comes in Never have I been so desirous
to work well in my life And never have I been so slack and weakwilled
and inaccurate Sloppy Indolent VICIOUS

The doctor was about to speak but Sir Richmond interrupted him Whats
got hold of me Whats got hold of me I used to work well enough Its
as if my will had come untwisted and was ravelling out into separate
strands Ive lost my unity Im not a man but a mob Ive got to
recover my vigour At any cost

Again as the doctor was about to speak the word was taken out of his
mouth And what I think of it Dr Martineau is this its fatigue
Its mental and moral fatigue Too much effort On too high a level And
too austere One strains and fags FLAGS Flags I meant to say One
strains and flags and then the lower stuff in one the subconscious
stuff takes control

There was a flavour of popularized psychoanalysis about this and the
doctor drew in the corners of his mouth and gave his head a critical
slant Mm But this only made Sir Richmond raise his voice and
quicken his speech I want he said a good tonic A pickmeup
a stimulating harmless drug of some sort Thats indicated anyhow To
begin with Something to pull me together as people say Bring me up to
the scratch again

I dont like the use of drugs said the doctor

The expectation of Sir Richmonds expression changed to disappointment
But thats not reasonable he cried Thats not reasonable Thats
superstition Call a thing a drug and condemn it Everything is a drug
Everything that affects you Food stimulates or tranquillizes Drink
Noise is a stimulant and quiet an opiate What is life but response to
stimulants Or reaction after them When Im exhausted I want food When
Im overactive and sleepless I want tranquillizing When Im dispersed I
want pulling together

But we dont know how to use drugs the doctor objected

But you ought to know

Dr Martineau fixed his eye on a first floor window sill on the opposite
side of Harley Street His manner suggested a lecturer holding on to his
theme

A day will come when we shall be able to manipulate drugsall sorts
of drugsand work them in to our general way of living I have no
prejudice against them at all A time will come when we shall correct
our moods get down to our reserves of energy by their help suspend
fatigue put off sleep during long spells of exertion At some sudden
crisis for example When we shall know enough to know just how far to
go with this that or the other stuff And how to wash out its after
effects I quite agree with youin principle But that time
hasnt come yet Decades of research yet If we tried that sort
of thing now we should be like children playing with poisons and
explosives Its out of the question

Ive been taking a few little things already Easton Syrup for
example

Strychnine It carries you for a time and drops you by the way Has it
done you any goodany NETT good It hasI can seebroken your sleep

The doctor turned round again to his patient and looked up into his
troubled face

Given physiological trouble I dont mind resorting to a drug Given
structural injury I dont mind surgery But except for any little
mischief your amateur drugging may have done you do not seem to me to
be either sick or injured Youve no trouble either of structure or
material You areworriedill in your mind and otherwise perfectly
sound Its the current of your thoughts fermenting If the trouble is
in the mental sphere why go out of the mental sphere for a treatment
Talk and thought these are your remedies Cool deliberate thought
Youre unravelled You say it yourself Drugs will only make this or
that unravelled strand behave disproportionately You dont want that
You want to take stock of yourself as a wholefind out where you stand

But the Fuel Commission

Is it sitting now

Adjourned till after Whitsuntide But theres heaps of work to be done

Still he added this is my one chance of any treatment

The doctor made a little calculation Three weeks Its scarcely
time enough to begin

Youre certain that no regimen of carefully planned and chosen
tonics

Dismiss the idea Dismiss it He decided to take a plunge Ive just
been thinking of a little holiday for myself But Id like to see you
through this And if I am to see you through there ought to be some
sort of beginning now In this three weeks Suppose

Sir Richmond leapt to his thought Im free to go anywhere

Golf would drive a man of your composition mad

It would

Thats that Still The country must be getting beautiful again
nowafter all the rain we have had I have a little twoseater I
dont know The repair people promise to release it before Friday

But _I_ have a choice of two very comfortable little cars Why not be
my guest

That might be more convenient

Id prefer my own car

Then what do you say

I agree Peripatetic treatment

South and west We could talk on the road In the evenings By the
wayside We might make the beginnings of a treatment  A simple tour
Nothing elaborate You wouldnt bring a man

I always drive myself

Section 3

Theres something very pleasant said the doctor envisaging his own
rash proposal in travelling along roads you dont know and seeing
houses and parks and villages and towns for which you do not feel in
the slightest degree responsible They hide all their troubles from the
road Their backyards are tucked away out of sight they show a brave
face theres none of the nasty selfbetrayals of the railway approach
And everything will be fresh still There will still be a lot of
appleblossomand bluebells And all the while we can be getting on
with your affair

He was back at the window now I want the holiday myself he said

He addressed Sir Richmond over his shoulder Have you noted how fagged
and unstable EVERYBODY is getting Everybody intelligent I mean

Its an infernally worrying time

Exactly Everybody suffers

Its no GOOD going on in the old ways

It isnt And its a frightful strain to get into any new ways So here
we are

A man the doctor expanded isnt a creature in vacuo Hes himself
and his world Hes a surface of contact a system of adaptations
between his essential self and his surroundings Well our surroundings
have becomehow shall I put ita landslide The war which seemed
such a definable catastrophe in 1914 was after all only the first loud
crack and smash of the collapse The war is over andnothing is over
This peace is a farce reconstruction an exploded phrase The slide goes
onit goes if anything faster without a sign of stopping And all
our poor little adaptations Which we have been elaborating and trusting
all our lives One after another they fail us We are stripped
We have to begin all over again Im fiftyseven and I feel at times
nowadays like a chicken new hatched in a thunderstorm

The doctor walked towards the bookcase and turned

Everybody is like thatit isntwhat are you going to do It
isntwhat am I going to do Itswhat are we all going to do Lord
How safe and established everything was in 1910 say We talked of this
great war that was coming but nobody thought it would come We had been
born in peace comparatively speaking we had been brought up in peace
There was talk of wars There were warslittle warsthat altered
nothing material Consols used to be at 112 and you fed your
household on ten shillings a head a week You could run over all Europe
barring Turkey and Russia without even a passport You could get to
Italy in a day Never were life and comfort so safefor respectable
people And we WERE respectable people That was the world that made
us what we are That was the sheltering and friendly greenhouse in
which we grew We fitted our minds to that And here we are with the
greenhouse falling in upon us lump by lump smash and clatter the wild
winds of heaven tearing in through the gaps

Upstairs on Dr Martineaus desk lay the typescript of the opening
chapters of a book that was intended to make a great splash in the
world his PSYCHOLOGY OF A NEW AGE He had his metaphors ready

We said This system will always go on We neednt bother about it
We just planned our lives accordingly It was like a bird building
its nest of frozen snakes My father left me a decent independence I
developed my position I have lived between here and the hospital doing
good work enormously interested prosperous mildly distinguished I
had been born and brought up on the good ship Civilization I assumed
that someone else was steering the ship all right I never knew I never
enquired

Nor did I said Sir Richmond but

And nobody was steering the ship the doctor went on Nobody had ever
steered the ship It was adrift

I realized that I

It is a new realization Always hitherto men have lived by faithas
children do as the animals do At the back of the healthy mind human
or animal has been this persuasion This is all right This will go
on If I keep the rule if I do so and so all will be well I need not
trouble further things are cared for

If we could go on like that said Sir Richmond

We cant That faith is dead The warand the peacehave killed it

The doctors round face became speculative His resemblance to the full
moon increased He seemed to gaze at remote things It may very well
be that man is no more capable of living out of that atmosphere of
assurance than a tadpole is of living out of water His mental
existence may be conditional on that Deprived of it he may become
incapable of sustained social life He may become frantically
selfseekingincoherent a stampede Human sanity mayDISPERSE

Thats our trouble the doctor completed Our fundamental trouble
All our confidences and our accustomed adaptations are destroyed We fit
together no longer We areloose We dont know where we are nor what
to do The psychology of the former time fails to give safe responses
and the psychology of the New Age has still to develop

Section 4

That is all very well said Sir Richmond in the resolute voice of one
who will be pent no longer That is all very well as far as it goes
But it does not cover my case I am not suffering from inadaptation I
HAVE adapted I have thought things out I thinkmuch as you do Much
as you do So its not that But Mind you I am perfectly clear
where I am Where we are What is happening to us all is the breakup
of the entire system Agreed We have to make another system or perish
amidst the wreckage I see that clearly Science and plan have to
replace custom and tradition in human affairs Soon Very soon Granted
Granted We used to say all that Even before the war Now we mean it
Weve muddled about in the old ways overlong Some new sort of world
planned and scientific has to be got going Civilization renewed
Rebuilding civilizationwhile the premises are still occupied and busy
Its an immense enterprise but it is the only thing to be done In some
ways its an enormously attractive enterprise Inspiring It grips my
imagination I think of the other men who must be at work Working as I
do rather in the dark as yet With whom I shall presently join up The
attempt may fail all things human may fail but on the other hand
it may succeed I never had such faith in anything as I have in the
rightness of the work I am doing now I begin at that But here is where
my difficulty comes in The top of my brain my innermost self says all
that I have been saying butThe rest of me wont follow The rest of
me refuses to attend forgets straggles misbehaves

Exactly

The word irritated Sir Richmond Not exactly at all Amazingly
if you like I have this unlimited faith in our present tremendous
necessityfor workfor devotion I believe my share the work I am
doing is essential to the whole thingand I work sluggishly I work
reluctantly I work damnably

Exact The doctor checked himself All that is explicable Indeed it
is Listen for a moment to me Consider what you are Consider what
we are Consider what a man is before you marvel at his ineptitudes
of will Face the accepted facts Here is a creature not ten thousand
generations from the ape his ancestor Not ten thousand And that ape
again not a score of thousands from the monkey his forebear A mans
body his bodily powers are just the body and powers of an ape a
little improved a little adapted to novel needs That brings me to my
point CAN HIS MIND AND WILL BE ANYTHING BETTER For a few generations
a few hundreds at most knowledge and wide thought have flared out on
the darknesses of life But the substance of man is ape still He may
carry a light in his brain but his instincts move in the darkness Out
of that darkness he draws his motives

Or fails to draw them said Sir Richmond

Or fails And that is where these new methods of treatment come in
We explore that failure Together What the psychoanalyst doesand I
will confess that I owe much to the psychoanalystwhat he does is to
direct thwarted disappointed and perplexed people to the realities of
their own nature Which they have been accustomed to ignore and
forget They come to us with high ambitions or lovely illusions about
themselves torn shredded spoilt They are morally denuded Dreams
they hate pursue them abhorrent desires draw them they are the prey of
irresistible yet uncongenial impulses they succumb to black despairs
The first thing we ask them is this What else could you expect

What else could I expect Sir Richmond repeated looking down on him
Hm

The wonder is not that you are sluggish reluctantly unselfish
inattentive spasmodic The wonder is that you are ever anything
else Do you realize that a few million generations ago everything
that stirs in us everything that exalts human life selfdevotions
heroisms the utmost triumphs of art the lovefor love it isthat
makes you and me care indeed for the fate and welfare of all this round
world was latent in the body of some little lurking beast that crawled
and hid among the branches of vanished and forgotten Mesozoic trees
A petty egglaying bristlecovered beast it was with no more of the
rudiments of a soul than bare hunger weak lust and fear People
always seem to regard that as a curious fact of no practical importance
It isnt its a vital fact of the utmost practical importance That
is what you are made of Why should you expectbecause a war and a
revolution have shocked youthat you should suddenly be able to reach
up and touch the sky

Hm said Sir Richmond Have I been touching the sky

You are trying to play the part of an honest rich man

I dont care to see the whole system go smash

Exactly said the doctor before he could prevent himself

But is it any good to tell a man that the job he is attempting is above
himthat he is just a hairy reptile twice removedand all that sort of
thing

Well it saves him from hoping too much and being too greatly
disappointed It recalls him to the proportions of the job He gets
something done by not attempting everything  And it clears him up
We get him to look into himself to see directly and in measurable
terms what it is that puts him wrong and holds him back Hes no longer
vaguely incapacitated He knows

Thats diagnosis Thats not treatment

Treatment by diagnosis To analyze a mental knot is to untie it

You propose that I shall spend my time until the Commission meets in
thinking about myself I wanted to forget myself

Like a man who tries to forget that his petrol is running short and
a cylinder missing fire No Come back to the question of what you
are said the doctor A creature of the darkness with new lights Lit
and halfblinded by science and the possibilities of controlling the
world that it opens out In that light your will is all for service
you care more for mankind than for yourself You begin to understand
something of the self beyond your self But it is a partial and a shaded
light as yet a little area about you it makes clear the rest is
still the old darknessof millions of intense and narrow animal
generations You are like someone who awakens out of an immemorial
sleep to find himself in a vast chamber in a great and ancient house a
great and ancient house high amidst frozen and lifeless mountainsin a
sunless universe You are not alone in it You are not lord of all you
survey Your leadership is disputed The darkness even of the room you
are in is full of ancient and discarded but quite unsubjugated powers
and purposes They thrust ambiguous limbs and claws suddenly out of
the darkness into the light of your attention They snatch things out
of your hand they trip your feet and jog your elbow They crowd and
cluster behind you Wherever your shadow falls they creep right up to
you creep upon you and struggle to take possession of you The souls
of apes monkeys reptiles and creeping things haunt the passages and
attics and cellars of this living house in which your consciousness has
awakened

The doctor gave this quotation from his unpublished book the advantages
of an abrupt break and a pause

Sir Richmond shrugged his shoulders and smiled And you propose a
vermin hunt in the old tenement

The modern man has to be master in his own house He has to take stock
and know what is there

Three weeks of self vivisection

To begin with Three weeks of perfect honesty with yourself As an
opening It will take longer than that if we are to go through with
the job

It is a considerableprocess

It is

Yet you shrink from simple things like drugs

Selfknowledgewithout anaesthetics

Has this sort of thing ever done anyone any good at all

It has turned hundreds back to sanity and steady work

How frank are we going to be How full are we going to be Anyhowwe
can break off at any time Well try it Well try it And so for
this journey into the west of England Andif we can get thereIm
not sure that we can get thereinto the secret places of my heart




CHAPTER THE SECOND

LADY HARDY

The patient left the house with much more self possession than he had
shown when entering it Dr Martineau had thrust him back from his
intenser prepossessions to a more generalized view of himself had made
his troubles objective and detached him from them He could even find
something amusing now in his situation He liked the immense scope of
the theoretical duet in which they had indulged He felt that most of it
was entirely trueand in some untraceable manner absurd There were
entertaining possibilities in the prospect of the doctor drawing him
outhe himself partly assisting and partly resisting

He was a man of extensive reservations His private life was in some
respects exceptionally private

I dont confide Do I even confide in myself I imagine I do Is
there anything in myself that I havent looked squarely in the face
How much are we going into Even as regards facts

Does it really help a manto see himself

Such thoughts engaged him until he found himself in his study His desk
and his writing table were piled high with a heavy burthen of work
Still a little preoccupied with Dr Martineaus exposition he began to
handle this confusion

At half past nine he found himself with three hours of good work behind
him It had seemed like two He had not worked like this for many weeks
This is very cheering he said And unexpected Can old Moonface
have hypnotized me Anyhow Perhaps Ive only imagined I was ill
Dinner He looked at his watch and was amazed at the time Good Lord
Ive been at it three hours What can have happened Funny I didnt hear
the gong

He went downstairs and found Lady Hardy reading a magazine in a
diningroom armchair and finely poised between devotion and martyrdom A
shadow of vexation fell athwart his mind at the sight of her

Id no idea it was so late he said I heard no gong

After you swore so at poor Bradley I ordered that there should be no
gongs when we were alone I did come up to your door about half past
eight I crept up But I was afraid I might upset you if I came in

But youve not waited

Ive had a mouthful of soup Lady Hardy rang the bell

Ive done some work at last said Sir Richmond astride on the
hearthrug

Im glad said Lady Hardy without gladness I waited for three
hours

Lady Hardy was a frail little blueeyed woman with uneven shoulders and
a delicate sweet profile Hers was that type of face that under even
the most pleasant and luxurious circumstances still looks bravely and
patiently enduring Her refinement threw a tinge of coarseness over his
eager consumption of his excellent clear soup

Whats this fish Bradley he asked

Turbot Sir Richmond

Dont you have any he asked his wife

Ive had a little fish said Lady Hardy

When Bradley was out of the room Sir Richmond remarked I saw that
nerves man Dr Martineau today He wants me to take a holiday

The quiet patience of the ladys manner intensified She said nothing
A flash of resentment lit Sir Richmonds eyes When he spoke again he
seemed to answer unspoken accusations Dr Martineaus idea is that he
should come with me

The lady adjusted herself to a new point of view

But wont that be reminding you of your illness and worries

He seems a good sort of fellow Im inclined to like him Hell
be as good company as anyone This TOURNEDOS looks excellent Have
some

I had a little bird said Lady Hardy when I found you werent
coming

But I saydont wait here if youve dined Bradley can see to me

She smiled and shook her head with the quiet conviction of one who knew
her duty better Perhaps Ill have a little ice pudding when it comes
she said

Sir Richmond detested eating alone in an atmosphere of observant
criticism And he did not like talking with his mouth full to an
unembarrassed interlocutor who made no conversational leads of her own
After a few mouthfuls he pushed his plate away from him Then lets
have up the ice pudding he said with a faint note of bitterness

But have you finished

The ice pudding he exploded wrathfully The ice pudding

Lady Hardy sat for a moment a picture of meek distress Then her
delicate eyebrows raised and the corners of her mouth drooping she
touched the button of the silver tablebell




CHAPTER THE THIRD

THE DEPARTURE

Section 1

No wise man goes out upon a novel expedition without misgivings And
between their first meeting and the appointed morning both Sir Richmond
Hardy and Dr Martineau were the prey of quite disagreeable doubts about
each other themselves and the excursion before them At the time
of their meeting each had been convinced that he gauged the other
sufficiently for the purposes of the proposed tour Afterwards each
found himself trying to recall the other with greater distinctness
and able to recall nothing but queer ominous and minatory traits
The doctors impression of the great fuel specialist grew ever darker
leaner taller and more impatient Sir Richmond took on the likeness of
a monster obdurate and hostile he spread upwards until like the Djinn
out of the bottle he darkened the heavens And he talked too much He
talked ever so much too much Sir Richmond also thought that the doctor
talked too much In addition he read into his imperfect memory of the
doctors face an expression of protruded curiosity What was all this
problem of motives and inclinations that they were going into so
gaily He had merely consulted the doctor on a simple straightforward
need for a nervous tonicthat was what he had neededa tonic Instead
he had engaged himself forhe scarcely knew whatan indiscreet
indelicate and altogether undesirable experiment in confidences

Both men were considerably reassured when at last they set eyes on
each other again Indeed each was surprised to find something almost
agreeable in the appearance of the other Dr Martineau at once
perceived that the fierceness of Sir Richmond was nothing more than the
fierceness of an overwrought man and Sir Richmond realized at a glance
that the curiosity of Dr Martineaus bearing had in it nothing personal
or base it was just the fine alertness of the scientific mind

Sir Richmond had arrived nearly forty minutes late and it would have
been evident to a much less highly trained observer than Dr Martineau
that some dissension had arisen between the little ladylike cream and
black Charmeuse car and its owner There was a faint air of resentment
and protest between them As if Sir Richmond had been in some way rude
to it

The cap of the radiator was adorned with a little brass figure of a
flying Mercury Frozen in a sprightly attitude its stiff bound and its
fixed heavenward stare was highly suggestive of a forced and tactful
disregard of current unpleasantness

Nothing was said however to confirm or dispel this suspicion of a
disagreement between the man and the car Sir Richmond directed and
assisted Dr Martineaus man to adjust the luggage at the back and Dr
Martineau watched the proceedings from his dignified front door He was
wearing a suit of fawn tweeds a fawn Homburg hat and a light Burberry
with just that effect of special preparation for a holiday which betrays
the habitually busy man Sir Richmonds brown gauntness was he noted
greatly set off by his suit of grey There had certainly been some sort
of quarrel Sir Richmond was explaining the straps to Dr Martineaus
butler with the coldness a man betrays when he explains the uncongenial
habits of some unloved intimate And when the moment came to start and
the little engine did not immediately respond to the electric starter
he said Oh COME up you

His voice sank at the last word as though it was an entirely
confidential communication to the little car And it was an extremely
low and disagreeable word So Dr Martineau decided that it was not his
business to hear it

It was speedily apparent that Sir Richmond was an experienced and
excellent driver He took the Charmeuse out into the traffic of
Baker Street and westward through brisk and busy streets and roads
to Brentford and Hounslow smoothly and swiftly making a score of
unhesitating and accurate decisions without apparent thought There
was very little conversation until they were through Brentford Near
Shepherds Bush Sir Richmond had explained This is not my own
particular car That was butted into at the garage this morning and
its radiator cracked So I had to fall back on this Its quite a good
little car In its way My wife drives it at times It has one or two
constitutional weaknessesincidental to the makegearbox over the
back axle for examplegets all the vibration Whole machine rather on
the flimsy side Still

He left the topic at that

Dr Martineau said something of no consequence about its being a very
comfortable little car

Somewhere between Brentford and Hounslow Sir Richmond plunged into
the matter between them I dont know how deep we are going into these
psychological probings of yours he said But I doubt very much if we
shall get anything out of them

Probably not said Dr Martineau

After all what I want is a tonic I dont see that there is anything
positively wrong with me A certain lack of energy

Lack of balance corrected the doctor You are wasting energy upon
internal friction

But isnt that inevitable No machine is perfectly efficient No man
either There is always a waste Waste of the type waste of the
individual idiosyncrasy This little car for instance isnt pulling as
she ought to pullshe never does Shes low in her class So with
myself there is a natural and necessary high rate of energy waste
Moods of apathy and indolence are natural to me Damn that omnibus All
over the road

We dont deny the imperfection began the doctor

One has to fit oneself to ones circumstances said Sir Richmond
opening up another line of thought

We dont deny the imperfection the doctor stuck to it These new
methods of treatment are based on the idea of imperfection We begin
with that I began with that last Tuesday

Sir Richmond too was sticking to his argument A man and for
that matter the world he lives in is a tangle of accumulations Your
psychoanalyst starts it seems to me with a notion of stripping down
to something fundamental The ape before was a tangle of accumulations
just as we are So it was with his forebears So it has always been All
life is an endless tangle of accumulations

Recognize it said the doctor

And then said Sir Richmond controversially

Recognize in particular your own tangle

Is my particular tangle very different from the general tangle Oh
Damn this feeble little engine I am a creature of undecided will
urged on by my tangled heredity to do a score of entirely incompatible
things Mankind all life is that

But our concern is the particular score of incompatible things you are
urged to do We examine and weighwe weigh

The doctor was still saying these words when a violent and ultimately
disastrous struggle began between Sir Richmond and the little Charmeuse
car The doctor stopped in midsentence

It was near Taplow station that the mutual exasperation of man and
machine was brought to a crisis by the clumsy emergence of a laundry
cart from a side road Sir Richmond was obliged to pull up smartly and
stopped his engine It refused an immediate obedience to the electric
starter Then it picked up raced noisily disengaged great volumes of
bluish smoke and displayed an unaccountable indisposition to run on any
gear but the lowest Sir Richmond thought aloud unpleasing thoughts
He addressed the little car as a person he referred to ancient disputes
and temperamental incompatibilities His anger betrayed him a coarse
illbred man The little car quickened under his reproaches There were
some moments of hope dashed by the necessity of going dead slow behind
an interloping van Sir Richmond did not notice the outstretched arm
of the driver of the van and stalled his engine for a second time The
electric starter refused its office altogether

For some moments Sir Richmond sat like a man of stone

I must wind it up he said at last in a profound and awful voice I
must wind it up

I get out dont I asked the doctor unanswered and did so Sir
Richmond after a grim search and the displacement and replacement of
the luggage produced a handle from the locker at the back of the car
and prepared to wind

There was a little difficulty Come UP he said and the small engine
roared out like a stage lion

The two gentlemen resumed their seats The car started and then by an
unfortunate inadvertency Sir Richmond pulled the gear lever over from
the first speed to the reverse There was a metallic clangour beneath
the two gentlemen and the car slowed down and stopped although the
engine was still throbbing wildly and the dainty veil of blue smoke
still streamed forward from the back of the car before a gentle breeze
The doctor got out almost precipitately followed by a gaunt madman
mouthing vileness who had only a minute or so before been a decent
British citizen He made some blind lunges at the tremulous but obdurate
car but rather as if he looked for offences and accusations than for
displacements to adjust Quivering and refusing the little car was
extraordinarily like some recalcitrant little old aristocratic lady
in the hands of revolutionaries and this made the behaviour of Sir
Richmond seem even more outrageous than it would otherwise have done He
stopped the engine he went down on his hands and knees in the road to
peer up at the gearbox then without restoring the spark he tried
to wind up the engine again He spun the little handle with an insane
violence faster and faster foras it seemed to the doctorthe better
part of a minute Beads of perspiration appeared upon his brow and ran
together he bared his teeth in a snarl his hat slipped over one eye
He groaned with rage Then using the starting handle as a club he
assailed the car He smote the brazen Mercury from its foothold and sent
it and a part of the radiator cap with it flying across the road He
beat at the wings of the bonnet until they bent in under his blows
Finally he hurled the startinghandle at the windscreen and smashed
it The startinghandle rattled over the bonnet and fell to the
ground

The paroxysm was over Ten seconds later this cataclysmal lunatic had
reverted to sanitya rather sheepish sanity

He thrust his hands into his trouser pockets and turned his back on the
car He remarked in a voice of melancholy detachment It was a mistake
to bring that coupe

Dr Martineau had assumed an attitude of trained observation on the side
path His hands rested on his hips and his hat was a little on one
side He was inclined to agree with Sir Richmond I dont know he
considered You wanted some such blowoff as this

Did I

The energy you have That car must be somebodys whipping boy

The devil it is said Sir Richmond turning round sharply and staring
at it as if he expected it to display some surprising and yet familiar
features Then he looked questioningly and suspiciously at his
companion

These outbreaks do nothing to amend the originating grievance said
the doctor No And at times they are even costly But they certainly
lift a burthen from the nervous system And now I suppose we have to
get that little ruin to Maidenhead

Little ruin repeated Sir Richmond No Theres lots of life in the
little beast yet

He reflected Shell have to be towed He felt in his breast pocket
Somewhere I have the RAC order paper the Badge that will Get
You Home We shall have to hail some passing car to take it into
Maidenhead

Dr Martineau offered and Sir Richmond took and lit a cigarette

For a little while conversation hung fire Then for the first time Dr
Martineau heard his patient laugh

Amazing savage said Sir Richmond Amazing savage

He pointed to his handiwork The little car looks ruffled Well it
may

He became grave again I suppose I ought to apologize

Dr Martineau weighed the situation As between doctor and patient
he said No

Oh said Sir Richmond turned to a new point of view But where the
patient ends and the host begins Im really very sorry He reverted
to his original train of thought which had not concerned Dr Martineau
at all After all the little car was only doing what she was made to
do

Section 2

The affair of the car effectively unsealed Sir Richmonds mind Hitherto
Dr Martineau had perceived the possibility and danger of a defensive
silence or of a still more defensive irony but now that Sir Richmond
had once given himself away he seemed prepared to give himself away to
an unlimited extent He embarked upon an apologetic discussion of the
choleric temperament

He began as they stood waiting for the relief car from the Maidenhead
garage You were talking of the ghosts of apes and monkeys that
suddenly come out from the darkness of the subconscious

You meanwhen we first met at Harley Street

That last apparition of mine seems to have been a gorilla at least

The doctor became precise Gorillaesque We are not descended from
gorillas

Queer thing a fit of rage is

Its one of natures cruder expedients Crude but I doubt if it is
fundamental There doesnt seem to be rage in the vegetable world and
even among the animals No it is not universal He ran his mind over
classes and orders Wasps and bees certainly seem to rage but if one
comes to think most of the invertebrata show very few signs of it

Im not so sure said Sir Richmond Ive never seen a snail in a
towering passion or an oyster slamming its shell behind it But these
are sluggish things Oysters sulk which is after all a smouldering sort
of rage And take any more active invertebrate Take a spider Not
a smashing and swearing sort of rage perhaps but a disciplined
coldblooded malignity Crabs fight A conger eel in a boat will rage
dangerously

A vertebrate Yes But even among the vertebrata who has ever seen a
furious rabbit

Dont the bucks fight questioned Sir Richmond

Dr Martineau admitted the point

Ive always had these fits of passion As far back as I can remember
I was a kicking screaming child I threw things I once threw a fork
at my elder brother and it stuck in his forehead doing no serious
damagehappily There were whole days of wrathdays as I remember
them Perhaps they were only hours Ive never thought before what
a peculiar thing all this raging is in the world WHY do we rage They
used to say it was the devil If it isnt the devil then what the devil
is it After all he went on as the doctor was about to answer his
question as you pointed out it isnt the lowlier things that rage
Its the HIGHER things and US

The devil nowadays the doctor reflected after a pause so far as
man is concerned is understood to be the ancestral ape And more
particularly the old male ape

But Sir Richmond was away on another line of thought Life itself
flaring out Brooking no contradiction He came round suddenly to the
doctors qualification Why male Dont little girls smash things just
as much

They dont said Dr Martineau Not nearly as much

Sir Richmond went off at a tangent again I suppose you have watched
any number of babies

Not nearly as many as a general practitioner would do Theres a lot of
rage about most of them at first male or female

Queer little eddies of fury Recentlyit happensIve been seeing
one A spit of red wrath clenching its fists and squalling threats at a
damned disobedient universe

The doctor was struck by an idea and glanced quickly and questioningly
at his companions profile

Blind driving force said Sir Richmond musing

Isnt that after all what we really are he asked the doctor
EssentiallyRage A rage in dead matter making it alive

Schopenhauer footnoted the doctor Boehme

Plain fact said Sir Richmond No Rageno Go

But rage without discipline

Discipline afterwards The rage first

But rage against what And FOR what

Against the Universe And for Thats more difficult What IS the
little beast squalling itself crimson for Ultimately  What is it
clutching after In the long run what will it get

Yours the car in distress what sent this asked an unheeded voice

Of course if you were to say desire said Dr Martineau then you
would be in line with the psychoanalysts They talk of LIBIDO meaning
a sort of fundamental desire Jung speaks of it at times almost as if it
were the universal driving force

No said Sir Richmond in love with his new idea Not desire Desire
would have a definite direction and that is just what this driving
force hasnt Its rage

Yours the car in distress what sent this the voice repeated It was
the voice of a mechanic in an Overland car He was holding up the blue
request for assistance that Sir Richmond had recently filled in

The two philosophers returned to practical matters

Section 3

For half an hour after the departure of the little Charmeuse car with
Sir Richmond and Dr Martineau the brass Mercury lay unheeded in the
dusty roadside grass Then it caught the eye of a passing child

He was a bright little boy of five From the moment when he caught the
gleam of brass he knew that he had made the find of his life But his
nurse was a timorous foolish thing You did ought to of left it there
Masterrarry she said

Findings aint keepings nowadays not by no manner of means
Masterrarry

Yewd look silly if a policeman came along arsting people if they seen
a goldennimage

Arst yer ow you come by it and look pretty straight at you

All of which grumblings Master Harry treated with an experienced
disregard He knew definitely that he would never relinquish this bright
and lovely possession again It was the first beautiful thing he had
ever possessed He was the darling of fond and indulgent parents and his
nursery was crowded with hideous rag and sawdust dolls golliwogs comic
penguins comic lions comic elephants and comic policemen and every
variety of suchlike humorous idiocy and visual beastliness This figure
solid delicate and gracious was a thing of a different order

There was to be much conflict and distress tears and wrath before
the affinity of that cleanlimbed shining figure and his small soul was
recognized But he carried his point at last The Mercury became his
inseparable darling his symbol his private god the one dignified
and serious thing in a little life much congested by the quaint the
burlesque and all the smiling dull condescensions of adult love




CHAPTER THE FOURTH

AT MAIDENHEAD

Section 1

The little Charmeuse was towed to hospital and the two psychiatrists
took up their quarters at the Radiant Hotel with its pleasant lawns and
graceful landing stage at the bend towards the bridge Sir Richmond
after some trying work at the telephone got into touch with his own
proper car A man would bring the car down in two days time at latest
and afterwards the detested coupe could go back to London The day was
still young and after lunch and coffee upon a sunny lawn a boat seemed
indicated Sir Richmond astonished the doctor by going to his room
reappearing dressed in tennis flannels and looking very well in them It
occurred to the doctor as a thing hitherto unnoted that Sir Richmond was
not indifferent to his personal appearance The doctor had no flannels
but he had brought a brown holland umbrella lined with green that he had
acquired long ago in Algiers and this served to give him something of
the riverside quality

The day was full of sunshine and the river had a Maytime animation Pink
geraniums vivid green lawns gay awnings bright glass white paint and
shining metal set the tone of Maidenhead life At lunch there had been
five or six small tables with quietly affectionate couples who talked in
undertones a tableful of brightcoloured Jews who talked in overtones
and a family party from the Midlands badly smitten with shyness who
did not talk at all A resort of honeymoon couples said the doctor
and then rather knowingly Temporary honeymoons I fancy in one or two
of the cases

Decidedly temporary said Sir Richmond considering the companyin
most of the cases anyhow The two in the corner might be married You
never know nowadays

He became reflective

After lunch and coffee he rowed the doctor up the river towards
Cliveden

The last time I was here he said returning to the subject I was
here on a temporary honeymoon

The doctor tried to look as though he had not thought that could be
possible

I know my Maidenhead fairly well said Sir Richmond Aquatic
activities such as rowing punting messing about with a boathook
tying up buzzing about in motor launches fouling other peoples boats
are merely the stage business of the drama The ruling interests of this
place are lovelargely illicitand persistent drinking Dont you
think the bridge charming from here

I shouldnt have thoughtdrinking said Dr Martineau after he had
done justice to the bridge over his shoulder

Yes the place has a floating population of quiet industrious soakers
The incurable river man and the river girl end at that

Dr Martineau encouraged Sir Richmond by an appreciative silence

If we are to explore the secret places of the heart Sir Richmond went
on we shall have to give some attention to this Maidenhead side of
life It is very material to my case I haveas I have saidBEEN
HERE This place has beauty and charm these piledup woods behind which
my Lords Astor and Desborough keep their state this shining mirror
of the water brown and green and sky blue this fringe of reeds and
scented rushes and forgetmenot and lilies and these perpetually
posing white swans they make a picture A little artificial it is true
one feels the presence of a Conservancy Board planting the rushes and
industriously nicking the swans but none the less delightful And this
setting has appealed to a number of people as an invitation as in a
way a promise They come here responsive to that promise of beauty
and happiness They conceive of themselves here rowing swiftly and
gracefully punting beautifully brandishing boathooks with ease and
charm They look to meet under pleasant or romantic circumstances
other possessors and worshippers of grace and beauty here There will
be glowing evenings warm moonlight distant voices singingThere is
your desire doctor the desire you say is the driving force of life
But reality mocks it Boats bump and lead to coarse ungracious
quarrels rowing can be curiously fatiguing punting involves dreadful
indignities The romance here tarnishes very quickly Romantic
encounters fail to occur in our impatience we resort toaccosting
Chilly mists arise from the water and the magic of distant singing
is provided even excessively by boatloads of cadswith collecting
dishes When the weather keeps warm there presently arises an
extraordinary multitude of gnats and when it does not there is a need
for stimulants That is why the dreamers who come here first for a light
delicious brush with love come down at last to the Thamesside barmaid
with her array of spirits and cordials as the quintessence of all
desire

I say said the doctor You tear the place to pieces

The desires of the place said Sir Richmond

Im using the place as a symbol

He held his sculls awash rippling in the water

The real force of life the rage of life isnt here he said Its
down underneath sulking and smouldering Every now and then it strains
and cracks the surface This stretch of the Thames this pleasure
stretch has in fact a curiously quarrelsome atmosphere People scold
and insult one another for the most trivial things for passing too
close for taking the wrong side for tying up or floating loose Most
of these notice boards on the bank show a thoroughly nasty spirit
People on the banks jeer at anyone in the boats You hear people
quarrelling in boats in the hotels as they walk along the towing path
There is remarkably little happy laughter here The RAGE you see is
hostile to this place the RAGE breaks through The people who
drift from one pub to another drinking the people who fuddle in the
riverside hotels are the last fugitives of pleasure trying to forget
the rage

Isnt it that there is some greater desire at the back of the human
mind the doctor suggested Which refuses to be content with pleasure
as an end

What greater desire asked Sir Richmond disconcertingly

Oh The doctor cast about

There is no such greater desire said Sir Richmond You cannot name
it It is just blind drive I admit its discontent with pleasure as an
endbut has it any end of its own At the most you can say that the
rage in life is seeking its desire and hasnt found it

Let us help in the search said the doctor with an afternoon smile
under his green umbrella Go on

Section 2

Since our first talk in Harley Street said Sir Richmond I have been
trying myself over in my mind We can drift down this backwater

Big these trees are said the doctor with infinite approval

I am astonished to discover what a bundle of discordant motives I am
I do not seem to deserve to be called a personality I cannot discover
even a general direction Much more am I like a taxicab in which all
sorts of aims and desires have travelled to their destination and got
out Are we all like that

A bundle held together by a name and address and a certain thread of
memory said the doctor and considered More than that More than
that We have leading ideas associations possessions liabilities

We build ourselves a prison of circumstances that keeps us from
complete dispersal

Exactly said the doctor And there is also something a consistency
that we call character

It changes

Consistently with itself

I have been trying to recall my sexual history said Sir Richmond
going off at a tangent My sentimental education I wonder if it
differs very widely from yours or most mens

Some men are more eventful in these matters than others said the
doctorit soundedwistfully

They have the same jumble of motives and traditions I suspect whether
they are eventful or not The brakes may be strong or weak but the drive
is the same I cant remember much of the beginnings of curiosity and
knowledge in these matters Can you

Not much said the doctor No

Your psychoanalysts tell a story of fears suppressions monstrous
imaginations symbolic replacements I dont remember much of that sort
of thing in my own case It may have faded out of my mind There were
probably some uneasy curiosities a grotesque dream or so perhaps I
cant recall anything of that sort distinctly now I had a very lively
interest in women even when I was still quite a little boy and a
certainwhat shall I call itimaginative slavishnessnot towards
actual women but towards something magnificently feminine My first
love

Sir Richmond smiled at some secret memory My first love was Britannia
as depicted by Tenniel in the cartoons in PUNCH I must have been a very
little chap at the time of the Britannia affair I just clung to her in
my imagination and did devoted things for her Then I recall a little
later a secret abject adoration for the white goddesses of the Crystal
Palace Not for any particular one of them that I can rememberfor all
of them But I dont remember anything very monstrous or incestuous
in my childish imaginationssuch things as Freud I understand lays
stress upon If there was an Oedipus complex or anything of that sort
in my case it has been very completely washed out again Perhaps a child
which is brought up in a proper nursery of its own and sees a lot of
pictures of the nude human body and so on gets its mind shifted off
any possible concentration upon the domestic aspect of sex I got to
definite knowledge pretty early By the time I was eleven or twelve

Normally

What is normally Decently anyhow Here again I may be forgetting much
secret and shameful curiosity I got my ideas into definite form out of
a little straightforward physiological teaching and some dissecting of
rats and mice My schoolmaster was a capable sane man in advance of
his times and my people believed in him I think much of this distorted
perverse stuff that grows up in peoples minds about sex and develops
into evil vices and still more evil habits is due to the mystery we
make about these things

Not entirely said the doctor

Largely What child under a modern upbringing ever goes through the
stuffy horrors described in James Joyces PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A
YOUNG MAN

Ive not read it

A picture of the Catholic atmosphere a young soul shut up in darkness
and ignorance to accumulate filth In the name of purity and decency and
under threats of hell fire

Horrible

Quite A study of intolerable tensions the tensions that make young
people write unclean words in secret places

Yes we certainly ventilate and sanitate in those matters nowadays
Where nothing is concealed nothing can explode

On the whole I came up to adolescence pretty straight and clean said
Sir Richmond What stands out in my memory now is this idea of a
sort of woman goddess who was very lovely and kind and powerful and
wonderful That ruled my secret imaginations as a boy but it was very
much in my mind as I grew up

The mother complex said Dr Martineau as a passing botanist might
recognize and name a flower

Sir Richmond stared at him for a moment

It had not the slightest connexion with my mother or any mother or any
particular woman at all Far better to call it the goddess complex

The connexion is not perhaps immediately visible said the doctor

There was no connexion said Sir Richmond The women of my adolescent
dreams were stripped and strong and lovely They were great creatures
They came it was clearly traceable from pictures sculptureand from
a definite response in myself to their beauty My mother had nothing
whatever to do with that The women and girls about me were fussy
bunches of clothes that I am sure I never even linked with that dream
world of love and worship

Were you coeducated

No But I had a couple of sisters one older one younger than myself
and there were plenty of girls in my circle I thought some of them
prettybut that was a different affair I know that I didnt connect
them with the idea of the loved and worshipped goddesses at all because
I remember when I first saw the goddess in a real human being and how
amazed I was at the discovery I was a boy of twelve or thirteen My
people took me one summer to Dymchurch in Romney Marsh in those days
before the automobile had made the Marsh accessible to the Hythe and
Folkestone crowds it was a little old forgotten silent windbitten
village crouching under the lee of the great sea wall At low water
there were miles of sand as smooth and shining as the skin of a savage
brown woman Shining and with a texturethe very same And one day as I
was mucking about by myself on the beach boy fashionthere were some
ribs of a wrecked boat buried in the sand near a groin and I was busy
with thema girl ran out from a tent high up on the beach and across
the sands to the water She was dressed in a tight bathing dress and
not in the clumsy skirts and frills that it was the custom to inflict
on women in those days Her hair was tied up in a blue handkerchief She
ran swiftly and gracefully intent upon the white line of foam ahead I
can still remember how the sunlight touched her round neck and cheek as
she went past me She was the loveliest most shapely thing I have
ever seento this day She lifted up her arms and thrust through the
dazzling white and green breakers and plunged into the water and swam
she swam straight out for a long way as it seemed to me and presently
came in and passed me again on her way back to her tent light and
swift and sure The very prints of her feet on the sand were beautiful
Suddenly I realized that there could be living people in the world as
lovely as any goddess She wasnt in the least out of breath

That was my first human love And I love that girl still I doubt
sometimes whether I have ever loved anyone else I kept the thing very
secret I wonder now why I have kept the thing so secret Until now I
have never told a soul about it I resorted to all sorts of tortuous
devices and excuses to get a chance of seeing her again without
betraying what it was I was after

Dr Martineau retained a simple fondness for a story

And did you meet her again

Never Of course I may have seen her as a dressedup person and not
recognized her A day or so later I was stabbed to the heart by the
discovery that the tent she came out of had been taken away

She had gone

For ever

Sir Richmond smiled brightly at the doctors disappointment

Section 3

I was never wholehearted and simple about sexual things Sir Richmond
resumed presently Never I do not think any man is We are too
much plasteredup things too much the creatures of a tortuous and
complicated evolution

Dr Martineau under his green umbrella nodded his conceded agreement

Thiswhat shall I call itthis Dream of Women grew up in my mind as
I grew upas something independent of and much more important than the
reality of Women It came only very slowly into relation with that That
girl on the Dymchurch beach was one of the first links but she ceased
very speedily to be realshe joined the women of dreamland at last
altogether She became a sort of legendary incarnation I thought of
these dream women not only as something beautiful but as something
exceedingly kind and helpful The girls and women I met belonged to a
different creation

Sir Richmond stopped abruptly and rowed a few long strokes

Dr Martineau sought information

I suppose he said there was a sensuous element in these dreamings

Certainly A very strong one It didnt dominate but it was a very
powerful undertow

Was there any tendency in all this imaginative stuff to concentrate
To group itself about a single figure the sort of thing that Victorians
would have called an ideal

Not a bit of it said Sir Richmond with conviction There was always
a tremendous lot of variety in my mind In fact the thing I liked least
in the real world was the way it was obsessed by the idea of pairing off
with one particular set and final person I liked to dream of a blonde
goddess in her own Venusberg one day and the next I would be off over
the mountains with an armed Brunhild

You had little thought of children

As a young man

Yes

None at all I cannot recall a single philoprogenitive moment These
dream women were all conceived of and I was conceived of as being
concerned in some tremendous enterprisesomething quite beyond
domesticity It kept us relatedgave us dignity Certainly it wasnt
babies

All this is very interesting very interesting from the scientific
point of view A PRIORI it is not what one might have expected
Reasoning from the idea that all instincts and natural imaginations are
adapted to a biological end and seeing that sex is essentially a method
of procreation one might reasonably expect a convergence if not a
complete concentration upon the idea of offspring It is almost as
if there were other ends to be served It is clear that Nature has
not worked this impulse out to any sight of its end Has not perhaps
troubled to do so The instinct of the male for the female isnt
primarily for offspringnot even in the most intelligent and farseeing
types The desire just points to glowing satisfactions and illusions
Quite equally I think the desire of the female for the male ignores its
end Nature has set about this business in a CHEAP sort of way She is
like some pushful advertising tradesman She isnt frank with us she
just humbugs us into what she wants with us All very well in the early
Stone Agewhen the poor dear things never realized that their mutual
endearments meant all the troubles and responsibilities of parentage
But NOW

He shook his head sideways and twirled the green umbrella like an
animated halo around his large broadminded face

Sir Richmond considered Desire has never been the chief incentive of
my relations with women Never So far as I can analyze the thing it
has been a craving for a particular sort of life giving companionship

That I take it is Natures device to keep the lovers together in the
interest of the more or less unpremeditated offspring

A poor device if that is its end It doesnt keep parents together
more often it tears them apart The wife or the mistress so soon as
she is encumbered with children becomes all too manifestly not the
companion goddess

Sir Richmond brooded over his sculls and thought

Throughout my life I have been an exceedingly busy man I have done a
lot of scientific work and some of it has been very good work And
very laborious work Ive travelled much Ive organized great business
developments You might think that my time has been fairly well
filled without much philandering And all the time all the time Ive
beenabout womenlike a thirsty beast looking for water Always
Always All through my life

Dr Martineau waited through another silence

I was very grave about it at first I married young I married very
simply and purely I was not one of those young men who sow a large crop
of wild oats I was a fairly decent youth It suddenly appeared to me
that a certain smiling and dainty girl could make herself into all the
goddesses of my dreams I had but to win her and this miracle would
occur Of course I forget now the exact things I thought and felt then
but surely I had some such persuasion Or why should I have married her
My wife was seven years younger than myselfa girl of twenty She
was charming She is charming She is a wonderfully intelligent and
understanding woman She has made a home for mea delightful home I am
one of those men who have no instinct for home making I owe my home and
all the comfort and dignity of my life to her ability I have no excuse
for any misbehaviourso far as she is concerned None at all By
all the rules I should have been completely happy But instead of my
marriage satisfying me it presently released a storm of longcontrolled
desires and imprisoned cravings A voice within me became more and more
urgent This will not do This is not love Where are your goddesses
This is not love And I was unfaithful to my wife within four years
of my marriage It was a sudden overpowering impulse But I suppose the
ground had been preparing for a long time I forget now all the emotions
of that adventure I suppose at the time it seemed beautiful and
wonderful I do not excuse myself Still less do I condemn myself I
put the facts before you So it was

There were no children by your marriage

Your line of thought doctor is too philoprogenitive We have had
three My daughter was married two years ago She is in America One
little boy died when he was three The other is in India taking up the
Mardipore power scheme again now that he is out of the army No it
is simply that I was hopelessly disappointed with everything that a
good woman and a decent marriage had to give me Pure disappointment and
vexation The anticlimax to an immense expectation built up throughout
an imaginative boyhood and youth and early manhood I was shocked
and ashamed at my own disappointment I thought it mean and base
Nevertheless this orderly household into which I had placed my life
these almost methodical connubialities

He broke off in midsentence

Dr Martineau shook his head disapprovingly

No he said it wasnt fair to your wife

It was shockingly unfair I have always realized that Ive done what
I could to make things up to her Heaven knows what counter
disappointments she has concealed But it is no good arguing about
rights and wrongs now This is not an apology for my life I am telling
you what happened

Not for me to judge said Dr Martineau Go on

By marrying I had got nothing that my soul craved for I had satisfied
none but the most transitory desires and I had incurred a tremendous
obligation That obligation didnt restrain me from making desperate
lunges at something vaguely beautiful that I felt was necessary to me
but it did cramp and limit these lunges So my story flops down into the
comedy of the lying cramped intrigues of a respectable married manI
was still driven by my dream of some extravagantly beautiful inspiration
called love and I sought it like an area sneak Gods What a story it
is when one brings it all together I couldnt believe that the glow and
sweetness I dreamt of were not in the worldsomewhere Hidden away
from me I seemed to catch glimpses of the dear lost thing now in the
corners of a smiling mouth now in dark eyes beneath a black smoke of
hair now in a slim form seen against the sky Often I cared nothing for
the woman I made love to I cared for the thing she seemed to be hiding
from me

Sir Richmonds voice altered

I dont see what possible good it can do to talk over these things He
began to row and rowed perhaps a score of strokes Then he stopped
and the boat drove on with a whisper of water at the bow and over the
outstretched oar blades

What a muddle and mockery the whole thing is he cried What a
fumbling old fool old Mother Nature has been She drives us into
indignity and dishonour and she doesnt even get the children which are
her only excuse for her mischief See what a fantastic thing I am when
you take the machine to pieces I have been a busy and responsible man
throughout my life I have handled complicated public and industrial
affairs not unsuccessfully and discharged quite big obligations fully
and faithfully And all the time hidden away from the public eye
my life has been laced by the thread of thesewhat can one call
themlove adventures How many you ask I dont know Never have I
been a wholehearted lover never have I been able to leave love
alone Never has love left me alone

And as I am made said Sir Richmond with sudden insistence AS I AM
MADEI do not believe that I could go on without these affairs I know
that you will be disposed to dispute that

Dr Martineau made a reassuring noise

These affairs are at once unsatisfying and vitally necessary It is
only latterly that I have begun to perceive this Women MAKE life
for me Whatever they touch or see or desire becomes worth while
and otherwise it is not worth while Whatever is lovely in my world
whatever is delightful has been so conveyed to me by some woman
Without the vision they give me I should be a hard dry industry in the
world a worker ant a soulless rage making much valuing nothing

He paused

You are I think abnormal considered the doctor

Not abnormal Excessive if you like Without women I am a wasting
fever of distressful toil Without them there is no kindness in
existence no rest no sort of satisfaction The world is a battlefield
trenches barbed wire rain mud logical necessity and utter
desolationwith nothing whatever worth fighting for Whatever justifies
effort whatever restores energy is hidden in women

An access of sex said Dr Martineau This is a phase

It is how I am made said Sir Richmond

A brief silence fell upon that Dr Martineau persisted It isnt how
you are made We are getting to something in all this It is I insist
a mood of how you are made A distinctive and indicative mood

Sir Richmond went on almost as if he soliloquized

I would go through it all again There are times when the love
of women seems the only real thing in the world to me And always it
remains the most real thing I do not know how far I may be a normal man
or how far I may not be so to speak abnormally male but to me life
has very little personal significance and no value or power until it
has a woman as intermediary Before life can talk to me and say anything
that matters a woman must be present as a medium I dont mean that it
has no significance mentally and logically I mean that irrationally and
emotionally it has no significance Works of art for example bore me
literature bores me scenery bores me even the beauty of a woman bores
me unless I find in it some association with a womans feeling It
isnt that I cant tell for myself that a picture is fine or a mountain
valley lovely but that it doesnt matter a rap to me whether it is or
whether it isnt until there is a feminine response a sexual motif if
you like to call it that coming in Whatever there is of loveliness
or pride in life doesnt LIVE for me until somehow a woman comes in and
breathes upon it the breath of life I cannot even rest until a woman
makes holiday for me Only one thing can I do without women and that is
work joylessly but effectively and latterly for some reason that it is
up to you to discover doctor even the power of work has gone from me

Section 4

This afternoon brings back to me very vividly my previous visit here
It was perhaps a dozen or fifteen years ago We rowed down this same
backwater I can see my companions handshe had very pretty hands with
rosy palmstrailing in the water and her shadowed face smiling quietly
under her sunshade with little faint streaks of sunlight reflected
from the ripples dancing and quivering across it She was one of those
people who seem always to be happy and to radiate happiness

By ordinary standards said Sir Richmond she was a thoroughly bad
lot She had about as much morality in the narrower sense of the word
as a monkey And yet she stands out in my mind as one of the most honest
women I have ever met She was certainly one of the kindest Part of
that effect of honesty may have been due to her open brow her candid
blue eyes the smiling frankness of her manner Butno She was
really honest

We drifted here as we are doing now She pulled at the sweet rushes
and crushed them in her hand She adds a remembered brightness to this
afternoon

Honest Friendly Of all the women I have known this woman who was
here with me came nearest to being my friend You know what we call
virtue in a woman is a tremendous handicap to any real friendliness with
a man Until she gets to an age when virtue and fidelity are no longer
urgent practical concerns a good woman by the very definition of
feminine goodness isnt truly herself Over a vast extent of her being
she is RESERVED She suppresses a vast amount of her being holds back
denies hides On the other hand there is a frankness and honesty in
openly bad women arising out of the admitted fact that they are bad
that they hide no treasure from you they have no peculiarly precious
and delicious secrets to keep and no poverty to conceal Intellectually
they seem to be more manly and vigorous because they are as people say
unsexed Many old women thoroughly respectable old women have the
same quality Because they have gone out of the personal sex business
Havent you found that

I have never said the doctor known what you call an openly bad
womanat least at all intimately

Sir Richmond looked with quick curiosity at his companion You have
avoided them

They dont attract me

They repel you

For me said the doctor for any friendliness a woman must be
modest My habits of thought are oldfashioned I suppose but
the mere suggestion about a woman that there were no barriers no
reservation that in any fashion she might more than meet me half
way

His facial expression completed his sentence

Now I wonder whispered Sir Richmond and hesitated for a moment
before he carried the great research into the explorers country
You are afraid of women he said with a smile to mitigate the
impertinence

I respect them

An element of fear

Well I am afraid of them then Put it that way if you like Anyhow I
do not let myself go with them I have never let myself go

You lose something You lose a reality of insight

There was a thoughtful interval

Having found so excellent a friend said the doctor why did you ever
part from her

Sir Richmond seemed indisposed to answer but Dr Martineaus
face remained slantingly interrogative He had found the effective
counterattack and he meant to press it I was jealous of her Sir
Richmond admitted I couldnt stand that side of it

Section 5

After a meditative silence the doctor became briskly professional again

You care for your wife he said You care very much for your wife
She is as you say your great obligation and you are a man to respect
obligations I grasp that Then you tell me of these women who have come
and gone About them too you are perfectly frank There remains
someone else Sir Richmond stared at his physician

Well he said and laughed I didnt pretend to have made my
autobiography anything more than a sketch

No but there is a special person the current person

I havent dilated on my present situation I admit

From some little things that have dropped from you I should say there
is a child

That said Sir Richmond after a brief pause is a good guess

Not older than three

Two years and a half

You and this lady who is I guess young are separated At any rate
you cant go to her That leaves you at loose ends because for some
time for two or three years at least you have ceased to behow
shall I put itan emotional wanderer

I begin to respect your psychoanalysis

Hence your overwhelming sense of the necessity of feminine
companionship for weary men I guess she is a very jolly companion to be
with amusing restfulinteresting

Hm said Sir Richmond I think that is a fair description When she
cares that is When she is in good form

Which she isnt at present hazarded the doctor He exploded a mine of
longpent exasperation

She is the clumsiest hand at keeping well that I have ever known
Health is a womans primary duty But she is incapable of the most
elementary precautions She is maddeningly receptive to every infection
At the present moment when I am ill when I am in urgent need of help
and happiness she has let that wretched child get measles and
she herself wont let me go near her because she has got something
disfiguring something nobody else could ever have or think of having
called CARBUNCLE Carbuncle

It is very painful said Dr Martineau No doubt it is said Sir
Richmond

No doubt it is His voice grew bitter He spoke with deliberation A
perfectly aimless useless illnessand as painful as it CAN be

He spoke as if he slammed a door viciously And indeed he had slammed
a door The doctor realized that for the present there was no more
selfdissection to be got from Sir Richmond

For some time Sir Richmond had been keeping the boat close up to the
foaming weir to the left of the lock by an occasional stroke Now with
a general air of departure he swung the boat round and began to row down
stream towards the bridge and the Radiant Hotel

Time we had tea he said

Section 6

After tea Dr Martineau left Sir Richmond in a chair upon the lawn
brooding darklyapparently over the crime of the carbuncle The doctor
went to his room ostensibly to write a couple of letters and put on
a dinner jacket but really to make a few notes of the afternoons
conversation and meditate over his impressions while they were fresh

His room proffered a comfortable armchair and into this he sank
A number of very discrepant things were busy in his mind He had
experienced a disconcerting personal attack There was a whirl of active
resentment in the confusion

Apologetics of a rake he tried presently

A common type stripped of his intellectual dressing Every third
manufacturer from the midlands or the north has some such undertow
of affairs A physiological uneasiness an imaginative laxity
the temptations of the trip to Londonweakness masquerading as a
psychological necessity The Lady of the Carbuncle seems to have got
rather a hold upon him She has kept him in order for three or four
years

The doctor scrutinized his own remarks with a judicious expression

I am not being fair He ruffled me Even if it is true as I said that
every third manufacturer from the midlands is in much the same case as
he is that does not dismiss the case It makes it a more important
one much more important it makes it a type case with the exceptional
quality of being selfexpressive Almost too selfexpressive

Sir Richmond does after all make out a sort of case for himself

A valid case

The doctor sat deep in his chair frowning judicially with the fingers
of one hand apposed to the fingers of the other He makes me bristle
because all his life and ideas challenge my way of living But if I
eliminate the personal element

He pulled a sheet of notepaper towards him and began to jot down notes
with a silvercased pencil Soon he discontinued writing and sat tapping
his pencilcase on the table The amazing selfishness of his attitude
I do not think that oncenot oncehas he judged any woman except as
a contributor to his energy and peace of mind Except in the case of
his wife

For her his habit of respect was formed before his ideas developed

That I think explains HER

What was his phrase about the unfortunate young woman with the
carbuncle Totally Useless and unnecessary illness was it

Now has a man any right by any standards to use women as this man has
used them

By any standards

The doctor frowned and nodded his head slowly with the corners of his
mouth drawn in

For some years now an intellectual reverie had been playing an
increasing part in the good doctors life He was writing this book of
his writing it very deliberately and laboriously THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A
NEW AGE but much more was he dreaming and thinking about this book
Its publication was to mark an epoch in human thought and human affairs
generally and create a considerable flutter of astonishment in the
doctors own little world It was to bring home to people some various
aspects of one very startling proposition that human society had
arrived at a phase when the complete restatement of its fundamental
ideas had become urgently necessary a phase when the slow inadequate
partial adjustments to two centuries of changing conditions had to give
place to a rapid reconstruction of new fundamental ideas And it was
a fact of great value in the drama of these secret dreams that the
directive force towards this fundamentally reconstructed world should be
the pen of an unassuming Harley Street physician hitherto not suspected
of any great excesses of enterprise

The written portions of this book were already in a highly polished
state They combined a limitless freedom of proposal with a smooth
urbanity of manner a tacit denial that the thoughts of one intelligent
being could possibly be shocking to another Upon this the doctor was
very insistent Conduct he held could never be sufficiently discreet
thought could never be sufficiently free As a citizen one had to treat
a law or an institution as a thing as rigidly right as a natural law
That the social wellbeing demands But as a scientific man in ones
stated thoughts and in public discussion the case was altogether
different There was no offence in any possible hypothesis or in the
contemplation of any possibility Just as when one played a game one was
bound to play in unquestioning obedience to the laws and spirit of the
game but if one was not playing that game then there was no reason why
one should not contemplate the completest reversal of all its methods
and the alteration and abandonment of every rule Correctness of
conduct the doctor held was an imperative concomitant of all really
free thinking Revolutionary speculation is one of those things that
must be divorced absolutely from revolutionary conduct It was to the
neglect of these obvious principles as the doctor considered them that
the general muddle in contemporary marital affairs was very largely due
We left divorcelaw revision to exposed adulterers and marriage reform
to hot adolescents and craving spinsters driven by the furies
within them to assertions that established nothing and to practical
demonstrations that only left everybody thoroughly uncomfortable Far
better to leave all these matters to calm patient men in easy chairs
weighing typical cases impartially ready to condone indisposed to
envy

In return for which restraint on the part of the eager and adventurous
the calm patient man was prepared in his thoughts to fly high and
go far Without giving any guarantee of course that he might not
ultimately return to the comfortable point of inaction from which he
started

In Sir Richmond Dr Martineau found the most interesting and
encouraging confirmation of the fundamental idea of THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A
NEW AGE the immediate need of new criteria of conduct altogether Here
was a man whose life was evidently ruled by standards that were at once
very high and very generous He was overworking himself to the pitch
of extreme distress and apparently he was doing this for ends that
were essentially unselfish Manifestly there were many things that an
ordinary industrial or political magnate would do that Sir Richmond
would not dream of doing and a number of things that such a man would
not feel called upon to do that he would regard as imperative duties
And mixed up with so much fine intention and fine conduct was this
disreputable streak of intrigue and this extraordinary claim that such
misconduct was necessary to continued vigour of action

To energy of thought it is not necessary said Dr Martineau and
considered for a time YetcertainlyI am not a man of action I
admit it I make few decisions

The chapters of THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A NEW AGE dealing with women were
still undrafted but they had already greatly exercised the doctors
mind He found now that the case of Sir Richmond had stirred his
imagination He sat with his hands apposed his head on one side and
an expression of great intellectual contentment on his face while these
emancipated ideas gave a sort of gala performance in his mind

The good doctor did not dislike women he had always guarded himself
very carefully against misogyny but he was very strongly disposed to
regard them as much less necessary in the existing scheme of things than
was generally assumed Women he conceded had laid the foundations of
social life Through their contrivances and sacrifices and patience the
fierce and lonely patriarchal familyherd of a male and his women
and off spring had grown into the clan and tribe the woven tissue of
related families that constitute the human comity had been woven by the
subtle persistent protection of sons and daughters by their mothers
against the intolerant jealous possessive Old Man But that was a
thing of the remote past Little was left of those ancient struggles
now but a few infantile dreams and nightmares The greater human
community human society was made for good And being made it had
taken over the ancient tasks of the woman one by one until now in its
modern forms it cherished more sedulously than she did it educated it
housed and comforted it clothed and served and nursed leaving the wife
privileged honoured protected for the sake of tasks she no longer did
and of a burthen she no longer bore Progress has TRIVIALIZED women
said the doctor and made a note of the word for later consideration

And woman has trivialized civilization the doctor tried

She has retained her effect of being central she still makes the
social atmosphere she raises mens instinctive hopes of help and
direction Except the doctor stipulated for a few highly developed
modern types most men found the sense of achieving her a necessary
condition for sustained exertion And there is no direction in her any
more

She spends said the doctor she just spends She spends excitingly
and competitively for her own pride and glory she drives all the energy
of men over the weirs of gain

What are we to do with the creature whispered the doctor

Apart from the procreative necessity was woman an unavoidable evil The
doctors untrammelled thoughts began to climb high spin nose dive and
loop the loop Nowadays we took a proper care of the young we had no
need for high birth rates quite a small proportion of women with a gift
in that direction could supply all the offspring that the world wanted
Given the power of determining sex that science was slowly winning
today and why should we have so many women about A drastic elimination
of the creatures would be quite practicable A fantastic world to a
vulgar imagination no doubt but to a calmly reasonable mind by no
means fantastic But this was where the case of Sir Richmond became
so interesting Was it really true that the companionship of women was
necessary to these energetic creative types Was it the fact that the
drive of life towards action as distinguished from contemplation arose
out of sex and needed to be refreshed by the reiteration of that motive
It was a plausible proposition it marched with all the doctors ideas
of natural selection and of the conditions of a survival that have made
us what we are It was in tune with the Freudian analyses

SEX NOT ONLY A RENEWAL OF LIFE IN THE SPECIES noted the doctors
silver pencil SEX MAY BE ALSO A RENEWAL OF ENERGY IN THE INDIVIDUAL

After some musing he crossed out sex and wrote above it sexual love

That is practically what he claims Dr Martineau said In which
case we want the completest revision of all our standards of sexual
obligation We want a new system of restrictions and imperatives
altogether

It was a fixed idea of the doctors that women were quite incapable of
producing ideas in the same way that men do but he believed that with
suitable encouragement they could be induced to respond quite generously
to such ideas Suppose therefore we really educated the imaginations of
women suppose we turned their indubitable capacity for service towards
social and political creativeness not in order to make them the rivals
of men in these fields but their moral and actual helpers A man of
this sort wants a mistressmother said the doctor He wants a sort of
woman who cares more for him and his work and honour than she does for
child or home or clothes or personal pride

But are there such women Can there be such a woman

His work needs to be very fine to deserve her help But admitting its
fineness

The alternative seems to be to teach the sexes to get along without
each other

A neutralized world A separated world How we should jostle in the
streets But the early Christians have tried it already The thing is
impossible

Very well then we have to make women more responsible again In a
new capacity We have to educate them far more seriously as sources of
energyas guardians and helpers of men And we have to suppress them
far more rigorously as tempters and dissipaters Instead of mothering
babies they have to mother the race

A vision of women made responsible floated before his eyes

Is that man working better since you got hold of him If not why not

Or againJane Smith was charged with neglecting her lover to the
common danger The inspector said the man was in a pitiful state
morally quite uncombed and infested with vulgar showy ideas

The doctor laughed telescoped his pencil and stood up

Section 7

It became evident after dinner that Sir Richmond also had been thinking
over the afternoons conversation

He and Dr Martineau sat in widearmed cane chairs on the lawn with a
wickerwork table bearing coffee cups and little glasses between them A
few other diners chatted and whispered about similar tables but not too
close to our talkers to disturb them the dining room behind them had
cleared its tables and depressed its illumination The moon in its
first quarter hung above the sunset sank after twilight shone
brighter and brighter among the western trees and presently had gone
leaving the sky to an increasing multitude of stars The Maidenhead
river wearing its dusky blue draperies and its jewels of light had
recovered all the magic Sir Richmond had stripped from it in the
afternoon The grave arches of the bridge made complete circles by the
reflexion of the water sustained as if by some unifying and justifying
reason the erratic flat flashes and streaks and glares of traffic that
fretted to and fro overhead A voice sang intermittently and a banjo
tinkled but remotely enough to be indistinct and agreeable

After all Sir Richmond began abruptly the search for some sort of
sexual modus vivendi is only a means to an end One does not want to
live for sex but only through sex The main thing in my life has always
been my work This afternoon under the Maidenhead influence I talked
too much of sex I babbled Of things one doesnt usually

It was very illuminating said the doctor

No doubt But a temporary phase It is the defective bearing talks
Just nowI happen to be irritated

The darkness concealed a faint smile on the doctors face

The work is the thing said Sir Richmond So long as one can keep
ones grip on it

What said the doctor after a pause leaning back and sending wreaths
of smoke up towards the stardusted zenith what is your idea of your
work I mean how do you see it in relation to yourselfand things
generally

Put in the most general terms

Put in the most general terms

I wonder if I can put it in general terms for you at all It is hard to
put something one is always thinking about in general terms or to think
of it as a whole Now Fuel

I suppose it was my fathers business interests that pushed me towards
specialization in fuel He wanted me to have a thoroughly scientific
training in days when a scientific training was less easy to get for a
boy than it is today And much more inspiring when you got it My mind
was framed so to speak in geology and astronomical physics I grew up
to think on that scale Just as a man who has been trained in history
and law grows to think on the scale of the Roman empire I dont know
what your pocket map of the universe is the map I mean by which you
judge all sorts of other general ideas To me this planet is a little
ball of oxides and nickel steel life a sort of tarnish on its surface
And we the minutest particles in that tarnish Who can nevertheless in
some unaccountable way take in the idea of this universe as one whole
who begin to dream of taking control of it

That is not a bad statement of the scientific point of view I
suppose I have much the same general idea of the world On rather more
psychological lines

We think I suppose said Sir Richmond of life as something that is
only just beginning to be aware of what it isand what it might be

Exactly said the doctor Good

He went on eagerly That is precisely how I see it You and I are just
particles in the tarnish as you call it who are becoming dimly awake
to what we are to what we have in common Only a very few of us have
got as far even as this These others here for example

He indicated the rest of Maidenhead by a movement

Desire mutual flattery egotistical dreams greedy solicitudes fill
them up They havent begun to get out of themselves

We I suppose have doubted Sir Richmond

We have

The doctor had no doubt He lay back in his chair with his hands behind
his head and his smoke ascending vertically to heaven With the greatest
contentment he began quoting himself This getting out of ones
individualitythis conscious getting out of ones individualityis one
of the most important and interesting aspects of the psychology of
the new age that is now dawning As compared with any previous age
Unconsciously of course every true artist every philosopher every
scientific investigator so far as his art or thought went has always
got out of himselfhas forgotten his personal interests and become Man
thinking for the whole race And intimations of the same thing have been
at the heart of most religions But now people are beginning to get
this detachment without any distinctively religious feeling or any
distinctive aesthetic or intellectual impulse as if it were a plain
matter of fact Plain matter of fact that we are only incidentally
ourselves That really each one of us is also the whole species is
really indeed all life

A part of it

An integral partas sight is part of a man with no absolute
separation from all the restno more than a separation of the
imagination The whole so far as his distinctive quality goes I do not
know how this takes shape in your mind Sir Richmond but to me this
idea of actually being life itself upon the world a special phase of it
dependent upon and connected with all other phases and of being one
of a small but growing number of people who apprehend that and want to
live in the spirit of that is quite central It is my fundamental idea
Wethis small but growing minorityconstitute that part of life which
knows and wills and tries to rule its destiny This new realization the
new psychology arising out of it is a fact of supreme importance in the
history of life It is like the appearance of selfconsciousness in some
creature that has not hitherto had selfconsciousness And so far as we
are concerned we are the true kingship of the world Necessarily We
who know are the true kingI wonder how this appeals to you It
is stuff I have thought out very slowly and carefully and written and
approved It is the very core of my life And yet when one comes
to say these things to someone else face to face It is much more
difficult to say than to write

Sir Richmond noted how the doctors chair creaked as he rolled to and
fro with the uneasiness of these intimate utterances

I agree said Sir Richmond presently One DOES think in this fashion
Something in this fashion What one calls ones work does belong to
something much bigger than ourselves

Something much bigger he expanded

Which something we become the doctor urged in so far as our work
takes hold of us

Sir Richmond made no answer to this for a little while Of course we
trail a certain egotism into our work he said

Could we do otherwise But it has ceased to be purely egotism It is
no longer I am I but I am part One wants to be an honourable
part

You think of man upon his planet the doctor pursued I think of
life rather as a mind that tries itself over in millions and millions of
trials But it works out to the same thing

I think in terms of fuel said Sir Richmond

He was still debating the doctors generalization I suppose it would
be true to say that I think of myself as mankind on his planet with
very considerable possibilities and with only a limited amount of fuel
at his disposal to achieve them Yes I agree that I think in that
way I have not thought much before of the way in which I think about
thingsbut I agree that it is in that way Whatever enterprises mankind
attempts are limited by the sum total of that store of fuel upon the
planet That is very much in my mind Besides that he has nothing but
his annual allowance of energy from the sun

I thought that presently we were to get unlimited energy from atoms
said the doctor

I dont believe in that as a thing immediately practicable No doubt
getting a supply of energy from atoms is a theoretical possibility
just as flying was in the time of Daedalus probably there were actual
attempts at some sort of glider in ancient Crete But before we get
to the actual utilization of atomic energy there will be ten thousand
difficult corners to turn we may have to wait three or four thousand
years for it We cannot count on it We havent it in hand There may be
some impasse All we have surely is coal and oilthere is no surplus
of wood nowonly an annual growth And waterpower is income also
doled out day by day We cannot anticipate it Coal and oil are our only
capital They are all we have for great important efforts They are a
gift to mankind to use to some supreme end or to waste in trivialities
Coal is the key to metallurgy and oil to transit When they are done
we shall either have built up such a fabric of apparatus knowledge and
social organization that we shall be able to manage without themor
we shall have travelled a long way down the slopes of waste towards
extinction Today in getting in distribution in use we
waste enormouslyAs we sit here all the world is wasting fuel
fantastically

Just as mentallyeducationally we waste the doctor interjected

And my job is to stop what I can of that waste to do what I can to
organize first of all sane fuel getting and then sane fuel using And
that second proposition carries us far Into the whole use we are making
of life

First things first said Sir Richmond If we set about getting fuel
sanely if we do it as the deliberate cooperative act of the whole
species then it follows that we shall look very closely into the use
that is being made of it When all the fuel getting is brought into one
view as a common interest then it follows that all the fuel burning
will be brought into one view At present we are getting fuel in a kind
of scramble with no general aim We waste and lose almost as much as we
get And of what we get the waste is idiotic

I wont trouble you said Sir Richmond with any long discourse on
the ways of getting fuel in this country But land as you know is owned
in patches and stretches that were determined in the first place chiefly
by agricultural necessities When it was divided up among its present
owners nobody was thinking about the minerals beneath But the lawyers
settled long ago that the landowner owned his land right down to the
centre of the earth So we have the superficial landlord as coal owner
trying to work his coal according to the superficial divisions quite
irrespective of the lie of the coal underneath Each man goes for the
coal under his own land in his own fashion You get three shafts where
one would suffice and none of them in the best possible place You get
the coal coming out of this point when it would be far more convenient
to bring it out at thatmiles away You get boundary walls of coal
between the estates abandoned left in the ground for ever And each
coal owner sells his coal in his own pettifogging manner But you
know of these things You know too how we trail the coal all over the
country spoiling it as we trail it until at last we get it into
the silly coal scuttles beside the silly wasteful airpoisoning
fogcreating fireplace

And this stuff said Sir Richmond bringing his hand down so smartly
on the table that the startled coffee cups cried out upon the tray was
given to men to give them power over metals to get knowledge with to
get more power with

The oil story I suppose is as bad

The oil story is worse

There is a sort of cant said Sir Richmond in a fierce parenthesis
that the supplies of oil are inexhaustiblethat you can muddle about
with oil anyhow Optimism of knaves and imbeciles They dont want
to be pulled up by any sane considerations

For some moments he kept silenceas if in unspeakable commination

Here I am with some clearness of visionmy only gift not very clever
with a natural bad temper and a strong sexual bias doing what I can
to get a broader handling of the fuel questionas a common interest
for all mankind And I find myself up against a lot of men subtle men
sharp men obstinate men prejudiced men able to get round me able to
get over me able to blockade me Clever menyes and all of them
ultimately damnedoh utterly damnedfools Coal owners who think only
of themselves solicitors who think backwards politicians who think
like a game of catscradle not a gleam of generosity not a gleam

What particularly are you working for asked the doctor

I want to get the whole business of the worlds fuel discussed and
reported upon as one affair so that some day it may be handled as one
affair in the general interest

The world did you say You meant the empire

No the world It is all one system now You cant work it in bits I
want to call in foreign representatives from the beginning

Advisoryconsultative

No With powers These things interlock now internationally both
through labour and finance The sooner we scrap this nonsense about an
autonomous British Empire complete in itself contra mundum the better
for us A world control is fifty years overdue Hence these disorders

Stillits rather a difficult proposition as things are

Oh Lord dont I know its difficult cried Sir Richmond in the tone
of one who swears Dont I know that perhaps its impossible But its
the only way to do it Therefore I say lets try to get it done And
everybody says difficult difficult and nobody lifts a finger to try
And the only real difficulty is that everybody for one reason or another
says that its difficult Its against human nature Granted Every
decent thing is Its socialism Who cares Along this line of
comprehensive scientific control the world has to go or it will
retrogress it will muddle and rot

I agree said Dr Martineau

So I want a report to admit that distinctly I want it to go
further than that I want to get the beginnings the germ of a world
administration I want to set up a permanent world commission of
scientific men and economistswith powers just as considerable powers
as I can give themtheyll be feeble powers at the bestbut still some
sort of SAY in the whole fuel supply of the world A saythat may grow
at last to a control A right to collect reports and receive
accounts for example to begin with And then the right to make
recommendations You see No the international part is not the
most difficult part of it But my beastly owners and their beastly
lawyers wont relinquish a scrap of what they call their freedom of
action And my labour men because Im a fairly big coal owner myself
sit and watch and suspect me too stupid to grasp what I am driving at
and too incompetent to get out a scheme of their own They want a world
control on scientific lines even less than the owners They try to think
that fuel production can carry an unlimited wages bill and the owners
try to think that it can pay unlimited profits and when I say This
business is something more than a scramble for profits and wages its a
service and a common interest they stare at me Sir Richmond was
at a loss for an image Like a committee in a thieves kitchen when
someone has casually mentioned the law

But will you ever get your Permanent Commission

It can be done If I can stick it out

But with the whole Committee against you

The curious thing is that the whole Committee isnt against me Every
individual is

Sir Richmond found it difficult to express The psychology of my
Committee ought to interest you It is probably a fair sample of the
way all sorts of things are going nowadays Its curious There is
not a man on that Committee who is quite comfortable within himself
about the particular individual end he is there to serve Its there I
get them They pursue their own ends bitterly and obstinately I admit
but they are bitter and obstinate because they pursue them against an
internal oppositionwhich is on my side They are terrified to think
if once they stopped fighting me how far they might not have to go with
me

A suppressed world conscience in fact This marches very closely with
my own ideas

A world conscience World conscience I dont know But I do know that
there is this drive in nearly every member of the Committee some drive
anyhow towards the decent thing It is the same drive that drives me
But I am the most driven It has turned me round It hasnt turned them
I go East and they go West And they dont want to be turned round
Tremendously they dont

Creative undertow said Dr Martineau making notes as it were
An increasing force in modern life In the psychology of a new age
strengthened by educationit may play a directive part

They fight every little point But you see because of this creative
undertowif you like to call it thatwe do get along I am leader or
whipperin it is hard to say which of a bolting flockI believe
they will report for a permanent world commission I believe I have got
them up to that but they will want to make it a bureau of this League
of Nations and I have the profoundest distrust of this League of
Nations It may turn out to be a sort of sidetracking arrangement for
all sorts of important world issues And they will find they have to
report for some sort of control But there again they will shy They
will report for it and then they will do their utmost to whittle it down
again They will refuse it the most reasonable powers They will alter
the composition of the Committee so as to make it innocuous

How

Get rid of the independent scientific men load it up so far as Britain
is concerned with muck of the colonial politician type and tame labour
representatives balance with shady new adventurer millionaires get in
still shadier stuff from abroad let these gentry appoint their own tame
experts after their own heartsexperts who will make merely advisory
reports which will not be published

They want in fact to keep the old system going under the cloak of YOUR
Committee reduced to a cloak and nothing more

That is what it amounts to They want to have the air of doing
rightindeed they do want to have the FEEL of doing rightand still
leave things just exactly what they were before And as I suffer under
the misfortune of seeing the thing rather more clearly I have to
shepherd the conscience of the whole Committee But there is a
conscience there If I can hold out myself I can hold the Committee

He turned appealingly to the doctor Why should I have to be the
conscience of that damned Committee Why should I do this exhausting
inhuman job In their hearts these others know Only they wont
know Why should it fall on me

You have to go through with it said Dr Martineau

I have to go through with it but its a hell of utterly inglorious
squabbling They bait me They have been fighting the same fight within
themselves that they fight with me They know exactly where I am that I
too am doing my job against internal friction The one thing before all
others that they want to do is to bring me down off my moral high
horse And I loathe the high horse I am in a position of special moral
superiority to men who are on the whole as good men as I am or better
That shows all the time You see the sort of man I am Ive a broad
streak of personal vanity I fag easily Im shorttempered Ive other
things as you perceive When I fag I become obtuse I repeat and bore
I get viciously illtempered I suffer from an intolerable sense of
ill usage Then that ass Wagstaffe who ought to be working with me
steadily sees his chance to be pleasantly witty He gets a laugh round
the table at my expense Young Dent the more intelligent of the labour
men reads me a lecture in committee manners Old Cassidy sees HIS
opening and jabs some ridiculous petty accusation at me and gets me
spluttering selfdefence like a fool All my stock goes down and as my
stock goes down the chances of a good report dwindle Young Dent grieves
to see me injuring my own case Too damned a fool to see what will
happen to the report You see if only they can convince themselves I am
just a prig and an egotist and an impractical bore they escape from a
great deal more than my poor propositions They escape from the doubt
in themselves By dismissing me they dismiss their own consciences
And then they can scamper off and be sensible little piggywigs and not
bother any more about what is to happen to mankind in the long run
Do you begin to realize the sort of fight upside down in a dustbin
that that Committee is for me

You have to go through with it Dr Martineau repeated

I have If I can But I warn you I have been near breaking point And
if I tumble off the high horse if I cant keep going regularly there
to ride the moral high horse that Committee will slump into utter
scoundrelism It will turn out a long inconsistent botched unreadable
report that will back up all sorts of humbugging bargains and sham
settlements It will contain some halfbaked scheme to pacify the miners
at the expense of the general welfare It wont even succeed in doing
that But in the general confusion old Cassidy will get away with
a series of hauls that may run into millions Which will last his
timedamn him And that is where we are Oh I know I know I
must do this job I dont need any telling that my life will be nothing
and mean nothing unless I bring this thing through

But the thanklessness of playing this lone hand

The doctor watched his friends resentful black silhouette against the
lights on the steely river and said nothing for awhile

Why did I ever undertake to play it Sir Richmond appealed Why has
it been put upon me Seeing what a poor thing I am why am I not a poor
thing altogether

Section 8

I think I understand that loneliness of yours said the doctor after an
interval

I am INTOLERABLE to myself

And I think it explains why it is that you turn to women as you do You
want help you want reassurance And you feel they can give it

I wonder if it has been quite like that Sir Richmond reflected

By an effort Dr Martineau refrained from mentioning the mother complex
You want help and reassurance as a child does he said Women and
women alone seem capable of giving that of telling you that you are
surely right that notwithstanding your blunders you are right that
even when you are wrong it doesnt so much matter you are still in
spirit right They can show their belief in you as no man can With all
their being they can do that

Yes I suppose they could

They can You have said already that women are necessary to make things
real for you

Not my work said Sir Richmond I admit that it might be like that
but it isnt like that It has not worked out like that The two drives
go on side by side in me They have no logical connexion All I can say
is that for me with my bifid temperament one makes a rest from the
other and is so far refreshment and a renewal of energy But I do not
find women coming into my work in any effectual way

The doctor reflected further I suppose he began and stopped short

He heard Sir Richmond move in his chair creaking an interrogation

You have never said the doctor turned to the idea of God

Sir Richmond grunted and made no other answer for the better part of a
minute

As Dr Martineau waited for his companion to speak a falling star
streaked the deep blue above them

I cant believe in a God said Sir Richmond

Something after the fashion of a God said the doctor insidiously

No said Sir Richmond Nothing that reassures

But this loneliness this craving for companionship

We have all been through that said Sir Richmond We have all in our
time lain very still in the darkness with our souls crying out for the
fellowship of God demanding some sign some personal response The
faintest feeling of assurance would have satisfied us

And there has never been a response

Have YOU ever had a response

Once I seemed to have a feeling of exaltation and security

Well

Perhaps I only persuaded myself that I had I had been reading
William James on religious experiences and I was thinking very much of
Conversion I tried to experience Conversion

Yes

It faded

It always fades said Sir Richmond with anger in his voice I wonder
how many people there are nowadays who have passed through this last
experience of ineffectual invocation this appeal to the fading shadow
of a vanished God In the night In utter loneliness Answer me Speak
to me Does he answer In the silence you hear the little blood vessels
whisper in your ears You see a faint glow of colour on the darkness

Dr Martineau sat without a word

I can believe that over all things Righteousness rules I can believe
that But Righteousness is not friendliness nor mercy nor comfort nor
any such dear and intimate things This cuddling up to Righteousness It
is a dream a delusion and a phase Ive tried all that long ago Ive
given it up long ago Ive grown out of it Men doafter forty Our
souls were made in the squattingplace of the submen of ancient times
They are made out of primitive needs and they die before our bodies as
those needs are satisfied Only young people have souls complete The
need for a personal God feared but reassuring is a youths need I no
longer fear the Old Man nor want to propitiate the Old Man nor believe
he matters any more Im a bit of an Old Man myself I discover Yes But
the other thing still remains

The Great Mother of the Gods said Dr Martineaustill clinging to
his theories

The need of the woman said Sir Richmond I want mating because it is
my nature to mate I want fellowship because I am a social animal and I
want it from another social animal Not from any Godany inconceivable
God Who fades and disappears No

Perhaps that other need will fade presently I do not know Perhaps it
lasts as long as life does How can I tell

He was silent for a little while Then his voice sounded in the night
as if he spoke to himself But as for the God of All Things consoling
and helping Imagine it That up therehaving fellowship with me I
would as soon think of cooling my throat with the Milky Way or shaking
hands with those stars




CHAPTER THE FIFTH

IN THE LAND OF THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLES


Section 1

A gust of confidence on the part of a person naturally or habitually
reserved will often be followed by a phase of recoil At breakfast
next morning their overnight talk seemed to both Sir Richmond and
Dr Martineau like something each had dreamt about the other a quite
impossible excess of intimacy They discussed the weather which seemed
to be settling down to the utmost serenity of which the English spring
is capable they talked of Sir Richmonds coming car and of the possible
routes before them Sir Richmond produced the Michelin maps which he
had taken out of the pockets of the little Charmeuse The Bath Road lay
before them he explained Reading Newbury Hungerford Marlborough
Silbury Hill which overhangs Avebury Both travellers discovered a
common excitement at the mention of Avebury and Silbury Hill Both took
an intelligent interest in archaeology Both had been greatly stimulated
by the recent work of Elliot Smith and Rivers upon what was then known
as the Heliolithic culture It had revived their interest in Avebury and
Stonehenge The doctor moreover had been reading Hippisley Coxs GREEN
ROADS OF ENGLAND

Neither gentleman had ever seen Avebury but Dr Martineau had once
visited Stonehenge

Avebury is much the oldest said the doctor They must have made
Silbury Hill long before 2000 BC It may be five thousand years old
or even more It is the most important historical relic in the British
Isles And the most neglected

They exchanged archaeological facts The secret places of the heart
rested until the afternoon

Then Sir Richmond saw fit to amplify his confessions in one particular

Section 2

The doctor and his patient had discovered a need for exercise as the
morning advanced They had walked by the road to Marlow and had lunched
at a riverside inn returning after a restful hour in an arbour on the
lawn of this place to tea at Maidenhead It was as they returned that
Sir Richmond took up the thread of their overnight conversation again

In the night he said I was thinking over the account I tried to
give you of my motives A lot of it was terribly out of drawing

Facts asked the doctor

No the facts were all right It was the atmosphere the
proportions I dont know if I gave you the effect of something Don
Juanesque

Vulgar poem said the doctor remarkably I discounted that

Vulgar

Intolerable Byron in sexual psychology is like a stink in a kitchen

Sir Richmond perceived he had struck upon the sort of thing that used to
be called a pet aversion

I dont want you to think that I run about after women in an habitual
and systematic manner Or that I deliberately hunt them in the interests
of my work and energy Your questions had set me theorizing about
myself And I did my best to improvise a scheme of motives yesterday
It was I perceive a jerrybuilt scheme run up at short notice My
nocturnal reflections convinced me of that I put reason into things
that are essentially instinctive The truth is that the wanderings of
desire have no single drive All sorts of motives come in high and low
down to sheer vulgar imitativeness and competitiveness What was true
in it all was this that a man with any imagination in a fatigue
phase falls naturally into these complications because they are more
attractive to his type and far easier and more refreshing to the mind
at the outset than anything else And they do work a sort of recovery
in him They send him back to his work refreshedso far that is as
his work is concerned

At the OUTSET they are easier said the doctor

Sir Richmond laughed When one is fagged it is only the outset counts
The more tired one is the more readily one moves along the line of least
resistance

That is one footnote to what I said So far as the motive of my work
goes I think we got something like the spirit of it What I said about
that was near the truth of things

But there is another set of motives altogether Sir Richmond went on
with an air of having cleared the ground for his real business that I
didnt go into at all yesterday

He considered It arises out of these other affairs Before you
realize it your affections are involved I am a man much swayed by my
affections

Mr Martineau glanced at him There was a note of genuine selfreproach
in Sir Richmonds voice

I get fond of people It is quite irrational but I get fond of them
Which is quite a different thing from the admiration and excitement of
falling in love Almost the opposite thing They cry or they come some
mental or physical cropper and hurt themselves or they do something
distressingly little and human and suddenly I find theyve GOT me Im
distressed Im filled with something between pity and an impulse of
responsibility I become tender towards them I am impelled to take care
of them I want to ease them off to reassure them to make them stop
hurting at any cost I dont see why it should be the weak and sickly
and seamy side of people that grips me most but it is I dont know why
it should be their failures that gives them power over me but it is I
told you of this girl this mistress of mine who is ill just now SHES
got me in that way shes got me tremendously

You did not speak of her yesterday with any morbid excess of pity the
doctor was constrained to remark

I abused her very probably I forget exactly what I said

The doctor offered no assistance

But the reason why I abuse her is perfectly plain I abuse her because
she distresses me by her misfortunes and instead of my getting anything
out of her I go out to her But I DO go out to her All this time at
the back of my mind I am worrying about her She has that gift of making
one feel for her I am feeling that damned carbuncle almost as if it had
been my affair instead of hers

That carbuncle has made me suffer FRIGHTFULLY Why should I It
isnt mine

He regarded the doctor earnestly The doctor controlled a strong desire
to laugh

I suppose the young lady he began

Oh SHE puts in suffering all right Ive no doubt about that

I suppose Sir Richmond went on now that I have told you so much
of this affair I may as well tell you all It is a sort of comedy a
painful comedy of irrelevant affections

The doctor was prepared to be a good listener Facts he would always
listen to it was only when people told him their theories that he would
interrupt with his Exactly

This young woman is a person of considerable genius I dont know if
you have seen in the illustrated papers a peculiar sort of humorous
illustrations usually with a considerable amount of bite in them over
the name of Martin Leeds

Extremely amusing stuff

It is that Martin Leeds I met her at the beginning of her career She
talks almost as well as she draws She amused me immensely Im not
the sort of man who waylays and besieges women and girls Im not the
pursuing type But I perceived that in some odd way I attracted her
and I was neither wise enough nor generous enough not to let the thing
develop

Hm said Dr Martineau

Id never had to do with an intellectually brilliant woman before I
see now that the more imaginative force a woman has the more likely she
is to get into a state of extreme selfabandonment with any male thing
upon which her imagination begins to crystallize Before I came along
shed mixed chiefly with a lot of young artists and students all doing
nothing at all except talk about the things they were going to do I
suppose I profited by the contrast being older and with my hands full
of affairs Perhaps something had happened that had made her recoil
towards my sort of thing I dont know But she just let herself go at
me

And you

Let myself go too Id never met anything like her before It was her
wit took me It didnt occur to me that she wasnt my contemporary
and as able as I was As able to take care of herself All sorts of
considerations that I should have shown to a sillier woman I never
dreamt of showing to her I had never met anyone so mentally brilliant
before or so helpless and headlong And so here we are on each others
hands

But the child

It happened to us For four years now things have just happened to us
All the time I have been overworking first at explosives and now at
this fuel business She too is full of her work

Nothing stops that though everything seems to interfere with it And
in a distraught preoccupied way we are abominably fond of each other
Fond is the word But we are both too busy to look after either
ourselves or each other

She is much more incapable than I am said Sir Richmond as if he
delivered a weighed and very important judgment

You see very much of each other

She has a flat in Chelsea and a little cottage in South Cornwall and
we sometimes snatch a few days together away somewhere in Surrey or up
the Thames or at such a place as Southend where one is lost in a crowd
of inconspicuous people Then things go wellthey usually go well at
the startwe are glorious companions She is happy she is creative
she will light up a new place with flashes of humour with a keenness of
appreciation

But things do not always go well

Things said Sir Richmond with the deliberation of a man who measures
his words are apt to go wrong At the flat there is constant
trouble with the servants they bully her A woman is more entangled
with servants than a man Women in that position seem to resent the work
and freedom of other women Her servants wont leave her in peace as
they would leave a man they make trouble for her And when we have
had a few days anywhere away even if nothing in particular has gone
wrong

Sir Richmond stopped short

When they go wrong it is generally her fault the doctor sounded

Almost always

But if they dont said the psychiatrist

It is difficult to describe The essential incompatibility of the
whole thing comes out

The doctor maintained his expression of intelligent interest

She wants to go on with her work She is able to work anywhere All she
wants is just cardboard and ink My mind on the other hand turns back to
the Fuel Commission

Then any little thing makes trouble

Any little thing makes trouble And we always drift round to the same
discussion whether we ought really to go on together

It is you begin that

Yes I start that You see she is perfectly contented when I am about
She is as fond of me as I am of her

Fonder perhaps

I dont know But she isadhesive Emotionally adhesive All she wants
to do is just to settle down when I am there and go on with her work
But then you see there is MY work

Exactly After all it seems to me that your great trouble is not
in yourselves but in social institutions Which havent yet fitted
themselves to people like you two It is the sense of uncertainty makes
her as you say adhesive Nervously so If we were indeed living in a
new age Instead of the moral ruins of a shattered one

We cant alter the age we live in said Sir Richmond a little testily

No Exactly But we CAN realize in any particular situation that it
is not the individuals to blame but the misfit of ideas and forms and
prejudices

No said Sir Richmond obstinately rejecting this pacifying
suggestion she could adapt herself If she cared enough

But how

She will not take the slightest trouble to adjust herself to the
peculiarities of our position She could be cleverer Other women are
cleverer Any other woman almost would be cleverer than she is

But if she was cleverer she wouldnt be the genius she is She would
just be any other woman

Perhaps she would said Sir Richmond darkly and desperately Perhaps
she would Perhaps it would be better if she was

Dr Martineau raised his eyebrows in a furtive aside

But here you see that it is that in my case the fundamental
incompatibility between ones affections and ones wider conception of
duty and work comes in We cannot change social institutions in a year
or a lifetime We can never change them to suit an individual case
That would be like suspending the laws of gravitation in order to move
a piano As things are Martin is no good to me no help to me She is a
rival to my duty She feels that She is hostile to my duty A definite
antagonism has developed She feels and treats fueland everything to
do with fuel as a bore It is an attack We quarrel on that It isnt as
though I found it so easy to stick to my work that I could disregard her
hostility And I cant bear to part from her I threaten it distress
her excessively and then I am overcome by sympathy for her and I go back
to her In the ordinary course of things I should be with her now

If it were not for the carbuncle

If it were not for the carbuncle She does not care for me to see her
disfigured She does not understand Sir Richmond was at a loss for a
phrasethat it is not her good looks

She wont let you go to her

It amounts to that And soon there will be all the trouble about
educating the girl Whatever happens she must have as good a chance
asanyone

Ah That is worrying you too

Frightfully at times If it were a boy it would be easier It needs
constant tact and dexterity to fix things up Neither of us have any It
needs attention

Sir Richmond mused darkly

Dr Martineau thought aloud An incompetent delightful person with
Martin Leedss sense of humour And her powers of expression She must
be attractive to many people She could probably do without you If once
you parted

Sir Richmond turned on him eagerly

You think I ought to part from her On her account

On her account It might pain her But once the thing was done

I want to part I believe I ought to part

Well

But then my affection comes in

That extraordinaryTENDERNESS of yours

Im afraid

Of what

Anyone might get hold of herif I let her down She hasnt a tithe of
the ordinary coolheaded calculation of an average woman Ive a duty
to her genius Ive got to take care of her

To which the doctor made no reply

Nevertheless the idea of parting has been very much in my mind lately

Letting her go FREE

You can put it in that way if you like

It might not be a fatal operation for either of you

And yet there are moods when parting is an intolerable idea When one
is invaded by a flood of affection And old habits of association

Dr Martineau thought Was that the right wordaffection Perhaps it
was

They had come out on the towing path close by the lock and they found
themselves threading their way through a little crowd of boating people
and lookerson For a time their conversation was broken Sir Richmond
resumed it

But this is where we cease to be Man on his Planet and all the rest of
it This is where the idea of a definite task fanatically followed to
the exclusion of all minor considerations breaks down When the work
is good when we are sure we are all right then we may carry off things
with a high hand But the work isnt always good we arent always
sure We blunder we make a muddle we are fatigued Then the
sacrificed affections come in as accusers Then it is that we want to be
reassured

And then it is that Miss Martin Leeds

Doesnt Sir Richmond snapped

Came a long pause

And yetIt is extraordinarily difficult to think of parting from
Martin

Section 3

In the evening after dinner Dr Martineau sought rather unsuccessfully
to go on with the analysis of Sir Richmond

But Sir Richmond was evidently a creature of moods Either he regretted
the extent of his confidences or the slight irrational irritation
that he felt at waiting for his car affected his attitude towards his
companion or Dr Martineaus tentatives were illchosen At any rate he
would not rise to any conversational bait that the doctor could devise
The doctor found this the more regrettable because it seemed to him that
there was much to be worked upon in this Martin Leeds affair He was
inclined to think that she and Sir Richmond were unduly obsessed by the
idea that they had to stick together because of the child because
of the look of the thing and so forth and that really each might be
struggling against a very strong impulse indeed to break off the affair
It seemed evident to the doctor that they jarred upon and annoyed each
other extremely On the whole separating people appealed to a doctors
mind more strongly than bringing them together Accordingly he framed
his enquiries so as to make the revelation of a latent antipathy as easy
as possible

He made several not very welldevised beginnings At the fifth Sir
Richmond was suddenly conclusive Its no use he said I cant
fiddle about any more with my motives today

An awkward silence followed On reflection Sir Richmond seemed to
realize that this sentence needed some apology I admit he said
that this expedition has already been a wonderfully good thing for me
These confessions have made me look into all sorts of thingssquarely
ButIm not used to talking about myself or even thinking directly
about myself What I say I afterwards find disconcerting to recall
I want to alter it I can feel myself wallowing into a mess of
modifications and qualifications

Yes but

I want a rest anyhow

There was nothing for Dr Martineau to say to that

The two gentlemen smoked for some time in a slightly uncomfortable
silence Dr Martineau cleared his throat twice and lit a second cigar
They then agreed to admire the bridge and think well of Maidenhead Sir
Richmond communicated hopeful news about his car which was to arrive
the next morning before tenhed just ring the fellow up presently to
make sureand Dr Martineau retired early and went rather thoughtfully
to bed The spate of Sir Richmonds confidences it was evident was
over

Section 4

Sir Richmonds car arrived long before ten brought down by a young
man in a state of scared alacritySir Richmond had done some vigorous
telephoning before turning inthe Charmeuse set off in a repaired and
chastened condition to town and after a leisurely breakfast our two
investigators into the springs of human conduct were able to resume
their westward journey They ran through scattered Twyford with its
pleasant looking inns and through the commonplace urbanities of Reading
by Newbury and Hungerfords pretty bridge and up long wooded slopes to
Savernake forest where they found the road heavy and dusty still in
its wartime state and so down a steep hill to the wide market street
which is Marlborough They lunched in Marlborough and went on in the
afternoon to Silbury Hill that British pyramid the largest artificial
mound in Europe They left the car by the roadside and clambered to the
top and were very learned and inconclusive about the exact purpose of
this vast heap of chalk and earth this heap that men had made before
the temples at Karnak were built or Babylon had a name

Then they returned to the car and ran round by a winding road into the
wonder of Avebury They found a clean little inn there kept by pleasant
people and they garaged the car in the cowshed and took two rooms for
the night that they might the better get the atmosphere of the ancient
place Wonderful indeed it is a vast circumvallation that was already
two thousand years old before the dawn of British history a great wall
of earth with its ditch most strangely on its inner and not on its outer
side and within this enclosure gigantic survivors of the great circles
of unhewn stone that even as late as Tudor days were almost complete
A whole village a church a pretty manor house have been built for the
most part out of the ancient megaliths the great wall is sufficient to
embrace them all with their gardens and paddocks four crossroads meet
at the village centre There are drawings of Avebury before these things
arose there when it was a lonely wonder on the plain but for the most
part the destruction was already done before the MAYFLOWER sailed To
the southward stands the cone of Silbury Hill its shadow creeps up and
down the intervening meadows as the seasons change Around this lonely
place rise the Downs now bare sheep pastures in broad undulations
with a wartlike barrow here and there and from it radiate creeping
up to gain and hold the crests of the hills the abandoned trackways
of that forgotten world These trackways these green roads of England
these roads already disused when the Romans made their highway past
Silbury Hill to Bath can still be traced for scores of miles through
the land running to Salisbury and the English Channel eastward to
the crossing at the Straits and westward to Wales to ferries over the
Severn and southwestward into Devon and Cornwall

The doctor and Sir Richmond walked round the walls surveyed the shadow
cast by Silbury upon the river flats strolled up the down to the
northward to get a general view of the village had tea and smoked
round the walls again in the warm April sunset The matter of their
conversation remained prehistoric Both were inclined to find fault
with the archaeological work that had been done on the place Clumsy
treasure hunting Sir Richmond said They bore into Silbury Hill and
expect to find a mummified chief or something sensational of that sort
and they dont and they report nothing They havent sifted finely
enough they havent thought subtly enough These walls of earth ought
to tell what these people ate what clothes they wore what woods they
used Was this a sheep land then as it is now or a cattle land Were
these hills covered by forests I dont know These archaeologists dont
know Or if they do they havent told me which is just as bad I dont
believe they know

What trade came here along these tracks So far as I know they had no
beasts of burthen But suppose one day someone were to find a potsherd
here from early Knossos or a fragment of glass from Pepis Egypt

The place had stirred up his imagination He wrestled with his ignorance
as if he thought that by talking he might presently worry out some
picture of this forgotten world without metals without beasts of
burthen without letters without any sculpture that has left a trace
and yet with a sense of astronomical fact clear enough to raise the
great gnomon of Silbury and with a social system complex enough to give
the large and orderly community to which the size of Avebury witnesses
and the traffic to which the green roads testify

The doctor had not realized before the boldness and liveliness of his
companions mind Sir Richmond insisted that the climate must have been
moister and milder in those days he covered all the downlands with
woods as Savernake was still covered beneath the trees he restored a
thicker richer soil These people must have done an enormous lot with
wood This use of stones here was a freak It was the very strangeness
of stones here that had made them into sacred things One thought too
much of the stones of the Stone Age Who would carve these lumps of
quartzite when one could carve good oak Or beecha most carvable wood
Especially when ones sharpest chisel was a flint Its wood we ought
to look for said Sir Richmond Wood and fibre He declared that
these people had their tools of wood their homes of wood their gods
and perhaps their records of wood A peat bog here even a few feet of
clay might have pickled some precious memoranda No such luck
Now in Glastonbury marshes one found the life of the early iron
agehalf way to our own timesquite beautifully pickled

Though they wrestled mightily with the problem neither Sir Richmond nor
the doctor could throw a gleam of light upon the riddle why the ditch
was inside and not outside the great wall

And what was our Mind like in those days said Sir Richmond That I
suppose is what interests you A vivid childish mind I guess with not
a suspicion as yet that it was Man ruling his Planet or anything of that
sort

The doctor pursed his lips None he delivered judicially If one
were able to recall ones childhoodat the age of about twelve or
thirteenwhen the artistic impulse so often goes into abeyance and one
begins to think in a troubled monstrous way about God and Hell one
might get something like the mind of this place

Thirteen You put them at that already These people you think
were religious

Intensely In that personal way that gives death a nightmare terror
And as for the fading of the artistic impulse theyve left not a trace
of the paintings and drawings and scratchings of the Old Stone people
who came before them

Adults with the minds of thirteenyearold children Thirteenyearold
children with the strength of adultsand no one to slap them or tell
them not to After all they probably only thought of death now and
then And they never thought of fuel They supposed there was no end to
that So they used up their woods and kept goats to nibble and kill the
new undergrowth DID these people have goats

I dont know said the doctor So little is known

Very like children they must have been The same unending days They
must have thought that the world went on for everjust as they knew
itlike my damned Committee does With their fuel wasting away and
the climate changing imperceptibly century by century Kings and
important men followed one another here for centuries and centuries
They had lost their past and had no idea of any future  They had
forgotten how they came into the land When I was a child I believed
that my fathers garden had been there for ever

This is very like trying to remember some game one played when one was
a child It is like coming on something that one built up with bricks
and stones in some forgotten part of the garden

The life we lived here said the doctor has left its traces in
traditions in mental predispositions in still unanalyzed fundamental
ideas

Archaeology is very like remembering said Sir Richmond Presently we
shall remember a lot more about all this We shall remember what it was
like to live in this place and the long journey hither age by age out
of the south We shall remember the sacrifices we made and the crazy
reasons why we made them We sowed our corn in blood here We had
strange fancies about the stars Those we brought with us out of the
south where the stars are brighter And what like were those wooden gods
of ours I dont remember But I could easily persuade myself that I
had been here before

They stood on the crest of the ancient wall and the setting sun cast
long shadows of them athwart a field of springing wheat

Perhaps we shall come here again the doctor carried on Sir Richmonds
fancy after another four thousand years or so with different names
and fuller minds And then I suppose that this ditch wont be the riddle
it is now

Life didnt seem so complicated then Sir Richmond mused Our muddles
were unconscious We drifted from mood to mood and forgot There was
more sunshine then more laughter perhaps and blacker despair Despair
like the despair of children that can weep itself to sleep Its
over Was it battle and massacre that ended that long afternoon here
Or did the woods catch fire some exceptionally dry summer leaving black
hills and famine Or did strange men bring a sicknessmeasles perhaps
or the black death Or was it cattle pest Or did we just waste our
woods and dwindle away before the new peoples that came into the land
across the southern sea I cant remember

Sir Richmond turned about I would like to dig up the bottom of
this ditch here foot by footand dry the stuff and sift itvery
carefully Then I might begin to remember things

Section 5

In the evening after a pleasant supper they took a turn about the
walls with the moon sinking over beyond Silbury and then went in and
sat by lamplight before a brightly fussy wood fire and smoked There
were long intervals of friendly silence

I dont in the least want to go on talking about myself said Sir
Richmond abruptly

Let it rest then said the doctor generously

Today among these ancient memories has taken me out of myself
wonderfully I cant tell you how good Avebury has been for me This
afternoon half my consciousness has seemed to be a tattooed creature
wearing a knife of stone

The healing touch of history

And for the first time my damned Committee has mattered scarcely a rap

Sir Richmond stretched himself in his chair and blinked cheerfully at
his cigar smoke

Nevertheless he said this confessional business of yours has been
an excellent exercise It has enabled me to get outside myself to look
at myself as a Case Now I can even see myself as a remote Case That
I neednt bother about further So far as that goes I think we have
done all that there is to be done

I shouldnt say thatquiteyet said the doctor

I dont think Im a subject for real psychoanalysis at all Im not
an overlaid sort of person When I spread myself out there is not much
indication of a suppressed wish or of anything masked or buried of that
sort What you get is a quite open and recognized discord of two sets of
motives

The doctor considered Yes I think that is true Your LIBIDO is I
should say exceptionally free Generally you are doing what you want to
dooverdoing in fact what you want to do and getting simply tired

Which is the theory I started with I am a case of fatigue under
irritating circumstances with very little mental complication or
concealment

Yes said the doctor I agree You are not a case for psychoanalysis
strictly speaking at all You are in open conflict with yourself upon
moral and social issues Practically open Your problems are problems of
conscious conduct

As I said

Of what renunciations you have consciously to make

Sir Richmond did not answer that

This pilgrimage of ours he said presently has made for
magnanimity This day particularly has been a good day When we stood on
this old wall here in the sunset I seemed to be standing outside myself
in an immense still sphere of past and future I stood with my feet
upon the Stone Age and saw myself four thousand years away and all my
distresses as very little incidents in that perspective Away there in
London the case is altogether different after three hours or so of
the Committee one concentrates into one little inflamed moment of
personality There is no past any longer there is no future there is
only the rankling dispute For all those three hours perhaps I have
been thinking of just what I had to say just how I had to say it
just how I looked while I said it just how much I was making myself
understood how I might be misunderstood how I might be misrepresented
challenged denied One draws in more and more as one is used up At
last one is reduced to a little raw bleeding desperately fighting
pinpoint of SELF One goes back to ones home unable to recover
Fighting it over again All night sometimes I get up and walk about
the room and curse Martineau how is one to get the Avebury frame of
mind to Westminster

When Westminster is as dead as Avebury said the doctor unhelpfully
He added after some seconds Milton knew of these troubles Not
without dust and heat he wrotea great phrase

But the dust chokes me said Sir Richmond

He took up a copy of THE GREEN ROADS OF ENGLAND that lay beside him on
the table But he did not open it He held it in his hand and said the
thing he had had in mind to say all that evening I do not think that
I shall stir up my motives any more for a time Better to go on into
the west country cooling my poor old brain in these wide shadows of the
past

I can prescribe nothing better said Dr Martineau Incidentally
we may be able to throw a little more light on one or two of your minor
entanglements

I dont want to think of them said Sir Richmond Let me get right
away from everything Until my skin has grown again




CHAPTER THE SIXTH

THE ENCOUNTER AT STONEHENGE

Section 1

Next day in the early afternoon after a farewell walk over the downs
round Avebury they went by way of Devizes and Netheravon and Amesbury to
Stonehenge

Dr Martineau had seen this ancient monument before but now with
Avebury fresh in his mind he found it a poorer thing than he had
remembered it to be Sir Richmond was frankly disappointed After the
real greatness and mystery of the older place it seemed a poor little
heap of stones it did not even dominate the landscape it was some way
from the crest of the swelling down on which it stood and it was further
dwarfed by the colossal airship hangars and clustering offices of the
air station that the great war had called into existence upon the slopes
to the southwest It looks Sir Richmond said as though some old
giantess had left a discarded set of teeth on the hillside Far more
impressive than Stonehenge itself were the barrows that capped the
neighbouring crests

The sacred stones were fenced about and our visitors had to pay for
admission at a little kiosk by the gate At the side of the road stood
a travelstained middleclass automobile with a miscellany of dusty
luggage rugs and luncheon things thereina family automobile with
father no doubt at the wheel Sir Richmond left his own trim coupe at
its tail

They were impeded at the entrance by a difference of opinion between the
keeper of the turnstile and a small but resolute boy of perhaps five or
six who proposed to leave the enclosure The custodian thought that it
would be better if his nurse or his mother came out with him

She keeps on looking at it said the small boy It isunt anything I
want to go and clean the car

You wont SEE Stonehenge every day young man said the custodian a
little piqued

Its only an old beach said the small boy with extreme conviction
Its rocks like the seaside And there isunt no sea

The man at the turnstile mutely consulted the doctor

I dont see that he can get into any harm here the doctor advised
and the small boy was released from archaeology

He strolled to the family automobile produced an ENTOUTCAS
pockethandkerchief and set himself to polish the lamps with great
assiduity The two gentlemen lingered at the turnstile for a moment or
so to watch his proceedings Modern child said Sir Richmond Old
stones are just old stones to him But motor cars are gods

You can hardly expect him to understandat his age said the
custodian jealous for the honor of Stonehenge

Reminds me of Martins little girl said Sir Richmond as he and Dr
Martineau went on towards the circle When she encountered her first
dragonfly she was greatly delighted Oh dee lill aeplane she
said

As they approached the grey old stones they became aware of a certain
agitation among them A voice an authoritative bass voice was audible
crying Anthony A nurse appeared remotely going in the direction of
the aeroplane sheds and her cry of Master Anthony came faintly on the
breeze An extremely pretty young woman of five or six and twenty became
visible standing on one of the great prostrate stones in the centre of
the place She was a blackhaired sunburnt individual and she stood
with her arms akimbo quite frankly amused at the disappearance of
Master Anthony and offering no sort of help for his recovery On the
greensward before her stood the paterfamilias of the family automobile
and he was making a trumpet with his hands in order to repeat the name
of Anthony with greater effect A short lady in grey emerged from among
the encircling megaliths and one or two other feminine personalities
produced effects of movement rather than of individuality as they
flitted among the stones Well said the lady in grey with that
rising intonation of humorous conclusion which is so distinctively
American those Druids have GOT him

Hes hiding said the automobilist in a voice that promised
chastisement to a hidden hearer Thats what he is doing He ought not
to play tricks like this A great boy who is almost six

If you are looking for a small resolute boy of six said Sir
Richmond addressing himself to the lady on the rock rather than to the
angry parent below hes perfectly safe and happy The Druids havent
got him Indeed theyve failed altogether to get him Stonehenge he
says is no good So hes gone back to clean the lamps of your car

Aaoo So THATS it said Papa Winnie go and tell Price hes
gone back to the car They oughtnt to have let him out of the
enclosure

The excitement about Master Anthony collapsed The rest of the people
in the circles crystallized out into the central space as two apparent
sisters and an apparent aunt and the nurse who was packed off at
once to supervise the lamp cleaning The head of the family found some
difficulty it would seem in readjusting his mind to the comparative
innocence of Anthony and Sir Richmond and the young lady on the rock
sought as if by common impulse to establish a general conversation
There were faint traces of excitement in her manner as though there
had been some controversial passage between herself and the family
gentleman

We were discussing the age of this old place she said smiling in the
frankest and friendliest way How old do YOU think it is

The father of Anthony intervened also with a shadow of controversy in
his manner I was explaining to the young lady that it dates from
the early bronze age Before chronology existed But she insists on
dates

Nothing of bronze has ever been found here said Sir Richmond

Well when was this early bronze age anyhow said the young lady

Sir Richmond sought a recognizable datum Bronze got to Britain
somewhere between the times of Moses and Solomon

Ah said the young lady as who should say This man at least talks
sense

But these stones are all shaped said the father of the family It is
difficult to see how that could have been done without something harder
than stone

I dont SEE the place said the young lady on the stone I cant
imagine how they did it upnot one bit

Did it up exclaimed the father of the family in the tone of one
accustomed to find a gentle sport in the intellectual frailties of his
womenkind

Its just the bones of a place They hung things round it They draped
it

But what things asked Sir Richmond

Oh they had things all right Skins perhaps Mats of rushes Bast
cloth Fibre of all sorts Wadded stuff

Stonehenge draped Its really a delightful idea said the father of
the family enjoying it

Its quite a possible one said Sir Richmond

Or they may have used wicker the young lady went on undismayed She
seemed to concede a point Wicker IS likelier

But surely said the father of the family with the expostulatory voice
and gesture of one who would recall erring wits to sanity it is
far more impressive standing out bare and noble as it does In lonely
splendour

But all this country may have been wooded then said Sir Richmond In
which case it wouldnt have stood out It doesnt stand out so very much
even now

You came to it through a grove said the young lady eagerly picking
up the idea

Probably beech said Sir Richmond

Which may have pointed to the midsummer sunrise said Dr Martineau
unheeded

These are NOVEL ideas said the father of the family in the reproving
tone of one who never allows a novel idea inside HIS doors if he can
prevent it

Well said the young lady I guess there was some sort of show here
anyhow And no human being ever had a show yet without trying to shut
people out of it in order to make them come in I guess this was covered
in all right A dark hunched old place in a wood Beech stems smooth
like pillars And they came to it at night in procession beating
drums and scared half out of their wits They came in THERE and went
round the inner circle with their torches And so they were shown The
torches were put out and the priests did their mysteries Until dawn
broke That is how they worked it

But even you cant tell what the show was VV said the lady in grey
who was standing now at Dr Martineaus elbow

Something horrid said Anthonys younger sister to her elder in a
stage whisper

BLUGGY agreed Anthonys elder sister to the younger in a noiseless
voice that certainly did not reach father SQUEALS

This young lady who was addressed as VV was perhaps one or two and
twenty Dr Martineau thoughthe was not very good at feminine ages
She had a clear sunbrowned complexion with dark hair and smiling lips
Her features were finely modelled with just that added touch of breadth
in the brow and softness in the cheek bones that faint flavour of the
Amerindian one sees at times in American women Her voice was a very
soft and pleasing voice and she spoke persuasively and not assertively
as so many American women do Her determination to make the dry bones of
Stonehenge live shamed the doctors disappointment with the place And
when she had spoken Dr Martineau noted that she looked at Sir Richmond
as if she expected him at least to confirm her vision Sir Richmond was
evidently prepared to confirm it

With a queer little twinge of infringed proprietorship the doctor saw
Sir Richmond step up on the prostrate megalith and stand beside her the
better to appreciate her point of view He smiled down at her Now why
do you think they came in THERE he asked

The young lady was not very clear about her directions She did not know
of the roadway running to the Avon river nor of the alleged race course
to the north nor had she ever heard that the stones were supposed to be
of two different periods and that some of them might possibly have been
brought from a very great distance

Section 2

Neither Dr Martineau nor the father of the family found the imaginative
reconstruction of the Stonehenge rituals quite so exciting as the two
principals The father of the family endured some further particulars
with manifest impatience no longer able now that Sir Richmond was
encouraging the girl to keep her in check with the slightly derisive
smile proper to her sex Then he proclaimed in a fine loud tenor All
this is very imaginative Im afraid And to his family Time we were
pressing on Turps we must goo Come Phoebe

As he led his little flock towards the exit his voice came floating
back Talking wanton nonsense Any professional archaeologist would
laugh simply laugh

He passed out of the world

With a faint intimation of dismay Dr Martineau realized that the two
talkative ladies were not to be removed in the family automobile with
the rest of the party Sir Richmond and the younger lady went on very
cheerfully to the population agriculture housing and general scenery
of the surrounding Downland during the later Stone Age The shorter
less attractive lady whose accent was distinctly American came now and
stood at the doctors elbow She seemed moved to play the part of chorus
to the two upon the stone

When VV gets going she remarked she makes things come alive

Dr Martineau hated to be addressed suddenly by strange ladies He
started and his face assumed the distressed politeness of the moon at
its full Your friend he said interested in archaeology

Interested said the stouter lady Why Shes a fiend at it Ever
since we came on Carnac

Youve visited Carnac

Thats where the bug bit her said the stout lady with a note of
querulous humour Directly VV set eyes on Carnac she just turned
against all her upbringing Why wasnt I told of this before she
said Whats Notre Dame to this This is where we came from This is
the real starting point of the MAYFLOWER Belinda she said weve got
to see all we can of this sort of thing before we go back to America
Theyve been keeping this from us And thats why were here right
now instead of being shopping in Paris or London like decent American
women

The younger lady looked down on her companion with something of the calm
expert attention that a plumber gives to a tap that is misbehaving and
like a plumber refrained from precipitate action She stood with the
backs of her hands resting on her hips

Well she said slowly giving most of the remark to Sir Richmond and
the rest to the doctor It is nearer the beginnings of things than
London or Paris

And nearer to us said Sir Richmond

I call that justparadoxical said the shorter lady who appeared to
be called Belinda

Not paradoxical Dr Martineau contradicted gently Life is always
beginning again And this is a time of fresh beginnings

Now thats after VVs own heart cried the stout lady in grey
Shell agree to all that Shes been saying it right across Europe
Rome Paris London theyre simply just done They dont signify any
more Theyve got to be cleared away

You let me tell my own opinions Belinda said the young lady who was
called VV I said that if people went on building with fluted pillars
and Corinthian capitals for two thousand years it was time they were
cleared up and taken away

Corinthian capitals Sir Richmond considered it and laughed
cheerfully I suppose Europe does rather overdo that sort of thing

The way she went on about the Victor Emmanuele Monument said the
lady who answered to the name of Belinda It gave me cold shivers to
think that those Italian officers might understand English

The lady who was called VV smiled as if she smiled at herself and
explained herself to Sir Richmond When one is travelling about one
gets to think of history and politics in terms of architecture I do
anyhow And those columns with Corinthian capitals have got to be a sort
of symbol for me for everything in Europe that I dont want and have no
sort of use for It isnt a bad sort of capital in its way florid and
pretty but not a patch on the Doricand that a whole continent should
come up to it and stick at it and never get past it

Its the classical tradition

It puzzles me

Its the Roman Empire That Corinthian column is a weed spread by the
Romans all over western Europe

And it smothers the history of Europe You cant see Europe because
of it Europe is obsessed by Rome Everywhere Marble Arches and ARCS DE
TRIOMPHE You never get away from it It is like some old gentleman who
has lost his way in a speech and keeps on repeating the same thing And
cant sit down The empire gentlementhe Empire Empire Rome itself
is perfectly frightful It stares at you with its great round stupid
arches as though it couldnt imagine that you could possibly want
anything else for ever Saint Peters and that frightful Monument are
just the same stuff as the Baths of Caracalla and the palaces of the
Caesars Just the same They will make just the same sort of ruins It
goes on and goes on

AVE ROMA IMMORTALIS said Dr Martineau

This Roman empire seems to be Europes first and last idea A fixed
idea And such a poor idea America never came out of that Its no
goodtelling me that it did It escaped from it So I said to Belinda
here Lets burrow if we can under all this marble and find out what
sort of people we were before this Roman empire and its acanthus weeds
got hold of us

I seem to remember at Washington something faintly Corinthian
something called the Capitol Sir Richmond reflected And other
buildings A Treasury

That is different said the young lady so conclusively that it seemed
to leave nothing more to be said on that score

A last twinge of Europeanism she vouchsafed We were young in those
days

You are well beneath the marble here

She assented cheerfully

A thousand years before it

Happy place Happy people

But even this place isnt the beginning of things here Carnac was
older than this And older still is Avebury Have you heard in America
of Avebury It may have predated this place they think by another
thousand years

Avebury said the lady who was called Belinda

But what is this Avebury asked VV Ive never heard of the place

I thought it was a lord said Belinda

Sir Richmond with occasional appeals to Dr Martineau embarked upon
an account of the glory and wonder of Avebury Possibly he exaggerated
Avebury

It was Dr Martineau who presently brought this disquisition upon
Avebury to a stop by a very remarkable gesture He looked at his watch
He drew it out ostentatiously a thick respectable gold watch for
the doctor was not the sort of man to wear his watch upon his wrist He
clicked it open and looked at it Thereby he would have proclaimed his
belief this encounter was an entirely unnecessary interruption of his
healing duologue with Sir Richmond which must now be resumed

But this action had scarcely the effect he had intended it to have It
set the young lady who was called Belinda asking about ways and means of
getting to Salisbury it brought to light the distressing fact that VV
had the beginnings of a chafed heel Once he had set things going they
moved much too quickly for the doctor to deflect their course He
found himself called upon to make personal sacrifices to facilitate the
painless transport of the two ladies to Salisbury where their luggage
awaited them at the Old George Hotel In some way too elusive to trace
it became evident that he and Sir Richmond were to stay at this same Old
George Hotel The luggage was to be shifted to the top of the coupe
the young lady called VV was to share the interior of the car with
Sir Richmond while the lady named Belinda for whom Dr Martineau
was already developing a very strong dislike was to be thrust into an
extreme proximity with him and the balance of the luggage in the dicky
seat behind

Sir Richmond had never met with a young woman with a genuine historical
imagination before and he was evidently very greatly excited and
resolved to get the utmost that there was to be got out of this
encounter

Section 3

Sir Richmond displayed a complete disregard of the sufferings of Dr
Martineau shamefully compressed behind him Of these he was to hear
later He ran his overcrowded little car overcrowded so far as the
dicky went over the crest of the Down and down into Amesbury and on
to Salisbury stopping to alight and stretch the legs of the party when
they came in sight of Old Sarum

Certainly they can do with a little stretching said Dr Martineau
grimly

This charming young woman had seized upon the imagination of Sir
Richmond to the temporary exclusion of all other considerations The
long Downland gradients quivering very slightly with the vibration of
the road came swiftly and easily to meet and pass the throbbing little
car as he sat beside her and talked to her He fell into that expository
manner which comes so easily to the native entertaining the visitor from
abroad

In England it seems to me there are four main phases of history Four
Avebury which I would love to take you to see tomorrow Stonehenge
Old Sarum which we shall see in a moment as a great grassy mound on our
right as we come over one of these crests Each of them represents
about a thousand years Old Sarum was Keltic it saw the Romans and the
Saxons through and for a time it was a Norman city Now it is pasture
for sheep Latest as yet is SalisburyEnglish real English It may
last a few centuries still It is little more than seven hundred years
old But when I think of those great hangars back there by Stonehenge
I feel that the next phase is already beginning Of a world one will
fly to the ends of in a week or so Our world still Our people your
people and mine who are going to take wing so soon now were made in
all these places We are visiting the old homes I am glad I came back
to it just when you were doing the same thing

Im lucky to have found a sympathetic fellow traveller she said
with a car

Youre the first American Ive ever met whose interest in history
didnt seem He sought for an inoffensive word

Silly Oh I admit it Its true of a lot of us Most of us We come
over to Europe as if it hadnt anything to do with us except to supply
us with old pictures and curios generally We come sightseeing Its
romantic Its picturesque We stare at the nativeslike visitors at
a Zoo We dont realize that we belong I know our style But we
arent all like that Some of us are learning a bit better than that
We have one or two teachers over there to lighten our darkness Theres
Professor Breasted for instance He comes sometimes to my fathers
house And theres James Harvey Robinson and Professor Hutton Webster
Theyve been trying to restore our memory

Ive never heard of any of them said Sir Richmond

You hear so little of America over here Its quite a large country and
all sorts of interesting things happen there nowadays And we are waking
up to history Quite fast We shant always be the most ignorant people
in the world We are beginning to realize that quite a lot of things
happened between Adam and the Mayflower that we ought to be told about
I allow its a recent revival The United States has been like one of
those men you read about in the papers who go away from home and turn up
in some distant place with their memories gone Theyve forgotten what
their names were or where they lived or what they did for a living
theyve forgotten everything that matters Often they have to begin
again and settle down for a long time before their memories come back
Thats how it has been with us Our memory is just coming back to us

And what do you find you are

Europeans Who came away from kings and churchesand Corinthian
capitals

You feel all this country belongs to you

As much as it does to you Sir Richmond smiled radiantly at her But
if I say that America belongs to me as much as it does to you

We are one people she said

We

Europe These parts of Europe anyhow And ourselves

You are the most civilized person Ive met for weeks and weeks

Well you are the first civilized person Ive met in Europe for a long
time If I understand you

There are multitudes of reasonable civilized people in Europe

Ive heard or seen very little of them

Theyre scattered I admit

And hard to find

So ours is a lucky meeting Ive wanted a serious talk to an American
for some time I want to know very badly what you think you are up to
with the worldour world

Im equally anxious to know what England thinks she is doing Her
ways recently have been a little difficult to understand On any
hypothesisthat is honourable to her

Hm said Sir Richmond

I assure you we dont like it This Irish business We feel a sort of
ownership in England Its like finding your dearest aunt torturing the
cat

We must talk of that said Sir Richmond

I wish you would

It is a cat and a dogand they have been very naughty animals And
poor Aunt Britannia almost deliberately lost her temper But I admit she
hits about in a very nasty fashion

And favours the dog

She does

I want to know all you admit

You shall And incidentally my friend and I may have the pleasure of
showing you Salisbury and Avebury If you are free

Were travelling together just we two We are wandering about the
south of England on our way to Falmouth Where I join a father in a few
days time and I go on with him to Paris And if you and your friend
are coming to the Old George

We are said Sir Richmond

I see no great scandal in talking right on to bedtime And seeing
Avebury tomorrow Why not Perhaps if we did as the Germans do and gave
our names now it might mitigate something of the extreme informality of
our behaviour

My name is Hardy Ive been a munition manufacturer I was slightly
wounded by a stray shell near Arras while I was inspecting some plant I
had set up and also I was hit by a stray knighthood So my name is
now Sir Richmond Hardy My friend is a very distinguished Harley Street
physician Chiefly nervous and mental cases His name is Dr Martineau
He is quite as civilized as I am He is also a philosophical writer He
is really a very wise and learned man indeed He is full of ideas Hes
stimulated me tremendously You must talk to him

Sir Richmond glanced over his shoulder at the subject of these
commendations Through the oval window glared an expression of malignity
that made no impression whatever on his preoccupied mind

My name said the young lady is Grammont The war whirled me over
to Europe on Red Cross work and since the peace Ive been settling up
things and travelling about Europe My father is rather a big business
man in New York

The oil Grammont

He is rather deep in oil I believe He is coming over to Europe
because he does not like the way your people are behaving in
Mesopotamia He is on his way to Paris now Paris it seems is where
everything is to be settled against you Belinda is a sort of companion
I have acquired for the purposes of independent travel She was Red
Cross too I must have somebody and I cannot bear a maid Her name is
Belinda Seyffert From Philadelphia originally You have that Seyffert
Grammont

And Hardy

Sir Richmond and Dr Martineau

AndAhThat great green bank there just coming into sight must be Old
Sarum The little ancient city that faded away when Salisbury lifted its
spire into the world We will stop here for a little while

Then it was that Dr Martineau was grim about the stretching of his
legs

Section 4

The sudden prospect which now opened out before Sir Richmond of talking
about history and suchlike topics with a charming companion for perhaps
two whole days instead of going on with this tiresome shamefaced
egotistical business of selfexamination was so attractive to him that
it took immediate possession of his mind to the entire exclusion
and disregard of Dr Martineaus possible objections to any such
modification of their original programme When they arrived in
Salisbury the doctor did make some slight effort to suggest a different
hotel from that in which the two ladies had engaged their rooms but
on the spur of the moment and in their presence he could produce no
sufficient reason for refusing the accommodation the Old George had
ready for him He was reduced to a vague We dont want to inflict
ourselves He could not get Sir Richmond aside for any adequate
expression of his feelings about Miss Seyffert before the four of them
were seated together at tea amidst the mediaeval modernity of the Old
George smokingroom And only then did he begin to realize the depth and
extent of the engagements to which Sir Richmond had committed himself

I was suggesting that we run back to Avebury tomorrow said Sir
Richmond These ladies were nearly missing it

The thing took the doctors breath away For the moment he could say
nothing He stared over his teacup dourfaced An objection formulated
itself very slowly But that dicky he whispered

His whisper went unnoted Sir Richmond was talking of the completeness
of Salisbury From the very beginning it had been a cathedral city it
was essentially and purely that The church at its best in the full
tide of its mediaeval ascendancy had called it into being He was
making some extremely loose and inaccurate generalizations about the
buildings and ruins each age had left for posterity and Miss Grammont
was countering with equally unsatisfactory qualifications Our age
will leave the ruins of hotels said Sir Richmond Railway arches and
hotels

Baths and aqueducts Miss Grammont compared Rome of the Empire comes
nearest to it

As soon as tea was over Dr Martineau realized they meant to walk
round and about Salisbury He foresaw that walk with the utmost
clearness In front and keeping just a little beyond the range of his
intervention Sir Richmond would go with Miss Grammont he himself and
Miss Seyffert would bring up the rear If I do he muttered Ill be
damned an unusually strong expression for him

You said asked Miss Seyffert

That I have some writing to dobefore the post goes said the doctor
brightly

Oh come and see the cathedral cried Sir Richmond with illconcealed
dismay He was if one may put it in such a fashion not looking at Miss
Seyffert in the directest fashion when he said this

Im afraid said the doctor mulishly Impossible

With the unspoken addition of You try her for a bit

Miss Grammont stood up Everybody stood up We can go first to look
for shops she said Theres those things you want to buy Belinda
a fountain pen and the little books We can all go together as far as
that And while you are shopping if you wouldnt mind getting one or
two things for me

It became clear to Dr Martineau that Sir Richmond was to be let off
Belinda It seemed abominably unjust And it was also clear to him that
he must keep closely to his own room or he might find Miss Seyffert
drifting back alone to the hotel and eager to resume with him

Well a quiet time in his room would not be disagreeable He could think
over his notes

But in reality he thought over nothing but the little speeches he would
presently make to Sir Richmond about the unwarrantable the absolutely
unwarrantable alterations that were being made without his consent in
their common programme

For a long time Sir Richmond had met no one so interesting and amusing
as this frankminded young woman from America Young woman was how he
thought of her she didnt correspond to anything so prim and restrained
and extensively reserved and withheld as a young lady  and though
he judged her no older than five and twenty the word girl with its
associations of virginal ignorances invisible purdah and trite ideas
newly discovered seemed even less appropriate for her than the word
boy She had an air of having in some obscure way graduated in life
as if so far she had lived each several year of her existence in a
distinctive and conclusive manner with the utmost mental profit and no
particular tarnish or injury He could talk with her as if he talked
with a man like himselfbut with a zest no man could give him

It was evident that the good things she had said at first came as the
natural expression of a broad stream of alert thought they were no mere
display specimens from one of those jackdaw collections of bright things
so many clever women waste their wits in accumulating She was not
talking for effect at all she was talking because she was tremendously
interested in her discovery of the spectacle of history and delighted
to find another person as possessed as she was

Belinda having been conducted to her shops the two made their way
through the bright evening sunlight to the compact gracefulness of the
cathedral A glimpse through a wroughtiron gate of a delightful
garden of spring flowers alyssum aubrietia snowuponthemountains
daffodils narcissus and the like held them for a time and then they
came out upon the level grassy space surrounded by little ripe old
houses on which the cathedral stands They stood for some moments
surveying it

Its a perfect little lady of a cathedral said Sir Richmond But
why I wonder did we build it

Your memory ought to be better than mine she said with her
halfclosed eyes blinking up at the sunlit spire sharp against the blue
Ive been away for so longover therethat I forget altogether Why DID
we build it

She had fallen in quite early with this freak of speaking and thinking
as if he and she were all mankind It was as if her mind had been
prepared for it by her own eager exploration in Europe My friend
the philosopher he had said will not have it that we are really the
individuals we think we are You must talk to himhe is a very curious
and subtle thinker We are just thoughts in the Mind of the Race
he says passing thoughts We arewhat does he call itMan on his
Planet taking control of life

Man and woman she had amended

But just as man on his planet taking control of life had failed
altogether to remember why the ditch at Avebury was on the inside
instead of the outside of the vallum so now Miss Grammont and Sir
Richmond found very great difficulty in recalling why they had built
Salisbury Cathedral

We built temples by habit and tradition said Sir Richmond But the
impulse was losing its force

She looked up at the spire and then at him with a faintly quizzical
expression

But he had his reply ready

We were beginning to feel our power over matter We were already very
clever engineers What interested us here wasnt the old religion any
more We wanted to exercise and display our power over stone We made
it into reeds and branches We squirted it up in all these spires and
pinnacles The priest and his altar were just an excuse Do you think
people have ever feared and worshipped in thisthis artists larkas
they did in Stonehenge

I certainly do not remember that I ever worshipped here she said

Sir Richmond was in love with his idea The spirit of the Gothic
cathedrals he said is the spirit of the skyscrapers It is
architecture in a mood of flaming ambition The Freemasons on the
building could hardly refrain from jeering at the little priest they had
left down below there performing antiquated puerile mysteries at his
altar He was just their excuse for doing it all

Skyscrapers she conceded An early display of the skyscraper
spirit You are doing your best to make me feel thoroughly at home

You are more at home here still than in that new country of ours
over the Atlantic But it seems to me now that I do begin to remember
building this cathedral and all the other cathedrals we built in
Europe It was the fun of building made us do it

Hm she said And my skyscrapers

Still the fun of building That is the thing I envy most about America
Its still large enough mentally and materially to build all sorts of
things Over here the sites are frightfully crowded

And what do you think we are building now And what do you think you
are building over here

What are we building now I believe we have almost grown up I believe
it is time we began to build in earnest For good

But are we building anything at all

A new world

Show it me she said

Were still only at the foundations said Sir Richmond Nothing shows
as yet

I wish I could believe they were foundations

But can you doubt we are scrapping the old

It was too late in the afternoon to go into the cathedral so they
strolled to and fro round and about the west end and along the path
under the trees towards the river exchanging their ideas very frankly
and freely about the things that had recently happened to the world and
what they thought they ought to be doing in it

Section 5

After dinner our four tourists sat late and talked in a corner of the
smokingroom The two ladies had vanished hastily at the first dinner
gong and reappeared at the second mysteriously and pleasantly changed
from tweedy pedestrians to indoor company They were quietly but
definitely dressed pretty alterations had happened to their coiffure a
silver band and deep red stones lit the dusk of Miss Grammonts hair
and a necklace of the same colourings kept the peace between her jolly
sunburnt cheek and her soft untanned neck It was evident her recent
uniform had included a collar of great severity Miss Seyffert had
revealed a plump forearm and proclaimed it with a clash of bangles Dr
Martineau thought her evening throat much too confidential

The conversation drifted from topic to topic It had none of the
steady continuity of Sir Richmonds duologue with Miss Grammont Miss
Seyfferts methods were too discursive and exclamatory She broke every
thread that appeared The Old George at Salisbury is really old
it shows it and Miss Seyffert laced the entire evening with her
recognition of the fact Just look at that old beam she would cry
suddenly To think it was exactly where it is before there was a Cabot
in America

Miss Grammont let her companion pull the talk about as she chose After
the animation of the afternoon a sort of lazy contentment had taken
possession of the younger lady She sat deep in a basket chair and spoke
now and then Miss Seyffert gave her impressions of France and Italy
She talked of the cabmen of Naples and the beggars of Amalfi

Apropos of beggars Miss Grammont from the depths of her chair threw out
the statement that Italy was frightfully overpopulated In some parts
of Italy it is like mites on a cheese Nobody seems to be living
Everyone is too busy keeping alive

Poor old women carrying loads big enough for mules said Miss
Seyffert

Little children working like slaves said Miss Grammont

And everybody begging Even the people at work by the roadside Who
ought to be getting wagessufficient

Beggingfrom foreignersis just a sport in Italy said Sir Richmond
It doesnt imply want But I agree that a large part of Italy is
frightfully overpopulated The whole world is Dont you think so
Martineau

Wellyesfor its present social organization

For any social organization said Sir Richmond

Ive no doubt of it said Miss Seyffert and added amazingly Im out
for Birth Control all the time

A brief but active pause ensued Dr Martineau in a state of sudden
distress attempted to drink out of a cold and empty coffee cup

The world swarms with cramped and undeveloped lives said Sir
Richmond Which amount to nothing Which do not even represent
happiness And which help to use up the resources the fuel and surplus
energy of the world

I suppose they have a sort of liking for their lives Miss Grammont
reflected

Does that matter They do nothing to carry life on They are just vain
repetitionsimperfect dreary blurred repetitions of one common life
All that they feel has been felt all that they do has been done
better before Because they are crowded and hurried and underfed and
undereducated And as for liking their lives they need never have had
the chance

How many people are there in the world she asked abruptly

I dont know Twelve hundred fifteen hundred millions perhaps

And in your world

Id have two hundred and fifty millions let us say At most It would
be quite enough for this little planet for a time at any rate Dont
you think so doctor

I dont know said Dr Martineau Oddly enough I have never thought
about that question before At least not from this angle

But could you pick out two hundred and fifty million aristocrats
began Miss Grammont My native instinctive democracy

Need not be outraged said Sir Richmond Any two hundred and fifty
million would do Theyd be able to develop fully all of them As
things are only a minority can do that The rest never get a chance

Thats what I always say said Miss Seyffert

A New Age said Dr Martineau a New World We may be coming to
such a stage when population as much as fuel will be under a world
control If one thing why not the other I admit that the movement of
thought is away from haphazard towards control

Im for control all the time Miss Seyffert injected following up her
previous success

I admit the doctor began his broken sentence again with marked
patience that the movement of thought is away from haphazard towards
controlin things generally But is the movement of events

The eternal problem of man said Sir Richmond Can our wills
prevail

There came a little pause

Miss Grammont smiled an enquiry at Miss Seyffert If YOU are said
Belinda

I wish I could imagine your world said Miss Grammont rising of two
hundred and fifty millions of fully developed human beings with room
to live and breathe in and no need for wars Will they live in palaces
Will they all be healthy Machines will wait on them No I cant
imagine it Perhaps I shall dream of it My dreaming self may be
cleverer

She held out her hand to Sir Richmond Just for a moment they stood hand
in hand appreciatively

Well said Dr Martineau as the door closed behind the two Americans
This is a curious encounter

That young woman has brains said Sir Richmond standing before the
fireplace There was no doubt whatever which young woman he meant But
Dr Martineau grunted

I dont like the American type the doctor pronounced judicially

I do Sir Richmond countered

The doctor thought for a moment or so You are committed to the project
of visiting Avebury he said

They ought to see Avebury said Sir Richmond

Hm said the doctor ostentatiously amused by his thoughts and
staring at the fire Birth Control I NEVER did

Sir Richmond smiled down on the top of the doctors head and said
nothing

I think said the doctor and paused I shall leave this Avebury
expedition to you

We can be back in the early afternoon said Sir Richmond To give
them a chance of seeing the cathedral The chapter house here is not one
to miss

And then I suppose we shall go on

As you please said Sir Richmond insincerely

I must confess that four people make the car at any rate seem
tremendously overpopulated And to tell the truth I do not find this
encounter so amusing as you seem to do I shall not be sorry when we
have waved goodbye to those young ladies and resume our interrupted
conversation

Sir Richmond considered something mulish in the doctors averted face

I find Miss Grammont an extremely interestingand stimulating human
being

Evidently

The doctor sighed stood up and found himself delivering one of the
sentences he had engendered during his solitary meditations in his room
before dinner He surprised himself by the plainness of his speech Let
me be frank he said regarding Sir Richmond squarely Considering
the general situation of things and your position I do not care very
greatly for the part of an accessory to what may easily develop as you
know very well into a very serious flirtation An absurd mischievous
irrelevant flirtation You may not like the word You may pretend it is
a conversation an ordinary intellectual conversation That is not
the word Simply that is not the word You people eye one another
Flirtation I give the affair its proper name That is all Merely that
When I thinkBut we will not discuss it now Good night Forgive
me if I put before you rather bluntly my particular point of view

Sir Richmond found himself alone With his eyebrows raised

Section 6

After twentyfour eventful hours our two students of human motives
found themselves together again by the fireplace in the Old George
smokingroom They had resumed their overnight conversation in a state
of considerable tension

If you find the accommodation of the car insufficient said Sir
Richmond in a tone of extreme reasonableness and I admit it is we can
easily hire a larger car in a place like this

I would not care if you hired an omnibus said Dr Martineau I am not
coming on if these young women are

But if you consider it scandalousand really Martineau really as
one man to another it does seem to me to be a bit pernickety of you a
broad and original thinker as you are

Thought is one matter Rash inconsiderate action quite another And
above all if I spend another day in or near the company of Miss Belinda
Seyffert I shallI shall be extremely rude to her

But said Sir Richmond and bit his lower lip and considered

We might drop Belinda he suggested turning to his friend and speaking
in low confidential tones She is quite a manageable person Quite
She couldfor examplebe left behind with the luggage and sent on by
train I do not know if you realize how the land lies in that quarter
It needs only a word to Miss Grammont

There was no immediate reply For a moment he had a wild hope that his
companion would agree and then he perceived that the doctors silence
meant only the preparation of an ultimatum

I object to Miss Grammont and that side of the thing more than I do to
Miss Seyffert

Sir Richmond said nothing

It may help you to see this affair from a slightly different angle if
I tell you that twice today Miss Seyffert has asked me if you were a
married man

And of course you told her I was

On the second occasion

Sir Richmond smiled again

Frankly said the doctor this adventure is altogether uncongenial
to me It is the sort of thing that has never happened in my life This
highway coupling

Dont you think said Sir Richmond that you are attaching rather too
muchwhat shall I sayromanticflirtatiousmeaning to this affair
I dont mind that after my rather lavish confessions you should
consider me a rather oversexed person but isnt your attitude rather
unfairunjust indeed and almost insulting to this Miss Grammont
After all shes a young lady of very good social position indeed
She doesnt strike youdoes sheas an undignified or helpless human
being Her manners suggest a person of considerable selfcontrol And
knowing less of me than you do she probably regards me as almost as
safe asa maiden aunt say Im twice her age We are a party of four
There are conventions there are considerations Arent you really
my dear Martineau overdoing all this side of this very pleasant little
enlargement of our interests

AM I said Dr Martineau and brought a scrutinizing eye to bear on Sir
Richmonds face

I want to go on talking to Miss Grammont for a day or so Sir Richmond
admitted

Then I shall prefer to leave your party

There were some moments of silence

I am really very sorry to find myself in this dilemma said Sir
Richmond with a note of genuine regret in his voice

It is not a dilemma said Dr Martineau with a corresponding loss of
asperity I grant you we discover we differ upon a question of taste
and convenience But before I suggested this trip I had intended to
spend a little time with my old friend Sir Kenelm Latter at Bournemouth
Nothing simpler than to go to him now

I shall be sorry all the same

I could have wished said the doctor that these ladies had happened
a little later

The matter was settled Nothing more of a practical nature remained to
be said But neither gentleman wished to break off with a harsh and bare
decision

When the New Age is here said Sir Richmond then surely a
friendship between a man and a woman will not be subjected to thethe
inconveniences your present code would set about it They would travel
about together as they chose

The fundamental principle of the new age said the doctor will be
Honi soit qui mal y pense In these matters With perhaps Fay ce
que vouldras as its next injunction So long as other lives are not
affected In matters of personal behaviour the world will probably be
much more free and individuals much more open in their conscience
and honour than they have ever been before In matters of property
economics and public conduct it will probably be just the reverse Then
there will be much more collective control and much more insistence
legal insistence upon individual responsibility But we are not living
in a new age yet we are living in the patchedup ruins of a very old
one And youif you will forgive meare living in the patched up
remains of a life that had already had its complications This young
lady whose charm and cleverness I admit behaves as if the new age were
already here Well that may be a very dangerous mistake both for her
and for you This affair if it goes on for a few days more may
involve very serious consequences indeed with which I for one do not
wish to be involved

Sir Richmond upon the hearthrug had a curious feeling that he was back
in the head masters study at Caxton

Dr Martineau went on with a lucidity that Sir Richmond found rather
trying to give his impression of Miss Grammont and her position in
life

She is he said manifestly a very expensively educated girl And
in many ways interesting I have been watching her I have not been
favoured with very much of her attention but that fact has enabled
me to see her in profile Miss Seyffert is a fairly crude mixture of
frankness insincerity and selfexplanatory egotism and I have been
able to disregard a considerable amount of the conversation she has
addressed to me Now I guess this Miss Grammont has had no mother since
she was quite little

Your guesses doctor are apt to be pretty good said Sir Richmond

You know that

She has told me as much

Hm WellShe impressed me as having the air of a girl who has had
to solve many problems for which the normal mother provides ready made
solutions That is how I inferred that there was no mother I dont
think there has been any stepmother either friendly or hostile
There hasnt been I thought not She has had various governesses and
companions ladies of birth and education engaged to look after her
and she has done exactly what she liked with them Her manner with Miss
Seyffert an excellent manner for Miss Seyffert by the bye isnt the
sort of manner anyone acquires in a day Or for one person only She is
a very sure and commanding young woman

Sir Richmond nodded

I suppose her father adores and neglects her and whenever she has
wanted a companion or governess butchered the thing has been done
These business Americans I am told neglect their womenkind give them
money and power let them loose on the world It is a sort of moral
laziness masquerading as affection Still I suppose custom and
tradition kept this girl in her place and she was petted honoured
amused talked about but not in a harmful way and rather bored right
up to the time when America came into the war Theoretically she had a
tremendously good time

I think this must be near the truth of her biography said Sir
Richmond

I suppose she has lovers

You dont mean

No I dont Though that is a matter that ought to have no special
interest for you I mean that she was surrounded by a retinue of men who
wanted to marry her or who behaved as though they wanted to marry her or
who made her happiness and her gratifications and her condescensions
seem a matter of very great importance to them She had the flattery of
an extremely uncritical and unexacting admiration That is the sort of
thing that gratifies a silly woman extremely Miss Grammont is not silly
and all this homage and facile approval probably bored her more than she
realized To anyone too intelligent to be steadily excited by buying
things and wearing things and dancing and playing games and going to
places of entertainment and being given flowers sweets jewellery pet
animals and books bound in a special sort of leather the prospect of
being a rich mans only daughter until such time as it becomes advisable
to change into a rich mans wealthy wife is probably not nearly so
amusing as envious people might suppose I take it Miss Grammont had got
all she could out of that sort of thing some time before the war and
that she had already read and thought rather more than most young women
in her position Before she was twenty I guess she was already looking
for something more interesting in the way of men than a rich admirer
with an automobile full of presents Those who seek find

What do you think she found

What would a rich girl find out there in America I dont know I
havent the material to guess with In London a girl might find a
considerable variety of active interesting men rising politicians
university men of distinction artists and writers even men of science
menthere are still such menactive in the creative work of the
empire

In America I suppose there is at least an equal variety made up of
rather different types She would find that life was worth while to such
people in a way that made the ordinary entertainments and amusements of
her life a monstrous silly waste of time With the facility of her sex
she would pick up from one of them the idea that made life worth while
for him I am inclined to think there was someone in her case who did
seem to promise a sort of life that was worth while And that somehow
the war came to alter the look of that promise

How

I dont know Perhaps I am only romancing But for this young woman
I am convinced this expedition to Europe has meant experience harsh
educational experience and very profound mental disturbance There have
been love experiences experiences that were something more than the
treats and attentions and proposals that made up her life when she was
sheltered over there And something more than that What it is I dont
know The war has turned an ugly face to her She has seen death and
suffering and ruin Perhaps she has seen people she knew killed Perhaps
the man has been killed Or she has met with cowardice or cruelty or
treachery where she didnt expect it She has been shocked out of the
first confidence of youth She has ceased to take the world for granted
It hasnt broken her but it has matured her That I think is why history
has become real to her Which so attracts you in her History for her
has ceased to be a fabric of picturesque incidents it is the study of a
tragic struggle that still goes on She sees history as you see it and I
see it She is a very grownup young woman

Its just that said Sir Richmond Its just that If you see as much
in Miss Grammont as all that why dont you want to come on with us You
see the interest of her

I see a lot more than that You dont know what an advantage it is to
be as I am rather cold and unresponsive to women and unattractive and
negligiblenegligible that is the exact wordto them YOU cant look
at a woman for five minutes without losing sight of her in a mist
of imaginative excitement Because she looks back at you I have the
privilege of the negligiblewhich is a cool head Miss Grammont has a
startled and matured mind an original mind Yes And there is something
more to be said Her intelligence is better than her character

I dont quite see what you are driving at

The intelligence of all intelligent women is better than their
characters Goodness in a woman as we understand it seems to imply
necessarily a certain imaginative fixity Miss Grammont has an impulsive
and adventurous character And as I have been saying she was a spoilt
child with no discipline You also are a person of high intelligence
and defective controls She is very much at loose ends Youon account
of the illness of that rather forgotten lady Miss Martin Leeds
Arent you rather abusing the secrets of the confessional

This IS the confessional It closes tomorrow morning but it is the
confessional still Look at the thing frankly You I say are also at
loose ends Can you deny it My dear sir dont we both know that ever
since we left London you have been ready to fall in love with any
pretty thing in petticoats that seemed to promise you three haporth of
kindness A lost dog looking for a master Youre a stray man looking
for a mistress Miss Grammont being a woman is a little more selective
than that But if shes at a loose end as I suppose she isnt protected
by the sense of having made her selection And she has no preconceptions
of what she wants You are a very interesting man in many ways You
carry marriage and entanglements lightly With an air of being neither
married nor entangled She is quite prepared to fall in love with you

But you dont really think that said Sir Richmond with an
illconcealed eagerness

Dr Martineau rolled his face towards Sir Richmond These
miraclesgrotesquelyhappen he said She knows nothing of Martin
Leeds You must remember that

And then he added if she and you fall in love as the phrase goes
what is to follow

There was a pause

Sir Richmond looked at his toes for a moment or so as if he took counsel
with them and then decided to take offence

Really he said this is preposterous You talk of falling in love as
though it was impossible for a man and woman to be deeply interested in
each other without that And the gulf in our agesin our quality From
the Psychologist of a New Age I find this amazing Are men and women
to go on for everseparated by this possibility into two hardly
communicating and yet interpenetrating worlds Is there never to be
friendship and companionship between men and women without passion

You ought to know even better than I do that there is not For such
people as you two anyhow And at present the world is not prepared to
tolerate friendship and companionship WITH that accompaniment That is
the core of this situation

A pause fell between the two gentlemen They had smoothed over the
extreme harshness of their separation and there was very little more to
be said

Well said Sir Richmond in conclusion I am very sorry indeed
Martineau that we have to part like this




CHAPTER THE SEVENTH

COMPANIONSHIP

Section 1

Well said Dr Martineau extending his hand to Sir Richmond on the
Salisbury station platform I leave you to it

His round face betrayed little or no vestiges of his overnight
irritation

Ought you to leave me to it smiled Sir Richmond

I shall be interested to learn what happens

But if you wont stay to see

Now Sir please said the guard respectfully but firmly and Dr
Martineau got in

Sir Richmond walked thoughtfully down the platform towards the exit

What else could I do he asked aloud to nobody in particular

For a little while he thought confusedly of the collapse of his
expedition into the secret places of his own heart with Dr Martineau
and then his prepossession with Miss Grammont resumed possession of his
mind Dr Martineau was forgotten

Section 2

For the better part of forty hours Sir Richmond had either been talking
to Miss Grammont or carrying on imaginary conversations with her in her
absence or sleeping and dreaming dreams in which she never failed
to play a part even if at times it was an altogether amazing and
incongruous part And as they were both very frank and expressive
people they already knew a very great deal about each other

For an American Miss Grammont was by no means autobiographical She
gave no sketches of her idiosyncrasies and she repeated no remembered
comments and prophets of her contemporaries about herself She either
concealed or she had lost any great interest in her own personality But
she was interested in and curious about the people she had met in life
and her talk of them reflected a considerable amount of light upon her
own upbringing and experiences And her liking for Sir Richmond was
pleasingly manifest She liked his turn of thought she watched him
with a faint smile on her lips as he spoke and she spread her opinions
before him carefully in that soft voice of hers like a shy child showing
its treasures to some suddenly trusted and favoured visitor

Their ways of thought harmonized They talked at first chiefly about the
history of the world and the extraordinary situation of aimlessness in a
phase of ruin to which the Great War had brought all Europe if not all
mankind The world excited them both in the same way as a crisis in
which they were called upon to do somethingthey did not yet clearly
know what Into this topic they peered as into some deep pool side by
side and in it they saw each other reflected

The visit to Avebury had been a great success It had been a
perfect springtime day and the little inn had been delighted at the
reappearance of Sir Richmonds car so soon after its departure Its
delight was particularly manifest in the cream and salad it produced
for lunch Both Miss Grammont and Miss Seyffert displayed an intelligent
interest in their food After lunch they had all gone out to the stones
and the wall Half a dozen sunburnt children were putting one of the
partially overturned megaliths to a happy use by clambering to the top
of it and sliding on their little behinds down its smooth and sloping
side amidst much mirthful squealing

Sir Richmond and Miss Grammont had walked round the old circumvallation
together but Belinda Seyffert had strayed away from them professing
an interest in flowers It was not so much that she felt they had to be
left together that made her do this as her own consciousness of being
possessed by a devil who interrupted conversations

When Miss Grammont was keenly interested in a conversation then Belinda
had learnt from experience that it was wiser to go off with her devil
out of the range of any temptation to interrupt

You really think said Miss Grammont that it would be possible to
take this confused old world and reshape it set it marching towards
that new world of yoursof two hundred and fifty million fully
developed beautiful and happy people

Why not Nobody is doing anything with the world except muddle about
Why not give it a direction

Youd take it in your hands like clay

Obdurate clay with a sort of recalcitrant unintelligent life of its
own

Her imagination glowed in her eyes and warmed her voice I believe what
you say is possible If people dare

I am tired of following little motives that are like flames that go out
when you get to them I am tired of seeing all the world doing the
same I am tired of a world in which there is nothing great but great
disasters Here is something mankind can attempt that we can attempt

And will

I believe that as Mankind grows up this is the business Man has to
settle down to and will settle down to

She considered that

Ive been getting to believe something like this But it frightens
me I suppose most of us have this same sort of dread of taking too much
upon ourselves

So we just live like pigs Sensible little piggywiggys Ive got a
Committee full of that sort of thing We live like little modest pigs
And let the world go hang And pride ourselves upon our freedom from the
sin of presumption

Not quite that

Well How do you put it

We are afraid she said Its too vast We want bright little lives
of our own

Exactlysensible little piggywiggys

We have a right to lifeand happiness

First said Sir Richmond as much right as a pig has to food But
whether we get life and happiness or fail to get them we human beings
who have imaginations want something more nowadays Of course we want
bright lives of course we want happiness Just as we want food just as
we want sleep But when we have eaten when we have slept when we have
jolly things about usit is nothing We have been made an exception
ofand got our rations The big thing confronts us still It is vast
I agree but vast as it is it is the thing we have to think about I
do not know why it should be so but I am compelled by something in my
nature to want to serve this idea of a new age for mankind I want it
as my culminating want I want a world in order a disciplined mankind
going on to greater things Dont you

Now you tell me of it she said with a smile I do

But before

No Youve made it clear It wasnt clear before

Ive been talking of this sort of thing with my friend Dr Martineau
And Ive been thinking as well as talking That perhaps is why Im so
clear and positive

I dont complain that you are clear and positive Ive been coming
along the same way Its refreshing to meet you

I found it refreshing to meet Martineau A twinge of conscience about
Dr Martineau turned Sir Richmond into a new channel Hes a most
interesting man he said Rather shy in some respects Devoted to his
work And hes writing a book which has saturated him in these ideas
Only two nights ago we stood here and talked about it The Psychology of
a New Age The world he believes is entering upon a new phase in its
history the adolescence so to speak of mankind It is an idea that
seizes the imagination There is a flow of new ideas abroad he thinks
widening realizations unprecedented hopes and fears There is a
consciousness of new powers and new responsibilities We are sharing the
adolescence of our race It is giving history a new and more intimate
meaning for us It is bringing us into directer relation with public
affairsmaking them matter as formerly they didnt seem to matter
That idea of the bright little private life has to go by the board

I suppose it has she said meditatively as though she had been
thinking over some such question before

The private life she said has a way of coming aboard again

Her reflections travelled fast and broke out now far ahead of him

You have some sort of work cut out for you she said abruptly

Yes Yes I have

I havent she said

So that I go about she added like someone who is looking for
something Id like to know if its not jabbing too searching a question
at youwhat you have found

Sir Richmond considered Incidentally he smiled I want to get
a lasso over the neck of that very forcible and barbaric person your
father I am doing my best to help lay the foundation of a scientific
world control of fuel production and distribution We have a Fuel
Commission in London with rather wide powers of enquiry into the whole
world problem of fuel We shall come out to Washington presently with
proposals

Miss Grammont surveyed the landscape I suppose she said poor
father IS rather like an unbroken mule in business affairs So many of
our big business men in America are Hell lash out at you

I dont mind if only he lashes out openly in the sight of all men

She considered and turned on Sir Richmond gravely

Tell me what you want to do to him You find out so many things for me
that I seem to have been thinking about in a sort of almost invisible
halfconscious way Ive been suspecting for a long time that
Civilization wasnt much good unless it got people like my father under
some sort of control But controlling fatheras distinguished from
managing him She reviewed some private and amusing memories He is a
most intractable man

Section 3

They had gone on to talk of her father and of the types of men who
controlled international business She had had plentiful opportunities
for observation in their homes and her own Gunter Lake the big banker
she knew particularly well because it seemed she had been engaged
or was engaged to marry him All these people she said are pushing
things about affecting millions of lives hurting and disordering
hundreds of thousands of people They dont seem to know what they
are doing They have no plans in particular And you are getting
something going that will be a plan and a direction and a conscience
and a control for them You will find my father extremely difficult but
some of our younger men would love it

And she went on there are American women whod love it too Were
petted Were kept out of things We arent placed We dont get enough
to do Were spenders and wastersnot always from choice While these
fathers and brothers and husbands of ours play about with the fuel and
power and life and hope of the world as though it was a game of poker
With all the empty unspeakable solemnity of the male And treat us as
though we ought to be satisfied if they bring home part of the winnings

That cant go on she said

Her eyes went back to the long low undulating skyline of the downs
She spoke as though she took up the thread of some controversy that had
played a large part in her life That isnt going on she said with an
effect of conclusive decision

Sir Richmond recalled that little speech now as he returned from
Salisbury station to the Old George after his farewell to Martineau He
recalled too the soft firmness of her profile and the delicate line of
her lifted chin He felt that this time at any rate he was not being
deceived by the outward shows of a charming human being This young
woman had real firmness of character to back up her free and independent
judgments He smiled at the idea of any facile passion in the
composition of so sure and gallant a personality Martineau was very
fineminded in many respects but he was an old maid and like all old
maids he saw man and woman in every encounter But passion was a thing
men and women fell back upon when they had nothing else in common When
they thought in the pleasantest harmony and every remark seemed to weave
a fresh thread of common interest then it wasnt so necessary It might
happen but it wasnt so necessary If it did it would be a secondary
thing to companionship Thats what she wasa companion

But a very lovely and wonderful companion the companion one would not
relinquish until the very last moment one could keep with her

Her views about America and about her own place in the world seemed
equally fresh and original to Sir Richmond

I realize Ive got to be a responsible American citizen she had said
That didnt mean that she attached very much importance to her recently
acquired vote She evidently classified voters into the irresponsible
who just had votes and the responsible who also had a considerable
amount of property as well She had no illusions about the power of the
former class It didnt exist They were steered to their decisions by
people employed directed or stimulated by father and his friends and
associates the owners of America the real responsible citizens Or
they fell a prey to the merely adventurous leading of revolutionaries
But anyhow they were steered She herself it was clear was bound
to become a very responsible citizen indeed She would some day she
laughed be swimming in oil and such like property Her interest in
Sir Richmonds schemes for a scientific world management of fuel was
therefore she realized a very direct one But it was remarkable to
find a young woman seeing it like that

Father it seemed varied very much in his attitude towards her He
despised and distrusted women generally and it was evident he had made
it quite clear to her how grave an error it was on her part to persist
in being a daughter and not a son At moments it seemed to Sir
Richmond that she was disposed to agree with father upon that When Mr
Grammonts sense of her regrettable femininity was uppermost then he
gave his intelligence chiefly to schemes for tying her up against the
machinations of adventurers by means of trustees partners lawyers
advisers agreements and suchlike complications or for acquiring a
workable son by marriage To this last idea it would seem the importance
in her life of the rather heavily named Gunter Lake was to be ascribed
But another mood of the old mans was distrust of anything that could
not be spoken of as his own flesh and blood and then he would direct
his attention to a kind of masculinization of his daughter and to
schemes for giving her the completest control of all he had to leave her
provided she never married nor fell under masculine sway After all
he would reflect as he hesitated over the practicability of his lifes
ideal there was Hetty Green

This latter idea had reft her suddenly at the age of seventeen from
the educational care of an English gentlewoman warranted to fit her for
marriage with any prince in Europe and thrust her for the mornings and
a moiety of the afternoons of the better part of a year after a swift
but competent training into a shirt waist and an office down town She
had been entrusted at first to a harvester concern independent of Mr
Grammont because he feared his own people wouldnt train her hard She
had worked for ordinary wages and ordinary hours and at the end of the
day she mentioned casually a large automobile with two menservants
and a trustworthy secretary used to pick her out from the torrent of
undistinguished workers that poured out of the Synoptical Building This
masculinization idea had also sent her on a commission of enquiry into
Mexico There apparently she had really done responsible work

But upon the question of labour Mr Grammont was fierce even for an
American business man and one night at a dinner party he discovered
his daughter displaying what he considered an improper familiarity
with socialist ideas This had produced a violent revulsion towards the
purdah system and the idea of a matrimonial alliance with Gunter Lake
Gunter Lake Sir Richmond gathered wasnt half a bad fellow Generally
it would seem Miss Grammont liked him and she had a way of speaking
about him that suggested that in some way Mr Lake had been rather
hardly used and had acquired merit by his behaviour under bad treatment
There was some story however connected with her war services in Europe
upon which Miss Grammont was evidently indisposed to dwell About that
story Sir Richmond was left at the end of his Avebury day and after his
last talk with Dr Martineau still quite vaguely guessing

So much fact about Miss Grammont as we have given had floated up in
fragments and pieced itself together in Sir Richmonds mind in the
course of a day and a half The fragments came up as allusions or by way
of illustration The sustaining topic was this New Age Sir Richmond
fore shadowed this world under scientific control the Utopia of fully
developed people fully developing the resources of the earth For a
number of trivial reasons Sir Richmond found himself ascribing the
project of this New Age almost wholly to Dr Martineau and presenting
it as a much completer scheme than he was justified in doing It was
true that Dr Martineau had not said many of the things Sir Richmond
ascribed to him but also it was true that they had not crystallized out
in Sir Richmonds mind before his talks with Dr Martineau The idea of
a New Age necessarily carries with it the idea of fresh rules of conduct
and of different relationships between human beings And it throws
those who talk about it into the companionship of a common enterprise
Tomorrow the New Age will be here no doubt but today it is the hope
and adventure of only a few human beings

So that it was natural for Miss Grammont and Sir Richmond to ask What
are we to do with such types as father and to fall into an idiom that
assumed a joint enterprise They had agreed by a tacit consent to a
common conception of the world they desired as a world scientifically
ordered an immense organization of mature commonsense healthy and
secure gathering knowledge and power for creative adventures as yet
beyond dreaming They were prepared to think of the makers of the
Avebury dyke as their yesterday selves of the stone age savages as
a phase in their late childhood and of this great world order Sir
Richmond foresaw as a day where dawn was already at hand And in such
long perspectives the states governments and institutions of today
became very temporarylooking and replaceable structures indeed Both
these two people found themselves thinking in this fashion with an
unwonted courage and freedom because the other one had been disposed to
think in this fashion before Sir Richmond was still turning over in
his mind the happy mutual release of the imagination this chance
companionship had brought about when he found himself back again at the
threshold of the Old George

Section 4

Sir Richmond Hardy was not the only man who was thinking intently about
Miss Grammont at that particular moment Two gentlemen were coming
towards her across the Atlantic whose minds it chanced were very
busily occupied by her affairs One of these was her father who
was lying in his brass bed in his commodious cabin on the Hollandia
regretting his diminishing ability to sleep in the early morning now
even when he was in the strong and soothing air of midAtlantic and
thinking of VV because she had a way of coming into his mind when it
was undefended and the other was Mr Gunter Lake on the Megantic
one day out from Sandy Hook who found himself equally sleepless and
preoccupied And although Mr Lake was a man of vast activities and
complicated engagements he was coming now to Europe for the express
purpose of seeing VV and having things out with her fully and
completely because in spite of all that had happened she made such an
endless series of delays in coming to America

Old Grammont as he appeared upon the pillow of his bed by the light of a
roseshaded bedside lamp was a smallheaded greyhaired gentleman with
a wrinkled face and sunken brown eyes Years of business experience
mitigated only by such exercise as the game of poker affords had
intensified an instinctive inexpressiveness Under the most solitary
circumstances old Grammont was still inexpressive and the face that
stared at the ceiling of his cabin and the problem of his daughter
might have been the face of a pickled head in a museum for any
indication it betrayed of the flow of thought within He lay on his back
and his bent knees lifted the bedclothes into a sharp mountain He was
not even trying to sleep

Why he meditated had VV stayed on in Europe so much longer than she
need have done And why had Gunter Lake suddenly got into a state of
mind about her Why didnt the girl confide in her father at least
about these things What was afoot She had thrown over Lake once and
it seemed she was going to turn him down again Well if she was an
ordinary female person that was a silly sort of thing to do With her
fortune and hisyou could buy the world But suppose she was not all
ordinary female person Her mother hadnt been ordinary anyhow
whatever else you called her and no one could call Grammont blood all
ordinary fluid  Old Grammont had never had any delusions about Lake
If Lakes father hadnt been a big man Lake would never have counted for
anything at all Suppose she did turn him down In itself that wasnt a
thing to break her fathers heart

What did matter was not whether she threw Lake over but what she threw
him over for If it was because he wasnt man enough well and good But
if it was for some other lover some goodlooking worthless impostor
some European title or suchlike folly

At the thought of a lover for VV a sudden flood of anger poured across
the old mans mind behind the still mask of his face It infuriated
him even to think of VV his little VV his own girl entertaining
a lover being possiblymost shameful thoughtIN LOVE Like some
ordinary silly female sinking to kisses to the deeds one could buy
and pay for His VV The idea infuriated and disgusted him He fought
against it as a possibility Once some woman in New York had ventured
to hint something to him of some fellow some affair with an artist
Caston she had linked this Caston with VVs red cross nursing in
Europe Old Grammont had made that woman sorry she spoke Afterwards
he had caused enquiries to be made about this Caston careful enquiries
It seems that he and VV had known each other there had been
something But nothing that VV need be ashamed of When old Grammonts
enquiry man had come back with his report old Grammont had been very
particular about that At first the fellow had not been very clear
rather muddled indeed as to how things wereno doubt he had wanted
to make out there was something just to seem to earn his money Old
Grammont had struck the table sharply and the eyes that looked out of
his mask had blazed What have you found out against her he had asked
in a low even voice Absolutely nothing Sir said the agent suddenly
white to the lips

Old Grammont stared at his memory of that moment for a while That
affair was all right quite all right Of course it was all right And
also happily Caston was among the dead But it was well her broken
engagement with Lake had been resumed as though it had never been broken
off If there had been any talk that fact answered it And now that Lake
had served his purpose old Grammont did not care in the least if he was
shelved VV could stand alone

Old Grammont had got a phrase in his mind that looked like dominating
the situation He dreamt of saying to VV VV Im going to make
a man of youif youre man enough That was a large proposition it
impliedoh it implied all sorts of things It meant that she would
care as little for philandering as an able young business man Perhaps
some day a long time ahead she might marry There wasnt much reason
for it but it might be she would not wish to be called a spinster
Take a husband thought old Grammont when I am gone as one takes a
butler to make the household complete In previous meditations on his
daughters outlook old Grammont had found much that was very suggestive
in the precedent of Queen Victoria She had had no husband of the lord
and master type so to speak but only a Prince Consort well in hand
Why shouldnt the Grammont heiress dominate her male belonging if it
came to that in the same fashion Why shouldnt one tie her up and tie
the whole thing up so far as any male belonging was concerned leaving
VV in all other respects free How could one do it

The speculative calm of the sunken brown eyes deepened

His thoughts went back to the white face of the private enquiry agent
Absolutely nothing Sir What had the fellow thought of hinting
Nothing of that kind in VVs composition never fear Yet it was a
curious anomaly that while one had a thousand ways of defending ones
daughter and ones property against that daughters husband there was
no power on earth by which a father could stretch his dead hand between
that daughter and the undue influence of a lover Unless you tied her up
for good and all lover or none

One was left at the mercy of VVs character

I ought to see more of her he thought She gets away from me Just
as her mother did A man need not suspect his womenkind but he should
know what they are doing It is duty his protective duty to them These
companions these Seyffert women and so forth were all very well in
their way there wasnt much they kept from you if you got them cornered
and asked them intently But a fathers eye is better He must go about
with the girl for a time watch her with other men give her chances
to talk business with him and see if she took them VV Im going
to make a man of you the phrase ran through his brain The deep
instinctive jealousy of the primordial father was still strong in old
Grammonts blood It would be pleasant to go about with her on his
right hand in Paris HIS girl straight and lovely desirable and
unapproachableabove that sort of nonsense above all other masculine
subjugation

VV Im going to make a man of you

His mind grew calmer Whatever she wanted in Paris should be hers Hed
just let her rip Theyd be like sweethearts together he and his girl

Old Grammont dozed off into dreamland

Section 5

The imaginations of Mr Gunter Lake two days behind Mr Grammont upon
the Atlantic were of a gentler more romantic character In them VV
was no longer a daughter in the fierce focus of a fathers jealousy but
the goddess enshrined in a good mans heart Indeed the figure that the
limelight of the reverie fell upon was not VV at all but Mr Gunter
Lake himself in his favourite role of the perfect lover

An interminable speech unfolded itself I ask for nothing in return
Ive never worried you about that Caston business and I never will
Married to me you shall be as free as if you were unmarried Dont I
know my dear girl that you dont love me yet Let that be as you wish
I want nothing you are not willing to give me nothing at all All I
ask is the privilege of making life happyand it shall be happyfor
you All I ask All I ask Protect guard cherish

For to Mr Gunter Lake it seemed there could be no lovelier thing in
life than a wife in name only slowly warmed into a glow of passion by
the steadfast devotion and the strength and wisdom of a mate at first
despised Until at last a day would come

My darling Mr Gunter Lake whispered to the darkness My little
guurl IT HAS BEEN WORTH THE WAITING

Section 6

Miss Grammont met Sir Richmond in the bureau of the Old George with a
telegram in her hand My father reported his latitude and longitude by
wireless last night The London people think he will be off Falmouth
in four days time He wants me to join his liner there and go on to
Cherbourg and Paris Hes arranged that He is the sort of man who can
arrange things like that Therell be someone at Falmouth to look after
us and put us aboard the liner I must wire them where I can pick up a
telegram tomorrow

Wells in Somerset said Sir Richmond

His plans were already quite clear He explained that he wanted her
first to see Shaftesbury a little old Wessex town that was three or
four hundred years older than Salisbury perched on a hill a Saxon
town where Alfred had gathered his forces against the Danes and where
Canute who had ruled over all Scandinavia and Iceland and Greenland
and had come near ruling a patch of America had died It was a little
sleepy place now looking out dreamily over beautiful views They
would lunch in Shaftesbury and walk round it Then they would go in
the afternoon through the pleasant west country where the Celts had
prevailed against the old folk of the Stonehenge temple and the Romans
against the Celts and the Saxons against the Romanized Britons and the
Danes against the Saxons a warscarred landscape abounding in dykes
and entrenchments and castles sunken now into the deepest peace to
Glastonbury to see what there was to see of a marsh village the Celts
had made for themselves three or four hundred years before the
Romans came And at Glastonbury also there were the ruins of a great
Benedictine church and abbey that had once rivalled Salisbury Thence
they would go on to Wells to see yet another great cathedral and to dine
and sleep Glastonbury Abbey and Wells Cathedral brought the story of
Europe right up to Reformation times

That will be a good day for us said Sir Richmond It will be like
turning over the pages of the history of our family to and fro There
will be nothing nearly so old as Avebury in it but there will be
something from almost every chapter that comes after Stonehenge Rome
will be poorly represented but that may come the day after at Bath And
the next day too I want to show you something of our old River Severn
We will come right up to the present if we go through Bristol There
we shall have a whiff of America our new find from which the tobacco
comes and we shall be reminded of how we set sail thitherwas it
yesterday or the day before You will understand at Bristol how it
is that the energy has gone out of this dreaming landto Africa and
America and the whole wide world It was the good men of Bristol by the
bye with their trade from Africa to America who gave you your colour
problem Bristol we may go through tomorrow and Gloucester mother of I
dont know how many American Gloucesters Bath well get in somehow
And then as an AngloAmerican showman I shall be tempted to run you
northward a little way past Tewkesbury just to go into a church here
and there and show you monuments bearing little shields with the stars
and stripes upon them a few stars and a few stripes the Washington
family monuments

It was not only from England that America came said Miss Grammont

But England takes an American memory back most easily and most
fullyto Avebury and the Baltic Northmen past the emperors and the
Corinthian columns that smothered Latin Europe For you and me anyhow
this is our past this was our childhood and this is our land He
interrupted laughing as she was about to reply Well anyhow he said
it is a beautiful day and a pretty country before us with the ripest
history in every grain of its soil So well send a wire to your London
people and tell them to send their instructions to Wells

Ill tell Belinda she said to be quick with her packing

Section 7

As Miss Grammont and Sir Richmond Hardy fulfilled the details of his
excellent programme and revised their impressions of the past and their
ideas about the future in the springtime sunlight of Wiltshire and
Somerset with Miss Seyffert acting the part of an almost ostentatiously
discreet chorus it was inevitable that their conversation should
become by imperceptible gradations more personal and intimate They
kept up the pose which was supposed to represent Dr Martineaus
philosophy of being Man and Woman on their Planet considering its
Future but insensibly they developed the idiosyncrasies of their
position They might profess to be Man and Woman in the most general
terms but the facts that she was the daughter not of Everyman but old
Grammont and that Sir Richmond was the angry leader of a minority upon
the Fuel Commission became more and more important What shall we do
with this planet of ours gave way by the easiest transitions to What
are you and I doing and what have we got to do How do you feel about it
all What do you desire and what do you dare

It was natural that Sir Richmond should talk of his Fuel Commission to
a young woman whose interests in fuel were even greater than his own
He found that she was very much better read than he was in the recent
literature of socialism and that she had what he considered to be a
most unfeminine grasp of economic ideas He thought her attitude
towards socialism a very sane one because it was also his own So far as
socialism involved the idea of a scientific control of natural resources
as a common property administered in the common interest she and he
were very greatly attracted by it but so far as it served as a form of
expression for the merely insubordinate discontent of the many with
the few under any conditions so long as it was a formula for class
jealousy and warfare they were both repelled by it If she had had any
illusions about the working class possessing as a class any profounder
political wisdom or more generous public impulses than any other class
those illusions had long since departed People were much the same she
thought in every class there was no stratification of either rightness
or righteousness

He found he could talk to her of his work and aims upon the Fuel
Commission and of the conflict and failure of motives he found in
himself as freely as he had done to Dr Martineau and with a surer
confidence of understanding Perhaps his talks with the doctor had got
his ideas into order and made them more readily expressible than they
would have been otherwise He argued against the belief that any
class could be good as a class or bad as a class and he instanced the
conflict of motives he found in all the members of his Committee and
most so in himself He repeated the persuasion he had already confessed
to Dr Martineau that there was not a single member of the Fuel
Commission but had a considerable drive towards doing the right thing
about fuel and not one who had a singleminded unencumbered drive
towards the right thing That said Sir Richmond is what makes life
so interesting and in spite of a thousand tragic disappointments so
hopeful Every man is a bad man every man is a feeble man and every
man is a good man My motives come and go Yours do the same We vary in
response to the circumstances about us Given a proper atmosphere most
men will be publicspirited rightliving generous Given perplexities
and darkness most of us can be cowardly and vile People say you cannot
change human nature and perhaps that is true but you can change its
responses endlessly The other day I was in Bohemia discussing Silesian
coal with Benes and I went to see the Festival of the Bohemian Sokols
Opposite to where I sat far away across the arena was a great bank of
men of the Sokol organizations an unbroken brown mass wrapped in their
brown uniform cloaks Suddenly the sun came out and at a word the whole
body flung back their cloaks showed their Garibaldi shirts and became
one solid blaze of red It was an amazing transformation until one
understood what had happened Yet nothing material had changed but the
sunshine And given a change in laws and prevailing ideas and the
very same people who are greedy traders grasping owners and revolting
workers today will all throw their cloaks aside and you will find them
working together cheerfully even generously for a common end
They arent traders and owners and workers and so forth by any inner
necessity Those are just the ugly parts they play in the present drama
Which is nearly at the end of its run

Thats a hopeful view said Miss Grammont I dont see the flaw in
itif there is a flaw

There isnt one said Sir Richmond It is my chief discovery about
life I began with the question of fuel and the energy it affords
mankind and I have found that my generalization applies to all
human affairs Human beings are fools weaklings cowards passionate
idiotsI grant you That is the brown cloak side of them so to speak
But they are not such fools and so forth that they cant do pretty well
materially if once we hammer out a sane collective method of getting and
using fuel Which people generally will understandin the place of
our present methods of snatch and wrangle Of that I am absolutely
convinced Some work some help some willingness you can get out of
everybody Thats the red And the same principle applies to most labour
and property problems to health to education to population social
relationships and war and peace We havent got the right system we
have inefficient halfbaked systems or no system at all and a wild
confusion and war of ideas in all these respects But there is a right
system possible none the less Let us only hammer our way through to the
sane and reasonable organization in this and that and the other human
affairs and once we have got it we shall have got it for good We may
not live to see even the beginnings of success but the spirit of order
the spirit that has already produced organized science if only there
are a few faithful persistent people to stick to the job will in the
long run certainly save mankind and make human life clean and splendid
happy work in a clear mind If I could live to see it

And as for usin our time

Measured by the end we serve we dont matter You know we dont
matter

We have to find our fun in the building and in our confidence that we
do really build

So long as our confidence lasts there is no great hardship said Sir
Richmond

So long as our confidence lasts she repeated after him

Ah cried Sir Richmond There it is So long as our confidence lasts
So long as one keeps ones mind steady That is what I came away with
Dr Martineau to discuss I went to him for advice I havent known him
for more than a month Its amusing to find myself preaching forth to
you It was just faith I had lost Suddenly I had lost my power of work
My confidence in the rightness of what I was doing evaporated My will
failed me I dont know if you will understand what that means It
wasnt that my reason didnt assure me just as certainly as ever that
what I was trying to do was the right thing to try to do But somehow
that seemed a cold and personally unimportant proposition The life had
gone out of it

He paused as if arrested by a momentary doubt

I dont know why I tell you these things he said

You tell them me she said

Its a little like a patient in a hydropath retailing his ailments

No No Go on

I began to think now that what took the go out of me as my work went
on was the lack of any real fellowship in what I was doing It was the
pressure of the opposition in the Committee day afterday It was being
up against men who didnt reason against me but who just showed by
everything they did that the things I wanted to achieve didnt matter
to them one rap It was going back to a home lunching in clubs reading
papers going about a world in which all the organization all the
possibility of the organization I dream of is tacitly denied I dont
know if it seems an extraordinary confession of weakness to you
but that steady refusal of the majority of my Committee to come into
cooperation with me has beaten meor at any rate has come very near to
beating me Most of them you know are such able men You can FEEL their
knowledge and commonsense They and everybody about me seemed busy and
intent upon more immediate things that seemed more real to them than
this remote theoretical PRIGGISH end I have set for myself

He paused

Go on said Miss Grammont I think I understand this

And yet I know I am right

I know you are right Im certain Go on

If one of those ten thousand members of the Sokol Society had thrown
back his brown cloak and shown red when all the others still kept them
selves cloakedif he was a normal sensitive manhe might have felt
something of a fool He might have felt premature and presumptuous Red
he was and the others he knew were red also but why show it That is
the peculiar distress of people like ourselves who have some sense
of history and some sense of a larger life within us than our merely
personal life We dont want to go on with the old story merely We want
to live somehow in that larger life and to live for its greater ends and
lose something unbearable of ourselves and in wanting to do that we are
only wanting to do what nearly everybody perhaps is ripe to do and will
presently want to do When the New Age Martineau talks about begins to
come it may come very quicklyas the red came at Prague But for the
present everyone hesitates about throwing back the cloak

Until the cloak becomes unbearable she said repeating his word

I came upon this holiday in the queerest state I thought I was ill
I thought I was overworked But the real trouble was a loneliness that
robbed me of all driving force Nobody seemed thinking and feeling with
me I have never realized until now what a gregarious beast man is
It needed only a day or so with Martineau in the atmosphere of ideas
and beliefs like my own to begin my restoration Now as I talk to
youThat is why I have clutched at your company Because here you are
coming from thousands of miles away and you talk my ideas you fall
into my ways of thought as though we had gone to the same school

Perhaps we HAVE gone to the same school she said

You mean

Disappointment Disillusionment Having to find something better in
life than the first things it promised us

But you Disappointed I thought that in America people might be
educating already on different lines

Even in America Miss Grammont said crops only grow on the ploughed
land

Section 8

Glastonbury in the afternoon was wonderful they talked of Avalon and of
that vanished legendary world of King Arthur and his knights and in
the early evening they came to Wells and a pleasant inn with a
quaint little garden before its front door that gave directly upon the
cathedral The three tourists devoted a golden half hour before dinner
to the sculptures on the western face The great screen of wrought stone
rose up warmly grey and clear and distinct against a clear blue sky in
which the moon hung round and already bright That western facade with
its hundreds of little figures tells the whole story of God and Man from
Adam to the Last Judgment as the mediaeval mind conceived it It is an
even fuller exposition than the carved Bible history that goes round
the chapter house at Salisbury It presented the universe said Sir
Richmond as a complete crystal globe It explained everything in
life in a simple and natural manner hope heaven devil and despair
Generations had lived and died mentally within that crystal globe
convinced that it was all and complete

And now said Miss Grammont we are in limitless space and time The
crystal globe is broken

And said Belinda amazinglyfor she had been silent for some time
the goldfish are on the floor VV Free to flop about Are they any
happier

It was one of those sudden rhetorical triumphs that are best left alone
I trow not said Belinda giving the last touch to it

After dinner Sir Richmond and Miss Grammont walked round the cathedral
and along by the moat of the bishops palace and Miss Seyffert stayed
in the hotel to send off postcards to her friends a duty she had
neglected for some days The evening was warm and still and the moon
was approaching its full and very bright Insensibly the soft afterglow
passed into moonlight

At first the two companions talked very little Sir Richmond was well
content with this tacit friendliness and Miss Grammont was preoccupied
because she was very strongly moved to tell him things about herself
that hitherto she had told to no one It was not merely that she wanted
to tell him these things but also that for reasons she did not put as
yet very clearly to herself she thought they were things he ought to
know She talked of herself at first in general terms Life comes on
anyone with a rush childhood seems lasting for ever and then suddenly
one tears into life she said It was even more so for women than it
was for men You are shown life a crowded vast spectacle full of what
seems to be intensely interesting activities and endless delightful and
frightful and tragic possibilities and you have hardly had time to
look at it before you are called upon to make decisions And there is
something in your blood that urges you to decisive acts Your mind
your reason resists Give me time it says They clamour at you with
treats crowds shows theatres all sorts of things lovers buzz at
you each trying to fix you part of his life when you are trying to get
clear to live a little of your own Her father had had one merit at any
rate He had been jealous of her lovers and very ready to interfere

I wanted a lover to love she said Every girl of course wants that
I wanted to be tremendously excited And at the same time I dreaded
the enormous interference

I wasnt temperamentally a cold girl Men interested and excited me
but there were a lot of men about and they clashed with each other
Perhaps way down in some out of the way place I should have fallen in
love quite easily with the one man who came along But no man fixed his
image After a year or so I think I began to lose the power which is
natural to a young girl of falling very easily into love I became
critical of the youths and men who were attracted to me and I became
analytical about myself

I suppose it is because you and I are going to part so soon that I can
speak so freely to you But there are things about myself that I have
never had out even with myself I can talk to myself in you

She paused baffled I know exactly said Sir Richmond

In my composition I perceive there have always been two ruling strains
I was a spoilt child at home a rather reserved girl at school keen on
my dignity I liked respect I didnt give myself away I suppose one
would call that personal pride Anyhow it was that streak made me value
the position of being a rich married woman in New York That was why
I became engaged to Lake He seemed to be as good a man as there was
about He said he adored me and wanted me to crown his life He wasnt
illlooking or illmannered The second main streak in my nature
wouldnt however fit in with that

She stopped short

The second streak said Sir Richmond

OhLove of beauty love of romance I want to give things their
proper names I dont want to pretend to you It was more or less
than that It wasimaginative sensuousness Why should I pretend it
wasnt in me I believe that streak is in all women

I believe so too In all properly constituted women

I tried to devote that streak to Lake she said I did my best for
him But Lake was much too much of a gentleman or an idealist about
women or what you will to know his business as a lover And that side
of me fell in love the rest of me protesting with a man named Caston
It was a notorious affair Everybody in New York couples my name with
Caston Except when my father is about His jealousy has blasted an
area of silencein that matterall round him He will not know of that
story And they dare not tell him I should pity anyone who tried to
tell it him

What sort of man was this Caston

Miss Grammont seemed to consider She did not look at Sir Richmond she
kept her profile to him

He was she said deliberately a very rotten sort of man

She spoke like one resolved to be exact and judicial I believe I
always knew he wasnt right But he was very handsome And ten years
younger than Lake And nobody else seemed to be all right so I
swallowed that He was an artist a painter Perhaps you know his work
Sir Richmond shook his head He could make American business men look
like characters out of the Three Musketeers they said and he was
beginning to be popular He made love to me In exactly the way Lake
didnt If I shut my eyes to one or two things it was delightful I
liked it But my father would have stood a painter as my husband almost
as cheerfully as he would a man of colour I made a fool of myself as
people say about Caston Wellwhen the war came he talked in a way
that irritated me He talked like an East Side Annunzio about art and
war It made me furious to know it was all talk and that he didnt mean
business I made him go

She paused for a moment He hated to go

Then I relented Or I missed him and I wanted to be made love to Or
I really wanted to go on my own account I forget I forget my motives
altogether now That early war time was a queer time for everyone A
kind of wildness got into the blood I threw over Lake All the time
things had been going on in New York I had still been engaged to Lake
I went to France I did good work I did do good work And also things
were possible that would have seemed fantastic in America You know
something of the wartime atmosphere There was death everywhere and
people snatched at gratifications Caston made Tomorrow we die his
text We contrived three days in Paris togethernot very cleverly All
sorts of people know about it We went very far

She stopped short Well said Sir Richmond

He did die

Another long pause They told me Caston had been killed But someone
hintedor I guessedthat there was more in it than an ordinary
casualty

Nobody I think realizes that I know This is the first time I have
ever confessed that I do know He wasshot He was shot for cowardice

That might happen to any man said Sir Richmond presently No man
is a hero all round the twentyfour hours Perhaps he was caught by
circumstances unprepared He may have been taken by surprise

It was the most calculated coldblooded cowardice imaginable He let
three other men go on and get killed


No It is no good your inventing excuses for a man you know nothing
about It was vile contemptible cowardice and meanness It fitted in
with a score of ugly little things I remembered It explained them all
I know the evidence and the judgment against him were strictly just and
true because they were exactly in character And that you see was
my man That was the lover I had chosen That was the man to whom I had
given myself with both hands

Her soft unhurrying voice halted for a time and then resumed in the
same even tones of careful statement I wasnt disgusted not even with
myself About him I was chiefly sorry intensely sorry because I had
made him come out of a life that suited and protected him to the
war About myself I was stunned and perplexed I had the clearest
realization that what you and I have been calling the bright little
personal life had broken off short and was spoilt and over and done
with I felt as though it was my body they had shot And there I was
with fifty years of life left in me and nothing particular to do with
them

That was just the prelude to life said Sir Richmond

It didnt seem so at the time I felt I had to got hold of something or
go to pieces I couldnt turn to religion I had no religion And Duty
What is Duty I set myself to that I had a kind of revelation one
night Either I find out what all this world is about I said or I
perish I have lost myself and I must forget myself by getting hold of
something bigger than myself And becoming that Thats why I have
been making a sort of historical pilgrimage Thats my story Sir
Richmond Thats my education Somehow though your troubles are
different it seems to me that my little muddle makes me understand how
it is with you What youve got this idea of a scientific ordering of
the world is what I in my younger less experienced way have been
feeling my way towards I want to join on I want to got hold of
this idea of a great fuel control in the world and of a still greater
economic and educational control of which it is a part I want to make
that idea a part of myself Rather I want to make myself a part of it
When you talk of it I believe in it altogether

And I believe in it when I talk of it to you

Section 9

Sir Richmond was stirred very deeply by Miss Grammonts confidences His
dispute with Dr Martineau was present in his mind so that he did not
want to make love to her But he was extremely anxious to express his
vivid sense of the value of her friendship And while he hesitated over
this difficult and unfamiliar task she began to talk again of herself
and in such a way as to give a new turn to Sir Richmonds thoughts

Perhaps I ought to tell you a little more about myself she said now
that I have told you so much I did a thing that still puzzles me I was
filled with a sense of hopeless disaster in France and I suppose I had
some sort of desperate idea of saving something out of the situation
I renewed my correspondence with Gunter Lake He made the suggestion I
knew he would make and I renewed our engagement

To go back to wealth and dignity in New York

Yes

But you dont love him

Thats always been plain to me But what I didnt realize until I had
given my promise over again was that I dislike him acutely

You hadnt realized that before

I hadnt thought about him sufficiently But now I had to think about
him a lot The other affair had given me an idea perhaps of what it
means to be married to a man And here I am drifting back to him The
horrible thing about him is the steady ENVELOPING way in which he has
always come at me Without fellowship Without any community of ideas
Ready to make the most extraordinary bargains So long as he can in any
way fix me and get me What does it mean What is there behind those
watching soliciting eyes of his I dont in the least love him and
this desire and service and all the rest of it he offers meits not
love Its not even such love as Caston gave me Its a game he plays
with his imagination

She had released a flood of new ideas in Sir Richmonds mind This
is illuminating he said You dislike Lake acutely You always have
disliked him

I suppose I have But its only now I admit it to myself

Yes And you might for example have married him in New York before
the war

It came very near to that

And then probably you wouldnt have discovered you disliked him You
wouldnt have admitted it to yourself

I suppose I shouldnt I suppose I should have tried to believe I loved
him

Women do this sort of thing Odd I never realized it before And there
are endless wives suppressing an acute dislike My wife does I see now
quite clearly that she detests me Reasonably enough From her angle Im
entirely detestable But she wont admit it wont know of it She never
will To the end of my life always she will keep that detestation
unconfessed She puts a face on the matter We both do And this affair
of yours Have you thought how unjust it is to Lake

Not nearly so much as I might have done

It is unfair to him Atrociously unfair Hes not my sort of man
perhaps but it will hurt him cruelly according to the peculiar laws
of his being He seems to me a crawling sort of lover with an immense
selfconceit at the back of his crawlingness

He has she endorsed

He backs himself to crawluntil he crawls triumphantly right over
you I dont like to think of the dream he has I take it he will
lose Is it fair to go into this game with him

In the interests of Lake she said smiling softly at Sir Richmond in
the moonlight But you are perfectly right

And suppose he doesnt lose

Sir Richmond found himself uttering sentiments

There is only one decent way in which a civilized man and a civilized
woman may approach one another Passionate desire is not enough What is
called love is not enough Pledges rational considerations all these
things are worthless All these things are compatible with hate
The primary essential is friendship clear understanding absolute
confidence Then within that condition in that elect relationship love
is permissible mating marriage or no marriage as you willall things
are permissible

Came a long pause between them

Dear old cathedral said Miss Grammont a little irrelevantly She
had an air of having concluded something that to Sir Richmond seemed
scarcely to have begun She stood looking at the great dark facade edged
with moonlight for some moments and then turned towards the hotel
which showed a pinklit window

I wonder she said if Belinda is still up And what she will think
when I tell her of the final extinction of Mr Lake I think she rather
looked forward to being the intimate friend secrets and everything of
Mrs Gunter Lake

Section 10

Sir Richmond woke up at dawn and he woke out of an extraordinary dream
He was saying to Miss Grammont There is no other marriage than the
marriage of true minds There is no other marriage than the marriage of
true minds He saw her as he had seen her the evening before light and
cool coming towards him in the moonlight from the hotel But also in
the inconsistent way of dreams he was very close to her kind faintly
smiling face and his eyes were wet with tears and he was kissing
her hand My dear wife and mate he was saying and suddenly he was
kissing her cool lips

He woke up and stared at his dream which faded out only very slowly
before the fresh sun rise upon the red tiles and tree boughs outside the
open window and before the first stir and clamour of the birds

He felt like a court in which some overwhelmingly revolutionary piece of
evidence had been tendered All the elaborate defence had broken down at
one blow He sat up on the edge of his bed facing the new fact

This is monstrous and ridiculous he said and Martineau judged me
exactly I am in love with her I am head over heels in love with
her I have never been so much in love or so truly in love with anyone
before

Section 11

That was the dawn of a long day of tension for Sir Richmond and Miss
Grammont Because each was now vividly aware of being in love with the
other and so neither was able to see how things were with the other
They were afraid of each other A restraint had come upon them both a
restraint that was greatly enhanced by their sense of Belinda acutely
observant ostentatiously tactful and selfeffacing and prepared at the
slightest encouragement to be overwhelmingly romantic and sympathetic
Their talk waned and was revived to an artificial activity and waned
again The historical interest had evaporated from the west of England
and left only an urgent and embarrassing present

But the loveliness of the weather did not fail and the whole day was
set in Severn landscapes They first saw the great river like a sea
with the Welsh mountains hanging in the sky behind as they came over the
Mendip crest above Shipham They saw it again as they crossed the hill
before Clifton Bridge and so they continued climbing to hill crests
for views at Alveston and near Dursley and so to Gloucester and the
lowest bridge and thence back down stream again through fat meadow lands
at first and much appleblossom and then over gentle hills through wide
pale Nownham and Lidney and Alvington and Woolaston to old Chepstow and
its brown castle always with the widening estuary to the left of them
and its foaming shoals and shining sand banks From Chepstow they turned
back north along the steep Wye gorge to Tintern and there at the snug
little Beaufort Arms with its prim lawn and flower garden they ended the
days journey

Tintern Abbey they thought a poor graceless mass of ruin down beside
the river and it was fenced about jealously and locked up from their
invasion After dinner Sir Richmond and Miss Grammont went for a walk in
the mingled twilight and moonlight up the hill towards Chepstow Both of
them were absurdly and nervously pressing to Belinda to come with them
but she was far too wise to take this sudden desire for her company
seriously Her dinner shoes she said were too thin Perhaps she
would change and come out a little later Yes come later said Miss
Grammont and led the way to the door

They passed through the garden I think we go up the hill  said Sir
Richmond

Yes she agreed up the hill

Followed a silence

Sir Richmond made an effort but after some artificial and disconnected
talk about Tintern Abbey concerning which she had no history ready
and then still lamer about whether Monmouthshire is in England
or Wales silence fell again The silence lengthened assumed a
significance a dignity that no common words might break

Then Sir Richmond spoke I love you he said with all my heart

Her soft voice came back after a stillness I love you she said
with all myself

I had long ceased to hope said Sir Richmond that I should ever find
a friend a lover perfect companionship

They went on walking side by side without touching each other or
turning to each other

All the things I wanted to think I believe have come alive in me she
said

Cool and sweet said Sir Richmond Such happiness as I could not have
imagined

The light of a silent bicycle appeared above them up the hill and swept
down upon them lit their two still faces brightly and passed

My dear she whispered in the darkness between the high hedges

They stopped short and stood quite still trembling He saw her face
dim and tender looking up to his

Then he took her in his arms and kissed her lips as he had desired in
his dream

When they returned to the inn Belinda Seyffert offered flat explanations
of why she had not followed them and enlarged upon the moonlight effect
of the Abbey ruins from the inn lawn But the scared congratulations
in her eyes betrayed her recognition that momentous things had happened
between the two




CHAPTER THE EIGHTH

FULL MOON

Section 1

Sir Richmond had talked in the moonlight and shadows of having found
such happiness as he could not have imagined But when he awoke in the
night that happiness had evaporated He awoke suddenly out of this love
dream that had lasted now for nearly four days and he awoke in a mood of
astonishment and dismay

He had thought that when he parted from Dr Martineau he had parted also
from that process of selfexploration that they had started together
but now he awakened to find it established and in full activity in his
mind Something or someone a sort of etherealized MartineauHardy an
abstracted intellectual conscience was demanding what he thought he was
doing with Miss Grammont and whither he thought he was taking her how
he proposed to reconcile the close relationship with her that he was now
embarked upon with in the first place his work upon and engagements
with the Fuel Commission and in the second place Martin Leeds
Curiously enough Lady Hardy didnt come into the case at all He had
done his utmost to keep Martin Leeds out of his head throughout the
development of this affair Now in an unruly and determined way that was
extremely characteristic of her she seemed resolute to break in

She appeared as an advocate without affection for her client but
without any hostility of the claims of Miss Grammont to be let alone
The elaborate pretence that Sir Richmond had maintained to himself that
he had not made love to Miss Grammont that their mutual attraction had
been irresistible and had achieved its end in spite of their resolute
and complete detachment collapsed and vanished from his mind He
admitted to himself that driven by a kind of instinctive necessity he
had led their conversation step by step to a realization and declaration
of love and that it did not exonerate him in the least that Miss
Grammont had been quite ready and willing to help him and meet him half
way She wanted love as a woman does more than a man does and he
had steadily presented himself as a man free to love able to love and
loving

She wanted a man to love she wanted perfected fellowship and you have
made her that tremendous promise That was implicit in your embrace And
how can you keep that promise

It was as if Martin spoke it was her voice it was the very quality of
her thought

You belong to this work of yours which must needs be interrupted or
abandoned if you take her Whatever is not mortgaged to your work is
mortgaged to me For the strange thing in all this is that you and I
love one anotherand have no power to do otherwise In spite of all
this

You have nothing to give her but stolen goods said the shadow of
Martin You have nothing to give anyone personally any more

Think of the love that she desires and think of this love that you can
give

Is there any new thing in you that you can give her that you havent
given me You and I know each other very well perhaps I know YOU too
well Havent you loved me as much as you can love anyone Think of all
that there has been between us that you are ready now eager now to set
aside and forget as though it had never been For four days you have
kept me out of your mind in order to worship her Yet you have known
I was therefor all you would not know No one else will ever be so
intimate with you as I am We have quarrelled together wept together
jested happily and jested bitterly You have spared me not at all
Pitiless and cruel you have been to me You have reckoned up all my
faults against me as though they were sins You have treated me at times
unlovinglynever was lover treated so unlovingly as you have sometimes
treated me And yet I have your loveas no other woman can ever have
it Even now when you are wildly in love with this girls freshness and
boldness and cleverness I come into your mind by right and necessity

She is different argued Sir Richmond

But you are the same said the shadow of Martin with Martins
unsparing return Your love has never been a steadfast thing It comes
and goes like the wind You are an extravagantly imperfect lover But
I have learnt to accept you as people accept the English weather
Never in all your life have you loved wholly fully steadfastlyas
people deserve to be lovednot your mother nor your father not your
wife nor your children nor me nor our child nor any living thing
Pleasant to all of us at timesat times bitterly disappointing You
do not even love this work of yours steadfastly this work to which you
sacrifice us all in turn You do not love enough That is why you have
these moods and changes that is why you have these lassitudes So it is
you are made

And that is why you must not take this brave young life so much
simpler and braver than your own and exalt itas you can doand then
fail it as you will do

Sir Richmonds mind and body lay very still for a time

Should I fail her

For a time Martin Leeds passed from the foreground of his mind

He was astonished to think how planless instinctive and unforeseeing
his treatment of Miss Grammont had been It had been just a blind drive
to get hold of her and possess her

Suddenly his passion for her became active in its defence again

But is there such a thing as a perfect love Is YOURS a perfect love
my dear Martin with its insatiable jealousy its ruthless criticism
Has the world ever seen a perfect lover yet Isnt it our imperfection
that brings us together in a common need Is Miss Grammont after all
likely to get a more perfect love in all her life than this poor love of
mine And isnt it good for her that she should love

Perfect love cherishes Perfect love foregoes

Sir Richmond found his mind wandering far away from the immediate
question Perfect love the phrase was his point of departure Was
it true that he could not love passionately and completely Was that
fundamentally what was the matter with him Was that perhaps what was
the matter with the whole world of mankind It had not yet come to
that power of loving which makes action full and simple and direct and
unhesitating Man upon his planet has not grown up to love is still an
eager egotistical and fluctuating adolescent He lacks the courage to
love and the wisdom to love Love is here But it comes and goes it
is mixed with greeds and jealousies and cowardice and cowardly
reservations One hears it only in snatches and single notes It is like
something tuning up before the Music begins The metaphor altogether
ran away with Sir Richmonds half dreaming mind Some day perhaps all
life would go to music

Love was music and power If he had loved enough he need never have
drifted away from his wife Love would have created love would have
tolerated and taught and inspired Where there is perfect love there
is neither greed nor impatience He would have done his work calmly
He would have won his way with his Committee instead of fighting and
quarrelling with it perpetually

Flimsy creatures he whispered Uncertain health Uncertain
strength A will that comes and goes Moods of baseness Moods of utter
beastliness Love like April sunshine April

He dozed and dreamt for a time of spring passing into a high summer
sunshine into a continuing music of love He thought of a world like
some great playhouse in which players and orchestra and audience all
cooperate in a noble production without dissent or conflict He thought
he was the savage of thirty thousand years ago dreaming of the great
world that is still perhaps thirty thousand years ahead His effort to
see more of that coming world than indistinct and cloudy pinnacles and
to hear more than a vague music dissolved his dream and left him awake
again and wrestling with the problem of Miss Grammont

Section 2

The shadow of Martin stood over him inexorable He had to release Miss
Grammont from the adventure into which he had drawn her This decision
stood out sternand inevitable in his mind with no conceivable
alternative

As he looked at the task before him he began to realize its difficulty
He was profoundly in love with her he was still only learning how
deeply and she was not going to play a merely passive part in this
affair She was perhaps as deeply in love with him

He could not bring himself to the idea of confessions and disavowals He
could not bear to think of her disillusionment He felt that he owed it
to her not to disillusion her to spoil things for her in that fashion
To turn into something mean and ugly after she has believed in me
It would be like playing a practical joke upon her It would be like
taking her into my arms and suddenly making a grimace at her It
would scar her with a second humiliation

Should he take her on to Bath or Exeter tomorrow and contrive by some
sudden arrival of telegrams that he had to go from her suddenly But a
mere sudden parting would not end things between them now unless he
went off abruptly without explanations or any arrangements for further
communications At the outset of this escapade there had been a tacit
but evident assumption that it was to end when she joined her father at
Falmouth It was with an effect of discovery that Sir Richmond realized
that now it could not end in that fashion that with the whisper of love
and the touching of lips something had been started that would go on
that would develop To break off now and go away without a word would
leave a raw and torn end would leave her perplexed and perhaps even
more humiliated with an aching mystery to distress her Why did he go
Was it something I saidsomething he found out or imagined

Parting had disappeared as a possible solution of this problem She and
he had got into each others lives to stay the real problem was
the terms upon which they were to stay in each others lives Close
association had brought them to the point of being in the completest
sense lovers that could not be and the real problem was the
transmutation of their relationship to some form compatible with his
honour and her happiness A word an idea from some recent reading
floated into Sir Richmonds head Sublimate he whispered We have
to sublimate this affair We have to put this relationship upon a Higher
Plane

His mind stopped short at that

Presently his voice sounded out of the depths of his heart God How I
loathe the Higher Plane

God has put me into this Higher Plane business like some poor little
kid who has to wear irons on its legs

I WANT her Do you hear Martin I want her

As if by a lightning flash he saw his car with himself and Miss
GrammontMiss Seyffert had probably fallen outtraversing Europe and
Asia in headlong flight To a sunlit beach in the South Seas

His thoughts presently resumed as though these unmannerly and fantastic
interruptions had not occurred

We have to carry the whole affair on to a Higher Planeand keep it
there We two love one anotherthat has to be admitted now I ought
never to have touched her I ought never to have thought of touching
her But we two are too high our aims and work and obligations are too
high for any ordinary love making That sort of thing would embarrass
us would spoil everything

Spoil everything he repeated rather like a small boy who learns an
unpalatable lesson

For a time Sir Richmond exhausted by moral effort lay staring at the
darkness

It has to be done I believe I can carry her through with it if I can
carry myself Shes a finer thing than I am On the whole I am glad
its only one more day Belinda will be about Afterwards we can
write to each other If we can get over the next day it will be all
right Then we can write about fuel and politicsand there wont be
her voice and her presence We shall really SUBLIMATE First class
ideasublimate And I will go back to dear old Martin whos all
alone there and miserable Ill be kind to her and play my part and tell
her her Carbuncle scar rather becomes her And in a little while I
shall be altogether in love with her again

Queer what a brute Ive always been to Martin

Queer that Martin can come in a dream to me and take the upper hand
with me

Queer that NOWI love Martin

He thought still more profoundly By the time the Committee meets again
I shall have been tremendously refreshed

He repeatedPut things on the Higher Plane and keep them there Then
go back to Martin And so to the work Thats it

Nothing so pacifies the mind as a clearcut purpose Sir Richmond fell
asleep during the fourth recapitulation of this programme

Section 3

When Miss Grammont appeared at breakfast Sir Richmond saw at once that
she too had had a restless night When she came into the little long
breakfast room of the inn with its brown screens and its neat white
tables it seemed to him that the Miss Grammont of his nocturnal
speculations the beautiful young lady who had to be protected and
managed and loved unselfishly vanished like some exorcised intruder
Instead was this real dear young woman who had been completely
forgotten during the reign of her simulacrum and who now returned
completely remembered familiar friendly intimate She touched his
hand for a moment she met his eyes with the shadow of a smile in her
own

Oranges said Belinda from the table by the window Beautiful
oranges

She had been preparing them poor Transatlantic exile after the
fashion in which grape fruits are prepared upon liners and in the
civilized world of the west Hes getting us tea spoons said Belinda
as they sat down

This is realler England than ever she said Ive been up an hour
I found a little path down to the river bank Its the greenest morning
world and full of wild flowers Look at these

Thats ladys smock said Sir Richmond Its not really a flower
its a quotation from Shakespeare

And there are cowslips

CUCKOO BUDS OF YELLOW HUE DO PAINT THE MEADOWS WITH DELIGHT All the
English flowers come out of Shakespeare I dont know what we did before
his time

The waiter arrived with the tea spoons for the oranges

Belinda having distributed these resumed her discourse of enthusiasm
for England She asked a score of questions about Gloucester and
Chepstow the Severn and the Romans and the Welsh and did not wait for
the answers She did not want answers she talked to keep things going
Her talk masked a certain constraint that came upon her companions after
the first mornings greetings were over

Sir Richmond as he had planned upstairs produced two Michelin maps
Today he said we will run back to Bathfrom which it will be easy
for you to train to Falmouth We will go by Monmouth and then turn back
through the Forest of Dean where you will get glimpses of primitive
coal mines still worked by two men and a boy with a windlass and a pail
Perhaps we will go through Cirencester I dont know Perhaps it is
better to go straight to Bath In the very heart of Bath you will
find yourselves in just the same world you visited at Pompeii Bath is
Pompeii overlaid by Jane Austens England

He paused for a moment We can wire to your agents from here before we
start and we can pick up their reply at Gloucester or Nailsworth or even
Bath itself So that if your father is nearer than we supposeBut I
think tomorrow afternoon will be soon enough for Falmouth anyhow

He stopped interrogatively

Miss Grammonts face was white That will do very well she said

Section 4

They started but presently they came to high banks that showed such
masses of bluebells ragged Robin great stitchwort and the like that
Belinda was not to be restrained She clamoured to stop the car and go
up the bank and pick her hands full and so they drew up by the roadside
and Sir Richmond and Miss Grammont sat down near the car while Belinda
carried her enthusiastic onslaught on the flowers up the steep bank and
presently out of earshot

The two lovers said unheeded things about the flowers to each other
and then fell silent Then Miss Grammont turned her head and seemed
deliberately to measure her companions distance Evidently she judged
her out of earshot

Well said Miss Grammont in her soft even voice We love one another
Is that so still

I could not love you more

It wasnt a dream

No

And tomorrow we part

He looked her in the eyes I have been thinking of that all night he
said at last

I too

And you think

That we must part Just as we arranged it when was it Three days or
three ages ago There is nothing else in the world to do except for us
to go our ways I love you That means for a womanIt means that I
want to be with you But that is impossible Dont doubt whether I
love you because I sayimpossible

Sir Richmond faced with his own nocturnal decision was now moved to
oppose it flatly Nothing that one can do is impossible

She glanced again at Belinda and bent down towards him Suppose she
said you got back into that car with me suppose that instead of going
on as we have planned you took me away How much of us would go

You would go said Sir Richmond and my heart

And this work of yours And your honour For the honour of a man in
this New Age of yours will be first of all in the work he does for the
world And you will leave your work to be just a lover And the work
that I might do because of my fathers wealth all that would vanish
too We should leave all of that all of our usefulness all that
much of ourselves But what has made me love you Just your breadth of
vision just the sense that you mattered What has made you love me
Just that I have understood the dream of your work All that we should
have to leave behind We should specialize in our own scandal We
should run away just for one thing To think by sharing the oldest
simplest dearest indulgences in the world that we had got each other
When really we had lost each other lost all that mattered

Her face was flushed with the earnestness of her conviction Her eyes
were bright with tears Dont think I dont love you Its so hard to
say all this Somehow it seems like going back on somethingsomething
supreme Our instincts have got us Dont think Id hold myself from
you dear Id give myself to you with both hands I love youWhen a
woman lovesI at any rateshe loves altogether But this thingI am
convincedcannot be I must go my own way the way I have to go My
father is the man obstinate more than half a savage For meI know
ithe has the jealousy of ten husbands If you take meIf our secret
becomes manifestIf you are to take me and keep me then his life and
your life will become wholly this Feud nothing but this Feud You have
to fight him anyhowthat is why I of all people must keep out of
the quarrel For him it would be an immense excitement full of the
possibility of fierce satisfactions for you whether you won me or lost
me it would be utter waste and ruin

She paused and then went onAnd for me too waste and ruin I shall
be a woman fought over I shall be fought over as dogs fight over a
bone I shall sink back to the level of Helen of Troy I shall cease to
be a free citizen a responsible free person Whether you win me or lose
me it will be waste and ruin for us both Your Fuel Commission will go
to pieces all the wide enduring work you have set me dreaming about
will go the same way We shall just be another romantic story No

Sir Richmond sat still a little like a sullen child she thought I
hate all this he said slowly I didnt think of your father before
and now I think of him it sets me bristling for a fight It makes
all this harder to give up And yet do you know in the night I was
thinking I was coming to conclusions very like yours For quite other
reasons I thought we ought not toWe have to keep friends anyhow and
hear of each other

That goes without saying

I thought we ought not to go on to be lovers in any way that Would
affect you touch you too closely I was sorryI had kissed you

Not I No Dont be sorry for that I am glad we have fallen in love
more glad than I have been of anything else in my life and glad we have
spoken plainly Though we have to part And

Her whisper came close to him For a whole day yet all round the clock
twice you and I have one another

Miss Seyffert began speaking as soon as she was well within earshot

I dont know the name of a single one of these flowers she cried
except the bluebells Look at this great handful Ive gotten
Springtime in Italy doesnt compare with it not for a moment

Section 5

Because Belinda Seyffert was in the dicky behind them with her alert
interest in their emotions all too thinly and obviously veiled it
seemed more convenient to Sir Richmond and Miss Grammont to talk not
of themselves but of Man and Woman and of that New Age according to the
prophet Martineau which Sir Richmond had partly described and
mainly invented and ascribed to his departed friend They talked
anthropologically philosophically speculatively with an absurd
pretence of detachment they sat side by side in the little car
scarcely glancing at one another but side by side and touching each
other and all the while they were filled with tenderness and love and
hunger for one another

In the course of a day or so they had touched on nearly every phase in
the growth of Man and Woman from that remote and brutish past which has
left its traces in human bones mingled with the bones of hyaenas and
cave bears beneath the stalagmites of Wookey Hole near Wells In those
nearly forgotten days the mind of man and woman had been no more than
an evanescent succession of monstrous and infantile imaginations That
brief journey in the west country had lit up phase after phase in the
long teaching and discipline of man as he had developed depth of memory
and fixity of purpose out of these raw beginnings through the dreaming
childhood of Avebury and Stonehenge and the crude boyhood of ancient
wars and massacres Sir Richmond recalled those phases now and how as
they had followed one another mans idea of woman and womans idea of
man had changed with them until nowadays in the minds of civilized men
brute desire and possession and a limitless jealousy had become almost
completely overlaid by the desire for fellowship and a free mutual
loyalty Overlaid he said The older passions are still there like
the fires in an engine He invented a saying for Dr Martineau that the
Man in us today was still the old man of Palaeolithic times with his
will his wrath against the universe increased rather than diminished
If today he ceases to crack his brothers bones and rape and bully his
womenkind it is because he has grown up to a greater game and means to
crack this world and feed upon its marrow and wrench their secrets from
the stars

And furthermore it would seem that the prophet Martineau had declared
that in this New Age that was presently to dawn for mankind jealousy
was to be disciplined even as we had disciplined lust and anger instead
of ruling our law it was to be ruled by law and custom No longer were
the jealousy of strange peoples the jealousy of ownership and the
jealousy of sex to determine the framework of human life There was to
be one peace and law throughout the world one economic scheme and a
universal freedom for men and women to possess and give themselves

And how many generations yet must there be before we reach that
Utopia Miss Grammont asked

I wouldnt put it at a very great distance

But think of all the confusions of the world

Confusions merely The world is just a muddle of states and religions
and theories and stupidities There are great lumps of disorderly
strength in it but as a whole it is a weak world It goes on by habit
Theres no great idea in possession and the only possible great idea is
this one The New Age may be nearer than we dare to suppose

If I could believe that

There are many more people think as we do than you suppose Are you and
I such very strange and wonderful and exceptional people

No I dont think so

And yet the New World is already completely established in our hearts
What has been done in our minds can be done in most minds In a little
while the muddled angry mind of Man upon his Planet will grow clear and
it will be this idea that will have made it clear And then life will
be very different for everyone That tyranny of disorder which oppresses
every life on earth now will be lifted There will be less and less
insecurity less and less irrational injustice It will be a better
instructed and a better behaved world We shall live at our ease not
perpetually anxious not resentful and angry And that will alter all
the rules of love Then we shall think more of the loveliness of other
people because it will no longer be necessary to think so much of the
dangers and weaknesses and pitifulliesses of other people We shall not
have to think of those who depend upon us for happiness and selfrespect
We shall not have to choose between a wasteful fight for a personal end
or the surrender of our hearts desire

Hearts desire she whispered Am I indeed your hearts desire

Sir Richmond sank his head and voice in response

You are the best of all things And I have to let you go

Sir Richmond suddenly remembered Miss Seyffert and half turned his face
towards her Her forehead was just visible over the hood of the open
coupe She appeared to be intelligently intent upon the scenery Then he
broke out suddenly into a tirade against the world But I am bored
by this jostling unreasonable world At the bottom of my heart I am
bitterly resentful today This is a world of fools and brutes in which
we live a world of idiotic traditions imbecile limitations cowardice
habit greed and mean cruelty It is a slum of a world a congested
district an insanitary jumble of souls and bodies Every good thing
every sweet desire is thwartedevery one I have to lead the life of a
slum missionary a sanitary inspector an underpaid teacher I am bored
Oh God how I am bored I am bored by our laws and customs I am bored
by our rotten empire and its empty monarchy I am bored by its parades
and its flags and its sham enthusiasms I am bored by London and its
life by its smart life and by its servile life alike I am bored
by theatres and by books and by every sort of thing that people call
pleasure I am bored by the brag of people and the claims of people and
the feelings of people Damn people I am bored by profiteers and by the
snatching they call business enterprise Damn every business man I am
bored by politics and the universal mismanagement of everything I am
bored by France by AngloSaxondom by German selfpity by Bolshevik
fanaticism I am bored by these fools squabbles that devastate the
world I am bored by Ireland Orange and Green Curse the Irishnorth
and south together Lord how I HATE the Irish from Carson to the last
Sinn Feiner And I am bored by India and by Egypt I am bored by Poland
and by Islam I am bored by anyone who professes to have rights Damn
their rights Curse their rights I am bored to death by this year and
by last year and by the prospect of next year I am boredI am horribly
boredby my work I am bored by every sort of renunciation I want to
live with the woman I love and I want to work within the limits of my
capacity Curse all Hullo Damn his eyesSteady ah The spark
Good No skid

He had come round a corner at five and twenty miles an hour and had
stopped his spark and pulled up neatly within a yard of the forewheel
of a waggon that was turning in the road so as to block the way
completely

That almost had me

And now you feel better said Miss Grammont

Ever so much said Sir Richmond and chuckled

The waggoner cleared the road and the car started up again

For a minute or so neither spoke

You ought to be smacked hard for that outbreakmy dear said Miss
Grammont

I oughtMY dear I have no right to be illtempered We two are
among the supremely fortunate ones of our time We have no excuse for
misbehaviour Got nothing to grumble at Always I am lucky THATwith
the waggonwas a very near thing God spoils us

We two he went on after a pause are among the most fortunate
people alive We are both rich and easily rich That gives us freedoms
few people have We have a vision of the whole world in which we live
Its in a messbut that is by the way The mass of mankind never gets
enough education to have even a glimpse of the world as a whole They
never get a chance to get the hang of it It is really possible for us
to do things that will matter in the world All our time is our own
all our abilities we are free to use Most people most intelligent and
educated people are caught in cages of pecuniary necessity they
are tied to tasks they cant leave they are driven and compelled and
limited by circumstances they can never master But we if we have
tasks have tasks of our own choosing We may not like the world but
anyhow we are free to do our best to alter it If I were a clerk in
Hoxton and you were a city typist then we MIGHT swear

It was you who swore smiled Miss Grammont

Its the thought of that clerk in Hoxton and that city typist who
really keep me at my work Any smacking ought to come from them
I couldnt do less than I do in the face of their helplessness
Nevertheless a day will comethrough what we do and what we refrain
from doing when there will be no bound and limited clerks in Hoxton and
no captive typists in the city And nobody at all to consider

According to the prophet Martineau said Miss Grammont

And then you and I must contrive to be born again

Heighho cried Miss Grammont A thousand years ahead When fathers
are civilized When all these phanton people who intervene on your
sideno I dont want to know anything about them but I know of them
by instinctwhen they also dont matter

Then you and I can have things out with each otherTHOROUGHLY said
Sir Richmond with a surprising ferocity in his voice charging the
little hill before him as though he charged at Time

Section 6

They had to wait at Nailsworth for a telegram from Mr Grammonts
agents they lunched there and drove on to Bath in the afternoon They
came into the town through unattractive and unworthy outskirts and only
realized the charm of the place after they had garaged their car at the
Pulteney Hotel and walked back over the Pulteney Bridge to see the Avon
with the Pump Room and the Roman Baths The Pulteney they found hung
with pictures and adorned with sculpture to an astonishing extent some
former proprietor must have had a mania for replicas and the place is
eventful with white marble fauns and sylphs and lions and Caesars and
Queen Victorias and packed like an exhibition with memories of Rome
Florence Milan Paris the National Gallery and the Royal Academy
amidst which splendours a competent staff administers modern comforts
with an oldfashioned civility But round and about the Pulteney one
has still the scenery of Georgian England the white faintly classical
terraces and houses of the days of Fielding Smollett Fanny Burney and
Jane Austen the graceful bridge with the bright little shops full of
presents from Bath the Pump Room with its water drinkers and a fine
array of the original Bath chairs

Down below the Pump Room our travellers explored the memories of
the days when the world was Latin from York to the Tigris and the
Corinthian capital flourished like a weed from Bath to Baalbek And they
considered a little doubtfully the seventeenth century statue of Bladud
who is said to have been healed by the Bath waters and to have founded
the city in the days when Stonehenge still flourished eight hundred
years before the Romans came

In the afternoon Miss Seyffert came with Sir Richmond and Miss Grammont
and was very enthusiastic about everything but in the evening after
dinner it was clear that her role was to remain in the hotel Sir
Richmond and Miss Grammont went out into the moonlit gloaming they
crossed the bridge again and followed the road beside the river towards
the old Abbey Church that Lantern of the West Away in some sunken
gardens ahead of them a band was playing and a cluster of little lights
about the bandstand showed a crowd of people down below dancing on the
grass These little lights these bobbing black heads and the lilting
music this little inflamed Centre of throbbing sounds and ruddy
illumination made the dome of the moonlit world about it seem very vast
and cool and silent Our visitors began to realize that Bath could
be very beautiful They went to the parapet above the river and stood
there leaning over it elbow to elbow and smoking cigarettes Miss
Grammont was moved to declare the Pulteney Bridge with its noble arch
its effect of height over the swirling river and the cluster of houses
above more beautiful than the Ponte Vecchio at Florence Down below was
a man in waders with a fishingrod going to and fro along the foaming
weir and a couple of boys paddled a boat against the rush of the water
lower down the stream

Dear England said Miss Grammont surveying this gracious spectacle
How full it is of homely and lovely and kindly things

It is the home we come from

You belong to it still

No more than you do I belong to a big overworking modern place called
London which stretches its tentacles all over the world I am as much a
homecoming tourist as you are Most of this western country I am seeing
for the first time

She said nothing for a space Ive not a word to say tonight she
said Im just full of a sort of animal satisfaction in being close to
you And in being with you among lovely things SomewhereBefore
we part tonight

Yes he said to her pause and his face came very near to hers

I want you to kiss me

Yes he said awkwardly glancing over his shoulder acutely aware of
the promenaders passing close to them

Its a promise

Yes

Very timidly and guiltily his hand sought hers beside it and gripped it
and pressed it My dear he whispered tritest and most unavoidable
of expressions It was not very like Man and Woman loving upon their
Planet it was much more like the shy endearments of the shop boys and
work girls who made the darkling populous about them with their silent
interchanges

There are a thousand things I want to talk about to you she said
After we have parted tomorrow I shall begin to think of them But
nowevery rational thing seems dissolved in this moonlight

Presently she made an effort to restore the intellectual dignity of
their relationship

I suppose I ought to be more concerned tonight about the work I have to
do in the world and anxious for you to tell me this and that but indeed
I am not concerned at all about it I seem to have it in outline all
perfectly clear I mean to play a mans part in the world just as
my father wants me to do I mean to win his confidence and work with
himlike a partner Then some day I shall be a power in the world of
fuel And at the same time I must watch and read and think and learn
how to be the servant of the world We two have to live like trusted
servants who have been made guardians of a helpless minor We have
to put things in order and keep them in order against the time when
ManMan whom we call in America the Common Mancan take hold of his
world

And release his servants said Sir Richmond

All that is perfectly clear in my mind That is what I am going to live
for that is what I have to do

She stopped abruptly All that is about as interesting tonightin
comparison with the touch of your dear fingersas next months railway
timetable

But later she found a topic that could hold their attention for a time

We have never said a word about religion she said

Sir Richmond paused for a moment I am a godless man he said The
stars and space and time overwhelm my imagination I cannot imagine
anything above or beyond them

She thought that over But there are divine things she said

YOU are divine Im not talking lovers nonsense he hastened to
add I mean that there is something about human beingsnot just the
everyday stuff of them but something that appears intermittentlyas
though a light shone through something translucent If I believe in any
divinity at all it is a divinity revealed to me by other peopleAnd
even by myself in my own heart

Im never surprised at the badness of human beings said Sir Richmond
seeing how they have come about and what they are but I have been
surprised time after time by fine things Often in people I disliked
or thought little of I can understand that I find you full of divine
quality because I am in love with you and all alive to you Necessarily
I keep on discovering loveliness in you But I have seen divine things
in dear old Martineau for example A vain man fussy timidand yet
filled with a passion for truth ready to make great sacrifices and to
toil tremendously for that And in those men I am always cursing
my Committee it is astonishing at times to discover what streaks of
goodness even the really bad men can show But one cant make use
of just anyones divinity I can see the divinity in Martineau but it
leaves me cold He tired me and bored me But I live on you Its
only through love that the God can reach over from one human being to
another All real love is a divine thing a reassurance a release of
courage It is wonderful enough that we should take food and drink and
turn them into imagination invention and creative energy it is still
more wonderful that we should take an animal urging and turn it into a
light to discover beauty and an impulse towards the utmost achievements
of which we are capable All love is a sacrament and all lovers are
priests to each other You and I

Sir Richmond broke off abruptly I spent three days trying to tell this
to Dr Martineau But he wasnt the priest I had to confess to and the
words wouldnt come I can confess it to you readily enough

I cannot tell said Miss Grammont whether this is the last wisdom in
life or moonshine I cannot tell whether I am thinking or feeling but
the noise of the water going over the weir below is like the stir in
my heart And I am swimming in love and happiness Am I awake or am I
dreaming you and are we dreaming one another Hold my handhold it
hard and tight Im trembling with love for you and all the world If
I say more I shall be weeping

For a long time they stood side by side saying not a word to one
another

Presently the band down below and the dancing ceased and the little
lights were extinguished The silent moon seemed to grow brighter and
larger and the whisper of the waters louder A crowd of young people
flowed out of the gardens and passed by on their way home Sir Richmond
and Miss Grammont strolled through the dispersing crowd and over the
Toll Bridge and went exploring down a little staircase that went down
from the end of the bridge to the dark river and then came back to
their old position at the parapet looking upon the weir and the Pulteney
Bridge The gardens that had been so gay were already dark and silent as
they returned and the streets echoed emptily to the few people who were
still abroad

Its the most beautiful bridge in the world said Miss Grammont and
gave him her hand again

Some deeptoned clock close by proclaimed the hour eleven

The silence healed again

Well said Sir Richmond

Well said Miss Grammont smiling very faintly

I suppose we must go out of all this beauty now back to the lights of
the hotel and the watchful eyes of your dragon

She has not been a very exacting dragon so far has she

She is a miracle of tact

She does not really watch But she is curiousand very sympathetic

She is wonderful

That man is still fishing said Miss Grammont

For a time she peered down at the dark figure wading in the foam below
as though it was the only thing of interest in the world Then she
turned to Sir Richmond

I would trust Belinda with my life she said And anyhownowwe need
not worry about Belinda

Section 7

At the breakfast table it was Belinda who was the most nervous of the
three the most moved the most disposed to throw a sacramental air over
their last meal together Her companions had passed beyond the idea of
separation it was as if they now cherished a secret satisfaction at the
high dignity of their parting Belinda in some way perceived they had
become different They were no longer tremulous lovers they seemed
sure of one another and with a new pride in their bearing It would have
pleased Belinda better seeing how soon they were to be torn apart if
they had not made quite such excellent breakfasts She even suspected
them of having slept well Yet yesterday they had been deeply stirred
They had stayed out late last night so late that she had not heard them
come in Perhaps then they had passed the climax of their emotions Sir
Richmond she learnt was to take the party to Exeter where there would
be a train for Falmouth a little after two If they started from Bath
about nine that would give them an ample margin of time in which to deal
with a puncture or any such misadventure

They crested the Mendips above Shepton Mallet ran through Tilchester
and Ilminster into the lovely hill country about UpOttery and so
to Honiton and the broad level road to Exeter Sir Richmond and Miss
Grammont were in a state of happy gravity they sat contentedly side by
side talking very little They had already made their arrangements for
writing to one another There was to be no stream of loveletters or
protestations That might prove a mutual torment Their love was to be
implicit They were to write at intervals about political matters
and their common interests and to keep each other informed of their
movements about the world

We shall be working together she said speaking suddenly out of a
train of thought she had been following we shall be closer together
than many a couple who have never spent a day apart for twenty years

Then presently she said In the New Age all lovers will have to be
accustomed to meeting and parting We women will not be tied very much
by domestic needs Unless we see fit to have children We shall be going
about our business like men we shall have worldwide businessesmany
of usjust as men will

It will be a world full of lovers meetings

Some daysomewherewe two will certainly meet again

Even you have to force circumstances a little said Sir Richmond

We shall meet she said without doing that

But where he asked unanswered

Meetings and partings she said Women will be used to seeing their
lovers go away Even to seeing them go away to other women who have
borne them children and who have a closer claim on them

No one began Sir Richmond startled

But I dont mind very much Its how things are If I were a perfectly
civilized woman I shouldnt mind at all If men and women are not to be
tied to each other there must needs be such things as this

But you said Sir Richmond I at any rate am not like that I cannot
bear the thought that YOU

You need not bear it my dear I was just trying to imagine this world
that is to be Women I think are different from men in their jealousy
Men are jealous of the other man women are jealous for their manand
careless about the other woman What I love in you I am sure about My
mind was empty when it came to you and now it is full to overflowing I
shall feel you moving about in the same world with me Im not likely to
think of anyone else for a very long time Later on who knows I may
marry I make no vows But I think until I know certainly that you do
not want me any more it will be impossible for me to marry or to have a
lover I dont know but that is how I believe it will be with me And
my mind feels beautifully clear now and settled Ive got your idea and
made it my own your idea that we matter scarcely at all but that the
work we do matters supremely Ill find my rope and tug it never fear
Half way round the world perhaps some day you will feel me tugging

I shall feel youre there he said whether you tug or not

Three miles left to Exeter he reported presently

She glanced back at Belinda

It is good that we have loved my dear she whispered Say it is
good

The best thing in all my life he said and lowered his head and voice
to say My dearest dear

Hearts desirestill

Hearts delight Priestess of life Divinity

She smiled and nodded and suddenly Belinda up above their lowered
heads accidentally and irrelevantly no doubt coughed

At Exeter Station there was not very much time to spare after all
Hardly had Sir Richmond secured a luncheon basket for the two travellers
before the train came into the station He parted from Miss Grammont
with a hand clasp Belinda was flushed and distressed at the last
but her friend was quiet and still Au revoir said Belinda without
conviction when Sir Richmond shook her hand

Section 8

Sir Richmond stood quite still on the platform as the train ran out of
the station He did not move until it had disappeared round the bend
Then he turned lost in a brown study and walked very slowly towards
the station exit

The most wonderful thing in my life he thought And alreadyit is
unreal

She will go on to her father whom she knows ten thousand times more
thoroughly than she knows me she will go on to Paris she will pick up
all the threads of her old story be reminded of endless things in her
life but never except in the most casual way of these days they will
be cut off from everything else that will serve to keep them real and
as for methis connects with nothing else in my life at all It is
as disconnected as a dream Already it is hardly more substantial
than a dream

We shall write letters Do letters breathe faster or slower as you read
them

We may meet

Where are we likely to meet again I never realized before how
improbable it is that we shall meet again And if we meet

Never in all our lives shall we be really TOGETHER again Its
overWith a completeness

Like death

He came opposite the bookstalls and stopped short and stared with
unseeing eyes at the display of popular literature He was wondering now
whether after all he ought to have let her go He experienced something
of the blank amazement of a child who has burst its toy balloon His
golden globe of satisfaction in an instant had gone An irrational sense
of loss was flooding every other feeling about VV If she had loved him
truly and altogether could she have left him like this Neither of them
surely had intended so complete a separation He wanted to go back and
recall that train

A few seconds more he realized and he would give way to anger
Whatever happened that must not happen He pulled himself together What
was it he had to do now He had not to be angry he had not even to be
sorry They had done the right thing Outside the station his car was
waiting

He went outside the station and stared at his car He had to go
somewhere Of course down into Cornwall to Martins cottage He had to
go down to her and be kind and comforting about that carbuncle To
be kind If this thwarted feeling broke out into anger he might be
tempted to take it out of Martin That at any rate he must not do He
had always for some inexplicable cause treated Martin badly Nagged her
and blamed her and threatened her That must stop now No shadow of this
affair must lie on Martin And Martin must never have a suspicion of
any of this

The image of Martin became very vivid in his mind He thought of her as
he had seen her many times with the tears close fighting with her back
to the wall with all her wit and vigour gone because she loved him
more steadfastly than he did her Whatever happened he must not take it
out of Martin It was astonishing how real she had become nowas VV
became a dream Yes Martin was astonishingly real And if only he could
go now and talk to Martinand face all the facts of life with her even
as he had done with that phantom Martin in his dream

But things were not like that

He looked to see if his car was short of water or petrol both needed
replenishing and so he would have to go up the hill into Exeter town
again He got into his car and sat with his fingers on the electric
starter

Martin Old Friend Eight days were still left before the Committee met
again eight days for golden kindness He would distress Martin by no
clumsy confession He would just make her happy as she loved to be made
happy Nevertheless Nevertheless

Was it Martin who failed him or he who failed Martin

Incessant and insoluble dispute Well the thing now was to go to
Martin And then the work

He laughed suddenly

Ill take it out of the damned Commission Ill make old Rumford Brown
sit up

He was astonished to find himself thinking of the affairs of the
Commission with a lively interest and no trace of fatigue He had
had his change he had taken his rest he was equal to his task again
already He started his engine and steered his way past a van and a
waiting cab

Fuel he said




CHAPTER THE NINTH

THE LAST DAYS OF SIR RICHMOND HARDY

Section 1

The Majority and Minority Reports of the Fuel Commission were received
on their first publication with much heat and disputation but there is
already a fairly general agreement that they are great and significant
documents broadly conceived and historically important They do lift
the questions of fuel supply and distribution high above the level of
parochial jealousies and above the petty and destructive profiteering of
private owners and traders to a view of a general human welfare They
form an important link in a series of private and public documents
that are slowly opening out a prospect of new economic methods methods
conceived in the generous spirit of scientific work that may yet arrest
the drift of our western civilization towards financial and commercial
squalor and the social collapse that must ensue inevitably on that
In view of the composition of the Committee the Majority Report is in
itself an amazing triumph of Sir Richmonds views it is astonishing
that he was able to drive his opponents so far and then leave them there
securely advanced while he carried on the adherents he had altogether
won including of course the labour representatives to the further
altitudes of the Minority Report

After the Summer recess the Majority Report was discussed and adopted
Sir Richmond had shown signs of flagging energy in June but he had
come back in September in a state of exceptional vigour for a time
he completely dominated the Committee by the passionate force of his
convictions and the illuminating scorn he brought to bear on the various
subterfuges and weakening amendments by which the meaner interests
sought to save themselves in whole or in part from the common duty of
sacrifice But toward the end he fell ill He had worked to the pitch of
exhaustion He neglected a cold that settled on his chest He began to
cough persistently and betray an increasingly irritable temper In the
last fights in the Committee his face was bright with fever and he spoke
in a voiceless whisper often a vast angry whisper His place at table
was marked with scattered lozenges and scraps of paper torn to the
minutest shreds Such good manners as had hitherto mitigated his
behaviour on the Committee departed from him He carried his last
points gesticulating and coughing and wheezing rather than speaking
But he had so hammered his ideas into the Committee that they took the
effect of what he was trying to say

He died of pneumonia at his own house three days after the passing of
the Majority Report The Minority Report his own especial creation he
never signed It was completed by Wast and Carmichael

After their parting at Salisbury station Dr Martineau heard very
little of Sir Richmond for a time except through the newspapers which
contained frequent allusions to the Committee Someone told him that Sir
Richmond had been staying at Ruan in Cornwall where Martin Leeds had a
cottage and someone else had met him at Bath on his way he said
in his car from Cornwall to a conference with Sir Peter Davies in
Glamorganshire

But in the interim Dr Martineau had the pleasure of meeting Lady Hardy
at a luncheon party He was seated next to her and he found her a very
pleasing and sympathetic person indeed She talked to him freely and
simply of her husband and of the journey the two men had taken together
Either she knew nothing of the circumstances of their parting or if she
did she did not betray her knowledge That holiday did him a world of
good she said He came back to his work like a giant I feel very
grateful to you

Dr Martineau said it was a pleasure to have helped Sir Richmonds work
in any way He believed in him thoroughly Sir Richmond was inspired by
great modern creative ideas

Forgive me if I keep you talking about him said Lady Hardy I wish I
could feel as sure that I had been of use to him

Dr Martineau insisted I know very well that you are

I do what I can to help him carry his enormous burthen of toil she
said I try to smooth his path But he is a strange silent creature at
times

Her eyes scrutinized the doctors face

It was not the doctors business to supplement Sir Richmonds silences
Yet he wished to meet the requirements of this lady if he could He is
one of those men he said who are driven by forces they do not fully
understand A man of genius

Yes she said in an undertone of intimacy Genius A great
irresponsible genius Difficult to help I wish I could do more
for him

A very sweet and charming lady It was with great regret that the doctor
found the time had come to turn to his lefthand neighbour

Section 2

It was with some surprise that Dr Martineau received a fresh appeal
for aid from Sir Richmond It was late in October and Sir Richmond was
already seriously ill But he was still going about his business as
though he was perfectly well He had not mistaken his man Dr Martineau
received him as though there had never been a shadow of offence between
them

He came straight to the point Martineau he said I must have those
drugs I asked you for when first I came to you now I must be bolstered
up I cant last out unless I am Im at the end of my energy I come to
you because you will understand The Commission cant go on now for more
than another three weeks Whatever happens afterwards I must keep going
until then

The doctor did understand He made no vain objections He did what he
could to patch up his friend for his last struggles with the opposition
in the Committee Pro forma he said stethoscope in hand I must
order you to bed You wont go But I order you You must know that
what you are doing is risking your life Your lungs are congested
the bronchial tubes already That may spread at any time If this open
weather lasts you may go about and still pull through But at any time
this may pass into pneumonia And theres not much in you just now to
stand up against pneumonia

Ill take all reasonable care

Is your wife at home

She is in Wales with her people But the household is well trained I
can manage

Go in a closed car from door to door Wrap up like a mummy I wish
the Committee room wasnt down those abominable House of Commons
corridors

They parted with an affectionate handshake

Section 3

Death approved of Sir Richmonds determination to see the Committee
through Our universal creditor gave this particular debtor grace to the
very last meeting Then he brushed a gust of chilly rain across the face
of Sir Richmond as he stood waiting for his car outside the strangers
entrance to the House For a couple of days Sir Richmond felt almost
intolerably tired but scarcely noted the changed timbre of the wheezy
notes in his throat He rose later each day and with ebbing vigour
jotted down notes and corrections upon the proofs of the Minority
Report He found it increasingly difficult to make decisions he would
correct and alter back and then repeat the correction perhaps half a
dozen times On the evening of the second day his lungs became painful
and his breathing difficult His head ached and a sense of some great
impending evil came upon him His skin was suddenly a detestable garment
to wear He took his temperature with a little clinical thermometer he
kept by him and found it was a hundred and one He telephoned hastily
for Dr Martineau and without waiting for his arrival took a hot bath
and got into bed He was already thoroughly ill when the doctor arrived

Forgive my sending for you he said Not your line I know My
wifes GPan exasperating sort of ass Cant stand him No one else

He was lying on a narrow little bed with a hard pillow that the doctor
replaced by one from Lady Hardys room He had twisted the bedclothes
into a hopeless muddle the sheet was on the floor

Sir Richmonds bedroom was a large apartment in which sleep seemed to
have been an admitted necessity rather than a principal purpose On one
hand it opened into a businesslike dressing and bath room on the other
into the day study It bore witness to the nocturnal habits of a man who
had long lived a life of irregular impulses to activity and dislocated
hours and habits There was a desk and reading lamp for night work near
the fireplace an electric kettle for making tea at night a silver
biscuit tin all the apparatus for the lonely intent industry of the
small hours There was a bookcase of bluebooks books of reference and
suchlike material and some files Over the mantelpiece was an enlarged
photograph of Lady Hardy and a plain office calendar The desk was
littered with the galley proofs of the Minority Report upon which Sir
Richmond had been working up to the moment of his hasty retreat to bed
And lying among the proofs as though it had been taken out and looked
at quite recently was the photograph of a girl For a moment Dr
Martineaus mind hung in doubt and then he knew it for the young
American of Stonehenge How that affair had ended he did not know And
now it was not his business to know

These various observations printed themselves on Dr Martineaus mind
after his first cursory examination of his patient and while he cast
about for anything that would give this large industrious apartment a
little more of the restfulness and comfort of a sick room I must
get in a night nurse at once he said We must find a small table
somewhere to put near the bed

I am afraid you are very ill he said returning to the bedside This
is not as you say my sort of work Will you let me call in another
man a man we can trust thoroughly to consult

Im in your hands said Sir Richmond I want to pull through

He will know better where to get the right sort of nurse for the
caseand everything

The second doctor presently came with the right sort of nurse hard on
his heels Sir Richmond submitted almost silently to his expert handling
and was sounded and looked to and listened at

Hm said the second doctor and then encouragingly to Sir Richmond
Weve got to take care of you

Theres a lot about this I dont like said the second doctor and
drew Dr Martineau by the arm towards the study For a moment or so Sir
Richmond listened to the low murmur of their voices but he did not feel
very deeply interested in what they were saying He began to think what
a decent chap Dr Martineau was how helpful and fine and forgiving his
professional training had made him how completely he had ignored the
smothered incivilities of their parting at Salisbury All men ought
to have some such training Not a bad idea to put every boy and girl
through a year or so of hospital service Sir Richmond must have
dozed for his next perception was of Dr Martineau standing over him
and saying I am afraid my dear Hardy that you are very ill indeed
Much more so than I thought you were at first

Sir Richmonds raised eyebrows conveyed that he accepted this fact

I think Lady Hardy ought to be sent for

Sir Richmond shook his head with unexpected vigour

Dont want her about he said and after a pause Dont want anybody
about

But if anything happens

Send then

An expression of obstinate calm overspread Sir Richmonds face He
seemed to regard the matter as settled He closed his eyes

For a time Dr Martineau desisted He went to the window and turned to
look again at the impassive figure on the bed Did Sir Richmond fully
understand He made a step towards his patient and hesitated Then he
brought a chair and sat down at the bedside

Sir Richmond opened his eyes and regarded him with a slight frown

A case of pneumonia said the doctor after great exertion and
fatigue may take very rapid and unexpected turns

Sir Richmond cheek on pillow seemed to assent

I think if you want to be sure that Lady Hardy sees you again If
you dont want to take risks about that One never knows in these
cases Probably there is a night train

Sir Richmond manifested no surprise at the warning But he stuck to his
point His voice was faint but firm Couldnt make up anything to say
to her Anything shed like

Dr Martineau rested on that for a little while Then he said If there
is anyone else

Not possible said Sir Richmond with his eyes on the ceiling

But to see

Sir Richmond turned his head to Dr Martineau His face puckered like
a peevish childs Theyd want things said to themThings to
rememberI CANT Im tired out

Dont trouble whispered Dr Martineau suddenly remorseful

But Sir Richmond was also remorseful Give them my love he said
Best loveOld Martin Love

Dr Martineau was turning away when Sir Richmond spoke again in a
whisper Best lovePoor at the best He dozed for a time Then he
made a great effort I cant see them Martineau until Ive something
to say Its like that Perhaps I shall think of some kind things to
sayafter a sleep But if they came nowId say something wrong
Be cross perhaps Hurt someone Ive hurt so many People
exaggeratePeople exaggerateimportance these occasions

Yes yes whispered Dr Martineau I quite understand

Section 4

For a time Sir Richmond dozed Then he stirred and muttered Second
rate Poor at the best Love Work All

It had been splendid work said Dr Martineau and was not sure that
Sir Richmond heard

Those last few days lost my grip Always lose my damned grip

Ragged them Put their backs upSilly

Never Never done anythingWELL

Its done Done Well or ill

Done

His voice sank to the faintest whisper Done for ever and ever and
ever and ever

Again he seemed to doze

Dr Martineau stood up softly Something beyond reason told him that
this was certainly a dying man He was reluctant to go and he had an
absurd desire that someone someone for whom Sir Richmond cared should
come and say goodbye to him and for Sir Richmond to say goodbye to
someone He hated this lonely launching from the shores of life of
one who had sought intimacy so persistently and vainly It was
extraordinaryhe saw it now for the first timehe loved this man If
it had been in his power he would at that moment have anointed him with
kindness

The doctor found himself standing in front of the untidy writing desk
littered like a recent battlefield The photograph of the American girl
drew his eyes What had happened Was there not perhaps some word for
her He turned about as if to enquire of the dying man and found Sir
Richmonds eyes open and regarding him In them he saw an expression he
had seen there once or twice before a faint but excessively irritating
gleam of amusement

OhWELL said Dr Martineau and turned away He went to the window
and stared out as his habit was

Sir Richmond continued to smile dimly at the doctors back until his
eyes closed again

It was their last exchange Sir Richmond died that night in the small
hours so quietly that for some time the night nurse did not observe
what had happened She was indeed roused to that realization by the
ringing of the telephone bell in the adjacent study

Section 5

For a long time that night Dr Martineau had lain awake unable to sleep
He was haunted by the figure of Sir Richmond lying on his uncomfortable
little bed in his big bedroom and by the curious effect of loneliness
produced by the nocturnal desk and by the evident dread felt by Sir
Richmond of any deathbed partings He realized how much this man who
had once sought so feverishly for intimacies had shrunken back upon
himself how solitary his motives had become how rarely he had taken
counsel with anyone in his later years His mind now dwelt apart Even
if people came about him he would still be facing death alone

And so it seemed he meant to slip out of life as a man might slip
out of a crowded assembly unobserved Even now he might be going The
doctor recalled how he and Sir Richmond had talked of the rage of life
in a young baby how we drove into life in a sort of fury how that rage
impelled us to do this and that how we fought and struggled until the
rage spent itself and was gone That eddy of rage that was Sir Richmond
was now perhaps very near its end Presently it would fade and cease
and the stream that had made it and borne it would know it no more

Dr Martineaus thoughts relaxed and passed into the picture land of
dreams He saw the figure of Sir Richmond going as it were away from
him along a narrow path a path that followed the crest of a ridge
between great darknesses enormous cloudy darknesses above him and
below He was going along this path without looking back without a
thought for those he left behind without a single word to cheer him
on his way walking as Dr Martineau had sometimes watched him walking
without haste or avidity walking as a man might along some great
picture gallery with which he was perhaps even over familiar His hands
would be in his pockets his indifferent eyes upon the clouds about him
And as he strolled along that path the darkness closed in upon him His
figure became dim and dimmer

Whither did that figure go Did that enveloping darkness hide the
beginnings of some strange long journey or would it just dissolve that
figure into itself

Was that indeed the end

Dr Martineau was one of that large class of people who can neither
imagine nor disbelieve in immortality Dimmer and dimmer grew the figure
but still it remained visible As one can continue to see a star at dawn
until one turns away Or one blinks or nods and it is gone

Vanished now are the beliefs that held our race for countless
generations Where now was that Path of the Dead mapped so clearly
faced with such certainty in which the heliolithic peoples believed
from Avebury to Polynesia Not always have we had to go alone and
unprepared into uncharted darknesses For a time the dream artist used a
palette of the doctors vague memories of things Egyptian he painted a
new roll of the Book of the Dead at a copy of which the doctor had been
looking a day or so before Sir Richmond became a brown naked figure
crossing a bridge of danger passing between terrific monsters ferrying
a dark and dreadful stream He came to the scales of judgment before the
very throne of Osiris and stood waiting while dogheaded Anubis weighed
his conscience and that evil monster the Devourer of the Dead
crouched ready if the judgment went against him The doctors attention
concentrated upon the scales A memory of Swedengorgs Heaven and Hell
mingled with the Egyptian fantasy Now at last it was possible to know
something real about this mans soul now at last one could look into
the Secret Places of his Heart Anubis and Thoth the god with the ibis
head were reading the heart as if it were a book reading aloud from it
to the supreme judge

Suddenly the doctor found himself in his own dreams His anxiety to
plead for his friend had brought him in He too had become a little
painted figure and he was bearing a book in his hand He wanted to show
that the laws of the new world could not be the same as those of the
old and the book he was bringing as evidence was his own Psychology of
a New Age

The clear thought of that book broke up his dream by releasing a train
of waking troubles You have been six months on Chapter Ten will it
ever be ready for Osiris will it ever be ready for print

Dream and waking thoughts were mingled like sky and cloud upon a windy
day in April Suddenly he saw again that lonely figure on the narrow way
with darknesses above and darknesses below and darknesses on every hand
But this time it was not Sir Richmond Who was it Surely it was
Everyman Everyman had to travel at last along that selfsame road
leaving love leaving every task and every desire But was it
Everyman A great fear and horror came upon the doctor That little
figure was himself And the book which was his particular task in life
was still undone He himself stood in his turn upon that lonely path
with the engulfing darknesses about him

He seemed to wrench himself awake

He lay very still for some moments and then he sat up in bed An
overwhelming conviction had arisenin his mind that Sir Richmond was
dead He felt he must know for certain He switched on his electric
light mutely interrogated his round face reflected in the looking
glass got out of bed shuffled on his slippers and went along the
passage to the telephone He hesitated for some seconds and then lifted
the receiver It was his call which aroused the nurse to the fact of Sir
Richmonds death

Section 6

Lady Hardy arrived home in response to Dr Martineaus telegram late
on the following evening He was with her next morning comforting
and sympathetic Her big blue eyes bright with tears met his very
wistfully her little body seemed very small and pathetic in its simple
black dress And yet there was a sort of bravery about her When he came
into the drawingroom she was in one of the window recesses talking to
a seriouslooking woman of the dressmaker type She left her business at
once to come to him Why did I not know in time she cried

No one dear lady had any idea until late last night he said taking
both her hands in his for a long friendly sympathetic pressure

I might have known that if it had been possible you would have told
me she said

You know she added I dont believe it yet I dont realize it I go
about these formalities

I think I can understand that

He was always you know not quite here It is as if he were a
little more not quite here I cant believe it is over

She asked a number of questions and took the doctors advice upon
various details of the arrangements My daughter Helen comes home
tomorrow afternoon she explained She is in Paris But our son is
far far away in the Punjab I have sent him a telegram It is so
kind of you to come in to me

Dr Martineau went more than half way to meet Lady Hardys disposition
to treat him as a friend of the family He had conceived a curious half
maternal affection for Sir Richmond that had survived even the trying
incident of the Salisbury parting and revived very rapidly during the
last few weeks This affection extended itself now to Lady Hardy Hers
was a type that had always appealed to him He could understand so well
the perplexed loyalty with which she was now setting herself to gather
together some preservative and reassuring evidences of this man who had
always been as she put it never quite here It was as if she felt
that now it was at last possible to make a definite reality of him He
could be fixed And as he was fixed he would stay Never more would he
be able to come in and with an almost expressionless glance wither the
interpretation she had imposed upon him She was finding much comfort
in this task of reconstruction She had gathered together in the
drawingroom every presentable portrait she had been able to find of him
He had never she said sat to a painter but there was an early pencil
sketch done within a couple of years of their marriage there was a
number of photographs several of whichshe wanted the doctors advice
upon this pointshe thought might be enlarged there was a statuette
done by some woman artist who had once beguiled him into a sitting
There was also a painting she had had worked up from a photograph and
some notes She flitted among these memorials going from one to the
other undecided which to make the standard portrait That painting
I think is most like she said as he was before the war But the war
and the Commission changed himworried him and aged him I grudged
him to that Commission He let it worry him frightfully

It meant very much to him said Dr Martineau

It meant too much to him But of course his ideas were splendid You
know it is one of my hopes to get some sort of book done explaining his
ideas He would never write He despised itunreasonably A real thing
done he said was better than a thousand books Nobody read books he
said but women parsons and idle people But there must be books And
I want one Something a little more real than the ordinary official
biography I have thought of young Leighton the secretary of the
Commission He seems thoroughly intelligent and sympathetic and really
anxious to reconcile Richmonds views with those of the big business men
on the Committee He might do Or perhaps I might be able to persuade
two or three people to write down their impressions of him A sort
of memorial volume But he was shy of friends There was no man he
talked to very intimately about his ideas unless it was to you I wish
I had the writers gift doctor

Section 7

It was on the second afternoon that Lady Hardy summoned Dr Martineau
by telephone Something rather disagreeable she said If you could
spare the time If you could come round

It is frightfully distressing she said when he got round to her and
for a time she could tell him nothing more She was having tea and she
gave him some She fussed about with cream and cakes and biscuits He
noted a crumpled letter thrust under the edge of the silver tray

He talked I know very intimately with you she said coming to it at
last He probably went into things with you that he never talked about
with anyone else Usually he was very reserved Even with me there were
things about which he said nothing

We did said Dr Martineau with discretion deal a little with his
private life

There was someone

Dr Martineau nodded and then not to be too portentous took and bit a
biscuit

Did he by any chance ever mention someone called Martin Leeds

Dr Martineau seemed to reflect Then realizing that this was a mistake
he said He told me the essential facts

The poor lady breathed a sigh of relief Im glad she said simply
She repeated Yes Im glad It makes things easier now

Dr Martineau looked his enquiry

She wants to come and see him

Here

Here And Helen here And the servants noticing everything Ive never
met her Never set eyes on her For all I know she may want to make a
scene There was infinite dismay in her voice

Dr Martineau was grave You would rather not receive her

I dont want to refuse her I dont want even to seem heartless
I understand of course she has a sort of claim She sobbed her
reluctant admission I know it I know There was much between
them

Dr Martineau pressed the limp hand upon the little tea table I
understand dear lady he said I understand Now  suppose _I_ were
to write to her and arrangeI do not see that you need be put to the
pain of meeting her Suppose I were to meet her here myself

If you COULD

The doctor was quite prepared to save the lady any further distresses
no matter at what trouble to himself You are so good to me she said
letting the tears have their way with her

I am silly to cry she said dabbing her eyes

We will get it over tomorrow he reassured her You need not think
of it again

He took over Martins brief note to Lady Hardy and set to work by
telegram to arrange for her visit She was in London at her Chelsea flat
and easily accessible She was to come to the house at midday on the
morrow and to ask not for Lady Hardy but for him He would stay by her
while she was in the house and it would be quite easy for Lady Hardy to
keep herself and her daughter out of the way They could for example
go out quietly to the dressmakers in the closed car for many little
things about the mourning still remained to be seen to

Section 8

Miss Martin Leeds arrived punctually but the doctor was well ahead of
his time and ready to receive her She was ushered into the drawing room
where he awaited her As she came forward the doctor first perceived
that she had a very sad and handsome face the face of a sensitive youth
rather than the face of a woman She had fine grey eyes under very
fine brows they were eyes that at other times might have laughed very
agreeably but which were now full of an unrestrained sadness Her brown
hair was very untidy and parted at the side like a mans Then he noted
that she seemed to be very untidily dressed as if she was that rare and
to him very offensive thing a woman careless of her beauty She was
short in proportion to her broad figure and her broad forehead

You are Dr Martineau she said He talked of you As she spoke
her glance went from him to the pictures that stood about the room She
walked up to the painting and stood in front of it with her distressed
gaze wandering about her Horrible she said Absolutely horrible
Did SHE do this

Her question disconcerted the doctor very much You mean Lady Hardy
he asked She doesnt paint

No no I mean did she get all these things together

Naturally said Dr Martineau

None of them are a bit like him They are like blows aimed at his
memory Not one has his life in it How could she do it Look at that
idiot statuette He was extraordinarily difficult to get I have
burnt every photograph I had of him For fear that this would happen
that he would go stiff and formaljust as you have got him here I have
been trying to sketch him almost all the time since he died But I cant
get him back Hes gone

She turned to the doctor again She spoke to him not as if she expected
him to understand her but because she had to say these things which
burthened her mind to someone I have done hundreds of sketches My
room is littered with them When you turn them over he seems to be
lurking among them But not one of them is like him

She was trying to express something beyond her power It is as if
someone had suddenly turned out the light

She followed the doctor upstairs This was his study the doctor
explained

I know it I came here once she said

They entered the big bedroom in which the coffined body lay Dr
Martineau struck by a sudden memory glanced nervously at the desk but
someone had made it quite tidy and the portrait of Aliss Grammont had
disappeared Miss Leeds walked straight across to the coffin and
stood looking down on the waxen inexpressive dignity of the dead Sir
Richmonds brows and nose had become sharper and more clearcut than
they had ever been in life and his lips had set into a faint inane
smile She stood quite still for a long time At length she sighed
deeply

She spoke a little as though she thought aloud a little as though she
talked at that silent presence in the coffin I think he loved she
said Sometimes I think he loved me But it is hard to tell He was
kind He could be intensely kind and yet he didnt seem to care for
you He could be intensely selfish and yet he certainly did not care for
himself Anyhow I loved HIM There is nothing left in me now to
love anyone elsefor ever

She put her hands behind her back and looked at the dead man with her
head a little on one side Too kind she said very softly

There was a sort of dishonesty in his kindness He would not let you
have the bitter truth He would not say he did not love you

He was too kind to life ever to call it the foolish thing it is He
took it seriously because it takes itself seriously He worked for it
and killed himself with work for it

She turned to Dr Martineau and her face was streaming with tears
And life you know isnt to be taken seriously It is a jokea
bad jokemade by some cruel little god who has caught a neglected
planet Like torturing a stray cat But he took it seriously and
he gave up his life for it

There was much happiness he might have had He was very capable of
happiness But he never seemed happy This work of his came before
it He overworked and fretted our happiness away He sacrificed his
happiness and mine

She held out her hands towards the doctor What am I to do now with the
rest of my life Who is there to laugh with me now and jest

I dont complain of him I dont blame him He did his bestto be
kind

But all my days now I shall mourn for him and long for him

She turned back to the coffin Suddenly she lost every vestige of
selfcontrol She sank down on her knees beside the trestle Why have
you left me she cried

Oh Speak to me my darling Speak to me I TELL YOU Speak to me

It was a storm of passion monstrously childish and dreadful She beat
her hands upon the coffin She wept loudly and fiercely as a child
does

Dr Martineau drifted feebly to the window

He wished he had locked the door The servants might hear and wonder
what it was all about Always he had feared love for the cruel thing it
was but now it seemed to him for the first time that he realized its
monstrous cruelty

Section 2 Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergtm

Project Gutenbergtm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete old middleaged and new computers It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need is critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergtm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergtm and future generations

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
