TO THE DAUGHTERS OF THE WOLF WHO HAVE BRED AND SUCKLED A RACE OF MEN




THE GOD OF HIS FATHERS


I


On every hand stretched the forest primevalthe home of noisy comedy
and silent tragedy Here the struggle for survival continued to wage
with all its ancient brutality Briton and Russian were still to overlap
in the Land of the Rainbows Endand this was the very heart of itnor
had Yankee gold yet purchased its vast domain The wolfpack still clung
to the flank of the caribooherd singling out the weak and the big with
calf and pulling them down as remorselessly as were it a thousand
thousand generations into the past The sparse aborigines still
acknowledged the rule of their chiefs and medicine men drove out bad
spirits burned their witches fought their neighbors and ate their
enemies with a relish which spoke well of their bellies But it was at
the moment when the stone age was drawing to a close Already over
unknown trails and chartless wildernesses were the harbingers of the
steel arrivingfairfaced blueeyed indomitable men incarnations of
the unrest of their race By accident or design singlehanded and in
twos and threes they came from no one knew whither and fought or died
or passed on no one knew whence The priests raged against them the
chiefs called forth their fighting men and stone clashed with steel but
to little purpose Like water seeping from some mighty reservoir they
trickled through the dark forests and mountain passes threading the
highways in bark canoes or with their moccasined feet breaking trail for
the wolfdogs They came of a great breed and their mothers were many
but the furclad denizens of the Northland had this yet to learn So
many an unsung wanderer fought his last and died under the cold fire of
the aurora as did his brothers in burning sands and reeking jungles and
as they shall continue to do till in the fulness of time the destiny of
their race be achieved

It was near twelve Along the northern horizon a rosy glow fading to
the west and deepening to the east marked the unseen dip of the midnight
sun The gloaming and the dawn were so commingled that there was no
nightsimply a wedding of day with day a scarcely perceptible blending
of two circles of the sun A kildee timidly chirped goodnight the
full rich throat of a robin proclaimed goodmorrow From an island on
the breast of the Yukon a colony of wild fowl voiced its interminable
wrongs while a loon laughed mockingly back across a still stretch of
river

In the foreground against the bank of a lazy eddy birchbark canoes
were lined two and three deep Ivorybladed spears bonebarbed arrows
buckskinthonged bows and simple basketwoven traps bespoke the fact
that in the muddy current of the river the salmonrun was on In the
background from the tangle of skin tents and drying frames rose the
voices of the fisher folk Bucks skylarked with bucks or flirted with
the maidens while the older squaws shut out from this by virtue of
having fulfilled the end of their existence in reproduction gossiped as
they braided rope from the green roots of trailing vines At their feet
their naked progeny played and squabbled or rolled in the muck with the
tawny wolfdogs

To one side of the encampment and conspicuously apart from it stood a
second camp of two tents But it was a white mans camp If nothing
else the choice of position at least bore convincing evidence of this
In case of offence it commanded the Indian quarters a hundred yards
away of defence a rise to the ground and the cleared intervening space
and last of defeat the swift slope of a score of yards to the canoes
below From one of the tents came the petulant cry of a sick child and
the crooning song of a mother In the open over the smouldering embers
of a fire two men held talk

Eh I love the church like a good son _Bien_ So great a love that
my days have been spent in fleeing away from her and my nights in
dreaming dreams of reckoning Look you The halfbreeds voice rose to
an angry snarl I am Red River born My father was whiteas white as
you But you are Yankee and he was British bred and a gentlemans son
And my mother was the daughter of a chief and I was a man Ay and one
had to look the second time to see what manner of blood ran in my veins
for I lived with the whites and was one of them and my fathers heart
beat in me It happened there was a maidenwhitewho looked on me with
kind eyes Her father had much land and many horses also he was a big
man among his people and his blood was the blood of the French He said
the girl knew not her own mind and talked overmuch with her and became
wroth that such things should be

But she knew her mind for we came quick before the priest And quicker
had come her father with lying words false promises I know not what
so that the priest stiffened his neck and would not make us that we might
live one with the other As at the beginning it was the church which
would not bless my birth so now it was the church which refused me
marriage and put the blood of men upon my hands _Bien_ Thus have I
cause to love the church So I struck the priest on his womans mouth
and we took swift horses the girl and I to Fort Pierre where was a
minister of good heart But hot on our trail was her father and
brothers and other men he had gathered to him And we fought our
horses on the run till I emptied three saddles and the rest drew off and
went on to Fort Pierre Then we took east the girl and I to the hills
and forests and we lived one with the other and we were not
marriedthe work of the good church which I love like a son

But mark you for this is the strangeness of woman the way of which no
man may understand One of the saddles I emptied was that of her
fathers and the hoofs of those who came behind had pounded him into the
earth This we saw the girl and I and this I had forgot had she not
remembered And in the quiet of the evening after the days hunt were
done it came between us and in the silence of the night when we lay
beneath the stars and should have been one It was there always She
never spoke but it sat by our fire and held us ever apart She tried to
put it aside but at such times it would rise up till I could read it in
the look of her eyes in the very intake of her breath

So in the end she bore me a child a womanchild and died Then I went
among my mothers people that it might nurse at a warm breast and live
But my hands were wet with the blood of men look you because of the
church wet with the blood of men And the Riders of the North came for
me but my mothers brother who was then chief in his own right hid me
and gave me horses and food And we went away my womanchild and I
even to the Hudson Bay Country where white men were few and the
questions they asked not many And I worked for the company a hunter as
a guide as a driver of dogs till my womanchild was become a woman
tall and slender and fair to the eye

You know the winter long and lonely breeding evil thoughts and bad
deeds The Chief Factor was a hard man and bold And he was not such
that a woman would delight in looking upon But he cast eyes upon my
womanchild who was become a woman Mother of God he sent me away on a
long trip with the dogs that he mightyou understand he was a hard man
and without heart She was most white and her soul was white and a
good woman andwell she died

It was bitter cold the night of my return and I had been away months
and the dogs were limping sore when I came to the fort The Indians and
breeds looked on me in silence and I felt the fear of I knew not what
but I said nothing till the dogs were fed and I had eaten as a man with
work before him should Then I spoke up demanding the word and they
shrank from me afraid of my anger and what I should do but the story
came out the pitiful story word for word and act for act and they
marvelled that I should be so quiet

When they had done I went to the Factors house calmer than now in the
telling of it He had been afraid and called upon the breeds to help
him but they were not pleased with the deed and had left him to lie on
the bed he had made So he had fled to the house of the priest Thither
I followed But when I was come to that place the priest stood in my
way and spoke soft words and said a man in anger should go neither to
the right nor left but straight to God I asked by the right of a
fathers wrath that he give me past but he said only over his body and
besought with me to pray Look you it was the church always the
church for I passed over his body and sent the Factor to meet my woman
child before his god which is a bad god and the god of the white men

Then was there hue and cry for word was sent to the station below and
I came away Through the Land of the Great Slave down the Valley of the
Mackenzie to the neveropening ice over the White Rockies past the
Great Curve of the Yukon even to this place did I come And from that
day to this yours is the first face of my fathers people I have looked
upon May it be the last These people which are my people are a
simple folk and I have been raised to honor among them My word is
their law and their priests but do my bidding else would I not suffer
them When I speak for them I speak for myself We ask to be let alone
We do not want your kind If we permit you to sit by our fires after
you will come your church your priests and your gods And know this
for each white man who comes to my village him will I make deny his god
You are the first and I give you grace So it were well you go and go
quickly

I am not responsible for my brothers the second man spoke up filling
his pipe in a meditative manner Hay Stockard was at times as thoughtful
of speech as he was wanton of action but only at times

But I know your breed responded the other Your brothers are many
and it is you and yours who break the trail for them to follow In time
they shall come to possess the land but not in my time Already have I
heard are they on the headreaches of the Great River and far away
below are the Russians

Hay Stockard lifted his head with a quick start This was startling
geographical information The Hudson Bay post at Fort Yukon had other
notions concerning the course of the river believing it to flow into the
Arctic

Then the Yukon empties into Bering Sea he asked

I do not know but below there are Russians many Russians Which is
neither here nor there You may go on and see for yourself you may go
back to your brothers but up the Koyukuk you shall not go while the
priests and fighting men do my bidding Thus do I command I Baptiste
the Red whose word is law and who am head man over this people

And should I not go down to the Russians or back to my brothers

Then shall you go swiftfooted before your god which is a bad god and
the god of the white men

The red sun shot up above the northern skyline dripping and bloody
Baptiste the Red came to his feet nodded curtly and went back to his
camp amid the crimson shadows and the singing of the robins

Hay Stockard finished his pipe by the fire picturing in smoke and coal
the unknown upper reaches of the Koyukuk the strange stream which ended
here its arctic travels and merged its waters with the muddy Yukon flood
Somewhere up there if the dying words of a shipwrecked sailorman who
had made the fearful overland journey were to be believed and if the
vial of golden grains in his pouch attested anythingsomewhere up
there in that home of winter stood the Treasure House of the North And
as keeper of the gate Baptiste the Red English halfbreed and renegade
barred the way

Bah He kicked the embers apart and rose to his full height arms
lazily outstretched facing the flushing north with careless soul



II


Hay Stockard swore harshly in the rugged monosyllables of his mother
tongue His wife lifted her gaze from the pots and pans and followed
his in a keen scrutiny of the river She was a woman of the Teslin
Country wise in the ways of her husbands vernacular when it grew
intensive From the slipping of a snowshoe thong to the forefront of
sudden death she could gauge occasion by the pitch and volume of his
blasphemy So she knew the present occasion merited attention A long
canoe with paddles flashing back the rays of the westering sun was
crossing the current from above and urging in for the eddy Hay Stockard
watched it intently Three men rose and dipped rose and dipped in
rhythmical precision but a red bandanna wrapped about the head of one
caught and held his eye

Bill he called Oh Bill

A shambling loosejointed giant rolled out of one of the tents yawning
and rubbing the sleep from his eyes Then he sighted the strange canoe
and was wide awake on the instant

By the jumping Methuselah That damned skypilot

Hay Stockard nodded his head bitterly halfreached for his rifle then
shrugged his shoulders

Potshot him Bill suggested and settle the thing out of hand Hell
spoil us sure if we dont But the other declined this drastic measure
and turned away at the same time bidding the woman return to her work
and calling Bill back from the bank The two Indians in the canoe moored
it on the edge of the eddy while its white occupant conspicuous by his
gorgeous headgear came up the bank

Like Paul of Tarsus I give you greeting Peace be unto you and grace
before the Lord

His advances were met sullenly and without speech

To you Hay Stockard blasphemer and Philistine greeting In your
heart is the lust of Mammon in your mind cunning devils in your tent
this woman whom you live with in adultery yet of these divers sins even
here in the wilderness I Sturges Owen apostle to the Lord bid you to
repent and cast from you your iniquities

Save your cant Save your cant Hay Stockard broke in testily Youll
need all youve got and more for Red Baptiste over yonder

He waved his hand toward the Indian camp where the halfbreed was
looking steadily across striving to make out the newcomers Sturges
Owen disseminator of light and apostle to the Lord stepped to the edge
of the steep and commanded his men to bring up the camp outfit Stockard
followed him

Look here he demanded plucking the missionary by the shoulder and
twirling him about Do you value your hide

My life is in the Lords keeping and I do but work in His vineyard he
replied solemnly

Oh stow that Are you looking for a job of martyrship

If He so wills

Well youll find it right here but Im going to give you some advice
first Take it or leave it If you stop here youll be cut off in the
midst of your labors And not you alone but your men Bill my wife

Who is a daughter of Belial and hearkeneth not to the true Gospel

And myself Not only do you bring trouble upon yourself but upon us I
was frozen in with you last winter as you will well recollect and I
know you for a good man and a fool If you think it your duty to strive
with the heathen well and good but do exercise some wit in the way you
go about it This man Red Baptiste is no Indian He comes of our
common stock is as bullnecked as I ever dared be and as wild a fanatic
the one way as you are the other When you two come together hellll be
to pay and I dont care to be mixed up in it Understand So take my
advice and go away If you go downstream youll fall in with the
Russians Theres bound to be Greek priests among them and theyll see
you safe through to Bering Seathats where the Yukon emptiesand
from there it wont be hard to get back to civilization Take my word
for it and get out of here as fast as Godll let you

He who carries the Lord in his heart and the Gospel in his hand hath no
fear of the machinations of man or devil the missionary answered
stoutly I will see this man and wrestle with him One backslider
returned to the fold is a greater victory than a thousand heathen He
who is strong for evil can be as mighty for good witness Saul when he
journeyed up to Damascus to bring Christian captives to Jerusalem And
the voice of the Saviour came to him crying Saul Saul why
persecutest thou me And therewith Paul arrayed himself on the side of
the Lord and thereafter was most mighty in the saving of souls And
even as thou Paul of Tarsus even so do I work in the vineyard of the
Lord bearing trials and tribulations scoffs and sneers stripes and
punishments for His dear sake

Bring up the little bag with the tea and a kettle of water he called
the next instant to his boatmen not forgetting the haunch of cariboo
and the mixingpan

When his men converts by his own hand had gained the bank the trio
fell to their knees hands and backs burdened with camp equipage and
offered up thanks for their passage through the wilderness and their safe
arrival Hay Stockard looked upon the function with sneering
disapproval the romance and solemnity of it lost to his matteroffact
soul Baptiste the Red still gazing across recognized the familiar
postures and remembered the girl who had shared his starroofed couch in
the hills and forests and the womanchild who lay somewhere by bleak
Hudsons Bay



III


Confound it Baptiste couldnt think of it Not for a moment Grant
that this man is a fool and of small use in the nature of things but
still you know I cant give him up

Hay Stockard paused striving to put into speech the rude ethics of his
heart

Hes worried me Baptiste in the past and now and caused me all manner
of troubles but cant you see hes my own breedwhiteandandwhy
I couldnt buy my life with his not if he was a nigger

So be it Baptiste the Red made answer I have given you grace and
choice I shall come presently with my priests and fighting men and
either shall I kill you or you deny your god Give up the priest to my
pleasure and you shall depart in peace Otherwise your trail ends here
My people are against you to the babies Even now have the children
stolen away your canoes He pointed down to the river Naked boys had
slipped down the water from the point above cast loose the canoes and
by then had worked them into the current When they had drifted out of
rifleshot they clambered over the sides and paddled ashore

Give me the priest and you may have them back again Come Speak your
mind but without haste

Stockard shook his head His glance dropped to the woman of the Teslin
Country with his boy at her breast and he would have wavered had he not
lifted his eyes to the men before him

I am not afraid Sturges Owen spoke up The Lord bears me in his
right hand and alone am I ready to go into the camp of the unbeliever
It is not too late Faith may move mountains Even in the eleventh hour
may I win his soul to the true righteousness

Trip the beggar up and make him fast Bill whispered hoarsely in the
ear of his leader while the missionary kept the floor and wrestled with
the heathen Make him hostage and bore him if they get ugly

No Stockard answered I gave him my word that he could speak with us
unmolested Rules of warfare Bill rules of warfare Hes been on the
square given us warning and all that andwhy damn it man I cant
break my word

Hell keep his never fear

Dont doubt it but I wont let a halfbreed outdo me in fair dealing
Why not do what he wantsgive him the missionary and be done with it

Nno Bill hesitated doubtfully

Shoe pinches eh

Bill flushed a little and dropped the discussion Baptiste the Red was
still waiting the final decision Stockard went up to him

Its this way Baptiste I came to your village minded to go up the
Koyukuk I intended no wrong My heart was clean of evil It is still
clean Along comes this priest as you call him I didnt bring him
here Hed have come whether I was here or not But now that he is
here being of my people Ive got to stand by him And Im going to
Further it will be no childs play When you have done your village
will be silent and empty your people wasted as after a famine True we
will he gone likewise the pick of your fighting men

But those who remain shall be in peace nor shall the word of strange
gods and the tongues of strange priests be buzzing in their ears

Both men shrugged their shoulder and turned away the halfbreed going
back to his own camp The missionary called his two men to him and they
fell into prayer Stockard and Bill attacked the few standing pines with
their axes felling them into convenient breastworks The child had
fallen asleep so the woman placed it on a heap of furs and lent a hand
in fortifying the camp Three sides were thus defended the steep
declivity at the rear precluding attack from that direction When these
arrangements had been completed the two men stalked into the open
clearing away here and there the scattered underbrush From the
opposing camp came the booming of wardrums and the voices of the priests
stirring the people to anger

Worst of it is theyll come in rushes Bill complained as they walked
back with shouldered axes

And wait till midnight when the light gets dim for shooting

Cant start the ball arolling too early then Bill exchanged the axe
for a rifle and took a careful rest One of the medicinemen towering
above his tribesmen stood out distinctly Bill drew a bead on him

All ready he asked

Stockard opened the ammunition box placed the woman where she could
reload in safety and gave the word The medicineman dropped For a
moment there was silence then a wild howl went up and a flight of bone
arrows fell short

Id like to take a look at the beggar Bill remarked throwing a fresh
shell into place Ill swear I drilled him clean between the eyes

Didnt work Stockard shook his head gloomily Baptiste had evidently
quelled the more warlike of his followers and instead of precipitating
an attack in the bright light of day the shot had caused a hasty exodus
the Indians drawing out of the village beyond the zone of fire

In the full tide of his proselyting fervor borne along by the hand of
God Sturges Owen would have ventured alone into the camp of the
unbeliever equally prepared for miracle or martyrdom but in the waiting
which ensued the fever of conviction died away gradually as the natural
man asserted itself Physical fear replaced spiritual hope the love of
life the love of God It was no new experience He could feel his
weakness coming on and knew it of old time He had struggled against it
and been overcome by it before He remembered when the other men had
driven their paddles like mad in the van of a roaring iceflood how at
the critical moment in a panic of worldly terror he had dropped his
paddle and besought wildly with his God for pity And there were other
times The recollection was not pleasant It brought shame to him that
his spirit should be so weak and his flesh so strong But the love of
life the love of life He could not strip it from him Because of it
had his dim ancestors perpetuated their line because of it was he
destined to perpetuate his His courage if courage it might be called
was bred of fanaticism The courage of Stockard and Bill was the
adherence to deeprooted ideals Not that the love of life was less but
the love of race tradition more not that they were unafraid to die but
that they were brave enough not to live at the price of shame

The missionary rose for the moment swayed by the mood of sacrifice He
half crawled over the barricade to proceed to the other camp but sank
back a trembling mass wailing As the spirit moves As the spirit
moves Who am I that I should set aside the judgments of God Before
the foundations of the world were all things written in the book of life
Worm that I am shall I erase the page or any portion thereof As God
wills so shall the spirit move

Bill reached over plucked him to his feet and shook him fiercely
silently Then he dropped the bundle of quivering nerves and turned his
attention to the two converts But they showed little fright and a
cheerful alacrity in preparing for the coming passage at arms

Stockard who had been talking in undertones with the Teslin woman now
turned to the missionary

Fetch him over here he commanded of Bill

Now he ordered when Sturges Owen had been duly deposited before him
make us man and wife and be lively about it Then he added
apologetically to Bill No telling how its to end so I just thought
Id get my affairs straightened up

The woman obeyed the behest of her white lord To her the ceremony was
meaningless By her lights she was his wife and had been from the day
they first foregathered The converts served as witnesses Bill stood
over the missionary prompting him when he stumbled Stockard put the
responses in the womans mouth and when the time came for want of
better ringed her finger with thumb and forefinger of his own

Kiss the bride Bill thundered and Sturges Owen was too weak to
disobey

Now baptize the child

Neat and tidy Bill commented

Gathering the proper outfit for a new trail the father explained
taking the boy from the mothers arms I was grubstaked once into
the Cascades and had everything in the kit except salt Never shall
forget it And if the woman and the kid cross the divide tonight they
might as well be prepared for potluck A long shot Bill between
ourselves but nothing lost if it misses

A cup of water served the purpose and the child was laid away in a
secure corner of the barricade The men built the fire and the evening
meal was cooked

The sun hurried round to the north sinking closer to the horizon The
heavens in that quarter grew red and bloody The shadows lengthened the
light dimmed and in the sombre recesses of the forest life slowly died
away Even the wild fowl in the river softened their raucous chatter and
feigned the nightly farce of going to bed Only the tribesmen increased
their clamor wardrums booming and voices raised in savage folk songs
But as the sun dipped they ceased their tumult The rounded hush of
midnight was complete Stockard rose to his knees and peered over the
logs Once the child wailed in pain and disconcerted him The mother
bent over it but it slept again The silence was interminable
profound Then of a sudden the robins burst into fullthroated song
The night had passed

A flood of dark figures boiled across the open Arrows whistled and bow
thongs sang The shrilltongued rifles answered back A spear and a
mighty cast transfixed the Teslin woman as she hovered above the child
A spent arrow diving between the logs lodged in the missionarys arm

There was no stopping the rush The middle distance was cumbered with
bodies but the rest surged on breaking against and over the barricade
like an ocean wave Sturges Owen fled to the tent while the men were
swept from their feet buried beneath the human tide Hay Stockard alone
regained the surface flinging the tribesmen aside like yelping curs He
had managed to seize an axe A dark hand grasped the child by a naked
foot and drew it from beneath its mother At arms length its puny body
circled through the air dashing to death against the logs Stockard
clove the man to the chin and fell to clearing space The ring of savage
faces closed in raining upon him spearthrusts and bonebarbed arrows
The sun shot up and they swayed back and forth in the crimson shadows
Twice with his axe blocked by too deep a blow they rushed him but each
time he flung them clear They fell underfoot and he trampled dead and
dying the way slippery with blood And still the day brightened and the
robins sang Then they drew back from him in awe and he leaned
breathless upon his axe

Blood of my soul cried Baptiste the Red But thou art a man Deny
thy god and thou shalt yet live

Stockard swore his refusal feebly but with grace

Behold A woman Sturges Owen had been brought before the halfbreed

Beyond a scratch on the arm he was uninjured but his eyes roved about
him in an ecstasy of fear The heroic figure of the blasphemer
bristling with wounds and arrows leaning defiantly upon his axe
indifferent indomitable superb caught his wavering vision And he
felt a great envy of the man who could go down serenely to the dark gates
of death Surely Christ and not he Sturges Owen had been moulded in
such manner And why not he He felt dimly the curse of ancestry the
feebleness of spirit which had come down to him out of the past and he
felt an anger at the creative force symbolize it as he would which had
formed him its servant so weakly For even a stronger man this anger
and the stress of circumstance were sufficient to breed apostasy and for
Sturges Owen it was inevitable In the fear of mans anger he would dare
the wrath of God He had been raised up to serve the Lord only that he
might be cast down He had been given faith without the strength of
faith he had been given spirit without the power of spirit It was
unjust

Where now is thy god the halfbreed demanded

I do not know He stood straight and rigid like a child repeating a
catechism

Hast thou then a god at all

I had

And now

No

Hay Stockard swept the blood from his eyes and laughed The missionary
looked at him curiously as in a dream A feeling of infinite distance
came over him as though of a great remove In that which had
transpired and which was to transpire he had no part He was a
spectatorat a distance yes at a distance The words of Baptiste came
to him faintly

Very good See that this man go free and that no harm befall him Let
him depart in peace Give him a canoe and food Set his face toward the
Russians that he may tell their priests of Baptiste the Red in whose
country there is no god

They led him to the edge of the steep where they paused to witness the
final tragedy The halfbreed turned to Hay Stockard

There is no god he prompted

The man laughed in reply One of the young men poised a warspear for
the cast

Hast thou a god

Ay the God of my fathers

He shifted the axe for a better grip Baptiste the Red gave the sign
and the spear hurtled full against his breast Sturges Owen saw the
ivory head stand out beyond his back saw the man sway laughing and
snap the shaft short as he fell upon it Then he went down to the river
that he might carry to the Russians the message of Baptiste the Red in
whose country there was no god




THE GREAT INTERROGATION


I


To say the least Mrs Saythers career in Dawson was meteoric She
arrived in the spring with dog sleds and FrenchCanadian _voyageurs_
blazed gloriously for a brief month and departed up the river as soon as
it was free of ice Now womanless Dawson never quite understood this
hurried departure and the local Four Hundred felt aggrieved and lonely
till the Nome strike was made and old sensations gave way to new For it
had delighted in Mrs Sayther and received her widearmed She was
pretty charming and moreover a widow And because of this she at
once had at heel any number of Eldorado Kings officials and adventuring
younger sons whose ears were yearning for the froufrou of a womans
skirts

The mining engineers revered the memory of her husband the late Colonel
Sayther while the syndicate and promoter representatives spoke awesomely
of his deals and manipulations for he was known down in the States as a
great mining man and as even a greater one in London Why his widow of
all women should have come into the country was the great
interrogation But they were a practical breed the men of the
Northland with a wholesome disregard for theories and a firm grip on
facts And to not a few of them Karen Sayther was a most essential fact
That she did not regard the matter in this light is evidenced by the
neatness and celerity with which refusal and proposal tallied off during
her four weeks stay And with her vanished the fact and only the
interrogation remained

To the solution Chance vouchsafed one clew Her last victim Jack
Coughran having fruitlessly laid at her feet both his heart and a five
hundredfoot creek claim on Bonanza celebrated the misfortune by walking
all of a night with the gods In the midwatch of this night he happened
to rub shoulders with Pierre Fontaine none other than head man of Karen
Saythers _voyageurs_ This rubbing of shoulders led to recognition and
drinks and ultimately involved both men in a common muddle of inebriety

Heh Pierre Fontaine later on gurgled thickly Vot for Madame Sayther
mak visitation to thees country More better you spik wit her I know
no ting tall only all de tam her ask one mans name Pierre her
spik wit me Pierre you moos find thees mans and I gif you moochone

Heh Ah _oui_ One tam dose mens vot come from Circle City dose mens

_Bon_ and look happy lak anyting And her spik wit me Pierre
her spik harness de dogs We go queek We find thees mans I gif you

For sure I tink das two thousand dollar mine Bully boy Den more

_Oui msieu_ Thees day madame spik Pierre her spik and gif me
five hundred dollar go buy polingboat Tomorrow we go up de river
Ah _oui_ tomorrow up de river and das dam Sitka Charley mak me pay
for de polingboat five hundred dollar Dam

Thus it was when Jack Coughran unburdened himself next day that Dawson
fell to wondering who was this David Payne and in what way his existence
bore upon Karen Saythers But that very day as Pierre Fontaine had
said Mrs Sayther and her barbaric crew of _voyageurs_ towed up the east
bank to Klondike City shot across to the west bank to escape the bluffs
and disappeared amid the maze of islands to the south



II


_Oui madame_ thees is de place One two tree island below Stuart
River Thees is tree island

As he spoke Pierre Fontaine drove his pole against the bank and held the
stern of the boat against the current This thrust the bow in till a
nimble breed climbed ashore with the painter and made fast

One leel tam madame I go look see

A chorus of dogs marked his disappearance over the edge of the bank but
a minute later he was back again

_Oui madame_ thees is de cabin I mak investigation No can find
mans at home But him no go vaire far vaire long or him no leave dogs
Him come queek you bet

Help me out Pierre Im tired all over from the boat You might have
made it softer you know

From a nest of furs amidships Karen Sayther rose to her full height of
slender fairness But if she looked lilyfrail in her elemental
environment she was belied by the grip she put upon Pierres hand by
the knotting of her womans biceps as it took the weight of her body by
the splendid effort of her limbs as they held her out from the
perpendicular bank while she made the ascent Though shapely flesh
clothed delicate frame her body was a seat of strength

Still for all the careless ease with which she had made the landing
there was a warmer color than usual to her face and a perceptibly extra
beat to her heart But then also it was with a certain reverent
curiousness that she approached the cabin while the Hush on her cheek
showed a yet riper mellowness

Look see Pierre pointed to the scattered chips by the woodpile Him
freshtwo tree day no more

Mrs Sayther nodded She tried to peer through the small window but it
was made of greased parchment which admitted light while it blocked
vision Failing this she went round to the door half lifted the rude
latch to enter but changed her mind and let it fall back into place
Then she suddenly dropped on one knee and kissed the roughhewn
threshold If Pierre Fontaine saw he gave no sign and the memory in
the time to come was never shared But the next instant one of the
boatmen placidly lighting his pipe was startled by an unwonted
harshness in his captains voice

Hey You Le Goire You makm soft more better Pierre commanded
Plenty bearskin plenty blanket Dam

But the nest was soon after disrupted and the major portion tossed up to
the crest of the shore where Mrs Sayther lay down to wait in comfort

Reclining on her side she looked out and over the widestretching Yukon
Above the mountains which lay beyond the further shore the sky was murky
with the smoke of unseen forest fires and through this the afternoon sun
broke feebly throwing a vague radiance to earth and unreal shadows To
the skyline of the four quartersspruceshrouded islands dark waters
and icescarred rocky ridgesstretched the immaculate wilderness No
sign of human existence broke the solitude no sound the stillness The
land seemed bound under the unreality of the unknown wrapped in the
brooding mystery of great spaces

Perhaps it was this which made Mrs Sayther nervous for she changed her
position constantly now to look up the river now down or to scan the
gloomy shores for the halfhidden mouths of back channels After an hour
or so the boatmen were sent ashore to pitch camp for the night but
Pierre remained with his mistress to watch

Ah him come thees tam he whispered after a long silence his gaze
bent up the river to the head of the island

A canoe with a paddle flashing on either side was slipping down the
current In the stern a mans form and in the bow a womans swung
rhythmically to the work Mrs Sayther had no eyes for the woman till
the canoe drove in closer and her bizarre beauty peremptorily demanded
notice A closefitting blouse of mooseskin fantastically beaded
outlined faithfully the wellrounded lines of her body while a silken
kerchief gay of color and picturesquely draped partly covered great
masses of blueblack hair But it was the face cast belike in copper
bronze which caught and held Mrs Saythers fleeting glance Eyes
piercing and black and large with a traditionary hint of obliqueness
looked forth from under clearstencilled cleanarching brows Without
suggesting cadaverousness though highboned and prominent the cheeks
fell away and met in a mouth thinlipped and softly strong It was a
face which advertised the dimmest trace of ancient Mongol blood a
reversion after long centuries of wandering to the parent stem This
effect was heightened by the delicately aquiline nose with its thin
trembling nostrils and by the general air of eagle wildness which seemed
to characterize not only the face but the creature herself She was in
fact the Tartar type modified to idealization and the tribe of Red
Indian is lucky that breeds such a unique body once in a score of
generations

Dipping long strokes and strong the girl in concert with the man
suddenly whirled the tiny craft about against the current and brought it
gently to the shore Another instant and she stood at the top of the
bank heaving up by rope hand under hand a quarter of freshkilled
moose Then the man followed her and together with a swift rush they
drew up the canoe The dogs were in a whining mass about them and as
the girl stooped among them caressingly the mans gaze fell upon Mrs
Sayther who had arisen He looked brushed his eyes unconsciously as
though his sight were deceiving him and looked again

Karen he said simply coming forward and extending his hand I
thought for the moment I was dreaming I went snowblind for a time
this spring and since then my eyes have been playing tricks with me

Mrs Sayther whose flush had deepened and whose heart was urging
painfully had been prepared for almost anything save this coolly
extended hand but she tactfully curbed herself and grasped it heartily
with her own

You know Dave I threatened often to come and I would have too
onlyonly

Only I didnt give the word David Payne laughed and watched the
Indian girl disappearing into the cabin

Oh I understand Dave and had I been in your place Id most probably
have done the same But I have comenow

Then come a little bit farther into the cabin and get something to
eat he said genially ignoring or missing the feminine suggestion of
appeal in her voice And you must be tired too Which way are you
travelling Up Then you wintered in Dawson or came in on the last
ice Your camp He glanced at the _voyageurs_ circled about the fire
in the open and held back the door for her to enter

I came up on the ice from Circle City last winter he continued and
settled down here for a while Am prospecting some on Henderson Creek
and if that fails have been thinking of trying my hand this fall up the
Stuart River

You arent changed much are you she asked irrelevantly striving to
throw the conversation upon a more personal basis

A little less flesh perhaps and a little more muscle How did _you_
mean

But she shrugged her shoulders and peered I through the dim light at the
Indian girl who had lighted the fire and was frying great chunks of
moose meat alternated with thin ribbons of bacon

Did you stop in Dawson long The man was whittling a stave of
birchwood into a rude axehandle and asked the question without raising
his head

Oh a few days she answered following the girl with her eyes and
hardly hearing What were you saying In Dawson A month in fact
and glad to get away The arctic male is elemental you know and
somewhat strenuous in his feelings

Bound to be when he gets right down to the soil He leaves convention
with the spring bed at borne But you were wise in your choice of time
for leaving Youll be out of the country before mosquito season which
is a blessing your lack of experience will not permit you to appreciate

I suppose not But tell me about yourself about your life What kind
of neighbors have you Or have you any

While she queried she watched the girl grinding coffee in the corner of a
flower sack upon the hearthstone With a steadiness and skill which
predicated nerves as primitive as the method she crushed the imprisoned
berries with a heavy fragment of quartz David Payne noted his visitors
gaze and the shadow of a smile drifted over his lips

I did have some he replied Missourian chaps and a couple of
Cornishmen but they went down to Eldorado to work at wages for a
grubstake

Mrs Sayther cast a look of speculative regard upon the girl But of
course there are plenty of Indians about

Every mothers son of them down to Dawson long ago Not a native in the
whole country barring Winapie here and shes a Koyokuk lasscomes
from a thousand miles or so down the river

Mrs Sayther felt suddenly faint and though the smile of interest in no
wise waned the face of the man seemed to draw away to a telescopic
distance and the tiered logs of the cabin to whirl drunkenly about But
she was bidden draw up to the table and during the meal discovered time
and space in which to find herself She talked little and that
principally about the land and weather while the man wandered off into a
long description of the difference between the shallow summer diggings of
the Lower Country and the deep winter diggings of the Upper Country

You do not ask why I came north she asked Surely you know They
had moved back from the table and David Payne had returned to his axe
handle Did you get my letter

A last one No I dont think so Most probably its trailing around
the Birch Creek Country or lying in some traders shack on the Lower
River The way they run the mails in here is shameful No order no
system no

Dont be wooden Dave Help me She spoke sharply now with an
assumption of authority which rested upon the past Why dont you ask
me about myself About those we knew in the old times Have you no
longer any interest in the world Do you know that my husband is dead

Indeed I am sorry How long

David She was ready to cry with vexation but the reproach she threw
into her voice eased her

Did you get any of my letters You must have got some of them though
you never answered

Well I didnt get the last one announcing evidently the death of
your husband and most likely others went astray but I did get some
Ierread them aloud to Winapie as a warningthat is you know to
impress upon her the wickedness of her white sisters And Ierthink
she profited by it Dont you

She disregarded the sting and went on In the last letter which you
did not receive I told as you have guessed of Colonel Saythers death
That was a year ago I also said that if you did not come out to me I
would go in to you And as I had often promised I came

I know of no promise

In the earlier letters

Yes you promised but as I neither asked nor answered it was
unratified So I do not know of any such promise But I do know of
another which you too may remember It was very long ago He
dropped the axehandle to the floor and raised his head It was so very
long ago yet I remember it distinctly the day the time every detail
We were in a rose garden you and Iyour mothers rose garden All
things were budding blossoming and the sap of spring was in our blood
And I drew you overit was the firstand kissed you full on the lips
Dont you remember

Dont go over it Dave dont I know every shameful line of it How
often have I wept If you only knew how I have suffered

You promised me thenay and a thousand times in the sweet days that
followed Each look of your eyes each touch of your hand each syllable
that fell from your lips was a promise And thenhow shall I
saythere came a man He was oldold enough to have begotten youand
not nice to look upon but as the world goes clean He had done no
wrong followed the letter of the law was respectable Further and to
the point he possessed some several paltry minesa score it does not
matter and he owned a few miles of lands and engineered deals and
clipped coupons He

But there were other things she interrupted I told you
Pressuremoney matterswantmy peopletrouble You understood the
whole sordid situation I could not help it It was not my will I was
sacrificed or I sacrificed have it as you wish But my God Dave I
gave you up You never did _me_ justice Think what I have gone
through

It was not your will Pressure Under high heaven there was no thing
to will you to this mans bed or that

But I cared for you all the time she pleaded

I was unused to your way of measuring love I am still unused I do
not understand

But now now

We were speaking of this man you saw fit to marry What manner of man
was he Wherein did he charm your soul What potent virtues were his
True he had a golden gripan almighty golden grip He knew the odds
He was versed in cent per cent He had a narrow wit and excellent
judgment of the viler parts whereby he transferred this mans money to
his pockets and that mans money and the next mans And the law
smiled In that it did not condemn our Christian ethics approved By
social measure he was not a bad man But by your measure Karen by
mine by ours of the rose garden what was he

Remember he is dead

The fact is not altered thereby What was he A great gross material
creature deaf to song blind to beauty dead to the spirit He was fat
with laziness and flabbycheeked and the round of his belly witnessed
his gluttony

But he is dead It is we who are nownow now Dont you hear As
you say I have been inconstant I have sinned Good But should not
you too cry _peccavi_ If I have broken promises have not you Your
love of the rose garden was of all time or so you said Where is it
now

It is here now he cried striking his breast passionately with
clenched hand It has always been

And your love was a great love there was none greater she continued
or so you said in the rose garden Yet it is not fine enough large
enough to forgive me here crying now at your feet

The man hesitated His mouth opened words shaped vainly on his lips
She had forced him to bare his heart and speak truths which he had hidden
from himself And she was good to look upon standing there in a glory
of passion calling back old associations and warmer life He turned
away his head that he might not see but she passed around and fronted
him

Look at me Dave Look at me I am the same after all And so are
you if you would but see We are not changed

Her hand rested on his shoulder and his had halfpassed roughly about
her when the sharp crackle of a match startled him to himself Winapie
alien to the scene was lighting the slow wick of the slush lamp She
appeared to start out against a background of utter black and the flame
flaring suddenly up lighted her bronze beauty to royal gold

You see it is impossible he groaned thrusting the fairhaired woman
gently from him It is impossible he repeated It is impossible

I am not a girl Dave with a girls illusions she said softly though
not daring to come back to him It is as a woman that I understand Men
are men A common custom of the country I am not shocked I divined
it from the first Butahit is only a marriage of the countrynot a
real marriage

We do not ask such questions in Alaska he interposed feebly

I know but

Well then it is only a marriage of the countrynothing else

And there are no children

No

Nor

No no nothingbut it is impossible

But it is not She was at his side again her hand touching lightly
caressingly the sunburned back of his I know the custom of the land
too well Men do it every day They do not care to remain here shut
out from the world for all their days so they give an order on the P
C C Company for a years provisions some money in hand and the girl
is content By the end of that time a man She shrugged her
shoulders And so with the girl here We will give her an order upon
the company not for a year but for life What was she when you found
her A raw meateating savage fish in summer moose in winter
feasting in plenty starving in famine But for you that is what she
would have remained For your coming she was happier for your going
surely with a life of comparative splendor assured she will be happier
than if you had never been

No no he protested It is not right

Come Dave you must see She is not your kind There is no race
affinity She is an aborigine sprung from the soil yet close to the
soil and impossible to lift from the soil Born savage savage she will
die But weyou and Ithe dominant evolved racethe salt of the
earth and the masters thereof We are made for each other The supreme
call is of kind and we are of kind Reason and feeling dictate it Your
very instinct demands it That you cannot deny You cannot escape the
generations behind you Yours is an ancestry which has survived for a
thousand centuries and for a hundred thousand centuries and your line
must not stop here It cannot Your ancestry will not permit it
Instinct is stronger than the will The race is mightier than you Come
Dave let us go We are young yet and life is good Come

Winapie passing out of the cabin to feed the dogs caught his attention
and caused him to shake his head and weakly to reiterate But the
womans hand slipped about his neck and her cheek pressed to his His
bleak life rose up and smote himthe vain struggle with pitiless
forces the dreary years of frost and famine the harsh and jarring
contact with elemental life the aching void which mere animal existence
could not fill And there seduction by his side whispering of
brighter warmer lands of music light and joy called the old times
back again He visioned it unconsciously Faces rushed in upon him
glimpses of forgotten scenes memories of merry hours strains of song
and trills of laughter

Come Dave Come I have for both The way is soft She looked about
her at the bare furnishings of the cabin I have for both The world
is at our feet and all joy is ours Come come

She was in his arms trembling and he held her tightly He rose to his
feet    But the snarling of hungry dogs and the shrill cries of
Winapie bringing about peace between the combatants came muffled to his
ear through the heavy logs And another scene flashed before him A
struggle in the foresta baldface grizzly brokenlegged terrible
the snarling of the dogs and the shrill cries of Winapie as she urged
them to the attack himself in the midst of the crush breathless
panting striving to hold off red death brokenbacked entrailripped
dogs howling in impotent anguish and desecrating the snow the virgin
white running scarlet with the blood of man and beast the bear
ferocious irresistible crunching crunching down to the core of his
life and Winapie at the last in the thick of the frightful muddle
hair flying eyes flashing fury incarnate passing the long hunting
knife again and againSweat started to his forehead He shook off the
clinging woman and staggered back to the wall And she knowing that the
moment had come but unable to divine what was passing within him felt
all she had gained slipping away

Dave Dave she cried I will not give you up I will not give you
up If you do not wish to come we will stay I will stay with you The
world is less to me than are you I will be a Northland wife to you I
will cook your food feed your dogs break trail for you lift a paddle
with you I can do it Believe me I am strong

Nor did he doubt it looking upon her and holding her off from him but
his face had grown stern and gray and the warmth had died out of his
eyes

I will pay off Pierre and the boatmen and let them go And I will stay
with you priest or no priest minister or no minister go with you now
anywhere Dave Dave Listen to me You say I did you wrong in the
pastand I didlet me make up for it let me atone If I did not
rightly measure love before let me show that I can now

She sank to the floor and threw her arms about his knees sobbing And
you _do_ care for me You _do_ care for me Think The long years I
have waited suffered You can never know He stooped and raised her
to her feet

Listen he commanded opening the door and lifting her bodily outside
It cannot be We are not alone to be considered You must go I wish
you a safe journey You will find it tougher work when you get up by the
Sixty Mile but you have the best boatmen in the world and will get
through all right Will you say goodby

Though she already had herself in hand she looked at him hopelessly
Ififif Winapie should She quavered and stopped

But he grasped the unspoken thought and answered Yes Then struck
with the enormity of it It cannot be conceived There is no
likelihood It must not be entertained

Kiss me she whispered her face lighting Then she turned and went
away

    

Break camp Pierre she said to the boatman who alone had remained
awake against her return We must be going

By the firelight his sharp eyes scanned the woe in her face but he
received the extraordinary command as though it were the most usual thing
in the world _Oui madame_ he assented Which way Dawson

No she answered lightly enough up out Dyea

Whereat he fell upon the sleeping _voyageurs_ kicking them grunting
from their blankets and buckling them down to the work the while his
voice vibrant with action shrilling through all the camp In a trice
Mrs Saythers tiny tent had been struck pots and pans were being
gathered up blankets rolled and the men staggering under the loads to
the boat Here on the banks Mrs Sayther waited till the luggage was
made shipshape and her nest prepared

We line up to de head of de island Pierre explained to her while
running out the long tow rope Den we tak to das back channel where de
water not queek and I tink we mak good tam

A scuffling and pattering of feet in the last years dry grass caught his
quick ear and he turned his head The Indian girl circled by a
bristling ring of wolf dogs was coming toward them Mrs Sayther noted
that the girls face which had been apathetic throughout the scene in
the cabin had now quickened into blazing and wrathful life

What you do my man she demanded abruptly of Mrs Sayther Him lay on
bunk and him look bad all the time I say What the matter Dave You
sick But him no say nothing After that him say Good girl Winapie
go way I be all right bimeby What you do my man eh I think you
bad woman

Mrs Sayther looked curiously at the barbarian woman who shared the life
of this man while she departed alone in the darkness of night

I think you bad woman Winapie repeated in the slow methodical way of
one who gropes for strange words in an alien tongue I think better you
go way no come no more Eh What you think I have one man I Indian
girl You Merican woman You good to see You find plenty men Your
eyes blue like the sky Your skin so white so soft

Coolly she thrust out a brown forefinger and pressed the soft cheek of
the other woman And to the eternal credit of Karen Sayther she never
flinched Pierre hesitated and half stepped forward but she motioned
him away though her heart welled to him with secret gratitude Its
all right Pierre she said Please go away

He stepped back respectfully out of earshot where he stood grumbling to
himself and measuring the distance in springs

Um white um soft like baby Winapie touched the other cheek and
withdrew her hand Bimeby mosquito come Skin get sore in spot um
swell oh so big um hurt oh so much Plenty mosquito plenty spot I
think better you go now before mosquito come This way pointing down
the stream you go St Michaels that way pointing up you go Dyea
Better you go Dyea Goodby

And that which Mrs Sayther then did caused Pierre to marvel greatly
For she threw her arms around the Indian girl kissed her and burst into
tears

Be good to him she cried Be good to him

Then she slipped half down the face of the bank called back Goodby
and dropped into the boat amidships Pierre followed her and cast off
He shoved the steering oar into place and gave the signal Le Goire
lifted an old French _chanson_ the men like a row of ghosts in the dim
starlight bent their backs to the tow line the steering oar cut the
black current sharply and the boat swept out into the night




WHICH MAKE MEN REMEMBER


Fortune La Pearle crushed his way through the snow sobbing straining
cursing his luck Alaska Nome the cards and the man who had felt his
knife The hot blood was freezing on his hands and the scene yet bright
in his eyesthe man clutching the table and sinking slowly to the
floor the rolling counters and the scattered deck the swift shiver
throughout the room and the pause the gamekeepers no longer calling
and the clatter of the chips dying away the startled faces the infinite
instant of silence and then the great bloodroar and the tide of
vengeance which lapped his heels and turned the town mad behind him

All hells broke loose he sneered turning aside in the darkness and
heading for the beach Lights were flashing from open doors and tent
cabin and dancehall let slip their denizens upon the chase The clamor
of men and howling of dogs smote his ears and quickened his feet He ran
on and on The sounds grew dim and the pursuit dissipated itself in
vain rage and aimless groping But a flitting shadow clung to him Head
thrust over shoulder he caught glimpses of it now taking vague shape on
an open expanse of snow how merging into the deeper shadows of some
darkened cabin or beachlisted craft

Fortune La Pearle swore like a woman weakly with the hint of tears that
comes of exhaustion and plunged deeper into the maze of heaped ice
tents and prospect holes He stumbled over taut hawsers and piles of
dunnage tripped on crazy guyropes and insanely planted pegs and fell
again and again upon frozen dumps and mounds of hoarded driftwood At
times when he deemed he had drawn clear his head dizzy with the painful
pounding of his heart and the suffocating intake of his breath he
slackened down and ever the shadow leaped out of the gloom and forced
him on in heartbreaking flight A swift intuition lashed upon him
leaving in its trail the cold chill of superstition The persistence of
the shadow he invested with his gamblers symbolism Silent inexorable
not to be shaken off he took it as the fate which waited at the last
turn when chips were cashed in and gains and losses counted up Fortune
La Pearle believed in those rare illuminating moments when the
intelligence flung from it time and space to rise naked through eternity
and read the facts of life from the open book of chance That this was
such a moment he had no doubt and when he turned inland and sped across
the snowcovered tundra he was not startled because the shadow took upon
it greater definiteness and drew in closer Oppressed with his own
impotence he halted in the midst of the white waste and whirled about
His right hand slipped from its mitten and a revolver at level
glistened in the pale light of the stars

Dont shoot I havent a gun

The shadow had assumed tangible shape and at the sound of its human
voice a trepidation affected Fortune La Pearles knees and his stomach
was stricken with the qualms of sudden relief

Perhaps things fell out differently because Uri Bram had no gun that
night when he sat on the hard benches of the El Dorado and saw murder
done To that fact also might be attributed the trip on the Long Trail
which he took subsequently with a most unlikely comrade But be it as it
may he repeated a second time Dont shoot Cant you see I havent a
gun

Then what the flaming hell did you take after me for demanded the
gambler lowering his revolver

Uri Bram shrugged his shoulders It dont matter much anyhow I want
you to come with me

Where

To my shack over on the edge of the camp

But Fortune La Pearle drove the heel of his moccasin into the snow and
attested by his various deities to the madness of Uri Bram Who are
you he perorated and what am I that I should put my neck into the
rope at your bidding

I am Uri Bram the other said simply and my shack is over there on
the edge of camp I dont know who you are but youve thrust the soul
from a living mans bodytheres the blood red on your sleeveand
like a second Cain the hand of all mankind is against you and there is
no place you may lay your head Now I have a shack

For the love of your mother hold your say man interrupted Fortune La
Pearle or Ill make you a second Abel for the joy of it So help me I
will With a thousand men to lay me by the heels looking high and low
what do I want with your shack I want to get out of hereaway away
away Cursed swine Ive half a mind to go back and run amuck and
settle for a few of them the pigs One gorgeous glorious fight and
end the whole damn business Its a skin game thats what life is and
Im sick of it

He stopped appalled crushed by his great desolation and Uri Bram
seized the moment He was not given to speech this man and that which
followed was the longest in his life save one long afterward in another
place

Thats why I told you about my shack I can stow you there so theyll
never find you and Ive got grub in plenty Elsewise you cant get
away No dogs no nothing the sea closed St Michael the nearest post
runners to carry the news before you the same over the portage to
Anviknot a chance in the world for you Now wait with me till it blows
over Theyll forget all about you in a month or less what of
stampeding to York and what not and you can hit the trail under their
noses and they wont bother Ive got my own ideas of justice When I
ran after you out of the El Dorado and along the beach it wasnt to
catch you or give you up My ideas are my own and thats not one of
them

He ceased as the murderer drew a prayerbook from his pocket With the
aurora borealis glimmering yellow in the northeast heads bared to the
frost and naked hands grasping the sacred book Fortune La Pearle swore
him to the words he had spokenan oath which Uri Bram never intended
breaking and never broke

At the door of the shack the gambler hesitated for an instant marvelling
at the strangeness of this man who had befriended him and doubting But
by the candlelight he found the cabin comfortable and without occupants
and he was quickly rolling a cigarette while the other man made coffee
His muscles relaxed in the warmth and he lay back with halfassumed
indolence intently studying Uris face through the curling wisps of
smoke It was a powerful face but its strength was of that peculiar
sort which stands girt in and unrelated The seams were deepgraven
more like scars while the stern features were in no way softened by
hints of sympathy or humor Under prominent bushy brows the eyes shone
cold and gray The cheekbones high and forbidding were undermined by
deep hollows The chin and jaw displayed a steadiness of purpose which
the narrow forehead advertised as single and if needs be pitiless
Everything was harsh the nose the lips the voice the lines about the
mouth It was the face of one who communed much with himself unused to
seeking counsel from the world the face of one who wrestled oft of
nights with angels and rose to face the day with shut lips that no man
might know He was narrow but deep and Fortune his own humanity broad
and shallow could make nothing of him Did Uri sing when merry and sigh
when sad he could have understood but as it was the cryptic features
were undecipherable he could not measure the soul they concealed

Lend a hand Mister Man Uri ordered when the cups had been emptied
Weve got to fix up for visitors

Fortune purred his name for the others benefit and assisted
understandingly The bunk was built against a side and end of the cabin
It was a rude affair the bottom being composed of driftwood logs
overlaid with moss At the foot the rough ends of these timbers
projected in an uneven row From the side next the wall Uri ripped back
the moss and removed three of the logs The jagged ends he sawed off and
replaced so that the projecting row remained unbroken Fortune carried
in sacks of flour from the cache and piled them on the floor beneath the
aperture On these Uri laid a pair of long seabags and over all spread
several thicknesses of moss and blankets Upon this Fortune could lie
with the sleeping furs stretching over him from one side of the bunk to
the other and all men could look upon it and declare it empty

In the weeks which followed several domiciliary visits were paid not a
shack or tent in Nome escaping but Fortune lay in his cranny
undisturbed In fact little attention was given to Uri Brams cabin
for it was the last place under the sun to expect to find the murderer of
John Randolph Except during such interruptions Fortune lolled about
the cabin playing long games of solitaire and smoking endless
cigarettes Though his volatile nature loved geniality and play of words
and laughter he quickly accommodated himself to Uris taciturnity
Beyond the actions and plans of his pursuers the state of the trails
and the price of dogs they never talked and these things were only
discussed at rare intervals and briefly But Fortune fell to working out
a system and hour after hour and day after day he shuffled and dealt
shuffled and dealt noted the combinations of the cards in long columns
and shuffled and dealt again Toward the end even this absorption failed
him and head bowed upon the table he visioned the lively allnight
houses of Nome where the gamekeepers and lookouts worked in shifts and
the clattering roulette ball never slept At such times his loneliness
and bankruptcy stunned him till he sat for hours in the same unblinking
unchanging position At other times his longpent bitterness found
voice in passionate outbursts for he had rubbed the world the wrong way
and did not like the feel of it

Lifes a skingame he was fond of repeating and on this one note he
rang the changes I never had half a chance he complained I was
faked in my birth and flimflammed with my mothers milk The dice were
loaded when she tossed the box and I was born to prove the loss But
that was no reason she should blame me for it and look on me as a cold
deck but she diday she did Why didnt she give me a show Why
didnt the world Why did I go broke in Seattle Why did I take the
steerage and live like a hog to Nome Why did I go to the El Dorado I
was heading for Big Petes and only went for matches Why didnt I have
matches Why did I want to smoke Dont you see All worked out every
bit of it all parts fitting snug Before I was born like as not Ill
put the sack I never hope to get on it before I was born Thats why
Thats why John Randolph passed the word and his checks in at the same
time Damn him It served him well right Why didnt he keep his
tongue between his teeth and give me a chance He knew I was next to
broke Why didnt I hold my hand Oh why Why Why

And Fortune La Pearle would roll upon the floor vainly interrogating the
scheme of things At such outbreaks Uri said no word gave no sign save
that his grey eyes seemed to turn dull and muddy as though from lack of
interest There was nothing in common between these two men and this
fact Fortune grasped sufficiently to wonder sometimes why Uri had stood
by him

But the time of waiting came to an end Even a communitys blood lust
cannot stand before its gold lust The murder of John Randolph had
already passed into the annals of the camp and there it rested Had the
murderer appeared the men of Nome would certainly have stopped
stampeding long enough to see justice done whereas the whereabouts of
Fortune La Pearle was no longer an insistent problem There was gold in
the creek beds and ruby beaches and when the sea opened the men with
healthy sacks would sail away to where the good things of life were sold
absurdly cheap

So one night Fortune helped Uri Bram harness the dogs and lash the
sled and the twain took the winter trail south on the ice But it was
not all south for they left the sea east from St Michaels crossed the
divide and struck the Yukon at Anvik many hundred miles from its mouth
Then on into the northeast past Koyokuk Tanana and Minook till they
rounded the Great Curve at Fort Yukon crossed and recrossed the Arctic
Circle and headed south through the Flats It was a weary journey and
Fortune would have wondered why the man went with him had not Uri told
him that he owned claims and had men working at Eagle Eagle lay on the
edge of the line a few miles farther on the British flag waved over the
barracks at Fort Cudahy Then came Dawson Pelly the Five Fingers
Windy Arm Caribou Crossing Linderman the Chilcoot and Dyea

On the morning after passing Eagle they rose early This was their last
camp and they were now to part Fortunes heart was light There was a
promise of spring in the land and the days were growing longer The way
was passing into Canadian territory Liberty was at hand the sun was
returning and each day saw him nearer to the Great Outside The world
was big and he could once again paint his future in royal red He
whistled about the breakfast and hummed snatches of light song while Uri
put the dogs in harness and packed up But when all was ready Fortunes
feet itching to be off Uri pulled an unused backlog to the fire and sat
down

Ever hear of the Dead Horse Trail

He glanced up meditatively and Fortune shook his head inwardly chafing
at the delay

Sometimes there are meetings under circumstances which make men
remember Uri continued speaking in a low voice and very slowly and I
met a man under such circumstances on the Dead Horse Trail Freighting
an outfit over the White Pass in 97 broke many a mans heart for there
was a world of reason when they gave that trail its name The horses
died like mosquitoes in the first frost and from Skaguay to Bennett they
rotted in heaps They died at the Rocks they were poisoned at the
Summit and they starved at the Lakes they fell off the trail what
there was of it or they went through it in the river they drowned under
their loads or were smashed to pieces against the boulders they snapped
their legs in the crevices and broke their backs falling backwards with
their packs in the sloughs they sank from sight or smothered in the
slime and they were disembowelled in the bogs where the corduroy logs
turned end up in the mud men shot them worked them to death and when
they were gone went back to the beach and bought more Some did not
bother to shoot themstripping the saddles off and the shoes and
leaving them where they fell Their hearts turned to stonethose which
did not breakand they became beasts the men on Dead Horse Trail

It was there I met a man with the heart of a Christ and the patience
And he was honest When he rested at midday he took the packs from the
horses so that they too might rest He paid 50 a hundredweight for
their fodder and more He used his own bed to blanket their backs when
they rubbed raw Other men let the saddles eat holes the size of water
buckets Other men when the shoes gave out let them wear their hoofs
down to the bleeding stumps He spent his last dollar for horseshoe
nails I know this because we slept in the one bed and ate from the one
pot and became blood brothers where men lost their grip of things and
died blaspheming God He was never too tired to ease a strap or tighten
a cinch and often there were tears in his eyes when he looked on all
that waste of misery At a passage in the rocks where the brutes
upreared hindlegged and stretched their forelegs upward like cats to
clear the wall the way was piled with carcasses where they had toppled
back And here he stood in the stench of hell with a cheery word and a
hand on the rump at the right time till the string passed by And when
one bogged he blocked the trail till it was clear again nor did the man
live who crowded him at such time

At the end of the trail a man who had killed fifty horses wanted to buy
but we looked at him and at our ownmountain cayuses from eastern
Oregon Five thousand he offered and we were broke but we remembered
the poison grass of the Summit and the passage in the Rocks and the man
who was my brother spoke no word but divided the cayuses into two
buncheshis in the one and mine in the otherand he looked at me and
we understood each other So he drove mine to the one side and I drove
his to the other and we took with us our rifles and shot them to the
last one while the man who had killed fifty horses cursed us till his
throat cracked But that man with whom I welded bloodbrothership on
the Dead Horse Trail

Why that man was John Randolph Fortune sneering the while completed
the climax for him

Uri nodded and said I am glad you understand

I am ready Fortune answered the old weary bitterness strong in his
face again Go ahead but hurry

Uri Bram rose to his feet

I have had faith in God all the days of my life I believe He loves
justice I believe He is looking down upon us now choosing between us
I believe He waits to work His will through my own right arm And such
is my belief that we will take equal chance and let Him speak His own
judgment

Fortunes heart leaped at the words He did not know much concerning
Uris God but he believed in Chance and Chance had been coming his way
ever since the night he ran down the beach and across the snow But
there is only one gun he objected

We will fire turn about Uri replied at the same time throwing out the
cylinder of the other mans Colt and examining it

And the cards to decide One hand of seven up

Fortunes blood was warming to the game and he drew the deck from his
pocket as Uri nodded Surely Chance would not desert him now He
thought of the returning sun as he cut for deal and he thrilled when he
found the deal was his He shuffled and dealt and Uri cut him the Jack
of Spades They laid down their hands Uris was bare of trumps while
he held ace deuce The outside seemed very near to him as they stepped
off the fifty paces

If God withholds His hand and you drop me the dogs and outfit are
yours Youll find a bill of sale already made out in my pocket Uri
explained facing the path of the bullet straight and broadbreasted

Fortune shook a vision of the sun shining on the ocean from his eyes and
took aim He was very careful Twice he lowered as the spring breeze
shook the pines But the third time he dropped on one knee gripped the
revolver steadily in both hands and fired Uri whirled half about
threw up his arms swayed wildly for a moment and sank into the snow
But Fortune knew he had fired too far to one side else the man would not
have whirled

When Uri mastering the flesh and struggling to his feet beckoned for
the weapon Fortune was minded to fire again But he thrust the idea
from him Chance had been very good to him already he felt and if he
tricked now he would have to pay for it afterward No he would play
fair Besides Uri was hard hit and could not possibly hold the heavy
Colt long enough to draw a bead

And where is your God now he taunted as he gave the wounded man the
revolver

And Uri answered God has not yet spoken Prepare that He may speak

Fortune faced him but twisted his chest sideways in order to present
less surface Uri tottered about drunkenly but waited too for the
moments calm between the catspaws The revolver was very heavy and he
doubted like Fortune because of its weight But he held it arm
extended above his head and then let it slowly drop forward and down
At the instant Fortunes left breast and the sight flashed into line with
his eye he pulled the trigger Fortune did not whirl but gay San
Francisco dimmed and faded and as the sunbright snow turned black and
blacker he breathed his last malediction on the Chance he had misplayed




SIWASH


If I was a man Her words were in themselves indecisive but the
withering contempt which flashed from her black eyes was not lost upon
the menfolk in the tent

Tommy the English sailor squirmed but chivalrous old Dick Humphries
Cornish fisherman and erstwhile American salmon capitalist beamed upon
her benevolently as ever He bore women too large a portion of his rough
heart to mind them as he said when they were in the doldrums or when
their limited vision would not permit them to see all around a thing So
they said nothing these two men who had taken the halffrozen woman into
their tent three days back and who had warmed her and fed her and
rescued her goods from the Indian packers This latter had necessitated
the payment of numerous dollars to say nothing of a demonstration in
forceDick Humphries squinting along the sights of a Winchester while
Tommy apportioned their wages among them at his own appraisement It had
been a little thing in itself but it meant much to a woman playing a
desperate singlehand in the equally desperate Klondike rush of 97 Men
were occupied with their own pressing needs nor did they approve of
women playing singlehanded the odds of the arctic winter If I was a
man I know what I would do Thus reiterated Molly she of the flashing
eyes and therein spoke the cumulative grit of five Americanborn
generations

In the succeeding silence Tommy thrust a pan of biscuits into the Yukon
stove and piled on fresh fuel A reddish flood pounded along under his
suntanned skin and as he stooped the skin of his neck was scarlet
Dick palmed a threecornered sail needle through a set of broken pack
straps his good nature in nowise disturbed by the feminine cataclysm
which was threatening to burst in the stormbeaten tent

And if you was a man he asked his voice vibrant with kindness The
threecornered needle jammed in the damp leather and he suspended work
for the moment

Id be a man Id put the straps on my back and light out I wouldnt
lay in camp here with the Yukon like to freeze most any day and the
goods not half over the portage And youyou are men and you sit here
holding your hands afraid of a little wind and wet I tell you
straight Yankeemen are made of different stuff Theyd be hitting the
trail for Dawson if they had to wade through hellfire And you youI
wish I was a man

Im very glad my dear that youre not Dick Humphries threw the
bight of the sail twine over the point of the needle and drew it clear
with a couple of deft turns and a jerk

A snort of the gale dealt the tent a broadhanded slap as it hurtled
past and the sleet rattattatted with snappy spite against the thin
canvas The smoke smothered in its exit drove back through the fire
box door carrying with it the pungent odor of green spruce

Good Gawd Why cant a woman listen to reason Tommy lifted his head
from the denser depths and turned upon her a pair of smokeoutraged eyes

And why cant a man show his manhood

Tommy sprang to his feet with an oath which would have shocked a woman of
lesser heart ripped loose the sturdy reefknots and flung back the flaps
of the tent

The trio peered out It was not a heartening spectacle A few water
soaked tents formed the miserable foreground from which the streaming
ground sloped to a foaming gorge Down this ramped a mountain torrent
Here and there dwarf spruce rooting and grovelling in the shallow
alluvium marked the proximity of the timber line Beyond on the
opposing slope the vague outlines of a glacier loomed deadwhite through
the driving rain Even as they looked its massive front crumbled into
the valley on the breast of some subterranean vomit and it lifted its
hoarse thunder above the screeching voice of the storm Involuntarily
Molly shrank back

Look woman Look with all your eyes Three miles in the teeth of the
gale to Crater Lake across two glaciers along the slippery rimrock
kneedeep in a howling river Look I say you Yankee woman Look
Theres your Yankeemen Tommy pointed a passionate hand in the
direction of the struggling tents Yankees the last mothers son of
them Are they on trail Is there one of them with the straps to his
back And you would teach us men our work Look I say

Another tremendous section of the glacier rumbled earthward The wind
whipped in at the open doorway bulging out the sides of the tent till it
swayed like a huge bladder at its guy ropes The smoke swirled about
them and the sleet drove sharply into their flesh Tommy pulled the
flaps together hastily and returned to his tearful task at the firebox
Dick Humphries threw the mended pack straps into a corner and lighted his
pipe Even Molly was for the moment persuaded

Theres my clothes she halfwhimpered the feminine for the moment
prevailing Theyre right at the top of the cache and theyll be
ruined I tell you ruined

There there Dick interposed when the last quavering syllable had
wailed itself out Dont let that worry you little woman Im old
enough to be your fathers brother and Ive a daughter older than you
and Ill tog you out in fripperies when we get to Dawson if it takes my
last dollar

When we get to Dawson The scorn had come back to her throat with a
sudden surge Youll rot on the way first Youll drown in a mudhole
YouyouBritishers

The last word explosive intensive had strained the limits of her
vituperation If that would not stir these men what could Tommys
neck ran red again but he kept his tongue between his teeth Dicks
eyes mellowed He had the advantage over Tommy for he had once had a
white woman for a wife

The blood of five Americanborn generations is under certain
circumstances an uncomfortable heritage and among these circumstances
might be enumerated that of being quartered with next of kin These men
were Britons On sea and land her ancestry and the generations thereof
had thrashed them and theirs On sea and land they would continue to do
so The traditions of her race clamored for vindication She was but a
woman of the present but in her bubbled the whole mighty past It was
not alone Molly Travis who pulled on gum boots mackintosh and straps
for the phantom hands of ten thousand forbears drew tight the buckles
just so as they squared her jaw and set her eyes with determination She
Molly Travis intended to shame these Britishers they the innumerable
shades were asserting the dominance of the common race

The menfolk did not interfere Once Dick suggested that she take his
oilskins as her mackintosh was worth no more than paper in such a storm
But she sniffed her independence so sharply that he communed with his
pipe till she tied the flaps on the outside and slushed away on the
flooded trail

Think shell make it Dicks face belied the indifference of his
voice

Make it If she stands the pressure till she gets to the cache what of
the cold and misery shell be stark raving mad Stand it Shell be
dumbcrazed You know it yourself Dick Youve windjammed round the
Horn You know what it is to lay out on a topsail yard in the thick of
it bucking sleet and snow and frozen canvas till youre ready to just
let go and cry like a baby Clothes She wont be able to tell a bundle
of skirts from a gold pan or a teakettle

Kind of think we were wrong in letting her go then

Not a bit of it So help me Dick shed a made this tent a hell for
the rest of the trip if we hadnt Trouble with her shes got too much
spirit Thisll tone it down a bit

Yes Dick admitted shes too ambitious But then Mollys all right
A cussed little fool to tackle a trip like this but a plucky sight
better than those pickmeupandcarryme kind of women Shes the stock
that carried you and me Tommy and youve got to make allowance for the
spirit Takes a woman to breed a man You cant suck manhood from the
dugs of a creature whose only claim to womanhood is her petticoats Takes
a shecat not a cow to mother a tiger

And when theyre unreasonable weve got to put up with it eh

The proposition A sharp sheathknife cuts deeper on a slip than a dull
one but thats no reason for to hack the edge off over a capstan bar

All right if you say so but when it comes to woman I guess Ill take
mine with a little less edge

What do you know about it Dick demanded

Some Tommy reached over for a pair of Mollys wet stockings and
stretched them across his knees to dry

Dick eying him querulously went fishing in her hand satchel then
hitched up to the front of the stove with divers articles of damp
clothing spread likewise to the heat

Thought you said you never were married he asked

Did I No more was Ithat isyes by Gawd I was And as good a
woman as ever cooked grub for a man

Slipped her moorings Dick symbolized infinity with a wave of his hand

Ay

Childbirth he added after a moments pause

The beans bubbled rowdily on the front lid and he pushed the pot back to
a cooler surface After that he investigated the biscuits tested them
with a splinter of wood and placed them aside under cover of a damp
cloth Dick after the manner of his kind stifled his interest and
waited silently A different woman to Molly Siwash

Dick nodded his understanding

Not so proud and wilful but stick by a fellow through thick and thin
Sling a paddle with the next and starve as contentedly as Job Go
forard when the sloops nose was more often under than not and take in
sail like a man Went prospecting once up Teslin way past Surprise
Lake and the Little YellowHead Grub gave out and we ate the dogs
Dogs gave out and we ate harnesses moccasins and furs Never a
whimper never a pickmeupandcarryme Before we went she said look
out for grub but when it happened never a Itoldyouso Never mind
Tommy shed say day after day that weak she could bare lift a snow
shoe and her feet raw with the work Never mind Id sooner be flat
bellied of hunger and be your woman Tommy than have a _potlach_ every
day and be Chief Georges _klooch_ George was chief of the Chilcoots
you know and wanted her bad

Great days those Was a likely chap myself when I struck the coast
Jumped a whaler the _Pole Star_ at Unalaska and worked my way down to
Sitka on an otter hunter Picked up with Happy Jack thereknow him

Had charge of my traps for me Dick answered down on the Columbia
Pretty wild wasnt he with a warm place in his heart for whiskey and
women

The very chap Went trading with him for a couple of seasons_hooch_
and blankets and such stuff Then got a sloop of my own and not to cut
him out came down Juneau way Thats where I met Killisnoo I called
her Tilly for short Met her at a squaw dance down on the beach Chief
George had finished the years trade with the Sticks over the Passes and
was down from Dyea with half his tribe No end of Siwashes at the dance
and I the only white No one knew me barring a few of the bucks Id met
over Sitka way but Id got most of their histories from Happy Jack

Everybody talking Chinook not guessing that I could spit it better than
most and principally two girls whod run away from Haines Mission up
the Lynn Canal They were trim creatures good to the eye and I kind of
thought of casting that way but they were fresh as freshcaught cod Too
much edge you see Being a newcomer they started to twist me not
knowing I gathered in every word of Chinook they uttered

I never let on but set to dancing with Tilly and the more we danced
the more our hearts warmed to each other Looking for a woman one of
the girls says and the other tosses her head and answers Small chance
hell get one when the women are looking for men And the bucks and
squaws standing around began to grin and giggle and repeat what had been
said Quite a pretty boy says the first one Ill not deny I was
rather smoothfaced and youngish but Id been a man amongst men manys
the day and it rankled me Dancing with Chief Georges girl pipes
the second First thing Georgell give him the flat of a paddle and
send him about his business Chief George had been looking pretty black
up to now but at this he laughed and slapped his knees He was a husky
beggar and would have used the paddle too

Whos the girls I asked Tilly as we went ripping down the centre in
a reel And as soon as she told me their names I remembered all about
them from Happy Jack Had their pedigree down fineseveral things hed
told me that not even their own tribe knew But I held my hush and went
on courting Tilly they acasting sharp remarks and everybody roaring
Bide a wee Tommy I says to myself bide a wee

And bide I did till the dance was ripe to break up and Chief George
had brought a paddle all ready for me Everybody was on the lookout for
mischief when we stopped but I marched easy as you please slap into
the thick of them The Mission girls cut me up something clever and for
all I was angry I had to set my teeth to keep from laughing I turned
upon them suddenly

Are you done I asked

You should have seen them when they heard me spitting Chinook Then I
broke loose I told them all about themselves and their people before
them their fathers mothers sisters brotherseverybody everything
Each mean trick theyd played every scrape theyd got into every shame
thatd fallen them And I burned them without fear or favor All hands
crowded round Never had they heard a white man sling their lingo as I
did Everybody was laughing save the Mission girls Even Chief George
forgot the paddle or at least he was swallowing too much respect to dare
to use it

But the girls Oh dont Tommy they cried the tears running down
their cheeks Please dont Well be good Sure Tommy sure But I
knew them well and I scorched them on every tender spot Nor did I
slack away till they came down on their knees begging and pleading with
me to keep quiet Then I shot a glance at Chief George but he did not
know whether to have at me or not and passed it off by laughing
hollowly

So be When I passed the parting with Tilly that night I gave her the
word that I was going to be around for a week or so and that I wanted to
see more of her Not thickskinned her kind when it came to showing
like and dislike and she looked her pleasure for the honest girl she
was Ay a striking lass and I didnt wonder that Chief George was
taken with her

Everything my way Took the wind from his sails on the first leg I
was for getting her aboard and sailing down Wrangel way till it blew
over leaving him to whistle but I wasnt to get her that easy Seems
she was living with an uncle of hersguardian the way such things
goand seems he was nigh to shuffling off with consumption or some sort
of lung trouble He was good and bad by turns and she wouldnt leave
him till it was over with Went up to the tepee just before I left to
speculate on how long itd be but the old beggar had promised her to
Chief George and when he clapped eyes on me his anger brought on a
hemorrhage

Come and take me Tommy she says when we bid goodby on the beach
Ay I answers when you give the word And I kissed her whiteman
fashion and loverfashion till she was all of a tremble like a quaking
aspen and I was so beside myself Id half a mind to go up and give the
uncle a lift over the divide

So I went down Wrangel way past St Marys and even to the Queen
Charlottes trading running whiskey turning the sloop to most anything
Winter was on stiff and crisp and I was back to Juneau when the word
came Come the beggar says who brought the news Killisnoo say
Come now Whats the row I asks Chief George says he
_Potlach_ Killisnoo makum _klooch_

Ay it was bitterthe Taku howling down out of the north the salt
water freezing quick as it struck the deck and the old sloop and I
hammering into the teeth of it for a hundred miles to Dyea Had a
Douglass Islander for crew when I started but midway up he was washed
over from the bows Jibed all over and crossed the course three times
but never a sign of him

Doubled up with the cold most likely Dick suggested putting a pause
into the narrative while he hung one of Mollys skirts up to dry and
went down like a pot of lead

My idea So I finished the course alone halfdead when I made Dyea in
the dark of the evening The tide favored and I ran the sloop plump to
the bank in the shelter of the river Couldnt go an inch further for
the fresh water was frozen solid Halyards and blocks were that iced up
I didnt dare lower mainsail or jib First I broached a pint of the
cargo raw and then leaving all standing ready for the start and with
a blanket around me headed across the flat to the camp No mistaking
it was a grand layout The Chilcats had come in a bodydogs babies
and canoesto say nothing of the DogEars the Little Salmons and the
Missions Full half a thousand of them to celebrate Tillys wedding and
never a white man in a score of miles

Nobody took note of me the blanket over my head and hiding my face and
I waded knee deep through the dogs and youngsters till I was well up to
the front The show was being pulled off in a big open place among the
trees with great fires burning and the snow moccasinpacked as hard as
Portland cement Next me was Tilly beaded and scarletclothed galore
and against her Chief George and his head men The shaman was being
helped out by the big medicines from the other tribes and it shivered my
spine up and down the deviltries they cut I caught myself wondering if
the folks in Liverpool could only see me now and I thought of yellow
haired Gussie whose brother I licked after my first voyage just because
he was not for having a sailorman courting his sister And with Gussie
in my eyes I looked at Tilly A rum old world thinks I with man
astepping in trails the mother little dreamed of when he lay at suck

So be When the noise was loudest walrus hides booming and priests a
singing I says Are you ready Gawd Not a start not a shot of the
eyes my way not the twitch of a muscle I knew she answers slow and
steady as a calm spring tide Where The high bank at the edge of
the ice I whispers back Jump out when I give the word

Did I say there was no end of huskies Well there was no end Here
there everywhere they were scattered abouttame wolves and nothing
less When the strain runs thin they breed them in the bush with the
wild and theyre bitter fighters Right at the toe of my moccasin lay a
big brute and by the heel another I doubled the first ones tail
quick till it snapped in my grip As his jaws clipped together where my
hand should have been I threw the second one by the scruff straight into
his mouth Go I cried to Tilly

You know how they fight In the wink of an eye there was a raging
hundred of them top and bottom ripping and tearing each other kids and
squaws tumbling which way and the camp gone wild Tillyd slipped away
so I followed But when I looked over my shoulder at the skirt of the
crowd the devil laid me by the heart and I dropped the blanket and went
back

By then the dogsd been knocked apart and the crowd was untangling
itself Nobody was in proper place so they didnt note that Tillyd
gone Hello I says gripping Chief George by the hand May your
potlachsmoke rise often and the Sticks bring many furs with the
spring

Lord love me Dick but he was joyed to see mehim with the upper hand
and wedding Tilly Chance to puff big over me The tale that I was hot
after her had spread through the camps and my presence did him proud
All hands knew me without my blanket and set to grinning and giggling
It was rich but I made it richer by playing unbeknowing

Whats the row I asks Whos getting married now

Chief George the shaman says ducking his reverence to him

Thought he had two _klooches_

Him takum morethree with another duck

Oh And I turned away as though it didnt interest me

But this wouldnt do and everybody begins singing out Killisnoo
Killisnoo

Killisnoo what I asked

Killisnoo _klooch_ Chief George they blathered Killisnoo
_klooch_

I jumped and looked at Chief George He nodded his head and threw out
his chest

Shell be no _klooch_ of yours I says solemnly No _klooch_ of
yours I repeats while his face went black and his hand began dropping
to his huntingknife

Look I cries striking an attitude Big Medicine You watch my
smoke

I pulled off my mittens rolled back my sleeves and made halfadozen
passes in the air

Killisnoo I shouts Killisnoo Killisnoo

I was making medicine and they began to scare Every eye was on me no
time to find out that Tilly wasnt there Then I called Killisnoo three
times again and waited and three times more All for mystery and to
make them nervous Chief George couldnt guess what I was up to and
wanted to put a stop to the foolery but the shamans said to wait and
that theyd see me and go me one better or words to that effect
Besides he was a superstitious cuss and I fancy a bit afraid of the
white mans magic

Then I called Killisnoo long and soft like the howl of a wolf till the
women were all atremble and the bucks looking serious

Look I sprang forard pointing my finger into a bunch of
squawseasier to deceive women than men you know Look And I
raised it aloft as though following the flight of a bird Up up
straight overhead making to follow it with my eyes till it disappeared
in the sky

Killisnoo I said looking at Chief George and pointing upward again
Killisnoo

So help me Dick the gammon worked Half of them at least saw Tilly
disappear in the air Theyd drunk my whiskey at Juneau and seen
stranger sights Ill warrant Why should I not do this thing I who
sold bad spirits corked in bottles Some of the women shrieked
Everybody fell to whispering in bunches I folded my arms and held my
head high and they drew further away from me The time was ripe to go
Grab him Chief George cries Three or four of them came at me but I
whirled quick made a couple of passes like to send them after Tilly
and pointed up Touch me Not for the kingdoms of the earth Chief
George harangued them but he couldnt get them to lift a leg Then he
made to take me himself but I repeated the mummery and his grit went out
through his fingers

Let your shamans work wonders the like of which I have done this
night I says Let them call Killisnoo down out of the sky whither I
have sent her But the priests knew their limits May your _klooches_
bear you sons as the spawn of the salmon I says turning to go and
may your totem pole stand long in the land and the smoke of your camp
rise always

But if the beggars could have seen me hitting the high places for the
sloop as soon as I was clear of them theyd thought my own medicine had
got after me Tillyd kept warm by chopping the ice away and was all
ready to cast off Gawd how we ran before it the Taku howling after us
and the freezing seas sweeping over at every clip With everything
battened down me asteering and Tilly chopping ice we held on half the
night till I plumped the sloop ashore on Porcupine Island and we
shivered it out on the beach blankets wet and Tilly drying the matches
on her breast

So I think I know something about it Seven years Dick man and wife
in rough sailing and smooth And then she died in the heart of the
winter died in childbirth up there on the Chilcat Station She held my
hand to the last the ice creeping up inside the door and spreading thick
on the gut of the window Outside the lone howl of the wolf and the
Silence inside death and the Silence Youve never heard the Silence
yet Dick and Gawd grant you dont ever have to hear it when you sit by
the side of death Hear it Ay till the breath whistles like a siren
and the heart booms booms booms like the surf on the shore

Siwash Dick but a woman White Dick white clear through Towards
the last she says Keep my feather bed Tommy keep it always And I
agreed Then she opened her eyes full with the pain Ive been a good
woman to you Tommy and because of that I want you to promiseto
promisethe words seemed to stick in her throatthat when you marry
the woman be white No more Siwash Tommy I know Plenty white women
down to Juneau now I know Your people call you squawman your
women turn their heads to the one side on the street and you do not go
to their cabins like other men Why Your wife Siwash Is it not so
And this is not good Wherefore I die Promise me Kiss me in token of
your promise

I kissed her and she dozed off whispering It is good At the end
that near gone my ear was at her lips she roused for the last time
Remember Tommy remember my feather bed Then she died in
childbirth up there on the Chilcat Station

The tent heeled over and half flattened before the gale Dick refilled
his pipe while Tommy drew the tea and set it aside against Mollys
return

And she of the flashing eyes and Yankee blood Blinded falling
crawling on hand and knee the wind thrust back in her throat by the
wind she was heading for the tent On her shoulders a bulky pack caught
the full fury of the storm She plucked feebly at the knotted flaps but
it was Tommy and Dick who cast them loose Then she set her soul for the
last effort staggered in and fell exhausted on the floor

Tommy unbuckled the straps and took the pack from her As he lifted it
there was a clanging of pots and pans Dick pouring out a mug of
whiskey paused long enough to pass the wink across her body Tommy
winked back His lips pursed the monosyllable clothes but Dick shook
his head reprovingly Here little woman he said after she had drunk
the whiskey and straightened up a bit

Heres some dry togs Climb into them Were going out to extrapeg

So help me Dick thats knocked the edge off her for the rest of this

But its the edge is her saving grace Dick replied ducking his head
to a volley of sleet that drove around a corner of the canvas The edge
that you and Ive got Tommy and the edge of our mothers before us




THE MAN WITH THE GASH


Jacob Kent had suffered from cupidity all the days of his life This in
turn had engendered a chronic distrustfulness and his mind and
character had become so warped that he was a very disagreeable man to
deal with He was also a victim to somnambulic propensities and very
set in his ideas He had been a weaver of cloth from the cradle until
the fever of Klondike had entered his blood and torn him away from his
loom His cabin stood midway between Sixty Mile Post and the Stuart
River and men who made it a custom to travel the trail to Dawson
likened him to a robber baron perched in his fortress and exacting toll
from the caravans that used his illkept roads Since a certain amount
of history was required in the construction of this figure the less
cultured wayfarers from Stuart River were prone to describe him after a
still more primordial fashion in which a command of strong adjectives
was to be chiefly noted

This cabin was not his by the way having been built several years
previously by a couple of miners who had got out a raft of logs at that
point for a grubstake They had been most hospitable lads and after
they abandoned it travelers who knew the route made it an object to
arrive there at nightfall It was very handy saving them all the time
and toil of pitching camp and it was an unwritten rule that the last man
left a neat pile of firewood for the next comer Rarely a night passed
but from half a dozen to a score of men crowded into its shelter Jacob
Kent noted these things exercised squatter sovereignty and moved in
Thenceforth the weary travelers were mulcted a dollar per head for the
privilege of sleeping on the floor Jacob Kent weighing the dust and
never failing to steal the downweight Besides he so contrived that
his transient guests chopped his wood for him and carried his water This
was rank piracy but his victims were an easygoing breed and while they
detested him they yet permitted him to flourish in his sins

One afternoon in April he sat by his doorfor all the world like a
predatory spidermarvelling at the heat of the returning sun and
keeping an eye on the trail for prospective flies The Yukon lay at his
feet a sea of ice disappearing around two great bends to the north and
south and stretching an honest two miles from bank to bank Over its
rough breast ran the sledtrail a slender sunken line eighteen inches
wide and two thousand miles in length with more curses distributed to
the linear foot than any other road in or out of all Christendom

Jacob Kent was feeling particularly good that afternoon The record had
been broken the previous night and he had sold his hospitality to no
less than twentyeight visitors True it had been quite uncomfortable
and four had snored beneath his bunk all night but then it had added
appreciable weight to the sack in which he kept his gold dust That
sack with its glittering yellow treasure was at once the chief delight
and the chief bane of his existence Heaven and hell lay within its
slender mouth In the nature of things there being no privacy to his
oneroomed dwelling he was tortured by a constant fear of theft It
would be very easy for these bearded desperatelooking strangers to make
away with it Often he dreamed that such was the case and awoke in the
grip of nightmare A select number of these robbers haunted him through
his dreams and he came to know them quite well especially the bronzed
leader with the gash on his right cheek This fellow was the most
persistent of the lot and because of him he had in his waking
moments constructed several score of hidingplaces in and about the
cabin After a concealment he would breathe freely again perhaps for
several nights only to collar the Man with the Gash in the very act of
unearthing the sack Then on awakening in the midst of the usual
struggle he would at once get up and transfer the bag to a new and more
ingenious crypt It was not that he was the direct victim of these
phantasms but he believed in omens and thoughttransference and he
deemed these dreamrobbers to be the astral projection of real personages
who happened at those particular moments no matter where they were in
the flesh to be harboring designs in the spirit upon his wealth So
he continued to bleed the unfortunates who crossed his threshold and at
the same time to add to his trouble with every ounce that went into the
sack

As he sat sunning himself a thought came to Jacob Kent that brought him
to his feet with a jerk The pleasures of life had culminated in the
continual weighing and reweighing of his dust but a shadow had been
thrown upon this pleasant avocation which he had hitherto failed to
brush aside His goldscales were quite small in fact their maximum
was a pound and a halfeighteen ounceswhile his hoard mounted up to
something like three and a third times that He had never been able to
weigh it all at one operation and hence considered himself to have been
shut out from a new and most edifying coign of contemplation Being
denied this half the pleasure of possession had been lost nay he felt
that this miserable obstacle actually minimized the fact as it did the
strength of possession It was the solution of this problem flashing
across his mind that had just brought him to his feet He searched the
trail carefully in either direction There was nothing in sight so he
went inside

In a few seconds he had the table cleared away and the scales set up On
one side he placed the stamped disks to the equivalent of fifteen ounces
and balanced it with dust on the other Replacing the weights with dust
he then had thirty ounces precisely balanced These in turn he placed
together on one side and again balanced with more dust By this time the
gold was exhausted and he was sweating liberally He trembled with
ecstasy ravished beyond measure Nevertheless he dusted the sack
thoroughly to the last least grain till the balance was overcome and
one side of the scales sank to the table Equilibrium however was
restored by the addition of a pennyweight and five grains to the opposite
side He stood head thrown back transfixed The sack was empty but
the potentiality of the scales had become immeasurable Upon them he
could weigh any amount from the tiniest grain to pounds upon pounds
Mammon laid hot fingers on his heart The sun swung on its westering way
till it flashed through the open doorway full upon the yellowburdened
scales The precious heaps like the golden breasts of a bronze
Cleopatra flung back the light in a mellow glow Time and space were
not

Gawd blime me but you ave the makin of several quid there avent
you

Jacob Kent wheeled about at the same time reaching for his
doublebarrelled shotgun which stood handy But when his eyes lit on
the intruders face he staggered back dizzily _It was the face of the
Man with the Gash_

The man looked at him curiously

Oh thats all right he said waving his hand deprecatingly You
neednt think as Ill arm you or your blasted dust

Youre a rum un you are he added reflectively as he watched the
sweat pouring from off Kents face and the quavering of his knees

Wy dont you pipe up an say somethin he went on as the other
struggled for breath Wots gone wrong o your gaff Anythink the
matter

Wwwhered you get it Kent at last managed to articulate raising a
shaking forefinger to the ghastly scar which seamed the others cheek

Shipmate stove me down with a marlinspike from the mainroyal An now
as you ave your figgeread in trim wot I want to know is wots it to
you Thats wot I want to knowwots it to you Gawd blime me do it
urt you Aint it smug enough for the likes o you Thats wot I want
to know

No no Kent answered sinking upon a stool with a sickly grin I was
just wondering

Did you ever see the like the other went on truculently

No

Aint it a beute

Yes Kent nodded his head approvingly intent on humoring this strange
visitor but wholly unprepared for the outburst which was to follow his
effort to be agreeable

You blasted bloomin burgooeatin sonofaseaswab Wot do you
mean a sayin the most onsightly thing Gawd Almighty ever put on the
face o man is a beute Wot do you mean you

And thereat this fiery son of the sea broke off into a string of Oriental
profanity mingling gods and devils lineages and men metaphors and
monsters with so savage a virility that Jacob Kent was paralyzed He
shrank back his arms lifted as though to ward off physical violence So
utterly unnerved was he that the other paused in the midswing of a
gorgeous peroration and burst into thunderous laughter

The suns knocked the bottom out o the trail said the Man with the
Gash between departing paroxysms of mirth An I only ope as youll
appreciate the hoppertunity of consortin with a man o my mug Get
steam up in that firebox o yourn Im goin to unrig the dogs an
grub em An dont be shy o the wood my lad theres plenty more
where that come from and its youve got the time to sling an axe An
tote up a bucket o water while youre about it Lively or Ill run you
down so elp me

Such a thing was unheard of Jacob Kent was making the fire chopping
wood packing waterdoing menial tasks for a guest When Jim Cardegee
left Dawson it was with his head filled with the iniquities of this
roadside Shylock and all along the trail his numerous victims had added
to the sum of his crimes Now Jim Cardegee with the sailors love for
a sailors joke had determined when he pulled into the cabin to bring
its inmate down a peg or so That he had succeeded beyond expectation he
could not help but remark though he was in the dark as to the part the
gash on his cheek had played in it But while he could not understand
he saw the terror it created and resolved to exploit it as remorselessly
as would any modern trader a choice bit of merchandise

Strike me blind but youre a ustler he said admiringly his head
cocked to one side as his host bustled about You never ort to ave
gone Klondiking Its the keeper of a pub you was laid out for An
its often as I ave eard the lads up an down the river speak o you
but I adnt no idea you was so jolly nice

Jacob Kent experienced a tremendous yearning to try his shotgun on him
but the fascination of the gash was too potent This was the real Man
with the Gash the man who had so often robbed him in the spirit This
then was the embodied entity of the being whose astral form had been
projected into his dreams the man who had so frequently harbored designs
against his hoard hencethere could be no other conclusionthis Man
with the Gash had now come in the flesh to dispossess him And that
gash He could no more keep his eyes from it than stop the beating of
his heart Try as he would they wandered back to that one point as
inevitably as the needle to the pole

Do it urt you Jim Cardegee thundered suddenly looking up from the
spreading of his blankets and encountering the rapt gaze of the other
It strikes me as ow it ud be the proper thing for you to draw your
jib douse the glim an turn in seein as ow it worrits you Jes lay
to that you swab or so elp me Ill take a pull on your
peakpurchases

Kent was so nervous that it took three puffs to blow out the slushlamp
and he crawled into his blankets without even removing his moccasins The
sailor was soon snoring lustily from his hard bed on the floor but Kent
lay staring up into the blackness one hand on the shotgun resolved not
to close his eyes the whole night He had not had an opportunity to
secrete his five pounds of gold and it lay in the ammunition box at the
head of his bunk But try as he would he at last dozed off with the
weight of his dust heavy on his soul Had he not inadvertently fallen
asleep with his mind in such condition the somnambulic demon would not
have been invoked nor would Jim Cardegee have gone mining next day with
a dishpan

The fire fought a losing battle and at last died away while the frost
penetrated the mossy chinks between the logs and chilled the inner
atmosphere The dogs outside ceased their howling and curled up in the
snow dreamed of salmonstocked heavens where dogdrivers and kindred
taskmasters were not Within the sailor lay like a log while his host
tossed restlessly about the victim of strange fantasies As midnight
drew near he suddenly threw off the blankets and got up It was
remarkable that he could do what he then did without ever striking a
light Perhaps it was because of the darkness that he kept his eyes
shut and perhaps it was for fear he would see the terrible gash on the
cheek of his visitor but be this as it may it is a fact that
unseeing he opened his ammunition box put a heavy charge into the
muzzle of the shotgun without spilling a particle rammed it down with
double wads and then put everything away and got back into bed

Just as daylight laid its steelgray fingers on the parchment window
Jacob Kent awoke Turning on his elbow he raised the lid and peered
into the ammunition box Whatever he saw or whatever he did not see
exercised a very peculiar effect upon him considering his neurotic
temperament He glanced at the sleeping man on the floor let the lid
down gently and rolled over on his back It was an unwonted calm that
rested on his face Not a muscle quivered There was not the least sign
of excitement or perturbation He lay there a long while thinking and
when he got up and began to move about it was in a cool collected
manner without noise and without hurry

It happened that a heavy wooden peg had been driven into the ridgepole
just above Jim Cardegees head Jacob Kent working softly ran a piece
of halfinch manila over it bringing both ends to the ground One end
he tied about his waist and in the other he rove a running noose Then
he cocked his shotgun and laid it within reach by the side of numerous
moosehide thongs By an effort of will he bore the sight of the scar
slipped the noose over the sleepers head and drew it taut by throwing
back on his weight at the same time seizing the gun and bringing it to
bear

Jim Cardegee awoke choking bewildered staring down the twin wells of
steel

Where is it Kent asked at the same time slacking on the rope

You blastedugh

Kent merely threw back his weight shutting off the others wind

BloominBurugh

Where is it Kent repeated

Wot Cardegee asked as soon as he had caught his breath

The golddust

Wot golddust the perplexed sailor demanded

You know well enoughmine

Aint seen nothink of it Wot do ye take me for A safedeposit Wot
ave I got to do with it anyow

Mebbe you know and mebbe you dont know but anyway Im going to stop
your breath till you do know And if you lift a hand Ill blow your
head off

Vast heavin Cardegee roared as the rope tightened

Kent eased away a moment and the sailor wriggling his neck as though
from the pressure managed to loosen the noose a bit and work it up so
the point of contact was just under the chin

Well Kent questioned expecting the disclosure

But Cardegee grinned Go ahead with your angin you bloomin old pot
wolloper

Then as the sailor had anticipated the tragedy became a farce Cardegee
being the heavier of the two Kent throwing his body backward and down
could not lift him clear of the ground Strain and strive to the
uttermost the sailors feet still stuck to the floor and sustained a
part of his weight The remaining portion was supported by the point of
contact just under his chin Failing to swing him clear Kent clung on
resolved to slowly throttle him or force him to tell what he had done
with the hoard But the Man with the Gash would not throttle Five
ten fifteen minutes passed and at the end of that time in despair
Kent let his prisoner down

Well he remarked wiping away the sweat if you wont hang youll
shoot Some men wasnt born to be hanged anyway

An its a pretty mess as youll make o this ere cabin floor
Cardegee was fighting for time Now look ere Ill tell you wot we
do well lay our eads longside an reason together Youve lost some
dust You say as ow I know an I say as ow I dont Lets get a
hobservation an shape a course

Vast heavin Kent dashed in maliciously imitating the others
enunciation Im going to shape all the courses of this shebang and
you observe and if you do anything more Ill bore you as sure as
Moses

For the sake of my mother

Whom God have mercy upon if she loves you Ah Would you He
frustrated a hostile move on the part of the other by pressing the cold
muzzle against his forehead Lay quiet now If you lift as much as a
hair youll get it

It was rather an awkward task with the trigger of the gun always within
pulling distance of the finger but Kent was a weaver and in a few
minutes had the sailor tied hand and foot Then he dragged him without
and laid him by the side of the cabin where he could overlook the river
and watch the sun climb to the meridian

Now Ill give you till noon and then

Wot

Youll be hitting the brimstone trail But if you speak up Ill keep
you till the next bunch of mounted police come by

Well Gawd blime me if this aint a go Ere I be innercent as a
lamb an ere you be lost all o your top amper an out o your
reckonin run me foul an goin to rake me into ellfire You bloomin
old pirut You

Jim Cardegee loosed the strings of his profanity and fairly outdid
himself Jacob Kent brought out a stool that he might enjoy it in
comfort Having exhausted all the possible combinations of his
vocabulary the sailor quieted down to hard thinking his eyes constantly
gauging the progress of the sun which tore up the eastern slope of the
heavens with unseemly haste His dogs surprised that they had not long
since been put to harness crowded around him His helplessness appealed
to the brutes They felt that something was wrong though they knew not
what and they crowded about howling their mournful sympathy

Chook Mushon you Siwashes he cried attempting in a vermicular
way to kick at them and discovering himself to be tottering on the edge
of a declivity As soon as the animals had scattered he devoted himself
to the significance of that declivity which he felt to be there but could
not see Nor was he long in arriving at a correct conclusion In the
nature of things he figured man is lazy He does no more than he has
to When he builds a cabin he must put dirt on the roof From these
premises it was logical that he should carry that dirt no further than
was absolutely necessary Therefore he lay upon the edge of the hole
from which the dirt had been taken to roof Jacob Kents cabin This
knowledge properly utilized might prolong things he thought and he
then turned his attention to the moosehide thongs which bound him His
hands were tied behind him and pressing against the snow they were wet
with the contact This moistening of the rawhide he knew would tend to
make it stretch and without apparent effort he endeavored to stretch
it more and more

He watched the trail hungrily and when in the direction of Sixty Mile a
dark speck appeared for a moment against the white background of an ice
jam he cast an anxious eye at the sun It had climbed nearly to the
zenith Now and again he caught the black speck clearing the hills of
ice and sinking into the intervening hollows but he dared not permit
himself more than the most cursory glances for fear of rousing his
enemys suspicion Once when Jacob Kent rose to his feet and searched
the trail with care Cardegee was frightened but the dogsled had struck
a piece of trail running parallel with a jam and remained out of sight
till the danger was past

Ill see you ung for this Cardegee threatened attempting to draw the
others attention An youll rot in ell jes you see if you dont

I say he cried after another pause dye blieve in ghosts Kents
sudden start made him sure of his ground and he went on Now a ghost
as the right to aunt a man wot dont do wot he says and you cant
shuffle me off till eight bellswot I mean is twelve oclockcan you
Cos if you do itll appen as ow Ill aunt you Dye ear A
minute a second too quick an Ill aunt you so elp me I will

Jacob Kent looked dubious but declined to talk

Ows your chronometer Wots your longitude Ow do you know as your
times correct Cardegee persisted vainly hoping to beat his
executioner out of a few minutes Is it Barracks time you ave or is
it the Company time Cos if you do it before the stroke o the bell
Ill not rest I give you fair warnin Ill come back An if you
avent the time ow will you know Thats wot I wantow will you
tell

Ill send you off all right Kent replied Got a sundial here

No good Thirtytwo degrees variation o the needle

Stakes are all set

Ow did you set em Compass

No lined them up with the North Star

Sure

Sure

Cardegee groaned then stole a glance at the trail The sled was just
clearing a rise barely a mile away and the dogs were in full lope
running lightly

Ow close is the shadows to the line

Kent walked to the primitive timepiece and studied it Three inches
he announced after a careful survey

Say jes sing out eight bells afore you pull the gun will you

Kent agreed and they lapsed into silence The thongs about Cardegees
wrists were slowly stretching and he had begun to work them over his
hands

Say ow close is the shadows

One inch

The sailor wriggled slightly to assure himself that he would topple over
at the right moment and slipped the first turn over his hands

Ow close

Half an inch Just then Kent heard the jarring churn of the runners
and turned his eyes to the trail The driver was lying flat on the sled
and the dogs swinging down the straight stretch to the cabin Kent
whirled back bringing his rifle to shoulder

It aint eight bells yet Cardegee expostulated Ill aunt you
sure

Jacob Kent faltered He was standing by the sundial perhaps ten paces
from his victim The man on the sled must have seen that something
unusual was taking place for he had risen to his knees his whip singing
viciously among the dogs

The shadows swept into line Kent looked along the sights

Make ready he commanded solemnly Eight b

But just a fraction of a second too soon Cardegee rolled backward into
the hole Kent held his fire and ran to the edge Bang The gun
exploded full in the sailors face as he rose to his feet But no smoke
came from the muzzle instead a sheet of flame burst from the side of
the barrel near its butt and Jacob Kent went down The dogs dashed up
the bank dragging the sled over his body and the driver sprang off as
Jim Cardegee freed his hands and drew himself from the hole

Jim The newcomer recognized him Whats the matter

Wots the matter Oh nothink at all It jest appens as I do little
things like this for my ealth Wots the matter you bloomin idjit
Wots the matter eh Cast me loose or Ill show you wot Urry up or
Ill olystone the decks with you

Huh he added as the other went to work with his sheathknife Wots
the matter I want to know Jes tell me that will you wots the
matter Hey

Kent was quite dead when they rolled him over The gun an
oldfashioned heavyweighted muzzleloader lay near him Steel and
wood had parted company Near the butt of the righthand barrel with
lips pressed outward gaped a fissure several inches in length The
sailor picked it up curiously A glittering stream of yellow dust ran
out through the crack The facts of the case dawned upon Jim Cardegee

Strike me standin he roared eres a go Eres is bloomin dust
Gawd blime me an you too Charley if you dont run an get the dish
pan




JAN THE UNREPENTANT


 For theres never a law of God or man
 Runs north of Fiftythree

Jan rolled over clawing and kicking He was fighting hand and foot now
and he fought grimly silently Two of the three men who hung upon him
shouted directions to each other and strove to curb the short hairy
devil who would not curb The third man howled His finger was between
Jans teeth

Quit yer tantrums Jan an ease up panted Red Bill getting a
stranglehold on Jans neck Why on earth cant yeh hang decent and
peaceable

But Jan kept his grip on the third mans finger and squirmed over the
floor of the tent into the pots and pans

Youah no gentleman suh reproved Mr Taylor his body following his
finger and endeavoring to accommodate itself to every jerk of Jans
head You hev killed Mistah Gordon as brave and honorable a gentleman
as ever hit the trail aftah the dogs Youah a murderah suh and without
honah

An yer no comrade broke in Red Bill If you was youd hang thout
rampin around an roarin Come on Jan theres a good fellow Dont
give us no more trouble Jes quit an well hang yeh neat and handy
an be done with it

Steady all Lawson the sailorman bawled Jam his head into the
bean pot and batten down

But my fingah suh Mr Taylor protested

Leggo with yr finger then Always in the way

But I cant Mistah Lawson Its in the critters gullet and nigh
chewed off as t is

Stand by for stays As Lawson gave the warning Jan half lifted
himself and the struggling quartet floundered across the tent into a
muddle of furs and blankets In its passage it cleared the body of a
man who lay motionless bleeding from a bulletwound in the neck

All this was because of the madness which had come upon Janthe madness
which comes upon a man who has stripped off the raw skin of earth and
grovelled long in primal nakedness and before whose eyes rises the fat
vales of the homeland and into whose nostrils steals the whiff of bay
and grass and flower and newturned soil Through five frigid years
Jan had sown the seed Stuart River Forty Mile Circle City Koyokuk
Kotzebue had marked his bleak and strenuous agriculture and now it was
Nome that bore the harvestnot the Nome of golden beaches and ruby
sands but the Nome of 97 before Anvil City was located or Eldorado
District organized John Gordon was a Yankee and should have known
better But he passed the sharp word at a time when Jans bloodshot
eyes blazed and his teeth gritted in torment And because of this there
was a smell of saltpetre in the tent and one lay quietly while the
other fought like a cornered rat and refused to hang in the decent and
peacable manner suggested by his comrades

If you will allow me Mistah Lawson befoah we go further in this
rumpus I would say it wah a good idea to pry this hyer varmints teeth
apart Neither will he bite off nor will he let go He has the wisdom
of the sarpint suh the wisdom of the sarpint

Lemme get the hatchet to him vociferated the sailor Lemme get the
hatchet He shoved the steel edge close to Mr Taylors finger and used
the mans teeth as a fulcrum Jan held on and breathed through his nose
snorting like a grampus Steady all Now she takes it

Thank you suh it is a powerful relief And Mr Taylor proceeded to
gather into his arms the victims wildly waving legs

But Jan upreared in his Berserker rage bleeding frothing cursing five
frozen years thawing into sudden hell They swayed backward and forward
panted sweated like some cyclopean manylegged monster rising from the
lower deeps The slushlamp went over drowned in its own fat while the
midday twilight scarce percolated through the dirty canvas of the tent

For the love of Gawd Jan get yer senses back pleaded Red Bill We
aint goin to hurt yeh r kill yeh r anythin of that sort Jes
want to hang yeh thats all an you amessin round an rampagin
somethin terrible To think of travellin trail together an then bein
treated thisa way Wouldnt bleeved it of yeh Jan

Hes got too much steerageway Grab holt his legs Taylor and heavem
over

Yes suh Mistah Lawson Do you press youah weight above after I give
the word The Kentuckian groped about him in the murky darkness Now
suh now is the accepted time

There was a great surge and a quarter of a ton of human flesh tottered
and crashed to its fall against the sidewall Pegs drew and guyropes
parted and the tent collapsing wrapped the battle in its greasy folds

Yer only makin it harder fer yerself Red Bill continued at the same
time driving both his thumbs into a hairy throat the possessor of which
he had pinned down Youve made nuisance enough a ready an itll
take half the day to get things straightened when weve strung yeh up

Ill thank you to leave go suh spluttered Mr Taylor

Red Bill grunted and loosed his grip and the twain crawled out into the
open At the same instant Jan kicked clear of the sailor and took to
his heels across the snow

Hi you lazy devils Buck Bright Sicm Pull m down sang out
Lawson lunging through the snow after the fleeing man Buck and Bright
followed by the rest of the dogs outstripped him and rapidly overhauled
the murderer

There was no reason that these men should do this no reason for Jan to
run away no reason for them to attempt to prevent him On the one hand
stretched the barren snowland on the other the frozen sea With
neither food nor shelter he could not run far All they had to do was
to wait till he wandered back to the tent as he inevitably must when
the frost and hunger laid hold of him But these men did not stop to
think There was a certain taint of madness running in the veins of all
of them Besides blood had been spilled and upon them was the blood
lust thick and hot Vengeance is mine saith the Lord and He saith
it in temperate climes where the warm sun steals away the energies of
men But in the Northland they have discovered that prayer is only
efficacious when backed by muscle and they are accustomed to doing
things for themselves God is everywhere they have heard but he flings
a shadow over the land for half the year that they may not find him so
they grope in darkness and it is not to be wondered that they often
doubt and deem the Decalogue out of gear

Jan ran blindly reckoning not of the way of his feet for he was
mastered by the verb to live To live To exist Buck flashed gray
through the air but missed The man struck madly at him and stumbled
Then the white teeth of Bright closed on his mackinaw jacket and he
pitched into the snow _To live_ _To exist_ He fought wildly as
ever the centre of a tossing heap of men and dogs His left hand
gripped a wolfdog by the scruff of the back while the arm was passed
around the neck of Lawson Every struggle of the dog helped to throttle
the hapless sailor Jans right hand was buried deep in the curling
tendrils of Red Bills shaggy head and beneath all Mr Taylor lay
pinned and helpless It was a deadlock for the strength of his madness
was prodigious but suddenly without apparent reason Jan loosed his
various grips and rolled over quietly on his back His adversaries drew
away a little dubious and disconcerted Jan grinned viciously

Mine friends he said still grinning you haf asked me to be
politeful und now I am politeful Vot piziness vood you do mit me

Thats right Jan Be cam soothed Red Bill I knowed youd come to
yer senses afore long Jes be cam now an well do the trick with
neatness and despatch

Vot piziness Vot trick

The hangin An yeh oughter thank yer lucky stars for havin a man
what knows his business Ive did it afore now moren once down in the
States an I can do it to a T

Hang who Me

Yep

Ha ha Shust hear der man speak foolishness Gif me a hand Bill und
I vill get up und be hung He crawled stiffly to his feet and looked
about him Herr Gott listen to der man He vood hang me Ho ho ho
I tank not Yes I tank not

And I tank yes you swab Lawson spoke up mockingly at the same time
cutting a sledlashing and coiling it up with ominous care Judge Lynch
holds court this day

Von liddle while Jan stepped back from the proffered noose I haf
somedings to ask und to make der great proposition Kentucky you know
about der Shudge Lynch

Yes suh It is an institution of free men and of gentlemen and it is
an ole one and timehonored Corruption may wear the robe of magistracy
suh but Judge Lynch can always be relied upon to give justice without
court fees I repeat suh without court fees Law may be bought and
sold but in this enlightened land justice is free as the air we breathe
strong as the licker we drink prompt as

Cut it short Find out what the beggar wants interrupted Lawson
spoiling the peroration

Vell Kentucky tell me dis von man kill von odder man Shudge Lynch
hang dot man

If the evidence is strong enoughyes suh

An the evidence in this here case is strong enough to hang a dozen men
Jan broke in Red Bill

Nefer you mind Bill I talk mit you next Now von anodder ding I ask
Kentucky If Shudge Lynch hang not der man vot den

If Judge Lynch does not hang the man then the man goes free and his
hands are washed clean of blood And further suh our great and
glorious constitution has said to wit that no man may twice be placed
in jeopardy of his life for one and the same crime or words to that
effect

Unt dey cant shoot him or hit him mit a club over der head alongside
or do nodings more mit him

No suh

Goot You hear vot Kentucky speaks all you noddleheads Now I talk
mit Bill You know der piziness Bill und you hang me up brown eh Vot
you say

Betcher life an Jan if yeh dont give no more trouble yell be
almighty proud of the job Im a connesoor

You haf der great head Bill und know somedings or two Und you know

Bill nodded

to haf der rope Lawson haf der rope Goot Und tird ding you haf to
haf someding to tie der rope to Sling your eyes over der landscape und
find der tird ding to tie der rope to Eh Vot you say

Mechanically they swept the ice and snow with their eyes It was a
homogeneous scene devoid of contrasts or bold contours dreary
desolate and monotonousthe icepacked sea the slow slope of the
beach the background of lowlying hills and over all thrown the endless
mantle of snow No trees no bluffs no cabins no telegraph poles
nothin moaned Red Bill nothin respectable enough nor big enough to
swing the toes of a fivefoot man clear o the ground I give it up He
looked yearningly at that portion of Jans anatomy which joins the head
and shoulders Give it up he repeated sadly to Lawson Throw the
rope down Gawd never intended this here country for livin purposes
an thats a cold frozen fact

Jan grinned triumphantly I tank I go mit der tent und haf a smoke

Ostensiblee yr correct Bill me son spoke up Lawson but yr a
dummy and you can lay to that for another cold frozen fact Takes a sea
farmer to learn you landsmen things Ever hear of a pair of shears Then
clap yr eyes to this

The sailor worked rapidly From the pile of dunnage where they had
pulled up the boat the preceding fall he unearthed a pair of long oars
These he lashed together at nearly right angles close to the ends of
the blades Where the handles rested he kicked holes through the snow to
the sand At the point of intersection he attached two guyropes making
the end of one fast to a cake of beachice The other guy he passed over
to Red Bill Here me son lay holt o that and run it out

And to his horror Jan saw his gallows rise in the air No no he
cried recoiling and putting up his fists It is not goot I vill not
hang Come you noddleheads I vill lick you all together von after
der odder I vill blay hell I vill do eferydings Und I vill die
pefore I hang

The sailor permitted the two other men to clinch with the mad creature
They rolled and tossed about furiously tearing up snow and tundra their
fierce struggle writing a tragedy of human passion on the white sheet
spread by nature And ever and anon a hand or foot of Jan emerged from
the tangle to be gripped by Lawson and lashed fast with ropeyarns
Pawing clawing blaspheming he was conquered and bound inch by inch
and drawn to where the inexorable shears lay like a pair of gigantic
dividers on the snow Red Bill adjusted the noose placing the hangmans
knot properly under the left ear Mr Taylor and Lawson tailed onto the
runningguy ready at the word to elevate the gallows Bill lingered
contemplating his work with artistic appreciation

Herr Gott Vood you look at it

The horror in Jans voice caused the rest to desist The fallen tent had
uprisen and in the gathering twilight it flapped ghostly arms about and
titubated toward them drunkenly But the next instant John Gordon found
the opening and crawled forth

What the flaming For the moment his voice died away in his throat
as his eyes took in the tableau Hold on Im not dead he cried out
coming up to the group with stormy countenance

Allow me Mistah Gordon to congratulate you upon youah escape Mr
Taylor ventured A close shave suh a powahful close shave

 Congratulate hell I might have been dead and rotten and no thanks to
you you And thereat John Gordon delivered himself of a vigorous
flood of English terse intensive denunciative and composed solely of
expletives and adjectives

Simply creased me he went on when he had eased himself sufficiently
Ever crease cattle Taylor

Yes suh many a time down in Gods country

Just so Thats what happened to me Bullet just grazed the base of my
skull at the top of the neck Stunned me but no harm done He turned
to the bound man Get up Jan Im going to lick you to a standstill
or youre going to apologize The rest of you lads stand clear

I tank not Shust tie me loose und you see replied Jan the
Unrepentant the devil within him still unconquered Und after as I
lick you I take der rest of der noddleheads von after der odder

GRIT OF WOMEN


A wolfish head wistfuleyed and frostrimed thrust aside the
tentflaps

Hi Chook Siwash Chook you limb of Satan chorused the protesting
inmates Bettles rapped the dog sharply with a tin plate and it
withdrew hastily Louis Savoy refastened the flaps kicked a fryingpan
over against the bottom and warmed his hands It was very cold without
Fortyeight hours gone the spirit thermometer had burst at sixtyeight
below and since that time it had grown steadily and bitterly colder
There was no telling when the snap would end And it is poor policy
unless the gods will it to venture far from a stove at such times or to
increase the quantity of cold atmosphere one must breathe Men sometimes
do it and sometimes they chill their lungs This leads up to a dry
hacking cough noticeably irritable when bacon is being fried After
that somewhere along in the spring or summer a hole is burned in the
frozen muck Into this a mans carcass is dumped covered over with
moss and left with the assurance that it will rise on the crack of Doom
wholly and frigidly intact For those of little faith sceptical of
material integration on that fateful day no fitter country than the
Klondike can be recommended to die in But it is not to be inferred from
this that it is a fit country for living purposes

It was very cold without but it was not overwarm within The only
article which might be designated furniture was the stove and for this
the men were frank in displaying their preference Upon half of the
floor pine boughs had been cast above this were spread the
sleepingfurs beneath lay the winters snowfall The remainder of the
floor was moccasinpacked snow littered with pots and pans and the
general _impedimenta_ of an Arctic camp The stove was red and roaring
hot but only a bare three feet away lay a block of ice as sharpedged
and dry as when first quarried from the creek bottom The pressure of
the outside cold forced the inner heat upward Just above the stove
where the pipe penetrated the roof was a tiny circle of dry canvas
next with the pipe always as centre a circle of steaming canvas next a
damp and moistureexuding ring and finally the rest of the tent
sidewalls and top coated with a halfinch of dry white
crystalencrusted frost

_Oh_ OH OH A young fellow lying asleep in the furs bearded and
wan and weary raised a moan of pain and without waking increased the
pitch and intensity of his anguish His body halflifted from the
blankets and quivered and shrank spasmodically as though drawing away
from a bed of nettles

Rollm over ordered Bettles Hes crampin

And thereat with pitiless goodwill he was pitched upon and rolled and
thumped and pounded by halfadozen willing comrades

Damn the trail he muttered softly as he threw off the robes and sat
up Ive run across country played quarter three seasons handrunning
and hardened myself in all manner of ways and then I pilgrim it into
this Godforsaken land and find myself an effeminate Athenian without the
simplest rudiments of manhood He hunched up to the fire and rolled a
cigarette Oh Im not whining I can take my medicine all right all
right but Im just decently ashamed of myself thats all Here I am
on top of a dirty thirty miles as knocked up and stiff and sore as a
pinktea degenerate after a fivemile walk on a country turnpike Bah
It makes me sick Got a match Dont git the tantrums youngster
Bettles passed over the required firestick and waxed patriarchal Yeve
gotter low some for the breakinin Sufferin cracky dont I
recollect the first time I hit the trail Stiff Ive seen the time
itd take me ten minutes to git my mouth from the waterhole an come to

man to the bosom of Abraham afore his right and proper time

You bet

But there was Axel Gunderson Prince spoke up The great Scandinavian
with the tragic events which shadowed his passing had made a deep mark
on the mining engineer He lies up there somewhere He swept his
hand in the vague direction of the mysterious east

Biggest man that ever turned his heels to Salt Water or run a moose
down with sheer grit supplemented Bettles but hes the provetherule
exception Look at his woman Ungatip the scales at a hundred an
ten clean meat an nary ounce to spare Shed bank grit gainst his for
all there was in him an see him an go him better if it was possible
Nothing over the earth or in it or under it she wouldnt a done

But she loved him objected the engineer

T aint that It

Look you brothers broke in Sitka Charley from his seat on the grub
box Ye have spoken of the streak of fat that runs in big mens
muscles of the grit of women and the love and ye have spoken fair but
I have in mind things which happened when the land was young and the
fires of men apart as the stars It was then I had concern with a big
man and a streak of fat and a woman And the woman was small but her
heart was greater than the beefheart of the man and she had grit And
we traveled a weary trail even to the Salt Water and the cold was
bitter the snow deep the hunger great And the womans love was a
mighty loveno more can man say than this

He paused and with the hatchet broke pieces of ice from the large chunk
beside him These he threw into the gold pan on the stove where the
drinkingwater thawed The men drew up closer and he of the cramps
sought greater comfort vainly for his stiffened body

Brothers my blood is red with Siwash but my heart is white To the
faults of my fathers I owe the one to the virtues of my friends the
other A great truth came to me when I was yet a boy I learned that to
your kind and you was given the earth that the Siwash could not
withstand you and like the caribou and the bear must perish in the
cold So I came into the warm and sat among you by your fires and
behold I became one of you I have seen much in my time I have known
strange things and bucked big on big trails with men of many breeds
And because of these things I measure deeds after your manner and judge
men and think thoughts Wherefore when I speak harshly of one of your
own kind I know you will not take it amiss and when I speak high of one
of my fathers people you will not take it upon you to say Sitka
Charley is Siwash and there is a crooked light in his eyes and small
honor to his tongue Is it not so

Deep down in throat the circle vouchsafed its assent

The woman was Passuk I got her in fair trade from her people who were
of the Coast and whose Chilcat totem stood at the head of a salt arm of
the sea My heart did not go out to the woman nor did I take stock of
her looks For she scarce took her eyes from the ground and she was
timid and afraid as girls will be when cast into a strangers arms whom
they have never seen before As I say there was no place in my heart
for her to creep for I had a great journey in mind and stood in need of
one to feed my dogs and to lift a paddle with me through the long river
days One blanket would cover the twain so I chose Passuk

Have I not said I was a servant to the Government If not it is well
that ye know So I was taken on a warship sleds and dogs and evaporated
foods and with me came Passuk And we went north to the winter icerim
of Bering Sea where we were landedmyself and Passuk and the dogs I
was also given moneys of the Government for I was its servant and
charts of lands which the eyes of man had never dwelt upon and messages
These messages were sealed and protected shrewdly from the weather and
I was to deliver them to the whaleships of the Arctic icebound by the
great Mackenzie Never was there so great a river forgetting only our
own Yukon the Mother of all Rivers

All of which is neither here nor there for my story deals not with the
whaleships nor the bergbound winter I spent by the Mackenzie
Afterward in the spring when the days lengthened and there was a crust
to the snow we came south Passuk and I to the Country of the Yukon A
weary journey but the sun pointed out the way of our feet It was a
naked land then as I have said and we worked up the current with pole
and paddle till we came to Forty Mile Good it was to see white faces
once again so we put into the bank And that winter was a hard winter
The darkness and the cold drew down upon us and with them the famine To
each man the agent of the Company gave forty pounds of flour and twenty
of bacon There were no beans And the dogs howled always and there
were flat bellies and deeplined faces and strong men became weak and
weak men died There was also much scurvy

Then came we together in the store one night and the empty shelves made
us feel our own emptiness the more We talked low by the light of the
fire for the candles had been set aside for those who might yet gasp in
the spring Discussion was held and it was said that a man must go
forth to the Salt Water and tell to the world our misery At this all
eyes turned to me for it was understood that I was a great traveler It
is seven hundred miles said I to Haines Mission by the sea and every
inch of it snowshoe work Give me the pick of your dogs and the best of
your grub and I will go And with me shall go Passuk

To this they were agreed But there arose one Long Jeff a Yankeeman
bigboned and bigmuscled Also his talk was big He too was a mighty
traveler he said born to the snowshoe and bred up on buffalo milk He
would go with me in case I fell by the trail that he might carry the
word on to the Mission I was young and I knew not Yankeemen How was
I to know that big talk betokened the streak of fat or that Yankeemen
who did great things kept their teeth together So we took the pick of
the dogs and the best of the grub and struck the trail we
threePassuk Long Jeff and I

Well ye have broken virgin snow labored at the geepole and are not
unused to the packed riverjams so I will talk little of the toil save
that on some days we made ten miles and on others thirty but more often
ten And the best of the grub was not good while we went on stint from
the start Likewise the pick of the dogs was poor and we were hard put
to keep them on their legs At the White River our three sleds became
two sleds and we had only come two hundred miles But we lost nothing
the dogs that left the traces went into the bellies of those that
remained

Not a greeting not a curl of smoke till we made Pelly Here I had
counted on grub and here I had counted on leaving Long Jeff who was
whining and trailsore But the factors lungs were wheezing his eyes
bright his cache nigh empty and he showed us the empty cache of the
missionary also his grave with the rocks piled high to keep off the
dogs There was a bunch of Indians there but babies and old men there
were none and it was clear that few would see the spring

So we pulled on lightstomached and heavyhearted with half a thousand
miles of snow and silence between us and Haines Mission by the sea The
darkness was at its worst and at midday the sun could not clear the sky
line to the south But the icejams were smaller the going better so I
pushed the dogs hard and traveled late and early As I said at Forty
Mile every inch of it was snowshoe work And the shoes made great
sores on our feet which cracked and scabbed but would not heal And
every day these sores grew more grievous till in the morning when we
girded on the shoes Long Jeff cried like a child I put him at the fore
of the light sled to break trail but he slipped off the shoes for
comfort Because of this the trail was not packed his moccasins made
great holes and into these holes the dogs wallowed The bones of the
dogs were ready to break through their hides and this was not good for
them So I spoke hard words to the man and he promised and broke his
word Then I beat him with the dogwhip and after that the dogs
wallowed no more He was a child what of the pain and the streak of
fat

But Passuk While the man lay by the fire and wept she cooked and in
the morning helped lash the sleds and in the evening to unlash them And
she saved the dogs Ever was she to the fore lifting the webbed shoes
and making the way easy Passukhow shall I sayI took it for granted
that she should do these things and thought no more about it For my
mind was busy with other matters and besides I was young in years and
knew little of woman It was only on looking back that I came to
understand

And the man became worthless The dogs had little strength in them but
he stole rides on the sled when he lagged behind Passuk said she would
take the one sled so the man had nothing to do In the morning I gave
him his fair share of grub and started him on the trail alone Then the
woman and I broke camp packed the sleds and harnessed the dogs By
midday when the sun mocked us we would overtake the man with the tears
frozen on his cheeks and pass him In the night we made camp set aside
his fair share of grub and spread his furs Also we made a big fire
that he might see And hours afterward he would come limping in and eat
his grub with moans and groans and sleep He was not sick this man He
was only trailsore and tired and weak with hunger But Passuk and I
were trailsore and tired and weak with hunger and we did all the work
and he did none But he had the streak of fat of which our brother
Bettles has spoken Further we gave the man always his fair share of
grub

Then one day we met two ghosts journeying through the Silence They
were a man and a boy and they were white The ice had opened on Lake Le
Barge and through it had gone their main outfit One blanket each
carried about his shoulders At night they built a fire and crouched
over it till morning They had a little flour This they stirred in
warm water and drank The man showed me eight cups of flourall they
had and Pelly stricken with famine two hundred miles away They said
also that there was an Indian behind that they had whacked fair but
that he could not keep up I did not believe they had whacked fair else
would the Indian have kept up But I could give them no grub They
strove to steal a dogthe fattest which was very thinbut I shoved my
pistol in their faces and told them begone And they went away like
drunken men through the Silence toward Pelly

I had three dogs now and one sled and the dogs were only bones and
hair When there is little wood the fire burns low and the cabin grows
cold So with us With little grub the frost bites sharp and our faces
were black and frozen till our own mothers would not have known us And
our feet were very sore In the morning when I hit the trail I sweated
to keep down the cry when the pain of the snowshoes smote me Passuk
never opened her lips but stepped to the fore to break the way The man
howled

The Thirty Mile was swift and the current ate away the ice from
beneath and there were many airholes and cracks and much open water
One day we came upon the man resting for he had gone ahead as was his
wont in the morning But between us was open water This he had passed
around by taking to the rimice where it was too narrow for a sled So
we found an icebridge Passuk weighed little and went first with a
long pole crosswise in her hands in chance she broke through But she
was light and her shoes large and she passed over Then she called the
dogs But they had neither poles nor shoes and they broke through and
were swept under by the water I held tight to the sled from behind
till the traces broke and the dogs went on down under the ice There was
little meat to them but I had counted on them for a weeks grub and
they were gone

The next morning I divided all the grub which was little into three
portions And I told Long Jeff that he could keep up with us or not as
he saw fit for we were going to travel light and fast But he raised
his voice and cried over his sore feet and his troubles and said harsh
things against comradeship Passuks feet were sore and my feet were
soreay sorer than his for we had worked with the dogs also we
looked to see Long Jeff swore he would die before he hit the trail
again so Passuk took a fur robe and I a cooking pot and an axe and we
made ready to go But she looked on the mans portion and said It is
wrong to waste good food on a baby He is better dead I shook my head
and said nothat a comrade once was a comrade always Then she spoke of
the men of Forty Mile that they were many men and good and that they
looked to me for grub in the spring But when I still said no she
snatched the pistol from my belt quick and as our brother Bettles has
spoken Long Jeff went to the bosom of Abraham before his time I chided
Passuk for this but she showed no sorrow nor was she sorrowful And in
my heart I knew she was right

Sitka Charley paused and threw pieces of ice into the gold pan on the
stove The men were silent and their backs chilled to the sobbing cries
of the dogs as they gave tongue to their misery in the outer cold

And day by day we passed in the snow the sleepingplaces of the two
ghostsPassuk and Iand we knew we would be glad for such ere we made
Salt Water Then we came to the Indian like another ghost with his
face set toward Pelly They had not whacked up fair the man and the
boy he said and he had had no flour for three days Each night he
boiled pieces of his moccasins in a cup and ate them He did not have
much moccasins left And he was a Coast Indian and told us these things
through Passuk who talked his tongue He was a stranger in the Yukon
and he knew not the way but his face was set to Pelly How far was it
Two sleeps ten a hundredhe did not know but he was going to Pelly
It was too far to turn back he could only keep on

He did not ask for grub for he could see we too were hard put Passuk
looked at the man and at me as though she were of two minds like a
mother partridge whose young are in trouble So I turned to her and
said This man has been dealt unfair Shall I give him of our grub a
portion I saw her eyes light as with quick pleasure but she looked
long at the man and at me and her mouth drew close and hard and she
said No The Salt Water is afar off and Death lies in wait Better
it is that he take this stranger man and let my man Charley pass So
the man went away in the Silence toward Pelly That night she wept
Never had I seen her weep before Nor was it the smoke of the fire for
the wood was dry wood So I marveled at her sorrow and thought her
womans heart had grown soft at the darkness of the trail and the pain

Life is a strange thing Much have I thought on it and pondered long
yet daily the strangeness of it grows not less but more Why this
longing for Life It is a game which no man wins To live is to toil
hard and to suffer sore till Old Age creeps heavily upon us and we
throw down our hands on the cold ashes of dead fires It is hard to
live In pain the babe sucks his first breath in pain the old man gasps
his last and all his days are full of trouble and sorrow yet he goes
down to the open arms of Death stumbling falling with head turned
backward fighting to the last And Death is kind It is only Life and
the things of Life that hurt Yet we love Life and we hate Death It
is very strange

We spoke little Passuk and I in the days which came In the night we
lay in the snow like dead people and in the morning we went on our way
walking like dead people And all things were dead There were no
ptarmigan no squirrels no snowshoe rabbitsnothing The river made
no sound beneath its white robes The sap was frozen in the forest And
it became cold as now and in the night the stars drew near and large
and leaped and danced and in the day the sundogs mocked us till we saw
many suns and all the air flashed and sparkled and the snow was diamond
dust And there was no heat no sound only the bitter cold and the
Silence As I say we walked like dead people as in a dream and we
kept no count of time Only our faces were set to Salt Water our souls
strained for Salt Water and our feet carried us toward Salt Water We
camped by the Tahkeena and knew it not Our eyes looked upon the White
Horse but we saw it not Our feet trod the portage of the Canyon but
they felt it not We felt nothing And we fell often by the way but we
fell always with our faces toward Salt Water

Our last grub went and we had shared fair Passuk and I but she fell
more often and at Caribou Crossing her strength left her And in the
morning we lay beneath the one robe and did not take the trail It was
in my mind to stay there and meet Death handinhand with Passuk for I
had grown old and had learned the love of woman Also it was eighty
miles to Haines Mission and the great Chilcoot far above the timber
line reared his stormswept head between But Passuk spoke to me low
with my ear against her lips that I might hear And now because she
need not fear my anger she spoke her heart and told me of her love and
of many things which I did not understand

And she said You are my man Charley and I have been a good woman to
you And in all the days I have made your fire and cooked your food
and fed your dogs and lifted paddle or broken trail I have not
complained Nor did I say that there was more warmth in the lodge of my
father or that there was more grub on the Chilcat When you have
spoken I have listened When you have ordered I have obeyed Is it
not so Charley

And I said Ay it is so

And she said When first you came to the Chilcat nor looked upon me
but bought me as a man buys a dog and took me away my heart was hard
against you and filled with bitterness and fear But that was long ago
For you were kind to me Charley as a good man is kind to his dog Your
heart was cold and there was no room for me yet you dealt me fair and
your ways were just And I was with you when you did bold deeds and led
great ventures and I measured you against the men of other breeds and I
saw you stood among them full of honor and your word was wise your
tongue true And I grew proud of you till it came that you filled all
my heart and all my thought was of you You were as the midsummer sun
when its golden trail runs in a circle and never leaves the sky And
whatever way I cast my eyes I beheld the sun But your heart was ever
cold Charley and there was no room

And I said It is so It was cold and there was no room But that is
past Now my heart is like the snowfall in the spring when the sun has
come back There is a great thaw and a bending a sound of running
waters and a budding and sprouting of green things And there is
drumming of partridges and songs of robins and great music for the
winter is broken Passuk and I have learned the love of woman

She smiled and moved for me to draw her closer And she said I am
glad After that she lay quiet for a long time breathing softly her
head upon my breast Then she whispered The trail ends here and I am
tired But first I would speak of other things In the long ago when I
was a girl on the Chilcat I played alone among the skin bales of my
fathers lodge for the men were away on the hunt and the women and boys
were dragging in the meat It was in the spring and I was alone A
great brown bear just awake from his winters sleep hungry his fur
hanging to the bones in flaps of leanness shoved his head within the
lodge and said Oof My brother came running back with the first sled
of meat And he fought the bear with burning sticks from the fire and
the dogs in their harnesses with the sled behind them fell upon the
bear There was a great battle and much noise They rolled in the fire
the skin bales were scattered the lodge overthrown But in the end the
bear lay dead with the fingers of my brother in his mouth and the marks
of his claws upon my brothers face Did you mark the Indian by the
Pelly trail his mitten which had no thumb his hand which he warmed by
our fire He was my brother And I said he should have no grub And he
went away in the Silence without grub

This my brothers was the love of Passuk who died in the snow by the
Caribou Crossing It was a mighty love for she denied her brother for
the man who led her away on weary trails to a bitter end And further
such was this womans love she denied herself Ere her eyes closed for
the last time she took my hand and slipped it under her squirrelskin
_parka_ to her waist I felt there a wellfilled pouch and learned the
secret of her lost strength Day by day we had shared fair to the last
least bit and day by day but half her share had she eaten The other
half had gone into the wellfilled pouch

And she said This is the end of the trail for Passuk but your trail
Charley leads on and on over the great Chilcoot down to Haines Mission
and the sea And it leads on and on by the light of many suns over
unknown lands and strange waters and it is full of years and honors and
great glories It leads you to the lodges of many women and good women
but it will never lead you to a greater love than the love of Passuk

And I knew the woman spoke true But a madness came upon me and I
threw the wellfilled pouch from me and swore that my trail had reached
an end till her tired eyes grew soft with tears and she said Among
men has Sitka Charley walked in honor and ever has his word been true
Does he forget that honor now and talk vain words by the Caribou
Crossing Does he remember no more the men of Forty Mile who gave him
of their grub the best of their dogs the pick Ever has Passuk been
proud of her man Let him lift himself up gird on his snowshoes and
begone that she may still keep her pride

And when she grew cold in my arms I arose and sought out the
wellfilled pouch and girt on my snowshoes and staggered along the
trail for there was a weakness in my knees and my head was dizzy and
in my ears there was a roaring and a flashing of fire upon my eyes The
forgotten trails of boyhood came back to me I sat by the full pots of
the _potlach_ feast and raised my voice in song and danced to the
chanting of the men and maidens and the booming of the walrus drums And
Passuk held my hand and walked by my side When I laid down to sleep
she waked me When I stumbled and fell she raised me When I wandered
in the deep snow she led me back to the trail And in this wise like a
man bereft of reason who sees strange visions and whose thoughts are
light with wine I came to Haines Mission by the sea

Sitka Charley threw back the tentflaps It was midday To the south
just clearing the bleak Henderson Divide poised the colddisked sun On
either hand the sundogs blazed The air was a gossamer of glittering
frost In the foreground beside the trail a wolfdog bristling with
frost thrust a long snout heavenward and mourned




WHERE THE TRAIL FORKS


 Must I then must I then now leave this town
 And you my love stay here_Schwabian Folksong_

The singer cleanfaced and cheeryeyed bent over and added water to a
pot of simmering beans and then rising a stick of firewood in hand
drove back the circling dogs from the grubbox and cookinggear He was
blue of eye and his long hair was golden and it was a pleasure to look
upon his lusty freshness A new moon was thrusting a dim horn above the
white line of closepacked snowcapped pines which ringed the camp and
segregated it from all the world Overhead so clear it was and cold
the stars danced with quick pulsating movements To the southeast an
evanescent greenish glow heralded the opening revels of the aurora
borealis Two men in the immediate foreground lay upon the bearskin
which was their bed Between the skin and naked snow was a sixinch
layer of pine boughs The blankets were rolled back For shelter there
was a fly at their backsa sheet of canvas stretched between two trees
and angling at fortyfive degrees This caught the radiating heat from
the fire and flung it down upon the skin Another man sat on a sled
drawn close to the blaze mending moccasins To the right a heap of
frozen gravel and a rude windlass denoted where they toiled each day in
dismal groping for the paystreak To the left four pairs of snowshoes
stood erect showing the mode of travel which obtained when the stamped
snow of the camp was left behind

That Schwabian folksong sounded strangely pathetic under the cold
northern stars and did not do the men good who lounged about the fire
after the toil of the day It put a dull ache into their hearts and a
yearning which was akin to bellyhunger and sent their souls questing
southward across the divides to the sunlands

For the love of God Sigmund shut up expostulated one of the men His
hands were clenched painfully but he hid them from sight in the folds of
the bearskin upon which he lay

And what for Dave Wertz Sigmund demanded Why shall I not sing when
the heart is glad

Because youve got no call to thats why Look about you man and
think of the grub weve been defiling our bodies with for the last
twelvemonth and the way weve lived and worked like beasts

Thus abjured Sigmund the goldenhaired surveyed it all and the frost
rimmed wolfdogs and the vapor breaths of the men And why shall not
the heart be glad he laughed It is good it is all good As for the
grub He doubled up his arm and caressed the swelling biceps And if
we have lived and worked like beasts have we not been paid like kings
Twenty dollars to the pan the streak is running and we know it to be
eight feet thick It is another Klondikeand we know itJim Hawes
there by your elbow knows it and complains not And theres Hitchcock
He sews moccasins like an old woman and waits against the time Only
you cant wait and work until the washup in the spring Then we shall
all be rich rich as kings only you cannot wait You want to go back to
the States So do I and I was born there but I can wait when each day
the gold in the pan shows up yellow as butter in the churning But you
want your good time and like a child you cry for it now Bah Why
shall I not sing

 In a year in a year when the grapes are ripe
 I shall stay no more away
 Then if you still are true my love
 It will be our wedding day
 In a year in a year when my time is past
 Then Ill live in your love for aye
 Then if you still are true my love
 It will be our wedding day

The dogs bristling and growling drew in closer to the firelight There
was a monotonous crunchcrunch of webbed shoes and between each crunch
the dragging forward of the heel of the shoe like the sound of sifting
sugar Sigmund broke off from his song to hurl oaths and firewood at the
animals Then the light was parted by a furclad figure and an Indian
girl slipped out of the webs threw back the hood of her squirrelskin
_parka_ and stood in their midst Sigmund and the men on the bearskin
greeted her as Sipsu with the customary Hello but Hitchcock made
room on the sled that she might sit beside him

And how goes it Sipsu he asked talking after her fashion in broken
English and bastard Chinook Is the hunger still mighty in the camp
and has the witch doctor yet found the cause wherefore game is scarce and
no moose in the land

Yes even so There is little game and we prepare to eat the dogs
Also has the witch doctor found the cause of all this evil and tomorrow
will he make sacrifice and cleanse the camp

And what does the sacrifice chance to bea newborn babe or some poor
devil of a squaw old and shaky who is a care to the tribe and better
out of the way

It chanced not that wise for the need was great and he chose none
other than the chiefs daughter none other than I Sipsu

Hell The word rose slowly to Hitchcocks lips and brimmed over full
and deep in a way which bespoke wonder and consideration

Wherefore we stand by a forking of the trail you and I she went on
calmly and I have come that we may look once more upon each other and
once more only

She was born of primitive stock and primitive had been her traditions
and her days so she regarded life stoically and human sacrifice as part
of the natural order The powers which ruled the daylight and the dark
the flood and the frost the bursting of the bud and the withering of the
leaf were angry and in need of propitiation This they exacted in many
waysdeath in the bad water through the treacherous icecrust by the
grip of the grizzly or a wasting sickness which fell upon a man in his
own lodge till he coughed and the life of his lungs went out through his
mouth and nostrils Likewise did the powers receive sacrifice It was
all one And the witch doctor was versed in the thoughts of the powers
and chose unerringly It was very natural Death came by many ways yet
was it all one after alla manifestation of the allpowerful and
inscrutable

But Hitchcock came of a later worldbreed His traditions were less
concrete and without reverence and he said Not so Sipsu You are
young and yet in the full joy of life The witch doctor is a fool and
his choice is evil This thing shall not be

She smiled and answered Life is not kind and for many reasons First
it made of us twain the one white and the other red which is bad Then
it crossed our trails and now it parts them again and we can do
nothing Once before when the gods were angry did your brothers come
to the camp They were three big men and white and they said the thing
shall not be But they died quickly and the thing was

Hitchcock nodded that he heard halfturned and lifted his voice Look
here you fellows Theres a lot of foolery going on over to the camp
and theyre getting ready to murder Sipsu What dye say

Wertz looked at Hawes and Hawes looked back but neither spoke Sigmund
dropped his head and petted the shepherd dog between his knees He had
brought Shep in with him from the outside and thought a great deal of
the animal In fact a certain girl who was much in his thoughts and
whose picture in the little locket on his breast often inspired him to
sing had given him the dog and her blessing when they kissed goodby and
he started on his Northland quest

What dye say Hitchcock repeated

Mebbe its not so serious Hawes answered with deliberation Most
likely its only a girls story

That isnt the point Hitchcock felt a hot flush of anger sweep over
him at their evident reluctance The question is if it is so are we
going to stand it What are we going to do

I dont see any call to interfere spoke up Wertz If it is so it is
so and thats all there is about it Its a way these people have of
doing Its their religion and its no concern of ours Our concern is
to get the dust and then get out of this Godforsaken land T isnt fit
for naught else but beasts And what are these black devils but beasts
Besides itd be damn poor policy

Thats what I say chimed in Hawes Here we are four of us three
hundred miles from the Yukon or a white face And what can we do against
halfahundred Indians If we quarrel with them we have to vamose if
we fight we are wiped out Further weve struck pay and by God I
for one am going to stick by it

Ditto here supplemented Wertz

Hitchcock turned impatiently to Sigmund who was softly singing

 In a year in a year when the grapes are ripe
 I shall stay no more away

Well its this way Hitchcock he finally said Im in the same boat
with the rest If threescore bucks have made up their mind to kill the
girl why we cant help it One rush and wed be wiped off the
landscape And what goodd that be Theyd still have the girl Theres
no use in going against the customs of a people except youre in force

But we are in force Hitchcock broke in Four whites are a match for
a hundred times as many reds And think of the girl

Sigmund stroked the dog meditatively But I do think of the girl And
her eyes are blue like summer skies and laughing like summer seas and
her hair is yellow like mine and braided in ropes the size of a big
mans arms Shes waiting for me out there in a better land And
shes waited long and now my piles in sight Im not going to throw it
away

And shamed I would be to look into the girls blue eyes and remember the
black ones of the girl whose blood was on my hands Hitchcock sneered
for he was born to honor and championship and to do the thing for the
things sake nor stop to weigh or measure

Sigmund shook his head You cant make me mad Hitchcock nor do mad
things because of your madness Its a cold business proposition and a
question of facts I didnt come to this country for my health and
further its impossible for us to raise a hand If it is so it is too
bad for the girl thats all Its a way of her people and it just
happens were on the spot this one time Theyve done the same for a
thousandthousand years and theyre going to do it now and theyll go
on doing it for all time to come Besides theyre not our kind Nors
the girl No I take my stand with Wertz and Hawes and

But the dogs snarled and drew in and he broke off listening to the
crunchcrunch of many snowshoes Indian after Indian stalked into the
firelight tall and grim furclad and silent their shadows dancing
grotesquely on the snow One the witch doctor spoke gutturally to
Sipsu His face was daubed with savage paint blotches and over his
shoulders was drawn a wolfskin the gleaming teeth and cruel snout
surmounting his head No other word was spoken The prospectors held
the peace Sipsu arose and slipped into her snowshoes

Goodby O my man she said to Hitchcock But the man who had sat
beside her on the sled gave no sign nor lifted his head as they filed
away into the white forest

Unlike many men his faculty of adaptation while large had never
suggested the expediency of an alliance with the women of the Northland
His broad cosmopolitanism had never impelled toward covenanting in
marriage with the daughters of the soil If it had his philosophy of
life would not have stood between But it simply had not Sipsu He
had pleasured in campfire chats with her not as a man who knew himself
to be man and she woman but as a man might with a child and as a man of
his make certainly would if for no other reason than to vary the tedium
of a bleak existence That was all But there was a certain chivalric
thrill of warm blood in him despite his Yankee ancestry and New England
upbringing and he was so made that the commercial aspect of life often
seemed meaningless and bore contradiction to his deeper impulses

So he sat silent with head bowed forward an organic force greater than
himself as great as his race at work within him Wertz and Hawes
looked askance at him from time to time a faint but perceptible
trepidation in their manner Sigmund also felt this Hitchcock was
strong and his strength had been impressed upon them in the course of
many an event in their precarious life So they stood in a certain
definite awe and curiosity as to what his conduct would be when he moved
to action

But his silence was long and the fire nigh out when Wertz stretched his
arms and yawned and thought hed go to bed Then Hitchcock stood up his
full height

May God damn your souls to the deepest hells you chickenhearted
cowards Im done with you He said it calmly enough but his strength
spoke in every syllable and every intonation was advertisement of
intention Come on he continued whack up and in whatever way suits
you best I own a quarterinterest in the claims our contracts show
that Therere twentyfive or thirty ounces in the sack from the test
pans Fetch out the scales Well divide that now And you Sigmund
measure me my quartershare of the grub and set it apart Four of the
dogs are mine and I want four more Ill trade you my share in the camp
outfit and mininggear for the dogs And Ill throw in my six or seven
ounces and the spare 4590 with the ammunition What dye say

The three men drew apart and conferred When they returned Sigmund
acted as spokesman Well whack up fair with you Hitchcock In
everything youll get your quartershare neither more nor less and you
can take it or leave it But we want the dogs as bad as you do so you
get four and thats all If you dont want to take your share of the
outfit and gear why thats your lookout If you want it you can have
it if you dont leave it

The letter of the law Hitchcock sneered But go ahead Im willing
And hurry up I cant get out of this camp and away from its vermin any
too quick

The division was effected without further comment He lashed his meagre
belongings upon one of the sleds rounded in his four dogs and harnessed
up His portion of outfit and gear he did not touch though he threw
onto the sled half a dozen dog harnesses and challenged them with his
eyes to interfere But they shrugged their shoulders and watched him
disappear in the forest

    

A man crawled upon his belly through the snow On every hand loomed the
moosehide lodges of the camp Here and there a miserable dog howled or
snarled abuse upon his neighbor Once one of them approached the
creeping man but the man became motionless The dog came closer and
sniffed and came yet closer till its nose touched the strange object
which had not been there when darkness fell Then Hitchcock for it was
Hitchcock upreared suddenly shooting an unmittened hand out to the
brutes shaggy throat And the dog knew its death in that clutch and
when the man moved on was left brokennecked under the stars In this
manner Hitchcock made the chiefs lodge For long he lay in the snow
without listening to the voices of the occupants and striving to locate
Sipsu Evidently there were many in the tent and from the sounds they
were in high excitement At last he heard the girls voice and crawled
around so that only the moosehide divided them Then burrowing in the
snow he slowly wormed his head and shoulders underneath When the warm
inner air smote his face he stopped and waited his legs and the greater
part of his body still on the outside He could see nothing nor did he
dare lift his head On one side of him was a skin bale He could smell
it though he carefully felt to be certain On the other side his face
barely touched a furry garment which he knew clothed a body This must
be Sipsu Though he wished she would speak again he resolved to risk
it

He could hear the chief and the witch doctor talking high and in a far
corner some hungry child whimpering to sleep Squirming over on his
side he carefully raised his head still just touching the furry
garment He listened to the breathing It was a womans breathing he
would chance it

He pressed against her side softly but firmly and felt her start at the
contact Again he waited till a questioning hand slipped down upon his
head and paused among the curls The next instant the hand turned his
face gently upward and he was gazing into Sipsus eyes

She was quite collected Changing her position casually she threw an
elbow well over on the skin bale rested her body upon it and arranged
her _parka_ In this way he was completely concealed Then and still
most casually she reclined across him so that he could breathe between
her arm and breast and when she lowered her head her ear pressed lightly
against his lips

When the time suits go thou he whispered out of the lodge and
across the snow down the wind to the bunch of jackpine in the curve of
the creek There wilt thou find my dogs and my sled packed for the
trail This night we go down to the Yukon and since we go fast lay
thou hands upon what dogs come nigh thee by the scruff of the neck and
drag them to the sled in the curve of the creek

Sipsu shook her head in dissent but her eyes glistened with gladness
and she was proud that this man had shown toward her such favor But
she like the women of all her race was born to obey the will masculine
and when Hitchcock repeated Go he did it with authority and though
she made no answer he knew that his will was law

And never mind harness for the dogs he added preparing to go I
shall wait But waste no time The day chaseth the night alway nor
does it linger for mans pleasure

Half an hour later stamping his feet and swinging his arms by the sled
he saw her coming a surly dog in either hand At the approach of these
his own animals waxed truculent and he favored them with the butt of his
whip till they quieted He had approached the camp up the wind and
sound was the thing to be most feared in making his presence known

Put them into the sled he ordered when she had got the harness on the
two dogs I want my leaders to the fore

But when she had done this the displaced animals pitched upon the
aliens Though Hitchcock plunged among them with clubbed rifle a riot
of sound went up and across the sleeping camp

Now we shall have dogs and in plenty he remarked grimly slipping an
axe from the sled lashings Do thou harness whichever I fling thee and
betweenwhiles protect the team

He stepped a space in advance and waited between two pines The dogs of
the camp were disturbing the night with their jangle and he watched for
their coming A dark spot growing rapidly took form upon the dim white
expanse of snow It was a forerunner of the pack leaping cleanly and
after the wolf fashion singing direction to its brothers Hitchcock
stood in the shadow As it sprang past he reached out gripped its
forelegs in midcareer and sent it whirling earthward Then he struck
it a welljudged blow beneath the ear and flung it to Sipsu And while
she clapped on the harness he with his axe held the passage between
the trees till a shaggy flood of white teeth and glistening eyes surged
and crested just beyond reach Sipsu worked rapidly When she had
finished he leaped forward seized and stunned a second and flung it to
her This he repeated thrice again and when the sled team stood
snarling in a string of ten he called Enough

But at this instant a young buck the forerunner of the tribe and swift
of limb wading through the dogs and cuffing right and left attempted
the passage The butt of Hitchcocks rifle drove him to his knees
whence he toppled over sideways The witch doctor running lustily saw
the blow fall

Hitchcock called to Sipsu to pull out At her shrill Chook the
maddened brutes shot straight ahead and the sled bounding mightily
just missed unseating her The powers were evidently angry with the
witch doctor for at this moment they plunged him upon the trail The
leaddog fouled his snowshoes and tripped him up and the nine succeeding
dogs trod him under foot and the sled bumped over him But he was quick
to his feet and the night might have turned out differently had not
Sipsu struck backward with the long dogwhip and smitten him a blinding
blow across the eyes Hitchcock hurrying to overtake her collided
against him as he swayed with pain in the middle of the trail Thus it
was when this primitive theologian got back to the chiefs lodge that
his wisdom had been increased in so far as concerns the efficacy of the
white mans fist So when he orated then and there in the council he
was wroth against all white men

    

Tumble out you loafers Tumble out Grubll be ready before you get
into your footgear

Dave Wertz threw off the bearskin sat up and yawned

Hawes stretched discovered a lame muscle in his arm and rubbed it
sleepily Wonder where Hitchcock bunked last night he queried
reaching for his moccasins They were stiff and he walked gingerly in
his socks to the fire to thaw them out Its a blessing hes gone he
added though he was a mighty good worker

Yep Too masterful That was his trouble Too bad for Sipsu Think
he cared for her much

Dont think so Just principle Thats all He thought it wasnt
rightand of course it wasntbut that was no reason for us to
interfere and get hustled over the divide before our time

Principle is principle and its good in its place but its best left
to home when you go to Alaska Eh Wertz had joined his mate and both
were working pliability into their frozen moccasins Think we ought to
have taken a hand

Sigmund shook his head He was very busy A scud of chocolatecolored
foam was rising in the coffeepot and the bacon needed turning Also
he was thinking about the girl with laughing eyes like summer seas and
he was humming softly

His mates chuckled to each other and ceased talking Though it was past
seven daybreak was still three hours distant The aurora borealis had
passed out of the sky and the camp was an oasis of light in the midst of
deep darkness And in this light the forms of the three men were sharply
defined Emboldened by the silence Sigmund raised his voice and opened
the last stanza of the old song

 In a year in a year when the grapes are ripe

Then the night was split with a rattling volley of rifleshots Hawes
sighed made an effort to straighten himself and collapsed Wertz went
over on an elbow with drooping head He choked a little and a dark
stream flowed from his mouth And Sigmund the GoldenHaired his throat
agurgle with the song threw up his arms and pitched across the fire

    

The witch doctors eyes were well blackened and his temper none of the
best for he quarrelled with the chief over the possession of Wertzs
rifle and took more than his share of the partsack of beans Also he
appropriated the bearskin and caused grumbling among the tribesmen And
finally he tried to kill Sigmunds dog which the girl had given him
but the dog ran away while he fell into the shaft and dislocated his
shoulder on the bucket When the camp was well looted they went back to
their own lodges and there was a great rejoicing among the women
Further a band of moose strayed over the south divide and fell before
the hunters so the witch doctor attained yet greater honor and the
people whispered among themselves that he spoke in council with the gods

But later when all were gone the shepherd dog crept back to the
deserted camp and all the night long and a day it wailed the dead After
that it disappeared though the years were not many before the Indian
hunters noted a change in the breed of timber wolves and there were
dashes of bright color and variegated markings such as no wolf bore
before




A DAUGHTER OF THE AURORA


Youwhat you calllazy mans you lazy mans would desire me to haf for
wife It is not good Nevaire no nevaire will lazy mans my hoosband
be

Thus Joy Molineau spoke her mind to Jack Harrington even as she had
spoken it but more tritely and in his own tongue to Louis Savoy the
previous night

Listen Joy

No no why moos I listen to lazy mans It is vaire bad you hang
rount make visitation to my cabin and do nothing How you get grub for
the famine Why haf not you the dust Odder mans haf plentee

But I work hard Joy Never a day am I not on trail or up creek Even
now have I just come off My dogs are yet tired Other men have luck
and find plenty of gold but II have no luck

Ah But when this mans with the wife which is Indian this mans
McCormack when him discovaire the Klondike you go not Odder mans go
odder mans now rich

You know I was prospecting over on the headreaches of the Tanana
Harrington protested and knew nothing of the Eldorado or Bonanza until
it was too late

That is deeferent only you arewhat you call way off

What

Way off In theyesin the dark It is nevaire too late One vaire
rich mine is there on the creek which is Eldorado The mans drive the
stake and him go way No odddr mans know what of him become The mans
him which drive the stake is nevaire no more Sixty days no mans on
that claim file the papaire Then odder mans plentee odder manswhat
you calljump that claim Then they race O so queek like the wind to
file the papaire Him be vaire rich Him get grub for famine

Harrington hid the major portion of his interest

Whens the time up he asked What claim is it

So I speak Louis Savoy last night she continued ignoring him Him I
think the winnaire

Hang Louis Savoy

So Louis Savoy speak in my cabin last night Him say Joy I am strong
mans I haf good dogs I haf long wind I will be winnaire Then you
will haf me for hoosband And I say to him I say

Whatd you say

I say If Louis Savoy is winnaire then will he haf me for wife

And if he dont win

Then Louis Savoy him will not bewhat you callthe father of my
children

And if I win

You winnaire Ha ha Nevaire

Exasperating as it was Joy Molineaus laughter was pretty to hear
Harrington did not mind it He had long since been broken in Besides
he was no exception She had forced all her lovers to suffer in kind
And very enticing she was just then her lips parted her color
heightened by the sharp kiss of the frost her eyes vibrant with the lure
which is the greatest of all lures and which may be seen nowhere save in
womans eyes Her sleddogs clustered about her in hirsute masses and
the leader Wolf Fang laid his long snout softly in her lap

If I do win Harrington pressed

She looked from dog to lover and back again

What you say Wolf Fang If him strong mans and file the papaire shall
we his wife become Eh What you say

Wolf Fang picked up his ears and growled at Harrington

It is vaire cold she suddenly added with feminine irrelevance rising
to her feet and straightening out the team

Her lover looked on stolidly She had kept him guessing from the first
time they met and patience had been joined unto his virtues

Hi Wolf Fang she cried springing upon the sled as it leaped into
sudden motion Ai Ya Mushon

From the corner of his eye Harrington watched her swinging down the trail
to Forty Mile Where the road forked and crossed the river to Fort
Cudahy she halted the dogs and turned about

O Mistaire Lazy Mans she called back Wolf Fang him say yesif you
winnaire

    

But somehow as such things will it leaked out and all Forty Mile
which had hitherto speculated on Joy Molineaus choice between her two
latest lovers now hazarded bets and guesses as to which would win in the
forthcoming race The camp divided itself into two factions and every
effort was put forth in order that their respective favorites might be
the first in at the finish There was a scramble for the best dogs the
country could afford for dogs and good ones were essential above all
to success And it meant much to the victor Besides the possession of
a wife the like of which had yet to be created it stood for a mine
worth a million at least

That fall when news came down of McCormacks discovery on Bonanza all
the Lower Country Circle City and Forty Mile included had stampeded up
the Yukonat least all save those who like Jack Harrington and Louis
Savoy were away prospecting in the west Moose pastures and creeks were
staked indiscriminately and promiscuously and incidentally one of the
unlikeliest of creeks Eldorado Olaf Nelson laid claim to five hundred
of its linear feet duly posted his notice and as duly disappeared At
that time the nearest recording office was in the police barracks at Fort
Cudahy just across the river from Forty Mile but when it became bruited
abroad that Eldorado Creek was a treasurehouse it was quickly
discovered that Olaf Nelson had failed to make the downYukon trip to
file upon his property Men cast hungry eyes upon the ownerless claim
where they knew a thousandthousand dollars waited but shovel and sluice
box Yet they dared not touch it for there was a law which permitted
sixty days to lapse between the staking and the filing during which time
a claim was immune The whole country knew of Olaf Nelsons
disappearance and scores of men made preparation for the jumping and for
the consequent race to Fort Cudahy

But competition at Forty Mile was limited With the camp devoting its
energies to the equipping either of Jack Harrington or Louis Savoy no
man was unwise enough to enter the contest singlehanded It was a
stretch of a hundred miles to the Recorders office and it was planned
that the two favorites should have four relays of dogs stationed along
the trail Naturally the last relay was to be the crucial one and for
these twentyfive miles their respective partisans strove to obtain the
strongest possible animals So bitter did the factions wax and so high
did they bid that dogs brought stiffer prices than ever before in the
annals of the country And as it chanced this scramble for dogs turned
the public eye still more searchingly upon Joy Molineau Not only was
she the cause of it all but she possessed the finest sleddog from
Chilkoot to Bering Sea As wheel or leader Wolf Fang had no equal The
man whose sled he led down the last stretch was bound to win There
could be no doubt of it But the community had an innate sense of the
fitness of things and not once was Joy vexed by overtures for his use
And the factions drew consolation from the fact that if one man did not
profit by him neither should the other

However since man in the individual or in the aggregate has been so
fashioned that he goes through life blissfully obtuse to the deeper
subtleties of his womankind so the men of Forty Mile failed to divine
the inner deviltry of Joy Molineau They confessed afterward that they
had failed to appreciate this darkeyed daughter of the aurora whose
father had traded furs in the country before ever they dreamed of
invading it and who had herself first opened eyes on the scintillant
northern lights Nay accident of birth had not rendered her less the
woman nor had it limited her womans understanding of men They knew
she played with them but they did not know the wisdom of her play its
deepness and its deftness They failed to see more than the exposed
card so that to the very last Forty Mile was in a state of pleasant
obfuscation and it was not until she cast her final trump that it came
to reckon up the score

Early in the week the camp turned out to start Jack Harrington and Louis
Savoy on their way They had taken a shrewd margin of time for it was
their wish to arrive at Olaf Nelsons claim some days previous to the
expiration of its immunity that they might rest themselves and their
dogs be fresh for the first relay On the way up they found the men of
Dawson already stationing spare dog teams along the trail and it was
manifest that little expense had been spared in view of the millions at
stake

A couple of days after the departure of their champions Forty Mile began
sending up their relaysfirst to the seventyfive station then to the
fifty and last to the twentyfive The teams for the last stretch were
magnificent and so equally matched that the camp discussed their
relative merits for a full hour at fifty below before they were
permitted to pull out At the last moment Joy Molineau dashed in among
them on her sled She drew Lon McFane who had charge of Harringtons
team to one side and hardly had the first words left her lips when it
was noticed that his lower jaw dropped with a celerity and emphasis
suggestive of great things He unhitched Wolf Fang from her sled put
him at the head of Harringtons team and mushed the string of animals
into the Yukon trail

Poor Louis Savoy men said but Joy Molineau flashed her black eyes
defiantly and drove back to her fathers cabin

    

Midnight drew near on Olaf Nelsons claim A few hundred furclad men
had preferred sixty below and the jumping to the inducements of warm
cabins and comfortable bunks Several score of them had their notices
prepared for posting and their dogs at hand A bunch of Captain
Constantines mounted police had been ordered on duty that fair play
might rule The command had gone forth that no man should place a stake
till the last second of the day had ticked itself into the past In the
northland such commands are equal to Jehovahs in the matter of potency
the dumdum as rapid and effective as the thunderbolt It was clear and
cold The aurora borealis painted palpitating color revels on the sky
Rosy waves of cold brilliancy swept across the zenith while great
coruscating bars of greenish white blotted out the stars or a Titans
hand reared mighty arches above the Pole And at this mighty display the
wolfdogs howled as had their ancestors of old time

A bearskincoated policeman stepped prominently to the fore watch in
hand Men hurried among the dogs rousing them to their feet untangling
their traces straightening them out The entries came to the mark
firmly gripping stakes and notices They had gone over the boundaries of
the claim so often that they could now have done it blindfolded The
policeman raised his hand Casting off their superfluous furs and
blankets and with a final cinching of belts they came to attention

Time

Sixty pairs of hands unmitted as many pairs of moccasins gripped hard
upon the snow

Go

They shot across the wide expanse round the four sides sticking notices
at every corner and down the middle where the two centre stakes were to
be planted Then they sprang for the sleds on the frozen bed of the
creek An anarchy of sound and motion broke out Sled collided with
sled and dogteam fastened upon dogteam with bristling manes and
screaming fangs The narrow creek was glutted with the struggling mass
Lashes and butts of dogwhips were distributed impartially among men and
brutes And to make it of greater moment each participant had a bunch
of comrades intent on breaking him out of jam But one by one and by
sheer strength the sleds crept out and shot from sight in the darkness
of the overhanging banks

Jack Harrington had anticipated this crush and waited by his sled until
it untangled Louis Savoy aware of his rivals greater wisdom in the
matter of dogdriving had followed his lead and also waited The rout
had passed beyond earshot when they took the trail and it was not till
they had travelled the ten miles or so down to Bonanza that they came
upon it speeding along in single file but well bunched There was
little noise and less chance of one passing another at that stage The
sleds from runner to runner measured sixteen inches the trail
eighteen but the trail packed down fully a foot by the traffic was
like a gutter On either side spread the blanket of soft snow crystals
If a man turned into this in an endeavor to pass his dogs would wallow
perforce to their bellies and slow down to a snails pace So the men
lay close to their leaping sleds and waited No alteration in position
occurred down the fifteen miles of Bonanza and Klondike to Dawson where
the Yukon was encountered Here the first relays waited But here
intent to kill their first teams if necessary Harrington and Savoy had
had their fresh teams placed a couple of miles beyond those of the
others In the confusion of changing sleds they passed full half the
bunch Perhaps thirty men were still leading them when they shot on to
the broad breast of the Yukon Here was the tug When the river froze
in the fall a mile of open water had been left between two mighty jams
This had but recently crusted the current being swift and now it was as
level hard and slippery as a dance floor The instant they struck this
glare ice Harrington came to his knees holding precariously on with one
hand his whip singing fiercely among his dogs and fearsome abjurations
hurtling about their ears The teams spread out on the smooth surface
each straining to the uttermost But few men in the North could lift
their dogs as did Jack Harrington At once he began to pull ahead and
Louis Savoy taking the pace hung on desperately his leaders running
even with the tail of his rivals sled

Midway on the glassy stretch their relays shot out from the bank But
Harrington did not slacken Watching his chance when the new sled swung
in close he leaped across shouting as he did so and jumping up the pace
of his fresh dogs The other driver fell off somehow Savoy did
likewise with his relay and the abandoned teams swerving to right and
left collided with the others and piled the ice with confusion
Harrington cut out the pace Savoy hung on As they neared the end of
the glare ice they swept abreast of the leading sled When they shot
into the narrow trail between the soft snowbanks they led the race and
Dawson watching by the light of the aurora swore that it was neatly
done

When the frost grows lusty at sixty below men cannot long remain without
fire or excessive exercise and live So Harrington and Savoy now fell
to the ancient custom of ride and run Leaping from their sleds tow
thongs in hand they ran behind till the blood resumed its wonted
channels and expelled the frost then back to the sleds till the heat
again ebbed away Thus riding and running they covered the second and
third relays Several times on smooth ice Savoy spurted his dogs and
as often failed to gain past Strung along for five miles in the rear
the remainder of the race strove to overtake them but vainly for to
Louis Savoy alone was the glory given of keeping Jack Harringtons
killing pace

As they swung into the seventyfivemile station Lon McFane dashed
alongside Wolf Fang in the lead caught Harringtons eye and he knew
that the race was his No team in the North could pass him on those last
twentyfive miles And when Savoy saw Wolf Fang heading his rivals
team he knew that he was out of the running and he cursed softly to
himself in the way woman is most frequently cursed But he still clung
to the others smoking trail gambling on chance to the last And as
they churned along the day breaking in the southeast they marvelled in
joy and sorrow at that which Joy Molineau had done

    

Forty Mile had early crawled out of its sleeping furs and congregated
near the edge of the trail From this point it could view the upYukon
course to its first bend several miles away Here it could also see
across the river to the finish at Fort Cudahy where the Gold Recorder
nervously awaited Joy Molineau had taken her position several rods back
from the trail and under the circumstances the rest of Forty Mile
forbore interposing itself So the space was clear between her and the
slender line of the course Fires had been built and around these men
wagered dust and dogs the long odds on Wolf Fang

Here they come shrilled an Indian boy from the top of a pine

Up the Yukon a black speck appeared against the snow closely followed by
a second As these grew larger more black specks manifested themselves
but at a goodly distance to the rear Gradually they resolved themselves
into dogs and sleds and men lying flat upon them Wolf Fang leads a
lieutenant of police whispered to Joy She smiled her interest back

Ten to one on Harrington cried a Birch Creek King dragging out his
sack

The Queen her pay you not mooch queried Joy

The lieutenant shook his head

You have some dust ah how mooch she continued

He exposed his sack She gauged it with a rapid eye

Mebbesaytwo hundred eh Good Now I givewhat you callthe tip
Covaire the bet Joy smiled inscrutably The lieutenant pondered He
glanced up the trail The two men had risen to their knees and were
lashing their dogs furiously Harrington in the lead

Ten to one on Harrington bawled the Birch Creek King flourishing his
sack in the lieutenants face

Covaire the bet Joy prompted

He obeyed shrugging his shoulders in token that he yielded not to the
dictate of his reason but to her charm Joy nodded to reassure him

All noise ceased Men paused in the placing of bets

Yawing and reeling and plunging like luggers before the wind the sleds
swept wildly upon them Though he still kept his leader up to the tail
of Harringtons sled Louis Savoys face was without hope Harringtons
mouth was set He looked neither to the right nor to the left His dogs
were leaping in perfect rhythm firmfooted close to the trail and Wolf
Fang head low and unseeing whining softly was leading his comrades
magnificently

Forty Mile stood breathless Not a sound save the roar of the runners
and the voice of the whips

Then the clear voice of Joy Molineau rose on the air Ai Ya Wolf
Fang Wolf Fang

Wolf Fang heard He left the trail sharply heading directly for his
mistress The team dashed after him and the sled poised an instant on a
single runner then shot Harrington into the snow Savoy was by like a
flash Harrington pulled to his feet and watched him skimming across the
river to the Gold Recorders He could not help hearing what was said

Ah him do vaire well Joy Molineau was explaining to the lieutenant
Himwhat you callset the pace Yes him set the pace vaire well




AT THE RAINBOWS END


I


It was for two reasons that Montana Kid discarded his chaps and Mexican
spurs and shook the dust of the Idaho ranges from his feet In the
first place the encroachments of a steady sober and sternly moral
civilization had destroyed the primeval status of the western cattle
ranges and refined society turned the cold eye of disfavor upon him and
his ilk In the second place in one of its cyclopean moments the race
had arisen and shoved back its frontier several thousand miles Thus
with unconscious foresight did mature society make room for its
adolescent members True the new territory was mostly barren but its
several hundred thousand square miles of frigidity at least gave
breathing space to those who else would have suffocated at home

Montana Kid was such a one Heading for the seacoast with a haste
several sheriffs posses might possibly have explained and with more
nerve than coin of the realm he succeeded in shipping from a Puget Sound
port and managed to survive the contingent miseries of steerage
seasickness and steerage grub He was rather sallow and drawn but
still his own indomitable self when he landed on the Dyea beach one day
in the spring of the year Between the cost of dogs grub and outfits
and the customs exactions of the two clashing governments it speedily
penetrated to his understanding that the Northland was anything save a
poor mans Mecca So he cast about him in search of quick harvests
Between the beach and the passes were scattered many thousands of
passionate pilgrims These pilgrims Montana Kid proceeded to farm At
first he dealt faro in a pineboard gambling shack but disagreeable
necessity forced him to drop a sudden period into a mans life and to
move on up trail Then he effected a corner in horseshoe nails and they
circulated at par with legal tender four to the dollar till an
unexpected consignment of a hundred barrels or so broke the market and
forced him to disgorge his stock at a loss After that he located at
Sheep Camp organized the professional packers and jumped the freight
ten cents a pound in a single day In token of their gratitude the
packers patronized his faro and roulette layouts and were mulcted
cheerfully of their earnings But his commercialism was of too lusty a
growth to be long endured so they rushed him one night burned his
shanty divided the bank and headed him up the trail with empty pockets

Illluck was his running mate He engaged with responsible parties to
run whisky across the line by way of precarious and unknown trails lost
his Indian guides and had the very first outfit confiscated by the
Mounted Police Numerous other misfortunes tended to make him bitter of
heart and wanton of action and he celebrated his arrival at Lake Bennett
by terrorizing the camp for twenty straight hours Then a miners
meeting took him in hand and commanded him to make himself scarce He
had a wholesome respect for such assemblages and he obeyed in such haste
that he inadvertently removed himself at the tailend of another mans
dog team This was equivalent to horsestealing in a more mellow clime
so he hit only the high places across Bennett and down Tagish and made
his first camp a full hundred miles to the north

Now it happened that the break of spring was at hand and many of the
principal citizens of Dawson were travelling south on the last ice These
he met and talked with noted their names and possessions and passed on
He had a good memory also a fair imagination nor was veracity one of
his virtues

Dawson always eager for news beheld Montana Kids sled heading down the
Yukon and went out on the ice to meet him No he hadnt any
newspapers didnt know whether Durrant was hanged yet nor who had won
the Thanksgiving game hadnt heard whether the United States and Spain
had gone to fighting didnt know who Dreyfus was but OBrien Hadnt
they heard OBrien why he was drowned in the White Horse Sitka
Charley the only one of the party who escaped Joe Ladue Both legs
frozen and amputated at the Five Fingers And Jack Dalton Blown up on
the Sea Lion with all hands And Bettles Wrecked on the
Carthagina in Seymour Narrowstwenty survivors out of three hundred
And Swiftwater Bill Gone through the rotten ice of Lake LeBarge with
six female members of the opera troupe he was convoying Governor Walsh
Lost with all hands and eight sleds on the Thirty Mile Devereaux Who
was Devereaux Oh the courier Shot by Indians on Lake Marsh

So it went The word was passed along Men shouldered in to ask after
friends and partners and in turn were shouldered out too stunned for
blasphemy By the time Montana Kid gained the bank he was surrounded by
several hundred furclad miners When he passed the Barracks he was the
centre of a procession At the Opera House he was the nucleus of an
excited mob each member struggling for a chance to ask after some absent
comrade On every side he was being invited to drink Never before had
the Klondike thus opened its arms to a chechaqua All Dawson was
humming Such a series of catastrophes had never occurred in its
history Every man of note who had gone south in the spring had been
wiped out The cabins vomited forth their occupants Wildeyed men
hurried down from the creeks and gulches to seek out this man who had
told a tale of such disaster The Russian halfbreed wife of Bettles
sought the fireplace inconsolable and rocked back and forth and ever
and anon flung white woodashes upon her raven hair The flag at the
Barracks flopped dismally at halfmast Dawson mourned its dead

Why Montana Kid did this thing no man may know Nor beyond the fact that
the truth was not in him can explanation be hazarded But for five
whole days he plunged the land in wailing and sorrow and for five whole
days he was the only man in the Klondike The country gave him its best
of bed and board The saloons granted him the freedom of their bars Men
sought him continuously The high officials bowed down to him for
further information and he was feasted at the Barracks by Constantine
and his brother officers And then one day Devereaux the government
courier halted his tired dogs before the gold commissioners office
Dead Who said so Give him a moose steak and hed show them how dead
he was Why Governor Walsh was in camp on the Little Salmon and
OBrien coming in on the first water Dead Give him a moose steak and
hed show them

And forthwith Dawson hummed The Barracks flag rose to the masthead
and Bettles wife washed herself and put on clean raiment The community
subtly signified its desire that Montana Kid obliterate himself from the
landscape And Montana Kid obliterated as usual at the tailend of
some one elses dog team Dawson rejoiced when he headed down the Yukon
and wished him godspeed to the ultimate destination of the casehardened
sinner After that the owner of the dogs bestirred himself made
complaint to Constantine and from him received the loan of a policeman

With Circle City in prospect and the last ice crumbling under his
runners Montana Kid took advantage of the lengthening days and travelled
his dogs late and early Further he had but little doubt that the owner
of the dogs in question had taken his trail and he wished to make
American territory before the river broke But by the afternoon of the
third day it became evident that he had lost in his race with spring The
Yukon was growling and straining at its fetters Long detours became
necessary for the trail had begun to fall through into the swift current
beneath while the ice in constant unrest was thundering apart in great
gaping fissures Through these and through countless airholes the water
began to sweep across the surface of the ice and by the time he pulled
into a woodchoppers cabin on the point of an island the dogs were being
rushed off their feet and were swimming more often than not He was
greeted sourly by the two residents but he unharnessed and proceeded to
cook up

Donald and Davy were fair specimens of frontier inefficients Canadian
born citybred Scots in a foolish moment they had resigned their
countinghouse desks drawn upon their savings and gone Klondiking And
now they were feeling the rough edge of the country Grubless
spiritless with a lust for home in their hearts they had been staked by
the P C Company to cut wood for its steamers with the promise at the
end of a passage home Disregarding the possibilities of the icerun
they had fittingly demonstrated their inefficiency by their choice of the
island on which they located Montana Kid though possessing little
knowledge of the breakup of a great river looked about him dubiously
and cast yearning glances at the distant bank where the towering bluffs
promised immunity from all the ice of the Northland

After feeding himself and dogs he lighted his pipe and strolled out to
get a better idea of the situation The island like all its river
brethren stood higher at the upper end and it was here that Donald and
Davy had built their cabin and piled many cords of wood The far shore
was a full mile away while between the island and the near shore lay a
backchannel perhaps a hundred yards across At first sight of this
Montana Kid was tempted to take his dogs and escape to the mainland but
on closer inspection he discovered a rapid current flooding on top
Below the river twisted sharply to the west and in this turn its breast
was studded by a maze of tiny islands

Thats where shell jam he remarked to himself

Half a dozen sleds evidently bound upstream to Dawson were splashing
through the chill water to the tail of the island Travel on the river
was passing from the precarious to the impossible and it was nip and
tuck with them till they gained the island and came up the path of the
woodchoppers toward the cabin One of them snowblind towed
helplessly at the rear of a sled Husky young fellows they were rough
garmented and trailworn yet Montana Kid had met the breed before and
knew at once that it was not his kind

Hello Hows things up Dawsonway queried the foremost passing his
eye over Donald and Davy and settling it upon the Kid

A first meeting in the wilderness is not characterized by formality The
talk quickly became general and the news of the Upper and Lower
Countries was swapped equitably back and forth But the little the
newcomers had was soon over with for they had wintered at Minook a
thousand miles below where nothing was doing Montana Kid however was
fresh from Salt Water and they annexed him while they pitched camp
swamping him with questions concerning the outside from which they had
been cut off for a twelvemonth

A shrieking split suddenly lifting itself above the general uproar on
the river drew everybody to the bank The surface water had increased
in depth and the ice assailed from above and below was struggling to
tear itself from the grip of the shores Fissures reverberated into life
before their eyes and the air was filled with multitudinous crackling
crisp and sharp like the sound that goes up on a clear day from the
firing line

From up the river two men were racing a dog team toward them on an
uncovered stretch of ice But even as they looked the pair struck the
water and began to flounder through Behind where their feet had sped
the moment before the ice broke up and turned turtle Through this
opening the river rushed out upon them to their waists burying the sled
and swinging the dogs off at right angles in a drowning tangle But the
men stopped their flight to give the animals a fighting chance and they
groped hurriedly in the cold confusion slashing at the detaining traces
with their sheathknives Then they fought their way to the bank through
swirling water and grinding ice where foremost in leaping to the rescue
among the jarring fragments was the Kid

Why blime me if it aint Montana Kid exclaimed one of the men whom
the Kid was just placing upon his feet at the top of the bank He wore
the scarlet tunic of the Mounted Police and jocularly raised his right
hand in salute

Got a warrant for you Kid he continued drawing a bedraggled paper
from his breast pocket an I ope as youll come along peaceable

Montana Kid looked at the chaotic river and shrugged his shoulders and
the policeman following his glance smiled

Where are the dogs his companion asked

Gentlemen interrupted the policeman this ere mate o mine is Jack
Sutherland owner of TwentyTwo Eldorado

Not Sutherland of 92 broke in the snowblinded Minook man groping
feebly toward him

The same Sutherland gripped his hand

And you

Oh Im after your time but I remember you in my freshman yearyou
were doing P G work then Boys he called turning half about this
is Sutherland Jack Sutherland erstwhile fullback on the Varsity Come
up you goldchasers and fall upon him Sutherland this is
Greenwichplayed quarter two seasons back

Yes I read of the game Sutherland said shaking hands And I
remember that big run of yours for the first touchdown

Greenwich flushed darkly under his tanned skin and awkwardly made room
for another

And heres MatthewsBerkeley man And weve got some Eastern cracks
knocking about too Come up you Princeton men Come up This is
Sutherland Jack Sutherland

Then they fell upon him heavily carried him into camp and supplied him
with dry clothes and numerous mugs of black tea

Donald and Davy overlooked had retired to their nightly game of crib
Montana Kid followed them with the policeman

Here get into some dry togs he said pulling them from out his scanty
kit Guess youll have to bunk with me too

Well I say youre a good un the policeman remarked as he pulled on
the other mans socks Sorry Ive got to take you back to Dawson but I
only ope they wont be ard on you

Not so fast The Kid smiled curiously We aint under way yet When
I go Im going down river and I guess the chances are youll go along

Not if I know myself

Come on outside and Ill show you then These damn fools thrusting
a thumb over his shoulder at the two Scots played smash when they
located here Fill your pipe firstthis is pretty good plugand enjoy
yourself while you can You havent many smokes before you

The policeman went with him wonderingly while Donald and Davy dropped
their cards and followed The Minook men noticed Montana Kid pointing
now up the river now down and came over

Whats up Sutherland demanded

Nothing much Nonchalance sat well upon the Kid Just a case of
raising hell and putting a chunk under See that bend down there Thats
where shell jam millions of tons of ice Then shell jam in the bends
up above millions of tons Upper jam breaks first lower jam holds
pouf He dramatically swept the island with his hand Millions of
tons he added reflectively

And what of the woodpiles Davy questioned

The Kid repeated his sweeping gestures and Davy wailed The labor of
months It canna be Na na lad it canna be I doot not its a jowk
Ay say that it is he appealed

But when the Kid laughed harshly and turned on his heel Davy flung
himself upon the piles and began frantically to toss the cordwood back
from the bank

Lend a hand Donald he cried Can ye no lend a hand T is the
labor of months and the passage home

Donald caught him by the arm and shook him but he tore free Did ye no
hear man Millions of tons and the island shall be sweepit clean

Straighten yersel up man said Donald Its a bit fashed ye are

But Davy fell upon the cordwood Donald stalked back to the cabin
buckled on his money belt and Davys and went out to the point of the
island where the ground was highest and where a huge pine towered above
its fellows

The men before the cabin heard the ringing of his axe and smiled
Greenwich returned from across the island with the word that they were
penned in It was impossible to cross the backchannel The blind
Minook man began to sing and the rest joined in with

 Wonder if its true
 Does it seem so to you
 Seems to me hes lying
 Oh I wonder if its true

Its ay sinfu Davy moaned lifting his head and watching them dance
in the slanting rays of the sun And my guid wood a going to waste

 Oh I wonder if its true

was flaunted back

The noise of the river ceased suddenly A strange calm wrapped about
them The ice had ripped from the shores and was floating higher on the
surface of the river which was rising Up it came swift and silent
for twenty feet till the huge cakes rubbed softly against the crest of
the bank The tail of the island being lower was overrun Then
without effort the white flood started downstream But the sound
increased with the momentum and soon the whole island was shaking and
quivering with the shock of the grinding bergs Under pressure the
mighty cakes weighing hundreds of tons were shot into the air like
peas The frigid anarchy increased its riot and the men had to shout
into one anothers ears to be heard Occasionally the racket from the
back channel could be heard above the tumult The island shuddered with
the impact of an enormous cake which drove in squarely upon its point It
ripped a score of pines out by the roots then swinging around and over
lifted its muddy base from the bottom of the river and bore down upon the
cabin slicing the bank and trees away like a gigantic knife It seemed
barely to graze the corner of the cabin but the cribbed logs tilted up
like matches and the structure like a toy house fell backward in ruin

The labor of months The labor of months and the passage home Davy
wailed while Montana Kid and the policeman dragged him backward from the
woodpiles

Youll ave plenty o hoppertunity all in good time for yer passage
ome the policeman growled clouting him alongside the head and sending
him flying into safety

Donald from the top of the pine saw the devastating berg sweep away the
cordwood and disappear downstream As though satisfied with this
damage the iceflood quickly dropped to its old level and began to
slacken its pace The noise likewise eased down and the others could
hear Donald shouting from his eyrie to look downstream As forecast
the jam had come among the islands in the bend and the ice was piling up
in a great barrier which stretched from shore to shore The river came
to a standstill and the water finding no outlet began to rise It
rushed up till the island was awash the men splashing around up to their
knees and the dogs swimming to the ruins of the cabin At this stage it
abruptly became stationary with no perceptible rise or fall

Montana Kid shook his head Its jammed above and no mores coming
down

And the gamble is which jam will break first Sutherland added

Exactly the Kid affirmed If the upper jam breaks first we havent
a chance Nothing will stand before it

The Minook men turned away in silence but soon Rumsky Ho floated upon
the quiet air followed by The Orange and the Black Room was made in
the circle for Montana Kid and the policeman and they quickly caught the
ringing rhythm of the choruses as they drifted on from song to song

Oh Donald will ye no lend a hand Davy sobbed at the foot of the tree
into which his comrade had climbed Oh Donald man will ye no lend a
hand he sobbed again his hands bleeding from vain attempts to scale
the slippery trunk

But Donald had fixed his gaze up river and now his voice rang out
vibrant with fear

 God Almichty here she comes

Standing kneedeep in the icy water the Minook men with Montana Kid and
the policeman gripped hands and raised their voices in the terrible
Battle Hymn of the Republic But the words were drowned in the
advancing roar

And to Donald was vouchsafed a sight such as no man may see and live A
great wall of white flung itself upon the island Trees dogs men were
blotted out as though the hand of God had wiped the face of nature
clean This much he saw then swayed an instant longer in his lofty
perch and hurtled far out into the frozen hell




THE SCORN OF WOMEN


I


Once Freda and Mrs Eppingwell clashed

Now Freda was a Greek girl and a dancer At least she purported to be
Greek but this was doubted by many for her classic face had overmuch
strength in it and the tides of hell which rose in her eyes made at rare
moments her ethnology the more dubious To a fewmenthis sight had
been vouchsafed and though long years may have passed they have not
forgotten nor will they ever forget She never talked of herself so
that it were well to let it go down that when in repose expurgated
Greek she certainly was Her furs were the most magnificent in all the
country from Chilcoot to St Michaels and her name was common on the
lips of men But Mrs Eppingwell was the wife of a captain also a
social constellation of the first magnitude the path of her orbit
marking the most select coterie in Dawsona coterie captioned by the
profane as the official clique Sitka Charley had travelled trail with
her once when famine drew tight and a mans life was less than a cup of
flour and his judgment placed her above all women Sitka Charley was an
Indian his criteria were primitive but his word was flat and his
verdict a hallmark in every camp under the circle

These two women were manconquering mansubduing machines each in her
own way and their ways were different Mrs Eppingwell ruled in her own
house and at the Barracks where were younger sons galore to say
nothing of the chiefs of the police the executive and the judiciary
Freda ruled down in the town but the men she ruled were the same who
functioned socially at the Barracks or were fed tea and canned preserves
at the hand of Mrs Eppingwell in her hillside cabin of roughhewn logs
Each knew the other existed but their lives were apart as the Poles and
while they must have heard stray bits of news and were curious they were
never known to ask a question And there would have been no trouble had
not a free lance in the shape of the modelwoman come into the land on
the first ice with a spanking dogteam and a cosmopolitan reputation
Loraine Lisznayialliterative dramatic and Hungarianprecipitated the
strife and because of her Mrs Eppingwell left her hillside and invaded
Fredas domain and Freda likewise went up from the town to spread
confusion and embarrassment at the Governors ball

All of which may be ancient history so far as the Klondike is concerned
but very few even in Dawson know the inner truth of the matter nor
beyond those few are there any fit to measure the wife of the captain or
the Greek dancer And that all are now permitted to understand let
honor be accorded Sitka Charley From his lips fell the main facts in
the screed herewith presented It ill befits that Freda herself should
have waxed confidential to a mere scribbler of words or that Mrs
Eppingwell made mention of the things which happened They may have
spoken but it is unlikely

Floyd Vanderlip was a strong man apparently Hard work and hard grub
had no terrors for him as his early history in the country attested In
danger he was a lion and when he held in check half a thousand starving
men as he once did it was remarked that no cooler eye ever took the
glint of sunshine on a riflesight He had but one weakness and even
that rising from out his strength was of a negative sort His parts
were strong but they lacked coordination Now it happened that while
his centre of amativeness was pronounced it had lain mute and passive
during the years he lived on moose and salmon and chased glowing
Eldorados over chill divides But when he finally blazed the cornerpost
and centrestakes on one of the richest Klondike claims it began to
quicken and when he took his place in society a fullfledged Bonanza
King it awoke and took charge of him He suddenly recollected a girl in
the States and it came to him quite forcibly not only that she might be
waiting for him but that a wife was a very pleasant acquisition for a
man who lived some several degrees north of 53 So he wrote an
appropriate note enclosed a letter of credit generous enough to cover
all expenses including trousseau and chaperon and addressed it to one
Flossie Flossie One could imagine the rest However after that he
built a comfortable cabin on his claim bought another in Dawson and
broke the news to his friends

And just here is where the lack of coordination came into play The
waiting was tedious and having been long denied the amative element
could not brook further delay Flossie was coming but Loraine Lisznayi
was here And not only was Loraine Lisznayi here but her cosmopolitan
reputation was somewhat the worse for wear and she was not exactly so
young as when she posed in the studios of artist queens and received at
her door the cards of cardinals and princes Also her finances were
unhealthy Having run the gamut in her time she was now not averse to
trying conclusions with a Bonanza King whose wealth was such that he
could not guess it within six figures Like a wise soldier casting about
after years of service for a comfortable billet she had come into the
Northland to be married So one day her eyes flashed up into Floyd
Vanderlips as he was buying table linen for Flossie in the P C
Companys store and the thing was settled out of hand

When a man is free much may go unquestioned which should he be rash
enough to cumber himself with domestic ties society will instantly
challenge Thus it was with Floyd Vanderlip Flossie was coming and a
low buzz went up when Loraine Lisznayi rode down the main street behind
his wolfdogs She accompanied the lady reporter of the Kansas City
Star when photographs were taken of his Bonanza properties and watched
the genesis of a sixcolumn article At that time they were dined
royally in Flossies cabin on Flossies table linen Likewise there
were comings and goings and junketings all perfectly proper by the
way which caused the men to say sharp things and the women to be
spiteful Only Mrs Eppingwell did not hear The distant hum of wagging
tongues rose faintly but she was prone to believe good of people and to
close her ears to evil so she paid no heed

Not so with Freda She had no cause to love men but by some strange
alchemy of her nature her heart went out to womento women whom she
had less cause to love And her heart went out to Flossie even then
travelling the Long Trail and facing into the bitter North to meet a man
who might not wait for her A shrinking clinging sort of a girl Freda
pictured her with weak mouth and pretty pouting lips blowaway
sunkissed hair and eyes full of the merry shallows and the lesser joys
of life But she also pictured Flossie face nosestrapped and frost
rimed stumbling wearily behind the dogs Wherefore she smiled dancing
one night upon Floyd Vanderlip

Few men are so constituted that they may receive the smile of Freda
unmoved nor among them can Floyd Vanderlip be accounted The grace he
had found with the modelwoman had caused him to remeasure himself and
by the favor in which he now stood with the Greek dancer he felt himself
doubly a man There were unknown qualities and depths in him evidently
which they perceived He did not know exactly what those qualities and
depths were but he had a hazy idea that they were there somewhere and
of them was bred a great pride in himself A man who could force two
women such as these to look upon him a second time was certainly a most
remarkable man Some day when he had the time he would sit down and
analyze his strength but now just now he would take what the gods had
given him And a thin little thought began to lift itself and he fell
to wondering whatever under the sun he had seen in Flossie and to regret
exceedingly that he had sent for her Of course Freda was out of the
running His dumps were the richest on Bonanza Creek and they were
many while he was a man of responsibility and position But Loraine
Lisznayishe was just the woman Her life had been large she could do
the honors of his establishment and give tone to his dollars

But Freda smiled and continued to smile till he came to spend much time
with her When she too rode down the street behind his wolfdogs the
modelwoman found food for thought and the next time they were together
dazzled him with her princes and cardinals and personal little anecdotes
of courts and kings She also showed him dainty missives superscribed
My dear Loraine and ended Most affectionately yours and signed by
the given name of a real live queen on a throne And he marvelled in his
heart that the great woman should deign to waste so much as a moment upon
him But she played him cleverly making flattering contrasts and
comparisons between him and the noble phantoms she drew mainly from her
fancy till he went away dizzy with selfdelight and sorrowing for the
world which had been denied him so long Freda was a more masterful
woman If she flattered no one knew it Should she stoop the stoop
were unobserved If a man felt she thought well of him so subtly was
the feeling conveyed that he could not for the life of him say why or
how So she tightened her grip upon Floyd Vanderlip and rode daily
behind his dogs

And just here is where the mistake occurred The buzz rose loudly and
more definitely coupled now with the name of the dancer and Mrs
Eppingwell heard She too thought of Flossie lifting her moccasined
feet through the endless hours and Floyd Vanderlip was invited up the
hillside to tea and invited often This quite took his breath away and
he became drunken with appreciation of himself Never was man so
maltreated His soul had become a thing for which three women struggled
while a fourth was on the way to claim it And three such women

But Mrs Eppingwell and the mistake she made She spoke of the affair
tentatively to Sitka Charley who had sold dogs to the Greek girl But
no names were mentioned The nearest approach to it was when Mrs
Eppingwell said Thiserhorrid woman and Sitka Charley with the
modelwoman strong in his thoughts had echoed erhorrid woman And
he agreed with her that it was a wicked thing for a woman to come
between a man and the girl he was to marry A mere girl Charley she
said I am sure she is And she is coming into a strange country
without a friend when she gets here We must do something Sitka
Charley promised his help and went away thinking what a wicked woman
this Loraine Lisznayi must be also what noble women Mrs Eppingwell and
Freda were to interest themselves in the welfare of the unknown Flossie

Now Mrs Eppingwell was open as the day To Sitka Charley who took her
once past the Hills of Silence belongs the glory of having memorialized
her clearsearching eyes her clearringing voice and her utter
downright frankness Her lips had a way of stiffening to command and
she was used to coming straight to the point Having taken Floyd
Vanderlips measurement she did not dare this with him but she was not
afraid to go down into the town to Freda And down she went in the
bright light of day to the house of the dancer She was above silly
tongues as was her husband the captain She wished to see this woman
and to speak with her nor was she aware of any reason why she should
not So she stood in the snow at the Greek girls door with the frost
at sixty below and parleyed with the waitingmaid for a full five
minutes She had also the pleasure of being turned away from that door
and of going back up the hill wroth at heart for the indignity which had
been put upon her Who was this woman that she should refuse to see
her she asked herself One would think it the other way around and
she herself but a dancing girl denied at the door of the wife of a
captain As it was she knew had Freda come up the hill to herno
matter what the errandshe would have made her welcome at her fire and
they would have sat there as two women and talked merely as two women
She had overstepped convention and lowered herself but she had thought
it different with the women down in the town And she was ashamed that
she had laid herself open to such dishonor and her thoughts of Freda
were unkind

Not that Freda deserved this Mrs Eppingwell had descended to meet her
who was without caste while she strong in the traditions of her own
earlier status had not permitted it She could worship such a woman
and she would have asked no greater joy than to have had her into the
cabin and sat with her just sat with her for an hour But her respect
for Mrs Eppingwell and her respect for herself who was beyond respect
had prevented her doing that which she most desired Though not quite
recovered from the recent visit of Mrs McFee the wife of the minister
who had descended upon her in a whirlwind of exhortation and brimstone
she could not imagine what had prompted the present visit She was not
aware of any particular wrong she had done and surely this woman who
waited at the door was not concerned with the welfare of her soul Why
had she come For all the curiosity she could not help but feel she
steeled herself in the pride of those who are without pride and trembled
in the inner room like a maid on the first caress of a lover If Mrs
Eppingwell suffered going up the hill she too suffered lying face
downward on the bed dryeyed drymouthed dumb

Mrs Eppingwells knowledge of human nature was great She aimed at
universality She had found it easy to step from the civilized and
contemplate things from the barbaric aspect She could comprehend
certain primal and analogous characteristics in a hungry wolfdog or a
starving man and predicate lines of action to be pursued by either under
like conditions To her a woman was a woman whether garbed in purple
or the rags of the gutter Freda was a woman She would not have been
surprised had she been taken into the dancers cabin and encountered on
common ground nor surprised had she been taken in and flaunted in
prideless arrogance But to be treated as she had been treated was
unexpected and disappointing Ergo she had not caught Fredas point of
view And this was good There are some points of view which cannot be
gained save through much travail and personal crucifixion and it were
well for the world that its Mrs Eppingwells should in certain ways
fall short of universality One cannot understand defilement without
laying hands to pitch which is very sticky while there be plenty
willing to undertake the experiment All of which is of small concern
beyond the fact that it gave Mrs Eppingwell ground for grievance and
bred for her a greater love in the Greek girls heart



III


And in this way things went along for a monthMrs Eppingwell striving
to withhold the man from the Greek dancers blandishments against the
time of Flossies coming Flossie lessening the miles each day on the
dreary trail Freda pitting her strength against the modelwoman the
modelwoman straining every nerve to land the prize and the man moving
through it all like a flying shuttle very proud of himself whom he
believed to be a second Don Juan

It was nobodys fault except the mans that Loraine Lisznayi at last
landed him The way of a man with a maid may be too wonderful to know
but the way of a woman with a man passeth all conception whence the
prophet were indeed unwise who would dare forecast Floyd Vanderlips
course twentyfour hours in advance Perhaps the modelwomans
attraction lay in that to the eye she was a handsome animal perhaps she
fascinated him with her oldworld talk of palaces and princes leastwise
she dazzled him whose life had been worked out in uncultured roughness
and he at last agreed to her suggestion of a run down the river and a
marriage at Forty Mile In token of his intention he bought dogs from
Sitka Charleymore than one sled is necessary when a woman like Loraine
Lisznayi takes to the trail and then went up the creek to give orders
for the superintendence of his Bonanza mines during his absence

He had given it out rather vaguely that he needed the animals for
sledding lumber from the mill to his sluices and right here is where
Sitka Charley demonstrated his fitness He agreed to furnish dogs on a
given date but no sooner had Floyd Vanderlip turned his toes upcreek
than Charley hied himself away in perturbation to Loraine Lisznayi Did
she know where Mr Vanderlip had gone He had agreed to supply that
gentleman with a big string of dogs by a certain time but that shameless
one the German trader Meyers had been buying up the brutes and skimped
the market It was very necessary he should see Mr Vanderlip because
of the shameless one he would be all of a week behindhand in filling the
contract She did know where he had gone Upcreek Good He would
strike out after him at once and inform him of the unhappy delay Did he
understand her to say that Mr Vanderlip needed the dogs on Friday night
that he must have them by that time It was too bad but it was the
fault of the shameless one who had bid up the prices They had jumped
fifty dollars per head and should he buy on the rising market he would
lose by the contract He wondered if Mr Vanderlip would be willing to
meet the advance She knew he would Being Mr Vanderlips friend she
would even meet the difference herself And he was to say nothing about
it She was kind to so look to his interests Friday night did she
say Good The dogs would be on hand

An hour later Freda knew the elopement was to be pulled off on Friday
night also that Floyd Vanderlip had gone upcreek and her hands were
tied On Friday morning Devereaux the official courier bearing
despatches from the Governor arrived over the ice Besides the
despatches he brought news of Flossie He had passed her camp at Sixty
Mile humans and dogs were in good condition and she would doubtless be
in on the morrow Mrs Eppingwell experienced a great relief on hearing
this Floyd Vanderlip was safe upcreek and ere the Greek girl could
again lay hands upon him his bride would be on the ground But that
afternoon her big St Bernard valiantly defending her front stoop was
downed by a foraging party of trailstarved Malemutes He was buried
beneath the hirsute mass for about thirty seconds when rescued by a
couple of axes and as many stout men Had he remained down two minutes
the chances were large that he would have been roughly apportioned and
carried away in the respective bellies of the attacking party but as it
was it was a mere case of neat and expeditious mangling Sitka Charley
came to repair the damages especially a right forepaw which had
inadvertently been left a fraction of a second too long in some other
dogs mouth As he put on his mittens to go the talk turned upon
Flossie and in natural sequence passed on to theer horrid woman
Sitka Charley remarked incidentally that she intended jumping out down
river that night with Floyd Vanderlip and further ventured the
information that accidents were very likely at that time of year

So Mrs Eppingwells thoughts of Freda were unkinder than ever She
wrote a note addressed it to the man in question and intrusted it to a
messenger who lay in wait at the mouth of Bonanza Creek Another man
bearing a note from Freda also waited at that strategic point So it
happened that Floyd Vanderlip riding his sled merrily down with the last
daylight received the notes together He tore Fredas across No he
would not go to see her There were greater things afoot that night
Besides she was out of the running But Mrs Eppingwell He would
observe her last wishor rather the last wish it would be possible for
him to observeand meet her at the Governors ball to hear what she had
to say From the tone of the writing it was evidently important
perhaps He smiled fondly but failed to shape the thought Confound it
all what a lucky fellow he was with the women any way Scattering her
letter to the frost he _mushed_ the dogs into a swinging lope and headed
for his cabin It was to be a masquerade and he had to dig up the
costume used at the Opera House a couple of months before Also he had
to shave and to eat Thus it was that he alone of all interested was
unaware of Flossies proximity

Have them down to the waterhole off the hospital at midnight sharp
Dont fail me he said to Sitka Charley who dropped in with the advice
that only one dog was lacking to fill the bill and that that one would
be forthcoming in an hour or so Heres the sack Theres the scales
Weigh out your own dust and dont bother me Ive got to get ready for
the ball

Sitka Charley weighed out his pay and departed carrying with him a
letter to Loraine Lisznayi the contents of which he correctly imagined
to refer to a meeting at the waterhole of the hospital at midnight
sharp



IV


Twice Freda sent messengers up to the Barracks where the dance was in
full swing and as often they came back without answers Then she did
what only Freda could doput on her furs masked her face and went up
herself to the Governors ball Now there happened to be a customnot
an original one by any meansto which the official clique had long since
become addicted It was a very wise custom for it furnished protection
to the womankind of the officials and gave greater selectness to their
revels Whenever a masquerade was given a committee was chosen the
sole function of which was to stand by the door and peep beneath each and
every mask Most men did not clamor to be placed upon this committee
while the very ones who least desired the honor were the ones whose
services were most required The chaplain was not well enough acquainted
with the faces and places of the townspeople to know whom to admit and
whom to turn away In like condition were the several other worthy
gentlemen who would have asked nothing better than to so serve To fill
the coveted place Mrs McFee would have risked her chance of salvation
and did one night when a certain trio passed in under her guns and
muddled things considerably before their identity was discovered
Thereafter only the fit were chosen and very ungracefully did they
respond

On this particular night Prince was at the door Pressure had been
brought to bear and he had not yet recovered from amaze at his having
consented to undertake a task which bid fair to lose him half his
friends merely for the sake of pleasing the other half Three or four
of the men he had refused were men whom he had known on creek and
trailgood comrades but not exactly eligible for so select an affair
He was canvassing the expediency of resigning the post there and then
when a woman tripped in under the light Freda He could swear it by
the furs did he not know that poise of head so well The last one to
expect in all the world He had given her better judgment than to thus
venture the ignominy of refusal or if she passed the scorn of women
He shook his head without scrutiny he knew her too well to be mistaken
But she pressed closer She lifted the black silk ribbon and as quickly
lowered it again For one flashing eternal second he looked upon her
face It was not for nothing the saying which had arisen in the
country that Freda played with men as a child with bubbles Not a word
was spoken Prince stepped aside and a few moments later might have
been seen resigning with warm incoherence the post to which he had been
unfaithful

    

A woman flexible of form slender yet rhythmic of strength in every
movement now pausing with this group now scanning that urged a
restless and devious course among the revellers Men recognized the
furs and marvelledmen who should have served upon the door committee
but they were not prone to speech Not so with the women They had
better eyes for the lines of figure and tricks of carriage and they knew
this form to be one with which they were unfamiliar likewise the furs
Mrs McFee emerging from the supperroom where all was in readiness
caught one flash of the blazing questing eyes through the silken mask
slits and received a start She tried to recollect where she had seen
the like and a vivid picture was recalled of a certain proud and
rebellious sinner whom she had once encountered on a fruitless errand for
the Lord

So it was that the good woman took the trail in hot and righteous wrath
a trail which brought her ultimately into the company of Mrs Eppingwell
and Floyd Vanderlip Mrs Eppingwell had just found the opportunity to
talk with the man She had determined now that Flossie was so near at
hand to proceed directly to the point and an incisive little ethical
discourse was titillating on the end of her tongue when the couple
became three She noted and pleasurably the faintly foreign accent of
the Beg pardon with which the furred woman prefaced her immediate
appropriation of Floyd Vanderlip and she courteously bowed her
permission for them to draw a little apart

Then it was that Mrs McFees righteous hand descended and accompanying
it in its descent was a black mask torn from a startled woman A
wonderful face and brilliant eyes were exposed to the quiet curiosity of
those who looked that way and they were everybody Floyd Vanderlip was
rather confused The situation demanded instant action on the part of a
man who was not beyond his depth while _he_ hardly knew where he was He
stared helplessly about him Mrs Eppingwell was perplexed She could
not comprehend An explanation was forthcoming somewhere and Mrs
McFee was equal to it

Mrs Eppingwell and her Celtic voice rose shrilly it is with great
pleasure I make you acquainted with Freda Moloof _Miss_ Freda Moloof as
I understand

Freda involuntarily turned With her own face bared she felt as in a
dream naked upon her turned the clothed features and gleaming eyes of
the masked circle It seemed almost as though a hungry wolfpack
girdled her ready to drag her down It might chance that some felt pity
for her she thought and at the thought hardened She would by far
prefer their scorn Strong of heart was she this woman and though she
had hunted the prey into the midst of the pack Mrs Eppingwell or no
Mrs Eppingwell she could not forego the kill

But here Mrs Eppingwell did a strange thing So this at last was
Freda she mused the dancer and the destroyer of men the woman from
whose door she had been turned And she too felt the imperious
creatures nakedness as though it were her own Perhaps it was this her
Saxon disinclination to meet a disadvantaged foe perhaps forsooth that
it might give her greater strength in the struggle for the man and it
might have been a little of both but be that as it may she did do this
strange thing When Mrs McFees thin voice vibrant with malice had
raised and Freda turned involuntarily Mrs Eppingwell also turned
removed her mask and inclined her head in acknowledgment

It was another flashing eternal second during which these two women
regarded each other The one eyes blazing meteoric at bay
aggressive suffering in advance and resenting in advance the scorn and
ridicule and insult she had thrown herself open to a beautiful burning
bubbling lava cone of flesh and spirit And the other calmeyed cool
browed serene strong in her own integrity with faith in herself
thoroughly at ease dispassionate imperturbable a figure chiselled from
some cold marble quarry Whatever gulf there might exist she recognized
it not No bridging no descending her attitude was that of perfect
equality She stood tranquilly on the ground of their common womanhood
And this maddened Freda Not so had she been of lesser breed but her
souls plummet knew not the bottomless and she could follow the other
into the deeps of her deepest depths and read her aright Why do you
not draw back your garments hem she was fain to cry out all in that
flashing dazzling second Spit upon me revile me and it were greater
mercy than this She trembled Her nostrils distended and quivered
But she drew herself in check returned the inclination of head and
turned to the man

Come with me Floyd she said simply I want you now

What the he began explosively and quit as suddenly discreet enough
to not round it off Where the deuce had his wits gone anyway Was
ever a man more foolishly placed He gurgled deep down in his throat and
high up in the roof of his mouth heaved as one his big shoulders and his
indecision and glared appealingly at the two women

I beg pardon just a moment but may I speak first with Mr Vanderlip
Mrs Eppingwells voice though flutelike and low predicated will in
its every cadence

The man looked his gratitude He at least was willing enough

Im very sorry from Freda There isnt time He must come at once
The conventional phrases dropped easily from her lips but she could not
forbear to smile inwardly at their inadequacy and weakness She would
much rather have shrieked

But Miss Moloof who are you that you may possess yourself of Mr
Vanderlip and command his actions

Whereupon relief brightened his face and the man beamed his approval
Trust Mrs Eppingwell to drag him clear Freda had met her match this
time

II Freda hesitated and then her feminine mind putting on its
harnessand who are you to ask this question

I I am Mrs Eppingwell and

There the other broke in sharply You are the wife of a captain who
is therefore your husband I am only a dancing girl What do you with
this man

Such unprecedented behavior Mrs McFee ruffled herself and cleared for
action but Mrs Eppingwell shut her mouth with a look and developed a
new attack

Since Miss Moloof appears to hold claims upon you Mr Vanderlip and is
in too great haste to grant me a few seconds of your time I am forced to
appeal directly to you May I speak with you alone and now

Mrs McFees jaws brought together with a snap That settled the
disgraceful situation

Why erthat is certainly the man stammered Of course of
course growing more effusive at the prospect of deliverance

Men are only gregarious vertebrates domesticated and evolved and the
chances are large that it was because the Greek girl had in her time
dealt with wilder masculine beasts of the human sort for she turned upon
the man with hells tides aflood in her blazing eyes much as a
bespangled lady upon a lion which has suddenly imbibed the pernicious
theory that he is a free agent The beast in him fawned to the lash

That is to say ah afterward Tomorrow Mrs Eppingwell yes
tomorrow That is what I meant He solaced himself with the fact
should he remain that more embarrassment awaited Also he had an
engagement which he must keep shortly down by the waterhole off the
hospital Ye gods he had never given Freda credit Wasnt she
magnificent

Ill thank you for my mask Mrs McFee

That lady for the nonce speechless turned over the article in question

Goodnight Miss Moloof Mrs Eppingwell was royal even in defeat

Freda reciprocated though barely downing the impulse to clasp the
others knees and beg forgivenessno not forgiveness but something
she knew not what but which she none the less greatly desired

The man was for her taking his arm but she had made her kill in the
midst of the pack and that which led kings to drag their vanquished at
the chariottail led her toward the door alone Floyd Vanderlip close at
heel and striving to reestablish his mental equilibrium



V


It was bitter cold As the trail wound a quarter of a mile brought them
to the dancers cabin by which time her moist breath had coated her face
frostily while his had massed his heavy mustache till conversation was
painful By the greenish light of the aurora borealis the quicksilver
showed itself frozen hard in the bulb of the thermometer which hung
outside the door A thousand dogs in pitiful chorus wailed their
ancient wrongs and claimed mercy from the unheeding stars Not a breath
of air was moving For them there was no shelter from the cold no
shrewd crawling to leeward in snug nooks The frost was everywhere and
they lay in the open ever and anon stretching their trailstiffened
muscles and lifting the long wolfhowl

They did not talk at first the man and the woman While the maid helped
Freda off with her wraps Floyd Vanderlip replenished the fire and by
the time the maid had withdrawn to an inner room his head over the
stove he was busily thawing out his burdened upper lip After that he
rolled a cigarette and watched her lazily through the fragrant eddies
She stole a glance at the clock It lacked half an hour of midnight How
was she to hold him Was he angry for that which she had done What was
his mood What mood of hers could meet his best Not that she doubted
herself No no Hold him she could if need be at pistol point till
Sitka Charleys work was done and Devereauxs too

There were many ways and with her knowledge of this her contempt for the
man increased As she leaned her head on her hand a fleeting vision of
her own girlhood with its mournful climacteric and tragic ebb was
vouchsafed her and for the moment she was minded to read him a lesson
from it God it must be less than human brute who could not be held by
such a tale told as she could tell it butbah He was not worth it
nor worth the pain to her The candle was positioned just right and
even as she thought of these things sacredly shameful to her he was
pleasuring in the transparent pinkiness of her ear She noted his eye
took the cue and turned her head till the clean profile of the face was
presented Not the least was that profile among her virtues She could
not help the lines upon which she had been builded and they were very
good but she had long since learned those lines and though little they
needed was not above advantaging them to the best of her ability The
candle began to flicker She could not do anything ungracefully but
that did not prevent her improving upon nature a bit when she reached
forth and deftly snuffed the red wick from the midst of the yellow flame
Again she rested head on hand this time regarding the man thoughtfully
and any man is pleased when thus regarded by a pretty woman

She was in little haste to begin If dalliance were to his liking it
was to hers To him it was very comfortable soothing his lungs with
nicotine and gazing upon her It was snug and warm here while down by
the waterhole began a trail which he would soon be hitting through the
chilly hours He felt he ought to be angry with Freda for the scene she
had created but somehow he didnt feel a bit wrathful Like as not
there wouldnt have been any scene if it hadnt been for that McFee
woman If he were the Governor he would put a poll tax of a hundred
ounces a quarter upon her and her kind and all gospel sharks and sky
pilots And certainly Freda had behaved very ladylike held her own with
Mrs Eppingwell besides Never gave the girl credit for the grit He
looked lingeringly over her coming back now and again to the eyes
behind the deep earnestness of which he could not guess lay concealed a
deeper sneer And Jove wasnt she well put up Wonder why she looked
at him so Did she want to marry him too Like as not but she wasnt
the only one Her looks were in her favor werent they And
youngyounger than Loraine Lisznayi She couldnt be more than twenty
three or four twentyfive at most And shed never get stout Anybody
could guess that the first time He couldnt say it of Loraine though
_She_ certainly had put on flesh since the day she served as model Huh
once he got her on trail hed take it off Put her on the snowshoes to
break ahead of the dogs Never knew it to fail yet But his thought
leaped ahead to the palace under the lazy Mediterranean skyand how
would it be with Loraine then No frost no trail no famine now and
again to cheer the monotony and she getting older and piling it on with
every sunrise While this girl Fredahe sighed his unconscious regret
that he had missed being born under the flag of the Turk and came back
to Alaska

Well Both hands of the clock pointed perpendicularly to midnight and
it was high time he was getting down to the waterhole

Oh Freda started and she did it prettily delighting him as his
fellows have ever been delighted by their womankind When a man is made
to believe that a woman looking upon him thoughtfully has lost herself
in meditation over him that man needs be an extremely coldblooded
individual in order to trim his sheets set a lookout and steer clear

I was just wondering what you wanted to see me about he explained
drawing his chair up to hers by the table

Floyd she looked him steadily in the eyes I am tired of the whole
business I want to go away I cant live it out here till the river
breaks If I try Ill die I am sure of it I want to quit it all and
go away and I want to do it at once

She laid her hand in mute appeal upon the back of his which turned over
and became a prison Another one he thought just throwing herself at
him Guess it wouldnt hurt Loraine to cool her feet by the waterhole a
little longer

Well This time from Freda but softly and anxiously

I dont know what to say he hastened to answer adding to himself that
it was coming along quicker than he had expected Nothing Id like
better Freda You know that well enough He pressed her hand palm to
palm She nodded Could she wonder that she despised the breed

But you see IIm engaged Of course you know that And the girls
coming into the country to marry me Dont know what was up with me when
I asked her but it was a long while back and I was allfired young

I want to go away out of the land anywhere she went on disregarding
the obstacle he had reared up and apologized for I have been running
over the men I know and reached the conclusion thatthat

I was the likeliest of the lot

She smiled her gratitude for his having saved her the embarrassment of
confession He drew her head against his shoulder with the free hand
and somehow the scent of her hair got into his nostrils Then he
discovered that a common pulse throbbed throbbed throbbed where their
palms were in contact This phenomenon is easily comprehensible from a
physiological standpoint but to the man who makes the discovery for the
first time it is a most wonderful thing Floyd Vanderlip had caressed
more shovelhandles than womens hands in his time so this was an
experience quite new and delightfully strange And when Freda turned her
head against his shoulder her hair brushing his cheek till his eyes met
hers full and at close range luminously soft ay and tenderwhy
whose fault was it that he lost his grip utterly False to Flossie why
not to Loraine Even if the women did keep bothering him that was no
reason he should make up his mind in a hurry Why he had slathers of
money and Freda was just the girl to grace it A wife shed make him
for other men to envy But go slow He must be cautious

You dont happen to care for palaces do you he asked

She shook her head

Well I had a hankering after them myself till I got to thinking a
while back and Ive about sized it up that oned get fat living in
palaces and soft and lazy

Yes its nice for a time but you soon grow tired of it I imagine
she hastened to reassure him The world is good but life should be
manysided Rough and knock about for a while and then rest up
somewhere Off to the South Seas on a yacht then a nibble of Paris a
winter in South America and a summer in Norway a few months in England

Good society

Most certainlythe best and then heigho for the dogs and sleds and
the Hudson Bay Country Change you know A strong man like you full
of vitality and go could not possibly stand a palace for a year It is
all very well for effeminate men but you werent made for such a life
You are masculine intensely masculine

Think so

It does not require thinking I know Have you ever noticed that it
was easy to make women care for you

His dubious innocence was superb

It is very easy And why Because you are masculine You strike the
deepest chords of a womans heart You are something to cling tobig
muscled strong and brave In short because you _are_ a man

She shot a glance at the clock It was half after the hour She had
given a margin of thirty minutes to Sitka Charley and it did not matter
now when Devereaux arrived Her work was done She lifted her head
laughed her genuine mirth slipped her hand clear and rising to her feet
called the maid

Alice help Mr Vanderlip on with his _parka_ His mittens are on the
sill by the stove

The man could not understand

Let me thank you for your kindness Floyd Your time was invaluable to
me and it was indeed good of you The turning to the left as you leave
the cabin leads the quickest to the waterhole Goodnight I am going
to bed

Floyd Vanderlip employed strong words to express his perplexity and
disappointment Alice did not like to hear men swear so dropped his
_parka_ on the floor and tossed his mittens on top of it Then he made a
break for Freda and she ruined her retreat to the inner room by tripping
over the _parka_ He brought her up standing with a rude grip on the
wrist But she only laughed She was not afraid of men Had they not
wrought their worst with her and did she not still endure

Dont be rough she said finally On second thought here she looked
at his detaining hand Ive decided not to go to bed yet a while Do
sit down and be comfortable instead of ridiculous Any questions

Yes my lady and reckoning too He still kept his hold What do
you know about the waterhole What did you mean byno never mind One
question at a time

Oh nothing much Sitka Charley had an appointment there with somebody
you may know and not being anxious for a man of your known charm to be
present fell back upon me to kindly help him Thats all Theyre off
now and a good half hour ago

Where Down river and without me And he an Indian

Theres no accounting for taste you know especially in a woman

But how do I stand in this deal Ive lost four thousand dollars worth
of dogs and a tidy bit of a woman and nothing to show for it Except
you he added as an afterthought and cheap you are at the price

Freda shrugged her shoulders

You might as well get ready Im going out to borrow a couple of teams
of dogs and well start in as many hours

I am very sorry but Im going to bed

Youll pack if you know whats good for you Go to bed or not when I
get my dogs outside so help me onto the sled you go Mebbe you fooled
with me but Ill just see your bluff and take you in earnest Hear me

He closed on her wrist till it hurt but on her lips a smile was growing
and she seemed to listen intently to some outside sound There was a
jingle of dog bells and a mans voice crying Haw as a sled took the
turning and drew up at the cabin

_Now_ will you let me go to bed

As Freda spoke she threw open the door Into the warm room rushed the
frost and on the threshold garbed in trailworn furs kneedeep in the
swirling vapor against a background of flaming borealis a woman
hesitated She removed her nosetrap and stood blinking blindly in the
white candlelight Floyd Vanderlip stumbled forward

Floyd she cried relieved and glad and met him with a tired bound

What could he but kiss the armful of furs And a pretty armful it was
nestling against him wearily but happy

It was good of you spoke the armful to send Mr Devereaux with fresh
dogs after me else I would not have been in till tomorrow

The man looked blankly across at Freda then the light breaking in upon
him And wasnt it good of Devereaux to go

Couldnt wait a bit longer could you dear Flossie snuggled closer

Well I was getting sort of impatient he confessed glibly at the same
time drawing her up till her feet left the floor and getting outside the
door

That same night an inexplicable thing happened to the Reverend James
Brown missionary who lived among the natives several miles down the
Yukon and saw to it that the trails they trod led to the white mans
paradise He was roused from his sleep by a strange Indian who gave
into his charge not only the soul but the body of a woman and having
done this drove quickly away This woman was heavy and handsome and
angry and in her wrath unclean words fell from her mouth This shocked
the worthy man but he was yet young and her presence would have been
pernicious in the simple eyes of his flock had she not struck out on
foot for Dawson with the first gray of dawn

The shock to Dawson came many days later when the summer had come and
the population honored a certain royal lady at Windsor by lining the
Yukons bank and watching Sitka Charley rise up with flashing paddle and
drive the first canoe across the line On this day of the races Mrs
Eppingwell who had learned and unlearned numerous things saw Freda for
the first time since the night of the ball Publicly mind you as
Mrs McFee expressed it without regard or respect for the morals of the
community she went up to the dancer and held out her hand At first
it is remembered by those who saw the girl shrank back then words
passed between the two and Freda great Freda broke down and wept on
the shoulder of the captains wife It was not given to Dawson to know
why Mrs Eppingwell should crave forgiveness of a Greek dancing girl but
she did it publicly and it was unseemly

It were well not to forget Mrs McFee She took a cabin passage on the
first steamer going out She also took with her a theory which she had
achieved in the silent watches of the long dark nights and it is her
conviction that the Northland is unregenerate because it is so cold
there Fear of hellfire cannot be bred in an icebox This may appear
dogmatic but it is Mrs McFees theory

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergnetfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including including checks online payments and credit card
