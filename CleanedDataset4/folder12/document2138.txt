Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

PART I

THE BRIDGEBUILDERS

A WALKING DELEGATE

THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF

THE TOMB OF HIS ANCESTORS

THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP SEA

WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR PART I

WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR  PART II

THE SON OF HIS FATHER

THE BRIDGEBUILDERS

The least that Findlayson of the Public Works Department
expected was a CIE he dreamed of a C S I Indeed his
friends told him that he deserved more For three years he had
endured heat and cold disappointment discomfort danger and
disease with responsibility almost to topheavy for one pair of
shoulders and day by day through that time the great Kashi
Bridge over the Ganges had grown under his charge Now in less
than three months if all went well his Excellency the Viceroy
would open the bridge in state an archbishop would bless it
and the first trainload of soldiers would come over it and
there would be speeches

Findlayson C E sat in his trolley on a construction line that
ran along one of the main revetments  the huge stonefaced
banks that flared away north and south for three miles on either
side of the river and permitted himself to think of the end
With its approaches his work was one mile and threequarters in
length a latticegirder bridge trussed with the Findlayson
truss standing on sevenandtwenty brick piers Each one of those
piers was twentyfour feet in diameter capped with red Agra
stone and sunk eighty feet below the shifting sand of the Ganges
bed Above them was a railwayline fifteen feet broad above
that again a cartroad of eighteen feet flanked with
footpaths At either end rose towers of red brick loopholed
for musketry and pierced for big guns and the ramp of the road
was being pushed forward to their haunches The raw earthends
were crawling and alive with hundreds upon hundreds of tiny asses
climbing out of the yawning borrowpit below with sackfuls of
stuff and the hot afternoon air was filled with the noise of
hooves the rattle of the drivers sticks and the swish and
rolldown of the dirt The river was very low and on the
dazzling white sand between the three centre piers stood squat
cribs of railwaysleepers filled within and daubed without with
mud to support the last of the girders as those were riveted up
In the little deep water left by the drought an overhead crane
travelled to and fro along its spilepier jerking sections of
iron into place snorting and backing and grunting as an elephant
grunts in the timberyard Riveters by the hundred swarmed about
the lattice sidework and the iron roof of the railway line hung
from invisible staging under the bellies of the girders
clustered round the throats of the piers and rode on the
overhang
of the footpathstanchions their firepots and the spurts of
flame that answered each hammerstroke showing no more than pale
yellow in the suns glare East and west and north and south the
constructiontrains rattled and shrieked up and down the
embankments the piled trucks of brown and white stone banging
behind them till the sideboards were unpinned and with a roar
and a grumble a few thousand tons more material were flung out
to hold the river in place Findlayson C E turned on his
trolley and looked over the face of the country that he had
changed for seven miles around Looked back on the humming
village of five thousand workmen up stream and down along the
vista of spurs and sand across the river to the far piers
lessening in the haze overhead to the guardtowers and only he
knew how strong those were  and with a sigh of contentment saw
that his work was good There stood his bridge before him in
the sunlight lacking only a few weeks work on the girders of
the three middle piers  his bridge raw and ugly as original
sin but pukka  permanent  to endure when all memory of the
builder yea even of the splendid Findlayson truss has
perished Practically the thing was done

Hitchcock his assistant cantered along the line on a little
switchtailed Kabuli pony who through long practice could have
trotted securely over trestleand nodded to his chief

All but said he with a smile

Ive been thinking about it the senior answered Not half a
bad job for two men is it

One  and a half Gad what a Coopers Hill cub I was when I
came on the works Hitchcock felt very old in the crowded
experiences of the past three years that had taught him power
and responsibility

You were rather a colt said Findlayson I wonder how youll
like going back to officework when this jobs over

I shall hate it said the young man and as he went on his eye
followed Findlaysons and he muttered Isnt it damned good

I think well go up the service together Findlayson said to
himself Youre too good a youngster to waste on another man
Cub thou wast assistant thou art Personal assistant and at
Simla thou shalt be if any credit comes to me out of the
business

Indeed the burden of the work had fallen altogether on
Findlayson and his assistant the young man whom he had chosen
because of his rawness to break to his own needs There were
labour contractors by the halfhundred  fitters and riveters
European borrowed from the railway workshops with perhaps
twenty white and halfcaste subordinates to direct under
direction the bevies of workmen  but none knew better than
these two who trusted each other how the underlings were not
to be trusted They had been tried many times in sudden crises
 by slipping of booms by breaking of tackle failure of cranes
and the wrath of the river  but no stress had brought to light
any man among men whom Findlayson and Hitchcock would have
honoured by working as remorselessly as they worked themselves
Findlayson thought it over from the beginning the months of
officework destroyed at a blow when the Government of India at
the last moment added two feet to the width of the bridge under
the impression that bridges were cut out of paper and so brought
to ruin at least half an acre of calculations and Hitchcock new
to disappointment buried his head in his arms and wept the
heartbreaking delays over the filling of the contracts in
England the futile correspondences hinting at great wealth of
commissions if one only one rather doubtful consignment were
passed the war that followed the refusal the careful polite
obstruction at the other end that followed the war till young
Hitchcock putting one months leave to another month and
borrowing ten days from Findlayson spent his poor little savings
of a year in a wild dash to London and there as his own tongue
asserted and the later consignments proved put the fear of God
into a man so great that he feared only Parliament and said so
till Hitchcock wrought with him across his own dinner table and
 he feared the Kashi Bridge and all who spoke in its name Then
there was the cholera that came in the night to the village by
the bridge works and after the cholera smote the smallpox The
fever they had always with them Hitchcock had been appointed a
magistrate of the third class with whipping powers for the
better government of the community and Findlayson watched him
wield his powers temperately learning what to overlook and what
to look after It was a long long reverie and it covered
storm sudden freshets death in every manner and shape violent
and awful rage against red tape half frenzying a mind that knows
it should be busy on other things drought sanitation finance
birth wedding burial and riot in the village of twenty warring
castes argument expostulation persuasion and the blank
despair that a man goes to bed upon thankful that his rifle is
all in pieces in the guncase Behind everything rose the black
frame of the Kashi Bridge  plate by plate girder by girder
span by span  and each pier of it recalled Hitchcock the
allround man who had stood by his chief without failing from
the very first to this last

So the bridge was two mens work  unless one counted Peroo as
Peroo certainly counted himself He was a Lascar a Kharva from
Bulsar familiar with every port between Rockhampton and London
who had risen to the rank of serang on the British India boats
but wearying of routine musters and clean clothes had thrown up
the service and gone inland where men of his calibre were sure
of employment For his knowledge of tackle and the handling of
heavy weights Peroo was worth almost any price he might have
chosen to put upon his services but custom decreed the wage of
the overheadmen and Peroo was not within many silver pieces of
his proper value Neither running water nor extreme heights made
him afraid and as an exserang he knew how to hold authority
No piece of iron was so big or so badly placed that Peroo could
not devise a tackle to lift it  a looseended sagging
arrangement rigged with a scandalous amount of talking but
perfectly equal to the work in hand It was Peroo who had saved
the girder of Number Seven pier from destruction when the new
wirerope jammed in the eye of the crane and the huge plate
tilted in its slings threatening to slide out sideways Then
the native workmen lost their heads with great shoutings and
Hitchcocks right arm was broken by a falling Tplate and he
buttoned it up in his coat and swooned and came to and directed
for four hours till Peroo from the top of the crane reported
Alls well and the plate swung home There was no one like
Peroo serang to lash and guy and hold to control the
donkeyengines to hoist a fallen locomotive craftily out of the
borrowpit into which it had tumbled to strip and dive if need
be to see how the concrete blocks round the piers stood the
scouring of Mother Gunga or to adventure upstream on a monsoon
night and report on the state of the embankmentfacings He
would interrupt the fieldcouncils of Findlayson and Hitchcock
without fear till his wonderful English or his still more
wonderful lingua franca half Portuguese and half Malay ran out
and he was forced to take string and show the knots that he would
recommend He controlled his own gang of tackle men 
mysterious relatives from Kutch Mandvi gathered month by month
and tried to the uttermost No consideration of family or kin
allowed Peroo to keep weak hands or a giddy head on the
payroll My honour is the honour of this bridge he would
say to the abouttobedismissed What do I care for your
honour Go and work on a steamer That is all you are fit for

The little cluster of huts where he and his gang lived centred
round the tattered dwelling of a seapriest  one who had never
set foot on black water but had been chosen as ghostly
counsellor by two generations of searovers all unaffected by
port missions or those creeds which are thrust upon sailors by
agencies along Thames bank The priest of the Lascars had
nothing to do with their caste or indeed with anything at all
He ate the offerings of his church and slept and smoked and
slept again for said Peroo who had haled him a thousand
miles inland he is a very holy man He never cares what you
eat so long as you do not eat beef and that is good because on
land we worship Shiva we Kharvas but at sea on the Kumpanis
boats we attend strictly to the orders of the Burra Malum the
first mate and on this bridge we observe what Finlinson Sahib
says

Finlinson Sahib had that day given orders to clear the
scaffolding from the guardtower on the right bank and Peroo
with his mates was casting loose and lowering down the bamboo
poles and planks as swiftly as ever they had whipped the cargo
out of a coaster

From his trolley he could hear the whistle of the serangs
silver pipe and the creek and clatter of the pulleys Peroo was
standing on the topmost coping of the tower clad in the blue
dungaree of his abandoned service and as Findlayson motioned to
him to be careful for his was no life to throw away he gripped
the last pole and shading his eyes shipfashion answered with
the longdrawn wail of the focsle lookout Ham dekhta hai
I
am looking out Findlayson laughed and then sighed It was
years since he had seen a steamer and he was sick for home As
his trolley passed under the tower Peroo descended by a rope
apefashion and cried It looks well now Sahib Our bridge is
all but done What think you Mother Gunga will say when the rail
runs over

She has said little so far It was never Mother Gunga that
delayed us

There is always time for her and none the less there has been
delay Has the Sahib forgotten last autumns flood when the
stoneboats were sunk without warning  or only a halfdays
warning

Yes but nothing save a big flood could hurt us now The spurs
are holding well on the West Bank

Mother Gunga eats great allowances There is always room for
more stone on the revetments I tell this to the Chota Sahib 
he meant Hitchcock  and he laughs

No matter Peroo Another year thou wilt be able to build a
bridge in thine own fashion

The Lascar grinned Then it will not be in this way  with
stonework sunk under water as the Qyetta was sunk I like
sussuspensheen bridges that fly from bank to bank with one
big step like a gangplank Then no water can hurt When does
the Lord Sahib come to open the bridge

In three months when the weather is cooler

Ho ho He is like the Burra Malum He sleeps below while the
work is being done Then he comes upon the quarterdeck and
touches with his finger and says This is not clean Dam
jibboonwallah

But the Lord Sahib does not call me a dam jibboonwallah Peroo

No Sahib but he does not come on deck till the work is all
finished Even the Burra Malum of the Nerbudda said once at
Tuticorin 

Bah Go I am busy

I also said Peroo with an unshaken countenance May I take
the light dinghy now and row along the spurs

To hold them with thy hands They are I think sufficiently
heavy

Nay Sahib It is thus At sea on the Black Water we have
room to be blown up and down without care Here we have no room
at all Look you we have put the river into a dock and run her
between stone sills

Findlayson smiled at the we

We have bitted and bridled her She is not like the sea that
can beat against a soft beach She is Mother Gunga  in irons
His voice fell a little

Peroo thou hast been up and down the world more even than I
Speak true talk now How much dost thou in thy heart believe of
Mother Gunga

All that our priest says London is London Sahib Sydney is
Sydney and Port Darwin is Port Darwin Also Mother Gunga is
Mother Gunga and when I come back to her banks I know this and
worship In London I did poojah to the big temple by the river
for the sake of the God within    Yes I will not take the
cushions in the dinghy

Findlayson mounted his horse and trotted to the shed of a
bungalow that he shared with his assistant The place had
become home to him in the last three years He had grilled in
the heat sweated in the rains and shivered with fever under
the rude thatch roof the limewash beside the door was covered
with rough drawings and formulae and the sentrypath trodden in
the matting of the verandah showed where he had walked alone
There is no eighthour limit to an engineers work and the
evening meal with Hitchcock was eaten booted and spurred over
their cigars they listened to the hum of the village as the
gangs came up from the riverbed and the lights began to
twinkle

Peroo has gone up the spurs in your dinghy Hes taken a couple
of nephews with him and hes lolling in the stern like a
commodore said Hitchcock

Thats all right Hes got something on his mind Youd think
that ten years in the British India boats would have knocked
most of his religion out of him

So it has said Hitchcock chuckling I overheard him the
other day in the middle of a most atheistical talk with that fat
old guru of theirs Peroo denied the efficacy of prayer and
wanted the guru to go to sea and watch a gale out with him and
see if he could stop a monsoon

All the same if you carried off his guru hed leave us like a
shot He was yarning away to me about praying to the dome of St
Pauls when he was in London

He told me that the first time he went into the engineroom of a
steamer when he was a boy he prayed to the lowpressure
cylinder

Not half a bad thing to pray to either Hes propitiating his
own Gods now and he wants to know what Mother Gunga will think
of a bridge being run across her Whos there A shadow
darkened the doorway and a telegram was put into Hitchcocks
hand

She ought to be pretty well used to it by this time Only a tar

It ought to be Rallis answer about the new rivets    Great
Heavens Hitchcock jumped to his feet

What is it said the senior and took the form thats what
Mother Gunga thinks is it he said reading Keep cool young
un Weve got all our work cut out for us Lets see Muir wired
half an hour ago Floods on the Ramgunga Look out Well that
gives us  one two  nine and a half for the flood to reach
Melipur Ghaut and sevens sixteen and a half to Lataoli  say
fifteen hours before it comes down to us

Curse that hillfed sewer of a Ramgunga Findlayson this is two
months before anything could have been expected and the left
bank is littered up with stuff still Two full months before
the time

Thats why it comes Ive only known Indian rivers for
fiveandtwenty years and I dont pretend to understand Here
comes another tar Findlayson opened the telegram Cockran
this time from the Ganges Canal Heavy rains here Bad He
might have saved the last word Well we dont want to know any
more Weve got to work the gangs all night and clean up the
riverbed Youll take the east bank and work out to meet me in
the middle Get everything that floats below the bridge we
shall have quite enough rivercraft coming down adrift anyhow
without letting the stoneboats ram the piers What have you got
on the east bank that needs looking after

Pontoon  one big pontoon with the overhead crane on it
Tother overhead crane on the mended pontoon with the cartroad
rivets from Twenty to Twentythree piers  two construction
lines and a turningspur The pilework must take its chance
said Hitchcock

All right Roll up everything you can lay hands on Well give
the gang fifteen minutes more to eat their grub

Close to the verandah stood a big nightgong never used except
for flood or fire in the village Hitchcock had called for a
fresh horse and was off to his side of the bridge when
Findlayson took the clothbound stick and smote with the rubbing
stroke that brings out the full thunder of the metal

Long before the last rumble ceased every nightgong in the
village had taken up the warning To these were added the hoarse
screaming of conches in the little temples the throbbing of
drums and tomtoms and from the European quarters where the
riveters lived McCartneys bugle a weapon of offence on Sundays
and festivals brayed desperately calling to Stables Engine
after engine toiling home along the spurs at the end of her days
work whistled in answer till the whistles were answered from the
far bank Then the big gong thundered thrice for a sign that it
was flood and not fire conch drum and whistle echoed the
call and the village quivered to the sound of bare feet running
upon soft earth The order in all cases was to stand by the
days work and wait instructions The gangs poured by in the
dusk men stopping to knot a loincloth or fasten a sandal
gangforemen shouting to their subordinates as they ran or paused
by the toolissue sheds for bars and mattocks locomotives
creeping down their tracks wheeldeep in the crowd till the
brown torrent disappeared into the dusk of the riverbed raced
over the pilework swarmed along the lattices clustered by the
cranes and stood still  each man in his place

Then the troubled beating of the gong carried the order to take
up everything and bear it beyond highwater mark and the
flarelamps broke out by the hundred between the webs of dull
iron as the riveters began a nights work racing against the
flood that was to come The girders of the three centre piers 
those that stood on the cribs were all but in position They
needed just as many rivets as could be driven into them for the
flood would assuredly wash out their supports and the ironwork
would settle down on the caps of stone if they were not blocked
at the ends A hundred crowbars strained at the sleepers of the
temporary line that fed the unfinished piers It was heaved up
in lengths loaded into trucks and backed up the bank beyond
floodlevel by the groaning locomotives The toolsheds on the
sands melted away before the attack of shouting armies and with
them went the stacked ranks of Government stores ironhound
boxes of rivets pliers cutters duplicate parts of the
rivetingmachines spare pumps and chains The big crane would
be the last to be shifted for she was hoisting all the heavy
stuff up to the main structure of the bridge The concrete
blocks on the fleet of stoneboats were dropped overside where
there was any depth of water to guard the piers and the empty
boats themselves were poled under the bridge downstream It was
here that Peroos pipe shrilled loudest for the first stroke of
the big gong had brought the dinghy back at racing speed and
Peroo and his people were stripped to the waist working for the
honour and credit which are better than life

I knew she would speak he cried I knew but the telegraph
gives us good warning O sons of unthinkable begetting 
children of unspeakable shame  are we here for the look of the
thing It was two feet of wirerope frayed at the ends and it
did wonders as Peroo leaped from gunnel to gunnel shouting the
language of the sea

Findlayson was more troubled for the stone boats than anything
else McCartney with his gangs was blocking up the ends of
the three doubtful spans but boats adrift if the flood chanced
to be a high one might endanger the girders and there was a
very fleet in the shrunken channel

Get them behind the swell of the guard tower he shouted down
to
Peroo It will be deadwater there Get them below the
bridge

Accha Very good I know we are mooring them with
wirerope was the answer Heh Listen to the Chota Sahib He
is working hard

From across the river came an almost continuous whistling of
locomotives backed by the rumble of stone Hitchcock at the
last minute was spending a few hundred more trucks of Tarakee
stone in reinforcing his spurs and embankments

The bridge challenges Mother Gunga said Peroo with a laugh
But when she talks I know whose voice will be the loudest

For hours the naked men worked screaming and shouting under the
lights It was a hot moonless night the end of it was
darkened by clouds and a sudden squall that made Findlayson very
grave

She moves said Peroo just before the dawn Mother Gunga is
awake Hear He dipped his hand over the side of a boat and the
current mumbled on it A little wave hit the side of a pier with
a crisp slap

Six hours before her time said Findlayson mopping his
forehead savagely Now we cant depend on anything Wed
better clear all hands out of the riverbed

Again the big gong beat and a second time there was the rushing
of naked feet on earth and ringing iron the clatter of tools
ceased In the silence men heard the dry yawn of water
crawling over thirsty sand

Foreman after foreman shouted to Findlayson who had posted
himself by the guardtower that his section of the riverbed
had been cleaned out and when the last voice dropped Findlayson
hurried over the bridge till the iron plating of the permanent
way gave place to the temporary plankwalk over the three centre
piers and there he met Hitchcock

All clear your side said Findlayson The whisper rang in the

box of lattice work

Yes and the east channels filling now Were utterly out of
our reckoning When is this thing down on us

Theres no saying Shes filling as fast as she can Look
Findlayson pointed to the planks below his feet where the sand
burned and defiled by months of work was beginning to whisper
and fizz

What orders said Hitchcock

Call the roll  count stores sit on your hunkers  and pray for
the bridge Thats all I can think of Good night Dont risk
your life trying to fish out anything that may go downstream

Oh Ill be as prudent as you are Night Heavens how shes
filling Heres the rain in earnest

Findlayson picked his way back to his bank sweeping the last of
McCartneys riveters before him The gangs had spread themselves
along the embankments regardless of the cold rain of the dawn
and there they waited for the flood Only Peroo kept his men
together behind the swell of the guardtower where the
stoneboats lay tied fore and aft with hawsers wirerope and
chains

A shrill wail ran along the line growing to a yell half fear
and half wonder the face of the river whitened from bank to
hank between the stone facings and the faraway spurs went out
in spouts of foam Mother Gunga had come bankhigh in haste
and a wall of chocolatecoloured water was her messenger There
was a shriek above the roar of the water the complaint of the
spans coming down on their blocks as the cribs were whirled out
from under their bellies The stoneboats groaned and ground
each other in the eddy that swung round the abutment and their
clumsy masts rose higher and higher against the dim skyline

Before she was shut between these walls we knew what she would
do Now she isthus cramped God only knows what she will do
said Peroo watching the furious turmoil round the guardtower
Ohe Fight then Fight hard for it is thus that a woman wears
herself out

But Mother Gunga would not fight as Peroo desired After the
first downstream plunge there came no more walls of water but
the river lifted herself bodily as a snake when she drinks in
midsummer plucking and fingering along the revetments and
banking up behind the piers till even Findlayson began to
recalculate the strength of his work

When day came the village gasped Only last night men said
turning to each other it was as a town in the riverbed Look
now

And they looked and wondered afresh at the deep water the racing
water that licked the throat of the piers The farther bank was
veiled by rain into which the bridge ran out and vanished the
spurs upstream were marked by no more than eddies and
spoutings and downstream the pent river once freed of her
guidelines had spread like a sea to the horizon Then hurried
by rolling in the water dead men and oxen together with here
and there a patch of thatched roof that melted when it touched a
pier

Big flood said Peroo and Findlayson nodded It was as big a
flood as he had any wish to watch His bridge would stand what
was upon her now but not very much more and if by any of a
thousand chances there happened to be a weakness in the
embankments Mother Gunga would carry his honour to the sea with
the other raffle Worst of all there was nothing to do except
to sit still and Findlayson sat still under his macintosh till
his helmet became pulp on his head and his boots were
overankle in mire He took no count of time for the river was
marking the hours inch by inch and foot by foot along the
embankment and he listened numb and hungry to the straining
of the stoneboats the hollow thunder under the piers and the
hundred noises that make the full note of a flood Once a
dripping servant brought him food but he could not eat and
once he thought that he heard a faint toot from a locomotive
across the river and then he smiled The bridges failure would
hurt his assistant not a little hut Hitchcock was a young man
with his big work yet to do For himself the crash meant
everything  everything that made a hard life worth the living
They would say the men of his own profession    he
remembered the halfpitying things that he himself had said when
Lockharts new waterworks burst and broke down in brickheaps and
sludge and Lockharts spirit broke in him and he died He
remembered what he himself had said when the Sumao Bridge went
out in the big cyclone by the sea and most he remembered poor
Hartopps face three weeks later when the shame had marked it
His bridge was twice the size of Hartopps and it carried the
Findlayson truss as well as the new piershoe  the Findlayson
bolted shoe There were no excuses in his service Government
might listen perhaps but his own kind would judge him by his
bridge as that stood or fell He went over it in his head plate
by plate span by span brick by brick pier by pier
remembering comparing estimating and recalculating lest there
should be any mistake and through the long hours and through the
flights of formulae that danced and wheeled before him a cold
fear would come to pinch his heart His side of the sum was
beyond question but what man knew Mother Gungas arithmetic
Even as he was making all sure by the multiplication table the
river might be scooping a pothole to the very bottom of any one
of those eightyfoot piers that carried his reputation Again a
servant came to him with food but his mouth was dry and he
could only drink and return to the decimals in his brain And
the river was still rising Peroo in a mat shelter coat
crouched at his feet watching now his face and now the face of
the river but saying nothing

At last the Lascar rose and floundered through the mud towards
the village but he was careful to leave an ally to watch the
boats

Presently he returned most irreverently driving before him the
priest of his creed  a fat old man with a grey beard that
whipped the wind with the wet cloth that blew over his shoulder
Never was seen so lamentable a guru

What good are offerings and little kerosene lamps and dry
grain shouted Peroo if squatting in the mud is all that thou
canst do Thou hast dealt long with the Gods when they were
contented and wellwishing Now they are angry Speak to them

What is a man against the wrath of Gods whined the priest
cowering as the wind took him Let me go to the temple and I
will pray there

Son of a pig pray here Is there no return for salt fish and
curry powder and dried onions Call aloud Tell Mother Gunga we
have had enough Bid her be still for the night I cannot pray
but I have been serving in the Kumpanis boats and when men did
not obey my orders I  A flourish of the wirerope colt
rounded the sentence and the priest breaking free from his
disciple fled to the village

Fat pig said Peroo After all that we have done for him When
the flood is down I will see to it that we get a new guru
Finlinson Sahib it darkens for night now and since yesterday
nothing has been eaten Be wise Sahib No man can endure
watching and great thinking on an empty belly Lie down Sahib
The river will do what the river will doThe bridge is mine I
cannot leave it

Wilt thou hold it up with thy hands then said Peroo
laughing I was troubled for my boats and sheers before the
flood came Now we are in the hands of the Gods The Sahib will
not eat and lie down Take these then They are meat and good
toddy together and they kill all weariness besides the fever
that follows the rain I have eaten nothing else today at all

He took a small tin tobaccobox from his sodden waistbelt and
thrust it into Findlaysons hand saying Nay do not be
afraid It is no more than opium  clean Malwa opium

Findlayson shook two or three of the darkbrown pellets into his
hand and hardly knowing what he did swallowed them The stuff
was at least a good guard against fever the fever that was
creeping upon him out of the wet mud and he had seen what Peroo
could do in the stewing mists of autumn on the strength of a dose
from the tin box

Peroo nodded with bright eyes In a little  in a little the
Sahib will find that he thinks well again I too will  He
dived into his treasurebox resettled the raincoat over his
head and squatted down to watch the boats It was too dark now
to see beyond the first pier and the night seemed to have given
the river new strength Findlayson stood with his chin on his
chest thinking There was one point about one of the piers 
the seventh  that he had not fully settled in his mind The
figures would not shape themselves to the eye except one by one
and at enormous intervals of time There was a sound rich and
mellow in his ears like the deepest note of a doublebass  an
entrancing sound upon which he pondered for several hours as it
seemed Then Peroo was at his elbow shouting that a wire hawser
had snapped and the stoneboats were loose Findlayson saw the
fleet open and swing out fanwise to a longdrawn shriek of wire
straining across gunnels

A tree hit them They will all go cried Peroo The main
hawser has parted What does the Sahib do

An immensely complex plan had suddenly flashed into Findlaysons
mind He saw the ropes running from boat to boat in straight
lines and angles  each rope a line of white fire But there was
one rope which was the master rope He could see that rope If
he could pull it once it was absolutely and mathematically
certain that the disordered fleet would reassemble itself in the
backwater behind the guardtower But why he wondered was
Peroo clinging so desperately to his waist as he hastened down
the bank It was necessary to put the Lascar aside gently and
slowly because it was necessary to save the boats and
further to demonstrate the extreme ease of the problem that
looked so difficult And then  but it was of no conceivable
importance  a wirerope raced through his hand burning it
the high bank disappeared and with it all the slowly
dispersing factors of the problem He was sitting in the rainy
darkness  sitting in a boat that spun like a top and Peroo was
standing over him

I had forgotten said the Lascar slowly that to those
fasting and unused the opium is worse than any wine Those who
die in Gunga go to the Gods Still I have no desire to present
myself before such great ones Can the Sahib swim

What need He can fly  fly as swiftly as the wind was the
thick answer

He is mad muttered Peroo under his breath And he threw me
aside like a bundle of dungcakes Well he will not know his
death The boat cannot live an hour here even if she strike
nothing It is not good to look at death with a clear eye

He refreshed himself again from the tin box squatted down in the
bows of the reeling pegged and stitched craft staring through
the mist at the nothing that was there A warm drowsiness crept
over Findlayson the Chief Engineer whose duty was with his
bridge The heavy raindrops struck him with a thousand tingling
little thrills and the weight of all time since time was made
hung heavy on his eyelids He thought and perceived that he was
perfectly secure for the water was so solid that a man could
surely step out upon it and standing still with his legs apart
to keep his balance  this was the most important point  would
be borne with great and easy speed to the shore But yet a better
plan came to him It needed only an exertion of will for the
soul to hurl the body ashore as wind drives paper to waft it
kitefashion to the bank Thereafter  the boat spun dizzily 
suppose the high wind got under the freed body Would it tower
up like a kite and pitch headlong on the faraway sands or would
it duck about beyond control through all eternity Findlayson
gripped the gunnel to anchor himself for it seemed that he was
on the edge of taking the flight before he had settled all his
plans Opium has more effect on the white man than the black
Peroo was only comfortably indifferent to accidents She cannot
live he grunted Her seams open already If she were even a
dinghy with oars we could have ridden it out but a box with
holes is no good Finlinson Sahib she fills

Accha I am going away Come thou also In his mind Findlayson
had already escaped from the boat and was circling high in air
to find a rest for the sole of his foot His body  he was
really sorry for its gross helplessness  lay in the stern the
water rushing about its knees

How very ridiculous he said to himself from his eyrie  that
 is Findlayson  chief of the Kashi Bridge The poor beast is
going to be drowned too Drowned when its close to shore Im
 Im on shore already Why doesnt it come along

To his intense disgust he found his soul back in his body again
and that body spluttering and choking in deep water The pain of
the reunion was atrocious but it was necessary also to fight
for the body He was conscious of grasping wildly at wet sand
and striding prodigiously as one strides in a dream to keep
foothold in the swirling water till at last he hauled himself
clear of the hold of the river and dropped panting on wet
earth

Not this night said Peroo in his ear The Gods have
protected us The Lascar moved his feet cautiously and they
rustled among dried stumps This is some island of last years
indigocrop he went on We shall find no men here but have
great care Sahib all the snakes of a hundred miles have been
flooded out Here comes the lightning on the heels of the
wind Now we shall be able to look but walk carefully

Findlayson was far and far beyond any fear of snakes or indeed
any merely human emotion He saw after he had rubbed the water
from his eyes with an immense clearness and trod so it seemed
to himself with worldencompassing strides Somewhere in the
night of time he had built a bridge  a bridge that spanned
illimitable levels of shining seas but the Deluge had swept it
away leaving this one island under heaven for Findlayson and his
companion sole survivors of the breed of Man

An incessant lightning forked and blue showed all that there
was to be seen on the little patch in the flood  a clump of
thorn a clump of swaying creaking bamboos and a grey gnarled
peepul overshadowing a Hindoo shrine from whose dome floated a
tattered red flag The holy man whose summer restingplace it was
had long since abandoned it and the weather had broken the
reddaubed image of his god The two men stumbled heavylimbed
and heavyeyed over the ashes of a brickset cookingplace and
dropped down under the shelter of the branches while the rain
and river roared together

The stumps of the indigo crackled and there was a smell of
cattle as a huge and dripping Brahminee bull shouldered his way
under the tree The flashes revealed the trident mark of Shiva on
his flank the insolence of head and hump the luminous staglike
eyes the brow crowned with a wreath of sodden marigold blooms
and the silky dewlap that almost swept the ground There was a
noise behind him of other beasts coming up from the floodline
through the thicket a sound of heavy feet and deep breathing

Here be more beside ourselves said Findlayson his head
against the tree pole looking through halfshut eyes wholly at
ease

Truly said Peroo thickly and no small ones

What are they then I do not see clearly

The Gods Who else Look

Ah true The Gods surely  the Gods Findlayson smiled as his
head fell forward on his chest Peroo was eminently right
After the Flood who should be alive in the land except the Gods
that made it  the Gods to whom his village prayed nightly  the
Gods who were in all mens mouths and about all mens ways He
could not raise his head or stir a finger for the trance that
held him and Peroo was smiling vacantly at the lightning

The Bull paused by the shrine his head lowered to the damp
earth A green Parrot in the branches preened his wet wings and
screamed against the thunder as the circle under the tree filled
with the shifting shadows of beasts There was a black Buck at
the Bulls heelssuch a Buck as Findlayson in his faraway life
upon earth might have seen in dreams  a Buck with a royal head
ebon back silver belly and gleaming straight horns Beside
him her head bowed to the ground the green eyes burning under
the heavy brows with restless tail switching the dead grass
paced a Tigress fullbellied and deepjowled

The Bull crouched beside the shrine and there leaped from the
darkness a monstrous grey Ape who seated himself manwise in
the place of the fallen image and the rain spilled like jewels
from the hair of his neck and shouldersOther shadows came and
went behind the circle among them a drunken Man flourishing
staff and drinkingbottle Then a hoarse bellow broke out from
near the ground The flood lessens even now it cried Hour
by hour the water falls and their bridge still stands

My bridge said Findlayson to himself That must be very old
work now What have the Gods to do with my bridge

His eyes rolled in the darkness following the roar A Mugger 
the bluntnosed fordhaunting Mugger of the Ganges draggled
herself before the beasts lashing furiously to right and left
with her tail

They have made it too strong for me In all this night I have
only torn away a handful of planks The walls stand The towers
stand They have chained my flood and the river is not free any
more Heavenly Ones take this yoke away Give me clear water
between bank and bank It is I Mother Gunga that speak The
Justice of the Gods Deal me the Justice of the Gods

What said I whispered Peroo This is in truth a Punchayet of
the Gods Now we know that all the world is dead save you and
I Sahib

The Parrot screamed and fluttered again and the Tigress her
ears flat to her head snarled wickedly

Somewhere in the shadow a great trunk and gleaming tusks swayed
to and fro and a low gurgle broke the silence that followed on
the snarl

We be here said a deep voice the Great Ones One only and
very many Shiv my father is here with Indra Kali has
spoken already Hanuman listens also

Kashi is without her Kotwal tonight shouted the Man with the
drinkingbottle flinging his staff to the ground while the
island rang to the baying of hounds Give her the Justice of
the Gods

Ye were still when they polluted my waters the great Crocodile
bellowed Ye made no sign when my river was trapped between the
walls I had no help save my own strength and that failed  the
strength of Mother Gunga failed  before their guardtowers
What
could I do I have done everything Finish now Heavenly
Ones

I brought the death I rode the spotted sickness from hut to
hut of their workmen and yet they would not cease A
noseslitten hideworn Ass lame scissorlegged and galled
limped forward I cast the death at them out of my nostrils
but they would not cease

Peroo would have moved but the opium lay heavy upon him

 Bah he said spitting Here is Sitala herself Mata  the
smallpox Has the Sahib a handkerchief to put over his face

Little help They fed me the corpses for a month and I flung
them out on my sandbars but their work went forward Demons
they are and sons of demons And ye left Mother Gunga alone for
their firecarriage to make a mock of The Justice of the Gods on
the bridgebuilders

The Bull turned the cud in his mouth and answered slowly If the
Justice of the Gods caught all who made a mock of holy things
there would be many dark altars in the land mother

But this goes beyond a mock said the Tigress darting forward
a griping paw Thou knowest Shiv and ye too Heavenly Ones
ye know that they have defiled Gunga Surely they must come to
the Destroyer Let Indra judge

The Buck made no movement as he answered How long has this
evil been

Three years as men count years said the Mugger close pressed
to the earth

Does Mother Gunga die then in a year that she is so anxious
to see vengeance now The deep sea was where she runs but
yesterday and tomorrow the sea shall cover her again as the
Gods count that which men call time Can any say that this their
bridge endures till tomorrow said the Buck

There was a long hush and in the clearing of the storm the full
moon stood up above the dripping trees

Judge ye then said the River sullenly I have spoken my
shame The flood falls still I can do no more

For my own part   it was the voice of the great Ape seated
within the shrine  it pleases me well to watch these men
remembering that I also builded no small bridge in the worlds
youth

They say too snarled the Tiger that these men came of the
wreck of thy armies Hanuman and therefore thou hast aided 

They toil as my armies toiled in Lanka and they believe that
their toil endures Indra is too high but Shiv thou knowest
how the land is threaded with their firecarriages

Yea I know said the Bull Their Gods instructed them in the
matter

A laugh ran round the circle

Their Gods What should their Gods know They were born
yesterday and those that made them are scarcely yet cold said
the Mugger Tomorrow their Gods will die

Ho said Peroo Mother Gunga talks good talk I told that to
the padresahib who preached on the Mombassa and he asked the
Burra Malum to put me in irons for a great rudeness

Surely they make these things to please their Gods said the
Bull again

Not altogether the Elephant rolled forth It is for the
profit of my mahajuns  my fat moneylenders that worship me at
each new year when they draw my image at the head of the
accountbooks I looking over their shoulders by lamplight
see that the names in the books are those of men in far places 
for all the towns are drawn together by the firecarriage and
the money comes and goes swiftly and the accountbooks grow as
fat as  myself And I who am Ganesh of Good Luck I bless my
peoples

They have changed the face of the landwhich is my land They
have killed and made new towns on my banks said the Mugger

It is but the shifting of a little dirt Let the dirt dig in the
dirt if it pleases the dirt answered the Elephant

But afterwards said the Tiger Afterwards they will see that
Mother Gunga can avenge no insult and they fall away from her
first and later from us all one by one In the end Ganesh we
are left with naked altars

The drunken Man staggered to his feet and hiccupped vehemently

Kali lies My sister lies Also this my stick is the Kotwal of
Kashi and he keeps tally of my pilgrims When the time comes
to worship Bhaironand it is always time  the firecarriages
move one by one and each bears a thousand pilgrims They do
not come afoot any more but rolling upon wheels and my honour
is increased

Gunga I have seen thy bed at Pryag black with the pilgrims
said the Ape leaning forward and but for the firecarriage
they would have come slowly and in fewer numbers Remember

They come to me always Bhairon went on thickly By day and
night they pray to me all the Common People in the fields and
the roads Who is like Bhairon today What talk is this of
changing faiths Is my staff Kotwal of Kashi for nothing He
keeps the tally and he says that never were so many altars as
today and the fire carriage serves them well Bhairon am I 
Bhairon of the Common People and the chiefest of the Heavenly
Ones today Also my staff says 

Peace thou lowed the Bull The worship of the schools is
mine and they talk very wisely asking whether I be one or
many as is the delight of my people and ye know what I am
Kali my wife thou knowest also Yea I know said the
Tigress with lowered head

Greater am I than Gunga also For ye know who moved the minds of
men that they should count Gunga holy among the rivers Who die
in that water  ye know how men say  come to us without
punishment and Gunga knows that the firecarriage has borne to
her scores upon scores of such anxious ones and Kali knows that
she has held her chiefest festivals among the pilgrimages that
are fed by the firecarriage Who smote at Pooree under the
Image there her thousands in a day and a night and bound the
sickness to the wheels of the firecarriages so that it ran from
one end of the land to the other Who but Kali Before the
firecarriage came it was a heavy toil The firecarriages have
served thee well Mother of Death But I speak for mine own
altars who am not Bhairon of the Common Folk but Shiv Men go
to and fro making words and telling talk of strange Gods and I
listen Faith follows faith among my people in the schools and
I have no anger for when all words are said and the new talk is
ended to Shiv men return at the last

True It is true murmured Hanuman To Shiv and to the others
mother they return I creep from temple to temple in the North
where they worship one God and His Prophet and presently my
image is alone within their shrines

Small thanks said the Buck turning his head slowly I am
that One and His Prophet also

Even so father said Hanuman And to the South I go who am
the oldest of the Gods as men know the Gods and presently I
touch the shrines of the New Faith and the Woman whom we know is
hewn twelvearmed and still they call her Mary

Small thanks brother said the Tigress I am that Woman

Even so sister and I go West among the firecarriages and
stand before the bridgebuilders in many shapes and because of
me they change their faiths and are very wise Ho ho I am the
builder of bridges indeed  bridges between this and that and
each bridge leads surely to Us in the end Be content Gunga
Neither these men nor those that follow them mock thee at all

Am I alone then Heavenly Ones Shall I smooth out my flood
lest unhappily I bear away their walls Will Indra dry my
springs in the hills and make me crawl humbly between their
wharfs Shall I bury me in the sand ere I offend

And all for the sake of a little iron bar with the
firecarriage atop Truly Mother Gunga is always young said
Ganesh the Elephant A child had not spoken more foolishly Let
the dirt dig in the dirt ere it return to the dirt I know only
that my people grow rich and praise me Shiv has said that the
men of the schools do not forget Bhairon is content for his
crowd of the Common People and Hanuman laughs

Surely I laugh said the Ape My altars are few beside those
of Ganesh or Bhairon but the firecarriages bring me new
worshippers from beyond the Black Water  the men who believe
that their God is toil I run before them beckoning and they
follow Hanuman

Give them the toil that they desire then said the River
Make a bar across my flood and throw the water back upon the
bridge Once thou wast strong in Lanka Hanuman Stoop and lift
my bed

Who gives life can take life The Ape scratched in the mud with
a long forefinger And yet who would profit by the killing
Very many would die

There came up from the water a snatch of a lovesong such as the
boys sing when they watch their cattle in the noon heats of late
spring The parrot screamed joyously sidling along his branch
with lowered head as the song grew louder and in a patch of
clear moonlight stood revealed the young herd the darling of the
Gopis the idol of dreaming maids and of mothers ere their
children are born Krishna the Wellbeloved He stooped to knot
up his long wet hair and the Parrot fluttered to his shoulder

Fleeting and singing and singing and fleeting hiccupped
Bhairon Those make thee late for the council brother

And then said Krishna with a laugh throwing back his head
Ye can do little without me or Karma here He fondled the
Parrots plumage and laughed again What is this sitting and
talking together I heard Mother Gunga roaring in the dark and
so came quickly from a hut where I lay warm And what have ye
done to Karma that he is so wet and silent And what does
Mother Gunga here Are the heavens full that ye must come
paddling in the mud beastwise Karma what do they do

Gunga has prayed for a vengeance on the bridgebuilders and
Kali is with her Now she bids Hanuman whelm the bridge that
her honour may be made great cried the Parrot I waited here
knowing that thou wouldst come O my master

And the Heavenly Ones said nothing Did Gunga and the Mother of
Sorrows outtalk them Did none speak for my people

Nay said Ganesh moving uneasily from foot to foot I said it
was but dirt at play and why should we stamp it flat

I was content to let them toil well content said Hanuman

What had I to do with Gungas anger said the Bull

I am Bhairon of the Common Folk and this my staff is Kotwal of
all Kashi I spoke for the Common People

Thou The young Gods eyes sparkled

Am I not the first of the Gods in their mouths today returned
Bhairon unabashed For the sake of the Common People I said 
very many wise things which I have now forgotten but this my
staff

Krishna turned impatiently saw the Mugger at his feet and
kneeling slipped an arm round the cold neck Mother he said
gently get thee to thy flood again The matter is not for thee
What harm shall thy honour take of this live dirt Thou hast
given them their fields new year after year and by thy flood
they are made strong They come all to thee at the last What
need to slay them now Have pity mother for a little  and it
is only for a littleIf it be only for a little  the slow
beast began

Are they Gods then Krishna returned with a laugh his eyes
looking into the dull eyes of the River Be certain that it is
only for a little The Heavenly Ones have heard thee and
presently justice will be done Go now mother to the flood
again Men and cattle are thick on the waters  the banks fall 
the villages melt because of thee

But the bridge  the bridge stands The Mugger turned grunting
into the undergrowth as Krishna rose

It is ended said the Tigress viciously There is no more
justice from the Heavenly Ones Ye have made shame and sport of
Gunga who asked no more than a few score lives

Of my people  who lie under the leafroofs of the village
yonder  of the young girls and the young men who sing to them
in the dark of the child that will be born next morn  of that
which was begotten tonight said Krishna And when all is
done what profit Tomorrow sees them at work Ay if ye swept
the bridge out from end to end they would begin anew Hear me
Bhairon is drunk always Hanuman mocks his people with new
riddles

Nay but they are very old ones the Ape said laughing

Shiv hears the talk of the schools and the dreams of the holy
men Ganesh thinks only of his fat traders but I  I live with
these my people asking for no gifts and so receiving them
hourly

And very tender art thou of thy people said the Tigress

They are my own The old women dream of me turning in their
sleep the maids look and listen for me when they go to fill
their lotahs by the river I walk by the young men waiting
without the gates at dusk and I call over my shoulder to the
whitebeards Ye know Heavenly Ones that I alone of us all
walk upon the earth continually and have no pleasure in our
heavens so long as a green blade springs here or there are two
voices at twilight in the standing crops Wise are ye but ye
live far off forgetting whence ye came So do I not forget
And the firecarriage feeds your shrines ye say And the
firecarriages bring a thousand pilgrims where but ten came in
the old years True That is true today

But tomorrow they are dead brother said Ganesh

Peace said the Bull as Hanuman leaned forward again And
tomorrow beloved  what of tomorrow

This only A new word creeping from mouth to mouth among the
Common Folk  a word that neither man nor God can lay hold of 
an evil word  a little lazy word among the Common Folk saying
and none know who set that word afoot that they weary of ye
Heavenly Ones

The Gods laughed together softly And then beloved  they
said

And to cover that weariness they my people will bring to thee
Shiv and to thee Ganesh at first greater offerings and a
louder noise of worship But the word has gone abroad and
after they will pay fewer dues to your fat Brahmins Next they
will forget your altars but so slowly that no man can say how
his forgetfulness began

I knew  I knew I spoke this also but they would not hear
said the Tigress We should have slainwe should have slain

It is too late now Ye should have slain at the beginning when
the men from across the water had taught our folk nothing Now
my people see their work and go away thinking They do not
think of the Heavenly Ones altogether They think of the
firecarriage and the other things that the bridgebuilders have
done and when your priests thrust forward hands asking alms
they give a little unwillingly That is the beginning among one
or two or five or ten  for I moving among my people know what
is in their hearts

And the end Jester of the Gods What shall the end be said
Ganesh

The end shall be as it was in the beginning O slothful son of
Shiv The flame shall die upon the altars and the prayer upon
the tongue till ye become little Gods again  Gods of the jungle
names that the hunters of rats and noosers of dogs whisper in
the thicket and among the caves ragGods pot Godlings of the
tree and the villagemark as ye were at the beginning That is
the end Ganesh for thee and for Bhairon  Bhairon of the
Common People

It is very far away grunted Bhairon Also it is a lie

Many women have kissed Krishna They told him this to cheer
their own hearts when the grey hairs came and he has told us
the tale said the Bull below his breath

Their Gods came and we changed them I took the Woman and made
her twelvearmed So shall we twist all their Gods said
Hanuman

Their Gods This is no question of their Gods  one or three 
man or woman The matter is with the people  move and not
the Gods of the bridgebuilders said Krishna

So be it I have made a man worship the firecarriage as it
stood still breathing smoke and he knew not that he worshipped
me said Hanuman the Ape They will only change a little the
names of their Gods I shall lead the builders of the bridges as
of old Shiv shall be worshipped in the schools by such as doubt
and despise their fellows Ganesh shall have his mahajuns and
Bhairon the donkeydrivers the pilgrims and the sellers of
toys Beloved they will do no more than change the names and
that we have seen a thousand times

Surely they will do no more than change the names echoed
Ganesh but there was an uneasy movement among the Gods

They will change more than the names Me alone they cannot kill
so long as a maiden and a man meet together or the spring
follows the winter rains Heavenly Ones not for nothing have I
walked upon the earth My people know not now what they know
but I who live with them I read their hearts Great Kings the
beginning of the end is born already The firecarriages shout
the names of new Gods that are not the old under new names
Drink now and eat greatly Bathe your faces in the smoke of the
altars before they grow cold Take dues and listen to the
cymbals and the drums Heavenly Ones while yet there are
flowers and songs As men count time the end is far off but as
we who know reckon it is today I have spoken

The young God ceased and his brethren looked at each other long
in silence

This I have not heard before Peroo whispered in his
companions ear And yet sometimes when I oiled the brasses in
the engineroom of the Goorkha I have wondered if our priests
were so wise  so wise The day is coming Sahib They will be
gone by the morning

A yellow light broadened in the sky and the tone of the river
changed as the darkness withdrew

Suddenly the Elephant trumpeted aloud as though man had goaded
him

Let Indra judge Father of all speak thou What of the things
we have heard Has Krishna lied indeed Or 

Ye know said the Buck rising to his feet Ye know the Riddle
of the Gods When Brahm ceases to dream the Heavens and the
Hells and Earth disappear Be content Brahm dreams still The
dreams come and go and the nature of the dreams changes but
still Brahm dreams Krishna has walked too long upon earth and
yet I love him the more for the tale he has told The Gods
change beloved  all save One

Ay all save one that makes love in the hearts of men said
Krishna knotting his girdle It is but a little time to wait
and ye shall know if I lieTruly it is but a little time as
thou sayest and we shall know Get thee to thy huts again
beloved and make sport for the young things for still Brahm
dreams Go my children Brahm dreams and till he wakes the
Gods die not

Whither went they  said the Lascar awestruck shivering a
little with the cold

God knows said Findlayson The river and the island lay in
full daylight now and there was never mark of hoof or pug on
the wet earth under the peepul Only a parrot screamed in the
branches bringing down showers of waterdrops as he fluttered
his wings

Up We are cramped with cold Has the opium died out Canst
thou move Sahib

Findlayson staggered to his feet and shook himself His bead swam
and ached but the work of the opium was over and as he
sluiced his forehead in a pool the Chief Engineer of the Kashi
Bridge was wondering how he had managed to fall upon the island
what chances the day offered of return and above all how his
work stood

Peroo I have forgotten much I was under the guardtower
watching the river and then  Did the flood sweep us away

No The boats broke loose Sahib and if the Sahib had
forgotten about the opium decidedly Peroo would not remind him
in striving to retie them so it seemed to me but it was dark 
a rope caught the Sahib and threw him upon a boat Considering
that we two with Hitchcock Sahib built as it were that
bridge I came also upon the boat which came riding on
horseback as it were on the nose of this island and so
splitting cast us ashore I made a great cry when the boat left
the wharf and without doubt Hitchcock Sahib will come for us As
for the bridge so many have died in the building that it cannot
fallA fierce sun that drew out all the smell of the sodden
land had followed the storm and in that clear light there was
no room for a man to think of the dreams of the dark Findlayson
stared upstream across the blaze of moving water till his eyes
ached There was no sign of any bank to the Ganges much less of
a bridgeline

We came down far he said It was wonderful that we were not
drowned a hundred times

That was the least of the wonder for no man dies before his
time I have seen Sydney I have seen London and twenty great
ports but  Peroo looked at the damp discoloured shrine under
the peepul  never man has seen that we saw here

What

Has the Sahib forgotten or do we black men only see the Gods

There was a fever upon me Findlayson was still looking
uneasily across the water It seemed that the island was full
of beasts and men talking but I do not remember A boat could
live in this water now I think

Oho Then it is true When Brahm ceases to dream the Gods
die Now I know indeed what he meant Once too the guru
said as much to me but then I did not understand Now I am
wise

What said Findlayson over his shoulder

Peroo went on as if he were talking to himself Six  seven  ten
monsoons since I was watch on the focsle of the Rewah  the
Kumpanis big boat  and there was a big tufan green and black
water beating and I held fast to the lifelines choking under
the waters Then I thought of the Gods  of Those whom we saw
tonight  he stared curiously at Findlaysons back but the
white man was looking across the flood Yes I say of Those
whom we saw this night past and I called upon Them to protect
me And while I prayed still keeping my lookout a big wave
came and threw me forward upon the ring of the great black
bowanchor and the Rewah rose high and high leaning towards
the lefthand side and the water drew away from beneath her
nose and I lay upon my belly holding the ring and looking
down into those great deeps Then I thought even in the face of
death If I lose hold I die and for me neither the Rewah nor my
place by the galley where the rice is cooked nor Bombay nor
Calcuttanor even London will be any more for me How shall I
be sure I said that the Gods to whom I pray will abide at
all This I thought and the Rewah dropped her nose as a hammer
falls and all the sea came in and slid me backwards along the
focsle and over the break of the focsle and I very badly
bruised my shin against the donkeyengine but I did not die
and I have seen the Gods They are good for live men but for
the dead     They have spoken Themselves Therefore when I
come to the village I will beat the guru for talking riddles
which are no riddles When Brahm ceases to dream the Gods go

Look upstream The light blinds Is there smoke yonder

Peroo shaded his eyes with his hands He is a wise man and
quick Hitchcock Sahib would not trust a rowboat He has
borrowed the Rao Sahibs steamlaunch and comes to look for us
I have always said that there should have been a steamlaunch on
the bridge works for us

The territory of the Rao of Baraon lay within ten miles of the
bridge and Findlayson and Hitchcock had spent a fair portion of
their scanty leisure in playing billiards and shooting blackbuck
with the young man He had been bearled by an English tutor of
sporting tastes for some five or six years and was now royally
wasting the revenues accumulated during his minority by the
Indian
Government His steamlaunch with its silverplated rails
striped silk awning and mahogany decks was a new toy which
Findlayson had found horribly in the way when the Rao came to
look at the bridge works

Its great luck murmured Findlayson but he was none the less
afraid wondering what news might be of the bridge

The gaudy blueandwhite funnel came downstream swiftly They
could see Hitchcock in the bows with a pair of operaglasses
and his face was unusually white Then Peroo hailed and the
launch made for the tail of the island The Rao Sahib in tweed
shootingsuit and a sevenhued turban waved his royal hand and
Hitchcock shouted But he need have asked no questions for
Findlaysons first demand was for his bridge

All serene Gad I never expected to see you again Findlayson
Youre seven koss downstream Yes theres not a stone shifted
anywhere but how are you I borrowed the Rao Sahibs launch
and he was good enough to come along Jump inAh Finlinson
you are very well eh That was most unprecedented calamity last
night eh My royal palace too it leaks like the devil and
the crops will also be short all about my country Now you shall
back her out Hitchcock I  I do not understand steamengines
You are wet You are cold Finlinson I have some things to eat
here and you will take a good drink

Im immensely grateful Rao Sahib I believe youve saved my
life How did Hitchcock 

Oho His hair was upon end He rode to me in the middle of the
night and woke me up in the arms of Morpheus I was most truly
concerned Finlinson so I came too My headpriest he is very
angry just now We will go quick Mister Hitchcock I am due to
attend at twelve fortyfive in the state temple where we
sanctify some new idol If not so I would have asked you to
spend the day with me They are dambore these religious
ceremonies Finlinson eh

Peroo well known to the crew had possessed himself of the
inlaid wheel and was taking the launch craftily upstream But
while he steered he was in his mind handling two feet of
partially untwisted wirerope and the back upon which he beat
was the back of his guru

End of THE BRIDGEBUILDERS



A WALKING DELEGATE

ACCORDING to the custom of Vermont Sunday afternoon is
saltingtime on the farm and unless something very important
happens we attend to the salting ourselves Dave and Pete the
red oxen are treated first they stay in the home meadow ready
for work on Monday Then come the cows with Pan the calf who
should have been turned into veal long ago but survived on
account of his manners and lastly the horses scattered through
the seventy acres of the Back Pasture

You must go down by the brook that feeds the clicking bubbling
waterram up through the sugarbush where the young maple
undergrowth closes round you like a shallow sea next follow the
faint line of an old countyroad running past two green hollows
fringed with wild rose that mark the cellars of two ruined
houses then by Lost Orchard where nobody ever comes except in
cidertime then across another brook and so into the Back
Pasture Half of it is pine and hemlock and Spruce with sumach
and little juniper bushes and the other half is grey rock and
boulder and moss with green streaks of brake and swamp but the
horses like it well enough  our own and the others that are
turned down there to feed at fifty cents a week Most people
walk to the Back Pasture and find it very rough work but one
can get there in a buggy if the horse knows what is expected of
him The safest conveyance is our coupe This began life as a
buckboard and we bought it for five dollars from a sorrowful man
who had no other sort of possessions and the seat came off one
night when we were turning a corner in a hurry After that
alteration it made a beautiful saltingmachine if you held
tight because there was nothing to catch your feet when you fell
out and the slats rattled tunes

One Sunday afternoon we went out with the salt as usual It was
a broiling hot day and we could not find the horses anywhere
till we let Tedda Gabler the bobtailed mare who throws up the
dirt with her big hooves exactly as a tedder throws hay have
her head Clever as she is she tipped the coupe over in a
hidden brook before she came out on a ledge of rock where all
the horses had gathered and were switching flies The Deacon
was the first to call to her He is a very dark irongrey
fouryearold son of Grandee He has been handled since he was
two was driven in a light cart before he was three and now
ranksas an absolutely steady ladys horse  proof against
steamrollers gradecrossings and street processions

Salt said the Deacon joyfully Youre dreffle late Tedda

Any  any place to cramp the coupe Tedda panted It weighs
turrble this weather Id a come sooner but they didnt know
what they wanted  ner haow Fell out twice both of em I
dont understand sech foolishness

You look considerble het up Guess youd better cramp her
under them pines an cool off a piece

Tedda scrambled on the ledge and cramped the coupe in the shade
of a tiny little wood of pines while my companion and I lay
down among the brown silky needles and gasped All the home
horses were gathered round us enjoying their Sunday leisure

There were Rod and Rick the seniors on the farm They were the
regular roadpair bay with black points full brothers aged
sons of a Hambletonian sire and a Morgan dam There were Nip
and Tuck sealbrowns rising six brother and sister Black
Hawks by birth perfectly matched just finishing their
education and as handsome a pair as man could wish to find in a
fortymile drive There was Muldoon our excarhorse bought at
a venture and any colour you choose that is not white and
Tweezy who comes from Kentucky with an affliction of his left
hip which makes him a little uncertain how his hind legs are
moving He and Muldoon had been hauling gravel all the week for
our new road The Deacon you know already Last of all and
eating something was our faithful Marcus Aurelius Antoninus the
black buggyhorse who had seen us through every state of weather
and road the horse who was always standing in harness before
some door or other  a philosopher with the appetite of a shark
and the manners of an archbishop Tedda Gabler was a new
tradewith a reputation for vice which was really the result of
bad driving She had one working gait which she could hold till
further notice a Roman nose a large prominent eye a
shavingbrush of a tail and an irritable temper She took her
salt through her bridle but the others trotted up nuzzling and
wickering for theirs till we emptied it on the clean rocks
They were all standing at ease on three legs for the most part
talking the ordinary gossip of the Back Pasture  about the
scarcity of water and gaps in the fence and how the early
windfalls tasted that season  when little Rick blew the last few
grains of his allowance into a crevice and said

Hurry boys Might ha knowed that livery plug would be
around

We heard a clatter of hooves and there climbed up from the
ravine below a fiftycenter transienta walleyed yellow
framehouse of a horse sent up to board from a liverystable in
town where they called him The Lamb and never let him out
except at night and to strangers My companion who knew and had
broken most of the horses looked at the ragged hammerhead as it
rose and said quietly

Niice beast Maneater if he gets the chance  see his eye
Kicker too  see his hocks Western horse

The animal lumbered up snuffling and grunting His feet showed
that he had not worked for weeks and weeks and our creatures
drew together significantly

As usual he said with an underhung sneerbowin your heads
before the Oppressor that comes to spend his leisure gloatin
over you

Mines done said the Deacon he licked up the remnant of his
salt dropped his nose in his masters hand and sang a little
grace all to himself The Deacon has the most enchanting
manners of any one I know

An fawnin on them for what is your inalienable right Its
humiliatin said the yellow horse sniffing to see if he could
find a few spare grains

Go daown hill then Boney the Deacon replied Guess youll
find somethin to eat still if yer haint hogged it all Youve
ett moren any three of us today  an day fore that  an the
last two months  sence youve been here

I am not addressin myself to the young an immature I am
speakin to those whose opinion an experience commands
respect

I saw Rod raise his head as though he were about to make a
remark then he dropped it again and stood threecornered like
a ploughhorse Rod can cover his mile in a shade under three
minutes on an ordinary road to an ordinary buggy He is
tremendously powerful behind but like most Hambletonians he
grows a trifle sullen as he gets older No one can love Rod
very much but no one can help respecting him

I wish to wake those the yellow horse went on to an abidin
sense o their wrongs an their injuries an their outrages

Haows that said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus dreamily He
thought Boney was talking of some kind of feed

An when I say outrages and injuries  Boney waved his tail
furiously I mean em too Great Oats Thats just what I do
mean plain an straight

The gentleman talks quite earnest said Tuck the mare to Nip
her brotherTheres no doubt thinkin broadens the horizons o
the mind His language is quite lofty

Hesh sis Nip answered He haint widened nothin cep the
circle hes ett in pasture They feed words fer beddin where he
comes from

Its elegant talkin though Tuck returned with an
unconvinced toss of her pretty lean little head

The yellow horse heard her and struck an attitude which he meant
to be extremely impressive It made him look as though he had
been badly stuffed

Now I ask you I ask you without prejudice an without
favourwhat has Man the Oppressor ever done for you  Are you
not inalienably entitled to the free air O heaven blowin
acrost this boundless prairie

Hev ye ever wintered here said the Deacon merrily while the
others snickered Its kinder cool

Not yet said Boney I come from the boundless confines o
Kansas where the noblest of our kind have their abidinplace
among the sunflowers on the threshold o the settin sun in his
glory

An they sent you ahead as a sample  said Rick with an amused
quiver of his long beautifully groomed tail as thick and as
fine and as wavy as a quadroons back hair

Kansas sir needs no advertisement Her native sons rely on
themselves an their native sires Yes sir

Then Tweezy lifted up his wise and polite old head His
affliction makes him bashful as a rule but he is ever the most
courteous of horses

Excuse me suh he said slowly but unless I have been
misinfohmed most of your prominent siahs suh are impoted
from Kentucky an Im from Paduky

There was the least little touch of pride in the last words

Any horse dat knows beans said Muldoon suddenly he had been
standing with his hairy chin on Tweezys broad quarters gits
outer Kansas fore dey crip his shoes I blew in dere from
Ioway in de days o me youth an innocence an I wuz grateful
when dey boxed me fer N York You cant tell me anything about
Kansas I dont wanter fergit De Belt Line stables aint no
Hoffman House but deyre Vanderbilts longside  Kansas

What the horses o Kansas think today the horses of America
will think tomorrow an I tell you that when the horses of
America rise in their might the day o the Oppressor is ended

There was a pause till Rick said with a little grunt

Ef you put it that way every one of us has riz in his might
cep Marcus mebbe Marky j ever rise in yer might

Nope said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus thoughtfully quidding
over a mouthful of grass I seen a heap o fools try though

You admit that you riz  said the Kansas horse excitedly
Then why  why in Kansas did you ever go under again

Horse cant walk on his hind legs all the time said the
Deacon

Not when hes jerked over on his back fore he knows what
fetched him Weve all done it Boney said Rick Nip an Tuck
they tried it spite o what the Deacon told em an the Deacon
he tried it spite o what me an Rod told him an me an Rod
tried it spite o what Grandee told us an I guess Grandee he
tried it spite Oo what his dam told him Its the same old
circus from generation to generation Colt cant see why hes
called on to back Same old rearm on end  straight up Same old
feelin that youve bested em this time Same old little yank at
your mouth when youre up good an tall Same old Pegasusact
wonderin where youll light Same old wop when you hit the dirt
with your head where your tail should be and your inards shook
up like a branmash Same old voice in your ear Waal ye little
fool an what did you reckon to make by that Were through
with risin in our might on this farm We go to pole er single
accordin ez were hitched

An Man the Oppressor sets an gloats over you same as hes
settin now Haint that been your experience madam

This last remark was addressed to Tedda and any one could see
with half an eye that poor old anxious fidgety Tedda stamping
at the flies must have left a wild and tumultuous youth behind
her

Pends on the man she answered shifting from one foot to the
other and addressing herself to the home horses They abused
me dreffle when I was young I guess I was sperrity an nervous
some but they didnt allow for thatTwas in Monroe County Noo
York an sence then till I come here Ive run away with more
men than ud fill a boardinhouse Why the man that sold me
here he says to the boss s he Mind now Ive warned you
Twont be none of my fault if she sheds you daown the road
Dont you drive her in a topbuggy ner thout winkers s he
ner thought this bit ef you look to come home behind her N
the fust thing the boss did was to git the topbuggy

Cant say as I like topbuggies said Rick they dont balance
good

Suit me to a haar said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Topbuggy
means the babys in behind an I kin stop while she gathers the
pretty flowers  yes an pick a maouthful too The womenfolk
all say I hev to be humoured an I dont kerry things to the
sweatinpoint

Course Ive no prejudice against a topbuggy s long s I can
see it Tedda went on quickly Its hafseein the pesky
thing bobbin an balancn behind the winkers gits on my nerves
Then the boss looked at the bit theyd sold with me an s he
Jiminy Christmas This ud make a clotheshorse Stan n end
Then he gave me a plain bar bit an fitted it s if there was
some feelin to my maouth

Haint ye got any Miss Tedda said Tuck who has a mouth like
velvet and knows it

Might a had Miss Tuck but Ive forgot Then he give me an
open bridle my styles an open bridle  an  I dunno as I
ought to tell this by rights he give  me  a kiss

My said Tuck I cant tell fer the shoes o me what makes
some men so fresh

Pshaw sis said Nip whats the sense in actin so You git a
kiss reglar s hitchinup time

Well you neednt tell smarty said Tuck with a squeal and a
kick

Id heard o kisses o course Tedda went on but they hadnt
come my way specially I dont mind tellin I was that took
aback at that mans doins he might ha lit firecrackers on my
saddle Then we went out jest s if a kiss was nothin an I
wasnt three strides into my gait fore I felt the boss knoo his
business an was trustin me So I studied to please him an
whenever took the whip from the dash  a whip drives me plumb
distracted  an the upshot was that  waal Ive come up the
Back Pasture today an the coupes tipped clear over twice an
Ive waited till twuz fixed each time You kin judge for
yourselves I dont set up to be no better than my neighbours
specially with my tail snipped off the way tis but I want you
all to know Teddas quit fightin in harness or out of it cep
when theres a born fool in the pasture stuffin his stummick
with board that aint rightly hisn cause he haint earned it

Meanin me madam said the yellow horse

 Ef the shoe fits clinch it said Tedda snorting I named no
names though to be sure some folks are mean enough an greedy
enough to do thout em

Theres a deal to be forgiven to ignorance said the yellow
horse with an ugly look in his blue eye

Seeminly yes or some folks ud ha been kicked raound the
pasture bout onct a minute sence they came  board er no
board

But what you do not understand if you will excuse me madam is
that the whole principle o servitood which includes keep an
feed starts from a radically false basis an I am proud to say
that me an the majority o the horses o Kansas think the
entire concern should be relegated to the limbo of exploded
superstitions I say were too progressive for that I say were
too enlightened for that Twas good enough s long s we didnt
think but naow  but naow  a new loominary has arisen on the
horizon

Meanin you said the Deacon

The horses o Kansas are behind me with their multitoodinous
thunderin hooves an we say simply but grandly that we take
our stand with all four feet on the inalienable rights of the
horse pure and simple the hightoned child o nature fed by
the same wavin grass cooled by the same ripplin brook yes
an warmed by the same genrous sun as falls impartially on the
outside an the inside of the pampered machine o the
trottintrack or the bloated coupehorses o these yere
Eastern cities Are we not the same flesh an blood

Not by a bushel an a half said the Deacon under his breath
Grandee never was in Kansas

My Aint that elegant though abaout the wavin grass an the
ripplin brooks Tuck whispered in Nips ear The gentlemans
real convincin I think

I say we are the same flesh an blood Are we to be separated
horse from horse by the artificial barriers of a
trottinrecord or are we to look down upon each other on the
strength o the gifts o nature  an extry inch below the knee
or slightly more powerful quarters Whats the use o them
advantages to you Man the Oppressor comes along an sees
youre likely an goodlookin an grinds you to the face o
the earth What for For his own pleasure for his own
convenience Young an old black an bay white an grey
theres no distinctions made between us Were ground up
together under the remorseless teeth o the engines of
oppression 

Guess his breechin must ha broke goin daownhill said the
Deacon Slippery road maybe an the buggy come onter him an
he didnt know nough to hold back That dont feel like teeth
though Maybe he busted a shaft an it pricked him

An I come to you from Kansas wavin the tail o friendship to
all an sundry an in the name of the uncounted millions o
pureminded hightoned horses now strugglin towards the light
o freedom I say to you Rub noses with us in our sacred an
holy cause The power is yourn Without you I say Man the
Oppressor cannot move himself from place to place Without you
he cannot reap he cannot sow he cannot plough

Mighty odd place Kansas said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus
Seeminly they reap in the spring an plough in the fall
Guess its right fer them but twould make me kinder giddy

The producs of your untirin industry would rot on the ground
if you did not weakly consent to help him Let em rot I say
Let him call you to the stables in vain an nevermore Let him
shake his ensnarin oats under your nose in vain Let the
Brahmas roost in the buggy an the rats run riot round the
reaper Let him walk on his two hind feet till they blame well
drop off Win no more souldestroyn races for his pleasure
Then an not till then will Man the Oppressor know where hes
at Quit workin fellowsufferers an slaves Kick Rear
Plunge Lie down on the shafts an woller Smash an destroy
The conflict will be but short an the victory is certain
After that we can press our inalienable rights to eight quarts
o oats a day two good blankets an a flynet an the best o
stablin

The yellow horse shut his yellow teeth with a triumphant snap
and Tuck said With a sigh Seemss if somethin ought to be
done Dont seem right somehow oppressin us an all to my
way o thinkin

Said Muldoon in a faraway and sleepy voice

Who in Vermonts goin to haul de inalienable oats Dey weigh
like Sam Hill an sixty bushel at dat allowance aint goin to
last tree weeks here An deres de winter hay for five
monts

We can settle those minor details when the great cause is won
said the yellow horse Let us return simply but grandly to our
inalienable rights  the right o freedom on these yere verdant
hills an no invijjus distinctions o track an pedigree

What in stables jer call an invijjus distinction said the
Deacon stiffly

Fer one thing bein a bloated pampered trotter jest because
you happen to be raised that way an couldnt no more help
trottin than eatin

Do ye know anythin about trotters said the Deacon

Ive seen em trot That was enough for me I dont want to know
any more Trottin s immoral

Waal Ill tell you this much They dont bloat an they dont
pamp  much I dont hold out to be no trotter myself though I
am free to say I had hopes that way  onct But I do say fer
Ive seen em trained that a trotter dont trot with his feet
he trots with his head an he does more work  ef you know what
that is  in a week than you er your sire ever done in all your
lives Hes everlastingly at it a trotter is an when he
isnt hes studyin haow You seen em trot Much you hev You
was hitched to a rail back o the stand in a buckboard with a
soapbox nailed on the slats an a frowzy bufflo atop while
your man peddled rum fer lemonade to little boys as thought they
was actin manly till you was both run off the track an jailed
you intoed shufflin swaybacked windsuckin skate you

Dont get het up Deacon said Tweezy quietly Now suh
would you consider a foxtrot an singlefoot an rack an
pace an amble distinctions not worth distinguishin I assuah
you gentlemen there was a time befo I was afflicted in my hip
if youll pardon me Miss Tuck when I was quite celebrated in
Paduky for all those gaits an in my opinion the Deacons corect
when he says that a hose of any position in society gets his
gaits by his haid an not by  his ah limbs Miss Tuck I
reckon Im very little good now but Im rememberin the things I
used to do befo I took to transpotin real estate with the help
an assistance of this gentleman here He looked at Muldoon

Invijjus arterficial hind legs  said the excarhorse with a
grunt of contempt On de Belt Line we dont reckon no horse
wuth his keep less he kin switch de car off de track run her
round on de cobbles an dump her in agin ahead o de truck
whats blockin him Dere is a way o swingin yer quarters when
de driver says Yank her out boys dat takes a year to learn
Onct yer git onter it youse kin yank a cablecar outer a
manhole I dont advertise myself for no circushorse but I
knew dat trick better than most an dey was good to me in de
stables fer I saved time on de Belt  an times what dey hunt
in N York

But the simple child o nature the yellow horse began

Oh go an unscrew yer splints Youre talkin through yer
bandages said Muldoon with a horselaugh Dere aint no
loosebox for de simple child o nature on de Belt Line wid de
Paris comin in an de Teutonic goin out an de trucks an de
coupes sayin things an de heavy freight movin down fer de
Boston boat bout tree oclock of an August afternoon in de
middle of a hot wave when de fat Kanucks an Western horses
drops dead on de block De simple child o nature had better
chase himself inter de water Every man at de end of his lines
is mad or loaded or silly an de cops madder an loadeder an
sillier than de rest Dey all take it outer de horses Deres no
wavin brooks ner ripplin grass on de Belt Line Run her out on
de cobbles wid de sparks flyin an stop when de cop slugs you
on de bone o yer nose Dats NYork see

I was always told sciety in Noo York was dreffle refined an
hightoned said Tuck Were lookin to go there one o these
days Nip an me

Oh you wont see no Belt business where youll go miss De man
dat wants youll want bad an hell summer you on Long Island
er at Newport wid a winkypinky silver harness an an English
coachman Youll make a starhitch you an yer brother miss
But I guess you wont have no nice smooth bar bit Dey checks
em an dey bangs deir tails an dey bits em de city folk
an dey says its English ye know an dey darsent cut a horse
loose case o de cops N Yorks no place fer a horse less
hes on de Belt an can go round wid de boys Wisht I was in de
Fire Department

But did you never stop to consider the degradin servitood of it
all said the yellow horse

You dont stop on de Belt cully Youre stopped An we was
all in de servitood business man an horse an Jimmy dat sold
de papers Guess de passengers werent out to grass neither by
de way dey acted I done my turn an Im none o Barnums
crowd but any horse dats worked on de Belt four years dont
train wid no simple child o nature  not by de whole length o
N York

But can it be possible that with your experience and at your
time of life you do not believe that all horses are free and
equal said the yellow horseNot till theyre dead Muldoon
answered quietly An den it depends on de gross total o
buttons an mucilage dey gits outer youse at Barren Island

They tell me youre a prominent philosopher The yellow horse
turned to Marcus Can you deny a basic and pivotal statement
such as this

I dont deny anythin said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus
cautiously but ef you ast me I should say twuz more
different sorts o clipped oats of a lie than anythin Ive had
my teeth into sence I wuz foaled

Are you a horse said the yellow horse

Them that knows me best low I am

Aint I a horse

Yep one kind ofThen aint you an me equal

How fer kin you go in a day to a loaded buggy drawin five
hundred pounds Marcus asked carelessly

That has nothing to do with the case the yellow horse answered
excitedly

Theres nothing I know hez more to do with the case Marcus
replied

Kin ye yank a full car outer de tracks ten times in de mornin
said Muldoon

Kin ye go to Keene  fortytwo mile in an afternoon  with a
mate said Rick an turn out bright an early next mornin

Was there evah any time in your careah suh  I am not referrin
to the present circumstances but our mutual glorious past 
when you could carry a pretty girl to market hahnsome an let
her knit all the way on account o the smoothness o the
motion said Tweezy

Kin you keep your feet through the West River Bridge with the
narrergage comin in on one side an the Montreal flyer the
other an the old bridge teeterin between said the Deacon
Kin you put your nose down on the cowcatcher of a locomotive
when youre waitin at the depot an let em play Curfew shall
not ring tonight with the big brass bell

Kin you hold back when the brichin breaks Kin you stop fer
orders when your nigh hind legs over your trace an ye feel
good of a frosty mornin said Nip who had only learned that
trick last winter and thought it was the crown of horsely
knowledge

Whats the use o talk in said Tedda Gabler scornfully
What kin ye do

I rely on my simple rights  the inalienable rights o my
unfettered horsehood An I am proud to say I have never since
my first shoes lowered myself to obeyin the will o man

Must ha had a heap o whips broke over yer yaller back said
Tedda Hev ye found it paid any

Sorrer has been my portion since the day I was foaled Blows
an boots an whips an insults  injury outrage an
oppression I would not endoor the degradin badges o servitood
that connect us with the buggy an the farmwagon

Its amazin difficult to draw a buggy thout traces er collar
er breaststrap er somefin said Marcus A Powermachine for
sawin wood is most the only thing theres no straps to Ive
helped saw s much as three cord in an afternoon in a
Powermachine Slep too most o the time I did but taint
half as interestin ez goin daowntaown in the Concord

Concord dont hender you goin to sleep any said Nip My
throatlash Dyou remember when you lay down in the sharves
last week waitin at the piazza

Pshaw That didnt hurt the sharves They wuz good an wide an
I lay down keerful The folks kep me hitched up nigh an hour
fore they started an larfed  why they all but lay down
themselves with larfin Say Boney if youve got to be hitched
to anything that goes on wheels youve got to be hitched with
somefin

Go an jine a circus said Muldoon an walk on your hind
legs All de horses dat knows too much to work he pronounced it
woik New York fashion jine de circus

I am not sayin anythin again work said the yellow horse
work is the finest thing in the world

Seems too fine fer some of us Tedda snorted

I only ask that each horse should work for himself an enjoy
the profit of his labours Let him work intelligently an not
as a machine

There aint no horse that works like a machine Marcus began

Theres no way o workin that doesnt mean goin to pole er
single  they never put me in the Powermachine  er under
saddle said Rick

Oh shucks Were talkin same ez we graze said Nip raound
an raound in circles Rod we haint heard from you yet an
youve more knowhow than any span here

Rod the offhorse of the pair had been standing with one hip
lifted like a tired cow and you could only tell by the quick
flutter of the haw across his eye from time to time that he
was paying any attention to the argument He thrust his jaw out
sidewise as his habit is when he pulls and changed his leg
His voice was hard and heavy and his ears were close to his
big plain Hambletonian head

How old are you he said to the yellow horse

Nigh thirteen I guess

Mean age ugly age Im gettin that way myself How long hev ye
been pawin this firefanged stablelitter

If you mean my principles Ive held em sence I was three

Mean age ugly age teeth give heaps o trouble then Set a
colt to actin crazy fer a while Youve kep it up seeminly
Dye talk much to your neighbours fer a steady thing

I uphold the principles o the Cause wherever I am pastured

Done a heap o good I guess

I am proud to say I have taught a few of my companions the
principles o freedom an liberty

Meanin they ran away er kicked when they got the chanst

I was talkin in the abstrac an not in the concrete My
teachins educated them

What a horse specially a young horse hears in the abstrac
hes liable to do in the Concord You was handled late I
presoom

Four risin five

Thats where the trouble began Driv by a woman like ez not 
eh

Not fer long said the yellow horse with a snap of his teeth

Spilled her

I heerd she never drove again

Any childern

Buckboards full of em

Men too

I have shed consideble men in my time

By kickin

Any way that come along Fallin back over the dash is as handy
as most

They must be turrble afraid o you daowntaown

Theyve sent me here to get rid o me I guess they spend their
time talkin over my campaignsI wanter know

Yes sir Now all you gentlemen have asked me what I can do
Ill just show you See them two fellers lyin down by the
buggy

Yep one of em owns me Tother broke me said Rod

Get em out here in the open an Ill show you something Lemme
hide back o you peoples so s they wont see what Im at

Meanin ter kill em Rod drawled There was a shudder of
horror through the others but the yellow horse never noticed

Ill catch em by the back o the neck an piledrive em a
piece They can suit emselves about livin when Im through
with em

Shouldnt wonder ef they did said Rod The yellow horse had
hidden himself very cleverly behind the others as they stood in
a group and was swaying his head close to the ground with a
curious scythelike motion looking sidewise out of his wicked
eyes You can never mistake a maneater getting ready to knock
a man down We had had one to pasture the year before

See that said my companion turning over on the pineneedles
Nice for a woman walking cross lots wouldnt it be

Bring em out said the yellow horse hunching his sharp back
Theres no chance among them tall trees Bring out the  oh
Ouch

It was a rightandleft kick from Muldoon I had no idea that
the old carhorse could lift so quickly Both blows caught the
yellow horse full and fair in the ribs and knocked the breath
out of him

Whats that for he said angrily when he recovered himself
but I noticed he did not draw any nearer to Muldoon than was
necessary

Muldoon never answered but discoursed to himself in the whining
grunt that he uses when he is going downhill in front of a
heavy load We call it singing but I think its something much
worse really The yellow horse blustered and squealed a little
and at last said that if it was a horsefly that had stung
Muldoon he would accept an apology

Youll get it said Muldoon in de sweet byandbye  all de
apology youve any use for Excuse me interruptin you Mr Rod
but Im like Tweezy  Ive a Southern drawback in me hind legs

Naow I want you all here to take notice an youll learn
something Rod went on This yallerbacked skate comes to our
pastur

Not havin paid his board put in Tedda

Not havin earned his board an talks smooth to us abaout
ripplin brooks an wavin grass an his hightoned
puresouled horsehood which dont hender him sheddin women an
childern an fallin over the dash onter men You heard his
talk an you thought it mighty fine some o you

Tuck looked guilty here but she did not say anything

Bit by bit he goes on ez you have heard

I was talkin in the abstrac said the yellow horse in an
altered voice

Abstrac be switched Ez Ive said its this yer blamed
abstrac business that makes the young uns cut up in the
Concord an abstrac or no abstrac he crep on an on till he
come to killin plain an straight  killin them as never done
him no harm jest becase they owned horses

An knowed how to manage em said Tedda That makes it worse

Waal he didnt kill em anyway said Marcus Hed ha been
half killed ef he had tried

Makes no differ Rod answered He meant to an ef he hadnt
 spose we want the Back Pasture turned into a biffinground
on our only day er rest Spose we want our men walkin round
with bits er lead pipe an a twitch an their hands full o
stones to throw at us same s if we wuz hogs er hooky keows
Moren that leavin out Tedda here  an I guess its more her
maouth than her manners stands in her light there aint a horse
on this farm that aint a womans horse an proud of it An
this yer bogspavined Kansas sunflower goes up an daown the
length o the country traded off an traded on boastin as
hes shed women an childern I dont say as a woman in a buggy
aint a fool I dont say as she aint the lastinest kind er
fool ner I dont say a child aint worse  spattin the lines
an standin up an hollerin  but I do say taint none of
our business to shed em daown the roadWe dont said the
Deacon The baby tried to git some o my tail for a sooveneer
last fall when I was up to the haouse an I didnt kick Boneys
talk aint goin to hurt us any We aint colts

Thets what you think Bimeby you git into a tight corner
Lection day er Valley Fair like s not daowntaown when
youre all het an lathery an pestered with flies an
thirsty an sick o bein worked in an aout tween buggies
Then somethin whispers inside o your winkers bringin up all
that talk abaout servitood an inalienable truck an sech like
an jest then a Militia gun goes off er your wheels hit an 
waal youre only another horse ez cant be trusted Ive been
there time an again Boys  fer Ive seen you all bought er
broke  on my solemn repitation fer a threeminute clip I aint
givin you no branmash o my own fixin Im tellin you my
experiences an Ive had ez heavy a load an ez high a check s
any horse here I wuz born with a splint on my near fore ez big
s a walnut an the cussed threecornered Hambletonian temper
that sours up an curdles daown ez you git older Ive favoured
my splint even little Rick he dont know what its cost me to
keep my end up sometimes an Ive fit my temper in stall an
harness hitched up an at pasture till the sweat trickled off
my hooves an they thought I wuz off condition an drenched
me

When my affliction came said Tweezy gently I was very near
to losin my manners Allow me to extend to you my sympathy
suh

Rick said nothing but he looked at Rod curiously Rick is a
sunnytempered child who never bears malice and I dont think
he quite understood He gets his temper from his mother as a
horse should

Ive been there too Rod said Tedda Open confessions good
for the soul an all Monroe County knows Ive had my
experriences

But if you will excuse me suh that pussonTweezy looked
unspeakable things aat the yellow horse  that pusson who has
insulted our intelligences comes from Kansas An what a hose
of his position an Kansas at that says cannot by any stretch
of the halter concern gentlemen of our position Theres no
shadow of equalty suh not even for one kick Hes beneath our
contempt

Let him talk said Marcus Its always interestin to know
what another horse thinks It dont tech us

An he talks so too said Tuck Ive never heard anythin so
smart for a long time

Again Rod stuck out his jaws sidewise and went on slowly as
though he were slugging on a plain bit at the end of a
thirtymile drive

I want all you here ter understand thet ther aint no Kansas
ner no Kentucky ner yet no Vermont in our business Theres
jest two kind o horse in the United Statesthem ez can an will
do their work after bein properly broke an handled an them as
wont Im sick an tired o this everlastin tailswitchin an
wickerin abaout one State er another A horse kin be proud o
his State an swap lies abaout it in stall or when hes hitched
to a block ef he keers to put in flytime that way but he
haint no right to let that pride o hisn interfere with his
work ner to make it an excuse fer claimin hes different
Thats colts talk an dont you fergit it Tweezy An
Marcusyou remember that hem a philosopher an anxious to save
trouble fer you ate dont excuse you from jumpin with all
your feet on a slackjawed crazy claybank like Boney here Its
leavin em alone that gives em their chance to ruin colts an
kill folks An Tuck waal youre a mare anyways  but when a
horse comes along an covers up all his talk o killin with
ripplin brooks an wavin grass an eight quarts of oats a day
free after killn his man dont you be run away with by his
yap Youre too young an too nervous

Ill  Ill have nervous prostration sure ef theres a fight
here said Tuck who saw what was in Rods eye Im  Im that
sympathetic Id run away clear to next caounty

Yep I know that kind o sympathy Jest lasts long enough to
start a fuss an then lights aout to make new trouble I haint
been ten years in harness fer nuthin Naow were goin to keep
school with Boney fer a spell

Say look ahere you aint goin to hurt me are you
Remember I belong to a man in town cried the yellow horse
uneasily Muldoon kept behind him so that he could not run away

I know it There must be some pore delooded fool in this State
hez a right to the loose end o your hitchinstrap Im blame
sorry fer him but he shall hev his rights when were through
with you said Rod

If its all the same gentlemen Id ruther change pasture
Guess Ill do it now

Cant always have your druthers Guess you wont said Rod

But look ahere All of you aint so blame unfriendly to a
stranger Spose we count noses

What in Vermont fer said Rod putting up his eyebrows The
idea of settling a question by counting noses is the very last
thing that ever enters the head of a wellbroken horse

To see how manys on my side Heres Miss Tuck anyway an
Colonel Tweezy yonders neutral an Judge Marcus an I guess
the Reverend the yellow horse meant the Deacon might see that
I had my rights Hes the likeliestlookin Trotter Ive ever
set eyes on Pshaw Boys You aint goin to pound me be
youyou Why weve gone round in pasture all colts together
this month  Sundays haint we as friendly as could be There
aint a horse alive I dont care who he is  has a higher
opinion o you Mr Rod than I have Lets do it fair an true
an above the exe Lets count noses same s they do in
Kansas Here he dropped his voice a little and turned to
Marcus Say Judge theres some green food I know back o the
brook no one haint touched yet After this little fracas is
fixed up you an mell make up a party an tend to itMarcus
did not answer for a long time then he said Theres a pup up
to the haouse bout eight weeks old Hell yap till he gits a
lickin an when he sees it comin he lies on his back an
yowls But he dont go through no cirkituous nosecountin first
Ive seen a noo light sence Rod spoke Youll better stand up to
whats served Im goin to philosophise all over your carcass

Im goin to do yer up in brown paper said Muldoon I can fit

you on apologies

Hold on Ef we all biffed you now these same men youve been
so dead anxious to kill ud call us off Guess well wait till
they go back to the haouse an youll have time to think cool
an quiet said Rod

Have you no respec whatever fer the dignity o our common
horsehood the yellow horse squealed

Nary respec onless the horse kin do something Americas paved
with the kind er horse you are jist plain yallerdog horse 
waitin ter be whipped inter shape We call em yearlings an
colts when theyre young When theyre aged we pound em  in
this pastur Horse sonny is what you start from We know all

monkeyshines which hes took over from his sire an his dam
an thickened up with his own special fancy in the way o goin

of his soul fore hes been broke an rawhided a piece Now we
aint goin to give ornery unswitched horse that haint done
nawthin wuth a quart of oats sence he wuz foaled pet names
that would be good enough fer Nancy Hanks or Alix or Directum

had finished and we climbed into the coupe Tedda whinnying as
we bumped over the ledges Well Im dreffle sorry I cant stay
fer the sociable but I hope an trust my friendsll take a
ticket fer me

Bet your natchul said Muldoon cheerfully and the horses
scattered before us trotting into the ravine

Next morning we sent back to the liverystable what was left of
the yellow horse It seemed tired but anxious to go

End of A WALKING DELEGATE



THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF

It was her first voyage and though she was but a cargosteamer
of twentyfive hundred tons she was the very best of her kind
the outcome of forty years of experiments and improvements in
framework and machinery and her designers and owner thought as
much of her as though she had been the Lucania Any one can make
a floating hotel that will pay expenses if he puts enough money
into the saloon and charges for private baths suites of rooms
and such like but in these days of competition and low freights
every square inch of a cargoboat must be built for cheapness
great holdcapacity and a certain steady speed This boat was
perhaps two hundred and forty feet long and thirtytwo feet
wide with arrangements that enabled her to carry cattle on her
main and sheep on her upper deck if she wanted to but her great
glory was the amount of cargo that she could store away in her
holds Her owners they were a very well known Scotch firm came
round with her from the north where she had been launched and
christened and fitted to Liverpool where she was to take cargo
for New York and the owners daughter Miss Frazier went to and
fro on the clean decks admiring the new paint and the brass
work and the patent winches and particularly the strong
straight bow over which she had cracked a bottle of champagne
when she named the steamer the Dimbula It was a beautiful
September afternoon and the boat in all her newness she was
painted leadcolour with a red funnel  looked very fine indeed
Her houseflag was flying and her whistle from time to time
acknowledged the salutes of friendly boats who saw that she was
new to the High and Narrow Seas and wished to make her welcome

And now said Miss Frazier delightedly to the captain shes
a real ship isnt she It seems only the other day father gave
the order for her and now  and now  isnt she a beauty The
girl was proud of the firm and talked as though she were the
controlling partner

Oh shes no so bad the skipper replied cautiously But Im
sayin that it takes more than christenin to mak a ship In
the nature o things Miss Frazier if ye follow me shes just
irons and rivets and plates put into the form of a ship She has
to find herself yet

I thought father said she was exceptionally well foundSo she
is said the skipper with a laugh But its this way wi
ships Miss Frazier Shes all here but the parrts of her have
not learned to work together yet Theyve had no chance

The engines are working beautifully I can hear them

Yes indeed But theres more than engines to a ship Every
inch of her yell understand has to be livened up and made to
work wi its neighbour  sweetenin her we call it
technically

And how will you do it the girl asked

We can no more than drive and steer her and so forth but if we
have rough weather this trip  its likely  shell learn the
rest by heart For a ship yell obsairve Miss Frazier is in
no sense a reegid body closed at both ends Shes a highly
complex structure o various an conflictin strains wi
tissues that must give an tak accordin to her personal
modulus of elasteecity Mr Buchanan the chief engineer was
coming towards them Im sayin to Miss Frazier here that our
little Dimbula has to be sweetened yet and nothin but a gale
will do it Hows all wi your engines Buck

Well enough  true by plumb an rule o course but theres no
spontaneeity yet He turned to the girl Take my word Miss
Frazier and maybe yell comprehend later even after a pretty
girls christened a ship it does not follow that theres such a
thing as a ship under the men that work her

I was sayin the very same Mr Buchanan the skipper
interrupted

Thats more metaphysical than I can follow said Miss Frazier
laughing

Why so Yere good Scotch an I knew your mothers father he
was fra Dumfries  yeve a vested right in metapheesics Miss
Frazier just as ye have in the Dimbula the engineer said

Eh well we must go down to the deep watters an earn Miss
Frazier her deevidends Will you not come to my cabin for tea
said the skipper Well be in dock the night and when youre
goin back to Glasgie ye can think of us loadin her down an
drivin her forth  all for your sake

In the next few days they stowed some four thousand tons
deadweight into the Dimbula and took her out from Liverpool
As soon as she met the lift of the open water she naturally
began to talk If you lay your ear to the side of the cabin
the next time you are in a steamer you will hear hundreds of
little voices in every direction thrilling and buzzing and
whispering and popping and gurgling and sobbing and squeaking
exactly like a telephone in a thunderstorm Wooden ships
shriek and growl and grunt but iron vessels throb and quiver
through all their hundreds of ribs and thousands of rivets The
Dimbula was very strongly built and every piece of her had a
letter or a number or both to describe it and every piece had
been hammered or forged or rolled or punched by man and had
lived in the roar and rattle of the shipyard for months
Therefore every piece had its own separate voice in exact
proportion to the amount of trouble spent upon it Castiron as
a rule says very little but mild steel plates and
wroughtiron and ribs and beams that have been much bent and
welded and riveted talk continuously Their conversation of
course is not half as wise as our human talk because they are
all though they do not know it bound down one to the other in
a black darkness where they cannot tell what is happening near
them nor what will overtake them next

As soon as she had cleared the Irish coast a sullen greyheaded
old wave of the Atlantic climbed leisurely over her straight
bows and sat down on the steamcapstan used for hauling up the
anchor Now the capstan and the engine that drove it had been
newly painted red and green besides which nobody likes being
ducked

Dont you do that again the capstan sputtered through the
teeth of his cogs Hi Wheres the fellow gone

The wave had slouched overside with a plop and a chuckle but
Plenty more where he came from said a brotherwave and went
through and over the capstan who was bolted firmly to an iron
plate on the iron deckbeams below

Cant you keep still up there said the deckbeams Whats the
matter with you One minute you weigh twice as much as you
ought to and the next you dont

It isnt my fault said the capstan Theres a green brute
outside that comes and hits me on the head

Tell that to the shipwrights Youve been in position for months
and youve never wriggled like this before If you arent
careful youll strain us

Talking of strain said a low rasping unpleasant voice are
any of you fellows  you deckbeams we mean  aware that those
exceedingly ugly knees of yours happen to be riveted into our
structure  ours

Who might you be the deckbeams inquired

Oh nobody in particular was the answer Were only the port
and starboard upperdeck stringers and if you persist in
heaving and hiking like this we shall be reluctantly compelled
to take steps

Now the stringers of the ship are long iron girders so to speak
that run lengthways from stern to bow They keep the iron frames
what are called ribs in a wooden ship in place and also help
to hold the ends of the deckbeams which go from side to side of
the ship Stringers always consider themselves most important
because they are so long

You will take steps  will you This was a long echoing
rumble It came from the frames  scores and scores of them
each one about eighteen inches distant from the next and each
riveted to the stringers in four places We think you will have
a certain amount of trouble in that and thousands and
thousands of the little rivets that held everything together
whispered You Will You will Stop quivering and be quiet
Hold on brethren Hold on Hot Punches Whats that

Rivets have no teeth so they cannot chatter with fright but
they did their best as a fluttering jar swept along the ship
from stern to bow and she shook like a rat in a terriers
mouth

An unusually severe pitch for the sea was rising had lifted the
big throbbing screw nearly to the surface and it was spinning
round in a kind of sodawater  half sea and half air  going
much faster than was proper because there was no deep water for
it to work in As it sank again the engines  and they were
triple expansion three cylinders in a row  snorted through all
their three pistons Was that a joke you fellow outsideIts an
uncommonly poor one How are we to do our work if you fly off the

handle that way

I didnt fly off the handle said the screw twirling huskily
at the end of the screwshaft If I had youd have been
scrapiron by this time The sea dropped away from under me and
I had nothing to catch on to Thats all

Thats all dyou call it said the thrustblock whose
business it is to take the push of the screw for if a screw had
nothing to hold it back it would crawl right into the
engineroom It is the holding back of the screwing action
that gives the drive to a ship I know I do my work deep down
and out of sight but I warn you I expect justice All I ask for
is bare justice Why cant you push steadily and evenly instead
of whizzing like a whirligig and making me hot under all my
collars The thrustblock had six collars each faced with
brass and he did not wish to get them heated

All the bearings that supported the fifty feet of screwshaft as
it ran to the stern whispered Justice  give us justice

I can only give you what I can get the screw answered Look
out Its coming again

He rose with a roar as the Dimbula plunged and whack  flack 
whack  whack went the engines furiously for they had little
to check them

Im the noblest outcome of human ingenuity  Mr Buchanan says
so squealed the highpressure cylinder This is simply
ridiculous The piston went up savagely and choked for half
the steam behind it was mixed with dirty water Help Oiler
Fitter Stoker Help Im choking it gaspedNever in the
history of maritime invention has such a calamity overtaken one
so young and strong And if I go whos to drive the ship

Hush oh hush whispered the Steam who of course had been
to sea many times before He used to spend his leisure ashore in
a cloud or a gutter or a flowerpot or a thunderstorm or
anywhere else where water was needed Thats only a little
priming a little carryingover as they call it Itll happen
all night on and off I dont say its nice but its the best
we can do under the circumstances

What difference can circumstances make  Im here to do my work
 on clean dry steam Blow circumstances the cylinder roared

The circumstances will attend to the blowing Ive worked on the
North Atlantic run a good many times  its going to be rough
before morning

It isnt distressingly calm now said the extra strong frames 
they were called webframes  in the engineroom Theres an
upward thrust that we dont understand and theres a twist that
is very bad for our brackets and diamond plates and theres a
sort of westnorthwesterly pull that follows the twist which
seriously annoys us We mention this because we happened to cost
a good deal of money and we feel sure that the owner would not
approve of our being treated in this frivolous way

Im afraid the matter is out of owners hands for the present
said the Steam slipping into the condenser Youre left to
your own devices till the weather betters

I wouldnt mind the weather said a flat bass voice below
its this confounded cargo thats breaking my heart Im the
garboardstrake and Im twice as thick as most of the others
and I ought to know something

The garboardstrake is the lowest plate in the bottom of a ship
and the Dimbulas garboardstrake was nearly threequarters of an
inch mild steel

The sea pushes me up in a way I should never have expected the
strake grunted and the cargo pushes me down and between the
two I dont know what Im supposed to do

When in doubt hold on rumbled the Steam making head in the
boilers

Yes but theres only dark and cold and hurry down here and
how do I know whether the other plates are doing their duty
Those bulwarkplates up above Ive heard aint more than
fivesixteenths of an inch thick scandalous I call it

I agree with you said a huge webframe by the main
cargohatch He was deeper and thicker than all the others and
curved halfway across the ship in the shape of half an arch to
support the deck where deckbeams would have been in the way of
cargo coming up and down I work entirely unsupported and I
observe that I am the sole strength of this vessel so far as my
vision extends The responsibility I assure you is enormous
I believe the moneyvalue of the cargo is over one hundred and
fifty thousand pounds Think of that

And every pound of it is dependent on my personal exertions
Here spoke a seavalve that communicated directly with the water
outside and was seated not very far from the garboardstrake
I rejoice to think that I am a PrinceHyde Valve with best Para
rubber facings Five patents cover me  I mention this without
pride  five separate and several patents each one finer than
the other At present I am screwed fast Should I open you
would immediately be swamped This is incontrovertible

Patent things always use the longest words they can It is a
trick that they pick up from their inventors

Thats news said a big centrifugal bilgepump I had an idea
that you were employed to clean decks and things with At
least Ive used you for that more than once I forget the
precise number in thousands of gallons which I am guaranteed
to throw per hour but I assure you my complaining friends
that there is not the least danger I alone am capable of
clearing any water that may find its way here By my Biggest
Deliveries we pitched then

The sea was getting up in workmanlike style It was a dead
westerly gale blown from under a ragged opening of green sky
narrowed on all sides by fat grey clouds and the wind bit like
pincers as it fretted the spray into lacework on the flanks of
the waves

I tell you what it is the foremast telephoned down its
wirestays Im up here and I can take a dispassionate view
of things Theres an organised conspiracy against us Im
sure of it because every single one of these waves is heading
directly for our bows The whole sea is concerned in it  and
sos the wind Its awful

Whats awful said a wave drowning the capstan for the
hundredth time

This organised conspiracy on your part the capstan gurgled
taking his cue from the mastOrganised bubbles and spindrift
There has been a depression in the Gulf of Mexico Excuse me He
leaped overside but his friends took up the tale one after
another

Which has advanced  That wave hove green water over the
funnel

As far as Cape Hatteras  He drenched the bridge

And is now going out to sea  to sea  to sea The third went
out in three surges making a clean sweep of a boat which
turned bottom up and sank in the darkening troughs alongside
while the broken falls whipped the davits

Thats all there is to it seethed the white water roaring
through the scuppers  Theres no animus in our proceedings
Were only meteorological corollaries

Is it going to get any worse said the bowanchor chained down
to the deck where he could only breathe once in five minutes

Not knowing cant say Wind may blow a bit by midnight
Thanks awfully Goodbye

The wave that spoke so politely had travelled some distance aft
and found itself all mixed up on the deck amidships which was a
welldeck sunk between high bulwarks One of the bulwarkplates
which was hung on hinges to open outward had swung out and
passed the bulk of the water back to the sea again with a clean
smack

Evidently thats what Im made for said the plate closing
again with a sputter of pride Oh no you dont my friend

The top of a wave was trying to get in from the outside but as
the plate did not open in that direction the defeated water
spurted back

Not bad for fivesixteenths of an inch said the bulwarkplate
My work I see is laid down for the night and it began
opening and shutting as it was designed to do with the motion
of the ship

We are not what you might call idle groaned all the frames
together as the Dimbula climbed a big wave lay on her side at
the top and shot into the next hollow twisting in the descent
A huge swell pushed up exactly under her middle and her bow and
stern hung free with nothing to support them Then one joking
wave caught her up at the bow and another at the stern while
the rest of the water slunk away from under her just to see how
she would like it so she was held up at her two ends only and
the weight of the cargo and the machinery fell on the groaning
iron keels and bilgestringers

Ease off Ease off there roared the garboardstrake I want
oneeighth of an inch fair play D you hear me you rivets

Ease off Ease off cried the bilgestringers Dont hold us
so tight to the frames

Ease off grunted the deckbeams as the Dimbula rolled
fearfully Youve cramped our knees into the stringers and we
cant move Ease off you flatheaded little nuisances

Then two converging seas hit the bows one on each side and fell
away in torrents of streaming thunder

Ease off shouted the forward collisionbulkhead I want to
crumple up but Im stiffened in every direction Ease off you
dirty little forgefilings Let me breathe

All the hundreds of plates that are riveted to the frames and
make the outside skin of every steamer echoed the call for
each plate wanted to shift and creep a little and each plate
according to its position complained against the rivets

We cant help it We cant help it they murmured in reply
Were put here to hold you and were going to do it you never
pull us twice in the same direction If youd say what you were
going to do next wed try to meet your views

As far as I could feel said the upperdeck planking and that
was four inches thick every single iron near me was pushing or
pulling in opposite directions Now whats the sense of that My
friends let us all pull together

Pull any way you please roared the funnel so long as you
dont try your experiments on me I need fourteen wireropes
all pulling in different directions to hold me steady Isnt
that so

We believe you my boy whistled the funnelstays through their
clinched teeth as they twanged in the wind from the top of the
funnel to the deck

Nonsense We must all pull together the decks repeated
Pull lengthways

Very good said the stringers then stop pushing sideways when
you get wet Be content to run gracefully fore and aft and
curve in at the ends as we do

No  no curves at the end A very slight workmanlike curve from

side to side with a good grip at each knee and little pieces
welded on said the deckbeams

Fiddle cried the iron pillars of the deep dark hold Who
ever heard of curves Stand up straight be a perfectly round
column and carry tons of good solid weight  like that There
A big sea smashed on the deck above and the pillars stiffened
themselves to the load

Straight up and down is not bad said the frames who ran that
way in the sides of the ship but you must also expand
yourselves sideways Expansion is the law of life children
Open out open out

Come back said the deckbeams savagely as the upward heave
of the sea made the frames try to open Come back to your
bearings you slackjawed irons

Rigidity Rigidity Rigidity thumped the engines Absolute
unvarying rigidity rigidity

You see whined the rivets in chorus No two of you will ever
pull alike and  and you blame it all on us We only know how
to go through a plate and bite down on both sides so that it
cant and mustnt and shant move

Ive got one fraction of an inch play at any rate said the
garboardstrake triumphantly So he had and all the bottom of
the ship felt the easier for it

Then were no good sobbed the bottom rivets We were ordered
 we were ordered never to give and weve given and the sea
will come in and well all go to the bottom together First
were blamed for everything unpleasant and now we havent the
consolation of having done our work

Dont say I told you whispered the Steam consolingly but
between you and me and the last cloud I came from it was bound
to happen sooner or later You had to give a fraction and
youve given without knowing it Now hold on as before

Whats the use a few hundred rivets chattered Weve given 
weve given and the sooner we confess that we cant keep the
ship together and go off our little heads the easier it will
be No rivet forged can stand this strain

No one rivet was ever meant to Share it among you the Steam
answeredThe others can have my share Im going to pull out
said a rivet in one of the forward plates

If you go others will follow hissed the Steam Theres
nothing so contagious in a boat as rivets going Why I knew a
little chap like you  he was an eighth of an inch fatter
though  on a steamer  to be sure she was only twelve hundred
tons now I come to think of it in exactly the same place as you
are He pulled out in a bit of a bobble of a sea not half as
bad as this and he started all his friends on the same
buttstrap and the plates opened like a furnace door and I had
to climb into the nearest fogbank while the boat went down

Now thats peculiarly disgraceful said the rivet Fatter than
me was he and in a steamer not half our tonnage Reedy little
peg I blush for the family sir He settled himself more
firmly than ever in his place and the Steam chuckled

You see he went on quite gravely  a rivet and especially a
rivet in your position is really the one indispensable part of
the ship

The Steam did not say that be had whispered the very same thing
to every single piece of iron aboard There is no sense in
telling too much

And all that while the little Dimbula pitched and chopped and
swung and slewed and lay down as though she were going to die
and got up as though she had been stung and threw her nose
round and round in circles half a dozen times as she dipped for
the gale was at its worst It was inky black in spite of the
tearing white froth on the waves and to top everything the
rain began to fall in sheets so that you could not see your hand
before your face This did not make much difference to the
ironwork below but it troubled the foremast a good deal

Now its all finished he said dismally The conspiracy is too
strong for us There is nothing left but to 

Hurraar Brrrraaah Brrrrrrp roared the Steam through the
foghorn till the decks quivered Dont be frightened below
Its only me just throwing out a few words in case any one
happens to be rolling round tonight

You dont mean to say theres any one except us on the sea in
such weather said the funnel in a husky snuffle

Scores of em said the Steam clearing its throat Rrrrrraaa
Brraaaaa Prrrrp Its a trifle windy up here and Great
Boilers how it rains

Were drowning said the scuppers They had been doing nothing
else all night but this steady thrash of rain above them seemed
to be the end of the world

Thats all right Well be easier in an hour or two First the
wind and then the rain Soon you may make sail again
Grrraaaaaah Drrrraaaa Drrrp I have a notion that the sea is
going down already If it does youll learn something about
rolling Weve only pitched till now By the way arent you
chaps in the hold a little easier than you were

There was just as much groaning and straining as ever but it was
not so loud or squeaky in tone and when the ship quivered she
did not jar stiffly like a poker hit on the floor but gave
with a supple little waggle like a perfectly balanced
golfclub

We have made a most amazing discovery said the stringers one
after another A discovery that entirely changes the situation
We have found for the first time in the history of
shipbuilding that the inward pull of the deckbeams and the
outward thrust of the frames locks us as it were more closely
in our places and enables us to endure a strain which is
entirely without parallel in the records of marine
architecture

The Steam turned a laugh quickly into a roar up the foghorn
What massive intellects you great stringers have he said
softly when he had finished

We also began the deckbeams are discoverers and geniuses
We are of opinion that the support of the holdpillars
materially helps us We find that we lock up on them when we
are subjected to a heavy and singular weight of sea above

Here the Dimbula shot down a hollow lying almost on her side
righting at the bottom with a wrench and a spasm

In these cases  are you aware of this Steam  the plating at
the bows and particularly at the stern  we would also mention
the floors beneath us  help us to resist any tendency to
spring The frames spoke in the solemn awed voice which people
use when they have just come across something entirely new for
the very first time

Im only a poor puffy little flutterer said the Steam but I
have to stand a good deal of pressure in my business Its all
tremendously interesting Tell us some more You fellows are so
strong

Watch us and youll see said the bowplates proudly Ready
behind there Heres the father and mother of waves coming Sit
tight rivets all A great sluicing comber thundered by but
through the scuffle and confusion the Steam could hear the low
quick cries of the ironwork as the various strains took them 
cries like these Easy now  easy Now push for all your
strength Hold out Give a fraction Hold up Pull in Shove
crossways Mind the strain at the ends Grip now Bite tight
Let the water get away from under  and there she goes

The wave raced off into the darkness shouting Not bad that
if its your first run and the drenched and ducked ship
throbbed to the beat of the engines inside her All three
cylinders were white with the salt spray that had come down
through the engineroom hatch there was white fur on the
canvasbound steampipes and even the brightwork deep below
was speckled and soiled but the cylinders had learned to make
the most of steam that was half water and were pounding along
cheerfully

Hows the noblest outcome of human ingenuity hitting it said
the Steam as he whirled through the engineroom

Nothing for nothing in this world of woe the cylinders
answered as though they had been working for centuries and
precious little for seventyfive pounds head Weve made two
knots this last hour and a quarter Rather humiliating for eight
hundred horsepower isnt it

Well its better than drifting astern at any rate You seem
rather less  how shall I put it  stiff in the back than you
were

If youd been hammered as weve been this night you wouldnt be
stiff iff iff either Theoreti  retti  retti  cally of
course rigidity is the thing Purrr  purr  practically there
has to be a little give and take We found that out by working on
our sides for five minutes at a stretch  chch  chh Hows the
weather

Seas going down fast said the Steam

Good business said the highpressure cylinder Whack her up
boys Theyve given us five pounds more steam and he began
humming the first bars of Said the young Obadiah to the old
Obadiah which as you may have noticed is a pet tune among
engines not built for high speed Racingliners with twinscrews
sing The Turkish Patrol and the overture to the Bronze
Horse and Madame Angot till something goes wrong and then
they render Gounods Funeral March of a Marionette with
variations

Youll learn a song of your own some fine day said the Steam
as he flew up the foghorn for one last bellow

Next day the sky cleared and the sea dropped a little and the
Dimbula began to roll from side to side till every inch of iron
in her was sick and giddyBut luckily they did not all feel ill
at the same time otherwise she would have opened out like a wet
paper box

The Steam whistled warnings as he went about his business it is
in this short quick roll and tumble that follows a heavy sea
that most of the accidents happen for then everything thinks
that the worst is over and goes off guard So he orated and
chattered till the beams and frames and floors and stringers and
things had learned how to lock down and lock up on one another
and endure this new kind of strain

They found ample time to practise for they were sixteen days at
sea and it was foul weather till within a hundred miles of New
York The Dimbula picked up her pilot and came in covered with
salt and red rust Her funnel was dirtygrey from top to
bottom two boats had been carried away three copper ventilators
looked like hats after a fight with the police the bridge had a
dimple in the middle of it the house that covered the steam
steeringgear was split as with hatchets there was a bill for
small repairs in the engineroom almost as long as the
screwshaft the forward cargohatch fell into bucketstaves when
they raised the iron crossbars and the steamcapstan had been
badly wrenched on its bed Altogether as the skipper said it
was a pretty general average

But shes soupled he said to Mr Buchanan For all her
deadweight she rode like a yacht Ye mind that last blow off
the Banks  I am proud of her Buck

Its vera good said the chief engineer looking along the
dishevelled decks Now a man judgin superfeecially would say
we were a wreck but we know otherwise  by experience

Naturally everything in the Dimbula fairly stiffened with pride
and the foremast and the forward collisionbulkhead who are
pushing creatures begged the Steam to warn the Port of New York
of their arrival Tell those big boats all about us they said
They seem to take us quite as a matter of course

It was a glorious clear dead calm morning and in single file
with less than half a mile between each their bands playing and
their tugboats shouting and waving handkerchiefs were the
Majestic the Paris the Touraine the Servia the Kaiser
Wilhelm II and the Werkendam all statelily going out to sea As
the Dimbula shifted her helm to give the great boats clear way
the Steam who knows far too much to mind making an exhibition
of himself now and then shoutedOyez Oyez Oyez Princes
Dukes and Barons of the High Seas Know ye by these presents
we are the Dimbula fifteen days nine hours from Liverpool
having crossed the Atlantic with four thousand ton of cargo for
the first time in our career We have not foundered We are
here Eer Eer We are not disabled But we have had a time
wholly unparalieled in the annals of shipbuilding Our decks
were swept We pitched we rolled We thought we were going to
die Hi Hi But we didnt We wish to give notice that we have
come to New York all the way across the Atlantic through the
worst weather in the world and we are the Dimbula We are  arr
 ha  ha  harrr

The beautiful line of boats swept by as steadily as the
procession of the Seasons The Dimbula heard the Majestic say
Hmph and the Paris grunted How and the Touraine said
Oui with a little coquettish flicker of steam and the Servia
said Haw and the Kaiser and the Werkendam said Hoch Dutch
fashion  and that was absolutely all

I did my best said the Steam gravely but I dont think they
were much impressed with us somehow Do you

Its simply disgusting said the bowplates They might have
seen what weve been through There isnt a ship on the sea that
has suffered as we have  is there now

Well I wouldnt go so far as that said the Steam because
Ive worked on some of those boats and sent them through
weather quite as bad as the fortnight that weve had in six
days and some of them are a little over ten thousand tons I
believe Now Ive seen the Majestic for instance ducked from
her bows to her funnel and Ive helped the Arizona I think she
was to back off an iceberg she met with one dark night and I
had to run out of the Pariss engineroom one day because
there was thirty foot of water in it Of course I dont deny 
The Steam shut off suddenly as a tugboat loaded with a
political club and a brass band that had been to see a New York
Senator off to Europe crossed their bows going to Hoboken
There was a long silence that reached without a break from the
cutwater to the propellerblades of the Dimbula

Then a new big voice said slowly and thickly as though the
owner had just waked up Its my conviction that I have made a
fool of myself

The Steam knew what had happened at once for when a ship finds
herself all the talking of the separate pieces ceases and melts
into one voice which is the soul of the ship

Who are you he said with a laugh

I am the Dimbula of course Ive never been anything else
except that  and a fool

The tugboat which was doing its very best to be run down got
away just in time its band playing clashily and brassily a
popular but impolite air

 In the days of old Rameses  are you onIn the days of old
Rameses  are you onIn the days of old RamesesThat story had
paresisAre you on  are you on  are you on

Well Im glad youve found yourself said the Steam To tell
the truth I was a little tired of talking to all those ribs and
stringers Heres Quarantine After that well go to our wharf
and clean up a little and  next month well do it all over
again

END OF THE THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF



THE TOMB OF HIS ANCESTORS

Some people will tell you that if there were but a single loaf of
bread in all India it would be divided equally between the
Plowdens the Trevors the Beadons and the RivettCarnacs That
is only one way of saying that certain families serve India
generation after generation as dolphins follow in line across
the open sea

Let us take a small and obscure case There has been at least one
representative of the Devonshire Chinns in or near Central India
since the days of LieutenantFireworker Humphrey Chinn of the
Bombay European Regiment who assisted at the capture of
Seringapatam in 1799 Alfred Ellis Chinn Humphreys younger
brother commanded a regiment of Bombay grenadiers from 1804 to
1813 when he saw some mixed fighting and in 1834 John Chinn of
the same family  we will call him John Chinn the First  came to
light as a levelheaded administrator in time of trouble at a
place called Mundesur He died young but left his mark on the
new country and the Honourable the Board of Directors of the
Honourable the East India Company embodied his virtues in a
stately resolution and paid for the expenses of his tomb among
the Satpura hills

He was succeeded by his son Lionel Chinn who left the little
old Devonshire home just in time to be severely wounded in the
Mutiny He spent his working life within a hundred and fifty
miles of John Chinns grave and rose to the command of a
regiment of small wild hillmen most of whom had known his
father His son John was born in the small thatchedroofed
mudwalled cantonment which is even today eighty miles from
the nearest railway in the heart of a scrubby tigerish
country Colonel Lionel Chinn served thirty years and retired
In the Canal his steamer passed the outwardbound troopship
carrying his son eastward to the family duty

The Chinns are luckier than most folk because they know exactly
what they must do A clever Chinn passes for the Bombay Civil
Service and gets away to Central India where everybody is glad
to see him A dull Chinn enters the Police Department or the
Woods and Forest and sooner or later he too appears in
Central India and that is what gave rise to the saying
Central India is inhabited by Bhils Mairs and Chinns all
very much alike The breed is smallboned dark and silent
and the stupidest of them are good shots John Chinn the Second
was rather clever but as the eldest son he entered the army
according to Chinn tradition His duty was to abide in his
fathers regiment for the term of his natural life though the
corps was one which most men would have paid heavily to avoid
They were irregulars small dark and blackish clothed in
riflegreen with blackleather trimmings and friends called them
the Wuddars which means a race of lowcaste people who dig up
rats to eat But the Wuddars did not resent it They were the
only Wuddars and their points of pride were these

Firstly they had fewer English officers than any native
regiment Secondly their subalterns were not mounted on parade
as is the general rule but walked at the head of their men A
man who can hold his own with the Wuddars at their quickstep must
be sound in wind and limb Thirdly they were the most pukka
shikarries outandout hunters in all India Fourthlyup to
onehundredthly  they were the Wuddars Chinns Irregular Bhil
Levies of the old days but now henceforward and for ever the
Wuddars

No Englishman entered their mess except for love or through
family usage The officers talked to their soldiers in a tongue
not two hundred white folk in India understood and the men were
their children all drawn from the Bhils who are perhaps the
strangest of the many strange races in India They were and at
heart are wild men furtive shy full of untold superstitions
The races whom we call natives of the country found the Bhil in
possession of the land when they first broke into that part of
the world thousands of years ago The books call them PreAryan
Aboriginal Dravidian and so forth and in other words that is
what the Bhils call themselves When a Rajput chief whose bards
can sing his pedigree backwards for twelve hundred years is set
on the throne his investiture is not complete till he has been
marked on the forehead with blood from the veins of a Bhil The
Rajputs say the ceremony has no meaning but the Bhil knows that
it is the last last shadow of his old rights as the longago
owner of the soil

Centuries of oppression and massacre made the Bhil a cruel and
halfcrazy thief and cattlestealer and when the English came
he seemed to be almost as open to civilisation as the tigers of
his own jungles But John Chinn the First father of Lionel
grandfather of our John went into his country lived with him
learned his language shot the deer that stole his poor crops
and won his confidence so that some Bhils learned to plough and
sow while others were coaxed into the Companys service to
police their friends

When they understood that standing in line did not mean instant
execution they accepted soldiering as a cumbrous but amusing
kind of sport and were zealous to keep the wild Bhils under
control That was the thin edge of the wedge John Chinn the
First gave them written promises that if they were good from a
certain date the Government would overlook previous offences
and since John Chinn was never known to break his word  he
promised once to hang a Bhil locally esteemed invulnerable and
hanged him in front of his tribe for seven proved murders  the
Bhils settled down as steadily as they knew how It was slow
unseen work of the sort that is being done all over India
today and though John Chinns only reward came as I have
said in the shape of a grave at Government expense the little
people of the hills never forgot him

Colonel Lionel Chinn knew and loved them too and they were very
fairly civilised for Bhils before his service ended Many of
them could hardly be distinguished from lowcaste Hindoo
farmers but in the south where John Chinn the First was
buried the wildest still clung to the Satpura ranges cherishing
a legend that some day Jan Chinn as they called him would
return to his own In the mean time they mistrusted the white
man and his ways The least excitement would stampede them
plundering at random and now and then killing but if they
were handled discreetly they grieved like children and promised
never to do it again

The Bhils of the regiment  the uniformed men  were virtuous in
many ways but they needed humouring They felt bored and
homesick unless taken after tiger as beaters and their
coldblooded daring  all Wuddars shoot tigers on foot it is
their castemark  made even the officers wonder They would
follow up a wounded tiger as unconcernedly as though it were a
sparrow with a broken wing and this through a country full of
caves and rifts and pits where a wild beast could hold a dozen
men at his mercy Now and then some little man was brought to
barracks with his head smashed in or his ribs torn away but his
companions never learned caution they contented themselves with
settling the tiger

Young John Chinn was decanted at the verandah of the Wuddars
lonely messhouse from the back seat of a twowheeled cart his
guncases cascading all round him The slender little
hookeynosed boy looked forlorn as a strayed goat when he
slapped the white dust off his knees and the cart jolted down
the glaring road But in his heart he was contented After
all this was the place where he had been born and things were
not much changed since he had been sent to England a child
fifteen years ago

There were a few new buildings but the air and the smell and the
sunshine were the same and the little green men who crossed the
paradeground looked very familiar Three weeks ago John Chinn
would have said he did not remember a word of the Bhil tongue
but at the mess door he found his lips moving in sentences that
he did not understand  bits of old nursery rhymes and tailends
of such orders as his father used to give the men

The Colonel watched him come up the steps and laughed

Look he said to the Major No need to ask the young uns
breed Hes a pukka Chinn Might be his father in the Fifties
over again

Hope hell shoot as straight said the Major Hes brought
enough ironmongery with him

Wouldnt be a Chinn if he didnt Watch him blowin his nose
Regular Chinn beak Flourishes his handkerchief like his
father Its the second edition  line for line

Fairy tale by Jove said the Major peering through the slats
of the jalousies If hes the lawful heir hell     Now
old Chinn could no more pass that chick without fiddling with it
than    

His son said the Colonel jumping up

Well I be blowed said the Major The boys eye had been
caught by a splitreed screen that hung on a slew between the
veranda pillars and mechanically he had tweaked the edge to
set it level Old Chinn had sworn three times a day at that
screen for many years he could never get it to his satisfaction

His son entered the anteroom in the middle of a fivefold
silence They made him welcome for his fathers sake and as
they took stock of him for his own He was ridiculously like
the portrait of the Colonel on the wall and when he had washed
a little of the dust from his throat he went to his quarters with
the old mans short noiseless junglestep

So much for heredity said the Major That comes of four
generations among the Bhils

And the men know it said a Wing officer Theyve been waiting
for this youth with their tongues hanging out I am persuaded
that unless he absolutely beats em over the head theyll lie
down by companies and worship him

Nothin like havin a father before you said the Major Im
a parvenu with my chaps Ive only been twenty years in the
regiment and my revered parent he was a simple squire Theres
no getting at the bottom of a Bhils mind Now why is the
superior bearer that young Chinn brought with him fleeing across
country with his bundle He stepped into the verandah and
shouted after the man  a typical newjoined subalterns servant
who speaks English and cheats in proportion

What is it he called

Plenty bad man here I going sar was the reply Have taken
Sahibs keys and say will shoot

Doocid lucid  doocid convincin How those upcountry thieves
can leg it He has been badly frightened by some one The
Major strolled to his quarters to dress for mess

Young Chinn walking like a man in a dream had fetched a compass
round the entire cantonment before going to his own tiny
cottage The captains quarters in which he had been born
delayed him for a little then he looked at the well on the
paradeground where he had sat of evenings with his nurse and
at the tenbyfourteen church where the officers went to
service if a chaplain of any official creed happened to come
along It seemed very small as compared with the gigantic
buildings he used to stare up at but it was the same place

From time to time he passed a knot of silent soldiers who
saluted They might have been the very men who had carried him
on their backs when he was in his first knickerbockers A faint
light burned in his room and as he entered hands clasped his
feet and a voice murmured from the floor

Who is it said young Chinn not knowing he spoke in the Bhil
tongue

I bore you in my arms Sahib when I was a strong man and you
were a small one  crying crying crying I am your servant
as I was your fathers before you We are all your servants

Young Chinn could not trust himself to reply and the voice went
on

I have taken your keys from that fat foreigner and sent him
away and the studs are in the shirt for mess Who should know
if I do not know And so the baby has become a man and forgets
his nurse but my nephew shall make a good servant or I will
beat him twice a day

Then there rose up with a rattle as straight as a Bhil arrow a
little whitehaired wizened ape of a man with medals and orders
on his tunic stammering saluting and trembling Behind him a
young and wiry Bhil in uniform was taking the trees out of
Chinns messboots

Chinns eyes were full of tears The old man held out his keys

Foreigners are bad people He will never come back again We
are all servants of your fathers son Has the Sahib forgotten
who took him to see the trapped tiger in the village across the
river when his mother was so frightened and he was so brave

The scene came back to Chinn in great magiclantern flashes
Bukta he cried and all in a breath You promised nothing
should hurt me Is it Bukta

The man was at his feet a second time He has not forgotten He
remembers his own people as his father remembered Now can I
die But first I will live and show the Sahib how to kill
tigers That that yonder is my nephew If he is not a good
servant beat him and send him to me and I will surely kill him
for now the Sahib is with his own people Ai Jan haba  Jan
haba My Jan haba I will stay here and see that this does his
work well Take off his boots fool Sit down upon the bed
Sahib and let me look It is Jan haba

He pushed forward the hilt of his sword as a sign of service
which is an honour paid only to viceroys governors generals
or to little children whom one loves dearly Chinn touched the
hilt mechanically with three fingers muttering he knew not
what It happened to be the old answer of his childhood when
Bukta in jest called him the little General Sahib

The Majors quarters were opposite Chinns and when he heard his
servant gasp with surprise he looked across the room Then the
Major sat on the bed and whistled for the spectacle of the
senior native commissioned officer of the regiment an unmixed
Bhil a Companion of the Order of British India with
thirtyfive years spotless service in the army and a rank
among his own people superior to that of many Bengal
princelings valeting the lastjoined subaltern was a little
too much for his nerves

The throaty bugles blew the Messcall that has a long legend
behind it First a few piercing notes like the shrieks of
beaters in a faraway cover and next large full and smooth
the refrain of the wild song And oh and oh the green pulse
of Mundore  Mundore

All little children were in bed when the Sahib heard that call
last said Bukta passing Chinn a clean handkerchief The call
brought back memories of his cot under the mosquitonetting his
mothers kiss and the sound of footsteps growing fainter as he
dropped asleep among his men So he hooked the dark collar of
his new messjacket and went to dinner like a prince who has
newly inherited his fathers crown

Old Bukta swaggered forth curling his whiskers He knew his own
value and no money and no rank within the gift of the
Government would have induced him to put studs in young
officers shirts or to hand them clean ties Yet when he took
off his uniform that night and squatted among his fellows for a
quiet smoke he told them what he had done and they said that he
was entirely right Thereat Bukta propounded a theory which to a
white mind would have seemed raving insanity but the whispering
levelheaded little men of war considered it from every point of
view and thought that there might be a great deal in it

At mess under the oillamps the talk turned as usual to the
unfailing subject of shikar  big gameshooting of every kind
and under all sorts of conditions Young Chinn opened his eyes
when he understood that each one of his companions had shot
several tigers in the Wuddar style  on foot that is  making no
more of the business than if the brute had been a dog

In nine cases out of ten said the Major a tiger is almost as
dangerous as a porcupine But the tenth time you come home feet
first

That set all talking and long before midnight Chinns brain was
in a whirl with stories of tigers  maneaters and
cattlekillers each pursuing his own business as methodically as
clerks in an office new tigers that had lately come into
suchandsuch a district and old friendly beasts of great
cunning known by nicknames in the messsuch as Puggy who was
lazy with huge paws and Mrs Malaprop who turned up when you
never expected her and made female noises Then they spoke of
Bhil superstitions a wide and picturesque field till young
Chinn hinted that they must be pulling his leg

Deed we arent said a man on his left We know all about
you Youre a Chinn and all that and youve a sort of vested
right here but if you dont believe what were telling you
what will you do when old Bukta begins his stories He knows
about ghosttigers and tigers that go to a hell of their own
and tigers that walk on their hind feet and your grandpapas
ridingtiger as well Odd he hasnt spoken of that yet

You know youve an ancestor buried down Satpura way dont you
said the Major as Chinn smiled irresolutely

Of course I do said Chinn who had the chronicle of the Book
of Chinn by heart It lies in a worn old ledger on the Chinese
lacquer table behind the piano in the Devonshire home and the
children are allowed to look at it on Sundays

Well I wasnt sure Your revered ancestor my boy according
to the Bhils has a tiger of his own  a saddletiger that he
rides round the country whenever he feels inclined I dont call
it decent in an exCollectors ghost but that is what the
Southern Bhils believe Even our men who might be called
moderately cool dont care to beat that country if they hear
that Jan Chinn is running about on his tiger It is supposed to
be a clouded animal  not stripy but blotchy like a
tortoiseshell tomcat No end of a brute it is and a sure
sign of war or pestilence or  or something Theres a nice
family legend for you

Whats the origin of it d you suppose said Chinn

Ask the Satpura Bhils Old Jan Chinn was a mighty hunter before
the Lord Perhaps it was the tigers revenge or perhaps hes
huntin em still You must go to his tomb one of these days and
inquire Bukta will probably attend to that He was asking me
before you came whether by any illluck you had already bagged
your tiger If not he is going to enter you under his own wing
Of course for you of all men its imperative Youll have a
firstclass time with Bukta

The Major was not wrong Bukta kept an anxious eye on young
Chinn at drill and it was noticeable that the first time the
new officer lifted up his voice in an order the whole line
quivered Even the Colonel was taken aback for it might have
been Lionel Chinn returned from Devonshire with a new lease of
life Bukta had continued to develop his peculiar theory among
his intimates and it was accepted as a matter of faith in the
lines since every word and gesture on young Chinns part so
confirmed it

The old man arranged early that his darling should wipe out the
reproach of not having shot a tiger but he was not content to
take the first or any beast that happened to arrive In his own
villages he dispensed the high low and middle justice and when
his peoplenaked and fluttered  came to him with word of a
beast marked down he bade them send spies to the kills and the
wateringplaces that he might be sure the quarry was such an one
as suited the dignity of such a man

Three or four times the reckless trackers returned most
truthfully saying that the beast was mangy undersized  a
tigress worn with nursing or a brokentoothed old male  and
Bukta would curb young Chinns impatience

At last a noble animal was marked down  a tenfoot
cattlekiller with a huge roll of loose skin along the belly
glossyhided fullfrilled about the neck whiskered frisky
and young He had slain a man in pure sport they said

Let him be fed quoth Bukta and the villagers dutifully drove
out a cow to amuse him that he might lie up near by

Princes and potentates have taken ship to India and spent great
moneys for the mere glimpse of beasts onehalf as fine as this
of Buktas

It is not good said he to the Colonel when he asked for
shootingleave that my Colonels son who may be  that my
Colonels son should lose his maidenhead on any small jungle
beast That may come after I have waited long for this which
is a tiger He has come in from the Mair country In seven days
we will return with the skin

The mess gnashed their teeth enviously Bukta had he chosen
might have invited them all But he went out alone with Chinn
two days in a shootingcart and a day on foot till they came to
a rocky glary valley with a pool of good water in it It was a
parching day and the boy very naturally stripped and went in for
a bathe leaving Bukta by the clothes A white skin shows far
against brown jungle and what Bukta beheld on Chinns back and
right shoulder dragged him forward step by step with staring
eyeballs

Id forgotten it isnt decent to strip before a man of his
position said Chinn flouncing in the water How the little
devil stares What is it Bukta The Mark was the whispered
answer

It is nothing You know how it is with my people Chinn was
annoyed The dullred birthmark on his shoulder something like
a conventionalised Tartar cloud had slipped his memory or he
would not have bathed It occurred so they said at home in
alternate generations appearing curiously enough eight or nine
years after birth and save that it was part of the Chinn
inheritance would not be considered pretty He hurried ashore
dressed again and went on till they met two or three Bhils who
promptly fell on their faces My people grunted Bukta not
condescending to notice them And so your people Sahib When I
was a young man we were fewer but not so weak Now we are many
but poor stock As may be remembered How will you shoot him
Sahib From a tree from a shelter which my people shall build
by day or by night

On foot and in the daytime said young Chinn

That was your custom as I have heard said Bukta to himself I
will get news of him Then you and I will go to him I will
carry one gun You have yours There is no need of more What
tiger shall stand against thee

He was marked down by a little waterhole at the head of a
ravine fullgorged and half asleep in the May sunlight He was
walked up like a partridge and he turned to do battle for his
life Bukta made no motion to raise his rifle but kept his eyes
on Chinn who met the shattering roar of the charge with a single
shot  it seemed to him hours as he sighted  which tore through
the throat smashing the backbone below the neck and between the
shoulders The brute couched choked and fell and before Chinn
knew well what had happened Bukta bade him stay still while he
paced the distance between his feet and the ringing jaws

Fifteen said Bukta Short paces No need for a second shot
Sahib He bleeds cleanly where he lies and we need not spoil
the skin I said there would be no need of these but they came
 in case

Suddenly the sides of the ravine were crowned with the heads of
Buktas people  a force that could have blown the ribs out of
the beast had Chinns shot failed but their guns were hidden
and they appeared as interested beaters some five or six waiting
the word to skin Bukta watched the life fade from the wild eyes
lifted one hand and turned on his heel

No need to show that we care said he Now after this we can
kill what we choose Put out your hand Sahib

Chinn obeyed It was entirely steady and Bukta nodded That
also was your custom My men skin quickly They will carry the
skin to cantonments Will the Sahib come to my poor village for
the night and perhaps forget that I am his officer

But those men  the beaters They have worked hard and perhaps


Oh if they skin clumsily we will skin them They are my
people In the lines I am one thing Here I am another

This was very true When Bukta doffed uniform and reverted to the
fragmentary dress of his own people he left his civilisation of
drill in the next world That night after a little talk with his
subjects he devoted to an orgie and a Bhil orgie is a thing not
to be safely written about Chinn flushed with triumph was in
the thick of it but the meaning of the mysteries was hidden
Wild folk came and pressed about his knees with offerings He
gave his flask to the elders of the village They grew eloquent
and wreathed him about with flowers Gifts and loans not all
seemly were thrust upon him and infernal music rolled and
maddened round red fires while singers sang songs of the ancient
times and danced peculiar dances The aboriginal liquors are
very potent and Chinn was compelled to taste them often but
unless the stuff had been drugged how came he to fall asleep
suddenly and to waken late the next day  half a march from the
village

The Sahib was very tired A little before dawn he went to
sleep Bukta explained My people carried him here and now
it is time we should go back to cantonments

The voice smooth and deferential the step steady and silent
made it hard to believe that only a few hours before Bukta was
yelling and capering with naked fellowdevils of the scrub

My people were very pleased to see the Sahib They will never
forget When next the Sahib goes out recruiting he will go to
my people and they will give him as many men as we need

Chinn kept his own counsel except as to the shooting of the
tiger and Bukta embroidered that tale with a shameless tongue
The skin was certainly one of the finest ever hung up in the
mess and the first of many When Bukta could not accompany his
boy on shootingtrips he took care to put him in good hands
and Chinn learned more of the mind and desire of the wild Bhil
in his marches and campings by talks at twilight or at wayside
pools than an uninstructed man could have come at in a
lifetime

Presently his men in the regiment grew bold to speak of their
relativesmostly in troubleand to lay cases of tribal custom
before him They would say squatting in his verandah at
twilight after the easy confidential style of the Wuddars
that suchandsuch a bachelor had run away with suchandsuch a
wife at a faroff village Now how many cows would Chinn Sahib
consider a just fine Or again if written order came from the
Government that a Bhil was to repair to a walled city of the
plains to give evidence in a lawcourt would it be wise to
disregard that order On the other hand if it were obeyed would
the rash voyager return alive

But what have I to do with these things Chinn demanded of
Bukta impatiently I am a soldier I do not know the law

Hoo Law is for fools and white men Give them a large and
loud order and they will abide by it Thou art their law

But wherefore

Every trace of expression left Buktas countenance The idea
might have smitten him for the first time How can I say he
replied Perhaps it is on account of the name A Bhil does not
love strange things Give them orders Sahib two three four
words at a time such as they can carry away in their heads
That is enough

Chinn gave orders then valiantly not realising that a word
spoken in haste before mess became the dread unappealable law of
villages beyond the smoky hills was in truth no less than the
Law of Jan Chinn the First who so the whispered legend ran had
come back to earth to oversee the third generation in the body
and bones of his grandson

There could be no sort of doubt in this matter All the Bhils
knew that Jan Chinn reincarnated had honoured Buktas village
with his presence after slaying his firstin this lifetiger
that he had eaten and drunk with the people as he was used and
 Bukta must have drugged Chinns liquor very deeplyupon his
back and right shoulder all men had seen the same angry red
Flying Cloud that the high Gods had set on the flesh of Jan
Chinn the First when first he came to the Bhil As concerned the
foolish white world which has no eyes he was a slim and young
officer in the Wuddars but his own people knew he was Jan Chinn
who had made the Bhil a man and believing they hastened to
carry his words careful never to alter them on the way

Because the savage and the child who plays lonely games have one
horror of being laughed at or questioned the little folk kept
their convictions to themselves and the Colonel who thought he
knew his regiment never guessed that each one of the six
hundred quickfooted beadyeyed rankandfile to attention
beside their rifles believed serenely and unshakenly that the
subaltern on the left flank of the line was a demigod twice
born tutelary deity of their land and people The Earthgods
themselves had stamped the incarnation and who would dare to
doubt the handiwork of the Earthgods

Chinn being practical above all things saw that his family name
served him well in the lines and in camp His men gave no
troubleone does not commit regimental offences with a god in
the chair of justiceand he was sure of the best beaters in the
district when he needed them They believed that the protection
of Jan Chinn the First cloaked them and were bold in that belief
beyond the utmost daring of excited Bhils

His quarters began to look like an amateur naturalhistory
museum in spite of duplicate heads and horns and skulls that he
sent home to Devonshire The people very humanly learned the
weak side of their god It is true he was unbribable but
birdskins butterflies beetles and above all news of big
game pleased him In other respects too he lived up to the
Chinn tradition He was feverproof A nights sitting out over
a tethered goat in a damp valley that would have filled the
Major with a months malaria had no effect on him He was as
they said salted before he was born

Now in the autumn of his second years service an uneasy rumour
crept out of the earth and ran about among the Bhils Chinn
heard nothing of it till a brother Officer said across the
messtable Your revered ancestors on the rampage in the
Satpura country Youd better look him up

I dont want to be disrespectful but Im a little sick of my
revered ancestor Bukta talks of nothing else Whats the old
boy supposed to be doing now

Riding crosscountry by moonlight on his processional tiger
Thats the story Hes been seen by about two thousand Bhils
skipping along the tops of the Satpuras and scaring people to
death They believe it devoutly and all the Satpura chaps are
worshipping away at his shrine tomb I meanlike good uns You
really ought to go down there Must be a queer thing to see your
grandfather treated as a god

What makes you think theres any truth in the tale said
Chinn

Because all our men deny it They say theyve never heard of
Chinns tiger Now thats a manifest lie because every Bhil
has

Theres only one thing youve overlooked said the Colonel
thoughtfully When a local god reappears on earth its always
an excuse for trouble of some kind and those Satpura Bhils are
about as wild as your grandfather left them young un It means
something

Meanin they may go on the warpath said Chinn

Cant say  as yet Shouldnt be surprised a little bit

I havent been told a syllable

Proves it all the more They are keeping something back

Bukta tells me everything too as a rule Now why didnt he
tell me that

Chinn put the question directly to the old man that night and
the answer surprised him

Why should I tell what is well known Yes the Clouded Tiger is
out in the Satpura country

What do the wild Bhils think that it means

They do not know They wait Sahib what is coming Say only one
little word and we will be content

We What have tales from the south where the jungly Bhils live
to do with drilled men When Jan Chinn wakes is no time for
any Bhil to be quiet

But he has not waked Bukta

Sahib the old mans eyes were full of tender reproof if he
does not wish to be seen why does he go abroad in the
moonlight We know he is awake but we do not know what he
desires Is it a sign for all the Bhils or one that concerns
the Satpura folk alone Say one little word Sahib that I may
carry it to the lines and send on to our villages Why does Jan
Chinn ride out Who has done wrong Is it pestilence Is it
murrain Will our children die Is it a sword Remember Sahib
we are thy people and thy servants and in this life I bore thee
in my armsnot knowing

Bukta has evidently looked on the cup this evening Chinn
thought but if I can do anything to soothe the old chap I
must Its like the Mutiny rumours on a small scale

He dropped into a deep wicker chair over which was thrown his
first tigerskin and his weight on the cushion flapped the
clawed paws over his shoulders He laid hold of them
mechanically as he spoke drawing the painted hide
cloakfashion about him

Now will I tell the truth Bukta he said leaning forward the
dried muzzle on his shoulder to invent a specious lie

I see that it is the truth was the answer in a shaking voice

Jan Chinn goes abroad among the Satpuras riding on the Clouded
Tiger ye say Be it so Therefore the sign of the wonder is for
the Satpura Bhils only and does not touch the Bhils who plough
in the north and east the Bhils of the Khandesh or any
others except the Satpura Bhils who as we know are wild and
foolish

It is then a sign for them Good or bad

Beyond doubt good For why should Jan Chinn make evil to those
whom he has made men The nights over yonder are hot it is ill
to lie in one bed overlong without turning and Jan Chinn would
look again upon his people So he rises whistles his Clouded
Tiger and goes abroad a little to breathe the cool air If the
Satpura Bhils kept to their villages and did not wander after
dark they would not see him Indeed Bukta it is no more than
that he would see the light again in his own country Send this
news south and say that it is my word

Bukta bowed to the floor Good Heavens thought Chinn and
this blinking pagan is a firstclass officer and as straight as
a die I may as well round it off neatly He went on

If the Satpura Bhils ask the meaning of the sign tell them that
Jan Chinn would see how they kept their old promises of good
living Perhaps they have plundered perhaps they mean to
disobey the orders of the Government perhaps there is a dead
man in the jungle and so Jan Chinn has come to see

Is he then angry

Bah Am I ever angry with my Bhils I say angry words and
threaten many things Thou knowest Bukta I have seen thee
smile behind the hand I know and thou knowest The Bhils are
my children I have said it many times

Ay We be thy children said Bukta

And no otherwise is it with Jan Chinn my fathers father He
would see the land he loved and the people once again It is a
good ghost Bukta I say it Go and tell them And I do hope
devoutly he added that it will calm em down Flinging back
the tigerskin he rose with a long unguarded yawn that showed
his wellkept teeth

Bukta fled to be received in the lines by a knot of panting
inquirers

It is true said Bukta He wrapped himself in the skin and
spoke from it He would see his own country again The sign is
not for us and indeed he is a young man How should he lie
idle of nights He says his bed is too hot and the air is bad
He goes to and fro for the love of nightrunning He has said
it

The greywhiskered assembly shuddered

He says the Bhils are his children Ye know he does not lie
He has said it to me

But what of the Satpura Bhils What means the sign for them

Nothing It is only nightrunning as I have said He rides to
see if they obey the Government as he taught them to do in his
first life

And what if they do not

He did not say

The light went out in Chinns quarters

Look said Bukta Now he goes away None the less it is a
good ghost as he has said How shall we fear Jan Chinn who
made the Bhil a man His protection is on us and ye know Jan
Chinn never broke a protection spoken or written on paper
When he is older and has found him a wife he will lie in his bed
till morning

A commanding officer is generally aware of the regimental state
of mind a little before the men and this is why the Colonel
said a few days later that some one had been putting the Fear
of God into the Wuddars As he was the only person officially
entitled to do this it distressed him to see such unanimous
virtue Its too good to last he said I only wish I could
find out what the little chaps mean

The explanation as it seemed to him came at the change of the
moon when he received orders to hold himself in readiness to
allay any possible excitement among the Satpura Bhils who
were to put it mildly uneasy because a paternal Government had
sent up against them a Mahratta Stateeducated vaccinator with
lancets lymph and an officially registered calf In the
language of State they had manifested a strong objection to
all prophylactic measures had forcibly detained the
vaccinator and were on the point of neglecting or evading
their tribal obligations

That means they are in a blue funk  same as they were at
censustime said the Colonel and if we stampede them into
the hills well never catch em in the first place and in the
second theyll whoop off plundering till further orders
Wonder who the Godforsaken idiot is who is trying to vaccinate
a Bhil I knew trouble was coming One good thing is that
theyll only use local corps and we can knock up something
well call a campaign and let them down easy Fancy us potting
our best beaters because they dont want to be vaccinated
Theyre only crazy with fear

Dont you think sir said Chinn the next day that perhaps
you could give me a fortnights shootingleave

Desertion in the face of the enemy by Jove The Colonel
laughed I might but Id have to antedate it a little because
were warned for service as you might say However well assume
that you applied for leave three days ago and are now well on
your way south

Id like to take Bukta with me

Of course yes I think that will be the best plan Youve some
kind of hereditary influence with the little chaps and they may
listen to you when a glimpse of our uniforms would drive them
wild Youve never been in that part of the world before have
you Take care they dont send you to your family vault in your
youth and innocence I believe youll be all right if you can get
em to listen to you

I think so sir but if  if they should accidentally put an
 make asses of emselves  they might you know  I hope
youll represent that they were only frightened There isnt an
ounce of real vice in em and I should never forgive myself if
any one of  of my name got them into trouble

The Colonel nodded but said nothing

Chinn and Bukta departed at once Bukta did not say that ever
since the official vaccinator had been dragged into the hills by
indignant Bhils runner after runner had skulked up to the
lines entreating with forehead in the dust that Jan Chinn
should come and explain this unknown horror that hung over his
people

The portent of the Clouded Tiger was now too clear Let Jan
Chinn comfort his own for vain was the help of mortal man
Bukta toned down these beseechings to a simple request for
Chinns presence Nothing would have pleased the old man better
than a roughandtumble campaign against the Satpuras whom he
as an unmixed Bhil despised but he had a duty to all his
nation as Jan Chinns interpreter and he devoutly believed that
forty plagues would fall on his village if he tampered with that
obligation Besides Jan Chinn knew all things and he rode the
Clouded Tiger

They covered thirty miles a day on foot and pony raising the
blue walllike line of the Satpuras as swiftly as might be
Bukta was very silent

They began the steep climb a little after noon but it was near
sunset ere they reached the stone platform clinging to the side
of a rifted junglecovered hill where Jan Chinn the First was
laid as he had desired that he might overlook his people All
India is full of neglected graves that date from the beginning of
the eighteenth century  tombs of forgotten colonels of corps
long since disbanded mates of East India men who went on
shooting expeditions and never came back factors agents
writers and ensigns of the Honourable the East India Company by
hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands English folk
forget quickly but natives have long memories and if a man has
done good in his life it is remembered after his death The
weathered marble foursquare tomb of Jan Chinn was hung about
with wild flowers and nuts packets of wax and honey bottles of
native spirits and infamous cigars with buffalo horns and
plumes of dried grass At one end was a rude clay image of a
white man in the oldfashioned tophat riding on a bloated
tiger

Bukta salamed reverently as they approached Chinn bared his head
and began to pick out the blurred inscription So far as he
could read it ran thus  word for word and letter for letter

On the other side of the grave were ancient verses also very
worn As much as Chinn could decipher said

For some little time he leaned on the tomb thinking of this dead
man of his own blood and of the house in Devonshire then
nodding to the plains Yes its a big work all of it even my
little share He must have been worth knowing    Bukta
where are my people

Not here Sahib No man comes here except in full sun They
wait above Let us climb and see

But Chinn remembering the first law of Oriental diplomacy in an
even voice answered I have come this far only because the
Satpura folk are foolish and dared not visit our lines Now
bid them wait on me here I am not a servant but the master of
Bhils

I go  I go clucked the old man Night was falling and at
any moment Jan Chinn might whistle up his dreaded steed from the
darkening scrub

Now for the first time in a long life Bukta disobeyed a lawful
command and deserted his leader for he did not come back but
pressed to the flat tabletop of the hill and called softly
Men stirred all about him  little trembling men with bows and
arrows who had watched the two since noon

Where is he whispered one

At his own place He bids you come said Bukta

Now

Now

Rather let him loose the Clouded Tiger upon us We do not go

Nor I though I bore him in my arms when he was a child in this
his life Wait here till the day

But surely he will be angry

He will be very angry for he has nothing to eat But he has
said to me many times that the Bhils are his children By
sunlight I believe this but  by moonlight I am not so sure
What folly have ye Satpura pigs compassed that ye should need
him at all

One came to us in the name of the Government with little
ghostknives and a magic calf meaning to turn us into cattle by
the cutting off of our arms We were greatly afraid but we did
not kill the man He is here bound  a black man and we think
he comes from the west He said it was an order to cut us all
with knives  especially the women and the children We did not
hear that it was an order so we were afraid and kept to our
hills Some of our men have taken ponies and bullocks from the
plains and others pots and cloths and earrings

Are any slain

By our men Not yet But the young men are blown to and fro by
many rumours like flames upon a hill I sent runners asking for
Jan Chinn lest worse should come to us It was this fear that he
foretold by the sign of the Clouded Tiger

He says it is otherwise said Bukta and he repeated with
amplifications all that young Chinn had told him at the
conference of the wicker chair

Think you said the questioner at last that the Government
will lay hands on us

Not I Bukta rejoined Jan Chinn will give an order and ye
will obey The rest is between the Government and Jan Chinn I
myself know something of the ghostknives and the scratching It
is a charm against the Smallpox But how it is done I cannot
tell Nor need that concern you

If he stands by us and before the anger of the Government we
will most strictly obey Jan Chinn except  except we do not go
down to that place tonight

They could hear young Chinn below them shouting for Bukta but
they cowered and sat still expecting the Clouded Tiger The
tomb had been holy ground for nearly half a century If Jan
Chinn chose to sleep there who had better right But they would
not come within eyeshot of the place till broad day

At first Chinn was exceedingly angry till it occurred to him
that Bukta most probably had a reason which indeed he had
and his own dignity might suffer if he yelled without answer
He propped himself against the foot of the grave and
alternately dozing and smoking came through the warm night proud
that he was a lawful legitimate feverproof Chinn

He prepared his plan of action much as his grandfather would have
done and when Bukta appeared in the morning with a most liberal
supply of food said nothing of the overnight desertion Bukta
would have been relieved by an outburst of human anger but Chinn
finished his victual leisurely and a cheroot ere he made any
sign

They are very much afraid said Bukta who was not too bold
himself It remains only to give orders They said they will
obey if thou wilt only stand between them and the Government

That I know said Chinn strolling slowly to the tableland A
few of the elder men stood in an irregular semicircle in an open
glade but the ruck of people  women and children were hidden
in the thicket They had no desire to face the first anger of Jan
Chinn the First

Seating himself on a fragment of split rock he smoked his
cheroot to the butt hearing men breathe hard all about him
Then he cried so suddenly that they jumped

Bring the man that was bound

A scuffle and a cry were followed by the appearance of a Hindoo
vaccinator quaking with fear bound hand and foot as the Bhils
of old were accustomed to bind their human sacrifices He was
pushed cautiously before the presence but young Chinn did not
look at him

I said  the man that was bound Is it a jest to bring me one
tied like a buffalo Since when could the Bhil bind folk at his
pleasure Cut

Half a dozen hasty knives cut away the thongs and the man
crawled to Chinn who pocketed his case of lancets and tubes of
lymph Then sweeping the semicircle with one comprehensive
forefinger and in the voice of compliment he said clearly and
distinctly  Pigs

Ai whispered Bukta Now he speaks Woe to foolish people

I have come on foot from my house the assembly shuddered to
make clear a matter which any other Satpura Bhil would have seen
with both eyes from a distance Ye know the Smallpox who pits
and scars your children so that like waspcombs It is an order
of the Government that whoso is scratched on the arm with these
little knives which I hold up is charmed against her All Sahibs
are thus charmed and very many Hindoos This is the mark of the
charm Look

He rolled back his sleeve to the armpit and showed the white
scars of the vaccinationmark on his white skin Come all and
look

A few daring spirits came up and nodded their heads wisely
There was certainly a mark and they knew well what other dread
marks were hidden by the shirt Merciful was Jan Chinn that
then and there proclaimed his godhead

Now all these things the man whom ye bound told you

I did  a hundred times but they answered with blows groaned
the operator chafing his wrists and ankles

But being pigs ye did not believe and so came I here to save
you first from Smallpox next from a great folly of fear and
lastly it may befrom the rope and the jail It is no gain to
me it is no pleasure to me but for the sake of that one who is
yonder who made the Bhil a man  he pointed down the hill 
I who am of his blood the son of his son come to turn your
people And I speak the truth as did Jan Chinn

The crowd murmured reverently and men stole out of the thicket
by twos and threes to join it There was no anger in their gods
face

These are my orders Heaven send theyll take em but I seem
to have impressed em so far I myself will stay among you
while this man scratches your arms with the knives after the
order of the Government In three or it may be five or seven
days your arms will swell and itch and burn That is the power
of Smallpox fighting in your base blood against the orders of
the Government I will therefore stay among you till I see that
Smallpox is conquered and I will not go away till the men and
the women and the little children show me upon their arms such
marks as I have even now showed you I bring with me two very
good guns and a man whose name is known among beasts and men
We will hunt together I and he and your young men and the
others shall eat and lie still This is my order

There was a long pause while victory hung in the balance A
whitehaired old sinner standing on one uneasy leg piped up

There are ponies and some few bullocks and other things for
which we need a kowl protection They were not taken in the
way of trade

The battle was won and John Chinn drew a breath of relief The
young Bhils had been raiding but if taken swiftly all could be
put straight

I will write a kowl so soon as the ponies the bullocks and the
other things are counted before me and sent back whence they
came But first we will put the Government mark on such as have
not been visited by Smallpox In an undertone to the
vaccinator If you show you are afraid youll never see Poona
again my friend

There is not sufficient ample supply of vaccination for all this
population said the man They destroyed the offeecial calf

They wont know the difference Scrape em and give me a couple
of lancets Ill attend to the elders

The aged diplomat who had demanded protection was the first
victim He fell to Chinns hand and dared not cry out As soon
as he was freed he dragged up a companion and held him fast
and the crisis became as it were a childs sport for the
vaccinated chased the unvaccinated to treatment vowing that all
the tribe must suffer equally The women shrieked and the
children ran howling but Chinn laughed and waved the
pinktipped lancet

It is an honour he cried Tell them Bukta how great an
honour it is that I myself mark them Nay I cannot mark every
one  the Hindoo must also do his work  but I will touch all
marks that he makes so there will be an equal virtue in them
Thus do the Rajputs stick pigs Ho brother with one eye Catch
that girl and bring her to me She need not run away yet for
she is not married and I do not seek her in marriage She will
not come Then she shall be shamed by her little brother a fat
boy a bold boy He puts out his arm like a soldier Look He
does not flinch at the blood Some day he shall be in my
regiment And now mother of many we will lightly touch thee
for Smallpox has been before us here It is a true thing
indeed that this charm breaks the power of Mata There will be
no more pitted faces among the Satpuras and so ye can ask many
cows for each maid to be wed

And so on and so on  quickpoured showmans patter sauced in
the Bhil huntingproverbs and tales of their own brand of coarse
humour till the lancets were blunted and both operators worn out

But nature being the same the world over the unvaccinated grew
jealous of their marked comrades and came near to blows about
it Then Chinn declared himself a court of justice no longer a
medical board and made formal inquiry into the late robberies

We are the thieves of Mahadeo said the Bhils simply It is
our fate and we were frightened When we are frightened we
always steal

Simply and directly as children they gave in the tale of the
plunder all but two bullocks and some spirits that had gone
amissing these Chinn promised to make good out of his own
pocket and ten ringleaders were despatched to the lowlands
with a wonderful document written on the leaf of a notebook
and addressed to an Assistant District Superintendent of Police
There was warm calamity in that note as Jan Chinn warned them
but anything was better than loss of liberty

Armed with this protection the repentant raiders went downhill
They had no desire whatever to meet Mr Dundas Fawne of the
Police aged twentytwo and of a cheerful countenance nor did
they wish to revisit the scene of their robberies Steering a
middle course they ran into the camp of the one Government
chaplain allowed to the various irregular corps through a
district of some fifteen thousand square miles and stood before
him in a cloud of dust He was by way of being a priest they
knew and what was more to the point a good sportsman who paid
his beaters generously

When he read Chinns note he laughed which they deemed a lucky
omen till he called up policemen who tethered the ponies and
the bullocks by the piled housegear and laid stern hands upon
three of that smiling band of the thieves of Mahadeo The
chaplain himself addressed them magisterially with a
ridingwhip That was painful but Jan Chinn had prophesied it
They submitted but would not give up the written protection
fearing the jail On their way back they met Mr D Fawne who
had heard about the robberies and was not pleased

Certainly said the eldest of the gang when the second
interview was at an end certainly Jan Chinns protection has
saved us our liberty but it is as though there were many
beatings in one small piece of paper Put it away

One climbed into a tree and stuck the letter into a cleft forty
feet from the ground where it could do no harm Warmed sore
but happy the ten returned to Jan Chinn next day where he sat
among uneasy Bhils all looking at their right arms and all
bound under terror of their gods disfavour not to scratch

It was a good kowl said the leader First the chaplain who
laughed took away our plunder and beat three of us as was
promised Next we meet Fawne Sahib who frowned and asked for
the plunder We spoke the truth and so he beat us all one
after another and called us chosen names He then gave us these
two bundles they set down a bottle of whisky and a box of
cheroots and we came away The kowl is left in a tree
because its virtue is that so soon as we show it to a Sahib we
are beaten

But for that kowl said Jan Chinn sternly ye would all have
been marching to jail with a policeman on either side Ye come
now to serve as beaters for me These people are unhappy and
we will go hunting till they are well Tonight we will make a
feast

It is written in the chronicles of the Satpura Bhils together
with many other matters not fit for print that through five
days after the day that he had put his mark upon them Jan
Chinn the First hunted for his people and on the five nights of
those days the tribe was gloriously and entirely drunk Jan
Chinn bought country spirits of an awful strength and slew wild
pig and deer beyond counting so that if any fell sick they might
have two good reasons

Between head and stomachaches they found no time to think of
their arms but followed Jan Chinn obediently through the
jungles and with each days returning confidence men women
and children stole away to their villages as the little army
passed by They carried news that it was good and right to be
scratched with ghostknives that Jan Chinn was indeed
reincarnated as a god of free food and drink and that of all
nations the Satpura Bhils stood first in his favour if they
would only refrain from scratching Henceforward that kindly
demigod would be connected in their minds with great gorgings
and the vaccine and lancets of a paternal Government

And tomorrow I go back to my home said Jan Chinn to his
faithful few whom neither spirits overeating nor swollen
glands could conquer It is hard for children and savages to
behave reverently at all times to the idols of their
makebelief and they had frolicked excessively with Jan Chinn
But the reference to his home cast a gloom on the people

And the Sahib will not come again said he who had been
vaccinated first

That is to be seen answered Chinn warily

Nay but come as a white man  come as a young man whom we know
and love for as thou alone knowest we are a weak people If
we again saw thy  thy horse  They were picking up their
courage

I have no horse I came on foot with Bukta yonder What is
thisThou knowest  the thing that thou hast chosen for a
nighthorse The little men squirmed in fear and awe

Nighthorses Bukta what is this last tale of children

Bukta had been a silent leader in Chinns presence since the
night of his desertion and was grateful for a chanceflung
question

They know Sahib he whispered It is the Clouded Tiger That
that comes from the place where thou didst once sleep It is thy
horse  as it has been these three generations

My horse That was a dream of the Bhils

It is no dream Do dreams leave the tracks of broad pugs on
earth Why make two faces before thy people They know of the
nightridings and they  and they  

Are afraid and would have them cease

Bukta nodded If thou hast no further need of him He is thy
horse

The thing leaves a trail then said Chinn

We have seen it It is like a village road under the tomb

Can ye find and follow it for me

By daylight  if one comes with us and above all stands near
by

I will stand close and we will see to it that Jan Chinn does
not ride any more

The Bhils shouted the last words again and again

From Chinns point of view the stalk was nothing more than an
ordinary one  downhill through split and crannied rocks
unsafe perhaps if a man did not keep his wits by him but no
worse than twenty others he had undertaken Yet his men  they
refused absolutely to beat and would only trail  dripped sweat
at every move They showed the marks of enormous pugs that ran
always downhill to a few hundred feet below Jan Chinns tomb
and disappeared in a narrowmouthed cave It was an insolently
open road a domestic highway beaten without thought of
concealment

The beggar might be paying rent and taxes Chinn muttered ere
he asked whether his friends taste ran to cattle or man

Cattle was the answer Two heifers a week We drive them for
him at the foot of the hill It is his custom If we did not he
might seek us

Blackmail and piracy said Chinn I cant say I fancy going
into the cave after him Whats to be done

The Bhils fell back as Chinn lodged himself behind a rock with
his rifle ready Tigers he knew were shy beasts but one who
had been long cattlefed in this sumptuous style might prove
overbold

He speaks some one whispered from the rear He knows too

Well of all the infernal cheek said Chinn There was an angry
growl from the cave  a direct challenge

Come out then Chinn shouted Come out of that Lets have a
look at youThe brute knew well enough that there was some
connection between brown nude Bhils and his weekly allowance
but the white helmet in the sunlight annoyed him and he did not
approve of the voice that broke his rest Lazily as a gorged
snake he dragged himself out of the cave and stood yawning and
blinking at the entrance The sunlight fell upon his flat right
side and Chinn wondered Never had he seen a tiger marked
after this fashion Except for his head which was staringly
barred he was dappled  not striped but dappled like a childs
rockinghorse in rich shades of smoky black on red gold That
portion of his belly and throat which should have been white was
orange and his tail and paws were black

He looked leisurely for some ten seconds and then deliberately
lowered his head his chin dropped and drawn in staring
intently at the man The effect of this was to throw forward the
round arch of his skull with two broad bands across it while
below the bands glared the unwinking eyes so that head on as
he stood he showed something like a diabolically scowling
pantomimemask It was a piece of natural mesmerism that he had
practised many times on his quarry and though Chinn was by no
means a terrified heifer he stood for a while held by the
extraordinary oddity of the attack The head  the body seemed to
have been packed away behind it  the ferocious skulllike head
crept nearer to the switching of an angry tailtip in the grass
Left and right the Bhils had scattered to let John Chinn subdue
his own horseMy word he thought Hes trying to frighten
me and fired between the saucerlike eyes leaping aside upon
the shot

A big coughing mass reeking of carrion bounded past him up the
hill and he followed discreetly The tiger made no attempt to
turn into the jungle he was hunting for sight and breath  nose
up mouth open the tremendous forelegs scattering the gravel in
spurts

Scuppered said John Chinn watching the flight Now if he was
a partridge hed tower Lungs must be full of blood

The brute had jerked himself over a boulder and fallen out of
sight the other side John Chinn looked over with a ready
barrel But the red trail led straight as an arrow even to his
grandfathers tomb and there among the smashed spiritbottles
and the fragments of the mud image the life left with a flurry
and a grunt

If my worthy ancestor could see that said John Chinn hed
have been proud of me Eyes lower jaw and lungs A very nice
shot He whistled for Bukta as he drew the tape over the
stiffening bulk

Ten  six  eight  by Jove Its nearly eleven  call it
eleven Forearm twentyfour five  seven and a half A short
tail too three feet one But what a skin Oh Bukta Bukta The
men with the knives swiftly

Is he beyond question dead said an awestricken voice behind a
rock

That was not the way I killed my first tiger said Chinn I
did not think that Bukta would run I had no second gun

It  it is the Clouded Tiger said Bukta unheeding the taunt
He is dead

Whether all the Bhils vaccinated and unvaccinated of the
Satpuras had lain by to see the kill Chinn could not say but
the whole hills flank rustled with little men shouting
singing and stamping And yet till he had made the first cut
in the splendid skin not a man would take a knife and when the
shadows fell they ran from the redstained tomb and no
persuasion would bring them back till dawn So Chinn spent a
second night in the open guarding the carcass from jackals and
thinking about his ancestor

He returned to the lowlands to the triumphal chant of an
escorting army three hundred strong the Mahratta vaccinator
close at his elbow and the rudely dried skin a trophy before
him When that army suddenly and noiselessly disappeared as
quail in high corn he argued he was near civilisation and a
turn in the road brought him upon the camp of a wing of his own
corps He left the skin on a carttail for the world to see and
sought the Colonel

Theyre perfectly right he explained earnestly There isnt
an ounce of vice in em They were only frightened Ive
vaccinated the whole boiling and they like it awfully What are
 what are we doing here sir

Thats what Im trying to find out said the Colonel I dont
know yet whether were a piece of a brigade or a police force
However I think well call ourselves a police force How did
you manage to get a Bhil vaccinated

Well sir said Chinn  Ive been thinking it over and as
far as I can make out Ive got a sort of hereditary influence
over em

So I know or I wouldnt have sent you but what exactly

Its rather rummy It seems from what I can make out that Im
my own grandfather reincarnated and Ive been disturbing the
peace of the country by riding a padtiger of nights If I
hadnt done that I dont think theyd have objected to the
vaccination but the two together were more than they could
stand And so sir Ive vaccinated em and shot my tigerhorse
as a sort o proof of good faith You never saw such a skin in
your life

The Colonel tugged his moustache thoughtfully Now how the
deuce said he am I to include that in my report

Indeed the official version of the Bhils antivaccination
stampede said nothing about Lieutenant John Chinn his godship
But Bukta knew and the corps knew and every Bhil in the
Satpura hills knew

And now Bukta is zealous that John Chinn shall swiftly be wedded
and impart his powers to a son for if the Chinn succession
fails and the little Bhils are left to their own imaginings
there will be fresh trouble in the Satpuras

End of THE TOMB OF HIS ANCESTORS



THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP SEA

All supplies very bad and dear and there are no facilities for
even the smallest repairs  Sailing Directions

Her nationality was British but you will not find her houseflag
in the list of our mercantile marine She was a
ninehundredton iron schoonerrigged screw cargoboat
differing externally in no way from any other tramp of the sea
But it is with steamers as it is with men There are those who
will for a consideration sail extremely close to the wind and
in the present state of a fallen world such people and such
steamers have their use From the hour that the Aglaia first
entered the Clyde  new shiny and innocent with a quart of
cheap champagne trickling down her cutwater  Fate and her
owner who was also her captain decreed that she should deal
with embarrassed crowned heads fleeing Presidents financiers
of overextended ability women to whom change of air was
imperative and the lesser lawbreaking Powers Her career led
her sometimes into the Admiralty Courts where the sworn
statements of her skipper filled his brethren with envy The
mariner cannot tell or act a lie in the face of the sea or
mislead a tempest but as lawyers have discovered he makes up
for chances withheld when he returns to shore an affidavit in
either hand

The Aglaia figured with distinction in the great Mackinaw
salvagecase It was her first slip from virtue and she learned
how to change her name but not her heart and to run across the
sea As the Guiding Light she was very badly wanted in a South
American port for the little matter of entering harbour at full
speed colliding with a coalhulk and the States only
manofwar just as that manofwar was going to coal She put
to sea without explanations though three forts fired at her for
half an hour As the Julia MGregor she had been concerned in
picking up from a raft certain gentlemen who should have stayed
in Noumea but who preferred making themselves vastly unpleasant
to authority in quite another quarter of the world and as the
ShahinShah she had been overtaken on the high seas indecently
full of munitions of war by the cruiser of an agitated Power at
issue with its neighbour That time she was very nearly sunk and
her riddled hull gave eminent lawyers of two countries great
profit After a season she reappeared as the Martin Hunt painted
a dull slatecolour with pure saffron funnel and boats of
robinsegg blue engaging in the Odessa trade till she was
invited and the invitation could not well be disregarded to
keep away from Black Sea ports altogether

She had ridden through many waves of depression Freights might
drop out of sight Seamens Unions throw spanners and nuts at
certificated masters or stevedores combine till cargo perished
on the dockhead but the boat of many names came and went
busy alert and inconspicuous always Her skipper made no
complaint of hard times and port officers observed that her
crew signed and signed again with the regularity of Atlantic
liner boatswains Her name she changed as occasion called her
wellpaid crew never and a large percentage of the profits of
her voyages was spent with an open hand on her engineroom She
never troubled the underwriters and very seldom stopped to talk
with a signalstation for her business was urgent and private

But an end came to her tradings and she perished in this manner
Deep peace brooded over Europe Asia Africa America
Australasia and Polynesia The Powers dealt together more or
less honestly banks paid their depositors to the hour diamonds
of price came safely to the hands of their owners Republics
rested content with their Dictators diplomats found no one whose
presence in the least incommoded them monarchs lived openly with
their lawfully wedded wives It was as though the whole earth
had put on its best Sunday bib and tucker and business was very
bad for the Martin Hunt The great virtuous calm engulfed her
slate sides yellow funnel and all but cast up in another
hemisphere the steam whaler Haliotis black and rusty with a
manurecoloured funnel a litter of dingy white boats and an
enormous stove or furnace for boiling blubber on her forward
welldeck There could be no doubt that her trip was successful
for she lay at several ports not too well known and the smoke of
her tryingout insulted the beaches

Anon she departed at the speed of the average London
fourwheeler and entered a semiinland sea warm still and
blue which is perhaps the most strictly preserved water in
the world There she stayed for a certain time and the great
stars of those mild skies beheld her playing pussinthecorner
among islands where whales are never found All that while she
smelt abominably and the smell though fishy was not
whalesome One evening calamity descended upon her from the
island of PygangWatai and she fled while her crew jeered at a
fat blackandbrown gunboat puffing far behind They knew to the
last revolution the capacity of every boat on those seas that
they were anxious to avoid A British ship with a good
conscience does not as a rule flee from the manofwar of a
foreign Power and it is also considered a breach of etiquette
to stop and search British ships at sea These things the
skipper of the Haliotis did not pause to prove but held on at an
inspiriting eleven knots an hour till nightfall One thing only
he overlooked

The Power that kept an expensive steampatrol moving up and down
those waters they had dodged the two regular ships of the
station with an ease that bred contempt had newly brought up a
third and a fourteenknot boat with a clean bottom to help the
work and that was why the Haliotis driving hard from the east
to the west found herself at daylight in such a position that
she could not help seeing an arrangement of four flags a mile
and a half behind which read Heave to or take the
consequences

She had her choice and she took it The end came when
presuming on her lighter draught she tried to draw away
northward over a friendly shoal The shell that arrived by way
of the Chief Engineers cabin was some five inches in diameter
with a practice not a bursting charge It had been intended to
cross her bows and that was why it knocked the framed portrait
of the Chief Engineers wife  and she was a very pretty girl 
on to the floor splintered his washhand stand crossed the
alleyway into the engineroom and striking on a grating dropped
directly in front of the forward engine where it burst neatly
fracturing both the bolts that held the connectingrod to the
forward crank

What follows is worth consideration The forward engine had no
more work to do Its released pistonrod therefore drove up
fiercely with nothing to check it and started most of the nuts
of the cylindercover It came down again the full weight of
the steam behind it and the foot of the disconnected
connectingrod useless as the leg of a man with a sprained
ankle flung out to the right and struck the starboard or
righthand castiron supportingcolumn of the forward engine
cracking it clean through about six inches above the base and
wedging the upper portion outwards three inches towards the
ships side There the connectingrod jammed Meantime the
afterengine being as yet unembarrassed went on with its work
and in so doing brought round at its next revolution the crank of
the forward engine which smote the already jammed
connectingrod bending it and therewith the pistonrod
crosshead the big crosspiece that slides up and down so
smoothly

The crosshead jammed sideways in the guides and in addition to
putting further pressure on the already broken starboard
supportingcolumn cracked the port or lefthand
supportingcolumn in two or three places There being nothing
more that could be made to move the engines brought up all
standing with a hiccup that seemed to lift the Haliotis a foot
out of the water and the engineroom staff opening every steam
outlet that they could find in the confusion arrived on deck
somewhat scalded but calm There was a sound below of things
happening  a rushing clicking purring grunting rattling
noise that did not last for more than a minute It was the
machinery adjusting itself on the spur of the moment to a
hundred altered conditions Mr Wardrop one foot on the upper
grating inclined his ear sideways and groaned You cannot
stop engines working at twelve knots an hour in three seconds
without disorganising them The Haliotis slid forward in a
cloud of steam shrieking like a wounded horse There was
nothing more to do The fiveinch shell with a reduced charge
had settled the situation And when you are full all three
holds of strictly preserved pearls when you have cleaned out
the Tanna Bank the SeaHorse Bank and four other banks from
one end to the other of the Amanala Sea when you have ripped
out the very heart of a rich Government monopoly so that five
years will not repair your wrongdoings  you must smile and
take what is in store But the skipper reflected as a launch
put out from the manofwar that he had been bombarded on the
high seas with the British flag  several of them 
picturesquely disposed above him and tried to find comfort from
the thought

Where said the stolid naval lieutenant hoisting himself aboard
where are those dam pearls

They were there beyond evasion No affidavit could do away with
the fearful smell of decayed oysters the divingdresses and
the shelllittered hatches They were there to the value of
seventy thousand pounds more or less and every pound poached

The manofwar was annoyed for she had used up many tons of
coal she had strained her tubes and worse than all her
officers and crew had been hurried Every one on the Haliotis
was arrested and rearrested several times as each officer came
aboard then they were told by what they esteemed to be the
equivalent of a midshipman that they were to consider themselves
prisoners and finally were put under arrest

Its not the least good said the skipper suavely Youd much
better send us a tow  

Be still  you are arrest was the reply

Where the devil do you expect we are going to escape to Were
helpless Youve got to tow us into somewhere and explain why
you fired on us Mr Wardrop were helpless arent we

Ruined from end to end said the man of machinery If she
rolls the forward cylinder will come down and go through her
bottom Both columns are clean cut through Theres nothing to
hold anything up

The council of war clanked off to see if Mr Wardrops words were
true He warned them that it was as much as a mans life was
worth to enter the engineroom and they contented themselves
with a distant inspection through the thinning steam The
Haliotis lifted to the long easy swell and the starboard
supportingcolumn ground a trifle as a man grits his teeth
under the knife The forward cylinder was depending on that
unknown force men call the pertinacity of materials which now
and then balances that other heartbreaking power the perversity
of inanimate things

You see said Mr Wardrop hurrying them away The engines
arent worth their price as old iron

We tow was the answer Afterwards we shall confiscate

The manofwar was shorthanded and did not see the necessity
for putting a prizecrew aboard the Haliotis So she sent one
sublieutenant whom the skipper kept very drunk for he did not
wish to make the tow too easy and moreover he had an
inconspicuous little rope hanging from the stem of his ship

Then they began to tow at an average speed of four knots an hour
The Haliotis was very hard to move and the gunnerylieutenant
who had fired the fiveinch shell had leisure to think upon
consequences Mr Wardrop was the busy man He borrowed all the
crew to shore up the cylinders with spars and blocks from the
bottom and sides of the ship It was a days risky work but
anything was better than drowning at the end of a towrope and
if the forward cylinder had fallenit would have made its way to
the seabed and taken the Haliotis after

Where are we going to and how long will they tow us he asked
of the skipper

God knows and this prizelieutenants drunk What do you think
you can do

Theres just the bare chance Mr Wardrop whispered though no
one was within hearing theres just the bare chance o
repairin her if a man knew how Theyve twisted the very guts
out of her bringing her up with that jerk but Im saying that
with time and patience theres just the chance o making steam
yet We could do it

The skippers eye brightened Do you mean he began that she
is any good

Oh no said Mr Wardrop Shell need three thousand pounds in
repairs at the lowest if shes to take the sea again an that
apart from any injury to her structure Shes like a man fallen
down five pair o stairs We cant tell for months what has
happened but we know shell never be good again without a new
inside Ye should see the condensertubes an the steam
connections to the donkey for two things only Im not afraid
of them repairin her Im afraid of them stealin things

Theyve fired on us Theyll have to explain that

Our reputations not good enough to ask for explanations Lets
take what we have and be thankful Ye would not have consuls
remembern the Guidin Light an the ShahinShah an the
Aglaia at this most alarmin crisis Weve been no better than
pirates these ten years Under Providence were no worse than
thieves now Weve much to be thankful for  if we eer get back
to her

Make it your own way then said the skipper If theres the
least chance  

Ill leave none said Mr Wardrop  none that theyll dare to
take Keep her heavy on the tow for we need time

The skipper never interfered with the affairs of the engineroom
and Mr Wardrop  an artist in his profession  turned to and
composed a work terrible and forbidding His background was the
darkgrained sides of the engineroom his material the metals
of power and strength helped out with spars baulks and ropes
The manofwar towed sullenly and viciously The Haliotis behind
her hummed like a hive before swarming With extra and totally
unneeded spars her crew blocked up the space round the forward
engine till it resembled a statue in its scaffolding and the
butts of the shores interfered with every view that a
dispassionate eye might wish to take And that the dispassionate
mind might be swiftly shaken out of its calm the wellsunk
bolts of the shores were wrapped round untidily with loose ends
of ropes giving a studied effect of most dangerous insecurity
Next Mr Wardrop took up a collection from the afterengine
which as you will remember had not been affected in the general
wreck The cylinder escapevalve he abolished with a
flogginghammer It is difficult in faroff ports to come by
such valves unless like Mr Wardrop you keep duplicates in
store At the same time men took off the nuts of two of the
great holdingdown bolts that serve to keep the engines in place
on their solid bed An engine violently arrested in midcareer
may easily jerk off the nut of a holdingdown bolt and this
accident looked very natural

Passing along the tunnel he removed several shaft couplingbolts
and nuts scattering other and ancient pieces of iron
underfoot Cylinderbolts he cut off to the number of six from
the afterengine cylinder so that it might match its neighbour
and stuffed the bilge  and feedpumps with cottonwaste Then
he made up a neat bundle of the various odds and ends that he had
gathered from the engines  little things like nuts and
valvespindles all carefully tallowed  and retired with them
under the floor of the engineroom where he sighed being fat
as he passed from manhole to manhole of the double bottom and in
a fairly dry submarine compartment hid them Any engineer
particularly in an unfriendly port has a right to keep his spare
stores where he chooses and the foot of one of the cylinder
shores blocked all entrance into the regular storeroom even if
that had not been already closed with steel wedges In
conclusion he disconnected the afterengine laid piston and
connectingrod carefully tallowed where it would be most
inconvenient to the casual visitor took out three of the eight
collars of the thrustblock hid them where only he could find
them again filled the boilers by hand wedged the sliding doors
of the coalbunkers and rested from his labours The
engineroom was a cemetery and it did not need the contents of
the ashlift through the skylight to make it any worse

He invited the skipper to look at the completed work

Saw ye ever such a forsaken wreck as that  said he proudly
It almost frights me to go under those shores Now what d you
think theyll do to us

Wait till we see said the skipper  Itll be bad enough when
it comes

He was not wrong The pleasant days of towing ended all too soon
though the Haliotis trailed behind her a heavily weighted jib
stayed out into the shape of a pocket and Mr Wardrop was no
longer an artist of imagination but one of sevenandtwenty
prisoners in a prison full of insects The manofwar had towed
them to the nearest port not to the headquarters of the colony
and when Mr Wardrop saw the dismal little harbour with its
ragged line of Chinese junks its one crazy tug and the
boatbuilding shed that under the charge of a philosophical
Malay represented a dockyard he sighed and shook his head

I did well he said This is the habitation o wreckers an
thieves Were at the uttermost ends of the earth Think you
theyll ever know in England

Doesnt look like it said the skipper

They were marched ashore with what they stood up in under a
generous escort and were judged according to the customs of the
country which though excellent are a little out of date
There were the pearls there were the poachers and there sat a
small but hot Governor He consulted for a while and then
things began to move with speed for he did not wish to keep a
hungry crew at large on the beach and the manofwar had gone
up the coast With a wave of his hand  a stroke of the pen was
not necessary  he consigned them to the black gangtana the
backcountry and the hand of the Law removed them from his
sight and the knowledge of men They were marched into the
palms and the backcountry swallowed them up  all the crew of
the Haliotis

Deep peace continued to brood over Europe Asia Africa America

Australasia and Polynesia

It was the firing that did it They should have kept their
counsel but when a few thousand foreigners are bursting with
joy over the fact that a ship under the British flag has been
fired at on the high seas news travels quickly and when it
came out that the pearlstealing crew had not been allowed access
to their consul there was no consul within a few hundred miles
of that lonely port even the friendliest of Powers has a right
to ask questions The great heart of the British public was
beating furiously on account of the performance of a notorious
racehorse and had not a throb to waste on distant accidents
but somewhere deep in the hull of the ship of State there is
machinery which more or less accurately takes charge of foreign
affairs That machinery began to revolve and who so shocked and
surprised as the Power that had captured the Haliotis It
explained that colonial governors and faraway menofwar were
difficult to control and promised that it would most certainly
make an example both of the Governor and the vessel As for the
crew reported to be pressed into military service in tropical
climes it would produce them as soon as possible and it would
apologise if necessary Now no apologies were needed When
one nation apologises to another millions of amateurs who have
no earthly concern with the difficulty hurl themselves into the
strife and embarrass the trained specialist It was requested
that the crew be found if they were still alive  they had been
eight months beyond knowledge  and it was promised that all
would be forgotten

The little Governor of the little port was pleased with himself
Sevenandtwenty white men made a very compact force to throw
away on a war that had neither beginning nor end  a jungle and
stockade fight that flickered and smouldered through the wet hot
years in the hills a hundred miles away and was the heritage of
every wearied official He had he thought deserved well of his
country and if only some one would buy the unhappy Haliotis
moored in the harbour below his verandah his cup would be full
He looked at the neatly silvered lamps that he had taken from her
cabins and thought of much that might be turned to account But
his countrymen in that moist climate had no spirit They would
peep into the silent engineroom and shake their heads Even
the menofwar would not tow her further up the coast where the
Governor believed that she could be repaired She was a bad
bargain but her cabin carpets were undeniably beautiful and his
wife approved of her mirrors

Three hours later cables were bursting round him like shells
for though he knew it not he was being offered as a sacrifice
by the nether to the upper millstone and his superiors had no
regard for his feelings He had said the cables grossly
exceeded his power and failed to report on events He would
therefore  at this he cast himself back in his hammock 
produce the crew of the Haliotis He would send for them and
if that failed he would put his dignity on a pony and fetch
them himself He had no conceivable right to make pearlpoachers
serve in any war He would be held responsible

Next morning the cables wished to know whether he had found the
crew of the Haliotis They were to be found freed and fed  he
was to feed them  till such time as they could be sent to the
nearest English port in a manofwar If you abuse a man long
enough in great words flashed over the seabeds things happen
The Governor sent inland swiftly for his prisoners who were
also soldiers and never was a militia regiment more anxious to
reduce its strength No power short of death could make these
mad men wear the uniform of their service They would not
fight except with their fellows and it was for that reason the
regiment had not gone to war but stayed in a stockade
reasoning with the new troops The autumn campaign had been a
fiasco but here were the Englishmen All the regiment marched
back to guard them and the hairy enemy armed with blowpipes
rejoiced in the forest Five of the crew had died but there
lined up on the Governors verandah twoandtwenty men marked
about the legs with the scars of leechbites A few of them
wore fringes that had once been trousers the others used
loincloths of gay patterns and they existed beautifully but
simply in the Governors verandah and when he came out they
sang at him When you have lost seventy thousand pounds worth
of pearls your pay your ship and all your clothes and have
lived in bondage for five months beyond the faintest pretences
of civilisation you know what true independence means for you
become the happiest of created things  natural man

The Governor told the crew that they were evil and they asked
for food When he saw how they ate and when he remembered that
none of the pearl patrolboats were expected for two months he
sighed But the crew of the Haliotis lay down in the verandah
and said that they were pensioners of the Governors bounty A
greybearded man fat and baldheaded his one garment a
greenandyellow loincloth saw the Haliotis in the harbour
and bellowed for joy The men crowded to the verandahrail
kicking aside the long cane chairs They pointed gesticulated
and argued freely without shame The militia regiment sat down
in the Governors garden The Governor retired to his hammock 
it was as easy to be killed lying as standingand his women
squeaked from the shuttered rooms

She sold said the greybearded man pointing to the Haliotis
He was Mr Wardrop

No good said the Governor shaking his head No one come
buy

Hes taken my lamps though said the skipper He wore one leg
of a pair of trousers and his eye wandered along the verandah
The Governor quailed There were cuddy campstools and the
skippers writingtable in plain sight

Theyve cleaned her out o course said Mr Wardrop They
would Well go aboard and take an inventory See He waved his
hands over the harbour We  live  there  now Sorry

The Governor smiled a smile of relief

Hes glad of that said one of the crew reflectively I
shouldnt wonder

They flocked down to the harbourfront the militia regiment
clattering behind and embarked themselves in what they found 
it happened to be the Governors boat Then they disappeared
over the bulwarks of the Haliotis and the Governor prayed that
they might find occupation inside

Mr Wardrops first bound took him to the engineroom and when
the others were patting the wellremembered decks they heard
him giving God thanks that things were as he had left them The
wrecked engines stood over his head untouched no inexpert hand
had meddled with his shores the steel wedges of the storeroom
were rusted home and best of all the hundred and sixty tons of
good Australian coal in the bunkers had not diminished

I dont understand it said Mr Wardrop Any Malay knows the
use o copper They ought to have cut away the pipes And with
Chinese junks coming here too Its a special interposition o
Providence

You think so said the skipper from above Theres only been
one thief here and hes cleaned her out of all my things
anyhow

Here the skipper spoke less than the truth for under the
planking of his cabin only to be reached by a chisel lay a
little money which never drew any interest  his sheetanchor to
windward It was all in clean sovereigns that pass current the
world over and might have amounted to more than a hundred
pounds

Hes left me alone Lets thank God repeated Mr Wardrop

Hes taken everything else look

The Haliotis except as to her engineroom had been
systematically and scientifically gutted from one end to the
other and there was strong evidence that an unclean guard had
camped in the skippers cabin to regulate that plunder She
lacked glass plate crockery cutlery mattresses cuddy carpets
and chairs all boats and her copper ventilators These things
had been removed with her sails and as much of the wire rigging
as would not imperil the safety of the masts

He must have sold those said the skipper The other things
are in his house I suppose

Every fitting that could be pried or screwed out was gone Port
starboard and masthead lights teak gratings sliding sashes of
the deckhouse the captains chest of drawers with charts and
charttable photographs brackets and lookingglasses cabin
doors rubber cuddy mats hatchirons half the funnelstays
cork fenders carpenters grindstone and toolchest holystones
swabs squeegees all cabin and pantry lamps galleyfittings en
bloc flags and flaglocker clocks chronometers the forward
compass and the ships bell and belfry were among the missing

There were great scarred marks on the deckplanking over which
the cargoderricks had been hauled One must have fallen by the
way for the bulwarkrails were smashed and bent and the
sideplates bruised

Its the Governor said the skipper Hes been selling her on
the instalment plan

Lets go up with spanners and shovels and kill em all
shouted the crew Lets drown him and keep the woman

Then well be shot by that blackandtan regiment  our
regiment Whats the trouble ashore  Theyve camped our
regiment on the beach

Were cut off thats all Go and see what they want said Mr
Wardrop Youve the trousers

In his simple way the Governor was a strategist He did not
desire that the crew of the Haliotis should come ashore again
either singly or in detachments and he proposed to turn their
steamer into a convicthulk They would wait  he explained this
from the quay to the skipper in the barge  and they would
continue to wait till the manofwar came along exactly where
they were If one of them set foot ashore the entire regiment
would open fire and he would not scruple to use the two cannon
of the town Meantime food would be sent daily in a boat under
an armed escort The skipper bare to the waist and rowing
could only grind his teeth and the Governor improved the
occasion and revenged himself for the bitter words in the
cables by saying what he thought of the morals and manners of
the crew The barge returned to the Haliotis in silence and the
skipper climbed aboard white on the cheekbones and blue about
the nostrils

I knew it said Mr Wardrop and they wont give us good food
either We shall have bananas morning noon and night an a man
cant work on fruit We know that

Then the skipper cursed Mr Wardrop for importing frivolous
sideissues into the conversation and the crew cursed one
another and the Haliotis the voyage and all that they knew or
could bring to mind They sat down in silence on the empty
decks and their eyes burned in their heads The green harbour
water chuckled at them overside They looked at the palmfringed
hills inland at the white houses above the harbour road at the
single tier of native craft by the quay at the stolid soldiery
sitting round the two cannon and last of all at the blue bar
of the horizon Mr Wardrop was buried in thought and scratched
imaginary lines with his untrimmed fingernails on the planking

I make no promise he said at last for I cant say what may
or may not have happened to them But heres the ship and
heres us

There was a little scornful laughter at this and Mr Wardrop
knitted his brows He recalled that in the days when be wore
trousers he had been Chief Engineer of the Haliotis

Harland Mackesy Noble Hay Naughton Fink OHara Trumbull

Here sir The instinct of obedience waked to answer the
rollcall of the engineroom

Below

They rose and went

Captain Ill trouble you for the rest of the men as I want
them Well get my stores out and clear away the shores we
dont need and then well patch her up My men will remember
that theyre in the Haliotis  under me

He went into the engineroom and the others stared They were
used to the accidents of the sea but this was beyond their
experience None who had seen the engineroom believed that
anything short of new engines from end to end could stir the
Haliotis from her moorings

The engineroom stores were unearthed and Mr Wardrops face
red with the filth of the bilges and the exertion of travelling
on his stomach lit with joy The spare gear of the Haliotis had
been unusually complete and twoandtwenty men armed with
screwjacks differential blocks tackle vices and a forge or
so can look Kismet between the eyes without winking The crew
were ordered to replace the holdingdown and shaftbearing
bolts and return the collars of the thrustblock When they had
finished Mr Wardrop delivered a lecture on repairing compound
engines without the aid of the shops and the men sat about on
the cold machinery The crosshead jammed in the guides leered
at them drunkenly but offered no help They ran their fingers
hopelessly into the cracks of the starboard supportingcolumn
and picked at the ends of the ropes round the shores while Mr
Wardrops voice rose and fell echoing till the quick tropic
night closed down over the engineroom skylight

Next morning the work of reconstruction began It has been
explained that the foot of the connectingrod was forced against
the foot of the starboard supportingcolumn which it had cracked
through and driven outward towards the ships skin To all
appearance the job was more than hopeless for rod and column
seemed to have been welded into one But herein Providence
smiled on them for one moment to hearten them through the weary
weeks ahead The second engineer more reckless than resourceful
 struck at random with a cold chisel into the castiron of the
column and a greasy grey flake of metal flew from under the
imprisoned foot of the connectingrod while the rod itself fell
away slowly and brought up with a thunderous clang somewhere in
the dark of the crankpit The guidesplates above were still
jammed fast in the guides but the first blow had been struck
They spent the rest of the day grooming the donkeyengine which
stood immediately forward of the engineroom hatch Its
tarpaulin of course had been stolen and eight warm months had
not improved the working parts Further the last dying hiccup of
the Haliotis seemed  or it might have been the Malay from the
boathouse  to have lifted the thing bodily on its bolts and
set it down inaccurately as regarded its steam connections

If we only had one single cargoderrick Mr Wardrop sighed
We can take the cylindercover off by hand if we sweat but to
get the rod out o the pistons not possible unless we use
steam Well therell be steam the morn if theres nothing
else Shell fizzle

Next morning men from the shore saw the Haliotis through a cloud
for it was as though the deck smoked Her crew were chasing
steam through the shaken and leaky pipes to its work in the
forward donkeyengine and where oakum failed to plug a crack
they stripped off their loincloths for lapping and swore
halfboiled and mothernaked The donkeyengine worked  at a
price  the price of constant attention and furious stoking
worked long enough to allow a wirerope it was made up of a
funnel and a foremaststay to be led into the engineroom and
made fast on the cylindercover of the forward engine That rose
easily enough and was hauled through the skylight and on to the
deck many hands assisting the doubtful steam Then came the tug
of war for it was necessary to get to the piston and the jammed
pistonrod They removed two of the piston junkring studs
screwed in two strong iron eyebolts by way of handles doubled
the wirerope and set half a dozen men to smite with an
extemporised batteringram at the end of the pistonrod where it
peered through the piston while the donkeyengine hauled upwards
on the piston itself After four hours of this furious work the
pistonrod suddenly slipped and the piston rose with a jerk
knocking one or two men over into the engineroom But when Mr
Wardrop declared that the piston had not split they cheered and
thought nothing of their wounds and the donkeyengine was
hastily stopped its boiler was nothing to tamper with

And day by day their supplies reached them by boat The skipper
humbled himself once more before the Governor and as a
concession had leave to get drinkingwater from the Malay
boatbuilder on the quay It was not good drinkingwater but
the Malay was anxious to supply anything in his power if he were
paid for it

Now when the jaws of the forward engine stood as it were
stripped and empty they began to wedge up the shores of the
cylinder itself That work alone filled the better part of three
days  warm and sticky days when the hands slipped and sweat ran
into the eyes When the last wedge was hammered home there was
no longer an ounce of weight on the supportingcolumns and Mr
Wardrop rummaged the ship for boilerplate threequarters of an
inch thick where he could find it There was not much available
but what there was was more than beaten gold to him In one
desperate forenoon the entire crew naked and lean haled back
more or less into place the starboard supportingcolumn which
as you remember was cracked clean through Mr Wardrop found
them asleep where they had finished the work and gave them a
days rest smiling upon them as a father while he drew
chalkmarks about the cracks They woke to new and more trying
labour for over each one of those cracks a plate of
threequarterinch boileriron was to be worked hot the
rivetholes being drilled by hand All that time they were fed on
fruits chiefly bananas with some sago

Those were the days when men swooned over the ratchetdrill and
the handforge and where they fell they had leave to lie unless
their bodies were in the way of their fellows feet And so
patch upon patch and a patch over all the starboard
supportingcolumn was clouted but when they thought all was
secure Mr Wardrop decreed that the noble patchwork would never
support working engines at the best it could only hold the
guidebars approximately true The deadweight of the cylinders
must be borne by vertical struts and therefore a gang would
repair to the bows and take out with files the big bowanchor
davits each of which was some three inches in diameter They
threw hot coals at Wardrop and threatened to kill him those who
did not weep they were ready to weep on the least provocation
but he hit them with iron bars heated at the end and they limped
forward and the davits came with them when they returned They
slept sixteen hours on the strength of it and in three days two
struts were in place bolted from the foot of the starboard
supportingcolumn to the under side of the cylinder There
remained now the port or condensercolumn which though not so
badly cracked as its fellow had also been strengthened in four
places with boilerplate patches but needed struts They took
away the main stanchions of the bridge for that work and crazy
with toil did not see till all was in place that the rounded
bars of iron must be flattened from top to bottom to allow the
airpump levers to clear them It was Wardrops oversight and he
wept bitterly before the men as he gave the order to unbolt the
struts and flatten them with hammer and the flame Now the broken
engine was underpinned firmly and they took away the wooden
shores from under the cylinders and gave them to the robbed
bridge thanking God for even half a days work on gentle kindly
wood instead of the iron that had entered into their souls Eight
months in the backcountry among the leeches at a temperature of
84 degrees moist is very bad for the nerves

They had kept the hardest work to the last as boys save Latin
prose and worn though they were Mr Wardrop did not dare to
give them rest The pistonrod and connectingrod were to be
straightened and this was a job for a regular dockyard with
every appliance They fell to it cheered by a little chalk
showing of work done and time consumed which Mr Wardrop wrote
up on the engineroom bulkhead Fifteen days had gone fifteen
days of killing labour  and there was hope before them

It is curious that no man knows how the rods were straightened
The crew of the Haliotis remember that week very dimly as a
fever patient remembers the delirium of a long night There were
fires everywhere they say the whole ship was one consuming
furnace and the hammers were never still Now there could not
have been more than one fire at the most for Mr Wardrop
distinctly recalls that no straightening was done except under
his own eye They remember too that for many years voices gave
orders which they obeyed with their bodies but their minds were
abroad on all the seas It seems to them that they stood through
days and nights slowly sliding a bar backwards and forwards
through a white glow that was part of the ship They remember an
intolerable noise in their burning heads from the walls of the
stokehole and they remember being savagely beaten by men whose
eyes seemed asleep When their shift was over they would draw
straight lines in the air anxiously and repeatedly and would
question one another in their sleep crying Is she straight

At last  they do not remember whether this was by day or by
night  Mr Wardrop began to dance clumsily and wept the while
and they too danced and wept and went to sleep twitching all
over and when they woke men said that the rods were
straightened and no one did any work for two days but lay on
the decks and ate fruit Mr Wardrop would go below from time to
time and pat the two rods where they lay and they heard him
singing hymns

Then his trouble of mind went from him and at the end of the
third days idleness he made a drawing in chalk upon the deck
with letters of the alphabet at the angles He pointed out that
though the pistonrod was more or less straight the pistonrod
crosshead  the thing that had been jammed sideways in the
guides  had been badly strained and had cracked the lower end
of the pistonrod He was going to forge and shrink a
wroughtiron collar on the neck of the pistonrod where it joined
the crosshead and from the collar he would bolt a Yshaped
piece of iron whose lower arms should be bolted into the
crosshead If anything more were needed they could use up the
last of the boilerplate

So the forges were lit again and men burned their bodies but
hardly felt the pain The finished connection was not beautiful
but it seemed strong enough  at least as strong as the rest of
the machinery and with that job their labours came to an end
All that remained was to connect up the engines and to get food
and water The skipper and four men dealt with the Malay
boatbuilder by night chiefly it was no time to haggle over the
price of sago and dried fish The others stayed aboard and
replaced piston pistonrod cylindercover crosshead and
bolts with the aid of the faithful donkeyengine The
cylindercover was hardly steamproof and the eye of science
might have seen in the connectingrod a flexure something like
that of a Christmastree candle which has melted and been
straightened by hand over a stove but as Mr Wardrop said
She didnt hit anything

As soon as the last bolt was in place men tumbled over one
another in their anxiety to get to the hand startinggear the
wheel and worm by which some engines can be moved when there is
no steam aboard They nearly wrenched off the wheel but it was
evident to the blindest eye that the engines stirred They did
not revolve in their orbits with any enthusiasm as good
machines should indeed they groaned not a little but they
moved over and came to rest in a way which proved that they
still recognised mans hand Then Mr Wardrop sent his slaves
into the darker bowels of the engineroom and the stokehole and
followed them with a flarelamp The boilers were sound but
would take no harm from a little scaling and cleaning Mr
Wardrop would not have any one overzealous for he feared what
the next stroke of the tool might show The less we know about
her now said he the better for us all Im thinkin Yell
understand me when I say that this is in no sense regular
engineerin

As his raiment when he spoke was his grey beard and uncut hair
they believed him They did not ask too much of what they met
but polished and tallowed and scraped it to a false brilliancy

A lick of paint would make me easier in my mind said Mr
Wardrop plaintively I know half the condensertubes are
started and the propellershaftin s God knows how far out of
the true and well need a new airpump an the mainsteam
leaks like a sieve and theres worse each way I look but 
paints like clothes to a man an ours is near all gone

The skipper unearthed some stale ropy paint of the loathsome
green that they used for the galleys of sailingships and Mr
Wardrop spread it abroad lavishly to give the engines
selfrespect

His own was returning day by day for he wore his loincloth
continuously but the crew having worked under orders did not
feel as he did The completed work satisfied Mr Wardrop He
would at the last have made shift to run to Singapore and gone
home without vengeance taken to show his engines to his brethren
in the craft but the others and the captain forbade him They
had not yet recovered their selfrespect

It would be safer to make what ye might call a trial trip but
beggars mustnt be choosers an if the engines will go over to
the handgear the probability  Im only saying its a
probability the chance is that theyll hold up when we put steam
on her

How long will you take to get steam said the skipper

God knows Four hours  a day  half a week If I can raise
sixty pound Ill not complain

Be sure of her first we cant afford to go out half a mile and
break down

My soul and body man were one continuous breakdown fore an
aft We might fetch Singapore though

Well break down at PygangWatai where we can do good was the
answer in a voice that did not allow argument Shes my boat
and  Ive had eight months to think in

No man saw the Haliotis depart though many heard her She left
at two in the morning having cut her moorings and it was none
of her crews pleasure that the engines should strike up a
thundering halfseasover chanty that echoed among the hills
Mr Wardrop wiped away a tear as he listened to the new song

Shes gibberin  shes just gibberin he whimpered Yons
the voice of a maniac

And if engines have any soul as their masters believe he was
quite right There were outcries and clamours sobs and bursts
of chattering laughter silences where the trained ear yearned
for the clear note and torturing reduplications where there
should have been one deep voice Down the screwshaft ran
murmurs and warnings while a heartdiseased flutter without
told that the propeller needed rekeying

How does she make it said the skipper

She moves but  but shes breakin my heart The sooner were
at PygangWatai the better Shes mad and were waking the
town

Is she at all near safe

What do I care how safe she is Shes mad Hear that now To
be sure nothings hittin anything and the bearins are fairly
cool but  can ye not hear

If she goes said the skipper I dont care a curse And shes
my boat too

She went trailing a fathom of weed behind her From a slow two
knots an hour she crawled up to a triumphant four Anything
beyond that made the struts quiver dangerously and filled the
engineroom with steam Morning showed her out of sight of land
and there was a visible ripple under her bows but she
complained bitterly in her bowels and as though the noise had
called it there shot along across the purple sea a swift dark
proa hawklike and curious which presently ranged alongside
and wished to know if the Haliotis were helpless Ships even
the steamers of the white men had been known to break down in
those waters and the honest Malay and Javanese traders would
sometimes aid them in their own peculiar way But this ship was
not full of lady passengers and welldressed officers Men
white naked and savage swarmed down her sides  some
withredhot iron bars and others with large hammers  threw
themselves upon those innocent inquiring strangers and before
any man could say what had happened were in full possession of
the proa while the lawful owners bobbed in the water overside
Half an hour later the proas cargo of sago and trepang as well
as a doubtfulminded compass was in the Haliotis The two huge
triangular mat sails with their seventyfoot yards and booms
had followed the cargo and were being fitted to the stripped
masts of the steamer

They rose they swelled they filled and the empty steamer
visibly laid over as the wind took them They gave her nearly
three knots an hour and what better could men ask But if she
had been forlorn before this new purchase made her horrible to
see Imagine a respectable charwoman in the tights of a
balletdancer rolling drunk along the streets and you will come
to some faint notion of the appearance of that ninehundredton
welldecked once schoonerrigged cargoboat as she staggered
under her new help shouting and raving across the deep With
steam and sail that marvellous voyage continued and the
brighteyed crew looked over the rail desolate unkempt
unshorn shamelessly clothed beyond the decencies

At the end of the third week she sighted the island of
PygangWatai whose harbour is the turningpoint of a pearl
seapatrol Here the gunboats stay for a week ere they retrace
their line There is no village at PygangWatai only a stream
of water some palms and a harbour safe to rest in till the
first violence of the southeast monsoon has blown itself out
They opened up the low coral beach with its mound of
whitewashed coal ready for supply the deserted huts for the
sailors and the flagless flagstaff

Next day there was no Haliotis  only a little proa rocking in
the warm rain at the mouth of the harbour whose crew watched
with hungry eyes the smoke of a gunboat on the horizon

Months afterwards there were a few lines in an English newspaper
to the effect that some gunboat of some foreign Power had broken
her back at the mouth of some faraway harbour by running at full
speed into a sunken wreck

End of the DEVIL and THE DEEP SEA



WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR

PART I

I have done one braver thing
Than all the worthies did
And yet a braver thence doth spring
Which is to keep that hid
The Undertaking

Is it officially declared yet

Theyve gone as far as to admit extreme local scarcity and
theyve started reliefworks in one or two districts the paper
says

That means it will be declared as soon as they can make sure of
the men and the rollingstock Shouldnt wonder if it were as
bad as the 78 Famine

Cant be said Scott turning a little in the long cane chair

Weve had fifteenanna crops in the north and Bombay and
Bengal report more than they know what to do with Theyll be
able to check it before it gets out of hand It will only be
local

Martyn picked the Pioneer from the table read through the
telegrams once more and put up his feet on the chairrests It
was a hot dark breathless evening heavy with the smell of the
newly watered Mall The flowers in the Club gardens were dead and
black on their stalks the little lotuspond was a circle of
caked mud and the tamarisktrees were white with the dust of
weeks Most of the men were at the bandstand in the public
gardens  from the Club verandah you could hear the native Police
band hammering stale waltzes  or on the pologround or in the
highwalled fivescourt hotter than a Dutch oven Half a dozen
grooms squatted at the heads of their ponies waited their
masters return From time to time a man would ride at a
footpace into the Club compound and listlessly loaf over to the
whitewashed barracks beside the main building These were
supposed to be chambers Men lived in them meeting the same
white faces night after night at dinner and drawing out their
officework till the latest possible hour that they might escape
that doleful company

What are you going to do said Martyn with a yawn Lets
have a swim before dinner

Waters hot I was at the bath today

Play you game o billiards  fifty up

Its a hundred and five in the hall now Sit still and dont be
so abominably energetic

A grunting camel swung up to the porch his badged and belted
rider fumbling a leather pouch

Kubberkargazkiyektraaa the man whined handing down the
newspaper extra  a slip printed on one side only and damp from
the press It was pinned up on the greenbaize board between
notices of ponies for sale and foxterriers missing

Martyn rose lazily read it and whistled Its declared he
cried One two three  eight districts go under the
operations of the Famine Code ek dum Theyve put Jimmy Hawkins
in charge

Good business said Scott with the first sign of interest he
had shown When in doubt hire a Punjabi I worked under Jimmy
when I first came out and he belonged to the Punjab He has more
bundobust than most men

Jimmys a Jubilee Knight now said MartynHes a good chap
even though he is a thriceborn civilian and went to the
Benighted Presidency What unholy names these Madras districts
rejoice in  all ungas or rungas or pillays or polliums

A dogcart drove up in the dusk and a man entered mopping his
head He was editor of the one daily paper at the capital of a
Province of twentyfive million natives and a few hundred white
men as his staff was limited to himself and one assistant his
officehours ran variously from ten to twenty a day

Hi Raines youre supposed to know everything said Martyn
stopping him Hows this Madras scarcity going to turn out

No one knows as yet Theres a message as long as your arm
coming in on the telephone Ive left my cub to fill it out
Madras has owned she cant manage it alone and Jimmy seems to
have a free hand in getting all the men he needs Arbuthnots
warned to hold himself in readiness

Badger Arbuthnot

The Peshawur chap Yes and the Pi wires that Ellis and Clay
have been moved from the Northwest already and theyve taken
half a dozen Bombay men too Its pukka famine by the looks
of it

Theyre nearer the scene of action than we are but if it comes
to indenting on the Punjab this early theres more in this than
meets the eye said Martyn

Here today and gone tomorrow Didnt come to stay for ever
said Scott dropping one of Marryats novels and rising to his
feet Martyn your sisters waiting for you

A rough grey horse was backing and shifting at the edge of the
verandah where the light of a kerosene lamp fell on a
browncalico habit and a white face under a greyfelt hat

Right O said Martyn Im ready Better come and dine with
us if youve nothing to do Scott William is there any
dinner in the house

Ill go home and see was the riders answer You can drive
him over  at eight remember

Scott moved leisurely to his room and changed into the
eveningdress of the season and the country spotless white
linen from head to foot with a broad silk cummerbund Dinner
at the Martyns was a decided improvement on the goatmutton
twineytough fowl and tinned entrees of the Club But it was a
great pity that Martyn could not afford to send his sister to
the hills for the hot weather As an Acting District
Superintendent of Police Martyn drew the magnificent pay of six
hundred depreciated silver rupees a month and his little
fourroomed bungalow said just as much There were the usual
blueandwhitestriped jailmade rugs on the uneven floor the
usual glassstudded Amritsar phulkaris draped on nails driven
into the flaking whitewash of the walls the usual halfdozen
chairs that did not match picked up at sales of dead mens
effects and the usual streaks of black grease where the leather
punkathong ran through the wall It was as though everything
had been unpacked the night before to be repacked next morning
Not a door in the house was true on its hinges The little
windows fifteen feet up were darkened with waspnests and
lizards hunted flies between the beams of the woodceiled roof
But all this was part of Scotts life Thus did people live who
had such an income and in a land where each mans pay age and
position are printed in a book that all may read it is hardly
worth while to play at pretence in word or deed Scott counted
eight years service in the Irrigation Department and drew eight
hundred rupees a month on the understanding that if he served
the State faithfully for another twentytwo years he could retire
on a pension of some four hundred rupees a month His
workinglife which had been spent chiefly under canvas or in
temporary shelters where a man could sleep eat and write
letters was bound up with the opening and guarding of irrigation
canals the handling of two or three thousand workmen of all
castes and creeds and the payment of vast sums of coined silver

He had finished that spring not without credit the last section
of the great Mosuhl Canal and  much against his will for he
hated officework  had been sent in to serve during the hot
weather on the accounts and supply side of the Department with
sole charge of the sweltering suboffice at the capital of the
Province Martyn knew this William his sister knew it and
everybody knew it Scott knew too as well as the rest of the
world that Miss Martyn had come out to India four years ago to
keep house for her brother who as every one knew had borrowed
the money to pay for her passage and that she ought as all the
world said to have married at once In stead of this she had
refused some half a dozen subalterns a Civilian twenty years her
senior one Major and a man in the Indian Medical Department
This too was common property She had stayed down three hot
weathers as the saying is because her brother was in debt and
could not afford the expense of her keep at even a cheap
hillstation Therefore her face was white as bone and in the
centre of her forehead was a big silvery scar about the size of a
shilling  the mark of a Delhi sore which is the same as a
Bagdad date This comes from drinking bad water and slowly
eats into the flesh till it is ripe enough to be burned out

None the less William had enjoyed herself hugely in her four
years Twice she had been nearly drowned while fording a river
once she had been run away with on a camel had witnessed a
midnight attack of thieves on her brothers camp had seen
justice administered with long sticks in the open under trees
could speak Urdu and even rough Punjabi with a fluency that was
envied by her seniors had entirely fallen out of the habit of
writing to her aunts in England or cutting the pages of the
English magazines had been through a very bad cholera year
seeing sights unfit to be told and had wound up her experiences
by six weeks of typhoid fever during which her head had been
shaved and hoped to keep her twentythird birthday that
September It is conceivable that the aunts would not have
approved of a girl who never set foot on the ground if a horse
were within hail who rode to dances with a shawl thrown over her
skirt who wore her hair cropped and curling all over her head
who answered indifferently to the name of William or Bill whose
speech was heavy with the flowers of the vernacular who could
act in amateur theatricals play on the banjo rule eight
servants and two horses their accounts and their diseases and
look men slowly and deliberately between the eyes  even after
they had proposed to her and been rejected

I like men who do things she had confided to a man in the
Educational Department who was teaching the sons of
clothmerchants and dyers the beauty of Wordsworths Excursion
in annotated crambooks and when he grew poetical William
explained that she didnt understand poetry very much it made
her head ache and another broken heart took refuge at the
Club But it was all Williams fault She delighted in hearing
men talk of their own work and that is the most fatal way of
bringing a man to your feet

Scott had known her for some three years meeting her as a rule
under canvass when his camp and her brothers joined for a day
on the edge of the Indian Desert He had danced with her several
times at the big Christmas gatherings when as many as five
hundred white people came in to the station and had always a
great respect for her housekeeping and her dinners

She looked more like a boy than ever when the meal ended she
sat rolling cigarettes her low forehead puckered beneath the
dark curls as she twiddled the papers and stuck out her rounded
chin when the tobacco stayed in place or with a gesture as
true as a schoolboys throwing a stone tossed the finished
article across the room to Martyn who caught it with one hand
and continued his talk with Scott It was all shop  canals
and the policing of canals the sins of villagers who stole more
water than they had paid for and the grosser sin of native
constables who connived at the thefts of the transplanting
bodily of villages to newly irrigated ground and of the coming
fight with the desert in the south when the Provincial funds
should warrant the opening of the longsurveyed Luni Protective
Canal System And Scott spoke openly of his great desire to be
put on one particular section of the work where he knew the land
and the people and Martyn sighed for a billet in the Himalayan
foothills and said his mind of his superiors and William
rolled cigarettes and said nothing but smiled gravely on her
brother because he was happy

At ten Scotts horse came to the door and the evening was ended

The lights of the two low bungalows in which the daily paper was
printed showed bright across the road It was too early to try
to find sleep and Scott drifted over to the editor Raines
stripped to the waist like a sailor at a gun lay half asleep in
a long chair waiting for night telegrams He had a theory that
if a man did not stay by his work all day and most of the night
he laid himself open to fever so he ate and slept among his
files

Can you do it be said drowsily I didnt mean to bring you
over

About what  Ive been dining at the Martyns

The Madras famine of course Martyns warned too Theyre
taking men where they can find em I sent a note to you at the
Club just now asking if you could do us a letter once a week
from the south  between two and three columns say Nothing
sensational of course but just plain facts about who is doing
what and so forth Our regular rates  ten rupees a column

Sorry but its out of my line Scott answered staring
absently at the map of India on the wall Its rough on Martyn
 very Wonder what helldo with his sister Wonder what the
deuce theyll do with me Ive no famine experience This is the
first Ive heard of it Am I ordered

Oh yes Heres the wire Theyll put you on to reliefworks
Raines said with a horde of Madrassis dying like flies one
native apothecary and half a pint of choleramixture among the
ten thousand of you It comes of your being idle for the moment
Every man who isnt doing two mens work seems to have been
called upon Hawkins evidently believes in Punjabis Its going
to be quite as bad as anything they have had in the last ten
years

Its all in the days work worse luck I suppose I shall get my
orders officially some time tomorrow Im awfully glad I
happened to drop in Better go and pack my kit now Who
relieves me here  do you know

Raines turned over a sheaf of telegrams McEuan said he from
Murree

Scott chuckled He thought he was going to be cool all summer
Hell be very sick about this Well no good talking Night

Two hours later Scott with a clear conscience laid himself
down to rest on a string cot in a bare room Two worn bullock
trunks a leather waterbottle a tin icebox and his pet
saddle sewed up in sacking were piled at the door and the Club
secretarys receipt for last months bill was under his pillow
His orders came next morning and with them an unofficial
telegram from Sir James Hawkins who was not in the habit of
forgetting good men when he had once met them bidding him
report himself with all speed at some unpronounceable place
fifteen hundred miles to the south for the famine was sore in
the land and white men were needed

A pink and fattish youth arrived in the redhot noonday
whimpering a little at fate and famines which never allowed any
one three months peace He was Scotts successor  another cog
in the machinery moved forward behind his fellow whose
services as the official announcement ran were placed at the
disposal of the Madras Government for famine duty until further
orders Scott handed over the funds in his charge showed him
the coolest corner in the office warned him against excess of
zeal and as twilight fell departed from the Club in a hired
carriage with his faithful bodyservant Faiz Ullah and a
mound of disordered baggage atop to catch the southern mail at
the loopholed and bastioned railwaystation The heat from the
thick brick walls struck him across the face as if it had been a
hot towel and he reflected that there were at least five nights
and four days of this travel before him Faiz Ullah used to the
chances of service plunged into the crowd on the stone
platform while Scott a black cheroot between his teeth waited
till his compartment should be set away A dozen native
policemen with their rifles and bundles shouldered into the
press of Punjabi farmers Sikh craftsmen and greasylocked
Afreedee pedlars escorting with all pomp Martyns uniformcase
waterbottles icebox and beddingroll They saw Faiz Ullahs
lifted hand and steered for it

My Sahib and your Sahib said Faiz Ullah to Martyns man will
travel together Thou and I O brother will thus secure the
servants places close by and because of our masters authority
none will dare to disturb us

When Faiz Ullah reported all things ready Scott settled down at
full length coatless and bootless on the broad leathercovered
bunk The heat under the ironarched roof of the station might
have been anything over a hundred degrees At the last moment
Martyn entered dripping

Dont swear said Scott lazily its too late to change your
carriage and well divide the ice

What are you doing here said the policeman

Im lent to the Madras Government same as you By Jove its a
bender of a night Are you taking any of your men down

A dozen I suppose I shall have to superintend relief
distributions Didnt know you were under orders too

I didnt till after I left you last night Raines had the news
first My orders came this morning McEuan relieved me at four
and I got off at once Shouldnt wonder if it wouldnt be a
good thing this famine  if we come through it alive

Jimmy ought to put you and me to work together said Martyn
and then after a pause My sisters here

Good business said Scott heartily Going to get off at
Umballa I suppose and go up to Simla Wholl she stay with
there

Noo thats just the trouble of it Shes going down with me

Scott sat bolt upright under the oillamps as the train jolted
past TarnTaran What You dont mean you couldnt afford 

Taint that Id have scraped up the money somehow

You might have come to me to begin with said Scott stiffly
we arent altogether strangers

Well you neednt be stuffy about it I might but  you dont
know my sister Ive been explaining and exhorting and all the
rest of it all day  lost my temper since seven this morning
and havent got it back yetbut she wouldnt hear of any
compromise A womans entitled to travel with her husband if she
wants to and William says shes on the same footing You see
weve been together all our lives more or less since my people
died It isnt as if she were an ordinary sister

All the sisters Ive ever heard of would have stayed where they
were well off

Shes as clever as a man confound  Martyn went on She broke
up the bungalow over my head while I was talking at her
Settled the whole thing in three hours  servants horses and
all I didnt get my orders till nine

Jimmy Hawkins wont be pleased said Scott A famines no place
for a woman

Mrs Jim  I mean Lady Jims in camp with him At any rate she
says she will look after my sister William wired down to her on
her own responsibility asking if she could come and knocked the
ground from under me by showing me her answer

Scott laughed aloud If she can do that she can take care of
herself and Mrs Jim wont let her run into any mischief There
arent many women sisters or wives who would walk into a
famine with their eyes open It isnt as if she didnt know
what these things mean She was through the Jalo cholera last
year

The train stopped at Amritsar and Scott went back to the ladies
compartment immediately behind their carriage William with a
cloth ridingcap on her curls nodded affably

Come in and have some tea she said Best thing in the world
for heatapoplexy

Do I look as if I were going to have heatapoplexy

Never can tell said William wisely Its always best to be
ready

She had arranged her compartment with the knowledge of an old
campaigner A feltcovered waterbottle hung in the draught of
one of the shuttered windows a teaset of Russian china packed
in a wadded basket stood on the seat and a travelling
spiritlamp was clamped against the woodwork above it

William served them generously in large cups hot tea which
saves the veins of the neck from swelling inopportunely on a hot
night It was characteristic of the girl that her plan of
action once settled she asked for no comments on it Life among
men who had a great deal of work to do and very little time to
do it in had taught her the wisdom of effacing as well as of
fending for herself She did not by word or deed suggest that
she would be useful comforting or beautiful in their travels
but continued about her business serenely put the cups back
without clatter when tea was ended and made cigarettes for her
guests

This time last night said Scott we didnt expect  er  this
kind of thing did we

Ive learned to expect anything said William You know in
our service we live at the end of the telegraph but of
course this ought to be a good thing for us all departmentally
 if we live

It knocks us out of the running in our own Province Scott
replied with equal gravity I hoped to be put on the Luni
Protective Works this cold weather but theres no saying how
long the famine may keep us

Hardly beyond October I should think said Martyn It will be
ended one way or the other then

And weve nearly a week of this said William Shant we be
dusty when its over

For a night and a day they knew their surroundings and for a
night and a day skirting the edge of the great Indian Desert on
a narrowgauge railway they remembered how in the days of their
apprenticeship they had come by that road from Bombay Then the
languages in which the names of the stations were written
changed and they launched south into a foreign land where the
very smells were new Many long and heavily laden graintrains
were in front of them and they could feel the hand of Jimmy
Hawkins from far off They waited in extemporised sidings while
processions of empty trucks returned to the north and were
coupled on to slow crawling trains and dropped at midnight
Heaven knew where but it was furiously hot and they walked to
and fro among sacks and dogs howled Then they came to an India
more strange to them than to the untravelled Englishman  the
flat red India of palmtree palmyrapalm and rice  the India
of the picturebooks of Little Harry and His Bearer  all dead
and dry in the baking heat They had left the incessant
passengertraffic of the north and west far and far behind them
Here the people crawled to the side of the train holding their
little ones in their arms and a loaded truck would be left
behind the men and women clustering round it like ants by
spilled honey Once in the twilight they saw on a dusty plain a
regiment of little brown men each bearing a body over his
shoulder and when the train stopped to leave yet another truck
they perceived that the burdens were not corpses but only
foodless folk picked up beside dead oxen by a corps of Irregular
troops Now they met more white men here one and there two
whose tents stood close to the line and who came armed with
written authorities and angry words to cut off a truck They were
too busy to do more than nod at Scott and Martyn and stare
curiously at William who could do nothing except make tea and
watch how her men staved off the rush of wailing walking
skeletons putting them down three at a time in heaps with their
own hands uncoupling the marked trucks or taking receipts from
the holloweyed weary white men who spoke another argot
than theirs They ran out of ice out of sodawater and out of
tea for they were six days and seven nights on the road and it
seemed to them like seven times seven years

At last in a dry hot dawn in a land of death lit by long red
fires of railwaysleepers where they were burning the dead
they came to their destination and were met by Jim Hawkins the
Head of the Famine unshaven unwashed but cheery and entirely
in command of affairs

Martyn he decreed then and there was to live on trains till
further orders was to go back with empty trucks filling them
with starving people as he found them and dropping them at a
faminecamp on the edge of the Eight Districts He would pick
up supplies and return and his constables would guard the loaded
graincars also picking up people and would drop them at a
camp a hundred miles south Scott Hawkins was very glad to see
Scott again  would that same hour take charge of a convoy of
bullockcarts and would go south feeding as he went to yet
another faminecamp where he would leave his starving there
would he no lack of starving on the route  and wait for orders
by telegraphGenerally Scott was in all small things to act as
he thought best

William bit her under lip There was no one in the wide world
like her one brother but Martyns orders gave him no discretion

She came out on the platform masked with dust from head to foot
a horseshoe wrinkle on her forehead put here by much thinking
during the past week but as selfpossessed as ever Mrs Jim 
who should have been Lady Jim but that no one remembered the
title  took possession of her with a little gasp

Oh Im so glad youre here she almost sobbed You oughtnt
to of course but there there isnt another woman in the
place and we must help each other you know and weve all the
wretched people and the little babies they are selling

Ive seen some said William

Isnt it ghastly Ive bought twenty theyre in our camp but
wont you have something to eat first Weve more than ten
people can do here and Ive got a horse for you Oh Im so
glad youve come dear Youre a Punjabi too you know

Steady Lizzie said Hawkins over his shoulder Well look
after you Miss Martyn Sorry I cant ask you to breakfast
Martyn Youll have to eat as you go Leave two of your men to
help Scott These poor devils cant stand up to load carts
Saunders this to the enginedriver who was half asleep in the
cab back down and get those empties away Youve line clear
to Anundrapillay theyll give you orders north of that Scott
load up your carts from that B P P truck and be off as soon
as you can The Eurasian in the pink shirt is your interpreter
and guide Youll find an apothecary of sorts tied to the yoke of
the second wagon Hes been trying to bolt youll have to look
after him Lizzie drive Miss Martyn to camp and tell them to
send the red horse down here for me

Scott with Faiz Ullah and two policemen was already busied with
the carts backing them up to the truck and unbolting the
sideboards quietly while the others pitched in the bags of
millet and wheat Hawkins watched him for as long as it took to
fill one cart

Thats a good man he said If all goes well I shall work him
hard This was Jim Hawkinss notion of the highest compliment
one human being could pay another

An hour later Scott was under way the apothecary threatening him
with the penalties of the law for that he a member of the
Subordinate Medical Department had been coerced and bound
against his will and all laws governing the liberty of the
subject the pinkshirted Eurasian begging leave to see his
mother who happened to be dying some three miles away Only
verree verree short leave of absence and will presently
return sar  the two constablesarmed with staves bringing
up the rear and Faiz Ullah a Mohammedans contempt for all
Hindoos and foreigners in every line of his face explaining to
the drivers that though Scott Sahib was a man to be feared on
all fours he Faiz Ullah was Authority Itself

The procession creaked past Hawkinss camp  three stained tents
under a clump of dead trees behind them the famineshed where
a crowd of hopeless ones tossed their arms around the
cookingkettles

Wish to Heaven William had kept out of it said Scott to
himself after a glance Well have cholera sure as a gun
when the Rains break

But William seemed to have taken kindly to the operations of the
Famine Code which when famine is declared supersede the
workings of the ordinary law Scott saw her the centre of a mob
of weeping women in a calico ridinghabit and a bluegrey felt
hat with a gold puggaree

I want fifty rupees please I forgot to ask Jack before he
went away Can you lend it me Its for condensedmilk for the
babies said she

Scott took the money from his belt and handed it over without a
word For goodness sake take care of yourself he said

Oh I shall be all right We ought to get the milk in two days
By the way the orders are I was to tell you that youre to
take one of Sir Jims horsesTheres a grey Cabuli here that I
thought would be just your style so Ive said youd take him
Was that right

Thats awfully good of you We cant either of us talk much
about style I am afraid

Scott was in a weatherstained drill shootingkit very white at
the seams and a little frayed at the wrists William regarded
him thoughtfully from his pith helmet to his greased
ankleboots You look very nice I think Are you sure youve
everything youll need  quinine chlorodyne and so on

Think so said Scott patting three or four of his
shootingpockets as he mounted and rode alongside his convoy

Goodbye he cried

Goodbye and good luck said William Im awfully obliged for
the money She turned on a spurred heel and disappeared into
the tent while the carts pushed on past the faminesheds past
the roaring lines of the thick fat fires down to the baked
Gehenna of the South

End of WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR  PART I



WILLIAM THE CONQUERER

PART II

So let us melt and make no noise No tearfloods nor
sightempests move Twere profanation of our joys to tell the
Laity our love A Valediction

It was punishing work even though he travelled by night and
camped by day but within the limits of his vision there was no
man whom Scott could call master He was as free as Jimmy
Hawkins  freer in fact for the Government held the Head of
the Famine tied neatly to a telegraphwire and if Jimmy had ever
regarded telegrams seriously the deathrate of that famine
would have been much higher than it was

At the end of a few days crawling Scott learned something of the
size of the India which he served and it astonished him His
carts as you know were loaded with wheat millet and barley
good foodgrains needing only a little grinding But the people
to whom he brought the lifegiving stuffs were riceeaters They
could hull rice in their mortars but they knew nothing of the
heavy stone querns of the North and less of the material that
the white man convoyed so laboriously They clamoured for rice 
unhusked paddy such as they were accustomed to  and when they
found that there was none broke away weeping from the sides of
the cart What was the use of these strange hard grains that
choked their throats They would die And then and there very
many of them kept their word Others took their allowance and
bartered enough millet to feed a man through a week for a few
handfuls of rotten rice saved by some less unfortunate A few put
their share into the ricemortars pounded it and made a paste
with foul water but they were very few Scott understood dimly
that many people in the India of the South ate rice as a rule
but he had spent his service in a grain Province had seldom seen
rice in the blade or ear and least of all would have believed
that in time of deadly need men could die at arms length of
plenty sooner than touch food they did not know In vain the
interpreters interpreted in vain his two policemen showed in
vigorous pantomime what should be done The starving crept away
to their bark and weeds grubs leaves and clay and left the
open sacks untouched But sometimes the women laid their phantoms
of children at Scotts feet looking back as they staggered away

Faiz Ullah opined it was the will of God that these foreigners
should die and it remained only to give orders to burn the
dead None the less there was no reason why the Sahib should lack
his comforts and Faiz Ullah a campaigner of experience had
picked up a few lean goats and had added them to the procession
That they might give milk for the morning meal he was feeding
them on the good grain that these imbeciles rejected Yes said
Faiz Ullah if the Sahib thought fit a little milk might be
given to some of the babies but as the Sahib well knew babies
were cheap and for his own part Faiz Ullah held that there was
no Government order as to babies Scott spoke forcefully to Faiz
Ullah and the two policemen and bade them capture goats where
they could find them This they most joyfully did for it was a
recreation and many ownerless goats were driven in Once fed
the poor brutes were willing enough to follow the carts and a
few days good food  food such as human beings died for lack of
 set them in milk again

But I am no goatherd said Faiz Ullah It is against my izzat
my honour

When we cross the Bias River again we will talk of izzat Scott
replied Till that day thou and the policemen shall be sweepers
to the camp if I give the order

Thus then it is done grunted Faiz Ullah if the Sahib will
have it so and he showed how a goat should be milked while
Scott stood over him

Now we will feed them said Scott twice a day we will feed
them and he bowed his back to the milking and took a horrible
cramp

When you have to keep connection unbroken between a restless
mother of kids and a baby who is at the point of death you
suffer in all your system But the babies were fed Each morning
and evening Scott would solemnly lift them out one by one from
their nest of gunnybags under the carttilts There were always
many who could do no more than breathe and the milk was dropped
into their toothless mouths drop by drop with due pauses when
they choked Each morning too the goats were fed and since
they would straggle without a leader and since the natives were
hirelings Scott was forced to give up riding and pace slowly at
the head of his flocks accommodating his step to their
weaknesses All this was sufficiently absurd and he felt the
absurdity keenly but at least he was saving life and when the
women saw that their children did not die they made shift to eat
a little of the strange foods and crawled after the carts
blessing the master of the goats

Give the women something to live for said Scott to himself as
he sneezed in the dust of a hundred little feet and theyll
hang on somehow This beats Williams condensedmilk trick all to
pieces I shall never live it down though

He reached his destination very slowly found that a riceship
had come in from Burmah and that stores of paddy were
available found also an overworked Englishman in charge of the
shed and loading the carts set back to cover the ground he
had already passed He left some of the children and half his
goats at the famineshed For this he was not thanked by the
Englishman who had already more stray babies than he knew what
to do with Scotts back was suppled to stooping now and he
went on with his wayside ministrations in addition to
distributing the paddy More babies and more goats were added
unto him but now some of the babies wore rags and beads round
their wrists or necks That said the interpreter as though
Scott did not know signifies that their mothers hope in
eventual contingency to resume them offeecially

The sooner the better said Scott but at the same time he
marked with the pride of ownership how this or that little
Ramasawmy was putting on flesh like a bantam As the
paddycarts were emptied he headed for Hawkinss camp by the
railway timing his arrival to fit in with the dinnerhour for
it was long since he had eaten at a cloth He had no desire to
make any dramatic entry but an accident of the sunset ordered
it that when he had taken off his helmet to get the evening
breeze the low light should fall across his forehead and he
could not see what was before him while one waiting at the tent
door beheld with new eyes a young man beautiful as Paris a god
in a halo of golden dust walking slowly at the head of his
flocks while at his knee ran small naked Cupids But she
laughed  William in a slatecoloured blouse laughed
consumedly till Scott putting the best face he could upon the
matter halted his armies and bade her admire the kindergarten
It was an unseemly sight but the proprieties had been left ages
ago with the teaparty at Amritsar Station fifteen hundred
miles to the north

They are coming on nicely said William Weve only
fiveandtwenty here now The women are beginning to take them
away again

Are you in charge of the babies then

Yes  Mrs Jim and I We didnt think of goats though Weve
been trying condensedmilk and water

Any losses

More than I care to think of said William with a shudder
And you

Scott said nothing There had been many little burials along his
route  one cannot burn a dead baby  many mothers who had wept
when they did not find again the children they had trusted to
the care of the Government

Then Hawkins came out carrying a razor at which Scott looked
hungrily for he had a beard that he did not love And when
they sat down to dinner in the tent he told his tale in few
words as it might have been an official report Mrs Jim
snuffled from time to time and Jim bowed his head judicially
but Williams grey eyes were on the cleanshaven face and it
was to her that Scott seemed to appeal

Good for the Pauper Province said William her chin on her
hand as she leaned forward among the wineglasses Her cheeks
had fallen in and the scar on her forehead was more prominent
than ever but the wellturned neck rose roundly as a column
from the ruffle of the blouse which was the accepted
eveningdress in camp

It was awfully absurd at times said Scott You see I didnt
know much about milking or babies Theyll chaff my head off if
the tale goes up North

Let em said William haughtily Weve all done cooliework
since we came I know Jack has This was to Hawkinss address
and the big man smiled blandly

Your brothers a highly efficient officer William said he
and Ive done him the honour of treating him as he deserves
Remember I write the confidential reports

Then you must say that Williams worth her weight in gold said
Mrs Jim I dont know what we should have done without her She
has been everything to us She dropped her hand upon Williams
which was rough with much handling of reins and William patted
it softly Jim beamed on the company Things were going well with
his world Three of his more grossly incompetent men had died
and their places had been filled by their betters Every day
brought the Rains nearer They had put out the famine in five of
the Eight Districts and after all the deathrate had not been
too heavy  things considered He looked Scott over carefully as
an ogre looks over a man and rejoiced in his thews and ironhard
condition

Hes just the least bit in the world tucked up said Jim to
himself but he can do two mens work yet Then he was aware
that Mrs Jim was telegraphing to him and according to the
domestic code the message ran A clear case Look at them

He looked and listened All that William was saying was What
can you expect of a country where they call a bhistee a
watercarrier a tunnicutch and all that Scott answered was
I shall be glad to get back to the Club Save me a dance at the
Christmas Ball wont you

Its a far cry from here to the Lawrence Hall said Jim
Better turn in early Scott Its paddycarts tomorrow
youll begin loading at five

Arent you going to give Mr Scott a single days rest

Wish I could Lizzie but Im afraid I cant As long as he can
stand up we must use him

Well Ive had one Europe evening at least By Jove Id nearly
forgotten What do I do about those babies of mine

Leave them here said William  we are in charge of that  and
as many goats as you can spare I must learn how to milk now

If you care to get up early enough tomorrow Ill show you I
have to milk you see Half of em have beads and things round
their necks You must be careful not to take em off in case
the mothers turn up

You forget Ive had some experience here

I hope to goodness you wont overdo Scotts voice was
unguarded

Ill take care of her said Mrs Jim telegraphing hundredword
messages as she carried William off while Jim gave Scott his
orders for the coming campaign It was very late  nearly nine
oclock

Jim youre a brute said his wife that night and the Head of
the Famine chuckled

Not a bit of it dear I remember doing the first Jandiala
Settlement for the sake of a girl in a crinoline and she was
slender Lizzie Ive never done as good a piece of work since
Hell work like a demon

But you might have given him one day

And let things come to a head now No dear its their
happiest time

I dont believe either of the darlings know whats the matter
with them Isnt it beautiful Isnt it lovely

Getting up at three to learn to milk bless her heart Oh ye
Gods why must we grow old and fat

Shes a darling She has done more work under me 

Under you The day after she came she was in charge and you
were her subordinate Youve stayed there ever since she
manages you almost as well as you manage me

She doesnt and thats why I love her Shes as direct as a
man  as her brother

Her brothers weaker than she is Hes always to me for orders
but hes honest and a glutton for work I confess Im rather
fond of William and if I had a daughter 

The talk ended Far away in the Derajat was a childs grave more
than twenty years old and neither Jim nor his wife spoke of it
any more

All the same youre responsible Jim added a moments silence

Bless em said Mrs Jim sleepily

Before the stars paled Scott who slept in an empty cart waked
and went about his work in silence it seemed at that hour
unkind to rouse Faiz Ullah and the interpreter His head being
close to the ground he did not hear William till she stood over
him in the dingy old ridinghabit her eyes still heavy with
sleep a cup of tea and a piece of toast in her hands There
was a baby on the ground squirming on a piece of blanket and a
sixyearold child peered over Scotts shoulder

Hai you little rip said Scott how the deuce do you expect
to get your rations if you arent quiet

A cool white hand steadied the brat who forthwith choked as the
milk gurgled into his mouth

Mornin said the milker Youve no notion how these little
fellows can wriggle

Oh yes I have She whispered because the world was asleep
Only I feed them with a spoon or a rag Yours are fatter than
mine And youve been doing this day after day The voice was
almost lost

Yes it was absurd Now you try he said giving place to the
girl Look out A goats not a cow

The goat protested against the amateur and there was a scuffle
in which Scott snatched up the baby Then it was all to do over
again and William laughed softly and merrily She managed
however to feed two babies and a third

Dont the little beggars take it well said Scott I trained
em

They were very busy and interested when lo it was broad
daylight and before they knew the camp was awake and they
kneeled among the goats surprised by the day both flushed to
the temples Yet all the round world rolling up out of the
darkness might have heard and seen all that had passed between
them

Oh said William unsteadily snatching up the tea and toast
I had this made for you Its stonecold now I thought you
mightnt have anything ready so early Better not drink it
Its  its stonecold

Thats awfully kind of you Its just right Its awfully good
of you really Ill leave my kids and goats with you and Mrs
Jim and of course any one in camp can show you about the
milking

Of course said William and she grew pinker and pinker and
statelier and more stately as she strode back to her tent
fanning herself with the saucer

There were shrill lamentations through the camp when the elder
children saw their nurse move off without them Faiz Ullah
unbent so far as to jest with the policemen and Scott turned
purple with shame because Hawkins already in the saddle
roared

A child escaped from the care of Mrs Jim and running like a
rabbit clung to Scotts boot William pursuing with long easy
strides

I will not go  I will not go shrieked the child twining his
feet round Scotts ankle They will kill me here I do not know
these people

I say said Scott in broken Tamil I say she will do you no
harm Go with her and be well fed

Come said William panting with a wrathful glance at Scott
who stood helpless and as it were hamstrung

Go back said Scott quickly to William Ill send the little
chap over in a minute

The tone of authority had its effect but in a way Scott did not
exactly intend The boy loosened his grasp and said with
gravity I did not know the woman was thine I will go Then
he cried to his companions a mob of three four and
fiveyearolds waiting on the success of his venture ere they
stampeded Go back and eat It is our mans woman She will
obey his orders

Jim collapsed where he sat Faiz Ullah and the two policemen
grinned and Scotts orders to the cartmen flew like hail

That is the custom of the Sahibs when truth is told in their
presence said Faiz Ullah The time comes that I must seek new
service Young wives especially such as speak our language and
have knowledge of the ways of the Police make great trouble for
honest butlers in the matter of weekly accounts

What William thought of it all she did not say but when her
brother ten days later came to camp for orders and heard of
Scotts performances he said laughing Well that settles it
Hell be Bakri Scott to the end of his days Bakri in the
Northern vernacular means a goat What a lark Id have given
a months pay to have seen him nursing famine babies I fed some
with conjee ricewater but that was all right

Its perfectly disgusting said his sister with blazing eyes
A man does something like like that  and all you other men
think of is to give him an absurd nickname and then you laugh
and think its funny

Ah said Mrs Jim sympathetically

Well you cant talk William You christened little Miss Demby
the Buttonquail last cold weather you know you did Indias
the land of nicknames

Thats different William replied She was only a girl and
she hadnt done anything except walk like a quail and she does
But it isnt fair to make fun of a man

Scott wont care said Martyn You cant get a rise out of old
Scotty Ive been trying for eight years and youve only known
him for three How does he look

He looks very well said William and went away with a flushed
cheek Bakri Scott indeed Then she laughed to herself for
she knew her country But it will he Bakri all the same and
she repeated it under her breath several times slowly
whispering it into favour

When he returned to his duties on the railway Martyn spread the
name far and wide among his associates so that Scott met it as
he led his paddycarts to war The natives believed it to be
some English title of honour and the cartdrivers used it in
all simplicity till Faiz Ullah who did not approve of foreign
japes broke their heads There was very little time for milking
now except at the big camps where Jim had extended Scotts
idea and was feeding large flocks on the useless northern
grains Sufficient paddy had come now into the Eight Districts
to hold the people safe if it were only distributed quickly
and for that purpose no one was better than the big Canal
officer who never lost his temper never gave an unnecessary
order and never questioned an order given Scott pressed on
saving his cattle washing their galled necks daily so that no
time should be lost on the road reported himself with his rice
at the minor faminesheds unloaded and went back light by
forced nightmarch to the next distributing centre to find
Hawkinss unvarying telegram Do it again And he did it
again and again and yet again while Jim Hawkins fifty miles
away marked off on a big map the tracks of his wheels
gridironing the stricken lands Others did well  Hawkins
reported at the end they all did well  but Scott was the most
excellent for he kept good coined rupees by him settled for
his own cartrepairs on the spot and ran to meet all sorts of
unconsidered extras trusting to be recouped later on
Theoretically the Government should have paid for every shoe
and iinchpin for every hand employed in the loading but
Government vouchers cash themselves slowly and intelligent and
efficient clerks write at great length contesting unauthorised
expenditures of eight annas The man who wants to make his work
a success must draw on his own bankaccount of money or other
things as he goes

I told you hed work said Jimmy to his wife at the end of six
weeks Hes been in sole charge of a couple of thousand men up
north on the Mosuhl Canal for a year but he gives less
trouble than young Martyn with his ten constables and Im
morally certain  only Government doesnt recognise moral
obligations  hes spent about half his pay to grease his
wheels Look at this Lizzie for one weeks work Forty miles
in two days with twelve carts two days halt building a
famineshed for young Rogers Rogers ought to have built it
himself the idiot Then forty miles back again loading six
carts on the way and distributing all Sunday Then in the
evening he pitches in a twentypage DemiOfficial to me saying
the people where he is might be advantageously employed on
reliefwork and suggesting that he put em to work on some
brokendown old reservoir hes discovered so as to have a good
watersupply when the Rains break Thinks he can cauk the dam
in a fortnight Look at his marginal sketches  arent they
clear and good  I knew he was pukka but I didnt know he was
as pukka as this

I must show these to William said Mrs Jim The childs
wearing herself out among the babies

Not more than you are dear Well another two months ought to
see us out of the wood Im sorry its not in my power to
recommend you for a V C

William sat late in her tent that night reading through page
after page of the square handwriting patting the sketches of
proposed repairs to the reservoir and wrinkling her eyebrows
over the columns of figures of estimated watersupplyAnd he
finds time to do all this she cried to herself andwell I
also was present Ive saved one or two babies

She dreamed for the twentieth time of the god in the golden dust
and woke refreshed to feed loathsome black children scores of
them wastrels picked up by the wayside their bones almost
breaking their skin terrible and covered with sores

Scott was not allowed to leave his cartwork but his letter was
duly forwarded to the Government and he had the consolation
not rare in India of knowing that another man was reaping where
he had sown That also was discipline profitable to the soul

Hes much too good to waste on canals said Jimmy Any one can
oversee coolies You neednt be angry William he can  but I
need my pearl among bullockdrivers and Ive transferred him to
the Khanda district where hell have it all to do over again He
should be marching now

Hes not a coolie said William furiously He ought to be
doing his regulation work

Hes the best man in his service and thats saying a good deal
but if you must use razors to cut grindstones why I prefer the
best cutlery

Isnt it almost time we saw him again said Mrs Jim Im sure
the poor boy hasnt had a respectable meal for a month He
probably sits on a cart and eats sardines with his fingers

All in good time dear Duty before decency  wasnt it Mr
Chucks said that

No it was Midshipman Easy William laughed I sometimes
wonder how it will feel to dance or listen to a band again or
sit under a roof I cant believe I ever wore a ballfrock in my
life

One minute said Mrs Jim who was thinking If he goes to
Khanda he passes within five miles of us Of course hell ride
in

Oh no he wont said William

How do you know dear

It will take him off his work He wont have time

Hell make it said Mrs Jim with a twinkle

 It depends on his own judgment Theres absolutely no reason
why he shouldnt if he thinks fit said Jim

He wont see fit William replied without sorrow or emotion
It wouldnt be him if he did

One certainly gets to know people rather well in times like
these said Jim drily but Williams face was serene as ever
and even as she prophesied Scott did not appear

The Rains fell at last late but heavily and the dry gashed
earth was red mud and servants killed snakes in the camp where
every one was weatherbound for a fortnight  all except
Hawkins who took horse and plashed about in the wet rejoicing
Now the Government decreed that seedgrain should be distributed
to the people as well as advances of money for the purchase of
new oxen and the white men were doubly worked for this new duty
while William skipped from brick to brick laid down on the
trampled mud and dosed her charges with warming medicines that
made them rub their little round stomachs and the milch goats
throve on the rank grass There was never a word from Scott in
the Khanda district away to the southeast except the regular
telegraphic report to Hawkins The rude country roads had
disappeared his drivers were half mutinous one of Martyns
loaned policemen had died of cholera and Scott was taking thirty
grains of quinine a day to fight the fever that comes with the
rain but those were things Scott did not consider necessary to
report He was as usual working from a base of supplies on a
railway line to cover a circle of fifteen miles radius and
since full loads were impossible he took quarterloads and
toiled four times as hard by consequence for he did not choose
to risk an epidemic which might have grown uncontrollable by
assembling villagers in thousands at the reliefsheds It was
cheaper to take Government bullocks work them to death and
leave them to the crows in the wayside sloughs

That was the time when eight years of clean living and hard
condition told though a mans head were ringing like a bell
from the cinchona and the earth swayed under his feet when he
stood and under his bed when he slept If Hawkins had seen fit
to make him a bullockdriver that he thought was entirely
Hawkinss own affair There were men in the North who would
know what he had done men of thirty years service in his own
department who would say that it was not half bad and above
immeasurably above all men of all grades there was William in
the thick of the fight who would approve because she understood
He had so trained his mind that it would hold fast to the
mechanical routine of the day though his own voice sounded
strange in his own ears and his hands when he wrote grew
large as pillows or small as peas at the end of his wrists That
steadfastness bore his body to the telegraphoffice at the
railwaystation and dictated a telegram to Hawkins saying that
the Khanda district was in his judgment now safe and he
waited further orders

The Madrassee telegraphclerk did not approve of a large gaunt
man falling over him in a dead faint not so much because of the
weight as because of the names and blows that Faiz Ullah dealt
him when he found the body rolled under a bench Then Faiz Ullah
took blankets quilts and coverlets where he found them and lay
down under them at his masters side and bound his arms with a
tentrope and filled him with a horrible stew of herbs and set
the policeman to fight him when he wished to escape from the
intolerable heat of his coverings and shut the door of the
telegraphoffice to keep out the curious for two nights and one
day and when a light engine came down the line and Hawkins
kicked in the door Scott hailed him weakly but in a natural
voice and Faiz Ullah stood back and took all the credit

For two nights Heavenborn he was pagal said Faiz Ullah
Look at my nose and consider the eye of the policeman He beat
us with his bound hands but we sat upon him Heavenborn and
though his words were tez we sweated him Heavenborn never has
been such a sweat He is weaker now than a child but the fever
has gone out of him by the grace of God There remains only my
nose and the eye of the constabeel Sahib shall I ask for my
dismissal because my Sahib has beaten me And Faiz Ullah laid
his long thin hand carefully on Scotts chest to be sure that the
fever was all gone ere he went out to open tinned soups and
discourage such as laughed at his swelled nose

The districts all right Scott whispered It doesnt make
any difference You got my wire I shall be fit in a week
Cant understand how it happened I shall be fit in a few
days

Youre coming into camp with us said Hawkins

But look here  but 

Its all over except the shouting We shant need you Punjabis
any more On my honour we shant Martyn goes back in a few
weeks Arbuthnots returned already Ellis and Clay are putting
the last touches to a new feederline the Governments built as
reliefwork Mortens dead  he was a Bengal man though you
wouldnt know him Pon my word you and Will  Miss Martyn 
seem to have come through it as well as anybody Oh how is
she bytheway The voice went up and down as he spoke

Going strong when I left her The Roman Catholic Missions are
adopting the unclaimed babies to turn them into little priests
the Basil Mission is taking some and the mothers are taking the
rest You should hear the little beggars howl when theyre sent
away from William Shes pulled down a bit but so are we all
Now when do you suppose youll be able to move

I cant come into camp in this state I wont he replied
pettishly

Well you are rather a sight but from what I gathered there it
seemed to me theyd be glad to see you under any conditions
Ill look over your work here if you like for a couple of
days and you can pull yourself together while Faiz Ullah feeds
you up

Scott could walk dizzily by the time Hawkinss inspection was
ended and he flushed all over when Jim said of his work that it
was not half bad and volunteered further that he had
considered Scott his righthand man through the famine and
would feel it his duty to say as much officially

So they came back by rail to the old camp but there were no
crowds near it the long fires in the trenches were dead and
black and the faminesheds were almost empty

You see said Jim There isnt much more to do Better ride
up and see the wife Theyve pitched a tent for you Dinners at
seven Ive some work here

Riding at a footpace Faiz Ullah by his stirrup Scott came to
William in the browncalico ridinghabit sitting at the
diningtent door her hands in her lap white as ashes thin and
worn with no lustre in her hair There did not seem to be any
Mrs Jim on the horizon and all that William could say was My
word how pulled down you look

Ive had a touch of fever You dont look very well yourself

Oh Im fit enough Weve stamped it out I suppose you know

Scott nodded We shall all be returned in a few weeks Hawkins
told me

Before Christmas Mrs Jim says Shant you be glad to go back
 I can smell the woodsmoke already William sniffed We
shall be in time for all the Christmas doings I dont suppose
even the Punjab Government would be base enough to transfer Jack
till the new year

It seems hundreds of years ago  the Punjab and all that 
doesnt it Are you glad you came

Now its all over yes It has been ghastly here though You
know we had to sit still and do nothing and Sir Jim was away so
much

Do nothing How did you get on with the milking

I managed it somehow  after you taught me Remember

Then the talk stopped with an almost audible jar Still no Mrs
Jim

That reminds me I owe you fifty rupees for the condensedmilk
I thought perhaps youd be coming here when you were transferred
to the Khanda district and I could pay you then but you
didnt

I passed within five miles of the camp but it was in the middle
of a march you see and the carts were breaking down every few
minutes and I couldnt get em over the ground till ten oclock
that night I wanted to come awfully You knew I did didnt
you

I  believe  I  did said William facing him with level
eyes She was no longer white

Did you understand

Why you didnt ride in Of course I did

WhyBecause you couldnt of course I knew that

Did you care

If you had come in  but I knew you wouldnt  but if you had I
should have cared a great deal You know I should

Thank God I didnt Oh but I wanted to I couldnt trust myself
to ride in front of the carts because I kept edging em over
here dont you know

I knew you wouldnt said William contentedly Heres your
fifty

Scott bent forward and kissed the hand that held the greasy
notes Its fellow patted him awkwardly but very tenderly on the
head

And you knew too didnt you said William in a new voice

No on my honour I didnt I hadnt the  the cheek to expect
anything of the kind except   I say were you out riding
anywhere the day I passed by to Khanda

William nodded and smiled after the manner of an angel surprised
in a good deed

Then it was just a speck I saw of your habit in the 

Palmgrove on the Southern cartroad I saw your helmet when you
came up from the mullah by the temple  just enough to be sure
that you were all right D you care

This time Scott did not kiss her hand for they were in the dusk
of the diningtent and because Williams knees were trembling
under her she had to sit down in the nearest chair where she
wept long and happily her head on her arms and when Scott
imagined that it would be well to comfort her she needing
nothing of the kind she ran to her own tent and Scott went out
into the world and smiled upon it largely and idiotically But
when Faiz Ullah brought him a drink he found it necessary to
support one hand with the other or the good whisky and soda
would have been spilled abroad There are fevers and fevers

But it was worse  much worse  the strained eyeshirking talk
at dinner till the servants had withdrawn and worst of all when
Mrs Jim who had been on the edge of weeping from the soup down
kissed Scott and William and they drank one whole bottle of
champagne hot because there was no ice and Scott and William
sat outside the tent in the starlight till Mrs Jim drove them in
for fear of more fever

Apropos of these things and some others William said Being
engaged is abominable because you see one has no official
position We must be thankful weve lots of things to do

Things to do said Jim when that was reported to him
Theyre neither of them any good any more I cant get five
hours work a day out of Scott Hes in the clouds half the
time

Oh but theyre so beautiful to watch Jimmy It will break my
heart when they go Cant you do anything for him

Ive given the Government the impression  at least I hope I
have  that he personally conducted the entire famine But all
he wants is to get on to the Luni Canal Works and Williams
just as bad Have you ever heard em talking of barrage and
aprons and wastewater  Its their style of spooning I
suppose

Mrs Jim smiled tenderly Ah thats in the intervals  bless
em

And so Love ran about the camp unrebuked in broad daylight while
men picked up the pieces and put them neatly away of the Famine
in the Eight Districts

Morning brought the penetrating chill of the Northern December
the layers of woodsmoke the dusty greyblue of the tamarisks
the domes of ruined tombs and all the smell of the white
Northern plains as the mailtrain ran on to the milelong Sutlej
Bridge William wrapped in a poshteen  a silkembroidered
sheepskin jacket trimmed with rough astrakhan  looked out with
moist eyes and nostrils that dilated joyously The South of
pagodas and palmtrees the overpopulated Hindu South was done
with Here was the land she knew and loved and before her lay
the good life she understood among folk of her own caste and
mind

They were picking them up at almost every station now  men and
women coming in for the Christmas Week with racquets with
bundles of polosticks with dear and bruised cricketbats with
foxterriers and saddles The greater part of them wore jackets
like Williams for the Northern cold is as little to be trifled
with as the Northern heat And William was among them and of
them her hands deep in her pockets her collar turned up over
her ears stamping her feet on the platforms as she walked up and
down to get warm visiting from carriage to carriage and
everywhere being congratulated Scott was with the bachelors at
the far end of the train where they chaffed him mercilessly
about feeding babies and milking goats but from time to time he
would stroll up to Williams window and murmur Good enough
isnt it and William would answer with sighs of pure delight
Good enough indeed The large open names of the home towns
were good to listen to Umballa Ludianah Phillour Jullundur
they rang like the coming marriagebells in her ears and William
felt deeply and truly sorry for all strangers and outsiders 
visitors tourists and those freshcaught for the service of the
country

It was a glorious return and when the bachelors gave the
Christmas Ball William was unofficially you might say the
chief and honoured guest among the Stewards who could make
things very pleasant for their friends She and Scott danced
nearly all the dances together and sat out the rest in the big
dark gallery overlooking the superb teak floor where the
uniforms blazed and the spurs clinked and the new frocks and
four hundred dancers went round and round till the draped flags
on the pillars flapped and bellied to the whirl of it

About midnight half a dozen men who did not care for dancing came
over from the Club to play Waits and that was a surprise the
Stewards had arranged  before any one knew what had happened
the band stopped and hidden voices broke into Good King
Wenceslaus and William in the gallery hummed and beat time with
her foot

Mark my footsteps well my page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt feel the winters rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly


Oh I hope they are going to give us another Isnt it pretty
coming out of the dark in that way Look  look down Theres
Mrs Gregory wiping her eyes

Its like Home rather said Scott I remember 

Hsh Listen  dear And it began again

When shepherds watched their flocks by night 

Ahh said William drawing closer to Scott

All seated on the ground
The Angel of the Lord came down
And glory shone around
Fear not said he for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled mind
Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind

This time it was William that wiped her eyes

End of WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR  PART II



THE SON OF HIS FATHER

It is a queer name Mrs Strickland admitted and none of our
family have ever borne it but you see he is the first man to
us

So he was called Adam and to that world about him he was the
first of men  a manchild alone Heaven sent him no Eve for a
companion but all earth horse and foot was at his feet As
soon as he was old enough to appear in public he held a levee
and Stricklands sixty policemen with their sixty clanking
sabres bowed to the dust before him When his fingers closed a
little on Imam Dins swordhilt they rose and roared  till Adam
roared too and was withdrawn

Now that was no cry of fear said Imam Din afterwards
speaking to his companions in the Police Lines He was angry 
and so young Brothers he will make a very strong Police
officer

Does the Memsahib give him the breast said a new Phillour
recruit the dye smell not yet out of his yellow cotton uniform

Ho said an upcountry Naik scornfully It has not been known
for more than ten days that my woman suckles him He curled his
moustaches as lordly as ever an Inspector could afford to do for
he knew that the husband of the fostermother of the son of the
District Superintendent of Police was a man sure of
consideration

I am glad said Imam Din loosening his belt Those who drink
our blood become of our own blood and I have seen in these
thirty years that the sons of the Sahibs once being born here
return when they are men Yes they return after they have been
to Belait Europe

And what do they do in Belait asked the recruit respectfully

Get instruction  which thou hast not returned the Naik Also
they drink of belaiteepanee sodawater enough to give them
that devils restlessness which endures for all their lives
Whence we of Hind have trouble

My fathers uncle said Imam Din slowly with importance was
Ressaldar of the Longcoat Horse and the Empress called him to
Belait in the year that she had accomplished fifty years of
rule He said and there were also other witnesses that the
Sahibs there drink common water even as do we and that the
belaiteepanee does not run in all the rivers

He said also that there was a Shish Mahal  half a glass palace
 half a koss in length and that the railgbarri ran under the
roads and that there are boats bigger than a village He is a
great talker The Naik spoke scornfully He had no wellborn
uncles

He is a man of good birth said Imam Din with the least
possible emphasis on the first word and the Naik was silent

Ho ho Imam Din reached out to his pipe chuckling until his
fat sides shook again Strickland Sahibs fostermother was the
wife of an Arain in the Ferozepur district I was a young man
then ploughing while the English fought This child will also be
suckled here and he will have double wisdom and when he is a
Police officer it will be very bad for the thieves in this
illakha

There will be no English in the land then They are asking
permission of clerks and lowcaste men to continue their rule
even now said the Naik

All but foolish men  such as those clerks are  would know that
this asking is but an excuse for making trouble and thus
holding the country more strictly Now in an investigation is
it not our custom to permit the villagers to talk loosely and
give us abuse for a little time Then do we not grow hot and
walk them to the thana two by two  as these clerks will be
walked Thus do I read the new talk

So do not I said the Naik who borrowed the native
newspapers

Because thou art young and wast born in time of peace I saw
the year that was to end the English rule Men said it was
ended indeed and that all could now take their neighbours
cattle This I saw ploughing and I was minded to fight too
being a young man My father sent me to Gurgaon to buy cattle
and I saw the tents of Van Corlin Sahib1 in the wheat and I
saw that he was going up and down collecting the revenue
neither abating nor increasing it though Delhi was all afire
and the Sahibs lay dead about the fields I have seen what I have
seen This Raj will not be talked down and he who builds on the
present madness of the Sahiblog which O Naik covers great
cunning builds for himself a lockup My fathers uncle has seen
their country and he says that he is afraid as never he feared
before So Strickland Sahibs boy will come back to this country
and his son after him Naik have they named him yet

The butler spoke to my household having heard the talk at
table and he says that they will call him Adam and no
jawsplitting English name Uddaam The padre will name him at
their church in due time1 Van Cortland

Who can tell the ways of Sahibs Now Strickland Sahib knows
more of the Faith than ever I had time to learnprayers charms
names and stories of the Blessed Ones Yet he is not a
Musalman said Imam Din thoughtfully

For the reason that he knows as much of the gods of Hindustan
and so rides with a rein in each hand Remember that he sat
under the Baba Atall a fakir among fakirs for ten days
whereby a man came to be hanged for the murder of the
dancinggirl on the night of the great earthquake said the
Naik

True  it is true  and yet    they are one day so wise the
Sahibs and another so foolish But he has named the child well
Adam Huzrut Adam Ho ho Father Adam we must call him

And all who minister to the child said the Naik quietly but
with meaning will come to great honour

Adam throve being prayed over before the gods of at least three
creeds in a garden almost as fair as Eden There were gigantic
clumps of bamboo that talked continually and enormous plantains
on whose soft paper skin he could scratch with his nails green
domes of mangotrees as huge as the dome of St Pauls full of
parrots as big as cassowaries and grey squirrels the size of
foxes At the end of the garden stood a hedge of flaming
poinsettias higher than anything in the world because
childlike Adams eye could not carry to the tops of the
mangotrees Their green went out against the blue sky but the
red poinsettias he could just see A nurse who talked
continually about snakes and pulled him back from the mouth of a
fascinating dry well and a mother who believed that the sun hurt
little heads were the only drawbacks to this loveliness But as
his legs grew under him he found that by scaling an enormous
rampart three feet of brokendown mud wall at the end of the
garden  he could come into a readymade kingdom where every one
was his slave Imam Din showed him the way one evening and the
police troopers cooking their supper received him with rapture
and gave him pieces of very indigestible but altogether
delightful spiced bread

Here he sat or sprawled in the horsefeed where the police horses
were picketed in a double line and he named them men and
beasts together according to his ideas and experiences as his
First Father had done before him In those days everything had a
name from the mud mangers to the heelropes for things were
people to Adam exactly as people are things to folk in their
second childhood Through all the conferences  one hand twisted
into Imam Dins beard and the other on his polished beltbuckle
 there were two other people who came and went across the talk 
Death and Sickness  persons stronger than Imam Din and stronger
than the heelroped stallions There was Mata the smallpox a
woman in some way connected with pigs and Heza the cholera a
black man according to Adam and Booka starvation and Kismet
who quietly settled all questions from the choking of a pet
mungoose in the kitchen drain to the absence of a young
policeman who once missed a parade and never came back It was
all very wonderful to Adam but not worth much thinking over for
a childs mind is bounded by his eyes exactly as a horses view
of the road is limited by blinkers Between all these
objectionable shadowy vagrants stood a ring of kind faces and
strong arms and Mata and Heza would never touch Adam the first
of men Kismet might do so because  and this was a mystery no
staring into the lookingglass would solve  Kismet who was a
man was also written like police orders for the day in or on
Adams head Imam Din could not explain how this might be and
it was from that grey fat Muhammadan that Adam learned through
every inflection the Khuda janta God knows that settled
everything in his mind

Beyond the fact that Khuda was a very good man and kept lions
Adams theology did not run far Mrs Strickland tried to teach
him a few facts but he revolted at the story of Genesis as
untrue A turtle he said upheld the world and onehalf the
adventures of Huzrut Nu Father Noah had never been told If
Mamma wanted to hear them she must ask Imam Din Adam had heard
of a saint who had made wooden cakes and pressed them to his
stomach when he felt hungry and the Feeding of the Multitude did
not impress him So it came about that a reading of miracle
stories generally ended in a monologue by Adam on other and much
more astonishing miracles

Its awful said Mrs Strickland half crying to think of his
growing up like a little heathen Mrs Strickland Miss Youghal
that was if you remember her had been born and brought up in
England and did not quite understand things

Let him alone said Strickland hell grow out of it all or
it will only come back to him in dreamsAre you sure said
his wife to whom Stricklands least word was pure truth

Quite I was sent home when I was seven and they flicked it
out of me with a wet towel at Harrow Public schools dont
encourage anything that isnt quite English

Mrs Strickland shuddered for she had been trying not to think
of the separation that follows motherhood in India and makes
life there for all that is written to the contrary not quite
the most desirable thing in the world Adam trotted out to hear
about more miracles and his nurse must have worried him beyond
bounds for she came back weeping saying that Adam Baba was in
danger of being eaten alive by wild horses

As a matter of fact he had shaken off Juma by bolting between a
couple of picketed horses and lying down under their bellies
That they were personal friends of his Juma did not understand
nor Strickland either Adam was settled at ease when his father
arrived breathless and white and the stallions put back their
ears and squealed

If you come here said Adam they will hit you kicks Tell
Juma I have eaten my rice and wish to be alone

Come out at once said Strickland for the horses were
beginning to paw violently

Why should I obey Jumas order She is afraid of horses

It is not Jumas order It is mine Obey

Ho said Adam Juma did not tell me that And he crawled out
on all fours among the shod feet Mrs Strickland was crying
bitterly with fear and excitement and as a sacrifice to the
home gods Adam had to be whipped He said with perfect justice
There was no order that I should not sit with the horses and
they are my horses Why is there this tamasha

Stricklands face showed him that the whipping was coming and
the child turned white Motherlike Mrs Strickland left the
room but Juma the fostermother stayed to see

Am I to be whipped here he gasped

Of course

Before that woman Father I am a man I am not afraid It is my
izzat  my honour

Strickland only laughed to this day I cannot imagine what
possessed him and gave Adam the little taptap with a
ridingcane that was whipping sufficient for his years

When it was all over Adam said quietly I am little and you
are big If I stayed among my horse folk I should not have been
whipped You are afraid to go there

The merest chance led me to Stricklands house that afternoon
When I was halfway down the drive Adam passed me without
recognition at a fast run I caught one glimpse of his face
under his big hat and it was the face of his father as I had
once seen that in the grey of morning when it bent above a
leper I caught the child by the shoulder

Let me go he screamed and he and I were the best of friends
as a rule Let me go

Where to Father Adam He was quivering like a newhaltered
colt

To the well I have been beaten I have been beaten before
women Let me go He tried to bite my hand

That is a small matter I said Men are horn to beatings

Thou hast never been beaten he said savagely

Indeed I have Times past counting

Before women

My mother and the ayah saw By women too for that matter What
of it

What didst thou do He stared beyond my shoulder up the long
drive

It is long ago and I have forgotten I was older than thou art
but even then I forgot and now the thing is but a jest to be
talked of

Adam drew one big breath and broke down utterly in my arms Then
he raised his head and his eyes were Stricklands eyes when
Strickland gave orders

Ho Imam Din

The fat orderly seemed to spring out of the earth at our feet
crashing through the bushes and standing to attention

Hast thou ever been beaten said AdamAssuredly By my father
when I was thirty years old He beat me with a ploughbeam before
all the women of the villageWherefore

Because I had returned to the village on leave from the
Government service and had said of the village elders that they
had not seen the world Therefore he beat me to show that no
seeing of the world changed father and son

And thou

I stood up He was my father

Good said Adam and turned on his heel without another word

Imam Din looked after him An elephant breeds but once in a
lifetime but he breeds elephants Yet I am glad I am no father
of tuskers said he

What is it all I asked

His father beat him with a whip no bigger than a reed But the
child could not have done what he desired to do without leaping
through me And I am of some few pounds weight Look

Imam Din stepped back through the bushes and the pressed grass
showed that he had been lying curled round the mouth of the dry
well

When there was talk of beating I knew that one who sat among
horses such as ours was not like to kiss his fathers hand So
I lay down in this place We both stood still looking at the
wellcurb

Adam came back along the garden path to us I have spoken to my
father he said simply Imam Din tell thy Naik that his woman
is dismissed my service

Huzoor said Imam Din stooping low

For no fault of hers

Protector of the Poor

And today

Khodawund

It is an order Go

Again the salute and Imam Din departed with that same set of
the back which he wore when he had taken an order from
Strickland I thought that it would be well to go too but
Strickland beckoned me from the verandah When I came up he was
perfectly white and rocking to and fro in his chair repeated
Good God half a dozen times

Do you know that he was going to chuck himself down the well 
because I tapped him just now  he said helplessly

I ought to I replied He has just dismissed his nurse  on
his own authority I suppose

He told me just now that he wouldnt have her for a nurse any
more I never supposed he meant it for an instant I suppose
shell have to go

It is written elsewhere that Strickland was feared through the
length and breadth of the Punjab by murderers horsethieves
and cattlelifters

Adam returned halting outside the verandah very white about the
lips

I have sent away Juma because she saw that  that which
happened Until she is gone I do not come in the house he
said

But to send away thy fostermother  said Strickland with
reproach

I do not send her away It is thy blame and the small
forefinger was pointed to Strickland I will not obey her I
will not eat from her hand and I will not sleep with her Send
her away

Strickland stepped out and lifted the child into the verandah

This folly has lasted long enough he said Come now and be
wise

I am little and you are big said Adam between set teeth
You can beat me before this man or cut me to pieces But I will
not have Juma for my ayah any more I will not eat till she goes
I swear it by  my fathers head

Strickland sent him indoors to his mother and we could hear
sounds of weeping and Adams voice saying nothing more than
Send Juma away Presently Juma came in and wept too and Adam
repeated It is no fault of thine but go

And the end of it was that Juma went with all her belongings
and Adam fought his own way alone into his little clothes until
a new ayah came His address of welcome to her was rather
amazing In a few words it ran If I do wrong send me to my
father If you strike me I will try to kill you I do not wish my
ayah to play with me Go and eat rice

From that day Adam forswore the society of ayahs and small
native girls as much as a small boy can confining himself to
Imam Din and his friends of the police The Naik Jumas
husband had been presuming not a little on his position and
when Adams favour was withdrawn from his wife he judged it best
to apply for a transfer to another post There were too many
companions anxious to report his shortcomings to Strickland

Towards his father Adam kept a guarded neutrality There was not
a touch of sulkiness in it for the childs temper was as clear
as a bell But the difference and the politeness worried
Strickland

If the other men had loved Adam before the affair of the well
they worshipped him now

He knows what honour means said Imam Din he has justified
himself upon a point thereof He has carried an order through
his fathers household as a child of the blood might do
Therefore he is not altogether a child any longer Wah He is a
tigers cub The next time that Adam made his little
unofficial inspection of the line Imam Din and by consequence
all the others stood upon their feet with their hands to their
sides instead of calling out from where they lay Salaam
Babajee and other disrespectful things

But Strickland took long counsel with his wife and she with the
chequebook and their lean bankaccount and they decided that
Adam must go home to his aunts But England is not home to a
child that has been born in India and it never becomes
homelike unless he spends all his youth there The bankbook
showed that if they economised through the summer by going to a
cheap hillstation instead of to Simla where Mrs Stricklands
parents lived and where Strickland might be noticed by the
powers they could send Adam home in the next spring It would be
hard pinching but it could be done In India all the money that
people in other lands save against a rainy day runs off in loss
by exchange which today cuts a mans income down almost exactly
to onehalf There is nothing to show for money when all is put
by and that is what makes married life there so hard Strickland
used to say sometimes that he envied the convicts in the jail
They had no position to keep up and the ball and chain that the
worst of them wore was only a few pounds weight of iron

Dalhousie was chosen as being the cheapest of the hillstations
Dalhousie and a little fiveroomed cottage full of mildew
tucked away among the rhododendrons

Adam had been to Simla three or four times and knew by name the
most of the Tonga drivers from Kalka to Tara Deva but this new
plan disquieted him He came to me for information his hands
deep in his knickerbocker pockets walking step for step as
his father walked

There will be none of my bhaibund Brotherhood up there said
he disconsolately and they say that I must lie still in a
doolie for a day and a night being carried like a sheep I wish
to take some of my mounted men to Dalhousie

I told him that there was a small boy called Victor at
Dalhousie who had a calf for a pet and was allowed to play
with it on the public roads After that Adam could not
sufficiently hurry the packing

First said he I shall ask that man Victor to let me play
with the cows child If he is muggra illconditioned I shall
tell my policemen to take it away

But that is unjust said Strickland and there is no order
that the police should do injustice

When the Government pay is not sufficient and lowcaste men are
promoted what can an honest man do he replied in the very
touch and accent of Imam Din and Stricklands eyebrows went up

You talk too much to the police my son he said

Always about everything said Adam promptly They say that
when I am an officer I shall know as much as my father God
forbid little one

They say too that you are as clever as Shaitan to know
things

They say that do they said Strickland looking pleased His
pay was small but he had his reputation and that was dear to
him

They say also  not to me but to one another when they eat rice
behind the wall  that in your own heart you esteem yourself as
wise as Suleiman who was cheated by Shaitan

This time Strickland did not look so pleased Adam in all
innocence launched into a long story about SuleimanbinDaoud
who once out of vanity pitted his wits against Shaitan and
because God was not on his side Shaitan sent a little devil of
low caste as Adam put it who cheated him utterly and put him
to shame before all the other Rajas

By Jove said Strickland when the tale was done and went
away while Adam took me to task for laughing at Imam Dins
story I did not wonder that he was called Huzrut Adam for he
looked old as all time in his grave childhood sitting
crosslegged his battered little helmet far at the back of his
head his forefinger wagging up and down native fashion and
the wisdom of serpents on his unconscious lips

That May he went up to Dalhousie with his mother and in those
days the journey ended in fifty or sixty miles of uphill travel
in a doolie or palanquin along a road winding through the
Himalayas Adam sat in the doolie with his motherand Strickland
rode and tied with me a spare doolie following The march began
after we got out of the train at Pathankot in a hot night among
the rice  and poppyfields

It was all new to Adam and he had opinions to advance  notably
about a fish that jumped on a wayside pond

Now I know he shouted how Khuda puts them there First He
makes them and then He drops them down That was a new one
Then lifting his head to the stars he cried O God do it
again but slowly that I Adam may see

But nothing happened and the dooliebearers lit the noisome
dripping rag torches and Adams eyes shone big in the dancing
light and we smelt the dry dust of the plains that we were
leaving after eleven months hard work

At stated times the men ceased their drowsy grunting tune and
sat down for a smoke Between the guttering of their waterpipes
we could hear the cries of the beasts of the night and the wind
stirring in the folds of the mountain ahead At the changing
stations the voice of Adam the first of men would be lifted to
rouse the sleepers in the huts till the fresh relays of bearers
shambled from their cots and the reliefpony with them

Then we would reform and go on and by the time the moon rose
Adam was asleep and there was no sound in the night except the
grunting of the men the husky murmur of some river a thousand
feet down in the valley and the squeaking of Stricklands
saddle So we went up from the datepalm to deodar till the dawn
wind came round a corner all fresh from the snows and we
snuffed it I heard Strickland say Wife my overcoat please
and Adam fretfully Where is Dalhousie and the cows child
and then I slept till Strickland turned me out of the warm doolie
at seven oclock and I stepped into the splendour of a cool hill
day the plains sweltering twenty miles back and three thousand
feet below

Adam waked too and needs must ride in front of me to ask a
million questions and shout at the monkeys and clap his hands
when the painted pheasants bolted across our road and hail
every woodcutter and drover and pilgrim within sight till we
halted for breakfast at a staginghouse After breakfast being a
child he went out to play with a train of bullockdrivers
haltered by the roadside and we had to chase him out of a
native liquorshop where he was bargaining with a naked
sevenyearold for a mynah in a bamboo cage

Said he wriggling on my pommel as we went on again There were
four men behosh insensible at the back of that house
Wherefore do men grow behosh from drinking

It is the nature of the water l said and calling back
Strick whats that grogshop doing so close to the road Its
a temptation to any ones servants

Dunno said a sleepy voice in the doolie This is Kennedys
district Twasnt here in my time

Truly the water smells bad Adam went on I smelt it but I
did not get the mynah even for six annas The woman of the house
gave me a lovegift that I found playing near the verandah

And what was the gift Father Adam

A nosering for my ayah Ohe ohe Look at that camel with a
bag on his nose A string of loaded camels came cruising round
the corner as a fleet rounds a cape

Ho Malik why does not a camel salaam like an elephant His
neck is long enough Adam cried

The Angel Jibrail made him a fool from the beginning said the
driver as he swayed on the top of the led beast and laughter
ran all along the line of redbearded men

That is true said Adam and they laughed again

At last in the late afternoon we came to Dalhousie loveliest
of the hillstations and separatedAdam hardly could be
restrained from setting out at once to find Victor and the
cows child I found them both something to my trouble next
morning The two young sinners had a calf on a taut line just at
a sharp turn in the Mall and were pretending that he was a
Rajas elephant who had gone mad But it was my horse that
nearly went mad and they shouted with delight Then we began to
talk and Adam by way of crushing Victors repeated reminders
that he and not that other was the owner of the calf said
It is true I have no cows child but a great dacoity has been
done on my father

We came up together yesterday There could have been nothing I
said

It was my mothers horse She has been dacoited with beating
and blows and now it is so thin He held his hands an inch
apart My father is at the tarhouse sending tars Imam Din
will cut off all their heads I desire your saddlecloth for a
howdah to my elephant Give it me

This was exciting but not lucid I went to the telegraphoffice
and found Strickland in a bad temper among many telegraphforms
A dishevelled oneeyed groom stood in a corner whimpering at
intervals He was a man whom Adam invariably addressed as
Beshakl beukl beank  ugly stupid eyeless It seemed
according to Strickland that he had sent his wifes horse up to
Dalhousie by road a fortnights march This is the custom in
Upper India Among the foothills near Dhunnera or Dhar horse
and man had been violently set upon in the night by four men who
had beaten the groom his leg was bandaged from knee to ankle in
proof had incidentally beaten the horse and had robbed the
groom of the bucket and all his money eleven rupees nine
annas three pie Last they had left him for dead by the
wayside where woodcutters had found and nursed him Then the
oneeyed howled with anguish thinking over his bruises They
asked me if I was Strickland Sahibs servant and I thinking the
protection of the name would be sufficient spoke the truth
Then they beat me grievously

Hm said Strickland I thought they wouldnt dacoit as a
business on the Dalhousie road This is meant for me personally
 sheer badmashi impudence All right

In justice to a very hardworking class it must be said that the
thieves of Upper India have the keenest sense of humour The
last compliment that they can pay a Police officer is to rob
him and if as once they did they can loot a Deputy
InspectorGeneral of Police on the eve of his retirement of
everything except the clothes on his back their joy is
complete They cause letters of derision and telegrams of
condolence to be sent to the victim for of all men thieves are
most compelled to keep up with modern progress

Strickland was a man of few words where his business was
concerned I had never seen a Police officer robbed before and
I expected some excitement but Strickland held his tongue He
took the grooms deposition and retired into himself for a time
evolving thieves Then he sent Kennedy of the Pathankot charge
an official letter and an unofficial note Kennedys reply was
purely unofficial and it ran thus This seems a compliment
solely intended for you My wonder is you didnt get it before

The men are probably back in your district by this time The
Dhunnera and foothill people are highly respectable cultivators
and seeing my Assistant is an unlicked pup and I cant trust my
Inspector out of my sight I am not going to turn their harvest
upside down with a police investigation I am run off my feet
with vaccination police work Youd better look at home The
Shubkudder Gang were through here a fortnight back They laid up
at the Amritsar Serai and then worked down No cases against
them in my charge but remember you lagged their malik for
receiving in Prub Dyals burglary They owe you one

Exactly what I thought said Strickland I had a notion it was
the Shubkudder Gang from the first We must make it pleasant
for them at Peshawur and in my district too They are just the
kind that would lie up under Imam Dins shadow

From this point onward the wires began to he worked heavily
Strickland had a very fair knowledge of the Shubkudder Gang
gathered at first hand

They were the same syndicate that had once stolen a Deputy
Commissioners cow put horseshoes on her and taken her forty
miles into the jungle before they lost interest in the joke
They added insult to insult by writing that the Deputy
Commissioners cows and horses were so much alike that it took
them two days to find out the difference and they would not
lift the like of such cattle any more

The District Superintendent at Peshawur replied to Strickland
that he was expecting the gang and Stricklands Assistant in
his own district being young and full of zeal sent up the most
amazing clues

Now thats just what I want that young fool not to do said
Strickland He hasnt passed the lower standard yet and hes
an English boy born and bred and his father before him He has
about as much tact as a bull and he wont work quietly under my
Inspector I wish the Government would keep our service for
countryborn men Those first five or six years give a man a
pull that lasts him his life Adam if you were only old enough
to be my Stunt He looked down at the little fellow on the
verandah Adam was deeply interested in the dacoity and unlike
a child did not lose interest after the first week On the
contrary he would ask his father every evening what had been
done and Strickland had drawn him a picture on the white wall of
the verandah showing the different towns in which policemen were
on the lookout for the thieves They were Amritsar Jullundur
Phillour Gurgaon in case the gang were moving south Rawal
Pindi and Peshawur with Multan Adam looked up at the picture
as he answered

There has been great dikh trouble in this case

Very great trouble I wish thou wert a young man and my
assistant to help me

Dost thou need help my father Adam asked curiously with his
head on one side

Very much

Leave it all alone It is bad Let loose everything

That must not be Those beginning a business continue to the
end

Thou wilt continue to the end Dost thou not know who did the
dacoity

Strickland shook his head Adam turned to me with the same
question and I answered it in the same way

What foolish people he said and turned his back on us He
showed plainly in all our dealings afterwards how we had fallen
in his opinion Strickland told me that he would sit at the
door of his workroom and stare at him for half an hour at a
time as he went through his papers Strickland seemed to work
harder over the case than if he had been in office on the
plains

And sometimes I look up and I fancy the little chaps laughing
at me Its an awful thing to have a son You see hes your own
and his own and between the two you dont know quite how to
handle him said Strickland I wonder what in the world he
thinks about

I asked Adam this on my own account He put his head on one side
for a moment and replied In these days I think about great
things I do not play with Victor and the cows child any more
He is only a baba

At the end of the third week of Stricklands leave the result of
Stricklands labours  labours that had made Mrs Strickland
more indignant against dacoits than any one else  came to hand
The police at Peshawur reported that half the Shubkudder Gang
were held at Peshawur to account for the possession of some
blankets and a horsebucket Stricklands Assistant had also
four men under suspicion in his charge and Imam Din must have
stirred up Stricklands Inspector to investigations on his own
account for a string of incoherent telegrams came in from the
Club Secretary in which he entreated exhorted and commanded
Strickland to take his mangy havildars off the club premises
Your men in servants quarters here examining cook Marker
indignant Steward threatens resignation Members furious
Saises stopped on roads Shut up or my resignation goes to
committee

Now I shouldnt in the least wonder said Strickland
thoughtfully to his wife if the club was not just the place
where a man would lie up Bill Watson isnt at all pleased
though I think I shall have to cut my leave by a week and go
down there If theres anything to be told the men will tell me
It will never do for the gang to think they can dacoit my
belongings

That was in the forenoon and Strickland asked me to tiff in to
leave me some instructions about his big dog with authority to
rebuke those who did not attend to her Tietens was growing too
old and too fat to live in the plains in summer When I came
Adam had climbed into his high chair at the table and Mrs
Strickland seemed ready to weep at any moment over the general
misery of things

I go down the hill tomorrow little son said Strickland

Wherefore said Adam reaching out for a ripe mango and burying
his head in it

Imam Din has caught the men who did the dacoity and there are
also others at Peshawur under suspicion I must go to see

Bus said Adam between the sucks at his mango as Mrs
Strickland tucked the napkin round his neck It is enough
Imam Din speaks lies Do not go

It is necessary There has been great dikhdari
troublegiving

Adam came out of the fruit for a minute and laughed Then
returning he spoke between slow and deliberate mouthfuls

The dacoits live in Beshakls head They will never be caught
All people know that The cook knows and the scullion and
Rahim Baksh here

Nay said the butler behind his chair hastily What should I
know Nothing at all does the servant of the Presence know

Accha said Adam and sucked on Only it is known

Speak then said Strickland What dost thou know Remember
the sais was beaten insensible

That was in the badwater shop where I played when we came here
The boy who would not sell me the mynah for six annas told me
that a oneeyed man had come there and drunk the bad waters and
gone mad He broke bedsteads They hit him with a bamboo till he
fell senseless and fearing he was dead they nursed him on
milk like a little baba When I was playing first with the cows
child I asked Beshakl if he were that man and he said no But I
knew because many woodcutters asked him whether his head were
whole now

But why I interrupted did Beshakl tell lies

Oh he is a lowcaste man and desired consideration Now he is
a witness in a great lawcase and men will go to the jailkhana
on his account It was to give trouble and obtain notice

Was it all lies said Strickland

Ask him said Adam cheerily through the mangojuice

Strickland passed through the door there was a howl of despair
in the servants quarters up the hill and he returned with the
oneeyed groom

Now said Strickland it is known Declare Beshakl said
Adam while the man gasped Imam Din has caught four men and
there are some more at Peshawur Bus Bus Bus Tell about the
mare and how she rolled

Thou didst get drunk by the wayside and didst make a false case

to cover it Speak

Like many other men Strickland in possession of a few facts
was irresistible The groom groaned

I  I did not get drunk  till  till  Protector of the Poor
the mare rolled

All horses roll at Dhunnera The road is too narrow before
that and they smell where the other horses have rolled This
the bullockdrivers told me when they came there said Adam

She rolled The saddle was cut and the curbchain was lost

See said Adam tugging a curbchain from his pocket That
woman in the shop gave it to me for a lovegift Beshakl said
it was not his when I showed it But I knew

Then they in the grogshop knowing that I was the servant of
the Presence said that unless I drank and spent money they
would tell

A lie A lie said Strickland Son of an owl speak truth
now at least

Then I was afraid because I had lost the curbchain so I cut
the saddle across and about

She did not roll then said Strickland bewildered and very
angry

It was the curbchain that was lost That was the beginning of
all I cut the saddle to look as though she had rolled and
went to drink in the shop I drank and there was a fray The
rest I have forgotten till I was recovered

And the mare the while What of the mare

The man looked at Strickland and collapsed I will speak truth

She bore fagots for a woodcutter for a week

Oh poor Diamond said Mrs Strickland

And Beshaki was paid four annas for her hire three days ago by
the woodcutters brother who is the lefthand man of the
jhampanis here said Adam in a loud and joyful voice We all
knew We all knew I and all the servants

Strickland was silent His wife stared helplessly at the child 
the soul called out of the Nowhere that went its own way alone

Did no man help thee with the lies I asked of the groom

None Protector of the Poor  not one

They grew then

As a tale grows in the telling Alas I am a very bad man and
he blinked his one eye dolefully

Now four men are held at my station on thy account and God
knows how many more at Peshawur besides the questions at
Multan and my izzat is lost and the mare has been packpony to
a woodcutter Son of devils what canst thou do to make
amends

There was just a little break in Stricklands voice and the man
caught it Bending low he answered in the abject fawning whine
that confounds right and wrong more surely even than most modern
creeds Protector of the Poor is the police service shut to an
honest man

Out cried Strickland and swiftly as the groom departed he
must have heard our shout of laughter behind him

If you dismiss that man Strick I shall engage him Hes a
genius I said It will take you months to put this mess
right and Billy Watson wont give you a minutes peace

You arent going to tell him said Strickland appealingly

I couldnt keep this to myself if you were my own brother Four
men held in your district four or forty at Peshawur  and what
was that you said about Multan

Oh nothing Only some camel men there have been 

On account of a curbchain Oh my aunt

And whose memsahib was thy aunt said Adam with the mango
stone in his fist We began to laugh again

But here said Strickland pulling his face together is a
very bad child who has caused his father to lose honour before
all the policemen of the Punjab

Oh they know said Adam It was only for the sake of show
that they caught the people Assuredly they all knew it was
bunao makeup

And since when hast thou known said the first policeman in
India to his son

Four days after we came here  after the woodcutter had asked
Beshakl of the health of his head Beshaki all but slew a
woodcutter at that badwater place

If thou hadst spoken then time and money and trouble to me and
to others had all been spared Baba thou hast done a wrong
greater than thy knowledge and thou hast put me to shame and
set me out upon false words and broken my honour Thou hast
done very wrong But perhaps thou didst not think

Nay but I did think Father my honour was lost when that
happened that  that happened in Jumas presence Now it is made
whole again

And with the most enchanting smile in the world Adam climbed on

to his fathers lap
