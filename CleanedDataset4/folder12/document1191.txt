TO THE
RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES MONTAGUE
ONE OF THE LORDS OF THE TREASURY


SirI heartily wish this play were as perfect as I intended it that it
might be more worthy your acceptance and that my dedication of it to you
might be more becoming that honour and esteem which I with everybody who
is so fortunate as to know you have for you It had your countenance
when yet unknown and now it is made public it wants your protection

I would not have anybody imagine that I think this play without its
faults for I am conscious of several I confess I designed whatever
vanity or ambition occasioned that design to have written a true and
regular comedy but I found it an undertaking which put me in mind of
_Sudet multum_ _frustraque laboret ausus idem_ And now to make amends
for the vanity of such a design I do confess both the attempt and the
imperfect performance Yet I must take the boldness to say I have not
miscarried in the whole for the mechanical part of it is regular That
I may say with as little vanity as a builder may say he has built a house
according to the model laid down before him or a gardener that he has
set his flowers in a knot of such or such a figure I designed the moral
first and to that moral I invented the fable and do not know that I
have borrowed one hint of it anywhere I made the plot as strong as I
could because it was single and I made it single because I would avoid
confusion and was resolved to preserve the three unities of the drama
Sir this discourse is very impertinent to you whose judgment much
better can discern the faults than I can excuse them and whose good
nature like that of a lover will find out those hidden beauties if
there are any such which it would be great immodesty for me to discover
I think I dont speak improperly when I call you a _lover_ of poetry for
it is very well known she has been a very kind mistress to you she has
not denied you the last favour and she has been fruitful to you in a
most beautiful issue If I break off abruptly here I hope everybody
will understand that it is to avoid a commendation which as it is your
due would be most easy for me to pay and too troublesome for you to
receive

I have since the acting of this play harkened after the objections which
have been made to it for I was conscious where a true critic might have
put me upon my defence I was prepared for the attack and am pretty
confident I could have vindicated some parts and excused others and
where there were any plain miscarriages I would most ingenuously have
confessed em But I have not heard anything said sufficient to provoke
an answer That which looks most like an objection does not relate in
particular to this play but to all or most that ever have been written
and that is soliloquy Therefore I will answer it not only for my own
sake but to save others the trouble to whom it may hereafter be
objected

I grant that for a man to talk to himself appears absurd and unnatural
and indeed it is so in most cases but the circumstances which may attend
the occasion make great alteration It oftentimes happens to a man to
have designs which require him to himself and in their nature cannot
admit of a confidant Such for certain is all villainy and other less
mischievous intentions may be very improper to be communicated to a
second person In such a case therefore the audience must observe
whether the person upon the stage takes any notice of them at all or no
For if he supposes any one to be by when he talks to himself it is
monstrous and ridiculous to the last degree Nay not only in this case
but in any part of a play if there is expressed any knowledge of an
audience it is insufferable But otherwise when a man in soliloquy
reasons with himself and _pros_ and _cons_ and weighs all his
designs we ought not to imagine that this man either talks to us or to
himself he is only thinking and thinking such matter as were
inexcusable folly in him to speak But because we are concealed
spectators of the plot in agitation and the poet finds it necessary to
let us know the whole mystery of his contrivance he is willing to inform
us of this persons thoughts and to that end is forced to make use of
the expedient of speech no other better way being yet invented for the
communication of thought

Another very wrong objection has been made by some who have not taken
leisure to distinguish the characters The hero of the play as they are
pleased to call him meaning Mellefont is a gull and made a fool and
cheated Is every man a gull and a fool that is deceived At that rate
Im afraid the two classes of men will be reduced to one and the knaves
themselves be at a loss to justify their title But if an openhearted
honest man who has an entire confidence in one whom he takes to be his
friend and whom he has obliged to be so and who to confirm him in his
opinion in all appearance and upon several trials has been so if this
man be deceived by the treachery of the other must he of necessity
commence fool immediately only because the other has proved a villain
Ay but there was caution given to Mellefont in the first act by his
friend Careless Of what nature was that caution Only to give the
audience some light into the character of Maskwell before his appearance
and not to convince Mellefont of his treachery for that was more than
Careless was then able to do he never knew Maskwell guilty of any
villainy he was only a sort of man which he did not like As for his
suspecting his familiarity with my Lady Touchwood let em examine the
answer that Mellefont makes him and compare it with the conduct of
Maskwells character through the play

I would beg em again to look into the character of Maskwell before they
accuse Mellefont of weakness for being deceived by him For upon summing
up the enquiry into this objection it may be found they have mistaken
cunning in one character for folly in another

But there is one thing at which I am more concerned than all the false
criticisms that are made upon me and that is some of the ladies are
offended I am heartily sorry for it for I declare I would rather
disoblige all the critics in the world than one of the fair sex They
are concerned that I have represented some women vicious and affected
How can I help it It is the business of a comic poet to paint the vices
and follies of humankind and there are but two sexes male and female
_men_ and _women_ which have a title to humanity and if I leave one
half of them out the work will be imperfect I should be very glad of
an opportunity to make my compliment to those ladies who are offended
but they can no more expect it in a comedy than to be tickled by a
surgeon when hes letting em blood They who are virtuous or discreet
should not be offended for such characters as these distinguish _them_
and make their beauties more shining and observed and they who are of
the other kind may nevertheless pass for such by seeming not to be
displeased or touched with the satire of this _comedy_ Thus have they
also wrongfully accused me of doing them a prejudice when I have in
reality done them a service

You will pardon me sir for the freedom I take of making answers to
other people in an epistle which ought wholly to be sacred to you but
since I intend the play to be so too I hope I may take the more liberty
of justifying it where it is in the right

I must now sir declare to the world how kind you have been to my
endeavours for in regard of what was well meant you have excused what
was ill performed I beg you would continue the same method in your
acceptance of this dedication I know no other way of making a return to
that humanity you shewed in protecting an infant but by enrolling it in
your service now that it is of age and come into the world Therefore
be pleased to accept of this as an acknowledgment of the favour you have
shewn me and an earnest of the real service and gratitude of

Sir your most obliged humble servant

WILLIAM CONGREVE




TO MY DEAR FRIEND MR CONGREVE
ON HIS COMEDY CALLED
THE DOUBLEDEALER


Well then the promised hour is come at last
The present age of wit obscures the past
Strong were our sires and as they fought they writ
Conquring with force of arms and dint of wit
Theirs was the giant race before the flood
And thus when Charles returned our empire stood
Like Janus he the stubborn soil manured
With rules of husbandry the rankness cured
Tamed us to manners when the stage was rude
And boistrous English wit with art indued
Our age was cultivated thus at length
But what we gained in skill we lost in strength
Our builders were with want of genius curst
The second temple was not like the first
Till you the best Vitruvius come at length
Our beauties equal but excel our strength
Firm Doric pillars found your solid base
The fair Corinthian crowns the higher space
Thus all below is strength and all above is grace
In easy dialogue is Fletchers praise
He moved the mind but had no power to raise
Great Johnson did by strength of judgment please
Yet doubling Fletchers force he wants ease
In diffring talents both adorned their age
One for the study tother for the stage
But both to Congreve justly shall submit
One matched in judgment both oermatched in wit
In him all beauties of this age we see
Etherege his courtship Southerns purity
The satire wit and strength of manly Wycherly
All this in blooming youth you have achieved
Nor are your foiled contemporaries grieved
So much the sweetness of your manners move
We cannot envy you because we love
Fabius might joy in Scipio when he saw
A beardless consul made against the law
And join his suffrage to the votes of Rome
Though he with Hannibal was overcome
Thus old Romano bowed to Raphaels fame
And scholar to the youth he taught became

O that your brows my laurel had sustained
Well had I been deposed if you had reigned
The father had descended for the son
For only you are lineal to the throne
Thus when the state one Edward did depose
A greater Edward in his room arose
But now not I but poetry is cursed
For Tom the Second reigns like Tom the First
But let em not mistake my patrons part
Nor call his charity their own desert
Yet this I prophesy Thou shalt be seen
Though with some short parenthesis between
High on the throne of wit and seated there
Not mine thats little but thy laurel wear
Thy first attempt an early promise made
That early promise this has more than paid
So bold yet so judiciously you dare
That your least praise is to be regular
Time place and action may with pains be wrought
But genius must be born and never can be taught
This is your portion this your native store
Heavn that but once was prodigal before
To Shakespeare gave as much she could not give him more

Maintain your post thats all the fame you need
For tis impossible you should proceed
Already I am worn with cares and age
And just abandoning th ungrateful stage
Unprofitably kept at heavns expense
I live a rentcharge on his providence
But you whom every muse and grace adorn
Whom I foresee to better fortune born
Be kind to my remains and oh defend
Against your judgment your departed friend
Let not th insulting foe my fame pursue
But shade those laurels which descend to you
And take for tribute what these lines express
You merit more nor could my love do less

JOHN DRYDEN




PROLOGUE
Spoken by MRS BRACEGIRDLE


Moors have this way as story tells to know
Whether their brats are truly got or no
Into the sea the newborn babe is thrown
There as instinct directs to swim or drown
A barbarous device to try if spouse
Has kept religiously her nuptial vows

Such are the trials poets make of plays
Only they trust to more inconstant seas
So does our author this his child commit
To the tempestuous mercy of the pit
To know if it be truly born of wit

Critics avaunt for you are fish of prey
And feed like sharks upon an infant play
Be evry monster of the deep away
Lets have a fair trial and a clear sea

Let nature work and do not damn too soon
For life will struggle long eer it sink down
And will at least rise thrice before it drown
Let us consider had it been our fate
Thus hardly to be proved legitimate
I will not say wed all in danger been
Were each to suffer for his mothers sin
But by my troth I cannot avoid thinking
How nearly some good men might have scaped sinking
But heavn be praised this custom is confined
Alone to th offspring of the muses kind
Our Christian cuckolds are more bent to pity
I know not one Moorhusband in the city
I th good mans arms the chopping bastard thrives
For he thinks all his own that is his wives

Whatever fate is for this play designed
The poets sure he shall some comfort find
For if his muse has played him false the worst
That can befall him is to be divorced
You husbands judge if that be to be cursed

MEL Then thy reason staggers and thourt almost drunk

noise of words without sense I think the women have more musical voices
and become nonsense better

MEL Why they are at the end of the gallery retired to their tea and
scandal according to their ancient custom after dinner But I made a
pretence to follow you because I had something to say to you in private
and I am not like to have many opportunities this evening

CARE And heres this coxcomb most critically come to interrupt you



SCENE II


_To them_ BRISK

BRISK Boys boys lads where are you What do you give ground
Mortgage for a bottle ha Careless this is your trick youre always
spoiling company by leaving it

CARE And thou art always spoiling company by coming in ot

BRISK Pooh ha ha ha I know you envy me Spite proud spite by the
gods and burning envy Ill be judged by Mellefont here who gives and
takes raillery better than you or I Pshaw man when I say you spoil
company by leaving it I mean you leave nobody for the company to laugh
at I think there I was with you Ha Mellefont

MEL O my word Brisk that was a home thrust you have silenced him

BRISK Oh my dear Mellefont let me perish if thou art not the soul of
conversation the very essence of wit and spirit of wine The deuce take
me if there were three good things said or one understood since thy
amputation from the body of our society He I think thats pretty and
metaphorical enough igad I could not have said it out of thy company
Careless ha

CARE Hum ay what ist

BRISK _O mon coeur_ What ist Nay gad Ill punish you for want of
apprehension The deuce take me if I tell you

MEL No no hang him he has no taste But dear Brisk excuse me I
have a little business

CARE Prithee get thee gone thou seest we are serious

MEL Well come immediately if youll but go in and keep up good humour
and sense in the company Prithee do theyll fall asleep else

BRISK Igad so they will Well I will I will gad you shall
command me from the Zenith to the Nadir But the deuce take me if I say
a good thing till you come But prithee dear rogue make haste prithee
make haste I shall burst else And yonder your uncle my Lord

wedding tomorrow nor the deuce take me I wont write your
Epithalamiumand see what a condition youre like to be brought to

MEL Well Ill speak but three words and follow you

BRISK Enough enough Careless bring your apprehension along with
you



SCENE III


MELLEFONT CARELESS

CARE Pert coxcomb

MEL Faith tis a goodnatured coxcomb and has very entertaining
follies You must be more humane to him at this juncture it will do me
service Ill tell you I would have mirth continued this day at any
rate though patience purchase folly and attention be paid with noise
there are times when sense may be unseasonable as well as truth Prithee
do thou wear none today but allow Brisk to have wit that thou mayst
seem a fool

CARE Why how now why this extravagant proposition

MEL Oh I would have no room for serious design for I am jealous of a
plot I would have noise and impertinence keep my Lady Touchwoods head
from working for hell is not more busy than her brain nor contains more
devils than that imaginations

CARE I thought your fear of her had been over Is not tomorrow
appointed for your marriage with Cynthia and her father Sir Paul
Plyant come to settle the writings this day on purpose

MEL True but you shall judge whether I have not reason to be alarmed
None besides you and Maskwell are acquainted with the secret of my Aunt
Touchwoods violent passion for me Since my first refusal of her
addresses she has endeavoured to do me all ill offices with my uncle yet
has managed em with that subtilty that to him they have borne the face
of kindness while her malice like a dark lanthorn only shone upon me
where it was directed Still it gave me less perplexity to prevent the
success of her displeasure than to avoid the importunities of her love
and of two evils I thought myself favoured in her aversion But whether
urged by her despair and the short prospect of time she saw to accomplish
her designs whether the hopes of revenge or of her love terminated in
the view of this my marriage with Cynthia I know not but this morning
she surprised me in my bed

CARE Was there ever such a fury Tis well nature has not put it into
her sexs power to ravish Well bless us proceed What followed

MEL What at first amazed mefor I looked to have seen her in all the
transports of a slighted and revengeful womanbut when I expected
thunder from her voice and lightning in her eyes I saw her melted into
tears and hushed into a sigh It was long before either of us spoke
passion had tied her tongue and amazement mine In short the
consequence was thus she omitted nothing that the most violent love
could urge or tender words express which when she saw had no effect
but still I pleaded honour and nearness of blood to my uncle then came
the storm I feared at first for starting from my bedside like a fury
she flew to my sword and with much ado I prevented her doing me or
herself a mischief Having disarmed her in a gust of passion she left
me and in a resolution confirmed by a thousand curses not to close her
eyes till they had seen my ruin

CARE Exquisite woman But what the devil does she think thou hast no
more sense than to get an heir upon her body to disinherit thyself for
as I take it this settlement upon you is with a proviso that your uncle
have no children

MEL It is so Well the service you are to do me will be a pleasure to
yourself I must get you to engage my Lady Plyant all this evening that
my pious aunt may not work her to her interest And if you chance to
secure her to yourself you may incline her to mine Shes handsome and
knows it is very silly and thinks she has sense and has an old fond
husband

CARE I confess a very fair foundation for a lover to build upon

MEL For my Lord Froth he and his wife will be sufficiently taken up
with admiring one another and Brisks gallantry as they call it Ill
observe my uncle myself and Jack Maskwell has promised me to watch my
aunt narrowly and give me notice upon any suspicion As for Sir Paul
my wise fatherinlaw that is to be my dear Cynthia has such a share in
his fatherly fondness he would scarce make her a moment uneasy to have
her happy hereafter

CARE So you have manned your works but I wish you may not have the
weakest guard where the enemy is strongest

MEL Maskwell you mean prithee why should you suspect him

CARE Faith I cannot help it you know I never liked him I am a little
superstitious in physiognomy

MEL He has obligations of gratitude to bind him to me his dependence
upon my uncle is through my means

CARE Upon your aunt you mean

MEL My aunt

CARE Im mistaken if there be not a familiarity between them you do not
suspect notwithstanding her passion for you

MEL Pooh pooh nothing in the world but his design to do me service
and he endeavours to be well in her esteem that he may be able to effect
it

CARE Well I shall be glad to be mistaken but your aunts aversion in
her revenge cannot be any way so effectually shown as in bringing forth a
child to disinherit you She is handsome and cunning and naturally
wanton Maskwell is flesh and blood at best and opportunities between
them are frequent His affection to you you have confessed is grounded
upon his interest that you have transplanted and should it take root in
my lady I dont see what you can expect from the fruit

MEL I confess the consequence is visible were your suspicions just
But see the company is broke up lets meet em

smile

jest

LORD TOUCH Sir Paul if you please well retire to the ladies and
drink a dish of tea to settle our heads

encouragement

MEL You are cruel to yourself my lord as well as malicious to them

LORD FROTH I confess I did myself some violence at first but now I

BRISK Let me perish my lord but there is something very particular in

friends of mine that write but igad I love to be malicious Nay
deuce take me theres wit int too And wit must be foiled by wit cut

understand it

LORD FROTH Oh foy Mr Careless all the world allows Mr Brisk to

SCENE VI


LADY TOUCHWOOD _and_ MASKWELL

LADY TOUCH Ill hear no more You are false and ungrateful come I
know you false

MASK I have been frail I confess madam for your ladyships service

LADY TOUCH That I should trust a man whom I had known betray his
friend

MASK What friend have I betrayed or to whom

LADY TOUCH Your fond friend Mellefont and to me can you deny it

MASK I do not

LADY TOUCH Have you not wronged my lord who has been a father to you
in your wants and given you being Have you not wronged him in the
highest manner in his bed

MASK With your ladyships help and for your service as I told you
before I cant deny that neither Anything more madam

LADY TOUCH More Audacious villain Oh whats more is most my
shame Have you not dishonoured me

MASK No that I deny for I never told in all my life so that
accusations answered on to the next

LADY TOUCH Death do you dally with my passion Insolent devil But
have a careprovoke me not for by the eternal fire you shall not
scape my vengeance Calm villain How unconcerned he stands
confessing treachery and ingratitude Is there a vice more black Oh I
have excuses thousands for my faults fire in my temper passions in my
soul apt to evry provocation oppressed at once with love and with
despair But a sedate a thinking villain whose black blood runs
temperately bad what excuse can clear

MASK Will you be in temper madam I would not talk not to be heard I
have been _she walks about disordered_ a very great rogue for your
sake and you reproach me with it I am ready to be a rogue still to do
you service and you are flinging conscience and honour in my face to
rebate my inclinations How am I to behave myself You know I am your
creature my life and fortune in your power to disoblige you brings me
certain ruin Allow it I would betray you I would not be a traitor to
myself I dont pretend to honesty because you know I am a rascal but I
would convince you from the necessity of my being firm to you

LADY TOUCH Necessity impudence Can no gratitude incline you no
obligations touch you Have not my fortune and my person been subjected
to your pleasure Were you not in the nature of a servant and have not
I in effect made you lord of all of me and of my lord Where is that
humble love the languishing that adoration which once was paid me and
everlastingly engaged

MASK Fixt rooted in my heart whence nothing can remove em yet you

LADY TOUCH Yet what yet

MASK Nay misconceive me not madam when I say I have had a genrous
and a faithful passion which you had never favoured but through revenge
and policy

LADY TOUCH Ha

MASK Look you madam we are alonepray contain yourself and hear me
You know you loved your nephew when I first sighed for you I quickly
found it an argument that I loved for with that art you veiled your
passion twas imperceptible to all but jealous eyes This discovery made
me bold I confess it for by it I thought you in my power Your
nephews scorn of you added to my hopes I watched the occasion and took
you just repulsed by him warm at once with love and indignation your
disposition my arguments and happy opportunity accomplished my design
I pressed the yielding minute and was blest How I have loved you
since words have not shown then how should words express

LADY TOUCH Well mollifying devil And have I not met your love with
forward fire

MASK Your zeal I grant was ardent but misplaced there was revenge
in view that womans idol had defiled the temple of the god and love
was made a mockworship A son and heir would have edged young Mellefont
upon the brink of ruin and left him none but you to catch at for
prevention

LADY TOUCH Again provoke me Do you wind me like a larum only to
rouse my own stilled soul for your diversion Confusion

MASK Nay madam Im gone if you relapse What needs this I say
nothing but what you yourself in open hours of love have told me Why
should you deny it Nay how can you Is not all this present heat
owing to the same fire Do you not love him still How have I this day
offended you but in not breaking off his match with Cynthia which ere
tomorrow shall be done had you but patience

LADY TOUCH How what said you Maskwell Another caprice to unwind my
temper

MASK By heavn no I am your slave the slave of all your pleasures
and will not rest till I have given you peace would you suffer me

LADY TOUCH O Maskwell in vain I do disguise me from thee thou knowst
me knowest the very inmost windings and recesses of my soul O
Mellefont I burn married to morrow Despair strikes me Yet my soul
knows I hate him too let him but once be mine and next immediate ruin
seize him

MASK Compose yourself you shall possess and ruin him toowill that
please you

LADY TOUCH How how Thou dear thou precious villain how

MASK You have already been tampering with my Lady Plyant

LADY TOUCH I have she is ready for any impression I think fit

MASK She must be throughly persuaded that Mellefont loves her

LADY TOUCH She is so credulous that way naturally and likes him so
well that she will believe it faster than I can persuade her But I
dont see what you can propose from such a trifling design for her first
conversing with Mellefont will convince her of the contrary

MASK I know it I dont depend upon it But it will prepare something
else and gain us leisure to lay a stronger plot If I gain a little
time I shall not want contrivance

One minute gives invention to destroy

What to rebuild will a whole age employ




ACT II


SCENE I


LADY FROTH _and_ CYNTHIA

CYNT Indeed madam Is it possible your ladyship could have been so
much in love

LADY FROTH I could not sleep I did not sleep one wink for three weeks
together

CYNT Prodigious I wonder want of sleep and so much love and so much
wit as your ladyship has did not turn your brain

LADY FROTH Oh my dear Cynthia you must not rally your friend But
really as you say I wonder too But then I had a way For between
you and I I had whimsies and vapours but I gave them vent

CYNT How pray madam

LADY FROTH Oh I writ writ abundantly Do you never write

CYNT Write what

LADY FROTH Songs elegies satires encomiums panegyrics lampoons
plays or heroic poems

CYNT O Lord not I madam Im content to be a courteous reader

LADY FROTH Oh inconsistent In love and not write If my lord and I
had been both of your temper we had never come together Oh bless me
What a sad thing would that have been if my lord and I should never have
met

CYNT Then neither my lord nor you would ever have met with your match
on my conscience

LADY FROTH O my conscience no more we should thou sayst right For
sure my Lord Froth is as fine a gentleman and as much a man of quality
Ah nothing at all of the common air I think I may say he wants nothing
but a blue ribbon and a star to make him shine the very phosphorus of
our hemisphere Do you understand those two hard words If you dont
Ill explain em to you

CYNT Yes yes madam Im not so ignorantAt least I wont own it to
be troubled with your instructions _Aside_

LADY FROTH Nay I beg your pardon but being derived from the Greek I
thought you might have escaped the etymology But Im the more amazed to
find you a woman of letters and not write Bless me how can Mellefont
believe you love him

CYNT Why faith madam he that wont take my word shall never have it
under my hand

LADY FROTH I vow Mellefonts a pretty gentleman but methinks he wants
a manner

CYNT A manner Whats that madam

LADY FROTH Some distinguishing quality as for example the _bel air_
or _brillant_ of Mr Brisk the solemnity yet complaisance of my lord
or something of his own that should look a little _Jenesaisquoish_ he
is too much a mediocrity in my mind

CYNT He does not indeed affect either pertness or formality for which
I like him Here he comes

LADY FROTH And my lord with him Pray observe the difference



SCENE II


_To them_ LORD FROTH MELLEFONT _and_ BRISK

CYNT Impertinent creature I could almost be angry with her now
_Aside_

LADY FROTH My lord I have been telling Cynthia how much I have been in
love with you I swear I have Im not ashamed to own it now Ah it
makes my heart leap I vow I sigh when I think ont My dear lord Ha
ha ha do you remember my lord _Squeezes him by the hand_ _looks
kindly on him_ _sighs_ _and then laughs out_

LORD FROTH Pleasant creature perfectly well ah that look ay there
it is who could resist twas so my heart was made a captive first and
ever since thas been in love with happy slavery

LADY FROTH Oh that tongue that dear deceitful tongue that charming
softness in your mien and your expression and then your bow Good my
lord bow as you did when I gave you my picture here suppose this my
picture _Gives him a pocketglass_ Pray mind my lord ah he bows
charmingly nay my lord you shant kiss it so much I shall grow
jealous I vow now _He bows profoundly low_ _then kisses the glass_

LORD FROTH I saw myself there and kissed it for your sake

LADY FROTH Ah Gallantry to the last degree Mr Brisk youre a
judge was ever anything so well bred as my lord

BRISK Never anything but your ladyship let me perish

LADY FROTH Oh prettily turned again let me die but you have a great
deal of wit Mr Mellefont dont you think Mr Brisk has a world of

BRISK O heavns madam

LADY FROTH More wit than anybody

BRISK Im everlastingly your humble servant deuce take me madam

LORD FROTH Dont you think us a happy couple

CYNT I vow my lord I think you the happiest couple in the world for
youre not only happy in one another and when you are together but
happy in yourselves and by yourselves

LORD FROTH I hope Mellefont will make a good husband too

CYNT Tis my interest to believe he will my Lord

LORD FROTH Dye think hell love you as well as I do my wife Im
afraid not

CYNT I believe hell love me better

LORD FROTH Heavns that can never be But why do you think so

CYNT Because he has not so much reason to be fond of himself

LORD FROTH Oh your humble servant for that dear madam Well
Mellefont youll be a happy creature

MEL Ay my lord I shall have the same reason for my happiness that
your lordship has I shall think myself happy

LORD FROTH Ah thats all

BRISK _To_ LADY FROTH Your ladyship is in the right but igad
Im wholly turned into satire I confess I write but seldom but when I
dokeen iambics igad But my lord was telling me your ladyship has
made an essay toward an heroic poem

LADY FROTH Did my lord tell you Yes I vow and the subject is my
lords love to me And what do you think I call it I dare swear you
wont guess_The Sillabub_ ha ha ha

BRISK Because my lords titles Froth igad ha ha ha deuce take

LADY FROTH He ay is not it And then I call my lord Spumoso and
myself what dye think I call myself

BRISK Lactilla may beigad I cannot tell

LADY FROTH Biddy thats all just my own name

BRISK Biddy Igad very pretty Deuce take me if your ladyship has
not the art of surprising the most naturally in the world I hope youll
make me happy in communicating the poem

BRISK Im your humble servant let me perish I presume your ladyship
has read Bossu

LADY FROTH Oh yes and Racine and Dacier upon Aristotle and Horace My

LADY FROTH Yes I believe I have Mr Brisk come will you go into
the next room and there Ill shew you what I have

LORD FROTH Ill walk a turn in the garden and come to you



SCENE III


MELLEFONT CYNTHIA

MEL Youre thoughtful Cynthia

CYNT Im thinking though marriage makes man and wife one flesh it
leaves em still two fools and they become more conspicuous by setting
off one another

MEL Thats only when two fools meet and their follies are opposed

CYNT Nay I have known two wits meet and by the opposition of their
wit render themselves as ridiculous as fools Tis an odd game were
going to play at What think you of drawing stakes and giving over in
time

MEL No hangt thats not endeavouring to win because its possible
we may lose since we have shuffled and cut lets even turn up trump
now

CYNT Then I find its like cards if either of us have a good hand it
is an accident of fortune

MEL No marriage is rather like a game at bowls fortune indeed makes
the match and the two nearest and sometimes the two farthest are
together but the game depends entirely upon judgment

CYNT Still it is a game and consequently one of us must be a loser

MEL Not at all only a friendly trial of skill and the winnings to be
laid out in an entertainment Whats here the music Oh my lord has
promised the company a new song well get em to give it us by the way
_Musicians crossing the stage_ Pray let us have the favour of you to
practise the song before the company hear it

SONG

I

Cynthia frowns wheneer I woo her
Yet shes vext if I give over
Much she fears I should undo her
But much more to lose her lover
Thus in doubting she refuses
And not winning thus she loses

II

Prithee Cynthia look behind you
Age and wrinkles will oertake you
Then too late desire will find you
When the power must forsake you
Think O think o th sad condition
To be past yet wish fruition

MEL You shall have my thanks below _To the musicians_ _they go
out_



SCENE IV


_To them_ SIR PAUL PLYANT _and_ LADY PLYANT

SIR PAUL Gadsbud I am provoked into a fermentation as my Lady Froth
says was ever the like read of in story

LADY PLYANT Sir Paul have patience let me alone to rattle him up

SIR PAUL Pray your ladyship give me leave to be angry Ill rattle
him up I warrant you Ill firk him with a _certiorari_

LADY PLYANT You firk him Ill firk him myself pray Sir Paul hold
you contented

CYNT Bless me what makes my father in such a passion I never saw him
thus before

SIR PAUL Hold yourself contented my Lady Plyant I find passion
coming upon me by inflation and I cannot submit as formerly therefore
give way

LADY PLYANT How now will you be pleased to retire and

SIR PAUL No marry will I not be pleased I am pleased to be angry
thats my pleasure at this time

MEL What can this mean

LADY PLYANT Gads my life the mans distracted why how now who are
you What am I Slidikins cant I govern you What did I marry you
for Am I not to be absolute and uncontrollable Is it fit a woman of
my spirit and conduct should be contradicted in a matter of this concern

SIR PAUL It concerns me and only me Besides Im not to be governed
at all times When I am in tranquillity my Lady Plyant shall command
Sir Paul but when I am provoked to fury I cannot incorporate with
patience and reason as soon may tigers match with tigers lambs with
lambs and every creature couple with its foe as the poet says

LADY PLYANT Hes hotheaded still Tis in vain to talk to you but
remember I have a curtainlecture for you you disobedient headstrong
brute

SIR PAUL No tis because I wont be headstrong because I wont be a
brute and have my head fortified that I am thus exasperated But I
will protect my honour and yonder is the violator of my fame

LADY PLYANT Tis my honour that is concerned and the violation was
intended to me Your honour You have none but what is in my keeping
and I can dispose of it when I please therefore dont provoke me

SIR PAUL Hum gadsbud she says true Well my lady march on I will
fight under you then I am convinced as far as passion will permit
LADY PLYANT _and_ SIR PAUL _come up to_ MELLEFONT

LADY PLYANT Inhuman and treacherous

SIR PAUL Thou serpent and first tempter of womankind

CYNT Bless me Sir madam what mean you

SIR PAUL Thy Thy come away Thy touch him not Come hither girl
go not near him theres nothing but deceit about him Snakes are in his
peruke and the crocodile of Nilus is in his belly he will eat thee up
alive

LADY PLYANT Dishonourable impudent creature

MEL For heavns sake madam to whom do you direct this language

LADY PLYANT Have I behaved myself with all the decorum and nicety
befitting the person of Sir Pauls wife Have I preserved my honour as
it were in a snowhouse for these three years past Have I been white
and unsullied even by Sir Paul himself

SIR PAUL Nay she has been an invincible wife even to me thats the
truth ont

LADY PLYANT Have I I say preserved myself like a fair sheet of paper
for you to make a blot upon

SIR PAUL And she shall make a simile with any woman in England

MEL I am so amazed I know not what to say

SIR PAUL Do you think my daughter this pretty creaturegadsbud shes
a wife for a cherubimdo you think her fit for nothing but to be a
stalking horse to stand before you while you take aim at my wife
Gadsbud I was never angry before in my life and Ill never be appeased
again

MEL Hell and damnation This is my aunt such malice can be engendered
nowhere else _Aside_

LADY PLYANT Sir Paul take Cynthia from his sight leave me to strike
him with the remorse of his intended crime

CYNT Pray sir stay hear him I dare affirm hes innocent

SIR PAUL Innocent Why harkeecome hither Thyharkee I had it
from his aunt my sister Touchwood Gadsbud he does not care a farthing
for anything of thee but thy portion Why hes in love with my wife He
would have tantalised thee and made a cuckold of thy poor father and
that would certainly have broke my heart Im sure if ever I should
have horns they would kill me they would never come kindlyI should
die of em like a child that was cutting his teethI should indeed
Thytherefore come away but providence has prevented all therefore
come away when I bid you

CYNT I must obey



SCENE V


LADY PLYANT MELLEFONT

LADY PLYANT Oh such a thing the impiety of it startles meto wrong
so good so fair a creature and one that loves you tenderlytis a
barbarity of barbarities and nothing could be guilty of it

MEL But the greatest villain imagination can form I grant it and next
to the villainy of such a fact is the villainy of aspersing me with the
guilt How which way was I to wrong her For yet I understand you not

LADY PLYANT Why gads my life cousin Mellefont you cannot be so
peremptory as to deny it when I tax you with it to your face for now
Sir Pauls gone you are _corum nobus_

MEL By heavn I love her more than life or

LADY PLYANT Fiddle faddle dont tell me of this and that and
everything in the world but give me mathemacular demonstration answer
me directly But I have not patience Oh the impiety of it as I was
saying and the unparalleled wickedness O merciful Father How could
you think to reverse nature so to make the daughter the means of
procuring the mother

MEL The daughter to procure the mother

LADY PLYANT Ay for though I am not Cynthias own mother I am her
fathers wife and thats near enough to make it incest

MEL Incest O my precious aunt and the devil in conjunction
_Aside_

LADY PLYANT Oh reflect upon the horror of that and then the guilt of
deceiving everybody marrying the daughter only to make a cuckold of the
father and then seducing me debauching my purity and perverting me
from the road of virtue in which I have trod thus long and never made
one trip not one _faux pas_ Oh consider it What would you have to
answer for if you should provoke me to frailty Alas humanity is
feeble heavn knows very feeble and unable to support itself

MEL Where am I is it day and am I awake Madam

LADY PLYANT And nobody knows how circumstances may happen together To
my thinking now I could resist the strongest temptation But yet I
know tis impossible for me to know whether I could or not theres no
certainty in the things of this life

MEL Madam pray give me leave to ask you one question

LADY PLYANT O Lord ask me the question Ill swear Ill refuse it I
swear Ill deny ittherefore dont ask me nay you shant ask me I
swear Ill deny it O Gemini you have brought all the blood into my
face I warrant I am as red as a turkeycock O fie cousin Mellefont

MEL Nay madam hear me I mean

LADY PLYANT Hear you No no Ill deny you first and hear you
afterwards For one does not know how ones mind may change upon
hearing Hearing is one of the senses and all the senses are fallible
I wont trust my honour I assure you my honour is infallible and
uncomeatable

MEL For heavns sake madam

LADY PLYANT Oh name it no more Bless me how can you talk of heavn
and have so much wickedness in your heart May be you dont think it a
sinthey say some of you gentlemen dont think it a sin May be it is
no sin to them that dont think it so indeed if I did not think it a
sinBut still my honour if it were no sin But then to marry my
daughter for the conveniency of frequent opportunities Ill never
consent to that as sure as can be Ill break the match

MEL Death and amazement Madam upon my knees

LADY PLYANT Nay nay rise up come you shall see my goodnature I
know love is powerful and nobody can help his passion Tis not your
fault nor I swear it is not mine How can I help it if I have
charms And how can you help it if you are made a captive I swear it
is pity it should be a fault But my honourwell but your honour
toobut the sinwell but the necessityO Lord heres somebody
coming I dare not stay Well you must consider of your crime and
strive as much as can be against itstrive be sure But dont be
melancholic dont despair But never think that Ill grant you
anything O Lord no But be sure you lay aside all thoughts of the
marriage for though I know you dont love Cynthia only as a blind for
your passion to me yet it will make me jealous O Lord what did I say
Jealous no no I cant be jealous for I must not love you therefore
dont hopebut dont despair neither Oh theyre coming I must fly



SCENE VI


MELLEFONT _alone_

MEL _After a pause_ So then spite of my care and foresight I am
caught caught in my security Yet this was but a shallow artifice
unworthy of my Machiavellian aunt There must be more behind this is
but the first flash the priming of her engine Destruction follows
hard if not most presently prevented



SCENE VII


_To him_ MASKWELL

MEL Maskwell welcome thy presence is a view of land appearing to my
shipwrecked hopes The witch has raised the storm and her ministers
have done their work you see the vessels are parted

MASK I know it I met Sir Paul towing away Cynthia Come trouble not
your head Ill join you together ere tomorrow morning or drown between
you in the attempt

MEL Theres comfort in a hand stretched out to one thats sinking
though neer so far off

MASK No sinking nor no danger Come cheer up why you dont know
that while I plead for you your aunt has given me a retaining fee Nay
I am your greatest enemy and she does but journeywork under me

MEL Ha hows this

MASK What dye think of my being employed in the execution of all her
plots Ha ha ha by heavn its true I have undertaken to break the
match I have undertaken to make your uncle disinherit you to get you
turned out of doors and toha ha ha I cant tell you for laughing
Oh she has opened her heart to me I am to turn you agrazing and
toha ha ha marry Cynthia myself Theres a plot for you

MEL Ha Oh see I see my rising sun Light breaks through clouds
upon me and I shall live in dayOh my Maskwell how shall I thank or
praise thee Thou hast outwitted woman But tell me how couldst thou
thus get into her confidence Ha How But was it her contrivance to
persuade my Lady Plyant to this extravagant belief

MASK It was and to tell you the truth I encouraged it for your
diversion Though it made you a little uneasy for the present yet the
reflection of it must needs be entertaining I warrant she was very
violent at first

MEL Ha ha ha ay a very fury but I was most afraid of her violence
at last If you had not come as you did I dont know what she might
have attempted

MASK Ha ha ha I know her temper Well you must know then that
all my contrivances were but bubbles till at last I pretended to have
been long secretly in love with Cynthia that did my business that
convinced your aunt I might be trusted since it was as much my interest
as hers to break the match Then she thought my jealousy might qualify
me to assist her in her revenge And in short in that belief told me
the secrets of her heart At length we made this agreement if I
accomplish her designs as I told you before she has engaged to put
Cynthia with all her fortune into my power

MEL She is most gracious in her favour Well and dear Jack how hast
thou contrived

MASK I would not have you stay to hear it now for I dont know but she
may come this way I am to meet her anon after that Ill tell you the
whole matter Be here in this gallery an hour hence by that time I
imagine our consultation may be over

MEL I will till then success attend thee



SCENE VIII


MASKWELL _alone_

Till then success will attend me for when I meet you I meet the only
obstacle to my fortune Cynthia let thy beauty gild my crimes and
whatsoever I commit of treachery or deceit shall be imputed to me as a
merit Treachery What treachery Love cancels all the bonds of
friendship and sets men right upon their first foundations

Duty to kings piety to parents gratitude to benefactors and fidelity
to friends are different and particular ties But the name of rival
cuts em all asunder and is a general acquittance Rival is equal and
love like death an universal leveller of mankind Ha But is there not
such a thing as honesty Yes and whosoever has it about him bears an
enemy in his breast For your honest man as I take it is that nice
scrupulous conscientious person who will cheat nobody but himself such
another coxcomb as your wise man who is too hard for all the world and
will be made a fool of by nobody but himself ha ha ha Well for
wisdom and honesty give me cunning and hypocrisy oh tis such a
pleasure to angle for fairfaced fools Then that hungry gudgeon
credulity will bite at anything Why let me see I have the same face
the same words and accents when I speak what I do think and when I speak
what I do not think the very same and dear dissimulation is the only
art not to be known from nature

 Why will mankind be fools and be deceived
 And why are friends and lovers oaths believed
 When each who searches strictly his own mind
 May so much fraud and power of baseness find




ACT III


SCENE I


LORD TOUCHWOOD _and_ LADY TOUCHWOOD

LADY TOUCH My lord can you blame my brother Plyant if he refuse his
daughter upon this provocation The contracts void by this unheardof
impiety

LORD TOUCH I dont believe it true he has better principles Pho
tis nonsense Come come I know my Lady Plyant has a large eye and
would centre everything in her own circle tis not the first time she
has mistaken respect for love and made Sir Paul jealous of the civility
of an undesigning person the better to bespeak his security in her
unfeigned pleasures

LADY TOUCH You censure hardly my lord my sisters honour is very well
known

LORD TOUCH Yes I believe I know some that have been familiarly
acquainted with it This is a little trick wrought by some pitiful
contriver envious of my nephews merit

LADY TOUCH Nay my lord it may be so and I hope it will be found so
But that will require some time for in such a case as this
demonstration is necessary

LORD TOUCH There should have been demonstration of the contrary too
before it had been believed

LADY TOUCH So I suppose there was

LORD TOUCH How Where When

LADY TOUCH That I cant tell nay I dont say there was I am willing
to believe as favourably of my nephew as I can

LORD TOUCH I dont know that _Half aside_

LADY TOUCH How Dont you believe that say you my lord

LORD TOUCH No I dont say so I confess I am troubled to find you so
cold in his defence

LADY TOUCH His defence Bless me would you have me defend an ill
thing

LORD TOUCH You believe it then

LADY TOUCH I dont know I am very unwilling to speak my thoughts in
anything that may be to my cousins disadvantage besides I find my
lord you are prepared to receive an ill impression from any opinion of
mine which is not consenting with your own But since I am like to be
suspected in the end and tis a pain any longer to dissemble I own it
to you in short I do believe it nay and can believe anything worse if
it were laid to his charge Dont ask me my reasons my lord for they
are not fit to be told you

LORD TOUCH Im amazed there must be something more than ordinary in
this _Aside_ Not fit to be told me madam You can have no
interests wherein I am not concerned and consequently the same reasons
ought to be convincing to me which create your satisfaction or disquiet

LADY TOUCH But those which cause my disquiet I am willing to have
remote from your hearing Good my lord dont press me

LORD TOUCH Dont oblige me to press you

LADY TOUCH Whatever it was tis past And that is better to be
unknown which cannot be prevented therefore let me beg you to rest
satisfied

LORD TOUCH When you have told me I will

LADY TOUCH You wont

LORD TOUCH By my life my dear I will

LADY TOUCH What if you cant

LORD TOUCH How Then I must know nay I will No more trifling I
charge you tell me By all our mutual peace to come upon your duty

LADY TOUCH Nay my lord you need say no more to make me lay my heart
before you but dont be thus transported compose yourself It is not
of concern to make you lose one minutes temper Tis not indeed my
dear Nay by this kiss you shant be angry O Lord I wish I had not
told you anything Indeed my lord you have frighted me Nay look
pleased Ill tell you

LORD TOUCH Well well

LADY TOUCH Nay but will you be calm Indeed its nothing but

LORD TOUCH But what

LADY TOUCH But will you promise me not to be angry Nay you mustnot
to be angry with Mellefont I dare swear hes sorry and were it to do
again would not

LORD TOUCH Sorry for what Death you rack me with delay

LADY TOUCH Nay no great matter onlywell I have your promise Pho
why nothing only your nephew had a mind to amuse himself sometimes with
a little gallantry towards me Nay I cant think he meant anything
seriously but methought it looked oddly

LORD TOUCH Confusion and hell what do I hear

LADY TOUCH Or may be he thought he was not enough akin to me upon
your account and had a mind to create a nearer relation on his own a
lover you know my lord Ha ha ha Well but thats all Now you
have it well remember your promise my lord and dont take any notice
of it to him

LORD TOUCH No no no Damnation

LADY TOUCH Nay I swear you must not A little harmless mirth only
misplaced thats all But if it were more tis over now and alls
well For my part I have forgot it and so has he I hopefor I have
not heard anything from him these two days

LORD TOUCH These two days Is it so fresh Unnatural villain Death
Ill have him stripped and turned naked out of my doors this moment and
let him rot and perish incestuous brute

LADY TOUCH Oh for heavns sake my lord youll ruin me if you take
such public notice of it it will be a town talk Consider your own and
my honour nay I told you you would not be satisfied when you knew it

LORD TOUCH Before Ive done I will be satisfied Ungrateful monster
how long

LADY TOUCH Lord I dont know I wish my lips had grown together when I
told you Almost a twelvemonth Nay I wont tell you any more till you
are yourself Pray my lord dont let the company see you in this
disorder Yet I confess I cant blame you for I think I was never so
surprised in my life Who would have thought my nephew could have so
misconstrued my kindness But will you go into your closet and recover
your temper Ill make an excuse of sudden business to the company and
come to you Pray good dear my lord let me beg you do now Ill come
immediately and tell you all will you my lord

LORD TOUCH I willI am mute with wonder

LADY TOUCH Well but go now heres somebody coming

LORD TOUCH Well I go You wont stay for I would hear more of this

LADY TOUCH I follow instantly So



SCENE II


LADY TOUCHWOOD MASKWELL

MASK This was a masterpiece and did not need my help though I stood
ready for a cue to come in and confirm all had there been occasion

LADY TOUCH Have you seen Mellefont

MASK I have and am to meet him here about this time

LADY TOUCH How does he bear his disappointment

MASK Secure in my assistance he seemed not much afflicted but rather
laughed at the shallow artifice which so little time must of necessity
discover Yet he is apprehensive of some farther design of yours and
has engaged me to watch you I believe he will hardly be able to prevent
your plot yet I would have you use caution and expedition

LADY TOUCH Expedition indeed for all we do must be performed in the
remaining part of this evening and before the company break up lest my
lord should cool and have an opportunity to talk with him privately My
lord must not see him again

MASK By no means therefore you must aggravate my lords displeasure to
a degree that will admit of no conference with him What think you of
mentioning me

LADY TOUCH How

MASK To my lord as having been privy to Mellefonts design upon you
but still using my utmost endeavours to dissuade him though my
friendship and love to him has made me conceal it yet you may say I
threatened the next time he attempted anything of that kind to discover
it to my lord

LADY TOUCH To what end is this

MASK It will confirm my lords opinion of my honour and honesty and
create in him a new confidence in me which should this design miscarry
will be necessary to the forming another plot that I have in my headTo
cheat you as well as the rest _Aside_

LADY TOUCH Ill do itIll tell him you hindered him once from forcing
me

MASK Excellent Your ladyship has a most improving fancy You had
best go to my lord keep him as long as you can in his closet and I
doubt not but you will mould him to what you please your guests are so
engaged in their own follies and intrigues theyll miss neither of you

LADY TOUCH When shall we meetat eight this evening in my chamber
There rejoice at our success and toy away an hour in mirth

MASK I will not fail



SCENE III


MASKWELL _alone_

I know what she means by toying away an hour well enough Pox I have
lost all appetite to her yet shes a fine woman and I loved her once
But I dont know since I have been in a great measure kept by her the
case is altered what was my pleasure is become my duty and I have as
little stomach to her now as if I were her husband Should she smoke my
design upon Cynthia I were in a fine pickle She has a damned
penetrating head and knows how to interpret a coldness the right way
therefore I must dissemble ardour and ecstasy thats resolved How
easily and pleasantly is that dissembled before fruition Pox ont that
a man cant drink without quenching his thirst Ha yonder comes
Mellefont thoughtful Let me think Meet her at eighthumha By
heavn I have itIf I can speak to my lord before Was it my brain or
providence No matter whichI will deceive em all and yet secure
myself Twas a lucky thought Well this doubledealing is a jewel
Here he comes now for me MASKWELL _pretending not to see him_
_walks by him_ _and speaks as it were to himself_



SCENE IV


_To him_ MELLEFONT _musing_

MASK Mercy on us what will the wickedness of this world come to

MEL How now Jack What so full of contemplation that you run over

MASK Im glad youre come for I could not contain myself any longer
and was just going to give vent to a secret which nobody but you ought
to drink down Your aunts just gone from hence

MEL And having trusted thee with the secrets of her soul thou art
villainously bent to discover em all to me ha

MASK Im afraid my frailty leans that way But I dont know whether I
can in honour discover em all

MEL All all man What you may in honour betray her as far as she
betrays herself No tragical design upon my person I hope

MASK No but its a comical design upon mine

MEL What dost thou mean

MASK Listen and be dumb we have been bargaining about the rate of your
ruin

MEL Like any two guardians to an orphan heiress Well

MASK And whereas pleasure is generally paid with mischief what
mischief I do is to be paid with pleasure

MEL So when youve swallowed the potion you sweeten your mouth with a
plum

MASK You are merry sir but I shall probe your constitution In
short the price of your banishment is to be paid with the person of

MEL Of Cynthia and her fortune Why you forget you told me this
before

MASK No no So far you are right and I am as an earnest of that
bargain to have full and free possession of the person ofyour aunt

MEL Ha Pho you trifle

MASK By this light Im serious all raillery apart I knew twould
stun you This evening at eight she will receive me in her bedchamber

MEL Hell and the devil is she abandoned of all grace Why the woman
is possessed

MASK Well will you go in my stead

MEL By heavn into a hot furnace sooner

MASK No you would not it would not be so convenient as I can order
matters

MEL What dye mean

MASK Mean Not to disappoint the lady I assure you Ha ha ha how
gravely he looks Come come I wont perplex you Tis the only thing
that providence could have contrived to make me capable of serving you
either to my inclination or your own necessity

MEL How how for heavns sake dear Maskwell

MASK Why thus Ill go according to appointment you shall have
notice at the critical minute to come and surprise your aunt and me
together Counterfeit a rage against me and Ill make my escape through
the private passage from her chamber which Ill take care to leave open
Twill be hard if then you cant bring her to any conditions For this
discovery will disarm her of all defence and leave her entirely at your
mercynay she must ever after be in awe of you

MEL Let me adore thee my better genius By heavn I think it is not
in the power of fate to disappoint my hopesmy hopes My certainty

MASK Well Ill meet you here within a quarter of eight and give you
notice

MEL Good fortune ever go along with thee

CARE Mellefont get out o th way my Lady Plyants coming and I
shall never succeed while thou art in sight Though she begins to tack
about but I made love a great while to no purpose

MEL Why whats the matter Shes convinced that I dont care for her

CARE I cant get an answer from her that does not begin with her
honour or her virtue her religion or some such cant Then she has
told me the whole history of Sir Pauls nine years courtship how he has
lain for whole nights together upon the stairs before her chamberdoor
and that the first favour he received from her was a piece of an old
scarlet petticoat for a stomacher which since the day of his marriage he
has out of a piece of gallantry converted into a nightcap and wears it
still with much solemnity on his anniversary weddingnight

MEL That I have seen with the ceremony thereunto belonging For on
that night he creeps in at the beds feet like a gulled bassa that has
married a relation of the Grand Signior and that night he has his arms
at liberty Did not she tell you at what a distance she keeps him He
has confessed to me that but at some certain times that is I suppose
when she apprehends being with child he never has the privilege of using
the familiarity of a husband with a wife He was once given to
scrambling with his hands and sprawling in his sleep and ever since she
has him swaddled up in blankets and his hands and feet swathed down and
so put to bed and there he lies with a great beard like a Russian bear
upon a drift of snow You are very great with him I wonder he never
told you his grievances he will I warrant you

CARE Excessively foolish But that which gives me most hopes of her is
her telling me of the many temptations she has resisted

MEL Nay then you have her for a womans bragging to a man that she
has overcome temptations is an argument that they were weakly offered
and a challenge to him to engage her more irresistibly Tis only an
enhancing the price of the commodity by telling you how many customers
have underbid her

CARE Nay I dont despair But still she has a grudging to you I
talked to her tother night at my Lord Froths masquerade when Im
satisfied she knew me and I had no reason to complain of my reception
but I find women are not the same barefaced and in masks and a vizor
disguises their inclinations as much as their faces

MEL Tis a mistake for women may most properly be said to be unmasked
when they wear vizors for that secures them from blushing and being out
of countenance and next to being in the dark or alone they are most
truly themselves in a vizor mask Here they come Ill leave you Ply
her close and by and by clap a _billet doux_ into her hand for a woman
never thinks a man truly in love with her till he has been fool enough
to think of her out of her sight and to lose so much time as to write to
her



SCENE VI


CARELESS SIR PAUL _and_ LADY PLYANT

SIR PAUL Shant we disturb your meditation Mr Careless You would be
private

CARE You bring that along with you Sir Paul that shall be always
welcome to my privacy

SIR PAUL O sweet sir you load your humble servants both me and my
wife with continual favours

LADY PLYANT Sir Paul what a phrase was there You will be making
answers and taking that upon you which ought to lie upon me That you
should have so little breeding to think Mr Careless did not apply
himself to me Pray what have you to entertain anybodys privacy I
swear and declare in the face of the world Im ready to blush for your
ignorance

SIR PAUL I acquiesce my lady but dont snub so loud _Aside to
her_

LADY PLYANT Mr Careless if a person that is wholly illiterate might
be supposed to be capable of being qualified to make a suitable return to
those obligations which you are pleased to confer upon one that is
wholly incapable of being qualified in all those circumstances Im sure
I should rather attempt it than anything in the world _Courtesies_ for
Im sure theres nothing in the world that I would rather _Courtesies_
But I know Mr Careless is so great a critic and so fine a gentleman
that it is impossible for me

CARE O heavens madam you confound me

SIR PAUL Gadsbud shes a fine person

LADY PLYANT O Lord sir pardon me we women have not those advantages
I know my imperfections But at the same time you must give me leave to
declare in the face of the world that nobody is more sensible of favours
and things for with the reserve of my honour I assure you Mr Careless
I dont know anything in the world I would refuse to a person so
meritorious Youll pardon my want of expression

CARE O your ladyship is abounding in all excellence particularly that
of phrase

If that can ever be

LADY PLYANT O you overcome me That is so excessive

SIR PAUL Nay I swear and vow that was pretty

CARE O Sir Paul you are the happiest man alive Such a lady that is
the envy of her own sex and the admiration of ours

SIR PAUL Your humble servant I am I thank heaven in a fine way of
living as I may say peacefully and happily and I think need not envy
any of my neighbours blessed be providence Ay truly Mr Careless my
lady is a great blessing a fine discreet wellspoken woman as you

CARELESS SIR PAUL LADY PLYANT

SIR PAUL A humour of my wifes you know women have little fancies But
as I was telling you Mr Careless if it were not for one thing I
should think myself the happiest man in the world indeed that touches me
near very near

CARE What can that be Sir Paul

SIR PAUL Why I have I thank heaven a very plentiful fortune a good
estate in the country some houses in town and some money a pretty
tolerable personal estate and it is a great grief to me indeed it is
Mr Careless that I have not a son to inherit this Tis true I have a
daughter and a fine dutiful child she is though I say it blessed be
providence I may say for indeed Mr Careless I am mightily beholden to
providence A poor unworthy sinner But if I had a son Ah thats my
affliction and my only affliction indeed I cannot refrain tears when it
comes in my mind _Cries_

CARE Why methinks that might be easily remediedmy ladys a fine
likely woman

SIR PAUL Oh a fine likely woman as you shall see in a summers day

SIR PAUL Alas thats not it Mr Careless ah thats not it no no

Careless no no thats not it

CARE No What can be the matter then

SIR PAUL Youll scarcely believe me when I shall tell youmy lady is

that I dont believe she would touch a man for the world At least not
above once a year Im sure I have found it so and alas whats once a
year to an old man who would do good in his generation Indeed its
true Mr Careless it breaks my heart I am her husband as I may say
though far unworthy of that honour yet I am her husband but alasaday
I have no more familiarity with her personas to that matterthan with

SCENE IX


_To them_ LORD FROTH CYNTHIA

SIR PAUL How does my girl Come hither to thy father poor lamb
thourt melancholic

LORD FROTH Heaven Sir Paul you amaze me of all things in the world
You are never pleased but when we are all upon the broad grin all laugh
and no company ah then tis such a sight to see some teeth Sure
youre a great admirer of my Lady Whifler Mr Sneer and Sir Laurence
Loud and that gang

SIR PAUL I vow and swear shes a very merry woman but I think she
laughs a little too much

LORD FROTH Merry O Lord what a character that is of a woman of
quality You have been at my Lady Whiflers upon her day madam

CYNT Yes my lord I must humour this fool _Aside_

LORD FROTH Well and how hee What is your sense of the conversation

CYNT Oh most ridiculous a perpetual comfort of laughing without any
harmony for sure my lord to laugh out of time is as disagreeable as
to sing out of time or out of tune

LORD FROTH Hee hee hee right and then my Lady Whifler is so
readyshe always comes in three bars too soon And then what do they
laugh at For you know laughing without a jest is as impertinent hee
as as

CYNT As dancing without a fiddle

LORD FROTH Just ifaith that was at my tongues end

CYNT But that cannot be properly said of them for I think they are all
in good nature with the world and only laugh at one another and you
must allow they have all jests in their persons though they have none in
their conversation

LORD FROTH True as Im a person of honour For heavens sake let us
sacrifice em to mirth a little _Enter_ BOY _and whispers_ SIR PAUL

SIR PAUL Gads soWife wife my Lady Plyant I have a word

LADY PLYANT Im busy Sir Paul I wonder at your impertinence

SCENE X


CYNTHIA LORD FROTH LADY FROTH BRISK

LADY FROTH Then you think that episode between Susan the dairymaid
and our coachman is not amiss you know I may suppose the dairy in town
as well as in the country

BRISK Incomparable let me perish But then being an heroic poem had
you not better call him a charioteer Charioteer sounds great besides
your ladyships coachman having a red face and you comparing him to the
sunand you know the sun is called Heavens charioteer

LADY FROTH Oh infinitely better Im extremely beholden to you for the
hint stay well read over those half a score lines again _Pulls out
a paper_ Let me see here you know what goes beforethe comparison
you know _Reads_

 For as the sun shines evry day
 So of our coachman I may say

BRISK Im afraid that simile wont do in wet weather because you say
the sun shines every day

LADY FROTH No for the sun it wont but it will do for the coachman
for you know theres most occasion for a coach in wet weather

BRISK Right right that saves all

LADY FROTH Then I dont say the sun shines all the day but that he
peeps now and then yet he does shine all the day too you know though
we dont see him

BRISK Right but the vulgar will never comprehend that

LADY FROTH Well you shall hear Let me see _Reads_

 For as the sun shines evry day
 So of our coachman I may say
 He shows his drunken fiery face
 Just as the sun does more or less

BRISK Thats right alls well alls well More or less

LADY FROTH reads

 And when at night his labours done
 Then too like Heavns charioteer the sun

Ay charioteer does better

 Into the dairy he descends
 And there his whipping and his driving ends
 There hes secure from danger of a bilk
 His fare is paid him and he sets in milk

For Susan you know is Thetis and so

BRISK Incomparable well and proper egadbut I have one exception to
makedont you think bilkI know its good rhymebut dont you think
_bilk_ and _fare_ too like a hackney coachman

LADY FROTH I swear and vow Im afraid so And yet our Jehu was a
hackney coachman when my lord took him

BRISK Was he Im answered if Jehu was a hackney coachman You may
put that in the marginal notes though to prevent criticismonly mark it
with a small asterism and say Jehu was formerly a hackney coachman

LADY FROTH I will Youd oblige me extremely to write notes to the
whole poem

BRISK With all my heart and soul and proud of the vast honour let me
perish

LORD FROTH Hee hee hee my dear have you done wont you join with
us We were laughing at my Lady Whifler and Mr Sneer

LADY FROTH Ay my dear were you Oh filthy Mr Sneer hes a
nauseous figure a most fulsamic fop foh He spent two days together in
going about Covent Garden to suit the lining of his coach with his
complexion

LORD FROTH O silly yet his aunt is as fond of him as if she had
brought the ape into the world herself

BRISK Who my Lady Toothless Oh shes a mortifying spectacle shes
always chewing the cud like an old ewe

CYNT Fie Mr Brisk eringos for her cough

LADY FROTH I have seen her take em half chewed out of her mouth to
laugh and then put em in again Foh

LORD FROTH Foh

LADY FROTH Then shes always ready to laugh when Sneer offers to speak
and sits in expectation of his no jest with her gums bare and her mouth
open

BRISK Like an oyster at low ebb egad Ha ha ha

CYNT _Aside_ Well I find there are no fools so inconsiderable in
themselves but they can render other people contemptible by exposing
their infirmities

LADY FROTH Then that tother great strapping ladyI cant hit of her
name the old fat fool that paints so exorbitantly

BRISK I know whom you meanbut deuce take me I cant hit of her name
neither Paints dye say Why she lays it on with a trowel Then she
has a great beard that bristles through it and makes her look as if she
were plastered with lime and hair let me perish

LADY FROTH Oh you made a song upon her Mr Brisk

BRISK He egad so I did My lord can sing it

CYNT O good my lord lets hear it

BRISK Tis not a song neither its a sort of an epigram or rather an
epigrammatic sonnet I dont know what to call it but its satire Sing
it my lord

LORD FROTH sings

 Ancient Phyllis has young graces
 Tis a strange thing but a true one
 Shall I tell you how
 She herself makes her own faces
 And each morning wears a new one
 Wheres the wonder now

BRISK Short but theres salt int my way of writing egad



SCENE XI


_To them_ FOOTMAN

LADY FROTH How now

FOOT Your ladyships chair is come

LADY FROTH Is nurse and the child in it

FOOT Yes madam

LADY FROTH O the dear creature Lets go see it

LORD FROTH I swear my dear youll spoil that child with sending it
to and again so often this is the seventh time the chair has gone for
her today

LADY FROTH O law I swear its but the sixthand I havent seen her
these two hours The poor creatureI swear my lord you dont love
poor little Sapho Come my dear Cynthia Mr Brisk well go see Sapho
though my lord wont

CYNT Ill wait upon your ladyship

BRISK Pray madam how old is Lady Sapho

LADY FROTH Threequarters but I swear she has a world of wit and can
sing a tune already My lord wont you go Wont you What not to
see Saph Pray my lord come see little Saph I knew you could not
stay



SCENE XII


CYNTHIA _alone_

CYNT Tis not so hard to counterfeit joy in the depth of affliction as
to dissemble mirth in company of fools Why should I call em fools The
world thinks better of em for these have quality and education wit and
fine conversation are received and admired by the world If not they
like and admire themselves And why is not that true wisdom for tis
happiness and for ought I know we have misapplied the name all this
while and mistaken the thing since

 If happiness in selfcontent is placed
 The wise are wretched and fools only blessd




ACT IV


SCENE I


MELLEFONT _and_ CYNTHIA

CYNT I heard him loud as I came by the closetdoor and my lady with
him but she seemed to moderate his passion

MEL Ay hell thank her as gentle breezes moderate a fire but I shall
counterwork her spells and ride the witch in her own bridle

CYNT Its impossible shell cast beyond you still Ill lay my life
it will never be a match

MEL What

CYNT Between you and me

MEL Why so

CYNT My mind gives me it wont because we are both willing We each
of us strive to reach the goal and hinder one another in the race I
swear it never does well when the parties are so agreed for when people
walk hand in hand theres neither overtaking nor meeting We hunt in
couples where we both pursue the same game but forget one another and
tis because we are so near that we dont think of coming together

MEL Hum gad I believe theres something in it Marriage is the game
that we hunt and while we think that we only have it in view I dont
see but we have it in our power

CYNT Within reach for example give me your hand You have looked
through the wrong end of the perspective all this while for nothing has
been between us but our fears

MEL I dont know why we should not steal out of the house this very
moment and marry one another without consideration or the fear of
repentance Pox o fortune portion settlements and jointures

CYNT Ay ay what have we to do with em You know we marry for love

MEL Love love downright very villainous love

CYNT And he that cant live upon love deserves to die in a ditch Here
then I give you my promise in spite of duty any temptation of wealth
your inconstancy or my own inclination to change

MEL To run most wilfully and unreasonably away with me this moment and
be married

CYNT Hold Never to marry anybody else

MEL Thats but a kind of negative consent Why you wont baulk the
frolic

CYNT If you had not been so assured of your own conduct I would not
But tis but reasonable that since I consent to like a man without the
vile consideration of money he should give me a very evident
demonstration of his wit therefore let me see you undermine my Lady
Touchwood as you boasted and force her to give her consent and then

MEL Ill dot

CYNT And Ill dot

MEL This very next ensuing hour of eight oclock is the last minute of
her reign unless the devil assist her _in propria persona_

CYNT Well if the devil should assist her and your plot miscarry

MEL Ay what am I to trust to then

CYNT Why if you give me very clear demonstration that it was the
devil Ill allow for irresistible odds But if I find it to be only
chance or destiny or unlucky stars or anything but the very devil Im
inexorable only still Ill keep my word and live a maid for your sake

MEL And you wont die one for your own so still theres hope

CYNT Heres my motherinlaw and your friend Careless I would not
have em see us together yet



SCENE II


CARELESS _and_ LADY PLYANT

LADY PLYANT I swear Mr Careless you are very alluring and say so
many fine things and nothing is so moving to me as a fine thing Well
I must do you this justice and declare in the face of the world never
anybody gained so far upon me as yourself With blushes I must own it
you have shaken as I may say the very foundation of my honour Well
sure if I escape your importunities I shall value myself as long as I
live I swear

CARE And despise me _Sighing_

LADY PLYANT The last of any man in the world by my purity now you
make me swear O gratitude forbid that I should ever be wanting in a
respectful acknowledgment of an entire resignation of all my best wishes
for the person and parts of so accomplished a person whose merit
challenges much more Im sure than my illiterate praises can
description

CARE _In a whining tone_ Ah heavens madam you ruin me with
kindness Your charming tongue pursues the victory of your eyes while
at your feet your poor adorer dies

LADY PLYANT Ah Very fine

CARE _Still whining_ Ah why are you so fair so bewitching fair O
let me grow to the ground here and feast upon that hand O let me press
it to my heart my trembling heart the nimble movement shall instruct
your pulse and teach it to alarm desire Zoons Im almost at the end
of my cant if she does not yield quickly _Aside_

LADY PLYANT O thats so passionate and fine I cannot hear I am not
safe if I stay and must leave you

CARE And must you leave me Rather let me languish out a wretched
life and breath my soul beneath your feet I must say the same thing
over again and cant help it _Aside_

LADY PLYANT I swear Im ready to languish too O my honour Whither
is it going I protest you have given me the palpitation of the heart

CARE Can you be so cruel

LADY PLYANT O rise I beseech you say no more till you rise Why did
you kneel so long I swear I was so transported I did not see it Well
to show you how far you have gained upon me I assure you if Sir Paul
should die of all mankind theres none Id sooner make my second choice

CARE O Heaven I cant outlive this night without your favour I feel
my spirits faint a general dampness overspreads my face a cold deadly
dew already vents through all my pores and will tomorrow wash me for
ever from your sight and drown me in my tomb

LADY PLYANT Oh you have conquered sweet melting moving sir you
have conquered What heart of marble can refrain to weep and yield to
such sad sayings _Cries_

CARE I thank Heaven they are the saddest that I ever said Oh I
shall never contain laughter _Aside_

LADY PLYANT Oh I yield myself all up to your uncontrollable embraces
Say thou dear dying man when where and how Ah theres Sir Paul

CARE Slife yonders Sir Paul but if he were not come Im so
transported I cannot speak This note will inform you _Gives her a
note_



SCENE III


LADY PLYANT SIR PAUL CYNTHIA

SIR PAUL Thou art my tender lambkin and shalt do what thou wilt But
endeavour to forget this Mellefont

CYNT I would obey you to my power sir but if I have not him I have
sworn never to marry

SIR PAUL Never to marry Heavens forbid must I neither have sons nor
grandsons Must the family of the Plyants be utterly extinct for want of
issue male O impiety But did you swear did that sweet creature
swear ha How durst you swear without my consent ah Gadsbud who am
I

CYNT Pray dont be angry sir when I swore I had your consent and
therefore I swore

SIR PAUL Why then the revoking my consent does annul or make of none
effect your oath so you may unswear it again The law will allow it

CYNT Ay but my conscience never will

SIR PAUL Gadsbud no matter for that conscience and law never go
together you must not expect that

LADY PLYANT Ay but Sir Paul I conceive if she has sworn dye mark
me if she has once sworn it is most unchristian inhuman and obscene
that she should break it Ill make up the match again because Mr
Careless said it would oblige him _Aside_

SIR PAUL Does your ladyship conceive so Why I was of that opinion
once too Nay if your ladyship conceives so Im of that opinion again
but I can neither find my lord nor my lady to know what they intend

LADY PLYANT Im satisfied that my cousin Mellefont has been much
wronged

CYNT _Aside_ Im amazed to find her of our side for Im sure she
loved him

LADY PLYANT I know my Lady Touchwood has no kindness for him and
besides I have been informed by Mr Careless that Mellefont had never
anything more than a profound respect That he has owned himself to be
my admirer tis true but he was never so presumptuous to entertain any
dishonourable notions of things so that if this be made plain I dont
see how my daughter can in conscience or honour or anything in the
world

SIR PAUL Indeed if this be made plain as my lady your mother says
child

LADY PLYANT Plain I was informed of it by Mr Careless And I assure
you Mr Careless is a person that has a most extraordinary respect and
honour for you Sir Paul

CYNT _Aside_ And for your ladyship too I believe or else you had
not changed sides so soon now I begin to find it

SIR PAUL I am much obliged to Mr Careless really he is a person that
I have a great value for not only for that but because he has a great
veneration for your ladyship

LADY PLYANT O las no indeed Sir Paul tis upon your account

SIR PAUL No I protest and vow I have no title to his esteem but in
having the honour to appertain in some measure to your ladyship thats
all

LADY PLYANT O law now I swear and declare it shant be so youre too
modest Sir Paul

SIR PAUL It becomes me when there is any comparison made between

LADY PLYANT O fie fie Sir Paul youll put me out of countenance
Your very obedient and affectionate wife thats all And highly
honoured in that title

SIR PAUL Gadsbud I am transported Give me leave to kiss your
ladyships hand

CYNT That my poor father should be so very silly _Aside_

LADY PLYANT My lip indeed Sir Paul I swear you shall _He kisses
her_ _and bows very low_

SIR PAUL I humbly thank your ladyship I dont know whether I fly on
ground or walk in air Gadsbud she was never thus before Well I
must own myself the most beholden to Mr Careless As sure as can be
this is all his doing something that he has said well tis a rare
thing to have an ingenious friend Well your ladyship is of opinion
that the match may go forward

LADY PLYANT By all means Mr Careless has satisfied me of the matter

SIR PAUL Well why then lamb you may keep your oath but have a care
about making rash vows come hither to me and kiss papa

LADY PLYANT I swear and declare I am in such a twitter to read Mr
Careless his letter that I cant forbear any longer But though I may
read all letters first by prerogative yet Ill be sure to be unsuspected

letter which you had from your steward today I would look upon the
account again and may be increase your allowance

brave chopping boy Ill settle a thousand pound a year upon the rogue

its time girl why thou hast my leer hussey just thy fathers leer

a better Christian than to think of living a nun he Answer me

CYNT Im all obedience sir to your commands

expectation of my adored charmerDying Ned Careless Gadsbud would
that were matter of fact too Die and be damned for a Judas Maccabeus
and Iscariot both O friendship what art thou but a name Henceforward
let no man make a friend that would not be a cuckold for whomsoever he
receives into his bosom will find the way to his bed and there return
his caresses with interest to his wife Have I for this been pinioned
night after night for three years past Have I been swathed in blankets
till I have been even deprived of motion Have I approached the marriage
bed with reverence as to a sacred shrine and denied myself the enjoyment
of lawful domestic pleasures to preserve its purity and must I now find
it polluted by foreign iniquity O my Lady Plyant you were chaste as
ice but you are melted now and false as water But Providence has been
constant to me in discovering this conspiracy still I am beholden to
Providence If it were not for Providence sure poor Sir Paul thy
heart would break



SCENE X

anything at all in the world or no

LADY PLYANT I thought I should try you false man I that never
dissembled in my life yet to make trial of you pretended to like that
monster of iniquity Careless and found out that contrivance to let you

pretended coyness in their wives and I had a mind to try my ladys
virtue And when I could not prevail for you gad I pretended to be in

_To him_ LORD TOUCHWOOD

LORD TOUCH Maskwell you are the man I wished to meet

MASK I am happy to be in the way of your lordships commands

LORD TOUCH I have always found you prudent and careful in anything that
has concerned me or my family

MASK I were a villain else I am bound by duty and gratitude and my
own inclination to be ever your lordships servant

LORD TOUCH Enough You are my friend I know it Yet there has been a
thing in your knowledge which has concerned me nearly that you have
concealed from me

MASK My lord

LORD TOUCH Nay I excuse your friendship to my unnatural nephew thus
far But I know you have been privy to his impious designs upon my wife
This evening she has told me all Her good nature concealed it as long
as was possible but he perseveres so in villainy that she has told me
even you were weary of dissuading him though you have once actually
hindered him from forcing her

MASK I am sorry my lord I cant make you an answer this is an
occasion in which I would not willing be silent

LORD TOUCH I know you would excuse himand I know as well that you
cant

MASK Indeed I was in hopes it had been a youthful heat that might have
soon boiled over but

LORD TOUCH Say on

MASK I have nothing more to say my lord but to express my concern
for I think his frenzy increases daily

LORD TOUCH How Give me but proof of it ocular proof that I may
justify my dealing with him to the world and share my fortunes

MASK O my lord consider that is hard Besides time may work upon
him Then for me to do it I have professed an everlasting friendship
to him

LORD TOUCH He is your friend and what am I

MASK I am answered

LORD TOUCH Fear not his displeasure I will put you out of his and
fortunes power and for that thou art scrupulously honest I will secure
thy fidelity to him and give my honour never to own any discovery that
you shall make me Can you give me a demonstrative proof Speak

MASK I wish I could not To be plain my lord I intended this evening
to have tried all arguments to dissuade him from a design which I
suspect and if I had not succeeded to have informed your lordship of
what I knew

LORD TOUCH I thank you What is the villains purpose

MASK He has owned nothing to me of late and what I mean now is only a
bare suspicion of my own If your lordship will meet me a quarter of an
hour hence there in that lobby by my ladys bedchamber I shall be able
to tell you more

LORD TOUCH I will

MASK My duty to your lordship makes me do a severe piece of justice

LORD TOUCH I will be secret and reward your honesty beyond your hopes

LADY TOUCH You can excuse a fault too well not to have been to blame
A ready answer shows you were prepared

MASK Guilt is ever at a loss and confusion waits upon it when
innocence and bold truth are always ready for expression

LADY TOUCH Not in love words are the weak support of cold
indifference love has no language to be heard

MASK Excess of joy has made me stupid Thus may my lips be ever
closed _Kisses her_ And thusO who would not lose his speech upon
condition to have joys above it

LADY TOUCH Hold let me lock the door first _Goes to the door_

SCENE XXI


MELLEFONT _alone_

MEL Oh I could curse my stars fate and chance all causes and
accidents of fortune in this life But to what purpose Yet sdeath
for a man to have the fruit of all his industry grow full and ripe ready
to drop into his mouth and just when he holds out his hand to gather it
to have a sudden whirlwind come tear up tree and all and bear away the
very root and foundation of his hopeswhat temper can contain They
talk of sending Maskwell to me I never had more need of him But what
can he do Imagination cannot form a fairer and more plausible design
than this of his which has miscarried O my precious aunt I shall never
thrive without I deal with the devil or another woman

Women like flames have a destroying power

Neer to be quenched till they themselves devour




ACT V


SCENE I


LADY TOUCHWOOD _and_ MASKWELL

LADY TOUCH Wast not lucky

MASK Lucky Fortune is your own and tis her interest so to be By
heaven I believe you can control her power and she fears it though
chance brought my lord twas your own art that turned it to advantage

LADY TOUCH Tis true it might have been my ruin But yonders my lord
I believe hes coming to find you Ill not be seen



SCENE II


MASKWELL _alone_

MASK So I durst not own my introducing my lord though it succeeded
well for her for she would have suspected a design which I should have
been puzzled to excuse My lord is thoughtful Ill be so too yet he
shall know my thoughts or think he does



SCENE III


_To him_ LORD TOUCHWOOD

MASK What have I done

LORD TOUCH Talking to himself

MASK Twas honestand shall I be rewarded for it No twas honest
therefore I shant Nay rather therefore I ought not for it rewards
itself

LORD TOUCH Unequalled virtue _Aside_

MASK But should it be known then I have lost a friend He was an ill
man and I have gained for half myself I lent him and that I have
recalled so I have served myself and what is yet better I have served
a worthy lord to whom I owe myself

LORD TOUCH Excellent man _Aside_

MASK Yet I am wretched Oh there is a secret burns within this
breast which should it once blaze forth would ruin all consume my
honest character and brand me with the name of villain

LORD TOUCH Ha

MASK Why do I love Yet heaven and my waking conscience are my
witnesses I never gave one working thought a vent which might discover
that I loved nor ever must No let it prey upon my heart for I would
rather die than seem once barely seem dishonest Oh should it once
be known I love fair Cynthia all this that I have done would look like
rivals malice false friendship to my lord and base selfinterest Let
me perish first and from this hour avoid all sight and speech and if I
can all thought of that pernicious beauty Ha But what is my
distraction doing I am wildly talking to myself and some ill chance
might have directed malicious ears this way _Seems to start_ _seeing
my lord_

LORD TOUCH Start not let guilty and dishonest souls start at the
revelation of their thoughts but be thou fixed as is thy virtue

MASK I am confounded and beg your Lordships pardon for those free
discourses which I have had with myself

LORD TOUCH Come I beg your pardon that I overheard you and yet it
shall not need Honest Maskwell Thy and my good genius led me hither
Mine in that I have discovered so much manly virtue thine in that thou
shalt have due reward of all thy worth Give me thy hand My nephew is
the alone remaining branch of all our ancient family him I thus blow
away and constitute thee in his room to be my heir

MASK Now heaven forbid

LORD TOUCH No moreI have resolved The writings are ready drawn and
wanted nothing but to be signed and have his name inserted Yours will
fill the blank as well I will have no reply Let me command this time
for tis the last in which I will assume authority Hereafter you shall
rule where I have power

MASK I humbly would petition

LORD TOUCH Ist for yourself MASKWELL _pauses_ Ill hear of
nought for anybody else

MASK Then witness heaven for me this wealth and honour was not of my
seeking nor would I build my fortune on anothers ruin I had but one
desire

LORD TOUCH Thou shalt enjoy it If all Im worth in wealth or interest
can purchase Cynthia she is thine Im sure Sir Pauls consent will
follow fortune Ill quickly show him which way that is going

MASK You oppress me with bounty My gratitude is weak and shrinks
beneath the weight and cannot rise to thank you What enjoy my love
Forgive the transports of a blessing so unexpected so unhoped for so
unthought of

LORD TOUCH I will confirm it and rejoice with thee



SCENE IV


MASKWELL _alone_

MASK This is prosperous indeed Why let him find me out a villain
settled in possession of a fair estate and full fruition of my love
Ill bear the railings of a losing gamester But should he find me out
before Tis dangerous to delay Let me think Should my lord proceed
to treat openly of my marriage with Cynthia all must be discovered and
Mellefont can be no longer blinded It must not be nay should my lady
know itay then were fine work indeed Her fury would spare nothing
though she involved herself in ruin No it must be by stratagem I
must deceive Mellefont once more and get my lord to consent to my
private management He comes opportunely Now will I in my old way
discover the whole and real truth of the matter to him that he may not
suspect one word ont

 No mask like open truth to cover lies
 As to go naked is the best disguise



SCENE V


_To him_ MELLEFONT

MEL O Maskwell what hopes I am confounded in a maze of thoughts
each leading into one another and all ending in perplexity My uncle
will not see nor hear me

MASK No matter sir dont trouble your head alls in my power

MEL How For heavens sake

MASK Little do you think that your aunt has kept her word How the
devil she wrought my lord into this dotage I know not but hes gone to
Sir Paul about my marriage with Cynthia and has appointed me his heir

MEL The devil he has Whats to be done

MASK I have it it must be by stratagem for its in vain to make
application to him I think I have that in my head that cannot fail
Wheres Cynthia

MEL In the garden

MASK Let us go and consult her my life for yours I cheat my lord



SCENE VI


LORD TOUCHWOOD LADY TOUCHWOOD

LADY TOUCH Maskwell your heir and marry Cynthia

LORD TOUCH I cannot do too much for so much merit

LADY TOUCH But this is a thing of too great moment to be so suddenly
resolved Why Cynthia Why must he be married Is there not reward
enough in raising his low fortune but he must mix his blood with mine
and wed my niece How know you that my brother will consent or she
Nay he himself perhaps may have affections otherwhere

LORD TOUCH No I am convinced he loves her

LADY TOUCH Maskwell love Cynthia Impossible

LORD TOUCH I tell you he confessed it to me

LADY TOUCH Confusion Hows this _Aside_

LORD TOUCH His humility long stifled his passion And his love of
Mellefont would have made him still conceal it But by encouragement I
wrung the secret from him and know hes no way to be rewarded but in
her Ill defer my farther proceedings in it till you have considered
it but remember how we are both indebted to him



SCENE VII


LADY TOUCHWOOD _alone_

LADY TOUCH Both indebted to him Yes we are both indebted to him if
you knew all Villain Oh I am wild with this surprise of treachery
it is impossible it cannot be He love Cynthia What have I been bawd
to his designs his property only a baiting place Now I see what made
him false to Mellefont Shame and distraction I cannot bear it oh
what woman can bear to be a property To be kindled to a flame only to
light him to anothers arms oh that I were fire indeed that I might
burn the vile traitor What shall I do How shall I think I cannot
think All my designs are lost my love unsated my revenge unfinished
and fresh cause of fury from unthought of plagues



SCENE VIII

LADY TOUCH Hear me consent to the breaking off this marriage and the
promoting any other without consulting me and Ill renounce all blood

SIR PAUL Why whats the matter now Good Lord whats all this for

SIR PAUL Youre a passionate woman gadsbud But to say truth all our
family are choleric I am the only peaceable person amongst em



SCENE IX


MELLEFONT MASKWELL _and_ CYNTHIA

MEL I know no other way but this he has proposed if you have love
enough to run the venture

CYNT I dont know whether I have love enough but I find I have
obstinacy enough to pursue whatever I have once resolved and a true
female courage to oppose anything that resists my will though twere
reason itself

MASK Thats right Well Ill secure the writings and run the hazard
along with you

CYNT But how can the coach and six horses be got ready without
suspicion

MASK Leave it to my care that shall be so far from being suspected
that it shall be got ready by my lords own order

MEL How

MASK Why I intend to tell my lord the whole matter of our contrivance
thats my way

MEL I dont understand you

MASK Why Ill tell my lord I laid this plot with you on purpose to
betray you and that which put me upon it was the finding it impossible
to gain the lady any other way but in the hopes of her marrying you

MEL So

MASK So why so while youre busied in making yourself ready Ill
wheedle her into the coach and instead of you borrow my lords
chaplain and so run away with her myself

MEL Oh I conceive you youll tell him so

MASK Tell him so ay why you dont think I mean to do so

MEL No no ha ha I dare swear thou wilt not

MASK Therefore for our farther security I would have you disguised
like a parson that if my lord should have curiosity to peep he may not
discover you in the coach but think the cheat is carried on as he would
have it

MEL Excellent Maskwell Thou wert certainly meant for a statesman or a
Jesuit but thou art too honest for one and too pious for the other

MASK Well get yourself ready and meet me in halfanhour yonder in
my ladys dressingroom go by the back stairs and so we may slip down
without being observed Ill send the chaplain to you with his robes I
have made him my own and ordered him to meet us tomorrow morning at St
Albans there we will sum up this account to all our satisfactions

MEL Should I begin to thank or praise thee I should waste the little
time we have



SCENE X


CYNTHIA MASKWELL

MASK Madam you will be ready

CYNT I will be punctual to the minute _Going_

MASK Stay I have a doubt Upon second thoughts we had better meet in
the chaplains chamber here the corner chamber at this end of the
gallery there is a back way into it so that you need not come through
this door and a pair of private stairs leading down to the stables It
will be more convenient

CYNT I am guided by you but Mellefont will mistake

MASK No no Ill after him immediately and tell him

CYNT I will not fail



SCENE XI


MASKWELL _alone_

MASK Why _qui vult decipi decipiatur_Tis no fault of mine I have
told em in plain terms how easy tis for me to cheat em and if they
will not hear the serpents hiss they must be stung into experience and
future caution Now to prepare my lord to consent to this But first I
must instruct my little Levite there is no plot public or private that
can expect to prosper without one of them has a finger int he promised
me to be within at this hourMr Saygrace Mr Saygrace _Goes to the
chamber door and knocks_



SCENE XII


MASKWELL SAYGRACE

SAYGRACE _looking out_ Sweet sir I will but pen the last line of an
acrostic and be with you in the twinkling of an ejaculation in the
pronouncing of an Amen or before you can

MASK Nay good Mr Saygrace do not prolong the time by describing to
me the shortness of your stay rather if you please defer the finishing
of your wit and let us talk about our business it shall be tithes in
your way

SAYGRACE _Enters_ You shall prevail I would break off in the
middle of a sermon to do you a pleasure

MASK You could not do me a greaterexcept the business in hand Have
you provided a habit for Mellefont

SAYGRACE I have they are ready in my chamber together with a clean
starched band and cuffs

MASK Good let them be carried to him have you stitched the gown
sleeve that he may be puzzled and waste time in putting it on

SAYGRACE I have the gown will not be indued without perplexity

MASK Meet me in halfanhour here in your own chamber When Cynthia
comes let there be no light and do not speak that she may not
distinguish you from Mellefont Ill urge haste to excuse your silence

SAYGRACE You have no more commands

MASK None your text is short

SAYGRACE But pithy and I will handle it with discretion

MASK It will be the first you have so served



SCENE XIII


LORD TOUCHWOOD MASKWELL

My very slaves will shortly give me rules how I shall govern them

MASK I am concerned to see your lordship discomposed

LORD TOUCH Have you seen my wife lately or disobliged her

MASK No my lord What can this mean _Aside_

LORD TOUCH Then Mellefont has urged somebody to incense her Something
she has heard of you which carries her beyond the bounds of patience

MASK This I feared _Aside_ Did not your lordship tell her of the
honours you designed me

LORD TOUCH Yes

MASK Tis that you know my lady has a high spirit she thinks I am
unworthy

LORD TOUCH Unworthy Tis an ignorant pride in her to think so
Honesty to me is true nobility However tis my will it shall be so
and that should be convincing to her as much as reason By Heaven Ill
not be wiferidden were it possible it should be done this night

MASK By Heaven he meets my wishes _Aside_ Few things are
impossible to willing minds

LORD TOUCH Instruct me how this may be done you shall see I want no
inclination

MASK I had laid a small design for tomorrow as love will be
inventing which I thought to communicate to your lordship But it may
be as well done tonight

miss thy aim

MASK Ha ha ha

LADY TOUCH Ha Do you mock my rage Then this shall punish your fond
rash contempt Again smile _Goes to strike_ And such a smile as
speaks in ambiguity Ten thousand meanings lurk in each corner of that
various face

Oh that they were written in thy heart

That I with this might lay thee open to my sight

But then twill be too late to know

Thou hast thou hast found the only way to turn my rage Too well thou
knowest my jealous soul could never bear uncertainty Speak then and
tell me Yet are you silent Oh I am wildered in all passions But
thus my anger melts _Weeps_ Here take this poniard for my very
spirits faint and I want strength to hold it thou hast disarmed my
soul _Gives the dagger_

dote on each last favour more than all the rest though I would give a
limb for every look you cheaply throw away on any other object of your
love yet so far I prize your pleasures oer my own that all this
seeming plot that I have laid has been to gratify your taste and cheat
the world to prove a faithful rogue to you

LADY TOUCH If this were true But how can it be

MASK I have so contrived that Mellefont will presently in the
chaplains habit wait for Cynthia in your dressingroom but I have put
the change upon her that she may be other where employed Do you
procure her nightgown and with your hoods tied over your face meet him
in her stead You may go privately by the back stairs and unperceived
there you may propose to reinstate him in his uncles favour if hell
comply with your desireshis case is desperate and I believe hell
yield to any conditions If not here take this you may employ it
better than in the heart of one who is nothing when not yours _Gives
the dagger_

LADY TOUCH Thou canst deceive everybody Nay thou hast deceived me

 Still gnawing that whence first it did arise
 No sooner born but the vile parent dies

_Exeunt Omnes_




EPILOGUE
Spoken by MRS MOUNTFORD


Could poets but foresee how plays would take
Then they could tell what epilogues to make
Whether to thank or blame their audience most
But that late knowledge does much hazard cost
Till dice are thrown theres nothing won nor lost
So till the thief has stolen he cannot know
Whether he shall escape the law or no
But poets run much greater hazards far
Than they who stand their trials at the bar
The law provides a curb for its own fury
And suffers judges to direct the jury
But in this court what difference does appear
For every ones both judge and jury here
Nay and whats worse an executioner
All have a right and title to some part
Each choosing that in which he has most art
The dreadful men of learning all confound
Unless the fables good and moral sound
The vizormasks that are in pit and gallery
Approve or damn the repartee and raillery
The lady critics who are better read
Inquire if characters are nicely bred
If the soft things are penned and spoke with grace
They judge of action too and time and place
In which we do not doubt but theyre discerning
For thats a kind of assignation learning
Beaus judge of dress the witlings judge of songs
The cuckoldom of ancient right to cits belongs
Thus poor poets the favour are denied
Even to make exceptions when theyre tried
Tis hard that they must every one admit
Methinks I see some faces in the pit
Which must of consequence be foes to wit
You who can judge to sentence may proceed
But though he cannot write let him be freed
At least from their contempt who cannot read
