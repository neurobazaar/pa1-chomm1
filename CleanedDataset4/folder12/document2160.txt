THE EXPEDITION OF HUMPHRY CLINKER

by TOBIAS SMOLLETT




To Mr HENRY DAVIS Bookseller in London

ABERGAVENNY Aug 4

RESPECTED SIR

I have received your esteemed favour of the 13th ultimo whereby it
appeareth that you have perused those same Letters the which were
delivered unto you by my friend the reverend Mr Hugo Behn and I am
pleased to find you think they may be printed with a good prospect of
success in as much as the objections you mention I humbly conceive
are such as may be redargued if not entirely removedAnd first in
the first place as touching what prosecutions may arise from printing
the private correspondence of persons still living give me leave with
all due submission to observe that the Letters in question were not
written and sent under the seal of secrecy that they have no tendency
to the mala fama or prejudice of any person whatsoever but rather to
the information and edification of mankind so that it becometh a sort
of duty to promulgate them in usum publicum Besides I have consulted
Mr Davy Higgins an eminent attorney of this place who after due
inspection and consideration declareth That he doth not think the said
Letters contain any matter which will be held actionable in the eye of
the law Finally if you and I should come to a right understanding I
do declare in verbo sacerdotis that in case of any such prosecution
I will take the whole upon my own shoulders even quoad fine and
imprisonment though I must confess I should not care to undergo
flagellation Tam ad turpitudinem quam ad amaritudinem poenoe
spectansSecondly concerning the personal resentment of Mr Justice
Lismahago I may say non flocci facioI would not willingly vilipend
any Christian if peradventure he deserveth that epithet albeit I
am much surprised that more care is not taken to exclude from the
commission all such vagrant foreigners as may be justly suspected of
disaffection to our happy constitution in church and stateGod forbid
that I should be so uncharitable as to affirm positively that the
said Lismahago is no better than a Jesuit in disguise but this I will
assert and maintain totis viribus that from the day he qualified he
has never been once seen intra templi parietes that is to say within
the parish church

Thirdly with respect to what passed at Mr Kendals table when the said
Lismahago was so brutal in his reprehensions I must inform you my good
Sir that I was obliged to retire not by fear arising from his minatory
reproaches which as I said above I value not of a rush but from the
sudden effect produced by a barbels row which I had eaten at
dinner not knowing that the said row is at certain seasons violently
cathartic as Galen observeth in his chapter Peri ichtos

Fourthly and lastly with reference to the manner in which I got
possession of these Letters it is a circumstance that concerns my own
conscience only sufficeth it to say I have fully satisfied the parties
in whose custody they were and by this time I hope I have also
satisfied you in such ways that the last hand may be put to our
agreement and the work proceed with all convenient expedition in which
I hope I rest

Respected Sir Your very humble servant

JONATHAN DUSTWICH

PS I propose Deo volente to have the pleasure of seeing you in the
great city towards Allhallowtide when I shall be glad to treat with
you concerning a parcel of MS sermons of a certain clergyman deceased
a cake of the right leaven for the present taste of the public Verbum
sapienti c

JD




To the Revd Mr JONATHAN DUSTWICH at

SIR

I received yours in course of post and shall be glad to treat with you
for the MS which I have delivered to your friend Mr Behn but can
by no means comply with the terms proposed Those things are so
uncertainWriting is all a lotteryI have been a loser by the works
of the greatest men of the ageI could mention particulars and name
names but dont choose itThe taste of the town is so changeable
Then there have been so many letters upon travels lately publishedWhat
between Smolletts Sharps Derricks Thicknesses Baltimores and
Barettis together with Shandys Sentimental Travels the public seems
to be cloyed with that kind of entertainmentNevertheless I will
if you please run the risque of printing and publishing and you shall
have half the profits of the impressionYou need not take the trouble
to bring up your sermons on my accountNo body reads sermons but
Methodists and DissentersBesides for my own part I am quite a
stranger to that sort of reading and the two persons whose judgment I
depended upon in those matters are out of the way one is gone abroad
carpenter of a man of war and the other has been silly enough to
abscond in order to avoid a prosecution for blasphemyIm a great
loser by his going offHe has left a manual of devotion half finished
on my hands after having received money for the whole copyHe was the
soundest divine and had the most orthodox pen of all my people and I
never knew his judgment fail but in flying from his bread and butter on
this occasion

By owning you was not put in bodily fear by Lismahago you preclude
yourself from the benefit of a good plea over and above the advantage
of binding him over In the late war I inserted in my evening paper
a paragraph that came by the post reflecting upon the behaviour of a
certain regiment in battle An officer of said regiment came to my shop
and in the presence of my wife and journeyman threatened to cut off
my earsAs I exhibited marks of bodily fear more ways than one to the
conviction of the byestanders I bound him over my action lay and I
recovered As for flagellation you have nothing to fear and nothing to
hope on that headThere has been but one printer flogged at the carts
tail these thirty years that was Charles Watson and he assured me it
was no more than a fleabite C S has been threatened several times
by the House of L but it came to nothing If an information should
be moved for and granted against you as the editor of those Letters
I hope you will have honesty and wit enough to appear and take your
trialIf you should be sentenced to the pillory your fortune is
madeAs times go thats a sure step to honour and preferment I shall
think myself happy if I can lend you a lift and am very sincerely

Yours

HENRY DAVIS LONDON Aug 10th

wheel indeed I am equally distressed in mind and bodyAs if I had not
plagues enough of my own those children of my sister are left me for a
perpetual source of vexationwhat business have people to get children
to plague their neighbours A ridiculous incident that happened
yesterday to my niece Liddy has disordered me in such a manner that
I expect to be laid up with another fit of the goutperhaps I may
explain myself in my next I shall set out tomorrow morning for the
Hot Well at Bristol where I am afraid I shall stay longer than I could
wish On the receipt of this send Williams thither with my saddlehorse
and the demi pique Tell Barns to thresh out the two old ricks and send
the corn to market and sell it off to the poor at a shilling a bushel

submissions neither will I pocket any of his money The fellow is a bad
neighbour and I desire to have nothing to do with him but as he is

DEAR MOLLY

Heaving this importunity I send my love to you and Saul being in good
health and hoping to hear the same from you and that you and Saul will
take my poor kitten to bed with you this cold weather We have been all
in a sad taking here at GlostarMiss Liddy had like to have run away
with a playerman and young master and he would adone themselves a
mischief but the squire applied to the mare and they were bound
overMistress bid me not speak a word of the matter to any Christian
soulno more I shall for we servints should see all and say nothing
But what was worse than all this Chowder has had the misfortune to be
worried by a butchers dog and came home in a terrible pickleMistress
was taken with the asterisks but they soon went off The doctor was
sent for to Chowder and he subscribed a repository which did him great
servicethank God hes now in a fair way to do wellpray take care
of my box and the pillyber and put them under your own bed for I do
suppose madam Gwyllim will be a prying into my secrets now my back is

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR PHILLIPS

As I have nothing more at heart than to convince you I am incapable of
forgetting or neglecting the friendship I made at college now begin
that correspondence by letters which you and I agreed at parting to
cultivate I begin it sooner than I intended that you may have it in
your power to refute any idle reports which may be circulated to my
prejudice at Oxford touching a foolish quarrel in which I have been
involved on account of my sister who had been some time settled here
in a boardingschool When I came hither with my uncle and aunt who
are our guardians to fetch her away I found her a fine tall girl of
seventeen with an agreeable person but remarkably simple and quite
ignorant of the world This disposition and want of experience had
exposed her to the addresses of a personI know not what to call
him who had seen her at a play and with a confidence and dexterity
peculiar to himself found means to be recommended to her acquaintance
It was by the greatest accident I intercepted one of his letters as
it was my duty to stifle this correspondence in its birth I made it my
business to find him out and tell him very freely my sentiments of
the matter The spark did not like the stile I used and behaved with
abundance of mettle Though his rank in life which by the bye I am
ashamed to declare did not entitle him to much deference yet as his
behaviour was remarkably spirited I admitted him to the privilege of
a gentleman and something might have happened had not we been
preventedIn short the business took air I know not how and made
abundance of noiserecourse was had to justiceI was obliged to give
my word and honour c and tomorrow morning we set out for Bristol
Wells where I expect to hear from you by the return of the postI
have got into a family of originals whom I may one day attempt to
describe for your amusement My aunt Mrs Tabitha Bramble is a maiden
of fortyfive exceedingly starched vain and ridiculousMy uncle is
an odd kind of humorist always on the fret and so unpleasant in his
manner that rather than be obliged to keep him company Id resign all
claim to the inheritance of his estate Indeed his being tortured by the
gout may have soured his temper and perhaps I may like him better on
further acquaintance certain it is all his servants and neighbours in
the country are fond of him even to a degree of enthusiasm the reason
of which I cannot as yet comprehend Remember me to Griffy Price Gwyn
Mansel Basset and all the rest of my old Cambrian companionsSalute
the bedmaker in my namegive my service to the cook and pray take care
of poor Ponto for the sake of his old master who is and ever will be

To Mrs JERMYN at her house in Gloucester

DEAR MADAM

Having no mother of my own I hope you will give me leave to disburden
my poor heart to you who have always acted the part of a kind parent to
me ever since I was put under your care Indeed and indeed my worthy
governess may believe me when I assure her that I never harboured
a thought that was otherwise than virtuous and if God will give me
grace I shall never behave so as to cast a reflection on the care you
have taken in my education I confess I have given just cause of offence
by my want of prudence and experience I ought not to have listened to
what the young man said and it was my duty to have told you all that
passed but I was ashamed to mention it and then he behaved so modest
and respectful and seemed to be so melancholy and timorous that
I could not find in my heart to do any thing that should make him
miserable and desperate As for familiarities I do declare I never
once allowed him the favour of a salute and as to the few letters that
passed between us they are all in my uncles hands and I hope they
contain nothing contrary to innocence and honourI am still persuaded
that he is not what he appears to be but time will discovermean while
I will endeavour to forget a connexion which is so displeasing to my
family I have cried without ceasing and have not tasted any thing but
tea since I was hurried away from you nor did I once close my eyes for
three nights runningMy aunt continues to chide me severely when we
are by ourselves but I hope to soften her in time by humility
and submissionMy uncle who was so dreadfully passionate in the
beginning has been moved by my tears and distress and is now all
tenderness and compassion and my brother is reconciled to me on my
promise to break off all correspondence with that unfortunate youth
but notwithstanding all their indulgence I shall have no peace of mind
till I know my dear and ever honoured governess has forgiven her poor
disconsolate forlorn

To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS at Gloucester

MY DEAREST LETTY

I am in such a fright lest this should not come safe to hand by the
conveyance of Jarvis the carrier that I beg you will write me on the
receipt of it directing to me under cover to Mrs Winifred Jenkins
my aunts maid who is a good girl and has been so kind to me in my
affliction that I have made her my confidant as for Jarvis he was
very shy of taking charge of my letter and the little parcel because
his sister Sally had like to have lost her place on my account indeed
I cannot blame the man for his caution but I have made it worth his
whileMy dear companion and bedfellow it is a grievous addition to
my other misfortunes that I am deprived of your agreeable company and
conversation at a time when I need so much the comfort of your good
humour and good sense but I hope the friendship we contracted at
boardingschool will last for lifeI doubt not but on my side it will
daily increase and improve as I gain experience and learn to know the
value of a true friend O my dear Letty what shall I say about poor
Mr Wilson I have promised to break off all correspondence and if
possible to forget him but alas I begin to perceive that will not be
in my power As it is by no means proper that the picture should remain
in my hands lest it should be the occasion of more mischief I have
sent it to you by this opportunity begging you will either keep it safe
till better times or return it to Mr Wilson himself who I suppose
will make it his business to see you at the usual place If he should be
lowspirited at my sending back his picture you may tell him I have no
occasion for a picture while the original continues engraved on myBut
no I would not have you tell him that neither because there must be an
end of our correspondenceI wish he may forget me for the sake of
his own peace and yet if he should he must be a barbarousBut it is
impossiblepoor Wilson cannot be false and inconstant I beseech
him not to write to me nor attempt to see me for some time for
considering the resentment and passionate temper of my brother Jery
such an attempt might be attended with consequences which would make
us all miserable for lifelet us trust to time and the chapter of
accidents or rather to that Providence which will not fail sooner or
later to reward those that walk in the paths of honour and virtue I
would offer my love to the young ladies but it is not fit that any of
them should know you have received this letterIf we go to Bath
I shall send you my simple remarks upon that famous center of polite
amusement and every other place we may chance to visit and I flatter
myself that my dear Miss Willis will be punctual in answering the
letters of her affectionate

To Dr LEWIS

DEAR LEWIS

I have followed your directions with some success and might have
been upon my legs by this time had the weather permitted me to use my
saddlehorse I rode out upon the Downs last Tuesday in the forenoon
when the sky as far as the visible horizon was without a cloud but
before I had gone a full mile I was overtaken instantaneously by a
storm of rain that wet me to the skin in three minuteswhence it came
the devil knows but it has laid me up I suppose for one fortnight
It makes me sick to hear people talk of the fine air upon Cliftondowns
How can the air be either agreeable or salutary where the demon of
vapours descends in a perpetual drizzle My confinement is the more
intolerable as I am surrounded with domestic vexations My niece has
had a dangerous fit of illness occasioned by that cursed incident at
Gloucester which I mentioned in my lastShe is a poor goodnatured
simpleton as soft as butter and as easily meltednot that shes a
foolthe girls parts are not despicable and her education has not
been neglected that is to say she can write and spell and speak
French and play upon the harpsichord then she dances finely has a
good figure and is very well inclined but shes deficient in spirit
and so susceptibleand so tender forsoothtruly she has got a
languishing eye and reads romancesThen theres her brother squire
Jery a pert jackanapes full of collegepetulance and selfconceit
proud as a German count and as hot and hasty as a Welch mountaineer As
for that fantastical animal my sister Tabby you are no stranger to her
qualificationsI vow to God she is sometimes so intolerable that I
almost think shes the devil incarnate come to torment me for my
sins and yet I am conscious of no sins that ought to entail such
familyplagues upon mewhy the devil should not I shake off these
torments at once I ant married to Tabby thank Heaven nor did I beget
the other two let them choose another guardian for my part I ant in
a condition to take care of myself much less to superintend the
conduct of giddyheaded boys and girls You earnestly desire to know the
particulars of our adventure at Gloucester which are briefly these and
I hope they will go no furtherLiddy had been so long copped up in a
boardingschool which next to a nunnery is the worst kind of seminary
that ever was contrived for young women that she became as inflammable
as touchwood and going to a play in holidaytimesdeath Im
ashamed to tell you she fell in love with one of the actorsa handsome
young fellow that goes by the name of Wilson The rascal soon perceived
the impression he had made and managed matters so as to see her at
a house where she went to drink tea with her governessThis was the
beginning of a correspondence which they kept up by means of a jade
of a milliner who made and dressed caps for the girls at the
boardingschool When we arrived at Gloucester Liddy came to stay at
lodgings with her aunt and Wilson bribed the maid to deliver a letter
into her own hands but it seems Jery had already acquired so much
credit with the maid by what means he best knows that she carried
the letter to him and so the whole plot was discovered The rash boy
without saying a word of the matter to me went immediately in search
of Wilson and I suppose treated him with insolence enough The
theatrical hero was too far gone in romance to brook such usage he
replied in blank verse and a formal challenge ensued They agreed to
meet early next morning and decide the dispute with sword and pistol I
heard nothing at all of the affair till Mr Morley came to my bedside
in the morning and told me he was afraid my nephew was going to fight
as he had been overheard talking very loud and vehement with Wilson
at the young mans lodgings the night before and afterwards went
and bought powder and ball at a shop in the neighbourhood I got up
immediately and upon inquiry found he was just going out I begged
Morley to knock up the mayor that he might interpose as a magistrate
and in the mean time I hobbled after the squire whom I saw at a
distance walking at a great pace towards the city gatein spite of all
my efforts I could not come up till our two combatants had taken their
ground and were priming their pistols An old house luckily screened
me from their view so that I rushed upon them at once before I was
perceived They were both confounded and attempted to make their escape
different ways but Morley coming up with constables at that instant
took Wilson into custody and Jery followed him quietly to the mayors
house All this time I was ignorant of what had passed the preceding
day and neither of the parties would discover a tittle of the matter
The mayor observed that it was great presumption in Wilson who was a
stroller to proceed to such extremities with a gentleman of family and
fortune and threatened to commit him on the vagrant actThe young
fellow bustled up with great spirit declaring he was a gentleman and
would be treated as such but he refused to explain himself further The
master of the company being sent for and examined touching the said
Wilson said the young man had engaged with him at Birmingham about six
months ago but never would take his salary that he had behaved so well
in his private character as to acquire the respect and goodwill of all
his acquaintance and that the public owned his merit as an actor was
altogether extraordinaryAfter all I fancy he will turn out to be a
runaway prentice from LondonThe manager offered to bail him for any
sum provided he would give his word and honour that he would keep the
peace but the young gentleman was on his high ropes and would by no
means lay himself under any restrictions on the other hand Hopeful was
equally obstinate till at length the mayor declared that if they
both refused to be bound over he would immediately commit Wilson as a
vagrant to hard labour I own I was much pleased with Jerys behaviour
on this occasion he said that rather than Mr Wilson should be treated
in such an ignominious manner he would give his word and honour
to prosecute the affair no further while they remained at
GloucesterWilson thanked him for his generous manner of proceeding
and was discharged On our return to our lodgings my nephew explained
the whole mystery and I own I was exceedingly incensedLiddy being
questioned on the subject and very severely reproached by that wildcat
my sister Tabby first swooned away then dissolving in a flood of
tears confessed all the particulars of the correspondence at the same
time giving up three letters which was all she had received from her
admirer The last which Jery intercepted I send you inclosed and when
you have read it I dare say you wont wonder at the progress the writer
had made in the heart of a simple girl utterly unacquainted with the
characters of mankind Thinking it was high time to remove her from such
a dangerous connexion I carried her off the very next day to Bristol
but the poor creature was so frightened and fluttered by our threats
and expostulations that she fell sick the fourth day after our arrival
at Clifton and continued so ill for a whole week that her life was
despaired of It was not till yesterday that Dr Rigge declared her out
of danger You cannot imagine what I have suffered partly from the
indiscretion of this poor child but much more from the fear of
losing her entirely This air is intolerably cold and the place quite
solitaryI never go down to the Well without returning lowspirited
for there I meet with half a dozen poor emaciated creatures with
ghostly looks in the last stage of a consumption who have made shift
to linger through the winter like so many exotic plants languishing in a
hothouse but in all appearance will drop into their graves before
the sun has warmth enough to mitigate the rigour of this ungenial
springIf you think the Bathwater will be of any service to me I
will go thither so soon as my niece can bear the motion of the coach
Tell Barns I am obliged to him for his advice but dont choose to
follow it If Davis voluntarily offers to give up the farm the other
shall have it but I will not begin at this time of day to distress my
tenants because they are unfortunate and cannot make regular payments
I wonder that Barns should think me capable of such oppressionAs for
Higgins the fellow is a notorious poacher to be sure and an impudent
rascal to set his snares in my own paddock but I suppose he thought
he had some right especially in my absence to partake of what nature
seems to have intended for common useyou may threaten him in my name
as much as you please and if he repeats the offence let me know it
before you have recourse to justiceI know you are a great sportsman
and oblige many of your friends I need not tell you to make use of my
grounds but it may be necessary to hint that I am more afraid of my
fowlingpiece than of my game When you can spare two or three brace of
partridges send them over by the stagecoach and tell Gwyllim that she
forgot to pack up my flannel and wide shoes in the trunkmailI shall
trouble you as usual from time to time till at last I suppose you will
be tired of corresponding with

To Miss LYDIA MELFORD

Miss Willis has pronounced my doomyou are going away dear Miss
Melfordyou are going to be removed I know not whither what shall I
do which way shall I turn for consolation I know not what I sayall
night long have I been tossed in a sea of doubts and fears uncertainty
and distraction without being able to connect my thoughts much less to
form any consistent plan of conductI was even tempted to wish that
I had never seen you or that you had been less amiable or less
compassionate to your poor Wilson and yet it would be detestable
ingratitude in me to form such a wish considering how much I am
indebted to your goodness and the ineffable pleasure I have derived
from your indulgence and approbationGood God I never heard your name
mentioned without emotion the most distant prospect of being admitted
to your company filled my whole soul with a kind of pleasing alarm as
the time approached my heart beat with redoubled force and every
nerve thrilled with a transport of expectation but when I found myself
actually in your presencewhen I heard you speakwhen I saw you
smile when I beheld your charming eyes turned favourably upon me my
breast was filled with such tumults of delight as wholly deprived me of
the power of utterance and wrapt me in a delirium of joyencouraged
by your sweetness of temper and affability I ventured to describe the
feelings of my hearteven then you did not check my presumptionyou
pitied my sufferings and gave me leave to hope you put a
favourableperhaps too favourable a construction on my
appearancecertain it is I am no player in loveI speak the language
of my own heart and have no prompter but nature Yet there is something
in this heart which I have not yet disclosedI flattered myselfBut
I will notI must not proceed Dear Miss Liddy for Heavens sake
contrive if possible some means of letting me speak to you before you
leave Gloucester otherwise I know not what willBut I begin to rave
againI will endeavour to bear this trial with fortitudewhile I am
capable of reflecting upon your tenderness and truth I surely have no
cause to despaira cloud hangs over me and there is a dreadful weight
upon my spirits While you stay in this place I shall continually hover
about your lodgings as the parted soul is said to linger about the
grave where its mortal comfort liesI know if it is in your power
you will task your humanityyour compassionshall I add your
affectionin order to assuage the almost intolerable disquiet that
torments the heart of your afflicted

WILSON GLOUCESTER March 31




To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS of Jesus college Oxon

HOT WELL April 18

DEAR PHILLIPS

I give Mansel credit for his invention in propagating the report that I
had a quarrel with a mountebanks merry Andrew at Gloucester but I have
too much respect for every appendage of wit to quarrel even with the
lowest buffoonery and therefore I hope Mansel and I shall always be
good friends I cannot however approve of his drowning my poor
dog Ponto on purpose to convert Ovids pleonasm into a punning
epitaphdeerant quoque Littora Ponto for that he threw him into the
Isis when it was so high and impetuous with no other view than to kill
the fleas is an excuse that will not hold waterBut I leave poor Ponto
to his fate and hope Providence will take care to accommodate Mansel
with a drier death

As there is nothing that can be called company at the Well I am here
in a state of absolute rustication This however gives me leisure to
observe the singularities in my uncles character which seems to have
interested your curiosity The truth is his disposition and mine
which like oil and vinegar repelled one another at first have now
begun to mix by dint of being beat up together I was once apt to
believe him a complete Cynic and that nothing but the necessity of his
occasions could compel him to get within the pale of societyI am now
of another opinion I think his peevishness arises partly from bodily
pain and partly from a natural excess of mental sensibility for I
suppose the mind as well as the body is in some cases endued with a
morbid excess of sensation

I was tother day much diverted with a conversation that passed in the
Pumproom betwixt him and the famous Dr Ln who is come to ply at the
Well for patients My uncle was complaining of the stink occasioned
by the vast quantity of mud and slime which the river leaves at low ebb
under the windows of the Pumproom He observed that the exhalations
arising from such a nuisance could not but be prejudicial to the weak
lungs of many consumptive patients who came to drink the water The
Doctor overhearing this remark made up to him and assured him he was
mistaken He said people in general were so misled by vulgar prejudices
that philosophy was hardly sufficient to undeceive them Then humming
thrice he assumed a most ridiculous solemnity of aspect and entered
into a learned investigation of the nature of stink He observed
that stink or stench meant no more than a strong impression on
the olfactory nerves and might be applied to substances of the most
opposite qualities that in the Dutch language stinken signifies the
most agreeable perfume as well as the most fetid odour as appears in
Van Vloudels translation of Horace in that beautiful ode Quis multa
gracilis cThe words fiquidis perfusus odoribus he translates van
civet  moschata gestinken that individuals differed toto coelo in
their opinion of smells which indeed was altogether as arbitrary
as the opinion of beauty that the French were pleased with the putrid
effluvia of animal food and so were the Hottentots in Africa and the
Savages in Greenland and that the Negroes on the coast of Senegal would
not touch fish till it was rotten strong presumptions in favour of what
is generally called stink as those nations are in a state of nature
undebauched by luxury unseduced by whim and caprice that he had reason
to believe the stercoraceous flavour condemned by prejudice as a stink
was in fact most agreeable to the organs of smelling for that every
person who pretended to nauseate the smell of anothers excretions
snuffed up his own with particular complacency for the truth of which
he appealed to all the ladies and gentlemen then present he said the
inhabitants of Madrid and Edinburgh found particular satisfaction
in breathing their own atmosphere which was always impregnated with
stercoraceous effluvia that the learned Dr B in his treatise on the
Four Digestions explains in what manner the volatile effluvia from the
intestines stimulate and promote the operations of the animal economy
he affirmed the last Grand Duke of Tuscany of the Medicis family
who refined upon sensuality with the spirit of a philosopher was so
delighted with that odour that he caused the essence of ordure to be
extracted and used it as the most delicious perfume that he himself
the doctor when he happened to be lowspirited or fatigued with
business found immediate relief and uncommon satisfaction from hanging
over the stale contents of a closestool while his servant stirred it
about under his nose nor was this effect to be wondered at when we
consider that this substance abounds with the selfsame volatile salts
that are so greedily smelled to by the most delicate invalids after
they have been extracted and sublimed by the chemistsBy this time the
company began to hold their noses but the doctor without taking
the least notice of this signal proceeded to shew that many fetid
substances were not only agreeable but salutary such as assa foetida
and other medicinal gums resins roots and vegetables over and above
burnt feathers tanpits candlesnuffs c In short he used many
learned arguments to persuade his audience out of their senses and from
stench made a transition to filth which he affirmed was also a mistaken
idea in as much as objects so called were no other than certain
modifications of matter consisting of the same principles that enter
into the composition of all created essences whatever they may be that
in the filthiest production of nature a philosopher considered nothing
but the earth water salt and air of which it was compounded that
for his own part he had no more objections to drinking the dirtiest
ditchwater than he had to a glass of water from the Hot Well provided
he was assured there was nothing poisonous in the concrete Then
addressing himself to my uncle Sir said he you seem to be of a
dropsical habit and probably will soon have a confirmed ascites if
I should be present when you are tapped I will give you a convincing
proof of what I assert by drinking without hesitation the water
that comes out of your abdomenThe ladies made wry faces at this
declaration and my uncle changing colour told him he did not desire
any such proof of his philosophy But I should be glad to know said
he what makes you think I am of a dropsical habit Sir I beg pardon
replied the Doctor I perceive your ancles are swelled and you seem to
have the facies leucophlegmatica Perhaps indeed your disorder may
be oedematous or gouty or it may be the lues venerea If you have any
reason to flatter yourself it is this last sir I will undertake
to cure you with three small pills even if the disease should have
attained its utmost inveteracy Sir it is an arcanum which I have
discovered and prepared with infinite labourSir I have lately cured
a woman in Bristola common prostitute sir who had got all the worst
symptoms of the disorder such as nodi tophi and gummata verruca
cristoe Galli and a serpiginous eruption or rather a pocky itch
all over her body By the time she had taken the second pill sir by
Heaven she was as smooth as my hand and the third made her sound and
as fresh as a new born infant Sir cried my uncle peevishly I have
no reason to flatter myself that my disorder comes within the efficacy
of your nostrum But this patient you talk of may not be so sound at
bottom as you imagine I cant possibly be mistaken rejoined the
philosopher for I have had communication with her three timesI always
ascertain my cures in that manner At this remark all the ladies
retired to another corner of the room and some of them began to
spitAs to my uncle though he was ruffled at first by the doctors
saying he was dropsical he could not help smiling at this ridiculous
confession and I suppose with a view to punish this original told
him there was a wart upon his nose that looked a little suspicious I
dont pretend to be a judge of those matters said he but I understand
that warts are often produced by the distemper and that one upon your
nose seems to have taken possession of the very keystone of the
bridge which I hope is in no danger of falling Ln seemed a little
confounded at this remark and assured him it was nothing but a common
excrescence of the cuticula but that the bones were all sound below
for the truth of this assertion he appealed to the touch desiring he
would feel the part My uncle said it was a matter of such delicacy to
meddle with a gentlemans nose that he declined the officeupon which
the Doctor turning to me intreated me to do him that favour I complied
with his request and handled it so roughly that he sneezed and the
tears ran down his cheeks to the no small entertainment of the company
and particularly of my uncle who burst out alaughing for the first
time since I have been with him and took notice that the part seemed
to be very tender Sir cried the Doctor it is naturally a tender
part but to remove all possibility of doubt I will take off the wart
this very night

So saying he bowed with great solemnity all round and retired to his
own lodgings where he applied a caustic to the wart but it spread in
such a manner as to produce a considerable inflammation attended with
an enormous swelling so that when he next appeared his whole face was
overshadowed by this tremendous nozzle and the rueful eagerness with
which he explained this unlucky accident was ludicrous beyond all
descriptionI was much pleased with meeting the original of a
character which you and I have often laughed at in description and
what surprises me very much I find the features in the picture which
has been drawn for him rather softened than overcharged

As I have something else to say and this letter has run to an
unconscionable length I shall now give you a little respite and
trouble you again by the very first post I wish you would take it in
your head to retaliate these double strokes upon

Yours always J MELFORD

DEAR KNIGHT

I now sit down to execute the threat in the tail of my last The truth
is I am big with the secret and long to be delivered It relates to my
guardian who you know is at present our principal object in view

Tother day I thought I had detected him in such a state of frailty as
would but ill become his years and character There is a decent sort of
woman not disagreeable in her person that comes to the Well with a
poor emaciated child far gone in a consumption I had caught my uncles
eyes several times directed to this person with a very suspicious
expression in them and every time he saw himself observed he hastily
withdrew them with evident marks of confusionI resolved to watch him
more narrowly and saw him speaking to her privately in a corner of the
walk At length going down to the Well one day I met her half way up
the hill to Clifton and could not help suspecting she was going to our
lodgings by appointment as it was about one oclock the hour when my
sister and I are generally at the PumproomThis notion exciting my
curiosity I returned by a backway and got unperceived into my own
chamber which is contiguous to my uncles apartment Sure enough the
woman was introduced but not into his bedchamber he gave her audience
in a parlour so that I was obliged to shift my station to another room
where however there was a small chink in the partition through which
I could perceive what passed My uncle though a little lame rose up
when she came in and setting a chair for her desired she would sit
down then he asked if she would take a dish of chocolate which she
declined with much acknowledgment After a short pause he said in a
croaking tone of voice which confounded me not a little Madam I am
truly concerned for your misfortunes and if this trifle can be of any
service to you I beg you will accept it without ceremony So saying
he put a bit of paper into her hand which she opening with great
trepidation exclaimed in an extacy Twenty pounds Oh sir and
sinking down upon a settee fainted awayFrightened at this fit and
I suppose afraid of calling for assistance lest her situation
should give rise to unfavourable conjectures he ran about the room in
distraction making frightful grimaces and at length had recollection
enough to throw a little water in her face by which application she was
brought to herself but then her feeling took another turn She shed
a flood of tears and cried aloud I know not who you are but
sureworthy sirgenerous sirthe distress of me and my poor dying
childOh if the widows prayersif the orphans tears of gratitude
can ought availgracious ProvidenceBlessingsshower down eternal
blessingsHere she was interrupted by my uncle who muttered in
a voice still more and more discordant For Heavens sake be quiet
madamconsiderthe people of the housesdeath cant youAll this
time she was struggling to throw herself on her knees while he seizing
her by the wrists endeavoured to seat her upon the settee saying
Pritheegood nowhold your tongueAt that instant who should
burst intothe room but our aunt Tabby of all antiquated maidens the
most diabolically capriciousEver prying into other peoples affairs
she had seen the woman enter and followed her to the door where she
stood listening but probably could hear nothing distinctly except my
uncles last exclamation at which she bounded into the parlour in a
violent rage that dyed the tip of her nose of a purple hueFy upon
you Matt cried she what doings are these to disgrace your own
character and disparage your familyThen snatching the bank note
out of the strangers hand she went onHow now twenty
poundshere is temptation with a witnessGoodwoman go about
your businessBrother brother I know not which most to admire your
concupissins or your extravaganceGood God exclaimed the poor
woman shall a worthy gentlemans character suffer for an action
that does honour to humanity By this time uncles indignation was
effectually roused His face grew pale his teeth chattered and his
eyes flashedSister cried he in a voice like thunder I vow to God
your impertinence is exceedingly provoking With these words he took
her by the hand and opening the door of communication thrust her into
the chamber where I stood so affected by the scene that the tears ran
down my cheeks Observing these marks of emotion I dont wonder said
she to see you concerned at the backslidings of so near a relation a
man of his years and infirmities These are fine doings trulyThis
is a rare example set by a guardian for the benefit of his
pupilsMonstrous incongruous sophisticalI thought it was but
an act of justice to set her to rights and therefore explained the
mystery But she would not be undeceived What said she would you
go for to offer for to arguefy me out of my senses Didnt I hear
him whispering to her to hold her tongue Didnt I see her in tears
Didnt I see him struggling to throw her upon the couch 0 filthy
hideous abominable Child child talk not to me of charityWho gives
twenty pounds in charityBut you are a striplingYou know nothing of
the world Besides charity begins at homeTwenty pounds would buy me a
complete suit of flowered silk trimmings and all In short I quitted
the room my contempt for her and my respect for her brother being
increased in the same proportion I have since been informed that the
person whom my uncle so generously relieved is the widow of an ensign
who has nothing to depend upon but the pension of fifteen pounds a year
The people of the Wellhouse give her an excellent character She lodges
in a garret and works very hard at plain work to support her daughter
who is dying of a consumption I must own to my shame I feel a strong
inclination to follow my uncles example in relieving this poor widow
but betwixt friends I am afraid of being detected in a weakness that
might entail the ridicule of the company upon

I understand your hint There are mysteries in physic as well as in
religion which we of the profane have no right to investigateA
man must not presume to use his reason unless he has studied the
categories and can chop logic by mode and figureBetween friends I
think every man of tolerable parts ought at my time of day to be both
physician and lawyer as far as his own constitution and property are
concerned For my own part I have had an hospital these fourteen years
within myself and studied my own case with the most painful attention
consequently may be supposed to know something of the matter although
I have not taken regular courses of physiology et cetera et cetera
In short I have for some time been of opinion no offence dear Doctor
that the sum of all your medical discoveries amounts to this that the
more you study the less you knowI have read all that has been written
on the Hot Wells and what I can collect from the whole is that the
water contains nothing but a little salt and calcarious earth mixed in
such inconsiderable proportion as can have very little if any effect
on the animal economy This being the case I think the man deserves to
be fitted with a cap and bells who for such a paultry advantage as this
spring affords sacrifices his precious time which might be employed
in taking more effectual remedies and exposes himself to the dirt the
stench the chilling blasts and perpetual rains that render this place
to me intolerable If these waters from a small degree of astringency
are of some service in the diabetes diarrhoea and night sweats when
the secretions are too much increased must not they do harm in the same
proportion where the humours are obstructed as in the asthma
scurvy gout and dropsyNow we talk of the dropsy here is a strange
fantastical oddity one of your brethren who harangues every day in
the Pumproom as if he was hired to give lectures on all subjects
whatsoeverI know not what to make of himSometimes he makes
shrewd remarks at other times he talks like the greatest simpleton in
natureHe has read a great deal but without method or judgment and
digested nothing He believes every thing he has read especially if
it has any thing of the marvellous in it and his conversation is a
surprizing hotchpotch of erudition and extravagance He told me tother
day with great confidence that my case was dropsical or as he called
it leucophlegmatic A sure sign that his want of experience is equal
to his presumptionfor you know there is nothing analogous to the
dropsy in my disorderI wish those impertinent fellows with their
ricketty understandings would keep their advice for those that ask it
Dropsy indeed Sure I have not lived to the age of fiftyfive and had
such experience of my own disorder and consulted you and other eminent
physicians so often and so long to be undeceived by such aBut
without all doubt the man is mad and therefore what he says is of
no consequence I had yesterday a visit from Higgins who came hither
under the terror of your threats and brought me in a present a brace of
hares which he owned he took in my ground and I could not persuade
the fellow that he did wrong or that I would ever prosecute him for
poachingI must desire you will wink hard at the practices of this
rascallion otherwise I shall be plagued with his presents which cost
me more than they are worthIf I could wonder at any thing Fitzowen
does I should be surprized at his assurance in desiring you to solicit
my vote for him at the next election for the county for him who
opposed me on the like occasion with the most illiberal competition
You may tell him civilly that I beg to be excused Direct your next for
me at Bath whither I propose to remove tomorrow not only on my own
account but for the sake of my niece Liddy who is like to relapse
The poor creature fell into a fit yesterday while I was cheapening a
pair of spectacles with a Jewpedlar I am afraid there is something
still lurking in that little heart of hers which I hope a change of
objects will remove Let me know what you think of this halfwitted
Doctors impertinent ridiculous and absurd notion of my disorderSo
far from being dropsical I am as lank in the belly as a greyhound
and by measuring my ancle with a packthread I find the swelling
subsides every day From such doctors good Lord deliver usI have not
yet taken any lodgings in Bath because there we can be accommodated at
a minutes warning and I shall choose for myselfI need not say your
directions for drinking and bathing will be agreeable to

take it of its being oedematous not leucophlegmatic




To Miss LETTY WILLIS at Gloucester

HOT WELL April 21

MY DEAR LETTY

I did not intend to trouble you again till we should be settled at
Bath but having the occasion of Jarvis I could not let it slip
especially as I have something extraordinary to communicate O my dear
companion What shall I tell you for several days past there was a
Jewlooking man that plied at the Wells with a box of spectacles and
he always eyed me so earnestly that I began to be very uneasy At last
he came to our lodgings at Clifton and lingered about the door as
if he wanted to speak to somebodyI was seized with an odd kind of
fluttering and begged Win to throw herself in his way but the poor
girl has weak nerves and was afraid of his beard My uncle having
occasion for new glasses called him up stairs and was trying a pair
of spectacles when the man advancing to me said in a whisperO
gracious what dye think he saidI am Wilson His features struck
me that very moment it was Wilson sure enough but so disguised that
it would have been impossible to know him if my heart had not assisted
in the discovery I was so surprised and so frightened that I fainted
away but soon recovered and found myself supported by him on the
chair while my uncle was running about the room with the spectacles
on his nose calling for help I had no opportunity to speak to him but
looks were sufficiently expressive He was payed for his glasses and
went away Then I told Win who he was and sent her after him to the
Pumproom where she spoke to him and begged him in my name to withdraw
from the place that he might not incur the suspicion of my uncle or my
brother if he did not want to see me die of terror and vexation The
poor youth declared with tears in his eyes that he had something
extraordinary to communicate and asked if she would deliver a letter
to me but this she absolutely refused by my orderFinding her
obstinate in her refusal he desired she would tell me that he was no
longer a player but a gentleman in which character he would very soon
avow his passion for me without fear of censure or reproachNay
he even discovered his name and family which to my great grief
the simple girl forgot in the confusion occasioned by her being seen
talking to him by my brother who stopt her on the road and asked
what business she had with that rascally Jew She pretended she was
cheapening a stayhook but was thrown into such a quandary that she
forgot the most material part of the information and when she came
home went into an hysteric fit of laughing This transaction happened
three days ago during which he has not appeared so that I suppose he
has gone Dear Letty you see how Fortune takes pleasure in persecuting
your poor friend If you should see him at Gloucesteror if you have
seen him and know his real name and family pray keep me no longer in
suspenceAnd yet if he is under no obligation to keep himself longer
concealed and has a real affection for me I should hope he will in a
little time declare himself to my relations Sure if there is
nothing unsuitable in the match they wont be so cruel as to thwart my
inclinationsO what happiness would then be my portion I cant help
indulging the thought and pleasing my fancy with such agreeable ideas
which after all perhaps will never be realizedBut why should I
despair who knows what will happenWe set out for Bath tomorrow and
I am almost sorry for it as I begin to be in love with solitude and
this is a charming romantic place The air is so pure the Downs are so
agreeable the furz in full blossom the ground enamelled with daisies
and primroses and cowslips all the trees bursting into leaves and the
hedges already clothed with their vernal livery the mountains covered
with flocks of sheep and tender bleating wanton lambkins playing
frisking and skipping from side to side the groves resound with
the notes of blackbird thrush and linnet and all night long sweet
Philomel pours forth her ravishingly delightful song Then for
variety we go down to the nymph of Bristol spring where the company is
assembled before dinner so good natured so free so easy and there we
drink the water so clear so pure so mild so charmingly maukish There
the fun is so chearful and reviving the weather so soft the walk so
agreeable the prospect so amusing and the ships and boats going up and
down the river close under the windows of the Pumproom afford such an
enchanting variety of Moving Pictures as require a much abler pen than
mine to describe To make this place a perfect paradise to me nothing
is wanting but an agreeable companion and sincere friend such as
my dear miss Willis hath been and I hope still will be to her ever
faithful

convey it safe Adieu




To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS of Jesus college Oxon

BATH April 24

DEAR PHILLIPS

You have indeed reason to be surprised that I should have concealed
my correspondence with miss Blackerby from you to whom I disclosed all
my other connexions of that nature but the truth is I never dreamed
of any such commerce till your last informed me that it had produced
something which could not be much longer concealed It is a lucky
circumstance however that her reputation will not suffer any
detriment but rather derive advantage from the discovery which
will prove at least that it is not quite so rotten as most people
imaginedFor my own part I declare to you in all the sincerity of
friendship that far from having any amorous intercourse with the
object in question I never had the least acquaintance with her person
but if she is really in the condition you describe I suspect Mansel to
be at the bottom of the whole His visits to that shrine were no secret
and this attachment added to some good offices which you know he has
done me since I left Almamater give me a right to believe him capable
of saddling me with this scandal when my back was turnedNevertheless
if my name can be of any service to him he is welcome to make use of
it and if the woman should be abandoned enough to swear his banding to
me I must beg the favour of you to compound with the parish I shall
pay the penalty without repining and you will be so good as to draw
upon me immediately for the sum requiredOn this occasion I act by the
advice of my uncle who says I shall have goodluck if I pass through
life without being obliged to make many more compositions of the same
kind The old gentleman told me last night with great goodhumour that
betwixt the age of twenty and forty he had been obliged to provide for
nine bastards sworn to him by women whom he never sawMr Brambles
character which seems to interest you greatly opens and improves upon
me every day His singularities afford a rich mine of entertainment
his understanding so far as I can judge is well cultivated his
observations on life are equally just pertinent and uncommon He
affects misanthropy in order to conceal the sensibility of a heart
which is tender even to a degree of weakness This delicacy of feeling
or soreness of the mind makes him timorous and fearful but then he
is afraid of nothing so much as of dishonour and although he is
exceedingly cautious of giving offence he will fire at the least hint
of insolence or illbreedingRespectable as he is upon the whole
I cant help being sometimes diverted by his little distresses which
provoke him to let fly the shafts of his satire keen and penetrating
as the arrows of TeucerOur aunt Tabitha acts upon him as a perpetual
grindstoneShe is in all respects a striking contrast to her
brotherBut I reserve her portrait for another occasion

Three days ago we came hither from the Hot Well and took possession
of the first floor of a lodginghouse on the South Parade a situation
which my uncle chose for its being near the Bath and remote from the
noise of carriages He was scarce warm in the lodgings when he called
for his nightcap his wide shoes and flannel and declared himself
invested with the gout in his right foot though I believe it had as
yet reached no farther than his imagination It was not long before he
had reason to repent his premature declaration for our aunt Tabitha
found means to make such a clamour and confusion before the flannels
could be produced from the trunk that one would have imagined the house
was on fire All this time uncle sat boiling with impatience biting
his fingers throwing up his eyes and muttering ejaculations at length
he burst into a kind of convulsive laugh after which he hummed a song
and when the hurricane was over exclaimed Blessed be God for all
things This however was but the beginning of his troubles Mrs
Tabithas favourite dog Chowder having paid his compliments to a female
turnspit of his own species in the kitchen involved himself in a
quarrel with no fewer than five rivals who set upon him at once and
drove him up stairs to the dining room door with hideous noise there
our aunt and her woman taking arms in his defence joined the
concert which became truly diabolical This fray being with difficulty
suppressed by the intervention of our own footman and the cookmaid
of the house the squire had just opened his mouth to expostulate with
Tabby when the townwaits in the passage below struck up their music
if music it may be called with such a sudden burst of sound as made
him start and stare with marks of indignation and disquiet He had
recollection enough to send his servant with some money to silence those
noisy intruders and they were immediately dismissed though not without
some opposition on the part of Tabitha who thought it but reasonable
that he should have more music for his money Scarce had he settled this
knotty point when a strange kind of thumping and bouncing was heard
right overhead in the second story so loud and violent as to shake
the whole building I own I was exceedingly provoked at this new alarm
and before my uncle had time to express himself on the subject I ran
up stairs to see what was the matter Finding the roomdoor open I
entered without ceremony and perceived an object which I can not now
recollect without laughing to excessIt was a dancing master with his
scholar in the act of teaching The master was blind of one eye and
lame of one foot and led about the room his pupil who seemed to be
about the age of threescore stooped mortally was tall rawboned
hardfavoured with a woollen nightcap on his head and he had stript
off his coat that he might be more nimble in his motionsFinding
himself intruded upon by a person he did not know he forthwith girded
himself with a long iron sword and advancing to me with a peremptory
air pronounced in a true Hibernian accent Mister What dye callum
by my saoul and conscience I am very glad to sea you if you are after
coming in the way of friendship and indeed and indeed now I believe
you are my friend sure enough gra though I never had the honour to sea
your face before my dear for becaase you come like a friend without
any ceremony at all at allI told him the nature of my visit would
not admit of ceremony that I was come to desire he would make less
noise as there was a sick gentleman below whom he had no right
to disturb with such preposterous doings Why lookye now young
gentleman replied this original perhaps upon another occasion I
might shivilly request you to explain the maining of that hard word
prepasterous but theres a time for all things honeySo saying
he passed me with great agility and running down stairs found our
footman at the diningroom door of whom he demanded admittance to
pay his respects to the stranger As the fellow did not think proper
to refuse the request of such a formidable figure he was immediately
introduced and addressed himself to my uncle in these words Your
humble servant good sirIm not so prepasterous as your son calls
it but I know the rules of shivilityIm a poor knight of Ireland
my name is sir Ulic Mackilligut of the county of Galway being your
fellowlodger Im come to pay my respects and to welcome you to the
South Parade and to offer my best services to you and your good lady
and your pretty daughter and even to the young gentleman your son
though he thinks me a prepasterous fellowYou must know I am to have
the honour to open a ball next door tomorrow with lady Mac Manus and
being rusted in my dancing I was refreshing my memory with a little
exercise but if I had known there was a sick person below by Christ
I would have sooner danced a hornpipe upon my own head than walk the
softest minuet over yoursMy uncle who was not a little startled at
his first appearance received his compliment with great complacency
insisted upon his being seated thanked him for the honour of his visit
and reprimanded me for my abrupt expostulation with a gentleman of his
rank and character Thus tutored I asked pardon of the knight who
forthwith starting up embraced me so close that I could hardly
breathe and assured me he loved me as his own soul At length
recollecting his nightcap he pulled it off in some confusion and
with his baldpate uncovered made a thousand apologies to the ladies
as he retiredAt that instant the Abbey bells began to ring so
loud that we could not hear one another speak and this peal as
we afterwards learned was for the honour of Mr Bullock an eminent
cowkeeper of Tottenham who had just arrived at Bath to drink the
waters for indigestion Mr Bramble had not time to make his remarks upon
the agreeable nature of this serenade before his ears were saluted with
another concert that interested him more nearly Two negroes belonging
to a Creole gentleman who lodged in the same house taking their
station at a window in the staircase about ten feet from our
diningroom door began to practise upon the Frenchhorn and being in
the very first rudiments of execution produced such discordant sounds
as might have discomposed the organs of an ass You may guess what
effect they had upon the irritable nerves of uncle who with the most
admirable expression of splenetic surprize in his countenance sent
his man to silence these dreadful blasts and desire the musicians to
practise in some other place as they had no right to stand there and
disturb all the lodgers in the house Those sable performers far from
taking the hint and withdrawing treated the messenger with great
insolence bidding him carry his compliments to their master colonel
Rigworm who would give him a proper answer and a good drubbing into
the bargain in the mean time they continued their noise and even
endeavoured to make it more disagreeable laughing between whiles at
the thoughts of being able to torment their betters with impunity Our
squire incensed at the additional insult immediately dispatched the
servant with his compliments to colonel Rigworm requesting that
he would order his blacks to be quiet as the noise they made was
altogether intolerableTo this message the Creole colonel replied
that his horns had a right to sound on a common staircase that there
they should play for his diversion and that those who did not like the
noise might look for lodgings elsewhere Mr Bramble no sooner received
this reply than his eyes began to glisten his face grew pale and his
teeth chattered After a moments pause he slipt on his shoes without
speaking a word or seeming to feel any further disturbance from the
gout in his toes Then snatching his cane he opened the door and
proceeded to the place where the black trumpeters were posted There
without further hesitation he began to belabour them both and exerted
himself with such astonishing vigour and agility that both their heads
and horns were broken in a twinkling and they ran howling down stairs
to their masters parlourdoor The squire following them half way
called aloud that the colonel might hear him Go rascals and tell
your master what I have done if he thinks himself injured he knows
where to come for satisfaction As for you this is but an earnest of
what you shall receive if ever you presume to blow a horn again here
while I stay in the house So saying he retired to his apartment in
expectation of hearing from the West Indian but the colonel prudently
declined any farther prosecution of the dispute My sister Liddy was
frighted into a fit from which she was no sooner recovered than Mrs
Tabitha began a lecture upon patience which her brother interrupted
with a most significant grin True sister God increase my patience
and your discretion I wonder added he what sort of sonata we are to
expect from this overture in which the devil that presides over horrid
sounds hath given us such variations of discordThe trampling of
porters the creaking and crashing of trunks the snarling of curs the
scolding of women the squeaking and squalling of fiddles and hautboys
out of tune the bouncing of the Irish baronet overhead and the
bursting belching and brattling of the Frenchhorns in the passage
not to mention the harmonious peal that still thunders from the Abbey
steeple succeeding one another without interruption like the different
parts of the same concert have given me such an idea of what a poor
invalid has to expect in this temple dedicated to Silence and Repose
that I shall certainly shift my quarters tomorrow and endeavour to
effectuate my retreat before Sir Ulic opens the ball with my lady Mac
Manus a conjunction that bodes me no good This intimation was by no
means agreeable to Mrs Tabitha whose ears were not quite so delicate as
those of her brotherShe said it would be great folly to move from
such agreeable lodgings the moment they were comfortably settled She
wondered he should be such an enemy to music and mirth She heard no
noise but of his own making it was impossible to manage a family in
dumbshew He might harp as long as he pleased upon her scolding but
she never scolded except for his advantage but he would never be
satisfied even thof she should sweat blood and water in his serviceI
have a great notion that our aunt who is now declining into the most
desperate state of celibacy had formed some design upon the heart of
Sir Ulic Mackilligut which she feared might be frustrated by our abrupt
departure from these lodgings Her brother eyeing her askance Pardon
me sister said he I should be a savage indeed were I insensible of
my own felicity in having such a mild complaisant goodhumoured and
considerate companion and housekeeper but as I have got a weak head
and my sense of hearing is painfully acute before I have recourse to
plugs of wool and cotton Ill try whether I cant find another lodging
where I shall have more quiet and less music He accordingly dispatched
his man upon this service and next day he found a small house in
Milshamstreet which he hires by the week Here at least we enjoy
convenience and quiet within doors as much as Tabbys temper will
allow but the squire still complains of flying pains in the stomach
and head for which he bathes and drinks the waters He is not so bad
however but that he goes in person to the pump the rooms and the
coffeehouses where he picks up continual food for ridicule and satire
If I can glean any thing for your amusement either from his observation
or my own you shall have it freely though I am afraid it will poorly
compensate the trouble of reading these tedious insipid letters of

To Dr LEWIS BATH April 23 DEAR DOCTOR

If I did not know that the exercise of your profession has habituated
you to the hearing of complaints I should make a conscience of
troubling you with my correspondence which may be truly called the
lamentations of Matthew Bramble Yet I cannot help thinking I have
some right to discharge the overflowings of my spleen upon you whose
province it is to remove those disorders that occasioned it and let
me tell you it is no small alleviation of my grievances that I have a
sensible friend to whom I can communicate my crusty humours which by
retention would grow intolerably acrimonious

You must know I find nothing but disappointment at Bath which is
so altered that I can scarce believe it is the same place that I
frequented about thirty years ago Methinks I hear you say Altered it
is without all doubt but then it is altered for the better a truth
which perhaps you would own without hesitation if you yourself was
not altered for the worse The reflection may for aught I know be
just The inconveniences which I overlooked in the highday of health
will naturally strike with exaggerated impression on the irritable
nerves of an invalid surprised by premature old age and shattered with
longsufferingBut I believe you will not deny that this place
which Nature and Providence seem to have intended as a resource
from distemper and disquiet is become the very centre of racket and
dissipation Instead of that peace tranquillity and case so necessary
to those who labour under bad health weak nerves and irregular
spirits here we have nothing but noise tumult and hurry with the
fatigue and slavery of maintaining a ceremonial more stiff formal and
oppressive than the etiquette of a German elector A national hospital
it may be but one would imagine that none but lunatics are admitted
and truly I will give you leave to call me so if I stay much longer at
BathBut I shall take another opportunity to explain my sentiments
at greater length on this subjectI was impatient to see the boasted
improvements in architecture for which the upper parts of the town have
been so much celebrated and tother day I made a circuit of all the new
buildings The Square though irregular is on the whole pretty well
laid out spacious open and airy and in my opinion by far the most
wholesome and agreeable situation in Bath especially the upper side of
it but the avenues to it are mean dirty dangerous and indirect Its
communication with the Baths is through the yard of an inn where the
poor trembling valetudinarian is carried in a chair betwixt the heels
of a double row of horses wincing under the currycombs of grooms and
postilions over and above the hazard of being obstructed or overturned
by the carriages which are continually making their exit or their
entranceI suppose after some chairmen shall have been maimed and
a few lives lost by those accidents the corporation will think in
earnest about providing a more safe and commodious passage The Circus
is a pretty bauble contrived for shew and looks like Vespasians
amphitheatre turned outside in If we consider it in point of
magnificence the great number of small doors belonging to the separate
houses the inconsiderable height of the different orders the affected
ornaments of the architrave which are both childish and misplaced
and the areas projecting into the street surrounded with iron rails
destroy a good part of its effect upon the eye and perhaps we shall
find it still more defective if we view it in the light of convenience
The figure of each separate dwellinghouse being the segment of a
circle must spoil the symmetry of the rooms by contracting them
towards the street windows and leaving a larger sweep in the space
behind If instead of the areas and iron rails which seem to be of
very little use there had been a corridore with arcades all round
as in Coventgarden the appearance of the whole would have been more
magnificent and striking those arcades would have afforded an agreeable
covered walk and sheltered the poor chairmen and their carriages from
the rain which is here almost perpetual At present the chairs stand
soaking in the open street from morning to night till they become so
many boxes of wet leather for the benefit of the gouty and rheumatic
who are transported in them from place to place Indeed this is a
shocking inconvenience that extends over the whole city and I am
persuaded it produces infinite mischief to the delicate and infirm
even the close chairs contrived for the sick by standing in the open
air have their frize linings impregnated like so many spunges with the
moisture of the atmosphere and those cases of cold vapour must give
a charming check to the perspiration of a patient piping hot from the
Bath with all his pores wide open

But to return to the Circus it is inconvenient from its situation at
so great a distance from all the markets baths and places of public
entertainment The only entrance to it through Gaystreet is so
difficult steep and slippery that in wet weather it must be
exceedingly dangerous both for those that ride in carriages and those
that walk afoot and when the street is covered with snow as it was
for fifteen days successively this very winter I dont see how any
individual could go either up or down without the most imminent hazard
of broken bones In blowing weather I am told most of the houses in
this hill are smothered with smoke forced down the chimneys by the
gusts of wind reverberated from the hill behind which I apprehend
likewise must render the atmosphere here more humid and unwholesome
than it is in the square below for the clouds formed by the constant
evaporation from the baths and rivers in the bottom will in their
ascent this way be first attracted and detained by the hill that rises
close behind the Circus and load the air with a perpetual succession of
vapours this point however may be easily ascertained by means of an
hygrometer or a paper of salt of tartar exposed to the action of
the atmosphere The same artist who planned the Circus has likewise
projected a Crescent when that is finished we shall probably have a
Star and those who are living thirty years hence may perhaps see
all the signs of the Zodiac exhibited in architecture at Bath These
however fantastical are still designs that denote some ingenuity and
knowledge in the architect but the rage of building has laid hold on
such a number of adventurers that one sees new houses starting up in
every outlet and every corner of Bath contrived without judgment
executed without solidity and stuck together with so little regard
to plan and propriety that the different lines of the new rows and
buildings interfere with and intersect one another in every different
angle of conjunction They look like the wreck of streets and squares
disjointed by an earthquake which hath broken the ground into a variety
of holes and hillocks or as if some Gothic devil had stuffed them
altogether in a bag and left them to stand higgledy piggledy just as
chance directed What sort of a monster Bath will become in a few years
with those growing excrescences may be easily conceived but the want
of beauty and proportion is not the worst effect of these new mansions
they are built so slight with the soft crumbling stone found in this
neighbourhood that I shall never sleep quietly in one of them when
it blowed as the sailors say a capfull of wind and I am persuaded
that my hind Roger Williams or any man of equal strength would be
able to push his foot through the strongest part of their walls without
any great exertion of his muscles All these absurdities arise from the
general tide of luxury which hath overspread the nation and swept
away all even the very dregs of the people Every upstart of fortune
harnessed in the trappings of the mode presents himself at Bath as in
the very focus of observationClerks and factors from the East Indies
loaded with the spoil of plundered provinces planters negrodrivers
and hucksters from our American plantations enriched they know not
how agents commissaries and contractors who have fattened in two
successive wars on the blood of the nation usurers brokers and
jobbers of every kind men of low birth and no breeding have found
themselves suddenly translated into a state of affluence unknown to
former ages and no wonder that their brains should be intoxicated with
pride vanity and presumption Knowing no other criterion of greatness
but the ostentation of wealth they discharge their affluence without
taste or conduct through every channel of the most absurd extravagance
and all of them hurry to Bath because here without any further
qualification they can mingle with the princes and nobles of the land
Even the wives and daughters of low tradesmen who like shovelnosed
sharks prey upon the blubber of those uncouth whales of fortune are
infected with the same rage of displaying their importance and the
slightest indisposition serves them for a pretext to insist upon being
conveyed to Bath where they may hobble countrydances and cotillons
among lordlings squires counsellors and clergy These delicate
creatures from Bedfordbury Butcherrow Crutchedfriers and
Botolphlane cannot breathe in the gross air of the Lower Town or
conform to the vulgar rules of a common lodginghouse the husband
therefore must provide an entire house or elegant apartments in the
new buildings Such is the composition of what is called the fashionable
company at Bath where a very inconsiderable proportion of genteel
people are lost in a mob of impudent plebeians who have neither
understanding nor judgment nor the least idea of propriety and decorum
and seem to enjoy nothing so much as an opportunity of insulting their
betters

Thus the number of people and the number of houses continue to
increase and this will ever be the case till the streams that swell
this irresistible torrent of folly and extravagance shall either be
exhausted or turned into other channels by incidents and events which
I do not pretend to foresee This I own is a subject on which I cannot
write with any degree of patience for the mob is a monster I never
could abide either in its head tail midriff or members I detest the
whole of it as a mass of ignorance presumption malice and brutality
and in this term of reprobation I include without respect of rank
station or quality all those of both sexes who affect its manners
and court its society

But I have written till my fingers are crampt and my nausea begins to
returnBy your advice I sent to London a few days ago for half a pound
of Gengzeng though I doubt much whether that which comes from America
is equally efficacious with what is brought from the East Indies Some
years ago a friend of mine paid sixteen guineas for two ounces of
it and in six months after it was sold in the same shop for five
shillings the pound In short we live in a vile world of fraud and
sophistication so that I know nothing of equal value with the genuine
friendship of a sensible man a rare jewel which I cannot help thinking
myself in possession of while I repeat the old declaration that I am
as usual

Dear Lewis Your affectionate M BRAMBLE

After having been agitated in a short hurricane on my first arrival
I have taken a small house in Milshamstreet where I am tolerably well
lodged for five guineas a week I was yesterday at the Pumproom and
drank about a pint of water which seems to agree with my stomach and
tomorrow morning I shall bathe for the first time so that in a few
posts you may expect farther trouble mean while I am glad to find that
the inoculation has succeeded so well with poor Joyce and that her face
will be but little marked If my friend Sir Thomas was a single man
I would not trust such a handsome wench in his family but as I have
recommended her in a particular manner to the protection of lady G
who is one of the best women in the world she may go thither without
hesitation as soon as she is quite recovered and fit for serviceLet
her mother have money to provide her with necessaries and she may ride
behind her brother on Bucks but you must lay strong injunctions
on Jack to take particular care of the trusty old veteran who has
faithfully earned his present ease by his past services




To Miss WILLIS at Gloucester BATH April 26 MY DEAREST COMPANION

The pleasure I received from yours which came to hand yesterday is
not to be expressed Love and friendship are without doubt charming
passions which absence serves only to heighten and improve Your kind
present of the garnet bracelets I shall keep as carefully as I preserve
my own life and I beg you will accept in return my hearthousewife
with the tortoiseshell memorandumbook as a trifling pledge of my
unalterable affection

Bath is to me a new worldAll is gayety goodhumour and diversion
The eye is continually entertained with the splendour of dress and
equipage and the ear with the sound of coaches chairs and other
carriages The merry bells ring round from morn till night Then we
are welcomed by the citywaits in our own lodgings we have music in the
Pumproom every morning cotillons every forenoon in the rooms balls
twice a week and concerts every other night besides private assemblies
and parties without numberAs soon as we were settled in lodgings we
were visited by the Master of the Ceremonies a pretty little gentleman
so sweet so fine so civil and polite that in our country he might
pass for the prince of Wales then he talks so charmingly both in verse
and prose that you would be delighted to hear him discourse for you
must know he is a great writer and has got five tragedies ready for the
stage He did us the favour to dine with us by my uncles invitation
and next day squired my aunt and me to every part of Bath which to be
sure is an earthly paradise The Square the Circus and the Parades
put you in mind of the sumptuous palaces represented in prints and
pictures and the new buildings such as Princesrow Harlequinsrow
Bladudsrow and twenty other rows look like so many enchanted
castles raised on hanging terraces

At eight in the morning we go in dishabille to the Pumproom which is
crowded like a Welsh fair and there you see the highest quality
and the lowest trades folks jostling each other without ceremony
hailfellow wellmet The noise of the music playing in the gallery
the heat and flavour of such a crowd and the hum and buz of their
conversation gave me the headach and vertigo the first day but
afterwards all these things became familiar and even agreeableRight
under the Pumproom windows is the Kings Bath a huge cistern where
you see the patients up to their necks in hot water The ladies wear
jackets and petticoats of brown linen with chip hats in which they
fix their handkerchiefs to wipe the sweat from their faces but truly
whether it is owing to the steam that surrounds them or the heat of the
water or the nature of the dress or to all these causes together they
look so flushed and so frightful that I always turn my eyes another
wayMy aunt who says every person of fashion should make her
appearance in the bath as well as in the abbey church contrived a cap
with cherrycoloured ribbons to suit her complexion and obliged Win to
attend her yesterday morning in the water But really her eyes were so
red that they made mine water as I viewed her from the Pumproom and
as for poor Win who wore a hat trimmed with blue what betwixt her wan
complexion and her fear she looked like the ghost of some pale maiden
who had drowned herself for love When she came out of the bath she
took assafoetida drops and was fluttered all day so that we could
hardly keep her from going into hysterics but her mistress says it will
do her good and poor Win curtsies with the tears in her eyes For
my part I content myself with drinking about half a pint of the water
every morning

The pumper with his wife and servant attend within a bar and the
glasses of different sizes stand ranged in order before them so you
have nothing to do but to point at that which you choose and it is
filled immediately hot and sparkling from the pump It is the only
hot water I could ever drink without being sickFar from having that
effect it is rather agreeable to the taste grateful to the stomach
and reviving to the spirits You cannot imagine what wonderful cures it
performsMy uncle began with it the other day but he made wry faces in
drinking and Im afraid he will leave it offThe first day we came to
Bath he fell into a violent passion beat two blackamoors and I was
afraid he would have fought with their master but the stranger proved
a peaceable man To be sure the gout had got into his head as my aunt
observed but I believe his passion drove it away for he has been
remarkably well ever since It is a thousand pities he should ever be
troubled with that ugly distemper for when he is free from pain he is
the best tempered man upon earth so gentle so generous so charitable
that every body loves him and so good to me in particular that I
shall never be able to shew the deep sense I have of his tenderness and
affection

Hard by the Pumproom is a coffeehouse for the ladies but my aunt
says young girls are not admitted insomuch as the conversation
turns upon politics scandal philosophy and other subjects above
our capacity but we are allowed to accompany them to the booksellers
shops which are charming places of resort where we read novels plays
pamphlets and newspapers for so small a subscription as a crown a
quarter and in these offices of intelligence as my brother calls them
all the reports of the day and all the private transactions of the
Bath are first entered and discussed From the booksellers shop we
make a tour through the milliners and toymen and commonly stop at Mr
Gills the pastrycook to take a jelly a tart or a small bason of
vermicelli There is moreover another place of entertainment on the
other side of the water opposite to the Grove to which the company
cross over in a boatIt is called Springgarden a sweet retreat
laid out in walks and ponds and parterres of flowers and there is
a longroom for breakfasting and dancing As the situation is low and
damp and the season has been remarkably wet my uncle wont suffer me
to go thither lest I should catch cold but my aunt says it is all a
vulgar prejudice and to be sure a great many gentlemen and ladies of
Ireland frequent the place without seeming to be the worse for it They
say dancing at Springgardens when the air is moist is recommended to
them as an excellent cure for the rheumatism I have been twice at
the play where notwithstanding the excellence of the performers the
gayety of the company and the decorations of the theatre which are
very fine I could not help reflecting with a sigh upon our poor
homely representations at GloucesterBut this in confidence to my dear
WillisYou know my heart and will excuse its weakness

After all the great scenes of entertainment at Bath are the two
public rooms where the company meet alternately every evening They are
spacious lofty and when lighted up appear very striking They are
generally crowded with welldressed people who drink tea in separate
parties play at cards walk or sit and chat together just as they are
disposed Twice aweek there is a ball the expence of which is defrayed
by a voluntary subscription among the gentlemen and every subscriber
has three tickets I was there Friday last with my aunt under the care
of my brother who is a subscriber and Sir Ulic Mackilligut recommended
his nephew captain O Donaghan to me as a partner but Jery excused
himself by saying I had got the headach and indeed it was really
so though I cant imagine how he knew it The place was so hot and the
smell so different from what we are used to in the country that I was
quite feverish when we came away Aunt says it is the effect of a vulgar
constitution reared among woods and mountains and that as I become
accustomed to genteel company it will wear offSir Ulic was very
complaisant made her a great many highflown compliments and when
we retired handed her with great ceremony to her chair The captain I
believe would have done me the same favour but my brother seeing him
advance took me under his arm and wished him good night The Captain
is a pretty man to be sure tall and strait and well made with
lightgrey eyes and a Roman nose but there is a certain boldness in
his look and manner that puts one out of countenanceBut I am afraid
I have put you out of all patience with this long unconnected scrawl
which I shall therefore conclude with assuring you that neither Bath
nor London nor all the diversions of life shall ever be able to efface
the idea of my dear Letty from the heart of her ever affectionate

the Squires and the Circlis the Crashit the Hottogon and Bloody

mortally afraid and flustered all day and afterwards made believe that
I had got the heddick but mistress said if I didnt go I should take
a dose of bumtaffy and so remembering how it worked Mrs Gwyllim a
pennorth I chose rather to go again with her into the Bath and then I
met with an axident I dropt my petticoat and could not get it up from
the bottomBut what did that signify they mought laff but they could
see nothing for I was up to the sin in water To be sure it threw me
into such a gumbustion that I know not what I said nor what I did nor
how they got me out and rapt me in a blanketMrs Tabitha scoulded a
little when we got home but she knows as I know whats what Ah Laud

To Mrs GWYLLIM housekeeper at Brambletonhall

I am astonished that Dr Lewis should take upon him to give away
Alderney without my privity and concurrantsWhat signifies my
brothers order My brother is little better than Noncompush He would
give away the shirt off his back and the teeth out of his head nay as
for that matter he would have ruinated the family with his ridiculous
charities if it had not been for my four quartersWhat between his
willfullness and his waste his trumps and his frenzy I lead the life
of an indented slave Alderney gave four gallons aday ever since the
calf was sent to market There is so much milk out of my dairy and the
press must stand still but I wont loose a cheese pairing and the milk
shall be made good if the sarvents should go without butter If they
must needs have butter let them make it of sheeps milk but then my
wool will suffer for want of grace so that I must be a loser on all
sides Well patience is like a stout Welsh poney it bears a great
deal and trots a great way but it will tire at the long run Before
its long perhaps I may shew Matt that I was not born to be the
household drudge to my dying dayGwyn rites from Crickhowel that the
price of flannel is fallen threefarthings an ell and thats another
good penny out of my pocket When I go to market to sell my commodity
stinks but when I want to buy the commonest thing the owner pricks
it up under my nose and it cant be had for love nor moneyI think
everything runs cross at BrambletonhallYou say the gander has broke
the eggs which is a phinumenon I dont understand for when the fox
carried off the old goose last year he took her place and hatched the
eggs and partected the goslings like a tender parentThen you tell me
the thunder has soured two barrels of beer in the seller But how the
thunder should get there when the seller was doublelocked I cant
comprehend Howsomever I wont have the beer thrown out till I see it
with my own eyes Perhaps it will recoverAt least it will serve for
vinegar to the servantsYou may leave off the fires in my brothers
chamber and mine as it is unsartain when we returnI hope Gwyllim
youll take care there is no waste and have an eye to the maids and
keep them to their spinning I think they may go very well without beer

Yours TABITHA BRAMBLE BATH April 26




To Dr LEWIS

DEAR DICK

I have done with the waters therefore your advice comes a day too late
I grant that physic is no mystery of your making I know it is a mystery
in its own nature and like other mysteries requires a strong gulp of
faith to make it go downTwo days ago I went into the Kings Bath
by the advice of our friend Ch in order to clear the strainer of the
skin for the benefit of a free perspiration and the first object that
saluted my eye was a child full of scrophulous ulcers carried in the
arms of one of the guides under the very noses of the bathers I was
so shocked at the sight that I retired immediately with indignation
and disgustSuppose the matter of those ulcers floating on the water
comes in contact with my skin when the pores are all open I would ask
you what must be the consequenceGood Heaven the very thought makes
my blood run cold we know not what sores may be running into the water
while we are bathing and what sort of matter we may thus imbibe the
kingsevil the scurvy the cancer and the pox and no doubt the
heat will render the virus the more volatile and penetrating To purify
myself from all such contamination I went to the duke of Kingstons
private Bath and there I was almost suffocated for want of free air
the place was so small and the steam so stifling

After all if the intention is no more than to wash the skin I
am convinced that simple element is more effectual than any water
impregnated with salt and iron which being astringent will certainly
contract the pores and leave a kind of crust upon the surface of the
body But I am now as much afraid of drinking as of bathing for after
a long conversation with the Doctor about the construction of the
pump and the cistern it is very far from being clear with me that the
patients in the Pumproom dont swallow the scourings of the bathers I
cant help suspecting that there is or may be some regurgitation from
the bath into the cistern of the pump In that case what a delicate
beveridge is every day quaffed by the drinkers medicated with the sweat
and dirt and dandriff and the abominable discharges of various kinds
from twenty different diseased bodies parboiling in the kettle below
In order to avoid this filthy composition I had recourse to the spring
that supplies the private baths on the Abbeygreen but I at once
perceived something extraordinary in the taste and smell and upon
inquiry I find that the Roman baths in this quarter were found covered
by an old burying ground belonging to the Abbey through which in all
probability the water drains in its passage so that as we drink the
decoction of living bodies at the Pumproom we swallow the strainings
of rotten bones and carcasses at the private bath I vow to God the
very idea turns my stomach Determined as I am against any farther use
of the Bath waters this consideration would give me little disturbance
if I could find any thing more pure or less pernicious to quench my
thirst but although the natural springs of excellent water are seen
gushing spontaneous on every side from the hills that surround us the
inhabitants in general make use of wellwater so impregnated with
nitre or alum or some other villainous mineral that it is equally
ungrateful to the taste and mischievous to the constitution It must
be owned indeed that here in Milshamstreet we have a precarious and
scanty supply from the hill which is collected in an open bason in
the Circus liable to be defiled with dead dogs cats rats and every
species of nastiness which the rascally populace may throw into it
from mere wantonness and brutality Well there is no nation that drinks
so hoggishly as the English

What passes for wine among us is not the juice of the grape It is an
adulterous mixture brewed up of nauseous ingredients by dunces
who are bunglers in the art of poisonmaking and yet we and our
forefathers are and have been poisoned by this cursed drench without
taste or flavourThe only genuine and wholesome beveridge in England
is London porter and Dorchester tablebeer but as for your ale and
your gin your cyder and your perry and all the trashy family of
made wines I detest them as infernal compositions contrived for the
destruction of the human speciesBut what have I to do with the human
species except a very few friends I care not if the whole was

Heark ye Lewis my misanthropy increases every dayThe longer I
live I find the folly and the fraud of mankind grow more and more
intolerableI wish I had not come from Brambletonhall after having
lived in solitude so long I cannot bear the hurry and impertinence of
the multitude besides every thing is sophisticated in these crowded
places Snares are laid for our lives in every thing we cat or drink
the very air we breathe is loaded with contagion We cannot even
sleep without risque of infection I say infectionThis place is
the rendezvous of the diseasedYou wont deny that many diseases are
infectious even the consumption itself is highly infectious When a
person dies of it in Italy the bed and bedding are destroyed the other
furniture is exposed to the weather and the apartment whitewashed
before it is occupied by any other living soul Youll allow that
nothing receives infection sooner or retains it longer than blankets
featherbeds and matrassesSdeath how do I know what miserable
objects have been stewing in the bed where I now lieI wonder Dick
you did not put me in mind of sending for my own matrassesBut if I
had not been an ass I should not have needed a remembrancerThere is
always some plaguy reflection that rises up in judgment against me and
ruffles my spiritsTherefore let us change the subject

I have other reasons for abridging my stay at BathYou know sister
Tabbys complexionIf Mrs Tabitha Bramble had been of any other race
I should certainly have considered her as the most But the truth
is she has found means to interest my affection or rather she is
beholden to the force of prejudice commonly called the ties of
blood Well this amiable maiden has actually commenced a flirting
correspondence with an Irish baronet of sixtyfive His name is Sir Ulic
Mackilligut He is said to be much out at elbows and I believe has
received false intelligence with respect to her fortune Be that as
it may the connexion is exceedingly ridiculous and begins already
to excite whispers For my part I have no intention to dispute her
freeagency though I shall fall upon some expedient to undeceive her
paramour as to the point which he has principally in view But I dont
think her conduct is a proper example for Liddy who has also attracted

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR KNIGHT

I think those people are unreasonable who complain that Bath is a
contracted circle in which the same dull scenes perpetually revolve
without variationI am on the contrary amazed to find so small a
place so crowded with entertainment and variety London itself can
hardly exhibit one species of diversion to which we have not something
analogous at Bath over and above those singular advantages that are
peculiar to the place Here for example a man has daily opportunities
of seeing the most remarkable characters of the community He sees
them in their natural attitudes and true colours descended from their
pedestals and divested of their formal draperies undisguised by art
and affectationHere we have ministers of state judges generals
bishops projectors philosophers wits poets players chemists
fiddlers and buffoons If he makes any considerable stay in the place
he is sure of meeting with some particular friend whom he did not
expect to see and to me there is nothing more agreeable than such
casual reencounters Another entertainment peculiar to Bath arises
from the general mixture of all degrees assembled in our public
rooms without distinction of rank or fortune This is what my uncle
reprobates as a monstrous jumble of heterogeneous principles a vile
mob of noise and impertinence without decency or subordination But
this chaos is to me a source of infinite amusement

I was extremely diverted last ballnight to see the Master of the
Ceremonies leading with great solemnity to the upper end of the room
an antiquated Abigail dressed in her ladys castclothes whom he I
suppose mistook for some countess just arrived at the Bath The
ball was opened by a Scotch lord with a mulatto heiress from St
Christophers and the gay colonel Tinsel danced all the evening
with the daughter of an eminent tinman from the borough of Southwark
Yesterday morning at the Pumproom I saw a brokenwinded
Wapping landlady squeeze through a circle of peers to salute her
brandymerchant who stood by the window propped upon crutches and a
paralytic attorney of Shoelane in shuffling up to the bar kicked the
shins of the chancellor of England while his lordship in a cut bob
drank a glass of water at the pump I cannot account for my being
pleased with these incidents any other way than by saying they are
truly ridiculous in their own nature and serve to heighten the humour
in the farce of life which I am determined to enjoy as long as I can

Those follies that move my uncles spleen excite my laughter He is
as tender as a man without a skin who cannot bear the slightest touch
without flinching What tickles another would give him torment and
yet he has what we may call lucid intervals when he is remarkably
facetiousIndeed I never knew a hypochondriac so apt to be infected
with goodhumour He is the most risible misanthrope I ever met with
A lucky joke or any ludicrous incident will set him alaughing
immoderately even in one of his most gloomy paroxysms and when the
laugh is over he will curse his own imbecility In conversing with
strangers he betrays no marks of disquietHe is splenetic with his
familiars only and not even with them while they keep his attention
employed but when his spirits are not exerted externally they seem
to recoil and prey upon himselfHe has renounced the waters with
execration but he begins to find a more efficacious and certainly
a much more palatable remedy in the pleasures of society He has
discovered some old friends among the invalids of Bath and in
particular renewed his acquaintance with the celebrated James Quin who
certainly did not come here to drink water You cannot doubt but that I
had the strongest curiosity to know this original and it was gratified
by Mr Bramble who has had him twice at our house to dinner

So far as I am able to judge Quins character is rather more
respectable than it has been generally represented His bon mots are in
every witlings mouth but many of them have a rank flavour which one
would be apt to think was derived from a natural grossness of idea
I suspect however that justice has not been done the author by the
collectors of those Quiniana who have let the best of them slip through
their fingers and only retained such as were suited to the taste and
organs of the multitude How far he may relax in his hours of jollity I
cannot pretend to say but his general conversation is conducted by the
nicest rules of Propriety and Mr James Quin is certainly one of the
best bred men in the kingdom He is not only a most agreeable companion
but as I am credibly informed a very honest man highly susceptible
of friendship warm steady and even generous in his attachments
disdaining flattery and incapable of meanness and dissimulation Were I
to judge however from Quins eye alone I should take him to be proud
insolent and cruel There is something remarkably severe and forbidding
in his aspect and I have been told he was ever disposed to insult his
inferiors and dependantsPerhaps that report has influenced my opinion
of his looksYou know we are the fools of prejudice Howsoever that may
be I have as yet seen nothing but his favourable side and my uncle
who frequently confers with him in a corner declares he is one of the
most sensible men he ever knewHe seems to have a reciprocal regard for
old Squaretoes whom he calls by the familiar name of Matthew and often
reminds of their old tavernadventures on the other hand Matthews
eyes sparkle whenever Quin makes his appearanceLet him be never so
jarring and discordant Quin puts him in tune and like treble and bass
in the same concert they make excellent music together Tother day
the conversation turning upon Shakespeare I could not help saying with
some emotion that I would give an hundred guineas to see Mr Quin act
the part of Falstaff upon which turning to me with a smile And I
would give a thousand young gentleman said he that I could gratify
your longing My uncle and he are perfectly agreed in their estimate of
life which Quin says would stink in his nostrils if he did not steep
it in claret

I want to see this phenomenon in his cups and have almost prevailed
upon uncle to give him a small turtle at the Bear In the mean time I
must entertain you with an incident that seems to confirm the judgment
of those two cynic philosophers I took the liberty to differ in opinion
from Mr Bramble when he observed that the mixture of people in the
entertainments of this place was destructive of all order and urbanity
that it rendered the plebeians insufferably arrogant and troublesome
and vulgarized the deportment and sentiments of those who moved in the
upper spheres of life He said such a preposterous coalition would bring
us into contempt with all our neighbours and was worse in fact than
debasing the gold coin of the nation I argued on the contrary that
those plebeians who discovered such eagerness to imitate the dress and
equipage of their superiors would likewise in time adopt their maxims
and their manners be polished by their conversation and refined by
their example but when I appealed to Mr Quin and asked if he did not
think that such an unreserved mixture would improve the whole mass Yes
said he as a plate of marmalade would improve a pan of sirreverence

I owned I was not much conversant in highlife but I had seen what were
called polite assemblies in London and elsewhere that those of Bath
seemed to be as decent as any and that upon the whole the individuals
that composed it would not be found deficient in good manners and
decorum But let us have recourse to experience said IJack Holder
who was intended for a parson has succeeded to an estate of two
thousand a year by the death of his elder brother He is now at the
Bath driving about in a phaeton and four with French horns He has
treated with turtle and claret at all the taverns in Bath and Bristol
till his guests are gorged with good chear he has bought a dozen suits
of fine clothes by the advice of the Master of the Ceremonies under
whose tuition he has entered himself He has lost hundreds at billiards
to sharpers and taken one of the nymphs of Avonstreet into keeping
but finding all these channels insufficient to drain him of his current
cash his counsellor has engaged him to give a general teadrinking
tomorrow at Wiltshires room In order to give it the more eclat every
table is to be furnished with sweetmeats and nosegays which however
are not to be touched till notice is given by the ringing of a bell and
then the ladies may help themselves without restriction This will be no
bad way of trying the companys breeding

I will abide by that experiment cried my uncle and if I could find
a place to stand secure without the vortex of the tumult which I know
will ensue I would certainly go thither and enjoy the scene Quin
proposed that we should take our station in the musicgallery and
we took his advice Holder had got thither before us with his horns
perdue but we were admitted The teadrinking passed as usual and the
company having risen from the tables were sauntering in groupes in
expectation of the signal for attack when the bell beginning to
ring they flew with eagerness to the dessert and the whole place was
instantly in commotion There was nothing but justling scrambling
pulling snatching struggling scolding and screaming The nosegays
were torn from one anothers hands and bosoms the glasses and china
went to wreck the tables and floors were strewed with comfits Some
cried some swore and the tropes and figures of Billingsgate were used
without reserve in all their native zest and flavour nor were those
flowers of rhetoric unattended with significant gesticulation Some
snapped their fingers some forked them out some clapped their hands
and some their backsides at length they fairly proceeded to pulling
caps and every thing seemed to presage a general battle when Holder
ordered his horns to sound a charge with a view to animate the
combatants and inflame the contest but this manoeuvre produced an
effect quite contrary to what he expected It was a note of reproach
that roused them to an immediate sense of their disgraceful situation
They were ashamed of their absurd deportment and suddenly desisted
They gathered up their caps ruffles and handkerchiefs and great part
of them retired in silent mortification

Quin laughed at this adventure but my uncles delicacy was hurt He
hung his head in manifest chagrin and seemed to repine at the triumph
of his judgmentIndeed his victory was more complete than he imagined
for as we afterwards learned the two amazons who singularized
themselves most in the action did not come from the purlieus of
Puddledock but from the courtly neighbourhood of St Jamess palace
One was a baroness and the other a wealthy knights dowagerMy uncle
spoke not a word till we had made our retreat good to the coffeehouse
where taking off his hat and wiping his forehead I bless God said
he that Mrs Tabitha Bramble did not take the field today I would pit
her for a cool hundred cried Quin against the best shakebag of the
whole main The truth is nothing could have kept her at home but the
accident of her having taken physic before she knew the nature of the
entertainment She has been for some days furbishing up an old suit of
black velvet to make her appearance as Sir Ulics partner at the next
ball

I have much to say of this amiable kinswoman but she has not been
properly introduced to your acquaintance She is remarkably civil to
Mr Quin of whose sarcastic humour she seems to stand in awe but her
caution is no match for her impertinence Mr Gwynn said she the other
day I was once vastly entertained with your playing the Ghost of Gimlet
at Drurylane when you rose up through the stage with a white face and
red eyes and spoke of quails upon the frightful porcofineDo pray
spout a little the Ghost of Gimlet Madam said Quin with a glance of
ineffable disdain the Ghost of Gimlet is laid never to rise again
Insensible of this check she proceeded Well to be sure you looked
and talked so like a real ghost and then the cock crowed so natural
I wonder how you could teach him to crow so exact in the very nick of
time but I suppose hes gameAnt he game Mr Gwynn Dunghill
madamWell dunghill or not dunghill he has got such a clear
countertenor that I wish I had such another at Brambletonhall to
wake the maids of a morning Do you know where I could find one of his
brood Probably in the workhouse at St Giless parish madam but I
protest I know not his particular mew My uncle frying with vexation
cried Good God sister how you talk I have told you twenty times
that this gentlemans name is not GwynnHoity toity brother mine
she replied no offence I hopeGwynn is an honorable name of true
old British extractionI thought the gentleman had been come of Mrs
Helen Gwynn who was of his own profession and if so be that were the
case he might be of king Charless breed and have royal blood in his
veinsNo madam answered Quin with great solemnity my mother was
not a whore of such distinctionTrue it is I am sometimes tempted
to believe myself of royal descent for my inclinations are often
arbitraryIf I was an absolute prince at this instant I believe I
should send for the head of your cook in a chargerShe has committed
felony on the person of that John Dory which is mangled in a cruel
manner and even presented without sauceO tempora O mores

This goodhumoured sally turned the conversation into a less
disagreeable channelBut lest you should think my scribble as tedious
as Mrs Tabbys clack I shall not add another word but that I am as
usual

To Dr LEWIS

DEAR LEWIS

I received your bill upon Wiltshire which was punctually honoured but
as I dont choose to keep so much cash by me in a common lodging house
I have deposited 250l in the bank of Bath and shall take their bills
for it in London when I leave this place where the season draws to an
endYou must know that now being afoot I am resolved to give Liddy a
glimpse of London She is one of the best hearted creatures I ever knew
and gains upon my affection every dayAs for Tabby I have dropt such
hints to the Irish baronet concerning her fortune as I make no doubt
will cool the ardour of his addresses Then her pride will take the
alarm and the rancour of stale maidenhood being chafed we shall hear
nothing but slander and abuse of Sir Ulic MackilligutThis rupture
I foresee will facilitate our departure from Bath where at present
Tabby seems to enjoy herself with peculiar satisfaction For my part I
detest it so much that I should not have been able to stay so long in
the place if I had not discovered some old friends whose conversation
alleviates my disgustGoing to the coffeehouse one forenoon I
could not help contemplating the company with equal surprize and
compassionWe consisted of thirteen individuals seven lamed by the
gout rheumatism or palsy three maimed by accident and the rest
either deaf or blind One hobbled another hopped a third dragged his
legs after him like a wounded snake a fourth straddled betwixt a pair
of long crutches like the mummy of a felon hanging in chains a fifth
was bent into a horizontal position like a mounted telescope shoved in
by a couple of chairmen and a sixth was the bust of a man set upright
in a wheel machine which the waiter moved from place to place

Being struck with some of their faces I consulted the
subscriptionbook and perceiving the names of several old friends
began to consider the groupe with more attention At length I discovered
rearadmiral Balderick the companion of my youth whom I had not seen
since he was appointed lieutenant of the Severn He was metamorphosed
into an old man with a wooden leg and a weatherbeaten face which
appeared the more ancient from his grey locks that were truly
venerableSitting down at the table where he was reading a newspaper
I gazed at him for some minutes with a mixture of pleasure and regret
which made my heart gush with tenderness then taking him by the hand
Ah Sam said I forty years ago I little thoughtI was too much
moved to proceed An old friend sure enough cried he squeezing my
hand and surveying me eagerly through his glasses I know the looming
of the vessel though she has been hard strained since we parted but I
cant heave up the nameThe moment I told him who I was he exclaimed
Ha Matt my old fellow cruizer still afloat And starting up
hugged me in his arms His transport however boded me no good for in
saluting me he thrust the spring of his spectacles into my eye and
at the same time set his wooden stump upon my gouty toe an attack that
made me shed tears in sad earnestAfter the hurry of our recognition
was over he pointed out two of our common friends in the room the bust
was what remained of colonel Cockril who had lost the use of his
limbs in making an American campaign and the telescope proved to be
my college chum sir Reginald Bently who with his new title and
unexpected inheritance commenced foxhunter without having served
his apprenticeship to the mystery and in consequence of following the
hounds through a river was seized with an inflammation of his bowels
which has contracted him into his present attitude

Our former correspondence was forthwith renewed with the most hearty
expressions of mutual goodwill and as we had met so unexpectedly we
agreed to dine together that very day at the tavern My friend Quin
being luckily unengaged obliged us with his company and truly this
the most happy day I have passed these twenty years You and I Lewis
having been always together never tasted friendship in this high gout
contracted from long absence I cannot express the half of what I felt
at this casual meeting of three or four companions who had been so
long separated and so roughly treated by the storms of life It was a
renovation of youth a kind of resuscitation of the dead that realized
those interesting dreams in which we sometimes retrieve our ancient
friends from the grave Perhaps my enjoyment was not the less pleasing
for being mixed with a strain of melancholy produced by the remembrance
of past scenes that conjured up the ideas of some endearing connexions
which the hand of Death has actually dissolved

The spirits and good humour of the company seemed to triumph over the
wreck of their constitutions They had even philosophy enough to
joke upon their own calamities such is the power of friendship the
sovereign cordial of lifeI afterwards found however that they were
not without their moments and even hours of disquiet Each of them
apart in succeeding conferences expatiated upon his own particular
grievances and they were all malcontents at bottomOver and above
their personal disasters they thought themselves unfortunate in the
lottery of life Balderick complained that all the recompence he
had received for his long and hard service was the halfpay of a
rearadmiral The colonel was mortified to see himself overtopped by
upstart generals some of whom he had once commanded and being a man
of a liberal turn could ill put up with a moderate annuity for which
he had sold his commission As for the baronet having run himself
considerably in debt on a contested election he has been obliged to
relinquish his seat in parliament and his seat in the country at the
same time and put his estate to nurse but his chagrin which is the
effect of his own misconduct does not affect me half so much as that of
the other two who have acted honourable and distinguished parts on the
great theatre and are now reduced to lead a weary life in this stewpan
of idleness and insignificance They have long left off using the
waters after having experienced their inefficacy The diversions of the
place they are not in a condition to enjoy How then do they make shift
to pass their time In the forenoon they crawl out to the Rooms or
the coffeehouse where they take a hand at whist or descant upon the
General Advertiser and their evenings they murder in private parties
among peevish invalids and insipid old womenThis is the case with
a good number of individuals whom nature seems to have intended for
better purposes

About a dozen years ago many decent families restricted to small
fortunes besides those that came hither on the score of health were
tempted to settle at Bath where they could then live comfortably and
even make a genteel appearance at a small expence but the madness of
the times has made the place too hot for them and they are now obliged
to think of other migrationsSome have already fled to the mountains
of Wales and others have retired to Exeter Thither no doubt they
will be followed by the flood of luxury and extravagance which will
drive them from place to place to the very Lands End and there I
suppose they will be obliged to ship themselves to some other country
Bath is become a mere sink of profligacy and extortion Every article of
housekeeping is raised to an enormous price a circumstance no longer
to be wondered at when we know that every petty retainer of fortune
piques himself upon keeping a table and thinks it is for the honour
of his character to wink at the knavery of his servants who are in a
confederacy with the marketpeople and of consequence pay whatever
they demand Here is now a mushroom of opulence who pays a cook seventy
guineas a week for furnishing him with one meal a day This portentous
frenzy is become so contagious that the very rabble and refuse of
mankind are infected I have known a negrodriver from Jamaica pay
overnight to the master of one of the rooms sixtyfive guineas for
tea and coffee to the company and leave Bath next morning in such
obscurity that not one of his guests had the slightest idea of his
person or even made the least inquiry about his name Incidents of this
kind are frequent and every day teems with fresh absurdities which are
too gross to make a thinking man merry

But I feel the spleen creeping on me apace and therefore will indulge
you with a cessation that you may have no unnecessary cause to curse
your correspondence with

Dear Dick Yours ever MAT BRAMBLE BATH May 5




To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS at Gloucester

MY DEAR LETTY

I wrote you at great length by the post the twentysixth of last month
to which I refer you for an account of our proceedings at Bath and I
expect your answer with impatience But having this opportunity of a
private hand I send you two dozen of Bath rings six of the best of
which I desire you will keep for yourself and distribute the rest among
the young ladies our common friends as you shall think properI dont
know how you will approve of the mottoes some of them are not much
to my own liking but I was obliged to take such as I could find ready
manufacturedI am vexed that neither you nor I have received any
further information of a certain personSure it cannot be wilful
neglectO my dear Willis I begin to be visited by strange fancies
and to have some melancholy doubts which however it would be
ungenerous to harbour without further inquiryMy uncle who has made
me a present of a very fine set of garnets talks of treating us with a
jaunt to London which you may imagine will be highly agreeable but
I like Bath so well that I hope he wont think of leaving it till the
season is quite over and yet betwixt friends something has happened
to my aunt which will probably shorten our stay in this place

Yesterday in the forenoon she went by herself to a breakfasting in one
of the rooms and in half an hour returned in great agitation having
Chowder along with her in the chair I believe some accident must have
happened to that unlucky animal which is the great source of all her
troubles Dear Letty what a pity it is that a woman of her years
and discretion should place her affection upon such an ugly
illconditioned cur that snarls and snaps at every body I asked John
Thomas the footman who attended her what was the matter and he did
nothing but grin A famous dogdoctor was sent for and undertook to
cure the patient provided he might carry him home to his own house but
his mistress would not part with him out of her own sightShe ordered
the cook to warm cloths which she applied to his bowels with her own
hand She gave up all thoughts of going to the ball in the evening and
when Sir Ulic came to drink tea refused to be seen so that he went
away to look for another partner My brother Jery whistles and dances
My uncle sometimes shrugs up his shoulders and sometimes bursts out
alaughing My aunt sobs and scolds by turns and her woman Win
Jenkins stares and wonders with a foolish face of curiosity and for
my part I am as curious as she but ashamed to ask questions

Perhaps time will discover the mystery for if it was any thing that
happened in the Rooms it cannot be long concealedAll I know is that
last night at supper miss Bramble spoke very disdainfully of Sir Ulic
Mackilligut and asked her brother if he intended to keep us sweltering
all the summer at Bath No sister Tabitha said he with an arch
smile we shall retreat before the Dogdays begin though I make no
doubt that with a little temperance and discretion our constitutions
might be kept cool enough all the year even at Bath As I dont know
the meaning of this insinuation I wont pretend to make any remarks
upon it at present hereafter perhaps I may be able to explain it more
to your satisfactionIn the mean time I beg you will be punctual in
your correspondence and continue to love your ever faithful

LYDIA MELFORD BATH May 6




To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS of Jesus college Oxon

So then Mrs Blackerbys affair has proved a false alarm and I have
saved my money I wish however her declaration had not been so
premature for though my being thought capable of making her a mother
might have given me some credit the reputation of an intrigue with such
a cracked pitcher does me no honour at all In my last I told you I had
hopes of seeing Quin in his hours of elevation at the tavern which is
the temple of mirth and good fellowship where he as priest of Comus
utters the inspirations of wit and humourI have had that satisfaction
I have dined with his club at the Three Tuns and had the honour to sit
him out At half an hour past eight in the evening he was carried
home with six good bottles of claret under his belt and it being then
Friday he gave orders that he should not be disturbed till Sunday at
noonYou must not imagine that this dose had any other effect upon his
conversation but that of making it more extravagantly entertainingHe
had lost the use of his limbs indeed several hours before we parted
but he retained all his other faculties in perfection and as he gave
vent to every whimsical idea as it rose I was really astonished at the
brilliancy of his thoughts and the force of his expression Quin is a
real voluptuary in the articles of eating and drinking and so confirmed
an epicure in the common acceptation of the term that he cannot put up
with ordinary fare This is a point of such importance with him that he
always takes upon himself the charge of catering and a man admitted
to his mess is always sure of eating delicate victuals and drinking
excellent wineHe owns himself addicted to the delights of the stomach
and often jokes upon his own sensuality but there is nothing selfish in
this appetiteHe finds that good chear unites good company exhilerates
the spirits opens the heart banishes all restraint from conversation
and promotes the happiest purposes of social life But Mr James Quin
is not a subject to be discussed in the compass of one letter I shall
therefore at present leave him to his repose and call another of a
very different complexion

You desire to have further acquaintance with the person of our aunt
and promise yourself much entertainment from her connexion with Sir Ulic
Mackilligut but in this hope you are baulked already that connexion is
dissolved The Irish baronet is an old hound that finding her carrion
has quitted the scentI have already told you that Mrs Tabitha Bramble
is a maiden of fortyfive In her person she is tall rawboned
aukward flatchested and stooping her complexion is sallow and
freckled her eyes are not grey but greenish like those of a cat and
generally inflamed her hair is of a sandy or rather dusty hue her
forehead low her nose long sharp and towards the extremity always
red in cool weather her lips skinny her mouth extensive her teeth
straggling and loose of various colours and conformation and her long
neck shrivelled into a thousand wrinklesIn her temper she is proud
stiff vain imperious prying malicious greedy and uncharitable In
all likelihood her natural austerity has been soured by disappointment
in love for her long celibacy is by no means owing to her dislike of
matrimony on the contrary she has left no stone unturned to avoid the
reproachful epithet of old maid

Before I was born she had gone such lengths in the way of flirting
with a recruiting officer that her reputation was a little singed She
afterwards made advances to the curate of the parish who dropped some
distant hints about the next presentation to the living which was in
her brothers gift but finding that was already promised to another he
flew off at a tangent and Mrs Tabby in revenge found means to deprive
him of his cure Her next lover was lieutenant of a man of war a
relation of the family who did not understand the refinements of the
passion and expressed no aversion to grapple with cousin Tabby in the
way of marriage but before matters could be properly adjusted he went
out on a cruise and was killed in an engagement with a French frigate
Our aunt though baffled so often did not yet despair She layed all
her snares for Dr Lewis who is the fidus Achates of my uncle She even
fell sick upon the occasion and prevailed with Matt to interpose in her
behalf with his friend but the Doctor being a shy cock would not be
caught with chaff and flatly rejected the proposal so that Mrs Tabitha
was content to exert her patience once more after having endeavoured
in vain to effect a rupture betwixt the two friends and now she thinks
proper to be very civil to Lewis who is become necessary to her in the
way of his profession

These however are not the only efforts she has made towards a nearer
conjunction with our sex Her fortune was originally no more than a
thousand pounds but she gained an accession of five hundred by the
death of a sister and the lieutenant left her three hundred in his
will These sums she has more than doubled by living free of all
expence in her brothers house and dealing in cheese and Welsh
flannel the produce of his flocks and dairy At present her capital is
increased to about four thousand pounds and her avarice seems to grow
every day more and more rapacious but even this is not so intolerable
as the perverseness of her nature which keeps the whole family
in disquiet and uproar She is one of those geniuses who find
some diabolical enjoyment in being dreaded and detested by their
fellowcreatures

I once told my uncle I was surprised that a man of his disposition
could bear such a domestic plague when it could be so easily removed
The remark made him sore because it seemed to tax him with want of
resolutionWrinkling up his nose and drawing down his eyebrows A
young fellow said he when he first thrusts his snout into the world
is apt to be surprised at many things which a man of experience knows
to be ordinary and unavoidableThis precious aunt of yours is become
insensibly a part of my constitutionDamn her Shes a noli me tangere
in my flesh which I cannot bear to be touched or tampered with I made
no reply but shifted the conversation He really has an affection for
this original which maintains its ground in defiance of common sense
and in despite of that contempt which he must certainly feel for her
character and understanding Nay I am convinced that she has likewise
a most virulent attachment to his person though her love never shews
itself but in the shape of discontent and she persists in tormenting
him out of pure tendernessThe only object within doors upon which she
bestows any marks of affection in the usual stile is her dog Chowder
a filthy cur from Newfoundland which she had in a present from the wife
of a skipper in Swansey One would imagine she had distinguished this
beast with her favour on account of his ugliness and illnature if it
was not indeed an instinctive sympathy between his disposition and
her own Certain it is she caresses him without ceasing and even
harasses the family in the service of this cursed animal which indeed
has proved the proximate cause of her breach with Sir Ulic Mackilligut

You must know she yesterday wanted to steal a march of poor Liddy and
went to breakfast in the Room without any other companion than her dog
in expectation of meeting with the Baronet who had agreed to dance with
her in the eveningChowder no sooner made his appearance in the Room
than the Master of the Ceremonies incensed at his presumption ran
up to drive him away and threatened him with his foot but the other
seemed to despise his authority and displaying a formidable case of
long white sharp teeth kept the puny monarch at bayWhile he stood
under some trepidation fronting his antagonist and bawling to the
waiter Sir Ulic Mackilligut came to his assistance and seeming
ignorant of the connexion between this intruder and his mistress gave
the former such a kick in the jaws as sent him howling to the doorMrs
Tabitha incensed at this outrage ran after him squalling in a tone
equally disagreeable while the Baronet followed her on one side
making apologies for his mistake and Derrick on the other making
remonstrances upon the rules and regulations of the place

Far from being satisfied with the Knights excuses she said she was
sure he was no gentleman and when the Master of the Ceremonies offered
to hand her into the chair she rapped him over the knuckles with her
fan My uncles footman being still at the door she and Chowder got
into the same vehicle and were carried off amidst the jokes of the
chairmen and other populaceI had been riding out on Clerkendown and
happened to enter just as the fracas was overThe Baronet coming up to
me with an affected air of chagrin recounted the adventure at which
I laughed heartily and then his countenance cleared up My dear soul
said he when I saw a sort of a wild baist snarling with open mouth
at the Master of the Ceremonies like the red cow going to devour Tom
Thumb I could do no less than go to the assistance of the little man
but I never dreamt the baist was one of Mrs Brambles attendantsO if
I had he might have made his breakfast upon Derrick and welcomeBut
you know my dear friend how natural it is for us Irishmen to blunder
and to take the wrong sow by the earHowever I will confess judgment
and cry her mercy and it is to be hoped a penitent sinner may be
forgiven I told him that as the offence was not voluntary of his
side it was to be hoped he would not find her implacable

But in truth all this concern was dissembled In his approaches of
gallantry to Mrs Tabitha he had been misled by a mistake of at least
six thousand pounds in the calculation of her fortune and in this
particular he was just undeceived He therefore seized the first
opportunity of incurring her displeasure decently in such a manner as
would certainly annihilate the correspondence and he could not have
taken a more effectual method than that of beating her dog When he
presented himself at our door to pay his respects to the offended fair
he was refused admittance and given to understand that he should never
find her at home for the future She was not so inaccessible to Derrick
who came to demand satisfaction for the insult she had offered to him
even in the verge of his own court She knew it was convenient to be
well with the Master of the Ceremonies while she continued to frequent
the Rooms and having heard he was a poet began to be afraid of making
her appearance in a ballad or lampoonShe therefore made excuses
for what she had done imputing it to the flutter of her spirits and
subscribed handsomely for his poems so that he was perfectly appeased
and overwhelmed her with a profusion of compliment He even solicited a
reconciliation with Chowder which however the latter declined and he
declared that if he could find a precedent in the annals of the Bath
which he would carefully examine for that purpose her favourite should
be admitted to the next public breakfastingBut I believe she will
not expose herself or him to the risque of a second disgraceWho will
supply the place of Mackilligut in her affections I cannot foresee
but nothing in the shape of man can come amiss Though she is a violent
churchwoman of the most intolerant zeal I believe in my conscience
she would have no objection at present to treat on the score of
matrimony with an Anabaptist Quaker or Jew and even ratify the treaty
at the expense of her own conversion But perhaps I think too hardly
of this kinswoman who I must own is very little beholden to the good
opinion of

To Dr LEWIS

You ask me why I dont take the air ahorseback during this fine
weatherIn which of the avenues of this paradise would you have me
take that exercise Shall I commit myself to the highroads of London
or Bristol to be stifled with dust or pressed to death in the midst
of postchaises flyingmachines waggons and coalhorses besides
the troops of fine gentlemen that take to the highway to shew their
horsemanship and the coaches of fine ladies who go thither to shew
their equipages Shall I attempt the Downs and fatigue myself to death
in climbing up an eternal ascent without any hopes of reaching the
summit Know then I have made divers desperate leaps at those upper
regions but always fell backward into this vapourpit exhausted
and dispirited by those ineffectual efforts and here we poor
valetudinarians pant and struggle like so many Chinese gudgeons
gasping in the bottom of a punchbowl By Heaven it is a kind of
enchantment If I do not speedily break the spell and escape I may
chance to give up the ghost in this nauseous stew of corruptionIt was
but two nights ago that I had like to have made my public exit at a
minutes warning One of my greatest weaknesses is that of suffering
myself to be overruled by the opinion of people whose judgment I
despiseI own with shame and confusion of face that importunity
of any kind I cannot resist This want of courage and constancy is an
original flaw in my nature which you must have often observed with
compassion if not with contempt I am afraid some of our boasted
virtues maybe traced up to this defect

Without further preamble I was persuaded to go to a ball on purpose to
see Liddy dance a minuet with a young petulant jackanapes the only
son of a wealthy undertaker from London whose mother lodges in our
neighbourhood and has contracted an acquaintance with Tabby I sat a
couple of long hours half stifled in the midst of a noisome crowd
and could not help wondering that so many hundreds of those that rank as
rational creatures could find entertainment in seeing a succession of
insipid animals describing the same dull figure for a whole evening on
an area not much bigger than a taylors shopboard If there had been
any beauty grace activity magnificent dress or variety of any kind
howsoever absurd to engage the attention and amuse the fancy I should
not have been surprised but there was no such object it was a tiresome
repetition of the same languid frivolous scene performed by actors
that seemed to sleep in all their motions The continual swimming of
these phantoms before my eyes gave me a swimming of the head which was
also affected by the fouled air circulating through such a number of
rotten human bellows I therefore retreated towards the door and stood
in the passage to the next room talking to my friend Quin when an end
being put to the minuets the benches were removed to make way for the
countrydances and the multitude rising at once the whole atmosphere
was put in commotion Then all of a sudden came rushing upon me an
Egyptian gale so impregnated with pestilential vapours that my nerves
were overpowered and I dropt senseless upon the floor

You may easily conceive what a clamour and confusion this accident must
have produced in such an assemblyI soon recovered however and found
myself in an easy chair supported by my own peopleSister Tabby in
her great tenderness had put me to the torture squeezing my hand under
her arm and stuffing my nose with spirit of hartshorn till the whole
inside was excoriated I no sooner got home than I sent for Doctor
Ch who assured me I needed not be alarmed for my swooning was
entirely occasioned by an accidental impression of fetid effluvia upon
nerves of uncommon sensibility I know not how other peoples nerves
are constructed but one would imagine they must be made of very coarse
materials to stand the shock of such a torrid assault It was indeed
a compound of villainous smells in which the most violent stinks
and the most powerful perfumes contended for the mastery Imagine to
yourself a high exalted essence of mingled odours arising from putrid
gums imposthumated lungs sour flatulencies rank armpits sweating
feet running sores and issues plasters ointments and embrocations
hungarywater spirit of lavender assafoetida drops musk hartshorn
and sal volatile besides a thousand frowzy steams which I could not
analyse Such O Dick is the fragrant aether we breathe in the polite
assemblies of BathSuch is the atmosphere I have exchanged for the
pure elastic animating air of the Welsh mountainsO Rus quando te
aspiciamI wonder what the devil possessed me

But few words are best I have taken my resolutionYou may well suppose
I dont intend to entertain the company with a second exhibitionI have
promised in an evil hour to proceed to London and that promise shall
be performed but my stay in the metropolis shall be brief I have for
the benefit of my health projected an expedition to the North which I
hope will afford some agreeable pastime I have never travelled farther
that way than Scarborough and I think it is a reproach upon me as a
British freeholder to have lived so long without making an excursion to
the other side of the Tweed Besides I have some relations settled in
Yorkshire to whom it may not be improper to introduce my nephew and
his sisterAt present I have nothing to add but that Tabby is happily
disentangled from the Irish Baronet and that I will not fail to make
you acquainted from time to time with the sequel of our adventures a
mark of consideration which perhaps you would willingly dispense with
in

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR PHILLIPS

A few days ago we were terribly alarmed by my uncles fainting at the
ballHe has been ever since cursing his own folly for going thither at
the request of an impertinent woman He declares he will sooner visit
a house infected with the plague than trust himself in such a nauseous
spital for the future for he swears the accident was occasioned by the
stench of the crowd and that he would never desire a stronger proof of
our being made of very gross materials than our having withstood the
annoyance by which he was so much discomposed For my part I am very
thankful for the coarseness of my organs being in no danger of
ever falling a sacrifice to the delicacy of my nose Mr Bramble is
extravagantly delicate in all his sensations both of soul and body I
was informed by Dr Lewis that he once fought a duel with an officer
of the horseguards for turning aside to the Parkwall on a necessary
occasion when he was passing with a lady under his protection His
blood rises at every instance of insolence and cruelty even where he
himself is no way concerned and ingratitude makes his teeth chatter On
the other hand the recital of a generous humane or grateful action
never fails to draw from him tears of approbation which he is often
greatly distressed to conceal

Yesterday one Paunceford gave tea on particular invitationThis man
after having been long buffetted by adversity went abroad and Fortune
resolved to make him amends for her former coyness set him all at once
up to the very ears in affluence He has now emerged from obscurity
and blazes out in all the tinsel of the times I dont find that he is
charged with any practices that the law deems dishonest or that his
wealth has made him arrogant and inaccessible on the contrary he
takes great pains to appear affable and gracious But they say he
is remarkable for shrinking from his former friendships which were
generally too plain and homespun to appear amidst his present brilliant
connexions and that he seems uneasy at sight of some old benefactors
whom a man of honour would take pleasure to acknowledgeBe that as it
may he had so effectually engaged the company at Bath that when I went
with my uncle to the coffeehouse in the evening there was not a soul
in the room but one person seemingly in years who sat by the fire
reading one of the papers Mr Bramble taking his station close by
him There is such a crowd and confusion of chairs in the passage to
Simpsons said he that we could hardly get alongI wish those
minions of fortune would fall upon more laudable ways of spending their
moneyI suppose Sir you like this kind of entertainment as little as
I do I cannot say I have any great relish for such entertainments
answered the other without taking his eyes off the paperMr Serle
resumed my uncle I beg pardon for interrupting you but I cant resist
the curiosity I have to know if you received a card on this occasion

The man seemed surprised at this address and made some pause as
doubtful what answer he should make I know my curiosity is impertinent
added my uncle but I have a particular reason for asking the favour
If that be the case replied Mr Serle I shall gratify you without
hesitation by owning that I have had no card But give me leave
Sir to ask in my turn what reason you think I have to expect such an
invitation from the gentleman who gives tea I have my own reasons
cried Mr Bramble with some emotion and am convinced more than ever
that this Paunceford is a contemptible fellow Sir said the other
laying down the paper I have not the honour to know you but your
discourse is a little mysterious and seems to require some explanation
The person you are pleased to treat so cavalierly is a gentleman of
some consequence in the community and for aught you know I may also
have my particular reasons for defending his characterIf I was not
convinced of the contrary observed the other I should not have gone so
farLet me tell you Sir said the stranger raising his voice you
have gone too far in hazarding such reflections

Here he was interrupted by my uncle who asked peevishly if he was
Don Quixote enough at this time of day to throw down his gauntlet as
champion for a man who had treated him with such ungrateful neglect
For my part added he I shall never quarrel with you again upon this
subject and what I have said now has been suggested as much by my
regard for you as by my contempt of himMr Serle then pulling off
his spectacles eyed uncle very earnestly saying in a mitigated
tone Surely I am much obligedAh Mr Bramble I now recollect your
features though I have not seen you these many years We might
have been less strangers to one another answered the squire if
our correspondence had not been interrupted in consequence of a
misunderstanding occasioned by this very but no matterMr Serle I
esteem your character and my friendship such as it is you may freely
command The offer is too agreeable to be declined said he I
embrace it very cordially and as the first fruits of it request that
you will change this subject which with me is a matter of peculiar
delicacy

My uncle owned he was in the right and the discourse took a more
general turn Mr Serle passed the evening with us at our lodgings and
appeared to be intelligent and even entertaining but his disposition
was rather of a melancholy hue My uncle says he is a man of uncommon
parts and unquestioned probity that his fortune which was originally
small has been greatly hurt by a romantic spirit of generosity which
he has often displayed even at the expence of his discretion in favour
of worthless individualsThat he had rescued Paunceford from the lowest
distress when he was bankrupt both in means and reputationThat
he had espoused his interests with a degree of enthusiasm broke with
several friends and even drawn his sword against my uncle who had
particular reasons for questioning the moral character of the said
Paunceford that without Serles countenance and assistance the other
never could have embraced the opportunity which has raised him to this
pinnacle of wealth that Paunceford in the first transports of his
success had written from abroad letters to different correspondents
owning his obligations to Mr Serle in the warmest terms of
acknowledgement and declared he considered himself only as a factor
for the occasions of his best friend that without doubt he had made
declarations of the same nature to his benefactor himself though this
last was always silent and reserved on the subject but for some years
those tropes and figures of rhetoric had been disused that upon his
return to England he had been lavish in his caresses to Mr Serle
invited him to his house and pressed him to make it his own that he
had overwhelmed him with general professions and affected to express
the warmest regard for him in company of their common acquaintance so
that every body believed his gratitude was liberal as his fortune and
some went so far as to congratulate Mr Serle on both

All this time Paunceford carefully and artfully avoided particular
discussions with his old patron who had too much spirit to drop
the most distant hint of balancing the account of obligation that
nevertheless a man of his feelings could not but resent this shocking
return for all his kindness and therefore he withdrew himself from
the connexion without coming to the least explanation or speaking
a syllable on the subject to any living soul so that now their
correspondence is reduced to a slight salute with the hat when they
chance to meet in any public place an accident that rarely happens for
their walks lie different ways Mr Paunceford lives in a palace feeds
upon dainties is arrayed in sumptuous apparel appears in all the pomp
of equipage and passes his time among the nobles of the land Serle
lodges in Stallstreet up two pair of stairs backwards walks afoot
in a Bathrug eats for twelve shillings aweek and drinks water
as preservative against the gout and gravelMark the vicissitude
Paunceford once resided in a garret where he subsisted upon
sheepstrotters and cowheel from which commons he was translated to
the table of Serle that ever abounded with goodchear until want of
economy and retention reduced him to a slender annuity in his decline of
years that scarce affords the bare necessaries of lifePaunceford
however does him the honour to speak of him still with uncommon
regard and to declare what pleasure it would give him to contribute in
any shape to his convenience But you know he never fails to add hes
a shy kind of a manAnd then such a perfect philosopher that he looks
upon all superfluities with the most sovereign contempt Having given
you this sketch of squire Paunceford I need not make any comment on his
character but leave it at the mercy of your own reflection from which
I dare say it will meet with as little quarter as it has found with

DEAR MOLLY

We are all upon the vingHey for London girlFecks we have been

in garnet They lite the candle at both endsHeres nothing but
ginketting and wasting and thieving and tricking and trigging and
then they are never contentThey wont suffer the squire and mistress
to stay any longer because they have been already above three weeks in
the house and they look for a couple of ginneys apiece at our going
away and this is a parquisite they expect every month in the season
being as how no family has a right to stay longer than four weeks in
the same lodgings and so the cuck swears she will pin the dishclout to
mistresss tail and the housemaid vows shell put cowitch in masters
bed if so be he dont discamp without furder adoI dont blame
them for making the most of their market in the way of vails and
parquisites and I defy the devil to say I am a tailcarrier or ever
brought a poor sarvant into troubleBut then they oft to have some
conscience in vronging those that be sarvants like themselvesFor you
must no Molly I missed threequarters of blond lace and a remnant
of muslin and my silver thimble which was the gift of true love
they were all in my workbasket that I left upon the table in the
sarvantshall when mistresses bell rung but if they had been under

to all the locks in Bath and they say as how the very teeth ant

myself them things could not go without hands and so Ill watch
their waters and so I did with a vitness for then it was I found Bett
consarned with O Frizzle And as the cuck had thrown her slush at me
because I had taken part with Chowder when he fit with the turnspit
I resolved to make a clear kitchen and throw some of her fat into the
fire I ketched the charewoman going out with her load in the morning
before she thought I was up and brought her to mistress with her whole
cargoMarry what dost think she had got in the name of God Her
buckets were foaming full of our best bear and her lap was stuffed with
a cold tongue part of a buttock of beef half a turkey and a swinging
lump of butter and the matter of ten mould kandles that had scarce
ever been lit The cuck brazened it out and said it was her rite to
rummage the pantry and she was ready for to go before the mare that
he had been her potticary many years and would never think of hurting a
poor sarvant for giving away the scraps of the kitchen I went another
way to work with madam Betty because she had been saucy and called me
skandelus names and said O Frizzle couldnt abide me and twenty other
odorous falsehoods I got a varrant from the mare and her box being

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart of Jesus college Oxon

You are in the right dear Phillips I dont expect regular answers
to every letterI know a collegelife is too circumscribed to afford
materials for such quick returns of communication For my part I am
continually shifting the scene and surrounded with new objects some
of which are striking enough I shall therefore conclude my journal for
your amusement and though in all appearance it will not treat of
very important or interesting particulars it may prove perhaps not
altogether uninstructive and unentertaining

The music and entertainments of Bath are over for this season and
all our gay birds of passage have taken their flight to Bristolwell
Tunbridge Brighthelmstone Scarborough Harrowgate c Not a soul is
seen in this place but a few brokenwinded parsons waddling like so
many crows along the North Parade There is always a great shew of
the clergy at Bath none of your thin puny yellow hectic figures
exhausted with abstinence and hardy study labouring under the morbi
eruditorum but great overgrown dignitaries and rectors with rubicund
noses and gouty ancles or broad bloated faces dragging along great
swag bellies the emblems of sloth and indigestion

Now we are upon the subject of parsons I must tell you a ludicrous
adventure which was achieved the other day by Tom Eastgate whom you
may remember on the foundation of Queens He had been very assiduous
to pin himself upon George Prankley who was a gentlemancommoner of
Christchurch knowing the said Prankley was heir to a considerable
estate and would have the advowson of a good living the incumbent of
which was very old and infirm He studied his passions and flattered
them so effectually as to become his companion and counsellor and
at last obtained of him a promise of the presentation when the living
should fall Prankley on his uncles death quitted Oxford and made
his first appearance in the fashionable world at London from whence
he came lately to Bath where he has been exhibiting himself among the
bucks and gamesters of the place Eastgate followed him hither but he
should not have quitted him for a moment at his first emerging into
life He ought to have known he was a fantastic foolish fickle
fellow who would forget his collegeattachments the moment they ceased
appealing to his senses Tom met with a cold reception from his old
friend and was moreover informed that he had promised the living to
another man who had a vote in the county where he proposed to offer
himself a candidate at the next general election He now remembered
nothing of Eastgate but the freedoms he had used to take with him
while Tom had quietly stood his butt with an eye to the benefice and
those freedoms he began to repeat in commonplace sarcasms on his person
and his cloth which he uttered in the public coffeehouse for the
entertainment of the company But he was egregiously mistaken in
giving his own wit credit for that tameness of Eastgate which had been
entirely owing to prudential considerations These being now removed
he retorted his repartee with interest and found no great difficulty in
turning the laugh upon the aggressor who losing his temper called him
names and asked If he knew whom he talked to After much altercation
Prankley shaking his cane bid him hold his tongue otherwise he could
dust his cassock for him I have no pretensions to such a valet said
Tom but if you should do me that office and overheat yourself I have
here a good oaken towel at your service

Prankley was equally incensed and confounded at this reply After a
moments pause he took him aside towards die window and pointing to
the clump of firs on Clerkendown asked in a whisper if he had
spirit enough to meet him there with a case of pistols at six oclock
tomorrow morning Eastgate answered in the affirmative and with a
steady countenance assured him he would not fail to give him the
rendezvous at the hour he mentioned So saying he retired and the
challenger stayed some time in manifest agitation In the morning
Eastgate who knew his man and had taken his resolution went to
Prankleys lodgings and roused him by five oclock

The squire in all probability cursed his punctuality in his heart but
he affected to talk big and having prepared his artillery overnight
they crossed the water at the end of the South Parade In their progress
up the hill Prankley often eyed the parson in hopes of perceiving
some reluctance in his countenance but as no such marks appeared he
attempted to intimidate him by word of mouth If these flints do their
office said he Ill do thy business in a few minutes I desire you
will do your best replied the other for my part I come not here to
trifle Our lives are in the hands of God and one of us already totters
on the brink of eternity This remark seemed to make some impression
upon the squire who changed countenance and with a faultering accent
observed That it ill became a clergyman to be concerned in quarrels
and bloodshedYour insolence to me said Eastgate I should have bore
with patience had not you cast the most infamous reflections upon my
order the honour of which I think myself in duty bound to maintain
even at the expence of my hearts blood and surely it can be no crime
to put out of the world a profligate wretch without any sense of
principle morality or religionThou mayst take away my life cried
Prankley in great perturbation but dont go to murder my character
What hast got no conscience My conscience is perfectly quiet
replied the other and now Sir we are upon the spotTake your
ground as near as you please prime your pistol and the Lord of his
infinite mercy have compassion upon your miserable soul

This ejaculation he pronounced in a loud solemn tone with his hat off
and his eyes lifted up then drawing a large horsepistol he presented
and put himself in a posture of action Prankley took his distance and
endeavoured to prime but his hand shook with such violence that he
found this operation impracticableHis antagonist seeing how it was
with him offered his assistance and advanced for that purpose when
the poor squire exceedingly alarmed at what he had heard and seen
desired the action might be deferred till next day as he had not
settled his affairs I hant made my will said he my sisters are
not provided for and I just now recollect an old promise which my
conscience tells me I ought to performIll first convince thee
that Im not a wretch without principle and then thou shalt have an
opportunity to take my life which thou seemst to thirst after so
eagerly

Eastgate understood the hint and told him that one day should break no
squares adding God forbid that I should be the means of hindering you
from acting the part of an honest man and a dutiful brotherBy virtue
of this cessation they returned peaceably together Prankley forthwith
made out the presentation of the living and delivered it to Eastgate
telling him at the same time he had now settled his affairs and was
ready to attend him to the Firgrove but Tom declared he could not
think of lifting his hand against the life of so great a benefactorHe
did more when they next met at the coffeehouse he asked pardon of Mr
Prankley if in his passion he had said any thing to give him offence
and the squire was so gracious as to forgive him with a cordial shake of
the hand declaring that he did not like to be at variance with an old
college companionNext day however he left Bath abruptly and then
Eastgate told me all these particulars not a little pleased with the
effects of his own sagacity by which he has secured a living worth
160l per annum

Of my uncle I have nothing at present to say but that we set out
tomorrow for London en famille He and the ladies with the maid and
Chowder in a coach I and the manservant ahorseback The particulars
of our journey you shall have in my next provided no accident happens
to prevent

Yours ever J MELFORD BATH May 17




To Dr LEWIS

DEAR DICK

I shall tomorrow set out for London where I have bespoke lodgings at
Mrs Nortons in Goldensquare Although I am no admirer of Bath I shall
leave it with regret because I must part with some old friends
whom in all probability I shall never see again In the course of
coffeehouse conversation I had often heard very extraordinary encomiums
passed on the performances of Mr T a gentleman residing in this
place who paints landscapes for his amusement As I have no great
confidence in the taste and judgment of coffeehouse connoisseurs and
never received much pleasure from this branch of the art those general
praises made no impression at all on my curiosity but at the request
of a particular friend I went yesterday to see the pieces which had
been so warmly commendedI must own I am no judge of painting though
very fond of pictures I dont imagine that my senses would play me so
false as to betray me into admiration of any thing that was very bad
but true it is I have often overlooked capital beauties in pieces of
extraordinary meritIf I am not totally devoid of taste however this
young gentleman of Bath is the best landscapepainter now living I was
struck with his performances in such a manner as I had never been
by painting before His trees not only have a richness of foliage
and warmth of colouring which delights the view but also a certain
magnificence in the disposition and spirit in the expression which
I cannot describe His management of the chiaro oscuro or light and
shadow especially gleams of sunshine is altogether wonderful both in
the contrivance and execution and he is so happy in his perspective
and marking his distances at sea by a progressive series of ships
vessels capes and promontories that I could not help thinking I had
a distant view of thirty leagues upon the background of the picture If
there is any taste for ingenuity left in a degenerate age fast sinking
into barbarism this artist I apprehend will make a capital figure as
soon as his works are known

Two days ago I was favoured with a visit by Mr Fitzowen who with
great formality solicited my vote and interest at the general election
I ought not to have been shocked at the confidence of this man though
it was remarkable considering what had passed between him and me on a
former occasionThese visits are mere matter of form which a candidate
makes to every elector even to those who he knows are engaged in
the interest of his competitor lest he should expose himself to the
imputation of pride at a time when it is expected he should appear
humble Indeed I know nothing so abject as the behaviour of a
man canvassing for a seat in parliamentThis mean prostration to
boroughelectors especially has I imagine contributed in a great
measure to raise that spirit of insolence among the vulgar which like
the devil will be found very difficult to lay Be that as it may I was
in some confusion at the effrontery of Fitzowen but I soon recollected
myself and told him I had not yet determined for whom I should give my
vote nor whether I should give it for anyThe truth is I look upon
both candidates in the same light and should think myself a traitor to
the constitution of my country if I voted for either If every elector
would bring the same consideration home to his conscience we should not
have such reason to exclaim against the venality of pts But we all
are a pack of venal and corrupted rascals so lost to all sense of
honesty and all tenderness of character that in a little time I am
fully persuaded nothing will be infamous but virtue and publicspirit

G H who is really an enthusiast in patriotism and represented the
capital in several successive parliaments declared to me tother day
with the tears in his eyes that he had lived above thirty years in the
city of London and dealt in the way of commerce with all the citizens
of note in their turns but that as he should answer to God he had
never in the whole course of his life found above three or four
whom he could call thoroughly honest a declaration which was rather
mortifying than surprising to me who have found so few men of worth
in the course of my acquaintance that they serve only as exceptions
which in the grammarians phrase confirm and prove a general canonI
know you will say G H saw imperfectly through the mist of prejudice
and I am rankled by the spleenPerhaps you are partly in the right
for I have perceived that my opinion of mankind like mercury in the
thermometer rises and falls according to the variations of the weather

Pray settle accompts with Barnes take what money of mine is in his
hands and give him acquittance If you think Davis has stock or credit
enough to do justice to the farm give him a discharge for the rent that
is due this will animate his industry for I know that nothing is so
discouraging to a farmer as the thoughts of being in arrears with his
landlord He becomes dispirited and neglects his labour and so the
farm goes to wreck Tabby has been clamouring for some days about the
lambs skin which Williams the hind begged of me when he was last at
Bath Prithee take it back paying the fellow the full value of it that
I may have some peace in my own house and let him keep his own counsel
if he means to keep his placeO I shall never presume to despise or
censure any poor man for suffering himself to be henpecked conscious
how I myself am obliged to truckle to a domestic demon even though
blessed be God she is not yoked with me for life in the matrimonial
waggonShe has quarrelled with the servants of the house about vails
and such intolerable scolding ensued on both sides that I have been
fain to appease the cook and chambermaid by stealth Cant you find some
poor gentleman of Wales to take this precious commodity off the hands

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR PHILLIPS

Without waiting for your answer to my last I proceed to give you an
account of our journey to London which has not been wholly barren of
adventure Tuesday last the squire took his place in a hired coach and
four accompanied by his sister and mine and Mrs Tabbys maid Winifrid
Jenkins whose province it was to support Chowder on a cushion in
her lap I could scarce refrain from laughing when I looked into the
vehicle and saw that animal sitting opposite to my uncle like any
other passenger The squire ashamed of his situation blushed to the
eyes and calling to the postilions to drive on pulled the glass up in
my face I and his servant John Thomas attended them on horseback

Nothing worth mentioning occurred till we arrived on the edge of
Marlborough Downs There one of the four horses fell in going down
hill at a round trot and the postilion behind endeavouring to stop
the carriage pulled it on one side into a deep rut where it was fairly
overturned I had rode on about two hundred yards before but hearing
a loud scream galloped back and dismounted to give what assistance
was in my power When I looked into the coach I could see nothing
distinctly but the nether end of Jenkins who was kicking her heels and
squalling with great vociferation All of a sudden my uncle thrust
up his bare pate and bolted through the window as nimble as a
grasshopper having made use of poor Wins posteriors as a step to rise
in his ascentThe man who had likewise quitted his horse dragged this
forlorn damsel more dead than alive through the same opening Then
Mr Bramble pulling the door off its hinges with a jerk laid hold
on Liddys arm and brought her to the light very much frighted but
little hurt It fell to my share to deliver our aunt Tabitha who had
lost her cap in the struggle and being rather more than half frantic
with rage and terror was no bad representation of one of the sister
Furies that guard the gates of hellShe expressed no sort of concern
for her brother who ran about in the cold without his periwig and
worked with the most astonishing agility in helping to disentangle
the horses from the carriage but she cried in a tone of distraction
Chowder Chowder my dear Chowder my poor Chowder is certainly
killed

This was not the caseChowder after having tore my uncles leg in the
confusion of the fall had retreated under the scat and from thence the
footman drew him by the neck for which good office he bit his fingers
to the bone The fellow who is naturally surly was so provoked at this
assault that he saluted his ribs with a hearty kick exclaiming Damn
the nasty son of a bitch and them he belongs to A benediction
which was by no means lost upon the implacable virago his mistressHer
brother however prevailed upon her to retire into a peasants house
near the scene of action where his head and hers were covered and poor
Jenkins had a fit Our next care was to apply some sticking plaister to
the wound in his leg which exhibited the impression of Chowders teeth
but he never opened his lips against the delinquentMrs Tabby alarmed
at this scene You say nothing Matt cried she but I know your
mindI know the spite you have to that poor unfortunate animal I know
you intend to take his life away You are mistaken upon my honour
replied the squire with a sarcastic smile I should be incapable
of harbouring any such cruel design against an object so amiable and
inoffensive even if he had not the happiness to be your favourite

John Thomas was not so delicate The fellow whether really alarmed for
his life or instigated by the desire of revenge came in and bluntly
demanded that the dog should be put to death on the supposition that
if ever he should run mad hereafter he who had been bit by him would
be infectedMy uncle calmly argued upon the absurdity of his opinion
observing that he himself was in the same predicament and would
certainly take the precaution he proposed if he was not sure he ran no
risque of infection Nevertheless Thomas continued obstinate and at
length declared that if the dog was not shot immediately he himself
would be his executionerThis declaration opened the floodgates of
Tabbys eloquence which would have shamed the firstrate oratress of
Billingsgate The footman retorted in the same stile and the squire
dismissed him from his service after having prevented me from giving
him a good horsewhipping for his insolence

The coach being adjusted another difficulty occurredMrs Tabitha
absolutely refused to enter it again unless another driver could
be found to take the place of the postilion who she affirmed had
overturned the carriage from malice aforethoughtAfter much dispute
the man resigned his place to a shabby country fellow who undertook to
go as far as Marlborough where they could be better provided and at
that place we arrived about one Oclock without farther impediment Mrs
Bramble however found new matter of offence which indeed she has a
particular genius for extracting at will from almost every incident in
life We had scarce entered the room at Marlborough where we stayed to
dine when she exhibited a formal complaint against the poor fellow who
had superseded the postilion She said he was such a beggarly rascal
that he had neer a shirt to his back and had the impudence to shock
her sight by shewing his bare posteriors for which act of indelicacy
he deserved to be set in the stocks Mrs Winifred Jenkins confirmed the
assertion with respect to his nakedness observing at the same time
that he had a skin as fair as alabaster

This is a heinous offence indeed cried my uncle let us hear what the
fellow has to say in his own vindication He was accordingly summoned
and made his appearance which was equally queer and pathetic He seemed
to be about twenty years of age of a middling size with bandy legs
stooping shoulders high forehead sandy locks pinking eyes flat nose
and long chinbut his complexion was of a sickly yellow his looks
denoted famine and the rags that he wore could hardly conceal
what decency requires to be coveredMy uncle having surveyed him
attentively said with an ironical expression in his countenance Ant
you ashamed fellow to ride postilion without a shirt to cover your
backside from the view of the ladies in the coach Yes I am an
please your noble honour answered the man but necessity has no law
as the saying isAnd more than that it was an accident My breeches
cracked behind after I had got into the saddle Youre an impudent
varlet cried Mrs Tabby for presuming to ride before persons of fashion
without a shirtI am so an please your worthy ladyship said he
but I am a poor Wiltshire ladI hant a shirt in the world that I can
call my own nor a rag of clothes and please your ladyship but what
you seeI have no friend nor relation upon earth to help me outI
have had the fever and ague these six months and spent all I had in the
world upon doctors and to keep soul and body together and saving
your ladyships good presence I hant broke bread these four and twenty
hours

Mrs Bramble turning from him said she had never seen such a filthy
tatterdemalion and bid him begone observing that he would fill the
room full of verminHer brother darted a significant glance at her as
she retired with Liddy into another apartment and then asked the man if
he was known to any person in MarlboroughWhen he answered that
the landlord of the inn had known him from his infancy mine host was
immediately called and being interrogated on the subject declared that
the young fellows name was Humphry Clinker That he had been a love
begotten babe brought up in the workhouse and put out apprentice by
the parish to a country blacksmith who died before the boys time was
out that he had for some time worked under his ostler as a helper and
extra postilion till he was taken ill of the ague which disabled him
from getting his bread that having sold or pawned every thing he had
in the world for his cure and subsistence he became so miserable and
shabby that he disgraced the stable and was dismissed but that
he never heard any thing to the prejudice of his character in other
respects So that the fellow being sick and destitute said my uncle
you turned him out to die in the streets I pay the poors rate
replied the other and I have no right to maintain idle vagrants
either in sickness or health besides such a miserable object would
have brought a discredit upon my house

You perceive said the squire turning to me our landlord is a
Christian of bowelsWho shall presume to censure the morals of the age
when the very publicans exhibit such examples of humanityHeark ye
Clinker you are a most notorious offenderYou stand convicted of
sickness hunger wretchedness and wantBut as it does not belong to
me to punish criminals I will only take upon me the task of giving you
a word of advice Get a shirt with all convenient dispatch that your
nakedness may not henceforward give offence to travelling gentlewomen
especially maidens in years

So saying he put a guinea into the hand of the poor fellow who stood
staring at him in silence with his mouth wide open till the landlord
pushed him out of the room

In the afternoon as our aunt stept into the coach she observed with
some marks of satisfaction that the postilion who rode next to
her was not a shabby wretch like the ragamuffin who had them into
Marlborough Indeed the difference was very conspicuous this was a
smart fellow with a narrow brimmed hat with gold cording a cut bob
a decent blue jacket leatherbreaches and a clean linen shirt puffed
above the waistband When we arrived at the Castle on Spinhill where
we lay this new postilion was remarkably assiduous in bringing in the
loose parcels and at length displayed the individual countenance
of Humphry Clinker who had metamorphosed himself in this manner by
relieving from pawn part of his own clothes with the money he had
received from Mr Bramble

Howsoever pleased the rest of the company were with such a favourable
change in the appearance of this poor creature it soured on the
stomach of Mrs Tabby who had not yet digested the affront of his naked
skinShe tossed her nose in disdain saying she supposed her brother
had taken him into favour because he had insulted her with his
obscenity that a fool and his money were soon parted but that if Matt
intended to take the fellow with him to London she would not go a foot
further that wayMy uncle said nothing with his tongue though his
looks were sufficiently expressive and next morning Clinker did not
appear so that we proceeded without further altercation to Salthill
where we proposed to dineThere the first person that came to the
side of the coach and began to adjust the footboard was no other than
Humphry ClinkerWhen I handed out Mrs Bramble she eyed him with a
furious look and passed into the houseMy uncle was embarrassed and
asked him peevishly what had brought him hither The fellow said his
honour had been so good to him that he had not the heart to part with
him that he would follow him to the worlds end and serve him all the
days of his life without fee or reward

Mr Bramble did not know whether to chide or laugh at this
declarationHe foresaw much contradiction on the side of Tabby and
on the other hand he could not but be pleased with the gratitude of
Clinker as well as with the simplicity of his characterSuppose I
was inclined to take you into my service said he what are your
qualifications what are you good for An please your honour answered
this original I can read and write and do the business of the stable
indifferent wellI can dress a horse and shoe him and bleed and rowel
him and as for the practice of sowgelding I wont turn my back on
eer a he in the county of WiltsThen I can make hogs puddings and
hobnails mend kettles and tin saucepansHere uncle burst out
alaughing and inquired what other accomplishments he was master ofI
know something of singlestick and psalmody proceeded Clinker I can
play upon the jewsharp sing Blackeyd Susan ArthuroBradley and
divers other songs I can dance a Welsh jig and Nancy Dawson wrestle a
fall with any lad of my inches when Im in heart and under correction
I can find a hare when your honour wants a bit of game Foregad thou
are a complete fellow cried my uncle still laughing I have a good
mind to take thee into my familyPrithee go and try if thou canst
make peace with my sisterThou hast given her much offence by shewing
her thy naked tail

Clinker accordingly followed us into the room cap in hand where
addressing himself to Mrs Tabitha May it please your ladyships
worship cried he to pardon and forgive my offences and with Gods
assistance I shall take care that my tail shall never rise up in
judgment against me to offend your ladyship again Do pray good
sweet beautiful lady take compassion on a poor sinnerGod bless your
noble countenance I am sure you are too handsome and generous to bear
maliceI will serve you on my bended knees by night and by day by
land and by water and all for the love and pleasure of serving such an
excellent lady

This compliment and humiliation had some effect upon Tabby but she made
no reply and Clinker taking silence for consent gave his attendance
at dinner The fellows natural aukwardness and the flutter of his
spirits were productive of repeated blunders in the course of his
attendanceAt length he spilt part of a custard upon her right
shoulder and starting back trod upon Chowder who set up a dismal
howlPoor Humphry was so disconcerted at this double mistake that he
dropt the china dish which broke into a thousand pieces then falling
down upon his knees remained in that posture gaping with a most
ludicrous aspect of distress Mrs Bramble flew to the dog and
snatching him in her arms presented him to her brother saying This is
all a concerted scheme against this unfortunate animal whose only crime
is its regard for meHere it is kill it at once and then youll be
satisfied

Clinker hearing these words and taking them in the literal
acceptation got up in some hurry and seizing a knife from the
sideboard cried Not here an please your ladyshipIt will daub the
roomGive him to me and Ill carry him to the ditch by the roadside
To this proposal he received no other answer than a hearty box on the
ear that made him stagger to the other side of the room What said
she to her brother am I to be affronted by every mangy hound that you
pick up on the highway I insist upon your sending this rascallion about
his business immediately For Gods sake sister compose yourself
said my uncle and consider that the poor fellow is innocent of any
intention to give you offence Innocent as the babe unborn cried
Humphry I see it plainly exclaimed this implacable maiden he acts
by your direction and you are resolved to support him in his impudence
This is a bad return for all the services I have done you for nursing
you in your sickness managing your family and keeping you from ruining
yourself by your own imprudenceBut now you shall part with that rascal
or me upon the spot without farther loss of time and the world shall
see whether you have more regard for your own flesh and blood or for a
beggarly foundling taken from the dunghill

Mr Brambles eyes began to glisten and his teeth to chatter If stated
fairly said he raising his voice the question is whether I have
spirit to shake off an intolerable yoke by one effort of resolution
or meanness enough to do an act of cruelty and injustice to gratify the
rancour of a capricious womanHeark ye Mrs Tabitha Bramble I will
now propose an alternative in my turn Either discard your fourfooted
favourite or give me leave to bid you eternally adieuFor I am
determined that he and I shall live no longer under the same roof
and to dinner with what appetite you mayThunderstruck at this
declaration she sat down in a corner and after a pause of some
minutes Sure I dont understand you Matt said she And yet I
spoke in plain English answered the squire with a peremptory look
Sir resumed this virago effectually humbled it is your prerogative
to command and my duty to obey I cant dispose of the dog in this
place but if youll allow him to go in the coach to London I give you
my word he shall never trouble you again

Her brother entirely disarmed by this mild reply declared she could
ask him nothing in reason that he would refuse adding I hope sister
you have never found me deficient in natural affection

Mrs Tabitha immediately rose and throwing her arms about his neck
kissed him on the cheek he returned her embrace with great emotion
Liddy sobbed Win Jenkins cackled Chowder capered and Clinker skipped
about rubbing his hands for joy of this reconciliation

Concord being thus restored we finished our meal with comfort and
in the evening arrived at London without having met with any other
adventure My aunt seems to be much mended by the hint she received from
her brother She has been graciously pleased to remove her displeasure
from Clinker who is now retained as a footman and in a day or two
will make his appearance in a new suit of livery but as he is little
acquainted with London we have taken an occasional valet whom I intend
hereafter to hire as my own servant We lodge in Goldensquare at the
house of one Mrs Notion a decent sort of a woman who takes great pains
to make us all easy My uncle proposes to make a circuit of all the
remarkable scenes of this metropolis for the entertainment of his
pupils but as both you and I are already acquainted with most of those
he will visit and with some others he little dreams of I shall only
communicate what will be in some measure new to your observation
Remember me to our Jesuitical friends and believe me ever

Dear knight Yours affectionately J MELFORD LONDON May 24




To Dr LEWIS

DEAR DOCTOR

London is literally new to me new in its streets houses and even in
its situation as the Irishman said London is now gone out of town
What I left open fields producing hay and corn I now find covered with
streets and squares and palaces and churches I am credibly informed
that in the space of seven years eleven thousand new houses have been
built in one quarter of Westminster exclusive of what is daily added to
other parts of this unwieldy metropolis Pimlico and Knightsbridge are
now almost joined to Chelsea and Kensington and if this infatuation
continues for half a century I suppose the whole county of Middlesex
will be covered with brick

It must be allowed indeed for the credit of the present age that
London and Westminster are much better paved and lighted than they
were formerly The new streets are spacious regular and airy and
the houses generally convenient The bridge at Blackfriars is a noble
monument of taste and publicspiritI wonder how they stumbled upon
a work of such magnificence and utility But notwithstanding these
improvements the capital is become an overgrown monster which like
a dropsical head will in time leave the body and extremities without
nourishment and support The absurdity will appear in its full force
when we consider that one sixth part of the natives of this whole
extensive kingdom is crowded within the bills of mortality What
wonder that our villages are depopulated and our farms in want of
daylabourers The abolition of small farms is but one cause of the
decrease of population Indeed the incredible increase of horses and
black cattle to answer the purposes of luxury requires a prodigious
quantity of hay and grass which are raised and managed without much
labour but a number of hands will always be wanted for the different
branches of agriculture whether the farms be large or small The tide
of luxury has swept all the inhabitants from the open countryThe
poorest squire as well as the richest peer must have his house in
town and make a figure with an extraordinary number of domestics The
ploughboys cowherds and lower hinds are debauched and seduced by
the appearance and discourse of those coxcombs in livery when they make
their summer excursions They desert their dirt and drudgery and swarm
up to London in hopes of getting into service where they can live
luxuriously and wear fine clothes without being obliged to work for
idleness is natural to manGreat numbers of these being disappointed
in their expectation become thieves and sharpers and London being
an immense wilderness in which there is neither watch nor ward of any
signification nor any order or police affords them lurkingplaces as
well as prey

There are many causes that contribute to the daily increase of this
enormous mass but they may be all resolved into the grand source of
luxury and corruptionAbout five and twenty years ago very few even
of the most opulent citizens of London kept any equipage or even any
servants in livery Their tables produced nothing but plain boiled and
roasted with a bottle of port and a tankard of beer At present every
trader in any degree of credit every broker and attorney maintains a
couple of footmen a coachman and postilion He has his townhouse
and his countryhouse his coach and his postchaise His wife and
daughters appear in the richest stuffs bespangled with diamonds They
frequent the court the opera the theatre and the masquerade They
hold assemblies at their own houses they make sumptuous entertainments
and treat with the richest wines of Bordeaux Burgundy and Champagne
The substantial tradesman who wont to pass his evenings at the
alehouse for fourpence halfpenny now spends three shillings at the
tavern while his wife keeps cardtables at home she must likewise have
fine clothes her chaise or pad with country lodgings and go three
times a week to public diversions Every clerk apprentice and even
waiter of tavern or coffeehouse maintains a gelding by himself or
in partnership and assumes the air and apparel of a petit maitreThe
gayest places of public entertainment are filled with fashionable
figures which upon inquiry will be found to be journeymen taylors
servingmen and abigails disguised like their betters

In short there is no distinction or subordination leftThe different
departments of life are jumbled togetherThe hodcarrier the low
mechanic the tapster the publican the shopkeeper the pettifogger
the citizen and courtier all tread upon the kibes of one another
actuated by the demons of profligacy and licentiousness they are
seen every where rambling riding rolling rushing justling mixing
bouncing cracking and crashing in one vile ferment of stupidity
and corruptionAll is tumult and hurry one would imagine they were
impelled by some disorder of the brain that will not suffer them to
be at rest The footpassengers run along as if they were pursued by
bailiffs The porters and chairmen trot with their burthens People who
keep their own equipages drive through the streets at full speed Even
citizens physicians and apothecaries glide in their chariots like
lightening The hackneycoachmen make their horses smoke and the
pavement shakes under them and I have actually seen a waggon pass
through Piccadilly at the handgallop In a word the whole nation seems
to be running out of their wits

The diversions of the times are not ill suited to the genius of this
incongruous monster called the public Give it noise confusion glare
and glitter it has no idea of elegance and proprietyWhat are the
amusements of Ranelagh One half of the company are following at the
others tails in an eternal circle like so many blind asses in an
olivemill where they can neither discourse distinguish nor be
distinguished while the other half are drinking hot water under the
denomination of tea till nine or ten oclock at night to keep them
awake for the rest of the evening As for the orchestra the vocal music
especially it is well for the performers that they cannot be heard
distinctly Vauxhall is a composition of baubles overcharged with
paltry ornaments ill conceived and poorly executed without any unity
of design or propriety of disposition It is an unnatural assembly of
objects fantastically illuminated in broken masses seemingly contrived
to dazzle the eyes and divert the imagination of the vulgarHere a
wooden lion there a stone statue in one place a range of things like
coffeehouse boxes covered atop in another a parcel of alehouse
benches in a third a puppetshow representation of a tin cascade in
a fourth a gloomy cave of a circular form like a sepulchral vault half
lighted in a fifth a scanty flip of grassplat that would not afford
pasture sufficient for an asss colt The walks which nature seems to
have intended for solitude shade and silence are filled with crowds
of noisy people sucking up the nocturnal rheums of an aguish climate
and through these gay scenes a few lamps glimmer like so many farthing
candles

When I see a number of well dressed people of both sexes sitting
on the covered benches exposed to the eyes of the mob and which is
worse to the cold raw nightair devouring sliced beef and swilling
port and punch and cyder I cant help compassionating their temerity
white I despise their want of taste and decorum but when they course
along those damp and gloomy walks or crowd together upon the wet
gravel without any other cover than the cope of Heaven listening to
a song which one half of them cannot possibly hear how can I help
supposing they are actually possessed by a spirit more absurd and
pernicious than any thing we meet with in the precincts of Bedlam In
all probability the proprietors of this and other public gardens of
inferior note in the skirts of the metropolis are in some shape
connected with the faculty of physic and the company of undertakers
for considering that eagerness in the pursuit of what is called
pleasure which now predominates through every rank and denomination
of life I am persuaded that more gouts rheumatisms catarrhs and
consumptions are caught in these nocturnal pastimes sub dio than from
all the risques and accidents to which a life of toil and danger is
exposed

These and other observations which I have made in this excursion will
shorten my stay at London and send me back with a double relish to my
solitude and mountains but I shall return by a different route from
that which brought me to town I have seen some old friends who
constantly resided in this virtuous metropolis but they are so
changed in manners and disposition that we hardly know or care for one
anotherIn our journey from Bath my sister Tabby provoked me into a
transport of passion during which like a man who has drank himself
potvaliant I talked to her in such a stile of authority and
resolution as produced a most blessed effect She and her dog have been
remarkably quiet and orderly ever since this expostulation How long
this agreeable calm will last Heaven above knowsI flatter myself the
exercise of travelling has been of service to my health a circumstance
which encourages me toproceed in my projected expedition to the North
But I must in the mean time for the benefit and amusement of my
pupils explore the depths of this chaos this misshapen and monstrous
capital without head or tail members or proportion

Thomas was so insolent to my sister on the road that I was obliged to
turn him off abruptly betwixt Chippenham and Marlborough where our
coach was overturned The fellow was always sullen and selfish but
if he should return to the country you may give him a character for
honesty and sobriety and provided he behaves with proper respect to
the family let him have a couple of guineas in the name of

Yours always MATT BRAMBLE LONDON May 20




To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS at Gloucester

MY DEAR LETTY

Inexpressible was the pleasure I received from yours of the 25th which
was last night put into my hands by Mrs Brentford the milliner from
GloucesterI rejoice to hear that my worthy governess is in good
health and still more that she no longer retains any displeasure
towards her poor Liddy I am sorry you have lost the society of the
agreeable Miss Vaughn but I hope you wont have cause much longer to
regret the departure of your school companions as I make no doubt but
your parents will in a little time bring you into the world where you
are so well qualified to make a distinguished figure When that is
the case I flatter myself you and I shall meet again and be happy
together and even improve the friendship which we contracted in our
tender years This at least I can promiseIt shall not be for the want
of my utmost endeavours if our intimacy does not continue for life

About five days ago we arrived in London after an easy journey from
Bath during which however we were overturned and met with some other
little incidents which had like to have occasioned a misunderstanding
betwixt my uncle and aunt but now thank God they are happily
reconciled we live in harmony together and every day make parties
to see the wonders of this vast metropolis which however I cannot
pretend to describe for I have not as yet seen one hundredth part of
its curiosities and I am quite in a maze of admiration

The cities of London and Westminster are spread out into an incredible
extent The streets squares rows lanes and alleys are innumerable
Palaces public buildings and churches rise in every quarter
and among these last St Pauls appears with the most astonishing
preeminence They say it is not so large as St Peters at Rome but
for my own part I can have no idea of any earthly temple more grand and
magnificent

But even these superb objects are not so striking as the crowds of
people that swarm in the streets I at first imagined that some
great assembly was just dismissed and wanted to stand aside till the
multitude should pass but this human tide continues to flow without
interruption or abatement from morn till night Then there is such
an infinity of gay equipages coaches chariots chaises and other
carriages continually rolling and shifting before your eyes that
ones head grows giddy looking at them and the imagination is quite
confounded with splendour and variety Nor is the prospect by water
less grand and astonishing than that by land you see three stupendous
bridges joining the opposite banks of a broad deep and rapid river
so vast so stately so elegant that they seem to be the work of the
giants betwixt them the whole surface of the Thames is covered with
small vessels barges boats and wherries passing to and fro and
below the three bridges such a prodigious forest of masts for miles
together that you would think all the ships in the universe were here
assembled All that you read of wealth and grandeur in the Arabian
Nights Entertainment and the Persian Tales concerning Bagdad
Diarbekir Damascus Ispahan and Samarkand is here realized

Ranelagh looks like the inchanted palace of a genie adorned with
the most exquisite performances of painting carving and gilding
enlightened with a thousand golden lamps that emulate the noonday
sun crowded with the great the rich the gay the happy and the fair
glittering with cloth of gold and silver lace embroidery and precious
stones While these exulting sons and daughters of felicity tread this
round of pleasure or regale in different parties and separate lodges
with fine imperial tea and other delicious refreshments their ears are
entertained with the most ravishing delights of music both instrumental
and vocal There I heard the famous Tenducci a thing from ItalyIt
looks for all the world like a man though they say it is not The
voice to be sure is neither mans nor womans but it is more
melodious than either and it warbled so divinely that while I
listened I really thought myself in paradise

At nine oclock in a charming moonlight evening we embarked at
Ranelagh for Vauxhall in a wherry so light and slender that we looked
like so many fairies sailing in a nutshell My uncle being apprehensive
of catching cold upon the water went round in the coach and my aunt
would have accompanied him but he would not suffer me to go by water if
she went by land and therefore she favoured us with her company as she
perceived I had a curiosity to make this agreeable voyageAfter all
the vessel was sufficiently loaded for besides the waterman there
was my brother Jery and a friend of his one Mr Barton a country
gentleman of a good fortune who had dined at our houseThe pleasure
of this little excursion was however damped by my being sadly
frighted at our landing where there was a terrible confusion of
wherries and a crowd of people bawling and swearing and quarrelling
nay a parcel of uglylooking fellows came running into the water and
laid hold of our boat with great violence to pull it ashore nor would
they quit their hold till my brother struck one of them over the head
with his cane But this flutter was fully recompensed by the pleasures
of Vauxhall which I no sooner entered than I was dazzled and
confounded with the variety of beauties that rushed all at once upon my
eye Image to yourself my dear Letty a spacious garden part laid out
in delightful walks bounded with high hedges and trees and paved with
gravel part exhibiting a wonderful assemblage of the most picturesque
and striking objects pavilions lodges groves grottoes lawns
temples and cascades porticoes colonades and rotundos adorned with
pillars statues and painting the whole illuminated with an infinite
number of lamps disposed in different figures of suns stars and
constellations the place crowded with the gayest company ranging
through those blissful shades or supping in different lodges on cold
collations enlivened with mirth freedom and good humour and animated
by an excellent band of music Among the vocal performers I had the
happiness to hear the celebrated Mrs whose voice was loud and shrill
that it made my head ake through excess of pleasure

In about half an hour after we arrived we were joined by my uncle who
did not seem to relish the place People of experience and infirmity my
dear Letty see with very different eyes from those that such as you and
I make use ofOur evenings entertainment was interrupted by an unlucky
accident In one of the remotest walks we were surprised with a sudden
shower that set the whole company arunning and drove us in heaps
one upon another into the rotunda where my uncle finding himself wet
began to be very peevish and urgent to be gone My brother went to look
for the coach and found it with much difficulty but as it could
not hold us all Mr Barton stayed behind It was some time before
the carriage could be brought up to the gate in the confusion
notwithstanding the utmost endeavours of our new footman Humphry
Clinker who lost his scratch periwig and got a broken head in the
scuffle The moment we were seated my aunt pulled off my uncles shoes
and carefully wrapped his poor feet in her capuchin then she gave him
a mouthful of cordial which she always keeps in her pocket and his
clothes were shifted as soon as we arrived at lodgings so that blessed
be God he escaped a severe cold of which he was in great terror

As for Mr Barton I must tell you in confidence he was a little
particular but perhaps I mistake his complaisance and I wish I may
for his sakeYou know the condition of my poor heart which in spite
of hard usageAnd yet I ought not to complain nor will I till farther
information

Besides Ranelagh and Vauxhall I have been at Mrs Cornelys assembly
which for the rooms the company the dresses and decorations
surpasses all description but as I have no great turn for card playing
I have not yet entered thoroughly into the spirit of the place indeed I
am still such a country hoyden that I could hardly find patience to be
put in a condition to appear yet as I was not above six hours under
the hands of the hairdresser who stuffed my head with as much black
wool as would have made a quilted petticoat and after all it was the
smallest head in the assembly except my auntsShe to be sure was
so particular with her rumpt gown and petticoat her scanty curls her
lappethead deep triple ruffles and high stays that every body looked
at her with surprise some whispered and some tittered and lady
Griskin by whom we were introduced flatly told her she was twenty
good years behind the fashion

Lady Griskin is a person of fashion to whom we have the honour to be
related She keeps a small rout at her own house never exceeding ten
or a dozen cardtables but these are frequented by the best company in
townShe has been so obliging as to introduce my aunt and me to some of
her particular friends of quality who treat us with the most familiar
goodhumour we have once dined with her and she takes the trouble
to direct us in all our motions I am so happy as to have gained her
goodwill to such a degree that she sometimes adjusts my cap with her
own hands and she has given me a kind invitation to stay with her all
the winter This however has been cruelly declined by my uncle who
seems to be I know not how prejudiced against the good lady for
whenever my aunt happens to speak in her commendation I observe that he
makes wry faces though he says nothingPerhaps indeed these grimaces
may be the effect of pain arising from the gout and rheumatism with
which he is sadly distressedTo me however he is always goodnatured
and generous even beyond my wish Since we came hither he has made
me a present of a suit of clothes with trimmings and laces which cost
more money than I shall mention and Jery at his desire has given me
my mothers diamond crops which are ordered to be set anew so that it
wont be his fault if I do not glitter among the stars of the fourth or
fifth magnitude I wish my weak head may not grow giddy in the midst
of all this gallantry and dissipation though as yet I can safely
declare I could gladly give up all these tumultuous pleasures for
country solitude and a happy retreat with those we love among whom my
dear Willis will always possess the first place in the breast of her

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR PHILLIPS

I send you this letter franked by our old friend Barton who is as much
altered as it was possible for a man of his kidney to be Instead of
the careless indolent sloven we knew at Oxford I found him a busy
talkative politician a petitmaitre in his dress and a ceremonious
courtier in his manners He has not gall enough in his constitution
to be enflamed with the rancour of party so as to deal in scurrilous
invectives but since he obtained a place he is become a warm partizan
of the ministry and sees every thing through such an exaggerating
medium as to me who am happily of no party is altogether
incomprehensibleWithout all doubt the fumes of faction not only
disturb the faculty of reason but also pervert the organs of sense and
I would lay a hundred guineas to ten that if Barton on one side and
the most conscientious patriot in the opposition on the other were to
draw upon honour the picture of the king or ministers you and I
who are still uninfected and unbiased would find both painters equally
distant from the truth One thing however must be allowed for the
honour of Barton he never breaks out into illiberal abuse far less
endeavours by infamous calumnies to blast the moral character of any
individual on the other side

Ever since we came hither he has been remarkably assiduous in his
attention to our family an attention which in a man of his indolence
and avocations I should have thought altogether odd and even
unnatural had not I perceived that my sister Liddy had made some
impression upon his heart I cannot say that I have any objection to
his trying his fortune in this pursuit if an opulent estate and a great
flock of goodnature are sufficient qualifications in a husband to
render the marriagestate happy for life she may be happy with Barton
but I imagine there is something else required to engage and secure
the affection of a woman of sense and delicacy something which nature
has denied our friendLiddy seems to be of the same opinion When
he addresses himself to her in discourse she seems to listen with
reluctance and industriously avoids all particular communication but
in proportion to her coyness our aunt is coming Mrs Tabitha goes more
than half way to meet his advances she mistakes or affects to mistake
the meaning of his courtesy which is rather formal and fulsome she
returns his compliments with hyperbolical interest she persecutes
him with her civilities at table she appeals to him for ever in
conversation she sighs and flirts and ogles and by her hideous
affectation and impertinence drives the poor courtier to the very
extremity of his complaisance in short she seems to have undertaken
the siege of Bartons heart and carries on her approaches in such a
desperate manner that I dont know whether he will not be obliged to
capitulate In the mean time his aversion to this inamorata struggling
with his acquired affability and his natural fear of giving offence
throws him into a kind of distress which is extremely ridiculous

Two days ago he persuaded my uncle and me to accompany him to St
Jamess where he undertook to make us acquainted with the persons
of all the great men in the kingdom and indeed there was a great
assemblage of distinguished characters for it was a high festival at
court Our conductor performed his promise with great punctuality
He pointed out almost every individual of both sexes and generally
introduced them to our notice with a flourish of panegyrickSeeing the
king approach There comes said he the most amiable sovereign
that ever swayed the sceptre of England the delicioe humani generis
Augustus in patronizing merit Titus Vespasian in generosity Trajan
in beneficence and Marcus Aurelius in philosophy A very honest kind
hearted gentleman added my uncle hes too good for the times A king
of England should have a spice of the devil in his composition Barton
then turning to the duke of Cumberland proceededYou know the
duke that illustrious hero who trode rebellion under his feet and
secured us in possession of every thing we ought to hold dear as
English men and Christians Mark what an eye how penetrating yet
pacific what dignity in his mien what humanity in his aspectEven
malice must own that he is one of the greatest officers in
Christendom I think he is said Mr Bramble but who are these young
gentlemen that stand beside him Those cried our friend those are
his royal nephews the princes of the blood Sweet young princes the
sacred pledges of the Protestant line so spirited so sensible
so princelyYes very sensible very spirited said my uncle
interrupting him but see the queen ha theres the queenTheres the
queen let me seeLet me seeWhere are my glasses ha theres meaning
in that eyeTheres sentimentTheres expressionWell Mr Barton
what figure do you call next The next person he pointed out was the
favourite yearl who stood solitary by one of the windowsBehold
yon northern star said he shorn of his beamsWhat the Caledonian
luminary that lately blazed so bright in our hemisphere methinks at
present it glimmers through a fog like Saturn without his ring bleak
and dim and distantHa theres the other great phenomenon the grand
pensionary that weathercock of patriotism that veers about in every
point of the political compass and still feels the wind of popularity
in his tail He too like a portentous comet has risen again above the
courthorizon but how long he will continue to ascend it is not easy
to foretell considering his great eccentricityWho are those two
satellites that attend his motions When Barton told him their names
To their characters said Mr Bramble I am no stranger One of them
without a drop of red blood in his veins has a cold intoxicating vapour
in his head and rancour enough in his heart to inoculate and affect
a whole nation The other is I hear intended for a share in the
administration and the pensionary vouches for his being duly
qualifiedThe only instance I ever heard of his sagacity was his
deserting his former patron when he found him declining in power and
in disgrace with the people Without principle talent or intelligence
he is ungracious as a hog greedy as a vulture and thievish as a
jackdaw but it must be owned he is no hypocrite He pretends to no
virtue and takes no pains to disguise his characterHis ministry
will be attended with one advantage no man will be disappointed by his
breach of promise as no mortal ever trusted to his word I wonder how
lordfirst discovered this happy genius and for what purpose lordhas
now adopted him but one would think that as amber has a power to
attract dirt and straws and chaff a minister is endued with the same
kind of faculty to lick up every knave and blockhead in his wayHis
eulogium was interrupted by the arrival of the old duke of N who
squeezing into the circle with a busy face of importance thrust his
head into every countenance as if he had been in search of somebody to
whom he wanted to impart something of great consequenceMy uncle who
had been formerly known to him bowed as he passed and the duke seeing
himself saluted so respectfully by a welldressed person was not slow
in returning the courtesyHe even came up and taking him cordially by
the hand My dear friend Mr A said he I am rejoiced to see you
How long have you been come from abroadHow did you leave our good
friends the Dutch The king of Prussia dont think of another war
ahHes a great king a great conqueror a very great conqueror Your
Alexanders and Hannibals were nothing at all to him sirCorporals
drummers dross mere trashDamned trash hehHis grace being by
this time out of breath my uncle took the opportunity to tell him he
had not been out of England that his name was Bramble and that he had
the honour to sit in the last parliament but one of the late king as
representative for the borough of Dymkymraig Odso cried the duke I
remember you perfectly well my dear Mr BrambleYou was always a
good and loyal subjecta stanch friend to administrationI made your
brother an Irish bishopPardon me my lord said the squire I once
had a brother but he was a captain in the armyHa said his
grace he was soHe was indeed But who was the Bishop then Bishop
BlackberrySure it was bishop Blackberry Perhaps some relation of
yoursVery likely my lord replied my uncle the Blackberry is the
fruit of the BrambleBut I believe the bishop is not a berry of our
bushNo more he isNo more he is ha ha ha exclaimed the duke
there you gave me a scratch good Mr Bramble ha ha haWell
I shall be glad to see you at Lincolns innfieldsYou know the
wayTimes are altered Though I have lost the power I retain the
inclinationYour very humble servant good Mr BlackberrySo saying
he shoved to another corner of the room What a fine old gentleman
cried Mr Barton what spirits what a memory He never forgets an old
friend He does me too much honour observed our squire to rank me
among the numberWhilst I sat in parliament I never voted with the
ministry but three times when my conscience told me they were in the
right however if he still keeps levee I will carry my nephew thither
that he may see and learn to avoid the scene for I think an English
gentleman never appears to such disadvantage as at the levee of a
ministerOf his grace I shall say nothing at present but that for
thirty years he was the constant and common butt of ridicule and
execration He was generally laughed at as an ape in politics whose
office and influence served only to render his folly the more notorious
and the opposition cursed him as the indefatigable drudge of a
firstmover who was justly stiled and stigmatized as the father of
corruption but this ridiculous ape this venal drudge no sooner lost
the places he was so ill qualified to fill and unfurled the banners of
faction than he was metamorphosed into a pattern of public virtue the
very people who reviled him before now extolled him to the skies as a
wise experienced statesman chief pillar of the Protestant succession
and corner stone of English liberty I should be glad to know how Mr
Barton reconciles these contradictions without obliging us to resign
all title to the privilege of common sense My dear sir answered
Barton I dont pretend to justify the extravagations of the multitude
who I suppose were as wild in their former censure as in the present
praise but I shall be very glad to attend you on Thursday next to his
graces levee where Im afraid we shall not be crowded with company
for you know theres a wide difference between his present office of
president of the council and his former post of first lord commissioner
of the treasury

This communicative friend having announced all the remarkable characters
of both sexes that appeared at court we resolved to adjourn and
retired At the foot of the staircase there was a crowd of lacqueys
and chairmen and in the midst of them stood Humphry Clinker exalted
upon a stool with his hat in one hand and a paper in the other in
the act of holding forth to the peopleBefore we could inquire into the
meaning of this exhibition he perceived his master thrust the paper
into his pocket descended from his elevation bolted through the crowd
and brought up the carriage to the gate

My uncle said nothing till we were seated when after having looked at
me earnestly for some time he burst out alaughing and asked if I knew
upon what subject Clinker was holding forth to the mobIf said he
the fellow is turned mountebank I must turn him out of my service
otherwise hell make Merry Andrews of us allI observed that in
all probability he had studied medicine under his master who was a
farrier

At dinner the squire asked him if he had ever practised physic Yes
and please your honour said he among brute beasts but I never meddle
with rational creatures I know not whether you rank in that class the
audience you was haranguing in the court at St Jamess but I should be
glad to know what kind of powders you was distributing and whether you
had a good saleSale sir cried Clinker I hope I shall never be
base enough to sell for gold and silver what freely comes of Gods
grace I distributed nothing an like your honour but a word of
advice to my fellows in servitude and sin Advice concerning what
Concerning profane swearing an please your honour so horrid and
shocking that it made my hair stand on end Nay if thou canst cure
them Of that disease I shall think thee a wonderful doctor indeed Why
not cure them my good master the hearts of those poor people are not
so stubborn as your honour seems to thinkMake them first sensible
that you have nothing in view but their good then they will listen with
patience and easily be convinced of the sin and folly of a practice
that affords neither profit nor pleasureAt this remark our uncle
changed colour and looked round the company conscious that his own
withers were not altogether unwrung But Clinker said he if you
should have eloquence enough to persuade the vulgar to resign those
tropes and figures of rhetoric there will be little or nothing left to
distinguish their conversation from that of their betters But then
your honour knows their conversation will be void of offence and at
the day of judgment there will be no distinction of persons

Humphry going down stairs to fetch up a bottle of wine my uncle
congratulated his sister upon having such a reformer in the family when
Mrs Tabitha declared he was a sober civilized fellow very respectful
and very industrious and she believed a good Christian into
the bargain One would think Clinker must really have some very
extraordinary talent to ingratiate himself in this manner with a
virago of her character so fortified against him with prejudice and
resentment but the truth is since the adventure of Salthill Mrs
Tabby seems to be entirely changed She has left off scolding the
servants an exercise which was grown habitual and even seemed
necessary to her constitution and is become so indifferent to Chowder
as to part with him in a present to lady Griskin who proposes to bring
the breed of him into fashion Her ladyship is the widow of Sir Timothy
Griskin a distant relation of our family She enjoys a jointure of five
hundred pounds ayear and makes shift to spend three times that sum
Her character before marriage was a little equivocal but at present she
lives in the bon ton keeps cardtables gives private suppers to select
friends and is visited by persons of the first fashionShe has been
remarkably civil to us all and cultivates my uncle with the most
particular regard but the more she strokes him the more his bristles
seem to riseTo her compliments he makes very laconic and dry
returnsTother day she sent us a pottle of fine strawberries which
he did not receive without signs of disgust muttering from the Aeneid
timeo Danaos et Dona ferentes She has twice called for Liddy of a
forenoon to take an airing in the coach but Mrs Tabby was always so
alert I suppose by his direction that she never could have the niece
without her aunts company I have endeavoured to sound Squaretoes on
this subject but he carefully avoids all explanation

I have now dear Phillips filled a whole sheet and if you have read it
to an end I dare say you are as tired as

Your humble servant J MELFORD LONDON June 2




To Dr LEWIS

Yes Doctor I have seen the British Museum which is a noble
collection and even stupendous if we consider it was made by a private
man a physician who was obliged to make his own for tune at the same
time but great as the collection is it would appear more striking if
it was arranged in one spacious saloon instead of being divided into
different apartments which it does not entirely fillI could wish the
series of medals was connected and the whole of the animal vegetable
and mineral kingdoms completed by adding to each at the public
expence those articles that are wanting It would likewise be a great
improvement with respect to the library if the deficiencies were made
up by purchasing all the books of character that are not to be found
already in the collectionThey might be classed in centuries according
to the dates of their publication and catalogues printed of them and
the manuscripts for the information of those that want to consult or
compile from such authorities I could also wish for the honour of the
nation that there was a complete apparatus for a course of mathematics
mechanics and experimental philosophy and a good salary settled upon
an able professor who should give regular lectures on these subjects

But this is all idle speculation which will never be reduced to
practiceConsidering the temper of the times it is a wonder to see any
institution whatsoever established for the benefit of the Public The
spirit of party is risen to a kind of phrenzy unknown to former ages
or rather degenerated to a total extinction of honesty and candourYou
know I have observed for some time that the public papers are become
the infamous vehicles of the most cruel and perfidious defamation every
rancorous knave every desperate incendiary that can afford to spend
half a crown or three shillings may skulk behind the press of a
newsmonger and have a stab at the first character in the kingdom
without running the least hazard of detection or punishment

I have made acquaintance with a Mr Barton whom Jery knew at Oxford
a good sort of a man though most ridiculously warped in his political
principles but his partiality is the less offensive as it never
appears in the stile of scurrility and abuse He is a member of
parliament and a retainer to the court and his whole conversation
turns upon the virtues and perfections of the ministers who are his
patrons Tother day when he was bedaubing one of those worthies
with the most fulsome praise I told him I had seen the same nobleman
characterised very differently in one of the dailypapers indeed so
stigmatized that if one half of what was said of him was true he
must be not only unfit to rule but even unfit to live that those
impeachments had been repeated again and again with the addition
of fresh matter and that as he had taken no steps towards his own
vindication I began to think there was some foundation for the charge
And pray Sir said Mr Barton what steps would you have him take
Suppose he should prosecute the publisher who screens the anonymous
accuser and bring him to the pillory for a libel this is so far from
being counted a punishment in terrorem that it will probably make his
fortune The multitude immediately take him into their protection as a
martyr to the cause of defamation which they have always espoused They
pay his fine they contribute to the increase of his stock his shop is
crowded with customers and the sale of his paper rises in proportion
to the scandal it contains All this time the prosecutor is inveighed
against as a tyrant and oppressor for having chosen to proceed by
the way of information which is deemed a grievance but if he lays an
action for damages he must prove the damage and I leave you to judge
whether a gentlemans character may not be brought into contempt and
all his views in life blasted by calumny without his being able to
specify the particulars of the damage he has sustained

This spirit of defamation is a kind of heresy that thrives under
persecution The liberty of the press is a term of great efficacy and
like that of the Protestant religion has often served the purposes of
seditionA minister therefore must arm himself with patience and
bear those attacks without repiningWhatever mischief they may do in
other respects they certainly contribute in one particular to the
advantages of government for those defamatory articles have multiplied
papers in such a manner and augmented their sale to such a degree that
the duty upon stamps and advertisements has made a very considerable
addition to the revenue Certain it is a gentlemans honour is a very
delicate subject to be handled by a jury composed of men who cannot
be supposed remarkable either for sentiment or impartialityIn such a
case indeed the defendant is tried not only by his peers but also
by his party and I really think that of all patriots he is the most
resolute who exposes himself to such detraction for the sake of his
countryIf from the ignorance or partiality of juries a gentleman can
have no redress from law for being defamed in a pamphlet or newspaper
I know but one other method of proceeding against the publisher which
is attended with some risque but has been practised successfully more
than once in my remembranceA regiment of horse was represented in
one of the newspapers as having misbehaved at Dettingen a captain
of that regiment broke the publishers bones telling him at the same
time if he went to law he should certainly have the like salutation
from every officer of the corps Governortook the same satisfaction on
the ribs of an author who traduced him by name in a periodical paperI
know a low fellow of the same class who being turned out of Venice for
his impudence and scurrility retired to Lugano a town of the Grisons
a free people God wot where he found a printing press from whence he
squirted his filth at some respectable characters in the republic which
he had been obliged to abandon Some of these finding him out of the
reach of legal chastisement employed certain useful instruments such
as may be found in all countries to give him the bastinado which
being repeated more than once effectually stopt the current of his
abuse

As for the liberty of the press like every other privilege it must be
restrained within certain bounds for if it is carried to a branch of
law religion and charity it becomes one of the greatest evils that
ever annoyed the community If the lowest ruffian may stab your good
name with impunity in England will you be so uncandid as to exclaim
against Italy for the practice of common assassination To what purpose
is our property secured if our moral character is left defenceless
People thus baited grow desperate and the despair of being able to
preserve ones character untainted by such vermin produces a total
neglect of fame so that one of the chief incitements to the practice of
virtue is effectually destroyed

Mr Bartons last consideration respecting the stampduty is equally
wise and laudable with another maxim which has been long adopted by our
financiers namely to connive at drunkenness riot and dissipation
because they inhance the receipt of the excise not reflecting that in
providing this temporary convenience they are destroying the morals
health and industry of the peopleNotwithstanding my contempt for
those who flatter a minister I think there is something still more
despicable in flattering a mob When I see a man of birth education
and fortune put himself on a level with the dregs of the people mingle
with low mechanics feed with them at the same board and drink with
them in the same cup flatter their prejudices harangue in praise of
their virtues expose themselves to the belchings of their beer the
fumes of their tobacco the grossness of their familiarity and the
impertinence of their conversation I cannot help despising him as
a man guilty of the vilest prostitution in order to effect a purpose
equally selfish and illiberal

I should renounce politics the more willingly if I could find other
topics of conversation discussed with more modesty and candour but the
daemon of party seems to have usurped every department of life Even
the world of literature and taste is divided into the most virulent
factions which revile decry and traduce the works of one another
Yesterday I went to return an afternoons visit to a gentleman of my
acquaintance at whose house I found one of the authors of the present
age who has written with some successAs I had read one or two of his
performances which gave me pleasure I was glad of this opportunity
to know his person but his discourse and deportment destroyed all the
impressions which his writings had made in his favour He took upon him
to decide dogmatically upon every subject without deigning to shew the
least cause for his differing from the general opinions of mankind
as if it had been our duty to acquiesce in the ipse dixit of this new
Pythagoras He rejudged the characters of all the principal authors who
had died within a century of the present time and in this revision
paid no sort of regard to the reputation they had acquiredMilton was
harsh and prosaic Dryden languid and verbose Butler and Swift
without humour Congreve without wit and Pope destitute of any sort of
poetical meritAs for his contemporaries he could not bear to hear
one of them mentioned with any degree of applauseThey were all dunces
pedants plagiaries quacks and impostors and you could not name a
single performance but what was tame stupid and insipid It must be
owned that this writer had nothing to charge his conscience with on
the side of flattery for I understand he was never known to praise one
line that was written even by those with whom he lived on terms of good
fellowship This arrogance and presumption in depreciating authors for
whose reputation the company may be interested is such an insult upon
the understanding as I could not bear without wincing

I desired to know his reasons for decrying some works which had
afforded me uncommon pleasure and as demonstration did not seem to be
his talent I dissented from his opinion with great freedom Having been
spoiled by the deference and humility of his hearers he did not bear
contradiction with much temper and the dispute might have grown warm
had it not been interrupted by the entrance of a rival bard at whose
appearance he always quits the placeThey are of different cabals and
have been at open war these twenty yearsIf the other was dogmatical
this genius was declamatory he did not discourse but harangue and his
orations were equally tedious and turgid He too pronounces ex cathedra
upon the characters of his contemporaries and though he scruples not to
deal out praise even lavishly to the lowest reptile in Grubstreet who
will either flatter him in private or mount the public rostrum as his
panegyrist he damns all the other writers of the age with the utmost
insolence and rancourOne is a blunderbuss as being a native of
Ireland another a halfstarved louse of literature from the banks
of the Tweed a third an ass because he enjoys a pension from the
government a fourth the very angel of dulness because he succeeded in
a species of writing in which this Aristarchus had failed a fifth who
presumed to make strictures upon one of his performances he holds as
a bug in criticism whose stench is more offensive than his stingIn
short except himself and his myrmidons there is not a man of genius
or learning in the three kingdoms As for the success of those who have
written without the pale of this confederacy he imputes it entirely to
want of taste in the public not considering that to the approbation of
that very tasteless public he himself owes all the consequence he has
in life

Those originals are not fit for conversation If they would maintain the
advantage they have gained by their writing they should never appear
but upon paperFor my part I am shocked to find a man have sublime
ideas in his head and nothing but illiberal sentiments in his
heartThe human soul will be generally found most defective in the
article of candourI am inclined to think no mind was ever wholly
exempt from envy which perhaps may have been implanted as an
instinct essential to our nature I am afraid we sometimes palliate
this vice under the spacious name of emulation I have known a person
remarkably generous humane moderate and apparently selfdenying
who could not hear even a friend commended without betraying marks of
uneasiness as if that commendation had implied an odious comparison
to his prejudice and every wreath of praise added to the others
character was a garland plucked from his own temples This is a
malignant species of jealousy of which I stand acquitted in my own
conscience

Whether it is a vice or an infirmity I leave you to inquire

There is another point which I would much rather see determined
whether the world was always as contemptible as it appears to me at
presentIf the morals of mankind have not contracted an extraordinary
degree of depravity within these thirty years then must I be infected
with the common vice of old men difficilis querulus laudator temporis
acti or which is more probable the impetuous pursuits and avocations
of youth have formerly hindered me from observing those rotten parts of
human nature which now appear so offensively to my observation

We have been at court and change and every where and every where we
find food for spleen and subject for ridiculeMy new servant
Humphry Clinker turns out a great original and Tabby is a changed
creatureShe has parted with Chowder and does nothing but smile like
Malvolio in the playIll be hanged if she is not acting a part which
is not natural to her disposition for some purpose which I have not yet
discovered

With respect to the characters of mankind my curiosity is quite
satisfied I have done with the science of men and must now endeavour
to amuse myself with the novelty of things I am at present by a
violent effort of the mind forced from my natural bias but this power
ceasing to act I shall return to my solitude with redoubled velocity
Every thing I see and hear and feel in this great reservoir of folly
knavery and sophistication contributes to inhance the value of a
country life in the sentiments of

Yours always MATT BRAMBLE LONDON June 2

DEAR MARY JONES

Lady Griskins botler Mr Crumb having got squire Barton to frank me
a kiver I would not neglect to let you know how it is with me and the
rest of the family

I could not rite by John Thomas for because he went away in a huff
at a minutes warning He and Chowder could not agree and so they fitt
upon the road and Chowder bitt his thumb and he swore he would do him
a mischief and he spoke saucy to mistress whereby the squire turned
him off in gudgeon and by Gods providence we picked up another
footman called Umphry Klinker a good sole as ever broke bread
which shews that a scalded cat may prove a good mouser and a hound be
staunch thof he has got narro hare on his buttocks but the proudest
nose may be brot to the grinestone by sickness and misfortunes

0 Molly what shall I say of London All the towns that ever I beheld
in my borndays are no more than Welsh barrows and crumlecks to this
wonderful sitty Even Bath itself is but a fillitch in the naam of
GodOne would think theres no end of the streets but the lands end
Then theres such a power of people going hurry skurry Such a racket
of coxes Such a noise and haliballoo So many strange sites to be
seen O gracious my poor Welsh brain has been spinning like a top ever
since I came hither And I have seen the Park and the paleass of Saint
Gimses and the kings and the queens magisterial pursing and the
sweet young princes and the hillyfents and pye bald ass and all the
rest of the royal family

Last week I went with mistress to the Tower to see the crowns and wild
beastis and there was a monstracious lion with teeth half a quarter
long and a gentleman bid me not go near him if I wasnt a maid being
as how he would roar and tear and play the dickensNow I had no mind
to go near him for I cannot abide such dangerous honeymils not Ibut
mistress would go and the beast kept such a roaring and bouncing
that I thot he would have broke his cage and devoured us all and the
gentleman tittered forsooth but Ill go to death upon it I will
that my lady is as good a firchin as the child unborn and therefore
either the gentleman told a fib or the lion oft to be set in the
stocks for bearing false witness agin his neighbour for the commandment
sayeth Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour

I was afterwards of a party at Sadlerswells where I saw such tumbling
and dancing upon ropes and wires that I was frightened and ready to
go into a fitI thot it was all inchantment and believing myself
bewitched began for to cryYou knows as how the witches in Wales fly
upon broomsticks but here was flying without any broomstick or thing
in the varsal world and firing of pistols in the air and blowing of
trumpets and swinging and rolling of wheelbarrows upon a wire God
bless us no thicker than a sewingthread that to be sure they must
deal with the devilA fine gentleman with a pigstail and a golden
sord by his side come to comfit me and offered for to treat me with
a pint of wind but I would not stay and so in going through the dark
passage he began to shew his cloven futt and went for to be rude my
fellowsarvant Umphry Klinker bid him be sivil and he gave the young
man a dowse in the chops but I fackins Mr Klinker want long in
his debtwith a good oaken sapling he dusted his doublet for all his
golden cheese toaster and fipping me under his arm carried me huom I
nose not how being I was in such a flustrationBut thank God Im
now vaned from all such vanities for what are all those rarities and
vagaries to the glory that shall be revealed hereafter O Molly let not
your poor heart be puffed up with vanity

I had almost forgot to tell you that I have had my hair cut and
pippered and singed and bolstered and buckled in the newest fashion
by a French freezerParley vow FranceyVee madmansellI now carries
my head higher than arrow private gentlewoman of Vales Last night
coming huom from the meeting I was taken by lamplight for an iminent
poulterers daughter a great beautyBut as I was saying this is all
vanity and vexation of spiritThe pleasures of London are no better
than sower whey and stale cyder when compared to the joys of the new
Gerusalem

Dear Mary Jones An please God when I return Ill bring you a new cap
with a turkeyshell coom and a pyehouse sermon that was preached in
the Tabernacle and I pray of all love you will mind your vriting
and your spilling for craving your pardon Molly it made me suet

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR WAT

I mentioned in my last my uncles design of going to the duke of Ns
levee which design has been executed accordingly His grace has been
so long accustomed to this kind of homage that though the place he now
fills does not imply the tenth part of the influence which he exerted
in his former office he has given his friends to understand that they
cannot oblige him in any thing more than in contributing to support
the shadow of that power which he no longer retains in substance and
therefore he has still public days on which they appear at his levee

My uncle and I went thither with Mr Barton who being one of the dukes
adherents undertook to be our introducerThe room was pretty well
filled with people in a great variety of dress but there was no more
than one gown and cassock though I was told his grace had while he was
minister preferred almost every individual that now filled the bench of
bishops in the house of lords but in all probability the gratitude of
the clergy is like their charity which shuns the lightMr Barton
was immediately accosted by a person well stricken in years tall and
rawboned with a hooknose and an arch leer that indicated at least
as much cunning as sagacity Our conductor saluted him by the name of
captain C and afterwards informed us he was a man of shrewd parts
whom the government occasionally employed in secret services But I have
had the history of him more at large from another quarter He had been
many years ago concerned in fraudulent practices as a merchant in
France and being convicted of some of them was sent to the gallies
from whence he was delivered by the interest of the late duke of Ormond
to whom he had recommended himself in letter as his namesake and
relationHe was in the sequel employed by our ministry as a spy
and in the war of 1740 traversed all Spain as well as France in the
disguise of a capuchin at the extreme hazard of his life in as much as
the court of Madrid had actually got scent of him and given orders to
apprehend him at St Sebastians from whence he had fortunately retired
but a few hours before the order arrived This and other hairbreadth
scapes he pleaded so effectually as a merit with the English ministry
that they allowed him a comfortable pension which he now enjoys in his
old ageHe has still access to all the ministers and is said to be
consulted by them on many subjects as a man of uncommon understanding
and great experienceHe is in fact a fellow of some parts and
invincible assurance and in his discourse he assumes such an air
of selfsufficiency as may very well impose upon some of the shallow
politicians who now labour at the helm of administration But if he is
not belied this is not the only imposture of which he is guiltyThey
say he is at bottom not only a Romancatholic but really a priest and
while he pretends to disclose to our statepilots all the springs that
move the cabinet of Versailles he is actually picking up intelligence
for the service of the French minister Be that as it may captain
C entered into conversation with us in the most familiar manner and
treated the dukes character without any ceremonyThis wiseacre said
he is still abed and I think the best thing he can do is to sleep
on till Christmas for when he gets up he does nothing but expose his
own follySince Grenville was turned out there has been no minister
in this nation worth the meal that whitened his periwigThey are so
ignorant they scarce know a crab from a cauliflower and then they
are such dunces that theres no making them comprehend the plainest
propositionIn the beginning of the war this poor halfwitted creature
told me in a great fright that thirty thousand French had marched
from Acadie to Cape BretonWhere did they find transports said I
Transports cried he I tell you they marched by landBy land to the
island of Cape Breton What is Cape Breton an island Certainly
Ha are you sure of that When I pointed it out in the map he
examined it earnestly with his spectacles then taking me in his arms
My dear C cried he you always bring us good newsEgad Ill go
directly and tell the king that Cape Breton is an island

He seemed disposed to entertain us with more anecdotes of this nature
at the expense of his grace when he was interrupted by the arrival
of the Algerine ambassador a venerable Turk with a long white beard
attended by his dragoman or interpreter and another officer of his
household who had got no stockings to his legsCaptain C immediately
spoke with an air of authority to a servant in waiting bidding him go
and tell the duke to rise as there was a great deal of company come
and among others the ambassador from Algiers Then turning to
us This poor Turk said he notwithstanding his grey beard is a
greenhornHe has been several years resident in London and still is
ignorant of our political revolutions This visit is intended for
the prime minister of England but youll see how this wise duke will
receive it as a mark of attachment to his own personCertain it is
the duke seemed eager to acknowledge the complimentA door opened
he suddenly bolted out with a shavingcloth under his chin his
face frothed up to the eyes with soap lather and running up to the
ambassador grinned hideous in his faceMy dear Mahomet said he God
love your long beard I hope the dey will make you a horsetail at the
next promotion ha ha ha Have but a moments patience and Ill send
to you in a twinklingSo saying he retired into his den leaving
the Turk in some confusion After a short pause however he said
something to his interpreter the meaning of which I had great
curiosity to know as he turned up his eyes while he spoke expressing
astonishment mixed with devotion We were gratified by means of the
communicative captain C who conversed with the dragoman as an old
acquaintance Ibrahim the ambassador who had mistaken his grace for
the ministers fool was no sooner undeceived by the interpreter than
he exclaimed to this effect Holy prophet I dont wonder that this
nation prospers seeing it is governed by the counsel of ideots a
series of men whom all good mussulmen revere as the organs of immediate
inspiration Ibrahim was favoured with a particular audience of short
duration after which the duke conducted him to the door and
then returned to diffuse his gracious looks among the crowd of his
worshippers

As Mr Barton advanced to present me to his grace it was my fortune to
attract his notice before I was announcedHe forthwith met me more
than half way and seizing me by the hand My dear Sir Francis cried
he this is so kindI vow to God I am so obligedSuch attention to
a poor broken minister WellPray when does your excellency set
sailFor Gods sake have a care of your health and cat stewed
prunes in the passage Next to your own precious health pray my dear
excellency take care of the Five NationsOur good friends the Five
Nations The Toryrories the Maccolmacks the Outotheways the
Crickets and the KickshawsLet em have plenty of blankets and
stinkubus and wampum and your excellency wont fail to scour
the kettle and boil the chain and bury the tree and plant the
hatchetHa ha ha When he had uttered this rhapsody with his usual
precipitation Mr Barton gave him to understand that I was neither Sir
Francis nor St Francis but simply Mr Melford nephew to Mr Bramble
who stepping forward made his bow at the same time Odso no more it
is Sir Francissaid this wise statesman Mr Melford Im glad to
see youI sent you an engineer to fortify your dockMr Brambleyour
servant Mr BrambleHow dye good Mr Bramble Your nephew is a pretty
young fellowFaith and troth a very pretty fellowHis father is
my old friendHow does he hold it Still troubled with that damned
disorder ha No my lord replied my uncle all his troubles are
overHe has been dead these fifteen years Dead howYes faith
now I remember he is dead sure enoughWell and howdoes the
young gentleman stand for Haverford West ora what dye My dear Mr
Milfordhaven Ill do you all the service in my power I hope I have some
credit leftMy uncle then gave him to understand that I was still a
minor and that we had no intention to trouble him at present for any
favour whatsoeverI came hither with my nephew added he to pay our
respects to your grace and I may venture to say that his views and
mine are at least as disinterested as those of any individual in this
assembly My dear Mr Brambleberry you do me infinite honourI shall
always rejoice to see you and your hopeful nephew Mr MilfordhavenMy
credit such as it is you may commandI wish we had more friends of
your kidney

Then turning to captain C Ha C said he what news C How
does the world wag ha The world wags much after the old fashion my
lord answered the captain the politicians of London and Westminster
have begun again to wag their tongues against your grace and your
shortlived popularity wags like a feather which the next puff of
antiministerial calumny will blow awayA pack of rascals cried the
dukeTories Jacobites rebels one half of them would wag their heels
at Tyburn if they had their desertsSo saying he wheeled about
and going round the levee spoke to every individual with the most
courteous familiarity but he scarce ever opened his mouth without
making some blunder in relation to the person or business of the party
with whom he conversed so that he really looked like a comedian hired
to burlesque the character of a ministerAt length a person of a very
prepossessing appearance coming in his grace ran up and hugging him
in his arms with the appellation of My dear Chs led him forthwith
into the inner apartment or Sanctum Sanctorum of this political temple
That said captain C is my friend C T almost the only man of
parts who has any concern in the present administrationIndeed he
would have no concern at all in the matter if the ministry did not find
it absolutely necessary to make use of his talents upon some particular
occasionsAs for the common business of the nation it is carried on in
a constant routine by the clerks of the different offices otherwise the
wheels of government would be wholly stopt amidst the abrupt succession
of ministers every one more ignorant than his predecessorI am
thinking what a fine hovel we should be in if all the clerks of the
treasury the secretaries of the waroffice and the admiralty should
take it in their heads to throw up their places in imitation of the
great pensionerBut to return to C T he certainly knows more
than all the ministry and all the opposition if their heads were laid
together and talks like an angel on a vast variety of subjects He
would really be a great man if he had any consistency or stability of
characterThen it must be owned he wants courage otherwise he would
never allow himself to be cowed by the great political bully for whose
understanding he has justly a very great contempt I have seen him as
much afraid of that overbearing Hector as ever schoolboy was of his
pedagogue and yet this Hector I shrewdly suspect is no more than a
craven at bottomBesides this defect C has another which he is
at too little pains to hideTheres no faith to be given to his
assertions and no trust to be put in his promisesHowever to give
the devil his due hes very goodnatured and even friendly when close
urged in the way of solicitationAs for principle thats out of the
questionIn a word he is a wit and an orator extremely entertaining
and he shines very often at the expence even of those ministers to whom
he is a retainer This is a mark of great imprudence by which he has
made them all his enemies whatever face they may put upon the matter
and sooner or later hell have cause to wish he had been able to keep
his own counsel I have several times cautioned him on this subject
but tis all preaching to the desertHis vanity runs away with his
discretionI could not help thinking the captain himself might have
been the better for some hints of the same natureHis panegyric
excluding principle and veracity puts me in mind of a contest I
once overheard in the way of altercation betwixt two applewomen
in SpringgardenOne of those viragos having hinted something to the
prejudice of the others moral character her antagonist setting her
hands in her sides repliedSpeak out hussyI scorn your maliceI
own Im both a whore and a thief and what more have you to sayDamn
you what more have you to say baiting that which all the world knows
I challenge you to say black is the white of my eyeWe did not wait
for Mr Ts coming forth but after captain C had characterised all
the originals in waiting we adjourned to a coffeehouse where we had
buttered muffins and tea to breakfast the said captain still favouring
us with his companyNay my uncle was so diverted with his anecdotes
that he asked him to dinner and treated him with a fine turbot to
which he did ample justiceThat same evening I spent at the tavern with
some friends one of whom let me into Cs character which Mr Bramble
no sooner understood than he expressed some concern for the connexion
he had made and resolved to disengage himself from it without ceremony

We are become members of the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts
and have assisted at some of their deliberations which were conducted
with equal spirit and sagacityMy uncle is extremely fond of the
institution which will certainly be productive of great advantages to
the public if from its democratical form it does not degenerate into
cabal and corruptionYou are already acquainted with his aversion to
the influence of the multitude which he affirms is incompatible with
excellence and subversive of orderIndeed his detestation of the mob
has been heightened by fear ever since he fainted in the room at Bath
and this apprehension has prevented him from going to the Little Theatre
in the Haymarket and other places of entertainment to which however
I have had the honour to attend the ladies

It grates old Squaretoes to reflect that it is not in his power to
enjoy even the most elegant diversions of the capital without the
participation of the vulgar for they now thrust themselves into all
assemblies from a ridotto at St Jamess to a hop at Rotherhithe I
have lately seen our old acquaintance Dick Ivy who we imagined had died
of dramdrinking but he is lately emerged from the Fleet by means of
a pamphlet which he wrote and published against the government with some
success The sale of this performance enabled him to appear in clean
linen and he is now going about soliciting subscriptions for his Poems
but his breeches are not yet in the most decent order

Dick certainly deserves some countenance for his intrepidity and
perseveranceIt is not in the power of disappointment nor even of
damnation to drive him to despairAfter some unsuccessful essays in
the way of poetry he commenced brandymerchant and I believe his
whole stock ran out through his own bowels then he consorted with a
milkwoman who kept a cellar in Petty France but he could not make his
quarters good he was dislodged and driven up stairs into the kennel by
a corporal in the second regiment of footguardsHe was afterwards the
laureat of Blackfriars from whence there was a natural transition to
the FleetAs he had formerly miscarried in panegyric he now turned his
thoughts to satire and really seems to have some talent for abuse If
he can hold out till the meeting of the parliament and be prepared
for another charge in all probability Dick will mount the pillory
or obtain a pension in either of which events his fortune will be
madeMean while he has acquired some degree of consideration with the
respectable writers of the age and as I have subscribed for his works
he did me the favour tother night to introduce me to a society of those
geniuses but I found them exceedingly formal and reservedThey
seemed afraid and jealous of one another and sat in a state of mutual
repulsion like so many particles of vapour each surrounded by its own
electrified atmosphere Dick who has more vivacity than judgment tried
more than once to enliven the conversation sometimes making an effort
at wit sometimes letting off a pun and sometimes discharging a
conundrum nay at length he started a dispute upon the hackneyed
comparison betwixt blank verse and rhyme and the professors opened with
great clamour but instead of keeping to the subject they launched
out into tedious dissertations on the poetry of the ancients and one
of them who had been a schoolmaster displayed his whole knowledge of
prosody gleaned from Disputer and Ruddiman At last I ventured to say
I did not see how the subject in question could be at all elucidated by
the practice of the ancients who certainly had neither blank verse
nor rhyme in their poems which were measured by feet whereas ours are
reckoned by the number of syllablesThis remark seemed to give umbrage
to the pedant who forthwith involved himself in a cloud of Greek and
Latin quotations which nobody attempted to dispelA confused hum of
insipid observations and comments ensued and upon the whole I never
passed a duller evening in my lifeYet without all doubt some of them
were men of learning wit and ingenuity As they are afraid of making
free with one another they should bring each his butt or whetstone
along with him for the entertainment of the companyMy uncle says he
never desires to meet with more than one wit at a timeOne wit like a
knuckle of ham in soup gives a zest and flavour to the dish but more
than one serves only to spoil the pottageAnd now Im afraid I have
given you an unconscionable mess without any flavour at all for which
I suppose you will bestow your benedictions upon

Your friend and servant J MELFORD LONDON June 5




To Dr LEWIS

DEAR LEWIS

Your fable of the monkey and the pig is what the Italians call ben
trovata but I shall not repeat it to my apothecary who is a proud
Scotchman very thin skinned and for aught I know may have his degree
in his pocketA right Scotchman has always two strings to his bow and
is in utrumque paratusCertain it is I have not scaped a scouring
but I believe by means of that scouring I have scaped something
worse perhaps a tedious fit of the gout or rheumatism for my appetite
began to flag and I had certain croakings in the bowels which boded me
no goodNay I am not yet quite free of these remembrances which warn
me to be gone from this centre of infection

What temptation can a man of my turn and temperament have to live in
a place where every corner teems with fresh objects of detestation
and disgust What kind of taste and organs must those people have
who really prefer the adulterate enjoyments of the town to the genuine
pleasures of a country retreat Most people I know are originally
seduced by vanity ambition and childish curiosity which cannot be
gratified but in the busy haunts of men but in the course of this
gratification their very organs of sense are perverted and they become
habitually lost to every relish of what is genuine and excellent in its
own nature

Shall I state the difference between my town grievances and my country
comforts At Brambletonhall I have elbowroom within doors and
breathe a clear elastic salutary airI enjoy refreshing sleep which
is never disturbed by horrid noise nor interrupted but in amorning
by the sweet twitter of the martlet at my windowI drink the virgin
lymph pure and chrystalline as it gushes from the rock or the
sparkling beveridge homebrewed from malt of my own making or I
indulge with cyder which my own orchard affords or with claret of
the best growth imported for my own use by a correspondent on whose
integrity I can depend my bread is sweet and nourishing made from my
own wheat ground in my own mill and baked in my own oven my table
is in a great measure furnished from my own ground my fiveyear old
mutton fed on the fragrant herbage of the mountains that might vie
with venison in juice and flavour my delicious veal fattened with
nothing but the mothers milk that fills the dish with gravy my
poultry from the barndoor that never knew confinement but when they
were at roost my rabbits panting from the warren my game fresh from
the moors my trout and salmon struggling from the stream oysters from
their native banks and herrings with other sea fish I can eat in
four hours after they are takenMy sallads roots and potherbs my own
garden yields in plenty and perfection the produce of the natural
soil prepared by moderate cultivation The same soil affords all the
different fruits which England may call her own so that my dessert is
every day freshgathered from the tree my dairy flows with nectarious
tildes of milk and cream from whence we derive abundance of excellent
butter curds and cheese and the refuse fattens my pigs that are
destined for hams and baconI go to bed betimes and rise with the
sunI make shift to pass the hours without weariness or regret and
am not destitute of amusements within doors when the weather will not
permit me to go abroadI read and chat and play at billiards cards
or backgammonWithout doors I superintend my farm and execute
plans of improvements the effects of which I enjoy with unspeakable
delightNor do I take less pleasure in seeing my tenants thrive under
my auspices and the poor live comfortably by the employment which I
provideYou know I have one or two sensible friends to whom I can open
all my heart a blessing which perhaps I might have sought in vain
among the crowded scenes of life there are a few others of more humble
parts whom I esteem for their integrity and their conversation I find
inoffensive though not very entertaining Finally I live in the midst
of honest men and trusty dependents who I flatter myself have a
disinterested attachment to my person You yourself my dear Doctor
can vouch for the truth of these assertions

Now mark the contrast at LondonI am pent up in frowzy lodgings where
there is not room enough to swing a cat and I breathe the steams
of endless putrefaction and these would undoubtedly produce a
pestilence if they were not qualified by the gross acid of seacoal
which is itself a pernicious nuisance to lungs of any delicacy of
texture but even this boasted corrector cannot prevent those languid
sallow looks that distinguish the inhabitants of London from those
ruddy swains that lead a countrylifeI go to bed after midnight jaded
and restless from the dissipations of the dayI start every hour from
my sleep at the horrid noise of the watchmen bawling the hour through
every street and thundering at every door a set of useless fellows
who serve no other purpose but that of disturbing the repose of the
inhabitants and by five oclock I start out of bed in consequence
of the still more dreadful alarm made by the country carts and noisy
rustics bellowing green pease under my window If I would drink water
I must quaff the maukish contents of an open aqueduct exposed to all
manner of defilement or swallow that which comes from the river
Thames impregnated with all the filth of London and WestminsterHuman
excrement is the least offensive part of the concrete which is
composed of all the drugs minerals and poisons used in mechanics and
manufacture enriched with the putrefying carcasses of beasts and men
and mixed with the scourings of all the washtubs kennels and common
sewers within the bills of mortality

This is the agreeable potation extolled by the Londoners as the finest
water in the universeAs to the intoxicating potion sold for wine it
is a vile unpalatable and pernicious sophistication balderdashed with
cyder cornspirit and the juice of sloes In an action at law laid
against a carman for having staved a cask of port it appeared from the
evidence of the cooper that there were not above five gallons of real
wine in the whole pipe which held above a hundred and even that had
been brewed and adulterated by the merchant at Oporto The bread I
cat in London is a deleterious paste mixed up with chalk alum and
boneashes insipid to the taste and destructive to the constitution
The good people are not ignorant of this adulterationbut they prefer
it to wholesome bread because it is whiter than the meal of corn thus
they sacrifice their taste and their health and the lives of their
tender infants to a most absurd gratification of a misjudging eye and
the miller or the baker is obliged to poison them and their families
in order to live by his profession The same monstrous depravity appears
in their veal which is bleached by repeated bleedings and other
villainous arts till there is not a drop of juice left in the body
and the poor animal is paralytic before it dies so void of all taste
nourishment and savour that a man might dine as comfortably on a white
fricassee of kidskin gloves or chip hats from Leghorn

As they have discharged the natural colour from their bread their
butchersmeat and poultry their cutlets ragouts fricassees and
sauces of all kinds so they insist upon having the complexion of their
potherbs mended even at the hazard of their lives Perhaps you will
hardly believe they can be so mad as to boil their greens with brass
halfpence in order to improve their colour and yet nothing is more
trueIndeed without this improvement in the colour they have no
personal merit They are produced in an artificial soil and taste
of nothing but the dunghills from whence they spring My cabbage
cauliflower and sparagus in the country are as much superior in
flavour to those that are sold in Coventgarden as my heathmutton is
to that of St Jamessmarket which in fact is neither lamb nor mutton
but something betwixt the two gorged in the rank fens of Lincoln and
Essex pale coarse and frowzyAs for the pork it is an abominable
carnivorous animal fed with horseflesh and distillers grains and
the poultry is all rotten in consequence of a fever occasioned by
the infamous practice of sewing up the gut that they may be the sooner
fattened in coops in consequence of this cruel retention

Of the fish I need say nothing in this hot weather but that it comes
sixty seventy fourscore and a hundred miles by landcarriage a
circumstance sufficient without any comment to turn a Dutchmans
stomach even if his nose was not saluted in every alley with the sweet
flavour of fresh mackarel selling by retail This is not the season for
oysters nevertheless it may not be amiss to mention that the right
Colchester are kept in slimepits occasionally overflowed by the sea
and that the green colour so much admired by the voluptuaries of this
metropolis is occasioned by the vitriolic scum which rises on the
surface of the stagnant and stinking waterOur rabbits are bred and
fed in the poulterers cellar where they have neither air nor exercise
consequently they must be firm in flesh and delicious in flavour and
there is no game to be had for love or money

It must be owned the Coventgarden affords some good fruit which
however is always engrossed by a few individuals of overgrown fortune
at an exorbitant price so that little else than the refuse of the
market falls to the share of the community and that is distributed
by such filthy hands as I cannot look at without loathing It was but
yesterday that I saw a dirty barrowbunter in the street cleaning her
dusty fruit with her own spittle and who knows but some fine lady
of St Jamess parish might admit into her delicate mouth those very
cherries which had been rolled and moistened between the filthy and
perhaps ulcerated chops of a St Giless hucksterI need not dwell upon
the pallid contaminated mash which they call strawberries soiled and
tossed by greasy paws through twenty baskets crusted with dirt and then
presented with the worst milk thickened with the worst flour into a
bad likeness of cream but the milk itself should not pass unanalysed
the produce of faded cabbageleaves and sour draff lowered with hot
water frothed with bruised snails carried through the streets in open
pails exposed to foul rinsings discharged from doors and windows
spittle snot and tobaccoquids from foot passengers overflowings from
mud carts spatterings from coach wheels dirt and trash chucked into it
by roguish boys for the jokes sake the spewings of infants who have
slabbered in the tinmeasure which is thrown back in that condition
among the milk for the benefit of the next customer and finally
the vermin that drops from the rags of the nasty drab that vends this
precious mixture under the respectable denomination of milkmaid

I shall conclude this catalogue of London dainties with that
tablebeer guiltless of hops and malt vapid and nauseous much fitter
to facilitate the operation of a vomit than to quench thirst and
promote digestion the tallowy rancid mass called butter manufactured
with candle grease and kitchen stuff and their fresh eggs imported
from France and ScotlandNow all these enormities might be remedied
with a very little attention to the article of police or civil
regulation but the wise patriots of London have taken it into their
heads that all regulation is inconsistent with liberty and that every
man ought to live in his own way without restraintNay as there is
not sense enough left among them to be discomposed by the nuisance I
have mentioned they may for aught I care wallow in the mire of their
own pollution

A companionable man will undoubtedly put up with many inconveniences
for the sake of enjoying agreeable society A facetious friend of mine
used to say the wine could not be bad where the company was agreeable
a maxim which however ought to be taken cum grano salis but what
is the society of London that I should be tempted for its sake to
mortify my senses and compound with such uncleanness as my soul abhors
All the people I see are too much engrossed by schemes of interest or
ambition to have any room left for sentiment or friendship Even in
some of my old acquaintance those schemes and pursuits have obliterated
all traces of our former connexionConversation is reduced to party
disputes and illiberal altercationSocial commerce to formal visits
and cardplayingIf you pick up a diverting original by accident it
may be dangerous to amuse yourself with his odditiesHe is generally a
tartar at bottom a sharper a spy or a lunatic Every person you deal
with endeavours to overreach you in the way of business you are preyed
upon by idle mendicants who beg in the phrase of borrowing and live
upon the spoils of the strangerYour tradesmen are without conscience
your friends without affection and your dependents without fidelity

My letter would swell into a treatise were I to particularize every
cause of offence that fills up the measure of my aversion to this and
every other crowded cityThank Heaven I am not so far sucked into
the vortex but that I can disengage myself without any great effort of
philosophyFrom this wild uproar of knavery folly and impertinence I
shall fly with double relish to the serenity of retirement the cordial
effusions of unreserved friendship the hospitality and protection
of the rural gods in a word the jucunda oblivia Vitae which Horace
himself had not taste enough to enjoy

I have agreed for a good travellingcoach and four at a guinea a day
for three months certain and next week we intend to begin our
journey to the North hoping still to be with you by the latter end of
OctoberI shall continue to write from every stage where we make any
considerable halt as often as anything occurs which I think can
afford you the least amusement In the mean time I must beg you will
superintend the oeconomy of Barns with respect to my hay and corn
harvests assured that my ground produces nothing but what you may
freely call your ownOn any other terms I should be ashamed to
subscribe myself

Your unvariable friend MATT BRAMBLE LONDON June 8




To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR PHILLIPS

In my last I mentioned my having spent an evening with a society of
authors who seemed to be jealous and afraid of one another My uncle
was not at all surprised to hear me say I was disappointed in their
conversation A man may be very entertaining and instructive upon paper
said he and exceedingly dull in common discourse I have observed
that those who shine most in private company are but secondary stars
in the constellation of geniusA small stock of ideas is more easily
managed and sooner displayed than a great quantity crowded together
There is very seldom any thing extraordinary in the appearance and
address of a good writer whereas a dull author generally distinguishes
himself by some oddity or extravagance For this reason I fancy that
an assembly of Grubs must be very diverting

My curiosity being excited by this hint I consulted my friend Dick Ivy
who undertook to gratify it the very next day which was Sunday last
He carried me to dine with S whom you and I have long known by his
writingsHe lives in the skirts of the town and every Sunday his
house is opened to all unfortunate brothers of the quill whom he treats
with beef pudding and potatoes port punch and Calverts entire butt
beer He has fixed upon the first day of the week for the exercise of
his hospitality because some of his guests could not enjoy it on any
other for reasons that I need not explain I was civilly received in
a plain yet decent habitation which opened backwards into a very
pleasant garden kept in excellent order and indeed I saw none of the
outward signs of authorship either in the house or the landlord who
is one of those few writers of the age that stand upon their own
foundation without patronage and above dependence If there was
nothing characteristic in the entertainer the company made ample amends
for his want of singularity

At two in the afternoon I found myself one of ten messmates seated at
table and I question if the whole kingdom could produce such another
assemblage of originals Among their peculiarities I do not mention
those of dress which may be purely accidental What struck me were
oddities originally produced by affectation and afterwards confirmed
by habit One of them wore spectacles at dinner and another his hat
flapped though as Ivy told me the first was noted for having a
seamans eye when a bailiff was in the wind and the other was never
known to labour under any weakness or defect of vision except about
five years ago when he was complimented with a couple of black eyes by
a player with whom he had quarrelled in his drink A third wore a laced
stocking and made use of crutches because once in his life he had
been laid up with a broken leg though no man could leap over a stick
with more agility A fourth had contracted such an antipathy to the
country that he insisted upon sitting with his back towards the window
that looked into the garden and when a dish of cauliflower was set upon
the table he snuffed up volatile salts to keep him from fainting yet
this delicate person was the son of a cottager born under a hedge
and had many years run wild among asses on a common A fifth affected
distraction When spoke to he always answered from the purpose
sometimes he suddenly started up and rapped out a dreadful oath
sometimes he burst out alaughingthen he folded his arms and sighed
and then he hissed like fifty serpents

At first I really thought he was mad and as he sat near me began
to be under some apprehensions for my own safety when our landlord
perceiving me alarmed assured me aloud that I had nothing to fear The
gentleman said he is trying to act a part for which he is by no means
qualifiedif he had all the inclination in the world it is not in his
power to be mad His spirits are too flat to be kindled into frenzy
Tis no bad pppuff however observed a person in a tarnished
laced coat affffected inmadness wwill ppass for wwit wwith
nineninetteen out of ttwentyAnd affected stuttering for humour
replied our landlord tho God knows there is an affinity betwixt
them It seems this wag after having made some abortive attempts
in plain speaking had recourse to this defect by means of which he
frequently extorted the laugh of the company without the least expence
of genius and that imperfection which he had at first counterfeited
was now become so habitual that he could not lay it aside

A certain winking genius who wore yellow gloves at dinner had on his
first introduction taken such offence at S because he looked
and talked and ate and drank like any other man that he spoke
contemptuously of his understanding ever after and never would repeat
his visit until he had exhibited the following proof of his caprice
Wat Wyvil the poet having made some unsuccessful advances towards an
intimacy with S at last gave him to understand by a third person
that he had written a poem in his praise and a satire against his
person that if he would admit him to his house the first should be
immediately sent to press but that if he persisted in declining his
friendship he would publish his satire without delay S replied that
he looked upon Wyvils panegyrick as in effect a species of infamy
and would resent it accordingly with a good cudgel but if he published
the satire he might deserve his compassion and had nothing to fear
from his revenge Wyvil having considered the alternative resolved to
mortify S by printing the panegyrick for which he received a sound
drubbing Then he swore the peace against the aggressor who in order
to avoid a prosecution at law admitted him to his good graces It was
the singularity in Ss conduct on this occasion that reconciled him
to the yellowgloved philosopher who owned he had some genius and from
that period cultivated his acquaintance

Curious to know upon what subjects the several talents of my
fellowguests were employed I applied to my communicative friend Dick
Ivy who gave me to understand that most of them were or had been
understrappers or journeymen to more creditable authors for whom they
translated collated and compiled in the business of bookmaking and
that all of them had at different times laboured in the service of
our landlord though they had now set up for themselves in various
departments of literature Not only their talents but also their
nations and dialects were so various that our conversation resembled
the confusion of tongues at Babel We had the Irish brogue the
Scotch accent and foreign idiom twanged off by the most discordant
vociferation for as they all spoke together no man had any chance
to be heard unless he could bawl louder than his fellows It must be
owned however there was nothing pedantic in their discourse they
carefully avoided all learned disquisitions and endeavoured to be
facetious nor did their endeavours always miscarrysome droll repartee
passed and much laughter was excited and if any individual lost his
temper so far as to transgress the bounds of decorum he was effectually
checked by the master of the feast who exerted a sort of paternal
authority over this irritable tribe

The most learned philosopher of the whole collection who had been
expelled the university for atheism has made great progress in a
refutation of lord Bolingbrokes metaphysical works which is said to
be equally ingenious and orthodox but in the mean time he has been
presented to the grand jury as a public nuisance for having blasphemed
in an alehouse on the Lords day The Scotchman gives lectures on the
pronunciation of the English language which he is now publishing by
subscription

The Irishman is a political writer and goes by the name of my Lord
Potatoe He wrote a pamphlet in vindication of a minister hoping his
zeal would be rewarded with some place or pension but finding himself
neglected in that quarter he whispered about that the pamphlet was
written by the minister himself and he published an answer to his own
production In this he addressed the author under the title of your
lordship with such solemnity that the public swallowed the deceit and
bought up the whole impression The wise politicians of the metropolis
declared they were both masterly performances and chuckled over the
flimsy reveries of an ignorant garretteer as the profound speculations
of a veteran statesman acquainted with all the secrets of the cabinet
The imposture was detected in the sequel and our Hibernian pamphleteer
retains no part of his assumed importance but the bare title of
my lord and the upper part of the table at the potatoeordinary in
Shoelane

Opposite to me sat a Piedmontese who had obliged the public with
a humorous satire intituled The Ballance of the English Poets a
performance which evinced the great modesty and taste of the author
and in particular his intimacy with the elegancies of the English
language The sage who laboured under the agrophobia or horror of
green fields had just finished a treatise on practical agriculture
though in fact he had never seen corn growing in his life and was
so ignorant of grain that our entertainer in the face of the whole
company made him own that a plate of hominy was the best rice pudding
he had ever eat

The stutterer had almost finished his travels through Europe and part
of Asia without ever budging beyond the liberties of the Kings Bench
except in termtime with a tipstaff for his companion and as for
little Tim Cropdale the most facetious member of the whole society
he had happily wound up the catastrophe of a virgin tragedy from the
exhibition of which he promised himself a large fund of profit and
reputation Tim had made shift to live many years by writing novels
at the rate of five pounds a volume but that branch of business is now
engrossed by female authors who publish merely for the propagation of
virtue with so much ease and spirit and delicacy and knowledge of the
human heart and all in the serene tranquillity of high life that the
reader is not only inchanted by their genius but reformed by their
morality

After dinner we adjourned into the garden where I observed Mr S
gave a short separate audience to every individual in a small remote
filbert walk from whence most of them dropt off one after another
without further ceremony but they were replaced by fresh recruits of
the same clan who came to make an afternoons visit and among others
a spruce bookseller called Birkin who rode his own gelding and made
his appearance in a pair of new jemmy boots with massy spurs of plate
It was not without reason that this midwife of the Muses used exercise
ahorseback for he was too fat to walk afoot and he underwent some
sarcasms from Tim Cropdale on his unwieldy size and inaptitude for
motion Birkin who took umbrage at this poor authors petulance in
presuming to joke upon a man so much richer than himself told him he
was not so unwieldy but that he could move the Marshalsea court for a
writ and even overtake him with it if he did not very speedily come
and settle accounts with him respecting the expence of publishing his
last ode to the king of Prussia of which he had sold but three and
one of them was to Whitfield the methodist Tim affected to receive this
intimation with good humour saying he expected in a post or two from
Potsdam a poem of thanks from his Prussian majesty who knew very well
how to pay poets in their own coin but in the mean time he proposed
that Mr Birkin and he should run three times round the garden for a bowl
of punch to be drank at Ashleys in the evening and he would run boots
against stockings The bookseller who valued himself upon his mettle
was persuaded to accept the challenge and he forthwith resigned
his boots to Cropdale who when he had put them on was no bad
representation of captain Pistol in the play

Every thing being adjusted they started together with great
impetuosity and in the second round Birkin had clearly the advantage
larding the lean earth as he puffd along Cropdale had no mind to
contest the victory further but in a twinkling disappeared through
the backdoor of the garden which opened into a private lane that had
communication with the high roadThe spectators immediately began to
hollow Stole away and Birkin set off in pursuit of him with great
eagerness but he had not advanced twenty yards in the lane when a
thorn running into his foot sent him hopping back into the garden
roaring with pain and swearing with vexation When he was delivered
from this annoyance by the Scotchman who had been bred to surgery he
looked about him wildly exclaiming Sure the fellow wont be such
a rogue as to run clear away with my boots Our landlord having
reconnoitered the shoes he had left which indeed hardly deserved that
name Pray said he Mr Birkin want your boots made of calfskin
Calfskin or cowskin replied the other Ill find a slip of
sheepskin that will do his businessI lost twenty pounds by his farce
which you persuaded me to buyI am out of pocket five pounds by
his damnd ode and now this pair of boots bran new cost me
thirty shillings as per receiptBut this affair of the boots is
felonytransportationIll have the dog indicted at the Old BaileyI
will Mr S I will be revengd even though I should lose my debt in
consequence of his conviction

Mr S said nothing at present but accommodated him with a pair of
shoes then ordered his servant to rub him down and comfort him with a
glass of rumpunch which seemed in a great measure to cool the rage
of his indignation After all said our landlord this is no more
than a humbug in the way of wit though it deserves a more respectable
epithet when considered as an effort of invention Tim being I
suppose out of credit with the cordwainer fell upon this ingenious
expedient to supply the want of shoes knowing that Mr Birkin who
loves humour would himself relish the joke upon a little recollection
Cropdale literally lives by his wit which he has exercised upon all his
friends in their turns He once borrowed my poney for five or six days
to go to Salisbury and sold him in Smithfield at his return This was
a joke of such a serious nature that in the first transports of my
passion I had some thoughts of prosecuting him for horsestealing
and even when my resentment had in some measure subsided as he
industriously avoided me I vowed I would take satisfaction on his ribs
with the first opportunity One day seeing him at some distance in the
street coming towards me I began to prepare my cane for action and
walked in the shadow of a porter that he might not perceive me soon
enough to make his escape but in the very instant I had lifted up
the instrument of correction I found Tim Cropdale metamorphosed into a
miserable blind wretch feeling his way with a long stick from post to
post and rolling about two bald unlighted orbs instead of eyes I
was exceedingly shocked at having so narrowly escaped the concern and
disgrace that would have attended such a misapplication of vengeance
but next day Tim prevailed upon a friend of mine to come and solicit
my forgiveness and offer his note payable in six weeks for the price
of the poney This gentleman gave me to understand that the blind man
was no other than Cropdale who having seen me advancing and
guessing my intent had immediately converted himself into the object
aforesaidI was so diverted at the ingenuity of the evasion that I
agreed to pardon his offence refusing his note however that I might
keep a prosecution for felony hanging over his head as a security for
his future good behaviourBut Timothy would by no means trust himself
in my hands till the note was acceptedthen he made his appearance at
my door as a blind beggar and imposed in such a manner upon my man who
had been his old acquaintance and potcompanion that the fellow threw
the door in his face and even threatened to give him the bastinado
Hearing a noise in the hall I went thither and immediately
recollecting the figure I had passed in the street accosted him by his
own name to the unspeakable astonishment of the footman

Birkin declared he loved a joke as well as another but asked if any of
the company could tell where Mr Cropdale lodged that he might send him
a proposal about restitution before the boots should be made away with
I would willingly give him a pair of new shoes said he and half a
guinea into the bargain for the boots which fitted me like a glove
and I shant be able to get the fellows of them till the good weather
for riding is over The stuttering wit declared that the only secret
which Cropdale ever kept was the place of his lodgings but he
believed that during the heats of summer he commonly took his
repose upon a bulk or indulged himself in fresco with one of the
kennelnymphs under the portico of St Martins church Pox on him
cried the bookseller he might as well have taken my whip and spurs In
that case he might have been tempted to steal another horse and then
he would have rid to the devil of course

After coffee I took my leave of Mr S with proper acknowledgments of
his civility and was extremely well pleased with the entertainment of
the day though not yet satisfied with respect to the nature of this
connexion betwixt a man of character in the literary world and a
parcel of authorlings who in all probability would never be able
to acquire any degree of reputation by their labours On this head
I interrogated my conductor Dick Ivy who answered me to this
effectOne would imagine S had some view to his own interest in
giving countenance and assistance to those people whom he knows to be
bad men as well as bad writers but if he has any such view he will
find himself disappointed for if he is so vain as to imagine he can
make them subservient to his schemes of profit or ambition they are
cunning enough to make him their property in the mean time There is not
one of the company you have seen today myself excepted who does
not owe him particular obligationsOne of them he bailed out of a
spunginghouse and afterwards paid the debtanother he translated into
his family and clothed when he was turned out half naked from jail in
consequence of an act for the relief of insolvent debtorsa third who
was reduced to a woollen night cap and lived upon sheeps trotters up
three pair of stairs backward in Butcherrow he took into present pay
and free quarters and enabled him to appear as a gentleman without
having the fear of sheriffs officers before his eyes Those who are in
distress he supplies with money when he has it and with his credit when
he is out of cash When they want business he either finds employment
for them in his own service or recommends them to booksellers to
execute some project he has formed for their subsistence They are
always welcome to his table which though plain is plentiful and to
his good offices as far as they will go and when they see Occasion
they make use of his name with the most petulant familiarity nay they
do not even scruple to arrogate to themselves the merit of some of his
performances and have been known to sell their own lucubrations as the
produce of his brain The Scotchman you saw at dinner once personated
him at an alehouse in WestSmithfield and in the character of S had
his head broke by a cowkeeper for having spoke disrespectfully of the
Christian religion but he took the law of him in his own person and
the assailant was fain to give him ten pounds to withdraw his action

I observed that all this appearance of liberality on the side of Mr S
was easily accounted for on the supposition that they flattered him
in private and engaged his adversaries in public and yet I was
astonished when I recollected that I often had seen this writer
virulently abused in papers poems and pamphlets and not a pen was
drawn in his defence But you will be more astonished said he when I
assure you those very guests whom you saw at his table today were
the authors of great part of that abuse and he himself is well aware
of their particular favours for they are all eager to detect and betray
one another But this is doing the devils work for nothing cried I
What should induce them to revile their benefactor without provocation
Envy answered Dick is the general incitement but they are galled by
an additional scourge of provocation S directs a literary journal
in which their productions are necessarily brought to trial and though
many of them have been treated with such lenity and favour as they
little deserved yet the slightest censure such as perhaps could not
be avoided with any pretensions to candour and impartiality has rankled
in the hearts of those authors to such a degree that they have taken
immediate vengeance on the critic in anonymous libels letters
and lampoons Indeed all the writers of the age good bad and
indifferent from the moment he assumed this office became his enemies
either professed or in petto except those of his friends who knew they
had nothing to fear from his strictures and he must be a wiser man than
me who can tell what advantage or satisfaction he derives from having
brought such a nest of hornets about his ears

I owned that was a point which might deserve consideration but still
I expressed a desire to know his real motives for continuing his
friendship to a set of rascals equally ungrateful and insignificantHe
said he did not pretend to assign any reasonable motive that if
the truth must be told the man was in point of conduct a most
incorrigible fool that though he pretended to have a knack at hitting
off characters he blundered strangely in the distribution of his
favours which were generally bestowed on the most undeserving of those
who had recourse to his assistance that indeed this preference was
not so much owing to want of discernment as to want of resolution for
he had not fortitude enough to resist the importunity even of the most
worthless and as he did not know the value of money there was very
little merit in parting with it so easily that his pride was gratified
in seeing himself courted by such a number of literary dependents that
probably he delighted in hearing them expose and traduce one another
and finally from their information he became acquainted with all the
transactions of Grubstreet which he had some thoughts of compiling for
the entertainment of the public

I could not help suspecting from Dicks discourse that he had some
particular grudge against S upon whose conduct he had put the worst
construction it would bear and by dint of crossexamination I found
he was not at all satisfied with the character which had been given in
the Review of his last performance though it had been treated civilly
in consequence of the authors application to the critic By all
accounts S is not without weakness and caprice but he is certainly
goodhumoured and civilized nor do I find that there is any thing
overbearing cruel or implacable in his disposition

I have dwelt so long upon authors that you will perhaps suspect I
intend to enroll myself among the fraternity but if I were actually
qualified for the profession it is at best but a desperate resource
against starving as it affords no provision for old age and infirmity
Salmon at the age of fourscore is now in a garret compiling matter
at a guinea a sheet for a modern historian who in point of age might
be his grandchild and Psalmonazar after having drudged half a century
in the literary mill in all the simplicity and abstinence of an
Asiatic subsists upon the charity of a few booksellers just sufficient
to keep him from the parish I think Guy who was himself a bookseller
ought to have appropriated one wing or ward of his hospital to the use
of decayed authors though indeed there is neither hospital college
nor workhouse within the bills of mortality large enough to contain
the poor of this society composed as it is from the refuse of every
other profession

I know not whether you will find any amusement in this account of an odd
race of mortals whose constitution had I own greatly interested the
curiosity of

To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS at Gloucester

MY DEAR LETTY

There is something on my spirits which I should not venture to
communicate by the post but having the opportunity of Mrs Brentwoods
return I seize it eagerly to disburthen my poor heart which is
oppressed with fear and vexationO Letty what a miserable situation
it is to be without a friend to whom one can apply for counsel and
consolation in distress I hinted in my last that one Mr Barton had
been very particular in his civilities I can no longer mistake his
meaninghe has formally professed himself my admirer and after
a thousand assiduities perceiving I made but a cold return to his
addresses he had recourse to the mediation of lady Griskin who has
acted the part of a very warm advocate in his behalfbut my dear
Willis her ladyship over acts her partshe not only expatiates on the
ample fortune the great connexions and the unblemished character of
Mr Barton but she takes the trouble to catechise me and two days ago
peremptorily told me that a girl of my age could not possibly resist so
many considerations if her heart was not preengaged

This insinuation threw me into such a flutter that she could not but
observe my disorder and presuming upon the discovery insisted upon
my making her the confidante of my passion But although I had not such
command of myself as to conceal the emotion of my heart I am not such a
child as to disclose its secret to a person who would certainly use
them to its prejudice I told her it was no wonder if I was out of
countenance at her introducing a subject of conversation so unsuitable
to my years and inexperience that I believed Mr Barton was a very
worthy gentleman and I was much obliged to him for his good opinion
but the affections were involuntary and mine in particular had as
yet made no concessions in his favour She shook her head with an air of
distrust that made me tremble and observed that if my affections were
free they would submit to the decision of prudence especially when
enforced by the authority of those who had a right to direct my conduct
This remark implied a design to interest my uncle or my aunt perhaps my
brother in behalf of Mr Bartons passion and I am sadly afraid that
my aunt is already gained over Yesterday in the forenoon he had been
walking with us in the Park and stopping in our return at a toyshop
he presented her with a very fine snuffbox and me with a gold etuis
which I resolutely refused till she commanded me to accept it on pain
of her displeasure nevertheless being still unsatisfied with respect
to the propriety of receiving this toy I signified my doubts to my
brother who said he would consult my uncle on the subject and seemed
to think Mr Barton had been rather premature in his presents

What will be the result of this consultation Heaven knows but I am
afraid it will produce an explanation with Mr Barton who will no
doubt avow his passion and solicit their consent to a connexion which
my soul abhors for my dearest Letty it is not in my power to love Mr
Barton even if my heart was untouched by any other tenderness Not that
there is any thing disagreeable about his person but there is a total
want of that nameless charm which captivates and controuls the inchanted
spirit at least he appears to me to have this defect but if he had
all the engaging qualifications which a man can possess they would be
excited in vain against that constancy which I flatter myself is the
characteristic of my nature No my dear Willis I may be involved in
fresh troubles and I believe I shall from the importunities of this
gentleman and the violence of my relations but my heart is incapable of
change

You know I put no faith in dreams and yet I have been much disturbed
by one that visited me last nightI thought I was in a church where
a certain person whom you know was on the point of being married to my
aunt that the clergyman was Mr Barton and that poor forlorn I stood
weeping in a corner half naked and without shoes or stockingsNow
I know there is nothing so childish as to be moved by those vain
illusions but nevertheless in spite of all my reason this hath
made a strong impression upon my mind which begins to be very gloomy
Indeed I have another more substantial cause of afflictionI have some
religious scruples my dear friend which lie heavy on my conscienceI
was persuaded to go to the Tabernacle where I heard a discourse that
affected me deeplyI have prayed fervently to be enlightened but
as yet I am not sensible of these inward motions those operations of
grace which are the signs of a regenerated spirit and therefore I
begin to be in terrible apprehensions about the state of my poor soul
Some of our family have had very uncommon accessions particularly
my aunt and Mrs Jenkins who sometimes speak as if they were really
inspired so that I am not like to want for either exhortation or
example to purify my thoughts and recall them from the vanities of
this world which indeed I would willingly resign if it was in my
power but to make this sacrifice I must be enabled by such assistance
from above as hath not yet been indulged to

Your unfortunate friend LYDIA MELFORD June 10




To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR PHILLIPS

The moment I received your letter I began to execute your
commissionWith the assistance of mine host at the Bull and Gate I
discovered the place to which your fugitive valet had retreated and
taxed him with his dishonestyThe fellow was in manifest confusion at
sight of me but he denied the charge with great confidence till I told
him that if he would give up the watch which was a family piece he
might keep the money and the clothes and go to the devil his own way
at his leisure but if he rejected this proposal I would deliver him
forthwith to the constable whom I had provided for that purpose and
he would carry him before the justice without further delay After
some hesitation he desired to speak with me in the next room where he
produced the watch with all its appendages and I have delivered it to
our landlord to be sent you by the first safe conveyance

So much for business

I shall grow vain upon your saying you find entertainment in my
letters barren as they certainly are of incident and importance
because your amusement must arise not from the matter but from the
manner which you know is all my ownAnimated therefore by the
approbation of a person whose nice taste and consummate judgment I can
no longer doubt I will chearfully proceed with our memoirsAs it is
determined we shall set out next week for Yorkshire I went today in
the forenoon with my uncle to see a carriage belonging to a coachmaker
in our neighbourhoodTurning down a narrow lane behind Longacre we
perceived a crowd of people standing at a door which it seems opened
into a kind of a methodist meeting and were informed that a footman
was then holding forth to the congregation within Curious to see this
phoenomenon we squeezed into the place with much difficulty and who
should this preacher be but the identical Humphry Clinker He had
finished his sermon and given out a psalm the first stave of which he
sung with peculiar gracesBut if we were astonished to see Clinker in
the pulpit we were altogether confounded at finding all the females
of our family among the audienceThere was lady Griskin Mrs Tabitha
Bramble Mrs Winifred Jenkins my sister Liddy and Mr Barton and all
of them joined in the psalmody with strong marks of devotion

I could hardly keep my gravity on this ludicrous occasion but old
Squaretoes was differently affectedThe first thing that struck him
was the presumption of his lacquey whom he commanded to come down with
such an air of authority as Humphry did not think proper to disregard
He descended immediately and all the people were in commotion Barton
looked exceedingly sheepish lady Griskin flirted her fan Mrs Tabby
groaned in spirit Liddy changed countenance and Mrs Jenkins sobbed as
if her heart was breakingMy uncle with a sneer asked pardon of the
ladies for having interrupted their devotion saying he had particular
business with the preacher whom he ordered to call a hackneycoach
This being immediately brought up to the end of the lane he handed
Liddy into it and my aunt and I following him we drove home without
taking any further notice of the rest of the company who still remained
in silent astonishment

Mr Bramble perceiving Liddy in great trepidation assumed a milder
aspect bidding her be under no concern for he was not at all
displeased at any thing she had doneI have no objection said he
to your being religiously inclined but I dont think my servant is a
proper ghostly director for a devotee of your sex and characterif
in fact as I rather believe your aunt is not the sole conductress of
this machineMrs Tabitha made no answer but threw up the whites of
her eyes as if in the act of ejaculationPoor Liddy said she had no
right to the title of a devotee that she thought there was no harm in
hearing a pious discourse even if it came from a footman especially
as her aunt was present but that if she had erred from ignorance she
hoped he would excuse it as she could not bear the thoughts of living
under his displeasure The old gentleman pressing her hand with a
tender smile said she was a good girl and that he did not believe
her capable of doing any thing that could give him the least umbrage or
disgust

When we arrived at our lodgings he commanded Mr Clinker to attend him
up stairs and spoke to him in these wordsSince you are called upon
by the spirit to preach and to teach it is high time to lay aside the
livery of an earthly master and for my part I am unworthy to have an
apostle in my serviceI hope said Humphry I have not failed in my
duty to your honourI should be a vile wretch if I did considering the
misery from which your charity and compassion relieved mebut having
an inward admonition of the spirit An admonition of the devil cried
the squire in a passion What admonition you blockhead What right has
such a fellow as you to set up for a reformer Begging your honours
pardon replied Clinker may not the new light of Gods grace shine
upon the poor and the ignorant in their humility as well as upon the
wealthy and the philosopher in all his pride of human learning What
you imagine to be the new light of grace said his master I take to be
a deceitful vapour glimmering through a crack in your upper storyIn
a word Mr Clinker I will have no light in my family but what pays the
kings taxes unless it be the light of reason which you dont pretend
to follow

Ah sir cried Humphry the light of reason is no more in comparison
to the light I mean than a farthing candle to the sun at noonVery
true said uncle the one will serve to shew you your way and the
other to dazzle and confound your weak brain Heark ye Clinker you
are either an hypocritical knave or a wrongheaded enthusiast and in
either case unfit for my service If you are a quack in sanctity and
devotion you will find it an easy matter to impose upon silly women
and others of crazed understanding who will contribute lavishly for
your support If you are really seduced by the reveries of a disturbed
imagination the sooner you lose your senses entirely the better for
yourself and the community In that case some charitable person might
provide you with a dark room and clean straw in Bedlam where it would
not be in your power to infect others with your fanaticism whereas
if you have just reflection enough left to maintain the character of a
chosen vessel in the meetings of the godly you and your hearers will be
misled by a Willithewisp from one error into another till you are
plunged into religious frenzy and then perhaps you will hang yourself
in despair Which the Lord of his infinite mercy forbid exclaimed the
affrighted Clinker It is very possible I may be under the temptation of
the devil who wants to wreck me on the rocks of spiritual prideYour
honour says I am either a knave or a madman now as Ill assure your
honour I am no knave it follows that I must be mad therefore I
beseech your honour upon my knees to take my case into consideration
that means may be used for my recovery

The squire could not help smiling at the poor fellows simplicity and
promised to take care of him provided he would mind the business of his
place without running after the new light of methodism but Mrs Tabitha
took offence at his humility which she interpreted into poorness
of spirit and worldly mindedness She upbraided him with the want of
courage to suffer for conscience sakeShe observed that if he should
lose his place for bearing testimony to the truth Providence would not
fail to find him another perhaps more advantageous and declaring that
it could not be very agreeable to live in a family where an inquisition
was established retired to another room in great agitation

My uncle followed her with a significant look then turning to the
preacher You hear what my sister saysIf you cannot live with me upon
such terms as I have prescribed the vineyard of methodism lies before
you and she seems very well disposed to reward your labourI would
not willingly give offence to any soul upon earth answered Humphry
her ladyship has been very good to me ever since we came to London and
surely she has a heart turned for religious exercises and both she and
lady Griskin sing psalms and hymns like two cherubimsBut at the same
time Im bound to love and obey your honourIt becometh not such a
poor ignorant fellow as me to hold dispute with gentlemen of rank and
learningAs for the matter of knowledge I am no more than a beast in
comparison of your honour therefore I submit and with Gods grace I
will follow you to the worlds end if you dont think me too far gone
to be out of confinement

His master promised to keep him for some time longer on trial then
desired to know in what manner lady Griskin and Mr Barton came to join
their religious society he told him that her ladyship was the person
who first carried my aunt and sister to the Tabernacle whither he
attended them and had his devotion kindled by Mr Ws preaching that
he was confirmed in this new way by the preachers sermons which he
had bought and studied with great attention that his discourse and
prayers had brought over Mrs Jenkins and the housemaid to the same
way of thinking but as for Mr Barton he had never seen him at service
before this day when he came in company with lady Griskin Humphry
moreover owned that he had been encouraged to mount the rostrum by
the example and success of a weaver who was much followed as a powerful
minister that on his first trial he found himself under such strong
impulsions as made him believe he was certainly moved by the spirit
and that he had assisted in lady Griskins and several private houses
at exercises of devotion

Mr Bramble was no sooner informed that her ladyship had acted as the
primum mobile of this confederacy than he concluded she had only made
use of Clinker as a tool subservient to the execution of some design
to the true secret of which he was an utter strangerHe observed that
her ladyships brain was a perfect mill for projects and that she and
Tabby had certainly engaged in some secret treaty the nature of which
he could not comprehend I told him I thought it was no difficult matter
to perceive the drift of Mrs Tabitha which was to ensnare the heart
of Barton and that in all likelihood my lady Griskin acted as her
auxiliary that this supposition would account for their endeavours to
convert him to methodism an event which would occasion a connexion of
souls that might be easily improved into a matrimonial union

My uncle seemed to be much diverted by the thoughts of this Schemes
succeeding but I gave him to understand that Barton was preengaged
that he had the day before made a present of an etuis to Liddy
which her aunt had obliged her to receive with a view no doubt to
countenance her own accepting of a snuffbox at the same time that my
sister having made me acquainted with this incident I had desired an
explanation of Mr Barton who declared his intentions were honourable
and expressed his hope that I would have no objections to his alliance
that I had thanked him for the honour he intended our family but told
him it would be necessary to consult her uncle and aunt who were
her guardians and their approbation being obtained I could have no
objection to his proposal though I was persuaded that no violence would
be offered to my sisters inclinations in a transaction that so nearly
interested the happiness of her future life that he had assured me he
should never think of availing himself of a guardians authority unless
he could render his addresses agreeable to the young lady herself and
that he would immediately demand permission of Mr and Mrs Bramble to
make Liddy a tender of his hand and fortune

The squire was not insensible to the advantages of such a match and
declared he would promote it with all his influence but when I took
notice that there seemed to be an aversion on the side of Liddy he said
he would sound her on the subject and if her reluctance was such as
would not be easily overcome he would civilly decline the proposal of
Mr Barton for he thought that in the choice of a husband a young woman
ought not to sacrifice the feelings of her heart for any consideration
upon earthLiddy is not so desperate said he as to worship fortune
at such an expence

I take it for granted this whole affair will end in smoke though there
seems to be a storm brewing in the quarter of Mrs Tabby who sat with
all the sullen dignity of silence at dinner seemingly pregnant with
complaint and expostulation As she had certainly marked Barton for her
own prey she cannot possibly favour his suit to Liddy and therefore
I expect something extraordinary will attend his declaring himself my
sisters admirer This declaration will certainly be made in form as
soon as the lover can pick up resolution enough to stand the brunt
of Mrs Tabbys disappointment for he is without doubt aware of her
designs upon his personThe particulars of the denouement you shall
know in due season mean while I am

To Dr LEWIS

DEAR LEWIS

The deceitful calm was of short duration I am plunged again in a sea of
vexation and the complaints in my stomach and bowels are returned so
that I suppose I shall be disabled from prosecuting the excursion I had
plannedWhat the devil had I to do to come a plague hunting with a
leash of females in my train Yesterday my precious sister who by
the bye has been for some time a professed methodist came into my
apartment attended by Mr Barton and desired an audience with a very
stately airBrother said she this gentleman has something to
propose which I flatter myself will be the more acceptable as it will
rid you of a troublesome companion Then Mr Barton proceeded to this
effectI am indeed extremely ambitious of being allied to your
family Mr Bramble and I hope you will see no cause to interpose your
authority As for authority said Tabby interrupting him with some
warmth I know of none that he has a right to use on this occasionIf
I pay him the compliment of making him acquainted with the step I intend
to take it is all he can expect in reasonThis is as much as I
believe he would do by me if he intended to change his own situation in
lifeIn a word brother I am so sensible of Mr Bartons extra ordinary
merit that I have been prevailed upon to alter my resolution of living
a single life and to put my happiness in his hands by vesting him with
a legal title to my person and fortune such as they are The business
at present is to have the writings drawn and I shall be obliged to
you if you will recommend a lawyer to me for that purpose

You may guess what an effect this overture had upon me who from the
information of my nephew expected that Barton was to make a formal
declaration of his passion for Liddy I could not help gazing in silent
astonishment alternately at Tabby and her supposed admirer who last
hung his head in the most aukward confusion for a few minutes and then
retired on pretence of being suddenly seized with a vertigoMrs Tabitha
affected much concern and would have had him make use of a bed in the
house but he insisted upon going home that he might have recourse
of some drops which he kept for such emergencies and his innamorata
acquiescedIn the mean time I was exceedingly puzzled at this adventure
though I suspected the truth and did not know in what manner to demean
myself towards Mrs Tabitha when Jery came in and told me he had just
seen Mr Barton alight from his chariot at lady Griskins doorThis
incident seemed to threaten a visit from her ladyship with which we
were honoured accordingly in less than half an hourI find said she
there has been a match of cross purposes among you good folks and
Im come to set you to rightsSo saying she presented me with the
following billet

DEAR SIR

I no sooner recollected myself from the extreme confusion I was thrown
into by that unlucky mistake of your sister than I thought it my duty
to assure you that my devoirs to Mrs Bramble never exceeded the bounds
of ordinary civility and that my heart is unalterably fixed upon Miss
Liddy Melford as I had the honour to declare to her brother when he
questioned me upon that subjectLady Griskin has been so good as to
charge herself not only with the delivery of this note but also with
the task of undeceiving Mrs Bramble for whom I have the most profound
respect and veneration though my affection being otherwise engaged is
no longer in the power of

Sir Your very humble servant RALPH BARTON

Having cast my eyes over this billet I told her ladyship that I would
no longer retard the friendly office she had undertaken and I and
Jery forthwith retired into another room There we soon perceived the
conversation grow very warm betwixt the two ladies and at length
could distinctly hear certain terms of altercation which we could no
longer delay interrupting with any regard to decorum When we entered
the scene of contention we found Liddy had joined the disputants and
stood trembling betwixt them as if she had been afraid they would have
proceeded to something more practical than words Lady Griskins
face was like the full moon in a storm of wind glaring fiery
and portentous while Tabby looked grim and ghastly with an aspect
breathing discord and dismayOur appearance put a stop to their mutual
revilings but her ladyship turning to me Cousin said she I cant
help saying I have met with a very ungrateful return from this lady for
the pains I have taken to serve her familyMy family is much obliged
to your ladyship cried Tabby with a kind of hysterical giggle but
we have no right to the good offices of such an honourable gobetween
But for all that good Mrs Tabitha Bramble resumed the other I
shall be content with the reflection That virtue is its own reward
and it shall not be my fault if you continue to make yourself
ridiculousMr Bramble who has no little interest of his own to serve
will no doubt contribute all in his power to promote a match
betwixt Mr Barton and his niece which will be equally honourable and
advantageous and I dare say Miss Liddy herself will have no objection
to a measure so well calculated to make her happy in lifeI beg your
ladyships pardon exclaimed Liddy with great vivacity I have nothing
but misery to expect from such a measure and I hope my guardians
will have too much compassion to barter my peace of mind for any
consideration of interest or fortuneUpon my word Miss Liddy said
she you have profited by the example of your good auntI comprehend
your meaning and will explain it when I have a proper opportunityIn
the mean time I shall take my leaveMadam your most obedient and
devoted humble servant said she advancing close up to my sister and
curtsying so low that I thought she intended to squat herself down on
the floorThis salutation Tabby returned with equal solemnity and
the expression of the two faces while they continued in this attitude
would be no bad subject for a pencil like that of the incomparable
Hogarth if any such should ever appear again in these times of
dullness and degeneracy

Jery accompanied her ladyship to her house that he might have an
opportunity to restore the etuis to Barton and advise him to give
up his suit which was so disagreeable to his sister against whom
however he returned much irritatedLady Griskin had assured him that
Liddys heart was preoccupied and immediately the idea of Wilson
recurring to his imagination his familypride took the alarm He
denounced vengeance against the adventurer and was disposed to be
very peremptory with his sister but I desired he would suppress his
resentment until I should have talked with her in private

The poor girl when I earnestly pressed her on this head owned with
a flood of tears that Wilson had actually come to the Hot Well at
Bristol and even introduced himself into our lodgings as a Jew pedlar
but that nothing had passed betwixt them further than her begging him
to withdraw immediately if he had any regard for her peace of mind
that he had disappeared accordingly after having attempted to prevail
upon my sisters maid to deliver a letter which however she refused
to receive though she had consented to carry a message importing that
he was a gentleman of a good family and that in a very little time he
would avow his passion in that characterShe confessed that although
he had not kept his word in this particular he was not yet altogether
indifferent to her affection but solemnly promised she would never
carry on any correspondence with him or any other admirer for the
future without the privity and approbation of her brother and me

By this declaration she made her own peace with Jery but the
hotheaded boy is more than ever incensed against Wilson whom he now
considers as an impostor that harbours some infamous design upon the
honour of his familyAs for Barton he was not a little mortified to
find his present returned and his addresses so unfavourably received
but he is not a man to be deeply affected by such disappointments and
I know not whether he is not as well pleased with being discarded
by Liddy as he would have been with a permission to prosecute his
pretensions at the risque of being every day exposed to the revenge or
machinations of Tabby who is not to be slighted with impunityI
had not much time to moralize on these occurrences for the house
was visited by a constable and his gang with a warrant from Justice
Buzzard to search the box of Humphry Clinker my footmanwho was just
apprehended as a highwayman This incident threw the whole family into
confusion My sister scolded the constable for presuming to enter the
lodgings of a gentleman on such an errand without having first asked
and obtained permission her maid was frightened into fits and Liddy
shed tears of compassion for the unfortunate Clinker in whose box
however nothing was found to confirm the suspicion of robbery

For my own part I made no doubt of the fellows being mistaken for some
other person and I went directly to the justice in order to procure
his discharge but there I found the matter much more serious than
I expectedPoor Clinker stood trembling at the bar surrounded by
thieftakers and at a little distance a thick squat fellow a
postilion his accuser who had seized him on the street and swore
positively to his person that the said Clinker had on the 15th day of
March last on Blackheath robbed a gentleman in a postchaise which
he the postilion droveThis deposition was sufficient to justify his
commitment and he was sent accordingly to Clerkenwell prison whither
Jery accompanied him in the coach in order to recommend him properly to
the keeper that he may want for no convenience which the place affords

The spectators who assembled to see this highwayman were sagacious
enough to discern something very villainous in his aspect which
begging their pardon is the very picture of simplicity and the
justice himself put a very unfavourable construction upon some of his
answers which he said savoured of the ambiguity and equivocation of
an old offender but in my opinion it would have been more just and
humane to impute them to the confusion into which we may suppose a poor
country lad to be thrown on such an occasion I am still persuaded he is
innocent and in this persuasion I can do no less than use my utmost
endeavours that he may not be oppressedI shall tomorrow send my
nephew to wait on the gentleman who was robbed and beg he will have
the humanity to go and see the prisoner that in case he should find
him quite different from the person of the highwayman he may bear
testimony in his behalfHowsoever it may fare with Clinker this cursed
affair will be to me productive of intolerable chagrinI have already
caught a dreadful cold by rushing into the open air from the justices
parlour where I had been stewing in the crowd and though I should not
be laid up with the gout as I believe I shall I must stay at London
for some weeks till this poor devil comes to his trial at Rochester so
that in all probability my northern expedition is blown up

If you can find any thing in your philosophical budget to console me
in the midst of these distresses and apprehensions pray let it be
communicated to

Your unfortunate friend MATT BRAMBLE LONDON June 12




To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR WAT

The farce is finished and another piece of a graver cast brought upon
the stageOur aunt made a desperate attack upon Barton who had no
other way of saving himself but by leaving her in possession of
the field and avowing his pretensions to Liddy by whom he has been
rejected in his turnLady Griskin acted as his advocate and agent on
this occasion with such zeal as embroiled her with Mrs Tabitha and a
high scene of altercation passed betwixt these two religionists which
might have come to action had not my uncle interposed They are however
reconciled in consequence of an event which hath involved us all in
trouble and disquiet You must know the poor preacher Humphry Clinker
is now exercising his ministry among the felons in Clerkenwell prisonA
postilion having sworn a robbery against him no bail could be taken
and he was committed to jail notwithstanding all the remonstrances and
interest my uncle could make in his behalf

All things considered the poor fellow cannot possibly be guilty
and yet I believe he runs some risque of being hanged Upon his
examination he answered with such hesitation and reserve as persuaded
most of the people who crowded the place that he was really a knave
and the justices remarks confirmed their opinion Exclusive of my uncle
and myself there was only one person who seemed inclined to favour
the culpritHe was a young man well dressed and from the manner in
which he crossexamined the evidence we took it for granted that
he was a student in one of the inns of courtHe freely checked the
justice for some uncharitable inferences he made to the prejudice of
the prisoner and even ventured to dispute with his worship on certain
points of law

My uncle provoked at the unconnected and dubious answers of Clinker
who seemed in danger of falling a sacrifice to his own simplicity
exclaimed In the name of God if you are innocent say so No cried
he God forbid that I should call myself innocent while my conscience
is burthened with sin What then you did commit this robbery
resumed his master No sure said he blessed be the Lord Im free of
that guilt

Here the justice interposed observing that the man seemed inclined to
make a discovery by turning kings evidence and desired the clerk to
take his confession upon which Humphry declared that he looked upon
confession to be a popish fraud invented by the whore of Babylon The
Templar affirmed that the poor fellow was non compos and exhorted the
justice to discharge him as a lunaticYou know very well added he
that the robbery in question was not committed by the prisoner

The thieftakers grinned at one another and Mr Justice Buzzard
replied with great emotion Mr Martin I desire you will mind your
own business I shall convince you one of these days that I understand
mine In short there was no remedy the mittimus was made out
and poor Clinker sent to prison in a hackneycoach guarded by the
constable and accompanied by your humble servant By the way I was not
a little surprised to hear this retainer to justice bid the prisoner to
keep up his spirits for that he did not at all doubt but that he would
get off for a few weeks confinementHe said his worship knew very well
that Clinker was innocent of the fact and that the real highwayman who
robbed the chaise was no other than that very individual Mr Martin who
had pleaded so strenuously for honest Humphry

Confounded at this information I asked Why then is he suffered to
go about at his liberty and this poor innocent fellow treated as a
malefactor We have exact intelligence of all Mr Martins transactions
said he but as yet there is not evidence sufficient for his
conviction and as for this young man the justice could do no less than
commit him as the postilion swore pointblank to his identity So
if this rascally postilion should persist in the falsity to which he is
sworn said I this innocent lad may be brought to the gallows

The constable observed that he would have time enough to prepare
for his trial and might prove an alibi or perhaps Martin might be
apprehended and convicted for another fact in which case he might be
prevailed upon to take this affair upon himself or finally if these
chances should fail and the evidence stand good against Clinker
the jury might recommend him to mercy in consideration of his youth
especially if this should appear to be the first fact of which he had
been guilty

Humphry owned he could not pretend to recollect where he had been on the
day when the robbery was committed much less prove a circumstance of
that kind so far back as six months though he knew he had been sick
of the fever and ague which however did not prevent him from going
aboutthen turning up his eyes he ejaculated The Lords will be
done if it be my fate to suffer I hope I shall not disgrace the faith
of which though unworthy I make profession

When I expressed my surprize that the accuser should persist in charging
Clinker without taking the least notice of the real robber who
stood before him and to whom indeed Humphry bore not the smallest
resemblance the constable who was himself a thieftaker gave me to
understand that Mr Martin was the best qualified for business of all
the gentlemen on the road he had ever known that he had always acted on
his own bottom without partner or correspondent and never went to work
but when he was cool and sober that his courage and presence of mind
never failed him that his address was genteel and his behaviour void
of all cruelty and insolence that he never encumbered himself with
watches or trinkets nor even with banknotes but always dealt for
ready money and that in the current coin of the kingdom and that he
could disguise himself and his horse in such a manner that after
the action it was impossible to recognize either the one or the
otherThis great man said he has reigned paramount in all the roads
within fifty miles of London above fifteen months and has done more
business in that time than all the rest of the profession put together
for those who pass through his hands are so delicately dealt with that
they have no desire to give him the least disturbance but for all that
his race is almost runhe is now fluttering about justice like a moth
about a candlethere are so many limetwigs laid in his way that Ill
bet a cool hundred he swings before Christmas

Shall I own to you that this portrait drawn by a ruffian heightened
by what I myself had observed in his deportment has interested me
warmly in the fate of poor Martin whom nature seems to have intended
for a useful and honourable member of that community upon which he now
preys for subsistence It seems he lived some time as a clerk to a
timbermerchant whose daughter Martin having privately married was
discarded and his wife turned out of doors She did not long survive
her marriage and Martin turning fortunehunter could not supply his
occasions any other way than by taking to the road in which he
has travelled hitherto with uncommon successHe pays his respects
regularly to Mr Justice Buzzard the thiefcatchergeneral of this
metropolis and sometimes they smoke a pipe together very lovingly
when the conversation generally turns upon the nature of evidenceThe
justice has given him fair warning to take care of himself and he has
received his caution in good partHitherto he has baffled all the
vigilance art and activity of Buzzard and his emissaries with
such conduct as would have done honour to the genius of a Caesar or
a Turenne but he has one weakness which has proved fatal to all the
heroes of his tribe namely an indiscreet devotion to the fair sex and
in all probability he will be attacked on this defenceless quarter

Be that as it may I saw the body of poor Clinker consigned to the
gaoler of Clerkenwell to whose indulgence I recommended him so
effectually that he received him in the most hospitable manner though
there was a necessity for equipping him with a suit of irons in which
he made a very rueful appearance The poor creature seemed as much
affected by my uncles kindness as by his own misfortune When I
assured him that nothing should be left undone for procuring his
enlargement and making his confinement easy in the mean time he fell
down on his knees and kissing my hand which he bathed with his tears
0 squire cried he sobbing what shall I sayI cantno I cant
speakmy poor heart is bursting with gratitude to you and my deardear
generousnoble benefactor

I protest the scene became so pathetic that I was fain to force myself
away and returned to my uncle who sent me in the afternoon with
a compliment to one Mr Mead the person who had been robbed on
Blackheath As I did not find him at home I left a message in
consequence of which he called at our lodgings this morning and very
humanely agreed to visit the prisoner By this time lady Griskin had
come to make her formal compliments of condolance to Mrs Tabitha on
this domestic calamity and that prudent maiden whose passion was
now cooled thought proper to receive her ladyship so civilly that a
reconciliation immediately ensued These two ladies resolved to comfort
the poor prisoner in their own persons and Mr Mead and I squired
them to Clerkenwell my uncle being detained at home by some slight
complaints in his stomach and bowels

The turnkey who received us at Clerkenwell looked remarkably sullen
and when we enquired for Clinker I dont care if the devil had him
said he here has been nothing but canting and praying since the
fellow entered the placeRabbit him the tap will be ruinedwe hant
sold a cask of beer nor a dozen of wine since he paid his garnishthe
gentlemen get drunk with nothing but your damned religionFor my part
I believe as how your man deals with the devilTwo or three as bold
hearts as ever took the air upon Hounslow have been blubbering all
night and if the fellow ant speedily removed by Habeas Corpus or
otherwise Ill be damnd if theres a grain of true spirit left within
these walls we shant have a soul to do credit to the place or make his
exit like a true born Englishmandamn my eyes there will be nothing
but snivelling in the cartwe shall all die like so many psalmsinging
weavers

In short we found that Humphry was at that very instant haranguing
the felons in the chapel and that the gaolers wife and daughter
together with my aunts woman Win Jenkins and our housemaid were
among the audience which we immediately joined I never saw any thing
so strongly picturesque as this congregation of felons clanking their
chains in the midst of whom stood orator Clinker expatiating in a
transport of fervor on the torments of hell denounced in scripture
against evildoers comprehending murderers robbers thieves and
whore mongers The variety of attention exhibited in the faces of those
ragamuffins formed a groupe that would not have disgraced the pencil of
a Raphael In one it denoted admiration in another doubt in a
third disdain in a fourth contempt in a fifth terror in a sixth
derision and in a seventh indignationAs for Mrs Winifred Jenkins
she was in tears overwhelmed with sorrow but whether for her own sins
or the misfortune of Clinker I cannot pretend to say The other females
seemed to listen with a mixture of wonder and devotion The gaolers
wife declared he was a saint in trouble saying she wished from her
heart there was such another good soul like him in every gaol in
England

Mr Mead having earnestly surveyed the preacher declared his appearance
was so different from that of the person who robbed him on Blackheath
that he could freely make oath he was not the man but Humphry himself
was by this time pretty well rid of all apprehensions of being hanged
for he had been the night before solemnly tried and acquitted by his
fellow prisoners some of whom he had already converted to methodism
He now made proper acknowledgments for the honour of our visit and was
permitted to kiss the hands of the ladies who assured him he might
depend upon their friendship and protection Lady Griskin in her
great zeal exhorted his fellowprisoners to profit by the precious
opportunity of having such a saint in bonds among them and turn over a
new leaf for the benefit of their poor souls and that her admonition
might have the greater effect she reinforced it with her bounty

While she and Mrs Tabby returned in the coach with the two maidservants
I waited on Mr Mead to the house of justice Buzzard who having heard
his declaration said his oath could be of no use at present but that
he would be a material evidence for the prisoner at his trial so that
there seems to be no remedy but patience for poor Clinker and indeed
the same virtue or medicine will be necessary for us all the
squire in particular who had set his heart upon his excursion to the
northward

While we were visiting honest Humphry in Clerkenwell prison my uncle
received a much more extraordinary visit at his own lodgings Mr Martin
of whom I have made such honourable mention desired permission to pay
him his respects and was admitted accordingly He told him that
having observed him at Mr Buzzards a good deal disturbed by what had
happened to his servant he had come to assure him he had nothing to
apprehend for Clinkers life for if it was possible that any jury
could find him guilty upon such evidence he Martin himself would
produce in court a person whose deposition would bring him off clear as
the sun at noonSure the fellow would not be so romantic as to
take the robbery upon himselfHe said the postilion was an infamous
fellow who had been a dabbler in the same profession and saved his
life at the Old Bailey by impeaching his companions that being now
reduced to great poverty he had made this desperate push to swear
away the life of an innocent man in hopes of having the reward upon his
conviction but that he would find himself miserably disappointed for
the justice and his myrmidons were determined to admit of no interloper
in this branch of business and that he did not at all doubt but that
they would find matter enough to shop the evidence himself before the
next gaoldelivery He affirmed that all these circumstances were well
known to the justice and that his severity to Clinker was no other
than a hint to his master to make him a present in private as an
acknowledgment of his candour and humanity

This hint however was so unpalatable to Mr Bramble that he declared
with great warmth he would rather confine himself for life to
London which he detested than be at liberty to leave it tomorrow in
consequence of encouraging corruption in a magistrate Hearing however
how favourable Mr Meads report had been for the prisoner he is
resolved to take the advice of counsel in what manner to proceed for his
immediate enlargement I make no doubt but that in a day or two this
troublesome business may be discussed and in this hope we are preparing
for our journey If our endeavours do not miscarry we shall have taken
the field before you hear again from

Yours J MELFORD LONDON June 11




To Dr LEWIS

Thank Heaven dear Lewis the clouds are dispersed and I have now the
clearest prospect of my summer campaign which I hope I shall be able
to begin tomorrow I took the advice of counsel with respect to the
case of Clinker in whose favour a lucky incident has intervened
The fellow who accused him has had his own battery turned upon
himselfTwo days ago he was apprehended for a robbery on the highway
and committed on the evidence of an accomplice Clinker having moved
for a writ of habeas corpus was brought before the lord chief justice
who in consequence of an affidavit of the gentleman who had been
robbed importing that the said Clinker was not the person who stopped
him on the highway as well as in consideration of the postilions
character and present circumstances was pleased to order that
my servant should be admitted to bail and he has been discharged
accordingly to the unspeakable satisfaction of our whole family to
which he has recommended himself in an extraordinary manner not only by
his obliging deportment but by his talents of preaching praying and
singing psalms which he has exercised with such effect that even Tabby
respects him as a chosen vessel If there was any thing like affectation
or hypocrisy in this excess of religion I would not keep him in
my service but so far as I can observe the fellows character is
downright simplicity warmed with a kind of enthusiasm which renders
him very susceptible of gratitude and attachment to his benefactors

As he is an excellent horseman and understands farriery I have bought
a stout gelding for his use that he may attend us on the road and have
an eye to our cattle in case the coachman should not mind his business
My nephew who is to ride his own saddlehorse has taken upon trial
a servant just come from abroad with his former master Sir William
Strollop who vouches for his honesty The fellow whose name is Dutton
seems to be a petit maitreHe has got a smattering of French bows
and grins and shrugs and takes snuff a la mode de France but values
himself chiefly upon his skill and dexterity in hairdressingIf I
am not much deceived by appearance he is in all respects the very
contrast of Humphry Clinker

My sister has made up matters with lady Griskin though I must own I
should not have been sorry to see that connexion entirely destroyed but
Tabby is not of a disposition to forgive Barton who I understand
is gone to his seat in Berkshire for the summer season I cannot help
suspecting that in the treaty of peace which has been lately ratified
betwixt those two females it is stipulated that her ladyship shall
use her best endeavours to provide an agreeable helpmate for our sister
Tabitha who seems to be quite desperate in her matrimonial designs
Perhaps the matchmaker is to have a valuable consideration in the way
of brokerage which she will most certainly deserve if she can find
any man in his senses who will yoke with Mrs Bramble from motives of
affection or interest

I find my spirits and my health affect each other reciprocally that is
to say every thing that discomposes my mind produces a correspondent
disorder in my body and my bodily complaints are remarkably
mitigated by those considerations that dissipate the clouds of mental
chagrinThe imprisonment of Clinker brought on those symptoms which
I mentioned in my last and now they are vanished at his dischargeIt
must be owned indeed I took some of the tincture of ginseng prepared
according to your prescription and found it exceedingly grateful to
the stomach but the pain and sickness continued to return after short
intervals till the anxiety of my mind was entirely removed and then I
found myself perfectly at case We have had fair weather these ten days
to the astonishment of the Londoners who think it portentous If you
enjoy the same indulgence in Wales I hope Barns has got my hay made
and safe cocked by this time As we shall be in motion for some weeks
I cannot expect to hear from you as usual but I shall continue to write
from every place at which we make any halt that you may know our track
in case it should be necessary to communicate any thing to

DEAR MARY

Having the occasion of my cousin Jenkins of Abergany I send you as
a token a turkeyshell comb a kiple of yards of green ribbon and a
sarment upon the nothingness of good works which was preached in the
Tabernacle and you will also receive a hornbuck for Saul whereby she
may learn her letters for Fin much consarned about the state of her
poor soleand what are all the pursuits of this life to the consarns of
that immortal partWhat is life but a veil of affliction O Mary the
whole family have been in such a constipationMr Clinker has been in
trouble but the gates of hell have not been able to prevail again him
His virtue is like poor gould seven times tried in the fire He was
tuck up for a rubbery and had before gustass Busshard who made his
mittamouse and the pore youth was sent to prison upon the false oaf of
a willian that wanted to sware his life away for the looker of cain

The squire did all in his power but could not prevent his being put
in chains and confined among common manufactors where he stood like
an innocent sheep in the midst of wolves and tygersLord knows what
mought have happened to this pyehouse young man if master had not
applied to Apias Korkus who lives with the ould bailiff and is they
say five hundred years old God bless us and a congeror but if he
be sure I am he dont deal with the devil otherwise he couldnt have
fought out Mr Clinker as he did in spite of stone walls iron bolts
and double locks that flew open at his command for ould Scratch has
not a greater enemy upon hearth than Mr Clinker who is indeed a very
powerful labourer in the Lords vineyard I do no more than yuse the
words of my good lady who has got the infectual calling and I
trust that even myself though unworthy shall find grease to be
exceptedMiss Liddy has been touchd to the quick but is a little
timorsome howsomever I make no doubt but she and all of us will be
brought by the endeavours of Mr Clinker to produce blessed fruit of
generation and repentanceAs for master and the young squire they
have as yet had narro glimpse of the new lightI doubt as how their
harts are hardened by worldly wisdom which as the pyebill saith is
foolishness in the sight of God

O Mary Jones pray without seizing for grease to prepare you for
the operations of this wonderful instrument which I hope will
be exorcised this winter upon you and others at Brambletonhall
Tomorrow we are to set out in a cox and four for Yorkshire and I
believe we shall travel that way far and far and farther than I can
tell but I shant go so far as to forget my friends and Mary Jones
will always be remembered as one of them by her


Humble sarvant WIN JENKINS LONDON June 14




To Mrs GWYLLIM housekeeper at Brambletonhall MRS GWYLLIM

I cant help thinking it very strange that I never had an answer to the
letter I wrote you some weeks ago from Bath concerning the sour bear
the gander and the maids eating butter which I wont allow to be
wastedWe are now going upon a long journey to the north whereby I
desire you will redouble your care and circumflexion that the family
may be well managed in our absence for you know you must render
account not only to your earthly master but also to him that is above
and if you are found a good and faithful sarvant great will be your
reward in haven I hope there will be twenty stun of cheese ready for
marketby the time I get huom and as much owl spun as will make half
a dozen pair of blankets and that the savings of the buttermilk will
fetch me a good penny before Martinmass as the two pigs are to be fed
for baking with bitchmast and acrons

I wrote to doctor Lews for the same porpuss but he never had the good
manners to take the least notice of my letter for which reason I shall
never favour him with another though he beshits me on his bended knees
You will do well to keep a watchful eye over the hind Villiams who is
one of his amissories and I believe no better than he should be at
bottom God forbid that I should lack christian charity but charity
begins at huom and sure nothing can be a more charitable work than to
rid the family of such vermine I do suppose that the bindled cow has

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR PHILLIPS

The very day after I wrote my last Clinker was set at liberty As
Martin had foretold the accuser was himself committed for a robbery
upon unquestionable evidence He had been for some time in the snares of
the thieftaking society who resenting his presumption in attempting
to incroach upon their monopoly of impeachment had him taken up and
committed to Newgate on the deposition of an accomplice who has been
admitted as evidence for the king The postilion being upon record as an
old offender the chief justice made no scruple of admitting Clinker to
bail when he perused the affidavit of Mr Mead importing that the said
Clinker was not the person that robbed him on Blackheath and honest
Humphry was discharged When he came home he expressed great eagerness
to pay his respects to his master and here his elocution failed him
but his silence was pathetic he fell down at his feet and embraced his
knees shedding a flood of tears which my uncle did not see without
emotion He took snuff in some confusion and putting his hand in
his pocket gave him his blessing in something more substantial than
wordsClinker said he I am so well convinced both of your honesty
and courage that I am resolved to make you my lifeguardman on the
highway

He was accordingly provided with a case of pistols and a carbine to be
flung across his shoulders and every other preparation being made we
set out last Thursday at seven in the morning my uncle with the three
women in the coach Humphry well mounted on a black gelding bought for
his use myself ahorseback attended by my new valet Mr Dutton
an exceeding coxcomb fresh from his travels whom I have taken upon
trialThe fellow wears a solitaire uses paint and takes rappee with
all the grimace of a French marquis At present however he is in a
ridingdress jackboots leather breeches a scarlet waistcoat with
gold binding a laced hat a hanger a French postingwhip in his hand
and his hair en queue

Before we had gone nine miles my horse lost one of his shoes so that I
was obliged to stop at Barnet to have another while the coach proceeded
at an easy pace over the common About a mile short of Hatfield the
postilions stopping the carriage gave notice to Clinker that there
were two suspicious fellows ahorseback at the end of a lane who
semed waiting to attack the coach Humphry forthwith apprised my uncle
declaring he would stand by him to the last drop of his blood and
unflinging his carbine prepared for action The squire had pistols in
the pockets of the coach and resolved to make use of them directly
but he was effectually prevented by his female companions who flung
themselves about his neck and screamed in concertAt that instant
who should come up at a handgallop but Martin the highwayman who
advancing to the coach begged the ladies would compose themselves for
a moment then desiring Clinker to follow him to the charge he pulled a
pistol out of his bosom and they rode up together to give battle to the
rogues who having fired at a great distance fled across the common
They were in pursuit of the fugitives when I came up not a little
alarmed at the shrieks in the coach where I found my uncle in a violent
rage without his periwig struggling to disentangle himself from Tabby
and the other two and swearing with great vociferation Before I had
time to interpose Martin and Clinker returned from the pursuit and
the former payed his compliments with great politeness giving us to
understand that the fellows had scampered off and that he believed
they were a couple of raw prentices from London He commended Clinker
for his courage and said if we would give him leave he would have the
honour to accompany us as far as Stevenage where he had some business

The squire having recollected and adjusted himself was the first
to laugh at his own situation but it was not without difficulty that
Tabbys arms could be untwisted from his neck Liddys teeth chattered
and Jenkins was threatened with a fit as usual I had communicated to my
uncle the character of Martin as it was described by the constable and
he was much struck with its singularityHe could not suppose the fellow
had any design on our company which was so numerous and well armed he
therefore thanked him for the service he had just done them said he
would be glad of his company and asked him to dine with us at Hatfield
This invitation might not have been agreeable to the ladies had they
known the real profession of our guest but this was a secret to all
except my uncle and myself Mrs Tabitha however would by no means
consent to proceed with a case of loaded pistols in the coach and they
were forthwith discharged in complaisance to her and the rest of the
women

Being gratified in this particular she became remarkably goodhumoured
and at dinner behaved in the most affable manner to Mr Martin with
whose polite address and agreeable conversation she seemed to be much
taken After dinner the landlord accosting me in the yard asked with a
significant look if the gentleman that rode the sorrel belonged to our
companyI understand his meaning but answered no that he had come
up with us on the common and helped us to drive away two fellows that
looked like highwaymenHe nodded three times distinctly as much as to
say he knows his cue Then he inquired if one of those men was mounted
on a bay mare and the other on a chestnut gelding with a white streak
down his forehead and being answered in the affirmative he assured me
they had robbed three postchaises this very morningI inquired in my
turn if Mr Martin was of his acquaintance and nodding thrice again
he answered that he had seen the gentleman

Before we left Hatfield my uncle fixing his eyes on Martin with such
expression as is more easily conceived than described asked if he
often travelled that road and he replied with a look which denoted his
understanding the question that he very seldom did business in that
part of the country In a word this adventurer favoured us with his
company to the neighbourhood of Stevenage where he took his leave of
the coach and me in very polite terms and turned off upon a crossroad
that led to a village on the leftAt supper Mrs Tabby was very full
in the praise of Mr Martins goodsense and goodbreeding and seemed
to regret that she had not a further opportunity to make some experiment
upon his affection In the morning my uncle was not a little surprised
to receive from the waiter a billet couched in these words


SIR

I could easily perceive from your looks when I had the honour to
converse with you at Hatfield that my character is not unknown to you
and I dare say you wont think it strange that I should be glad to
change my present way of life for any other honest occupation let it
be ever so humble that will afford me bread in moderation and sleep
in safetyPerhaps you may think I flatter when I say that from the
moment I was witness to your generous concern in the cause of your
servant I conceived a particular esteem and veneration for your person
and yet what I say is true I should think myself happy if I could
be admitted into your protection and service as housesteward clerk
butler or bailiff for either of which places I think myself tolerably
well qualified and sure I am I should not be found deficient in
gratitude and fidelityAt the same time I am very sensible how much
you must deviate from the common maxims of discretion even in putting
my professions to the trial but I dont look upon you as a person that
thinks in the ordinary stile and the delicacy of my situation will
I know justify this address to a heart warmed with beneficence and
compassionUnderstanding you are going pretty far north I shall take
an opportunity to throw myself in your way again before you reach the
borders of Scotland and I hope by that time you will have taken into
consideration the truly distressful case of

honoured sir your very humble and devoted servant EDWARD MARTIN

The squire having perused this letter put it into my hand without
saying a syllable and when I had read it we looked at each other in
silence From a certain sparkling in his eyes I discovered there was
more in his heart than he cared to express with his tongue in favour
of poor Martin and this was precisely my own feeling which he did not
fail to discern by the same means of communicationWhat shall we
do said he to save this poor sinner from the gallows and make him
a useful member of the commonwealth and yet the proverb says Save a
thief from the gallows and hell cut your throat I told him I really
believed Martin was capable of giving the proverb the lie and that
I should heartily concur in any step he might take in favour of his
solicitation We mutually resolved to deliberate upon the subject
and in the mean time proceeded on our journey The roads having been
broken up by the heavy rains in the spring were so rough that although
we travelled very slowly the jolting occasioned such pain to my uncle
that he was become exceedingly peevish when we arrived at this place
which lies about eight miles from the postroad between Wetherby and
Boroughbridge

Harrigatewater so celebrated for its efficacy in the scurvy and other
distempers is supplied from a copious spring in the hollow of a
wild common round which a good many houses have been built for the
convenience of the drinkers though few of them are inhabited Most of
the company lodge at some distance in five separate inns situated in
different parts of the commons from whence they go every morning to the
well in their own carriages The lodgers of each inn form a distinct
society that eat together and there is a commodious public room where
they breakfast in disabille at separate tables from eight oclock till
eleven as they chance or chuse to come inHere also they drink tea in
the afternoon and play at cards or dance in the evening One custom
however prevails which I looked upon as a solecism in politeness The
ladies treat with tea in their turns and even girls of sixteen are
not exempted from this shameful impositionThere is a public ball by
subscription every night at one of the houses to which all the company
from the others are admitted by tickets and indeed Harrigate treads
upon the heels of Bath in the articles of gaiety and dissipationwith
this difference however that here we are more sociable and familiar
One of the inns is already full up to the very garrets having no less
than fifty lodgers and as many servants Our family does not exceed
thirtysix and I should be sorry to see the number augmented as our
accommodations wont admit of much increase

At present the company is more agreeable than one could expect from
an accidental assemblage of persons who are utter strangers to one
anotherThere seems to be a general disposition among us to maintain
goodfellowship and promote the purposes of humanity in favour of
those who come hither on the score of health I see several faces which
we left at Bath although the majority are of the Northern counties
and many come from Scotland for the benefit of these watersIn such a
variety there must be some originals among whom Mrs Tabitha Bramble is
not the most inconsiderableNo place where there is such an intercourse
between the sexes can be disagreeable to a lady of her views and
temperamentShe has had some warm disputes at table with a lame parson
from Northumberland on the new birth and the insignificance of moral
virtue and her arguments have been reinforced by an old Scotch lawyer
in a rye periwig who though he has lost his teeth and the use of his
limbs can still wag his tongue with great volubility He has paid her
such fulsome compliments upon her piety and learning as seem to have
won her heart and she in her turn treats him with such attention as
indicates a design upon his person but by all accounts he is too
much of a fox to be inveigled into any snare that she can lay for his
affection

We do not propose to stay long at Harrigate though at present it is
our headquarters from whence we shall make some excursions to
visit two or three of our rich relations who are settled in this
countryPray remember me to all our friends of Jesus and allow me to
be still

Yours affectionately J MELFORD HARRIGATE June 23




To Dr LEWIS

DEAR DOCTOR

Considering the tax we pay for turnpikes the roads of this county
constitute a most intolerable grievance Between Newark and Weatherby
I have suffered more from jolting and swinging than ever I felt in the
whole course of my life although the carriage is remarkably commodious
and well hung and the postilions were very careful in driving I am now
safely housed at the New Inn at Harrigate whither I came to satisfy
my curiosity rather than with any view of advantage to my health and
truly after having considered all the parts and particulars of the
place I cannot account for the concourse of people one finds here upon
any other principle but that of caprice which seems to be the character
of our nation

Harrigate is a wild common bare and bleak without tree or shrub or
the least signs of cultivation and the people who come to drink the
water are crowded together in paltry inns where the few tolerable
rooms are monopolized by the friends and favourites of the house and
all the rest of the lodgers are obliged to put up with dirty holes
where there is neither space air nor convenience My apartment is
about ten feet square and when the folding bed is down there is just
room sufficient to pass between it and the fire One might expect
indeed that there would be no occasion for a fire at Midsummer but
here the climate is so backward that an ash tree which our landlord
has planted before my window is just beginning to put forth its leaves
and I am fain to have my bed warmed every night

As for the water which is said to have effected so many surprising
cures I have drank it once and the first draught has cured me of all
desire to repeat the medicineSome people say it smells of rotten
eggs and others compare it to the scourings of a foul gunIt is
generally supposed to be strongly impregnated with sulphur and Dr Shaw
in his book upon mineral water says he has seen flakes of sulphur
floating in the wellPace tanti viri I for my part have never
observed any thing like sulphur either in or about the well neither do
I find that any brimstone has ever been extracted from the water As
for the smell if I may be allowed to judge from my own organs it is
exactly that of bilgewater and the saline taste of it seems to declare
that it is nothing else than salt water putrified in the bowels of the
earth I was obliged to hold my nose with one hand while I advanced the
glass to my mouth with the other and after I had made shift to swallow
it my stomach could hardly retain what it had receivedThe only
effects it produced were sickness griping and insurmountable
disgustI can hardly mention it without pukingThe world is
strangely misled by the affectation of singularity I cannot help
suspecting that this water owes its reputation in a great measure
to its being so strikingly offensiveOn the same kind of analogy a
German doctor has introduced hemlock and other poisons as specifics
into the materia medicaI am persuaded that all the cures ascribed
to the Harrigate water would have been as efficaciously and infinitely
more agreeably performed by the internal and external use of seawater
Sure I am this last is much less nauseous to the taste and smell and
much more gentle in its operation as a purge as well as more extensive
in its medical qualities

Two days ago we went across the country to visit squire Burdock who
married a first cousin of my father an heiress who brought him an
estate of a thousand ayear This gentleman is a declared opponent
of the ministry in parliament and having an opulent fortune piques
himself upon living in the country and maintaining old English
hospitalityBy the bye this is a phrase very much used by the English
themselves both in words and writing but I never heard of it out of the
island except by way of irony and sarcasm What the hospitality of our
forefathers has been I should be glad to see recorded rather in the
memoirs of strangers who have visited our country and were the proper
objects and judges of such hospitality than in the discourse and
lucubrations of the modern English who seem to describe it from
theory and conjecture Certain it is we are generally looked upon by
foreigners as a people totally destitute of this virtue and I
never was in any country abroad where I did not meet with persons of
distinction who complained of having been inhospitably used in Great
Britain A gentleman of France Italy or Germany who has entertained
and lodged an Englishman at his house when he afterwards meets with
his guest at London is asked to dinner at the Saracenshead the
Turkshead the Boarshead or the Bear eats raw beef and butter
drinks execrable port and is allowed to pay his share of the reckoning

But to return from this digression which my feeling for the honour of
my country obliged me to makeour Yorkshire cousin has been a mighty
foxhunter before the Lord but now he is too fat and unwieldy to leap
ditches and fivebar gates nevertheless he still keeps a pack
of hounds which are well exercised and his huntsman every night
entertains him with the adventures of the days chace which he recites
in a tone and terms that are extremely curious and significant In the
mean time his broad brawn is scratched by one of his groomsThis
fellow it seems having no inclination to curry any beast out of the
stable was at great pains to scollop his nails in such a manner that
the blood followed at every strokeHe was in hopes that he would
be dismissed from this disagreeable office but the event turned out
contrary to his expectationHis master declared he was the best
scratcher in the family and now he will not suffer any other servant to
draw a nail upon his carcase

The squires lady is very proud without being stiff or inaccessible
She receives even her inferiors in point of fortune with a kind of
arrogant civility but then she thinks she has a right to treat them
with the most ungracious freedoms of speech and never fails to let
them know she is sensible of her own superior affluence In a word
she speaks well of no living soul and has not one single friend in
the world Her husband hates her mortally but although the brute is
sometimes so very powerful in him that he will have his own way he
generally truckles to her dominion and dreads like a schoolboy the
lash of her tongue On the other hand she is afraid of provoking him
too far lest he should make some desperate effort to shake off her
yokeShe therefore acquiesces in the proofs he daily gives of his
attachment to the liberty of an English freeholder by saying and doing
at his own table whatever gratifies the brutality of his disposition
or contributes to the case of his person The house though large is
neither elegant nor comfortableIt looks like a great inn crowded
with travellers who dine at the landlords ordinary where there is
a great profusion of victuals and drink but mine host seems to be
misplaced and I would rather dine upon filberts with a hermit than
feed upon venison with a hog The footmen might be aptly compared to the
waiters of a tavern if they were more serviceable and less rapacious
but they are generally insolent and inattentive and so greedy that I
think I can dine better and for less expence at the Star and Garter
in Pall mall than at our cousins castle in Yorkshire The squire is
not only accommodated with a wife but he is also blessed with an only
son about two and twenty just returned from Italy a complete fidler
and dillettante and he slips no opportunity of manifesting the most
perfect contempt for his own father

When we arrived there was a family of foreigners at the house on a
visit to this virtuoso with whom they had been acquainted at the Spa
it was the count de Melville with his lady on their way to Scotland
Mr Burdock had met with an accident in consequence of which both the
count and I would have retired but the young gentleman and his mother
insisted upon our staying dinner and their serenity seemed to be
so little ruffled by what had happened that we complied with their
invitation The squire had been brought home over night in his
postchaise so terribly belaboured about the pate that he seemed to
be in a state of stupefaction and had ever since remained speechless A
country apothecary called Grieve who lived in a neighbouring village
having been called to his assistance had let him blood and applied a
poultice to his head declaring that he had no fever nor any other bad
symptom but the loss of speech if he really had lost that faculty
But the young squire said this practitioner was an ignorantaccio that
there was a fracture in the cranium and that there was a necessity for
having him trepanned without loss of time His mother espousing this
opinion had sent an express to York for a surgeon to perform the
operation and he was already come with his prentice and instruments
Having examined the patients head he began to prepare his dressings
though Grieve still retained his first opinion that there was no
fracture and was the more confirmed in it as the squire had passed the
night in profound sleep uninterrupted by any catching or convulsion
The York surgeon said he could not tell whether there was a fracture
until he should take off the scalp but at any rate the operation
might be of service in giving vent to any blood that might be
extravasated either above or below the dura mater The lady and her son
were clear for trying the experiment and Grieve was dismissed with
some marks of contempt which perhaps he owed to the plainness of his
appearance He seemed to be about the middle age wore his own black
hair without any sort of dressing by his garb one would have taken
him for a quaker but he had none of the stiffness of that sect on the
contrary he was very submissive respectful and remarkably taciturn

Leaving the ladies in an apartment by themselves we adjourned to the
patients chamber where the dressings and instruments were displayed
in order upon a pewter dish The operator laying aside his coat and
periwig equipped himself with a nightcap apron and sleeves while
his prentice and footman seizing the squires head began to place
it in a proper postureBut mark what followedThe patient bolting
upright in the bed collared each of these assistants with the grasp of
Hercules exclaiming in a bellowing tone I hant lived so long in
Yorkshire to be trepanned by such vermin as you and leaping on the
floor put on his breeches quietly to the astonishment of us all The
Surgeon still insisted upon the operation alleging it was now plain
that the brain was injured and desiring the servants put him into
bed again but nobody would venture to execute his orders or even to
interpose when the squire turned him and his assistants out of doors
and threw his apparatus out at the window Having thus asserted his
prerogative and put on his cloaths with the help of a valet the count
with my nephew and me were introduced by his son and received with his
usual stile of rustic civility then turning to signor Macaroni with a
sarcastic grin I tell thee what Dick said he a mans scull is not
to be bored every time his head is broken and Ill convince thee and
thy mother that I know as many tricks as eer an old fox in the West
Riding

We afterwards understood he had quarrelled at a public house with an
exciseman whom he challenged to a bout at single stick in which he had
been worsted and that the shame of this defeat had tied up his tongue
As for madam she had shewn no concern for his disaster and now heard
of his recovery without emotionShe had taken some little notice of
my sister and niece though rather with a view to indulge her own
petulance than out of any sentiment of regard to our familyShe said
Liddy was a fright and ordered her woman to adjust her head before
dinner but she would not meddle with Tabby whose spirit she soon
perceived was not to be irritated with impunity At table she
acknowledged me so far as to say she had heard of my father though
she hinted that he had disobliged her family by making a poor match
in Wales She was disagreeably familiar in her enquiries about our
circumstances and asked if I intended to bring up my nephew to the
law I told her that as he had an independent fortune he should
follow no profession but that of a country gentleman and that I was not
without hopes of procuring for him a seat in parliamentPray cousin
said she what may his fortune be When I answered that with what
I should be able to give him he would have better than two thousand a
year she replied with a disdainful toss of her head that it would
be impossible for him to preserve his independence on such a paultry
provision

Not a little nettled at this arrogant remark I told her I had the
honour to sit in parliament with her father when he had little more
than half that income and I believed there was not a more independent
and incorruptible member in the house Ay but times are changed cried
the squireCountry gentlemen nowadays live after another fashion
My table alone stands me in a cool thousand a quarter though I raise
my own stock import my own liquors and have every thing at the first
handTrue it is I keep open house and receive all corners for the
honour of Old England If that be the case said I tis a wonder you
can maintain it at so small an expence but every private gentleman is
not expected to keep a caravanserai for the accommodation of travellers
indeed if every individual lived in the same stile you would not have
such a number of guests at your table of consequence your hospitality
would not shine so bright for the glory of the West Riding The
young squire tickled by this ironical observation exclaimed O che
burlahis mother eyed me in silence with a supercilious air and
the father of the feast taking a bumper of October My service to you
cousin Bramble said he I have always heard there was something keen
and biting in the air of the Welch mountains

I was much pleased with the count de Melville who is sensible easy
and polite and the countess is the most amiable woman I ever beheld
In the afternoon they took leave of their entertainers and the young
gentleman mounting his horse undertook to conduct their coach through
the park while one of their servants rode round to give notice to the
rest whom they had left at a public house on the road The moment
their backs were turned the censorious daemon took possession of our
Yorkshire landlady and our sister TabithaThe former observed that
the countess was a good sort of a body but totally ignorant of good
breeding consequently aukward in her address The squire said he did
not pretend to the breeding of any thing but colts but that the jade
would be very handsome if she was a little more in flesh Handsome
cried Tabby she has indeed a pair of black eyes without any meaning
but then there is not a good feature in her face I know not what you
call good features in Wales replied our landlord but theyll pass in
Yorkshire Then turning to Liddy he added What say you my pretty
Redstreakwhat is your opinion of the countess I think cried
Liddy with great emotion shes an angel Tabby chid her for talking
with such freedom in company and the lady of the house said in a
contemptuous tone she supposed miss had been brought up at some country
boardingschool

Our conversation was suddenly interrupted by the young gentleman
who galloped into the yard all aghast exclaiming that the coach was
attacked by a great number of highwaymen My nephew and I rushed out
found his own and his servants horse ready saddled in the stable with
pistols in the capsWe mounted instantly ordering Clinker and Dutton
to follow with all possible expedition but notwithstanding all the
speed we could make the action was over before we arrived and the
count with his lady safe lodged at the house of Grieve who had
signalized himself in a very remarkable manner on this occasion At the
turning of a lane that led to the village where the counts servants
remained a couple of robbers ahorseback suddenly appeared with their
pistols advanced one kept the coachman in awe and the other demanded
the counts money while the young squire went off at full speed
without ever casting a look behind The count desiring the thief to
withdraw his pistol as the lady was in great terror delivered his
purse without making the least resistance but not satisfied with this
booty which was pretty considerable the rascal insisted upon rifling
her of her carrings and necklace and the countess screamed with
affright Her husband exasperated at the violence with which she was
threatened wrested the pistol out of the fellows hand and turning it
upon him snapped it in his face but the robber knowing there was no
charge in it drew another from his bosom and in all probability would
have killed him on the spot had not his life been saved by a wonderful
interposition Grieve the apothecary chancing to pass that very
instant ran up to the coach and with a crabstick which was all the
weapon he had brought the fellow to the ground with the first blow
then seizing his pistol presented it at his colleague who fired his
piece at random and fled without further opposition The other was
secured by the assistance of the count and the coachman and his legs
being tied under the belly of his own horse Grieve conducted him to
the village whither also the carriage proceeded It was with great
difficulty the countess could be kept from swooning but at last she was
happily conveyed to the house of the apothecary who went into the shop
to prepare some drops for her while his wife and daughter administered
to her in another apartment

I found the count standing in the kitchen with the parson of the parish
and expressing much impatience to see his protector whom as yet he had
scarce found time to thank for the essential service he had done him
and the countessThe daughter passing at the same time with a glass of
water monsieur de Melville could not help taking notice of her figure
which was strikingly engagingAy said the parson she is the
prettiest girl and the best girl in all my parish and if I could give
my son an estate of ten thousand a year he should have my consent to
lay it at her feet If Mr Grieve had been as solicitious about getting
money as he has been in performing all the duties of a primitive
Christian he would not have hung so long upon his hands What is her
name said I Sixteen years ago answered the vicar I christened her
by the names of Seraphina Melvilia Ha what how cried the count
eagerly sure you said Seraphina Melvilia I did said he Mr Grieve
told me those were the names of two noble persons abroad to whom he had
been obliged for more than life

The count without speaking another syllable rushed into the parlour
crying This is your goddaughter my dear Mrs Grieve then seizing
the countess by the hand exclaimed with great agitation O madam O
sirI amI am your poor ElinorThis is my Seraphina Melvilia O
child these are the count and countess of Melville the generous the
glorious benefactors of thy once unhappy parents

The countess rising from her scat threw her arms about the neck of the
amiable Seraphina and clasped her to her breast with great tenderness
while she herself was embraced by the weeping mother This moving scene
was completed by the entrance of Grieve himself who falling on his
knees before the count Behold said he a penitent who at length
can look upon his patron without shrinking Ah Ferdinand cried he
raising and folding him in his arms the playfellow of my infancythe
companion of my youthIs it to you then I am indebted for my
life Heaven has heard my prayer said the other and given me an
opportunity to prove myself not altogether unworthy of your clemency and
protection He then kissed the hand of the countess while monsieur
de Melville saluted his wife and lovely daughter and all of us were
greatly affected by this pathetic recognition

In a word Grieve was no other than Ferdinand count Fathom whose
adventures were printed many years ago Being a sincere convert to
virtue he had changed his name that he might elude the enquiries of
the count whose generous allowance he determined to forego that he
might have no dependence but upon his own industry and moderation He
had accordingly settled in this village as a practitioner in surgery and
physic and for some years wrestled with all the miseries of indigence
which however he and his wife had borne with the most exemplary
resignation At length by dint of unwearied attention to the duties of
his profession which he exercised with equal humanity and success he
had acquired tolerable share of business among the farmers and common
people which enabled him to live in a decent manner He had been scarce
ever seen to smile was unaffectedly pious and all the time he could
spare from the avocations of his employment he spent in educating
his daughter and in studying for his own improvement In short the
adventurer Fathom was under the name of Grieve universally respected
among the commonalty of this district as a prodigy of learning and
virtue These particulars I learned from the vicar when we quitted the
room that they might be under no restraint in their mutual effusions
I make no doubt that Grieve will be pressed to leave off business
and reunite himself to the counts family and as the countess seemed
extremely fond of his daughter she will in all probability insist
upon Seraphinas accompanying her to Scotland

Having paid our compliments to these noble persons we returned to the
squires where we expected an invitation to pass the night which was
wet and raw but it seems squire Burdocks hospitality reached not so
far for the honour of Yorkshire we therefore departed in the evening
and lay at an inn where I caught cold

In hope of riding it down before it could take fast hold on my
constitution I resolved to visit another relation one Mr Pimpernel
who lived about a dozen miles from the place where we lodged Pimpernel
being the youngest of four sons was bred an attorney at Furnivals inn
but all his elder brothers dying he got himself called to the bar for
the honour of his family and soon after this preferment succeeded to
his fathers estate which was very considerable He carried home with
him all the knavish chicanery of the lowest pettifogger together with
a wife whom he had purchased of a drayman for twenty pounds and he soon
found means to obtain a dedimus as an acting justice of peace He is not
only a sordid miser in his disposition but his avarice is mingled
with a spirit of despotism which is truly diabolicalHe is a brutal
husband an unnatural parent a harsh master an oppressive landlord a
litigious neighbour and a partial magistrate Friends he has none
and in point of hospitality and good breeding our cousin Burdock is a
prince in comparison of this ungracious miscreant whose house is the
lively representation of a gaol Our reception was suitable to the
character I have sketched Had it depended upon the wife we should have
been kindly treatedShe is really a good sort of a woman in spite
of her low original and well respected in the country but she has not
interest enough in her own house to command a draught of table beer
far less to bestow any kind of education on her children who run about
like tagged colts in a state of naturePox on him he is such a dirty
fellow that I have not patience to prosecute the subject

By that time we reached Harrigate I began to be visited by certain
rheumatic symptoms The Scotch lawyer Mr Micklewhimmen recommended a
hot bath of these waters so earnestly that I was overpersuaded to try
the experimentHe had used it often with success and always stayed an
hour in the bath which was a tub filled with Harrigate water heated
for the purpose If I could hardly bear the smell of a single tumbler
when cold you may guess how my nose was regaled by the streams arising
from a hot bath of the same fluid At night I was conducted into a dark
hole on the ground floor where the tub smoaked and stunk like the pot
of Acheron in one corner and in another stood a dirty bed provided
with thick blankets in which I was to sweat after coming out of the
bath My heart seemed to die within me when I entered this dismal
bagnio and found my brain assaulted by such insufferable effluvia I
cursed Micklewhimmen for not considering that my organs were formed on
this side of the Tweed but being ashamed to recoil upon the threshold
I submitted to the process

After having endured all but real suffocation for above a quarter of an
hour in the tub I was moved to the bed and wrapped in blanketsThere
I lay a full hour panting with intolerable heat but not the least
moisture appearing on my skin I was carried to my own chamber and
passed the night without closing an eye in such a flutter of spirits as
rendered me the most miserable wretch in being I should certainly
have run distracted if the rarefaction of my blood occasioned by
that Stygian bath had not burst the vessels and produced a violent
haemorrhage which though dreadful and alarming removed the horrible
disquietI lost two pounds of blood and more on this occasion and
find myself still weak and languid but I believe a little exercise
will forward my recovery and therefore I am resolved to set out
tomorrow for York in my way to Scarborough where I propose to brace
up my fibres by seabathing which I know is one of your favourite
specificks There is however one disease for which you have found as
yet no specific and that is old age of which this tedious unconnected
epistle is an infallible symptom what therefore cannot be cured must
be endured by you as well as by

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR KNIGHT

The manner of living at Harrigate was so agreeable to my disposition
that I left the place with some regretOur aunt Tabby would have
probably made some objection to our departing so soon had not an
accident embroiled her with Mr Micklewhimmen the Scotch advocate
on whose heart she had been practising from the second day after our
arrivalThat original though seemingly precluded from the use of
his limbs had turned his genius to good accountIn short by dint of
groaning and whining he had excited the compassion of the company so
effectually that an old lady who occupied the very best apartment in
the house gave it up for his case and convenience When his man led him
into the Long Room all the females were immediately in commotionOne
set an elbowchair another shook up the cushion a third brought a
stool and a fourth a pillow for the accommodation of his feet
Two ladies of whom Tabby was always one supported him into the
diningroom and placed him properly at the table and his taste was
indulged with a succession of delicacies culled by their fair hands
All this attention he repaid with a profusion of compliments and
benedictions which were not the less agreeable for being delivered in
the Scottish dialect As for Mrs Tabitha his respects were particularly
addressed to her and he did not fail to mingle them with religious
reflections touching free grace knowing her bias to methodism which
he also professed upon a calvinistical model

For my part I could not help thinking this lawyer was not such an
invalid as he pretended to be I observed he ate very heartily three
times a day and though his bottle was marked stomachic tincture he
had recourse to it so often and seemed to swallow it with such peculiar
relish that I suspected it was not compounded in the apothecarys shop
or the chemists laboratory One day while he was earnest in discourse
with Mrs Tabitha and his servant had gone out on some occasion or
other I dexterously exchanged the labels and situation of his bottle
and mine and having tasted his tincture found it was excellent claret
I forthwith handed it about me to some of my neighbours and it was
quite emptied before Mr Micklewhimmen had occasion to repeat his
draught At length turning about he took hold of my bottle instead of
his own and filling a large glass drank to the health of Mrs Tabitha
It had scarce touched his lips when he perceived the change which had
been put upon him and was at first a little out of countenance He
seemed to retire within himself in order to deliberate and in half a
minute his resolution was taken addressing himself to our quarter I
give the gentleman credit for his wit said he it was a gude practical
joke but sometimes hi joci in seria ducunt malaI hope for his own
sake he has na drank all the liccor for it was a vara poorful infusion
of jallap in Bourdeaux wine at its possable he may ha taen sic a dose
as will produce a terrible catastrophe in his ain booels

By far the greater part of the contents had fallen to the share of a
young clothier from Leeds who had come to make a figure at Harrigate
and was in effect a great coxcomb in his way It was with a view to
laugh at his fellowguests as well as to mortify the lawyer that he
had emptied the bottle when it came to his turn and he had laughed
accordingly but now his mirth gave way to his apprehensionHe began
to spit to make wry faces and writhe himself into various
contorsionsDamn the stuff cried he I thought it had a villainous
twangpah He that would cozen a Scot mun get oope betimes and take
Old Scratch for his counsellor In troth mester what dye caum
replied the lawyer your wit has run you into a filthy puddleIm
truly consarned for your waeful caseThe best advice I can give you in
sic a delemma is to send an express to Rippon for doctor Waugh without
delay and in the mean time swallow all the oil and butter you can
find in the hoose to defend your poor stomach and intastines from the
villication of the particles of the jallap which is vara violent even
when taken in moderation

The poor clothiers torments had already begun he retired roaring with
pain to his own chamber the oil was swallowed and the doctor
sent for but before he arrived the miserable patient had made such
discharges upwards and downwards that nothing remained to give him
further offence and this double evacuation was produced by imagination
alone for what he had drank was genuine wine of Bourdeaux which the
lawyer had brought from Scotland for his own private use The clothier
finding the joke turn out so expensive and disagreeable quitted the
house next morning leaving the triumph to Micklewhimmen who enjoyed it
internally without any outward signs of exultationon the contrary he
affected to pity the young man for what he had suffered and acquired
fresh credit from this shew of moderation

It was about the middle of the night which succeeded this adventure
that the vent of the kitchen chimney being foul the soot took fire and
the alarm was given in a dreadful manner Every body leaped naked out
of bed and in a minute the whole house was filled with cries and
confusionThere was two stairs in the house and to these we naturally
ran but they were both so blocked up by the people pressing one upon
another that it seemed impossible to pass without throwing down
and trampling upon the women In the midst of this anarchy Mr
Micklewhimmen with a leathern portmanteau on his back came running
as nimble as a buck along the passage and Tabby in her underpetticoat
endeavouring to hook him under the arm that she might escape through
his protection he very fairly pushed her down crying Na na gude
faith charity begins at hame Without paying the least respect to the
shrieks and intreaties of his female friends he charged through the
midst of the crowd overturning every thing that opposed him and
actually fought his way to the bottom of the StaircaseBy this time
Clinker had found a ladder by which he entered the window of my uncles
chamber where our family was assembled and proposed that we should
make our exit successively by that conveyance The squire exhorted his
sister to begin the descent but before she could resolve her woman
Mrs Winifred Jenkins in a transport of terror threw herself out at the
window upon the ladder while Humphry dropped upon the ground that
he might receive her in her descentThis maiden was just as she had
started out of bed the moon shone very bright and a fresh breeze of
wind blowing none of Mrs Winifreds beauties could possibly escape the
view of the fortunate Clinker whose heart was not able to withstand the
united force of so many charms at least I am much mistaken if he has
not been her humble slave from that momentHe received her in his arms
and giving her his coat to protect her from the weather ascended again
with admirable dexterity

At that instant the landlord of the house called out with an audible
voice that the fire was extinguished and the ladies had nothing
further to fear this was a welcome note to the audience and produced
an immediate effect the shrieking ceased and a confused sound of
expostulation ensued I conducted Mrs Tabitha and my sister to their own
chamber where Liddy fainted away but was soon brought to herself
Then I went to offer my services to the other ladies who might want
assistanceThey were all scudding through the passage to their several
apartments and as the thoroughfair was lighted by two lamps I had a
pretty good observation of them in their transit but as most of them
were naked to the smock and all their heads shrowded in huge nightcaps
I could not distinguish one face from another though I recognized
some of their voicesThese were generally plaintive some wept some
scolded and some prayedI lifted up one poor old gentlewoman who had
been overturned and sore bruised by a multitude of feet and this
was also the case with the lame person from Northumberland whom
Micklewhimmen had in his passage overthrown though not with impunity
for the cripple in falling gave him such a good pelt on the head with
his crutch that the blood followed

As for this lawyer he waited below till the hurly burly was over and
then stole softly to his own chamber from whence he did not venture to
make a second sally till eleven in the forenoon when he was led into
the Public Room by his own servant and another assistant groaning most
woefully with a bloody napkin round his head But things were greatly
alteredThe selfish brutality of his behaviour on the stairs had
steeled their hearts against all his arts and addressNot a soul
offered to accommodate him with a chair cushion or footstool so that
he was obliged to sit down on a hard benchIn that position he looked
around with a rueful aspect and bowing very low said in a
whining tone Your most humble servant ladiesFire is a dreadful
calamityFire purifies gold and it ties friendship cried Mrs
Tabitha bridling Yea madam replied Micklewhimmen and it trieth
discretion alsoIf discretion consists in forsaking a friend in
adversity you are eminently possessed of that virtue resumed our
auntNa madam rejoined the advocate well I wot I cannot claim
any merit from the mode of my retreatYell please to observe ladies
there are twa independent principles that actuate our natureOne is
instinct which we have in common with the brute creation and the other
is reasonNoo in certain great emergencies when the faculty of reason
is suspended instinct taks the lead and when this predominates having
no affinity with reason it pays no sort of regard to its connections
it only operates for the preservation of the individual and that by the
most expeditious and effectual means therefore begging your pardon
ladies Im no accountable in foro conscientioe for what I did while
under the influence of this irresistible pooer

Here my uncle interposing I should be glad to know said he whether
it was instinct that prompted you to retreat with bag and baggage for
I think you had a portmanteau on your shoulder The lawyer answered
without hesitation Gif I might tell my mind freely withoot incuring
the suspicion of presumption I should think it was something superior
to either reason or instinct which suggested that measure and this on
a twafold accoont in the first place the portmanteau contained the
writings of a worthy noblemans estate and their being burnt would have
occasioned a loss that could not be repaired secondly my good angel
seems to have laid the portmanteau on my shoulders by way of defence
to sustain the violence of a most inhuman blow from the crutch of a
reverend clergyman which even in spite of that medium hath wounded
me sorely even unto the pericranium By your own doctrine cried the
parson who chanced to be present I am not accountable for the blow
which was the effect of instinct I crave your pardon reverend sir
said the other instinct never acts but for the preservation of the
individual but your preservation was out of the caseyou had already
received the damage and therefore the blow must be imputed to revenge
which is a sinful passion that ill becomes any Christian especially a
protestant divine and let me tell you most reverend doctor gin I had
a mind to plea the law would hauld my libel relevant Why the damage
is pretty equal on both sides cried the parson your head is broke
and my crutch is snapt in the middle Now if you will repair the one I
will be at the expence of curing the other

This sally raised the laugh against Micklewhimmen who began to look
grave when my uncle in order to change the discourse observed
that instinct had been very kind to him in another respect for it had
restored to him the use of his limbs which in his exit he had moved
with surprising agilityHe replied that it was the nature of fear to
brace up the nerves and mentioned some surprising feats of strength
and activity performed by persons under the impulse of terror but he
complained that in his own particular the effects had ceased when the
cause was taken awayThe squire said he would lay a teadrinking on
his head that he should dance a Scotch measure without making a false
step and the advocate grinning called for the piperA fidler being
at hand this original started up with his bloody napkin over his black
tyeperiwig and acquitted himself in such a manner as excited the mirth
of the whole company but he could not regain the good graces of Mrs
Tabby who did not understand the principle of instinct and the lawyer
did not think it worth his while to proceed to further demonstration

From Harrigate we came hither by the way of York and here we shall
tarry some days as my uncle and Tabitha are both resolved to make use
of the waters Scarborough though a paltry town is romantic from its
situation along a cliff that overhangs the sea The harbour is formed
by a small elbow of land that runs out as a natural mole directly
opposite to the town and on that side is the castle which stands very
high of considerable extent and before the invention of gunpowder
was counted impregnable At the other end of Scarborough are two public
rooms for the use of the company who resort to this place in the summer
to drink the waters and bathe in the sea and the diversions are pretty
much on the same footing here as at Bath The Spa is a little way beyond
the town on this side under a cliff within a few paces of the sea
and thither the drinkers go every morning in dishabille but the descent
is by a great number of steps which invalids find very inconvenient
Betwixt the well and the harbour the bathing machines are ranged along
the beach with all their proper utensils and attendants You have never
seen one of these machinesImage to yourself a small snug wooden
chamber fixed upon a wheelcarriage having a door at each end and on
each side a little window above a bench belowThe bather ascending
into this apartment by wooden steps shuts himself in and begins to
undress while the attendant yokes a horse to the end next the sea and
draws the carriage forwards till the surface of the water is on a level
with the floor of the dressingroom then he moves and fixes the horse
to the other endThe person within being stripped opens the door to
the seaward where he finds the guide ready and plunges headlong into
the waterAfter having bathed he reascends into the apartment by the
steps which had been shifted for that purpose and puts on his clothes
at his leisure while the carriage is drawn back again upon the dry
land so that he has nothing further to do but to open the door and
come down as he went upShould he be so weak or ill as to require
a servant to put off and on his clothes there is room enough in the
apartment for half a dozen people The guides who attend the ladies in
the water are of their own sex and they and the female bathers have
a dress of flannel for the sea nay they are provided with other
conveniences for the support of decorum A certain number of the
machines are fitted with tilts that project from the seaward ends
of them so as to screen the bathers from the view of all persons
whatsoeverThe beach is admirably adapted for this practice the
descent being gently gradual and the sand soft as velvet but then the
machines can be used only at a certain time of the tide which varies
every day so that sometimes the bathers are obliged to rise very early
in the morningFor my part I love swimming as an exercise and
can enjoy it at all times of the tide without the formality of an
apparatusYou and I have often plunged together into the Isis but
the sea is a much more noble bath for health as well as pleasure You
cannot conceive what a flow of spirits it gives and how it braces every
sinew of the human frame Were I to enumerate half the diseases which
are every day cured by seabathing you might justly say you had
received a treatise instead of a letter from

Your affectionate friend and servant J MELFORD SCARBOROUGH July 1




To Dr LEWIS

I have not found all the benefit I expected at Scarborough where I have
been these eight daysFrom Harrigate we came hither by the way of York
where we stayed only one day to visit the Castle the Minster and
the Assemblyroom The first which was heretofore a fortress is now
converted to a prison and is the best in all respects I ever saw
at home or abroadIt stands in a high situation extremely well
ventilated and has a spacious area within the walls for the health and
convenience of all the prisoners except those whom it is necessary to
secure in close confinement Even these last have all the comforts that
the nature of their situation can admit Here the assizes are held in a
range of buildings erected for that purpose

As for the Minster I know not how to distinguish it except by its
great size and the height of its spire from those other ancient
churches in different parts of the kingdom which used to be called
monuments of Gothic architecture but it is now agreed that this stile
is Saracen rather than Gothic and I suppose it was first imported
into England from Spain great part of which was under the dominion of
the Moors Those British architects who adopted this stile dont seem
to have considered the propriety of their adoption The climate of the
country possessed by the Moors or Saracens both in Africa and Spain
was so exceedingly hot and dry that those who built places of worship
for the multitude employed their talents in contriving edifices that
should be cool and for this purpose nothing could be better adopted
than those buildings vast narrow dark and lofty impervious to the
sunbeams and having little communication with the scorched external
atmosphere but ever affording a refreshing coolness like subterranean
cellars in the heats of summer or natural caverns in the bowels of huge
mountains But nothing could be more preposterous than to imitate such
a mode of architecture in a country like England where the climate
is cold and the air eternally loaded with vapours and where of
consequence the builders intention should be to keep the people dry
and warmFor my part I never entered the Abbey church at Bath but
once and the moment I stept over the threshold I found myself chilled
to the very marrow of my bones When we consider that in our churches
in general we breathe a gross stagnated air surcharged with damps
from vaults tombs and charnelhouses may we not term them so many
magazines of rheums created for the benefit of the medical faculty and
safely aver that more bodies are lost than souls saved by going to
church in the winter especially which may be said to engross eight
months in the year I should be glad to know what offence it would give
to tender consciences if the house of God was made more comfortable
or less dangerous to the health of valetudinarians and whether it
would not be an encouragement to piety as well as the salvation of many
lives if the place of worship was well floored wainscotted warmed
and ventilated and its area kept sacred from the pollution of the
dead The practice of burying in churches was the effect of ignorant
superstition influenced by knavish priests who pretended that the
devil could have no power over the defunct if he was interred in holy
ground and this indeed is the only reason that can be given for
consecrating all cemeteries even at this day

The external appearance of an old cathedral cannot be but displeasing to
the eye of every man who has any idea of propriety or proportion even
though he may be ignorant of architecture as a science and the long
slender spire puts one in mind of a criminal impaled with a sharp stake
rising up through his shoulderThese towers or steeples were likewise
borrowed from the Mahometans who having no bells used such minarets
for the purpose of calling the people to prayersThey may be of further
use however for making observations and signals but I would vote for
their being distinct from the body of the church because they serve
only to make the pile more barbarous or Saracenical

There is nothing of this Arabic architecture in the Assembly Room which
seems to me to have been built upon a design of Palladio and might
be converted into an elegant place of worship but it is indifferently
contrived for that sort of idolatry which is performed in it at present
the grandeur of the fane gives a diminutive effect to the little painted
divinities that are adorned in it and the company on a ballnight
must look like an assembly of fantastic fairies revelling by moonlight
among the columns of a Grecian temple

Scarborough seems to be falling off in point of reputation All these
places Bath excepted have their vogue and then the fashion changes
I am persuaded there are fifty spaws in England as efficacious and
salutary as that of Scarborough though they have not yet risen to fame
and perhaps never will unless some medical encomiast should find an
interest in displaying their virtues to the public viewBe that as it
may recourse will always be had to this place for the convenience of
sea bathing while this practice prevails but it were to be wished
they would make the beach more accessible to invalids

I have here met with my old acquaintance Hewett whom you have often
heard me mention as one of the most original characters upon earthI
first knew him at Venice and afterwards saw him in different parts of
Italy where he was well known by the nickname of Cavallo Bianco
from his appearing always mounted on a pale horse like Death in the
Revelations You must remember the account I once gave you of a curious
dispute he had at Constantinople with a couple of Turks in defence of
the Christian religion a dispute from which he acquired the epithet
of DemonstratorThe truth is Howns no religion but that of nature
but on this occasion he was stimulated to shew his parts for the
honour of his countrySome years ago being in the Campidoglio at Rome
he made up to the bust of Jupiter and bowing very low exclaimed in
the Italian language I hope sir if ever you get your head above
water again you will remember that I paid my respects to you in your
adversity This sally was reported to the cardinal Camerlengo and by
him laid before pope Benedict XIV who could not help laughing at the
extravagance of the address and said to the cardinal Those English
heretics think they have a right to go to the devil in their own way

Indeed H was the only Englishman I ever knew who had resolution
enough to live in his own way in the midst of foreigners for neither
in dress diet customs or conversation did he deviate one tittle from
the manner in which he had been brought up About twelve years ago he
began a Giro or circuit which he thus performedAt Naples where
he fixed his headquarters he embarked for Marseilles from whence he
travelled with a Voiturin to AntibesThere he took his passage to
Genoa and Lerici from which last place he proceeded by the way of
Cambratina to Pisa and FlorenceAfter having halted some time in
this metropolis he set out with a Vetturino for Rome where he reposed
himself a few weeks and then continued his route for Naples in order
to wait for the next opportunity of embarkationAfter having twelve
times described this circle he lately flew off at a tangent to visit
some trees at his countryhouse in England which he had planted above
twenty years ago after the plan of the double colonnade in the piazza
of St Peters at RomeHe came hither to Scarborough to pay his
respects to his noble friend and former pupil the M of G and
forgetting that he is now turned of seventy sacrificed so liberally to
Bacchus that next day he was seized with a fit of the apoplexy which
has a little impaired his memory but he retains all the oddity of
his character in perfection and is going back to Italy by the way of
Geneva that he may have a conference with his friend Voltaire about
giving the last blow to the Christian superstitionHe intends to take
shipping here for Holland or Hamburgh for it is a matter of great
indifference to him at what part of the continent he first lands

When he was going abroad the last time he took his passage in a ship
bound for Leghorn and his baggage was actually embarked In going down
the river by water he was by mistake put on board of another
vessel under sail and upon inquiry understood she was bound to
PetersburghPetersburghPetersburgh said he I dont care if I go
along with you He forthwith struck a bargain with the captain bought
a couple of shirts of the mate and was safe conveyed to the court of
Muscovy from whence he travelled by land to receive his baggage at
LeghornHe is now more likely than ever to execute a whim of the same
nature and I will hold any wager that as he cannot be supposed to live
much longer according to the course of nature his exit will be as odd
as his life has been extravagant

This gentleman crossed the sea to France visited and conferred with
Mr de Voltaire at Fernay resumed his old circuit at Genoa and died in
1767 at the house of Vanini in Florence Being taken with a suppression
of urine he resolved in imitation of Pomponius Atticus to take
himself off by abstinence and this resolution he executed like an
ancient Roman He saw company to the last cracked his jokes conversed
freely and entertained his guests with music On the third day of his
fast he found himself entirely freed of his complaint but refused
taking sustenance He said the most disagreeable part of the voyage was
past and he should be a cursed fool indeed to put about ship when he
was just entering the harbour In these sentiments he persisted without
any marks of affectation and thus finished his course with such
case and serenity as would have done honour to the firmest Stoic of
antiquity

But to return from one humourist to another you must know I have
received benefit both from the chalybeate and the sea and would have
used them longer had not a most ridiculous adventure by making me the
towntalk obliged me to leave the place for I cant bear the thoughts
of affording a spectacle to the multitude Yesterday morning at six
oclock I went down to the bathingplace attended by my servant
Clinker who waited on the beach as usualThe wind blowing from the
north and the weather being hazy the water proved so chill that when
I rose from my first plunge I could not help sobbing and bawling out
from the effects of the cold Clinker who heard me cry and saw me
indistinctly a good way without the guide buffetting the waves took it
for granted I was drowning and rushing into the sea clothes and all
overturned the guide in his hurry to save his master I had swam out
a few strokes when hearing a noise I turned about and saw Clinker
already up to his neck advancing towards me with all the wildness of
terror in his aspectAfraid he would get out of his depth I made haste
to meet him when all of a sudden he seized me by one ear dragged me
bellowing with pain upon the dry beach to the astonishment of all the
people men and women and children there assembled

I was so exasperated by the pain of my ear and the disgrace of being
exposed in such an attitude that in the first transport I struck him
down then running back into the sea took shelter in the machine where
my clothes had been deposited I soon recollected myself so far as to do
justice to the poor fellow who in great simplicity of heart had acted
from motives of fidelity and affectionOpening the door of the machine
which was immediately drawn on shore I saw him standing by the wheel
dropping like a waterwork and trembling from head to foot partly from
cold and partly from the dread of having offended his masterI made
my acknowledgments for the blow he had received assured him I was
not angry and insisted upon his going home immediately to shift his
clothes a command which he could hardly find in his heart to execute
so well disposed was he to furnish the mob with further entertainment
at my expence Clinkers intention was laudable without all doubt but
nevertheless I am a sufferer by his simplicityI have had a burning
heat and a strange buzzing noise in that ear ever since it was so
roughly treated and I cannot walk the street without being pointed at
as the monster that was hauled naked ashore upon the beachWell I
affirm that folly is often more provoking than knavery aye and more
mischievous too and whether a man had not better choose a sensible
rogue than an honest simpleton for his servant is no matter of doubt
with

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR WAT

We made a precipitate retreat from Scarborough owing to the excessive
delicacy of our squire who cannot bear the thoughts of being
proetereuntium digito monstratus

One morning while he was bathing in the sea his man Clinker took it
in his head that his master was in danger of drowning and in this
conceit plunging into the water he lugged him out naked on the beach
and almost pulled off his ear in the operation You may guess how this
atchievement was relished by Mr Bramble who is impatient irascible
and has the most extravagant ideas of decency and decorum in the
oeconomy of his own personIn the first ebullition of his choler he
knocked Clinker down with his fist but he afterwards made him amends
for his outrage and in order to avoid further notice of the people
among whom this incident had made him remarkable he resolved to leave
Scarborough next day

We set out accordingly over the moors by the way of Whitby and began
our journey betimes in hopes of reaching Stockton that night but
in this hope we were disappointedIn the afternoon crossing a deep
gutter made by a torrent the coach was so hard strained that one of
the irons which connect the frame snapt and the leather sling on the
same side cracked in the middle The shock was so great that my sister
Liddy struck her head against Mrs Tabithas nose with such violence that
the blood flowed and Win Jenkins was darted through a small window in
that part of the carriage next the horses where she stuck like a bawd
in the pillory till she was released by the hand of Mr Bramble We
were eight miles distant from any place where we could be supplied with
chaises and it was impossible to proceed with the coach until the
damage should be repairedin this dilemma we discovered a blacksmiths
forge on the edge of a small common about half a mile from the scene
of our disaster and thither the postilions made shift to draw the
carriage slowly while the company walked afoot but we found the
blacksmith had been dead some days and his wife who had been lately
delivered was deprived of her senses under the care of a nurse hired
by the parish We were exceedingly mortified at this disappointment
which however was surmounted by the help of Humphry Clinker who is a
surprising compound of genius and simplicity Finding the tools of
the defunct together with some coals in the smithy he unscrewed the
damaged iron in a twinkling and kindling a fire united the broken
pieces with equal dexterity and dispatchWhile he was at work upon
this operation the poor woman in the straw struck with the wellknown
sound of the hammer and anvil started up and notwithstanding all the
nurses efforts came running into the smithy where throwing her arms
about Clinkers neck Ah Jacob cried she how could you leave me in
such a condition

This incident was too pathetic to occasion mirthit brought tears into
the eyes of all present The poor widow was put to bed again and we
did not leave the village without doing something for her benefitEven
Tabithas charity was awakened on this occasion As for the
tenderhearted Humphry Clinker he hammered the iron and wept at the
same timeBut his ingenuity was not confined to his own province of
farrier and blacksmithIt was necessary to join the leather sling
which had been broke and this service he likewise performed by means
of a broken awl which he newpointed and ground a little hemp which
he spun into lingels and a few tacks which he made for the purpose
Upon the whole we were in a condition to proceed in little more than
an hour but even this delay obliged us to pass the night at
GisboroughNext day we crossed the Tees at Stockton which is a neat
agreeable town and there we resolved to dine with purpose to lie at
Durham

Whom should we meet in the yard when we alighted but Martin the
adventurer Having handed out the ladies and conducted them into an
apartment where he payed his compliments to Mrs Tabby with his usual
address he begged leave to speak to my uncle in another room and
there in some confusion he made an apology for having taken the
liberty to trouble him with a letter at Stevenage He expressed his
hope that Mr Bramble had bestowed some consideration on his unhappy
case and repeated his desire of being taken into his service

My uncle calling me into the room told him that we were both
very well inclined to rescue him from a way of life that was equally
dangerous and dishonourable and that he should have no scruples in
trusting to his gratitude and fidelity if he had any employment
for him which he thought would suit his qualifications and his
circumstances but that all the departments he had mentioned in his
letter were filled up by persons of whose conduct he had no reason to
complain of consequence he could not without injustice deprive any
one of them of his bread Nevertheless he declared himself ready to
assist him in any feasible project either with his purse or credit

Martin seemed deeply touched at this declarationThe tear started
in his eye while he said in a faultering accentWorthy siryour
generosity oppresses meI never dreamed of troubling you for any
pecuniary assistanceindeed I have no occasionI have been so lucky
at billiards and betting in different places at Buxton Harrigate
Scarborough and Newcastle races that my stock in readymoney amounts
to three hundred pounds which I would willingly employ in prosecuting
some honest scheme of life but my friend justice Buzzard has set
so many springs for my life that I am under the necessity of either
retiring immediately to a remote part of the country where I can enjoy
the protection of some generous patron or of quitting the kingdom
altogether It is upon this alternative that I now beg leave to ask your
advice I have had information of all your route since I had the honour
to see you at Stevenage and supposing you would come this way from
Scarborough I came hither last night from Darlington to pay you my
respects

It would be no difficult matter to provide you with an asylum in the
country replied my uncle but a life of indolence and obscurity
would not suit with your active and enterprizing dispositionI would
therefore advise you to try your fortune in the East IndiesI will
give you a letter to a friend in London who will recommend you to the
direction for a commission in the companys service and if that cannot
be obtained you will at least be received as a volunteerin which
case you may pay for your passage and I shall undertake to procure you
such credentials that you will not be long without a commission

Martin embraced the proposal with great eagerness it was therefore
resolved that he should sell his horse and take a passage by sea
for London to execute the project without delayIn the mean time he
accompanied us to Durham were we took up our quarters for the night
Here being furnished with letters from my uncle he took his leave of
us with strong symptoms of gratitude and attachment and set out for
Sunderland in order to embark in the first collier bound for the
river Thames He had not been gone half an hour when we were joined
by another character which promised something extraordinaryA tall
meagre figure answering with his horse the description of Don Quixote
mounted on Rozinante appeared in the twilight at the inn door while my
aunt and Liddy stood at a window in the diningroomHe wore a coat
the cloth of which had once been scarlet trimmed with Brandenburgs now
totally deprived of their metal and he had holstercaps and housing
of the same stuff and same antiquity Perceiving ladies at the window
above he endeavoured to dismount with the most graceful air he could
assume but the ostler neglecting to hold the stirrup when he wheeled
off his right foot and stood with his whole weight on the other the
girth unfortunately gave way the saddle turned down came the cavalier
to the ground and his hat and perriwig falling off displayed a
headpiece of various colours patched and plaistered in a woeful
conditionThe ladies at the window above shrieked with affright on
the supposition that the stranger had received some notable damages
in his fall but the greatest injury he had sustained arose from the
dishonour of his descent aggravated by the disgrace of exposing the
condition of his cranium for certain plebeians that were about the
door laughed aloud in the belief that the captain had got either a
scald head or a broken head both equally opprobrious

He forthwith leaped up in a fury and snatching one of his pistols
threatened to put the ostler to death when another squall from the
women checked his resentment He then bowed to the window while he
kissed the buttend of his pistol which he replaced adjusted his wig
in great confusion and led his horse into the stableBy this time I
had come to the door and could not help gazing at the strange figure
that presented itself to my view He would have measured above six
feet in height had he stood upright but he stooped very much was very
narrow in the shoulders and very thick in the calves of his legs which
were cased in black spatterdashesAs for his thighs they were long
and slender like those of a grasshopper his face was at least half
a yard in length brown and shrivelled with projecting cheekbones
little grey eyes on the greenish hue a large hooknose a pointed chin
a mouth from ear to car very ill furnished with teeth and a high
narrow forehead well furrowed with wrinkles His horse was exactly
in the stile of its rider a resurrection of dry bones which as we
afterwards learned he valued exceedingly as the only present he had
ever received in his life

Having seen this favourite steed properly accommodated in the stable he
sent up his compliments to the ladies begging permission to thank them
in person for the marks of concern they had shewn at his disaster in
the court yardAs the squire said they could not decently decline
his visit he was shewn up stairs and paid his respects in the Scotch
dialect with much formality Leddies said he perhaps ye may be
scandaleezed at the appearance of my heed made when it was uncovered by
accident but I can assure you the condition you saw it in is neither
the effects of diseases nor of drunkenness but an honest scar received
in the service of my country He then gave us to understand that
having been wounded at Ticonderoga in America a party of Indians
rifled him scalped him broke his scull with the blow of a tomahawk
and left him for dead on the field of battle but that being afterwards
found with signs of life he had been cured in the French hospital
though the loss of substance could not be repaired so that the scull
was left naked in several places and these he covered with patches

There is no hold by which an Englishman is sooner taken than that of
compassionWe were immediately interested in behalf of this veteran
Even Tabbys heart was melted but our pity was warmed with indignation
when we learned that in the course of two sanguinary wars he had been
wounded maimed mutilated taken and enslaved without ever having
attained a higher rank than that of lieutenantMy uncles eyes gleamed
and his nether lip quivered while he exclaimed I vow to God sir
your case is a reproach to the serviceThe injustice you have met
with is so flagrantI must crave your pardon sir cried the other
interrupting him I complain of no injusticeI purchased an ensigncy
thirty years ago and in the course of service rose to a lieutenant
according to my seniorityBut in such a length of time resumed the
squire you must have seen a great many young officers put over your
headNevertheless said he I have no cause to murmurThey bought
their preferment with their moneyI had no money to carry to market
that was my misfortune but no body was to blameWhat no friend
to advance a sum of money said Mr Bramble Perhaps I might have
borrowed money for the purchase of a company answered the other
but that loan must have been refunded and I did not chuse to incumber
myself with a debt of a thousand pounds to be payed from an income
of ten shillings aday So you have spent the best part of your life
cried Mr Bramble your youth your blood and your constitution
amidst the dangers the difficulties the horrors and hardships of
a war for the consideration of three or four shillings aday a
consideration Sir replied the Scot with great warmth you are the
man that does me injustice if you say or think I have been actuated by
any such paltry considerationI am a gentleman and entered the service
as other gentlemen do with such hopes and sentiments as honourable
ambition inspiresIf I have not been lucky in the lottery of life so
neither do I think myself unfortunateI owe to no man a farthing I can
always command a clean shirt a muttonchop and a truss of straw and
when I die I shall leave effects sufficient to defray the expence of my
burial

My uncle assured him he had no intention to give him the least offence
by the observations he had made but on the contrary spoke from a
sentiment of friendly regard to his interestThe lieutenant thanked
him with a stiffness of civility which nettled our old gentleman who
perceived that his moderation was all affected for whatsoever his
tongue might declare his whole appearance denoted dissatisfactionIn
short without pretending to judge of his military merit I think I may
affirm that this Caledonian is a selfconceited pedant aukward rude
and disputaciousHe has had the benefit of a schooleducation seems
to have read a good number of books his memory is tenacious and he
pretends to speak several different languages but he is so addicted to
wrangling that he will cavil at the clearest truths and in the pride
of argumentation attempt to reconcile contradictionsWhether his
address and qualifications are really of that stamp which is agreeable
to the taste of our aunt Mrs Tabitha or that indefatigable maiden is
determined to shoot at every sort of game certain it is she has begun
to practice upon the heart of the lieutenant who favoured us with his
company to supper

I have many other things to say of this man of war which I shall
communicate in a post or two mean while it is but reasonable that you
should be indulged with some respite from those weary lucubrations of

Yours J MELFORD NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE July 10




To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR PHILLIPS

In my last I treated you with a high flavoured dish in the character
of the Scotch lieutenant and I must present him once more for your
entertainment It was our fortune to feed upon him the best part of
three days and I do not doubt that he will start again in our way
before we shall have finished our northern excursion The day after our
meeting with him at Durham proved so tempestuous that we did not choose
to proceed on our journey and my uncle persuaded him to stay till
the weather should clear up giving him at the same time a general
invitation to our mess The man has certainly gathered a whole budget
of shrewd observations but he brings them forth in such an ungracious
manner as would be extremely disgusting if it was not marked by that
characteristic oddity which never fails to attract the attentionHe and
Mr Bramble discoursed and even disputed on different subjects in war
policy the belles lettres law and metaphysics and sometimes they
were warmed into such altercation as seemed to threaten an abrupt
dissolution of their society but Mr Bramble set a guard over his own
irascibility the more vigilantly as the officer was his guest and
when in spite of all his efforts he began to wax warm the other
prudently cooled in the same proportion

Mrs Tabitha chancing to accost her brother by the familiar diminutive
of Matt Pray sir said the lieutenant is your name Matthias You
must know it is one of our uncles foibles to be ashamed of his name
Matthew because it is puritanical and this question chagrined him
so much that he answered No by Gd in a very abrupt tone of
displeasureThe Scot took umbrage at the manner of his reply and
bristling up If I had known said he that you did not care to tell
your name I should not have asked the questionThe leddy called you
Matt and I naturally thought it was Matthiasperhaps it may be
Methuselah or Metrodorus or Metellus or Mathurinus or Malthinnus or
Matamorus or No cried my uncle laughing it is neither of those
captain my name is Matthew Bramble at your serviceThe truth is
have a foolish pique at the name of Matthew because it favours of
those canting hypocrites who in Cromwells time christened all their
children by names taken from the scripture A foolish pique indeed
cried Mrs Tabby and even sinful to fall out with your name because
it is taken from holy writI would have you to know you was called
after greatuncle Matthew ap Madoc ap Meredith esquire of Llanwysthin
in Montgomeryshire justice of the quorum and crusty ruttleorum a
gentleman of great worth and property descended in a strait line by
the female side from Llewellyn prince of Wales

This genealogical anecdote seemed to make some impression upon the
NorthBriton who bowed very low to the descendant of Llewellyn and
observed that he himself had the honour of a scriptural nomination The
lady expressing a desire of knowing his address he said he designed
himself Lieutenant Obadiah Lismahago and in order to assist her memory
he presented her with a slip of paper inscribed with these three words
which she repeated with great emphasis declaring it was one of the
most noble and sonorous names she had ever heard He observed that
Obadiah was an adventitious appellation derived from his
greatgrandfather who had been one of the original covenanters but
Lismahago was the family surname taken from a place in Scotland so called Helikewise dropped some hints about the antiquity of his pedigree adding
with a smile of selfdenial Sed genus et proavos et quoe non fecimus
ipsi vix ea nostra voco which quotation he explained in deference
to the ladies and Mrs Tabitha did not fail to compliment him on his
modesty in waving the merit of his ancestry adding that it was the
less necessary to him as he had such a considerable fund of his
own She now began to glew herself to his favour with the grossest
adulationShe expatiated upon the antiquity and virtues of the
Scottish nation upon their valour probity learning and politeness
She even descended to encomiums on his own personal address his
gallantry good sense and eruditionShe appealed to her brother
whether the captain was not the very image of our cousin governor
Griffith She discovered a surprising eagerness to know the particulars
of his life and asked a thousand questions concerning his atchievements
in war all which Mr Lismahago answered with a sort of jesuitical
reserve affecting a reluctance to satisfy her curiosity on a subject
that concerned his own exploits

By dint of her interrogations however we learned that he and ensign
Murphy had made their escape from the French hospital at Montreal and
taken to the woods in hope of reaching some English settlement but
mistaking their route they fell in with a party of Miamis who carried
them away in captivity The intention of these Indians was to give one
of them as an adopted son to a venerable sachem who had lost his own
in the course of the war and to sacrifice the other according to the
custom of the country Murphy as being the younger and handsomer of the
two was designed to fill the place of the deceased not only as the
son of the sachem but as the spouse of a beautiful squaw to whom his
predecessor had been betrothed but in passing through the different
whigwhams or villages of the Miamis poor Murphy was so mangled by the
women and children who have the privilege of torturing all prisoners
in their passage that by the time they arrived at the place of the
sachems residence he was rendered altogether unfit for the purposes of
marriage it was determined therefore in the assembly of the warriors
that ensign Murphy should be brought to the stake and that the lady
should be given to lieutenant Lismahago who had likewise received his
share of torments though they had not produced emasculationA joint
of one finger had been cut or rather sawed off with a rusty knife one
of his great toes was crushed into a mash betwixt two stones some of
his teeth were drawn or dug out with a crooked nail splintered reeds
had been thrust up his nostrils and other tender parts and the calves
of his legs had been blown up with mines of gunpowder dug in the flesh
with the sharp point of the tomahawk

The Indians themselves allowed that Murphy died with great heroism
singing as his death song the Drimmendoo in concert with Mr
Lismahago who was present at the solemnity After the warriors and the
matrons had made a hearty meal upon the muscular flesh which they pared
from the victim and had applied a great variety of tortures which he
bore without flinching an old lady with a sharp knife scooped out
one of his eyes and put a burning coal in the socket The pain of this
operation was so exquisite that he could not help bellowing upon which
the audience raised a shout of exultation and one of the warriors
stealing behind him gave him the coup de grace with a hatchet

Lismahagos bride the squaw Squinkinacoosta distinguished herself on
this occasionShe shewed a great superiority of genius in the tortures
which she contrived and executed with her own handsShe vied with the
stoutest warrior in eating the flesh of the sacrifice and after all
the other females were fuddled with dramdrinking she was not so
intoxicated but that she was able to play the game of the platter with
the conjuring sachem and afterwards go through the ceremony of her own
wedding which was consummated that same evening The captain had lived
very happily with this accomplished squaw for two years during which
she bore him a son who is now the representative of his mothers tribe
but at length to his unspeakable grief she had died of a fever
occasioned by eating too much raw bear which they had killed in a
hunting excursion

By this time Mr Lismahago was elected sachem acknowledged first
warrior of the Badger tribe and dignified with the name or epithet of
Occacanastaogarora which signifies nimble as a weasel but all these
advantages and honours he was obliged to resign in consequence of being
exchanged for the orator of the community who had been taken prisoner
by the Indians that were in alliance with the English At the peace he
had sold out upon half pay and was returned to Britain with a view
to pass the rest of his life in his own country where he hoped to
find some retreat where his slender finances would afford him a decent
subsistence Such are the outlines of Mr Lismahagos history to which
Tabitha did seriously incline her earindeed she seemed to be taken
with the same charms that captivated the heart of Desdemona who loved
the Moor for the dangers he had past

The description of poor Murphys sufferings which threw my sister Liddy
into a swoon extracted some sighs from the breast of Mrs Tabby when
she understood he had been rendered unfit for marriage she began to
spit and ejaculated Jesus what cruel barbarians and she made wry
faces at the ladys nuptial repast but she was eagerly curious to know
the particulars of her marriagedress whether she wore highbreasted
stays or bodice a robe of silk or velvet and laces of Mechlin or
minionetteshe supposed as they were connected with the French
she used rouge and had her hair dressed in the Parisian fashion The
captain would have declined giving a catagorical explanation of all
these particulars observing in general that the Indians were
too tenacious of their own customs to adopt the modes of any nation
whatsoever he said moreover that neither the simplicity of their
manners nor the commerce of their country would admit of those articles
of luxury which are deemed magnificence in Europe and that they were
too virtuous and sensible to encourage the introduction of any fashion
which might help to render them corrupt and effeminate

These observations served only to inflame her desire of knowing the
particulars about which she had enquired and with all his evasion
he could not help discovering the following circumstancesthat
his princess had neither shoes stockings shift nor any kind of
linenthat her bridal dress consisted of a petticoat of red bays and a
fringed blanket fastened about her shoulders with a copper skewer but
of ornaments she had great plentyHer hair was curiously plaited and
interwoven with bobbins of human boneone eyelid was painted green
and the other yellow the cheeks were blue the lips white the teeth
red and there was a black list drawn down the middle of the forehead
as far as the tip of the nosea couple of gaudy parrots feathers were
stuck through the division of the nostrilsthere was a blue stone set
in the chin her earrings consisted of two pieces of hickery of the
size and shape of drumsticksher arms and legs were adorned with
bracelets of wampumher breast glittered with numerous strings of glass
beadsshe wore a curious pouch or pocket of woven grass elegantly
painted with various coloursabout her neck was hung the fresh scalp
of a Mohawk warrior whom her deceased lover had lately slain in
battleand finally she was anointed from head to foot with bears
grease which sent forth a most agreeable odour

One would imagine that these paraphernalia would not have been much
admired by a modern fine lady but Mrs Tabitha was resolved to approve
of all the captains connexionsShe wished indeed the squaw had been
better provided with linen but she owned there was much taste and
fancy in her ornaments she made no doubt therefore that madam
Squinkinacoosta was a young lady of good sense and rare accomplishments
and a good christian at bottom Then she asked whether his consort had
been high church or lowchurch presbyterian or anabaptist or had been
favoured with any glimmering of the new light of the gospel When he
confessed that she and her whole nation were utter strangers to the
christian faith she gazed at him with signs of astonishment and
Humphry Clinker who chanced to be in the room uttered a hollow groan

After some pause In the name of God captain Lismahago cried she
what religion do they profess As to religion madam answered
the lieutenant it is among those Indians a matter of great
simplicitythey never heard of any Alliance between Church and
StateThey in general worship two contending principles one the
Fountain of all Good the other the source of all evil The common
people there as in other countries run into the absurdities of
superstition but sensible men pay adoration to a Supreme Being who
created and sustains the universe O what pity exclaimed the pious
Tabby that some holy man has not been inspired to go and convert these
poor heathens

The lieutenant told her that while he resided among them two French
missionaries arrived in order to convert them to the catholic religion
but when they talked of mysteries and revelations which they could
neither explain nor authenticate and called in the evidence of miracles
which they believed upon hearsay when they taught that the Supreme
Creator of Heaven and Earth had allowed his only Son his own equal in
power and glory to enter the bowels of a woman to be born as a
human creature to be insulted flagellated and even executed as a
malefactor when they pretended to create God himself to swallow
digest revive and multiply him ad infinitum by the help of a little
flour and water the Indians were shocked at the impiety of their
presumptionThey were examined by the assembly of the sachems
who desired them to prove the divinity of their mission by some
miracleThey answered that it was not in their powerIf you were
really sent by Heaven for our conversion said one of the sachems you
would certainly have some supernatural endowments at least you would
have the gift of tongues in order to explain your doctrine to the
different nations among which you are employed but you are so ignorant
of our language that you cannot express yourselves even on the most
trifling subjects In a word the assembly were convinced of their
being cheats and even suspected them of being spies they ordered them
a bag of Indian corn apiece and appointed a guide to conduct them to
the frontiers but the missionaries having more zeal than discretion
refused to quit the vineyardThey persisted in saying mass in
preaching baptizing and squabbling with the conjurers or priests
of the country till they had thrown the whole community into
confusionThen the assembly proceeded to try them as impious
impostors who represented the Almighty as a trifling weak capricious
being and pretended to make unmake and reproduce him at pleasure
they were therefore convicted of blasphemy and sedition and condemned
to the stale where they died singing Salve regina in a rapture of joy
for the crown of martyrdom which they had thus obtained

In the course of this conversation lieutenant Lismahago dropt some
hints by which it appeared he himself was a freethinker Our aunt
seemed to be startled at certain sarcasms he threw out against the creed
of saint AthanasiusHe dwelt much upon the words reason philosophy
and contradiction in termshe bid defiance to the eternity of
hellfire and even threw such squibs at the immortality of the soul as
singed a little the whiskers of Mrs Tabithas faith for by this
time she began to look upon Lismahago as a prodigy of learning and
sagacityIn short he could be no longer insensible to the advances
she made towards his affection and although there was something
repulsive in his nature he overcame it so far as to make some return
to her civilitiesPerhaps he thought it would be no bad scheme in
a superannuated lieutenant on halfpay to effect a conjunction with an
old maid who in all probability had fortune enough to keep him easy
and comfortable in the fagend of his daysAn ogling correspondence
forthwith commenced between this amiable pair of originalsHe began
to sweeten the natural acidity of his discourse with the treacle of
compliment and commendationHe from time to time offered her snuff of
which he himself took great quantities and even made her a present of a
purse of silk grass woven by the hands of the amiable Squinkinacoosta
who had used it as a shotpouch in her hunting expeditions

From Doncaster northwards all the windows of all the inns are scrawled
with doggeral rhimes in abuse of the Scotch nation and what surprised
me very much I did not perceive one line written in the way of
recriminationCurious to hear what Lismahago would say on this subject
I pointed out to him a very scurrilous epigram against his countrymen
which was engraved on one of the windows of the parlour where we
satHe read it with the most starched composure and when I asked his
opinion of the poetry It is vara terse and vara poignant said he
but with the help of a wat dishclout it might be rendered more clear
and parspicuousI marvel much that some modern wit has not published a
collection of these essays under the title of the Glaziers Triumph over
Sawney the ScotIm persuaded it would be a vara agreeable offering to
the patriots of London and Westminster When I expressed some surprize
that the natives of Scotland who travel this way had not broke all the
windows upon the road With submission replied the lieutenant that
were but shallow policyit would only serve to make the satire more
cutting and severe and I think it is much better to let it stand in the
window than have it presented in the reckoning

My uncles jaws began to quiver with indignationHe said the
scribblers of such infamous stuff deserved to be scourged at the carts
tail for disgracing their country with such monuments of malice and
stupidityThese vermin said he do not consider that they are
affording their fellow subjects whom they abuse continual matter
of selfgratulation as well as the means of executing the most manly
vengeance that can be taken for such low illiberal attacks For my
part I admire the philosophic forbearance of the Scots as much as I
despise the insolence of those wretched libellers which is akin to
the arrogance of the village cock who never crows but upon his own
dunghill The captain with an affectation of candour observed that
men of illiberal minds were produced in every soil that in supposing
those were the sentiments of the English in general he should pay
too great a compliment to is own country which was not of consequence
enough to attract the envy of such a flourishing and powerful people

Mrs Tabby broke forth again in praise of his moderation and declared
that Scotland was the soil which produced every virtue under heaven
When Lismahago took his leave for the night she asked her brother
if the captain was not the prettiest gentleman he had ever seen and
whether there was not something wonderfully engaging in his aspectMr
Bramble having eyed her sometime in silence Sister said he the
lieutenant is for aught I know an honest man and a good officerhe
has a considerable share of understanding and a title to more
encouragement than he seems to have met with in life but I cannot with
a safe conscience affirm that he is the prettiest gentleman I ever
saw neither can I descern any engaging charm in his countenance which
I vow to God is on the contrary very hardfavoured and forbidding

I have endeavoured to ingratiate myself with this NorthBriton who is
really a curiosity but he has been very shy of my conversation ever
since I laughed at his asserting that the English tongue was spoke with
more propriety at Edinburgh than at London Looking at me with a double
squeeze of souring in his aspect If the old definition be true said
he that risibility is the distinguishing characteristic of a rational
creature the English are the most distinguished for rationality of any
people I ever knew I owned that the English were easily struck with
any thing that appeared ludicrous and apt to laugh accordingly but it
did not follow that because they were more given to laughter they had
more rationality than their neighbours I said such an inference
would be an injury to the Scots who were by no means defective in
rationality though generally supposed little subject to the impressions
of humour

The captain answered that this supposition must have been deduced
either from their conversation or their compositions of which the
English could not possibly judge with precision as they did not
understand the dialect used by the Scots in common discourse as well
as in their works of humour When I desired to know what those works
of humour were he mentioned a considerable number of pieces which
he insisted were equal in point of humour to any thing extant in any
language dead or livingHe in particular recommended a collection of
detached poems in two small volumes intituled The EverGreen and
the works of Allan Ramsay which I intend to provide myself with at
EdinburghHe observed that a NorthBriton is seen to a disadvantage
in an English company because he speaks in a dialect that they cant
relish and in a phraseology which they dont understandHe therefore
finds himself under a restraint which is a great enemy to wit and
humourThese are faculties which never appear in full lustre but when
the mind is perfectly at ease and as an excellent writer says enjoys
her elbowroom

He proceeded to explain his assertion that the English language was
spoken with greater propriety at Edinburgh than in London He said what
we generally called the Scottish dialect was in fact true genuine old
English with a mixture of some French terms and idioms adopted in a
long intercourse betwixt the French and Scotch nations that the modern
English from affectation and false refinement had weakened and even
corrupted their language by throwing out the guttural sounds altering
the pronunciation and the quantity and disusing many words and terms
of great significance In consequence of these innovations the works
of our best poets such as Chaucer Spenser and even Shakespeare were
become in many parts unintelligible to the natives of South Britain
whereas the Scots who retain the antient language understand them
without the help of a glossary For instance said he how have
your commentators been puzzled by the following expression in the
TempestHes gentle and not fearful as if it was a paralogism to say
that being gentle he must of course be courageous but the truth is
one of the original meanings if not the sole meaning of that word was
noble highminded and to this day a Scotch woman in the situation of
the young lady in the Tempest would express herself nearly in the same
termsDont provoke him for being gentle that is highspirited he
wont tamely bear an insult Spenser in the very first stanza of his
Fairy Queen says

 A gentle knight was pricking on the plain
 Which knight far from being tame and fearful was so stout that
 Nothing did he dread but ever was ydrad

To prove that we had impaired the energy of our language by false
refinement he mentioned the following words which though widely
different in signification are pronounced exactly in the same manner
wright write right rite but among the Scots these words are as
different in pronunciation as they are in meaning and orthography
and this is the case with many others which he mentioned by way of
illustrationHe moreover took notice that we had for what reason
he could never learn altered the sound of our vowels from that which is
retained by all the nations in Europe an alteration which rendered
the language extremely difficult to foreigners and made it
almost impracticable to lay down general rules for orthography and
pronunciation Besides the vowels were no longer simple sounds in
the mouth of an Englishman who pronounced both i and u as dipthongs
Finally he affirmed that we mumbled our speech with our lips and
teeth and ran the words together without pause or distinction in such
a manner that a foreigner though he understood English tolerably well
was often obliged to have recourse to a Scotchman to explain what a
native of England had said in his own language

The truth of this remark was confirmed by Mr Bramble from his own
experience but he accounted for it on another principle He said
the same observation would hold in all languages that a Swiss talking
French was more easily understood than a Parisian by a foreigner who
had not made himself master of the language because every language
had its peculiar recitative and it would always require more pains
attention and practice to acquire both the words and the music than
to learn the words only and yet no body would deny that the one
was imperfect without the other he therefore apprehended that the
Scotchman and the Swiss were better understood by learners because they
spoke the words only without the music which they could not rehearse
One would imagine this check might have damped the North Briton but it
served only to agitate his humour for disputationHe said if every
nation had its own recitative or music the Scots had theirs and the
Scotchman who had not yet acquired the cadence of the English would
naturally use his own in speaking their language therefore if he
was better understood than the native his recitative must be more
intelligible than that of the English of consequence the dialect of
the Scots had an advantage over that of their fellowsubjects and this
was another strong presumption that the modern English had corrupted
their language in the article of pronunciation

The lieutenant was by this time become so polemical that every time
he opened his mouth out flew a paradox which he maintained with all the
enthusiasm of altercation but all his paradoxes favoured strong of a
partiality for his own country He undertook to prove that poverty was
a blessing to a nation that oatmeal was preferable to wheatflour and
that the worship of Cloacina in temples which admitted both sexes and
every rank of votaries promiscuously was a filthy species of idolatry
that outraged every idea of delicacy and decorum I did not so much
wonder at his broaching these doctrines as at the arguments equally
whimsical and ingenious which he adduced in support of them

In fine lieutenant Lismahago is a curiosity which I have not yet
sufficiently perused and therefore I shall be sorry when we lose his
company though God knows there is nothing very amiable in his manner
or dispositionAs he goes directly to the southwest division of
Scotland and we proceed in the road to Berwick we shall part tomorrow
at a place called Feltonbridge and I dare say this separation will
be very grievous to our aunt Mrs Tabitha unless she has received some
flattering assurance of his meeting her again If I fail in my purpose
of entertaining you with these unimportant occurrences they will at
least serve as exercises of patience for which you are indebted to


Yours always J MELFORD MORPETH July 13




To Dr LEWIS

DEAR DOCTOR

I have now reached the northern extremity of England and see close to
my chamberwindow the Tweed gliding through the arches of that bridge
which connects this suburb to the town of BerwickYorkshire you have
seen and therefore I shall say nothing of that opulent province
The city of Durham appears like a confused heap of stones and brick
accumulated so as to cover a mountain round which a river winds its
brawling course The Streets are generally narrow dark and unpleasant
and many of them almost impassible in consequence of their declivity
The cathedral is a huge gloomy pile but the clergy are well lodged
The bishop lives in a princely mannerthe golden prebends keep
plentiful tablesand I am told there is some good sociable company in
the place but the country when viewed from the top of GatesheadFell
which extends to Newcastle exhibits the highest scene of cultivation
that ever I beheld As for Newcastle it lies mostly in a bottom on the
banks of the Tyne and makes an appearance still more disagreeable than
that of Durham but it is rendered populous and rich by industry and
commerce and the country lying on both sides the river above the town
yields a delightful prospect of agriculture and plantation Morpeth and
Alnwick are neat pretty towns and this last is famous for the castle
which has belonged so many ages to the noble house of Piercy earls of
NorthumberlandIt is doubtless a large edifice containing a great
number of apartments and stands in a commanding situation but the
strength of it seems to have consisted not so much in its site or the
manner in which it is fortified as in the valour of its defendants

Our adventures since we left Scarborough are scarce worth reciting
and yet I must make you acquainted with my sister Tabbys progress in
husbandhunting after her disappointments at Bath and London She had
actually begun to practise upon a certain adventurer who was in fact
a highwayman by profession but he had been used to snares much more
dangerous than any she could lay and escaped accordingly Then she
opened her batteries upon an old weatherbeaten Scotch lieutenant
called Lismahago who joined us at Durham and is I think one of the
most singular personages I ever encounteredHis manner is as harsh
as his countenance but his peculiar turn of thinking and his pack of
knowledge made up of the remnants of rarities rendered his conversation
desirable in spite of his pedantry and ungracious address I have often
met with a crabapple in a hedge which I have been tempted to eat for
its flavour even while I was disgusted by its austerity The spirit of
contradiction is naturally so strong in Lismahago that I believe in
my conscience he has rummaged and read and studied with indefatigable
attention in order to qualify himself to refute established maxims and
thus raise trophies for the gratification of polemical prideSuch is
the asperity of his selfconceit that he will not even acquiesce in a
transient compliment made to his own individual in particular or to his
country in general

When I observed that he must have read a vast number of books to be
able to discourse on such a variety of subjects he declared he had read
little or nothing and asked how he should find books among the woods
of America where he had spent the greatest part of his life My nephew
remarking that the Scots in general were famous for their learning he
denied the imputation and defied him to prove it from their worksThe
Scots said he have a slight tincture of letters with which they make
a parade among people who are more illiterate than themselves but they
may be said to float on the surface of science and they have made very
small advances in the useful arts At least cried Tabby all
the world allows that the Scots behaved gloriously in fighting and
conquering the savages of America I can assure you madam you have
been misinformed replied the lieutenant in that continent the
Scots did nothing more than their duty nor was there one corps in his
majestys service that distinguished itself more than anotherThose
who affected to extol the Scots for superior merit were no friends to
that nation

Though he himself made free with his countrymen he would not suffer
any other person to glance a sarcasm at them with impunity One of the
company chancing to mention lord Bs inglorious peace the lieutenant
immediately took up the cudgels in his lordships favour and
argued very strenuously to prove that it was the most honourable and
advantageous peace that England had ever made since the foundation of
the monarchyNay between friends he offered such reasons on this
subject that I was really confounded if not convincedHe would not
allow that the Scots abounded above their proportion in the army and
navy of GreatBritain or that the English had any reason to say his
countrymen had met with extraordinary encouragement in the service
When a South and NorthBriton said he are competitors for a place
or commission which is in the disposal of an English minister or an
English general it would be absurd to suppose that the preference will
not be given to the native of England who has so many advantages over
his rivalFirst and foremost he has in his favour that laudable
partiality which Mr Addison says never fails to cleave to the heart
of an Englishman secondly he has more powerful connexions and a
greater share of parliamentary interest by which those contests are
generally decided and lastly he has a greater command of money to
smooth the way to his success For my own part said he I know no
Scotch officer who has risen in the army above the rank of a subaltern
without purchasing every degree of preferment either with money or
recruits but I know many gentlemen of that country who for want of
money and interest have grown grey in the rank of lieutenants whereas
very few instances of this illfortune are to be found among the natives
of SouthBritainNot that I would insinuate that my countrymen have
the least reason to complain Preferment in the service like success
in any other branch of traffic will naturally favour those who have
the greatest stock of cash and credit merit and capacity being supposed
equal on all sides

But the most hardy of all this originals positions were these That
commerce would sooner or later prove the ruin of every nation where
it flourishes to any extentthat the parliament was the rotten part of
the British constitutionthat the liberty of the press was a national
eviland that the boasted institution of juries as managed in England
was productive of shameful perjury and flagrant injustice He observed
that traffick was an enemy to all the liberal passions of the soul
founded on the thirst of lucre a sordid disposition to take advantage
of the necessities of our fellow creaturesHe affirmed the nature
of commerce was such that it could not be fixed or perpetuated but
having flowed to a certain height would immediately begin to ebb and
so continue till the channels should be left almost dry but there
was no instance of the tides rising a second time to any considerable
influx in the same nation Mean while the sudden affluence occasioned
by trade forced open all the sluices of luxury and overflowed the land
with every species of profligacy and corruption a total pravity of
manners would ensue and this must be attended with bankruptcy and ruin
He observed of the parliament that the practice of buying boroughs
and canvassing for votes was an avowed system of venality already
established on the ruins of principle integrity faith and good order
in consequence of which the elected and the elector and in short the
whole body of the people were equally and universally contaminated and
corrupted He affirmed that of a parliament thus constituted the crown
would always have influence enough to secure a great majority in its
dependence from the great number of posts places and pensions it
had to bestow that such a parliament would as it had already done
lengthen the term of its sitting and authority whenever the prince
should think it for his interest to continue the representatives for
without doubt they had the same right to protect their authority ad
infinitum as they had to extend it from three to seven yearsWith a
parliament therefore dependent upon the crown devoted to the prince
and supported by a standing army garbled and modelled for the purpose
any king of England may and probably some ambitious sovereign will
totally overthrow all the bulwarks of the constitution for it is not
to be supposed that a prince of high spirit will tamely submit to be
thwarted in all his measures abused and insulted by a populace of
unbridled ferocity when he has it in his power to crush all opposition
under his feet with the concurrence of the legislature He said he
should always consider the liberty of the press as a national evil
while it enabled the vilest reptile to soil the lustre of the most
shining merit and furnished the most infamous incendiary with the means
of disturbing the peace and destroying the good order of the community
He owned however that under due restrictions it would be a valuable
privilege but affirmed that at present there was no law in England
sufficient to restrain it within proper bounds

With respect to juries he expressed himself to this effectjuries
are generally composed of illiterate plebeians apt to be mistaken
easily misled and open to sinister influence for if either of the
parties to be tried can gain over one of the twelve jurors he has
secured the verdict in his favour the juryman thus brought over will
in despight of all evidence and conviction generally hold out till his
fellows are fatigued and harassed and starved into concurrence in
which case the verdict is unjust and the jurors are all perjured but
cases will often occur when the jurors are really divided in opinion
and each side is convinced in opposition to the other but no verdict
will be received unless they are unanimous and they are all bound not
only in conscience but by oath to judge and declare according to their
convictionWhat then will be the consequenceThey must either
starve in company or one side must sacrifice their conscience to their
convenience and join in a verdict which they believe to be false This
absurdity is avoided in Sweden where a bare majority is sufficient and
in Scotland where two thirds of the jury are required to concur in the
verdict

You must not imagine that all these deductions were made on his part
without contradictions on mineNothe truth is I found myself piqued
in point of honour at his pretending to be so much wiser than his
neighboursI questioned all his assertions started innumerable
objections argued and wrangled with uncommon perseverance and grew
very warm and even violent in the debateSometimes he was puzzled
and once or twice I think fairly refuted but from those falls he rose
again like Antaeus with redoubled vigour till at length I was tired
exhausted and really did not know how to proceed when luckily he
dropped a hint by which he discovered he had been bred to the law
a confession which enabled me to retire from the dispute with a good
grace as it could not be supposed that a man like me who had been bred
to nothing should be able to cope with a veteran in his own profession
I believe however that I shall for some time continue to chew the cud
of reflection upon many observations which this original discharged

Whether our sister Tabby was really struck with his conversation or is
resolved to throw at every thing she meets in the shape of a man till
she can fasten the matrimonial noose certain it is she has taken
desperate strides towards the affection of Lismahago who cannot be said
to have met her half way though he does not seem altogether insensible
to her civilitiesShe insinuated more than once how happy we should be
to have his company through that part of Scotland which we proposed
to visit till at length he plainly told us that his road was totally
different from that which we intended to take that for his part his
company would be of very little service to us in our progress as he was
utterly unacquainted with the country which he had left in his early
youth consequently he could neither direct us in our enquiries nor
introduce us to any family of distinction He said he was stimulated
by an irresistible impulse to revisit the paternus lar or patria domus
though he expected little satisfaction inasmuch as he understood that
his nephew the present possessor was but ill qualified to support the
honour of the familyHe assured us however as we design to return by
the west road that he will watch our motions and endeavour to pay his
respects to us at DumfriesAccordingly he took his leave of us at a
place half way betwixt Morpeth and Alnwick and pranced away in great
state mounted on a tall meagre rawboned shambling grey gelding
without eer a tooth in his head the very counterpart of the rider
and indeed the appearance of the two was so picturesque that I would
give twenty guineas to have them tolerably presented on canvas

Northumberland is a fine county extending to the Tweed which is a
pleasant pastoral stream but you will be surprised when I tell you
that the English side of that river is neither so well cultivated nor
so populous as the otherThe farms are thinly scattered the lands
uninclosed and scarce a gentlemans seat is to be seen in some miles
from the Tweed whereas the Scots are advanced in crowds to the very
brink of the river so that you may reckon above thirty good houses in
the compass of a few miles belonging to proprietors whose ancestors had
fortified castles in the same situations a circumstance that shews what
dangerous neighbours the Scots must have formerly been to the northern
counties of England

Our domestic oeconomy continues on the old footingMy sister Tabby
still adheres to methodism and had the benefit of a sermon at Wesleys
meeting in Newcastle but I believe the Passion of love has in some
measure abated the fervour of devotion both in her and her woman
Mrs Jenkins about whose good graces there has been a violent contest
betwixt my nephews valet Mr Dutton and my man Humphry ClinkerJery
has been obliged to interpose his authority to keep the peace and to
him I have left the discussion of that important affair which had like
to have kindled the flames of discord in the family of

Yours always MATT BRAMBLE TWEEDMOUTH July 15




To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart at Oxon

DEAR WAT

In my two last you had so much of Lismahago that I suppose you are
glad he is gone off the stage for the presentI must now descend
to domestic occurrencesLove it seems is resolved to assert his
dominion over all the females of our familyAfter having practised
upon poor Liddys heart and played strange vagaries with our aunt
Mrs Tabitha he began to run riot in the affections of her woman Mrs
Winifred Jenkins whom I have had occasion to mention more than once in
the course of our memoirs Nature intended Jenkins for something very
different from the character of her mistress yet custom and habit have
effected a wonderful resemblance betwixt them in many particulars Win
to be sure is much younger and more agreeable in her person she is
likewise tenderhearted and benevolent qualities for which her mistress
is by no means remarkable no more than she is for being of a timorous
disposition and much subject to fits of the mother which are the
infirmities of Wins constitution but then she seems to have adopted
Mrs Tabbys manner with her cast cloathsShe dresses and endeavours
to look like her mistress although her own looks are much more
engagingShe enters into her scheme of oeconomy learns her phrases
repeats her remarks imitates her stile in scolding the inferior
servants and finally subscribes implicitly to her system of
devotionThis indeed she found the more agreeable as it was in a
great measure introduced and confirmed by the ministry of Clinker
with whose personal merit she seems to have been struck ever since he
exhibited the pattern of his naked skin at Marlborough

Nevertheless though Humphry had this double hank upon her inclinations
and exerted all his power to maintain the conquest he had made he found
it impossible to guard it on the side of vanity where poor Win was as
frail as any female in the kingdom In short my rascal Dutton professed
himself her admirer and by dint of his outlandish qualifications
threw his rival Clinker out of the saddle of her heart Humphry may be
compared to an English pudding composed of good wholesome flour and
suet and Dutton to a syllabub or iced froth which though agreeable
to the taste has nothing solid or substantial The traitor not only
dazzled her with his secondhand finery but he fawned and flattered
and cringedhe taught her to take rappee and presented her with
a snuffbox of papier machehe supplied her with a powder for her
teethhe mended her complexion and he dressed her hair in the Paris
fashionhe undertook to be her French master and her dancingmaster
as well as friseur and thus imperceptibly wound himself into her good
graces Clinker perceived the progress he had made and repined in
secretHe attempted to open her eyes in the way of exhortation and
finding it produced no effect had recourse to prayer At Newcastle
while he attended Mrs Tabby to the methodist meeting his rival
accompanied Mrs Jenkins to the play He was dressed in a silk coat made
at Paris for his former master with a tawdry waistcoat of tarnished
brocade he wore his hair in a great bag with a huge solitaire and a
long sword dangled from his thigh The lady was all of a flutter with
faded lutestring washed gauze and ribbons three times refreshed but
she was most remarkable for the frisure of her head which rose like
a pyramid seven inches above the scalp and her face was primed and
patched from the chin up to the eyes nay the gallant himself had
spared neither red nor white in improving the nature of his own
complexion In this attire they walked together through the high street
to the theatre and as they passed for players ready dressed for
acting they reached it unmolested but as it was still light when they
returned and by that time the people had got information of their real
character and condition they hissed and hooted all the way and Mrs
Jenkins was all bespattered with dirt as well as insulted with
the opprobrious name of painted Jezabel so that her fright and
mortification threw her into an hysteric fit the moment she came home

Clinker was so incensed at Dutton whom he considered as the cause of
her disgrace that he upbraided him severely for having turned the
poor womans brain The other affected to treat him with contempt and
mistaking his forbearance for want of courage threatened to horsewhip
him into good manners Humphry then came to me humbly begging I
would give him leave to chastise my servant for his insolenceHe has
challenged me to fight him at swords point said he but I might as
well challenge him to make a horseshoe or a plough iron for I know no
more of the one than he does of the otherBesides it doth not become
servants to use those weapons or to claim the privilege of gentlemen
to kill one another when they fall out moreover I would not have
his blood upon my conscience for ten thousand times the profit or
satisfaction I should get by his death but if your honour wont be
angry Ill engage to gee en a good drubbing that may hap will do
en service and Ill take care it shall do en no harm I said I had
no objection to what he proposed provided he could manage matters so as
not to be found the aggressor in case Dutton should prosecute him for
an assault and battery

Thus licensed he retired and that same evening easily provoked
his rival to strike the first blow which Clinker returned with such
interest that he was obliged to call for quarter declaring at the same
time that he would exact severe and bloody satisfaction the moment we
should pass the border when he could run him through the body without
fear of the consequenceThis scene passed in presence of lieutenant
Lismahago who encouraged Clinker to hazard a thrust of cold iron with
his antagonist Cold iron cried Humphry I shall never use against
the life of any human creature but I am so far from being afraid of
his cold iron that I shall use nothing in my defence but a good cudgel
which shall always be at his service In the mean time the fair
cause of this contest Mrs Winifred Jenkins seemed overwhelmed with
affliction and Mr Clinker acted much on the reserve though he did not
presume to find fault with her conduct

The dispute between the two rivals was soon brought to a very unexpected
issue Among our fellowlodgers at Berwick was a couple from London
bound to Edinburgh on the voyage of matrimony The female was the
daughter and heiress of a pawnbroker deceased who had given her
guardians the slip and put herself under the tuition of a tall
Hibernian who had conducted her thus far in quest of a clergyman to
unite them in marriage without the formalities required by the law
of England I know not how the lover had behaved on the road so as to
decline in the favour of his inamorata but in all probability Dutton
perceived a coldness on her side which encouraged him to whisper
it was a pity she should have cast affections upon a taylor which he
affirmed the Irishman to be This discovery completed her disgust of
which my man taking the advantage began to recommend himself to her
good graces and the smoothtongued rascal found no difficulty to
insinuate himself into the place of her heart from which the other had
been discardedTheir resolution was immediately taken In the morning
before day while poor Teague lay snoring abed his indefatigable rival
ordered a postchaise and set out with the lady for Coldstream a few
miles up the Tweed where there was a parson who dealt in this branch of
commerce and there they were noosed before the Irishman ever dreamt
of the matter But when he got up at six oclock and found the bird was
flown he made such a noise as alarmed the whole house One of the first
persons he encountered was the postilion returned from Coldstream
where he had been witness to the marriage and over and above an
handsome gratuity had received a brides favour which he now wore in
his capWhen the forsaken lover understood they were actually married
and set out for London and that Dutton had discovered to the lady that
he the Hibernian was a taylor he had like to have run distracted He
tore the ribbon from the fellows cap and beat it about his ears
He swore he would pursue him to the gates of hell and ordered
a postchaise and four to be got ready as soon as possible but
recollecting that his finances would not admit of this way of
travelling he was obliged to countermand this order

For my part I knew nothing at all of what had happened till the
postilion brought me the keys of my trunk and portmanteau which he had
received from Dutton who sent me his respects hoping I would excuse
him for his abrupt departure as it was a step upon which his fortune
depended Before I had time to make my uncle acquainted with this
event the Irishman burst into my chamber without any introduction
exclaimingBy my soul your sarvant has robbed me of five
thousand pounds and Ill have satisfaction if I should be hanged
tomorrowWhen I asked him who he was My name said he is Master
Macloughlin but it should be Leighlin Oneale for I am come from
TirOwen the Great and so I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland
and that rogue your sarvant said I was a taylor which was as big
a lie as if he had called me the popeIm a man of fortune and have
spent all I had and so being in distress Mr Coshgrave the fashioner
in Shuffolkstreet tuck me out and made me his own private shecretary
by the same token I was the last he bailed for his friends obliged him
to tie himself up that he would bail no more above ten pounds for why
becaase as how he could not refuse any body that asked and therefore
in time would have robbed himself of his whole fortune and if he had
lived long at that rate must have died bankrupt very soon and so I
made my addresses to Miss Skinner a young lady of five thousand pounds
fortune who agreed to take me for better nor worse and to be sure
this day would have put me in possession if it had not been for that
rogue your sarvant who came like a tief and stole away my property
and made her believe I was a taylor and that she was going to marry the
ninth part of a man but the devil burn my soul if ever I catch him on
the mountains of Tulloghobegly if I dont shew him that Im nine times
as good a man as he or eer a bug of his country

When he had rung out his first alarm I told him I was sorry he had
allowed himself to be so jockied but it was no business of mine and
that the fellow who robbed him of his bride had likewise robbed me of
my servantDidnt I tell you then cried he that Rogue was his true
Christian nameOh if I had but one fair trust with him upon the sod
Id give him lave to brag all the rest of his life

My uncle hearing the noise came in and being informed of this
adventure began to comfort Mr Oneale for the ladys elopement
observing that he seemed to have had a lucky escape that it was better
she should elope before than after marriageThe Hibernian was of a
very different opinion He said If he had been once married she might
have eloped as soon as she pleased he would have taken care that she
should not have carried her fortune along with herAh said he shes
a Judas Iscariot and has betrayed me with a kiss and like Judas she
carried the bag and has not left me money enough to bear my expences
back to London and so Im come to this pass and the rogue that was
the occasion of it has left you without a sarvant you may put me in his
place and by Jasus it is the best thing you can doI begged to be
excused declaring I could put up with any inconvenience rather than
treat as a footman the descendant of TirOwen the Great I advised
him to return to his friend Mr Cosgrave and take his passage from
Newcastle by sea towards which I made him a small present and he
retired seemingly resigned to his evil fortune I have taken upon trial
a Scotchman called Archy MAlpin an old soldier whose last master a
colonel lately died at Berwick The fellow is old and withered but he
has been recommended to me for his fidelity by Mrs Humphreys a very
good sort of a woman who keeps the inn at Tweedmouth and is much
respected by all the travellers on this road

Clinker without doubt thinks himself happy in the removal of a
dangerous rival and he is too good a Christian to repine at Duttons
success Even Mrs Jenkins will have reason to congratulate herself upon
this event when she cooly reflects upon the matter for howsoever she
was forced from her poise for a season by snares laid for her vanity
Humphry is certainly the northstar to which the needle of her affection
would have pointed at the long run At present the same vanity is
exceedingly mortified upon finding herself abandoned by her new
admirer in favour of another inamorata She received the news with a
violent burst of laughter which soon brought on a fit of crying and
this gave the finishing blow to the patience of her mistress which had
held out beyond all expectation She now opened all those floodgates of
reprehension which had been shut so long She not only reproached
her with her levity and indiscretion but attacked her on the score
of religion declaring roundly that she was in a state of apostacy
and reprobation and finally threatened to send her a packing at this
extremity of the kingdom All the family interceded for poor Winifred
not even excepting her slighted swain Mr Clinker who on his knees
implored and obtained her pardon

There was however another consideration that gave Mrs Tabitha some
disturbance At Newcastle the servants had been informed by some
wag that there was nothing to eat in Scotland but oatmeal and
sheepsheads and lieutenant Lismahago being consulted what he said
served rather to confirm than to refute the report Our aunt being
apprised of this circumstance very gravely advised her brother to
provide a sumpter horse with store of hams tongues bread biscuit and
other articles for our subsistence in the course of our peregrination
and Mr Bramble as gravely replied that he would take the hint into
consideration but finding no such provision was made she now revived
the proposal observing that there was a tolerable market at Berwick
where we might be supplied and that my mans horse would serve as a
beast of burthenThe squire shrugging his shoulders eyed her askance
with a look of ineffable contempt and after some pause Sister said
he I can hardly persuade myself you are serious She was so little
acquainted with the geography of the island that she imagined we could
not go to Scotland but by sea and after we had passed through the town
of Berwick when he told her we were upon Scottish ground she could
hardly believe the assertionIf the truth must be told the South
Britons in general are woefully ignorant in this particular What
between want of curiosity and traditional sarcasms the effect of
ancient animosity the people at the other end of the island know as
little of Scotland as of Japan

If I had never been in Wales I should have been more struck with the
manifest difference in appearance betwixt the peasants and commonalty
on different sides of the Tweed The boors of Northumberland are
lusty fellows fresh complexioned cleanly and well cloathed but the
labourers in Scotland are generally lank lean hardfeatured sallow
soiled and shabby and their little pinched blue caps have a beggarly
effect The cattle are much in the same stile with their drivers
meagre stunted and ill equipt When I talked to my uncle on this
subject he said Though all the Scottish hinds would not bear to be
compared with those of the rich counties of South Britain they would
stand very well in competition with the peasants of France Italy and
Savoynot to mention the mountaineers of Wales and the redshanks of
Ireland

We entered Scotland by a frightful moor of sixteen miles which promises
very little for the interior parts of the kingdom but the prospect
mended as we advanced Passing through Dunbar which is a neat little
town situated on the seaside we lay at a country inn where our
entertainment far exceeded our expectation but for this we cannot give
the Scots credit as the landlord is a native of England Yesterday we
dined at Haddington which has been a place of some consideration but
is now gone to decay and in the evening arrived at this metropolis of
which I can say very little It is very romantic from its situation
on the declivity of a hill having a fortified castle at the top and a
royal palace at the bottom The first thing that strikes the nose of
a stranger shall be nameless but what first strikes the eye is the
unconscionable height of the houses which generally rise to five six
seven and eight stories and in some places as I am assured
to twelve This manner of building attended with numberless
inconveniences must have been originally owing to want of room Certain
it is the town seems to be full of people but their looks their
language and their customs are so different from ours that I can
hardly believe myself in GreatBritain

The inn at which we put up if it may be so called was so filthy and
disagreeable in all respects that my uncle began to fret and his
gouty symptoms to recurRecollecting however that he had a letter
of recommendation to one Mr Mitchelson a lawyer he sent it by his
servant with a compliment importing that we would wait upon him next
day in person but that gentleman visited us immediately and insisted
upon our going to his own house until he could provide lodgings for our
accommodation We gladly accepted of his invitation and repaired to
his house where we were treated with equal elegance and hospitality to
the utter confusion of our aunt whose prejudices though beginning to
give way were not yet entirely removed Today by the assistance
of our friend we are settled in convenient lodgings up four pair
of stairs in the Highstreet the fourth story being in this city
reckoned more genteel than the first The air is in all probability
the better but it requires good lungs to breathe it at this distance
above the surface of the earthWhile I do remain above it whether
higher or lower provided I breathe at all


I shall ever be Dear Phillips yours J MELFORD July 18




To Dr LEWIS

DEAR LEWIS

That part of Scotland contiguous to Berwick nature seems to have
intended as a barrier between two hostile nations It is a brown desert
of considerable extent that produces nothing but heath and fern and
what rendered it the more dreary when we passed there was a thick fog
that hindered us from seeing above twenty yards from the carriageMy
sister began to make wry faces and use her smellingbottle Liddy
looked blank and Mrs Jenkins dejected but in a few hours these clouds
were dissipated the sea appeared upon our right and on the left the
mountains retired a little leaving an agreeable plain betwixt them
and the beach but what surprised us all this plain to the extent of
several miles was covered with as fine wheat as ever I saw in the most
fertile parts of South BritainThis plentiful crop is raised in the
open field without any inclosure or other manure than the alga marina
or seaweed which abounds on this coast a circumstance which shews
that the soil and climate are favourable but that agriculture in this
country is not yet brought to that perfection which it has attained
in England Inclosures would not only keep the grounds warm and the
several fields distinct but would also protect the crop from the high
winds which are so frequent in this part of the island

Dunbar is well situated for trade and has a curious bason where ships
of small burthen may be perfectly secure but there is little appearance
of business in the placeFrom thence all the way to Edinburgh there
is a continual succession of fine seats belonging to noblemen and
gentlemen and as each is surrounded by its own parks and plantation
they produce a very pleasing effect in a country which lies otherwise
open and exposed At Dunbar there is a noble park with a lodge
belonging to the Duke of Roxburgh where Oliver Cromwell had his
headquarters when Lesley at the head of a Scotch army took
possession of the mountains in the neighbourhood and hampered him in
such a manner that he would have been obliged to embark and get away by
sea had not the fanaticism of the enemy forfeited the advantage which
they had obtained by their generals conductTheir ministers by
exhortation prayer assurance and prophecy instigated them to go
down and slay the Philistines in Gilgal and they quitted their ground
accordingly notwithstanding all that Lesley could do to restrain
the madness of their enthusiasmWhen Oliver saw them in motion he
exclaimed Praised be the Lord he hath delivered them into the hands
of his servant and ordered his troops to sing a psalm of thanksgiving
while they advanced in order to the plain where the Scots were routed
with great slaughter

In the neighbourhood of Haddington there is a gentlemans house in
the building of which and the improvements about it he is said to have
expended forty thousand pounds but I cannot say I was much pleased
with either the architecture or the situation though it has in front
a pastoral stream the banks of which are laid out in a very agreeable
manner I intended to pay my respects to Lord Elibank whom I had
the honour to know at London many years ago He lives in this part of
Lothian but was gone to the North on a visitYou have often heard
me mention this nobleman whom I have long revered for his humanity and
universal intelligence over and above the entertainment arising
from originality of his characterAt Musselburgh however I had the
goodfortune to drink tea with my old friend Mr Cardonel and at his
house I met with Dr C the parson of the parish whose humour and
conversation inflamed me with a desire of being better acquainted with
his personI am not at all surprised that these Scots make their way in
every quarter of the globe

This place is but four miles from Edinburgh towards which we proceeded
along the seashore upon a firm bottom of smooth sand which the tide
had left uncovered in its retreatEdinburgh from this avenue is not
seen to much advantageWe had only an imperfect view of the Castle
and upper parts of the town which varied incessantly according to the
inflexions of the road and exhibited the appearance of detached spires
and turrets belonging to some magnificent edifice in ruins The palace
of Holyrood house stands on the left as you enter the CanongateThis
is a street continued from hence to the gate called Nether Bow which is
now taken away so that there is no interruption for a long mile from
the bottom to the top of the hill on which the castle stands in a most
imperial situationConsidering its fine pavement its width and the
lofty houses on each side this would be undoubtedly one of the noblest
streets in Europe if an ugly mass of mean buildings called the
LuckenBooths had not thrust itself by what accident I know not into
the middle of the way like MiddleRow in Holborn The city stands upon
two hills and the bottom between them and with all its defects may
very well pass for the capital of a moderate kingdomIt is full of
people and continually resounds with the noise of coaches and other
carriages for luxury as well as commerce As far as I can perceive
here is no want of provisionsThe beef and mutton are as delicate
here as in Wales the sea affords plenty of good fish the bread is
remarkably fine and the water is excellent though Im afraid not
in sufficient quantity to answer all the purposes of cleanliness and
convenience articles in which it must be allowed our fellowsubjects
are a little defectiveThe water is brought in leaden pipes from a
mountain in the neighbourhood to a cistern on the Castlehill from
whence it is distributed to public conduits in different parts of the
city From these it is carried in barrels on the backs of male and
female porters up two three four five six seven and eight
pairs of stairs for the use of particular familiesEvery story is
a complete house occupied by a separate family and the stair being
common to them all is generally left in a very filthy condition a man
must tread with great circumspection to get safe housed with unpolluted
shoesNothing can form a stronger contrast than the difference
betwixt the outside and inside of the door for the goodwomen of this
metropolis are remarkably nice in the ornaments and propriety of their
apartments as if they were resolved to transfer the imputation from
the individual to the public You are no stranger to their method of
discharging all their impurities from their windows at a certain hour
of the night as the custom is in Spain Portugal and some parts of
France and ItalyA practice to which I can by no means be reconciled
for notwithstanding all the care that is taken by their scavengers to
remove this nuisance every morning by break of day enough still remains
to offend the eyes as well as other organs of those whom use has not
hardened against all delicacy of sensation

The inhabitants seem insensible to these impressions and are apt to
imagine the disgust that we avow is little better than affectation but
they ought to have some compassion for strangers who have not been used
to this kind of sufferance and consider whether it may not be worth
while to take some pains to vindicate themselves from the reproach that
on this account they bear among their neighbours As to the surprising
height of their houses it is absurd in many respects but in one
particular light I cannot view it without horror that is the dreadful
situation of all the families above in case the common staircase should
be rendered impassable by a fire in the lower storiesIn order to
prevent the shocking consequences that must attend such an accident it
would be a right measure to open doors of communication from one house
to another on every story by which the people might fly from such
a terrible visitation In all parts of the world we see the force of
habit prevailing over all the dictates of convenience and sagacity All
the people of business at Edinburgh and even the genteel company may
be seen standing in crowds every day from one to two in the afternoon
in the open street at a place where formerly stood a marketcross
which by the bye was a curious piece of Gothic architecture still to
be seen in lord Sommervilles garden in this neighbourhoodI say the
people stand in the open street from the force of custom rather than
move a few yards to an Exchange that stands empty on one side or to the
Parliamentclose on the other which is a noble square adorned with a
fine equestrian statue of king Charles IIThe company thus assembled
are entertained with a variety of tunes played upon a set of bells
fixed in a steeple hard byAs these bells are welltoned and the
musician who has a salary from the city for playing upon them with
keys is no bad performer the entertainment is really agreeable and
very striking to the ears of a stranger

The public inns of Edinburgh are still worse than those of London but
by means of a worthy gentleman to whom I was recommended we have
got decent lodgings in the house of a widow gentlewoman of the name of
Lockhart and here I shall stay until I have seen every thing that
is remarkable in and about this capital I now begin to feel the good
effects of exerciseI eat like a farmer sleep from midnight till
eight in the morning without interruption and enjoy a constant tide of
spirits equally distant from inanition and excess but whatever ebbs
or flows my constitution may undergo my heart will still declare that I
am

To Mrs MARY JONES at Brambletonhall

DEAR MARY

The squire has been so kind as to rap my bit of nonsense under the
kiver of his own sheetO Mary Jones Mary Jones I have had trials and
trembulation God help me I have been a vixen and a griffin these many
daysSattin has had power to temp me in the shape of van Ditton
the young squires wally de shamble but by Gods grease he did
not purvailI thoft as how there was no arm in going to a play at
Newcastle with my hair dressed in the Parish fashion and as for the
trifle of paint he said as how my complexion wanted touch and so I
let him put it on with a little Spanish owl but a mischievous mob of
colliers and such promiscous ribble rabble that could bare no smut
but their own attacked us in the street and called me hoar and painted
Issabel and splashed my close and spoiled me a complete set of blond
lace triple ruffles not a pin the worse for the wareThey cost me
seven good sillings to lady Griskins woman at London

When I axed Mr Clinker what they meant by calling me Issabel he put the
byebill into my hand and I read of van Issabel a painted harlot that
vas thrown out of a vindore and the dogs came and licked her blood
But I am no harlot and with Gods blessing no dog shall have my poor
blood to lick marry Heaven forbid amen As for Ditton after all his
courting and his compliment he stole away an Irishmans bride and
took a French leave of me and his master but I vally not his going a
farting but I have had hanger on his accountMistriss scoulded like
mad thof I have the comfit that all the family took my part and even
Mr Clinker pleaded for me on his bended knee thof God he knows he
had raisins enuff to complain but hes a good sole abounding with
Christian meekness and one day will meet with his reward

And now dear Mary we have got to Haddingborrough among the Scots who
are civil enuff for our money thof I dont speak their lingoBut they
should not go for to impose upon foreigners for the bills in their
houses say they have different easements to let and behold there is
nurro geaks in the whole kingdom nor any thing for poor sarvants but
a barrel with a pair of tongs thrown across and all the chairs in the
family are emptied into this here barrel once aday and at ten oclock
at night the whole cargo is flung out of a back windore that looks into
some street or lane and the maids calls gardy loo to the passengers
which signifies Lord have mercy upon you and this is done every night
in every house in Haddingborrough so you may guess Mary Jones what a
sweet savour comes from such a number of profuming pans but they say it
is wholesome and truly I believe it is for being in the vapours and
thinking of Issabel and Mr Clinker I was going into a fit of astericks
when this fiff saving your presence took me by the nose so powerfully
that I sneezed three times and found myself wonderfully refreshed and
this to be sure is the raisin why there are no fits in Haddingborrough

I was likewise made believe that there was nothing to be had but
oatmeal and seepsheads but if I hadnt been a fool I mought have
known there could be no heads without kerkassesThis very blessed day
I dined upon a delicate leg of Velsh mutton and cullyflower and as
for the oatmeal I leave that to the sarvants of the country which are
pore drudges many of them without shoes or stockingsMr Clinker tells
me here is a great call of the gospel but I wish I wish some of
our family be not fallen off from the rite wayO if I was given to
tailbaring I have my own secrets to discoverThere has been a deal
of huggling and flurtation betwixt mistress and an ould Scotch officer
called Kismycago He looks for all the orld like the scarecrow that our
gardener has set up to frite away the sparrows and what will come of
it the Lord knows but come what will it shall never be said that I
menchioned a syllabub of the matterRemember me kindly to Saul and the
kittenI hope they got the hornbuck and will put it to a good yuse
which is the constant prayer of

Dear Molly Your loving friend WIN JENKINS ADDINGBOROUGH July 18




To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR PHILLIPS

If I stay much longer at Edinburgh I shall be changed into a downright
CaledonianMy uncle observes that I have already acquired something of
the country accent The people here are so social and attentive in their
civilities to strangers that I am insensibly sucked into the channel of
their manners and customs although they are in fact much more different
from ours than you can imagineThat difference however which struck
me very much at my first arrival I now hardly perceive and my ear is
perfectly reconciled to the Scotch accent which I find even agreeable
in the mouth of a pretty womanIt is a sort of Doric dialect which
gives an idea of amiable simplicityYou cannot imagine how we have
been caressed and feasted in the good town of Edinburgh of which we are
become free denizens and guild brothers by the special favour of the
magistracy

I had a whimsical commission from Bath to a citizen of this metropolis
Quin understanding our intention to visit Edinburgh pulled out a
guinea and desired the favour I would drink it at a tavern with a
particular friend and bottlecompanion of his Mr R C a lawyer of
this cityI charged myself with the commission and taking the guinea
You see said I I have pocketed your bounty Yes replied Quin
laughing and a headake into the bargain if you drink fair I made
use of this introduction to Mr C who received me with open arms
and gave me the rendezvous according to the cartel He had provided a
company of jolly fellows among whom I found myself extremely happy
and did Mr C and Quin all the justice in my power but alas I was no
more than a tiro among a troop of veterans who had compassion upon my
youth and conveyed me home in the morning by what means I know notQuin
was mistaken however as to the headake the claret was too good to
treat me so roughly

While Mr Bramble holds conferences with the graver literati of the
place and our females are entertained at visits by the Scotch ladies
who are the best and kindest creatures upon earth I pass my time among
the bucks of Edinburgh who with a great share of spirit and vivacity
have a certain shrewdness and selfcommand that is not often found
among their neighbours in the highday of youth and exultationNot
a hint escapes a Scotchman that can be interpreted into offence by any
individual in the company and national reflections are never heardIn
this particular I must own we are both unjust and ungrateful to the
Scots for as far as I am able to judge they have a real esteem for
the natives of SouthBritain and never mention our country but with
expressions of regardNevertheless they are far from being servile
imitators of our modes and fashionable vices All their customs and
regulations of public and private oeconomy of business and diversion
are in their own stile This remarkably predominates in their looks
their dress and manner their music and even their cookery Our squire
declares that he knows not another people upon earth so strongly
marked with a national characterNow we are upon the article of
cookery I must own some of their dishes are savoury and even
delicate but I am not yet Scotchman enough to relish their singed
sheepshead and haggice which were provided at our request one day at
Mr Mitchelsons where we dinedThe first put me in mind of the history
of Congo in which I had read of negroes heads sold publickly in
the markets the last being a mess of minced lights livers suet
oatmeal onions and pepper inclosed in a sheeps stomach had a very
sudden effect upon mine and the delicate Mrs Tabby changed colour when
the cause of our disgust was instantaneously removed at the nod of our
entertainer The Scots in general are attached to this composition
with a sort of national fondness as well as to their oatmeal bread
which is presented at every table in thin triangular cakes baked upon
a plate of iron called a girdle and these many of the natives even
in the higher ranks of life prefer to wheatenbread which they have
here in perfectionYou know we used to vex poor Murray of Baliol
college by asking if there was really no fruit but turnips in
ScotlandSure enough I have seen turnips make their appearance not
as a desert but by way of hors doeuvres or whets as radishes are
served betwixt more substantial dishes in France and Italy but it must
be observed that the turnips of this country are as much superior in
sweetness delicacy and flavour to those in England as a muskmelon
is to the stock of a common cabbage They are small and conical of
a yellowish colour with a very thin skin and over and above their
agreeable taste are valuable for their antiscorbutic qualityAs to the
fruit now in season such as cherries gooseberries and currants there
is no want of them at Edinburgh and in the gardens of some gentlemen
who live in the neighbourhood there is now a very favourable appearance
of apricots peaches nectarines and even grapes nay I have seen
a very fine shew of pineapples within a few miles of this metropolis
Indeed we have no reason to be surprised at these particulars when we
consider how little difference there is in fact betwixt this climate
and that of London

All the remarkable places in the city and its avenues for ten miles
around we have visited much to our satisfaction In the Castle are
some royal apartments where the sovereign occasionally resided and
here are carefully preserved the regalia of the kingdom consisting of
a crown said to be of great value a sceptre and a sword of state
adorned with jewelsOf these symbols of sovereignty the people are
exceedingly jealousA report being spread during the sitting of the
unionparliament that they were removed to London such a tumult arose
that the lord commissioner would have been torn to pieces if he had not
produced them for the satisfaction of the populace

The palace of Holyroodhouse is an elegant piece of architecture but
sunk in an obscure and as I take it unwholesome bottom where
one would imagine it had been placed on purpose to be concealed The
apartments are lofty but unfurnished and as for the pictures of
the Scottish kings from Fergus I to king William they are paultry
daubings mostly by the same hand painted either from the imagination
or porters hired to sit for the purpose All the diversions of London
we enjoy at Edinburgh in a small compass Here is a well
conducted concert in which several gentlemen perform on different
instrumentsThe Scots are all musiciansEvery man you meet plays on
the flute the violin or violoncello and there is one nobleman whose
compositions are universally admiredOur company of actors is very
tolerable and a subscription is now on foot for building a new theatre
but their assemblies please me above all other public exhibitions

We have been at the hunters ball where I was really astonished to see
such a number of fine womenThe English who have never crossed the
Tweed imagine erroneously that the Scotch ladies are not remarkable
for personal attractions but I can declare with a safe conscience I
never saw so many handsome females together as were assembled on this
occasion At the Leith races the best company comes hither from the
remoter provinces so that I suppose we had all the beauty of the
kingdom concentrated as it were into one focus which was indeed so
vehement that my heart could hardly resist its power Between friends
it has sustained some damage from the bright eyes of the charming miss
Renton whom I had the honour to dance with at the ballThe countess
of Melville attracted all eyes and the admiration of all presentShe
was accompanied by the agreeable miss Grieve who made many conquests
nor did my sister Liddy pass unnoticed in the assemblyShe is become
a toast at Edinburgh by the name of the Fair Cambrian and has already
been the occasion of much wineshed but the poor girl met with an
accident at the ball which has given us great disturbance

A young gentleman the express image of that rascal Wilson went up
to ask her to dance a minuet and his sudden appearance shocked her so
much that she fainted awayI call Wilson a rascal because if he had
been really a gentleman with honourable intentions he would have
ere now appeared in his own characterI must own my blood boils
with indignation when I think of that fellows presumption and Heaven
confound me if I dontBut I wont be so womanish as to railTime
will perhaps furnish occasionThank God the cause of Liddys
disorder remains a secret The lady directress of the ball thinking she
was overcome by the heat of the place had her conveyed to another room
where she soon recovered so well as to return and join in the country
dances in which the Scotch lasses acquit themselves with such spirit
and agility as put their partners to the height of their mettle I
believe our aunt Mrs Tabitha had entertained hopes of being able to
do some execution among the cavaliers at this assembly She had been
several days in consultation with milliners and mantuamakers preparing
for the occasion at which she made her appearance in a full suit of
damask so thick and heavy that the sight of it alone at this season
of the year was sufficient to draw drops of sweat from any man
of ordinary imaginationShe danced one minuet with our friend Mr
Mitchelson who favoured her so far in the spirit of hospitality and
politeness and she was called out a second time by the young laird of
Ballymawhawple who coming in by accident could not readily find any
other partner but as the first was a married man and the second payed
no particular homage to her charms which were also overlooked by the
rest of the company she became dissatisfied and censoriousAt supper
she observed that the Scotch gentlemen made a very good figure when
they were a little improved by travelling and therefore it was pity
they did not all take the benefit of going abroad She said the women
were awkward masculine creatures that in dancing they lifted their
legs like so many colts that they had no idea of graceful motion and
put on their clothes in a frightful manner but if the truth must
be told Tabby herself was the most ridiculous figure and the worst
dressed of the whole assembly The neglect of the male sex rendered
her malcontent and peevish she now found fault with every thing at
Edinburgh and teized her brother to leave the place when she was
suddenly reconciled to it on a religious considerationThere is a sect
of fanaticks who have separated themselves from the established kirk
under the name of SecedersThey acknowledge no earthly head of the
church reject laypatronage and maintain the methodist doctrines of
the new birth the new light the efficacy of grace the insufficiency
of works and the operations of the spirit Mrs Tabitha attended by
Humphry Clinker was introduced to one of their conventicles where they
both received much edification and she has had the good fortune to
come acquainted with a pious Christian called Mr Moffat who is very
powerful in prayer and often assists her in private exercises of
devotion

I never saw such a concourse of genteel company at any races in England
as appeared on the course of LeithHard by in the fields called the
Links the citizens of Edinburgh divert themselves at a game called
golf in which they use a curious kind of bats tipt with horn and
small elastic balls of leather stuffed with feathers rather less than
tennis balls but of a much harder consistenceThis they strike with
such force and dexterity from one hole to another that they will fly
to an incredible distance Of this diversion the Scots are so fond that
when the weather will permit you may see a multitude of all ranks
from the senator of justice to the lowest tradesman mingled together in
their shirts and following the balls with the utmost eagerness Among
others I was shewn one particular set of golfers the youngest of
whom was turned of fourscoreThey were all gentlemen of independent
fortunes who had amused themselves with this pastime for the best part
of a century without having ever felt the least alarm from sickness or
disgust and they never went to bed without having each the best
part of a gallon of claret in his belly Such uninterrupted exercise
cooperating with the keen air from the sea must without all doubt
keep the appetite always on edge and steel the constitution against all
the common attacks of distemper

The Leith races gave occasion to another entertainment of a very
singular natureThere is at Edinburgh a society or corporation of
errandboys called cawdies who ply in the streets at night with paper
lanthorns and are very serviceable in carrying messagesThese fellows
though shabby in their appearance and rudely familiar in their address
are wonderfully acute and so noted for fidelity that there is no
instance of a cawdys having betrayed his trustSuch is their
intelligence that they know not only every individual of the place
but also every stranger by that time he has been four and twenty hours
in Edinburgh and no transaction even the most private can escape
their notice They are particularly famous for their dexterity in
executing one of the functions of Mercury though for my own part I
never employed them in this department of businessHad I occasion
for any service of this nature my own man Archy MAlpine is as well
qualified as eer a cawdie in Edinburgh and I am much mistaken if he
has not been heretofore of their fraternity Be that as it may they
resolved to give a dinner and a ball at Leith to which they formally
invited all the young noblemen and gentlemen that were at the races and
this invitation was reinforced by an assurance that all the celebrated
ladies of pleasure would grace the entertainment with their companyI
received a card on this occasion and went thither with half a dozen of
my acquaintanceIn a large hall the cloth was laid on a long range of
tables joined together and here the company seated themselves to
the number of about fourscore lords and lairds and other gentlemen
courtezans and cawdies mingled together as the slaves and their masters
were in the time of the Saturnalia in ancient RomeThe toast master
who sat at the upper end was one Cawdie Fraser a veteran pimp
distinguished for his humour and sagacity well known and much respected
in his profession by all the guests male and female that were here
assembledHe had bespoke the dinner and the wine he had taken care
that all his brethren should appear in decent apparel and clean
linen and he himself wore a periwig with three tails in honour of the
festivalI assure you the banquet was both elegant and plentiful
and seasoned with a thousand sallies that promoted a general spirit
of mirth and good humourAfter the desert Mr Fraser proposed the
following toasts which I dont pretend to explain The best in
ChristendomGibbs contractThe beggars benisonKing and
kirkGreat Britain and Ireland Then filling a bumper and turning
to me Mester Malford said he may a unkindness cease betwixt John
Bull and his sister MoggyThe next person he singled out was a
nobleman who had been long abroadMa lord cried Fraser here is a
bumper to a those noblemen who have virtue enough to spend their rents
in their ain countrayHe afterwards addressed himself to a member of
parliament in these wordsMeesterIm sure yell ha nae objection
to my drinking disgrace and dule to ilka Scot that sells his
conscience and his voteHe discharged a third sarcasm at a person
very gaily dressed who had risen from small beginnings and made a
considerable fortune at playFilling his glass and calling him by
name Lang life said he to the wylie loon that gangs afield with a
toom poke at his lunzie and comes hame with a sackful of sillerAll
these toasts being received with loud bursts of applause Mr Fraser
called for pint glasses and filled his own to the brim then standing
up and all his brethren following his example Ma lords and gentlemen
cried he here is a cup of thanks for the great and undeserved honour
you have done your poor errandboys this daySo saying he and they
drank off their glasses in a trice and quitting their seats took their
station each behind one of the other guests exclaiming Noo were your
honours cawdies again

The nobleman who had bore the first brunt of Mr Frasers satire
objected to his abdication He said as the company was assembled by
invitation from the cawdies he expected they were to be entertained at
their expense By no means my lord cried Fraser I wad na he guilty
of sic presumption for the wide warldI never affronted a gentleman
since I was born and sure at this age I wonnot offer an indignity to
sic an honourable convention Well said his Lordship as you have
expended some wit you have a right to save your money You have given
me good counsel and I take it in good part As you have voluntarily
quitted your seat I will take your place with the leave of the good
company and think myself happy to be hailed Father of the Feast He
was forthwith elected into the chair and complimented in a bumper in
his new character

The claret continued to circulate without interruption till the glasses
seemed to dance upon the table and this perhaps was a hint to the
ladies to call for musicAt eight in the evening the ball began in
another apartment at midnight we went to supper but it was broad day
before I found the way to my lodgings and no doubt his Lordship had a
swinging bill to discharge

In short I have lived so riotously for some weeks that my uncle
begins to be alarmed on the score of my constitution and very seriously
observes that all his own infirmities are owing to such excesses
indulged in his youthMrs Tabitha says it would be more to the
advantage of my soul as well as body if instead of frequenting these
scenes of debauchery I would accompany Mr Moffat and her to hear a
sermon of the reverend Mr MCorkindaleClinker often exhorts me with
a groan to take care of my precious health and even Archy MAlpine
when he happens to be overtaken which is oftener the case than I could
wish reads me a long lecture upon temperance and sobriety and is
so very wise and sententious that if I could provide him with
a professors chair I would willingly give up the benefit of his
amonitions and service together for I was tutorsick at alma mater

I am not however so much engrossed by the gaieties of Edinburgh but
that I find time to make parties in the family way We have not only
seen all the villas and villages within ten miles of the capital but
we have also crossed the Firth which is an arm of the sea seven miles
broad that divides Lothian from the shire or as the Scots call it
the kingdom of Fife There is a number of large open seaboats that ply
on this passage from Leith to Kinghorn which is a borough on the
other side In one of these our whole family embarked three days ago
excepting my sister who being exceedingly fearful of the water was
left to the care of Mrs Mitchelson We had an easy and quick passage
into Fife where we visited a number of poor towns on the seaside
including St Andrews which is the skeleton of a venerable city but we
were much better pleased with some noble and elegant seats and castles
of which there is a great number in that part of Scotland Yesterday
we took boat again on our return to Leith with fair wind and agreeable
weather but we had not advanced halfway when the sky was suddenly
overcast and the wind changing blew directly in our teeth so that we
were obliged to turn or tack the rest of the way In a word the gale
increased to a storm of wind and rain attended with such a fog that
we could not see the town of Leith to which we were bound nor even the
castle of Edinburgh notwithstanding its high situation It is not to be
doubted but that we were all alarmed on this occasion And at the same
time most of the passengers were seized with a nausea that produced
violent retchings My aunt desired her brother to order the boatmen to
put back to Kinghorn and this expedient he actually proposed but they
assured him there was no danger Mrs Tabitha finding them obstinate
began to scold and insisted upon my uncles exerting his authority as
a justice of the peace Sick and peevish as he was he could not help
laughing at this wise proposal telling her that his commission did not
extend so far and if it did he should let the people take their own
way for he thought it would be great presumption in him to direct them
in the exercise of their own profession Mrs Winifred Jenkins made a
general clearance with the assistance of Mr Humphry Clinker who joined
her both in prayer and ejaculationAs he took it for granted that we
should not be long in this world he offered some spiritual consolation
to Mrs Tabitha who rejected it with great disgust bidding him keep his
sermons for those who had leisure to hear such nonsenseMy uncle sat
collected in himself without speaking my man Archy had recourse to a
brandybottle with which he made so free that I imagined he had sworn
to die of drinking any thing rather than seawater but the brandy had
no more effect upon him in the way of intoxication than if it had been
seawater in good earnestAs for myself I was too much engrossed by
the sickness at my stomach to think of any thing else Meanwhile the
sea swelled mountains high the boat pitched with such violence as if
it had been going to pieces the cordage rattled the wind roared the
lightning flashed the thunder bellowed and the rain descended in
a delugeEvery time the vessel was put about we shipd a sea that
drenched us all to the skinWhen by dint of turning we thought to
have cleared the pier head we were driven to leeward and then the
boatmen themselves began to fear that the tide would fail before we
should fetch up our leeway the next trip however brought us into
smooth water and we were safely landed on the quay about one oclock
in the afternoonTo be sure cried Tabby when she found herself
on terra firma we must all have perished if we had not been the
particular care of Providence Yes replied my uncle but I am much
of the honest highlanders mindafter he had made such a passage
as this his friend told him he was much indebted to
ProvidenceCertainly said Donald but by my saul mon Ise neer
trouble Providence again so long as the brig of Stirling standsYou
must know the brig or bridge of Stirling stands above twenty miles
up the river Forth of which this is the outletI dont find that our
squire has suffered in his health from this adventure but poor Liddy
is in a peaking wayIm afraid this unfortunate girl is uneasy in her
mind and this apprehension distracts me for she is really an amiable
creature

We shall set out tomorrow or next day for Stirling and Glasgow and we
propose to penetrate a little way into the Highlands before we turn our
course to the southwardIn the mean time commend me to all our friends
round Carfax and believe me to be ever yours

EDINBURGH Aug 8 J MELFORD




To Dr LEWIS

I should be very ungrateful dear Lewis if I did not find myself
disposed to think and speak favourably of this people among whom I have
met with more kindness hospitality and rational entertainment in a
few weeks than ever I received in any other country during the whole
course of my lifePerhaps the gratitude excited by these benefits may
interfere with the impartiality of my remarks for a man is as apt to
be prepossessed by particular favours as to be prejudiced by private
motives of disgust If I am partial there is at least some merit
in my conversion from illiberal prejudices which had grown up with my
constitution

The first impressions which an Englishman receives in this country will
not contribute to the removal of his prejudices because he refers every
thing he sees to a comparison with the same articles in his own country
and this comparison is unfavourable to Scotland in all its exteriors
such as the face of the country in respect to cultivation the
appearance of the bulk of the people and the language of conversation
in generalI am not so far convinced by Mr Lismahagos arguments but
that I think the Scots would do well for their own sakes to adopt
the English idioms and pronunciation those of them especially who are
resolved to push their fortunes in SouthBritainI know by experience
how easily an Englishman is influenced by the ear and how apt he is
to laugh when he hears his own language spoken with a foreign or
provincial accentI have known a member of the house of commons speak
with great energy and precision without being able to engage attention
because his observations were made in the Scotch dialect which no
offence to lieutenant Lismahago certainly gives a clownish air even
to sentiments of the greatest dignity and decorumI have declared my
opinion on this head to some of the most sensible men of this country
observing at the same time that if they would employ a few natives of
England to teach the pronunciation of our vernacular tongue in twenty
years there would be no difference in point of dialect between the
youth of Edinburgh and of London

The civil regulations of this kingdom and metropolis are taken from
very different models from those of England except in a few particular
establishments the necessary consequences of the unionTheir college
of justice is a bench of great dignity filled with judges of character
and abilityI have heard some causes tried before this venerable
tribunal and was very much pleased with the pleadings of their
advocates who are by no means deficient either in argument or
elocution The Scottish legislation is founded in a great measure on
the civil law consequently their proceedings vary from those of the
English tribunals but I think they have the advantage of us in their
method of examining witnesses apart and in the constitution of their
jury by which they certainly avoid the evil which I mentioned in my
last from Lismahagos observation

The university of Edinburgh is supplied with excellent professors in all
the sciences and the medical school in particular is famous all over
EuropeThe students of this art have the best opportunity of learning
it to perfection in all its branches as there are different courses
for the theory of medicine and the practice of medicine for anatomy
chemistry botany and the materia medica over and above those of
mathematics and experimental philosophy and all these are given by men
of distinguished talents What renders this part of education still more
complete is the advantage of attending the infirmary which is the best
instituted charitable foundation that I ever knew Now we are talking
of charities here are several hospitals exceedingly well endowed and
maintained under admirable regulations and these are not only useful
but ornamental to the city Among these I shall only mention the
general workhouse in which all the poor not otherwise provided for
are employed according to their different abilities with such judgment
and effect that they nearly maintain themselves by their labour
and there is not a beggar to be seen within the precincts of this
metropolis It was Glasgow that set the example of this establishment
about thirty years agoEven the kirk of Scotland so long reproached
with fanaticism and canting abounds at present with ministers
celebrated for their learning and respectable for their moderationI
have heard their sermons with equal astonishment and pleasureThe good
people of Edinburgh no longer think dirt and cobwebs essential to the
house of GodSome of their churches have admitted such ornaments
as would have excited sedition even in England a little more than a
century ago and Psalmody is here practised and taught by a professor
from the cathedral of DurhamI should not be surprised in a few
years to hear it accompanied with an organ

Edinburgh is a hotbed of geniusI have had the good fortune to be
made acquainted with many authors of the first distinction such as the
two Humes Robertson Smith Wallace Blair Ferguson Wilkie c and I
have found them all as agreeable in conversation as they are instructive
and entertaining in their writings These acquaintances I owe to the
friendship of Dr Carlyle who wants nothing but inclination to figure
with the rest upon paper The magistracy of Edinburgh is changed every
year by election and seems to be very well adapted both for state and
authorityThe lord provost is equal in dignity to the lord mayor
of London and the four bailies are equivalent to the rank of
aldermenThere is a dean of guild who takes cognizance of mercantile
affairs a treasurer a townclerk and the council is composed
of deacons one of whom is returned every year in rotation as
representative of every company of artificers or handicraftsmen Though
this city from the nature of its situation can never be made either
very convenient or very cleanly it has nevertheless an air of
magnificence that commands respectThe castle is an instance of the
sublime in scite and architectureIts fortifications are kept in good
order and there is always in it a garrison of regular soldiers which
is relieved every year but it is incapable of sustaining a siege
carried on according to the modern operations of warThe castle hill
which extends from the outward gate to the upper end of the high street
is used as a public walk for the citizens and commands a prospect
equally extensive and delightful over the county of Fife on the other
side of the Frith and all along the seacoast which is covered with a
succession of towns that would seem to indicate a considerable share of
commerce but if the truth must be told these towns have been falling
to decay ever since the union by which the Scots were in a
great measure deprived of their trade with FranceThe palace of
Holyroodhouse is a jewel in architecture thrust into a hollow where
it cannot be seen a situation which was certainly not chosen by the
ingenious architect who must have been confined to the site of the old
palace which was a convent Edinburgh is considerably extended on the
south side where there are divers little elegant squares built in the
English manner and the citizens have planned some improvements on the
north which when put in execution will add greatly to the beauty and
convenience of this capital

The seaport is Leith a flourishing town about a mile from the city
in the harbour of which I have seen above one hundred ships lying all
together You must know I had the curiosity to cross the Frith in a
passage boat and stayed two days in Fife which is remarkably fruitful
in corn and exhibits a surprising number of fine seats elegantly
built and magnificently furnished There is an incredible number of
noble houses in every part of Scotland that I have seenDalkeith
Pinkie Yester and lord Hoptons Hopetouns all of them within four
or five miles of Edinburgh are princely palaces in every one of which
a sovereign might reside at his caseI suppose the Scots affect these
monuments of grandeurIf I may be allowed to mingle censure with my
remarks upon a people I revere I must observe that their weak side
seems to be vanityI am afraid that even their hospitality is not
quite free of ostentation I think I have discovered among them uncommon
pains taken to display their fine linen of which indeed they have
great plenty their furniture plate housekeeping and variety of
wines in which article it must be owned they are profuse if not
prodigalA burgher of Edinburgh not content to vie with a citizen of
London who has ten times his fortune must excel him in the expence as
well as elegance of his entertainments

Though the villas of the Scotch nobility and gentry have generally
an air of grandeur and state I think their gardens and parks are not
comparable to those of England a circumstance the more remarkable as I
was told by the ingenious Mr Phillip Miller of Chelsea that almost all
the gardeners of SouthBritain were natives of Scotland The verdure of
this country is not equal to that of EnglandThe pleasuregrounds are
in my opinion not so well laid out according to the genius loci nor
are the lawns and walks and hedges kept in such delicate orderThe
trees are planted in prudish rows which have not such an agreeable
natural effect as when they are thrown into irregular groupes with
intervening glades and firs which they generally raise around their
houses look dull and funereal in the summer seasonI must confess
indeed that they yield serviceable timber and good shelter against the
northern blasts that they grow and thrive in the most barren soil and
continually perspire a fine balsam of turpentine which must render the
air very salutary and sanative to lungs of a tender texture

Tabby and I have been both frightened in our return by sea from the
coast of FifeShe was afraid of drowning and I of catching cold in
consequence of being drenched with seawater but my fears as well as
hers have been happily disappointed She is now in perfect health I
wish I could say the same of LiddySomething uncommon is the matter
with that poor girl her colour fades her appetite fails and her
spirits flagShe is become moping and melancholy and is often found
in tearsHer brother suspects internal uneasiness on account of Wilson
and denounces vengeance against that adventurerShe was it seems
strongly affected at the ball by the sudden appearance of one Mr Gordon
who strongly resembles the said Wilson but I am rather suspicious that
she caught cold by being overheated with dancingI have consulted Dr
Gregory an eminent physician of an amiable character who advises the
highland air and the use of goatmilk whey which surely cannot have
a bad effect upon a patient who was born and bred among the mountains of
WalesThe doctors opinion is the more agreeable as we shall find those
remedies in the very place which I proposed as the utmost extent of our
expeditionI mean the borders of Argyle

Mr Smollett one of the judges of the commissary court which is now
sitting has very kindly insisted upon our lodging at his countryhouse
on the banks of LoughLomond about fourteen miles beyond Glasgow For
this last city we shall set out in two days and take Stirling in our
way well provided with recommendations from our friends at Edinburgh
whom I protest I shall leave with much regret I am so far from
thinking it any hardship to live in this country that if I was obliged
to lead a town life Edinburgh would certainly be the headquarters of

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR KNIGHT

I am now little short of the Ultima Thule if this appellation properly
belongs to the Orkneys or Hebrides These last are now lying before me
to the amount of some hundreds scattered up and down the Deucalidonian
sea affording the most picturesque and romantic prospect I ever
beheldI write this letter in a gentlemans house near the town of
Inverary which may be deemed the capital of the West Highlands famous
for nothing so much as for the stately castle begun and actually
covered in by the late duke of Argyle at a prodigious expenceWhether
it will ever be completely finished is a question

But to take things in orderWe left Edinburgh ten days ago and the
further North we proceed we find Mrs Tabitha the less manageable so
that her inclinations are not of the nature of the loadstone they point
not towards the pole What made her leave Edinburgh with reluctance at
last if we may believe her own assertions was a dispute which she left
unfinished with Mr Moffat touching the eternity of hell torments That
gentleman as he advanced in years began to be sceptical on this head
till at length he declared open war against the common acceptation of
the word eternal He is now persuaded that eternal signifies no more
than an indefinite number of years and that the most enormous sinner
may be quit for nine millions nine hundred thousand nine hundred and
ninetynine years of hellfire which term or period as he very well
observes forms but an inconsiderable drop as it were in the ocean of
eternityFor this mitigation he contends as a system agreeable to the
ideas of goodness and mercy which we annex to the supreme BeingOur
aunt seemed willing to adopt this doctrine in favour of the wicked but
he hinted that no person whatever was so righteous as to be exempted
entirely from punishment in a future state and that the most pious
Christian upon earth might think himself very happy to get off for
a fast of seven or eight thousand years in the midst of fire and
brimstone Mrs Tabitha revolted at this dogma which filled her at once
with horror and indignationShe had recourse to the opinion of Humphry
Clinker who roundly declared it was the popish doctrine of purgatory
and quoted scripture in defence of the fire everlasting prepared for
the devil and his angelsThe reverend master Mackcorkendal and all the
theologists and saints of that persuasion were consulted and some of
them had doubts about the matter which doubts and scruples had begun to
infect our aunt when we took our departure from Edinburgh

We passed through Linlithgow where there was an elegant royal palace
which is now gone to decay as well as the town itselfThis too is
pretty much the case with Stirling though it still boasts of a fine
old castle in which the kings of Scotland were wont to reside in their
minorityBut Glasgow is the pride of Scotland and indeed it might
very well pass for an elegant and flourishing city in any part of
Christendom There we had the good fortune to be received into the house
of Mr Moore an eminent surgeon to whom we were recommended by one of
our friends at Edinburgh and truly he could not have done us more
essential serviceMr Moore is a merry facetious companion sensible and
shrewd with a considerable fund of humour and his wife an agreeable
woman well bred kind and obliging Kindness which I take to be
the essence of goodnature and humanity is the distinguishing
characteristic of the Scotch ladies in their own countryOur landlord
shewed us every thing and introduced us to all the world at Glasgow
where through his recommendation we were complimented with the freedom
of the town Considering the trade and opulence of this place it cannot
but abound with gaiety and diversions Here is a great number of young
fellows that rival the youth of the capital in spirit and expence and
I was soon convinced that all the female beauties of Scotland were
not assembled at the hunters ball in EdinburghThe town of Glasgow
flourishes in learning as well as in commerceHere is an university
with professors in all the different branches of science liberally
endowed and judiciously chosenIt was vacation time when I passed
so that I could not entirely satisfy my curiosity but their mode of
education is certainly preferable to ours in some respects The students
are not left to the private instruction of tutors but taught in public
schools or classes each science by its particular professor or regent

My uncle is in raptures with GlasgowHe not only visited all the
manufactures of the place but made excursions all round to Hamilton
Paisley Renfrew and every other place within a dozen miles where
there was any thing remarkable to be seen in art or nature I believe
the exercise occasioned by those jaunts was of service to my sister
Liddy whose appetite and spirits begin to reviveMrs Tabitha displayed
her attractions as usual and actually believed she had entangled one
Mr Maclellan a rich inklemanufacturer in her snares but when matters
came to an explanation it appeared that his attachment was altogether
spiritual founded upon an intercourse of devotion at the meeting of
Mr John Wesley who in the course of his evangelical mission had come
hither in personAt length we set out for the banks of LoughLomond
passing through the little borough of Dumbarton or as my uncle will
have it Dunbritton where there is a castle more curious than any
thing of the kind I had ever seen It is honoured with a particular
description by the elegant Buchanan as an arx inexpugnabilis
and indeed it must have been impregnable by the antient manner of
besieging It is a rock of considerable extent rising with a double
top in an angle formed by the confluence of two rivers the Clyde and
the Leven perpendicular and inaccessible on all sides except in one
place where the entrance is fortified and there is no rising ground
in the neighbourhood from whence it could be damaged by any kind of
battery

From Dumbarton the West Highlands appear in the form of huge dusky
mountains piled one over another but this prospect is not at all
surprising to a native of GlamorganWe have fixed our headquarters
at Cameron a very neat countryhouse belonging to commissary Smollet
where we found every sort of accommodation we could desireIt is
situated like a Druids temple in a grove of oak close by the side
of LoughLomond which is a surprising body of pure transparent water
unfathomably deep in many places six or seven miles broad four and
twenty miles in length displaying above twenty green islands covered
with wood some of them cultivated for corn and many of them stocked
with red deerThey belong to different gentlemen whose seats are
scattered along the banks of the lake which are agreeably romantic
beyond all conception My uncle and I have left the women at Cameron as
Mrs Tabitha would by no means trust herself again upon the water and
to come hither it was necessary to cross a small inlet of the sea in an
open ferryboatThis country appears more and more wild and savage the
further we advance and the People are as different from the Lowland
Scots in their looks garb and language as the mountaineers of
Brecknock are from the inhabitants of Herefordshire

When the Lowlanders want to drink a chearuppingcup they go to the
public house called the Changehouse and call for a chopine of
twopenny which is a thin yeasty beverage made of malt not quite so
strong as the tablebeer of EnglandThis is brought in a pewter stoop
shaped like a skittle from whence it is emptied into a quaff that is
a curious cup made of different pieces of wood such as box and ebony
cut into little staves joined alternately and secured with delicate
hoops having two cars or handlesIt holds about a gill is sometimes
tipt round the mouth with silver and has a plate of the same metal at
bottom with the landlords cypher engravedThe Highlanders on the
contrary despise this liquor and regale themselves with whisky a malt
spirit as strong as geneva which they swallow in great quantities
without any signs of inebriation They are used to it from the cradle
and find it an excellent preservative against the winter cold which
must be extreme on these mountainsI am told that it is given with
great success to infants as a cordial in the confluent smallpox when
the eruption seems to flag and the symptoms grow unfavourableThe
Highlanders are used to eat much more animal food than falls to the
share of their neighbours in the LowcountryThey delight in hunting
have plenty of deer and other game with a great number of sheep
goats and blackcattle running wild which they scruple not to kill as
vension without being much at pains to ascertain the property

Inverary is but a poor town though it stands immediately under the
protection of the duke of Argyle who is a mighty prince in this part of
Scotland The peasants live in wretched cabins and seem very poor but
the gentlemen are tolerably well lodged and so loving to strangers
that a man runs some risque of his life from their hospitalityIt must
be observed that the poor Highlanders are now seen to disadvantage They
have been not only disarmed by act of parliament but also deprived of
their ancient garb which was both graceful and convenient and what
is a greater hardship still they are compelled to wear breeches a
restraint which they cannot bear with any degree of patience indeed
the majority wear them not in the proper place but on poles or long
staves over their shouldersThey are even debarred the use of their
striped stuff called Tartane which was their own manufacture prized
by them above all the velvets brocades and tissues of Europe and Asia
They now lounge along in loose great coats of coarse russet equally
mean and cumbersome and betray manifest marks of dejectionCertain it
is the government could not have taken a more effectual method to break
their national spirit

We have had princely sport in hunting the stag on these mountains These
are the lonely hills of Morven where Fingal and his heroes enjoyed the
same pastime I feel an enthusiastic pleasure when I survey the brown
heath that Ossian wont to tread and hear the wind whistle through
the bending grassWhen I enter our landlords hall I look for the
suspended harp of that divine bard and listen in hopes of hearing the
aerial sound of his respected spiritThe poems of Ossian are in every
mouthA famous antiquarian of this country the laird of Macfarlane at
whose house we dined a few days ago can repeat them all in the original
Gallick which has a great affinity to the Welch not only in the
general sound but also in a great number of radical words and I make
no doubt that they are both sprung from the same origin I was not a
little surprised when asking a Highlander one day if he knew where we
should find any game he replied hu niel Sassenagh which signifies
no English the very same answer I should have received from a Welchman
and almost in the same words The Highlanders have no other name for
the people of the Lowcountry but Sassenagh or Saxons a strong
presumption that the Lowland Scots and the English are derived from the
same stockThe peasants of these hills strongly resemble those of Wales
in their looks their manners and habitations every thing I see and
hear and feel seems WelchThe mountains vales and streams the
air and climate the beef mutton and game are all WelchIt must be
owned however that this people are better Provided than we in some
articlesThey have plenty of red deer and roebuck which are fat
and delicious at this season of the year Their sea teems with amazing
quantities of the finest fish in the world and they find means to
procure very good claret at a very small expence

Our landlord is a man of consequence in this part of the country a
cadet from the family of Argyle and hereditary captain of one of his
castlesHis name in plain English is Dougal Campbell but as there is
a great number of the same appellation they are distinguished like
the Welch by patronimics and as I have known an antient Briton called
Madoc apMorgan apJenkin apJones our Highland chief designs himself
Doul Macamish macoul ichian signifying Dougal the son of James
the son of Dougal the son of John He has travelled in the course
of his education and is disposed to make certain alterations in his
domestic oeconomy but he finds it impossible to abolish the ancient
customs of the family some of which are ludicrous enoughHis piper for
example who is an hereditary officer of the household will not part
with the least particle of his privileges He has a right to wear the
kilt or ancient Highland dress with the purse pistol and durka
broad yellow ribbon fixed to the chanterpipe is thrown over his
shoulder and trails along the ground while he performs the function of
his minstrelsy and this I suppose is analogous to the pennon or flag
which was formerly carried before every knight in battleHe plays
before the laird every Sunday in his way to the kirk which he circles
three times performing the family march which implies defiance to all
the enemies of the clan and every morning he plays a full hour by the
clock in the great hall marching backwards and forwards all the time
with a solemn pace attended by the lairds kinsmen who seem much
delighted with the musicIn this exercise he indulges them with a
variety of pibrochs or airs suited to the different passions which he
would either excite or assuage

Mr Campbell himself who performs very well on the violin has an
invincible antipathy to the sound of the Highland bagpipe which
sings in the nose with a most alarming twang and indeed is quite
intolerable to ears of common sensibility when aggravated by the echo
of a vaulted hallHe therefore begged the piper would have some
mercy upon him and dispense with this part of the morning serviceA
consultation of the clan being held on this occasion it was unanimously
agreed that the lairds request could not be granted without a
dangerous encroachment upon the customs of the familyThe piper
declared he could not give up for a moment the privilege he derived
from his ancestors nor would the lairds relations forego an
entertainment which they valued above all othersThere was no remedy
Mr Campbell being obliged to acquiesce is fain to stop his ears with
cotton to fortify his head with three or four nightcaps and every
morning retire into the penetralia of his habitation in order to avoid
this diurnal annoyance When the music ceases he produces himself at an
open window that looks into the courtyard which is by this time filled
with a crowd of his vassals and dependents who worship his first
appearance by uncovering their heads and bowing to the earth with
the most humble prostration As all these people have something to
communicate in the way of proposal complaint or petition they wait
patiently till the laird comes forth and following him in his walks
are favoured each with a short audience in his turn Two days ago he
dispatched above an hundred different sollicitors in walking with us to
the house of a neighbouring gentleman where we dined by invitation
Our landlords housekeeping is equally rough and hospitable and savours
much of the simplicity of ancient times the great hall paved with flat
stones is about fortyfive feet by twentytwo and serves not only for
a diningroom but also for a bedchamber to gentlemendependents and
hangerson of the family At night half a dozen occasional beds are
ranged on each side along the wall These are made of fresh heath
pulled up by the roots and disposed in such a manner as to make a very
agreeable couch where they lie without any other covering than the
plaidMy uncle and I were indulged with separate chambers and down beds
which we begged to exchange for a layer of heath and indeed I never
slept so much to my satisfaction It was not only soft and elastic but
the plant being in flower diffused an agreeable fragrance which is
wonderfully refreshing and restorative

Yesterday we were invited to the funeral of an old lady the grandmother
of a gentleman in this neighbourhood and found ourselves in the midst
of fifty people who were regaled with a sumptuous feast accompanied by
the music of a dozen pipers In short this meeting had all the air of
a grand festival and the guests did such honour to the entertainment
that many of them could not stand when we were reminded of the business
on which we had met The company forthwith taking horse rode in a very
irregular cavalcade to the place of interment a church at the distance
of two long miles from the castle On our arrival however we found
we had committed a small oversight in leaving the corpse behind so we
were obliged to wheel about and met the old gentlewoman half way being
carried upon poles by the nearest relations of her family and attended
by the coronach composed of a multitude of old hags who tore their
hair beat their breasts and howled most hideously At the grave the
orator or senachie pronounced the panegyric of the defunct every
period being confirmed by a yell of the coronach The body was committed
to the earth the pipers playing a pibroch all the time and all the
company standing uncovered The ceremony was closed with the discharge
of pistols then we returned to the castle resumed the bottle and
by midnight there was not a sober person in the family the females
excepted The squire and I were with some difficulty permitted to
retire with our landlord in the evening but our entertainer was a
little chagrined at our retreat and afterwards seemed to think it a
disparagement to his family that not above a hundred gallons of whisky
had been drunk upon such a solemn occasion This morning we got up by
four to hunt the roebuck and in half an hour found breakfast ready
served in the hall The hunters consisted of Sir George Colquhoun and
me as strangers my uncle not chusing to be of the party of the laird
in person the lairds brother the lairds brothers son the lairds
sisters son the lairds fathers brothers son and all their foster
brothers who are counted parcel of the family but we were attended by
an infinite number of Gaellys or ragged Highlanders without shoes or
stockings

The following articles formed our mornings repast one kit of boiled
eggs a second full of butter a third full of cream an entire cheese
made of goats milk a large earthen pot full of honey the best part
of a ham a cold venison pasty a bushel of oat meal made in thin cakes
and bannocks with a small wheaten loaf in the middle for the strangers
a large stone bottle full of whisky another of brandy and a kilderkin
of ale There was a ladle chained to the cream kit with curious wooden
bickers to be filled from this reservoir The spirits were drank out of
a silver quaff and the ale out of hems great justice was done to the
collation by the guest in general one of them in particular ate above
two dozen of hard eggs with a proportionable quantity of bread butter
and honey nor was one drop of liquor left upon the board Finally
a large roll of tobacco was presented by way of desert and every
individual took a comfortable quid to prevent the bad effects of the
morning air We had a fine chace over the mountains after a roebuck
which we killed and I got home time enough to drink tea with Mrs
Campbell and our squire Tomorrow we shall set out on our return for
Cameron We propose to cross the Frith of Clyde and take the towns of
Greenock and PortGlasgow in our way This circuit being finished we
shall turn our faces to the south and follow the sun with augmented
velocity in order to enjoy the rest of the autumn in England where
Boreas is not quite so biting as he begins already to be on the tops
of these northern hills But our progress from place to place shall
continue to be specified in these detached journals of

To Dr LEWIS

DEAR DICK

About a fortnight is now elapsed since we left the capital of Scotland
directing our course towards Stirling where we lay The castle of this
place is such another as that of Edinburgh and affords a surprising
prospect of the windings of the river Forth which are so extraordinary
that the distance from hence to Alloa by land is but forty miles and
by water it is twentyfour Alloa is a neat thriving town that depends
in a great measure on the commerce of Glasgow the merchants of which
send hither tobacco and other articles to be deposited in warehouses
for exportation from the Frith of Forth In our way hither we visited
a flourishing ironwork where instead of burning wood they use coal
which they have the art of clearing in such a manner as frees it from
the sulphur that would otherwise render the metal too brittle for
working Excellent coal is found in almost every part of Scotland

The soil of this district produces scarce any other grain but oats lid
barley perhaps because it is poorly cultivated and almost altogether
uninclosed The few inclosures they have consist of paultry walls of
loose stones gathered from the fields which indeed they cover as if
they had been scattered on purpose When I expressed my surprize that
the peasants did not disencumber their grounds of these stones a
gentleman well acquainted with the theory as well as practice of
farming assured me that the stones far from being prejudicial were
serviceable to the crop This philosopher had ordered a field of his own
to be cleared manured and sown with barley and the produce was more
scanty than before He caused the stones to be replaced and next year
the crop was as good as ever The stones were removed a second time
and the harvest failed they were again brought back and the ground
retrieved its fertility The same experiment has been tried in different
parts of Scotland with the same successAstonished at this information
I desired to know in what manner he accounted for this strange
phenomenon and he said there were three ways in which the stones
might be serviceable They might possibly restrain an excess in the
perspiration of the earth analogous to colliquative sweats by which
the human body is sometimes wasted and consumed They might act as so
many fences to protect the tender blade from the piercing winds of the
spring or by multiplying the reflexion of the sun they might increase
the warmth so as to mitigate the natural chilness of the soil
and climateBut surely this excessive perspiration might be more
effectually checked by different kinds of manure such as ashes lime
chalk or marl of which last it seems there are many pits in this
kingdom as for the warmth it would be much more equally obtained by
inclosures the cultivation would require less labour and the ploughs
harrows and horses would not suffer half the damage which they now
sustain

These northwestern parts are by no means fertile in corn The ground is
naturally barren and moorish The peasants are poorly lodged meagre
in their looks mean in their apparel and remarkably dirty This last
reproach they might easily wash off by means of those lakes rivers
and rivulets of pure water with which they are so liberally supplied by
nature Agriculture cannot be expected to flourish where the farms are
small the leases short and the husbandman begins upon a rack rent
without a sufficient stock to answer the purposes of improvement The
granaries of Scotland are the banks of the Tweed the counties of East
and MidLothian the Carse of Gowrie in Perthshire equal in fertility
to any part of England and some tracts in Aberdeenshire and Murray
where I am told the harvest is more early than in Northumberland
although they lie above two degrees farther north I have a strong
curiosity to visit many places beyond the Forth and the Tay such as
Perth Dundee Montrose and Aberdeen which are towns equally elegant
and thriving but the season is too far advanced to admit of this
addition to my original plan

I am so far happy as to have seen Glasgow which to the best of my
recollection and judgment is one of the prettiest towns in Europe and
without all doubt it is one of the most flourishing in Great Britain
In short it is a perfect beehive in point of industry It stands
partly on a gentle declivity but the greatest part of it is in a plain
watered by the river Clyde The streets are straight open airy and
well paved and the houses lofty and well built of hewn stone At the
upper end of the town there is a venerable cathedral that may be
compared with Yorkminster or Westminster and about the middle of the
descent from this to the Cross is the college a respectable pile
of building with all manner of accommodation for the professors and
students including an elegant library and a observatory well provided
with astronomical instruments The number of inhabitants is said to
amount to thirty thousand and marks of opulence and independency appear
in every quarter of this commercial city which however is not without
its inconveniences and defects The water of their public pumps is
generally hard and brackish an imperfection the loss excusable as
the river Clyde runs by their doors in the lower part of the town and
there are rivulets and springs above the cathedral sufficient to fill a
large reservoir with excellent water which might be thence distributed
to all the different parts of the city It is of more consequence to
consult the health of the inhabitants in this article than to employ so
much attention in beautifying their town with new streets squares and
churches Another defect not so easily remedied is the shallowness
of the river which will not float vessels of any burthen within ten or
twelve miles of the city so that the merchants are obliged to load and
unload their ships at Greenock and PortGlasgow situated about fourteen
miles nearer the mouth of the Frith where it is about two miles broad

The people of Glasgow have a noble spirit of enterpriseMr Moore a
surgeon to whom I was recommended from Edinburgh introduced me to all
the principal merchants of the place Here I became acquainted with
Mr Cochran who may be stiled one of the sages of this kingdom He was
first magistrate at the time of the last rebellion I sat as member
when he was examined in the house of commons upon which occasion Mr P
observed he had never heard such a sensible evidence given at that bar
I was also introduced to Dr John Gordon a patriot of a truly Roman
spirit who is the father of the linen manufacture in this place and
was the great promoter of the city workhouse infirmary and other works
of public utility Had he lived in ancient Rome he would have been
honoured with a statue at the public expence I moreover conversed with
one Mr Gssfd whom I take to be one of the greatest merchants in
Europe In the last war he is said to have had at one time five and
twenty ships with their cargoes his own property and to have traded
for above half a million sterling ayear The last war was a fortunate
period for the commerce of GlasgowThe merchants considering that
their ships bound for America launching out at once into the Atlantic
by the north of Ireland pursued a track very little frequented
by privateers resolved to insure one another and saved a very
considerable sum by this resolution as few or none of their ships were
takenYou must know I have a sort of national attachment to this part
of ScotlandThe great church dedicated to St Mongah the river Clyde
and other particulars that smack of our Welch language and customs
contribute to flatter me with the notion that these people are the
descendants of the Britons who once possessed this country Without
all question this was a Cumbrian kingdom its capital was Dumbarton a
corruption of Dunbritton which still exists as a royal borough at
the influx of the Clyde and Leven ten miles below Glasgow The same
neighbourhood gave birth to St Patrick the apostle of Ireland at a
place where there is still a church and village which retain his name
Hard by are some vestiges of the famous Roman wall built in the reign
of Antonine from the Clyde to the Forth and fortified with castles to
restrain the incursions of the Scots or Caledonians who inhabited
the WestHighlands In a line parallel to this wall the merchants of
Glasgow have determined to make a navigable canal betwixt the two Firths
which will be of incredible advantage to their commerce in transporting
merchandize from one side of the island to the other

From Glasgow we travelled along the Clyde which is a delightful stream
adorned on both sides with villas towns and villages Here is no want
of groves and meadows and cornfields interspersed but on this side
of Glasgow there is little other grain than oats and barley the first
are much better the last much worse than those of the same species in
England I wonder there is so little rye which is a grain that will
thrive in almost any soil and it is still more surprising that the
cultivation of potatoes should be so much neglected in the Highlands
where the poor people have not meal enough to supply them with bread
through the winter On the other side of the river are the towns of
Paisley and Renfrew The first from an inconsiderable village is
become one of the most flourishing places of the kingdom enriched
by the linen cambrick flowered lawn and silk manufactures It was
formerly noted for a rich monastery of the monks of Clugny who wrote
the famous ScotiChronicon called The Black Book of Paisley The old
abbey still remains converted into a dwellinghouse belonging to the
earl of Dundonald Renfrew is a pretty town on the banks of Clyde
capital of the shire which was heretofore the patrimony of the Stuart
family and gave the title of baron to the kings eldest son which is
still assumed by the prince of Wales

The Clyde we left a little on our lefthand at Dunbritton where it
widens into an aestuary or frith being augmented by the influx of the
Leven On this spot stands the castle formerly called Alcluyd washed
by these two rivers on all sides except a narrow isthmus which at
every springtide is overflowed The whole is a great curiosity from
the quality and form of the rock as well as from the nature of its
situationWe now crossed the water of Leven which though nothing near
so considerable as the Clyde is much more transparent pastoral and
delightful This charming stream is the outlet of LoughLomond and
through a tract of four miles pursues its winding course murmuring over
a bed of pebbles till it joins the Frith at Dunbritton A very little
above its source on the lake stands the house of Cameron belonging to
Mr Smollett so embosomed in an oak wood that we did not see it till
we were within fifty yards of the door I have seen the Lago di Garda
Albano De Vico Bolsena and Geneva and upon my honour I prefer
LoughLomond to them all a preference which is certainly owing to the

ODE TO LEVENWATER

On Levens banks while free to rove And tune the rural pipe to love I
envied not the happiest swain That ever trod th Arcadian plain

Pure stream in whose transparent wave My youthful limbs I wont to
lave No torrents stain thy limpid source No rocks impede thy dimpling
course That sweetly warbles oer its bed With white round polishd
pebbles spread While lightly poisd the scaly brood In myriads cleave
thy crystal flood The springing trout in speckled pride The salmon
monarch of the tide The ruthless pike intent on war The silver eel
and motled par

Devolving from thy parent lake A charming maze thy waters make By
bowrs of birch and groves of pine And hedges flowrd with eglantine

Still on thy banks so gayly green May numrous herds and flocks be
seen And lasses chanting oer the pail And shepherds piping in the
dale And ancient faith that knows no guile And industry imbrownd with
toil And hearts resolvd and hands prepard The blessings they enjoy
to guard

  The par is a small fish not unlike the smelt which it
 rivals in delicacy and flavour




To Dr LEWIS

DEAR DOCTOR

If I was disposed to be critical I should say this house of Cameron is
too near the lake which approaches on one side to within six or seven
yards of the window It might have been placed in a higher site which
would have afforded a more extensive prospect and a drier atmosphere
but this imperfection is not chargeable on the present proprietor who
purchased it ready built rather than be at the trouble of repairing his
own familyhouse of Bonhill which stands two miles from hence on the
Leven so surrounded with plantation that it used to be known by the
name of the Mavis or thrush Nest Above that house is a romantic glen
or clift of a mountain covered with hanging woods having at bottom a
stream of fine water that forms a number of cascades in its descent to
join the Leven so that the scene is quite enchanting A captain of a
man of war who had made the circuit of the globe with Mr Anson being
conducted to this glen exclaimed Juan Fernandez by God

Indeed this country would be a perfect paradise if it was not like
Wales cursed with a weeping climate owing to the same cause in both
the neighbourhood of high mountains and a westerly situation exposed
to the vapours of the Atlantic ocean This air however notwithstanding
its humidity is so healthy that the natives are scarce ever visited by
any other disease than the smallpox and certain cutaneous evils which
are the effects of dirty living the great and general reproach of the
commonalty of this kingdom Here are a great many living monuments of
longaevity and among the rest a person whom I treat with singular
respect as a venerable druid who has lived near ninety years
without pain or sickness among oaks of his own plantingHe was once
proprietor of these lands but being of a projecting spirit some of
his schemes miscarried and he was obliged to part with his possession
which hath shifted hands two or three times since that period but every
succeeding proprietor hath done every thing in his power to make
his old age easy and comfortable He has a sufficiency to procure
the necessaries of life and he and his old woman reside in a small
convenient farmhouse having a little garden which he cultivates with
his own hands This ancient couple live in great health peace and
harmony and knowing no wants enjoy the perfection of content Mr
Smollet calls him the admiral because he insists upon steering his
pleasureboat upon the lake and he spends most of his time in ranging
through the woods which he declares he enjoys as much as if they were
still his own propertyI asked him the other day if he was never sick
and he answered Yes he had a slight fever the year before the union
If he was not deaf I should take much pleasure in his conversation for
he is very intelligent and his memory is surprisingly retentiveThese
are the happy effects of temperance exercise and good nature
Notwithstanding all his innocence however he was the cause of great
perturbation to my man Clinker whose natural superstition has been
much injured by the histories of witches fairies ghosts and goblins
which he has heard in this countryOn the evening after our arrival
Humphry strolled into the wood in the course of his meditation and all
at once the admiral stood before him under the shadow of a spreading
oak Though the fellow is far from being timorous in cases that are not
supposed preternatural he could not stand the sight of this apparition
but ran into the kitchen with his hair standing on end staring wildly
and deprived of utterance Mrs Jenkins seeing him in this condition
screamed aloud Lord have mercy upon us he has seen something Mrs
Tabitha was alarmed and the whole house in confusion When he was
recruited with a dram I desired him to explain the meaning of all this
agitation and with some reluctance he owned he had seen a spirit
in the shape of an old man with a white beard a black cap and a plaid
nightgown He was undeceived by the admiral in person who coming in
at this juncture appeared to be a creature of real flesh and blood

Do you know how we fare in this Scottish paradise We make free with our
landlords mutton which is excellent his poultryyard his garden
his dairy and his cellar which are all well stored We have delicious
salmon pike trout perch par c at the door for the taking The
Frith of Clyde on the other side of the hill supplies us with mullet
red and grey cod mackarel whiting and a variety of seafish
including the finest fresh herrings I ever tasted We have sweet juicy
beef and tolerable veal with delicate bread from the little town of
Dunbritton and plenty of partridge growse heath cock and other game
in presents

We have been visited by all the gentlemen in the neighbourhood and they
have entertained us at their houses not barely with hospitality but
with such marks of cordial affection as one would wish to find among
near relations after an absence of many years

I told you in my last I had projected an excursion to the Highlands
which project I have now happily executed under the auspices of Sir
George Colquhoun a colonel in the Dutch service who offered himself
as our conductor on this occasion Leaving our women at Cameron to
the care and inspection of Lady H C we set out on horseback for
Inverary the county town of Argyle and dined on the road with the
Laird of Macfarlane the greatest genealogist I ever knew in any
country and perfectly acquainted with all the antiquities of Scotland

The Duke of Argyle has an old castle in Inverary where he resides when
he is in Scotland and hard by is the shell of a noble Gothic palace
built by the last duke which when finished will be a great ornament
to this part of the Highlands As for Inverary it is a place of very
little importance

This country is amazingly wild especially towards the mountains which
are heaped upon the backs of one another making a most stupendous
appearance of savage nature with hardly any signs of cultivation or
even of population All is sublimity silence and solitude The people
live together in glens or bottoms where they are sheltered from the
cold and storms of winter but there is a margin of plain ground spread
along the sea side which is well inhabited and improved by the arts of
husbandry and this I take to be one of the most agreeable tracts of the
whole island the sea not only keeps it warm and supplies it with fish
but affords one of the most ravishing prospects in the whole world I
mean the appearance of the Hebrides or Western Islands to the number
of three hundred scattered as far as the eye can reach in the most
agreeable confusion As the soil and climate of the Highlands are but
ill adapted to the cultivation of corn the people apply themselves
chiefly to the breeding and feeding of black cattle which turn to good
account Those animals run wild all the winter without any shelter or
subsistence but what they can find among the heath When the snow lies
so deep and hard that they cannot penetrate to the roots of the grass
they make a diurnal progress guided by a sure instinct to the seaside
at low water where they feed on the alga marina and other plants that
grow upon the beach

Perhaps this branch of husbandry which required very little attendance
and labour is one of the principal causes of that idleness and want of
industry which distinguishes these mountaineers in their own country
When they come forth into the world they become as diligent and alert
as any people upon earth They are undoubtedly a very distinct species
from their fellow subjects of the Lowlands against whom they indulge
an ancient spirit of animosity and this difference is very discernible
even among persons of family and education The Lowlanders are generally
cool and circumspect the Highlanders fiery and ferocious but this
violence of their passions serves only to inflame the zeal of their
devotion to strangers which is truly enthusiastic

We proceeded about twenty miles beyond Inverary to the house of a
gentleman a friend of our conductor where we stayed a few days and
were feasted in such a manner that I began to dread the consequence to
my constitution

Notwithstanding the solitude that prevails among these mountains there
is no want of people in the Highlands I am credibly informed that the
duke of Argyle can assemble five thousand men in arms of his own clan
and surname which is Campbell and there is besides a tribe of the same
appellation whose chief is the Earl of Breadalbine The Macdonalds
are as numerous and remarkably warlike the Camerons MLeods Frasers
Grants MKenzies MKays MPhersons MIntoshes are powerful clans
so that if all the Highlanders including the inhabitants of the Isles
were united they could bring into the field an army of forty thousand
fighting men capable of undertaking the most dangerous enterprize We
have lived to see four thousand of them without discipline throw
the whole kingdom of Great Britain into confusion They attacked and
defeated two armies of regular troops accustomed to service They
penetrated into the centre of England and afterwards marched back
with deliberation in the face of two other armies through an enemys
country where every precaution was taken to cut off their retreat I
know not any other people in Europe who without the use or knowledge
of arms will attack regular forces sword in hand if their chief
will head them in battle When disciplined they cannot fail of being
excellent soldiers They do not walk like the generality of mankind but
trot and bounce like deer as if they moved upon springs They greatly
excel the Lowlanders in all the exercises that require agility they are
incredibly abstemious and patient of hunger and fatigueso steeled
against the weather that in travelling even when the ground is covered
with snow they never look for a house or any other shelter but their
plaid in which they wrap themselves up and go to sleep under the cope
of heaven Such people in quality of soldiers must be invincible
when the business is to perform quick marches in a difficult country
to strike sudden strokes beat up the enemys quarters harrass their
cavalry and perform expeditions without the formality of magazines
baggage forage and artillery The chieftainship of the Highlanders
is a very dangerous influence operating at the extremity of the island
where the eyes and hands of government cannot be supposed to see and
act with precision and vigour In order to break the force of clanship
administration has always practised the political maxim Divide et
impera The legislature hath not only disarmed these mountaineers but
also deprived them of their antient garb which contributed in a great
measure to keep up their military spirit and their slavish tenures are
all dissolved by act of parliament so that they are at present as
free and independent of their chiefs as the law can make them but the
original attachment still remains and is founded on something prior to
the feudal system about which the writers of this age have made such a
pother as if it was a new discovery like the Copernican system Every
peculiarity of policy custom and even temperament is affectedly
traced to this origin as if the feudal constitution had not been common
to almost all the natives of Europe For my part I expect to see the
use of trunkhose and buttered ale ascribed to the influence of the
feudal system The connection between the clans and their chiefs is
without all doubt patriarchal It is founded on hereditary regard
and affection cherished through a long succession of ages The clan
consider the chief as their father they bear his name they believe
themselves descended from his family and they obey him as their lord
with all the ardour of filial love and veneration while he on his
part exerts a paternal authority commanding chastising rewarding
protecting and maintaining them as his own children If the legislature
would entirely destroy this connection it must compel the Highlanders
to change their habitation and their names Even this experiment has
been formerly tried without successIn the reign of James VI a battle
was fought within a few short miles of this place between two clans
the MGregors and the Colquhouns in which the latter were defeated the
Laird of MGregor made such a barbarous use of his victory that he was
forfeited and outlawed by act of parliament his lands were given to the
family of Montrose and his clan were obliged to change their name
They obeyed so far as to call themselves severally Campbell Graham or
Drummond the surnames of the families of Argyle Montrose and Perth
that they might enjoy the protection of those houses but they still
added MGregor to their new appellation and as their chief was deprived
of his estate they robbed and plundered for his subsistenceMr
Cameron of Lochiel the chief of that clan whose father was attainted
for having been concerned in the last rebellion returning from France
in obedience to a proclamation and act of parliament passed at the
beginning of the late war payed a visit to his own country and hired a
farm in the neighbourhood of his fathers house which had been burnt
to the ground The clan though ruined and scattered no sooner heard of
his arrival than they flocked to him from all quarters to welcome his
return and in a few days stocked his farm with seven hundred black
cattle which they had saved in the general wreck of their affairs but
their beloved chief who was a promising youth did not live to enjoy
the fruits of their fidelity and attachment

The most effectual method I know to weaken and at length destroy this
influence is to employ the commonalty in such a manner as to give them
a taste of property and independence In vain the government grants them
advantageous leases on the forfeited estates if they have no property
to prosecute the means of improvementThe sea is an inexhaustible fund
of riches but the fishery cannot be carried on without vessels casks
salt lines nets and other tackle I conversed with a sensible man of
this country who from a real spirit of patriotism had set up a fishery
on the coast and a manufacture of coarse linen for the employment of
the poor Highlanders Cod is here in such plenty that he told me he
had seen several hundred taken on one line at one hawlIt must be
observed however that the line was of immense length and had two
thousand hooks baited with muscles but the fish was so superior to
the cod caught on the banks of Newfoundland that his correspondent at
Lisbon sold them immediately at his own price although Lent was just
over when they arrived and the people might be supposed quite cloyed
with this kind of dietHis linen manufacture was likewise in a
prosperous way when the late war intervening all his best hands were
pressed into the service

It cannot be expected that the gentlemen of this country should execute
commercial schemes to render their vassals independent nor indeed are
such schemes suited to their way of life and inclination but a company
of merchants might with proper management turn to good account a
fishery established in this part of ScotlandOur people have a strange
itch to colonize America when the uncultivated parts of our own island
might be settled to greater advantage

After having rambled through the mountains and glens of Argyle we
visited the adjacent islands of Ila Jura Mull and Icomkill In the
first we saw the remains of a castle built in a lake where Macdonald
lord or king of the isles formerly resided Jura is famous for having
given birth to one Mackcrain who lived one hundred and eighty years
in one house and died in the reign of Charles the Second Mull affords
several bays where there is safe anchorage in one of which the
Florida a ship of the Spanish armada was blown up by one of Mr
Smolletts ancestorsAbout forty years ago John duke of Argyle is
said to have consulted the Spanish registers by which it appeared
that this ship had the military chest on boardHe employed experienced
divers to examine the wreck and they found the hull of the vessel still
entire but so covered with sand that they could not make their way
between decks however they picked up several pieces of plate that
were scattered about in the bay and a couple of fine brass cannon

Icolmkill or Iona is a small island which St Columba chose for his
habitationIt was respected for its sanctity and college or seminary
of ecclesiasticsPart of its church is still standing with the
tombs of several Scottish Irish and Danish sovereigns who were
here interredThese islanders are very bold and dexterous watermen
consequently the better adapted to the fishery in their manners they
are less savage and impetuous than their countrymen on the continent
and they speak the Erse or Gaelick in its greatest purity

Having sent round our horses by land we embarked in the distinct of
Cowal for Greenock which is a neat little town on the other side of
the Frith with a curious harbour formed by three stone jetties carried
out a good way into the seaNewportGlasgow is such another place
about two miles higher up Both have a face of business and plenty and
are supported entirely by the shipping of Glasgow of which I counted
sixty large vessels in these harboursTaking boat again at Newport
we were in less than an hour landed on the other side within two short
miles of our headquarters where we found our women in good health and
spirits They had been two days before joined by Mr Smollett and his
lady to whom we have such obligations as I cannot mention even to you
without blushing

Tomorrow we shall bid adieu to the Scotch Arcadia and begin our
progress to the southward taking our way by Lanerk and Nithsdale
to the west borders of England I have received so much advantage and
satisfaction from this tour that if my health suffers no revolution in
the winter I believe I shall be tempted to undertake another
expedition to the Northern extremity of Caithness unencumbered by those
impediments which now clog the heels of

To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS at Gloucester

MY DEAREST LETTY

Never did poor prisoner long for deliverance more than I have longed
for an opportunity to disburthen my cares into your friendly bosom
and the occasion which now presents itself is little less than
miraculousHonest Saunders Macawly the travelling Scotchman who goes
every year to Wales is now at Glasgow buying goods and coming to pay
his respects to our family has undertaken to deliver this letter
into your own handWe have been six weeks in Scotland and seen the
principal towns of the kingdom where we have been treated with
great civilityThe people are very courteous and the country being
exceedingly romantic suits my turn and inclinationsI contracted some
friendships at Edinburgh which is a large and lofty city full of gay
company and in particular commenced an intimate correspondence with
one miss Rtn an amiable young lady of my own age whose charms
seemed to soften and even to subdue the stubborn heart of my brother
Jery but he no sooner left the place than he relapsed into his former
insensibilityI feel however that this indifference is not the family
constitutionI never admitted but one idea of love and that has taken
such root in my heart as to be equally proof against all the pulls of
discretion and the frosts of neglect

Dear Letty I had an alarming adventure at the hunters ball in
EdinburghWhile I sat discoursing with a friend in a corner all at
once the very image of Wilson stood before me dressed exactly as he was
in the character of Aimwell It was one Mr Gordon whom I had not seen
beforeShocked at the sudden apparition I fainted away and threw the
whole assembly in confusionHowever the cause of my disorder remained
a secret to every body but my brother who was likewise struck with
the resemblance and scolded after we came homeI am very sensible
of Jerys affection and know he spoke as well with a view to my own
interest and happiness as in regard to the honour of the family but
I cannot bear to have my wounds probed severelyI was not so much
affected by the censure he passed upon my own indiscretion as with the
reflection he made on the conduct of Wilson He observed that if he
was really the gentleman he pretended to be and harboured nothing but
honourable designs he would have vindicated his pretensions in the face
of dayThis remark made a deep impression upon my mindI endeavoured
to conceal my thoughts and this endeavour had a bad effect upon my
health and spirits so it was thought necessary that I should go to the
Highlands and drink the goatmilkwhey

We went accordingly to Lough Lomond one of the most enchanting spots
in the whole world and what with this remedy which I had every morning
fresh from the mountains and the pure air and chearful company I
have recovered my flesh and appetite though there is something still
at bottom which it is not in the power of air exercise company or
medicine to removeThese incidents would not touch me so nearly if I
had a sensible confidant to sympathize with my affliction and comfort
me with wholesome adviceI have nothing of this kind except Win
Jenkins who is really a good body in the main but very ill qualified
for such an officeThe poor creature is weak in her nerves as well
as in her understanding otherwise I might have known the true name and
character of that unfortunate youthBut why do I call him unfortunate
perhaps the epithet is more applicable to me for having listened to the
false professions ofBut hold I have as yet no right and sure I have
no inclination to believe any thing to the prejudice of his honourIn
that reflection I shall still exert my patience As for Mrs Jenkins she
herself is really an object of compassionBetween vanity methodism
and love her head is almost turned I should have more regard for her
however if she had been more constant in the object of her affection
but truly she aimed at conquest and flirted at the same time with my
uncles footman Humphrey Clinker who is really a deserving young man
and one Dutton my brothers valet de chambre a debauched fellow who
leaving Win in the lurch ran away with another mans bride at Berwick

My dear Willis I am truly ashamed of my own sexWe complain of
advantages which the men take of our youth inexperience insensibility
and all that but I have seen enough to believe that our sex in general
make it their business to ensnare the other and for this purpose
employ arts which are by no means to be justifiedIn point of
constancy they certainly have nothing to reproach the male part of
the creationMy poor aunt without any regard to her years and
imperfections has gone to market with her charms in every place where
she thought she had the least chance to dispose of her person which
however hangs still heavy on her handsI am afraid she has used even
religion as a decoy though it has not answered her expectationShe has
been praying preaching and catechising among the methodists with
whom this country abounds and pretends to have such manifestations and
revelations as even Clinker himself can hardly believe though the poor
fellow is half crazy with enthusiasm As for Jenkins she affects
to take all her mistresss reveries for gospel She has also her
heartheavings and motions of the spirit and God forgive me if I think
uncharitably but all this seems to me to be downright hypocrisy and
deceitPerhaps indeed the poor girl imposes on herselfShe is
generally in a flutter and is much subject to vapoursSince we came
to Scotland she has seen apparitions and pretends to prophesyIf I
could put faith in all these supernatural visitations I should think
myself abandoned of grace for I have neither seen heard nor felt
anything of this nature although I endeavour to discharge the duties
of religion with all the sincerity zeal and devotion that is in the
power of

Dear Letty your ever affectionate LYDIA MELFORD GLASGOW Sept 7

We are so far on our return to Brambletonhall and I would fain hope
we shall take Gloucester in our way in which case I shall have the
inexpressible pleasure of embracing my dear WillisPray remember me to

To Mrs MARY JONES at Brambletonhall

DEAR MARY

Sunders Macully the Scotchman who pushes directly for Vails has
promised to give it you into your own hand and therefore I would not
miss the opportunity to let you know as I am still in the land of the
living and yet I have been on the brink of the other world since I sent
you my last letterWe went by sea to another kingdom called Fife and
coming back had like to have gone to pot in a stormWhat between the
frite and sickness I thought I should have brought my heart up even
Mr Clinker was not his own man for eight and forty hours after we
got ashore It was well for some folks that we scaped drownding for
mistress was very frexious and seemed but indifferently prepared for
a change but thank God she was soon put in a better frame by the
private exaltations of the reverend Mr MacrocodileWe afterwards
churned to Starling and Grascow which are a kiple of handsome towns
and then we went to a gentlemans house at LoffLoming which is a
wonderful sea of fresh water with a power of hylands in the midst
ontThey say as how it has ner a bottom and was made by a musician
and truly I believe it for it is not in the coarse of natureIt has
got waves without wind fish without fins and a floating hyland and
one of them is a crutchyard where the dead are buried and always
before the person dies a bell rings of itself to give warning

O Mary this is the land of congyrationThe bell knolled when we
were thereI saw lights and heard lamentationsThe gentleman our
landlord has got another house which he was fain to quit on account
of a mischievous ghost that would not suffer people to lie in their
beds The fairies dwell in a hole of Kairmann a mounting hard by and
they steal away the good women that are in the straw if so be as how
there ant a horshoe nailed to the door and I was shewn an ould vitch
called Elspath Ringavey with a red petticoat bleared eyes and a mould
of grey bristles on her sinThat she mought do me no harm I crossed
her hand with a taster and bid her tell my fortune and she told me
such things descriving Mr Clinker to a hairbut it shall neer be said
that I minchioned a word of the matterAs I was troubled with fits
she advised me to bathe in the loff which was holy water and so I
went in the morning to a private place along with the housemaid and
we bathed in our birthday soot after the fashion of the country and
behold whilst we dabbled in the loff sir George Coon started up with a
gun but we clapt our hands to our faces and passed by him to the place
where we had left our smocksA civil gentleman would have turned his
head another wayMy comfit is he knew not which was which and as
the saying is all cats in the dark are greyWhilst we stayed at
LoffLoming he and our two squires went three or four days churning
among the wild men of the mountings a parcel of selvidges that lie in
caves among the rocks devour young children speak Velch but the vords
are different Our ladies would not part with Mr Clinker because he is
so stout and so pyehouse that he fears neither man nor devils if so be
as they dont take him by surpriseIndeed he was once so flurried by
an operition that he had like to have soundedHe made believe as if
it had been the ould edmiral but the old edmiral could not have made
his air to stand on end and his teeth to shatter but he said so in
prudence that the ladies mought not be afeard Miss Liddy has been
puny and like to go into a declineI doubt her pore art is too
tinderbut the gotsfey has set her on her legs againYou nows
gotsfey is mothers milk to a Velch woman As for mistress blessed be
God she ails nothingHer stomick is good and she improves in grease
and godliness but for all that she may have infections like other
people and I believe she wouldnt be sorry to be called your ladyship
whenever sir George thinks proper to ax the questionBut for my part

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart at Oxon

DEAR KNIGHT

Once more I tread upon English ground which I like not the worse for
the six weeks ramble I have made among the woods and mountains of
Caledonia no offence to the land of cakes where bannocks grow upon
straw I never saw my uncle in such health and spirits as he now enjoys
Liddy is perfectly recovered and Mrs Tabitha has no reason to complain
Nevertheless I believe she was till yesterday inclined to give the
whole Scotch nation to the devil as a pack of insensible brutes upon
whom her accomplishments had been displayed in vainAt every place
where we halted did she mount the stage and flourished her rusty arms
without being able to make one conquest One of her last essays was
against the heart of Sir George Colquhoun with whom she fought all
the weapons more than twice overShe was grave and gay by turnsshe
moralized and methodizedshe laughed and romped and danced and sung
and sighed and ogled and lisped and fluttered and flatteredbut all
was preaching to the desart The baronet being a wellbred man carried
his civilities as far as she could in conscience expect and if evil
tongues are to be believed some degrees farther but he was too much a
veteran in gallantry as well as in war to fall into any ambuscade that
she could lay for his affectionWhile we were absent in the Highlands
she practised also upon the laird of Ladrishmore and even gave him
the rendezvous in the wood of Drumscailloch but the laird had such
a reverend care of his own reputation that he came attended with the
parson of the parish and nothing passed but spiritual communication
After all these miscarriages our aunt suddenly recollected lieutenant
Lismahago whom ever since our first arrival at Edinburgh she seemed
to have utterly forgot but now she expressed her hopes of seeing him at
Dumfries according to his promise

We set out from Glasgow by the way of Lanerk the countytown of
Clydesdale in the neighbourhood of which the whole river Clyde
rushing down a steep rock forms a very noble and stupendous cascade
Next day we were obliged to halt in a small borough until the carriage
which had received some damage should be repaired and here we met
with an incident which warmly interested the benevolent spirit of Mr
BrambleAs we stood at the window of an inn that fronted the public
prison a person arrived on horseback genteelly tho plainly dressed
in a blue frock with his own hair cut short and a goldlaced hat upon
his headAlighting and giving his horse to the landlord he advanced
to an old man who was at work in paving the street and accosted him in
these words This is hard work for such an old man as youSo
saying he took the instrument out of his hand and began to thump the
pavementAfter a few strokes Have you never a son said he to ease
you of this labour Yes an please Your honour replied the senior
I have three hopeful lads but at present they are out of the way
Honour not me cried the stranger but more becomes me to honour your
grey hairs Where are those sons you talk of The ancient paviour said
his eldest son was a captain in the East Indies and the youngest had
lately inlisted as a soldier in hopes of prospering like his brother
The gentleman desiring to know what was become of the second he wiped
his eyes and owned he had taken upon him his old fathers debts for
which he was now in the prison hard by

The traveller made three quick steps towards the jail then turning
short Tell me said he has that unnatural captain sent you nothing
to relieve your distress Call him not unnatural replied the other
Gods blessing be upon him he sent me a great deal of money but I made
a bad use of it I lost it by being security for a gentleman that was
my landlord and was stript of all I had in the world besides At that
instant a young man thrusting out his head and neck between two iron
bars in the prisonwindow exclaimed Father father if my brother
William is in life thats he I amI amcried the stranger
clasping the old man in his arms and shedding a flood of tearsI
am your son Willy sure enough Before the father who was quite
confounded could make any return to this tenderness a decent old woman
bolting out from the door of a poor habitation cried Where is my
bairn where is my dear WillyThe captain no sooner beheld her than
he quitted his father and ran into her embrace

I can assure you my uncle who saw and heard every thing that passed
was as much moved as any one of the parties concerned in this pathetic
recognitionHe sobbed and wept and clapped his hands and hollowed
and finally ran down into the street By this time the captain had
retired with his parents and all the inhabitants of the place were
assembled at the doorMr Bramble nevertheless pressed thro the
crowd and entering the house Captain said he I beg the favour of
your acquaintance I would have travelled a hundred miles to see this
affecting scene and I shall think myself happy if you and your parents
will dine with me at the public house The captain thanked him for his
kind invitation which he said he would accept with pleasure but in
the mean time he could not think of eating or drinking while his poor
brother was in trouble He forthwith deposited a sum equal to the debt
in the hands of the magistrate who ventured to set his brother at
liberty without farther process and then the whole family repaired to
the inn with my uncle attended by the crowd the individuals of which
shook their townsman by the hand while he returned their caresses
without the least sign of pride or affectation

This honest favourite of fortune whose name was Brown told my uncle
that he had been bred a weaver and about eighteen years ago had
from a spirit of idleness and dissipation enlisted as a soldier in the
service of the EastIndia company that in the course of duty he had
the good fortune to attract the notice and approbation of Lord Clive
who preferred him from one step to another till he attained the rank
of captain and paymaster to the regiment in which capacities he
had honestly amassed above twelve thousand pounds and at the peace
resigned his commissionHe had sent several remittances to his father
who received the first only consisting of one hundred pounds the
second had fallen into the hands of a bankrupt and the third had been
consigned to a gentleman of Scotland who died before it arrived so
that it still remained to be accounted for by his executors He now
presented the old man with fifty pounds for his present occasions over
and above bank notes for one hundred which he had deposited for his
brothers releaseHe brought along with him a deed ready executed by
which he settled a perpetuity of fourscore pounds upon his parents to
be inherited by their other two sons after their deceaseHe promised
to purchase a commission for his youngest brother to take the other as
his own partner in a manufacture which he intended to set up to give
employment and bread to the industrious and to give five hundred
pounds by way of dower to his sister who had married a farmer in low
circumstances Finally he gave fifty pounds to the poor of the town
where he was born and feasted all the inhabitants without exception

My uncle was so charmed with the character of captain Brown that he
drank his health three times successively at dinnerHe said he was
proud of his acquaintance that he was an honour to his country and
had in some measure redeemed human nature from the reproach of pride
selfishness and ingratitudeFor my part I was as much pleased
with the modesty as with the filial virtue of this honest soldier
who assumed no merit from his success and said very little of his own
transactions though the answers he made to our inquiries were equally
sensible and laconic Mrs Tabitha behaved very graciously to him until
she understood that he was going to make a tender of his hand to a
person of low estate who had been his sweetheart while he worked as
a journeyman weaverOur aunt was no sooner made acquainted with this
design than she starched up her behaviour with a double proportion of
reserve and when the company broke up she observed with a toss of her
nose that Brown was a civil fellow enough considering the lowness of
his original but that Fortune though she had mended his circumstances
was incapable to raise his ideas which were still humble and plebeian

On the day that succeeded this adventure we went some miles out of our
road to see Drumlanrig a seat belonging to the duke of Queensberry
which appears like a magnificent palace erected by magic in the midst
of a wildernessIt is indeed a princely mansion with suitable parks
and plantations rendered still more striking by the nakedness of
the surrounding country which is one of the wildest tracts in all
ScotlandThis wildness however is different from that of the
Highlands for here the mountains instead of heath are covered with a
fine green swarth affording pasture to innumerable flocks of sheep But
the fleeces of this country called Nithsdale are not comparable to the
wool of Galloway which is said to equal that of Salisbury plain Having
passed the night at the castle of Drumlanrig by invitation from
the duke himself who is one of the best men that ever breathed we
prosecuted our journey to Dumfries a very elegant trading town near
the borders of England where we found plenty of good provision and
excellent wine at very reasonable prices and the accommodation as good
in all respects as in any part of SouthBritain If I was confined to
Scotland for life I would chuse Dumfries as the place of my residence
Here we made enquiries about captain Lismahago of whom hearing no
tidings we proceeded by the Solway Frith to Carlisle You must know
that the Solway sands upon which travellers pass at low water are
exceedingly dangerous because as the tide makes they become quick
in different places and the flood rushes in so impetuously that the
passengers are often overtaken by the sea and perish

In crossing these treacherous Syrtes with a guide we perceived a
drowned horse which Humphry Clinker after due inspection declared to
be the very identical beast which Mr Lismahago rode when he parted with
us at Feltonbridge in Northumberland This information which seemed
to intimate that our friend the lieutenant had shared the fate of his
horse affected us all and above all our aunt Tabitha who shed salt
tears and obliged Clinker to pull a few hairs out of the dead horses
tail to be worn in a ring as a remembrance of his master but her grief
and ours was not of long duration for one of the first persons we saw
in Carlisle was the lieutenant in propria persona bargaining with
a horsedealer for another steed in the yard of the inn where we
alightedMrs Bramble was the first that perceived him and screamed
as if she had seen a ghost and truly at a proper time and place he
might very well have passed for an inhabitant of another world for
he was more meagre and grim than beforeWe received him the more
cordially for having supposed he had been drowned and he was not
deficient in expressions of satisfaction at this meeting He told us
he had enquired for us at Dumfries and been informed by a travelling
merchant from Glasgow that we had resolved to return by the way of
Coldstream He said that in passing the sands without a guide his
horse had knocked up and he himself must have perished if he had not
been providentially relieved by a return postchaiseHe moreover gave
us to understand that his scheme of settling in his own country having
miscarried he was so far on his way to London with a view to embark
for NorthAmerica where he intended to pass the rest of his days among
his old friends the Miamis and amuse himself in finishing the education
of the son he had by his beloved Squinkinacoosta

This project was by no means agreeable to our good aunt who expatiated
upon the fatigues and dangers that would attend such a long voyage
by sea and afterwards such a tedious journey by landShe enlarged
particularly on the risque he would run with respect to the concerns
of his precious soul among savages who had not yet received the glad
tidings of salvation and she hinted that his abandoning GreatBritain
might perhaps prove fatal to the inclinations of some deserving
person whom he was qualified to make happy for life My uncle who is
really a Don Quixote in generosity understanding that Lismahagos real
reason for leaving Scotland was the impossibility of subsisting in it
with any decency upon the wretched provision of a subalterns halfpay
began to be warmly interested on the side of compassionHe thought
it very hard that a gentleman who had served his country with honour
should be driven by necessity to spend his old age among the refuse of
mankind in such a remote part of the worldHe discoursed with me upon
the subject observing that he would willingly offer the lieutenant an
asylum at Brambletonhall if he did not foresee that his singularities
and humour of contradiction would render him an intolerable housemate
though his conversation at some times might be both instructive and
entertaining but as there seemed to be something particular in
his attention to Mrs Tabitha he and I agreed in opinion that this
intercourse should be encouraged and improved if possible into a
matrimonial union in which case there would be a comfortable provision
for both and they might be settled in a house of their own so that Mr
Bramble should have no more of their company than he desired

In pursuance of this design Lismahago has been invited to pass the
winter at Brambletonhall as it will be time enough to execute his
American project in the springHe has taken time to consider of this
proposal mean while he will keep us company as far as we travel in the
road to Bristol where he has hopes of getting a passage for America
I make no doubt but that he will postpone his voyage and prosecute his
addresses to a happy consummation and sure if it produces any
fruit it must be of a very peculiar flavour As the weather continues
favourable I believe we shall take the Peak of Derbyshire and Buxton
Wells in our wayAt any rate from the first place where we make any
stay you shall hear again from

Yours always J MELFORD CARLISLE Sep 12




To Dr LEWIS

DEAR DOCTOR

The peasantry of Scotland are certainly on a poor footing all over the
kingdom and yet they look better and are better cloathed than those
of the same rank in Burgundy and many other places of France and Italy
nay I will venture to say they are better fed notwithstanding
the boasted wine of these foreign countries The country people of
NorthBritain live chiefly on oatmeal and milk cheese butter
and some gardenstuff with now and then a pickledherring by way of
delicacy but fleshmeat they seldom or never taste nor any kind of
strong liquor except twopenny at times of uncommon festivityTheir
breakfast is a kind of hasty pudding of oatmeal or peasemeal eaten
with milk They have commonly pottage for dinner composed of cale or
cole leeks barley or big and butter and this is reinforced with
bread and cheese made of skimmedmilkAt night they sup on sowens or
flummery of oatmealIn a scarcity of oats they use the meal of barley
and pease which is both nourishing and palatable Some of them have
potatoes and you find parsnips in every peasants gardenThey are
cloathed with a coarse kind of russet of their own making which is
both decent and warmThey dwell in poor huts built of loose stones and
turf without any mortar having a fireplace or hearth in the middle
generally made of an old millstone and a hole at top to let out the
smoke

These people however are content and wonderfully sagaciousAll of
them read the Bible and are even qualified to dispute upon the
articles of their faith which in those parts I have seen is entirely
Presbyterian I am told that the inhabitants of Aberdeenshire are still
more acute I once knew a Scotch gentleman at London who had declared
war against this part of his countrymen and swore that the impudence
and knavery of the Scots in that quarter had brought a reproach upon
the whole nation

The river Clyde above Glasgow is quite pastoral and the banks of it
are every where adorned with fine villas From the sea to its source
we may reckon the seats of many families of the first rank such as the
duke of Argyle at Roseneath the earl of Bute in the isle of that name
the earl of Glencairn at Finlayston lord Blantyre at Areskine the
dutchess of Douglas at Bothwell duke Hamilton at Hamilton the duke of
Douglas at Douglas and the earl of Hyndford at Carmichael Hamilton is
a noble palace magnificently furnished and hard by is the village of
that name one of the neatest little towns I have seen in any country
The old castle of Douglas being burned to the ground by accident the
late duke resolved as head of the first family of Scotland to have the
largest house in the kingdom and ordered a plan for this purpose but
there was only one wing of it finished when he died It is to be hoped
that his nephew who is now in possession of his great fortune will
complete the design of his predecessorClydesdale is in general
populous and rich containing a great number of gentlemen who
are independent in their fortune but it produces more cattle than
cornThis is also the case with Tweedale through part of which
we passed and Nithsdale which is generally rough wild and
mountainousThese hills are covered with sheep and this is the small
delicious mutton so much preferable to that of the Londonmarket As
their feeding costs so little the sheep are not killed till five years
old when their flesh juices and flavour are in perfection but their
fleeces are much damaged by the tar with which they are smeared to
preserve them from the rot in winter during which they run wild night
and day and thousands are lost under huge wreaths of snowTis pity
the farmers cannot contrive some means to shelter this useful animal
from the inclemencies of a rigorous climate especially from the
perpetual rains which are more prejudicial than the greatest extremity
of cold weather

On the little river Nid is situated the castle of Drumlanrig one
of the noblest seats in GreatBritain belonging to the duke of
Queensberry one of those few noblemen whose goodness of heart does
honour to humannatureI shall not pretend to enter into a description
of this palace which is really an instance of the sublime in
magnificence as well as in situation and puts one in mind of the
beautiful city of Palmyra rising like a vision in the midst of
the wilderness His grace keeps open house and lives with great
splendourHe did us the honour to receive us with great courtesy and
detaind us all night together with above twenty other guests with all
their servants and horses to a very considerable numberThe dutchess
was equally gracious and took our ladies under her immediate
protection The longer I live I see more reason to believe that
prejudices of education are never wholly eradicated even when they
are discovered to be erroneous and absurd Such habits of thinking as
interest the grand passions cleave to the human heart in such a manner
that though an effort of reason may force them from their hold for a
moment this violence no sooner ceases than they resume their grasp
with an increased elasticity and adhesion

I am led into this reflection by what passed at the dukes table after
supper The conversation turned upon the vulgar notions of spirits and
omens that prevail among the commonalty of NorthBritain and all the
company agreed that nothing could be more ridiculous One gentleman
however told a remarkable story of himself by way of speculation
Being on a party of hunting in the North said he I resolved to visit
an old friend whom I had not seen for twenty yearsSo long he had been
retired and sequestered from all his acquaintance and lived in a moping
melancholy way much afflicted with lowness of spirits occasioned by
the death of his wife whom he had loved with uncommon affection As he
resided in a remote part of the country and we were five gentlemen with
as many servants we carried some provision with us from the next market
town lest we should find him unprepared for our reception The roads
being bad we did not arrive at the house till two oclock in the
afternoon and were agreeably surprised to find a very good dinner ready
in the kitchen and the cloth laid with six covers My friend himself
appeared in his best apparel at the gate and received us with open
arms telling me he had been expecting us these two hours Astonished at
this declaration I asked who had given him intelligence of our coming
and he smiled without making any other reply However presuming upon
our former intimacy I afterwards insisted upon knowing and he told me
very gravely he had seen me in a vision of the second sightNay he
called in the evidence of his steward who solemnly declared that his
master had the day before apprised him of my coming with four other
strangers and ordered him to provide accordingly in consequence of
which intimation he had prepared the dinner which we were now eating
and laid the covers according to the number foretold The incident
we all owned to be remarkable and I endeavoured to account for it by
natural means I observed that as the gentleman was of a visionary
turn the casual idea or remembrance of his old friend might suggest
those circumstances which accident had for once realized but that in
all probability he had seen many visions of the same kind which were
never verified None of the company directly dissented from my opinion
but from the objections that were hinted I could plainly perceive that
the majority were persuaded there was something more extraordinary in
the case

Another gentleman of the company addressing himself to me Without all
doubt said he a diseased imagination is very apt to produce visions
but we must find some other method to account for something of this
kind that happened within these eight days in my neighbourhoodA
gentleman of a good family who cannot be deemed a visionary in any
sense of the word was near his own gate in the twilight visited by
his grandfather who has been dead these fifteen yearsThe spectre was
mounted seemingly on the very horse he used to ride with an angry and
terrible countenance and said something which his grandson in the
confusion of fear could not understand But this was not allHe lifted
up a huge horse whip and applied it with great violence to his back
and shoulders on which I saw the impression with my own eyes The
apparition was afterwards seen by the sexton of the parish hovering
about the tomb where his body lies interred as the man declared to
several persons in the village before he knew what had happened to the
gentlemanNay he actually came to me as a justice of the peace in
order to make oath of these particulars which however I declined
administering As for the grandson of the defunct he is a sober
sensible worldly minded fellow too intent upon schemes of interest to
give in to reveries He would have willingly concealed the affair but
he bawled out in the first transport of his fear and running into
the house exposed his back and his sconce to the whole family so that
there was no denying it in the sequel It is now the common discourse of
the country that this appearance and behaviour of the old mans spirit
portends some great calamity to the family and the goodwoman has
actually taken to her bed in this apprehension

Though I did not pretend to explain this mystery I said I did not at
all doubt but it would one day appear to be a deception and in all
probability a scheme executed by some enemy of the person who had
sustained the assault but still the gentleman insisted upon the
clearness of the evidence and the concurrence of testimony by which
two creditable witnesses without any communication one with another
affirmed the appearance of the same man with whose person they were
both well acquaintedFrom Drumlanrig we pursued the course of the Nid
to Dumfries which stands seven miles above the place where the river
falls into the sea and is after Glasgow the handsomest town I have
seen in Scotland The inhabitants indeed seem to have proposed that
city as their model not only in beautifying their town and regulating
its police but also in prosecuting their schemes of commerce and
manufacture by which they are grown rich and opulent

We reentered England by the way of Carlisle where we accidentally
met with our friend Lismahago whom we had in vain inquired after at
Dumfries and other placesIt would seem that the captain like the
prophets of old is but little honoured in his own country which he
has now renounced for everHe gave me the following particulars of his
visit to his native soilIn his way to the place of his nativity he
learned that his nephew had married the daughter of a burgeois who
directed a weaving manufacture and had gone into partnership with his
fatherinlaw chagrined with this information he had arrived at the
gate in the twilight where he heard the sound of treddles in the great
hall which had exasperated him to such a degree that he had like to
have lost his senses while he was thus transported with indignation
his nephew chanced to come forth when being no longer master of his
passion he cried Degenerate rascal you have made my fathers house a
den of thieves and at the same time chastised him with his
horsewhip then riding round the adjoining village he had visited
the buryingground of his ancestors by moonlight and having paid
his respects to their manes travelled all night to another part of
the countryFinding the head of the family in such a disgraceful
situation all his own friends dead or removed from the places of their
former residence and the expence of living increased to double of what
it had been when he first left his native country he had bid it an
eternal adieu and was determined to seek for repose among the forests
of America

I was no longer at a loss to account for the apparition which had
been described at Drumlanrig and when I repeated the story to the
lieutenant he was much pleased to think his resentment had been so much
more effectual than he intended and he owned he might at such an hour
and in such an equipage very well pass for the ghost of his father
whom he was said greatly to resembleBetween friends I fancy Lismahago
will find a retreat without going so far as the wigwams of the Miamis
My sister Tabby is making continual advances to him in the way of
affection and if I may trust to appearances the captain is disposed
to take opportunity by the forelock For my part I intend to encourage
this correspondence and shall be glad to see them unitedIn that case
we shall find a way to settle them comfortably in our own neighbourhood
I and my servants will get rid of a very troublesome and tyrannic
gouvernante and I shall have the benefit of Lismahagos conversation
without being obliged to take more of his company than I desire for
though an olla is a highflavoured dish I could not bear to dine upon
it every day of my life

I am much pleased with Manchester which is one of the most agreeable
and flourishing towns in GreatBritain and I perceive that this is
the place which hath animated the spirit and suggested the chief
manufactures of Glasgow We propose to visit Chatsworth the Peak
and Buxton from which last place we shall proceed directly homewards
though by easy journies If the season has been as favourable in Wales
as in the North your harvest is happily finished and we have nothing
left to think of but our October of which let Barns be properly
reminded You will find me much better in flesh than I was at our
parting and this short separation has given a new edge to those
sentiments of friendship with which I always have been and ever shall
be

MRS GWYLLIM

It has pleased Providence to bring us safe back to England and partake
us in many pearls by land and water in particular the Devils Harse
a pike and Hoydens Hole which hath got no bottom and as we are
drawing huomwards it may be proper to uprise you that Brambletonhall
may be in condition to receive us after this long gurney to the islands
of Scotland By the first of next month you may begin to make constant
fires in my brothers chamber and mine and burn a fagget every day in
the yellow damask room have the tester and curtains dusted and
the featherbed and matrosses well haired because perhaps with the
blissing of haven they may be yoosed on some occasion Let the ould
hogsheads be well skewred and seasoned for bear as Mat is resolved to
have his seller choak fool

If the house was mine I would turn over a new leafI dont see why
the sarvants of Wales shouldnt drink fair water and eat hot cakes and
barley cale as they do in Scotland without troubling the botcher
above once a quarterI hope you keep accunt of Rogers purseeding in
reverence to the buttermilk I expect my dew when I come huom without
baiting an ass Ill assure youAs you must have layed a great many
more eggs than would be eaten I do suppose there is a power of turks
chickings and guzzling about the house and a brave kergo of cheese
ready for market and that the owl has been sent to Crickhowel saving
what the maids spun in the family

Pray let the whole house and furniture have a thorough cleaning from top
to bottom for the honour of Wales and let Roger search into and make
a general clearance of the slit holes which the maids have in secret
for I know they are much given to sloth and uncleanness I hope you have
worked a reformation among them as I exhorted you in my last and set
their hearts upon better things than they can find in junkitting and
caterwauling with the fellows of the country

As for Win Jenkins she has undergone a perfect metamurphysis and is
become a new creeter from the ammunition of Humphry Clinker our new
footman a pious young man who has laboured exceedingly that she may
bring forth fruits of repentance I make no doubt but he will take the
same pains with that pert hussey Mary Jones and all of you and that
he may have power given to penetrate and instill his goodness even into
your most inward parts is the fervent prayer of

To Dr LEWIS

DEAR LEWIS

Lismahago is more paradoxical than everThe late gulp he had of his
native air seems to have blown fresh spirit into all his polemical
faculties I congratulated him the other day on the present flourishing
state of his country observing that the Scots were now in a fair way
to wipe off the national reproach of poverty and expressing my
satisfaction at the happy effects of the union so conspicuous in
the improvement of their agriculture commerce manufactures and
mannersThe lieutenant screwing up his features into a look of dissent
and disgust commented on my remarks to this effectThose who reproach
a nation for its poverty when it is not owing to the profligacy or vice
of the people deserve no answer The Lacedaemonians were poorer than
the Scots when they took the lead among all the free states of Greece
and were esteemed above them all for their valour and their virtue The
most respectable heroes of ancient Rome such as Fabricius Cincinnatus
and Regulus were poorer than the poorest freeholder in Scotland and
there are at this day individuals in NorthBritain one of whom can
produce more gold and silver than the whole republic of Rome could raise
at those times when her public virtue shone with unrivalled lustre and
poverty was so far from being a reproach that it added fresh laurels
to her fame because it indicated a noble contempt of wealth which was
proof against all the arts of corruptionIf poverty be a subject
for reproach it follows that wealth is the object of esteem and
venerationIn that case there are Jews and others in Amsterdam and
London enriched by usury peculation and different species of fraud
and extortion who are more estimable than the most virtuous and
illustrious members of the community An absurdity which no man in his
senses will offer to maintainRiches are certainly no proof of merit
nay they are often if not most commonly acquired by persons of sordid
minds and mean talents nor do they give any intrinsic worth to the
possessor but on the contrary tend to pervert his understanding and
render his morals more depraved But granting that poverty were really
matter of reproach it cannot be justly imputed to Scotland No country
is poor that can supply its inhabitants with the necessaries of life
and even afford articles for exportation Scotland is rich in natural
advantages it produces every species of provision in abundance vast
herds of cattle and flocks of sheep with a great number of horses
prodigious quantities of wool and flax with plenty of copse wood and
in some parts large forests of timber The earth is still more rich
below than above the surface It yields inexhaustible stores of coal
freestone marble lead iron copper and silver with some gold The
sea abounds with excellent fish and salt to cure them for exportation
and there are creeks and harbours round the whole kingdom for the
convenience and security of navigation The face of the country displays
a surprising number of cities towns villas and villages swarming
with people and there seems to be no want of art industry government
and police such a kingdom can never be called poor in any sense of the
word though there may be many others more powerful and opulent But the
proper use of those advantages and the present prosperity of the Scots
you seem to derive from the union of the two kingdoms

I said I supposed he would not deny that the appearance of the country
was much mended that the people lived better had more trade and a
greater quantity of money circulating since the union than before
I may safely admit these premises answered the lieutenant without
subscribing to your inference The difference you mention I should
take to be the natural progress of improvementSince that period other
nations such as the Swedes the Danes and in particular the French
have greatly increased in commerce without any such cause assigned
Before the union there was a remarkable spirit of trade among the
Scots as appeared in the case of their Darien company in which they
had embarked no less than four hundred thousand pounds sterling and in
the flourishing state of the maritime towns in Fife and on the eastern
coast enriched by their trade with France which failed in consequence
of the union The only solid commercial advantage reaped from that
measure was the privilege of trading to the English plantations yet
excepting Glasgow and Dumfries I dont know any other Scotch towns
concerned in that traffick In other respects I conceive the Scots were
losers by the unionThey lost the independency of their state the
greatest prop of national spirit they lost their parliament and their
courts of justice were subjected to the revision and supremacy of an
English tribunal

Softly captain cried I you cannot be said to have lost your own
parliament while you are represented in that of GreatBritain True
said he with a sarcastic grin in debates of national competition
the sixteen peers and fortyfive commoners of Scotland must make a
formidable figure in the scale against the whole English legislature
Be that as it may I observed while I had the honour to sit in the
lower house the Scotch members had always the majority on their side
I understand you Sir said he they generally side with the majority
so much the worse for their constituents But even this evil is not the
worst they have sustained by the union Their trade has been saddled
with grievous impositions and every article of living severely taxed
to pay the interest of enormous debts contracted by the English in
support of measures and connections in which the Scots had no interest
nor concern I begged he would at least allow that by the union the
Scots were admitted to all the privileges and immunities of English
subjects by which means multitudes of them were provided for in the
army and navy and got fortunes in different parts of England and its
dominions All these said he become English subjects to all intents
and purposes and are in a great measure lost to their mothercountry
The spirit of rambling and adventure has been always peculiar to the
natives of Scotland If they had not met with encouragement in England
they would have served and settled as formerly in other countries
such as Muscovy Sweden Denmark Poland Germany France Piedmont and
Italy in all which nations their descendants continue to flourish even
at this day

By this time my patience began to fail and I exclaimed For Gods
sake what has England got by this union which you say has been so
productive of misfortune to the Scots Great and manifold are the
advantages which England derives from the union said Lismahago in
a solemn tone First and foremost the settlement of the protestant
succession a point which the English ministry drove with such
eagerness that no stone was left unturned to cajole and bribe a few
leading men to cram the union down the throats of the Scottish nation
who were surprisingly averse to the expedient They gained by it a
considerable addition of territory extending their dominion to the sea
on all sides of the island thereby shutting up all backdoors against
the enterprizes of their enemies They got an accession of above a
million of useful subjects constituting a neverfailing nursery of
seamen soldiers labourers and mechanics a most valuable acquisition
to a trading country exposed to foreign wars and obliged to maintain
a number of settlements in all the four quarters of the globe In the
course of seven years during the last war Scotland furnished the
English army and navy with seventy thousand men over and above those
who migrated to their colonies or mingled with them at home in the
civil departments of life This was a very considerable and seasonable
supply to a nation whose people had been for many years decreasing in
number and whose lands and manufactures were actually suffering for
want of hands I need not remind you of the hackneyed maxim that to a
nation in such circumstances a supply of industrious people is a
supply of wealth nor repeat an observation which is now received as
an eternal truth even among the English themselves that the Scots who
settle in SouthBritain are remarkably sober orderly and industrious

I allowed the truth of this remark adding that by their industry
oeconomy and circumspection many of them in England as well as in her
colonies amassed large fortunes with which they returned to their own
country and this was so much lost to SouthBritainGive me leave
sir said he to assure you that in your fact you are mistaken and
in your deduction erroneous Not one in two hundred that leave Scotland
ever returns to settle in his own country and the few that do
return carry thither nothing that can possibly diminish the stock of
SouthBritain for none of their treasure stagnates in ScotlandThere
is a continual circulation like that of the blood in the human body
and England is the heart to which all the streams which it distributes
are refunded and returned nay in consequence of that luxury which our
connexion with England hath greatly encouraged if not introduced
all the produce of our lands and all the profits of our trade are
engrossed by the natives of SouthBritain for you will find that the
exchange between the two kingdoms is always against Scotland and
that she retains neither gold nor silver sufficient for her own
circulationThe Scots not content with their own manufactures and
produce which would very well answer all necessary occasions seem to
vie with each other in purchasing superfluities from England such as
broadcloth velvets stuffs silks lace furs jewels furniture of
all sorts sugar rum tea chocolate and coffee in a word not only
every mode of the most extravagant luxury but even many articles of
convenience which they might find as good and much cheaper in their
own country For all these particulars I conceive England may touch
about one million sterling ayearI dont pretend to make an exact
calculation perhaps it may be something less and perhaps a great
deal more The annual revenue arising from all the private estates of
Scotland cannot fall short of a million sterling and I should imagine
their trade will amount to as much moreI know the linen manufacture
alone returns near half a million exclusive of the homeconsumption
of that articleIf therefore NorthBritain pays a ballance of a
million annually to England I insist upon it that country is
more valuable to her in the way of commerce than any colony in her
possession over and above the other advantages which I have specified
therefore they are no friends either to England or to truth who
affect to depreciate the northern part of the united kingdom

I must own I was at first a little nettled to find myself schooled in
so many particularsThough I did not receive all his assertions
as gospel I was not prepared to refute them and I cannot help now
acquiescing in his remarks so far as to think that the contempt for
Scotland which prevails too much on this side the Tweed is founded on
prejudice and errorAfter some recollection Well captain said I
you have argued stoutly for the importance of your own country for my
part I have such a regard for our fellowsubjects of NorthBritain
that I shall be glad to see the day when your peasants can afford to
give all their oats to their cattle hogs and poultry and indulge
themselves with good wheaten loaves instead of such poor unpalatable
and inflammatory diet Here again I brought my self into a premunire
with the disputative Caledonian He said he hoped he should never see
the common people lifted out of that sphere for which they were intended
by nature and the course of things that they might have some reason to
complain of their bread if it were mixed like that of Norway with saw
dust and fishbones but that oatmeal was he apprehended as nourishing
and salutary as wheatflour and the Scots in general thought it at
least as savouryHe affirmed that a mouse which in the article of
selfpreservation might be supposed to act from infallible instinct
would always prefer oats to wheat as appeared from experience for in
a place where there was a parcel of each that animal has never begun
to feed upon the latter till all the oats were consumed for their
nutritive quality he appealed to the hale robust constitutions of
the people who lived chiefly upon oatmeal and instead of being
inflammatory he asserted that it was a cooling subacid balsamic and
mucilaginous insomuch that in all inflammatory distempers recourse
was had to watergruel and flummery made of oatmeal

At least said I give me leave to wish them such a degree of commerce
as may enable them to follow their own inclinationsHeaven forbid
cried this philosopher Woe be to that nation where the multitude is
at liberty to follow their own inclinations Commerce is undoubtedly
a blessing while restrained within its proper channels but a glut
of wealth brings along with it a glut of evils it brings false taste
false appetite false wants profusion venality contempt of order
engendering a spirit of licentiousness insolence and faction that
keeps the community in continual ferment and in time destroys all the
distinctions of civil society so that universal anarchy and uproar must
ensue Will any sensible man affirm that the national advantages of
opulence are to be sought on these terms No sure but I am one of
those who think that by proper regulations commerce may produce every
national benefit without the allay of such concomitant evils

So much for the dogmata of my friend Lismahago whom I describe the
more circumstantially as I firmly believe he will set up his rest in
Monmouthshire Yesterday while I was alone with him he asked in some
confusion if I should have any objection to the success of a gentleman
and a soldier provided he should be so fortunate as to engage my
sisters affection I answered without hesitation that my sister was
old enough to judge for herself and that I should be very far from
disapproving any resolution she might take in his favourHis eyes
sparkled at this declaration He declared he should think himself the
happiest man on earth to be connected with my family and that he should
never be weary of giving me proofs of his gratitude and attachment I
suppose Tabby and he are already agreed in which case we shall have
a wedding at Brambletonhall and you shall give away the brideIt is
the least thing you can do by way of atonement for your former cruelty

We have been at Buxton but as I did not much relish either the company
or the accommodations and had no occasion for the water we stayed but
two nights in the place




To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR WAT

Adventures begin to thicken as we advance to the southward Lismahago
has now professed himself the admirer of our aunt and carries on his
addresses under the sanction of her brothers approbation so that we
shall certainly have a wedding by Christmas I should be glad you was
present at the nuptials to help me throw the stocking and perform
other ceremonies peculiar to that occasionI am sure it will be
productive of some diversion and truly it would be worth your while
to come across the country on purpose to see two such original figures
in bed together with their laced night caps he the emblem of good
cheer and she the picture of good nature All this agreeable prospect
was clouded and had well nigh vanished entirely in consequence of
a late misunderstanding between the future brothersinlaw which
however is now happily removed

A few days ago my uncle and I going to visit a relation met with lord
Oxmington at his house who asked us to dine with him next day and we
accepted the invitationAccordingly leaving our women under the
care of captain Lismahago at the inn where we had lodged the preceding
night in a little town about a mile from his lordships dwelling we
went at the hour appointed and had a fashionable meal served up with
much ostentation to a company of about a dozen persons none of whom
he had ever seen beforeHis lordship is much more remarkable for his
pride and caprice than for his hospitality and understanding and
indeed it appeared that he considered his guests merely as objects to
shine upon so as to reflect the lustre of his own magnificenceThere
was much state but no courtesy and a great deal of compliment without
any conversationBefore the desert was removed our noble entertainer
proposed three general toasts then calling for a glass of wine and
bowing all round wished us a good afternoon This was the signal for
the company to break up and they obeyed it immediately all except our
squire who was greatly shocked at the manner of this dismissionHe
changed countenance bit his lip in silence but still kept his seat
so that his lordship found himself obliged to give us another hint by
saying he should be glad to see us another time There is no time like
the present cried Mr Bramble your lordship has not yet drank a
bumper to the best in Christendom Ill drink no more bumpers today
answered our landlord and I am sorry to see you have drank too
manyOrder the gentlemans carriage to the gateSo saying he rose
and retired abruptly our squire starting up at the same time laying
his hand upon his sword and eyeing him with a most ferocious aspect
The master having vanished in this manner our uncle bad one of the
servants to see what was to pay and the fellow answering This is no
inn I cry you mercy cried the other I perceive it is not if it
were the landlord would be more civil Theres a guinea however take
it and tell your lord that I shall not leave the country till I
have had the opportunity to thank him in person for his politeness and
hospitality

We then walked down stairs through a double range of lacqueys and
getting into the chaise proceeded homewards Perceiving the squire
much ruffled I ventured to disapprove of his resentment observing
that as lord Oxmington was well known to have his brain very ill
timbered a sensible man should rather laugh than be angry at his
ridiculous want of breedingMr Bramble took umbrage at my presuming to
be wiser than he upon this occasion and told me that as he had always
thought for himself in every occurrence in life he would still use the
same privilege with my good leave

When we returned to our inn he closeted Lismahago and having explained
his grievance desired that gentleman to go and demand satisfaction of
lord Oxmington in his nameThe lieutenant charged himself with this
commission and immediately set out a horseback for his lordships
house attended at his own request by my man Archy Macalpine who had
been used to military service and truly if Macalpine had been mounted
upon an ass this couple might have passed for the knight of La Mancha
and his squire Panza It was not till after some demur that Lismahago
obtained a private audience at which he formally defied his lordship to
single combat in the name of Mr Bramble and desired him to appoint
the time and place Lord Oxmington was so confounded at this unexpected
message that he could not for some time make any articulate reply
but stood staring at the lieutenant with manifest marks of perturbation
At length ringing a bell with great vehemence he exclaimed What
a commoner send a challenge to a peer of the realmPrivilege
privilegeHeres a person brings me a challenge from the Welshman that
dined at my tableAn impudent fellowMy wine is not yet out of his
head

The whole house was immediately in commotionMacalpine made a
soldierly retreat with two horses but the captain was suddenly
surrounded and disarmed by the footmen whom a French valet de chambre
headed in this exploit his sword was passed through a closestool and
his person through the horsepond In this plight he returned to
the inn half mad with his disgrace So violent was the rage of his
indignation that he mistook its objectHe wanted to quarrel with Mr
Bramble he said he had been dishonoured on his account and he looked
for reparation at his handsMy uncles back was up in a moment and he
desired him to explain his pretensionsEither compel lord Oxmington
to give me satisfaction cried he or give it me in your own person
The latter part of the alternative is the most easy and expeditious
replied the squire starting up if you are disposed for a walk Ill
attend you this moment

Here they were interrupted by Mrs Tabby who had overheard all that
passedShe now burst into the room and running betwixt them in great
agitation Is this your regard for me said she to the lieutenant to
seek the life of my brother Lismahago who seemed to grow cool as my
uncle grew hot assured her he had a very great respect for Mr Bramble
but he had still more for his own honour which had suffered pollution
but if that could be once purified he should have no further cause of
dissatisfaction The squire said he should have thought it incumbent
upon him to vindicate the lieutenants honour but as he had now carved
for himself he might swallow and digest it as well as he couldIn a
word what betwixt the mediation of Mrs Tabitha the recollection of
the captain who perceived he had gone too far and the remonstrances
of your humble servant who joined them at this juncture those two
originals were perfectly reconciled and then we proceeded to deliberate
upon the means of taking vengeance for the insults they had received
from the petulant peer for until that aim should be accomplished
Mr Bramble swore with great emphasis that he would not leave the inn
where we now lodged even if he should pass his Christmas on the spot

In consequence of our deliberations we next day in the forenoon
proceeded in a body to his lordships house all of us with our
servants including the coachman mounted ahorseback with our pistols
loaded and ready primedThus prepared for action we paraded solemnly
and slowly before his lordships gate which we passed three times in
such a manner that he could not but see us and suspect the cause
of our appearanceAfter dinner we returned and performed the same
cavalcade which was again repeated the morning following but we had no
occasion to persist in these manoeuvres About noon we were visited by
the gentleman at whose house we had first seen lord OxmingtonHe now
came to make apologies in the name of his lordship who declared he had
no intention to give offence to my uncle in practising what had been
always the custom of his house and that as for the indignities which
had been put upon the officer they were offered without his Lordships
knowledge at the instigation of his valet de chambreIf that be the
case said my uncle in a peremptory tone I shall be contented
with lord Oxmingtons personal excuses and I hope my friend will be
satisfied with his lordships turning that insolent rascal out of his
serviceSir cried Lismahago I must insist upon taking personal
vengeance for the personal injuries I have sustained

After some debate the affair was adjusted in this mannerHis
lordship meeting us at our friends house declared he was sorry for
what had happened and that he had no intention to give umbrageThe
valet de chambre asked pardon of the lieutenant upon his knees when
Lismahago to the astonishment of all present gave him a violent kick
on the face which laid him on his back exclaiming in a furious tone
Oui je te pardonne gens foutre

Such was the fortunate issue of this perilous adventure which
threatened abundance of vexation to our family for the squire is one
of those who will sacrifice both life and fortune rather than leave
what they conceive to be the least speck or blemish upon their honour
and reputation His lordship had no sooner pronounced his apology with
a very bad grace than he went away in some disorder and I dare say
he will never invite another Welchman to his table

We forthwith quitted the field of this atchievement in order to
prosecute our journey but we follow no determinate course We make
small deviations to see the remarkable towns villas and curiosities
on each side of our route so that we advance by slow steps towards the
borders of Monmouthshire but in the midst of these irregular motions
there is no abberration nor eccentricity in that affection with which I
am dear Wat


Yours always J MELFORD Sept 28




To Dr LEWIS

DEAR DICK

At what time of life may a man think himself exempted from the necessity
of sacrificing his repose to the punctilios of a contemptible world I
have been engaged in a ridiculous adventure which I shall recount at
meeting and this I hope will not be much longer delayed as we have
now performed almost all our visits and seen every thing that I think
has any right to retard us in our journey homewardsA few days ago
understanding by accident that my old friend Baynard was in the
country I would not pass so near his habitation without paying him a
visit though our correspondence had been interrupted for a long course
of years

I felt my self very sensibly affected by the idea of our past intimacy
as we approached the place where we had spent so many happy days
together but when we arrived at the house I could not recognize
any one of those objects which had been so deeply impressed upon my
remembranceThe tall oaks that shaded the avenue had been cut down
and the iron gates at the end of it removed together with the high wall
that surrounded the court yard The house itself which was formerly a
convent of Cistercian monks had a venerable appearance and along the
front that looked into the garden was a stone gallery which afforded
me many an agreeable walk when I was disposed to be contemplative Now
the old front is covered with a screen of modern architecture so that
all without is Grecian and all within Gothic As for the garden which
was well stocked with the best fruit which England could produce
there is not now the least vestage remaining of trees walls or
hedgesNothing appears but a naked circus of loose sand with a dry
bason and a leaden triton in the middle

You must know that Baynard at his fathers death had a clear estate
of fifteen hundred pounds ayear and was in other respects extremely
well qualified to make a respectable figure in the commonwealth
but what with some excesses of youth and the expence of a contested
election he in a few years found himself encumbered with a debt of ten
thousand pounds which he resolved to discharge by means of a prudent
marriage He accordingly married a miss Thomson whose fortune amounted
to double the sum that he owedShe was the daughter of a citizen who
had failed in trade but her fortune came by an uncle who died in the
EastIndiesHer own parents being dead she lived with a maiden aunt
who had superintended her education and in all appearance was well
enough qualified for the usual purposes of the married stateHer
virtues however stood rather upon a negative than a positive
foundationShe was neither proud insolent nor capricious nor given
to scandal nor addicted to gaming nor inclined to gallantry She could
read and write and dance and sing and play upon the harpsichord
and smatter French and take a hand at whist and ombre but even these
accomplishments she possessed by halvesShe excelled in nothing
Her conversation was flat her stile mean and her expression
embarrassedIn a word her character was totally insipid Her person
was not disagreeable but there was nothing graceful in her address nor
engaging in her manners and she was so ill qualified to do the honours
of the house that when she sat at the head of the table one was always
looking for the mistress of the family in some other place

Baynard had flattered himself that it would be no difficult matter
to mould such a subject after his own fashion and that she would
chearfully enter into his views which were wholly turned to domestic
happiness He proposed to reside always in the country of which he was
fond to a degree of enthusiasm to cultivate his estate which was very
improvable to enjoy the exercise of rural diversions to maintain an
intimacy of correspondence with some friends that were settled in
his neighbourhood to keep a comfortable house without suffering his
expence to exceed the limits of his income and to find pleasure and
employ merit for his wife in the management and avocations of her own
familyThis however was a visionary scheme which he never was able
to realize His wife was as ignorant as a newborn babe of everything
that related to the conduct of a family and she had no idea of a
countrylife Her understanding did not reach so far as to comprehend
the first principles of discretion and indeed if her capacity had
been better than it was her natural indolence would not have permitted
her to abandon a certain routine to which she had been habituated She
had not taste enough to relish any rational enjoyment but her ruling
passion was vanity not that species which arises from selfconceit
of superior accomplishments but that which is of a bastard and idiot
nature excited by shew and ostentation which implies not even the
least consciousness of any personal merit

The nuptial peal of noise and nonsense being rung out in all the usual
changes Mr Baynard thought it high time to make her acquainted with
the particulars of the plan which he had projectedHe told her that his
fortune though sufficient to afford all the comforts of life was not
ample enough to command all the superfluities of pomp and pageantry
which indeed were equally absurd and intolerableHe therefore hoped
she would have no objection to their leaving London in the spring when
he would take the opportunity to dismiss some unnecessary domestics
whom he had hired for the occasion of their marriageShe heard him in
silence and after some pause So said she I am to be buried in the
country He was so confounded at this reply that he could not speak
for some minutes at length he told her he was much mortified to find
he had proposed anything that was disagreeable to her ideasI am sure
added he I meant nothing more than to lay down a comfortable plan of
living within the bounds of our fortune which is but moderate Sir
said she you are the best judge of your own affairsMy fortune
I know does not exceed twenty thousand poundsYet even with that
pittance I might have had a husband who would not have begrudged me a
house in LondonGood God my dear cried poor Baynard in the
utmost agitation you dont think me so sordidI only hinted what I
thoughtBut I dont pretend to impose Yes sir resumed the lady
it is your prerogative to command and my duty to obey So saying she
burst into tears and retired to her chamber where she was joined by her
auntHe endeavoured to recollect himself and act with vigour of mind
on this occasion but was betrayed by the tenderness of his nature
which was the greatest defect of his constitution He found the aunt
in tears and the niece in a fit which held her the best part of eight
hours at the expiration of which she began to talk incoherently about
death and her dear husband who had sat by her all this time and now
pressed her hand to his lips in a transport of grief and penitence
for the offence he had givenFrom thence forward he carefully avoided
mentioning the country and they continued to be sucked deeper and
deeper into the vortex of extravagance and dissipation leading what
is called a fashionable life in townAbout the latter end of July
however Mrs Baynard in order to exhibit a proof of conjugal obedience
desired of her own accord that they might pay a visit to his country
house as there was no company left in London He would have excused
himself from this excursion which was no part of the oeconomical plan he
had proposed but she insisted upon making this sacrifice to his taste
and prejudices and away they went with such an equipage as astonished
the whole country All that remained of the season was engrossed by
receiving and returning visits in the neighbourhood and in
this intercourse it was discovered that sir John Chickwell had a
housesteward and one footman in livery more than the complement of
Mr Baynards household This remark was made by the aunt at table and
assented to by the husband who observed that sir John Chickwell might
very well afford to keep more servants than were found in the family
of a man who had not half his fortune Mrs Baynard ate no supper that
evening but was seized with a violent fit which completed her triumph
over the spirit of her consort The two supernumerary servants were
addedThe family plate was sold for old silver and a new service
procured fashionable furniture was provided and the whole house turned
topsy turvy

At their return to London in the beginning of winter he with a heavy
heart communicated these particulars to me in confidence Before his
marriage he had introduced me to the lady as his particular friend
and I now offered in that character to lay before her the necessity of
reforming her oeconomy if she had any regard to the interest of her own
family or complaisance for the inclinations of her husbandBut Baynard
declined my offer on the supposition that his wifes nerves were
too delicate to bear expostulation and that it would only serve to
overwhelm her with such distress as would make himself miserable

Baynard is a man of spirit and had she proved a termagant he would
have known how to deal with her but either by accident or instinct
she fastened upon the weak side of his soul and held it so fast that
he has been in subjection ever sinceI afterwards advised him to carry
her abroad to France or Italy where he might gratify her vanity for
half the expence it cost him in England and this advice he followed
accordingly She was agreeably flattered with the idea of seeing and
knowing foreign parts and foreign fashions of being presented to
sovereigns and living familiarly with princes She forthwith seized the
hint which I had thrown out on purpose and even pressed Mr Baynard to
hasten his departure so that in a few weeks they crossed the sea to
France with a moderate train still including the aunt who was
her bosom counsellor and abetted her in all her oppositions to her
husbands willSince that period I have had little or no opportunity
to renew our former correspondenceAll that I knew of his transactions
amounted to no more than that after an absence of two years they
returned so little improved in oeconomy that they launched out into
new oceans of extravagance which at length obliged him to mortgage his
estateBy this time she had bore him three children of which the last
only survives a puny boy of twelve or thirteen who will be ruined in
his education by the indulgence of his mother

As for Baynard neither his own good sense nor the dread of indigence
nor the consideration of his children has been of force sufficient to
stimulate him into the resolution of breaking at once the shameful spell
by which he seems enchantedWith a taste capable of the most refined
enjoyment a heart glowing with all the warmth of friendship and
humanity and a disposition strongly turned to the more rational
pleasures of a retired and country life he is hurried about in a
perpetual tumult amidst a mob of beings pleased with rattles baubles
and gewgaws so void of sense and distinction that even the most acute
philosopher would find it a very hard task to discover for what wise
purpose of providence they were createdFriendship is not to be found
nor can the amusements for which he sighs be enjoyed within the rotation
of absurdity to which he is doomed for life He has long resigned
all views of improving his fortune by management and attention to
the exercise of husbandry in which he delighted and as to domestic
happiness not the least glimpse of hope remains to amuse his
imagination Thus blasted in all his prospects he could not fail to
be overwhelmed with melancholy and chagrin which have preyed upon his
health and spirits in such a manner that he is now threatened with a
consumption

I have given you a sketch of the man whom the other day I went to
visitAt the gate we found a great number of powdered lacquies but
no civilityAfter we had sat a considerable time in the coach we were
told that Mr Baynard had rode out and that his lady was dressing but
we were introduced to a parlour so very fine and delicate that in all
appearance it was designed to be seen only not inhabited The chairs
and couches were carved gilt and covered with rich damask so smooth
and slick that they looked as if they had never been sat upon There
was no carpet upon the floor but the boards were rubbed and waxed in
such a manner that we could not walk but were obliged to slide
along them and as for the stove it was too bright and polished to be
polluted with seacoal or stained by the smoke of any gross material
fireWhen we had remained above half an hour sacrificing to the
inhospitable powers in the temple of cold reception my friend Baynard
arrived and understanding we were in the house made his appearance so
meagre yellow and dejected that I really should not have known him
had I met with him in any other place Running up to me with great
eagerness he strained me in his embrace and his heart was so full
that for some minutes he could not speak Having saluted us all round
he perceived our uncomfortable situation and conducting us into another
apartment which had fire in the chimney called for chocolateThen
withdrawing he returned with a compliment from his wife and in the
mean time presented his son Harry a shambling bleareyed boy in the
habit of a hussar very rude forward and impertinent His father would
have sent him to a boardingschool but his mamma and aunt would not
hear of his lying out of the house so that there was a clergyman
engaged as his tutor in the family

As it was but just turned of twelve and the whole house was in
commotion to prepare a formal entertainment I foresaw it would be
late before we dined and proposed a walk to Mr Baynard that we might
converse together freely In the course of this perambulation when I
expressed some surprize that he had returned so soon from Italy he
gave me to understand that his going abroad had not at all answered the
purpose for which he left England that although the expence of living
was not so great in Italy as at home respect being had to the same rank
of life in both countries it had been found necessary for him to lift
himself above his usual stile that he might be on some footing with
the counts marquises and cavaliers with whom he kept companyHe was
obliged to hire a great number of servants to take off a great variety
of rich cloaths and to keep a sumptuous table for the fashionable
scorocconi of the country who without a consideration of this kind
would not have payed any attention to an untitled foreigner let his
family or fortune be ever so respectableBesides Mrs Baynard was
continually surrounded by a train of expensive loungers under the
denominations of languagemasters musicians painters and ciceroni
and had actually fallen into the disease of buying pictures and antiques
upon her own judgment which was far from being infallibleAt length
she met with an affront which gave her disgust to Italy and drove her
back to England with some precipitation By means of frequenting the
dutchess of Bedfords conversazione while her grace was at Rome Mrs
Baynard became acquainted with all the fashionable people of that city
and was admitted to their assemblies without scrupleThus favoured she
conceived too great an idea of her own importance and when the dutchess
left Rome resolved to have a conversazione that should leave the
Romans no room to regret her graces departure She provided hands for a
musical entertainment and sent biglietti of invitation to every person
of distinction but not one Roman of the female sex appeared at her
assemblyShe was that night seized with a violent fit and kept her
bed three days at the expiration of which she declared that the air of
Italy would be the ruin of her constitution In order to prevent this
catastrophe she was speedily removed to Geneva from whence they
returned to England by the way of Lyons and Paris By the time they
arrived at Calais she had purchased such a quantity of silks stuffs
and laces that it was necessary to hire a vessel to smuggle them over
and this vessel was taken by a customhouse cutter so that they lost
the whole cargo which had cost them above eight hundred pounds

It now appears that her travels had produced no effect upon her but
that of making her more expensive and fantastic than ever She affected
to lead the fashion not only in point of female dress but in every
article of taste and connoisseurship She made a drawing of the new
facade to the house in the country she pulled up the trees and pulled
down the walls of the garden so as to let in the easterly wind which
Mr Baynards ancestors had been at great pains to exclude To shew her
taste in laying out ground she seized into her own hand a farm of two
hundred acres about a mile from the house which she parcelled out into
walks and shrubberies having a great bason in the middle into which
she poured a whole stream that turned two mills and afforded the best
trout in the country The bottom of the bason however was so ill
secured that it would not hold the water which strained through the
earth and made a bog of the whole plantation in a word the ground
which formerly payed him one hundred and fifty pounds a year now cost
him two hundred pounds a year to keep it in tolerable order over and
above the first expence of trees shrubs flowers turf and gravel
There was not an inch of garden ground left about the house nor a tree
that produced fruit of any kind nor did he raise a truss of hay or a
bushel of oats for his horses nor had he a single cow to afford milk
for his tea far less did he ever dream of feeding his own mutton
pigs and poultry every article of housekeeping even the most
inconsiderable was brought from the next market town at the distance
of five miles and thither they sent a courier every morning to fetch
hot rolls for breakfast In short Baynard fairly owned that he spent
double his income and that in a few years he should be obliged to sell
his estate for the payment of his creditors He said that his wife had
such delicate nerves and such imbecility of spirit that she could
neither bear remonstrance be it ever so gentle nor practise any scheme
of retrenchment even if she perceived the necessity of such a measure
He had therefore ceased struggling against the stream and endeavoured
to reconcile himself to ruin by reflecting that his child at least
would inherit his mothers fortune which was secured to him by the
contract of marriage

The detail which he gave me of his affairs filled me at once with grief
and indignation I inveighed bitterly against the indiscretion of his
wife and reproached him with his unmanly acquiescence under the absurd
tyranny which she exerted I exhorted him to recollect his resolution
and make one effectual effort to disengage himself from a thraldom
equally shameful and pernicious I offered him all the assistance in my
power I undertook to regulate his affairs and even to bring about a
reformation in his family if he would only authorise me to execute the
plan I should form for his advantage I was so affected by the subject
that I could not help mingling tears with my remonstrances and Baynard
was so penetrated with these marks of my affection that he lost all
power of utterance He pressed me to his breast with great emotion and
wept in silence At length he exclaimed Friendship is undoubtedly the
most precious balm of life Your words dear Bramble have in a great
measure recalled me from an abyss of despondence in which I have
been long overwhelmed I will upon honour make you acquainted with
a distinct state of my affairs and as far as I am able to go will
follow the course you prescribe But there are certain lengths which my
natureThe truth is there are tender connexions of which a batchelor
has no ideaShall I own my weakness I cannot bear the thoughts of
making that woman uneasyAnd yet cried I she has seen you unhappy
for a series of yearsunhappy from her misconduct without ever shewing
the least inclination to alleviate your distressNevertheless said
he I am persuaded she loves me with the most warm affection but these
are incongruities in the composition of the human mind which I hold to
be inexplicable

I was shocked at his infatuation and changed the subject after we had
agreed to maintain a close correspondence for the future He then gave
me to understand that he had two neighbours who like himself were
driven by their wives at full speed in the high road to bankruptcy and
ruin All the three husbands were of dispositions very different from
each other and according to this variation their consorts were
admirably suited to the purpose of keeping them all three in subjection
The views of the ladies were exactly the same They vied in grandeur
that is in ostentation with the wife of Sir Charles Chickwell who had
four times their fortune and she again piqued herself upon making an
equal figure with a neighbouring peeress whose revenue trebled her
own Here then was the fable of the frog and the ox realized in four
different instances within the same county one large fortune and
three moderate estates in a fair way of being burst by the inflation of
female vanity and in three of these instances three different forms of
female tyranny were exercised Mr Baynard was subjugated by practising
upon the tenderness of his nature Mr Milksan being of a timorous
disposition truckled to the insolence of a termagant Mr Sowerby who
was of a temper neither to be moved by fits nor driven by menaces
had the fortune to be fitted with a helpmate who assailed him with
the weapons of irony and satire sometimes sneering in the way of
compliment sometimes throwing out sarcastic comparisons implying
reproaches upon his want of taste spirit and generosity by which
means she stimulated his passions from one act of extravagance to
another just as the circumstances of her vanity required

All these three ladies have at this time the same number of horses
carriages and servants in and out of livery the same variety of dress
the same quantity of plate and china the like ornaments in furniture
and in their entertainments they endeavour to exceed one another in the
variety delicacy and expence of their dishes I believe it will be
found upon enquiry that nineteen out of twenty who are ruined by
extravagance fall a sacrifice to the ridiculous pride and vanity of
silly women whose parts are held in contempt by the very men whom they
pillage and enslave Thank heaven Dick that among all the follies
and weaknesses of human nature I have not yet fallen into that of
matrimony

After Baynard and I had discussed all these matters at leisure we
returned towards the house and met Jery with our two women who had
come forth to take the air as the lady of the mansion had not yet made
her appearance In short Mrs Baynard did not produce herself till
about a quarter of an hour before dinner was upon the table Then her
husband brought her into the parlour accompanied by her aunt and son
and she received us with a coldness of reserve sufficient to freeze the
very soul of hospitality Though she knew I had been the intimate friend
of her husband and had often seen me with him in London she shewed no
marks of recognition or regard when I addressed myself to her in the
most friendly terms of salutation She did not even express the common
compliment of I am glad to see you or I hope you have enjoyed your
health since we had the pleasure of seeing you or some such words of
course nor did she once open her mouth in the way of welcome to my
sister and my niece but sat in silence like a statue with an aspect of
insensibility Her aunt the model upon which she had been formed was
indeed the very essence of insipid formality but the boy was very pert
and impudent and prated without ceasing

At dinner the lady maintained the same ungracious indifference never
speaking but in whispers to her aunt and as to the repast it was made
up of a parcel of kickshaws contrived by a French cook without one
substantial article adapted to the satisfaction of an English appetite
The pottage was little better than bread soaked in dishwashings
lukewarm The ragouts looked as if they had been once eaten and half
digested the fricassees were involved in a nasty yellow poultice and
the rotis were scorched and stinking for the honour of the fumet The
desert consisted of faded fruit and iced froth a good emblem of our
landladys character the tablebeer was sour the water foul and the
wine vapid but there was a parade of plate and china and a powdered
lacquey stood behind every chair except those of the master and
mistress of the house who were served by two valets dressed like
gentlemen We dined in a large old Gothic parlour which was formerly
the hall It was now paved with marble and notwithstanding the fire
which had been kindled about an hour struck me with such a chill
sensation that when I entered it the teeth chattered in my jawsIn
short every thing was cold comfortless and disgusting except the
looks of my friend Baynard which declared the warmth of his affection
and humanity

After dinner we withdrew into another apartment where the boy began to
be impertinently troublesome to my niece Liddy He wanted a playfellow
forsooth and would have romped with her had she encouraged his
advancesHe was even so impudent as to snatch a kiss at which she
changed countenance and seemed uneasy and though his father checked
him for the rudeness of his behaviour he became so outrageous as to
thrust his hand in her bosom an insult to which she did not tamely
submit though one of the mildest creatures upon earth Her eyes
sparkling with resentment she started up and lent him such a box in
the ear as sent him staggering to the other side of the room

Miss Melford cried his father you have treated him with the utmost
proprietyI am only sorry that the impertinence of any child of mine
should have occasioned this exertion of your spirit which I cannot but
applaud and admire His wife was so far from assenting to the candour
of his apology that she rose from the table and taking her son by the
hand Come child said she your father cannot abide you So
saying she retired with this hopeful youth and was followed by her
gouvernante but neither the one nor the other deigned to take the least
notice of the company

Baynard was exceedingly disconcerted but I perceived his uneasiness was
tinctured with resentment and derived a good omen from this discovery
I ordered the horses to be put to the carriage and though he made
some efforts to detain us all night I insisted upon leaving the house
immediately but before I went away I took an opportunity of speaking
to him again in private I said every thing I could recollect to
animate his endeavours in shaking off those shameful trammels I made
no scruple to declare that his wife was unworthy of that tender
complaisance which he had shewn for her foibles that she was dead to
all the genuine sentiments of conjugal affection insensible of her
own honour and interest and seemingly destitute of common sense and
reflection I conjured him to remember what he owed to his fathers
house to his own reputation and to his family including even this
unreasonable woman herself who was driving on blindly to her own
destruction I advised him to form a plan for retrenching superfluous
expence and try to convince the aunt of the necessity for such
a reformation that she might gradually prepare her niece for its
execution and I exhorted him to turn that disagreeable piece of
formality out of the house if he should find her averse to his
proposal

Here he interrupted me with a sigh observing that such a step would
undoubtedly be fatal to Mrs BaynardI shall lose all patience cried
I to hear you talk so weaklyMrs Baynards fits will never hurt her
constitution I believe in my conscience they are all affected I am
sure she has no feeling for your distresses and when you are ruined
she will appear to have no feeling for her own Finally I took his
word and honour that he would make an effort such as I had advised
that he would form a plan of oeconomy and if he found it impracticable
without my assistance he would come to Bath in the winter where I
promised to give him the meeting and contribute all in my power to the
retrieval of his affairsWith this mutual engagement we parted and I
shall think myself supremely happy if by my means a worthy man whom
I love and esteem can be saved from misery disgrace and despair

I have only one friend more to visit in this part of the country but he
is of a complexion very different from that of Baynard You have heard
me mention Sir Thomas Bullford whom I knew in Italy He is now become
a country gentleman but being disabled by the gout from enjoying any
amusement abroad he entertains himself within doors by keeping open
house for all corners and playing upon the oddities and humours of his
company but he himself is generally the greatest original at his table
He is very goodhumoured talks much and laughs without ceasing I am
told that all the use he makes of his understanding at present is to
excite mirth by exhibiting his guests in ludicrous attitudes I know
not how far we may furnish him with entertainment of this kind but I am
resolved to beat up his quarters partly with a view to laugh with
the knight himself and partly to pay my respects to his lady a
goodnatured sensible woman with whom he lives upon very easy terms
although she has not had the good fortune to bring him an heir to his
estate

And now dear Dick I must tell you for your comfort that you are the
only man upon earth to whom I would presume to send such a longwinded
epistle which I could not find in my heart to curtail because the
subject interested the warmest passions of my heart neither will I make
any other apology to a correspondent who has been so long accustomed to
the impertinence of

MATT BRAMBLE Sept 30




To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart at Oxon

DEAR KNIGHT

I believe there is something mischievous in my disposition for nothing
diverts me so much as to see certain characters tormented with false
terrorsWe last night lodged at the house of Sir Thomas Bullford an
old friend of my uncle a jolly fellow of moderate intellects who in
spite of the gout which hath lamed him is resolved to be merry to the
last and mirth he has a particular knack in extracting from his guests
let their humour be ever so caustic or refractoryBesides our company
there was in the house a fatheaded justice of the peace called
Frogmore and a country practitioner in surgery who seemed to be our
landlords chief companion and confidantWe found the knight sitting
on a couch with his crutches by his side and his feet supported on
cushions but he received us with a hearty welcome and seemed greatly
rejoiced at our arrivalAfter tea we were entertained with a sonata
on the harpsichord by lady Bullford who sung and played to admiration
but Sir Thomas seemed to be a little asinine in the article of ears
though he affected to be in raptures and begged his wife to favour us
with an arietta of her own composingThis arietta however she no
sooner began to perform than he and the justice fell asleep but the
moment she ceased playing the knight waked snorting and exclaimed
O cara what dye think gentlemen Will you talk any more of your
Pargolesi and your CorelliAt the same time he thrust his tongue in
one cheek and leered with one eye at the doctor and me who sat on his
left hand He concluded the pantomime with a loud laugh which he could
command at all times extemporeNotwithstanding his disorder he did
not do penance at supper nor did he ever refuse his glass when the
toast went round but rather encouraged a quick circulation both by
precept and example

I soon perceived the doctor had made himself very necessary to the
baronetHe was the whetstone of his wit the butt of his satire and
his operator in certain experiments of humour which were occasionally
tried upon strangersJustice Frogmore was an excellent subject for
this species of philosophy sleek and corpulent solemn and shallow
he had studied Burn with uncommon application but he studied nothing
so much as the art of living that is eating wellThis fat buck had
often afforded good sport to our landlord and he was frequently started
with tolerable success in the course of this evening but the baronets
appetite for ridicule seemed to be chiefly excited by the appearance
address and conversation of Lismahago whom he attempted in all
different modes of exposition but he put me in mind of a contest that I
once saw betwixt a young hound and an old hedgehogThe dog turned him
over and over and bounced and barked and mumbled but as often as
he attempted to bite he felt a prickle in his jaws and recoiled in
manifest confusionThe captain when left to himself will not fail to
turn his ludicrous side to the company but if any man attempts to force
him into that attitude he becomes stubborn as a mule and unmanageable
as an elephant unbroke

Divers tolerable jokes were cracked upon the justice who eat a most
unconscionable supper and among other things a large plate of broiled
mushrooms which he had no sooner swallowed than the doctor observed
with great gravity that they were of the kind called champignons which
in some constitutions has a poisonous effectMr Frogmore startled at
this remark asked in some confusion why he had not been so kind as to
give him that notice soonerHe answered that he took it for granted
by his eating them so heartily that he was used to the dish but as he
seemed to be under some apprehension he prescribed a bumper of plague
water which the justice drank off immediately and retired to rest not
without marks of terror and disquiet

At midnight we were shewn to our different chambers and in half an
hour I was fast asleep in bed but about three oclock in the morning I
was waked with a dismal cry of Fire and starting up ran to the window
in my shirtThe night was dark and stormy and a number of people
halfdressed ran backwards and forwards thro the courtyard with links
and lanthorns seemingly in the utmost hurry and trepidationSlipping
on my cloaths in a twinkling I ran down stairs and upon enquiry
found the fire was confined to a backstair which led to a detached
apartment where Lismahago layBy this time the lieutenant was alarmed
by bawling at his window which was in the second story but he could
not find his cloaths in the dark and his roomdoor was locked on the
outsideThe servants called to him that the house had been robbed
that without all doubt the villains had taken away his cloaths
fastened the door and set the house on fire for the staircase was in
flamesIn this dilemma the poor lieutenant ran about the room naked
like a squirrel in a cage popping out his bead at the window between
whiles and imploring assistanceAt length the knight in person
was brought out in his chair attended by my uncle and all the family
including our aunt Tabitha who screamed and cried and tore her hair
as if she had been distractedSir Thomas had already ordered his people
to bring a long ladder which was applied to the captains window and
now he exhorted him earnestly to descendThere was no need of much
rhetoric to persuade Lismahago who forthwith made his exit by the
window roaring all the time to the people below to hold fast the
ladder

Notwithstanding the gravity of the occasion it was impossible to behold
this scene without being seized with an inclination to laugh The rueful
aspect of the lieutenant in his shirt with a quilted nightcap fastened
under his chin and his long lank limbs and posteriors exposed to the
wind made a very picturesque appearance when illumined by the links
and torches which the servants held up to light him in his descentAll
the company stood round the ladder except the knight who sat in his
chair exclaiming from time to time Lord have mercy upon ussave
the gentlemans lifemind your footing dear captain softlystand
fastclasp the ladder with both handstherewell done my dear
boyO bravoan old soldier for everbring a blanket bring a
warm blanket to comfort his poor carcasewarm the bed in the green
roomgive me your hand dear captainIm rejoiced to see thee safe
and sound with all my heart Lismahago was received at the foot of the
ladder by his inamorata who snatching a blanket from one of the maids
wrapped it about his body two menservants took him under the arms
and a female conducted him to the green room still accompanied by Mrs
Tabitha who saw him fairly put to bedDuring this whole transaction
he spoke not a syllable but looked exceeding grim sometimes at one
sometimes at another of the spectators who now adjourned in a body to
the parlour where we had supped every one surveying another with marks
of astonishment and curiosity

The knight being seated in an easy chair seized my uncle by the hand
and bursting into a long and loud laugh Matt cried he crown me with
oak or ivy or laurel or parsely or what you will and acknowledge
this to be a coup de maitre in the way of waggeryha ha haSuch a
camisciata scagliata beffata O che roba O what a subjectO what
caricaturaO for a Rosa a Rembrandt a SchalkenZooks Ill give a
hundred guineas to have it paintedwhat a fine descent from the cross
or ascent to the gallows what lights and shadowswhat a groupe below
what expression abovewhat an aspectdid you mind the aspect ha
ha haand the limbs and the muscles every toe denoted terror ha
ha hathen the blanket O what costume St Andrew St Lazarus St
Barrabasha ha ha After all then cried Mr Bramble very gravely
this was no more than a false alarmWe have been frightened out of our
beds and almost out of our senses for the jokes sake Ay and such
a joke cried our landlord such a farce such a denouement such a
catastrophe

Have a little patience replied our squire we are not yet come to
the catastrophe and pray God it may not turn out a tragedy instead of a
farceThe captain is one of those saturnine subjects who have no
idea of humourHe never laughs in his own person nor can he bear that
other people should laugh at his expence Besides if the subject
had been properly chosen the joke was too severe in all conscience
Sdeath cried the knight I could not have bated him an ace had
he been my own father and as for the subject such another does not
present itself once in half a century Here Mrs Tabitha interposing
and bridling up declared she did not see that Mr Lismahago was a
fitter subject for ridicule than the knight himself and that she was
very much afraid he would very soon find he had mistaken his manThe
baronet was a good deal disconcerted by his intimation saying that he
must be a Goth and a barbarian if he did not enter into the spirit of
such a happy and humourous contrivanceHe begged however that Mr
Bramble and his sister would bring him to reason and this request was
reinforced by lady Bullford who did not fail to read the baronet a
lecture upon his indiscretion which lecture he received with submission
on one side of his face and a leer upon the other

We now went to bed for the second time and before I got up my uncle
had visited Lismahago in the green room and used such arguments with
him that when we met in the parlour he seemed to be quite appeased
He received the knights apology with good grace and even professed
himself pleased at finding he had contributed to the diversion of the
companySir Thomas shook him by the hand laughing heartily and
then desired a pinch of snuff in token of perfect reconciliationThe
lieutenant putting his hand in his waistcoat pocket pulled out
instead of his own Scotch mull a very fine gold snuffbox which he no
sooner perceived than he said Here is a small mistake No mistake
at all cried the baronet a fair exchange is no robberyOblige me so
far captain as to let me keep your mull as a memorial Sir said the
lieutenant the mull is much at your service but this machine I can by
no means retainIt looks like compounding a sort of felony in the code
of honour Besides I dont know but there may be another joke in this
conveyance and I dont find myself disposed to be brought upon the
stage againI wont presume to make free with your pockets but I beg
you will put it up again with your own hand So saying with a certain
austerity of aspect he presented the snuffbox to the knight who
received it in some confusion and restored the mull which he would by
no means keep except on the terms of exchange

This transaction was like to give a grave cast to the conversation
when my uncle took notice that Mr Justice Frogmore had not made his
appearance either at the nightalarm or now at the general rendezvous
The baronet hearing Frogmore mentioned Odso cried he I had forgot
the justicePrythee doctor go and bring him out of his kennel
Then laughing till his sides were well shaken he said he would shew the
captain that he was not the only person of the drama exhibited for the
entertainment of the company As to the nightscene it could not affect
the justice who had been purposely lodged in the farther end of the
house remote from the noise and lulled with a dose of opium into the
bargain In a few minutes Mr Justice was led into the parlour in his
nightcap and loose morninggown rolling his head from side to side and
groaning piteously all the wayJesu neighbour Frogmore exclaimed
the baronet what is the matteryou look as if you was not a man
for this worldSet him down softly on the couchpoor gentlemenLord
have mercy upon usWhat makes him so pale and yellow and bloated
Oh Sir Thomas cried the justice I doubt tis all over with me
Those mushrooms I eat at your table have done my businessah oh
hey Now the Lord forbid said the otherwhat man have a good
heartHow does thy stomach feelhall

To this interrogation he made no reply but throwing aside his
nightgown discovered that his waistcoat would not meet upon his belly
by five good inches at least Heaven protect us all cried Sir Thomas
what a melancholy spectaclenever did I see a man so suddenly swelled
but when he was either just dead or just dyingDoctor canst thou
do nothing for this poor object I dont think the case is quite
desperate said the surgeon but I would advise Mr Frogmore to settle
his affairs with all expedition the parson may come and pray by him
while I prepare a glyster and an emetic draught The justice rolling
his languid eyes ejaculated with great fervency Lord have mercy upon
us Christ have mercy upon usThen he begged the surgeon in the
name of God to dispatchAs for my worldly affairs said he they
are all settled but one mortgage which must be left to my heirsbut
my poor soul my poor soul what will become of my poor soul miserable
sinner that I am Nay prythee my dear boy compose thyself resumed
the knight consider the mercy of heaven is infinite thou canst
not have any sins of a very deep dye on thy conscience or the devils
int Name not the devil exclaimed the terrified Frogmore I have
more sins to answer for than the world dreams ofAh friend I have
been slysly damnd slySend for the parson without loss of time and
put me to bed for I am posting to eternityHe was accordingly raised
from the couch and supported by two servants who led him back to his
room but before he quitted the parlour he intreated the good company
to assist him with their prayersHe added Take warning by me who
am suddenly cut off in my prime like a flower of the field and God
forgive you Sir Thomas for suffering such poisonous trash to be eaten
at your table

He was no sooner removed out of hearing than the baronet abandoned
himself to a violent fit of laughing in which he was joined by the
greatest part of the company but we could hardly prevent the good lady
from going to undeceive the patient by discovering that while he slept
his waistcoat had been straitened by the contrivance of the surgeon
and that the disorder in his stomach and bowels was occasioned by some
antimonial wine which he had taken over night under the denomination
of plaguewater She seemed to think that his apprehension might put an
end to his life the knight swore he was no such chicken but a
tough old rogue that would live long enough to plague all his
neighboursUpon enquiry we found his character did not intitle him to
much compassion or respect and therefore we let our landlords humour
take its courseA glyster was actually administered by an old woman
of the family who had been Sir Thomass nurse and the patient took
a draught made with oxymel of squills to forward the operation of the
antimonial wine which had been retarded by the opiate of the preceding
night He was visited by the vicar who read prayers and began to take
an account of the state of his soul when those medicines produced their
effect so that the parson was obliged to hold his nose while he poured
forth spiritual consolation from his mouth The same expedient was used
by the knight and me who with the doctor entered the chamber at this
juncture and found Frogmore enthroned on an easingchair under the
pressure of a double evacuation The short intervals betwixt every heave
he employed in crying for mercy confessing his sins or asking the
vicars opinion of his case and the vicar answered in a solemn
snuffling tone that heightened the ridicule of the scene The emetic
having done its office the doctor interfered and ordered the patient
to be put in bed again When he examined the egesta and felt his pulse
he declared that much of the virus was discharged and giving him a
composing draught assured him he had good hopes of his recoveryThis
welcome hint he received with the tears of joy in his eyes protesting
that if he should recover he would always think himself indebted for
his life to the great skill and tenderness of his doctor whose hand he
squeezed with great fervour and thus he was left to his repose

We were pressed to stay dinner that we might be witnesses of his
resuscitation but my uncle insisted upon our departing before noon
that we might reach this town before it should be darkIn the
meantime lady Bullford conducted us into the garden to see a fishpond
just finished which Mr Bramble censured as being too near the parlour
where the knight now sat by himself dozing in an elbowchair after the
fatigues of his morning atchievementIn this situation he reclined
with his feet wrapped in flannel and supported in a line with his body
when the door flying open with a violent shock lieutenant Lismahago
rushed into the room with horror in his looks exclaiming A mad dog
a mad dog and throwing up the window sash leaped into the gardenSir
Thomas waked by this tremendous exclamation started up and forgetting
his gout followed the lieutenants example by a kind of instinctive
impulse He not only bolted thro the window like an arrow from a bow
but ran up to his middle in the pond before he gave the least sign of
recollection Then the captain began to bawl Lord have mercy upon
uspray take care of the gentlemanfor Gods sake mind your
footing my dear boyget warm blanketscomfort his poor carcasewarm
the bed in the green room

Lady Bullford was thunderstruck at this phaenomenon and the rest of
the company gazed in silent astonishment while the servants hastened
to assist their master who suffered himself to be carried back into the
parlour without speaking a wordBeing instantly accommodated with dry
clothes and flannels comforted with a cordial and replaced in statu
quo one of the maids was ordered to chafe his lower extremities an
operation in consequence of which his senses seemed to return and his
good humour to reviveAs we had followed him into the room he looked
at every individual in his turn with a certain ludicrous expression in
his countenance but fixed his eyes in particular upon Lismahago who
presented him with a pinch of snuff and when he took it in silence
Sir Thomas Bullford said he I am much obliged to you for all your
favours and some of them I have endeavoured to repay in your own coin
Give me thy hand cried the baronet thou hast indeed payed me Scot
and lot and even left a balance in my hands for which in presence of
this company I promise to be accountableSo saying he laughed
very heartily and even seemed to enjoy the retaliation which had been
exacted at his own expence but lady Bullford looked very grave and in
all probability thought the lieutenant had carried his resentment too
far considering that her husband was valetudinarybut according
to the proverb he that will play at bowls must expect to meet with
rubbers I have seen a tame bear very diverting when properly managed
become a very dangerous wild beast when teized for the entertainment of
the spectatorsAs for Lismahago he seemed to think the fright and the
cold bath would have a good effect upon his patients constitution but
the doctor hinted some apprehension that the gouty matter might by such
a sudden shock be repelled from the extremities and thrown upon some of
the more vital parts of the machineI should be very sorry to see this
prognostic verified upon our facetious landlord who told Mrs Tabitha at
parting that he hoped she would remember him in the distribution of
the brides favours as he had taken so much pains to put the captains
parts and mettle to the proofAfter all I am afraid our squire
will appear to be the greatest sufferer by the baronets wit for his
constitution is by no means calculated for nightalarms He has yawned
and shivered all day and gone to bed without supper so that as we
have got into good quarters I imagine we shall make a halt tomorrow
in which case you will have at least one days respite from the
persecution of

theres nothing sartain in this worldWho would have thought that
mistriss after all the pains taken for the good of her prusias sole
would go for to throw away her poor body that she would cast the
heys of infection upon such a carryingcrow as Lashmihago as old
as Mathewsullin as dry as a red herring and as poor as a starved
veezel0 Molly hadst thou seen him come down the ladder in a shurt
so scanty that it could not kiver his nakednessThe young
squire called him Dunquickset but he looked for all the world like
CradocapMorgan the ould tinker that suffered at Abergany for
steeling of kettleThen hes a profane scuffle and as Mr Clinker
says no better than an impfiddle continually playing upon the pyebill
and the newburthI doubt he has as little manners as money for he
cant say a civil word much more make me a present of a pair of gloves
for goodwill but he looks as if he wanted to be very forewood and
familiar O that ever a gentlewoman of years and discretion should tare
her air and cry and disporridge herself for such a nubjack as the song
goes

I vow she would fain have a burd That bids such a price for an owl

but for sartain he must have dealt with some Scotch musician to bring
her to this passAs for me I put my trust in the Lord and I have got
a slice of witch elm sowed in the gathers of my under petticoat and
Mr Clinker assures me that by the new light of grease I may deify the
devil and all his worksBut I nose what I noseIf mistress should take

To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS at Gloucester

MY DEAR LETTY

This method of writing to you from time to time without any hopes of an
answer affords me I own some ease and satisfaction in the midst of
my disquiet as it in some degree lightens the burthen of affliction
but it is at best a very imperfect enjoyment of friendship because it
admits of no return of confidence and good counselI would give the
whole world to have your company for a single dayI am heartily
tired of this itinerant way of life I am quite dizzy with a perpetual
succession of objectsBesides it is impossible to travel such a
length of way without being exposed to inconveniencies dangers and
disagreeable accidents which prove very grievous to a poor creature of
weak nerves like me and make me pay very dear for the gratification of
my curiosity

Nature never intended me for the busy worldI long for repose and
solitude where I can enjoy that disinterested friendship which is not
to be found among crouds and indulge those pleasing reveries that shun
the hurry and tumult of fashionable societyUnexperienced as I am in
the commerce of life I have seen enough to give me a disgust to the
generality of those who carry it onThere is such malice treachery
and dissimulation even among professed friends and intimate companions
as cannot fail to strike a virtuous mind with horror and when Vice
quits the stage for a moment her place is immediately occupied by
Folly which is often too serious to excite any thing but compassion
Perhaps I ought to be silent on the foibles of my poor aunt but with
you my dear Willis I have no secrets and truly her weaknesses are
such as cannot be concealed Since the first moment we arrived at Bath
she has been employed constantly in spreading nets for the other sex
and at length she has caught a superannuated lieutenant who is in a
fair way to make her change her nameMy uncle and my brother seem to
have no objection to this extraordinary match which I make no doubt
will afford abundance of matter for conversation and mirth for my part
I am too sensible of my own weaknesses to be diverted with those of
other peopleAt present I have something at heart that employs my
whole attention and keeps my mind in the utmost terror and suspence

Yesterday in the forenoon as I stood with my brother at the parlour
window of an inn where we had lodged a person passed a horseback whom
gracious Heaven I instantly discovered to be Wilson He wore a white
ridingcoat with the cape buttoned up to his chin looking remarkably
pale and passed at a round trot without seeming to observe usIndeed
he could not see us for there was a blind that concealed us from the
view You may guess how I was affected at this apparition The light
forsook my eyes and I was seized with such a palpitation and trembling
that I could not stand I sat down upon a couch and strove to compose
myself that my brother might not perceive my agitation but it was
impossible to escape his prying eyesHe had observed the object that
alarmed me and doubtless knew him at the first glanceHe now looked
at me with a stern countenance then he ran out into the street to see
what road the unfortunate horseman had takenHe afterwards dispatched
his man for further intelligence and seemed to meditate some violent
design My uncle being out of order we remained another night at the
inn and all day long Jery acted the part of an indefatigable spy upon
my conductHe watched my very looks with such eagerness of attention
as if he would have penetrated into the utmost recesses of my
heartThis may be owing to his regard for my honour if it is not the
effect of his own pride but he is so hot and violent and unrelenting
that the sight of him alone throws me into a flutter and really it
will not be in my power to afford him any share of my affection if he
persists in persecuting me at this rate I am afraid he has formed some
scheme of vengeance which will make me completely wretched I am afraid
he suspects some collusion from this appearance of WilsonGood God
did he really appear or was it only a phantom a pale spectre to
apprise me of his death

O Letty what shall I dowhere shall I turn for advice and
consolation shall I implore the protection of my uncle who has been
always kind and compassionateThis must be my last resourceI dread
the thoughts of making him uneasy and would rather suffer a thousand
deaths than live the cause of dissension in the familyI cannot
conceive the meaning of Wilsons coming hitherperhaps it was in
quest of us in order to disclose his real name and situationbut
wherefore pass without staying to make the least enquiryMy dear
Willis I am lost in conjecture I have not closed an eye since I saw
himAll night long have I been tossed about from one imagination to
another The reflection finds no resting placeI have prayed and
sighed and wept plentifullyIf this terrible suspence continues much
longer I shall have another fit of illness and then the whole family
will be in confusionIf it was consistent with the wise purposes
of Providence would I were in my graveBut it is my duty to be
resignedMy dearest Letty excuse my weaknessexcuse these blotsmy
tears fall so fast that I cannot keep the paper dryyet I ought
to consider that I have as yet no cause to despair but I am such a
fainthearted timorous creature

Thank God my uncle is much better than he was yesterday He is resolved
to pursue our journey strait to WalesI hope we shall take Gloucester
in our waythat hope chears my poor heart I shall once more embrace my
best beloved Willis and pour all my griefs into her friendly bosom0
heaven is it possible that such happiness is reserved for

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR WATKIN

I yesterday met with an incident which I believe you will own to be very
surprisingAs I stood with Liddy at the window of the inn where we
had lodged who should pass by but Wilson ahorse backI could not be
mistaken in the person for I had a full view of him as he advanced I
plainly perceived by my sisters confusion that she recognized him at
the same time I was equally astonished and incensed at his appearance
which I could not but interpret into an insult or something worse I
ran out at the gate and seeing him turn the corner of the street I
dispatched my servant to observe his motions but the fellow was too
late to bring me that satisfaction He told me however that there was
an inn called the Red Lion at that end of the town where he supposed
the horseman had alighted but that he would not enquire without further
orders I sent him back immediately to know what strangers were in the
house and he returned with a report that there was one Mr Wilson lately
arrived In consequence of this information I charged him with a note
directed to that gentleman desiring him to meet me in half an hour in
a certain field at the towns end with a case of pistols in order
to decide the difference which could not be determined at our last
rencounter but I did not think proper to subscribe the billet My man
assured me he had delivered it into his own hand and that having read
it he declared he would wait upon the gentleman at the place and time
appointed

MAlpine being an old soldier and luckily sober at the time I
entrusted him with my secret I ordered him to be within call and
having given him a letter to be delivered to my uncle in case of
accident I repaired to the rendezvous which was an inclosed field at
a little distance from the highway I found my antagonist had already
taken his ground wrapped in a dark horsemans coat with a laced hat
flapped over his eyes but what was my astonishment when throwing off
this wrapper he appeared to be a person whom I had never seen before
He had one pistol stuck in a leather belt and another in his hand ready
for action and advancing a few steps called to know if I was readyI
answered No and desired a parley upon which he turned the muzzle
of his piece towards the earth then replaced it in his belt and met me
half wayWhen I assured him he was not the man I expected to meet he
said it might be so that he had received a slip of paper directed to Mr
Wilson requesting him to come hither and that as there was no other in
the place of that name he naturally concluded the note was intended
for him and him onlyI then gave him to understand that I had been
injured by a person who assumed that name which person I had actually
seen within the hour passing through the street on horseback that
hearing there was a Mr Wilson at the Red Lion I took it for granted he
was the man and in that belief had writ the billet and I expressed my
surprize that he who was a stranger to me and my concerns should give
me such a rendezvous without taking the trouble to demand a previous
explanation He replied that there was no other of his name in the
whole country that no such horseman had alighted at the Red Lion since
nine oclock when he arrivedthat having had the honour to serve his
majesty he thought he could not decently decline any invitation of
this kind from what quarter soever it might come and that if any
explanation was necessary it did not belong to him to demand it but
to the gentleman who summoned him into the field Vexed as I was at this
adventure I could not help admiring the coolness of this officer whose
open countenance prepossessed me in his favour He seemed to be turned
of forty wore his own short black hair which curled naturally about
his ears and was very plain in his apparelWhen I begged pardon for
the trouble I had given him he received my apology with great good
humourHe told me that he lived about ten miles off at a small
farmhouse which would afford me tolerable lodging if I would come
and take diversion of hunting with him for a few weeks in which case we
might perhaps find out the man who had given me offenceI thanked him
very sincerely for his courteous offer which I told him I was not at
liberty to accept at present on account of my being engaged in a
family party and so we parted with mutual professions of good will and
esteem

Now tell me dear knight what am I to make of this singular adventure
Am I to suppose that the horseman I saw was really a thing of flesh
and blood or a bubble that vanished into airor must I imagine Liddy
knows more of the matter than she chuses to discloseIf I thought
her capable of carrying on any clandestine correspondence with such a
fellow I should at once discard all tenderness and forget that she was
connected with me by the ties of bloodBut how is it possible that
a girl of her simplicity and inexperience should maintain such an
intercourse surrounded as she is with so many eyes destitute of all
opportunity and shifting quarters every day of her lifeBesides she
has solemnly promised NoI cant think the girl so baseso insensible
to the honour of her familyWhat disturbs me chiefly is the
impression which these occurrences seem to make upon her spiritsThese
are the symptoms from which I conclude that the rascal has still a hold
on her affection surely I have a right to call him a rascal and to
conclude that his designs are infamous But it shall be my fault if he
does not one day repent his presumptionI confess I cannot think much
less write on this subject with any degree of temper or patience I
shall therefore conclude with telling you that we hope to be in Wales
by the latter end of the month but before that period you will probably
hear again from

your affectionate J MELFORD Oct 4




To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart of Jesus college Oxon

DEAR PHILLIPS

When I wrote you by last post I did not imagine I should be tempted to
trouble you again so soon but I now sit down with a heart so full that
it cannot contain itself though I am under such agitation of spirits
that you are to expect neither method nor connexion in this addressWe
have been this day within a hairs breadth of losing honest Matthew
Bramble in consequence of a cursed accident which I will endeavour
to explainIn crossing the country to get into the post road it was
necessary to ford a river and we that were ahorseback passed without
any danger or difficulty but a great quantity of rain having fallen
last night and this morning there was such an accumulation of water
that a millhead gave way just as the coach was passing under it and
the flood rushed down with such impetuosity as first floated and then
fairly overturned the carriage in the middle of the streamLismahago
and I and the two servants alighting instantaneously ran into the
river to give all the assistance in our powerOur aunt Mrs Tabitha
who had the good fortune to be uppermost was already half way out of
the coach window when her lover approaching disengaged her entirely
but whether his foot slipt or the burthen was too great they fell
over head and ears in each others arms He endeavoured more than once
to get up and even to disentangle himself from her embrace but she
hung about his neck like a millstone no bad emblem of matrimony and
if my man had not proved a stanch auxiliary those two lovers would in
all probability have gone hand in hand to the shades belowFor my part
I was too much engaged to take any cognizance of their distressI
snatched out my sister by the hair of the head and dragging her to
the bank recollected that my uncle had not yet appearedRushing again
into the stream I met Clinker hauling ashore Mrs Jenkins who looked
like a mermaid with her hair dishevelled about her ears but when I
asked if his master was safe he forthwith shook her from him and
she must have gone to pot if a miller had not seasonably come to her
reliefAs for Humphry he flew like lightning to the coach that was
by this time filled with water and diving into it brought up the poor
squire to all appearance deprived of lifeIt is not in my power to
describe what I felt at this melancholy spectacleit was such an agony
as baffles all description The faithful Clinker taking him up in his
arms as if he had been an infant of six months carried him ashore
howling most piteously all the way and I followed him in a transport of
grief and consternationWhen he was laid upon the grass and turned from
side to side a great quantity of water ran out at his mouth then he
opened his eyes and fetched a deep sigh Clinker perceiving these signs
of life immediately tied up his arm with a garter and pulling out a
horsefleam let him blood in the farrier stileAt first a few drops
only issued from the orifice but the limb being chafed in a little
time the blood began to flow in a continued stream and he uttered some
incoherent words which were the most welcome sounds that ever saluted
my ear There was a country inn hard by the landlord of which had by
this time come with his people to give their assistanceThither my
uncle being carried was undressed and put to bed wrapped in warm
blankets but having been moved too soon he fainted away and once more
lay without sense or motion notwithstanding all the efforts of Clinker
and the landlord who bathed his temples with Hungary water and held a
smellingbottle to his nose As I had heard of the efficacy of salt in
such cases I ordered all that was in the house to be laid under his
head and body and whether this application had the desired effect
or nature of herself prevailed he in less than a quarter of an hour
began to breathe regularly and soon retrieved his recollection to the
unspeakable joy of all the bystanders As for Clinker his brain
seemed to be affectedHe laughed and wept and danced about in such
a distracted manner that the landlord very judiciously conveyed him out
of the room My uncle seeing me dropping wet comprehended the whole
of what had happened and asked if all the company was safeBeing
answered in the affirmative he insisted upon my putting on dry clothes
and having swallowed a little warm wine desired he might be left to
his repose Before I went to shift myself I inquired about the rest
of the familyI found Mrs Tabitha still delirious from her fright
discharging very copiously the water she had swallowed She was
supported by the captain distilling drops from his uncurled periwig so
lank and so dank that he looked like Father Thames without his sedges
embracing Isis while she cascaded in his urn Mrs Jenkins was present
also in a loose bed gown without either cap or handkerchief but she
seemed to be as little compos mentis as her mistress and acted so many
cross purposes in the course of her attendance that between the two
Lismahago had occasion for all his philosophy As for Liddy I thought
the poor girl would have actually lost her senses The good woman of the
house had shifted her linen and put her into bed but she was seized
with the idea that her uncle had perished and in this persuasion made a
dismal outcry nor did she pay the least regard to what I said when
I solemnly assured her he was safe Mr Bramble hearing the noise and
being informed of her apprehension desired she might be brought into
his chamber and she no sooner received this intimation than she ran
thither half naked with the wildest expression of eagerness in her
countenanceSeeing the squire sitting up in the bed she sprung
forwards and throwing her arms about his neck exclaimed in a most
pathetic tone Are youAre you indeed my uncleMy dear uncleMy
best friend My fatherAre you really living or is it an illusion of
my poor brain Honest Matthew was so much affected that he could not
help shedding tears while he kissed her forehead saying My dear
Liddy I hope I shall live long enough to shew how sensible I am of your
affectionBut your spirits are fluttered childYou want restGo
to bed and compose yourselfWell I will she replied but still
methinks this cannot be realThe coach was full of waterMy uncle
was under us allGracious GodYou was under waterHow did you get
outtell me that or I shall think this is all a deceptionIn what
manner I was brought out I know as little as you do my dear said
the squire and truly that is a circumstance of which I want to be
informed I would have given him a detail of the whole adventure but
he would not hear me until I should change my clothes so that I had
only time to tell him that he owed his life to the courage and fidelity
of Clinker and having given him this hint I conducted my sister to her
own chamber

This accident happened about three oclock in the afternoon and in
little more than an hour the hurricane was all over but as the carriage
was found to be so much damaged that it could not proceed without
considerable repairs a blacksmith and wheelwright were immediately sent
for to the next markettown and we congratulated ourselves upon being
housed at an inn which though remote from the postroad afforded
exceeding good lodging The women being pretty well composed and the
men all afoot my uncle sent for his servant and in the presence of
Lismahago and me accosted him in these wordsSo Clinker I find you
are resolved I shant die by waterAs you have fished me up from the
bottom at your own risque you are at least entitled to all the money
that was in my pocket and there it isSo saying he presented him
with a purse containing thirty guineas and a ring nearly of the same
valueGod forbid cried Clinker your honour shall excuse meI am
a poor fellow but I have a heart O if your honour did but know how
I rejoice to seeBlessed be his holy name that made me the humble
instrumentBut as for the lucre of gain I renounce itI have done no
more than my dutyNo more than I would have done for the most worthless
of my fellowcreaturesNo more than I would have done for captain
Lismahago or Archy Macalpine or any sinner upon earthBut for your
worship I would go through fire as well as waterI do believe it
Humphry said the squire but as you think it was your duty to save my
life at the hazard of your own I think it is mine to express the sense
I have of your extraordinary fidelity and attachmentI insist upon your
receiving this small token of my gratitude but dont imagine that I
look upon this as an adequate recompence for the service you have done
meI have determined to settle thirty pounds ayear upon you for life
and I desire these gentlemen will bear witness to this my intention of
which I have a memorandum in my pocketbook Lord make me thankful for
all these mercies cried Clinker sobbing I have been a poor bankrupt
from the beginningyour honours goodness found me when I wasnaked
when I wassick and forlornI understand your honours looksI would
not give offencebut my heart is very fulland if your worship wont
give me leave to speakI must vent it in prayers to heaven for my
benefactor When he quitted the room Lismahago said he should have
a much better opinion of his honesty if he did not whine and cant so
abominably but that he had always observed those weeping and praying
fellows were hypocrites at bottom Mr Bramble made no reply to this
sarcastic remark proceeding from the lieutenants resentment of Clinker
having in pure simplicity of heart ranked him with MAlpine and the
sinners of the earthThe landlord being called to receive some orders
about the beds told the squire that his house was very much at his
service but he was sure he should not have the honour to lodge him and
his company He gave us to understand that his master who lived hard
by would not suffer us to be at a public house when there was
accommodation for us at his own and that if he had not dined abroad in
the neighbourhood he would have undoubtedly come to offer his services
at our first arrival He then launched out in praise of that gentleman
whom he had served as butler representing him as a perfect miracle of
goodness and generosity He said he was a person of great learning and
allowed to be the best farmer in the countrythat he had a lady who
was as much beloved as himself and an only son a very hopeful young
gentleman just recovered from a dangerous fever which had like to have
proved fatal to the whole family for if the son had died he was sure
the parents would not have survived their lossHe had not yet
finished the encomium of Mr Dennison when this gentleman arrived in a
postchaise and his appearance seemed to justify all that had been said
in his favour He is pretty well advanced in years but hale robust
and florid with an ingenuous countenance expressive of good sense and
humanity Having condoled with us on the accident which had happened
he said he was come to conduct us to his habitation where we should be
less incommoded than at such a paultry inn and expressed his hope that
the ladies would not be the worse for going thither in his carriage as
the distance was not above a quarter of a mile My uncle having made a
proper return to this courteous exhibition eyed him attentively and
then asked if he had not been at Oxford a commoner of Queens college
When Mr Dennison answered Yes with some marks of surpriseLook
at me then said our squire and let us see if you can recollect
the features of an old friend whom you have not seen these forty
yearsThe gentleman taking him by the hand and gazing at him
earnestlyI protest cried he I do think I recall the idea
of Matthew Loyd of Glamorganshire who was student of Jesus Well
remembered my dear friend Charles Dennison exclaimed my uncle
pressing him to his breast I am that very identical Matthew Loyd of
Glamorgan Clinker who had just entered the room with some coals for
the fire no sooner heard these words than throwing down the scuttle
on the toes of Lismahago he began to caper as if he was mad
cryingMatthew Loyd of GlamorganO ProvidenceMatthew Loyd
of GlamorganThen clasping my uncles knees he went on in this
mannerYour worship must forgive meMatthew Loyd of GlamorganO
Lord Sir I cant contain myselfI shall lose my sensesNay
thou hast lost them already I believe said the squire peevishly
prithee Clinker be quietWhat is the matterHumphry fumbling in
his bosom pulled out an old wooden snuffbox which he presented in
great trepidation to his master who opening it immediately perceived
a small cornelian seal and two scraps of paperAt sight of these
articles he started and changed colour and casting his eye upon the
inscriptionsHahowwhat where cried he is the person here
named Clinker knocking his own breast could hardly pronounce
these wordsHereherehere is Matthew Loyd as the certificate
shewethHumphry Clinker was the name of the farrier that took me
prenticeAnd who gave you these tokens said my uncle hastilyMy
poor mother on her deathbedreplied the otherAnd who was your
mother Dorothy Twyford an please your honour heretofore barkeeper
at the Angel at ChippenhamAnd why were not these tokens produced
before My mother told me she had wrote to Glamorganshire at the
time of my birth but had no answer and that afterwards when she
made enquiry there was no such person in that county And so in
consequence of my changing my name and going abroad at that very time
thy poor mother and thou have been left to want and miseryI am really
shocked at the consequence of my own follyThen laying his hand
on Clinkers head he added Stand forth Matthew LoydYou see
gentlemen how the sins of my youth rise up in judgment against meHere
is my direction written with my own hand and a seal which I left at
the womans request and this is a certificate of the childs baptism
signed by the curate of the parish The company were not a little
surprised at this discovery upon which Mr Dennison facetiously
congratulated both the father and the son for my part I shook my
newfound cousin heartily by the hand and Lismahago complimented him
with the tears in his eyes for he had been hopping about the room
swearing in broad Scotch and bellowing with the pain occasioned by the
fall of the coalscuttle upon his foot He had even vowed to drive the
saul out of the body of that mad rascal but perceiving the unexpected
turn which things had taken he wished him joy of his good fortune
observing that it went very near his heart as he was like to be a great
toe out of pocket by the discoveryMr Dennison now desired to know
for what reason my uncle had changed the name by which he knew him at
Oxford and our squire satisfied him by answering to this effectI
took my mothers name which was Loyd as heir to her lands in
Glamorganshire but when I came of age I sold that property in order
to clear my paternal estate and resumed my real name so that I am now
Matthew Bramble of Brambletonhall in Monmouthshire at your service
and this is my nephew Jeremy Melford of Belfield in the county of
Glamorgan At that instant the ladies entering the room he presented
Mrs Tabitha as his sister and Liddy as his niece The old gentleman
saluted them very cordially and seemed struck with the appearance of my
sister whom he could not help surveying with a mixture of complacency
and surprizeSister said my uncle there is a poor relation that
recommends himself to your good gracesThe quondam Humphry Clinker is
metamorphosed into Matthew Loyd and claims the honour of being your
carnal kinsmanin short the rogue proves to be a crab of my own
planting in the days of hot blood and unrestrained libertinism Clinker
had by this time dropt upon one knee by the side of Mrs Tabitha
who eyeing him askance and flirting her fan with marks of agitation
thought proper after some conflict to hold out her hand for him to
kiss saying with a demure aspect Brother you have been very wicked
but I hope youll live to see the folly of your waysI am very sorry to
say the young man whom you have this day acknowledged has more
grace and religion by the gift of God than you with all your profane
learning and repeated opportunityI do think he has got the trick of
the eye and the tip of the nose of my uncle Loyd of Flluydwellyn and
as for the long chin it is the very moral of the governorsBrother
as you have changed his name pray change his dress also that livery
doth not become any person that hath got our blood in his veinsLiddy
seemed much pleased with this acquisition to the familyShe took him
by the hand declaring she should always be proud to own her connexion
with a virtuous young man who had given so many proofs of his gratitude
and affection to her uncleMrs Winifred Jenkins extremely fluttered
between her surprize at this discovery and the apprehension of losing
her sweetheart exclaimed in a giggling toneI wish you joy Mr
ClinkerFloydI would sayhi hi hiyoull be so proud you wont
look at your poor fellow servants oh oh oh Honest Clinker owned
he was overjoyed at his good fortune which was greater than he
deservedBut wherefore should I be proud said he a poor object
conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity nursed in a parish
workhouse and bred in a smithy Whenever I seem proud Mrs Jenkins I
beg of you to put me in mind of the condition I was in when I first saw
you between Chippenham and Marlborough

When this momentous affair was discussed to the satisfaction of all
parties concerned the weather being dry the ladies declined the
carriage so that we walked all together to Mr Dennisons house where
we found the tea ready prepared by his lady an amiable matron who
received us with all the benevolence of hospitality The house is old
fashioned and irregular but lodgeable and commodious To the south it
has the river in front at the distance of a hundred paces and on the
north there is a rising ground covered with an agreeable plantation
the greens and walks are kept in the nicest order and all is rural and
romantic I have not yet seen the young gentleman who is on a visit to
a friend in the neighbourhood from whose house he is not expected till
tomorrow

In the mean time as there is a man going to the next market town with
letters for the post I take this opportunity to send you the history of
this day which has been remarkably full of adventures and you will
own I give you them like a beefsteak at Dollys hot and hot without
ceremony and parade just as they come from the recollection of

Yours J MELFORD




To Dr LEWIS

DEAR DICK

Since the last trouble I gave you I have met with a variety of
incidents some of them of a singular nature which I reserve as a fund
for conversation but there are others so interesting that they will
not keep in petto till meeting

Know then it was a thousand pounds to a sixpence that you should now
be executing my will instead of perusing my letter Two days ago our
coach was overturned in the midst of a rapid river where my life was
saved with the utmost difficulty by the courage activity and
presence of mind of my servant Humphry ClinkerBut this is not the
most surprising circumstance of the adventureThe said Humphry Clinker
proves to be Matthew Loyd natural son of one Matthew Loyd of Glamorgan
if you know any such personYou see Doctor that notwithstanding all
your philosophy it is not without some reason that the Welchmen ascribe
such energy to the force of bloodBut we shall discuss this point on
some future occasion

This is not the only discovery which I made in consequence of our
disasterWe happened to be wrecked upon a friendly shoreThe lord
of the manor is no other than Charles Dennison our fellowrake at
OxfordWe are now happily housed with that gentleman who has really
attained to that pitch of rural felicity at which I have been aspiring
these twenty years in vain He is blessed with a consort whose
disposition is suited to his own in all respects tender generous and
benevolentShe moreover possesses an uncommon share of understanding
fortitude and discretion and is admirably qualified to be his
companion confidant counsellor and coadjutrix These excellent
persons have an only son about nineteen years of age just such a
youth as they could have wished that Heaven would bestow to fill up the
measure of their enjoymentIn a word they know no other allay to
their happiness but their apprehension and anxiety about the life and
concerns of this beloved object

Our old friend who had the misfortune to be a second brother was bred
to the law and even called to the bar but he did not find himself
qualified to shine in that province and had very little inclination for
his professionHe disobliged his father by marrying for love without
any consideration of fortune so that he had little or nothing to
depend upon for some years but his practice which afforded him a bare
subsistence and the prospect of an increasing family began to give
him disturbance and disquiet In the mean time his father dying was
succeeded by his elder brother a foxhunter and a sot who neglected
his affairs insulted and oppressed his servants and in a few years had
well nigh ruined the estate when he was happily carried off by a fever
the immediate consequence of a debauch Charles with the approbation of
his wife immediately determined to quit business and retire into the
country although this resolution was strenuously and zealously opposed
by every individual whom he consulted on the subject Those who had
tried the experiment assured him that he could not pretend to breathe
in the country for less than the double of what his estate produced
that in order to be upon the footing of a gentleman he would be
obliged to keep horses hounds carriages with a suitable number of
servants and maintain an elegant table for the entertainment of his
neighbours that farming was a mystery known only to those who had been
bred up to it from the cradle the success of it depending not only
upon skill and industry but also upon such attention and oeconomy as
no gentleman could be supposed to give or practise accordingly every
attempt made by gentlemen miscarried and not a few had been ruined by
their prosecution of agricultureNay they affirmed that he would find
it cheaper to buy hay and oats for his cattle and to go to market
for poultry eggs kitchen herbs and roots and every the most
inconsiderable article of housekeeping than to have those articles
produced on his own ground

These objections did not deter Mr Dennison because they were chiefly
founded on the supposition that he would be obliged to lead a life of
extravagance and dissipation which he and his consort equally detested
despised and determined to avoidThe objects he had in view were
health of body peace of mind and the private satisfaction of domestic
quiet unallayed by actual want and uninterrupted by the fears of
indigenceHe was very moderate in his estimate of the necessaries and
even of the comforts of lifeHe required nothing but wholesome air
pure water agreeable exercise plain diet convenient lodging and
decent apparel He reflected that if a peasant without education or
any great share of natural sagacity could maintain a large family and
even become opulent upon a farm for which he payed an annual rent of
two or three hundred pounds to the landlord surely he himself might
hope for some success from his industry having no rent to pay but
on the contrary three or four hundred pounds a year to receive He
considered that the earth was an indulgent mother that yielded her
fruits to all her children without distinction He had studied the
theory of agriculture with a degree of eagerness and delight and he
could not conceive there was any mystery in the practice but what he
should be able to disclose by dint of care and application With respect
to houshold expence he entered into a minute detail and investigation
by which he perceived the assertions of his friends were altogether
erroneousHe found he should save sixty pounds a year in the
single article of houserent and as much more in pocketmoney and
contingencies that even butchersmeat was twenty per cent cheaper in
the country than in London but that poultry and almost every other
circumstance of housekeeping might be had for less than onehalf of
what they cost in town besides a considerable saving on the side of
dress in being delivered from the oppressive imposition of ridiculous
modes invented by ignorance and adopted by folly

As to the danger of vying with the rich in pomp and equipage it never
gave him the least disturbance He was now turned of forty and having
lived half that time in the busy scenes of life was well skilled in the
science of mankind There cannot be in nature a more contemptible figure
than that of a man who with five hundred a year presumes to rival
in expence a neighbour who possesses five times that incomeHis
ostentation far from concealing serves only to discover his indigence
and render his vanity the more shocking for it attracts the eyes of
censure and excites the spirit of inquiry There is not a family in the
county nor a servant in his own house nor a farmer in the parish but
what knows the utmost farthing that his lands produce and all
these behold him with scorn or compassion I am surprised that these
reflections do not occur to persons in this unhappy dilemma and produce
a salutary effect but the truth is of all the passions incident
to human nature vanity is that which most effectually perverts the
faculties of the understanding nay it sometimes becomes so incredibly
depraved as to aspire at infamy and find pleasure in bearing the
stigmas of reproach

I have now given you a sketch of the character and situation of Mr
Dennison when he came down to take possession of this estate but as
the messenger who carries the letters to the next town is just setting
off I shall reserve what further I have to say on this subject till
the next post when you shall certainly hear from


Yours always MATT BRAMBLE Oct 8




To Dr LEWIS

Once more dear doctor I resume the pen for your amusement It was
on the morning after our arrival that walking out with my friend Mr
Dennison I could not help breaking forth into the warmest expressions
of applause at the beauty of the scene which is really inchanting and
I signified in particular how much I was pleased with the disposition
of some detached groves that afforded at once shelter and ornament to
his habitation

When I took possession of these lands about two and twenty years ago
said he there was not a tree standing within a mile of the house
except those of an old neglected orchard which produced nothing
but leaves and mossIt was in the gloomy month of November when I
arrived and found the house in such a condition that it might have
been justly stiled the tower of desolationThe courtyard was covered
with nettles and docks and the garden exhibited such a rank plantation
of weeds as I had never seen beforethe windowshutters were falling
in piecesthe sashes brokenand owls and jackdaws had taken
possession of the chimniesThe prospect within was still more
drearyAll was dark and damp and dirty beyond descriptionthe rain
penetrated in several parts of the roofin some apartments the very
floors had given waythe hangings were parted from the walls and
shaking in mouldy remnants the glasses were dropping out of their
framesthe familypictures were covered with dust and all the chairs
and tables wormeaten and crazyThere was not a bed in the house that
could be used except one oldfashioned machine with a high gilt tester
and fringed curtains of yellow mohair which had been for aught I know
two centuries in the familyIn short there was no furniture but the
utensils of the kitchen and the cellar afforded nothing but a few empty
butts and barrels that stunk so abominably that I would not suffer
any body to enter it until I had flashed a considerable quantity of
gunpowder to qualify the foul air within

An old cottager and his wife who were hired to lie in the house had
left it with precipitation alledging among other causes of retreat
that they could not sleep for frightful noises and that my poor
brother certainly walked after his deathIn a word the house appeared
uninhabitable the barn stable and outhouses were in ruins all the
fences broken down and the fields lying waste

The farmer who kept the key never dreamed I had any intention to live
upon the spotHe rented a farm of sixty pounds and his lease was just
expiringHe had formed a scheme of being appointed bailiff to the
estate and of converting the house and the adjacent grounds to his own
useA hint of his intention I received from the curate at my first
arrival I therefore did not pay much regard to what he said by way of
discouraging me from coming to settle in the country but I was a little
startled when he gave me warning that he should quit the farm at the
expiration of his lease unless I could abate considerably in the rent

At this period I accidentally became acquainted with a person whose
friendship laid the foundation of all my prosperity In the next
markettown I chanced to dine at an inn with a Mr Wilson who was lately
come to settle in the neighbourhoodHe had been lieutenant of a man of
war but quitted the sea in some disgust and married the only daughter
of farmer Bland who lives in this parish and has acquired a good
fortune in the way of husbandryWilson is one of the best natured
men I ever knew brave frank obliging and ingenuousHe liked my
conversation I was charmed with his liberal manner and acquaintance
immediately commenced and this was soon improved into a friendship
without reserveThere are characters which like similar particles of
matter strongly attract each otherHe forthwith introduced me to his
fatherinlaw farmer Bland who was well acquainted with every acre
of my estate of consequence well qualified to advise me on this
occasionFinding I was inclined to embrace a country life and even
to amuse myself with the occupation of farming he approved of my
designHe gave me to understand that all my farms were underlett that
the estate was capable of great improvement that there was plenty of
chalk in the neighbourhood and that my own ground produced excellent
marle for manureWith respect to the farm which was like to fall into
my hands he said he would willingly take it at the present rent but
at the same time owned that if I would expend two hundred pounds in
enclosure it would be worth more than double the sum

Thus encouraged I began the execution of my scheme without further
delay and plunged into a sea of expence though I had no fund in
reserve and the whole produce of the estate did not exceed three
hundred pounds a yearIn one week my house was made weathertight and
thoroughly cleansed from top to bottom then it was well ventilated by
throwing all the doors and windows open and making blazing fires of
wood in every chimney from the kitchen to the garrets The floors were
repaired the sashes new glazed and out of the old furniture of the
whole house I made shift to fit up a parlour and three chambers in
a plain yet decent mannerThe courtyard was cleared of weeds and
rubbish and my friend Wilson charged himself with the dressing of
the garden bricklayers were set at work upon the barn and stable and
labourers engaged to restore the fences and begin the work of
hedging and ditching under the direction of farmer Bland at whose
recommendation I hired a careful hind to lie in the house and keep
constant fires in the apartments

Having taken these measures I returned to London where I forthwith
sold off my householdfurniture and in three weeks from my first
visit brought my wife hither to keep her ChristmasConsidering the
gloomy season of the year the dreariness of the place and the decayed
aspect of our habitation I was afraid that her resolution would sink
under the sudden transition from a town life to such a melancholy state
of rustication but I was agreeably disappointedShe found the reality
less uncomfortable than the picture I had drawnBy this time indeed
things were mended in appearanceThe outhouses had risen out of their
ruins the pigeonhouse was rebuilt and replenished by Wilson who also
put my garden in decent order and provided a good stock of poultry
which made an agreeable figure in my yard and the house on the whole
looked like the habitation of human creaturesFarmer Bland spared me a
milch cow for my family and an ordinary saddlehorse for my servant to
go to market at the next townI hired a country lad for a footman the
hinds daughter was my housemaid and my wife had brought a cookmaid
from London

Such was my family when I began housekeeping in this place with three
hundred pounds in my pocket raised from the sale of my superfluous
furnitureI knew we should find occupation enough through the day to
employ our time but I dreaded the long winter evenings yet for those
too we found a remedy The curate who was a single man soon became so
naturalized to the family that he generally lay in the house and his
company was equally agreeable and useful He was a modest man a good
scholar and perfectly well qualified to instruct me in such country
matters as I wanted to knowMr Wilson brought his wife to see us and
she became so fond of Mrs Dennison that she said she was never so happy
as when she enjoyed the benefit of her conversationShe was then a
fine buxom country lass exceedingly docile and as goodnatured as her
husband Jack Wilson so that a friendship ensued among the women which
hath continued to this day

As for Jack he hath been my constant companion counsellor and
commissaryI would not for a hundred pounds you should leave my house
without seeing himJack is an universal geniushis talents are really
astonishingHe is an excellent carpenter joiner and turner and
a cunning artist in iron and brassHe not only superintended my
oeconomy but also presided over my pastimesHe taught me to brew
beer to make cyder perry mead usquebaugh and plaguewater to cook
several outlandish delicacies such as ollas pepperpots pillaws
corys chabobs and stufatasHe understands all manner of games from
chess down to chuckfarthing sings a good song plays upon the violin
and dances a hornpipe with surprising agilityHe and I walked and
rode and hunted and fished together without minding the vicissitudes
of the weather and I am persuaded that in a raw moist climate like
this of England continual exercise is as necessary as food to the
preservation of the individualIn the course of two and twenty
years there has not been one hours interruption or abatement in the
friendship subsisting between Wilsons family and mine and what is
a rare instance of good fortune that friendship is continued to our
childrenHis son and mine are nearly of the same age and the same
disposition they have been bred up together at the same school and
college and love each other with the warmest affection

By Wilsons means I likewise formed an acquaintance with a sensible
physician who lives in the next markettown and his sister an
agreeable old maiden passed the Christmas holidays at our house Mean
while I began my farming with great eagerness and that very winter
planted these groves that please you so muchAs for the neighbouring
gentry I had no trouble from that quarter during my first campaign
they were all gone to town before I settled in the country and by the
summer I had taken measures to defend myself from their attacksWhen a
gay equipage came to my gates I was never at home those who visited
me in a modest way I received and according to the remarks I made on
their characters and conversation either rejected their advances or
returned their civilityI was in general despised among the fashionable
company as a low fellow both in breeding and circumstances
nevertheless I found a few individuals of moderate fortune who gladly
adopted my stile of living and many others would have acceded to our
society had they not been prevented by the pride envy and ambition of
their wives and daughtersThose in times of luxury and dissipation
are the rocks upon which all the small estates in the country are
wrecked

I reserved in my own hands some acres of ground adjacent to the house
for making experiments in agriculture according to the directions of
Lyle Tull Hart Duhamel and others who have written on this subject
and qualified their theory with the practical observations of farmer
Bland who was my great master in the art of husbandryIn short I
became enamoured of a country life and my success greatly exceeded my
expectationI drained bogs burned heath grubbed up furze and fern
I planted copse and willows where nothing else would grow I gradually
inclosed all my farms and made such improvements that my estate now
yields me clear twelve hundred pounds a yearAll this time my wife
and I have enjoyed uninterrupted health and a regular flow of spirits
except on a very few occasions when our cheerfulness was invaded by
such accidents as are inseparable from the condition of life I lost
two children in their infancy by the smallpox so that I have one son
only in whom all our hopes are centeredHe went yesterday to visit
a friend with whom he has stayed all night but he will be here to
dinnerI shall this day have the pleasure of presenting him to you
and your family and I flatter myself you will find him not altogether
unworthy of our affection

The truth is either I am blinded by the partiality of a parent or
he is a boy of very amiable character and yet his conduct has given us
unspeakable disquietYou must know we had projected a match between
him and a gentlemans daughter in the next county who will in all
probability be heiress of a considerable fortune but it seems he had
a personal disgust to the alliance He was then at Cambridge and tried
to gain time on various pretences but being pressed in letters by his
mother and me to give a definitive answer he fairly gave his tutor the
slip and disappeared about eight months agoBefore he took this rash
step he wrote me a letter explaining his objections to the match
and declaring that he would keep himself concealed until he should
understand that his parents would dispense with his contracting an
engagement that must make him miserable for life and he prescribed
the form of advertising in a certain newspaper by which he might be
apprized of our sentiments on this subject

You may easily conceive how much we were alarmed and afflicted by this
elopement which he had made without dropping the least hint to his
companion Charles Wilson who belonged to the same collegeWe resolved
to punish him with the appearance of neglect in hopes that he would
return of his own accord but he maintained his purpose till the young
lady chose a partner for herself then he produced himself and made his
peace by the mediation of WilsonSuppose we should unite our families
by joining him with your niece who is one of the most lovely creatures
I ever beheldMy wife is already as fond of her as if she were her own
child and I have a presentiment that my son will be captivated by her
at first sight Nothing could be more agreeable to all our family
said I than such an alliance but my dear friend candour obliges
me to tell you that I am afraid Liddys heart is not wholly
disengagedthere is a cursed obstacleYou mean the young stroller
at Gloucester said heYou are surprised that I should know this
circumstance but you will be more surprised when I tell you that
stroller is no other than my son George DennisonThat was the character
he assumed in his eclipse I am indeed astonished and overjoyed
cried I and shall be happy beyond expression to see your proposal
take effect

He then gave me to understand that the young gentleman at his emerging
from concealment had disclosed his passion for Miss Melford the niece
of Mr Bramble of Monmouthshire Though Mr Dennison little dreamed that
this was his old friend Matthew Loyd he nevertheless furnished his son
with proper credentials and he had been at Bath London and many other
places in quest of us to make himself and his pretensions known

The bad success of his enquiry had such an effect upon his spirits that
immediately at his return he was seized with a dangerous fever which
overwhelmed his parents with terror and affliction but he was now
happily recovered though still weak and disconsolate My nephew joining
us in our walk I informed him of these circumstances with which he
was wonderfully pleased He declared he would promote the match to the
utmost of his power and that he longed to embrace young Mr Dennison as
his friend and brotherMean while the father went to desire his wife
to communicate this discovery gradually to Liddy that her delicate
nerves might not suffer too sudden a shock and I imparted the
particulars to my sister Tabby who expressed some surprize not
altogether unmixed I believe with an emotion of envy for though
she could have no objection to an alliance at once so honourable and
advantageous she hesitated in giving her consent on pretence of
the youth and inexperience of the parties at length however she
acquiesced in consequence of having consulted with captain Lismahago

Mr Dennison took care to be in the way when his son arrived at the gate
and without giving him time or opportunity to make any enquiry about
the strangers brought him up stairs to be presented to Mr Loyd and his
familyThe first person he saw when he entered the room was Liddy
who notwithstanding all her preparation stood trembling in the utmost
confusionAt sight of this object he was fixed motionless to the floor
and gazing at her with the utmost eagerness of astonishment exclaimed
Sacred heaven what is thisha wherefore Here his speech failing
he stood straining his eyes in the most emphatic silence George said
his father this is my friend Mr Loyd Roused at this intimation he
turned and received my salute when I said Young gentleman if you had
trusted me with your secret at our last meeting we should have parted
upon better terms Before he could make any answer Jery came round
and stood before him with open armsAt first he started and changed
colour but after a short pause he rushed into his embrace and they
hugged one another as if they had been intimate friends from their
infancy then he payed his respects to Mrs Tabitha and advancing to
Liddy Is it possible cried he that my senses do not play me false
that I see Miss Melford under my fathers roofthat I am permitted
to speak to her without giving offenceand that her relations have
honoured me with their countenance and protection Liddy blushed
and trembled and falteredTo be sure sir said she it is a very
surprising circumstancea greata providentialI really know not what
I saybut I beg you will think I have said whats agreeable

Mrs Dennison interposing said Compose yourselves my dear
childrenYour mutual happiness shall be our peculiar care The son
going up to his mother kissed one hand my niece bathed the other with
her tears and the good old lady pressed them both in their turns to
her breastThe lovers were too much affected to get rid of their
embarrassment for one day but the scene was much enlivened by the
arrival of Jack Wilson who brought as usual some game of his own
killingHis honest countenance was a good letter of recommendation I
received him like a dear friend after a long separation and I could
not help wondering to see him shake Jery by the hand as an old
acquaintanceThey had indeed been acquainted some days in
consequence of a diverting incident which I shall explain at meeting
That same night a consultation was held upon the concerns of the lovers
when the match was formally agreed to and all the marriage articles
were settled without the least disputeMy nephew and I promised to
make Liddys fortune five thousand pounds Mr Dennison declared he
would make over one half of his estate immediately to his son and
that his daughterinlaw should be secured in a jointure of four
hundredTabby proposed that considering their youth they should
undergo one year at least of probation before the indissoluble knot
should be tied but the young gentleman being very impatient and
importunate and the scheme implying that the young couple should live
in the house under the wings of his parents we resolved to make them
happy without further delay

As the law requires that the parties should be some weeks resident
in the parish we shall stay here till the ceremony is performedMr
Lismahago requests that he may take the benefit of the same occasion so
that next Sunday the banns will be published for all four togetherI
doubt I shall not be able to pass my Christmas with you at
BrambletonhallIndeed I am so agreeably situated in this place that
I have no desire to shift my quarters and I foresee that when the day
of separation comes there will be abundance of sorrow on all sidesIn
the mean time we must make the most of those blessings which Heaven
bestowsConsidering how you are tethered by your profession I cannot
hope to see you so far from home yet the distance does not exceed a
summerdays journey and Charles Dennison who desires to be remembered
to you would be rejoiced to see his old compotator but as I am now
stationary I expect regular answers to the epistles of

Yours invariably MATT BRAMBLE Oct 11




To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart at Oxon

DEAR WAT

Every day is now big with incident and discoveryYoung Mr Dennison
proves to be no other than that identical person whom I have execrated
so long under the name of WilsonHe had eloped from college at
Cambridge to avoid a match that he detested and acted in different
parts of the country as a stroller until the lady in question made
choice of a husband for herself then he returned to his father and
disclosed his passion for Liddy which met with the approbation of his
parents though the father little imagined that Mr Bramble was his old
companion Matthew Loyd The young gentleman being impowered to make
honourable proposals to my uncle and me had been in search of us all
over England without effect and he it was whom I had seen pass on
horseback by the window of the inn where I stood with my sister but
he little dreamed that we were in the houseAs for the real Mr Wilson
whom I called forth to combat by mistake he is the neighbour and
intimate friend of old Mr Dennison and this connexion had suggested to
the son the idea of taking that name while he remained in obscurity

You may easily conceive what pleasure I must have felt on discovering
that the honour of our family was in no danger from the conduct of a
sister whom I love with uncommon affection that instead of debasing
her sentiments and views to a wretched stroller she had really
captivated the heart of a gentleman her equal in rank and superior in
fortune and that as his parents approved of his attachment I was on
the eve of acquiring a brotherinlaw so worthy of my friendship and
esteem George Dennison is without all question one of the most
accomplished young fellows in England His person is at once elegant
and manly and his understanding highly cultivated Tho his spirit
is lofty his heart is kind and his manner so engaging as to command
veneration and love even from malice and indifference When I weigh
my own character with his I am ashamed to find myself so light in the
balance but the comparison excites no envyI propose him as a model
for imitationI have endeavoured to recommend myself to his friendship
and hope I have already found a place in his affection I am however
mortified to reflect what flagrant injustice we every day commit and
what absurd judgment we form in viewing objects through the falsifying
mediums of prejudice and passion Had you asked me a few days ago the
picture of Wilson the player I should have drawn a portrait very unlike
the real person and character of George Dennison Without all doubt the
greatest advantage acquired in travelling and perusing mankind in the
original is that of dispelling those shameful clouds that darken the
faculties of the mind preventing it from judging with candour and
precision

The real Wilson is a great original and the best tempered
companionable man I ever knewI question if ever he was angry or
lowspirited in his life He makes no pretensions to letters but he is
an adept in every thing else that can be either useful or entertaining
Among other qualifications he is a complete sportsman and counted the
best shot in the county He and Dennison and Lismahago and I attended
by Clinker went ashooting yesterday and made a great havock among the
partridgesTomorrow we shall take the field against the woodcocks and
snipes In the evening we dance and sing or play at commerce loo and
quadrille

Mr Dennison is an elegant poet and has written some detached pieces on
the subject of his passion for Liddy which must be very flattering
to the vanity of a young womanPerhaps he is one of the greatest
theatrical geniuses that ever appeared He sometimes entertains us with
reciting favourite speeches from our best plays We are resolved to
convert the great hall into a theatre and get up the Beaux Stratagem
without delayI think I shall make no contemptible figure in the
character of Scrub and Lismahago will be very great in Captain Gibbet
Wilson undertakes to entertain the country people with Harlequin
Skeleton for which he has got a jacket ready painted with his own hand

Our society is really enchanting Even the severity of Lismahago
relaxes and the vinegar of Mrs Tabby is remarkably dulcified ever
since it was agreed that she should take precedency of her niece in
being first noosed for you must know the day is fixed for Liddys
marriage and the banns for both couples have been already once
published in the parish church The Captain earnestly begged that
one trouble might serve for all and Tabitha assented with a vile
affectation of reluctance Her inamorato who came hither very slenderly
equipt has sent for his baggage to London which in all probability
will not arrive in time for the wedding but it is of no great
consequence as every thing is to be transacted with the utmost
privacyMeanwhile directions are given for making out the contracts
of marriage which are very favourable for both females Liddy will be
secured in a good jointure and her aunt will remain mistress of her own
fortune except one half of the interest which her husband shall have
a right to enjoy for his natural life I think this is as little in
conscience as can be done for a man who yokes with such a partner for
life

These expectants seem to be so happy that if Mr Dennison had an
agreeable daughter I believe I should be for making the third couple
in this country dance The humour seems to be infectious for Clinker
alias Loyd has a months mind to play the fool in the same fashion
with Mrs Winifred Jenkins He has even sounded me on the subject but I
have given him no encouragement to prosecute this schemeI told him
I thought he might do better as there was no engagement nor promise
subsisting that I did not know what designs my uncle might have formed
for his advantage but I was of opinion that he should not at present
run the risque of disobliging him by any premature application of this
natureHonest Humphry protested he would suffer death sooner than do or
say any thing that should give offence to the squire but he owned he
had a kindness for the young woman and had reason to think she
looked upon him with a favourable eye that he considered this mutual
manifestation of good will as an engagement understood which ought to
be binding to the conscience of an honest man and he hoped the squire
and I would be of the same opinion when we should be at leisure to
bestow any thought about the matterI believe he is in the right and
we shall find time to take his case into considerationYou see we are
fixed for some weeks at least and as you have had a long respite I
hope you will begin immediately to discharge the arrears due to

To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS at Gloucester

MY DEAR DEAR LETTY

Never did I sit down to write in such agitation as I now feelIn
the course of a few days we have met with a number of incidents so
wonderful and interesting that all my ideas are thrown into confusion
and perplexityYou must not expect either method or coherence in what
I am going to relatemy dearest Willis Since my last the aspect of
affairs is totally changedand so changed but I would fain give you
a regular detailIn passing a river about eight days ago our coach was
overturned and some of us narrowly escaped with lifeMy uncle had well
nigh perished O Heaven I cannot reflect upon that circumstance without
horrorI should have lost my best friend my father and protector but
for the resolution and activity of his servant Humphry Clinker whom
Providence really seems to have placed near him for the necessity of
this occasionI would not be thought superstitious but surely he
acted from a stronger impulse than common fidelity Was it not the
voice of nature that loudly called upon him to save the life of his
own father for 0 Letty it was discovered that Humphry Clinker was my
uncles natural son

Almost at the same instant a gentleman who came to offer us his
assistance and invite us to his house turned out to be a very old
friend of Mr BrambleHis name is Mr Dennison one of the worthiest men
living and his lady is a perfect saint upon earth They have an only
sonwho do you think is this only sonO LettyO gracious heaven
how my heart palpitates when I tell you that this only son of Mr
Dennisons is that very identical youth who under the name of Wilson
has made such ravage in my heartYes my dear friend Wilson and I are
now lodged in the same house and converse together freelyHis father
approves of his sentiments in my favour his mother loves me with all
the tenderness of a parent my uncle my aunt and my brother no longer
oppose my inclinationsOn the contrary they have agreed to make us
happy without delay and in three weeks or a month if no unforeseen
accident intervenes your friend Lydia Melford will have changed her
name and conditionI say if no accident intervenes because such a
torrent of success makes me trembleI wish there may not be something
treacherous in this sudden reconciliation of fortuneI have no meritI
have no title to such felicity Far from enjoying the prospect that
lies before me my mind is harrassed with a continued tumult made up of
hopes and wishes doubts and apprehensionsI can neither eat nor sleep
and my spirits are in perpetual flutterI more than ever feel that
vacancy in my heart which your presence alone can fillThe mind in
every disquiet seeks to repose itself on the bosom of a friend and
this is such a trial as I really know not how to support without your
company and counselI must therefore dear Letty put your friendship
to the testI must beg you will come and do the last offices of
maidenhood to your companion Lydia Melford

This letter goes inclosed in one to our worthy governess from Mrs
Dennison entreating her to interpose with your mamma that you may be
allowed to favour us with your company on this occasion and I flatter
myself that no material objection can be made to our request The
distance from hence to Gloucester does not exceed one hundred miles
and the roads are goodMr Clinker alias Loyd shall be sent over to
attend your motionsIf you step into the postchaise with your maid
Betty Barker at seven in the morning you will arrive by four in the
afternoon at the halfway house where there is good accommodation
There you shall be met by my brother and myself who will next day
conduct you to this place where I am sure you will find yourself
perfectly at your case in the midst of an agreeable societyDear
Letty I will take no refusalif you have any friendshipany
humanityyou will comeI desire that immediate application may be
made to your mamma and that the moment her permission is obtained you
will apprise

To Mrs JERMYN at her house in Gloucester

DEAR MADAM

Though I was not so fortunate as to be favoured with an answer to the
letter with which I troubled you in the spring I still flatter myself
that you retain some regard for me and my concerns I am sure the care
and tenderness with which I was treated under your roof and tuition
demand the warmest returns of gratitude and affection on my part and
these sentiments I hope I shall cherish to my dying dayAt present
I think it my duty to make you acquainted with the happy issue of that
indiscretion by which I incurred your displeasureAh madam the
slighted Wilson is metamorphosed into George Dennison only son and heir
of a gentleman whose character is second to none in England as you may
understand upon inquiry My guardian my brother and I are now in his
house and an immediate union of the two families is to take place in
the persons of the young gentleman and your poor Lydia MelfordYou
will easily conceive how embarrassing this situation must be to a young
inexperienced creature like me of weak nerves and strong apprehensions
and how much the presence of a friend and confidant would encourage and
support me on this occasion You know that of all the young ladies
Miss Willis was she that possessed the greatest share of my confidence
and affection and therefore I fervently wish to have the happiness of
her company at this interesting crisis

Mrs Dennison who is the object of universal love and esteem has at
my request written to you on this subject and I now beg leave to
reinforce her sollicitationsMy dear Mrs Jermyn my ever honoured
governess let me conjure you by that fondness which once distinguished
your favourite Lydia by that benevolence of heart which disposes you
to promote the happiness of your fellowcreatures in general lend
a favourable ear to my petition and use your influence with Lettys
mamma that my most earnest desire may be gratified Should I be
indulged in this particular I will engage to return her safe and even
to accompany her to Gloucester where if you will give me leave I will
present to you under another name

O MARY JONES MARY JONES

To Dr LEWIS

DEAR DICK

You cannot imagine what pleasure I have in seeing your handwriting
after such a long cessation on your side of our correspondenceYet
Heaven knows I have often seen your handwriting with disgustI mean
when it appeared in abbreviations of apothecarys LatinI like your
hint of making interest for the reversion of the collectors place for
Mr Lismahago who is much pleased with the scheme and presents you
with his compliments and best thanks for thinking so kindly of his
concernsThe man seems to mend upon further acquaintance That harsh
reserve which formed a disagreeable husk about his character begins to
peel off in the course of our communicationI have great hopes that
he and Tabby will be as happily paired as any two draught animals in
the kingdom and I make no doubt but that he will prove a valuable
acquisition to our little society in the article of conversation by
the fireside in winter

Your objection to my passing this season of the year at such a distance
from home would have more weight if I did not find myself perfectly at
my ease where I am and my health so much improved that I am disposed
to bid defiance to gout and rheumatismI begin to think I have put
myself on the superannuated list too soon and absurdly sought
for health in the retreats of lazinessI am persuaded that all
valetudinarians are too sedentary too regular and too cautiousWe
should sometimes increase the motion of the machine to unclog the
wheels of life and now and then take a plunge amidst the waves of
excess in order to caseharden the constitution I have even found a
change of company as necessary as a change of air to promote a vigorous
circulation of the spirits which is the very essence and criterion of
good health

Since my last I have been performing the duties of friendship that
required a great deal of exercise from which I hope to derive some
benefitUnderstanding by the greatest accident in the world that
Mr Baynards wife was dangerously ill of a pleuritic fever I borrowed
Dennisons postchaise and went across the country to his habitation
attended only by Loyd quondam Clinker on horsebackAs the distance
is not above thirty miles I arrived about four in the afternoon and
meeting the physician at the door was informed that his patient had
just expiredI was instantly seized with a violent emotion but it
was not griefThe family being in confusion I ran up stairs into
the chamber where indeed they were all assembledThe aunt stood
wringing her hands in a kind of stupefaction of sorrow but my friend
acted all the extravagancies of afflictionHe held the body in his
arms and poured forth such a lamentation that one would have thought
he had lost the most amiable consort and valuable companion upon earth

Affection may certainly exist independent of esteem nay the same
object may be lovely in one respect and detestable in anotherThe mind
has a surprising faculty of accommodating and even attaching itself
in such a manner by dint of use to things that are in their own nature
disagreeable and even pernicious that it cannot bear to be delivered
from them without reluctance and regret Baynard was so absorbed in his
delirium that he did not perceive me when I entered and desired one of
the women to conduct the aunt into her own chamberAt the same time I
begged the tutor to withdraw the boy who stood gaping in a corner
very little affected with the distress of the sceneThese steps being
taken I waited till the first violence of my friends transport was
abated then disengaged him gently from the melancholy object and led
him by the hand into another apartment though he struggled so hard
that I was obliged to have recourse to the assistance of his valet de
chambreIn a few minutes however he recollected himself and folding
me in his arms This cried he is a friendly office indeedI know
not how you came hither but I think Heaven sent you to prevent my
going distractedO Matthew I have lost my dear Harrietmy poor
gentle tender creature that loved me with such warmth and purity of
affectionmy constant companion of twenty years Shes goneshes gone
for everHeaven and earth where is sheDeath shall not part us

So saying he started up and could hardly be withheld from returning
to the scene we had quittedYou will perceive it would have been very
absurd for me to argue with a man that talked so madlyOn all such
occasions the first torrent of passion must be allowed to subside
graduallyI endeavoured to beguile his attention by starting little
hints and insinuating other objects of discourse imperceptibly and
being exceedingly pleased in my own mind at this event I exerted
myself with such an extraordinary flow of spirits as was attended with
successIn a few hours he was calm enough to hear reason and even to
own that Heaven could not have interposed more effectually to rescue
him from disgrace and ruinThat he might not however relapse into
weaknesses for want of company I passed the night in his chamber in a
little tent bed brought thither on purpose and well it was I took
this precaution for he started up in bed several times and would have
played the fool if I had not been present

Next day he was in a condition to talk of business and vested me with
full authority over his household which I began to exercise without
loss of time tho not before he knew and approved of the scheme I
had projected for his advantageHe would have quitted the house
immediately but this retreat I opposedFar from encouraging a
temporary disgust which might degenerate into an habitual aversion
I resolved if possible to attach him more than ever to his Houshold
GodsI gave directions for the funeral to be as private as was
consistant with decency I wrote to London that an inventory and
estimate might be made of the furniture and effects in his townhouse
and gave notice to the landlord that Mr Baynard should quit the
premises at Ladyday I set a person at work to take account of every
thing in the countryhouse including horses carriages and harness I
settled the young gentleman at a boardingschool kept by a clergyman in
the neighbourhood and thither he went without reluctance as soon as
he knew that he was to be troubled no more with his tutor whom we
dismissed The aunt continued very sullen and never appeared at
table though Mr Baynard payed his respects to her every day in her
own chamber there also she held conferences with the waitingwomen and
other servants of the family but the moment her niece was interred
she went away in a postchaise prepared for that purpose she did not
leave the house however without giving Mr Baynard to understand that
the wardrobe of her niece was the perquisite of her woman accordingly
that worthless drab received all the clothes laces and linen of her
deceased mistress to the value of five hundred pounds at a moderate
computation

The next step I took was to disband that legion of supernumerary
domestics who had preyed so long upon the vitals of my friend a
parcel of idle drones so intolerably insolent that they even treated
their own master with the most contemptuous neglect They had been
generally hired by his wife according to the recommendation of her
woman and these were the only patrons to whom they payed the least
deference I had therefore uncommon satisfaction in clearing the house
of these vermin The woman of the deceased and a chambermaid a valet
de chambre a butler a French cook a master gardener two footmen and
a coachman I payed off and turned out of the house immediately paying
to each a months wages in lieu of warning Those whom I retained
consisted of the female cook who had been assistant to the Frenchman
a house maid an old lacquey a postilion and undergardener Thus I
removed at once a huge mountain of expence and care from the shoulders
of my friend who could hardly believe the evidence of his own senses
when he found himself so suddenly and so effectually relieved His
heart however was still subject to vibrations of tenderness
which returned at certain intervals extorting sighs and tears and
exclamations of grief and impatience but these fits grew every day
less violent and less frequent till at length his reason obtained a
complete victory over the infirmities of his nature

Upon an accurate enquiry into the state of his affairs I find his debts
amount to twenty thousand pounds for eighteen thousand pounds of which
sum his estate is mortgaged and as he pays five per cent interest and
some of his farms are unoccupied he does not receive above two hundred
pounds a year clear from his lands over and above the interest of
his wifes fortune which produced eight hundred pounds annually For
lightening this heavy burthen I devised the following expedient His
wifes jewels together with his superfluous plate and furniture in both
houses his horses and carriages which are already advertised to be
sold by auction will according to the estimate produce two thousand
five hundred pounds in ready money with which the debt will be
immediately reduced to eighteen thousand poundsI have undertaken to
find him ten thousand pounds at four per cent by which means he will
save one hundred ayear in the article of interest and perhaps we shall
be able to borrow the other eight thousand on the same terms According
to his own scheme of a country life he says he can live comfortably for
three hundred pounds ayear but as he has a son to educate we will
allow him five hundred then there will be an accumulating fund of seven
hundred ayear principal and interest to pay off the incumbrance
and I think we may modestly add three hundred on the presumption
of newleasing and improving the vacant farms so that in a couple of
years I suppose there will be above a thousand ayear appropriated to
liquidate a debt of sixteen thousand

We forthwith began to class and set apart the articles designed for
sale under the direction of an upholder from London and that nobody
in the house might be idle commenced our reformation without doors
as well as within With Baynards good leave I ordered the gardener to
turn the rivulet into its old channel to refresh the fainting Naiads
who had so long languished among mouldring roots withered leaves and
dry pebblesThe shrubbery is condemned to extirpation and the
pleasure ground will be restored to its original use of cornfield and
pastureOrders are given for rebuilding the walls of the garden at the
back of the house and for planting clumps of firs intermingled with
beech and chestnut at the east end which is now quite exposed to the
surly blasts that come from that quarter All these works being actually
begun and the house and auction left to the care and management of a
reputable attorney I brought Baynard along with me in the chaise and
made him acquainted with Dennison whose goodness of heart would not
fail to engage his esteem and affectionHe is indeed charmed with our
society in general and declares that he never saw the theory of true
pleasure reduced to practice before I really believe it would not be an
easy task to find such a number of individuals assembled under one roof
more happy than we are at present

I must tell you however in confidence I suspect Tabby of
tergiversationI have been so long accustomed to that original that
I know all the caprices of her heart and can often perceive her designs
while they are yet in embrioShe attached herself to Lismahago for no
other reason but that she despaired of making a more agreeable conquest
At present if I am not much mistaken in my observation she would
gladly convert the widowhood of Baynard to her own advantageSince
he arrived she has behaved very coldly to the captain and strove to
fasten on the others heart with the hooks of overstrained civility
These must be the instinctive efforts of her constitution rather than
the effects of any deliberate design for matters are carried to such a
length with the lieutenant that she could not retract with any regard
to conscience or reputation Besides she will meet with nothing but
indifference or aversion on the side of Baynard who has too much sense
to think of such a partner at any time and too much delicacy to admit a
thought of any such connexion at the present junctureMeanwhile I have
prevailed upon her to let him have four thousand pounds at four per cent
towards paying off his mortage Young Dennison has agreed that
Liddys fortune shall be appropriated to the same purpose on the same
termsHis father will sell out three thousand pounds stock for his
accommodationFarmer Bland has at the desire of Wilson undertaken
for two thousand and I must make an effort to advance what further will
be required to take my friend out of the hands of the Philistines He
is so pleased with the improvements made on his estate which is all
cultivated like a garden that he has entered himself as a pupil in
farming to Mr Dennison and resolved to attach himself wholly to the
practice of husbandry

Every thing is now prepared for our double wedding The
marriagearticles for both couples are drawn and executed and the
ceremony only waits until the parties shall have been resident in the
parish the term prescribed by law Young Dennison betrays some symptoms
of impatience but Lismahago bears this necessary delay with the temper
of a philosopherYou must know the captain does not stand altogether
on the foundation of personal merit Besides his halfpay amounting to
two and forty pounds a year this indefatigable oeconomist has amassed
eight hundred pounds which he has secured in the funds This sum arises
partly from his pays running up while he remained among the Indians
partly from what he received as a consideration for the difference
between his full appointment and the halfpay to which he is now
restricted and partly from the profits of a little traffick he drove in
peltry during his sachemship among the Miamis

Liddys fears and perplexities have been much assuaged by the company
of one Miss Willis who had been her intimate companion at the
boardingschool Her parents had been earnestly sollicited to allow her
making this friendly visit on such an extraordinary occasion and two
days ago she arrived with her mother who did not chuse that she should
come without a proper gouvernante The young lady is very sprightly
handsome and agreeable and the mother a mighty good sort of a woman
so that their coming adds considerably to our enjoyment But we shall
have a third couple yoked in the matrimonial chain Mr Clinker Loyd has
made humble remonstrance through the canal of my nephew setting forth
the sincere love and affection mutually subsisting between him and Mrs
Winifred Jenkins and praying my consent to their coming together for
life I would have wished that Mr Clinker had kept out of this scrape
but as the nymphs happiness is at stake and she has already some
fits in the way of despondence I in order to prevent any tragical
catastrophe have given him leave to play the fool in imitation of
his betters and I suppose we shall in time have a whole litter of his
progeny at Brambletonhall The fellow is stout and lusty very sober
and conscientious and the wench seems to be as great an enthusiast in
love as in religion

I wish you would think of employing him some other way that the
parish may not be overstockedyou know he has been bred a farrier
consequently belongs to the faculty and as he is very docile I make
no doubt but with your good instruction he may be in a little time
qualified to act as a Welch apothecary Tabby who never did a favour
with a good grace has consented with great reluctance to this match
Perhaps it hurts her pride as she now considers Clinker in the light of
a relation but I believe her objections are of a more selfish nature
She declares she cannot think of retaining the wife of Matthew Loyd in
the character of a servant and she foresees that on such an occasion
the woman will expect some gratification for her past services As for
Clinker exclusive of other considerations he is so trusty brave
affectionate and alert and I owe him such personal obligations that
he merits more than all the indulgence that can possibly be shewn him

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart at Oxon

DEAR KNIGHT

The fatal knots are now tied The comedy is near a close and the
curtain is ready to drop but the latter scenes of this act I shall
recapitulate in orderAbout a fortnight ago my uncle made an excursion
across the country and brought hither a particular friend one Mr
Baynard who has just lost his wife and was for some time disconsolate
though by all accounts he had much more cause for joy than for sorrow at
this eventHis countenance however clears up apace and he appears
to be a person of rare accomplishmentsBut we have received another
still more agreeable reinforcement to our company by the arrival
of Miss Willis from Gloucester She was Liddys bosom friend at the
boardingschool and being earnestly sollicited to assist at the
nuptials her mother was so obliging as to grant my sisters request
and even to come with her in person Liddy accompanied by George
Dennison and me gave them the meeting halfway and next day conducted
them hither in safety Miss Willis is a charming girl and in point of
disposition an agreeable contrast to my sister who is rather too grave
and sentimental for my turn of mind The other is gay frank a little
giddy and always goodhumoured She has moreover a genteel fortune
is well born and remarkably handsome Ah Phillips if these qualities
were permanentif her humour would never change nor her beauties
decay what efforts would I not makeBut these are idle reflectionsmy
destiny must one day be fulfilled

At present we pass the time as agreeably as we canWe have got up
several farces which afforded unspeakable entertainment by the effects
they produced among the country people who are admitted to all our
exhibitionsTwo nights ago Jack Wilson acquired great applause in
Harlequin Skeleton and Lismahago surprised us all in the character
of PierotHis long lank sides and strong marked features were all
peculiarly adapted to his partHe appeared with a ludicrous stare
from which he had discharged all meaning he adopted the impressions of
fear and amazement so naturally that many of the audience were infected
by his looks but when the skeleton held him in chace his horror
became most divertingly picturesque and seemed to endow him with such
praeternatural agility as confounded all the spectators It was a lively
representation of Death in pursuit of Consumption and had such an
effect upon the commonalty that some of them shrieked aloud and others
ran out of the hall in the utmost consternation

This is not the only instance in which the lieutenant has lately
excited our wonder His temper which had been soured and shrivelled
by disappointment and chagrin is now swelled out and smoothed like
a raisin in plumbporridge From being reserved and punctilious he is
become easy and obliging He cracks jokes laughs and banters with the
most facetious familiarity and in a word enters into all our schemes
of merriment and pastimeThe other day his baggage arrived in the
waggon from London contained in two large trunks and a long deal box
not unlike a coffin The trunks were filled with his wardrobe which
he displayed for the entertainment of the company and he freely owned
that it consisted chiefly of the opima spolia taken in battle What he
selected for his wedding suit was a tarnished white cloth faced with
blue velvet embroidered with silver but he valued himself most upon a
tyeperiwig in which he had made his first appearance as a lawyer above
thirty years ago This machine had been in buckle ever since and now
all the servants in the family were employed to frizz it out for the
occasion which was yesterday celebrated at the parish church George
Dennison and his bride were distinguished by nothing extraordinary
in their apparel His eyes lightened with eagerness and joy and she
trembled with coyness and confusion My uncle gave her away and her
friend Willis supported her during the ceremony

But my aunt and her paramour took the pas and formed indeed such a
pair of originals as I believe all England could not parallel She was
dressed in the stile of 1739 and the day being cold put on a
manteel of green velvet laced with gold but this was taken off by the
bridegroom who threw over her shoulders a fur cloak of American sables
valued at fourscore guineas a present equally agreeable and unexpected
Thus accoutred she was led up to the altar by Mr Dennison who did the
office of her father Lismahago advanced in the military step with
his French coat reaching no farther than the middle of his thigh his
campaign wig that surpasses all description and a languishing leer
upon his countenance in which there seemed to be something arch and
ironical The ring which he put upon her finger he had concealed
till the moment it was used He now produced it with an air of
selfcomplacency It was a curious antique set with rose diamonds he
told us afterwards it had been in the family two hundred years and was
a present from his grandmother These circumstances agreeably flattered
the pride of our aunt Tabitha which had already found uncommon
gratification in the captains generosity for he had in the morning
presented my uncle with a fine bears skin and a Spanish fowlingpiece
and me with a case of pistols curiously mounted with silver At the same
time he gave Mrs Jenkins an Indian purse made of silk grass containing
twenty crown pieces You must know this young lady with the assistance
of Mr Loyd formed the third couple who yesterday sacrificed to Hymen
I wrote to you in my last that he had recourse to my mediation which I
employed successfully with my uncle but Mrs Tabitha held out till the
lovesick Jenkins had two fits of the mother then she relented and
those two cooing turtles were caged for lifeOur aunt made an effort of
generosity in furnishing the bride with her superfluities of clothes and
linen and her example was followed by my sister nor did Mr Bramble
and I neglect her on this occasion It was indeed a day of
peaceofferingMr Dennison insisted upon Liddys accepting two bank
notes of one hundred pounds each as pocketmoney and his lady gave her
a diamond necklace of double that value There was besides a mutual
exchange of tokens among the individuals of the two families thus
happily united

As George Dennison and his partner were judged improper objects of
mirth Jack Wilson had resolved to execute some jokes on Lismahago and
after supper began to ply him with bumpers when the ladies had retired
but the captain perceiving his drift begged for quarter alledging that
the adventure in which he had engaged was a very serious matter and
that it would be more the part of a good Christian to pray that he
might be strengthened than to impede his endeavours to finish the
adventureHe was spared accordingly and permitted to ascend the
nuptial couch with all his senses about himThere he and his consort
sat in state like Saturn and Cybele while the benediction posset was
drank and a cake being broken over the head of Mrs Tabitha Lismahago
the fragments were distributed among the bystanders according to the
custom of the antient Britons on the supposition that every person who
eat of this hallowed cake should that night have a vision of the man or
woman whom Heaven designed should be his or her wedded mate

The weight of Wilsons waggery fell upon honest Humphry and his spouse
who were bedded in an upper room with the usual ceremony of throwing
the stockingThis being performed and the company withdrawn a sort
of catterwauling ensued when Jack found means to introduce a real cat
shod with walnutshells which galloping along the boards made such a
dreadful noise as effectually discomposed our loversWinifred screamed
aloud and shrunk under the bedcloathsMr Loyd believing that
Satan was come to buffet him in propria persona laid aside all carnal
thoughts and began to pray aloud with great fervencyAt length the
poor animal being more afraid than either leaped into the bed and
meauled with the most piteous exclamationLoyd thus informed of the
nature of the annoyance rose and set the door wide open so that this
troublesome visitant retreated with great expedition then securing
himself by means of a double bolt from a second intrusion he was left
to enjoy his good fortune without further disturbance

If one may judge from the looks of the parties they are all very well
satisfied with what has passedGeorge Dennison and his wife are
too delicate to exhibit any strong marked signs of their mutual
satisfaction but their eyes are sufficiently expressiveMrs Tabitha
Lismahago is rather fulsome in signifying her approbation of the
captains love while his deportment is the very pink of gallantryHe
sighs and ogles and languishes at this amiable object he kisses her
hand mutters ejaculations of rapture and sings tender airs and no
doubt laughs internally at her folly in believing him sincereIn
order to shew how little his vigour was impaired by the fatigues of the
preceding day he this morning danced a Highland sarabrand over a
naked backsword and leaped so high that I believe he would make no
contemptible figure as a vaulter at Sadlers WellsMr Matthew Loyd
when asked how he relished his bargain throws up his eyes crying
For what we have received Lord make us thankful amenHis helpmate
giggles and holds her hand before her eyes affecting to be ashamed
of having been in bed with a manThus all these widgeons enjoy the
novelty of their situation but perhaps their notes will be changed
when they are better acquainted with the nature of the decoy

As Mrs Willis cannot be persuaded to stay and Liddy is engaged by
promise to accompany her daughter back to Gloucester I fancy there will
be a general migration from hence and that most of us will spend the
Christmas holidays at Bath in which case I shall certainly find an
opportunity to beat up your quartersBy this time I suppose you
are sick of alma mater and even ready to execute that scheme of
peregrination which was last year concerted between you and

Your affectionate J MELFORD Nov 8




To Dr LEWIS

DEAR DOCTOR

My niece Liddy is now happily settled for life and captain Lismahago
has taken Tabby off my hands so that I have nothing further to do but
to comfort my friend Baynard and provide for my son Loyd who is also
fairly joined to Mrs Winifred Jenkins You are an excellent genius at
hintsDr Arbuthnot was but a type of Dr Lewis in that respect What
you observe of the vestryclerk deserves considerationI make no
doubt but Matthew Loyd is well enough qualified for the office but
at present you must find room for him in the houseHis incorruptible
honesty and indefatigable care will be serviceable in superintending
the oeconomy of my farm tho I dont mean that he shall interfere with
Barns of whom I have no cause to complainI am just returned with
Baynard from a second trip to his house where every thing is regulated
to his satisfactionHe could not however review the apartments
without tears and lamentation so that he is not yet in a condition to
be left alone therefore I will not part with him till the spring when
he intends to plunge into the avocations of husbandry which will at
once employ and amuse his attentionCharles Dennison has promised to
stay with him a fortnight to set him fairly afloat in his improvements
and Jack Wilson will see him from time to time besides he has a few
friends in the country whom his new plan of life will not exclude from
his societyIn less than a year I make no doubt but he will find
himself perfectly at ease both in his mind and body for the one had
dangerously affected the other and I shall enjoy the exquisite pleasure
of seeing my friend rescued from misery and contempt

Mrs Willis being determined to return with her daughter in a few
days to Gloucester our plan has undergone some alteration Jery has
persuaded his brotherinlaw to carry his wife to Bath and I believe
his parents will accompany him thitherFor my part I have no
intention to take that routeIt must be something very extraordinary
that will induce me to revisit either Bath or LondonMy sister and her
husband Baynard and I will take leave of them at Gloucester and make
the best of our way to Brambleton hall where I desire you will prepare
a good chine and turkey for our Christmas dinnerYou must also employ
your medical skill in defending me from the attacks of the gout that I
may be in good case to receive the rest of our company who promise
to visit us in their return from the BathAs I have laid in a
considerable stock of health it is to be hoped you will not have much
trouble with me in the way of physic but I intend to work you on
the side of exerciseI have got an excellent fowlingpiece from Mr
Lismahago who is a keen sportsman and we shall take the heath in
all weathersThat this scheme of life may be prosecuted the more
effectually I intend to renounce all sedentary amusements particularly
that of writing long letters a resolution which had I taken it
sooner might have saved you the trouble which you have lately taken in
reading the tedious epistles of

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
