CHAPTER I THE CALL OF SPRING

Well after all the country isnt such a bad place as some city folk
think

The young fellow who said this stood upon the highest point of the Ridge
Road where the land sloped abruptly to the valley in which lay the
small municipality of Crawberry on the one hand while on the other open
fields and patches of woodland in a huge greenandbrown checkerboard
pattern fell more easily to the bank of the distant river

Dotted here and there about the farming country lying before the youth
as he looked westward were cottages or the more importantlooking
homesteads on the larger farms and in the distance a white church spire
behind the trees marked the tiny settlement of Blaines Smithy

A Sabbath calm lay over the fields and woods It was midafternoon of
an early February Sundaythe time of the midwinter thaw that false
prophet of the real springtime

Although not a furrow had been turned as yet in the fields and the snow
lay deep in some fence corners and beneath the hedges there was after
all a smell of fresh eartha clean live smellthat Hiram Strong had
missed all week down in Crawberry

Im glad I came up here he muttered drawing in great breaths of
the clean air Just to look at the open fields without any brick and
mortar around makes a fellow feel fine

He stretched his arms above his head and standing alone there on the
upland felt bigger and better than he had in weeks

For Hiram Strong was a country boy born and bred and the town stifled
him Besides he had begun to see that his two years in Crawberry had
been wasted

As a hustler after fortune in the city I am not a howling success
mused Hiram Somehow Im cramped down yonder and he glanced back
at the squalid brick houses below him the smoky roofs and the ugly
factory chimneys

And I declare he pursued reflectively I dont believe I can stand
Old Dan Dwight much longer Dan Junior is bad enoughwhen he is
around the store but the boss would drive a fellow to death

He shook his head now turning from the pleasanter prospect of the
farming land and staring down into the town

Maybe Im not a success because I dont stick to one thing Ive had
six jobs in lessn two years Thats a bad record for a boy I believe
But there hasnt any of them suited me nor have I suited them

And Dwights Emporium beats em all finished Hiram shaking his head

He turned his back upon the town once more as though to wipe his
failure out of his memory Before him sloped a field of wheat and
clover

It had kept as green under the snow as though winter was an unknown
season Every cloverleaf sparkled and the leaves of wheat bristled like
tiny spears

Spring was on the way He could hear the call of it

Two years before Hiram had left the farm He had no immediate relatives
after his father died The latter had been a tenantfarmer only and
when his tools and stock and the few household chattels had been sold
to pay the debts that had accumulated during his last illness there was
very little money left for Hiram

There was nobody to say him nay when he packed his bag and started for
Crawberry which was the metropolis of his part of the country He had
set out boldly believing that he could get ahead faster and become
master of his own fortune more quickly in town than in the locality
where he was born

He was a rugged wellsetup youth of seventeen not overtall but
sturdy and able to do a mans work Indeed he had long done a mans
work before he left the farm

Hirams hands were calloused he shuffled a bit when walked and his
shoulders were just a little bowed from holding the plow handles since
he had been big enough to bridle his fathers old mare

Yes the work on the farm had been hardespecially for a growing boy
Many farm boys work under better conditions than Hiram had

Nevertheless after a two years trial of what the city has in store for
most country boys who cut loose from their old environment Hiram Strong
felt today as though he must get back to the land

Theres nothing for me in town Clerking in Dwights Emporium will
never get me anywhere he thought turning finally away from the open
country and starting down the steep hill

Why there are college boys working on our street cars herewaiting
for some better job to turn up What chance does a fellow stand whos
only got a country school education

And there isnt any clean fun for a fellow in Crawberryfun that
doesnt cost money And goodness knows I cant make more than enough to
pay Mrs Atterson and for my laundry and buy a new suit of overalls
and a pair of shoes occasionally

No sir concluded Hiram Theres nothing in it Not for a fellow
like me at any rate Id better be back on the farmand I wish I was
there now

He had been to church that morning but after the late dinner at his
boarding house had set out on this lonely walk Now he had nothing to
look forward to as he returned but the stuffy parlor of Mrs Attersons
boarding house the cold supper in the diningroom which was attended
in a desultory fashion by such of the boarders as were at home and then
a long dull evening in his room or bed after attending the evening
service at the church around the corner

Hiram even shrank from meeting the same faces at the boarding house
table hearing the same stale jokes or caustic remarks about Mrs
Attersons food from Fred Crackit and the young men boarders of his
class or the grumbling of Mr Peebles the dyspeptic invalid or the
inane monologue of Old Lem Camp

And Mrs Atterson herselfgood soul though she washad gotten on Hiram
Strongs nerves too With her heatblistered face nearsighted eyes
peering through beclouded spectacles and her gown buttoned up hurriedly
and with a gap here and there where a button was missing she was the
typically frowsy hurried naggedtodeath boarding house mistress

And as for Sister Mrs Attersons little slavey and
maidofallwork

Well Sisters the limit smiled Hiram as he turned into the street
with its rows of ugly brick houses on either hand I believe Fred
Crackit has got it right Mrs Atterson keeps Sister instead of a
catso therell be something to kick

The halfgrown girlnarrowchested round shouldered and sallowhad
been taken by Mrs Atterson from some charity institution Sister as
the boarders all called her for lack of any other cognomen would have
her yellow hair in four attenuated pigtails hanging down her back and
she would shuffle about the diningroom in a pair of Mrs Attersons old
shoes

By Jove there she is now exclaimed the startled youth

At the corner of the street several slices of the brick block had
been torn away and the lot cleared for the erection of some business
building Running across this open space with wild shrieks and spilling
the milk from the big pitcher she carriedmilk for the boarders tea
Hi knewcame Mrs Attersons maid

Behind her and driving her like a horse by the ever present pigtails
bounded a boy of about her own agea laughing yelling imp of a boy
whom Hiram knew very well

That Dan Dwight is the meanest little scamp at this end of the town
he said to himself

The noise the two made attracted only the idle curiosity of a few
people It was a locality where even on Sundays there was more or less
noise

Sister begged and screamed She feared she would spill the milk and told
Dan Junior so But he only drove her the harder yelling to her to
Get up and yanking as hard as he could on the braids

Here thats enough of that called Hiram stepping quickly toward the
two

For Sister had stopped exhausted and in tears

Be off with you commanded Hiram Youve plagued the girl enough

Mind your business HiramLoram returned Dan Junior grabbing at
Sisters hair again

Hiram caught the younger boy by the shoulder and whirled him around

You run along to Mrs Atterson Sister he said quietly No you
dont he added gripping Dan Junior more firmly Youll stop right
here

Lemme be Hi Strong bawled the other when he found he could not
easily jerk away Itll be the worse for you if you dont

Just you wait until the girl is home returned Hiram laughing It was
an easy matter for him to hold the writhing Dan Junior

Ill fix you for this squalled the boy Wait till I tell my father

You wouldnt dare tell your father the truth laughed Hi

Ill fix you repeated Dan Junior and suddenly aimed a vicious kick
at his captor

Had the kick landed where Dan Junior intendedunder His kneecapthe
latter certainly would have been fixed But the country youth was too
agile for him

He jumped aside dragged Dan Junior suddenly toward him and then gave
him a backward thrust which sent the lighter boy spinning

Now it had rained the day before and in a hollow beside the path was
a puddle several inches deep Dan Junior lost his balance staggered
back tripped over his own clumsy heels and splashed full length into
it

Oh oh he bawled managing to get well soaked before he scrambled
out Ill tell my father on you Hi Strong Youll catch it for this

Youd better run home before you catch cold said Hiram who could not
help laughing at the young rascals plight And let girls alone another
time

To himself he said Well the goodness knows I couldnt be much more
in bad odor with Mr Dwight than I am already But this escapade of his
precious son ought to about fix me as Dan Junior says

Whether I want to or not I reckon I will be looking for another job
in a very few days



CHAPTER II AT MRS ATTERSONS

When you came into Mother Attersons front hall the young men
boarders gave her that appellation in irony the ghosts of many ancient
boiled dinners met you withif you were sensitive and unused to the
odors of cheap boarding housesa certain shock

He was starting up the stairs on which the ragged carpet threatened to
send less agile persons than Mrs Attersons boarders headlong to
the bottom at every downward trip when the clang of the gong in the
diningroom announced the usual cold spread which the landlady thought
due to her household on the first day of the week

Hiram hesitated decided that he would skip the meal and started up
again But just then Fred Crackit lounged out of the parlor with Mr
Peebles following him Dyspeptic as he was Mr Peebles never missed a
meal himself and Crackit said

Come on HiLowJack Arent you coming down to the usual feast of
reason and flow of soul

Crackit thought he was a natural humorist and he had to keep up his
reputation at all times and seasons He was rather a dissipatedlooking
man of thirty years or so given to gay waistcoats and wonderfully knit
ties A brilliant as large as a hazelnutand which in some lights
really sparkled like a diamondadorned the tie he wore this evening

I dont believe I want any supper responded Hiram pleasantly

Whats the matter Got some inside information as to what Mother
Atterson has laid out for us Youre pretty thick with the old girl
Hi

Thats not a nice way to speak of her Mr Crackit said Hi in a low
voice

The other boardersthose who were in the housestraggled into the
basement diningroom one after the other and took their places at the
long table each in his customary manner

That diningroom at Mother Attersons never could have been a cheerful
place It was long and lowceiled and the paper on the walls was
a dingy red so old that the figure on it had retired into the
backgroundbeen absorbed by it so to speak

The two long dusty windows looked upon an area and were grilled half
way up by wroughtiron screens which too helped to shut out the light
of day

The long table was covered by a red figured table cloth The castors
at both ends and in the middle were the ugliestHiram was sureto be
found in all the city of Crawberry The crockery was of the coarsest
kind The knives and forks were antediluvian The napkins were as coarse
as huck towels

But Mrs Attersons foodconsidering the cost of provisions and the
charge she made for her tablewas very good Only it had become a habit
for certain of the boarders led by the jester Crackit to criticise
the viands

Sometimes they succeeded in making Mrs Atterson angry and sometimes
Hiram knew she wept alone in the diningroom after the harumscarum
thoughtless crowd had gone

Old Lem Campnobody save Hiram thought to put Mr before the old
gentlemans namesidled in and sat down beside the country boy as
usual He was a queer colorless sort of persona man who never looked
into the face of another if he could help it He would look all around
Hiram when he spoke to himat his shoulder his shirtfront his hands
even at his feet if they were visible but never at his face

And at the table he kept up a continual monologue It was difficult
sometimes for Hiram to know when he was being addressed and when poor
Mr Camp was merely talking to himself

Lets seewhere has Sister put my napkinOh here it isYouve been
for a walk have you young manNo thats not my napkin I didnt
spill any gravy at dinnerNice day out but rawGoodness me cant I
have a knife and forkWheres my knife and forkSister certainly has
forgotten my knife and forkOh Here they areYes a very nice day
indeed for this time of year

And so on It was quite immaterial to Mr Camp whether he got an answer
to his remarks to Hiram or not He went on muttering to himself all
through the meal sometimes commenting upon what the others said at the
tableand that quite shrewdly Hiram noticed but the other boarders
considered him a little cracked

Sister smiled sheepishly at Hiram as she passed the tea She drowned
his tea with milk and put in no less than four spoonfuls of sugar But
although the fluid was utterly spoiled for Hirams taste he drank it
with fortitude knowing that the girls generosity was the child of her
gratitude for both sugar and milk were articles very scantily supplied
at Mother Attersons table

The mistress herself did not appear Now that he was down here in the
diningroom Hiram lingered He hated the thought of going up to his
lonely and narrow quarters at the top of the house

The other boarders trailed out of the room and up stairs one after
another Old Lem Camp being the last to go Sister brought in a dish of
hot toast between two plates and set it at the upper end of the table
Then Mrs Atterson appeared

Hiram knew at once that something had gone wrong with the boarding
house mistress She had been crying and when a woman of the age of Mrs
Atterson indulges in tears her personal appearance is never improved

Oh that you Hi she drawled with a snuffle Did you get enough to
eat

Yes Mrs Atterson returned the youth starting to get up I have
had plenty

Im glad you did said the lady And youre easy side of most of
em Hiram Youre a real good boy

I reckon I get all I pay for Mrs Atterson said her youngest
boarder

Well there aint many of em would say that And they was awful
provokin this noon That roast of veal was just as good meat as I could
find in market and I dont know what any sensible party would want
better than that prune pie

Well I hope I wont have to keep a boarding house all my life Its a
thankless task An it ties a body down so

Heres my unclemy poor mothers only brother and about the only
relative Ive got in the worldheres Uncle Jeptha down with the grip
or suthin and goodness knows if hell ever get over it And I cant
leave to go and see him die peaceable

Does he live far from here asked Hiram politely although he had no
particular reason for being interested in Uncle Jeptha

He lives on a farm out Scoville way Hes lived there most all his
life He used to make a right good living offn that farm too but its
run down some now

The last time I was out there two years ago he was just keepin along
and thats all And now I expect hes dying without a chick or child
of his own by him and she burst out crying again the tears sprinkling
the square of toast into which she continued to bite

Of course it was ridiculous A middleaged woman weeping and eating
toast and drinking strong boiled tea is not a romantic picture But as
Hiram climbed to his room he wished with all his heart that he could
help Mrs Atterson

He wasnt the only person in the world who seemed to have got into
a wrong environmentlots of people didnt fit right into their
circumstances in life

Were square pegs in round holesthats what we are mused Hiram
Thats what I am I wish I was out of it I wish I was back on the
farm



CHAPTER III A DREARY DAY

Daniel Dwights Emporium the general store was called and it was in a
very populous part of the town of Crawberry Old Daniel was a driver he
seldom had clerks enough to handle his trade properly and nobody could
suit him As general helper and junior clerk Hiram Strong had remained
with the concern longer than any other boy Daniel had hired in years

When the early Monday morning rush was over and there was moments
breathing space Hiram went to the door to rearrange the trays of
vegetables which were his particular care Hiram had a knack of making
a bank of the most plebeian vegetable and salads look like the
displaywindow of a florist

Now the youth looked out upon a typical city street the dwellings
on either side being four and five story tenement houses occupied by
artisans and mechanics

A few quarreling children paddled sticks or sailed chip boats in the
gutters

Come on now Get a move on you Hi sounded the raucous voice of
Daniel Dwight the elder behind him in the store

Hiram went at his task with neither interest nor energy

All about him the houses and the street were grimy and depressing It
had been a gray and murky morning but overhead a patch of sky was as
blue as June He suddenly saw a flock of pigeons wheeling above the
tunnel of the street and the boys heart leaped at the sight

He longed for freedom He wished he could fly up up up above the
housetops and the streets like those feathered fowl

He knew he was stagnating here in this dingy store the deadly sameness
of his life chafed him sorely

Id take another job if I could find one he muttered stirring up the
bunches of yellowing radish leaves and trying to make them look fresh
And Old Daniel is likely to give me a chance to hunt a job pretty
suddenthe way he talks But if Dan Junior told him what happened
yesterday I wonder the old gentleman hasnt been after me with a sharp
stick

From somewhereout of the fardistant open country where it had been
breathing all night the quivering pines and brown swamps and the
white and gray checkered fields that would soon be upturned by the
plowsharesa vagrant wind wandered into the city street

The lingering but faint perfume wafted here from Gods open world to
die in this manmade town inspired in the youth thoughts and desires
that had been struggling within him for expression for days past

I know what I want said Hiram Strong aloud I want to get back to
the land

The progress of the day was not inducive to a hopeful outlook for
Hiram When closing time came he was heartily sick of the business of
storekeeping if he never had been before

And when he dragged himself home to the boarding house he found the
atmosphere there as dreary as the street itself The boarders were
grumpy and Mrs Atterson was in a tearful state again

Hiram could not stay in his room It was a narrow cold place at the end
of the back hall at the top of the house There was a little painted
bureau in it one leg of which had been replaced by a brick and the
little glass was so blue and blurred that he never could see in it
whether his tie was straight or not

There was a chair a shelf for books and a narrow folding bed When the
bed was dropped down for his occupancy at night he could not get the
door open Had there ever been a fire at Attersons at night Hirams
best chance for escape would have been by the window

So this evening to kill the miserable stretch of time until sleep
should come to him the boy went out and walked the streets

Two things had saved Hiram Strong from getting into bad company on these
evening rambles One was the small amount of money he earned and the
other was the naturally clean nature of the boy The cheap amusements
which lured on either hand did not attract him

But the dangers are there in every city and they lurk for every boy in
a like position

The main thoroughfare in this part of the town where Hiram boarded
was brightly lighted gaudy electric signs attracting notice to cheap
picture shows catchpenny arcades cheap jewelry stores and the ever
present saloons and pool rooms

It looked bright and warm and lively in many of these places but the
countrybred boy was cautious

Now and then a raucousvoiced automobile shot along the street the
electric cars made their usual clangor and there was still some
ordinary traffic of the day dribbling away into the side streets for it
was early in the evening

Hiram was about to turn into one of these side streets on his way back
to Mrs Attersons Turning the corner was a handsome span of horses
attached to a comfortable but mudbespattered carriage It was plainly
from the country

The light at the corner of the street shone brightly into the carriage
Hiram saw a wellbuilt man in a gray greatcoat and slouch hat holding
the reins over the backs of the spirited horses

Beside him sat a girl She could have been no more than twelve or
fourteennot so old as Sister by a year or two But how different she
was from the starvedlooking boarding house slavey

She was framed in fursrich gray and black furs that muffled her
from top to toe only leaving her brilliant dark little face with its
perfect features shining like a jewel in its setting

She was talking laughingly to the big man beside her and he was looking
down at her Perhaps this was why he did not see what lay just aheador
perhaps the glare of the street light blinded him as it must have the
horses as the equipage turned into the darker side street

But Hiram saw their peril He sprang into the street with a cry of
warning And he was lucky enough to seize the nigh horse by the bridle
and pull both the highsteppers around

There was an excavationan opening for a watermainin this street
The workmen had either neglected to leave a red lantern or malicious
boys had stolen it

Another moment and the horses would have been in this excavation and
even now the carriage swayed One forward wheel went over the edge of
the hole and for the minute it was doubtful whether Hiram had saved the
occupants of the carriage by his quick action or had accelerated the
catastrophe



CHAPTER IV THE LOST CARD

Had Hiram Strong not been a muscular youth for his age and sturdy
withal the excited horses would have broken away from him and the
carriage would certainly have gone into the ditch

But he had a grip on the bridle reins now that could not be broken
although the horses plunged and struck fire from the stones of the
street with their shoes He dragged them forward the carriage pitched
and rolled for a moment and then stood upright again squarely on its
four wheels

All right lad Ive got em exclaimed the gentleman in the carriage

He had a hearty husky sort of voicea voice that came from deep down
in his chest and was more than a little hoarse But there was no quiver
of excitement in it Indeed he who had been in peril was much less
disturbed by the incident than was Hiram himself

Nor had the girl screamed or otherwise voiced her terror Now Hiram
heard her say as he stepped back from the plunging horses

That is a good boy Daddy Speak to him again

The man in gray laughed He was now holding in the frightened team with
one firm hand while he fumbled in the pocket of his big coat with the
other

He certainly has got some muscle that lad announced the gentleman
Here son where can I find you when Im in town again

I work at Dwights Emporium replied Hiram rather diffidently

All right Thanks Heres my card Youre the kind of a boy I like
Ill surely look you up

He held out the bit of pasteboard to Hiram but as the youth stepped
nearer to reach it the impatient horses sprang forward and the carriage
rolled swiftly by him

The card flipped from the mans fingers Hiram grabbed for it but
missed the card It fluttered into the excavation in the street and the
shadow hid it completely from the boys gaze

Had there been a lantern nearby as there should have been Hiram would
have taken it to search for the lost card For he felt suddenly as
though Opportunity had brushed past him

The man in the carriage evidently lived out of town He might be a
prosperous farmer And being a farmer he might be able to give Hiram
just the sort of job he was looking for

The card of course would have put Hiram in touch with the man And he
seemed like a hearty goodnatured individual

And the girlhis daughterwas as pretty as a picture thought Hiram
as he turned wearily toward the boarding house Well I dont know that
Ill ever see either of them again but if I could learn that mans name
and address Id certainly look him up

So much did this thought disturb him that he was up an hour earlier than
usual the next morning and hurried to work by the way of the excavation
in the street where the incident had occurred

But he could not find the card although he got down into the ditch to
search for it The loose sand perhaps rattling down from the sides of
the excavation during the night had buried the bit of pasteboard and
Hiram went on to Dwights Emporium more disheartened than ever

The work there went worse that morning Old Daniel Dwight drove the
young fellow from one task to another The other clerks got a minutes
time to themselves now and then but the proprietor of the store seemed
to have his keen eyes on Hiram continually

There was always a slowup in the work about ten oclock and Hiram had
a request to make He asked Old Daniel for an hour off

An hour offwith all this work to do What do you mean boy roared
the proprietor What do you want an hour for

Ive got an errand replied Hiram quietly

Well what is it snarled the old man curiously

Whyits a private matter I cant tell you returned the youth
coolly

No good Ill be boundno good I dont see why I should let you off
an hour

I work many an hour overtime for you Mr Dwight put in Hiram

Yes yes thats all right Thats the agreement You knew youd have
to when you came to work at the Emporium Stick to your contract boy

Then why dont you stick to yours demanded the youth boldly

Eh Eh What do you mean by that cried Mr Dwight glaring at Hiram
through his spectacles

I mean that when I came to work for you seven months ago you promised
that if I suited after six months you would raise my wages And you
havent done so said the young fellow firmly

For a moment the proprietor of the Emporium was dumb It was true He
had promised just that He had got the boy cheaper by so doing But
never before had he hired a boy who stayed as long as six months so he
had never had to raise his wages

Well well

He stammered for a moment then a shrewd thought came to his mind
He actually smiled When Mr Dwight smiled it was worse than when he
didnt

I told you that if you suited me Id raise your pay did I he
snarled Well you dont suit me You never have suited me Therefore
you get no raise young man

Hiram was not astonished he was only indignant Another boy might have
expressed his anger by flaring up and tendering his resignation on the
spot

But Hiram had that fear of debt in his breast which is almost always a
characteristic of the frugal countrybred person He had saved little
He had no prospect of another job And every Saturday night he was
expected to pay Mrs Atterson three dollars and a half

At any rate Mr Dwight he said quietly after a minutes silence
I want an hour to myself this morning

And Ill dock ye ten cents for it declared the old man

You can do as you like about that returned Hiram and he walked into
the back room took off his apron and got into his coat

He had it in mind to go to the big market where the farmers drove in
from out of town and see if he could meet one of his old neighbors
or anybody else who could tell him of prospect of work for the coming
season It was early yet for farmers to be looking for extra hands but
Hiram hoped that he might see something in prospect for the future He
had made up his mind that if possible he would not take another job in
town

And I can see pretty plainly that Ive got about through at the
Emporium he thought as he approached the open space devoted by the
City of Crawberry to a market for the truckmen and farmers who drove in
with their wares from the surrounding country

At this time of day the bustle of market was over The farmers would
have had their breakfasts in the little restaurants which encircled the
marketplace or would be preparing to drive home again The hucksters
and pushcart merchants were picking up seconds and lotends of
vegetables for their trade The cobbles of the marketplace was a litter
of cabbage leaves spilled sprouts spoiled potatoes and other refuse

Hiram walked about looking for somebody whom he knew but most of the
faces around the market were strange to him Several farmers he spoke to
about work but they were not hiring hands so when his hour was up he
went back to the Emporium more despondent than before



CHAPTER V THE COMMOTION AT MOTHER ATTERSONS

By chance that evening Hiram got home to his boarding house in good
season The early boardersearly birds Crackit always termed
themhad not yet sat down to the long table in the dingy diningroom

Indeed the supper gong had not been pounded by Sister and some of the
young men were grouped impatiently in the halflighted parlor

Through the swinging door into the steaming kitchen Hiram saw a huge
black woman waddling about the range and heard her husky voice berating
Sister for not moving faster Chloe only appeared when a catastrophe
happened at the boardinghouseand a catastrophe meant the removal of
Mrs Atterson from her usual orbit

Shes gone to the funeral That Uncle Jeptha of hern is dead
whispered Sister in Hirams ear when she put his soup in front of him

Ahha observed Mr Crackit eyeing Hiram with his head on one side
secrets eh Inside information of whats in the pudding sauce

Nothing went right at the boardinghouse during the next two days And
for Hiram Strong nothing seemed to go right anywhere

He demandedand got the permission with another tencent taxanother
hour off to visit the market But he found nobody who would hire a boy
at once Some of the farmers doubted if he knew as much about farmwork
as he claimed to know He was after all a boy and some of them would
not believe that he had even worked in the country

Affairs at the Emporium were getting strained too Daniel Dwight was as
shrewd a man as the next one He saw plainly that his junior clerk was
getting readylike the many who had gone before himfor a flitting

He knew the signs of discontent although Hiram prided himself on doing
his work just as well as ever

Then there was a squabble with Dan Junior The imp was always
underfoot on Saturdays He was supposed to helpto run errands and
take out in a basket certain orders to nearby customers who might be in
a hurry

But usually when you wanted the boy he was in the alley pitching buttons
with loafing urchins of his own kindalley rats his father angrily
called themor leading a predatory gang of the same unsavory companions
in raids on other stores in the neighborhood

And Dan Junior had it in for Hiram He had not forgiven the bigger
boy for pitching him into the puddle

An them was my best cloes and now maw says Ive got to wear em just
the same on Sunday and theyre shrunk and stained snarled the younger
Dan hovering about Hiram as the latter redressed the fruit stand
during a moments letup in the Saturday morning rush Gimme an
orange

What At five cents apiece exclaimed Hiram Guess not Go look in
the basket under the bench maybe theres a specked one there

Nope Dad took em all home last night and maw cut out the specks and
sliced em for supper Gimme a good orange

Ask your father said Hiram

Naw I wont declared young Dwight knowing very well what his
fathers answer would be

He suddenly made a grab for the golden globe on the apex of Hirams
handsomest pyramid

Let that alone Dan cried Hiram and seized the youngster by the
wrist

Dan Junior was a wiry little scamp and he twisted and turned and
kicked and squalled and Hiram was just wrenching the orange from his
hand when Mr Dwight came to the door

Whats this Whats this he demanded Fighting are ye Why dont
you tackle a fellow of your own size Hi Strong

At that Dan Junior saw his chance and broke into woeful sobs He was a
good actor

Ive a mind to turn you over to a policeman Hiram cried Mr Dwight
Thats what Ive a mind to do

I suppose youll discharge me first wont you suggested Hiram
scornfully

You can come in and git your money right now young man said the
proprietor of the Emporium Dan let them oranges alone And dont you
go away from here Ill want you all day today I shall be shorthanded
with this young scalawag leaving me in the lurch like this

It had come so suddenly that Hiram almost lost his breath He had part
of his wish that was sure He was not likely to work for Daniel Dwight
any longer

The old man led the way back to his office He had a little pile of
money already counted out upon the desk It was plain that he had
intended quarreling with Hiram and getting rid of him at this time
for he had the young fellows wages figured up to t hat very hourand
twenty cents deducted for the two hours Hiram had had off

But that isnt fair Im willing to work to the end of the day I ought
to get my wages in full for the week save for the twenty cents said
Hiram mildly

To tell the truth now that he had lost his jobunpleasant as it had
beenHiram was more than a little troubled He was indeed about to be
cast adrift

Youll git jest that sum and not a cent more declared Mr Dwight
sharply And if you start any trouble here Ill call in the officer on
the beatyes I will I dont know but I ought to deduct the cost of
Dan Juniors spoiled suit too He says you an he was skylarkin on
Sunday and thats how he fell into the water

Hiram had no answer to make to this What was the use He took the
money slipped it into his pocket and went out

He did not linger around the Emporium Nor was he scarcely out of sight
when a man driving a span of handsome bay horses halted his team before
the store jumped out and went in

Are you the proprietor of Dwights Emporium asked the man in the
gray coat and hat in his hearty tones You are Glad to meet you Im
looking for a young man who works for you

Whos that What do you want of him asked Dan Senior doubtfully
and rubbing his hand for the strangers grip had been as hearty as his
voice

The other laughed in his jovial way Why to tell the truth I dont
know his name I didnt ask him Hes not much more than a boya sturdy
youngster with a quick way with him He did me a service the other
evening and I wanted to see him

There aint any boy working here snapped Mr Dwight Thems all
the clerks I got behind the counterand there aint one of em under
thirty Ill be bound

Thats so admitted the stranger And although it was so dark I could
not see that fellows face and I didnt ask his name I am sure he was
young

I jest discharged the only boy I hadand scamp enough he was snarled
Mr Dwight If you were looking for him youd have been sorry to find
him I didnt know but Id have to send for a policeman to git him off
the premises

Whatwhat

Thats what I tell you He was a bad egg Mebbe hes the boy you
wantbut you wont get no good of him when you find him And Ive no
idea where hes to be found now and the old man turned his back on the
man in the gray coat and went into his office

The stranger climbed back into his buggy and took up the lines again
with a preoccupied headshake

Now I promised Lettie he muttered that Id find out all about that
boyand maybe bring him home with me Funny that man gave his such
a bad character Wish I could have seen the lads face the other
nightthat would have told the story

Well and he dismissed the matter with a sigh for he was busy man
if hes got my card and he is out of a job perhaps hell look me up
Then well see



CHAPTER VI THIS DIDNT GET BY HIRAM

Ive sure got plenty of time now to look for a job observed Hiram
Strong when he was two blocks away from Dwights Emporium But I
declare I dont know where to begin

For his experience in talking with the farmers around the market had
rather dashed Hirams hope of getting a place in the country at once It
was too early in the season Nor did it look so much like Spring as it
had a week ago Already Hiram had to turn up the collar of his rough
coat and a few flakes of snow were settling on his shoulders as he
walked

Its winter yet he mused If I cant get something to do in the
city for a few weeks to tide me over Im afraid I shall have to find a
cheaper place to board than at Mother Attersons

After half an hour of strolling from street to street however Hiram
decided that there was nothing in that game He must break in somewhere
so he turned into the very next warehouse

Want a job Ill be looking for one myself pretty soon if business
isnt better was the answer he got from the first man he approached

But Hiram kept at it and got short answers and long answers pleasant
ones and some that were not so pleasant but all could be summed up in
the single monosyllable

No

I certainly am a failure here in town Hiram thought as he walked
through the snowblown streets How foolish I was ever to have come
away from the country

A fellow ought to stick to the job he is fitted forand thats sure
But I didnt know I thought there would be forty chances in town to one
in the country

And there doesnt seem to be a single chance right now Why Ill have
to leave Mrs Attersons if I cant find a job before next week is out

This mean old town is overcrowded with fellows like me looking for
work And when it comes to office positions I havent a highschool
diploma nor am I fitted for that kind of a job

I want to be out of doors Working in a stuffy office wouldnt suit me
Oh as a worker in the city I am a rank failure and thats all there is
about it

He went home to supper much more tired than he would have been had he
done a full days work at Dwights Emporium Indeed the job he had lost
now loomed up in his troubled mind as much more important than it had
seemed when he had desired to change it for another

Mother Atterson was at home She hadnt more than taken off her bonnet
however and had had but a single clash with Chloe in the kitchen

I smelled it burnin the minute I set my foot on the front step
she declared You cant fool my nose when it comes to smelling burned
stuff

Well Hiram she continued too full of news to remark that he was at
home long before his time I saw the poor old soul laid away at least
I wish now Id got Chloe in before and gone to see Uncle Jeptha before
he was in his coffin

But I didnt think I could afford it and thats a fact We poor folks
cant have many pleasures in this world of toil and trouble added
the boarding house mistress to whom even the break of a funeral or a
deathbed visit was in the nature of a solemn amusement

And there the old man went and made his will years ago unbeknownst to
anybody and me bein his only blood relation as you might say though
it was years since I seen him much but he remembered my mother with
love and she began to wipe her eyes

Poor old man And me with a whitefaced cow that Im afraid of my life
of and an old horse that looks like a motheaten hide trunk we to
have in our garret at home when I was a little girl and belonged to my
greatgreatgrandmother Atterson

And theres a mess of chickens that eat all day long and dont lay an
egg as far as I could see besides a sow and a litter of six pigs that
squeal worse than the the switchengine down yonder in the freight
yard

And theyre all to be fed and how Im to do it and feed the boarders
too I dont for the life of me see finished Mrs Atterson completely
out of breath

What do you mean cried Hiram suddenly waking to the significance of
the old ladys chatter Do you mean he willed you these things

Of course she returned smoothing down her best black skirt They
go with the house and outbuildingsall the chattels and appurtenances
thereto the will read

Why Mrs Atterson gasped Hiram He must have left you the farm

Thats what I said returned the old lady complacently And what Im
to do with it Ive no more idea than the man in the moon

A farm repeated Hiram his face flushing and his eyes beginning to
shine

Now Hiram Strong was not a particularly handsome youth but in his
excitement he almost looked so

Eighty acres so many rods and so many perches pursued Mrs
Atterson nodding Thats the way it reads The perches is in the
henhouse I sposethough why the description included them and not the
hens nests I dunno

Eighty acres of land repeated Hiram in a daze

All free and clear Not a dollar against itonly encumbrances is the
chickens the cow the horse and the pigs declared Mrs Atterson If
it wasnt for them it might not be so bad Scovilles an awfully nice
place and the farms on an automobile road A body neednt go blind
looking for somebody to go by the door occasionally

And if it got so bad here finally that I couldnt make a livin keeping
boarders pursued the lady I might go out there and live in the old
housewhich isnt much I know but its a shelter and my tastes are
simple goodness knows

But a farm Mrs Atterson broke in Hiram Think what you can do with
it

Thats what Id like to have you or somebody else tell me exclaimed
the old lady tartly I aint got no more use for a farm than a cat has
for two tails

Butbut isnt it a good farm queried Hiram puzzled

How do I know snapped the boarding house mistress I wouldnt know
one farm from another exceptin two cant be in exactly the same spot
Oh do you mean could I sell it

No

The lawyer advised me not to sell just now He said something about the
state of the real estate market in that section Prices would be better
in a year or two And then the old place is mighty run down

Thats what I mean Hiram hastened to say Has it been cropped to
death Is the soil worn out Cant you run it and make something out of
it

For pitys sake ejaculated the good lady how should I know And I
couldnt run itI shouldnt know how

Ive got a neighborwoman in the house just now to tend to thingsand
thats costin me a dollar and a half a week And therell be taxes to
pay andandWell I just guess Ill have to try and sell it now and
take what I can get

Though that lawyer says that if the place was fixed up a little and
crops put in it would make a thousand dollars difference in the selling
price That is after a year or two

But bless us and save us cried Mrs Atterson Id be swamped with
expenses before that time

Mebbe not said Hiram Strong trying to repress his eagerness Why
not try it

Try to run that farm cried she Why Id jest as lief go up in one
o those aeroplanes and try to run it I wouldnt be no more up in the
air then than I would be on a farm she added grimly

Get somebody to run it for youdo the outside work I mean Mrs
Atterson said Hiram You could keep house out there just as well as
you do here And it would be easy for you to learn to milk

That whitefaced cow My goodness Id just as quick learn to milk a
switchengine

But its only her head that looks so wicked to you laughed Hiram
And you dont milk that end

Wellmebbe admitted Mrs Atterson doubtfully I reckon I could
make butter againI used to do that when I was a girl at my aunts And
either Id make those hens lay or Id have their dratted heads off

And my goodness me To get rid of the boardersOh stop your talkin
Hi Strong That is too good to ever be true Dont talk to me no more

But I want to talk to you Mrs Atterson persisted the youth
eagerly

Well whod I get to do the outside workput in crops and tend em
and look out for that old horse

Hiram almost choked This opportunity should not get past him if he
could help it

Let me do it Mrs Atterson Give me a chance to show you what I can
do he cried Let me run the farm for you

Whywhy do you suppose that it could be made to pay us Hi demanded
his landlady in wonder

Other farms pay why not this one rejoined Hiram sententiously Of
course he added his native caution coming to the surface Id want
to see the placeto look it over pretty well in factbefore I made
any agreement And I can assure you Mrs Atterson if I saw no chance
of both you and me making something out of it I should tell you so

Butbut your job Hiram And I wouldnt approve of your going out
there and lookin at the place on a Sunday

Ill take the early train Monday morning said the youth promptly

But what will they say at the store Mr Dwight

He turned me off today said Hiram steadily So I wont lose
anything by going out there

I tell you what Ill do he added briskly I wont have any too much
money while Im out of a job of course And I shall be out there at
Scoville a couple of days looking the place over its probable

So if you will let me keep this three dollars and a half I should
pay you for my next weeks board tonight Ill pay my own expenses out
there at the farm and if nothing comes of it all well and good

Mrs Atterson had fumbled for her spectacles and now put them on to
survey the boys earnest face

Do you mean to say you can run a farm Hi Strong she asked

I do and he smiled confidently at her

And make it pay

Perhaps not much profit the first season but if the farm is fertile
and the marketing conditions are right I know I can make it pay us both
in two years

Ive got a little money saved up I could sell the house in a week for
its always full and there are always lone women like me with a little
driblet of money to exchange for a boarding househeaven help us for
the fools we are Mrs Atterson exclaimed

And I expect you could raise vegetables enough to part keep us Hi
even if the farm wasnt a great success

And eggs and chickens and the pigs and milk from the cow suggested
Hiram

Well I declare thats so admitted Mrs Atterson Id been lookin
on all them things as an expense They could be made an asset eh

I should hope so responded Hiram smiling

And I could get rid of these boardersMy soul and body gasped
the tired woman suddenly Do you suppose its true Hi Get rid of
worryin about paying the bills and whether the boarders are all going
to keep their jobs and be able to pay regularlyAnd the gravy

Hiram Strong If you can show me a way out of this valley of
tribulation Ill be the thankfullest woman that you ever seen Its a
bargain Dont you pay me a cent for this coming week And I shouldnt
have taken it anyway when youre throwed out of work so Thats a
mighty mean man that Daniel Dwight

You go right ahead and look that farm over If it looks good you come
back and well strike a bargain I know AndandJust to think
of getting rid of this house and these boarders and Mrs Atterson
finished by wiping her eyes again vigorously



CHAPTER VII HOW HIRAM LEFT TOWN

Hiram Strong was up betimes on Monday morningSister saw to that She
rapped on his door at fourthirty

Sometimes Hiram wondered when the girl ever slept She was still
dragging about the kitchen or diningroom when he went to bed and she
was first down in the morningeven earlier than Mrs Atterson herself

The boarding house mistress was not intentionally severe with Sister
but the much harassed lady had never learned to make her own work easy
so how should she be expected to be easy on Sister

Once or twice Hiram had talked with the orphan Sister had a dreadful
fear of returning to the institution from which Mrs Atterson had
taken her And Sisters other fearful remembrance was of an old woman
who beat her and drank much gin and water

Not that she had been illtreated at the institution but she had been
dressed in an ugly uniform and the girls had been rough and pulled her
pigtails like Dan Junior

Once a gentleman came to see me Sister confided to Hiram He was
a lawyer gentleman the matron told me He knew my namebut Ive
forgotten it now

And he said that somebody who once belonged to meor I once belonged
to themhad died and perhaps there would be some money coming to me
But it couldnt have been the old woman I lived with for she never had
only money enough for gin

Anyhow I was glad I axed him how much moneywas it enough to treat
all the girls in the institution one round of icecream soda and he
laffed he did And he said yesjust about enough for that if he could
get it for me And I ran away and told the girls

I promised them all a treat But the man never came again and by and
by the big girls said they believed I storied about it and one night
they came and dragged me out of bed and hung me out of the window by my
wrists till I thought my arms would be pulled right out of the sockets
They was awful cruelthem girls But when I axed the matron why the
man didnt come no more she put me off I guess he was only
foolin decided Sister with a sigh Folks like to fool melike Mr
Crackiteh

But Mrs Atterson told Hiram when he asked about Sisters meagre little
story that the institution had promised to let her know if the lawyer
ever returned to make further inquiries about the orphan Somebody
really had died who was of kin to the girl but through some error the
institution had not made a proper record of her pedigree and the lawyer
who had instituted the search a seemed to have dropped out of sight

But Hiram was not troubled by poor Sisters private affairs upon this
Monday morning It was the beginning of a new week indeed to him He
had turned over a new leaf of experience He hoped that he was pretty
near to the end of his harsh city existence

He hurried downstairs long in advance of the other boarders and Mrs
Atterson served him some breakfast although there was no milk for the
coffee

I dunno where that plague o my life Sisters gone sputtered the
old lady fussing about between diningroom and kitchen I sent her
out ten minutes ago for the milk And if you want to get that first
train to Scoville youve got to hurry

Never mind the milk laughed the young fellow The trains more
important this morning

So he bolted the remainder of his breakfast swallowed the black coffee
and ran out

He arrived at Scoville while the morning was still young It was not his
intention to go at once to the Atterson farm There were matters which
he desired to look into in addition to judging the quality of the soil
on the place and the possibility of making it pay

He went to the storekeepers and asked questions about the prices paid
for garden truck He walked about the town and saw the quality of
the residences and noted what proportion of the townsfolk cultivated
gardens of their own

There was a big girls boardingschool and two small but
wellpatronized hotels The proprietors of these each owned a farm
but they told Hiram that it was necessary for them to buy much of their
table vegetables from city produce men as the neighboring farmers did
not grow much

In talking with one storekeeper Hiram mentioned the fact that he was
going to look at the Atterson place with a view to farming it for its
new owner When he walked out of the store he found himself accosted
by a lean snakylooking man who had stood within the store the moment
before

Whats this widder woman goin to do with the farm old Jeptha left
her inquired the man looking at Hiram slyly

We dont know yet sir what we shall do with it the young fellow
replied

You her son

No I may work for hercant tell till Ive looked at the place

It aint much to look at said the man quickly I come near buying
it once though In fact

He hesitated still eyeing Hiram sideways The boy waited for him to
speak again He did not wish to be impolite but he did not like the
mans appearance

What do y reckon this Mis Atterson would sell for finally demanded
the man

She has been advised not to sellat present

Who by

Mr Strickland the lawyer

Humph Mebbe Id buy itand give her a good price for itright now

What do you consider a good price asked Hiram quietly

Twelve hundred dollars said the man

I will tell her But I do not think she would sell for that
pricenothing like it in fact

Well mebbe shell feel different when she comes to think it over
No use for a woman trying to run a farm And if she has to pay for
everything to be done shell be in a hole at the end of the season I
guess she aint thought of that

It wouldnt be my place to point it out to her returned Hiram
coolly if it were so and I wanted to work for her

Humph Mebbe not Well my names Pepper Mebbe Ill be out to see her
some day he said and turned away

Hes one of the people who will discourage Mrs Atterson thought
Hiram And he has an axe to grind If I decide to take the job of
making this farm pay Im going to have the agreement in black and
white with Mrs Atterson for there will be a raft of Jobs comforters
perhaps when we get settled on the place

It was late in the afternoon before Hiram was ready to start for the
farm itself He had made some enquiries and had decided to stop at a
neighbors for overnight instead of going to the house where a lone
woman had been left in charge by Mrs Atterson

The Pollocks had been recommended to Hiram and by leaving the road
within half a mile of the Atterson farm and cutting across the fields
he came into the dooryard of the Pollock place A wellgrown boy not
much older than himself was splitting some chunks at the woodpile He
stopped work to gaze at the visitor with much curiosity

From what they told me in town Hi said holding out his hand with a
smile you must be Henry Pollock

The boy blushed but awkwardly took and shook His hand

Thats what they call meHenry Pollockwhen they dont call me Hen

Well Ill make a bargain with you Henry laughed Hiram I dont
like to have my name cut off short either My names Hiram Strong So
if youll agree to always call me Hiram Ill always call you Henry

Its a go returned the other shaking hands again You going to live
around here Or are you jest visiting

I dont know yet confessed Hiram sitting down beside the boy You
see Ive come out to look at the Atterson place

Thats right over yonder You can see the roof if you stand up said
Henry quickly

Hiram stood up and in the light of the early sunset he caught a
glimpse of the roof in question

Your folks going to buy it of the old lady Uncle Jeptha left it to
asked Henry with pardonable curiosity Or are you going to rent it

What do you think of renting it queried Hiram showing that he had
Yankee blood in him by answering one question with another

Wellits pretty well run down and thats a fact The old man
couldnt do much the last few years and them Dickersons who farmed it
for him aint no great shakes of farmers now I tell you

Well I want to look the farm over before I decide what Ill do said
Hiram slowly And of course I cant do that tonight They told me in
town that sometimes you take boarders

In the summer we do returned Henry

Do you think your folks will put me up overnight

Why I reckon soHiram Strong did you say your name was Come right
in added Henry hospitably and Ill ask mother



CHAPTER VIII THE LURE OF GREEN FIELDS

The Pollocks proved to be a neighborly familyand a large one As Henry
said there was a whole raft of young uns younger than he was They
made Hiram very welcome at the supper table and showed much curiosity
about his personal affairs

But the young fellow had been used to just such people before They were
not a bad sort and if they were keenly interested in the affairs of
other people it was because they had few books and newspapers and
small chance to amuse themselves in the many ways which city people
have

Hiram slept with Henry that night and Henry agreed to show the visitor
over the Atterson place the next day

I know every stick and stone of it as well as I do ourn declared
Henry And Dad wont mind my taking time now LaterWhew I tell you
we hafter just git up an dust to make a crop Not much chance for fun
after a week or two until the corns laid by

You know all the boundaries of the Atterson farm do you Hiram asked

Yes sir replied Henry eagerly And say do you like to fish

Of course who doesnt

Then well take some lines and hooks alongand motherll lend us a pan
and kettle Say Well start earlyfore anybodys astirand I bet
therell be a big trout jumping in the pool under the big sycamore

That certainsure sounds good to me cried Hiram enthusiastically

So it was agreed and before day while the mist was yet rolling across
the fields and the hedge sparrows were beginning to chirp the two set
forth from the Pollock place crossed the wet fields and the road and
set off down the slope of a long hill following as Henry said near
the east boundary of the Atterson farmthe line running from the
automobile road to the river

It was a dull spring morning The faint breeze that stirred on the
hillside was damp but odorous with newspringing herbs As Hiram
and Henry descended the aisle of the pinewood the treetops whispered
together as though curious of these bold humans who disturbed their
solitude

It doesnt look as though anybody had been here at the back end of old
Jeptha Attersons farm for years said Hiram

And its a fact that nobody gets down this way often Henry responded

The brown tags sprung under their feet now and then a dewwet branch
swept Hirams cheek seeking with its cold fingers to stay his progress
It was an enchanted forest and the boy hearthungry from his two years
of city life was enchanted too

Hiram learned from talking with his companion that at one time the
piece of thirtyyearold timber they were walking through had been
tilledafter a fashion But it had never been properly cleared as the
hacked and ancient stumpage betrayed

Here and there the lines of corn rows which had been plowed when the
last crop was laid by were plainly revealed to Hirams observing eye
Where corn had grown once it should grow again and the pine timber
would more than pay for being cut for blowing out the big stumps with
dynamite and tamharrowing the side hill

Finally they reached a point where the ground fell away more abruptly
and the character of the timber changed as well Instead of the stately
pines this more abrupt declivity was covered with hickory and oak The
sparse brush sprang out of rank black mold

Charmed by the prospect Hiram and Henry descended this hill and came
suddenly through a fringe of brush to the border of an open cove or
bottom

At some time this lowland too had been cleared and cultivated but now
young pines quickspringing and lush dotted the five or six acres of
practically open land which was as level as ones palm

It was two hundred yards or more in width and at the farther side
a hedge of alders and pussywillows grew with the green mist of young
leaves upon them and here and there a ghostly sycamore stretching its
slender bole into the air edged the course of the river

Hiram viewed the scene with growing delight His eyes sparkled and
a smile came to his lips as he crossed with springy steps the open
meadow on which the grass was already showing green in patches

Between the line of the wood they had left and the breadth of the meadow
was a narrow marshy strip into which a few stones had been cast and on
these they crossed dry shod The remainder of the bottomland was firm

Aint this jest a scrumptious place demanded Henry and Hiram agreed

At the rivers edge they parted the bushes and looked down upon the
oilyflowing brown flood It was some thirty feet broad and with the
melting of the snows in the mountains was so deep that no sign was
apparent here of the rocks which covered its bed

Henry led the way up the bank of the stream toward a huge sycamore that
leaned lovingly over the water An ancient wild grape vine its
butt four inches through and its roots fairly in the water had a
stranglehold upon this decrepit forest monarch its tendrils reaching
the sycamores topmost branch

Under the tree was a deep hole where flotsam leaves and twigs performed
an endless treadmill dance in the grasp of the eddy

Suddenly while their gaze clung to the dimpling water there was a
flash of a bronze bodya streak of light along the surface of the
pooland two widening circles showed where the master of the hole had
leaped for some insect prey

See him called Henry but under his breath

Hiram nodded but squeezed his companions hand for silence He almost
held his own breath for the moment as they moved back from the pool
with the soundless step of an Indian

That big feller is my meat declared Henry

Go to it boy urged Hiram and set about preparing the camp

He cut with his big jackknife and set up a tripod of green rods in a
jiffy skirmished for dry wood lit his fire filled the kettle from the
river at a little distance from the eddy and hung it over the blaze to
boil

Meanwhile Henry fished out a line and an envelope of hooks from an inner
pocket cut a springy pole back on the hillside rigged his line and
hook and kicked a hole in the soft rich soil until he unearthed a fat
angleworm

With this impaled upon the hook he cautiously approached the pool under
the sycamore and cast gently The struggling worm sank slowly the water
wrinkled about the line but there followed no tug at the hook although
Henry stood patiently for several moments He cast again and yet again
with like result

Ah ba muttered Hiram in his ear this fellows appetite needs
tickling He is being fed too well and turns up his nose at a common
earthworm does he Let me show you a wrinkle Henry

Henry drew the line ashore again and shook off the useless bait

Youre not fishing Hiram continued with a grim smile Youve just
been drowning a worm But Ill show that old fellow sulking down below
there that he is no match this early in the spring for a pair of hungry
boys

He recrossed the meadow and the stepping stones to the wood He had
noticed a log lying in the path as he descended the hillside With the
toe of his boot he kicked a patch of bark from the log and thereby lay
bare the wavering trail of a busy grub Following the trail he quickly
found the fat juicy insect which immediately took the earthworms
place upon the hook

Again Henry cast and this time before the grub even touched the surface
of the pool the fish leaped and swallowed the tempting morsel hook and
all

There was no playing of the fish on Henrys part A quick jerk and the
gasping spotted beauty a pound and a quarter or more in weight lay
upon the sward beside the crackling fire

Whoopee called Henry excitedly Thats Number One

While Hiram dexterously scaled and cleaned the first trout Henry caught
a couple more Hiram brought forth too the coffee salt and pepper
sugar a piece of fat salt pork and two table knives and forks

He raked a smooth bed in the glowing coals sliced the pork thin laid
some slices in the pan and set that upon the coals where the pork began
to sputter almost at once

The water in the kettle was boiling and he made the coffee Then he laid
the trout upon the pan with three slices of pork upon each and sat
back upon his haunches beside Henry enjoying the delicious odor in
anticipation of the more solid delights of breakfast

They had hard crackers and with these and drinking the coffee from
the kettle itself when it was cool enough the two boys feasted like
monarchs

By Jo exclaimed Henry This beats maws soda biscuit and fat meat
gravy

But as he ate Hirams gaze traveled again and again across the
scrubgrown meadow The lay of the land pleased him The richness of the
soil had been revealed when they dug the earthworm

For thousands of years the riches of yonder hillside had been washing
down upon the bottom and this alluvial was rich beyond computation

Here were several acres the young farmer knew which however
overcropped the remainder of Uncle Jepthas land had been could not be
impoverished in many seasons

Its as rich as cream muttered he thoughtfully Grubbing out these
young pines wouldnt take long Theres a heavy sod and it would have
to be ploughed deeply Then a crop of corn this year perhapslate corn
for fear the river might overflow it in June And then

Great Scot ejaculated Hiram slapping his knee what wouldnt grow
on this bottom land

Yes its mighty rich agreed Henry But its a long way from the
houseand then the river might flood it over Ive seen water running
over this bottom two feet deeponce

They finished the al fresco meal and Hiram leaped up inspired by his
thoughts to brisker movements

Whatever else this old farm has on it I vow and declare he said
this five or six acres alone might be made to pay a profit on the whole
investment



CHAPTER IX THE BARGAIN IS MADE

Henry showed Hiram the branch a little stream flowing into the river
which marked the westerly boundary of the farm for some ways and they
set off up the steep bank of this stream

This back end of the farmquite forty acres or half of the whole
tracthad been entirely neglected by the last owner of the property for
a great many years It was some distance from the house for the farm
was a long and narrow strip of land from the highway to the river and
Uncle Jeptha had had quite all he could do to till the uplands and the
fields adjacent to his home

They came upon these open fieldsmany of them filthy with dead weeds
and littered with sprouting bushesfrom the rear Hiram saw that the
fences were in bad repair and that the back of the premises gave every
indication of neglect and shiftlessness

Perhaps not exactly the latter Uncle Jeptha had been an old man and
unable to do much active work for some years But he had cropped certain
of his fields on shares with the usual resultsimpoverished soil
illytilled crops and the land left in a slovenly condition which
several years of careful tillage would hardly overcome

Now although Hirams father had been of the tenant class he had farmed
other mens land as he would his own Owners of outlying farms had been
glad to get Mr Strong to till their fields

He had known how to work he knew the reasons for every bit of labor
he performed and he had not kept his son in ignorance of them As they
worked together the father had explained to the son what he did and why
he did it The results of their work spoke for themselves and Hiram had
a retentive memory

Mr Strong too had been a great readerespecially in the winter when
the farmer naturally has more time indoors

Yet he was a twelve months farmer he knew that the winter despite
the broken nature of the work was quite as valuable to the successful
farmer as the other seasons of the year

The elder Strong knew that men with more money and more time for
experimenting than he had were writing and publishing all the time
helps for the wise farmer He subscribed for several papers and read
and digested them carefully

Hiram even during his two years in the city had continued his
subscription although it was hard to find the money sometimes to two
or three of those publications that his father had most approved And
the boy had read them faithfully

He was as uptodate in farming lore now if not in actual practise as
he had been when he left the country to try his fortune in Crawberry

Beyond the place where the branch turned back upon itself and hid its
source in the thicker timber Hiram saw that the fields were open on
both sides of this westerly line of the farm

Whos our neighbor over yonder Henry he asked

DickersonSam Dickerson said Henry And hes got a boy Pete no
older than us Say Hiram youll have trouble with Pete Dickerson

Oh I guess not returned the young farmer laughing Trouble is
something that I dont go about hunting for

You dont have to hunt it when Pete is round said Henry with a wry
grin But mebbe he wont bother you for hes workin near townfor
that new man thats moved into the old Fleigler place Bronsons his
name But if Pete dont bother you Sam may

Sams the father

Yep And one poor farmer and mean man if ever there was one Oh Pete
comes by his orneriness honestly enough

Oh I hope Ill have no trouble with any neighbor said Hiram
hopefully

They came briskly to the outbuildings belonging to Mrs Attersons newly
acquired legacy Hiram glanced into the hog lot She looked like a good
sow and the sixweeksold shoats were in good condition In a couple of
weeks they would be big enough to sell if Mrs Atterson did not care to
raise them

The shoats were worth six dollars a pair too he had inquired the day
before about them There was practically eighteen dollars squealing in
that penand eighteen dollars would go a long way toward feeding the
horse and cow until there was good pasturage for them

These animals named were in the small fenced barnyard In the fall and
winter the old man had fed a good deal of fodder and other roughage and
during the winter the horse and cow had tramped this coarse material
and the stable scrapings into a mat of fairly good manure

He looked the horse and cow over with more care It was a fact that
the horse looked pretty shaggy but he had been used little during
the winter and had been seldom curried A ragged coat upon a horse
sometimes covers quite as many good points as the same quality of
garment does upon a man

When Hiram spoke to the beast it came to the fence with a friendly
forward thrust of its ears and the confidence of a horse that has been
kindly treated and looks upon even a strange human as a friend

It was a strong and wellshaped animal more than twelve years old
as Hiram discovered when he opened the creatures mouth but seemingly
sound in limb Nor was he too large for work on the cultivator while
sturdy enough to carry a single plow

Hiram passed him over with a satisfactory pat on the nose and turned
to look at the whitefaced cow that had so terrified Mrs Atterson She
wasnt a bad looking beast either and would freshen shortly Her calf
would be worth from twelve to fifteen dollars if Mrs Atterson did not
wish to raise it Another future asset to mention to the old lady when
he returned

The youth turned his attention to the buildings themselvesthe barn
the cart shed the henhouse and the smaller buildings That famous old
decorating firm of Wind  Weather had contracted for all painting done
around the Atterson place for the many years but the buildings were not
otherwise in a bad state of repair

A few shingles had been blown off the roofs here and there a board was
loose With a hammer and a few nails and in a few hours many of these
small repairs could be accomplished And a coat or two of properly
mixed and applied whitewash would freshen up the whole place andlike
charitycover a multitude of sins

Henry bade him goodbye now they shook hands and Hiram agreed to let
his new friend know at once if he decided to come with Mrs Atterson to
the farm

We can have heaps of funyou and me declared Henry

It isnt so bad soliloquized the young farmer when he was alone
Thered be time to put the buildings and fences in good shape before
the spring work came on with a rush Theres fertilizer enough in the
barnyard and the pig pen and the hen runwith the help of a few pounds
of salts and some bone meal perhapsto enrich a right smart kitchen
garden and spread for corn on that four acre lot yonder

Of course this land up here on the hill needs humus If it has been
cropped on shares as Henry says all the enrichment it has received
has been from commercial fertilizers And necessarily they have made the
land sour It probably needs lime badly

Yes I cant encourage Mrs Atterson to look for a profit in anything
this year It will take a year to get that rich bottom into shape
forfor what I wonder Onions Celery It would raise em both Ill
think about that and look over the market prospects more fully before I
decide

For already you see Hiram had come to the decision that this old farm
could be made to pay Why not The true farmer has to have imagination
as well as the knowledge and the perseverance to grow crops He must be
able in his minds eye to see a field ready for the reaping before he
puts in a seed

He did not go to the house on this occasion but after casually
examining the tools and harness and the like left by the old man he
cut off across the upper end of the farm and gave the neglected open
fields of this upper forty a casual examination

If she had the money to invest Id say buy sheep and fence these
fields and so get rid of the weeds Theyve grown very foul through
neglect and cultivating them for years would not destroy the weeds as
sheep would in two seasons

But wire fencing is expensiveand so are good sheep to begin with No
Slow but sure must be our motto I mustnt advise any great outlay of
moneythat would scare her to death

It will be hard enough for her to put out money all season long before
there are any returns Well go slow repeated Hiram

But when he left the farm that afternoon he went swiftly enough to
Scoville and took the train for the not far distant city of Crawberry
This was Tuesday evening and he arrived just about supper time at Mrs
Attersons

The reason for Hirams absence and the matter of Mrs Attersons legacy
altogether had been kept from the boarders And there was no time until
after the principal meal of the day was off the ladys mind for Hiram to
say anything to her

Shes a good old soul thought Hiram And if its in my power to make
that farm pay and yield her a competency for her old age Ill do it

Meanwhile he was not losing sight of the fact that there was something
due to him in this matter He was bound to see that he got his
shareand a just shareof any profits that might accrue from the
venture

So after the other boarders had scattered and Mrs Atterson had eaten
her own late supper and Sister was swashing plates and knives and forks
about in a big pan of hot water in the kitchen sink between whiles
doing her best to listen at the crack of the door the landlady and
Hiram Strong threshed out the project fully

It was not all onesided for Mrs Atterson after all had been
bargaining all her life and could see the main chance as quickly as
the next one She had not bickered with hucksters chivvied grocerymen
fought battles royal with butchers and endured the existence of a Red
Indian amidst allied foes for two decades without having her wits ground
to a razor edge

On the other hand Hiram Strong although a boy in years had been his
own master long enough to take care of himself in most transactions and
withal had a fund of native caution They jotted down memoranda of the
points on which they were agreed which included the following

Mrs Atterson as party of the first part agreed to board Hiram until
the crops were harvested the second year In addition she was to pay
him one hundred dollars at Christmas time this first year and another
hundred at the conclusion of the agreementi e when the second
years crop was harvested

Beside of the estimated profits of the second years crop Hiram was
to have twentyfive per cent This profit was to be that balance in the
farms favor if such balance there was over and above the actual cost
of labor seed and such purchased fertilizer or other supplies as were
necessary Mrs Atterson agreed likewise to supply one serviceable horse
and such tools as might be needed for the place was to be run as a
onehorse farm

On the other hand Hiram agreed to give his entire time to the farm to
work for Mrs Attersons interest in all things to make no expenditures
without discussing them first with her and to give his best care and
attention generally to the farm and all that pertained thereto Of
course the old lady was taking Hiram a good deal on trust But she had
known the boy almost two years and he had been faithful and prompt in
discharging his debts to her

But it was up to the young fellow to make good He could not expect
to make any profit for his employer the first year but he would be
expected to do so the second season or show cause


When these matters were all discussed and the little memorandum
signed Hiram Strong in his own room thought the situation over very
seriously He was facing the biggest responsibility that he had obliged
to assume in his whole life

This was no boyish job it was mans work He had put his hand to an
agreement that might influence his whole future and certainly would
make or break his credit as a trustworthy youth and one of his word

During these past days Hiram had determined to get back to the soil
and to get back to it in a businesslike way He desired to make good
for Mrs Atterson so that he might some time have the chance to make
good for somebody else on a bigger scale

He did not propose to be a onehorse farmer all his days



CHAPTER X THE SOUND OF BEATING HOOFS

On Monday morning Mrs Atterson put her house in the agents hands On
Wednesday a pair of spinster ladies came to look at it They came again
on Thursday and again on Friday

Friday being considered an unlucky day they did not bind the bargain
but on Saturday money was passed and the new keepers of the house were
to take possession in a week Not until then were the boarders informed
of Mother Attersons change of circumstances and the fact that she was
going to graduate from the boarding house kitchen to the farm

After all they were sorrythose lightheaded irresponsible young
men There wasnt one of them from Crackit down the line who could
not easily remember some special kindness that marked the old ladys
intercourse with him

As soon as the fact was announced that the boarding house had changed
hands the boarders were up in arms There was a wild gabble of voices
over the supper table that night Crackit led the chorus

Its a mean trick Mother Atterson has sold us like so many cattle to
the highest bidder Ungratefulright down ungrateful I call it he
declared What do you say Feeble

It is particularly distasteful to me just now complained the invalid
When Sister has learned to give me my hot water at just the right
temperature and he took a sip of that innocent beverage Dont you
suppose we could prevail upon the old lady to renig

Shes bound to put us off with half rations for the rest of the time
she stays declared Crackit shaking his head wisely Shes got
nothing to lose now She dont care if we all up and leaveafter she
gets hers

Thats always the way feebly remarked Mr Peebles Just as soon as I
really get settled down into a halfdecent lodging something happens

Mr Peebles had been a fixture at Mother Attersons for nearly ten
years Only Old Lem Camp had been longer at the place

The latter was the only boarder who had no adverse criticism for the
mistresss new move Indeed this evening Mr Camp said nothing whatever
even his usual mumblings to himself were not heard

He ate slowly and but little He was still sitting at the table when
all the others had departed

Mrs Atterson started into the diningroom with her own supper between
two plates when she saw the old man sitting there despondent in looks
and attitude his head resting on one clawlike hand his elbow on the
soiled table cloth

He did not look up nor move The mistress glanced back over her
shoulder and there was Sister sniffling and occasionally rubbing her
wrist into her red eyes as she scraped the tower of plates from the
dinner table

My soul and body gasped Mother Atterson almost dropping her supper
on the floor Theres Sisterand theres Old Lem Camp Whatever will I
do with em

Meanwhile Hiram Strong had already left for the farm on the Wednesday
previous The other boarders knew nothing about his agreement with
Mother Atterson he had agreed to go to the place and begin work and
take care of the stock and all choring for himself as the good lady
called it until she could complete her city affairs and move herself
and her personal chattels to the farm

Hiram bore a note to the woman who had promised to care for the Atterson
place and money to pay her what the boardinghouse mistress had agreed

You can bach it in the house as well as poor old Uncle Jeptha did I
reckon this woman told the youth

She showed him where certain provisions werethe pork barrel ham and
bacon of the old mans curing and the few vegetables remaining from the
winters store

The cow was about gone dry anyway said the woman Mrs Larriper who
was a widow and lived with her married daughter some halfmile down the
road toward Scoville so I didnt bother to milk her

Youll have to go to town to buy grain if you want to feed her upand
for the chickens and the horse The old man didnt make much of a crop
last yearor them shiftless Dickersons didnt make much for him

I saw Sam Dickerson around here this morning He borrowed some of the
old mans tools when Uncle Jeptha was sick and youll have to go after
em I reckon

Sams the best borrower that ever was but he never can remember to
bring things back He says its bad enough to have to borrow its too
much to expect the same man to return what he borrows

Now Mrs Dickerson pursued Mrs Larriper was as nice a girl before
she marriedshe was a Stepneyas ever walked in shoeleather And I
guess shed be right friendly with the neighbors if Sam would let her

But the poor thing never gits to go outno sir Shes jest tied to
the house They lost a child oncefour year ago Thats the only time
I remember of seeing Sarah Stepney in church since the day she was
marriedand shes got a boyPeteas old as you be

Now on the other side o ye theres Darrells tract and you wont
have no trouble there for there aint a house on his place and he lets
it lie idle Waiting for a rise in price I spect

Some rich folks is comin in and buying up pieces of land and making
what they calls gentlemens estates out o them A family named
BronsonMr Stephen Bronson with one little girlbought the Fleigler
place only last month

Theyre nice folks pursued this amiable but talkative lady and
they dont live but a mile or so along the Scoville road You passed the
placewhite with green shutters and a watertower in the back when
you walked up

I remember it said Hiram nodding

Theyre western folk Come clear from out in Injiany or Illiny or
the like The girls going to school and she aint got no mother so her
fathers come on East with her to be near the school

Well I cant help you no more Them hens Well Id sell em if I was
Mis Atterson

Hens aint much nowadays anyhow and I expect a good many of those are
too old to lay Uncle Jeptha couldnt fuss with chickens and he didnt
raise only a smitch of em last year and the year beforejust them that
the hens hatched themselves in stolen nests and chanced to bring up
alive

You better grease the cart before you use it Its stood since they
hauled in corn last fall

And look out for Dickerson Ask him for the things he borrowed Youll
need em praps if youre goin to do any farmin for Mis Atterson

She bustled away Hiram thought he had heard enough about his neighbors
for a while and he went out to look over the pasture fencing which was
to be his first repair job He would have that ready to turn the cow and
her calf into as soon as the grass began to grow

He rummaged about in what had been half woodshed and half workshop
in Uncle Jepthas time and found a heavy clawhammer a pair of wire
cutters and a pocket full of fence staples

With this outfit he prepared to follow the line fence which was
likewise the pasture fence on the west side between Mrs Attersons and
Dickersons

Where he could he mended the broken strands of wire In other places
the wires had sagged and were loose The clawhammer fixed these like
a charm Slipping the wire into the claw a single twist of the wrist
would usually pick up the sag and make the wire taut again at that
point

He drove a few staples as needed as he walked along The pasture
partook of the general conformation of the farmit was rather long and
narrow

It had grown to clumps of bushes in spots and there was sufficient
shade But he did not come to the water until he reached the lower end
of the lot

The branch trickled from a spring or springs farther east It made
an elbow at the corner of the pasturethe lower southwest cornerand
there a waterhole had been scooped out at some past time

This waterhole was deep enough for all purposes and was shaded by a
great oak that had stood there long before the house belonging to Jeptha
Atterson had been built

Here Hiram struck something that puzzled him The boundary fence crossed
this waterhole at a tangent and recrossed to the west bank of the
outflowing branch a few yards below leaving perhaps half of the
waterhole upon the neighbors side of the fence

Some of this wire at the waterhole was practically new So were the
posts And after a little Hiram traced the line of old postholes which
had followed a straight line on the west side of the waterhole

In other words this waterprivilege for Dickersons land was of recent
arrangementso recent indeed that the young farmer believed he could
see some freshturned earth about the newlyset posts

Thats something to be looked into I am afraid thought Hiram as he
moved along the southern pasture fence

But the trickle of the branch beckoned him he had not found the
fountainhead of the little stream when he had walked over a part of the
timbered land with Henry Pollock and now he struck into the open woods
again digging into the soil here and there with his heavy boot marking
the quality and age of the timber and castingup in his mind the
possibilities and expense of clearing these overgrown acres

Mrs Atterson may have a very valuable piece of land here in time
muttered Hiram A sawmill set up in here could cut many a hundred
thousand feet of lumberand good lumber too But it would spoil the
beauty of the farm

However as must ever be in the case of the utility farm the house was
set on its ugliest part The cleared fields along the road had nothing
but the background of woods on the south and east to relieve their
monotony

On the brow of the steeper descent which he had noted on his former
visit to the back end of the farm he found a certain clearing in the
wood Here the pines surrounded the opening on three sides

To the south through a break in the wooded hillside he obtained a
farreaching view of the river valley as it lay to the east and to the
west The prospect was delightful

Here and there on the farther bank of the river which rose less
abruptly there than on this side lay several cheerful looking
farmsteads The white dwellings and outbuildings dotted the checkered
fields of green and brown

Cowbells tinkled in the distance for the weather tempted farmers to let
their cattle run in the pastures even so early in the season A horse
whinnied shrilly to a mate in a distant field

The creaking of the heavy wheels of a laden farmcart was a mellow sound
in Hirams ears Beyond a fir plantation high on the hillside the
sharply outlined steeple of a little church lay against the soft blue
horizon

A beautyspot Hiram muttered What a site for a home And yet people
want to build their houses right on an automobile road and in sight of
the rural mail box

His imagination began to riot spurred by the outlook and by the nearer
prospect of wood and hillside The sun now lay warmly upon him as he sat
upon a stump and drank in the beauty of it all

After a time his ear becoming attuned to the multitudinous voices
of the wood descried the silvery note of falling water He arose and
traced the sound

Less than twenty yards away and not far from the bluff a vigorous
rivulet started from beneath the halfbared roots of a monster beech
and fell over an outcropping boulder into a pool so clear that sand
on its bottom worked mysteriously into a pattern by the action of the
water lay revealed

Hiram knelt on a mossy rock beside the pool and bending put his lips
to the water It was the sweetest most satisfying drink he had imbibed
for many a day

But the morning was growing old and Hiram wanted to trace the farther
line of the farm He went down to the river crossed the open meadow
again where they had built the campfire the morning before and found
the deeply scarred oak which stood exactly on the boundary line between
the Atterson and Darrell tracts

He turned to the north and followed the line as nearly as might be The
Darrell tract was entirely wooded and when he reached the uplands
he kept on in the shadowy aisles of the sappines which covered his
neighbors property

He came finally to where the ground fell away again and the yellow
deeplyrutted road lay at his feet The winter had played havoc with the
automobile track

The highway was unfenced and the bank dropped fifteen feet to the beaten
path A leaning oak overhung the road and Hiram lingered here lying
on its broad trunk face upward with his hat pulled over his eyes to
shield them from the sunlight which filtered through the branches

This land hereabout was beautiful The boy could appreciate the beauty
as well as the utility of the soil It was so pleasing to the eye that
he wished with all his heart it had been his own land he had surveyed

And Ill not be a tenant farmer all my life nor a farmforeman as
father was determined the boy Ill get ahead If I work for the
benefit of other people for a few years surely Ill win the chance in
time to at last work for myself

In the midst of his ruminations a sound broke upon his eara jarring
note in the peaceful murmur of the woodland life It was the thud of a
horses hoofs

Not the sedate tunktunk of ironshod feet on the damp earth but
an erratic and rapid pounding of hoofbeats which came on with such
startling swiftness that Hiram sat up instantly and craned his neck to
see up the road

That horse is running away gasped the young farmer and he swung
himself out upon the lowest branch of the leaning tree which overhung
the carttrack the better to see along the highway



CHAPTER XI A GIRL RIDES INTO THE TALE

There was no bend in the highway for some distance but the overhanging
trees masked the track completely save for a few hundred yards The
horse whether driven or running at large was plainly spurred by
fright

Into the peacefulness of this place its hoofbeats were bringing the
element of peril

Lying prostrate on the sloping trunk Hiram could see much farther up
the road The outstretched head and lathered breast of a tall bay horse
leaped into view and like a picture in a kinetoscope growing larger
and more vivid second by second the maddened animal came down the road

Hiram could see that the beast was not riderless but it was a moment
or twoa longdrawn anxious space of heartbeaten secondsere he
realized what manner of rider it was who clung so desperately to the
masterless creature

Its a girla little girl gasped Hiram

She was only a speck of color with white drawn face on the back of
the racing horse

Every plunge of the oncoming animal shook the little figure as though
it must fall from the saddle But Hiram could see that she hung with
phenomenal pluck to the broken bridle and to the single horn of her
sidesaddle

If the horse fell or if she were shaken free she would be flung to
instant death or be fearfully bruised under the pounding hoofs of the
big horse

The young farmers appreciation of the peril was instant unused as he
was to meeting such emergency there was neither panic nor hesitancy in
his actions

He writhed farther out upon the limb of the leaning oak until he was
direct above the road The big bay naturally kept to the middle for
there was no obstruction in its path

To have dropped to the highway would have put Hiram to instant
disadvantage for before he could have recovered himself after the drop
the horse would have been upon him

Now swinging with both legs wrapped around the tough limb and his left
hand gripping a smaller branch but with his back to the plunging brute
the youth glanced under his right armpit to judge the distance and the
onrush of the horse and its helpless rider

He knew she saw him Swift as was the steeds approach Hiram had seen
the change come into the expression of the girls face

Clear your foot of the stirrup he shouted hoping the girl would
understand

With a confusing thunder of hoofbeats the bay came onwas beneath
himhad passed

Hirams right arm shot out curved slightly and as his fingers gripped
her sleeve the girl let go She was whisked out of the saddle and the
horse swept on without her

The strain of the girls slight weight upon his arm lasted but a moment
for Hiram let go with his feet swung down and dropped

They alighted in the roadway with so slight a jar that he scarcely
staggered but set the girl down gently and for the passing of a breath
her body swayed against him seeking support

Then she sprang a little away and they stood looking at each
otherHiram panting and flushed the girl with wideopen eyes out of
which the terror had not yet faded and cheeks still colorless

So they stood for fully half a minute speechless while the thunder of
the bays hoofs passed further and further away and finally was lost in
the distance

And it wasnt excitement that kept the boy dumb for that was all over
and he had been as cool as need be through the incident But it
was unbounded amazement that made him stare so at the slight girl
confronting him

He had seen her brilliant dark little face before Only oncebut that
one occasion had served to photograph her features on his memory

For the second time he had been of service to her but he knew
instantlyand the fact did not puzzle himthat she did not recognize
him

It had been so dark in the unlighted side street back in Crawberry the
evening of their first meeting that Hiram believed and was glad that
neither she nor her father would recognize him as the boy who had kept
their carriage from going into the open ditch

And he had played rescuer againand in a much more heroic manner
This was the daughter of the man whom he had thought to be a prosperous
farmer and whose card Hiram had lost

He had hoped the gentleman might have a job for him but now Hiram was
not looking for a job He had given himself heartily to the project of
making the old Atterson farm pay nor was he the sort of fellow to show
fickleness in such a project

Before either Hiram or the girl broke the silencebefore that silence
could become awkward indeedthere started into hearing the ring of
rapid hoofbeats again But it was not the runaway returning

The mate of the latter appeared and he came jogging along the road
very much in hand the rider seemingly quite unflurried

This was a big ungainly beaknosed boy whose sleeves were much too
short and trouserslegs likewise to hide Natures abundant gift to him
in the matter of bone and knuckle He was freckled and wore a grin that
was not even sheepish

Somehow this stolidity and inappreciation of the peril the girl had so
recently escaped made Hiram feel sudden indignation

But the girl herself took the lout to taskbefore Hiram could say a
word

I told you that horse could not bear the whip Peter she exclaimed
with wrathful gaze How dared you strike him

AwI only touched him up a bit drawled the youth You said you
could ride anything didnt you and his grin grew wider But I see ye
had to get off

Here Hiram could stand it no longer and he blurted out

She might have been killed I believe that horse is running yet

Well why didnt you stop it demanded the other youth impudently
You had a chance

He saved me cried the girl looking at Hiram now with shining eyes
I dont know how to thank him

He might have stopped the horse while he was about it growled the
fellow picking up his own reins again Now Ill have to ride after
it

Youd better said the little lady sharply If father knew that
horse had run away with me he would be dreadfully put out You hurry
after him Peter

The lout never said a word in reply but his horse carried him swiftly
out of sight in the wake of the runaway Then the girl turned again to
Hiram and the young farmer knew that he was being keenly examined by her
bright black eyes

I am very sure father will not keep him declared the girl looking at
Hiram thoughtfully He is too carelessand I dont like him anyway
Do you live around here

I expect to replied Hiram smiling I have just come I am going to
stay at this next house along the road

Oh where the old gentleman died last week

Yes Mrs Atterson was left the place by her uncle and I am going to
run it for her

Oh dear then youve got a place to work queried the little lady
with plain disappointment in her tone I am sure father would like to
have you instead of Peter

But Hiram shook his head slowly though still smiling

Im obliged to you he said but I have agreed to stop with Mrs
Atterson for a time

I want father to meet you just the same she declared

She had a way about her that impressed Hiram with the idea that she
seldom failed in getting what she wanted If she was not a spoiled
child she certainly was a very much indulged one

But she was pretty Dark petite with a brilliant smile flashing
eyes and a riot of blueblack curls she was verily the daintiest and
prettiest little creature the young farmer had ever seen

I am Lettie Bronson she said frankly I live down the road toward
Scoville We have only just come here

I know where you live said Hiram smiling and nodding

You must come and see us I want you to know father Hes the very
nicest man there is I think

He came all the way East here so as to live near my schoolI go to the
St Beris school in Scoville Its awfully nice and the girls are very
fashionable but Id be too lonely to live if daddy wasnt right near me
all the time

What is your name she asked suddenly

Hiram told her

Why thats a regular farmers name isnt itHiram and she
laugheda clear and sweet sound that made an inquisitive squirrel that
had been watching them scamper away to his hollow chattering

I dont know about that returned the young farmer shaking his
head and smiling I ought by good rights to be a worker in brass
according to the Bible That was the trade of Hiram of the tribe of
Naphtali who came out of Tyre to make all the brass work for Solomons
temple

Oh and there was a King Hiram of Tyre too wasnt there cried
Lettie laughing You might be a king you know

That seems to be an unprofitable trade nowadays returned the young
fellow shaking his head I think I will be the namesake of Hiram the
brasssmith for it is said of him that he was filled with wisdom and
understanding and that is what I want to be if I am going to run Mrs
Attersons farm and make it pay

Youre a funny boy said the girl eyeing him furiously
Youreyoure not at all like Peteor these other boys about
Scoville

And that Pete Dickerson isnt any good at all I shall tell daddy all
about how he touched up that horse and made him run Here he comes now

They had been walking steadily along the road toward the Atterson house
and in the direction the runaway had taken Pete Dickerson appeared
riding one of the bays and leading the one that had been frightened

The latter was all of a lather was blowing hard and before the horses
reached them Hiram saw that the runaway was in bad shape

Hold on he cried to the lout Breathe that horse a while Let him
stand He ought to be rubbed down too Dont you see the shape he is
in

Aw whats eatin you demanded Pete eyeing the speaker with much
disfavor

The horse when he stopped was trembling all over His nostrils were
dilated and as red as blood and strings of foam were dripping from his
bit

Dont let him stand there in the shade spoke Hiram more mildly
Hell take a chill Here let me have him

He approached the still frightened horse and Pete jerked the
bridlerein The horse started back and snorted

Stand round there ye tarnal nuisance exclaimed Pete

But Hiram caught the bridle and snatched it from the other fellows
hand

Just let me manage him a minute said Hiram leading the horse into
the sunshine

He patted him and soothed him and the horse ceased trembling and his
ears pricked up Hiram still keeping the reins in his hand loosened
the cinches and eased the saddle so that the animal could breathe
better

There were bunches of dried sagegrass growing by the roadside and the
young farmer tore off a couple of these bunches and used them to wipe
down the horses legs Pretty soon the creature forgot his fright and
looked like a normal horse again

If he was mine Id give him whip aplentytill he learned better
drawled Pete Dickerson finally

Dont you ever dare touch him with the whip again cried the girl
stamping her foot He will not stand it You were told

Aw well said the fellow I didnt think he was going to cut up as
bad as that These Western horses aint moren half broke anyway

I think he is perfectly safe for you to ride now Miss Bronson said
Hiram quietly Ill give you a hand up But walk him home please

He had tightened the cinches again Lettie put her tiny booted foot in
his hand she wore a very pretty dark green habit and with perfect ease
the young farmer lifted her into the saddle

Goodbyeand thank you again she said softly giving him her free
hand just as the horse started

Say youre the fellow whos going to live at Attersons place
observed Pete Ill see you later and he waved his hand airily as he
rode off

So thats Pete Dickerson is it ruminated Hiram as he watched the
horses out of sight Well if his father Sam is anything like him we
certainly have got a sweet pair of neighbors



CHAPTER XII SOMETHING ABOUT A PASTURE FENCE

That afternoon Hiram hitched up the old horse and drove into town

He went to see the lawyer who had transacted Uncle Jeptha Attersons
small business in the old mans lifetime and had made his willMr
Strickland Hiram judged that this gentleman would know as much about
the Atterson place as anybody

NoMr Atterson never said anything to me about giving a neighbor
waterrights the lawyer said Indeed Mr Atterson was not a man
likely to give anything awayuntil he had got through with it himself

Dickerson once tried to buy a right at that corner of the Atterson
pasture but he and the old gentleman couldnt come to terms

Dickerson has no water on his place saving his well and his rights on
the river It makes it bad for him I suppose but I do not advise Mrs
Atterson to let that fence stand Give that sort of a man an inch and
hell take a mile

But what shall I do

Thats professional advice young man returned the lawyer smiling
But I will give it to you without charge

Merely go and pull the new posts up and replace them on the line If
Dickerson interferes with you come to me and well have him bound over
before the Justice of the Peace

You represent Mrs Atterson and are within her rights Thats the best
I can tell you

Now Hiram was not desirous of starting any troublelegal or
otherwisewith a neighbor but neither did he wish to see anybody take
advantage of his old boarding mistress He knew that beside farming
for her he would probably have to defend her from many petty annoyances
like the present case

So he bought the wire he needed for repairs a few other things that
were necessary and drove back to the farm determined to go right ahead
and await the consequences

Among his purchases was an axe In the workshop on the farm was a fairly
good grindstone only the treadle was broken and Hiram had to repair
this before he could make much headway in grinding the axe Henry
Pollock lived too far away to be called upon in such a small emergency

Being obliged to work alone sharpens ones wits The young farmer had to
resort to shifts and expedients on every hand as he went along

The day before while wandering in the wood he had marked several white
oaks of the right size for posts He would have preferred cedars of
course but those trees were scarce on the Atterson tractand they
might be needed for some more important job later on

When he came up to the house at noon to feed the stock and make his own
frugal meal in the farm house kitchen the posts were cut After dinner
he harnessed the horse to the farm wagon and went down for the posts
taking the rolls of wire along to drop beside the fence

The horse was a steady willing creature and seemed to have no tricks
He did not drive very well on the road of course but that wasnt what
they needed a horse for

Driving was a secondary matter

Hiram loaded his posts and hauled them to the pasture driving inside
the fence line and dropping a post wherever one had rotted out

Yet posts that had rotted at the ground were not so easy to draw out as
the young farmer very well knew and he set his wits to work to make the
removal of the old posts easy of accomplishment

He found an old but strong carpenters horse in the shed to act as
a fulcrum and a seasoned bar of hickory as a lever There was never
an old farm yet that didnt have a useful heap of junk and Hiram had
already scratched over Uncle Jepthas collection of many years standng

He found what he sought in a wrought iron band some half inch in
thickness with a heavy hook attached to it by a single strong link
He fitted this band upon the larger end of the hickory bar wedging it
tightly into place

A short length of trace chain completed his simple postpuller And he
could easily carry the outfit from place to place as it was needed

When he found a weak or rotting post he pulled the staples that held
the strands of wire to it and and then set the trestle alongside the
post Resting the lever on the trestle he dropped the end link of the
chain on the hook looped the chain around the post and hooked on with
another link Bearing down on the lever brought the post out of the
ground every time

With a longhandled spade Hiram cleaned out the old holes or enlarged
them and set his new posts one after the other He left the wires to
be tightened and stapled later

It was not until the next afternoon that he worked down as far as the
waterhole Meanwhile he had seen nothing of the neighbors and neither
knew nor cared whether they were watching him or not

But it was evident that the Dickersons had kept tabs on the young
farmers progress for he had no more than pulled the posts out of
the waterhole and started to reset them on the proper line than the
longlegged Pete Dickerson appeared

Hey you shouted Pete What are you monkeying with that line fence
for

Because I wont have time to fix it later responded Hiram calmly

Fresh Ike aint yer demanded young Dickerson

He was half a head taller than Hiram and plainly felt himself safe in
adopting bullying tactics

You put them posts back where you found em and string the wires again
in a hurryor Ill make yer

This is Mrs Attersons fence said Hiram quietly I have made
inquiries about the line and I know where it belongs

No part of this waterhole belongs on your side of the fence
Dickerson and as long as I represent Mrs Atterson its not going to be
grabbed

Say the old man gave my father the right to a part of this hole long
ago

Show your legal paper to that effect promptly suggested Hiram Then
we will let it stand until the lawyers decide the matter

Pete was silent for a minute meanwhile Hiram continued to dig his hole
and finally set the first post into place

I tell you to take that post out o there Mister exclaimed Pete
suddenly approaching the other I dont like you anyway You helped
git me turned off up there to Bronsons yesterday If you wouldnt have
put your fresh mouth in about the horse that gal wouldnt have knowed
so much to tell her father Now you stop foolin with this fence or Ill
lick you

Hiram Strongs disposition was far from being quarrelsome He only
laughed at first and said

Why that wont do you any good in the end Peter Thrashing me wont
give you and your father the right to usurp rights at this waterhole

There was very good reason as I can see for old Mr Atterson refusing
to let you water your stock here In time of drouth the branch probably
furnished no more water than his own cattle needed And it will be the
same with my employer

Youd better have less talk about it and set back them posts
declared Pete decidedly laying off his coat and pulling up his shirt
sleeves

I hope you wont try anything foolish Peter said Hiram resting on
his shovel handle

Huh grunted Pete eyeing him sideways as might an evildisposed dog

Were not well matched observed Hiram quietly and whether you
thrashed me or I thrashed you nothing would be proved by it in regard
to the line fence

Ill show you what I can prove cried Pete and rushed for him

In a catchascatchcan wrestle Pete Dickerson might have been able
to overturn Hiram Strong But the latter did not propose to give the
longarmed youth that advantage

He dropped the spade stepped nimbly aside and as Pete lunged past
him the young farmer doubled his fist and struck his antagonist solidly
under the ear

That was the only blow struckthat and the one when Pete struck the
ground The bigger fellow rolled over grunted and gazed up at Hiram
with amazement struggling with the rage expressed in his features

I told you we were not well matched Peter spoke Hiram calmly Why
fight about it You have no right on your side and I do not propose to
see Mrs Atterson robbed of this water privilege

Pete climbed to his feet slowly and picked up his coat He felt of his
neck carefully and then looked at his hand with the idea evidently that
such a heavy blow must have brought blood But of course there was none

Ill tell my dadthats what Ill do ejaculated the bully at
length and he started immediately across the field his long legs
working like a pair of tongs in his haste to get over the ground

But Hiram completed the setting of the posts at the waterhole without
hearing further from any member of the Dickerson family



CHAPTER XIII THE UPROOTING

These early Spring days were busy ones for Hiram Strong The mornings
were frosty and he could not get to his fencing work until midforenoon
But there were plenty of other tasks ready to his hand

There were two south windows in the farmhouse kitchen He tried to keep
some fire in the stove there day and night sleeping as he did in Uncle
Jepthas old bedroom nearby

Before these two windows he erected wide shelves and on these he set
shallow boxes of rich earth which he had prepared under the cart shed
There was no frost under there the earth was dry and the hens had
scratched in it during the winter so Hiram got all the wellsifted
earth he needed for his seed boxes

He used a very little commercial fertilizer in each box and planted
some of the seeds he had bought in Crawberry at an agricultural
warehouse on Main Street

Mrs Atterson had expressed the hope that he would put in a variety of
vegetables for their own use and Hiram had followed her wishes When
the earth in the boxes had warmed up for several days he put in the
longgerminating seeds like tomato onions the salads leek celery
pepper eggplant and some beet seed to transplant for the early garden
It was too early yet to put in cabbage and cauliflower

These boxes caught the sun for a good part of the day In the afternoon
when the sun had gone Hiram covered the boxes with old quilts and did
not uncover them again until the sun shone in the next morning He had
decided to start his early plants in this way because he hadnt the time
at present to build frames outside

During the early mornings and late afternoons too he began to make the
small repairs around the house and outbuildings Hiram was handy with
tools indeed a true farmer should be a good mechanic as well He must
often combine carpentry and wheelwrighting and work at the forge with
his agricultural pursuits Hiram was something better than a coldiron
blacksmith

When it came to stretching the wire of the pasture fence he had to
resort to his inventive powers There are plenty of wire stretchers that
can be purchased but they cost money

The young farmer knew that Mrs Atterson had no money to waste and he
worked for her just as he would have worked for himself

One man working alone cannot easily stretch wire and make a good job
of it without some mechanism to help him Hirams was simple and easily
made

A twelveinch section of perfectly round post seven or eight inches
through served as the drum around which to wind the wire and two
twentypenny nails driven into the side of the drum close together
were sufficient to prevent the wire from slipping

To either end of the drum Hiram passed two lengths of Number 9 wire
through large screweyes making a double loop into which the hook of a
light timber chain would easily catch Into one end of the drum he drove
a headless spike upon which the handcrank of the grindstone fitted
and was wedged tight

In using this ingenious wire stretcher he stapled his wire to post
number one carried the length past post number two looped the chain
around post number three having the chain long enough so that he might
tauten the wire and hold the crankhandle steady with his knee or left
arm while he drove the holding staple in post number two And so repeat
ad infinitum

After he had made this wirestretcher the young fellow got along
famously upon his fencing and could soon turn his attention to other
matters knowing that the cattle would be perfectly safe in the pasture
for the coming season

The old posts he collected on the wagon and drew into the dooryard
piling them beside the woodshed There was not an overabundant supply
of firewood cut and Hiram realized that Mrs Atterson would use
considerable in her kitchen stove before the next winter even if she
did not run a sitting room fire for long this spring

Using a bucksaw is not only a thankless job at any time but it is no
saving of time or money There was a good twohanded saw in the shed and
Hiram found a good rattail file With the aid of a homemade sawholder
and a monkey wrench he sharpened and set this saw and then got Henry
Pollock to help him for a day

Henry wasnt afraid of work and the two boys sawed and split the old
and wellseasoned posts and some other wood so that Hiram was enabled
to pile several tiers of stovewood under the shed against the coming of
Mrs Atterson to her farm

If the season wasnt so far advanced I could cut a lot of wood draw
it up and hire a gasoline engine and saw to come on the place and saw
us enough to last a year Ill do that next winter Hiram said

Thats what we all ought to do agreed his friend

Henry Pollock was an observing farmers boy and through him Hiram gained
many pointers as to the way the farmers in that locality put in their
crops and cultivated them

He learned too through Henry who was supposed to be the best farmer
in the neighborhood who had special success with certain crops and who
had raised the best seedcorn in the locality

It was not particularly a trucking community although since Scoville
had begun to grow so fast and many city people had moved into that
pleasant town the local demand for garden produce had increased

It used to be a saying here said Henry that a bushel of winter
turnips would supply all the needs of Scoville But that aint exactly
so now

The stores all want green stuff in season and are beginning to pay
cash for truck instead of only offering to exchange groceries for the
stuff we raise I guess if a man understood truck raising he could make
something in this market

Hiram decided that this was so on looking over the marketing
possibilities of Scoville

There was a canning factory which put up string beans corn and
tomatoes but the prices per hundredweight for these commodities did
not encourage Hiram to advise Mrs Atterson to try and raise anything
for the canneries A profit could not be made out of such crops on a
onehorse farm

For instance the neighboring farmers did not plant their tomato seeds
until it was pretty safe to do so in the open ground The cannery did
not want the tomato pack to come on until late in August By that time
the cream of the prices for gardengrown tomatoes had been skimmed by
the early truckers

The same with sweet corn and green beans The cannery demanded these
vegetables at so late a date that the marketprice was generally low

These facts Hiram bore in mind as he planned his seasons work and
especially the kitchen garden This latter he planned to be about two
acres in extentrather a large plot but he proposed to set his rows
of almost every vegetable far enough apart to be worked with a horse
cultivator

Some cropsfor instance onions carrots and other fine stuffmust
be weeded by hand to an extent and if the soil is rich enough rows
twelve or fifteen inches apart show better results

Between such rows a wheelhoe can be used to good advantage and that
was one toolwith a seedsowing combinationthat Hiram had told Mrs
Atterson she must buy if he was to practically attend to the whole farm
for her Handhoeing in both field and garden crops is antediluvian

Thus during this week and a half of preparation Hiram made ready for
the uprooting of Mrs Atterson from the boarding house in Crawberry to
the farm some distance out of Scoville

The good lady had but one wagon load of goods to be transferred from
her old quarters to the new home Many of the articles she brought were
heirlooms which she had stored in the boarding house cellar or articles
associated with her happy married life which had been shortened by her
husbands death when he was comparatively a young man

These Mrs Atterson saw piled on the wagon early on Saturday morning
and she had insisted upon climbing upon the seat beside the driver
herself and riding with him all the way

The boarders gathered on the steps to see her go The two spinster
ladies had already taken possession and had served breakfast to the
disgruntled members of Mother Attersons family

Youll be back again prophesied Mr Crackit shaking the old lady by
the hand And when you do just let me know Ill come and board with
you

I wouldnt have you in my house again Fred Crackit for two farms
declared the exboarding house keeper with asperity

I hope you told these people about my hot water Mrs Atterson
croaked Mr Peebles from the step where he stood muffled in a shawl
because of the raw morning air

If I didnt you can tell em yourself returned she with
satisfaction

And so it wentthe goodbyes of these unappreciative boarders selfish
to the last Mother Atterson sigheda long happy and satisfying
sighwhen the lumbering wagon turned the first corner

Thanks be she murmured I shant care if they dont have a driblet
of gravy at supper tonight

Then she shook herself and stared straight ahead On the very next
cornershe had insisted that none of the other people at the house
should observe their flittingstood two figures both forlorn

Old Lem Camp with a lean suitcase at his feet and Sister with a
bulging carpetbag which she had brought with her months before from the
charity institution and into which she had stuffed everything she owned
in the world

Their faces brightened perceptibly when they beheld Mrs Atterson
perched high beside the driver on the load of furniture and bedding The
driver drew in his span of big horses and the wheels grated against the
curb

You climb right in behind Mr Camp said the good lady Theres room
for you up under the canvas topand I had him spread a mattress sot
you can take it easy all the way if you like

Sister you scramble up here and sit in betwixt me and this man And do
look outyoure spillin things out o that bag like it was a Christmas
cornucopia Come on now Toss it behind us onto them other things
There well go onand no more stops I hope till we reach the farm

But that couldnt be It was a long drive and the man was good to his
team He rested them at the top of every hill and sometimes at the
bottom They had to stop two hours for dinner and to breathe em as
the man said

At that time Mother Atterson produced a goodsized market baskether
familiar companion when she had hunted bargains in the cityand it was
filled with sandwiches and pickles and crackers and cookies and
a whole boiled fowl fowl were cheaper and more satisfying than the
scrawny chickens then in market and hardboiled eggs and cheese with
numbers of other less important eatables tucked into corners of the
basket to wedge the larger packages of food

The four picnicked in the sun with the furniture wagon to break the
keen wind passing around hot coffee in a can from hand to hand the
driver having built a campfire to heat the coffee beside the country
road

But after that stopfor they were well into the country nowthere was
no keeping Sister on the wagonseat She had learned to drop down and
mount again as lively as a cricket

She tore along the edge of the road with her hair flying and her hat
hanging by its ribbons She chased a rabbit and squirrels and picked
certain green branches and managed to get her hands and the front of
her dress all stuck up with spruce gum in trying to get a piece big
enough to chew

Drat the youngun exclaimed Mother Atterson I can see plainly
Id never ought to brought her but should have sent her back to the
institution Shell be as wild as Mr Marchs harewhoever he wasout
here in the country

But Old Lem Camp gave her no trouble He effaced himself just as he had
at the boarding house supper table He seldom spokenever unless he was
spoken to and he lay up under the roof of the furniture wagon whether
asleep or no Mrs Atterson could not tell

Hes as odd as Dicks hatband the exboarding house mistress
confided to the driver But bless you the easiest critter to get
along withyou never saw his beat If Id a house full of Lem Camps to
cook for Id think I was next door to heaven

It was dusk when they arrived in sight of the little house beside the
road in which Uncle Jeptha Atterson had lived out his long life Hiram
had a good fire going in both the kitchen and sitting room and the
lamplight flung through the windows made the place look cheerful indeed
to the travelers

My soul and body croaked the good lady when she got down from the
wagon and Hiram caught her in his arms to save her from a fall Im as
stiff as a pokerand thats a fact But Im glad to get here

Hirams amazement when he saw Sister and Old Lem Camp was only expressed
in his look He said nothing The driver of the wagon backed it to the
porch step and then took out his team and with Hirams help led them
to the stable fed them and bedded them down for the night He was to
sleep in one of the spare beds and go back to town the following day

Mother Atterson took off her best dress slipped into a familiar old
gingham and bustled around the kitchen as naturally as though she had
been there all her life

She fried ham and eggs and made biscuit and opened a couple of tins of
peaches she had brought and finally set before them a repast satisfying
if not dainty and seasoned with a cheerful spirit at least

I vum she exclaimed sitting down for the first time in years at the
first table If this dont beat Crawberry and them boarders Im crazy
as a loon Pour the coffee Sisterand dont be stingy with the milk
Milks only five cents a quart here and its eight in town But
gracious child sugar dont cost no less

Old Lem Camp sat beside Hiram as he had at the boardinghouse table He
had scarcely spoken since his arrival but now under cover of the talk
of Mother Atterson the driver of the furniture van and Sister he
began one of his oldtime monologues

Old oldnothing to look forward tothen the prospect opens upjust
like light breaking through the clouds after a stormlets see I want
a piece of breadbreads on Sisters sideI can reach ithum no
Crackit tonightfool jokessilly fellowah the butterWheres the
butterknifeSisters forgotten the butterknifeno here tisThat
womans an angelnothing lessan angel in a last seasons bonnet and a
shabby gownHah practical angels couldnt use wingstheyd be in the
way in the kitchenham and eggsgravyfit for gods to eatand not to
worry again where next weeks victuals are to come from

Hiram noted all the old mail said and the last phrase enlightened him
immensely as to why Old Lem Camp was so queer That was the trouble
on the old mans mindthe trouble that had stifled him and made him
appear half cracked as the boardinghouse jester and Peebles had said

Lem Camp too old to ever get another job in the city had for five
years been worrying from day to day about his bare existence And
evidently he saw that bogie of the superannuated disappearing in the
distance

After the truck driver had gone to bed and Camp himself and Sister had
fallen asleep over the last of the dishwiping Mother Atterson confided
in Hiram to a degree

Now this gal can be made useful She can help me in the house and she
can help outside too

Shes a poor unfortunate creatureI know and humbly is no name for
her looks But mebbe we can send her to the school nearby and she ought
to get some color in her face if shes out o doors someand some flesh
on her skinny body

I dont know as I could get along without Sister ruminated Mother
Atterson shaking her head

And as for Lem Campbless you he wont eat moren a fly and who else
would give him houseroom Why Hiram I just had to bring him with me
If I hadnt Id felt just as consciencestricken as though Id moved
and left a cat behind in an empty house



CHAPTER XIV GETTING IN THE EARLY CROPS

Mother Atterson had breakfast the next morning by lamplight because the
truckman wanted to make an early start

Hiram had already begun early rising however for the farmer who does
not get up before the sun in the spring needs must do his chores at
night by lanternlight The eighthour law can never be a rule on the
farm

But Sister was up too and out of the house running as wild as a
rabbit Hiram caught her in the barnyard trying to clamber on the cows
back to ride her about the enclosure Sister was afraid of nothing that
lived and walked having all the courage of ignorance

She found that she could not in safety clamber over the piglot fence
and catch one of the shoats Old Mother Hog ran at her with open mouth
and Sister came back from that expedition with a torn frock and some new
experience

I never knew anything so fat could run she confided to Hiram Old
Missus Poundly who lived on our block and weighed three hundred
pounds couldnt run I bet

Mr Camp was not disturbed by Mrs Atterson but was allowed to sleep as
long as he liked while she kept a little breakfast hot for him and the
coffeepot on the back of the stove

The old lady became interested at once in all Hiram had done toward
beginning the spring work She learned about the seed in the window
boxes some of them were already breaking the soil about watering them
and covering them properly and immediately took those duties off Hirams
hands

If Sister an me cant do the light chores around this place and leave
you to tend to the bigger things then we aint no good and had better
go back to the boarding house she announced

Oh Mis Atterson You wouldnt go back to town would you pleaded
Sister Why theres real hensand a cow that will give milk bimeby
Hi saysand a horse that wiggles his ears and talks right out loud when
hes hungry for I heard himand pigs that squeal and run an theyre
jest as fat as butter

Well to stay here weve all got to work Sister declared her
mistress So get at them dishes now and be quick about it
Theres forty times more chores to do here than there was back in
CrawberryBut thanks be there aint no gravy to worry about

And there aint no boarders to make fun of me said Sister
thoughtfully Then she announced after some rumination I like pigs
better than I do boarders Mis Atterson

Well I should think you would exclaimed that lady tartly Pigs has
got some sense

Hiram laughed at this Youll find the pigs demanding gravy just the
sameand very urgent about it they are too he told them

But he was glad to give the small chores over into their hands and went
to work immediately to prepare for putting in the early crops

He had already cleared the rubbish off the piece of ground selected
for the garden and had burned it He hauled out stable manure from
the barnyard and gave an acre and a half of this piece of land a good
dressing

The other halfacre was for early potatoes and he wished to put the
manure in the furrow for them so did not top dress that strip of land
The frost was pretty well out of the ground by now but even if some
remained plowing this high welldrained piece would do no harm
Beside Hiram was eager to get in early crops

It was a still hazy morning when he geared the old horse to the plow
and headed him into the garden piece He had determined to plow the
entire plot at once and instead of plowing around and around had
paced off his lands and started in the middle plowing gee instead of
haw

This system is a bit more particular and hard for the careless plowman
but it overcomes that unsightly deadfurrow in the middle of a field
and brings the finishingfurrow on the edge This insures better
surface drainage and is a more scientific method of tillage

The plow was rusty and the point was not in the very best condition but
after the first few rounds the share was cleaned off and it began to
slip through the moist earth and roll it over in a long brown ribbon
behind him

Hiram Strong clung to the plow handles a roperein in each hand and
watched the plow and the horse and the land ahead with an eye as keen as
that of a riverpilot

As the strip of turned earth grew wider and longer Sister ran out to see
him work She watched the plow turn the mulch into the furrow and lay
the brown greasy mold upon it with wideopen eyes

Why cried she wouldnt it be nice if we could go right along with
a plow and bury our past like thatcover everything mean and nasty
up and forget it That institution they put me inand the old woman
I lived with before that who drank so much gin and beat meand the
boardersand that boy who used to pull my braids whenever he met meMy
that would be fine

I reckon that is what Life does do for us returned Hiram
thoughtfully stopping at the end of the furrow to mop his brow and let
the old horse breathe Yes sir Life plows all the experience under
and it ought to enrich our future existence just as this stuff Im
plowing under here will decay and enrich the soil

But the plow dont turn it quite under in spots said Sister with
a sigh Leastways I cant help remembering the bad things once in a
while

There were certain other individuals who found out very soon that Hiram
was plowing too Those were the hens There were not more than fifteen
or twenty of the scrubby creatures and they began to follow the plow
and pick up grubs and worms

I tell you one thing that Ive got to do before we put in much Hiram
told the exboarding house mistress at noon

Whats that Hi Dont go very deep down into my pocket for it wont
stand it After paying my bills and paying for moving out here I aint
got much money leftand thats a fact

It wont cost much but weve got to have a yard for the hens Hens and
a garden will never mix successfully Unless you enclose them you might
as well have no garden in that spot where Im plowing

There warnt but five eggs today said Mrs Atterson Mebbe wed
better chop the heads off em one after the other and eat em

Theyll lay better as it grows warmer That henhouse must be fixed
before next winter Its too draughty said Hi And then hens cant
lay wellespecially through the winterif they havent the proper kind
of food

But three or four of the dratted things want to stay on the nest all
the time complained the old lady

If I was you Mrs Atterson Hiram said soberly Id spend five
dollars for a hundred eggs of wellbred stock

Id set these hens as fast as they get broody and raise a decent flock
of biddies for next year Scrub hens are just as bad as scrub cows The
scrubs will eat quite as much as fullbloods yet the returns from the
scrubs are much less

I declare exclaimed Mrs Atterson a hens always been just a hen
to meones the same as another exceptin the feathers on some is
prettier

Tonight Ill show you some breeders catalogs and you can think the
matter over as to what kind of a fowl you want said the young farmer

He went back to his job after dinner and kept steadily at work until
three oclock before there came a break Then he saw a carriage drive
into the yard and a few moments later a man In a long gray coat came
striding across the lot toward him

Hiram knew the gentleman at onceit was Mr Bronson the father of
the girl he had saved from the runaway To tell the truth the boy
had rather wondered about his nonappearance during the days that
had elapsed But now he came with hand held out and his first words
explained the seeming omission

Ive been away for more than a week my boy or I should have seen you
before Youre Hiram Strong arent youthe boy my little girl has been
talking so much about

I dont know how much Miss Lettie has been talking about me laughed
Hiram Full and plenty I expect

And small blame to her declared Mr Bronson I wont waste time
telling you how grateful I am I had just time to turn that boy of
Dickersons off before I was called away Now my lad I want you to
come and work for me

Why much as I might like to sir I couldnt do that said Hiram

Now now well fix it somehow Lettie has set her heart on having you
around the place

Youre the second young man Ive been after whom I was sure would suit
me since we moved on to the old Fleigler place The first fellow I
cant find but dont tell me that I am going to be disappointed in you
too

Mr Bronson said Hiram gravely Im sorry to say No A little
while ago Id have been delighted to take up with any fair offer you
might have made me But I have agreed with Mrs Atterson to run her
place for two seasons

Two years exclaimed Mr Bronson

Yes sir Practically I must put her on her feet and make the old farm
show a profit

Youre pretty young to take such responsibility upon your shoulders
are you not queried the gentleman eyeing him curiously

Im seventeen I began to work with my father as soon as I could lift
a hoe I love farm work And Ive passed my word to stick to Mrs
Atterson

Thats the old lady up to the house

Yes sir

But she wouldnt hold you to your bargain if she saw you could better
yourself would she

She would not have to Hiram said firmly and he began to feel a
little disappointed in his caller A bargains a bargaintheres no
backing out of it

But suppose I should make it worth her while to give you up pursued
Mr Bronson Ill sound her a bit eh I tell you that Lettie has set
her heart on having you as we cannot find another chap whom we were
looking for

Now Hiram knew that this referred to him but he said nothing Besides
he did not feel too greatly pleased that the strongest reason for Mr
Bronsons wishing to hire him was his little daughters demand It was
just a fancy of Miss Letties And another day she might have the fancy
to turn him off

No sir spoke Hiram more firmly It is useless I am obliged to
you but I must stick by Mrs Atterson

Well my lad said the Westerner putting out his hand again I am
glad to see you know how to keep a promise even if it isnt to your
advantage And I am grateful to you for turning that trick for my little
girl the other day

I hope youll come over and see usand I shall watch your work here
Most of these fellows around here are pretty slovenly farmers in my
estimation I hope you will do better than the average

He went back across the field and Hiram returned to his plowing The
young farmer saw the bay horses driven slowly out of the yard and along
the road

He saw the flutter of a scarf from the carriage and knew that Lettie
Bronson was with her father but she did not look out at him as he
toiled behind the old horse in the furrow

However there was no feeling of disappointment in Hiram Strongs
mindand this fact somewhat surprised him He had been so attracted by
the girl and had wished in the beginning so much to be engaged by Mr
Bronson that he had considered it a mighty disappointment when he had
lost the Westerners card

However his apathy in the matter was easily explained He had taken
hold of the work on the Atterson place His plans were growing in his
mind for the campaign before him His interest was fastened upon the
contract he had made with the old lady

His hand was literally now to the plowand he was not looking back

He finished the piece that day and likewise drew out some lime that he
had bought at Scoville and spread it broadcast upon all the garden patch
save that in which he intended to put potatoes

Although it is an exploded doctrine that the application of lime to
potato ground causes scab it is a fact that it will aid in spreading
the disease Hiram was sure enoughbecause of the sheepsorrel on the
piecethat it all needed sweetening but he decided against the lime at
this time

As soon as Hiram had dragharrowed the piece he laid off two rows down
the far end as being less tempting to the straying hens and planted
early peasthe roundseeded variety hardier than the wrinkled kinds
These pearows were thirty inches apart and he dropped the peas by hand
and planted them very thickly

It doesnt pay to be niggardly with seed in putting in early peas at
any ratethe thicker they come up the better and in these low bush
varieties the thickly growing vines help support each other

This garden piecealmost two acreswas oblong in shape An acre is
just about seventy paces square Hirams garden was seventy by a hundred
and forty paces or thereabout

Therefore the young farmer had two seventyyard rows of peas or over
four hundred feet of drill He planted two quarts of peas at a cost of
seventy cents

With ordinary fortune the crop should be much more than sufficient for
the needs of the house while the peas were in a green state for being a
quick growing vegetable they are soon past

Hiram however proposed putting in a surplus of almost everything he
planted in this big gardenespecially of the early vegetablesfor he
believed that there would be a market for them in Scoville

The ground was very cold yet and snow flurries swept over the field
every few days but the peas were under cover and were off his mind
Hiram knew they would be ready to pop up above the surface just as soon
as the warm weather came in earnest and peas do not easily rot in the
ground

In two weeks or when the weather was settled he proposed planting
other kinds of peas alongside these first two rows so as to have a
succession up to midsummer

Next the young farmer laid off his furrows for early potatoes He had
bought a sack of an extraearly variety yet a potato that if left
in the ground the full length of the season would make a good winter
varietya long keeper

His potato rows he planned to have three feet apart and he plowed the
furrows twice so as to have them clean and deep

Henry Pollock happened to come by while he was doing this and stopped
to talk and watch Hiram To tell the truth Henry and his folks were
more than a little interested in what the young farmer would do with the
Atterson place

Like other neighbors they doubted if the stranger knew as much about the
practical work of farming as he claimed to know That feller from
the city the neighbors called Hiram behind his back and that is an
expression that completely condemns a man in the mind of the average
countryman

What yer bein so particular with them furrers for Hiram asked
Henry

If a jobs worth doing at all its worth doing well isnt it
laughed the young farmer

We spread our manure broadcastwhen we use any at allfor potatoes
said Henry slowly Dad says if manure comes in contact with potatoes
they are apt to rot

That seems to be a general opinion replied Hiram And it may be so
under certain conditions For that reason I am going to make sure that
not much of this fertilizer comes in direct contact with my seed

Howll you do that Ill show you said Hiram

Having run out his rows and covered the bottom of each furrow several
inches deep with the manure he ran his plow down one side of each
furrow and turned the soil back upon the fertilizer covering it and
leaving a well pulverized seed bed for the potatoes to lie in

Well said Henry thats a good wrinkle too

Hiram had purchased some formalin mixed it with water according to the
Government experts instructions and from time to time soaked his seed
potatoes two hours in the antiseptic bath In the evening he brought
them into the kitchen and they alleven Old Lem Campcut up the
potatoes leaving two or three good eyes in each piece

Id ruther do this than peel em for the boarders remarked Sister
looking at her deeplystained fingers reflectively And then nobody
wont say nothin about my hands to me when Im passin dishes at the
table

The following day she helped Hiram drop the seed and by night he had
covered them by running his plow down the other side of the row and
then smoothed the potato plat with a homemade board in lieu of a
landroller

It was the twentieth of March and not a farmer in the locality had yet
put in either potatoes or peas Some had not as yet plowed for early
potatoes and Henry Pollock warned Hiram that he was rushing the
season

That may be declared the young farmer to Mrs Atterson But I
believe the risk is worth taking If we do get em good well get em
early and skim the cream of the local market Now you see



CHAPTER XV TROUBLE BREWS

Old Lem Camp as he had been called for so many years that there
seemed no disrespect in the title was waking up Not many mornings was
he a lieabed And the lines in his forehead seemed to be smoothing out
and his eyes had lost something of their dullness

It was true that at first he wandered about the farmstead muttering
to himself in his old wayan endless monologue which was a jumble of
comment gratitude and the brief memories of other days It took some
time to adjust his poor mind to the fact that he had no longer to
fear that Poverty which had stalked ever before him like a threatening
spirit

Gratitude spurred him to the use of his hands He was not a broken
mannot bodily Many light tasks soon fell to his share and Mrs
Atterson told Hiram and Sister to let him do what he would To busy
himself would be the best thing in the world for the old fellow

Thats whats been the matter with Mr Camp for years she declared
with conviction Because he passed the sixtyyear mark and it was
against the practise of the paper company to keep employees on the
payroll over that age they turned Lem Camp off

Ridiculous He was just as well able to do the tasks that he had
learned to do mechanically as he had been any time for the previous
twenty years He had worked in that office forty years and more you
understand

Thats the worst thing about a corporation of that kindit has no
thought beyond its rules Old Mr Bundy remembered Lemthats all
If he hadnt so much stock in the concern theyd turn him off too I
expect he knows it and thats what softened his heart to Old Lem

Now let Lem take hold of whatever he can do and git interested in
it declared the practical Mrs Atterson and hell show you that
theres work left in him yet Yessirreesir And if hell work in the
open air all the better for him

There was plenty for everybody to do and Hiram would not say the old
man nay The seed boxes needed a good deal of attention for they were
to be lifted out into the air on warm days and placed in the sun And
Old Lem could do thisand stir the soil in them and pull out the grass
and other weeds that started

Hiram had planted early cabbage and cauliflower and eggplant in other
boxes and the beets were almost big enough to transplant to the open
ground Beets are hardy and although hairroots are apt to form on
transplanted garden beets the transplanting aids the growth in other
ways and Hiram expected to have tablebeets very early

In the garden itself he had already run out two rows of later beets the
width of the plot Bunched beets will sell for a fair price the whole
season through

Hiram was giving his whole heart and soul to the workhe was wrapped up
in the effort to make the farm pay And for good reason

It was up to him to not alone turn a profit for his employer and
himself but he desiredoh how stronglyto show the city folk who
had sneered at him that he could be a success in the right environment

Besides and in addition Hiram Strong was ambitiousvery ambitious
indeed for a youth of his age He wanted to own a farm of his own in
timeand it was no onehorse farm he aimed at

No indeed Hiram had read of the scientific farming of the Middle West
and the enormous tracts in the Northwest devoted to grain and other
staple crops where the work was done for the most part by machinery

He longed to see all thisand to take part in it He desired the big
things in farming nor would he ever be content to remain a helper

Im going to be my own boss some dayand Im going to boss other men
Ill show these fellows around here that I know what I want and when I
get it Ill handle it right Hiram soliloquized

Its up to me to save every cent I can Henry thinks Im niggardly
I expect because I wouldnt go to town Saturday night with him But I
havent any money to waste

The hundred Im to get next Christmas from Mrs Atterson I dont wish
to draw on at all Ill get along with such old clothes as Ive got

Hiram was not naturally a miser he frequently bought some little thing
for Sister when he went to towna hairribbon or the like which he
knew would please the girl but for himself he was determined to be
saving

At the end of his contract with Mrs Atterson he would have two hundred
dollars anyway But that was not the end and aim of Hiram Strongs
hopes

Its the clause in our agreement about the profits of our second season
that is my bright and shining star he told the good lady more than
once I dont know yet what we had better put in next year to bring us
a fortune but well know before it comes time to plant it

Meanwhile the wheelhoe and seeder he had insisted upon Mrs Atterson
buying had arrived and Hiram after studying the instructions which
came with it set the machine up as a seedsower Later after the
bulk of the seeds were in the ground he would take off the seeding
attachment and bolt on the hoe or cultivator attachments with which to
stir the soil between the narrower rows of vegetables

As he made ready to plant seeds such as carrot parsnip onion salsify
and leafbeet as well as spring spinach early turnips radishes and
kohlrabi Hiram worked that part of his plowed land over again and again
with the spike harrow finally boarding the strips down smoothly as
he wished to plant them The seedbed must be as level as a floor and
compact for good use to be made of the wheelseeder

When he had lined out one row with his garden line from side to side of
the plowed strip the marking arrangement attached to his seeder would
mark the following lines plainly and at just the distance he desired

Onions carrots and the like he put in fifteen inches apart intending
to do all the cultivating of those extremely small plants with the
wheelhoe after they were large enough But he foresaw the many hours
of cultivating before him and marked the rows for the bulk of the
vegetables far enough apart as he had first intended to make possible
the use of the horsehoe

Meanwhile he spikeharrowed the potato patch running crosswise of the
rows to break the crust and keep down the quickspringing weed seeds
The early peas were already above ground and when they were two inches
high Hiram ran his 14tooth cultivatoror seed harrow as it is called
in some localitiesclose to the rows so as to throw the soil toward the
plants almost burying them from sight again This was to give the peas
deep rootage which is a point necessary for the quick and stable growth
of this vegetable

In odd moments Hiram had cut and set a few posts bought poultry netting
in Scoville and enclosed Mrs Attersons chickenrun She had taken his
advice and sent for eggs and already had four hens setting and expected
to set the remainder of the of the eggs in a few days

Sister took an enormous interest in this poultryraising venture She
counted chickens before they were hatched with a vengeance and after
reading a few of the poultry catalogs she figured out that in three
years from the increase of Mother Attersons hundred eggs the
eightyacre farm would not be large enough to contain the flock

And all from five dollars gasped Sister I dont see why everybody
doesnt go to raising chickensthen thered be no poor folks everybody
would be richWell I expect thered always have to be institutions for
orphansand boarding houses

The newspringing things from the ground the hen industry and the
repairing and beautifying of the outside of the farmhouse did not take
up all their attention There were serious matters to be discussed in
the evening after the others had gone to bed twixt Hiram and his
employer

There was the five or six acres of bottom landthe richest piece of
soil of the entire eighty Hiram had not forgotten this and the second
Sunday of their stay at the farm after the whole family had attended
service at a chapel less than half a mile up the road he had urged Mrs
Atterson to walk with him through the timber to the riverside

For the Land o Goshen the exboarding house mistress had finally
exclaimed To think that I own all of this Why Hi it dont seem as
if it was so I cant get used to it And this timber you say is all
worth money And if I cut it off it will grow up again

In thirty to forty years the pine will be worth cutting againand some
of the other trees said Hiram with a smile

Well that would be something for Sister to look forward to said
the old lady evidently thinking aloud And I dont expect her
folkswhoever they bewill ever look her up now Hiram

But with the timber cut and this side hill cleared you would have a
very valuable thirty acres or so of tillagevaluable for almost any
crop and early too for it slopes toward the sun said the young
farmer ignoring the others observation

Well well its wonderful returned Mrs Atterson

But she listened attentively to what he had to say about clearing the
bottom land which was a much more easily accomplished task as Hiram
showed her It would cost something to put the land into shape for
late corn and so prepare it for some more valuable crop the following
season

Well nothing ventured nothing have Mrs Atterson finally agreed
Go aheadif it wont cost much more than what you say to get the corn
in I understand its a gamble and Im taking a gamblers chance
If the river rises and floods the corn in June or July then we get
nothing this season

That is a possibility admitted Hiram

Go ahead exclaimed Mother Atterson I never did know that there was
sporting blood in me but I kinder feel it risin Hi with the sap in
the trees Well chance it

Occasionally Hiram had stepped down to the pasture and squinted across
to the waterhole The grass was not long enough yet to turn the cow
into the field so he was obliged to make these special trips to the
pasture

He had seen nothing of the Dickersonsto speak to that issince his
trouble with Pete And of a sudden just before dinner one noon Hiram
took a look at the pasture and beheld a figure seemingly working down in
the corner

Hiram ran swiftly in that direction Halfway there he saw that it was
Pete and that he had deliberately cut out a panel of the fence and was
letting a pair of horses he had been plowing with drink at the pool
before he took them home to the Dickerson stable

Hiram stopped running and recovered his breath before he reached the
lower corner of the pasture Pete saw him coming and grinned impudently
at him

What are you doing here Dickerson demanded the young farmer
indignantly

Well if you wanter keep us out youd better keep up your fences
better returned Pete I seen the wires down and its handy

You cut those wires interrupted Hiram angrily

Youre another drawled Pete but grinning in a way to exasperate the
young farmer

I know you did so

Wal if you know so much what are you going to do about it demanded
the other I guess youll find that these wires will snap bout as fast
as you can mend em Now you can put that in your pipe an smoke it

But I dont smoke Hiram observed growing calm immediately There was
no use in giving this lout the advantage of showing anger with him

Mr Smartie snarled Pete Dickerson Now you see theres somebody
just as smart as you be These horses have drunk there and theyre
going to drink again

Is that your father yonder demanded Hiram shortly

Yes it is

Call him over here

Why if he comes over here hell eat you alive cried Pete
laughing You dont know my dad

I dont but I want to Hiram said calmly Thats why youd better
call him over I have got pretty well acquainted with you and the rest
of your family cant be any worse as I look at it Call him over and
the young farmer stepped nearer to the lout

You call him yourself cried Pete beginning to back away for he
remembered how he had been treated at his previous encounter with Hiram

Hiram seized the bridles of the work horses and shook them out of
Petes clutch

Tell your father to come here commanded the young farmer fire in his
eyes Well settle this thing here and now

These horses are on Mrs Attersons land I know the county stock
law as well as you do You cut this fence and your cattle are on her
ground

It will cost you a dollar a head to get them off againif Mrs
Atterson wishes to demand it Now call your father

Pete raised a yell which startled the longlegged man striding over the
hill toward the Dickerson farmhouse Hiram saw the older Dickerson turn
stare and then start toward them

Pete continued to beckon and began to yell

Dad Dad He wont let me have the hosses

Sam Dickerson came striding down to the waterholea lean long
sourlooking man he was with a brown face knotted into a continual
scowl and hard bony hands Yet Hiram was not afraid of him

Whats the trouble here growled the farmer

Hes got the hosses I told you the fence was down and I was goin to
water em

Shut up commanded his father eyeing Hiram Im talking to this
fellow Whats the trouble here

Your horses are on Mrs Attersons land Hiram said quietly You
know that stock which strays can be held for a dollar a headdamage or
no damage to crops I warn you keep your horses on your own land

Thats your fence if you dont keep it up whos fault is it if my
horses get on your land growled Dickerson evidently making the matter
a personal one with Hiram

Your boy here cut the wires

No I didnt Dad interposed Pete

Quick as a flash Hiram dropped the bridle reins sprang for Pete seized
him in a wrestlers grip twisted him around and tore from his pocket a
pair of heavy wirecutters

What were you doing with these in your pocket then demanded Hiram
disdainfully tossing the plyers upon the ground at Petes feet and
stepping back to keep the restless horses from leaving the edge of the
waterhole

Sam Dickerson seemed to take a grim pleasure in his sons overthrow He
growled

Hes got you there Pete Youd better stop monkeyin around here Pick
up them bridles and come on

He turned to depart without another word to Hiram but the latter did
not propose to be put off that way

Hold on he called Whos going to mend this fence Mr Dickerson

Dickerson turned and eyed him coldly again

Whats that to me Mend your own fence he said

Then I shall take these horses up to our barn You can come and settle
the matter with Mrs Attersonunless you wish to pay me two dollars
here and now said the young farmer his voice carrying clearly to
where the man stood upon the rising ground above him

Why you young whelp roared Dickerson suddenly starting down the
slope

But Hiram Strong neither moved nor showed fear Somehow this sturdy
young fellow in the high laced boots with his flannel shirt open at
the throat raw as was the day his sleeves rolled back to his elbows
was a figure to make even a more muscular man than Sam Dickerson
hesitate

Pete exclaimed the farmer harshly still eyeing Hiram Run up to
the house and bring my shotgun Be quick about it

Hiram said never a word and the horses yoked together began to crop
the short grass springing upon the bank of the waterhole

Youll find out youre fooling with the wrong man you whippersnapper
promised Dickerson

You can pay me two dollars and Ill mend the fence or you can mend the
fence and well call it square said Hiram slowly and evenly Im a
boy but Im not to be frightened with a threat

Petes long legs brought him flying back across the fields Nothing he
had done in a long while pleased him quite as much as this errand

Hiram turned jerked at the horses bridlereins turned them around
and with a sharp slap on the nigh ones flank sent them both trotting
up into the Atterson pasture

Stop that you rascal cried Dickerson grabbing the gun from his
hopeful son and losing his head now entirely Bring that team back

You mend the fence and I will declared Hiram unshaken

The angry man sprang down to his level flourishing the gun in a way
that would have been dangerous indeed had Hiram believed it to be
loaded And as it was the young farmer was very angry

The right was on his side if he allowed these Dickersons father and
son to browbeat him this once it would only lead to future trouble

This thing had to be settled right here and now It would never do for
Hiram to show fear And if both of the longlegged Dickersons pitched
upon him of course he would be no match for them

But Sam Dickerson stumbled and almost fell as he reached the edge of the
waterhole and before he could recover himself Hiram leaped upon him
seized the shotgun and wrenched it from his hands

He reversed the weapon in a flash clubbed it and raised it over his
head with a threatening swing that made Pete yell from the top of the
bank

Look out Dad Hes agoin ter swat yer

Sam tried to scramble out of the way But down came the gun butt with
all the force of Hirams good muscle andthe stock was splintered and
the lock shattered upon the big stone that here cropped out of the bank

Theres your gunwhats left of it panted the young farmer tossing
the broken weapon from him Now dont you ever threaten me with a gun
again for if you do Ill have you arrested

Weve got to be neighbors and weve got to get along in a neighborly
manner But Im not going to allow you to take advantage of Mrs
Atterson because she is a woman

Now Mr Dickerson he added as the man scrambled up glaring at him
evidently with more surprise than anger if youll make Pete mend this
fence you can have your horses Otherwise Im going to pound them
according to the stock law of the county

Pete said his father briefly go get your hammer and staples and
mend this fence up as good as you found it

And now said Hiram Im going home to gear the horse to the wagon
and Ill drive over to your house Mr Dickerson From time to time you
have borrowed while Uncle Jeptha was alive quite a number of tools I
want them I have made inquiries and I know what tools they are Just be
prepared to put them into my wagon will you

He turned on his heel without further words and left the Dickersons
to catch their horses and to repair the fenceboth of which they did
promptly

Not only that but when Hiram drove into the Dickerson dooryard an hour
later he had no trouble about recovering the tools which the neighbor
had borrowed and failed to return

Pete scowled at him and muttered uncomplimentary remarks but Sam
phlegmatically smoked his pipe and sat watching the young farmer without
any comment

And so that much is accomplished ruminated Hiram as he drove home
But Im not sure whether hostilities are finished or have just begun



CHAPTER XV ONE SATURDAY AFTERNOON

The old Atterson place as it was called in the neighborhood began to
take on a brisk appearance these days Sister with the help of Old Lem
Camp had long since raked the dooryard clean and burned the rubbish
which is bound to gather during the winter

Years before there had been flower beds in front but Uncle Jeptha had
allowed the grass to overrun them It was a month too early to think of
planting many flowers but Hiram had bought some seeds and he showed
Sister how to prepare boxes for them in the sunny kitchen windows along
with the other plant boxes and around the front porch he spaded up a
strip enriched it well and almost the first seeds put into the ground
on the farm were the sweet peas around this porch Mother Atterson was
very fond of these flowers and had always managed to coax some of them
to grow even in the boardinghouse back yard

At the side porch she proposed to have morningglories and moonflowers
while the beds in front would be filled with those oldfashioned flowers
which everybody loves

But if we cant make our own flowerbeds we can go without them Hi
said the bustling old lady We mustnt take you from your other work
to spade beds for us Every cats got to catch mice on this place now I
tell ye

And Hiram certainly was busy enough these days The early seeds were all
in however and he had run the seedharrow over the potato rows again
lengthwise to keep the weeds out until the young plants should get a
start

Despite the raw winds and frosts at night the potatoes had come up well
and with the steadily warming wind and sun would now begin to grow
Other farmers potatoes in the vicinity were not yet breaking the
ground

Early on Monday morning Henry Pollock appeared with bushaxe and
grubbing hoe and Hiram shouldered similar tools and they started for
the river bottom It was so far from the house that Mrs Atterson agreed
to send their dinner to them

Father says he remembers seeing corn growing on this bottom said
Henry as they set to work so high that the ears were as high up as a
tall man Its splendid corn landif it dont get flooded out

And does the river often overran its banks queried Hiram anxiously

Pretty frequent It hasnt yet this year there wasnt much snow last
winter you see and the early spring floods werent very high But
if we have a long wet spell as we do have sometimes as late as July
youll see water here

Thats not very encouraging said Hiram Not for corn prospects at
least

Well corns our staple crop You see if you raise corn enough youre
sure of feed for your team Thats the main point

But people with bigger farms than they have around here can raise corn
cheaper than we can They use machinery in harvesting it too Why not
raise a better paying crop and buy the extra corn you may need

Why responded Henry shaking his head nobody around here knows much
about raising fancy crops I read about em in the farm papersoh yes
we take papersthe cheap ones There is a lot of information in em I
guess but father dont believe much thats printed

Doesnt believe much thats printed repeated Hiram curiously

Nope He says its all lies made up out of some mans head You see
we useter take books out of the Sunday School library and we had story
papers too and father used to read em as much as anybody

But one summer we had a summer boardera man that wrote things He
had one of these dinky little merchines with him that you play on like a
piano you know

A typewriter suggested Hiram with a smile

Yep Well he wrote stories Father learnt as how all that stuff was
just imaginary and so he dont take no stock in printed stuff any more

That man just sat down at that merchine and rattled off a story that
he got real money for It didnt have to be true at all

So father soured on it And he says the stuff in the farm papers is
just the same

Im afraid that your father is mistaken there said Hiram hiding
his amusement Men who have spent years in studying agricultural
conditions and experimenting with soils and seeds and plants and
fertilizers and all that write what facts they have learned for our
betterment

No trade in the world is so encouraged and aided by Governments and by
private corporations as the trade of farming There is scarcely a State
which does not have a special agricultural college in which there are
winter courses for people who cannot give the open time of the year to
practical experiment on the college grounds

That is what you need in this locality I guess added Hiram Some
scientific farming

Book farming father calls it said Henry And he says its no good

Why dont you save your money and take a course next winter in some
side line and so be able to show him that hes wrong suggested Hiram
I want to do that myself after I have fulfilled my contract with Mrs
Atterson

I wont be able to do so next winter for I shall be on wages Youre
going to be a farmer arent you

I expect to Weve got a good farm as farms go around here But it
seems about all we can do to pay our fertilizer bills and get a living
off it

Then why dont you go about fitting yourself for your job asked
Hiram Be a good farmeran uptodate farmer

No fellow expects to be a machinist or an electrician or the like
without spending some time under good instructors Most that I know
about soils and fertilizers and plant development and the like I
learned from my father who kept abreast of the times by reading and
experiment

You can stumble along working at your trade of farming and only half
knowing it all your life thats what most farmers do in fact They are
too lazy to take up the scientific side of it and learn why

Thats the pointlearn why you do things that your father did and his
father did and his father before him Theres usually good reason why
they did ita scientific reason which somebody dug out by experiment
ages ago but you ought to be able to tell why

I suppose thats so admitted Henry as they worked on side by side
But I dont know what father would say if I sprung a college course on
him

Id find out returned Hiram laughing Youd better spend your money
that way than for a horse and buggy Thats the highest ambition of most
boys in the country

The labor of bushing and grubbing these acres of lowland was no light
one Hiram insisted that every stub and root be removed that a heavy
plow could not tear out They had made some progress by noon however
when Sister came down with their dinner

Hiram built a campfire over which the coffee was reheated and the
three ate together Sister enjoying the picnic to the full She insisted
on helping in the work by piling the brush and roots into heaps for
burning and she remained until midafternoon

I like that Henry boy she confided to Hiram He dont pull my braids
or poke fun at me

But Sister was developing and growing fast these days She was putting
on flesh and color showed in her cheeks They were no longer hollow and
sallow and she ran like a coltand was almost as wild

The work of clearing the bottom land could not be continued daily but
the boys got in three full days that week and Saturday morning Henry
did not wish to work on Saturday afternoon for in this locality almost
all the farmers knocked off work at noon Saturday and went to town

But when Henry shouldered his tools to go home at noon Sister appeared
as usual with the lunch and she and Hiram cut fishing rods and planned
to have a real picnic

Trout and mullet were jumping in the pools under the bank and they
caught several before stopping to eat their own meal The freshly caught
fish were a fine addition to the repast

They went back to fishing after a while and caught enough for supper at
the farmhouse Just as they were reeling up their lines the silence of
the place was disturbed by a strange sound

Theres a motorcycle coming cried Sister jumping up and looking all
around

There was a bend in the river below this bottom and another above so
they could not see far in either direction unless they climbed to the
high ground For a minute Hiram could not tell in which direction the
sound was coming but he knew the steady putputput must be the exhaust
of a motorboat

It soon poked its nose around the lower turn It was a goodsized boat
and instantly Hiram recognized at least one person aboard

Miss Lettie Bronson in a very pretty boating costume was in the bow
There were half a dozen other girls with herwell dressed girls who
were evidently her friends from the St Beris school at Scoville

Oh oh what a pretty spot cried Lettie on the instant Well go
ashore here and have our luncheon girls

She did not see Hiram and Sister for a moment but the latter tugged at
Hirams sleeve

Ive seen that girl before she whispered She came in the carriage
with the man who spoke to youyou remember She asked me if I had
always lived in the country and how I tore my frock

Isnt she pretty returned Hiram

Awfully But Im not sure that I like her yet

Suddenly Lettie saw Hiram and the girl beside him She started flushed
a little and then gave Hiram a cool little nod and turned her gaze from
him Her manner showed that he was not down in her good books and the
young fellow flushed in turn

I dont know as wed better try to make the bank here Miss said the
man who was directing the motorboat The currents mighty sharp

I want to land here said Lettie decidedly Its the prettiest spot
weve seenisnt it girls

Her friends agreed Hiram casting a quick eye over the ruffled surface
of the river saw that the man was right How well the stream below was
fitted for motorboating he did not know but he was pretty sure that
there were too many ledges just under the surface here to make it safe
for the boat to go farther

I intend to land hereright by that big tree commanded Lettie
Bronson stamping her foot

Well I dunno drawled the man and just then the bow of the boat
swung around was forced heavily down stream by the current and slam it
went against a reef

The man shot off the engine instantly The bow of the boat was lodged
on the rock and tiptilted considerably The girls screamed and Lettie
herself was almost thrown into the water for she was standing



CHAPTER XVII MR PEPPER APPEARS

But Hiram noted again that Lettie Bronson did not display terror While
her friends were screaming and crying she sat perfectly quiet and for
a minute said never a word

Cant you back off Hi heard her ask the boatman

Not without lightening her Miss And she may have smashed a plank up
there too I dunno

The Western girl turned immediately to Hiram who had now come to the
banks edge She smiled at him charmingly and her eyes danced She
evidently appreciated the fact that the young farmer had her at a
disadvantageand she had meant to snub him

I guess youll have to help me again Mr Strong she said What will
we do Can you push out a plank to us or something

Im afraid not Miss Bronson he returned I could cut a pole and
reach it to the boat but you girls couldnt walk ashore on it

Oh dear have we got to wade cried one of Letties friends

You cant wade Its too deep between the shore and the boat Hiram
said calmly

Thenthen well stay here till the tide rises and drdrdrowns us
wailed another of the girls giving way to sobs

Dont be a goose Myra Carroll exclaimed Lettie If you waited here
for the tide to rise youd be grayhaired and decrepit The tide doesnt
rise here But maybe a spring flood would wash you away

At that the frightened one sobbed harder than ever She was one of
those who ever see the dark side of adventure There was no hope on her
horizon

I dunno what you can do for these girls said the man Id git out
and push off the boat but I dont dare with them aboard

But Hirams mind had not been inactive if he was standing in seeming
idleness Sister tugged at his sleeve again and whispered

Have they got to stay there and drown Hi

I guess not he returned slowly Lets see this old sycamore
leans right out over them I can shin up there with the aid of the big
grapevine Then if I had a rope

Shall I run and get one demanded Sister listening to him

Hullo exclaimed Hiram speaking to the man in the boat

Well asked the fellow

Havent you got a coil of strong rope aboard

Theres the painter said the man

Toss it ashore here commanded Hiram

Oh Hiram Strong cried Lettie You dont expect us to walk
tightrope do you and she began to giggle

No I want you to unfasten the end of the rope I want it clearthats
it said Hiram And its long enough I can see

For what asked Sister

Wait and youll see returned the young farmer hastily coiling the
rope again

He hung it over his shoulder and then started to climb the big sycamore
He could go up the bole of this leaning tree very quickly for the huge
grapevine gave him a handhold all the way

Whatever are you going to do cried Lettie Bronson looking up at him
as did the other girls

Now said Hiram in the first small crotch of the tree which was
almost directly over the stranded launch if you girls have any pluck
at all I can get you ashore one by one

What do you mean for us to do Hiram repeated Lettie

The young farmer quickly fashioned a noose at the end of the linenot a
slipnoose for that would tighten and hurt anybody bearing upon it This
he dropped down to the boat and Lettie caught it

Get your head and shoulders through that noose Miss Bronson he
commanded Let it come under your arms I will lift you out of the boat
and swing you back and forththeres none of you so heavy that I cant
do this and if you wet your feet a little whats the odds

Oh dear I can never do that squealed one of the other girls

Guess youll have to do it if you dont want to stay here all night
returned Lettie promptly I see what you want Hiram she added and
quickly adjusted the loop

Now when you swing out over the bank Sister will grab you and steady
you It will be all right if you have a care Now cried Hiram

Lettie Bronson showed no fear at all as he drew her up and she swung
out of the boat over the swiftlyrunning current Hiram laid along the
treetrunk in an easy position and began swinging the girl at the end
of the rope like a pendulum

The river bank being at least three feet higher than the surface of the
water he did not have to shift the rope again as he swung the girl back
and forth

Sister clinging with her left hand to the grapevine leaned forward and
clutched Letties hand When she seized it Sister backed away and the
swinging girl landed upright upon the bank

Oh thats fun Lettie cried laughing loosing herself from the
loop Now you come Mary Judson

Thus encouraged they responded one by one and even the girl who had
broken down and cried agreed to be rescued by this simple means The
boatman then after removing his shoes and stockings and rolling up his
trousers stepped out upon the sunken rock and pushed off the boat

But it was leaking badly He dared not take aboard his passengers again
but turned around and went down stream as fast as he could go so as to
beach the boat in a safe place

Now howll we get back to Scoville cried one of Letties friends I
can never walk that far

Sister had dropped back shyly behind Hiram when he descended the
tree She had aided each girl ashore but only Lettie had thanked her
Now she tugged at Hirams sleeve

Take em home in our wagon she whispered

I can take you to Scovilleor to Miss Bronsonsin the farm wagon
Hiram said smiling You can sit on straw in the bottom and be
comfortable

Oh a straw ride cried Lettie What fun And he can drive us right
to St BerisAnd think what the other girls will say and how theyll
stare

The idea seemed a happy one to all the girls save the crybaby Myra
Carroll And her complaints were drowned in the laughter and chatter of
the others

Hiram picked up the tools Sister got the string of fish and they set
out for the Atterson farmhouse Lettie chatted most of the way with
Hiram but to Sister walking on the other side of the young farmer the
Western girl never said a word

At the house it was the same While Hiram was cleaning the wagon and
putting a bed of straw into it and currying the horse and gearing him
to the wagon Mrs Atterson brought a crock of cookies out upon the
porch and talked with the girls from St Beris Sister had run indoors
and changed her shabby and soiled frock for a new gingham but when she
came down to the porch and stood bashfully in the doorway none of the
girls from town spoke to her

Hiram drove up with the farmwagon Most of the girls had accepted the
adventure in the true spirit now and they climbed into the wagonbed
on the clean straw with laughter and jokes But nobody invited Sister to
join the party

The orphan looked wistfully after the wagon as Hiram drove out of
the yard Then she turned with trembling lip to Mother Atterson
Sheshes awfully pretty she said and Hiram likes her But
shetheyre all proud and I guess they dont think much of folks like
us after all

Shucks Sister were just good as they be every bit returned Mrs
Atterson bruskly

I know mebbe we be admitted Sister slowly But it dont feel so

And perhaps Hiram had some such thought too after he had driven the
girls to the big boarding school in Scoville For they all got out
without even thanking him or bidding him goodbyeall save Lettie

Really we are a thousand times obliged to you Hiram Strong she
said in her very best manner and offering him her hand As the girls
were my guests I felt I must get them home again safelyand you were
indeed a friend in need

But then she spoiled it utterly by adding

Now how much do I owe you Hiram and took out her purse Is two
dollars enough This put Hiram right in his place He saw plainly that
friendly as the Bronsons were they did not look upon a common farmboy
as their equalnot in social matters at least

I could not take anything for doing a neighbor a favor Miss Bronson
said Hiram quietly Thank you Goodday

Hiram drove back home feeling quite as depressed as Sister perhaps
Finally he said to himself

Well some day Ill show em

After that he put the matter out of his mind and refused to be troubled
by thoughts of Lettie Bronson or her attitude toward him

Spring was advancing apace now Every day saw the development of bud
leaf and plant Slowly the lowland was cleared and the brush and roots
were heaped in great piles ready for the torch

Hiram could not depend upon this six acres as their only piece of
corn however There was the fouracre lot between the barnyard and the
pasture in which he proposed to plant the staple crop

He drew out the remainder of the coarse manure and spread it upon this
land as far as it would go For enriching the remainder of the corn
crop he would have to depend upon a commercial fertilizer He drew too
a couple of tons of lime to be used on this corn land and left it in
heaps to slake

And then out of the clear sky of their progress came a bolt as
unexpected as could be They had been less than a month upon the farm
Uncle Jeptha had not been in his grave thirty days and Hiram was just
getting into the work of running the place with success looming ahead

He had refused Mr Bronsons offer of a position and had elected to
stick by Mrs Atterson He had looked forward to nothing to disturb the
contract between them until the time should be fulfilled

Yet one afternoon while he was at work in the garden Sister came out
to him all in a flurry

Mis Atterson wants you Mis Atterson wants you cried the girl Oh
Hiram something dreadfuls going to happen I know by the way Mis
Atterson looks And I don like the looks o that man thats come to see
her

Hiram unhooked the horse at the end of the row and left Sister to lead
him to the stable He went into the house after knocking the mud off his
boots

There sitting in the bright kitchen was the sharpfeatured
snakylooking man with whom Hiram had once talked in town He knew his
name was Pepper and that he did something in the real estate line and
insurance and the like

Jest listen to what this man says Hiram said Mrs Atterson grimly

My names Pepper began the man eyeing Hiram curiously

So I hear returned the young farmer

Before old Mr Atterson died we got to talking one day when he was in
town about his selling

Well returned Hiram You didnt say anything about that when you
offered twelve hundred for this place

Well said the man stubbornly that was a good offer

Hiram turned to Mrs Atterson Do you want to sell for that price

No I dont Hi she said

Then that settles it doesnt it Mrs Atterson is the owner and she
knows her own mind

I made Uncle Jeptha a better offer said Mr Pepper and Ill make
Mrs Atterson the samesixteen hundred dollars Its a rundown farm
of course

If Mrs Atterson doesnt want to sell interrupted Hiram but here his
employer intervened

Theres something more Hi she said her face working strangely
Tell him you Pepper

Why the old man gave me an option on the place and I risked a twenty
dollar bill on it The option hadera year to run dated February
tenth last and Ive decided to take the option up said Mr Pepper
his shrewd little eyes dancing in their gaze from Hiram to the old lady
and back again



CHAPTER XVIII A HEAVY CLOUD

Now a rattlesnake is poisonous but he gives fair warning a swamp
moccasin lies in wait for the unwary and strikes without sign or sound
Into Hiram Strongs troubled mind came the thought that Mr Pepper was
striking like his prototype of the swamps

A snaky sort of a man was Mr Peppersly a handrubber as he talked
with a little sickly grin playing about his thin mean mouth When he
opened it Hiram almost expected to see a forked tongue run out

At least of one thing was the young farmer sure Mr Pepper was no more
to be trusted than a serpent Therefore he did not take a word that the
man said on trust

He recovered from the shock which the statement of the real estate man
had caused and he uttered no expression of either surprise or trouble
Mrs Atterson he could see was vastly disturbed by the statement but
somebody had to keep a cool bead in this matter

Lets see your option Hiram demanded bruskly

Whyif Mrs Atterson wishes to see it

You show it to Hi you Pepperman snapped the old lady I wouldnt
do a thing without his advice

Oh well if you consider a boys advice material

I know His honest declared the old lady tartly And thats what
Im sure you aint Besides she added sadly His as much interested
in this thing as I be If the farms got to be sold it puts Hi out of a
job

Oh very well said the real estate man and he drew a rather soiled
folded paper from his inner pocket

He seemed to hesitate the fraction of a second about showing the paper
It increased His suspicionthis hesitancy If the man had a perfectly
good option on the farm why didnt he go about the matter boldly

But when he got the paper in his own hands he could see nothing wrong
with it It seemed written in straightforward language the signatures
were clear enough and as he had seen and read Uncle Jepthas will
he was quite sure that this was the old mans signature to the option
which for the sum of twenty dollars in hand paid to him he agreed to
sell his farm situated soandso for sixteen hundred dollars cash
same to be paid over within one year of date

Of course said Hiram slowly handing back the paperindeed Pepper
had kept the grip of his forefinger and thumb on it all the timeOf
course Mrs Attersons lawyer must see this before she agrees to
anything

Why Hiram I aint got no lawyer exclaimed the old lady

Go to Mr Strickland who made Uncle Jepthas will Hiram said to her
Then he turned to Pepper

Whats the name of the witness to that old mans signature

Abel Pollock

Oh Henrys father

Yes Hes got a son named Henry

And whos the Notary Public

Caleb Schell He keeps the store just at the crossroads as you go into
town

I remember the store said Hiram thoughtfully

But Hiram cried Mrs Atterson I dont want to sell the farm

Well be sure this paper is all straight before you do sell Mrs
Atterson

Why I just wont sell she exclaimed Uncle Jeptha never said
nothing in his will about giving this option And that lawyer says that
in a couple of years the farm will be worth a good deal more than this
Pepper offers

Why Mrs Atterson exclaimed the real estate man cheerfully as
property is selling in this locality now sixteen hundred dollars is a
mighty good offer for your farm You ask anybody Why Uncle Jeptha knew
it was otherwise he wouldnt have given me the option for he didnt
believe Id come up with the price He knew it was a high offer

And if its worth so much to you why isnt it worth more to Mrs
Atterson to keep demanded Hiram sharply

Ah thats my secretwhy I want it said Pepper nodding Leave that
to me If I get bit by buying it I shall have to suffer for my lack of
wisdom

You aint bought it yetyou Pepper snapped Mrs Atterson

But Im going to buy it maam replied he rather viciously as he
stood up ready to depart I shall expect to hear from you no later
than Monday

I wont sell it

Youll have to If you refuse to sign Ill go to the Chancery Court
Ill make you

Well Mebbe you will But I dont know I never was made to do anything
yet By no man named Pepperyou can take that home with you she flung
after him as he walked out and climbed into the buggy

But whereas Mrs Atterson showed anger Hiram went back to work in the
field with a much deeper feeling racking his mind If the option was all
rightand of course it must bethis would settle their occupancy of
the farm

Of course he could not hold Mrs Atterson to her contract She could not
help the situation that had now arisen

His Springs work had gone for nothing Sixteen hundred dollars even in
cash would not be any great sum for the old lady And she had burdened
herself with the support of Sisterand with Old Lem Camp too

Surely I cant be a burden on her Ill have to hustle around and find
another job I wonder if Mr Bronson would take me on now

But he knew that the Westerner already had a man who suited him since
Hiram had refused the chance Bronson offered And then Lettie had
shown that she felt he had not appreciated their offer Perhaps her
father felt the same way

Besides Hiram had a secret wish not to put himself under obligation
to the Bronsons This feeling may have sprung from a foolish source
nevertheless it was strong with the young farmer

It looked very much to him as though this sudden turn of circumstances
was a facer If Mrs Atterson had to sell the farm he was likely to be
thrown on his own resources again

For his own selfish sake Hiram was worried too After all he would
be unable to make good and to show people that he could make the old
rundown farm pay a profit to its owner

But Hiram Strong couldnt believe it

The more he milled over the thing in his mind the less he understood
why Uncle Jeptha who was of acute mind right up to the hour of his
death so all the neighbors said should have neglected to speak about
the option he had given Pepper on the farm

And here they were right in the middle of the Spring work with crops
in the ground andas Mrs Atterson agreedit would be too late to go
hunting a farm for this present season

But Hiram kept to work He had Sister and Old Lem Camp out in the
garden handweeding and thinning the carrots onions and other tender
plants That Saturday he went through the entire gardenthat part
already plantedwith either the horse cultivator or his wheelhoe

In planting parsnips carrots and other slowgerminating seeds he had
mixed a few radish seed in the seeding machine these sprang up quickly
and defined the rows so that the space between rows could be cultivated
before the other plants had scarcely broke the surface of the soil

Now these radish were beginning to be big enough to pull Hiram brought
in a few bunches for their dinner on Saturdaythe first fruits of the
garden

Now I dunno why it is said Mrs Atterson complacently after
setting her teeth in the first radish and relishing its crispness
but this seems a whole lot better than the radishes we used to buy in
Crawberry I spect whats your very own always seems better than other
folkss and she sighed and shook her head

She was thinking of the thing she had to face on Monday Hiram hated to
see them all so downhearted Sisters eyes were red from weeping Old
Lem Camp sat at the table muttering and playing with his food again
instead of eating

But Hiram felt as though he could not give up to the disaster that had
come to them The thought thatin some wayPepper was taking an unfair
advantage of Mother Atterson knocked continually at the door of his
mind

He went over to himself all that had passed in the kitchen the day
before when the real estate man had come to speak with Mrs Atterson
How had Pepper spoken about the option Hadnt there been some hesitancy
in the fellows mannerin his speech indeed Just what had Pepper
said Hiram concentrated his mind upon this one thing What had the man
said

The option haderone year to run

Those were the fellows very words He hesitated before he pronounced
the length of time And he was not a man who in speaking had any
stammering of tongue

Why had he hesitated Why should it trouble him to state the time limit
of the option

Was it because he was speaking a falsehood

The thought stung Hiram like a thorn in the flesh He put away the tool
with which he was working slipped on a coat and started for Henry
Pollocks house which lay not more than half a mile from the Atterson
farm across the fields



CHAPTER XIX THE REASON WHY

HIRAM found Abel Pollock mending harness in the shed Hiram opened his
business bluntly and told the farmer what was up Mr Pollock scratched
his head listened attentively and then sat down to digest the news

You gotter movejest when youve got rightly settled on that place
he demanded Well thats tarnal bad And from what Henry tells me
youre a young feller with idees too

I dont care so much for myself Hiram hastened to say Its Mrs
Atterson Im thinking about And she had just made up her mind that she
was anchored for the rest of her life Besides I dont think it is a
wise thing to sell the property at that price

No I wouldnt sell if I was her for no sixteen hundred dollars

But shes got to you see Mr Pollock Pepper has the option signed by
her Uncle Jeptha

Jeptha Atterson was no fool interrupted Pollock I cant understand
his giving an option on the farm with all this talk of the railroad
crossing the river

But Mr Pollock exclaimed Hiram eagerly you must know all about
this option You signed as a witness to Uncle Jepthas signature

No you dont mean that exclaimed the farmer My name to it too

Yes And it was signed before Caleb Schell the notary public

So it wasso it was boy declared the other suddenly smiting his
knee I remember I witnessed Uncle Jepthas signature once But that
was way back there in the winterbefore he was took sick

Yes sir said Hiram eagerly

That was an option on the old farm So it was But goodness me boy
Pepper must have got him to renew it or something That option wouldnt
have run till now

Hiram told him the date the paper was executed

Thats right by Jo It was in February

And it was for a year

Mr Pollock stared at him in silence evidently thinking deeply

If you remember all about it then Hiram continued its hardly
worth while going to Mr Schell I suppose

I remember all right said Pollock slowly It was all done right
there in Cale Schells store It was one rainy afternoon There was
several of us sitting around Cales stove Pepper was one of us In
comes Uncle Jeptha Pepper got after him right away but sort of on the
quiet to one side

I heard em Pepper had made him an offer for the farm that was way
down low and the old man laughed at him

We hadnt none of us heard then the talk that came later about the
railroad But Pepper has a brotherinlaw whos in the office of the
company and he thinks he gits inside information

So for some reason he thought the railroad was going to touch
Uncle Jepthas farm O course it aint Its goin over the river by
Ayertown

I dont see what Pepper wants to take up the option for anyway Unless
he sees that youre likely to make suthin out o the old place and
mebbe hes got a city feller on the string to buy it

It doesnt matter what his reason is Mrs Atterson doesnt want to
sell and if that option is all right she must said Hiram And you
are sure Uncle Jeptha gave it for twelve months

Twelve months ejaculated Pollock suddenly Whynothat dont seem
right stammered the farmer scratching his head

But thats the way the option reads

Wellmebbe I didnt just read it myselfno sir They jest says to
me

Come here Pollock and witness these signatures So I done
itthats all But I see Cale put on his specs and read the durn thing
through before he stamped it Yes sir Cales the carefulest notary
public we ever had around here

Say said Mr Pollock You go to Cale and ask him It dont seem to
me the old man give Pepper so long a time

For how long was the option to run then queried Hiram excitedly



Wal I wouldnt wanter say I dont wanter git inter trouble with no
neighbor If Cale says a year is all right then Ill say so too I
wouldnt jest trust my memory

But there is some doubt in your mind Mr Pollock

There is A good deal of doubt the farmer assured him But you ask
Cale

This was all that Hiram could get out of the elder Pollock It was not
very comforting The young farmer was of two minds whether he should see
Caleb Schell or not

But when he got back to the house for supper and saw the doleful faces
of the three waiting there he couldnt stand inaction

If you dont mind I want to go to town tonight Mrs Atterson he
told the old lady

All right Hiram I expect youve got to look out for yourself boy
If you can get another job you take it Its a tarnal shame you didnt
take up with that Bronsons offer when he come here after you

You neednt feel so said Hiram Youre no more at fault than I am
This thing just happenednobody could foretell it And Im just as
sorry as I can be for you Mother Atterson

The old woman wiped her eyes

Well Hi theres other things in this world to worry over besides
gravy I find she said Some folks is born for trouble and mebbe
were some of that kind

It was not exactly Mr Pollocks doubts that sent Hiram Strong down
to the crossroads store that evening For the farmer had seemed so
uncertain that the boy couldnt trust to his memory at all

No It was Hirams remembrance of Peppers stammering when he spoke
about the option He hesitated to pronounce the length of time the
option had been drawn for Was it because he knew there was some trick
about the timelimit

Had the real estate man fooled old Uncle Jeptha in the beginning The
dead man had been very shrewd and careful Everybody said so

He was conscious and of acute mind right up to his death If there was
an option on the farm be surely would have said something about it to
Mr Strickland or to some of the neighbors

It looked to Hiram as though the old farmer must have believed that the
option had expired before the day of his death

Had Pepper only got the old mans promise for a shorter length of time
but substituted the paper reading one year when it was signed Was
that the mystery

However Hiram could not see how that would help Mrs Atterson for even
testimony of witnesses who heard the discussion between the dead man and
the real estate agent could not controvert a written instrument The
young fellow knew that

He harnessed the old horse to the light wagon and drove to the
crossroads store kept by Caleb Schell Many of the country people liked
to trade with this man because his store was a social gatheringplace

Around a hot stove in the winter and a cold stove at this time of year
the men gathered to discuss the state of the country local politics
their neighbors business and any other topic which was suggested to
their more or less idle minds

On the outskirts of the group of older loafers the growing crop of men
who would later take their places in the soapbox forum lingered while
skylarking about the verge of the crowd were smaller boys who were
learning no good to say the least in attaching themselves to the older
members of the company

There will always be certain men in every community who take delight in
poisoning the minds of the younger generation We muzzle dogs or shoot
them when they go mad The foulmouthed man is far more vicious than the
dog and should be impounded

Hiram hitched his horse to the rack before the store and entered the
crowded place The fumes of tobacco smoke vinegar cheese and various
other commodities gave a distinctive flavor to Caleb Schells storeand
not a pleasant one to Hirams mind

Ordinarily he would have made any purchases he had to make and gone out
at once But Schell was busy with several customers at the counter and
he was forced to wait a chance to speak with the old man

One of the first persons Hiram saw in the store was young Pete
Dickerson hanging about the edge of the crowd Pete scowled at him and
moved away One of the men holding down a crackerkeg sighted Hiram and
hailed him in a jovial tone

Hi there Mr Strong Whats this we been hearin about you They
say you had a runin with Sam Dickerson We been tryin to git the
perticlars out o Pete here but he dont seem ter wanter talk about
it and the man guffawed heartily

Hear ye made Sam give back the tools he borrowed of the old man said
another man whom Hiram knew to be Mrs Larripers soninlaw

You are probably misinformed said Hiram quietly I know no reason
why Mr Dickerson and I should have troubleunless other neighbors make
trouble for us

Right boyright called Cale Schell from behind the counter where
he could hear and comment upon all that went on in the middle of the
room despite the attention he had to give to his customers

Well if you can git along with Sam and Pete youll do well laughed
another of the group

The Dickersons seemed to be in disfavor in the community and nobody
cared whether Pete repeated what was said to his father or not

I was told pursued the first speaker screwing up one eye and
grinning at Hiram that you broke Sams gun over his head and chased
Pete a mile That right son

You will get no information from me returned Hiram tartly

Why Pete ought to be big enough to lick you alone Strong continued
the tantalizer Hey Pete Dont sneak out Come and tell us why you
didnt give this chap the lickin you said you was going to

Pete only glared at him and slunk out of the store Hiram turned his
back on the whole crowd and waited at the end of the counter for Mr
Schell The storekeeper was a tall portly man with a gray mustache and
sidewhiskers and a high bald forehead

What can I do for you Mr Strong he asked finally having got rid of
the customers who preceded Hiram

Hiram in a low voice explained his mission Schell nodded his head at
once

Oh yes he said I remember about the option I had forgotten it
for a fact but Pepper was in here yesterday talking about it He had
been to your house

Then sir to the best of your remembrance the option is all right

Oh certainly Pollock witnessed it and I put my seal on it Yes sir
Pepper can make the old lady sell Its too bad if she wants to remain
there but the price he is to pay isnt so bad

You have no reason to doubt the validity of the option cried Hiram
in desperation

Assuredly not

Then why didnt Uncle Jeptha speak of it to somebody before he died if
the option had not run out at that time

Humph

You grant the old man was of sound mind

Sound as a pine knot agreed the storekeeper still reflective

Then how is it he did not speak to his lawyer about the option when he
saw Mr Strickland within an hour of his death

That does seem peculiar admitted the storekeeper slowly

And Mr Pollock says he thinks there is something wrong about the
option went on Hiram eagerly

Oh Pollock Pah returned Schell I dont suppose he even read it

But you did

Assuredly I always read every paper If they dont want me to know
what the agreement is they can take it to some other Notary declared
the storekeeper with a jolly laugh

And you are sure that the option was to run a year

Of course the options all rightHold on A year did you say
Whyseems to melets look this thing up concluded Caleb Schell
suddenly

He dived into his little office and produced a ledger from the safe
This he slapped down on the counter between them

Im a careful man I am he told Hiram And I flatter myself Ive got
a good memory too Pepper was in here yesterday sputtering about the
option and I remember now that he spoke of its running a year

But it seems to me said Schell pawing over the leaves of his ledger
that the talk between him and old Uncle Jeptha was for a short time
The old man was mighty cautiousmighty cautious

Thats what Mr Pollock says cried Hiram eagerly

But youve seen the option

Yes

And it reads a year

Oh yes

Then how you going to get around that demanded Schell with
conviction

But perhaps Uncle Jeptha signed the option thinking it was for a
shorter time

That wouldnt help you none The paper was signed And why should
Pepper have buncoed himat that time

Why should he be so eager to get the farm now asked Hiram

Well Ill tell you It aint out yet But two or three days ago the
railroad board abandoned the route through Ayertown and it is agreed
that the new bridge will be built along there by your farm somewhere

The river is as narrow there as it is anywhere for miles up and down
and they will stretch a bridge from the high bank on your side across
the meadows to the high bank on the other side It will cut out grades
you see Thats what has started Pepper up to grab off the farm while
the option is valid

But Mr Schell is the option valid cried Hiram anxiously

I dont see how youre going to get around it Ah heres the place
When I have sealed a paper I make a note of itwhat the matter was
about and who the contracting parties were Ive done that for years
Letmesee

He adjusted his spectacles He squinted at the page covered closely
with writing Hiram saw him whispering the words he read to himself
Suddenly the blood flooded into the old mans face and he looked up
with a start at his interrogator

Do you mean to say that options for a year he demanded

That is the way it readsnow whispered Hiram watching him closely

The old man turned the book around slowly on the counter His stubbed
finger pointed to the two or three scrawled lines written in a certain
place

Hiram read them slowly with beating heart



CHAPTER XX AN ENEMY IN THE DARK

The whispered conference between Hiram Strong and the storekeeper could
not be heard by the curious crowd around the cold stove nor did it last
for long

Caleb Schell finally closed his ledger and put it away Hiram shook
hands with him and walked out

On the platform outside which was illuminated by a single smoky
lantern a group of small boys were giggling and they watched Hiram
unhitch the old horse and climb into the spring wagon with so much
hilarity that the young farmer expected some trick

The horse started off all right he missed nothing from the wagon and
so he supposed that he was mistaken The boys had merely been laughing
at him because he was a stranger

But as Hiram got some few yards from the hitching rack the seat was
suddenly pulled from under him and he was left sprawling on his back in
the bottom of the wagon

A yell of derision from the crowd outside the store assured him that
this was the cause of the boys hilarity Luckily his old horse was of
quiet disposition and he stopped dead in his tracks when the seat flew
out of the back of the wagon

A joke is a joke No use in showing wrath over this foolish amusement of
the crossroads boys But Hiram got a little the best of them after all

The youngsters had scattered when the accident occurred Hiram
getting out to pick up the seat found the end of a strong hemp line
fastened to it The other end was tied to the hitching rack in front of
the store

Instead of casting off the line from the seat Hiram walked back to the
store and cast that end off

At any rate Im in a good coil of hemp rope he said to one of the
men who had come out to see the fun The fellow who owns it can come
and prove property but I shall ask a few questions of him

There was no more laughter The young farmer walked back to his wagon
set up the seat again and drove on

The roadway was dark but having been used all his life to country
roads at night Hiram had no difficulty in seeing the path before him
Besides the old horse knew his way home

He drove on some eighth of a mile Suddenly he felt that the wagon
was not running true One of the wheels was yawing He drew in the old
horse but he was not quick enough

The nigh forward wheel rolled off the end of the axle and down came the
wagon with a crash

Hiram was thrown forward and came sprawlingon hands and kneesupon
the ground while the wheel rolled into the ditch He was little hurt
although the accident might have been serious

And in truth he knew it to be no accident A burr does not easily work
off the end of an axle He had greased the old wagon just before he
started for the store and he knew he had replaced each nut carefully

This was a deliberately malicious trickno boys joke like the tying of
the rope to his wagon seat And the axle was broken Although he had
no lantern he could see that the wagon could not be used again without
being repaired

Who did it was Hirams unspoken question as he slowly unharnessed
the old horse and then dragged the broken wagon entirely out of the
road so that it would not be an obstruction for other vehicles

His mind set instantly upon Pete Dickerson He had not seen the boy
when he came out of the crossroads store If the fellow had removed this
burr he had done it without anybody seeing him and had then run home

The young farmer much disturbed over this incident mounted the back
of the old horse and paced home He only told Mrs Atterson that he had
met with an accident and that the light wagon would have to be repaired
before it could be used again

That necessitated their going to town on Monday in the heavy wagon And
Hiram dragged the spring wagon to the blacksmith shop for repairs on
the way

But before that the enemy in the dark had struck again When Hiram
went to the barnyard to water the stock Sunday morning he found that
somebody had been bothering the pump

The bucket or pumpvalve was gone He had to take it apart cut a new
valve out of sole leather and put the pump together again

Well have to get a cross dog if we remain here he told Mrs
Atterson There is somebody in the neighborhood who means us harm

Them Dickersons exclaimed Mrs Atterson

Perhaps That Pete maybe If I once caught him up to his tricks Id
make him sorry enough

Tell the constable Hi cried Sister angrily

That would make trouble for his folks Maybe they dont know just how
mean Pete is A good thrashingand the threat of another every time he
did anything meanwould do him lots more good

This wasnt nice Sunday work but it was too far to carry water from the
house to the horse trough so Hiram had to repair the pump

On Monday morning he routed out Sister and Mr Camp at daybreak He had
been up and out for an hour himself and on a bench under the shed he
had heaped two or three bushels of radishes which he had pulled and
washed ready for bunching

He showed his helpers how the pretty scarlet balls were to be bunched
and found that Sister took hold of the work with nimble fingers while
Mr Camp did very well at the unaccustomed task

I dont know Hi said Mrs Atterson despondently that its worth
while your trying to sell any of the truck if were going to leave here
so soon

We havent left yet he returned trying to speak cheerfully And you
might as well get every penny back that you can Perhaps an arrangement
can be made whereby we can stay and harvest the garden crop at any
rate

You can make up your mind that that Pepper man wont give us any
leeway he isnt that kind declared Mother Atterson with conviction

Hiram made a quick sale of the radishes at several of the stores where
he got eighteen cents a dozen bunches but some he sold at the big
boardingschoolSt Berisat a retail price

You can bring any other fresh vegetables you may have from time
to time the housekeeper told him Nobody ever raised any early
vegetables about Scoville before They are very welcome

Once we get agoing said Hiram to Mrs Atterson you or Sister can
drive in with the spring wagon and dispose of the surplus vegetables
And you might get a small canning outfitthey come as cheap as fifteen
dollarsand put up tomatoes corn peas beans and other things Good
canned stuff always sells well

Good Land o Goshen Hiram exclaimed the old lady in desperation
You talk jest as though we were going to stay on the farm

Well lets go and see Mr Strickland replied the young farmer and
they set out for the lawyers office

Mrs Atterson sat in the anteroom while Hiram asked to speak with the
old lawyer in private for a minute The conference was not for long and
when Hiram came back to his employer he said

Mr Strickland has sent his junior clerk out for Pepper He thinks wed
better talk the matter over quietly And he wants to see the option
too

Oh Hiram There aint no hope is there groaned the old lady

Well I tell you what exclaimed the young fellow we wont give in
to him until we have to Of course if you refuse to sign a deed he
can go to chancery and in the end you will have to pay the costs of the
action

But perhaps even at that it might be well to hold him off until you
have got the present crop out of the ground

Oh I wont go to law said Mrs Atterson decidedly No good ever
come of that

After a time Mr Strickland invited them both into his private office
The attorney spoke quietly of other matters while they waited for
Pepper

But the real estate man did not appear By and by Mr Stricklands clerk
came back with the report that Pepper had been called away suddenly on
important business

They tell me he went Saturday said the clerk He may not be back
for a week But he said he was going to buy the Atterson place when he
returnedhes told several people around town so

Ah said Mr Strickland slowly Then he has left that threat
hanging like the Sword of Damoclesover Mrs Attersons head

I dont know nothin about that sword Mr Strickland nor no
other sword cept a rusty one that my father carried when he was a
hosssodger in the Rebellion declared Mother Atterson nervously But
if that Pepper mans got one belonging to Mr Damocles I shouldnt be
at all surprised That Pepper looked to me like a man that would take
anything he could lay his hands onif he warnt watched

Which is a true and just interpretation of Peppers character I
believe observed the lawyer smiling

And weve got to give up the farm at his saysoat any time demanded
the old lady

If his option is good said Mr Strickland But I want to see the
paperand I can assure you Mrs Atterson that I shall subject it to
the closest possible scrutiny

There is a possibility that Peppers option may be questioned before
the courts Do not build too many hopes on this he added quickly
seeing the old ladys face light up

You have a very good champion in this young man and the lawyer nodded
at Hiram

He suspected all was not right with the option and he has dug up the
fact that the witness to your uncles signature and the man before whom
the paper was attested both believed the option was for a short time

Caleb Schells book shows that it was for thirty days Uncle Jeptha
undoubtedly thought it was for that length of time and therefore the
option expired several days before he died

Mr Pepper may have fallen under temptation He considered heretofore
like everybody else that the railroad would pass us by in this section
Pepper gambled twenty dollars on its coming along the boundary of the
Atterson farmbetween you and Darrells tractand thought he had lost

Then suddenly the railroad board turned square around and voted for the
condemnation of the original route Pepper remembered the option he had
risked twenty dollars on If it was originally for thirty days it was
void of course but Uncle Jeptha is dead and he hopes perhaps that
nobody else will dispute the validity of it

Its a forgery then cried Mrs Atterson

It may be a forgery We do not know said the lawyer hastily At any
rate he has the paper and he is a shrewd rascal

Mrs Attersons face was a study

Do you mean to tell me we have got to lose the farm she demanded

My dear lady that I cannot tell you I must see this option We must
put it to the test

But Schell and Pollock will testify that the option was for thirty
days cried Hiram

Perhaps To the best of their remembrance and belief it was for
thirty days A shrewd lawyer howeverand Pepper would employ a shrewd
onewould turn their evidence inside out

No evidencein theory at leastcan controvert a written instrument
signed sealed and delivered Even Cale Schells memoranda book cannot
be taken as evidence save in a contributory way It is not direct It
is the carelessly scribbled record in pencil of a busy man

No If Pepper puts forward the option we have got to see if that
option has been tampered withthe paper itself I mean If the fellow
substituted a different instrument at the time of signing from the one
Uncle Jeptha thought he signed you have no caseI tell you frankly my
dear lady

Then it aint no use We got to lose the place Hiram said Mrs
Atterson when they left the lawyers office

I wouldnt lose heart If Pepper is scared he may not trouble you
again

Its got ten months more to run said she He can keep us guessin all
that time

That is so agreed Hiram nodding thoughtfully But of course as
Mr Strickland says by raising a doubt as to the validity of the option
we can hold him off for a whilemaybe until we have made this years
crop

Its goin to make me lay awake o nights sighed the old lady And
I thought Id got through with that when I stopped worryin about the
gravy

Well we wont talk about next year agreed Hiram Ill do the best I
can for you through this season if Pepper will let us alone Weve got
the bottom land practically cleared we might as well plough it and put
in the corn there If we make a crop youll get all your money back and
more Mr Strickland told me privately that the option unless it read
that way would not cover the crops in the ground And I read the option
carefully Crops were not mentioned

So it was decided to go ahead with the work as already planned
but neither the young farmer nor his employer could look forward
cheerfully to the future

The uncertainty of what Pepper would eventually do was bound to be in
their thought day and night



CHAPTER XXI THE WELCOME TEMPEST

To some youths this matter of the option would have been such a clog
that they would have lost interest and slighted the work But not so
with Hiram Strong

He counted this day a lost one however he hated to leave the farm for
a minute when there was so much to do

But the next morning he got the plow into the fouracre corn lot and
he did nothing but the chores that week until the ground was entirely
plowed Then Henry Pollock came over and gave him another days work and
they finished grubbing the lowland

The rubbish was piled in great heaps down there ready for burning As
long as the rain held off Hiram did not put fire to the bushheaps

But early in the following week the clouds began to gather in a quarter
for rain and late in the afternoon when the air was still he took a
can of coal oil and with Sister and Mr Camp and even Mrs Atterson
at his heels went down to the riverside to burn the brush heaps

Theres not much danger of the fire spreading to the woods but if it
should Hiram said warningly it might at this time of year do your
timber a couple of hundred dollars worth of damage

Goodness me exclaimed Mother Atterson It does seem ridiculous to
hear you talk that away I never owned nothin but a little bit of
furniture before and I expected the boarders to tear that all to
pieces Im beginning to feel all puffed up and wealthy

Hiram cut them all green pineboughs for beaters and then set the fires
one after another There were more than twenty of the great piles and
soon the river bottom from bend to bend was filled with rolling clouds
of smoke As the dusk dropped the yellow glare of the fire illuminated
the scene

Sister clapped her hands and cried

Aint this bully It beats the Fourth of July celebration in Crawberry
Oh Id rather be on the farm than go to heaven

They had brought their supper with them and leaving the others to watch
the fires and see that the grass did not tempt the flames to the edge
of the wood Hiram cast bait into the river and in an hour drew out
enough mullet and bullheads to satisfy them all when they were
broiled over the hot coals of the first bonfire to be lighted

They ate with much enjoyment Between nine and ten oclock the fires had
all burned down to coals

A circle of burnedover grass and rubbish surrounded each fire There
seemed no possibility that the flames could spread to the mat of dry
leaves on the side hill

So they went home a lantern guiding their feet over the rough path
through the timber stopping at the spring for a long thirstquenching
draught

The sky was as black as ink Now and again a faint flash in the westward
proclaimed a tempest in that direction But not a breath of wind was
stirring and the rain might not reach this section

A dull red glow was reflected on the clouds over the riverbottom When
Hiram looked from his window just as he was ready for bed that glow
seemed to have increased

Strange he muttered It cant be that those fires have spread There
was no chance for them to spread Idontunderstand it

He sat at the window and stared out through the darkness There was
little wind as yet it was a fact however that the firelight flickered
on the lowhung clouds with increasing radiance

Am I mad demanded the young farmer suddenly leaping up and drawing
on his garments again That fire is spreading

He dressed fully and ran softly down the stairs and left the house
When he came out in the clear the glow had not receded There was a fire
down the hillside and it seemed increasing every moment

He remembered the enemy in the dark and without stopping to rouse the
household ran on toward the woods his heart beating heavily in his
bosom

Slipping falling at times panting heavily because of the rough ground
Hiram came at last through the more open timber to the brink of that
steep descent at the bottom of which lay the smoky riverbottom

And indeed the whole of the lowland seemed filled with stifling clouds
of smoke Yet from a dozen places along the foot of the hill yellow
flames were starting up kindling higher and devouring as fast as might
be the leaves and tinder left from the wrack of winter

The nearest bonfire had been a hundred yards from the foot of this hill
His care Hiram knew had left no chance of the dull coals in any of the
twenty heaps spreading to the verge of the grove

Mans hand had done this An enemy waiting and watching until they had
left the field had stolen down gathered burning brands and spread
them along the bottom of the hill where the increasing wind might
scatter the fire until the whole grove was in a blaze

Not only was Mrs Attersons timber in danger but Darrells tract
and that lying beyond would be overwhelmed by the flames if they were
allowed to spread

On the other side Dickerson had cut his timber a year or two before
clear to the river The fire would not burn far over his line Whoever
had done this dastardly act Dickersons property would not be damaged

But Hiram lent no time to trouble His work was cut out for him right
here and nowand well he knew it

He had brought the small axe with him having caught it up from the
doorstep Now he used it to cut a green bough and then ran with the
latter down the hill and set upon the fireline like a madman

The smoke spread here and there by puffs of rising wind half choked
him It stung his eyes until they distilled water enough to blind him
He thrashed and fought in the fumes and the murk of it stumbling and
slipping one moment halfknee deep in quickspringing flames the next
almost overpowered by the smudge that rose from the beaten mat of leaves
and rubbish

It was a lone fight He had to do it all There had been no time to
rouse either the neighbors or the rest of the family

If he did not overcome these flamesand well he knew itMother
Atterson would arise in the morning to see all her goodly timber
scorched perhaps ruined

I must beat it outbeat it out thought Hiram and the repetition
of the words thrummed an accompaniment upon the drums of his ears as he
thrashed away with a madmans strength

For no sane person would have tackled such a hopeless task Before
him the flames suddenly leaped six feet or more into the air They
overtopped him as they writhed through a clump of greenbriars The wind
puffed the flame toward him and his face was scorched by the heat

He lost his eyebrows completely and the hair was crisped along the
front brim of his hat

Then with a laughing crackle as though scorning his weakness the
flames ran up a climbing vine and the next moment wrapped a tall pine in
lurid yellow

This pine like a huge torch began to give off a thick black smoke
Would some wakeful neighboring farmer seeing it know the danger that
menaced and come to Hirams help

For yards he had beaten flat the flames and stamped out every spark
Behind him was naught but rolling smoke It was dark there No flames
were eating up the slope

But toward Darrells tract the fire seemed on the increase He could not
catch up with it And this solitary sentinel pine ablaze now in all
its head threatened to fling sparks for a hundred yards

If the wind continued to rise the forest was doomed

His green branch had burned to a crisp He had lost his axe in the
darkness and the smoke and now he tore another bough by main strength
from its parent stem

Hiram Strong worked as though inspired but to no purpose in the end
For the flames increased Puff after puff of wind drove the fire on
scattering brands from the blazing pine and now another and another
tree caught The glare of the conflagration increased

He flung down the useless bough Fire was all about him He had to leap
suddenly to one side to escape a burst of flame that had caught in a
jungle of greenbriars

Then of a sudden a crash of thunder rolled and reverberated through
the glen Lightning for an instant lit up the meadows and the river
The glare of it almost blinded the young farmer and out of the line of
fire he sank to the earth and covered his eyes seared by the sudden
compelling light

Again and again the thunder rolled following the javelins of lightning
that seemed to dart from the clouds to the earth The tempest so long
muttering in the West had come upon him unexpectedly for he had given
all his attention to the spreading fire

And now came the rainno refreshing sweet saturating shower but a
thunderous blinding fall of water that first set the burning woods to
steaming and then drowned out every spark of fire on upland as well as
lowland

It was a cloudbursta downpour such as Hiram had seldom experienced
before Exhausted he lay on the bank and let the pelting rain soak him
to the skin

He did not care Half drowned by the beating rain he only crowed his
delight at the downpour Every spark of fire was flooded out The danger
was past

He finally arose and staggered through the downpour to the house only
happy thatby a merciful interposition of Providencethe peril had
been overcome

He tore off his clothing on the stoop there in the pitch darkness and
crept up to his bedroom where he rubbed himself down with a crashtowel
and finally tumbled into bed and slept like a log till broad daylight



CHAPTER XXII FIRST FRUITS

For the first time since they had come to the farm Hiram was the
last to get up in the house And when he came down to breakfast
still trembling from the exertion of the previous night Mrs Atterson
screamed at the sight of him

For the good Land o Goshen she cried You look like a singed
chicken Hiram Strong Whatever have you been doing to yourself

He told them of the fight he had had while they slept But he could talk
about it jokingly now although Sister was inclined to snivel a little
over his danger

That Dickerson boy ought to be lashedNine and thirty lashesnone too
muchThis sausage is goodhumphand pancakesfit for the godsBut
hell come backdo more damagethe butter yes I I want butterand
syrup though two spreads is reckless extravaganceEh eh cant prove
anything against that Dickerson loutwell mebbe not

So Old Lem Camp commented upon the affair But Hiram could not prove
that the neighbors boy had done any of these things which pointed to a
malicious enemy

The young farmer began to wonder if he could not lay a trap and so
bring about his undoing

As soon as the ground was in fit condition again for the nights rain
had been heavy Hiram scattered the lime he had planned to use upon
the four acres of land plowed for corn and dragged it in with a
spiketoothed harrow

Working as he was with one horse alone this took considerable time
and when this corn land was ready it was time for him to go through the
garden piece again with the horse cultivator

Sister and Lem Camp both had learned to use the manweight wheelhoe
and the fine stuff was thinned and the weeds well cut out From time
to time the young farmer had planted peasboth the dwarf and taller
varietiesand now he risked putting in some early beanssnap and
bush limasand his first planting of sweet corn

Of the latter he put in four rows across the garden each of sixtyfive
day seventyfive day and ninety day sugar cornall of wellknown
kinds He planned later to put in every fortnight four rows of a
midlength season corn so as to have green corn for sale and for the
house up to frost

The potatoes were growing finely and he hilled them up for the first
time He marked his fouracre lot for field corncrosschecking it
threefeet ten inches apart This made twentyseven hundred and fifty
hills to the acre and with the handplanteran ingenious but cheap
machinehe dropped two and three kernels to the hill

This upland save where he had spread coarse stable manure was
not rich Upon each cornhill he had Sister throw half a handful of
fertilizer She followed him as he used the planter and they planted
and fertilized the entire four acres in less than two days

The lime he had put into the land would release such fertility as
remained dormant there but Hiram did not expect a big crop of corn on
that piece If he made two good ears to the hill he would be satisfied

He had knocked together a rough coldframe on the sunny side of the
woodshed to fit some old sash he had found in the barn Into the rich
earth sifted to make the bed in this frame he transplanted tomato
eggplant pepper and other plants of a delicate nature Early cabbage
and cauliflower had already gone into the garden plot and in the midst
of an early and saturating rain all day long he had transplanted
tablebeets into the rows he had marked out for them

This variety of vegetables were now all growing finely He sold nearly
six dollars worth of radishes in town and these radishes he showed
Mrs Atterson were really clear profit They had all been pulled from
the rows of carrots and other small seeds

There were several heavy rains after the tempest which had been so
Providential the ground was well saturated and the river had risen
until it roared between its banks in a voice that could be heard on a
still day at the house

The rains started the vegetation growing by leaps and bounds weeds
always increase faster than any other growing thing

There was plenty for Hiram to do in the garden and he kept Sister and
Old Lem Camp busy too They were at it from the first faint streak of
light in the morning until dark

But they were welland happy Mother Atterson her heart troubled by
thought of that Pepperman could not always repress her smiles If
the danger of losing the farm were past she would have had nothing in
the world to trouble her

The hundred eggs she had purchased for five dollars had proven more than
sixty per cent fertile Some advice that Hiram had given her enabled
Mrs Atterson to handle the chickens so that the loss from disease was
very small

He knocked together for her a couple of pens eight feet square which
could be moved about on the grass every day In these pens the seventy
or more chicks thrived immensely And Sister was devoted to them

Meanwhile the old whitefaced cow that had been a terror to Mother
Atterson at the start had found her calf and it was a heifer

Take my advice and raise it said Hiram She is a scrub but she is a
pretty good scrub Youll see that she will give a good measure of milk
And what this farm needs is cattle

If you could make stable manure enough to cover the cleared acres a
foot deep you could raise almost any crop you might nameand
make money by it The land is impoverished by the use of commercial
fertilizers unbalanced by humus

Well I guess You know Hiram admitted Mrs Atterson And that
calf certainly is a pretty creeter It would be too bad to turn it into
veal

Hiram did not intend to raise the calf expensively however He took it
away from its mother right at the start and in two weeks it was eating
grass and guzzling skimmed milk and calfmeal while the old cow was
beginning to show her employer her value

Mrs Atterson bought a small churn and quickly learned that slight at
buttermaking which is absolutely essential if one would succeed in the
dairy business

The cow turned out to pasture early in May too so her keep was not
so heavy a burden She lowed some after the calf but the latter was
growing finely under Hirams care and Mrs Atterson had at least two
pounds of butter for sale each week and the housekeeper at the St
Beris school paid her thirtyfive cents a pound for it

Hiram gradually picked up a retail route in the town which customers
paid more for the surplus vegetablesand butterthan could be obtained
at the stores He had taught Sister how to drive and sometimes even
Mrs Atterson went in with the vegetables

This relieved the young farmer and allowed him to work in the fields
And during these warm growing May days he found plenty to do Just as
the field corn pushed through the ground he went into the lot with his
14tooth harrow and broke up the crust and so killed the everspringing
weeds

With the spikes on the harrow set back no cornplants were dragged
out of the ground This first harrowing too mixed the fertilizer with
the soil and gave the corn the start it so sadly needed

Busy as bees the four transplanted people at the Atterson farmhouse
accomplished a great deal during these first weeks of the warming
season And all four of themMrs Atterson Sister Old Lem and Hiram
himselfenjoyed the work to the full



CHAPTER XXIII TOMATOES AND TROUBLE

Hiram Strong had decided that the market prospects of Scoville
prophesied a good price for early tomatoes He advised therefore a
good sized patch of this vegetable

He had planted in the window boxes seed of several different varieties
He had transplanted to the coldframe strong plants numbering nearly five
hundred He believed that under garden cultivation a tomato plant that
would not yield fifty cents worth of fruit was not worth bothering
with while a dollar from a single plant was not beyond the bounds of
probability

It was safe Hiram very well knew to set out tomato plants in this
locality much before the middle of May yet he was willing to take some
risks and go to some trouble for the sake of getting early ripened
tomatoes into the Scoville market

As Henry Pollock had prophesied Hiram did not see much of his friend
during cornplanting time The Pollocks put nearly fifty acres in corn
and the whole family helped in the work including Mrs Pollock herself
and down to the child next to the baby This little toddler amused his
younger brother and brought water to the field for the workers

Other families in the neighborhood did the same Hiram noticed They all
strained every effort to put in corn cultivating as big a crop as they
possibly could handle

This was why locally grown vegetables were scarce in Scoville And the
young farmer proposed to take advantage of this condition of affairs to
the best of his ability

If they were only to remain here on the farm long enough to handle this
one crop Hiram determined to make that crop pay his employer as well as
possible although he himself had no share in such profit

Henry Pollock however came along while Hiram was making ready his plat
in the garden for tomatoes The young farmer was setting several rows of
twoinch thick stakes across the garden sixteen feet apart in the row
the rows four feet apart The stakes themselves were about four feet out
of the ground

What ye doin there Hiram asked Henry curiously Building a
fence

Not exactly

Aint goin to have a chicken run out here in the garden be ye

I should hope not The chickens on this place will never mix with the
garden trucks if I have any say about it declared Hiram laughing

By Jo exclaimed Henry Dad says Maws dratted hens eat up a couple
hundred dollars worth of corn and clover every year for himrunnin
loose as they do

Why doesnt he build your mother proper runs then plant green stuff
in several yards and change the flock over from yard to yard Oh
hens wont do well shut up Maw says so said Henry repeating the
lazy farmers unfounded declarationprobably originated ages ago when
poultry was first domesticated

Ill show you next year if we are around here said Hiram whether
poultry will do well enclosed in yards

I told mother you didnt let your chickens run free and had no hens
with them said Henry thoughtfully

No I do not believe in letting anything on a farm get into lazy
habits A hen is primarily intended to lay eggs I send them back to
work when they have hatched out their brood

Those homemade brooders of ours keep the chicks quite as warm and
never peck the little fellows or step upon them as the old hen often
does

Thats right I allow admitted Henry grinning broadly

And some hens will traipse chicks through the grass and weeds as far
as turkeys No sir Send the hens back to business and let the chicks
shift for themselves Theyll do better

Them there in the pens certainly do look healthy said his friend
But you aint said what you was doin here Hiram setting these
stakes

Why Ill tell you returned Hiram This is my tomato patch

By Jo ejaculated Henry You dont want to set tomatoes so fur apart
do you

No no laughed Hiram The posts are to string wires on The tomatoes
will be two feet apart in the row As they grow I tie them to the wires
and so keep the fruit off the ground

The tomato ripens better and more evenly and the fruit will come
earlier especially if I pinch back the ends of the vine from time to
time and remove some of the side branches

We dont do all that to raise a tomato crop And well put in five
acres for the cannery this year as usual said Henry with some scorn

We run the rows out four feet apart like you do throwing up a list
in fact Then father goes ahead with a stick making a hole for the
plant every three feet sot theyll be checkrowed and we can cultivate
them both waysand we all set the plants

We never handhoe emit dont pay The cannery isnt giving but
fifteen cents a basket this yearand its got to be a full fiveeighths
basket too for they weigh em

Hiram looked at him with a quizzical smile

So you set about thirtysix hundred and forty plants to the acre he
said

I reckon so

And youll have five acres of tomatoes

Yep So Dad says He has contracted for that many But our plants
dont begin to be big enough to set out yet We have to keep em covered
nights

And I expect to have about five hundred plants in this patch said
Hiram smiling I tell you what Henry

Huh said the other boy I bet I take in from my patchnet income I
meanthis year as much as your father gets at the cannery for his whole
crop

Nonsense cried Henry Maybe Dadll make a hundred or a hundred and
twentyfive dollars Sometimes tomatoes run as high as thirty dollars an
acre around here

Wait and see said Hiram laughing It is going to cost me more to
raise my crop and market it thats true But if your father doesnt do
better with his five acres than you say Ill beat him

You cant do it Hiram cried Henry I can try anyway said Hiram
more quietly but with confidence Well see

And say Henry added suddenly I was going to tell you something
You wont raise these tomatoesnor no other cropif Pete Dickerson can
stop ye

Whats the matter with Pete now asked Hiram troubled by thought of
the secret enemy who had already struck at him in the dark

He was blowing about what hed do to you down at the crossroads last
evening said Henry He and his father both hate you like poison I
expect

And the fellers down to Cale Schells are always stirrin up trouble
They think it is sport Why Pete got so mad last night he could ha
chewed tacks

I have said nothing about Pete to anybody said Hiram firmly

That dont matter They say you have They tell Pete a whole lot of
stuff just to see him git riled

And last night he slopped over He said if you reported around that he
put fire to Mis Attersons woods hed put it to the house and barns
Oh he was wild

Hirams face flushed and then paled

Did Pete try to bum the woods Hiram queried Henry shrewdly

I never even said I thought so to you have I asked the young farmer
sternly

Nope I only heard that fire got into the woods by accident when I
was in town Somebody was hunting through there for coon and saw the
burnedover place Thats all the fellers at Cales place knew too I
reckon but they jest put it up to Pete to mad him

And they succeeded did they said Hiram sternly

I reckon

Loosemouthed people make more trouble in a community than downright
mean ones declared Hiram If I have any serious trouble with the
Dickersons like enough it will be because of the interference of the
other neighbors

But said Henry preparing to go on Pete wouldnt dare fire your
stable nowafter sayin hed do it He aint quite so big a fool as all
that

But Hiram was not so sure He had this additional trouble on his mind
from this very hour though he never said a word to Mrs Atterson about
it

But every night before he went to bed be made around of the outbuildings
to make sure that everything was right before he slept



CHAPTER XXIV CORN THATS CORN

Hiram caught sight of Pepper in town one day and went after him He knew
the real estate man had returned from his business trip and the fact
that the matter of the option was hanging fire and troubling Mrs
Atterson exceedingly urged Hiram go counter to Mr Stricklands advice

The lawyer had said Let sleeping dogs lie Pepper had made no move
however and the uncertainty was very trying both for the young farmer
and his employer

How about that option you talked about Mr Pepper asked the youth
Are you going to exercise it

Ive got time enough aint I returned the real estate man eyeing
Hiram in his very slyest way

I expect you haveif it really runs a year

You seen it didnt you demanded Pepper

But wed like Mr Strickland to see it

Hes goin to act for Mrs Atterson queried the man with a scowl

Oh yes

Well hell see itwhen Im ready to take it up Dont you fret
retorted Pepper and turned away

This did not encourage the young farmer nor was there anything in the
mans manner to yield hope to Mrs Atterson that she could feel secure
in her title to the farm So Hiram said nothing to her about meeting the
man

But the youth was very much puzzled It really did seem as though Pepper
was afraid to show that paper to Mr Strickland

Theres something queer about it I believe declared the youth to
himself Somewhere there is a trick Hes afraid of being tripped up on
it But why does he wait if he knows the railroad is going to demand a
strip of the farm and he can get a good price for it

Perhaps he is waiting to make sure that the railroad will condemn a
piece of Mrs Attersons farm If the board should change the route
again Pepper would have a farm on his hands that he might not be able
to sell immediately at a profit

For we must confess that sixteen hundred dollars as farms have sold
in the past around here is a good price for the Atterson place Thats
why Uncle Jeptha was willing to give an option for a monthif that was
in the beginning the understanding the old man had of his agreement
with Pepper

However we might as well go ahead with the work and take what comes
to us in the end I know no other way to do quoth Hiram with a sigh

For he could not be very cheerful with the prospect of making only a
single crop on the place His profit was to have come out of the second
years cropand he felt out of that bottom land which had so charmed
him on the day he and Henry Pollock had gone over the Atterson Place

Riches lay buried in that six acres of bottom Hiram had read up on
onion culture and he believed that if he planted his seed in hot beds
and transplanted the young onions to the rich soil in this bottom he
could raise fully as large onions as they did in either Texas or the
Bermudas

Of course they have the advantage of a longer season down there
thought Hiram and cheap labor But maybe I can get cheap labor right
around here The children of these farmers are used to working in the
fields I ought to be able to get help pretty cheap

And when it comes to the marketwhy Ive got the Texas growers at
least skinned a little I can reach either the Philadelphia or New York
market in a day Yes given the right conditions onions ought to pay
big down there on that lowland

But this was not the only crop possibility be turned over in his mind
There were other vegetables that would grow luxuriantly on that bottom
landproviding always the flood did not come and fulfill Henry
Pollocks prophecy

Two feet of water on that meadow eh thought Hiram Well that
certainly would be bad I wouldnt want that to happen after the ground
was plowed this year even It would tear up the land and sour it and
spoil it for a corncrop indeed

So he was down a good deal to the rivers edge watching the ebb and
flow of the stream A heavy rain would over night fill the river to
its very brim and the open field even beyond the marshy spot would be
aslop with standing water

It sure wouldnt grow alfalfa chuckled Hiram to himself one day For
the water rises here a good deal closer to the surface than four feet
and alfalfa farmers declare that if the springs rise that high there is
no use in putting in alfalfa Why I reckon just now the water is within
four inches of the top of the ground

If the river remained so high and the low ground so saturated with
water he knew too that he could not get the six acres plowed in time
to put in corn this year And it was this years crop he must think
about first

Even if Pepper did not exercise his option and turn Mrs Atterson
out of the place a big commercial crop of onions or any other
betterpaying crop could only be tried the second year

Hiram had got his seed corn for the upland piece of the man who raised
the best corn in the community He had tried the fertility of each ear
discarded those which proved weakly or infertile and his stand of corn
for the four acres which was now half hand high was the best of any
farmer between the Atterson place and town

But this corn was a hundredandtenday variety The farmer he got it of
told him that he had raised a crop from a piece planted the day before
the Fourth of July but it was safer to get it in at least by June
fifteenth

And here it was past June first and the meadow land had not yet been
plowed

However Hiram said to Henry when they walked down to the riverside
on Sunday afternoon Im going ahead on Faithjust as the minister
said in church this morning If Faith can move mountains well give it
a chance to move something right down here

I dunno Hiram returned the other boy shaking his head Father says
hell git in here for you with three head and a Number 3 plow by the
middle of this week if you say sonless it rains again of course But
hes afeared youre goin to waste Mrs Attersons money for her

Nothing ventured nothing gained quoted Hiram grimly If a farmer
didnt take chances every year the whole world would starve to death

Well returned Henry smiling too let the other fellow take the
chancesthats dads motter

Yes And the chancey fellow skims the cream of things every time
No sir declared the young fellow Im going to be among the
creamskimmers or I wont be a farmer at all

So the plow was put into the bottomland Wednesdayand put in deep By
Friday night the whole piece was plowed and partly harrowed

Hiram had drawn lime for this bottomland proposing to use beside only
a small amount of fertilizer He spread this lime from his onehorse
wagon while Henry dragharrowed behind him and by Saturday noon the
job was done

The horses had not mired at all much to Mr Pollocks surprise And the
plow had bit deep All the heavy sod of the piece was covered well and
the seed bed was fairly levelfor corn

Although the Pollocks did not work on Saturday afternoon Hiram did
not feel as though he could stop at this time Most of the farmers had
already planted their last piece of corn Monday would be the fifteenth
of the month

So the young farmer got his homemade cornrow marker down to the
riverbottom and began marking the piece that afternoon

This marker ran out three rows at each trip across the field and with
a white stake at either end the youth managed to run his rows very
straight He had a good eye

In this case he did not checkrow his field The land was
richphenomenally rich he believed If he was going to have a crop of
corn here he wanted a crop worth while

On the uplands the farmers were satisfied with from thirty to fifty
baskets of earcorn to the acre If this lowland was what he believed it
was Hiram was sure it would make twice that

And at that his corn crop here would only average twentyfive dollars to
the acrenot a phenomenal profit for Mrs Atterson in that

But the land would be getting into shape for a better crop and although
corn is a crop that will soon impoverish ground if planted year after
year on the same piece Hiram knew that the humus in this soil on the
lowland was almost inexhaustible

So he marked his rows the long way of the fieldrunning with the river

One of the implements left by Uncle Jeptha had been a onehorse
cornplanter with a fertilizer attachment Hiram used this dropping
two or three grains twentyfour inches apart and setting the fertilizer
attachment to one hundred and fifty pounds to the acre

He was until the next Wednesday night planting the piece Meanwhile it
had not rained and the river continued to recede It was now almost
as low as it had been the day Lettie Bronsons boating party had been
wrecked under the big sycamore

Hiram had not seen the Bronsons for some weeks but about the time he
got his late corn planted Mr Bronson drove into the Atterson yard and
found Hiram cultivating his first corn with the fivetooth cultivator

Well well Hiram exclaimed the Westerner looking with a broad smile
over the field Thats as pretty a field of corn as I ever saw I dont
believe there is a hill missing

Only a few on the far edge where the moles have been at work

Moles dont eat corn Hiram

So they say returned the young farmer quietly I never could make
up my mind about it

Im sure however that if they are only after slugs and worms which
are drawn to the corn hills by the commercial fertilizer the moles do
fully as much damage as the slugs would

You see they make a cavity under the corn hill and the roots of the
plant wither Excuse me but Id rather have Mr Mole in somebody elses
garden

Mr Bronson laughed Well what the little gray fellows eat wont kill
us But they do spoil otherwise handsome rows How did you get such a
good stand of corn Hiram

I tested the seed in a seed box early in the spring I wouldnt plant
corn any other way Aside from the hills the moles have spoiled and a
few an old crow pulled up Ive got no replanting to do

And replanted hills are always behind the crop and seldom make
anything but fodder If it wasnt for the look of the field Id never
replant a hill of corn

Of course Ive got to thin thistwo grains in the hill is enough on
this land

Mr Bronson looked at him with growing surprise

Why my boy you talk just as though you had tilled the ground for a
score of years Who taught you so much about farming

One of the best farmers who ever lived said Hiram with a smile My
father And he taught me to go to the correct sources for information
too

I believe you exclaimed Mr Bronson And youre going to have corn
thats corn as we say in my part of the country on this piece of
land

Wait said Hiram smiling and shaking his head

Wait for what

Wait till you see the corn on my bottomlandif the river down there
doesnt drown it out If we dont have too much rain Im going to have
corn on that riverbottom that will beat anything in this county Mr
Bronson

And the young farmer spoke with assurance



CHAPTER XXV THE BARBECUE

On the seventeenth day of June Hiram had grappled out a mess of
potatoes for their dinner They were larger than hens eggs and came
upon the table mealy and white

Potatoes were selling at retail in Scoville for two dollars the bushel
Before the end of that weekafter the lowland corn was plantedHiram
dug two rows of potatoes sorted them and carted them to town together
with some bunched beets a few bunches of young carrots radishes and
salad

The potatoes he sold for fifty cents the fiveeighth basket from house
to house and he brought back for his load of vegetables ten dollars
and twenty cents which he handed to Mrs Atterson much to that ladys
joy

My soul and body Hiram she exclaimed This is just a Godsendno
less Do you know that weve sold nigh twentyfive dollars worth of
stuff already this spring besides that pair of pigs I let Pollock have
and the butter to St Beris

And its only a beginning Hiram told her Wait til the peas come
alongwell have a mess for the table in a few days now And the sweet
corn and tomatoes

If you and Sister can do the selling it will help out a whole lot of
course I wish we had another horse

Or an automobile said Sister clapping her hands Wouldnt it be
fine to run into town in an auto with a lot of vegetables Then Hiram
could keep right at work with the horse and not have to stop to harness
up for us

Shucks child admonished Mrs Atterson What big idees you do get in
that noddle o yourn

The girls boarding school and the two hotels proved good customers for
Hirams early vegetables for nobody around Scoville had potatoes
at this time and Hirams early peas were two weeks ahead of other
peoples

Having got a certain number of towns folks to expect him at least thrice
a week when other farmers had green stuff for sale they could not
easily cut out Hiram later in the season

And not always did the young farmer have to leave his work at home to
deliver the vegetables and Mrs Attersons butter Sister or the old
lady herself could go to town if the load was not too heavy

Of course it cost considerable to live And hogfood and grain for the
horse and cow had to be bought Hiram was fattening four of the spring
shoats against winter Two they could sell and two kill for their own
use

Goin to be big doins on the Fourth this year Hiram said Henry
Pollock meeting the young farmer on the road from town one day Heard
about it

In Scoville do you mean Theyre going to have a Safe and Sane
Fourth the Banner says

Nope We dont think much of goin to town Fourth of July And this
year theres goin to be a big picnic in Langdons Grovethats up the
river you know

A public picnic

Sure A barbecue we call it said Henry We have one at the Grove
evry year This time the two Sunday Schools is goin to join and have a
big time You and Sister dont want to miss it That Mr Bronsons goin
to give a whole side o beef they tell me to roast over the fires

A big banquet is in prospect is it asked Hiram smiling

And a stew Gee you never eat one o these barbecue stews did ye
Some of us will go huntin the day before and therell be birds and
squirrels as well as chickens in that stewand lima beans and corn
and everything good you can think of and Henry smacked his lips in
prospect

Then he added bethinking himself of his errand

Everybody chips in and gives the things to eat Whatll you give
Hiram

Some vegetables said Hiram quickly Mrs Atterson wont object I
guess Do they want tomatoes for their stew

Wont be no tomatoes ripe Hiram said Henry decidedly

There wont eh You come out and take a look at mine said Hiram
laughing

Of all the rows of vegetables in Hirams garden plot the thriftiest
and handsomest were the trellised tomato plants It took nearly half of
Sisters time to keep the plants tied up and pinched back as Hiram had
taught her

But the stalks were already heavily laden with fruit and those hanging
lowest on the sturdy vines were already blushing

By Jo gasped Henry Youve done it aint you But the cannery wont
take em yet awhileand theyll all be gone before September

The cannery wont get many of my tomatoes laughed Hiram And these
vines properly trained and cultivated as they are will bear fruit up to
frost You wait and see

Ill have to tell dad to come and look at these I dunno Hiram if you
can sell em at retail but youll git as much for em as dad does for
his whole cropjust as you said

Thats what Im aiming for responded Hiram But would the ladies who
cook the barbecue stew care for tomatoes do you think

We never git tomatoes this early said Henry How about potatoes And
there aint many folks dug any of theirn yet but you

So after speaking with Mrs Atterson Hiram agreed to supply a barrel
of potatoes for the barbecue and the day before the Fourth one of the
farmers came with a wagon to pick up the supplies

Everybody at the Atterson farm would go to the grovethat was
understood

If one knocks off work the others can declared Mother Atterson You
see that things is left all right for the critters Hiram and well
tend to things indoors so that we can be gone till night

And do Hiram look out for my poults the last thing cried Sister

Mrs Larriper had given Sister a setting of ten turkey eggs and every
one of them had hatched under one of Mrs Attersons motherly old hens
At first the girl had kept the young turkeys and their foster mother
right near the house so that she could watch them carefully

But poults are rangy and these being particularly strong and thrifty
they soon ran the old hen pretty nearly to death

So Hiram had built a coop into which they could go at night safe from
any vermin and set it far down in the east lot near the woods Sister
usually went down with a little grain twice a day to call them up and
keep them tame

But when they get big enough to roost in the fall I expect well have
to gather that crop with a gun Hiram told her laughing

Many of the farmers teams were strung out along the road long before
Hiram was ready to set out He had made sure that the spring wagon was
in good shape and he had built an extra seat for it so that the four
rode very comfortably

Like every other Fourth of July the sun was broiling hot And the dust
rose in clouds as the faster teams passed their slow old nag

Mrs Atterson sat up very primly in her best silk holding a parasol and
wearing a pair of lace mits that had appeared on state occasions for the
past twenty years at least

Sister was growing like a weed and it was hard to keep her skirts and
sleeves at a proper length But she was an entirely different looking
girl from the boarding house slavey whom Hiram remembered so keenly back
in Crawberry

As for Old Lem Camp he was as cheerful as Hiram had ever seen him and
showed a deal of interest in everything about the farm and had proved
himself as Mrs Atterson had prophesied a great help

Scarcely a house along the road was not shut up and the dooryard
desertedfor everybody was going to the barbecue All but the Dickerson
family Sam was at work in the fields and the haggard Mrs Dickerson
looked dumbly from her porch with a crying baby in her scrawny arms as
the Attersons and Hiram passed

But Pete was at the barbecue He was there when Hiram arrived and he
was making himself quite as prominent as anybody

Indeed he made himself so obnoxious finally that one of the rough men
who was keeping up the fires threatened to chuck Pete into the biggest
one and then cool him off in the river

Otherwise however the barbecue passed off very pleasantly The men who
governed it saw that no liquor was brought along and the unruly element
to which Pete belonged was kept under with an iron hand

There was so little fun of a kind in Petes estimation that after
the big event of the daythe banquethe and some of his friends
disappeared And the picnicking ground was a much quieter and pleasanter
place after their departure

The newcomers into the community made many friends and acquaintances
that day Sister was going to school in the fall and she found many
girls of her age whom she would meet there

Mrs Atterson met the older ladies and was invited to join no less than
two Ladies Aids and as she said if she called on all the
folks shed agreed to visit shed be goin evry day from then till
Christmas

As for Hiram the men and older boys were rather inclined to jolly him
a bit Not many of them had been upon the Atterson place to see what
he had done but they had heard some stories of his proposed crops that
amused them

When Mr Bronson however whom the local men knew to be a big farmer in
the Middle West and who owned many farms out there now spoke favorably
of Hirams work the local men listened respectfully

The boys got it in him to do something the Westerner said in his
hearty fashion Youre eating his potatoes now I understand Which one
of you can dig early potatoes like those

And hes got the best stand of corn in the county

On that riverbottom you mean asked one

And on the upland too You fellows want to look about you a little
Most of you dont see beyond the end of your noses You watch out
or Hiram Strong is going to beat every last one of you this yearand
thats a rundown farm hes got at that



CHAPTER XXVI SISTERS TURKEYS

But Lettie was not at the barbecue and to tell the truth Hiram Strong
was disappointed

Despite the fact that she had seemed inclined to snub him the young
farmer was vastly taken with the pretty girl He had seen nobody about
Scoville as attractive as Lettienor anywhere else for that matter

He was too proud to call at the Bronson place although Mr Bronson
invited him whenever he saw Hiram And at first Lettie had asked him to
come too

But the Western girl did not like being thwarted in any mattereven the
smallest And when Hiram would not come to take Pete Dickersons place
the very much indulged girl had showed the young farmer that she was
offended

However the afternoon at Langdons Grove passed very pleasantly and
Hiram and his party did not arrive at the farm again until dusk had
fallen

Ill go down and shut your turkeys up for the night Sister Hiram
said after he had done the other chores for he knew the girl would be
afraid to go so far from the house by lanternlight

And when he reached the turkey coop way down in the field Hiram was
very glad indeed that he had come instead of the girl

For the coop was empty There wasnt a turkey inside or thereabout It
had been dark an hour and more then and the poults should long since
have been hovered in the coop

Had some marauding fox or other varmint run the young turkeys off
their reservation That seemed improbable at this time of yearand so
early in the evening Foxes do not usually go hunting before midnight
nor do other predatory animals

Hiram had brought the barn lantern with him and he took a look around
the neighborhood of the empty coop

My goodness he mused Sister will cry her eyes out if anythings
happened to those little turks Now whats this

The ground was cut up at a little distance from the coop He examined
the tracks closely

They were freshvery fresh indeed The wheel tracks of a light wagon
showed and the prints of a horses shod hoofs

The wagon had been driven down from the main road and had turned
sharply here by the coop Hiram knew too that it had stood there for
some time for the horse had moved uneasily

Of course that proved the driver had gotten out of the wagon and left
the horse alone Doubtless there was but one thieffor it was
positive that the turkeys had been removed by a twofootednot a
fourfootedmarauder

And who would be mean enough to steal Sisters turkeys Almost
everybody in the neighborhood has a few to fatten for Thanksgiving and
Christmas Whodidthis

He followed the wheel marks of the wagon to the road He saw the track
where it turned into the field and where it turned out again And
it showed plainly that the thief came from town and returned in that
direction

Of course in the roadway it was impossible to trace the particular
tracks made by the thiefs horse and wagon Too many other vehicles had
been over the road within the past hour

The thief must have driven into the field just after nightfall plucked
the ten young turkeys one by one out of the coop tying their feet
and flinging them into the bottom of his wagon Covered with a bag the
frightened turkeys would never utter a peep while it remained dark

I hate to tell SisterI cant tell her Hiram said as he went slowly
back to the house For Sister had been counting chickens again and
she had figured that at eighteen cents per pound live weight the ten
turkeys would pay for all the clothes she would need that winter and
give her Christmas money too

The young farmer shrank from meeting the girl again that night and he
delayed going into the house as long as possible Then he found they had
all retired leaving him a cold supper at the end of the kitchen table

The disappearance of the turkeys kept Hiram tossing wakeful upon his
bed for some hours He could not fail to connect this robbery with the
other things that had been done during the past weeks to injure those
living at the Atterson farm

Was the secret enemy really Peter Dickerson And had Pete committed this
crime now

Yet the horse and wagon had come from the direction opposite the
Dickerson farm and had returned as it came

I dont know whether I am accusing that fellow wrongfully or not
muttered Hiram at last But I am going to find out Sister isnt going
to lose her turkeys without my doing everything in my power to get them
back and punish the thief

He usually arose in the morning before anybody else was astir so it
was easy for Hiram to slip out of the house and down to the field to the
empty turkey coop

The marks of horse and wagon were quite as plain in the faint light of
dawn as they had been the night before In the darkness the thief
had driven his wagon over some small stumps amid which his horse had
scrambled in some difficulty it was plain

Hiram tracing out these marks as a Red Indian follows a trail
saw something upon the edge of one of the halfdecayed stumps that
interested him greatly

He stood up the next moment with this clue in his handa white coarse
hair perhaps four inches in length

That was scraped off the horses fetlock as he scrambled over this
stump muttered Hiram Now who drives a white horse or a horse with
white feet in this neighborhood

Can I narrow the search down in this way I wonder and for some
moments the youth stood there in the growing light of early morning
canvassing the subject from that angle



CHAPTER XXVII RUN TO EARTH

A broad streak of crimson along the eastern horizon over the treetops
announced the coming of the sun when Hiram Strong reached the automobile
road to which he on the previous night had traced the thief that had
stolen Sisters poults

Now he looked at the track again It surely had come from the direction
of Scoville and it turned back that way

Yet he looked at the white horsehair scraped off upon the stump and
he turned his back upon these signs and strode along the road toward his
own home

Smoke was just curling from the Atterson chimney Sister or Mrs
Atterson was just building the fire But they did not see Hiram as he
went by

Hirams quest led him past the place and to the Dickerson farm There
nobody was yet astir save the mules and horses in the barnyard who
called as he went by hoping for their breakfast

Hiram knew that the Dickersons had turkeys and like most of the other
farmers cooped them in distant fields away from the house He found
three coops in the middle of an old oatfield tinder a spreading beech

The old turks roosted upon the limbs of the beech at night they were
already up and away hunting grasshoppers for breakfast But quite a few
poults were running and peeping about the coops with two hen turkeys
playing guard to them

Hiram saw where a wagon had been driven in here and turned too The
tracks were made recently And one of the coops was shut tight although
he knew by the rustling within that there were young turkeys in it

It was too dark within the hutch however for the youth to number the
poults confined there

He strolled back across the fields to the rear of the Dickerson house
Passing the barnyard first he halted and examined the bright bay horse
with white feetthe one that Pete had driven to the barbecue the day
beforethe only one Pete was ever allowed to drive off the farm

The Dickersons father and son were not as early risers as most farmers
in those parts At least they were not up betimes on this morning

But Mrs Dickerson had built the fire now and was stirring about the
porch when Hiram arrived at the step filling her kettle at the pump

Mornin Mr Strong she said in her startled way eyeing Hiram
askance

She was a lean sharpfeatured woman with a hopeless droop to her
shoulders

Goodmorning Mrs Dickerson said Hiram gravely How many young
turkeys have you this year

The woman shrank back and almost dropped the kettle she had filled to
the pumpbench Her eyes glared

Somewhere in the house a baby squatted then a door banged and Hiram
heard Dickersons heavy step descending the stair

You have a coop of poults down there Mrs Dickerson continued Hiram
confidently that I know belongs to us I traced Petes tracks with the
wagon and the whitefooted horse Now this is going to make trouble for
Pete

Whats the matter with Pete now demanded Dickersons harsh voice
and he came out upon the porch

He scowled at sight of Hiram and continued

What are you roaming around here for Strong Cant you keep on your
own side of the fence

Its little Ill ever trouble you Mr Dickerson said Hiram
sharply if you and yours dont trouble me I can assure you

Whats eating you now demanded the man roughly

Why Ill tell you Mr Dickerson said Hiram quickly Somebodys
stolen our turkeysten of them And I have found them down there where
your turkeys roost The natural inference is that somebody here knows
about it

Dickersonjust out of his bed and as ugly as many people are when they
first get upleaped for the young farmer from the porch and had him in
his grip before Hiram could help himself

The woman screamed There was a racket in the house for some of the
children had been watching from the window

Dads goin to lick him squalled one of the girls

You come here and intermate that any of my familys thieves do you
the angry man roared

Stop that Sam Dickerson cried his wife She suddenly gained courage
and ran to the struggling pair and tried to haul Sam away from Hiram

The boys right she gasped I heard Pete tellin little Sam last
night what hed done Its come to a pretty pass so it has if you are
goin to uphold that bad boy in thieving

Hush up Maw cried Petes voice from the house

Come out here you scalawag ordered his father relaxing his hold on
Hiram

Pete slouched out on the porch wearing a grin that was half sheepish
half worried

Whats this Strong says about turkeys demanded Sam Dickerson
sternly

Taint so declared Pete I aint seen no turkeys

I have found them said Hiram quietly And the coopful is down
yonder in your lot You thought to fool me by turning into our farm from
the direction of Scoville and driving back that way but you turned
around in the road under that overhanging oak where I picked Lettie
Bronson off the back of the runaway horse last Spring

Now those ten turkeys belong to Sister Shell be heartbroken if
anything happens to them You have played me several mean tricks since I
have been here Pete Dickerson

No I aint interrupted the boy

Who took the burr off the end of my axle and let me down in the road
that night demanded Hiram his rage rising

Pete could not forbear a grin at this remembrance

And who tampered with our pump the next morning And who watched and
waited till we left the lower meadow that night we burned the rubbish
and then set fire to our woods

Mrs Dickerson screamed again I knew that fire never come by
accident she moaned

You shut up Maw admonished her hopeful son again

And now Ive got you declared Hiram with confidence I can tell
those ten poults I marked them for Sister long ago so that if they
went to the neighbors they could be easily identified

Theyre in that shutup coop down yonder continued Hiram and unless
you agree to bring them back at once and put them in our coop I shall
hitch up and go to town first thing and get out a warrant for your
arrest

Sam had remained silent for a minute or two Now he said decidedly

You neednt threaten no more young feller I can see plain enough that
Petes been carrying his fun too far

Fun ejaculated Hiram

Thats what I said growled Sam Hell bring the turkeys backand
before he has his breakfast too

All right said Hiram knowing full well that there was nothing to
be made by quarreling with Sam Dickerson His returning the turkeys
however will not keep me from speaking to the constable the very next
time Pete plays any of his tricks around our place

It may be fun for him but it wont look so funny from the inside of
the town jail

He walked off after this threat And he was sorry he had said it For he
had no real intention of having Pete arrested and an empty threat is of
no use to anybody

The turkeys came back Sister did not even know that they had been
stolen for when she went down to feed them about the middle of the
forenoon all ten came running to her call

But Pete Dickerson ceased from troubling for a time much to Hirams
satisfaction

Meanwhile the crops were coming on finely Hirams tomatoes were
bringing good prices in Scoville and as he had such a quantity and was
so much earlier than the other farmers around about he did as he told
Henry he would do skim the cream off the market

He bought some crates and baskets in town too and shipped some of
the tomatoes to a produce man he knew in Crawberrya man whom he could
trust to treat him fairly During the season that mans checks to Mrs
Atterson amounted to fiftyfour dollars

Three times a week the spring wagon went to town with vegetables for the
school the hotels and their retail customers The whole family worked
long hours and worked hard but nobody complained

No rain fell of any consequence until the latter part of July and then
there was no danger of the river overflowing and drowning out the corn

And that corn By the last of July it was waist high growing rank and
strong and of that blackgreen color which delights the farmers eye

Mr Bronson walked down to the river especially to see it Like Hirams
upland corn there was scarcely a hill missing save where the muskrats
had dug in from the river bank and disturbed the corn hills

Thats the finestlooking corn in this county bar none Hiram
declared Bronson I have seldom seen better looking in the rich
bottomlands of the West And you certainly do keep it clean boy

No use in putting in a crop if you dont tend it said the young
farmer sententiously

And whats this along here asked the gentleman pointing to a row or
two of small stuff along the inner edge of the field

Im trying onions and celery down here I want to put a commercial crop
into this field next yearif we are let stay herethat will pay Mrs
Atterson and me a real profit and Hiram laughed

What do you call a real profit inquired Mr Bronson seriously

Four hundred dollars an acre net said the young farmer promptly

Why Hiram you cant do that cried the gentleman

Its being donein other localities and on soil not so rich as
thisand I believe I can do it

With onions or celery Yes sir Whichor both asked the
Westerner interested

I am trying them out here as you see I believe it will be celery
This soil is naturally wet and celery is a glutton for water Then it
is a late piece and celery should be transplanted twice before it is
put in the field I believe

A lot of work boy said Mr Bronson shaking his head

Well I never expect to get something for nothing remarked Hiram

And how about the onions

Why they dont seem to do so well There is something lacking in the
land to make them do their best I believe it is too cold And then I
am watching the onion market and I am afraid that too many people
have gone into the game in certain sections and are bound to create an
oversupply

The gentleman looked at him curiously

You certainly are an ableminded youngster Hiram he observed I
spose if you do so well here next year as you expect a charge of
dynamite wouldnt blast you away from the Atterson farm

Why Mr Bronson responded the young farmer I dont want to run a
onehorse farm all my life And this never can be much more It isnt
near enough to any big city to be a real truck farmand Im interested
in bigger things

No sir The Atterson Eighty is only a stepping stone for me I hope
Ill go higher before long



CHAPTER XXVIII HARVEST

But Hiram was not at all sure that he would ever see a celery crop in
this bottomland Pepper still hung fire and he would not go to Mr
Strickland with his option

I dont hafter he told Hiram When I git ready Ill let ye know be
sure o that

The fact was that the railroad had made no further move Mr Strickland
admitted to Mrs Atterson that if the strip along the east boundary
of the farm was condemned by the railroad she ought to get a thousand
dollars for it

But if the railroad board should change its mind again added the
lawyer sixteen hundred dollars would not be a speculative price to pay
for your farmand well Pepper knows it

Then Mr Damocless sword has got to hang over us has it demanded
the old lady

I am afraid so admitted the lawyer smiling

Mrs Atterson could not be more troubled than was Hiram himself Youth
feels the sting of such arrows of fortune more keenly than does age We
get casehardened to trouble as the years bend our shoulders

The thought that he might after all get nothing but a hundred dollars
and his board for all the work he had done in preparation for the second
years crop sometimes embittered Hirams thoughts

Once when he spoke to Pepper and the snaky man sneered at him and
laughed the young farmer came near attacking him then and there in the
street

I certainly could have given that Pepper as good a thrashing as ever he
got muttered Hiram And even Pete Dickerson never deserved one more
than Pepper

Pete fought shy of Hiram these days and as the summer waned the young
farmer gradually became less watchful and expectant of trouble from the
direction of the west boundary of the Atterson Eighty

But there was little breathing spell for him in the work of the farm

When we lay by the corn you bet dad an me goes fishing Henry
Pollock told Hiram one day

But it wasnt often that the young farmer could take half a day off for
any such pleasure

Youve bit off moren you kin chaw observed Henry

Thats all right Ill keep chewing at it just the same returned
Hiram cheerfully

For the truck crop was bringing them in a bigger sum of money than even
Hiram had expected The season had been very favorable indeed Hirams
vegetables had come along in good time and even the barrels of sweet
corn he shipped to Crawberry brought a fair pricemuch better than he
could have got at the local cannery

When the tomato pack came on however he did sell many baskets of his
seconds to the cannery But the selected tomatoes he continued to ship
to Crawberry and having established a reputation with his produce man
for handsome and evenly ripened fruit the prices received were good all
through the season

He saw the sum for tomatoes pass the hundred and fifty dollar mark
before frost struck the vines Even then he was not satisfied There was
a small cellar under the Atterson house and when the frosty nights of
October came Hiram dragged up the vines still bearing fruit by the
roots and hung them in the cellar where the tomatoes continued to
ripen slowly nearly up to Thanksgiving

Other crops did almost as well in proportion He had put in no late
potatoes but in September he harvested the balance of his early crop
and as they were a good keeping variety he knew there would be enough
to keep the family supplied until the next season

Of other roots including a patch of wellgrown mangels for Mrs
Attersons handsome flock of chickens there were plenty to carry the
family over the winter

As the frosts became harder Hiram dug his root pits in the high light
soil of the garden drew pinetags to cover them and gradually as the
winter advanced heaped the earth over the various piles of roots to
keep them through the winter

Meanwhile in September corn harvest had come on The four acres Hiram
had planted below the stables yielded a fair crop that part of the
land he had been able to enrich with coarse manure showing a much better
average than the remainder

The four acres yielded them something over one hundred and sixty baskets
of sound corn which as corn was then selling for fifty cents per
bushel meant that the crop was worth about forty dollars

As near as Hiram could figure it had cost about fifteen dollars to raise
the crop therefore the profit to Mrs Atterson was some twentyfive
dollars

Besides the profit from some of the garden crops this was very small
indeed as Hiram said it did not pay well enough to plant small patches
of corn for them to fool with it much

The only way to make a good profit out of corn corn a place like this
he said to Henry who would not be convinced is to have a big drove of
hogs and turn them into the field to fatten on the standing corn

But that would be wasteful cried Henry shocked at the suggestion

Big pork producers do not find it so returned Hiram confidently Or
else one wants a drove of cattle to fatten and cuts the corn green and
shreds it blowing it into a silo

The idea is to get the cost of the corn crop back through the price
paid by the butcher for your stock or hogs

Nobody ever did that around here declared young Pollock

And thats why nobody gets ahead very fast around here Henry why
dont you strike out and do something newjust to surprise em

Stop selling a little tad of this and a little tad of that off the
farm and stick to the good farmers rule Never sell anything off the
place that cant walk off

Ive heard that before said Henry sighing

And even then just so much fertility goes with every yoke of steers
or pair of fat hogs But it is less loss in proportion than when the
corn or oats or wheat itself is sold



CHAPTER XXIX LETTIE BRONSONS CORN HUSKING

Sister had begun school on the very first day it openedin September
She was delighted for although she had had lessons at the
institution they had not been like this regular attendance with
other free and happy children at a good country school

Sister was growing not alone in body but in mind And the improvement
in her appearance was something marvelous

It certainly does astonish me every time I think o that youngun
and the way she looked when she come to me from the charity school
declared Mother Atterson

Whod want a better lookin youngun now Shed be the pride of any
mothers heart shed be

If theres folks belongin to her and they have neglected her all
these years in my opinion theyre lackin in sense Hiram

They certainly have been lacking in the milk of human kindness
admitted the young farmer

Huh That milks easily soured in many folks responded Mrs
Atterson But Sisters folks whoever they be will be sorry some day

You dont suppose she really has any family do you demanded Hiram

No father nor mother I expect But many a family will get rid of
a youngun too small to be of any use when they probably have many
children of their own

And if there was a little bait of money coming to the child as that
lawyer told the institution matron that would be another reason for
losing her in this great world

Im afraid Sister will never find her folks Mrs Atterson said
Hiram shaking his head

Huh If she dont its no loss to her Its loss to them declared
the old lady And Id hate to have anybody come and take her away from
us now

Sister no longer wore her short hair in four pigtails She had learned
to dress it neatly like other girls of her age and although it would
never be like the beautiful blueblack tresses of Lettie Bronson Hiram
had to admit that the soft brown of Sisters hair waving so prettily
over her forehead made the girls features more than a little
attractive

She was an entirely different person too from the one who had helped
Lettie and her friends ashore from the grounded motorboat that day so
long agoand so Lettie herself thought when she rode into the Atterson
yard one October day on her bay horse and Sister met her on the porch

Why youre Mrs Attersons girl arent you cried Lettie leaning
from her saddle to offer her hand to Sister I wouldnt have known
you

Sister was getting plump she had roses in her cheeks and she wore a
neat whole and becoming dress

Youre Miss Bronson said Sister gravely I wouldnt forget you

Perhaps there was something in what Sister said that stung Lettie
Bronsons memory She flushed a little but then she smiled most
charmingly and asked for Hiram

Husking corn Miss with Henry Pollock down on the bottomland

Oh way down there Well you tell himWhy Ill want you to come
too laughed Lettie quite at her best now

Nobody could fail to answer Lettie Bronsons smile with its reflection
when she chose to exert herself in that direction

Why I just came to tell you both that on Friday were going to have an
oldfashioned huskingbee for all the young folks of the neighborhood
at our place You must come yourselferSister and tell Hiram to
come too

Seven oclock sharp rememberand Ill be dreadfully disappointed if
you dont come added Lettie turning her horses head homeward and
saying it with so much cordiality that her hearers heart warmed

She is pretty mused Sister watching the bay horse and its rider
flying along the road I dont blame Hiram for thinking shes the very
finest girl in these parts

She is declared Sister emphatically and shook herself

Hiram had finished husking the lowland corn that day with Henrys help
and it was all drawn in at night When the last measured basket was
heaped in the crib by lantern light the young farmer added up the
figures chalked up on the lintel of the door

For goodness sake Hiram it isnt as much as that is it gasped
Henry viewing the figures the young farmer wrote proudly in his
memorandum book

Six acressix hundred and eighty baskets of sound corn crowed
Hiram And its corn that is corn as Mr Bronson says

Its not quite as hard as the upland corn for the growing season was
not quite long enough for it but its better than the average in the
county

Three hundred and forty bushel of shelled corn from six acres cried
Henry I should say it was Its worth fifty cents now right at the
criba hundred and seventy dollars Hiram thatll make dad let me go
to the agricultural college

What cried Hiram surprised and pleased Have you really got that
idea in your head

I been gnawin on it ever since you talked so last spring admitted
his friend rather shyly I told father and at first he poohpoohed

But I kept on pointing out to him how much more you knowed than we
did

Thats nonsense Henry interrupted Hiram Only about some things I
wouldnt want to set myself up over the farmers of this neighborhood as
knowing so much

Well youve proved it Dad says so himself He was taken all aback
when I showed him how you had beat him on the tomato crop And I been
talking to him about your corn

That hit father where he lived chuckled Henry for fathers a
corngrowing manand always has been considered so in this county

He watched the way you tilled your crop and he believed so much
shallow cultivating was wrong and said so But he says you beat him
on poor ground and when I tell him what that lowland figures up hell
throw up his hands

And Im going to take a course in fertilizers farm management and the
chemistry of soils continued Henry

Just as you say I believe we have been planting the wrong crops on the
right land Anyway Ill find out I believe weve got a good farm but
were not getting out of it what we should

Well Henry admitted Hiram slowly nothings pleased me so much
since I came into this neighborhood as to hear you say this You get
all you can at the experiment station this winter and I believe that
your father will soon begin to believe that there is something in book
farming after all

If it had not been for the hairhung sword over them Mrs Atterson and
Hiram would have taken great delight in the generous crops that had been
vouchsafed to them

Still we cant complain said the old lady and for the first time
for moren twenty years Im going to be really thankful at Thanksgiving
time

Oh I believe you cried Sister who heard her No boarders

Nope said the old lady quietly Youre wrong For were going
to have boarders on Thanksgiving Day Ive writ to Crawberry Anybody
thats in the old house now that wants to come to eat dinner with us
can come Im going to cook the best dinner I ever cookedand make a
milkpail full of gravy

I know said the good old soul shaking her head that them two old
maids I sold out to have half starved them boys We ought to be able to
stand even Fred Crackit and Mr Peebles one day in the year

Well returned Sister thoughtfully If you can stand em I can I
never did think I could forgive em allso mean they was to meand the
hairpulling and all

But I guess youre right Mis Atterson Its heapin coals of fire on
their heads like what the minister at the chapel says

Good Land o Goshen child exclaimed the old lady briskly Hot
coals would scotch em and I only want to fill their stomachs for
once

The husking at the Bronsons was a very well attended feast indeed
There was a great barn floor and on this were heaped the earcorn in
the husksnot too much for Lettie proposed having the floor cleared
and swept for square dancing and later for the supper

She had a lot of her school friends at the husking and at first the
neighborhood boys and girls were bashful in the company of the city
girls

But after they got to work husking the corn and a few red ears had been
found for which each girl or boy had to pay a forfeit they became a
very hilarious company indeed

Now Lettie broadly hospitable had invited the young folk far and
wide Even those whom she had not personally seen were expected to
attend

So it was not surprising that Pete Dickerson should come despite the
fact that Mr Bronson had once discharged him from his employand for
serious cause

But Pete was not a thinskinned person Where there was anything doing
he wanted to cut a figure And his desire to be important and be marked
by the company began to make him objectionable before the evening was
half over

For instance he thought it was funny to take a run down the long barn
floor and leap over the heads of those huskers squatting about a heap
of corn and land with his heavy boots on the apex of the pile thus
scattering the ears in all directions

He got long straws too and tickled the backs of the girls necks or
he dumped handfuls of bran down their backs or shook oats into their
hairand the oats stuck

Mr Bronson could not see to everything and Pete was very sly at his
tricks A girl would shriek in one corner and the lout would quickly
transport himself to a distant spot

When the corn was swept aside and the floor cleared for the dance Pete
went beyond the limit however He had found a pail of softsoap in the
shed and while the crowd was out of the barn playing a round game
in the yard while it was being swept Pete slunk in with the soap and a
swab and managed to spread a good deal of the slippery stuff around on
the boards

A broom would not remove this softsoap When the hostler swept he
only spread it And when the dancing began many a couple measured their
length on the planks to Petes great delight

But the hired man had observed Pete sneaking about while he was removing
the last of the corn and Hiram Strong discovered softsoap on Petes
clothes and the smell of it strong upon his unwashed hands

You get out of here Mr Bronson told the boy I had occasion to put
you off my land once and dont let me have to do it a third time
and he shoved him with no gentle hand through the door and down the
driveway

But Pete laid it all to Hiram He called back over his shoulder


Ill be square with you yet Hi Strong You wait

But Hiram bad been threatened so often from that quarter by now that he
was not much interested



CHAPTER XXX ONE SNOWY MIDNIGHT

The fun went on after that with more moderation and everybody had a
pleasant time That is so supposed Hiram Strong until in going out of
the barn again to get a breath of cool air after one of the dances he
almost stumbled over a figure hiding in a corner and crying

Why Sister he cried taking the girl by the shoulders and turning
her about Whats the matter

Oh I want to go home Hi This isnt any place for me Let meme
runrun home she sobbed

I guess not Whos bothered you Has that Pete Dickerson come back

No sobbed Sister

What is it then

Theythey dont want me here They dont like me

Who dont demanded Hiram sternly

Thosethose girls from St Beris II tried to dance and I slipped
on some of that horrid soap andand fell down And they said I was
clumsy And one said

Oh all these country girls are like that I dont see what Let wanted
them here for

Sot we could all show off better said another laughing some more

And I guess thats right enough finished Sister They dont want me
here Only to make fun of And I wish I hadnt come

Hiram was smitten dumb for a moment He had danced once with Lettie but
the other town girls had given him no opportunity to do so And it was
plain that Letties school friends preferred the few boys who had come
up from town to any of the farmers sons who had come to the husking

I guess youre right Sister They dont want usmuch admitted
Hiram slowly

Then lets both go home said Sister sadly

No That wouldnt be serving Mr Bronsonor Lettieright We were
invited in good faith I reckon and the Bronsons havent done anything
to offend us

But you and Ill go back there and dance together You dance with
meor with Henry and Ill stick to the country girls If Lettie
Bronsons friends from boarding school think they are so much better
than us folks out here in the country let us show them that we can have
a good time without them

Oh Ill go back with you Hiram cried Sister gladly and the young
fellow was a bit consciencestricken as he noted her changed tone and
saw the sparkle that came into her eye

Had he neglected Sister because Lettie Bronson was about Well perhaps
he had But he made up for it with the attention he paid to Sister
during the remainder of the evening

They went home early however and Hiram felt somewhat grave after the
corn husking Had Lettie Bronson invited the countrybred young folk
living about her fathers home to meet her boarding school friends
and the town boys merely that the latter might be compared with the
farmerfolk to their disfavor

He could not believe thatreally Lettie Bronson might be thoughtless
and a little proud but she was still a princess to Hiram and he could
not think this evil of her

But there were too many duties every day for the young farmer to give
much thought to such problems Harvesting was not complete yet and
soon flurries of snow began to drive across the fields and threaten the
approach of winter

Finally the wind came out of the northwest for more than a day and
toward evening the flakes began to fall faster and faster thicker and
thicker

Its going to be a snowy nighta real baby blizzard declared Hiram
stamping his feet on the porch before coming into the warm kitchen with
the milkpail

Oh dear And I thought youd go over to Pollocks with me tonight
Hi said Sister

Mabel an I are goin to make our Christmas presents together and
shes expecting me

Shucks Twont be fit for a girl to go out if it snows said Mother
Atterson

But Hiram saw that Sister was much disappointed and he had tried to be
kinder to her since that night of the corn husking

Whats a little snow he demanded laughing Bundle up good Sister
and Ill go over with you I want to see Henry anyway

Crazy younguns observed Mother Atterson But she made no real
objection Whatever Hiram said was right in the old ladys eyes

They tramped through the snowy fields with a lantern and found it
halfknee deep in some drifts before they arrived at the Pollocks short
as had been the duration of the fall

But they were welcomed vociferously at the neighbors preparations were
made for a long evenings fun for with the snow coming down so steadily
there would be little work done out of doors the following day so the
family need not seek their beds early

The Pollock children had made a good store of nuts like the squirrels
and there was plenty of corn to pop and molasses for candy or
cornballs and red apples to roast and sweet cider from the casks in
the cellar

The older girls retired to a corner of the wide hearth with their
workboxes and Hiram and Henry worked out several problems regarding
the latters elevenweek course at the agricultural college which would
begin the following week while the young ones played games until they
fell fast asleep in odd corners of the big kitchen

It was nearly midnight indeed when Hiram and Sister started home And
it was still snowing and snowing heavily

Well have to get all the plows out tomorrow morning Henry shouted
after them from the porch

And it was no easy matter to wade home through the heavy drifts

I never could have done it without you Hi declared the girl when
she finally floundered onto the Atterson porch panting and laughing

Ill take a look around the barns before I come in remarked the
careful young farmer

This was a duty he never neglected no matter how late he went to bed
nor how tired he was Half way to the barn he halted A light was waving
wildly by the Dickerson back door

It was a lantern and Hiram knew that it was being whirled around and
around somebodys head He thought he heard too a shouting through the
falling snow

Somethings wrong over yonder thought the young farmer

He hesitated but for a moment He had never stepped upon the Dickerson
place nor spoken to Sam Dickerson since the trouble about the turkeys
The lantern continued to swing Eagerly as the snow came down it could
not blind Hiram to the waving light

Ive got to see about this he muttered and started as fast as he
could go through the drifts across the fields

Soon he heard the voice shouting It was Sam Dickerson And he evidently
had been shouting to Hiram seeing his lantern in the distance

Help Strong Help he called

What is it man demanded Hiram climbing the last pair of bars and
struggling through the drifts in the dooryard

Will you take my horse and go for the doctor I dont know where Pete
isdown to Cale Schells I expect

Whats the matter Mr Dickerson

Sarahs fell down the bark stairsfell backward Struck her head an
aint spoke since Will you go Mr Strong

Certainly Which horse will I take

The bays saddledunder the shedget any doctorI dont care which
one But get him here

I will Mr Dickerson Leave it to me promised Hiram and ran to the
shed at once



CHAPTER XXXI MR DAMOCLESS SWORD

Hiram Strong was not likely to forget that long and arduous night It
was impossible to force the horse out of a walk for the drifts were in
some places to the creatures girth

He stopped at the house for a minute and roused Mrs Atterson and Old
Lem and sent them over to help the unhappy Dickersons

He was nearly an hour getting to the crossroads store There were lights
and revelry there Some of the lingering crowd were snowbound for the
night and were making merry with hard cider and provisions which Schell
was not loath to sell them

Pete was one of the number and Hiram sent him home with the news of his
mothers serious hurt

He forced the horse to take him into town to Dr Broderick It was
nearly two oclock when he routed out the doctor and it was four
oclock when the physician and himself in a heavy sleigh and behind a
pair of mules reached the Dickerson farmhouse

The woman had not returned to consciousness and Mrs Atterson remained
through the day to do what she could But it was many a tedious week
before Mrs Dickerson was on her feet again and able to move about

Meanwhile more than one kindly act had Mother Atterson done for the
neighbors who had seemed so careless of her rights Pete never appeared
when either Mrs Atterson or Sister came to the house but in his sour
gloomy way Sam Dickerson seemed to be grateful

Hiram kept away as there was nothing he could do to help them And he
saw when Pete chanced to pass him that the youth felt no more kindly
toward him than he had before

Well let him be as ugly as he wants to beonly let him keep away from
the place and let our things alone thought Hiram Goodness knows Im
not anxious to be counted among Pete Dickersons particular friends

Thanksgiving came on apace and every one of the old boarders of
Mother Atterson had written that he would come to the farm to spend the
holiday Even Mr Peebles acknowledged the invitation with thanks but
adding that he hoped Sister would not forget he must eschew any viands
at all greasy and that his hot water was to be at 101 exactly

The poor ninny ejaculated Mother Atterson He doesnt know what he
wants Sister only poured it out of the teakettle and he had to wait
for it to cool anyway before he could drink it

But it was determined to give the city folk a good time and this
determination was accomplished Two of Sisters turkeys bought and
paid for in hard cash by Mother Atterson graced the long table in the
sittingroom

Many of the good things with which the table was laden came from the
farm And without Hiram and Sister and Old Lem Camp Mrs Atterson
made even Fred Crackit understand these good things had not been
possible

But the Crawberry folk as a whole were much subdued They had missed
Mother Atterson dreadfully and really they had felt some affection
for their old landlady after all

After dinner Fred Crackit in a speech that was designed to be humorous
presented a massive silver plated waterpitcher with Mother Atterson
engraved upon it And really the old lady broke down at that

Good Land o Goshen she exclaimed Why you boys do think something
of the old woman after all dont ye

I must say that I got ye out here more than anything to show ye what we
could do in the country Specially how it had improved Sister And how
Hiram Strong warnt the ninny you seemed to think he was And that Mr
Camp only needed a chance to be something in the world again

Well well It wasnt a generous feeling I had toward you mebbe but
Im glad you come andI hope you all had enough gravy

So the occasion proved a very pleasant one indeed And it made a happy
break in the hard work of preparing for the winter

The crops were all gathered ere this and they could make up their books
for the season just passed

But there was wood to get in for all along they had not had wood
enough and to try and get wood out of the snowy forest in winter for
immediate use in the stoves was a task that Hiram did not enjoy

He had Henry to help him saw a goodly pile before the first snow fell
and Mr Camp split most of it and he and Sister piled it in the shed

Weve got to haul up enough logs by Marchor earlierto have a wood
sawing in earnest announced Hiram We must get a gasoline engine and
saw and call on the neighbors for help and have a sawingbee

But what will be the use of that if weve got to leave here in
February demanded Mrs Atterson worriedly The last time I saw that
Pepper in town he grinned at me in a way that made me want to break my
old umbrel over his dratted head

I dont care said Hiram sullenly I dont want to sit idle all
winter Ill cut the logs anyway and draw em out from time to time
If we have to leave why we have to thats all

And we cant tell a thing to do about next year till we know what
Pepper is going to do groaned Mrs Atterson

That is very true But if he doesnt exercise his option before
February tenth we neednt worry any more And after that will be time
enough to make our plans for next seasons crops declared Hiram
trying to speak more cheerfully

But Mrs Atterson went around with clouded brow again and was heard to
whisper more than once something about Mr Damocless sword



CHAPTER XXXII THE CLOUD IS LIFTED

Despite Hiram Strongs warning to his employer when they started work
on the old Atterson Eighty that she must expect no profit for this
seasons work the Christmastide when they settled their accounts for
the year proved the young fellow to have been a bad prophet

Why Hiram after I pay you this hundred dollars I shall have a little
money leftI shall indeed And all that corn in the criband stacks of
fodder beside the barn loft full and the roots and the chickens and
the pork and the calf

Why Hiram Im a richer woman today than when I came out here to the
farm thats sure How do you account for it

Hiram had to admit that they had been favored beyond his expectations

If that Pepper man would only come forard and say what he was going to
do sighed Mother Atterson

That was the continual complaint now As the winter advanced all four
of the family bore the option in mind continually There was talk of the
railroad going before the Legislature to ask for the condemnation of the
property it needed in the spring

It seemed pretty well settled that the survey along the edge of the
Atterson Eighty would be the route selected And if that was the case
why did Pepper not try to exercise his option

Mr Strickland had said that there was no way by which the real estate
mans hand could be forced so they had to abide Peppers pleasure

If we only knew wed stay said Hiram Id cut a few well grown pine
trees while I am cutting the firewood have them dragged to the mill
and saw the boards we shall need if we go into the celery business this
coming season

What do you want boards for demanded Henry who chanced to be home
over Christmas and was at the house

For bleaching Saves time room and trouble Banking celery even with
a plow is not alone oldfashioned and cumbersome but is apt to leave
the blanched celery much dirtier

But youll need an awful lot of board for six acres Hiram gasped
Henry

I dont know I shall run the trenches four feet apart and you mustnt
suppose Henry that I shall blanch all six acres at once The boards
can be used over and over again

I didnt think of that admitted his friend

Henry was eagerly interested in his selected studies at the experiment
station and college and Abel Pollock followed his sons work there with
growing approval too

It does beat all he admitted to Hiram what that boy has learned
already about practical things Bookfarming aint all flapdoodle
thats sure

So the year endedquietly peacefully and with no little happiness
in the Atterson farmhouse despite the cloud that overshadowed the
farmtitle and the doubts which faced them about the next seasons
work

They sat up on New Years eve to see the old year out and the new in
and had a merry evening although there were only the family When the
distant whistles blew at midnight they went out upon the back porch to
listen

It was a dark night for thick clouds shrouded the stars Only the
unbroken coverlet of snow it had fallen that morning aided them to see
about the empty fields

In the far distance was the twinkle of a single lightthat in an upper
chamber of the Pollock house Dickersons was mantled in shadow and
those two houses were the only ones in sight of the Atterson place

And I was afraid when we came out here that Id be dead of loneliness
in a monthwith no near neighbors admitted Mother Atterson But Ive
been so busy that I aint never minded it

Whats that light Hiram

Her cry was echoed by Sister Behind the bam a sudden glow was spreading
against the lowhung clouds It was too far away for one of their
outbuildings to be afire but Hiram set off immediately although he
only had slippers on for the corner of the barnyard fence

When he reached this point he saw that one of the fodder stacks in the
cornfield was afire The whole top of the stack was ablaze

Oh dear Oh dear cried Sister who had followed him What can we
do

Nothing said Hiram Theres no wind and it wont spread to another
stack But that one is past redemption for sure

Hiram hastened back to the house and put on his boots But he did not
wade through the snow to the fodder stack that was burning so briskly
He merely made a detour around it at some yards distant Nowhere did he
see the mark of a footprint

How the stack had been set afire was a mystery Hiram had stacked the
fodder himself with the help of Sister who had pitched the bundles up
to him The young farmer did not smoke and he seldom carried matches
loose in his pockets

Therefore the idea that he had dropped a match in the fodder and a
field mouse burrowing for some nubbin of corn had come across the
match nibbled the head and so set the blaze was scarcely feasible

Yet how else had the fire started

When daylight came Hiram could find no footprint near the stackonly
his own where he had circled it while it was blazing

It was the stack nearest to the Dickerson line Hiram naturally
thought of Pete

Since Mrs Dickersons sickness Mother Atterson had been back and forth
to help her neighbor and whenever Sam Dickerson saw Hiram he was as
friendly as it was in the nature of the man to be

Hiram could not believe that Petes father would now countenance any
of his sons meannesses yet when the young farmer went along the line
fence he saw fresh tracks across the Dickerson fields and discovered
where the person had stood on the Dickerson side of the fence opposite
the burned fodder stack

But these footprints were all of three hundred feet from the stack and
there was not a mark in the snow upon Hirams side of the fence saving
his own footprints

Maybe somebody merely ran across to look at the blaze But its strange
I did not see him thought Hiram

He could not help being suspicious however and he prowled about the
stacks and the barns more than ever at night He could not shake off the
feeling that the enemy in the dark was at work again

January passed and the fatal daythe tenth of Februarydrew nearer
and nearer If Pepper proposed to exercise his option he must do it on
or before that date

Neither Hiram nor Mrs Atterson had seen the real estate man of late
but they had seen Mr Strickland and on the final day they drove to
town to meet Pepperif the man was going to show upin the lawyers
office

I wouldnt trouble him if I were you advised the lawyer But if you
insist Ill send over for him

I want to know what he means by all this declared Mrs Atterson
angrily Hes kept me on tenterhooks for ten months and there ought
to be some punishment for the crime

I am afraid he has been within his rights said the lawyer smiling
but he sent his clerk for the real estate man probably being very well
convinced of the outcome of the affair

In came the snaky Mr Pepper The moment he saw Mrs Atterson and Hiram
he began to cackle

Ye dont mean to say you come clean in here this stormy day to try and
sell that farm to me asked the real estate man No maam Not for no
sixteen hundred dollars If youll take twelve

Mrs Atterson could not find words to reply to him and Hiram felt like
seizing the scoundrel by the scruff of his neck and throwing him down to
the street But it was Mr Strickland who interposed

So you do not propose to exercise your option

No indeedy

How long since did you give up the idea of purchasing the Atterson
place asked the lawyer curiously

Pshaw I gave up the idee way back there last spring chuckled
Pepper

You havent the paper with you have you Mr Pepper asked Mr
Strickland quietly

The real estate man looked wondrous sly and tapped the side of his nose
with a lean finger

Why I tore up that old paper long ago It warnt no good to me said
Pepper I wouldnt take the farm at that price for a gift and he
departed with a sneering smile upon his lips

And well he did destroy it declared Mr Strickland It was a
forgerythat is what it was And if we could have once got Pepper in
court with it he would not have turned another scaly trick for some
years to come



CHAPTER XXXIII CELERY MAD

The relief to the minds of Hiram Strong and Mrs Atterson was
tremendous

Especially was the young farmer inspired to greater effort He saw the
second growing season before him And he saw too that now indeed
he had that chance to prove his efficiency which he had desired all the
time

The past year had cost him little for clothing or other expenses He had
banked the hundred dollars Mrs Atterson had paid him at Christmas

But he looked forward to something much bigger than the other hundred
when the next Christmastide should come Twentyfive per cent of all
the profit of the Atterson Eighty during this second year was to be his
own

The moment Mr Damocless sword as Mother Atterson had called it was
lifted the young farmer jumped into the work

He had already cut enough wood to last the family a year now he got Mr
Pollock with his team of mules to haul it up to the house and then
sent for the power saw asked the neighbors to help and in less than
half a day every stick was cut to stove length

As he had time Hiram split this wood and Lem Camp piled it in the shed
Hiram knocked together some extra coldframes too and bought some
secondhand sash

And he had already dug a pit for a twelvefoot hotbed Now a
twelvefoot hotbed will start an enormous number of plants

Hiram did not plan to have quite so much small stuff in the garden this
year however He knew that he should have less time to work in the
garden He proposed having more potatoes about as many tomatoes as the
year before but fewer roots to bunch salads and the like He must give
the bulk of his time to the big commercial crop that he hoped to put
into the bottomland

He had little fear of the river overflowing its banks late enough in the
season to interfere with the celery crop For the seedlings were to be
handled in the coldframes and gardenpatch until it was time to set
them in the trenches And that would not be until July

He contented himself with having the logs he cut drawn to the sawmill
and the sawed planks brought down to the edge of the bottomland and
did not propose to put a plow into the land until late June

Meanwhile he started his celery seed in shallow boxes and when the
plants were an inch and a half or so tall he pricked them out two
inches apart each way into the coldframes

Sister and Mr Camp could help in this work and they soon filled the
coldframes with celery plants destined to be reset in the garden plat
later

This handling of celery aids its growth and development in a most
wonderful manner At the second transplanting Hiram snipped back the
tops and the roots as well so that each plant would grow sturdily and
not be too stalky

Mrs Atterson declared they were all celery mad Whatever will you do
with so much of the stuff I havent the least idee Hiram Can you sell
it all Why it looks to me as though you had set out enough already to
glut the Crawberry market

And I guess thats right returned Hiram Especially if I shipped it
all at once

But he was aiming higher than the Crawberry market He had been in
correspondence with firms that handled celery exclusively in some of the
big cities and before ever he put the plow into the bottomland he
had arranged for the marketing of every stalk he could grow on his six
acres

It was a truth that the family of transplanted boarding house people
worked harder this second spring than they had the first one But they
knew how better too and the garden work did not seem so arduous to
Sister and Old Lem Camp

Mrs Atterson had a fine flock of hens and they had laid well after the
first of December and the eggs had brought good prices She planned to
increase her flock build larger yards and in time make a business of
poultry raising as that would be something that she and Sister could
practically handle alone

Sisters turkeys had thrived so the year before that she had saved two
hens and a handsome gobbler and determined to breed turkeys for the
fall market

And Sister learned a few things before she had raised that raft
of poults as Mother Atterson called them Turkeys are certainly
calculated to breed patienceespecially if one expects to have a flock
of young Toms and hens fit for killing at Thanksgivingtime

She hatched the turkeys under motherly hens belonging to Mother
Atterson striving to breed poults that would not trail so far from the
house but as soon as the youngsters began to feel their wings they had
their fostermothers pretty well worn out One flock tolled the old hen
off at least a mile from the house and Hiram had some work enticing the
poults back again

There was no raid made upon her turkey coops this year however Pete
Dickerson was not much in evidence during the spring and early summer
Mrs Atterson went back and forth to the neighbors but although
whenever Hiram saw the farmer the latter put forth an effort to be
pleasant to him the two households did not well mix

Besides during this busiest time of the year when the crops were
getting started there seemed to be little opportunity for social
intercourse At least so it seemed on the Atterson place

They were a busy and well contented crew and everything seemed to be
running like clockwork when suddenly another dish of trouble as
Mother Atterson called it was served them in a most unexpected manner

Hiram was coming up from the barn one evening long after dark and had
just caught sight of Sister standing on the porch waiting for him when
a sudden glow against the dark sky made him turn

The flash of fire passed on the instant and Sister called to him

Oh Hiram did you see that shootingstar

You never wished on it Sis said the young farmer

Oh yes I did she returned dancing down the steps to meet him

That quick

Just that quick she reiterated seizing his arm and getting into step
with him

And what was the wish demanded Hiram

WhyI wont ever get it if I tell you will I she queried shyly

Just as likely to as not Sister he said with serious voice Wishes
are funny things you know Sometimes the very best ones never come
true

And Im afraid mine will never come true she sighed Oh dear I
guess no amount of wishing will ever bring some things to pass

Maybe thats so Sis he said chuckling I fancy that getting out
and hustling for the thing you want is the best way to fulfill wishes

Oh but I cant do that in this case said the girl shaking her head
and still speaking very seriously as they came to the porch steps

Maybe I can bring it about for you teased Hiram

I guess not she said I want so to be like other girls Hiram Id
like to be like that pretty Lettie Bronson Im not jealous of her
looks and her clothes and her good times and all no thats not it
proclaimed Sister with a little break in her voice

But Id like to know who I really be I want folks andand I want to
have a real name of my own

Why bless you exclaimed the young fellow Sister is a nice name
Im sureand we all love it here

But it isnt a name They call me Sissy Atterson at school But it
doesnt belong to me IIve thought lots about choosing a name for
myselfa real fancy one you know Theres lots of pretty names she
said reflectively

Cords of em Hiram agreed

But you see they wouldnt really be mine said the girl earnestly
Not even after I had chosen them I want my very own name I want to
know who I am and all about myself Andwith a half strangled sobI
guess wishing will never bring me that will it Hiram

Never before had the young fellow heard Sister express herself upon this
topic He had no idea that the girl felt her unknown and practically
unnamed existence so strongly

I wouldnt care Sis he said patting her bent shoulders We love
you here just as well as we would if you had ten names Dont forget
that

And maybe it wont be all a mystery some day Your folks may look you
up They may come here and find you And theyll be mighty proud of
youyouve grown so tall and good looking Of course they will

Sister listened to him and gave a little contented sigh And then they
might want to take me awayand Id fight tooth and nail if they tried
it

What gasped Hiram

Of course I would said the girl Do you suppose Id give up Mother
Atterson for a dozen familiesor for clothesand housesor or
anything and she ran into the house leaving the young farmer in some
amazement

Aint that the girl of it he muttered at last Yet I bet she is in
earnest about wanting to know about her folks

And from that time Hiram thought more about Sisters problem himself
than he had before Once when he went to Crawberry he went to the
charitable institution from which Mother Atterson had taken Sister But
the matron had heard nothing of the lawyer who had once come to talk
over the childs affairs and the path of inquiry seemed shut off right
there by an impassable barrier

However this is ahead of our story On this particular night Hiram
washed at the pump and then followed Sister in to supper

Before they were half through Mr Camp suddenly started from his chair
and pointed through the window

Flames were rising behind the barn again

Another stack burning exclaimed Hiram and be shot out of the door
seizing a pail of water hoping that he might put it out

But the stack was doomed He knew it the moment he saw the extent of the
blaze

He kept away from it as he had before yet he did not expect to pick up
any trail of the incendiary near the stack

Twice in the same place is too much declared the young farmer
glowing with wrath Im going to have this mystery explained or know
the reason why

He left Mr Camp to watch the burning fodder to see that sparks from
the stack did no harm and lighting his lantern he went along the line
fence again

Yes there were the footprints that he had expected to find But the
burning stack was even farther from the fence than the first one
had beenand there were no marks of feet in the soft earth on Mrs
Attersons side of the boundary



CHAPTER XXXIV CLEANING UP A PROFIT

Hiram crawled through the wires and followed the plain footmarks back
to the Dickerson sheds He lost them there of course but he knew by
the size of the footprints that either Sam Dickerson or his oldest son
had been over to the line fence

And that shootingstar considered Hiram There was something peculiar
about that I wonder if there wasnt a shooting star also away back
there at New Years when our other stack of fodder was burned

He loitered about the sheds for a few moments It appeared as though all
the Dickersons were indoors Nobody interfered with him

Of a sudden Hiram began to sniff an odor that seemed strange about a
cartshed At least no wise farmer would have naphtha or gasoline in
his outbuildings for it would make his insurance invalid

But that was the smell Hiram discovered And he was not long in finding
the cause of it

Back in a dark corner upon a beam lay a big slingshotone of those
that boys swing around their heads with a stone in the heel of it and
then let go one end to shoot the missile to a distance

The leather loop was saturated with the gasoline and it had been
scorched too The smell of burning as well as the smell of gasoline
was very distinct

Hiram took the slingshot with him and went up to the Dickerson house

He had got along so well with the Dickersons for these past months
that he honestly shrank from starting anything now Yet he could not
overlook this flagrant piece of malicious mischief Indeed it was more
than that Two stacks had already been burned and it might be some of
the outbuildingsor even Mrs Attersons housenext time

Besides Hiram felt himself responsible for his employers property The
old lady could not afford to lose the fodder and Hiram was determined
that both of the burned stacks should be paid for in full

He looked through the window of the Dickerson kitchen The family was
around the supper tableMr and Mrs Dickerson Pete and the children
little and big It was a cheerful family group after all Rough and
uncouth as the farmer was Dickerson likely had his feelings like other
people Instead of bursting right in at the door as had been Hirams
intention and accusing Pete to his face the indignant young fellow
hesitated

He hadnt any sympathy for Pete not the slightest If he gave himor
the elder Dickersona chance to clear up matters by making good to Mrs
Atterson for what she had lost Hiram Strong decided that he was being
very lenient indeed

He stepped quietly onto the porch and rapped on the door Then he backed
off and waited for some response from within

Hullo Mr Strong exclaimed the farmer coming himself to the door
Why is that your stack burning

Yes sir said Hiram quietly

Another one

That is the second admitted Hiram But I dont propose that another
shall be set afire in just the same way

Sam Dickerson stepped suddenly down to the young farmers level and
asked

What do you mean by that Do you know how it got afire

Hiram held out the slingshot in the light of his lantern

A rag saturated with gasoline was wrapped around a pebble then set
afire and stone and blazing rag were shot from our line fence into the
fodderstack

I found the footprints of the incendiary on New Years morning at the
same place And Ill wager a good deal that your son Petes boots will
fit the footprints over there at the line now

Sam Dickersons face had turned exceedingly red and then paled But he
spoke very quietly

What are you going to do with him Mr Strong he asked It will be
five years for him at least if you take it to courtand maybe longer

I dont believe Mr Dickerson that you have upheld Pete in all the
mean tricks he has played on me

Indeed I havent And since I got a look at myselfback there when the
wife was hurt

Sam Dickersons voice broke and he turned away for a moment so that his
visitor should not see his face

Well he continued Youve got Pete right this timeno doubt of
that I dunno what makes him such a mean whelp Ill lambaste him good
for this now I tell you But the stacks

Make him pay for them out of his own money Mrs Atterson ought not to
lose the stacks said Hiram slowly

Oh hell do that anyway you can bet exclaimed Dickerson with
conviction

I dont believe that sending a boy like him to jail will either improve
his morals or do anybody else any good observed Hiram reflectively

And itll jest about finish his mother spoke Sam

Thats right too said the young farmer I tell you I dont want
to see himnot just now But you do what you think is best about this
matter and make Peter pay the billten dollars for the two stacks of
fodder

He shall do it Mr Strong declared Sam Dickerson warmly And he
shall beg your pardon too or Ill larrup him until he cant stand
Hes too big for a lickin but he aint too big for me to lick

And the elder Dickerson was as good as his word An hour later yells
from the cart shed denoted that Pete was finally getting what he should
have received when he was a younger boy

Before noon Sam marched the youth over to Mrs Atterson Pete was very
puffy about the eyes and his cheeks were streaked with tears Nor did
he seem to care to more than sit upon the extreme edge of a chair

But he paid Mrs Atterson ten dollars and then nudged by his father
turned to Hiram and begged the young farmers pardon

Thats all right etc said Hiram laying his hand upon the boys
shoulder Just because we havent got on well together heretofore
neednt make any difference between us after this

Come over and see me If you have time this summer and want the work
Ill be glad to hire you to help handle my celery crop

Neighbors ought to be neighborly and it wont do either of us any good
to hug to ourselves any injury which we fancy the other has done Well
be friends if you say so Peterthough I tell you right now that if you
turn another mean trick against me Ill take the law into my own hands
and give you worse than youve got already

Pete looked sheepish enough and shook hands He knew very well that
Hiram could do as he promised

But from that time on the young farmer had no further trouble with him

Meanwhile Hirams crops on the Atterson Eighty grew almost as well this
second season as they had the first There was a bad drouth this year
and the upland corn did not do so well yet the young farmers corn crop
compared well with the crops in the neighborhood

He had put in but eight acres of corn this year but they had plenty of
old corn in the crib when it came time to take down this second seasons
crop

It was upon the celery that Hiram bent all his energies He had to pay
out considerable for help but that was no more than he expected Celery
takes a deal of handling

When the long hot dry days came when the uplands parched and the
earth fairly seemed to radiate the heat the acres of tender plants
which Hiram and his helpers had just set out in the trenches began to
wilt most discouragingly

Henry Pollock who did all he could to aid Hiram on the crop shook his
head in despair

Its alayin down on you Hiramits alayin down on you Another
day like this and your celery crop will be pretty small pertaters

And that would be a transformation worthy of the attention of all
the agricultural schools Henry returned the young farmer grimly
laughing

You got a heartto laugh at your own loss said Henry

There isnt any lossyet declared Hiram

But theres bound to be said his friend a regular Jobs comforter
for the nonce

Look here Henry youd have me give up too easy Never say die
Thats the farmers motto

Jinks exclaimed young Pollock theyre dying all around us just the
sameand their crops too We aint going to have half a corn crop if
this spell of dry weather keeps on And the papers dont give us a sign
of hope

When there doesnt seem to be a sign of hope is when the really
uptodate farmer begins to actually work chuckled Hiram

And just tell me what youre going to do for this field of wilted
celery demanded Henry

Come on up to the house and Ill get Mother Atterson to give us an
early supper quoth Hiram Im going to town and I invite you to go
with me

Henry had got used by this time to Hirams little mysteries But this
seemed to him a case where man had done all that could be done for the
crop and without Providential interposition the whole field would
have to go to pot as he expressed it

And in his heart the young farmer knew that the outlook for a paying
crop of celery right then was very small indeed He had done his best
in preparing the soil in enriching it in raising the sets and
transplanting themup to this point he had brought his big commercial
crop at considerable expense If the drouth really got it he would
have at the most but a poor and stunted crop to ship in the Fall

But Hiram Strong was not the fellow to throw up his hands and own
himself beaten at such a time as this Here was an obstacle that must
be overcome The harder the problem looked the more determined he was to
solve it

The two boys drove to town that evening and Hiram sought out a man who
contracted to move houses clean cisterns and wells and various work
of that kind He knew this man had just the thing he needed and after
a conference with him Hiram loaded some bulky paraphernalia into the
light wagonit was so dark Henry could not see what it wasand they
drove home again

Id like to know what the Jim Hickey youre about Hiram sniffed
Henry in disgust Whats all this litter back here in the wagon

You come over and give me a hand in the morningearly now say by
sunupand youll find out I want a couple of husky chaps like you
chuckled Hiram Ill get Pete Dickerson to work against me

If you do you tell Pete hell have to work lively said Henry with
a grin I dont know what it is you want us to do but I reckon I can
keep my end up with Pete from hoein taters to cuttin cordwood

You can keep your end up with him can you chuckled Hiram Well I
bet you cant in this game Im going to put you two fellows up against

What Pete Dickerson beat me at anythingunless its sleeping
grunted Henry with vast disgust Ill keep my end up with him at
anything

And the more assured he was of this the more Hiram was amused Come
on over early Henry said the young farmer and Ill show you that
theres at least one thing in which you cant keep your end up with
Pete

His friend was almost angry when he started off across the fields for
home but he was mighty curious too That curiosity if nothing
more would have brought him to the Atterson house in good season the
following morning

Already however Hiram and Petewith the light wagonhad gone down
to the riverside Henry hurried after them and reached the celery field
just as the red face of the sun appeared

There had been little dew during the night and the tender transplants
had scarcely lifted their heads Indeed the last acre set out the day
before were flat

On the bank of the river and near that suffering acre were Hiram and
Pete Dickerson Henry hurried to them wondering at the thing he saw
upon the bank

Hiram was already laying out between the celery rows a long hosepipe
This was attached to a goodsized forcepump the feedpipe of which was
in the river It was a twoman pump and was worked by an upanddown
brake

Catch hold here Henry laughed Hiram One of you on each side now
and pump for all youre worth And see if Im not right my boy You
cant keep your end up with Pete at this job for if you do the water
wont flow

Henry admitted that he had been badly sold by the joke but he was
enthusiastic in his praise of Hirams ingenuity too

Aw say said the young farmer what do you suppose the Good Lord
gave us brains for Just so as to keep our fingers out of the fire No
sir With all this perfectly good and wet water running past my field
could I have the heart to let this celery die I guess not

He had a fine spray nozzle on the pipe and the pipe itself was long
enough so that by moving the pump occasionally he could water every
square foot of the big piece And the three young fellows by changing
about went over the field every other day in about four hours without
difficulty

By and by the celery plants got rooted well they no longer drooped in
the morning before the drouth was past the young farmer had as handsome
a field of celery as one would wish Indeed when he began to ship the
crop even his earliest crates were rated A1 by the produce men and he
bad no difficulty in selling the entire crop at the top of the market
right through the season

The garden paid a profit the potatoes did even better than the year
before and Hiram harvested and sold seventyfive dollars worth while
the price for new potatoes was high

He shipped most of his tomatoes this year for he could not pay
attention to the local market as he had the first season but the tomato
crop was a good one

They raised to eight weeks and sold during the year five pair of
shoats and Mrs Atterson bought a grade cow with her calf by her side
for a hundred dollars and made ten pounds of butter a week right
through the season

Old Lem Camp looking ten years younger than when he came to the farm
muscular and brown did all the work about the barns now milked the
cows and relieved Hiram of all the chores

Indeed with some little help about the plowing and cultivating Hiram
knew very well that Mrs Atterson and Old Lem could run the farm another
year without his help

Of course the old lady could not expect to put in any crop that would
pay her like the celery for when they footed up their books the
bottomland had yielded as Hiram had once prophesied to Mr Bronson
over four hundred dollars the acre net

Twentyfour hundred dollars income from six acres and the profit was
more than fifty per cent Indeed Hirams share of the profit amounted
to three hundred and seventy dollars

With his hundred dollar wage and the money he had saved the previous
season when the crops were harvested this second season the young
farmers bank book showed a balance of over five hundred dollars to his
credit

Im eighteen years old and over soliloquized the young farmer And
Ive got a capital of five hundred dollars Cant I turn that capital
some way go as to give me a biggera broaderchance

Thus far Ive been a onehorse farmer I want to be something better
than that Now theres no use in my hanging around here waiting for
something to turn up I must get a move on me and turn something up for
myself



CHAPTER XXXV LOOKING AHEAD

During this year Hiram had not seen much of Mr Bronson or Lettie They
had gone back to the West over the summer vacation and when Lettie
had returned for her last year at St Beris her father had not come on
until near Thanksgiving

Hiram had spoken with Lettie several times during the fail and he
thought that she had vastly improved in one way at least

She could not be any prettier it seemed to him but her manner was more
cordial and she always asked after Sister and Mrs Atterson and showed
that her interest in him was not a mere surface interest

One day when Hiram had been shipping some of the last of his celery
Lettie met him on the street near the Scoville railroad station Hiram
was in his high boots and overalls and Lettie was with two of her girl
friends

But the girl stopped him and shook hands and told him that her father
had arrived and wanted to see him

We want you to come to dinner Saturday evening Hiram Father insists
and I shall be very much disappointed if you do not come

Why thats very kind of you Miss Lettie responded the young farmer
slowly trying to find some good reason for refusing the invitation He
was determined not to be patronized

Now Hiram This is very important We want you to meet somebody said
Lettie her eyes dancing Somebody very particular Now do say youll
come like a good boy and not keep me teasing

Well Ill come Miss Lettie he finally agreed and she gave him a
most charming smile

Letties two friends had waited for her very much amused

I declare Let cried one of themand her voice reached Hirams ears
quite plainly You do have the queerest friends Why did you stop to
speak to that yokel

Hush hell hear you said Miss Bronson yet she smiled too So you
think Hiram is a yokel do you

Hiram repeated her friend Goodness me I should think the name was
enough And those bootsand overalls

Well said Lettie still amused Ive seen my own father in just such
a costume And you know very well that he is a pretty good looking man
dressed up

But Let your fathers never a farmer gasped the other girl

Why not

Oh shes just joking us laughed the third girl Of course hes a
farmerhe owns half a dozen farms But hes the kind of a farmer who
rides around in his automobile and looks over his crops

Well and this young man may do thatin time said Lettie At least
my father believes Hi is aimed that way

Nonsense

He doesnt look as though he had a cent said the third girl

He is putting away more money of his very own in the bank than any boy
we know who works Father says so declared Lettie He says Hi has
done wonderfully well with his crops this yearand he is only raising
them on shares

Let me tell you girls the farmer is coming into his own these
days That is a great saying of fathers He believes that the man
who produces the foodstuffs for the rest of the world should have a
satisfactory share of the proceeds of their sale And that is coming
father says

Farmers dont have to half starve and be burdened by mortgages and
ignorance any longer The country sections are waking up With good
schools and good roads and the grange and all many rural districts
are already ahead of the cities in the things worth while

Listen to Let lecture sniffed one of her friends

All right You wait Maybe youll see that same young fellowHi
Strongcome through this town in his own auto before you graduate from
St Beris

Pshaw exclaimed the other If I do Ill ask him for a ride and the
discussion ended in a laugh

Perhaps however had Hiram heard all Lettie had said he would not have
been so doubtful in regard to fulfilling his promise about taking dinner
with Mr Bronson and his daughter on Saturday evening

To tell the truth the more he thought of it the more he shrank from
the ordeal Once he had hoped Mr Bronson would be the one to show him
the way out of the backwater of Crawberry Hiram had not forgotten how
terribly disappointed he had been when he could not find the gentlemans
card in the sewer excavation

And later when Mr Bronson had suggested that he leave Mrs Atterson
and come to him to work Hiram feared that he had missed an opportunity
that would never be offered him again His contract was practically
over with his present employer and Hirams ambition urged him to desire
greater things in the farming line

It might be in Mr Bronsons power to aid the young farmer right along
this line The gentleman owned farms in the Middle West that were being
tilled on uptodate methods and by modern machinery Hiram desired
very strongly to get upon a place of that character He wished to learn
how to handle tools and machinery which it would never pay a onehorse
farmer to own But how deeply had the gentleman been offended
by Hirams refusal to come to work for him when he gave him that
opportunity That was a question that bit deep into the young farmers
mind

When he went to the Bronsons house on Saturday in good season Mr
Bronson met him cordially in the library

Well my boy they all tell me you have done it exclaimed the
Westerner

Done what queried Hiram

Made the most money per acre for Mrs Atterson that this county ever
saw Is that right

Ive succeeded in what I set out to do said Hiram modestly

And I did not believe myself that you could do it declared the
gentleman And its too bad too that I was a Doubting Thomas added
Mr Bronson his eyes beginning to dance a good deal like Letties

You see Hiram I had it in my mind when I took this place to get a
young men from around here and teach him something of my ways of work
and finally take him back West with me

I have several farms that are paying me good incomes but good
farmmanagers are hard to get I wanted to train onea young man I
ran against a promising lad before you came to the Atterson place but I
lost track of him

Had you been willing to leave Mrs Atterson and come to me continued
Mr Bronson I believe I could have licked you into shape last season
so that you would have suited me very well and he laughed outright

But now I want you to meet my future farmmanager He is the very
fellow I wanted before I offered the chance to you I reckon youll be
glad to see him

While he was talking Mr Bronson had put his hand on Hirams shoulder
and urged him down the length of the room They had come to a heavy
portiere Hiram thought it masked a doorway

Here is the fellow himself exclaimed Bronson suddenly

The curtain was whisked away Hiram heard Lettie giggling somewhere
in the folds of it And he found himself staring straight into a long
mirror which reflected both himself and the laughing Mr Bronson

Hiram Strong spoke the Westerner admonishingly why didnt you tell
me long ago that you were the lad who turned my horses out of the ditch
that evening back in Crawberry

Whywhy

His fatal modesty laughed Lettie appearing and clapping her hands

I guess it wasnt that said Hiram slowly What was the use I would
have been glad of your assistance at the time but when I found you I
had already made a contract with Mrs Atterson andwhat was the use

Well perhaps it would have made no difference When I had dug up the
fact that you were the same fellow whom I had looked for at Dwights
Emporium it struck me that possibly the character that old scoundrel
gave you had some basis in fact

So I said nothing to you after you had refused to break your contract
That Hiram was a good point in your favor And what that little girl
at your house has told Lettie about youand the way Mrs Atterson
speaks of you and alllong since convinced me that you were just the
lad I wanted

Now Hiram I believe you know a good deal about farming that I dont
know myself And at any rate if you can do what you have done with a
rundown place like the Atterson Eighty Id like to see what you can do
with a bigger and better farm

What do you say Will you come to meif only for a year Ill make it
worth your while

And that Hiram Strong did not let this opportunity slip past him will be
shown in the next volume of this series entitled Hiram in the Middle
West Or A Young Farmers Upward Struggle

He was sorry to leave Mrs Atterson at Christmas time but the old lady
saw that it was to Hirams advantage to go

And good land o Goshen Hiram I wouldnt stand in no boys waynot
a boy like you leastways Youve always been square with me and youve
given me a new lease of life For I never would have dared to give up
the boarding house and come to the farm if it hadnt been for you

This is your homejest as much as it is Sisters home and Old Lem
Camps Dont forgit that Hiram

Youll find us all here whenever you want to come back to it For Ive
talked with Mr Strickland and Im going to adopt Sister all reglar
and she shall have what I leave when I die only promising to give Mr
Camp a shelter if he should outlast me

Sisters folks may never look her up and she may never git that money
the institution folk think is coming to her But shell be well fixed
here thats sure

Indeed taking it all around everybody of importance to the story
seemed to be well fixed as Mother Atterson expressed it She herself
need never be disturbed by the vagaries of boarders or troubled in her
mind either waking or sleeping about the gravysave on Thanksgiving
Day

Old Lem Camp and Sister were provided for by their own exertions and
Mrs Attersons kindness The Dickersonseven Petehad become friendly
neighbors Henry Pollock had waked up his father and they were running
the Pollock farm on much more modern lines than before

And Hiram himself was looking ahead to a scheme of life that suited him
and to a chance to make good on a much larger scale than he had on the

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
