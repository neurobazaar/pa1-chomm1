PROLOGUE




IN THE MARQUESAS

It was about three oclock of a winters afternoon in Taiohae the
French capital and port of entry of the Marquesas Islands The trades
blew strong and squally the surf roared loud on the shingle beach and
the fiftyton schooner of war that carries the flag and influence of
France about the islands of the cannibal group rolled at her moorings
under Prison Hill The clouds hung low and black on the surrounding
amphitheatre of mountains rain had fallen earlier in the day real
tropic rain a waterspout for violence and the green and gloomy brow of
the mountain was still seamed with many silver threads of torrent

In these hot and healthy islands winter is but a name The rain had not
refreshed nor could the wind invigorate the dwellers of Taiohae
away at one end indeed the commandant was directing some changes in
the residency garden beyond Prison Hill and the gardeners being
all convicts had no choice but to continue to obey All other folks
slumbered and took their rest Vaekehu the native queen in her
trim house under the rustling palms the Tahitian commissary in his
beflagged official residence the merchants in their deserted stores
and even the clubservant in the club his head fallen forward on
the bottlecounter under the map of the world and the cards of navy
officers In the whole length of the single shoreside street with its
scattered board houses looking to the sea its grateful shade of palms
and green jungle of puraos no moving figure could be seen Only at
the end of the rickety pier that once in the prosperous days of the
American rebellion was used to groan under the cotton of John Hart
there might have been spied upon a pile of lumber the famous tattooed
white man the living curiosity of Taiohae


His eyes were open staring down the bay He saw the mountains droop
as they approached the entrance and break down in cliffs the surf boil
white round the two sentinel islets and between on the narrow bight
of blue horizon Uapu upraise the ghost of her pinnacled mountain tops
But his mind would take no account of these familiar features as he
dodged in and out along the frontier line of sleep and waking memory
would serve him with broken fragments of the past brown faces and
white of skipper and shipmate king and chief would arise before his
mind and vanish he would recall old voyages old landfalls in the hour
of dawn he would hear again the drums beat for a maneating festival
perhaps he would summon up the form of that island princess for the love
of whom he had submitted his body to the cruel hands of the tattooer
and now sat on the lumber at the pierend of Taiohae so strange
a figure of a European Or perhaps from yet further back sounds and
scents of England and his childhood might assail him the merry clamour
of cathedral bells the broom upon the foreland the song of the river
on the weir

It is bold water at the mouth of the bay you can steer a ship about
either sentinel close enough to toss a biscuit on the rocks Thus
it chanced that as the tattooed man sat dozing and dreaming he was
startled into wakefulness and animation by the appearance of a flying
jib beyond the western islet Two more headsails followed and before
the tattooed man had scrambled to his feet a topsail schooner of some
hundred tons had luffed about the sentinel and was standing up the bay
closehauled

The sleeping city awakened by enchantment Natives appeared upon all
sides hailing each other with the magic cry Ehippyship the Queen
stepped forth on her verandah shading her eyes under a hand that was
a miracle of the fine art of tattooing the commandant broke from his
domestic convicts and ran into the residency for his glass the harbour
master who was also the gaoler came speeding down the Prison Hill the
seventeen brown Kanakas and the French boatswains mate that make up
the complement of the warschooner crowded on the forward deck and the
various English Americans Germans Poles Corsicans and Scotsthe
merchants and the clerks of Taiohaedeserted their places of
business and gathered according to invariable custom on the road
before the club

So quickly did these dozen whites collect so short are the distances
in Taiohae that they were already exchanging guesses as to the
nationality and business of the strange vessel before she had gone
about upon her second board towards the anchorage A moment after
English colours were broken out at the main truck

I told you she was a Johnny Bullknew it by her headsails said an
evergreen old salt still qualified if he could anywhere have found
an owner unacquainted with his story to adorn another quarterdeck and
lose another ship

She has American lines anyway said the astute Scots engineer of the
ginmill its my belief shes a yacht

Thats it said the old salt a yacht look at her davits and the
boat over the stern

A yacht in your eye said a Glasgow voice Look at her red ensign A
yacht not much she isnt

You can close the store anyway Tom observed a gentlemanly German
Bon jour mon Prince he added as a dark intelligent native cantered
by on a neat chestnut Vous allez boire un verre de biere

But Prince Stanilas Moanatini the only reasonably busy human creature
on the island was riding hotspur to view this mornings landslip on
the mountain road the sun already visibly declined night was imminent
and if he would avoid the perils of darkness and precipice and the
fear of the dead the haunters of the jungle he must for once decline
a hospitable invitation Even had he been minded to alight it presently
appeared there would be difficulty as to the refreshment offered

Beer cried the Glasgow voice No such a thing I tell you theres
only eight bottles in the club Heres the first time Ive seen British
colours in this port and the man that sails under them has got to drink
that beer

The proposal struck the public mind as fair though far from cheering
for some time back indeed the very name of beer had been a sound of
sorrow in the club and the evenings had passed in dolorous computation

Here is Havens said one as if welcoming a fresh topic What do you
think of her Havens

I dont think replied Havens a tall bland coollooking leisurely
Englishman attired in spotless duck and deliberately dealing with a
cigarette I may say I know Shes consigned to me from Auckland by
Donald  Edenborough I am on my way aboard

What ship is she asked the ancient mariner

Havent an idea returned Havens Some tramp they have chartered

With that he placidly resumed his walk and was soon seated in the
sternsheets of a whaleboat manned by uproarious Kanakas himself
daintily perched out of the way of the least maculation giving his
commands in an unobtrusive dinnertable tone of voice and sweeping
neatly enough alongside the schooner

A weatherbeaten captain received him at the gangway

You are consigned to us I think said he I am Mr Havens

That is right sir replied the captain shaking hands You will find
the owner Mr Dodd below Mind the fresh paint on the house

Havens stepped along the alleyway and descended the ladder into the
main cabin

Mr Dodd I believe said he addressing a smallish bearded
gentleman who sat writing at the table Why he cried it isnt
Loudon Dodd

Myself my dear fellow replied Mr Dodd springing to his feet with
companionable alacrity I had a halfhope it might be you when I found
your name on the papers Well theres no change in you still the same
placid freshlooking Britisher

I cant return the compliment for you seem to have become a Britisher
yourself said Havens

I promise you I am quite unchanged returned Dodd The red
tablecloth at the top of the stick is not my flag its my partners
He is not dead but sleepeth There he is he added pointing to a bust
which formed one of the numerous unexpected ornaments of that unusual
cabin

Havens politely studied it A fine bust said he and a very
nicelooking fellow

Yes hes a good fellow said Dodd He runs me now Its all his
money

He doesnt seem to be particularly short of it added the other
peering with growing wonder round the cabin

His money my taste said Dodd The blackwalnut bookshelves are Old
English the books all minemostly Renaissance French You should see
how the beachcombers wilt away when they go round them looking for a
change of Seaside Library novels The mirrors are genuine Venice thats
a good piece in the corner The daubs are mineand his the mudding
mine

Mudding What is that asked Havens

These bronzes replied Dodd I began life as a sculptor

Yes I remember something about that said the other I think too
you said you were interested in Californian real estate

Surely I never went so far as that said Dodd Interested I guess
not Involved perhaps I was born an artist I never took an interest
in anything but art If I were to pile up this old schooner tomorrow
he added I declare I believe I would try the thing again

Insured inquired Havens

Yes responded Dodd Theres some fool in Frisco who insures us and
comes down like a wolf on the fold on the profits but well get even
with him some day

Well I suppose its all right about the cargo said Havens

O I suppose so replied Dodd Shall we go into the papers

Well have all tomorrow you know said Havens and theyll be
rather expecting you at the club Cest lheure de labsinthe Of
course Loudon youll dine with me later on

Mr Dodd signified his acquiescence drew on his white coat not without
a trifling difficulty for he was a man of middle age and welltodo
arranged his beard and moustaches at one of the Venetian mirrors and
taking a broad felt hat led the way through the traderoom into the
ships waist

The stern boat was waiting alongsidea boat of an elegant model with
cushions and polished hardwood fittings

You steer observed Loudon You know the best place to land

I never like to steer another mans boat replied Havens

Call it my partners and cry quits returned Loudon getting
nonchalantly down the side

Havens followed and took the yoke lines without further protest I am
sure I dont know how you make this pay he said To begin with
she is too big for the trade to my taste and then you carry so much
style

I dont know that she does pay returned Loudon I never pretend to
be a business man My partner appears happy and the money is all his
as I told youI only bring the want of business habits

You rather like the berth I suppose suggested Havens

Yes said Loudon it seems odd but I rather do

While they were yet on board the sun had dipped the sunset gun a
rifle cracked from the warschooner and the colours had been
handed down Dusk was deepening as they came ashore and the Cercle
Internationale as the club is officially and significantly named began
to shine from under its low verandas with the light of many lamps The
good hours of the twentyfour drew on the hateful poisonous dayfly
of Nukahiva was beginning to desist from its activity the landbreeze
came in refreshing draughts and the club men gathered together for the
hour of absinthe To the commandant himself to the man whom he was then
contending with at billiardsa trader from the next island honorary
member of the club and once carpenters mate on board a Yankee
warshipto the doctor of the port to the Brigadier of Gendarmerie to
the opium farmer and to all the white men whom the tide of commerce
or the chances of shipwreck and desertion had stranded on the beach of
Taiohae Mr Loudon Dodd was formally presented by all since he was
a man of pleasing exterior smooth ways and an unexceptionable flow of
talk whether in French or English he was excellently well received
and presently with one of the last eight bottles of beer on a table
at his elbow found himself the rather silent centrepiece of a voluble
group on the verandah

Talk in the South Seas is all upon one pattern it is a wide ocean
indeed but a narrow world you shall never talk long and not hear the
name of Bully Hayes a naval hero whose exploits and deserved extinction
left Europe cold commerce will be touched on copra shell perhaps
cotton or fungus but in a faraway dilettante fashion as by men
not deeply interested through all the names of schooners and their
captains will keep coming and going thick as mayflies and news
of the last shipwreck will be placidly exchanged and debated To a
stranger this conversation will at first seem scarcely brilliant but
he will soon catch the tone and by the time he shall have moved a
year or so in the island world and come across a good number of the
schooners so that every captains name calls up a figure in pyjamas or
white duck and becomes used to a certain laxity of moral tone which
prevails as in memory of Mr Hayes on smuggling shipscuttling
barratry piracy the labour trade and other kindred fields of human
activity he will find Polynesia no less amusing and no less instructive
than Pall Mall or Paris

Mr Loudon Dodd though he was new to the group of the Marquesas was
already an old salted trader he knew the ships and the captains he
had assisted in other islands at the first steps of some career of
which he now heard the culmination or vice versa he had brought
with him from further south the end of some story which had begun in
Taiohae Among other matter of interest like other arrivals in
the South Seas he had a wreck to announce The John T Richards it
appeared had met the fate of other island schooners

Dickinson piled her up on Palmerston Island Dodd announced

Who were the owners inquired one of the club men

O the usual parties returned LoudonCapsicum  Co

A smile and a glance of intelligence went round the group and perhaps
Loudon gave voice to the general sentiment by remarking Talk of good
business I know nothing better than a schooner a competent captain
and a sound reliable reef

Good business Theres no such a thing said the Glasgow man Nobody
makes anything but the missionariesdash it

I dont know said another Theres a good deal in opium

Its a good job to strike a tabooed pearlisland say about the fourth
year remarked a third skim the whole lagoon on the sly and up stick
and away before the French get wind of you

A pig nokket of cold is good observed a German

Theres something in wrecks too said Havens Look at that man in
Honolulu and the ship that went ashore on Waikiki Reef it was blowing
a kona hard and she began to break up as soon as she touched Lloyds
agent had her sold inside an hour and before dark when she went to
pieces in earnest the man that bought her had feathered his nest Three
more hours of daylight and he might have retired from business As it
was he built a house on Beretania Street and called it for the ship

Yes theres something in wrecks sometimes said the Glasgow voice
but not often

As a general rule theres deuced little in anything said Havens

Well I believe thats a Christian fact cried the other What I want
is a secret get hold of a rich man by the right place and make him
squeal

I suppose you know its not thought to be the ticket returned Havens

I dont care for that its good enough for me cried the man from
Glasgow stoutly The only devil of it is a fellow can never find a
secret in a place like the South Seas only in London and Paris

MGibbons been reading some dimenovel I suppose said one club man

Hes been reading _Aurora Floyd_ remarked another

And what if I have cried MGibbon Its all true Look at
the newspapers Its just your confounded ignorance that sets you
snickering I tell you its as much a trade as underwriting and a
dashed sight more honest

The sudden acrimony of these remarks called Loudon who was a man of
peace from his reserve Its rather singular said he but I seem to
have practised about all these means of livelihood

Tit you effer vind a nokket inquired the inarticulate German
eagerly

No I have been most kinds of fool in my time returned Loudon but
not the golddigging variety Every man has a sane spot somewhere

Well then suggested some one did you ever smuggle opium

Yes I did said Loudon

Was there money in that

All the way responded Loudon

And perhaps you bought a wreck asked another

Yes sir said Loudon

How did that pan out pursued the questioner

Well mine was a peculiar kind of wreck replied Loudon I dont
know on the whole that I can recommend that branch of industry

Did she break up asked some one

I guess it was rather I that broke down says Loudon Head not big
enough

Ever try the blackmail inquired Havens

Simple as you see me sitting here responded Dodd

Good business

Well Im not a lucky man you see returned the stranger It ought
to have been good

You had a secret asked the Glasgow man

As big as the State of Texas

And the other man was rich

He wasnt exactly Jay Gould but I guess he could buy these islands if
he wanted

Why what was wrong then Couldnt you get hands on him

It took time but I had him cornered at last and then

What then

The speculation turned bottom up I became the mans bosom friend

The deuce you did

He couldnt have been particular you mean asked Dodd pleasantly
Well no hes a man of rather large sympathies

If youre done talking nonsense Loudon said Havens lets be
getting to my place for dinner

Outside the night was full of the roaring of the surf Scattered lights
glowed in the green thicket Native women came by twos and threes out of
the darkness smiled and ogled the two whites perhaps wooed them with
a strain of laughter and went by again bequeathing to the air a
heady perfume of palmoil and frangipani blossom From the club to Mr
Havenss residence was but a step or two and to any dweller in Europe
they must have seemed steps in fairyland If such an one could but have
followed our two friends into the wideverandahed house sat down
with them in the cool trellised room where the wine shone on the
lamplighted tablecloth tasted of their exotic foodthe raw fish the
breadfruit the cooked bananas the roast pig served with the inimitable
miti and that king of delicacies palmtree salad seen and heard by
fits and starts now peering round the corner of the door now railing
within against invisible assistants a certain comely young native lady
in a sacque who seemed too modest to be a member of the family and too
imperious to be less and then if such an one were whisked again through
space to Upper Tooting or wherever else he honored the domestic gods
I have had a dream I think he would say as he sat up rubbing his
eyes in the familiar chimneycorner chair I have had a dream of a
place and I declare I believe it must be heaven But to Dodd and his
entertainer all this amenity of the tropic night and all these dainties
of the island table were grown things of custom and they fell to meat
like men who were hungry and drifted into idle talk like men who were a
trifle bored

The scene in the club was referred to

I never heard you talk so much nonsense Loudon said the host

Well it seemed to me there was sulphur in the air so I talked for
talking returned the other But it was none of it nonsense

Do you mean to say it was true cried Havensthat about the opium
and the wreck and the blackmailing and the man who became your friend

Every last word of it said Loudon

You seem to have been seeing life returned the other

Yes its a queer yarn said his friend if you think you would like
Ill tell it you

Here follows the yarn of Loudon Dodd not as he told it to his friend
but as he subsequently wrote it




THE YARN




CHAPTER I A SOUND COMMERCIAL EDUCATION


The beginning of this yarn is my poor fathers character There
never was a better man nor a handsomer nor in my view a more
unhappyunhappy in his business in his pleasures in his place of
residence and I am sorry to say it in his son He had begun life as a
landsurveyor soon became interested in real estate branched off into
many other speculations and had the name of one of the smartest men in
the State of Muskegon Dodd has a big head people used to say but I
was never so sure of his capacity His luck at least was beyond doubt
for long his assiduity always He fought in that daily battle of
moneygrubbing with a kind of sadeyed loyalty like a martyrs rose
early ate fast came home dispirited and overweary even from success
grudged himself all pleasure if his nature was capable of taking any
which I sometimes wondered and laid out upon some deal in wheat or
corner in aluminium the essence of which was little better than highway
robbery treasures of conscientiousness and selfdenial

Unluckily I never cared a cent for anything but art and never shall
My idea of mans chief end was to enrich the world with things of
beauty and have a fairly good time myself while doing so I do not
think I mentioned that second part which is the only one I have managed
to carry out but my father must have suspected the suppression for he
branded the whole affair as selfindulgence

Well I remember crying once and what is your life You are only
trying to get money and to get it from other people at that

He sighed bitterly which was very much his habit and shook his poor
head at me Ah Loudon Loudon said he you boys think yourselves
very smart But struggle as you please a man has to work in this
world He must be an honest man or a thief Loudon

You can see for yourself how vain it was to argue with my father
The despair that seized upon me after such an interview was besides
embittered by remorse for I was at times petulant but he invariably
gentle and I was fighting after all for my own liberty and pleasure
he singly for what he thought to be my good And all the time he never
despaired There is good stuff in you Loudon he would say there
is the right stuff in you Blood will tell and you will come right in
time I am not afraid my boy will ever disgrace me I am only vexed he
should sometimes talk nonsense And then he would pat my shoulder or
my hand with a kind of motherly way he had very affecting in a man so
strong and beautiful

As soon as I had graduated from the high school he packed me off to the
Muskegon Commercial Academy You are a foreigner and you will have a
difficulty in accepting the reality of this seat of education I assure
you before I begin that I am wholly serious The place really existed
possibly exists today we were proud of it in the State as something
exceptionally nineteenth century and civilized and my father when he
saw me to the cars no doubt considered he was putting me in a straight
line for the Presidency and the New Jerusalem

Loudon said he I am now giving you a chance that Julius Caesar
could not have given to his sona chance to see life as it is before
your own turn comes to start in earnest Avoid rash speculation try
to behave like a gentleman and if you will take my advice confine
yourself to a safe conservative business in railroads Breadstuffs are
tempting but very dangerous I would not try breadstuffs at your time
of life but you may feel your way a little in other commodities Take
a pride to keep your books posted and never throw good money after bad
There my dear boy kiss me goodby and never forget that you are an
only chick and that your dad watches your career with fond suspense

The commercial college was a fine roomy establishment pleasantly
situate among woods The air was healthy the food excellent the
premium high Electric wires connected it to use the words of the
prospectus with the various world centres The readingroom was well
supplied with commercial organs The talk was that of Wall Street and
the pupils from fifty to a hundred lads were principally engaged
in rooking or trying to rook one another for nominal sums in what was
called college paper We had class hours indeed in the morning when
we studied German French bookkeeping and the like goodly matters
but the bulk of our day and the gist of the education centred in the
exchange where we were taught to gamble in produce and securities
Since not one of the participants possessed a bushel of wheat or a
dollars worth of stock legitimate business was of course impossible
from the beginning It was colddrawn gambling without colour or
disguise Just that which is the impediment and destruction of all
genuine commercial enterprise just that we were taught with every
luxury of stage effect Our simulacrum of a market was ruled by the real
markets outside so that we might experience the course and vicissitude
of prices We must keep books and our ledgers were overhauled at
the months end by the principal or his assistants To add a spice
of verisimilitude college paper like poker chips had an actual
marketable value It was bought for each pupil by anxious parents and
guardians at the rate of one cent for the dollar The same pupil when
his education was complete resold at the same figure so much as was
left him to the college and even in the midst of his curriculum a
successful operator would sometimes realize a proportion of his holding
and stand a supper on the sly in the neighbouring hamlet In short
if there was ever a worse education it must have been in that academy
where Oliver met Charlie Bates

When I was first guided into the exchange to have my desk pointed out
by one of the assistant teachers I was overwhelmed by the clamour and
confusion Certain blackboards at the other end of the building were
covered with figures continually replaced As each new set appeared the
pupils swayed to and fro and roared out aloud with a formidable and
to me quite meaningless vociferation leaping at the same time upon
the desks and benches signalling with arms and heads and scribbling
briskly in notebooks I thought I had never beheld a scene more
disagreeable and when I considered that the whole traffic was illusory
and all the money then upon the market would scarce have sufficed to
buy a pair of skates I was at first astonished although not for long
Indeed I had no sooner called to mind how grownup men and women of
considerable estate will lose their temper about halfpenny points than
making an immediate allowance for my fellowstudents I transferred
the whole of my astonishment to the assistant teacher whopoor
gentlemanhad quite forgot to show me to my desk and stood in the
midst of this hurlyburly absorbed and seemingly transported

Look look he shouted in my ear a falling market The bears have
had it all their own way since yesterday

It cant matter I replied making him hear with difficulty for I was
unused to speak in such a babel since it is all fun

True said he and you must always bear in mind that the real profit
is in the bookkeeping I trust Dodd to be able to congratulate
you upon your books You are to start in with ten thousand dollars of
college paper a very liberal figure which should see you through the
whole curriculum if you keep to a safe conservative business Why
whats that he broke off once more attracted by the changing figures
on the board Seven four three Dodd you are in luck this is the
most spirited rally we have had this term And to think that the same
scene is now transpiring in New York Chicago St Louis and rival
business centres For two cents I would try a flutter with the
boys myself he cried rubbing his hands only its against the
regulations

What would you do sir I asked

Do he cried with glittering eyes Buy for all I was worth

Would that be a safe conservative business I inquired as innocent
as a lamb

He looked daggers at me See that sandyhaired man in glasses he
asked as if to change the subject Thats Billson our most prominent
undergraduate We build confidently on Billsons future You could not
do better Dodd than follow Billson

Presently after in the midst of a still growing tumult the figures
coming and going more busily than ever on the board and the hall
resounding like Pandemonium with the howls of operators the assistant
teacher left me to my own resources at my desk The next boy was posting
up his ledger figuring his mornings loss as I discovered later on
and from this ungenial task he was readily diverted by the sight of a
new face

Say Freshman he said whats your name What Son of Big Head Dodd
Whats your figure Ten thousand O youre away up What a softheaded
clam you must be to touch your books

I asked him what else I could do since the books were to be examined
once a month

Why you galoot you get a clerk cries he One of our dead
beatsthats all theyre here for If youre a successful operator you
need never do a stroke of work in this old college

The noise had now become deafening and my new friend telling me that
some one had certainly gone down that he must know the news and
that he would bring me a clerk when he returned buttoned his coat and
plunged into the tossing throng It proved that he was right some one
had gone down a prince had fallen in Israel the corner in lard had
proved fatal to the mighty and the clerk who was brought back to keep
my books spare me all work and get all my share of the education at
a thousand dollars a month college paper ten dollars United States
currency was no other than the prominent Billson whom I could do no
better than follow The poor lad was very unhappy Its the only good
thing I have to say for Muskegon Commercial College that we were all
even the small fry deeply mortified to be posted as defaulters and the
collapse of a merchant prince like Billson who had ridden pretty high
in his days of prosperity was of course particularly hard to bear
But the spirit of makebelieve conquered even the bitterness of recent
shame and my clerk took his orders and fell to his new duties with
decorum and civility

Such were my first impressions in this absurd place of education and
to be frank they were far from disagreeable As long as I was rich my
evenings and afternoons would be my own the clerk must keep my books
the clerk could do the jostling and bawling in the exchange and I could
turn my mind to landscapepainting and Balzacs novels which were then
my two preoccupations To remain rich then became my problem or in
other words to do a safe conservative line of business I am looking
for that line still and I believe the nearest thing to it in this
imperfect world is the sort of speculation sometimes insidiously
proposed to childhood in the formula Heads I win tails you lose
Mindful of my fathers parting words I turned my attention timidly to
railroads and for a month or so maintained a position of inglorious
security dealing for small amounts in the most inert stocks and
bearing as best I could the scorn of my hired clerk One day I
had ventured a little further by way of experiment and in the sure
expectation they would continue to go down sold several thousand
dollars of PanHandle Preference I think it was I had no sooner
made this venture than some fools in New York began to bull the market
PanHandles rose like a balloon and in the inside of half an hour I saw
my position compromised Blood will tell as my father said and I stuck
to it gallantly all afternoon I continued selling that infernal
stock all afternoon it continued skying I suppose I had come a frail
cockleshell athwart the hawse of Jay Gould and indeed I think I
remember that this vagary in the market proved subsequently to be the
first move in a considerable deal That evening at least the name of
H Loudon Dodd held the first rank in our collegiate gazette and I and
Billson once more thrown upon the world were competing for the same
clerkship The present object takes the present eye My disaster
for the moment was the more conspicuous and it was I that got the
situation So you see even in Muskegon Commercial College there were
lessons to be learned

For my own part I cared very little whether I lost or won at a game so
random so complex and so dull but it was sorry news to write to my
poor father and I employed all the resources of my eloquence I told
him what was the truth that the successful boys had none of the
education so that if he wished me to learn he should rejoice at my
misfortune I went on not very consistently to beg him to set me up
again when I would solemnly promise to do a safe business in reliable
railroads Lastly becoming somewhat carried away I assured him I was
totally unfit for business and implored him to take me away from this
abominable place and let me go to Paris to study art He answered
briefly gently and sadly telling me the vacation was near at hand
when we could talk things over

When the time came he met me at the depot and I was shocked to see
him looking older He seemed to have no thought but to console me
and restore what he supposed I had lost my courage I must not be
downhearted many of the best men had made a failure in the beginning
I told him I had no head for business and his kind face darkened You
must not say that Loudon he replied I will never believe my son to
be a coward

But I dont like it I pleaded It hasnt got any interest for me
and art has I know I could do more in art and I reminded him that
a successful painter gains large sums that a picture of Meissoniers
would sell for many thousand dollars

And do you think Loudon he replied that a man who can paint a
thousand dollar picture has not grit enough to keep his end up in
the stock market No sir this Mason of whom you speak or our
own American Bierstadtif you were to put them down in a wheat pit
tomorrow they would show their mettle Come Loudon my dear heaven
knows I have no thought but your own good and I will offer you a
bargain I start you again next term with ten thousand dollars show
yourself a man and double it and then if you still wish to go to
Paris which I know you wont Ill let you go But to let you run away
as if you were whipped is what I am too proud to do

My heart leaped at this proposal and then sank again It seemed easier
to paint a Meissonier on the spot than to win ten thousand dollars
on that mimic stock exchange Nor could I help reflecting on the
singularity of such a test for a mans capacity to be a painter I
ventured even to comment on this

He sighed deeply You forget my dear said he I am a judge of
the one and not of the other You might have the genius of Bierstadt
himself and I would be none the wiser

And then I continued its scarcely fair The other boys are helped
by their people who telegraph and give them pointers Theres Jim
Costello who never budges without a word from his father in New York
And then dont you see if anybody is to win somebody must lose

Ill keep you posted cried my father with unusual animation I did
not know it was allowed Ill wire you in the office cipher and well
make it a kind of partnership business LoudonDodd  Son eh and
he patted my shoulder and repeated Dodd  Son Dodd  Son with the
kindliest amusement

If my father was to give me pointers and the commercial college was to
be a steppingstone to Paris I could look my future in the face The
old boy too was so pleased at the idea of our association in this
foolery that he immediately plucked up spirit Thus it befell that those
who had met at the depot like a pair of mutes sat down to table with
holiday faces

And now I have to introduce a new character that never said a word nor
wagged a finger and yet shaped my whole subsequent career You have
crossed the States so that in all likelihood you have seen the head
of it parcelgilt and curiously fluted rising among trees from a wide
plain for this new character was no other than the State capitol of
Muskegon then first projected My father had embraced the idea with a
mixture of patriotism and commercial greed both perfectly genuine He
was of all the committees he had subscribed a great deal of money and
he was making arrangements to have a finger in most of the contracts
Competitive plans had been sent in at the time of my return from
college my father was deep in their consideration and as the idea
entirely occupied his mind the first evening did not pass away before
he had called me into council Here was a subject at last into which I
could throw myself with pleasurable zeal Architecture was new to me
indeed but it was at least an art and for all the arts I had a taste
naturally classical and that capacity to take delighted pains which some
famous idiot has supposed to be synonymous with genius I threw myself
headlong into my fathers work acquainted myself with all the plans
their merits and defects read besides in special books made myself
a master of the theory of strains studied the current prices
of materials and in one word devilled the whole business so
thoroughly that when the plans came up for consideration Big Head Dodd
was supposed to have earned fresh laurels His arguments carried the
day his choice was approved by the committee and I had the anonymous
satisfaction to know that arguments and choice were wholly mine In the
recasting of the plan which followed my part was even larger for I
designed and cast with my own hand a hotair grating for the offices
which had the luck or merit to be accepted The energy and aptitude
which I displayed throughout delighted and surprised my father and I
believe although I say it whose tongue should be tied that they alone
prevented Muskegon capitol from being the eyesore of my native State

Altogether I was in a cheery frame of mind when I returned to the
commercial college and my earlier operations were crowned with a full
measure of success My father wrote and wired to me continually You
are to exercise your own judgment Loudon he would say All that I do
is to give you the figures but whatever operation you take up must be
upon your own responsibility and whatever you earn will be entirely
due to your own dash and forethought For all that it was always clear
what he intended me to do and I was always careful to do it Inside
of a month I was at the head of seventeen or eighteen thousand dollars
college paper And here I fell a victim to one of the vices of the
system The paper I have already explained had a real value of one
per cent and cost and could be sold for currency Unsuccessful
speculators were thus always selling clothes books banjos and
sleevelinks in order to pay their differences the successful on the
other hand were often tempted to realise and enjoy some return upon
their profits Now I wanted thirty dollars worth of artisttruck for
I was always sketching in the woods my allowance was for the time
exhausted I had begun to regard the exchange with my fathers help
as a place where money was to be got for stooping and in an evil hour
I realised three thousand dollars of the college paper and bought my
easel

It was a Wednesday morning when the things arrived and set me in
the seventh heaven of satisfaction My father for I can scarcely say
myself was trying at this time a straddle in wheat between Chicago
and New York the operation so called is as you know one of the
most tempting and least safe upon the chessboard of finance On the
Thursday luck began to turn against my fathers calculations and by
the Friday evening I was posted on the boards as a defaulter for the
second time Here was a rude blow my father would have taken it ill
enough in any case for however much a man may resent the incapacity of
an only son he will feel his own more sensibly But it chanced that in
our bitter cup of failure there was one ingredient that might truly be
called poisonous He had been keeping the run of my position he missed
the three thousand dollars paper and in his view I had stolen thirty
dollars currency It was an extreme view perhaps but in some senses
it was just and my father although to my judgment quite reckless of
honesty in the essence of his operations was the soul of honour as to
their details I had one grieved letter from him dignified and tender
and during the rest of that wretched term working as a clerk selling
my clothes and sketches to make futile speculations my dream of Paris
quite vanished I was cheered by no word of kindness and helped by no
hint of counsel from my father

All the time he was no doubt thinking of little else but his son and
what to do with him I believe he had been really appalled by what he
regarded as my laxity of principle and began to think it might be
well to preserve me from temptation the architect of the capitol had
besides spoken obligingly of my design and while he was thus hanging
between two minds Fortune suddenly stepped in and Muskegon State
capitol reversed my destiny

Loudon said my father as he met me at the depot with a smiling
countenance if you were to go to Paris how long would it take you to
become an experienced sculptor

How do you mean father I cried Experienced

A man that could be entrusted with the highest styles he answered
the nude for instance and the patriotic and emblematical styles

It might take three years I replied

You think Paris necessary he asked There are great advantages
in our own country and that man Prodgers appears to be a very clever
sculptor though I suppose he stands too high to go around giving
lessons

Paris is the only place I assured him

Well I think myself it will sound better he admitted A Young Man
a Native of this State Son of a Leading Citizen Studies Prosecuted
under the Most Experienced Masters in Paris he added relishingly

But my dear dad what is it all about I interrupted I never even
dreamed of being a sculptor

Well here it is said he I took up the statuary contract on our new
capitol I took it up at first as a deal and then it occurred to me it
would be better to keep it in the family It meets your idea theres
considerable money in the thing and its patriotic So if you say the
word you shall go to Paris and come back in three years to decorate
the capitol of your native State Its a big chance for you Loudon and
Ill tell you whatevery dollar you earn Ill put another alongside of
it But the sooner you go and the harder you work the better for
if the first halfdozen statues arent in a line with public taste in
Muskegon there will be trouble




CHAPTER II ROUSSILLON WINE


My mothers family was Scotch and it was judged fitting I should pay a
visit on my way Parisward to my Uncle Adam Loudon a wealthy retired
grocer of Edinburgh He was very stiff and very ironical he fed me
well lodged me sumptuously and seemed to take it out of me all the
time cent per cent in secret entertainment which caused his spectacles
to glitter and his mouth to twitch The ground of this illsuppressed
mirth as well as I could make out was simply the fact that I was an
American Well he would say drawing out the word to infinity and
I suppose now in your country things will be so and so And the whole
group of my cousins would titter joyously Repeated receptions of
this sort must be at the root I suppose of what they call the Great
American Jest and I know I was myself goaded into saying that my
friends went naked in the summer months and that the Second Methodist
Episcopal Church in Muskegon was decorated with scalps I cannot say
that these flights had any great success they seemed to awaken little
more surprise than the fact that my father was a Republican or that I
had been taught in school to spell COLOUR without the U If I had
told them what was after all the truth that my father had paid a
considerable annual sum to have me brought up in a gambling hell the
tittering and grinning of this dreadful family might perhaps have been
excused

I cannot deny but I was sometimes tempted to knock my Uncle Adam down
and indeed I believe it must have come to a rupture at last if they had
not given a dinner party at which I was the lion On this occasion I
learned to my surprise and relief that the incivility to which I had
been subjected was a matter for the family circle and might be regarded
almost in the light of an endearment To strangers I was presented with
consideration and the account given of my American brotherinlaw
poor Janies man James K Dodd the wellknown millionnaire of
Muskegon was calculated to enlarge the heart of a proud son

An aged assistant of my grandfathers a pleasant humble creature with
a taste for whiskey was at first deputed to be my guide about the city
With this harmless but hardly aristocratic companion I went to Arthurs
Seat and the Calton Hill heard the band play in the Princes Street
Gardens inspected the regalia and the blood of Rizzio and fell in love
with the great castle on its cliff the innumerable spires of churches
the stately buildings the broad prospects and those narrow and crowded
lanes of the old town where my ancestors had lived and died in the days
before Columbus

But there was another curiosity that interested me more deeplymy
grandfather Alexander Loudon In his time the old gentleman had been a
working mason and had risen from the ranks more I think by shrewdness
than by merit In his appearance speech and manners he bore broad
marks of his origin which were gall and wormwood to my Uncle Adam
His nails in spite of anxious supervision were often in conspicuous
mourning his clothes hung about him in bags and wrinkles like a
ploughmans Sunday coat his accent was rude broad and dragging take
him at his best and even when he could be induced to hold his tongue
his mere presence in a corner of the drawingroom with his openair
wrinkles his scanty hair his battered hands and the cheerful
craftiness of his expression advertised the whole gang of us for a
selfmade family My aunt might mince and my cousins bridle but there
was no getting over the solid physical fact of the stonemason in the
chimneycorner

That is one advantage of being an American it never occurred to me to
be ashamed of my grandfather and the old gentleman was quick to mark
the difference He held my mother in tender memory perhaps because
he was in the habit of daily contrasting her with Uncle Adam whom he
detested to the point of frenzy and he set down to inheritance from
his favourite my own becoming treatment of himself On our walks abroad
which soon became daily he would sometimes after duly warning me
to keep the matter dark from Aadam skulk into some old familiar
pothouse and there if he had the luck to encounter any of his veteran
cronies he would present me to the company with manifest pride casting
at the same time a covert slur on the rest of his descendants This is
my Jeannies yin he would say Hes a fine fallow him The purpose
of our excursions was not to seek antiquities or to enjoy famous
prospects but to visit one after another a series of doleful suburbs
for which it was the old gentlemans chief claim to renown that he had
been the sole contractor and too often the architect besides I have
rarely seen a more shocking exhibition the bricks seemed to be blushing
in the walls and the slates on the roof to have turned pale with shame
but I was careful not to communicate these impressions to the aged
artificer at my side and when he would direct my attention to some
fresh monstrosityperhaps with the comment Theres an idee of mines
its cheap and tasty and had a graand run the idee was soon stole and
theres whole deestricts near Glesgie with the goathic adeetion and
that plunthI would civilly make haste to admire and what I found
particularly delighted him to inquire into the cost of each adornment
It will be conceived that Muskegon capitol was a frequent and a welcome
ground of talk I drew him all the plans from memory and he with the
aid of a narrow volume full of figures and tables which answered
I believe to the name of Molesworth and was his constant pocket
companion would draw up rough estimates and make imaginary offers on
the various contracts Our Muskegon builders he pronounced a pack of
cormorants and the congenial subject together with my knowledge of
architectural terms the theory of strains and the prices of materials
in the States formed a strong bond of union between what might have
been otherwise an illassorted pair and led my grandfather to pronounce
me with emphasis a real intalligent kind of a cheild Thus a second
time as you will presently see the capitol of my native State had
influentially affected the current of my life

I left Edinburgh however with not the least idea that I had done a
stroke of excellent business for myself and singly delighted to escape
out of a somewhat dreary house and plunge instead into the rainbow city
of Paris Every man has his own romance mine clustered exclusively
about the practice of the arts the life of Latin Quarter students and
the world of Paris as depicted by that grimy wizard the author of the
_Comedie Humaine_ I was not disappointedI could not have been for
I did not see the facts I brought them with me readymade Z Marcas
lived next door to me in my ungainly illsmelling hotel of the Rue
Racine I dined at my villainous restaurant with Lousteau and with
Rastignac if a curricle nearly ran me down at a streetcrossing Maxime
de Trailles would be the driver I dined I say at a poor restaurant
and lived in a poor hotel and this was not from need but sentiment
My father gave me a profuse allowance and I might have lived had I
chosen in the Quartier de lEtoile and driven to my studies daily
Had I done so the glamour must have fled I should still have been
but Loudon Dodd whereas now I was a Latin Quarter student Murgers
successor living in flesh and blood the life of one of those romances
I had loved to read to reread and to dream over among the woods of
Muskegon

At this time we were all a little Murgermad in the Latin Quarter
The play of the _Vie de Boheme_ a dreary snivelling piece had been
produced at the Odeon had run an unconscionable timefor Paris and
revived the freshness of the legend The same business you may say
or there and thereabout was being privately enacted in consequence in
every garret of the neighbourhood and a good third of the students
were consciously impersonating Rodolphe or Schaunard to their own
incommunicable satisfaction Some of us went far and some farther I
always looked with awful envy for instance on a certain countryman of
my own who had a studio in the Rue Monsieur le Prince wore boots and
long hair in a net and could be seen tramping off in this guise to
the worst eatinghouse of the quarter followed by a Corsican model his
mistress in the conspicuous costume of her race and calling It takes
some greatness of soul to carry even folly to such heights as these and
for my own part I had to content myself by pretending very arduously
to be poor by wearing a smokingcap on the streets and by pursuing
through a series of misadventures that extinct mammal the grisette
The most grievous part was the eating and the drinking I was born with
a dainty tooth and a palate for wine and only a genuine devotion to
romance could have supported me under the catcivets that I had to
swallow and the red ink of Bercy I must wash them down withal Every
now and again after a hard day at the studio where I was steadily and
far from unsuccessfully industrious a wave of distaste would overbear
me I would slink away from my haunts and companions indemnify myself
for weeks of selfdenial with fine wines and dainty dishes seated
perhaps on a terrace perhaps in an arbour in a garden with a volume
of one of my favourite authors propped open in front of me and now
consulted awhile and now forgottenso remain relishing my situation
till night fell and the lights of the city kindled and thence stroll
homeward by the riverside under the moon or stars in a heaven of
poetry and digestion

One such indulgence led me in the course of my second year into an
adventure which I must relate indeed it is the very point I have been
aiming for since that was what brought me in acquaintance with Jim
Pinkerton I sat down alone to dinner one October day when the rusty
leaves were falling and scuttling on the boulevard and the minds of
impressionable men inclined in about an equal degree towards sadness
and conviviality The restaurant was no great place but boasted a
considerable cellar and a long printed list of vintages This I was
perusing with the double zest of a man who is fond of wine and a lover
of beautiful names when my eye fell near the end of the card on that
not very famous or familiar brand Roussillon I remembered it was a
wine I had never tasted ordered a bottle found it excellent and when
I had discussed the contents called according to my habit for a final
pint It appears they did not keep Roussillon in halfbottles All
right said I Another bottle The tables at this eatinghouse are
close together and the next thing I can remember I was in somewhat
loud conversation with my nearest neighbours From these I must have
gradually extended my attentions for I have a clear recollection of
gazing about a room in which every chair was half turned round and every
face turned smilingly to mine I can even remember what I was saying at
the moment but after twenty years the embers of shame are still alive
and I prefer to give your imagination the cue by simply mentioning that
my muse was the patriotic It had been my design to adjourn for coffee
in the company of some of these new friends but I was no sooner on
the sidewalk than I found myself unaccountably alone The circumstance
scarce surprised me at the time much less now but I was somewhat
chagrined a little after to find I had walked into a kiosque I began to
wonder if I were any the worse for my last bottle and decided to steady
myself with coffee and brandy In the Cafe de la Source where I went
for this restorative the fountain was playing and what greatly
surprised me the mill and the various mechanical figures on the rockery
appeared to have been freshly repaired and performed the most enchanting
antics The cafe was extraordinarily hot and bright with every detail
of a conspicuous clearness from the faces of the guests to the type of
the newspapers on the tables and the whole apartment swang to and fro
like a hammock with an exhilarating motion For some while I was so
extremely pleased with these particulars that I thought I could never
be weary of beholding them then dropped of a sudden into a causeless
sadness and then with the same swiftness and spontaneity arrived at
the conclusion that I was drunk and had better get to bed

It was but a step or two to my hotel where I got my lighted candle from
the porter and mounted the four flights to my own room Although I could
not deny that I was drunk I was at the same time lucidly rational and
practical I had but one preoccupationto be up in time on the morrow
for my work and when I observed the clock on my chimneypiece to have
stopped I decided to go down stairs again and give directions to the
porter Leaving the candle burning and my door open to be a guide to me
on my return I set forth accordingly The house was quite dark but as
there were only the three doors on each landing it was impossible to
wander and I had nothing to do but descend the stairs until I saw the
glimmer of the porters night light I counted four flights no porter
It was possible of course that I had reckoned incorrectly so I went
down another and another and another still counting as I went until
I had reached the preposterous figure of nine flights It was now quite
clear that I had somehow passed the porters lodge without remarking
it indeed I was at the lowest figure five pairs of stairs below
the street and plunged in the very bowels of the earth That my hotel
should thus be founded upon catacombs was a discovery of considerable
interest and if I had not been in a frame of mind entirely
businesslike I might have continued to explore all night this
subterranean empire But I was bound I must be up betimes on the next
morning and for that end it was imperative that I should find the
porter I faced about accordingly and counting with painful care
remounted towards the level of the street Five six and seven flights
I climbed and still there was no porter I began to be weary of the
job and reflecting that I was now close to my own room decided I
should go to bed Eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen flights
I mounted and my open door seemed to be as wholly lost to me as the
porter and his floating dip I remembered that the house stood but
six stories at its highest point from which it appeared on the most
moderate computation I was now three stories higher than the roof My
original sense of amusement was succeeded by a not unnatural irritation
My room has just GOT to be here said I and I stepped towards the
door with outspread arms There was no door and no wall in place of
either there yawned before me a dark corridor in which I continued to
advance for some time without encountering the smallest opposition And
this in a house whose extreme area scantily contained three small rooms
a narrow landing and the stair The thing was manifestly nonsense
and you will scarcely be surprised to learn that I now began to lose
my temper At this juncture I perceived a filtering of light along
the floor stretched forth my hand which encountered the knob of a
doorhandle and without further ceremony entered a room A young lady
was within she was going to bed and her toilet was far advanced or
the other way about if you prefer

I hope you will pardon this intrusion said I but my room is No 12
and something has gone wrong with this blamed house

She looked at me a moment and then If you will step outside for a
moment I will take you there says she

Thus with perfect composure on both sides the matter was arranged
I waited a while outside her door Presently she rejoined me in a
dressinggown took my hand led me up another flight which made the
fourth above the level of the roof and shut me into my own room where
being quite weary after these contraordinary explorations I turned in
and slumbered like a child

I tell you the thing calmly as it appeared to me to pass but the next
day when I awoke and put memory in the witnessbox I could not conceal
from myself that the tale presented a good many improbable features
I had no mind for the studio after all and went instead to the
Luxembourg gardens there among the sparrows and the statues and the
falling leaves to cool and clear my head It is a garden I have always
loved You sit there in a public place of history and fiction Barras
and Fouche have looked from these windows Lousteau and de Banville one
as real as the other have rhymed upon these benches The city tramples
by without the railings to a lively measure and within and about you
trees rustle children and sparrows utter their small cries and the
statues look on forever Here then in a seat opposite the gallery
entrance I set to work on the events of the last night to disengage
if it were possible truth from fiction

The house by daylight had proved to be six stories high the same as
ever I could find with all my architectural experience no room in its
altitude for those interminable stairways no width between its walls
for that long corridor where I had tramped at night And there was yet
a greater difficulty I had read somewhere an aphorism that everything
may be false to itself save human nature A house might elongate or
enlarge itselfor seem to do so to a gentleman who had been dining
The ocean might dry up the rocks melt in the sun the stars fall from
heaven like autumn apples and there was nothing in these incidents
to boggle the philosopher But the case of the young lady stood upon a
different foundation Girls were not good enough or not good that way
or else they were too good I was ready to accept any of these views
all pointed to the same conclusion which I was thus already on the
point of reaching when a fresh argument occurred and instantly
confirmed it I could remember the exact words we had each said and I
had spoken and she had replied in English Plainly then the whole
affair was an illusion catacombs and stairs and charitable lady all
were equally the stuff of dreams

I had just come to this determination when there blew a flaw of wind
through the autumnal gardens the dead leaves showered down and a
flight of sparrows thick as a snowfall wheeled above my head with
sudden pipings This agreeable bustle was the affair of a moment but it
startled me from the abstraction into which I had fallen like a summons
I sat briskly up and as I did so my eyes rested on the figure of a
lady in a brown jacket and carrying a paintbox By her side walked a
fellow some years older than myself with an easel under his arm and
alike by their course and cargo I might judge they were bound for the
gallery where the lady was doubtless engaged upon some copying
You can imagine my surprise when I recognized in her the heroine of my
adventure To put the matter beyond question our eyes met and she
seeing herself remembered and recalling the trim in which I had
last beheld her looked swiftly on the ground with just a shadow of
confusion

I could not tell you today if she were plain or pretty but she had
behaved with so much good sense and I had cut so poor a figure in
her presence that I became instantly fired with the desire to display
myself in a more favorable light The young man besides was possibly her
brother brothers are apt to be hasty theirs being a part in which
it is possible at a comparatively early age to assume the dignity
of manhood and it occurred to me it might be wise to forestall all
possible complications by an apology

On this reasoning I drew near to the gallery door and had hardly got in
position before the young man came out Thus it was that I came face to
face with my third destiny for my career has been entirely shaped
by these three elementsmy father the capitol of Muskegon and my
friend Jim Pinkerton As for the young lady with whom my mind was at
the moment chiefly occupied I was never to hear more of her from that
day forward an excellent example of the Blind Mans Buff that we call
life




CHAPTER III TO INTRODUCE MR PINKERTON


The stranger I have said was some years older than myself a man of a
good stature a very lively face cordial agitated manners and a gray
eye as active as a fowls

May I have a word with you said I

My dear sir he replied I dont know what it can be about but you
may have a hundred if you like

You have just left the side of a young lady I continued towards
whom I was led very unintentionally into the appearance of an offence
To speak to herself would be only to renew her embarrassment and I
seize the occasion of making my apology and declaring my respect to
one of my own sex who is her friend and perhaps I added with a bow
her natural protector

You are a countryman of mine I know it he cried I am sure of it
by your delicacy to a lady You do her no more than justice I was
introduced to her the other night at tea in the apartment of some
people friends of mine and meeting her again this morning I could not
do less than carry her easel for her My dear sir what is your name

I was disappointed to find he had so little bond with my young lady
and but that it was I who had sought the acquaintance might have been
tempted to retreat At the same time something in the strangers eye
engaged me

My name said I is Loudon Dodd I am a student of sculpture here
from Muskegon

Of sculpture he cried as though that would have been his last
conjecture Mine is James Pinkerton I am delighted to have the
pleasure of your acquaintance

Pinkerton it was now my turn to exclaim Are you BrokenStool
Pinkerton

He admitted his identity with a laugh of boyish delight and indeed any
young man in the quarter might have been proud to own a sobriquet thus
gallantly acquired

In order to explain the name I must here digress into a chapter of
the history of manners in the nineteenth century very well worth
commemoration for its own sake In some of the studios at that date
the hazing of new pupils was both barbarous and obscene Two incidents
following one on the heels of the other tended to produce an advance in
civilization by the means as so commonly happens of a passing appeal
to savage standards The first was the arrival of a little gentleman
from Armenia He had a fez upon his head and what nobody counted on a
dagger in his pocket The hazing was set about in the customary style
and perhaps in virtue of the victims headgear even more boisterously
than usual He bore it at first with an inviting patience but upon one
of the students proceeding to an unpardonable freedom plucked out
his knife and suddenly plunged it in the belly of the jester This
gentleman I am pleased to say passed months upon a bed of sickness
before he was in a position to resume his studies The second incident
was that which had earned Pinkerton his reputation In a crowded studio
while some very filthy brutalities were being practised on a trembling
debutant a tall pale fellow sprang from his stool and without the
smallest preface or explanation sang out All English and Americans to
clear the shop Our race is brutal but not filthy and the summons
was nobly responded to Every AngloSaxon student seized his stool in
a moment the studio was full of bloody coxcombs the French fleeing in
disorder for the door the victim liberated and amazed In this feat of
arms both Englishspeaking nations covered themselves with glory
but I am proud to claim the author of the whole for an American and
a patriotic American at that being the same gentleman who had
subsequently to be held down in the bottom of a box during a performance
of _LOncle Sam_ sobbing at intervals My country O my country
While yet another my new acquaintance Pinkerton was supposed to have
made the most conspicuous figure in the actual battle At one blow he
had broken his own stool and sent the largest of his opponents back
foremost through what we used to call a conscientious nude It appears
that in the continuation of his flight this fallen warrior issued on
the boulevard still framed in the burst canvas

It will be understood how much talk the incident aroused in the
students quarter and that I was highly gratified to make the
acquaintance of my famous countryman It chanced I was to see more of
the quixotic side of his character before the morning was done for as
we continued to stroll together I found myself near the studio of a
young Frenchman whose work I had promised to examine and in the fashion
of the quarter carried up Pinkerton along with me Some of my comrades
of this date were pretty obnoxious fellows I could almost always admire
and respect the grownup practitioners of art in Paris but many of
those who were still in a state of pupilage were sorry specimens so
much so that I used often to wonder where the painters came from and
where the brutes of students went to A similar mystery hangs over the
intermediate stages of the medical profession and must have perplexed
the least observant The ruffian at least whom I now carried Pinkerton
to visit was one of the most crapulous in the quarter He turned
out for our delectation a huge crust as we used to call it of St
Stephen wallowing in red upon his belly in an exhausted receiver and
a crowd of Hebrews in blue green and yellow pelting himapparently
with buns and while we gazed upon this contrivance regaled us with
a piece of his own recent biography of which his mind was still very
full and which he seemed to fancy represented him in a heroic posture
I was one of those cosmopolitan Americans who accept the world whether
at home or abroad as they find it and whose favourite part is that
of the spectator yet even I was listening with illsuppressed disgust
when I was aware of a violent plucking at my sleeve

Is he saying he kicked her down stairs asked Pinkerton white as St
Stephen

Yes said I his discarded mistress and then he pelted her with
stones I suppose thats what gave him the idea for his picture He has
just been alleging the pathetic excuse that she was old enough to be his
mother

Something like a sob broke from Pinkerton Tell him he gaspedI
cant speak this language though I understand a little I never had any
proper educationtell him Im going to punch his head

For Gods sake do nothing of the sort I cried They dont
understand that sort of thing here And I tried to bundle him out

Tell him first what we think of him he objected Let me tell him
what he looks in the eyes of a pureminded American

Leave that to me said I thrusting Pinkerton clear through the door

Questce quil a1 inquired the student

1 Whats the matter with him

Monsieur se sent mal au coeur davoir trop regarde votre croute2
said I and made my escape scarce with dignity at Pinkertons heels

2 The gentleman is sick at his stomach from having looked too long at
your daub

What did you say to him he asked

The only thing that he could feel was my reply

After this scene the freedom with which I had ejected my new
acquaintance and the precipitation with which I had followed him the
least I could do was to propose luncheon I have forgot the name of the
place to which I led him nothing loath it was on the far side of the
Luxembourg at least with a garden behind where we were speedily set
face to face at table and began to dig into each others history
and character like terriers after rabbits according to the approved
fashion of youth

Pinkertons parents were from the old country there too I incidentally
gathered he had himself been born though it was a circumstance he
seemed prone to forget Whether he had run away or his father had
turned him out I never fathomed but about the age of twelve he was
thrown upon his own resources A travelling tintype photographer picked
him up like a haw out of a hedgerow on a wayside in New Jersey took
a fancy to the urchin carried him on with him in his wandering life
taught him all he knew himselfto take tintypes as well as I can make
out and doubt the Scriptures and died at last in Ohio at the corner
of a road He was a grand specimen cried Pinkerton I wish you could
have seen him Mr Dodd He had an appearance of magnanimity that used
to remind me of the patriarchs On the death of this random protector
the boy inherited the plant and continued the business It was a life
I could have chosen Mr Dodd he cried I have been in all the finest
scenes of that magnificent continent that we were born to be the heirs
of I wish you could see my collection of tintypes I wish I had them
here They were taken for my own pleasure and to be a memento and they
show Nature in her grandest as well as her gentlest moments As he
tramped the Western States and Territories taking tintypes the boy
was continually getting hold of books good bad and indifferent
popular and abstruse from the novels of Sylvanus Cobb to Euclids
Elements both of which I found to my almost equal wonder he had
managed to peruse he was taking stock by the way of the people the
products and the country with an eye unusually observant and a
memory unusually retentive and he was collecting for himself a body of
magnanimous and semiintellectual nonsense which he supposed to be the
natural thoughts and to contain the whole duty of the born American
To be pureminded to be patriotic to get culture and money with both
hands and with the same irrational fervourthese appeared to be the
chief articles of his creed In later days not of course upon this
first occasion I would sometimes ask him why and he had his answer
pat To build up the type he would cry Were all committed to that
were all under bond to fulfil the American Type Loudon the hope of
the world is there If we fail like these old feudal monarchies what
is left

The trade of a tintyper proved too narrow for the lads ambition it
was insusceptible of expansion he explained it was not truly modern
and by a sudden conversion of front he became a railroadscalper The
principles of this trade I never clearly understood but its essence
appears to be to cheat the railroads out of their due fare I threw my
whole soul into it I grudged myself food and sleep while I was at it
the most practised hands admitted I had caught on to the idea in a month
and revolutionised the practice inside of a year he said And theres
interest in it too Its amusing to pick out some one going by make up
your mind about his character and tastes dash out of the office and hit
him flying with an offer of the very place he wants to go to I dont
think there was a scalper on the continent made fewer blunders But I
took it only as a stage I was saving every dollar I was looking
ahead I knew what I wantedwealth education a refined home and a
conscientious cultured lady for a wife for Mr Doddthis with
a formidable outcryevery man is bound to marry above him if the
womans not the mans superior I brand it as mere sensuality There was
my idea at least That was what I was saving for and enough too But
it isnt every man I know thatits far from every mancould do what
I did close up the livest agency in Saint Jo where he was coining
dollars by the pot set out alone without a friend or a word of French
and settle down here to spend his capital learning art

Was it an old taste I asked him or a sudden fancy

Neither Mr Dodd he admitted Of course I had learned in my
tintyping excursions to glory and exult in the works of God But it
wasnt that I just said to myself What is most wanted in my age and
country More culture and more art I said and I chose the best place
saved my money and came here to get them

The whole attitude of this young man warmed and shamed me He had more
fire in his little toe than I had in my whole carcase he was stuffed to
bursting with the manly virtues thrift and courage glowed in him and
even if his artistic vocation seemed to one of my exclusive tenets not
quite clear who could predict what might be accomplished by a creature
so fullblooded and so inspired with animal and intellectual energy So
when he proposed that I should come and see his work one of the regular
stages of a Latin Quarter friendship I followed him with interest and
hope

He lodged parsimoniously at the top of a tall house near the
Observatory in a bare room principally furnished with his own trunks
and papered with his own despicable studies No man has less taste for
disagreeable duties than myself perhaps there is only one subject on
which I cannot flatter a man without a blush but upon that upon all
that touches art my sincerity is Roman Once and twice I made the
circuit of his walls in silence spying in every corner for some spark
of merit he meanwhile following close at my heels reading the
verdict in my face with furtive glances presenting some fresh study for
my inspection with undisguised anxiety and after it had been silently
weighed in the balances and found wanting whisking it away with an open
gesture of despair By the time the second round was completed we were
both extremely depressed

O he groaned breaking the long silence its quite unnecessary you
should speak

Do you want me to be frank with you I think you are wasting time
said I

You dont see any promise he inquired beguiled by some return of
hope and turning upon me the embarrassing brightness of his eye Not
in this stilllife here of the melon One fellow thought it good

It was the least I could do to give the melon a more particular
examination which when I had done I could but shake my head I am
truly sorry Pinkerton said I but I cant advise you to persevere

He seemed to recover his fortitude at the moment rebounding from
disappointment like a man of indiarubber Well said he stoutly I
dont know that Im surprised But Ill go on with the course and throw
my whole soul into it too You mustnt think the time is lost Its all
culture it will help me to extend my relations when I get back home
it may fit me for a position on one of the illustrateds and then I can
always turn dealer he said uttering the monstrous proposition
which was enough to shake the Latin Quarter to the dust with entire
simplicity Its all experience besides he continued and it seems
to me theres a tendency to underrate experience both as net profit and
investment Never mind Thats done with But it took courage for you
to say what you did and Ill never forget it Heres my hand Mr Dodd
Im not your equal in culture or talent

You know nothing about that I interrupted I have seen your work
but you havent seen mine

No more I have he cried and lets go see it at once But I know you
are away up I can feel it here

To say truth I was almost ashamed to introduce him to my studiomy
work whether absolutely good or bad being so vastly superior to his
But his spirits were now quite restored and he amazed me on the way
with his lighthearted talk and new projects So that I began at last
to understand how matters lay that this was not an artist who had been
deprived of the practice of his single art but only a business man
of very extended interests informed perhaps something of the most
suddenly that one investment out of twenty had gone wrong

As a matter of fact besides although I never suspected it he was
already seeking consolation with another of the muses and pleasing
himself with the notion that he would repay me for my sincerity cement
our friendship and at one and the same blow restore my estimation of
his talents Several times already when I had been speaking of myself
he had pulled out a writingpad and scribbled a brief note and now
when we entered the studio I saw it in his hand again and the
pencil go to his mouth as he cast a comprehensive glance round the
uncomfortable building

Are you going to make a sketch of it I could not help asking as I
unveiled the Genius of Muskegon

Ah thats my secret said he Never you mind A mouse can help a
lion

He walked round my statue and had the design explained to him I had
represented Muskegon as a young almost a stripling mother with
something of an Indian type the babe upon her knees was winged to
indicate our soaring future and her seat was a medley of sculptured
fragments Greek Roman and Gothic to remind us of the older worlds
from which we trace our generation

Now does this satisfy you Mr Dodd he inquired as soon as I had
explained to him the main features of the design

Well I said the fellows seem to think its not a bad bonne femme
for a beginner I dont think its entirely bad myself Here is the best
point it builds up best from here No it seems to me it has a kind of
merit I admitted but I mean to do better

Ah thats the word cried Pinkerton Theres the word I love and
he scribbled in his pad

What in creation ails you I inquired Its the most commonplace
expression in the English language

Better and better chuckled Pinkerton The unconsciousness of genius
Lord but this is coming in beautiful and he scribbled again

If youre going to be fulsome said I Ill close the place of
entertainment And I threatened to replace the veil upon the Genius

No no said he Dont be in a hurry Give me a point or two Show me
whats particularly good

I would rather you found that out for yourself said I

The trouble is said he that Ive never turned my attention to
sculpture beyond of course admiring it as everybody must who has a
soul So do just be a good fellow and explain to me what you like in
it and what you tried for and where the merit comes in Itll be all
education for me

Well in sculpture you see the first thing you have to consider
is the masses Its after all a kind of architecture I began and
delivered a lecture on that branch of art with illustrations from
my own masterpiece there present all of which if you dont mind
or whether you mind or not I mean to conscientiously omit Pinkerton
listened with a fiery interest questioned me with a certain
uncultivated shrewdness and continued to scratch down notes and tear
fresh sheets from his pad I found it inspiring to have my words thus
taken down like a professors lecture and having had no previous
experience of the press I was unaware that they were all being taken
down wrong For the same reason incredible as it must appear in
an American I never entertained the least suspicion that they were
destined to be dished up with a sauce of pennyalining gossip and
myself my person and my works of art butchered to make a holiday
for the readers of a Sunday paper Night had fallen over the Genius of
Muskegon before the issue of my theoretic eloquence was stayed nor did
I separate from my new friend without an appointment for the morrow

I was indeed greatly taken with this first view of my countryman
and continued on further acquaintance to be interested amused and
attracted by him in about equal proportions I must not say he had a
fault not only because my mouth is sealed by gratitude but because
those he had sprang merely from his education and you could see he had
cultivated and improved them like virtues For all that I can never
deny he was a troublous friend to me and the trouble began early

It may have been a fortnight later that I divined the secret of the
writingpad My wretch it leaked out wrote letters for a paper in the
West and had filled a part of one of them with descriptions of myself
I pointed out to him that he had no right to do so without asking my
permission

Why this is just what I hoped he exclaimed I thought you didnt
seem to catch on only it seemed too good to be true

But my good fellow you were bound to warn me I objected

I know its generally considered etiquette he admitted but between
friends and when it was only with a view of serving you I thought it
wouldnt matter I wanted it if possible to come on you as a surprise
I wanted you just to waken like Lord Byron and find the papers full of
you You must admit it was a natural thought And no man likes to boast
of a favour beforehand

But heavens and earth how do you know I think it a favour I cried

He became immediately plunged in despair You think it a liberty said
he I see that I would rather have cut off my hand I would stop it
now only its too late its published by now And I wrote it with so
much pride and pleasure

I could think of nothing but how to console him O I daresay its all
right said I I know you meant it kindly and you would be sure to do
it in good taste

That you may swear to he cried Its a pure bright A number 1
paper the St Jo _Sunday Herald_ The idea of the series was quite my
own I interviewed the editor put it to him straight the freshness of
the idea took him and I walked out of that office with the contract in
my pocket and did my first Paris letter that evening in Saint Jo The
editor did no more than glance his eye down the headlines Youre the
man for us said he

I was certainly far from reassured by this sketch of the class of
literature in which I was to make my first appearance but I said no
more and possessed my soul in patience until the day came when I
received a copy of a newspaper marked in the corner Compliments of
JP I opened it with sensible shrinkings and there wedged between an
account of a prizefight and a skittish article upon chiropodythink of
chiropody treated with a leerI came upon a column and a half in which
myself and my poor statue were embalmed Like the editor with the first
of the series I did but glance my eye down the headlines and was more
than satisfied

 ANOTHER OF PINKERTONS SPICY CHATS

 ART PRACTITIONERS IN PARIS

 MUSKEGONS COLUMNED CAPITOL

 SON OF MILLIONAIRE DODD

 PATRIOT AND ARTIST

 HE MEANS TO DO BETTER

In the body of the text besides my eye caught as it passed some
deadly expressions Figure somewhat fleshy bright intellectual
smile the unconsciousness of genius Now Mr Dodd resumed the
reporter what would be your idea of a distinctively American quality
in sculpture It was true the question had been asked it was true
alas that I had answered and now here was my reply or some strange
hash of it gibbeted in the cold publicity of type I thanked God that
my French fellowstudents were ignorant of English but when I thought
of the Britishof Myner for instance or the StennisesI think I
could have fallen on Pinkerton and beat him

To divert my thoughts if it were possible from this calamity I turned
to a letter from my father which had arrived by the same post The
envelope contained a strip of newspapercutting and my eye caught
again Son of Millionaire DoddFigure somewhat fleshy and the rest
of the degrading nonsense What would my father think of it I wondered
and opened his manuscript My dearest boy it began I send you a
cutting which has pleased me very much from a St Joseph paper of
high standing At last you seem to be coming fairly to the front and
I cannot but reflect with delight and gratitude how very few youths of
your age occupy nearly two columns of pressmatter all to themselves
I only wish your dear mother had been here to read it over my shoulder
but we will hope she shares my grateful emotion in a better place Of
course I have sent a copy to your grandfather and uncle in Edinburgh
so you can keep the one I enclose This Jim Pinkerton seems a valuable
acquaintance he has certainly great talent and it is a good general
rule to keep in with pressmen

I hope it will be set down to the right side of my account but I had
no sooner read these words so touchingly silly than my anger against
Pinkerton was swallowed up in gratitude Of all the circumstances of my
career my birth perhaps excepted not one had given my poor father so
profound a pleasure as this article in the _Sunday Herald_ What a fool
then was I to be lamenting when I had at last and for once and
at the cost of only a few blushes paid back a fraction of my debt
of gratitude So that when I next met Pinkerton I took things very
lightly my father was pleased and thought the letter very clever I
told him for my own part I had no taste for publicity thought the
public had no concern with the artist only with his art and though I
owned he had handled it with great consideration I should take it as a
favour if he never did it again

There it is he said despondingly Ive hurt you You cant deceive
me Loudon Its the want of tact and its incurable He sat down and
leaned his head upon his hand I had no advantages when I was young
you see he added

Not in the least my dear fellow said I Only the next time you wish
to do me a service just speak about my work leave my wretched person
out and my still more wretched conversation and above all I added
with an irrepressible shudder dont tell them how I said it Theres
that phrase now With a proud glad smile Who cares whether I smiled
or not

Oh there now Loudon youre entirely wrong he broke in Thats
what the public likes thats the merit of the thing the literary
value Its to call up the scene before them its to enable the
humblest citizen to enjoy that afternoon the same as I did Think what
it would have been to me when I was tramping around with my tintypes to
find a column and a half of real cultured conversationan artist in
his studio abroad talking of his artand to know how he looked as he
did it and what the room was like and what he had for breakfast and
to tell myself eating tinned beans beside a creek that if all went
well the same sort of thing would sooner or later happen to myself
why Loudon it would have been like a peephole into heaven

Well if it gives so much pleasure I admitted the sufferers
shouldnt complain Only give the other fellows a turn

The end of the matter was to bring myself and the journalist in a more
close relation If I know anything at all of human natureand the IF
is no mere figure of speech but stands for honest doubtno series
of benefits conferred or even dangers shared would have so rapidly
confirmed our friendship as this quarrel avoided this fundamental
difference of taste and training accepted and condoned




CHAPTER IV IN WHICH I EXPERIENCE EXTREMES OF FORTUNE


Whether it came from my training and repeated bankruptcy at the
commercial college or by direct inheritance from old Loudon the
Edinburgh mason there can be no doubt about the fact that I was
thrifty Looking myself impartially over I believe that is my only
manly virtue During my first two years in Paris I not only made it a
point to keep well inside of my allowance but accumulated considerable
savings in the bank You will say with my masquerade of living as a
penniless student it must have been easy to do so I should have had no
difficulty however in doing the reverse Indeed it is wonderful I did
not and early in the third year or soon after I had known Pinkerton a
singular incident proved it to have been equally wise Quarterday came
and brought no allowance A letter of remonstrance was despatched and
for the first time in my experience remained unanswered A cablegram
was more effectual for it brought me at least a promise of attention
Will write at once my father telegraphed but I waited long for his
letter I was puzzled angry and alarmed but thanks to my previous
thrift I cannot say that I was ever practically embarrassed The
embarrassment the distress the agony were all for my unhappy father
at home in Muskegon struggling for life and fortune against untoward
chances returning at night from a day of illstarred shifts and
ventures to read and perhaps to weep over that last harsh letter from
his only child to which he lacked the courage to reply

Nearly three months after time and when my economies were beginning
to run low I received at last a letter with the customary bills of
exchange

My dearest boy it ran I believe in the press of anxious business
your letters and even your allowance have been somewhile neglected You
must try to forgive your poor old dad for he has had a trying time and
now when it is over the doctor wants me to take my shotgun and go
to the Adirondacks for a change You must not fancy I am sick only
overdriven and under the weather Many of our foremost operators have
gone down John T MBrady skipped to Canada with a trunkful of boodle
Billy Sandwith Charlie Downs Joe Kaiser and many others of our
leading men in this city bit the dust But BigHead Dodd has again
weathered the blizzard and I think I have fixed things so that we may
be richer than ever before autumn

Now I will tell you my dear what I propose You say you are well
advanced with your first statue start in manfully and finish it and if
your teacherI can never remember how to spell his namewill send me
a certificate that it is up to market standard you shall have ten
thousand dollars to do what you like with either at home or in Paris
I suggest since you say the facilities for work are so much greater
in that city you would do well to buy or build a little home and
the first thing you know your dad will be dropping in for a luncheon
Indeed I would come now for I am beginning to grow old and I long to
see my dear boy but there are still some operations that want watching
and nursing Tell your friend Mr Pinkerton that I read his letters
every week and though I have looked in vain lately for my Loudons
name still I learn something of the life he is leading in that strange
old world depicted by an able pen

Here was a letter that no young man could possibly digest in solitude
It marked one of those junctures when the confidant is necessary and
the confidant selected was none other than Jim Pinkerton My fathers
message may have had an influence in this decision but I scarce suppose
so for the intimacy was already far advanced I had a genuine and
lively taste for my compatriot I laughed at I scolded and I loved
him He upon his side paid me a kind of doglike service of admiration
gazing at me from afar off as at one who had liberally enjoyed those
advantages which he envied for himself He followed at heel his laugh
was ready chorus our friends gave him the nickname of The Henchman
It was in this insidious form that servitude approached me

Pinkerton and I read and reread the famous news he I can swear with
an enjoyment as unalloyed and far more vocal than my own The statue was
nearly done a few days work sufficed to prepare it for exhibition the
master was approached he gave his consent and one cloudless morning
of May beheld us gathered in my studio for the hour of trial The
master wore his manyhued rosette he came attended by two of my French
fellowpupilsfriends of mine and both considerable sculptors in Paris
at this hour Corporal John as we used to call him breaking for once
those habits of study and reserve which have since carried him so
high in the opinion of the world had left his easel of a morning to
countenance a fellowcountryman in some suspense My dear old Romney
was there by particular request for who that knew him would think
a pleasure quite complete unless he shared it or not support a
mortification more easily if he were present to console The party
was completed by John Myner the Englishman by the brothers
StennisStennisaine and Stennisfrere as they used to figure on
their accounts at Barbizona pair of harebrained Scots and by the
inevitable Jim as white as a sheet and bedewed with the sweat of
anxiety

I suppose I was little better myself when I unveiled the Genius of
Muskegon The master walked about it seriously then he smiled

It is already not so bad said he in that funny English of which he
was so proud No already not so bad

We all drew a deep breath of relief and Corporal John as the most
considerable junior present explained to him it was intended for a
public building a kind of prefecture

He Quoi cried he relapsing into French Questce que vous me
chantez la O in America he added on further information being
hastily furnished That is anozer sing O very good very good

The idea of the required certificate had to be introduced to his mind
in the light of a pleasantrythe fancy of a nabob little more advanced
than the red Indians of Fennimore Cooperr and it took all our talents
combined to conceive a form of words that would be acceptable on
both sides One was found however Corporal John engrossed it in his
undecipherable hand the master lent it the sanction of his name and
flourish I slipped it into an envelope along with one of the two
letters I had ready prepared in my pocket and as the rest of us moved
off along the boulevard to breakfast Pinkerton was detached in a cab
and duly committed it to the post

The breakfast was ordered at Lavenues where no one need be ashamed
to entertain even the master the table was laid in the garden I had
chosen the bill of fare myself on the wine question we held a council
of war with the most fortunate results and the talk as soon as the
master laid aside his painful English became fast and furious There
were a few interruptions indeed in the way of toasts The masters
health had to be drunk and he responded in a little wellturned speech
full of neat allusions to my future and to the United States my health
followed and then my fathers must not only be proposed and drunk
but a full report must be despatched to him at once by cablegraman
extravagance which was almost the means of the masters dissolution
Choosing Corporal John to be his confidant on the ground I presume
that he was already too good an artist to be any longer an American
except in name he summed up his amazement in one oftrepeated
formulaCest barbare Apart from these genial formalities we
talked talked of art and talked of it as only artists can Here in the
South Seas we talk schooners most of the time in the Quarter we talked
art with the like unflagging interest and perhaps as much result

Before very long the master went away Corporal John who was already a
sort of young master followed on his heels and the rank and file were
naturally relieved by their departure We were now among equals the
bottle passed the conversation sped I think I can still hear the
Stennis brothers pour forth their copious tirades Dijon my portly
French fellowstudent drop witticisms wellconditioned like himself
and another who was weak in foreign languages dash hotly into the
current of talk with some Je trove que pore oon sontimong de delicacy
Corot  or some Pour moi Corot est le plou  and then his
little raft of French foundering at once scramble silently to shore
again He at least could understand but to Pinkerton I think the
noise the wine the sun the shadows of the leaves and the esoteric
glory of being seated at a foreign festival made up the whole available
means of entertainment

We sat down about half past eleven I suppose it was two when
some point arising and some particular picture being instanced an
adjournment to the Louvre was proposed I paid the score and in a
moment we were trooping down the Rue de Renne It was smoking hot Paris
glittered with that superficial brilliancy which is so agreeable to the
man in high spirits and in moods of dejection so depressing the wine
sang in my ears it danced and brightened in my eyes The pictures that
we saw that afternoon as we sped briskly and loquaciously through the
immortal galleries appear to me upon a retrospect the loveliest
of all the comments we exchanged to have touched the highest mark of
criticism grave or gay

It was only when we issued again from the museum that a difference of
race broke up the party Dijon proposed an adjournment to a cafe there
to finish the afternoon on beer the elder Stennis revolted at the
thought moved for the country a forest if possible and a long walk
At once the English speakers rallied to the name of any exercise even
to me who have been often twitted with my sedentary habits the thought
of country air and stillness proved invincibly attractive It appeared
upon investigation we had just time to hail a cab and catch one of the
fast trains for Fontainebleau Beyond the clothes we stood in all were
destitute of what is called with dainty vagueness personal effects
and it was earnestly mooted on the other side whether we had not time
to call upon the way and pack a satchel But the Stennis boys exclaimed
upon our effeminacy They had come from London it appeared a week
before with nothing but greatcoats and toothbrushes No baggagethere
was the secret of existence It was expensive to be sure for every
time you had to comb your hair a barber must be paid and every time
you changed your linen one shirt must be bought and another thrown
away but anything was better argued these young gentlemen than to
be the slaves of haversacks A fellow has to get rid gradually of all
material attachments that was manhood said they and as long as you
were bound down to anythinghouse umbrella or portmanteauyou were
still tethered by the umbilical cord Something engaging in this
theory carried the most of us away The two Frenchmen indeed retired
scoffing to their bock and Romney being too poor to join the
excursion on his own resources and too proud to borrow melted
unobtrusively away Meanwhile the remainder of the company crowded
the benches of a cab the horse was urged as horses have to be by an
appeal to the pocket of the driver the train caught by the inside of
a minute and in less than an hour and a half we were breathing deep
of the sweet air of the forest and stretching our legs up the hill from
Fontainebleau octroi bound for Barbizon That the leading members of
our party covered the distance in fiftyone minutes and a half is I
believe one of the historic landmarks of the colony but you will
scarce be surprised to learn that I was somewhat in the rear Myner
a comparatively philosophic Briton kept me company in my deliberate
advance the glory of the suns going down the fall of the long
shadows the inimitable scent and the inspiration of the woods attuned
me more and more to walk in a silence which progressively infected my
companion and I remember that when at last he spoke I was startled
from a deep abstraction

Your father seems to be a pretty good kind of a father said he Why
dont he come to see you I was ready with some dozen of reasons and
had more in stock but Myner with that shrewdness which made him feared
and admired suddenly fixed me with his eyeglass and asked Ever press
him

The blood came in my face No I had never pressed him I had never even
encouraged him to come I was proud of him proud of his handsome looks
of his kind gentle ways of that bright face he could show when others
were happy proud too meanly proud if you like of his great wealth
and startling liberalities And yet he would have been in the way of my
Paris life of much of which he would have disapproved I had feared to
expose to criticism his innocent remarks on art I had told myself I
had even partly believed he did not want to come I had been and still
am convinced that he was sure to be unhappy out of Muskegon in short
I had a thousand reasons good and bad not all of which could alter one
iota of the fact that I knew he only waited for my invitation

Thank you Myner said I youre a much better fellow than ever I
supposed Ill write tonight

O youre a pretty decent sort yourself returned Myner with more
than his usual flippancy of manner but as I was gratefully aware not
a trace of his occasional irony of meaning

Well these were brave days on which I could dwell forever Brave
too were those that followed when Pinkerton and I walked Paris and the
suburbs viewing and pricing houses for my new establishment or covered
ourselves with dust and returned laden with Chinese gods and brass
warmingpans from the dealers in antiquities I found Pinkerton well
up in the situation of these establishments as well as in the current
prices and with quite a smattering of critical judgment it turned out
he was investing capital in pictures and curiosities for the States and
the superficial thoroughness of the creature appeared in the fact that
although he would never be a connoisseur he was already something of
an expert The things themselves left him as near as may be cold but he
had a joy of his own in understanding how to buy and sell them

In such engagements the time passed until I might very well expect
an answer from my father Two mails followed each other and brought
nothing By the third I received a long and almost incoherent letter
of remorse encouragement consolation and despair From this pitiful
document which with a movement of piety I burned as soon as I had
read it I gathered that the bubble of my fathers wealth was burst
that he was now both penniless and sick and that I so far from
expecting ten thousand dollars to throw away in juvenile extravagance
must look no longer for the quarterly remittances on which I lived My
case was hard enough but I had sense enough to perceive and decency
enough to do my duty I sold my curiosities or rather I sent Pinkerton
to sell them and he had previously bought and now disposed of them so
wisely that the loss was trifling This with what remained of my last
allowance left me at the head of no less than five thousand francs
Five hundred I reserved for my own immediate necessities the rest I
mailed inside of the week to my father at Muskegon where they came in
time to pay his funeral expenses

The news of his death was scarcely a surprise and scarce a grief to me
I could not conceive my father a poor man He had led too long a life
of thoughtless and generous profusion to endure the change and though I
grieved for myself I was able to rejoice that my father had been taken
from the battle I grieved I say for myself and it is probable there
were at the same date many thousands of persons grieving with less
cause I had lost my father I had lost the allowance my whole fortune
including what had been returned from Muskegon scarce amounted to
a thousand francs and to crown my sorrows the statuary contract
had changed hands The new contractor had a son of his own or else a
nephew and it was signified to me with businesslike plainness that I
must find another market for my pigs In the meanwhile I had given up my
room and slept on a trucklebed in the corner of the studio where as I
read myself to sleep at night and when I awoke in the morning that now
useless bulk the Genius of Muskegon was ever present to my eyes Poor
stone lady born to be enthroned under the gilded echoing dome of the
new capitol whither was she now to drift for what base purposes be
ultimately broken up like an unseaworthy ship and what should befall
her illstarred artificer standing with his thousand francs on the
threshold of a life so hard as that of the unbefriended sculptor

It was a subject often and earnestly debated by myself and Pinkerton
In his opinion I should instantly discard my profession Just drop it
here and now he would say Come back home with me and lets throw
our whole soul into business I have the capital you bring the culture
Dodd  PinkertonI never saw a better name for an advertisement and
you cant think Loudon how much depends upon a name On my side I
would admit that a sculptor should possess one of three thingscapital
influence or an energy only to be qualified as hellish The first two
I had now lost to the third I never had the smallest claim and yet I
wanted the cowardice or perhaps it was the courage to turn my back
on my career without a fight I told him besides that however poor
my chances were in sculpture I was convinced they were yet worse in
business for which I equally lacked taste and aptitude But upon this
head he was my father over again assured me that I spoke in ignorance
that any intelligent and cultured person was Bound to succeed that I
must besides have inherited some of my fathers fitness and at
any rate that I had been regularly trained for that career in the
commercial college


Pinkerton I said cant you understand that as long as I was there
I never took the smallest interest in any stricken thing The whole
affair was poison to me

Its not possible he would cry it cant be you couldnt live in
the midst of it and not feel the charm with all your poetry of soul
you couldnt help Loudon he would go on you drive me crazy You
expect a man to be all broken up about the sunset and not to care a
dime for a place where fortunes are fought for and made and lost all
day or for a career that consists in studying up life till you have it
at your fingerends spying out every cranny where you can get your
hand in and a dollar out and standing there in the midstone foot on
bankruptcy the other on a borrowed dollar and the whole thing spinning
round you like a millraking in the stamps in spite of fate and
fortune

To this romance of dickering I would reply with the romance which is
also the virtue of art reminding him of those examples of constancy
through many tribulations with which the role of Apollo is illustrated
from the case of Millet to those of many of our friends and comrades
who had chosen this agreeable mountain path through life and were now
bravely clambering among rocks and brambles penniless and hopeful

You will never understand it Pinkerton I would say You look to the
result you want to see some profit of your endeavours that is why you
could never learn to paint if you lived to be Methusalem The result
is always a fizzle the eyes of the artist are turned in he lives for
a frame of mind Look at Romney now There is the nature of the artist
He hasnt a cent and if you offered him tomorrow the command of an
army or the presidentship of the United States he wouldnt take it
and you know he wouldnt

I suppose not Pinkerton would cry scouring his hair with both his
hands and I cant see why I cant see what in fits he would be after
not to I dont seem to rise to these views Of course its the
fault of not having had advantages in early life but Loudon Im so
miserably low that it seems to me silly The fact is he might add with
a smile I dont seem to have the least use for a frame of mind without
square meals and you cant get it out of my head that its a mans duty
to die rich if he can

What for I asked him once

O I dont know he replied Why in snakes should anybody want to be
a sculptor if you come to that I would love to sculp myself But what
I cant see is why you should want to do nothing else It seems to argue
a poverty of nature

Whether or not he ever came to understand meand I have been so tossed
about since then that I am not very sure I understand myselfhe soon
perceived that I was perfectly in earnest and after about ten days
of argument suddenly dropped the subject and announced that he was
wasting capital and must go home at once No doubt he should have gone
long before and had already lingered over his intended time for the
sake of our companionship and my misfortune but man is so unjustly
minded that the very fact which ought to have disarmed only embittered
my vexation I resented his departure in the light of a desertion I
would not say but doubtless I betrayed it and something hangdog in
the mans face and bearing led me to believe he was himself remorseful
It is certain at least that during the time of his preparations we
drew sensibly aparta circumstance that I recall with shame On the
last day he had me to dinner at a restaurant which he knew I had
formerly frequented and had only forsworn of late from considerations
of economy He seemed ill at ease I was myself both sorry and sulky
and the meal passed with little conversation

Now Loudon said he with a visible effort after the coffee was
come and our pipes lighted you can never understand the gratitude and
loyalty I bear you You dont know what a boon it is to be taken up by
a man that stands on the pinnacle of civilization you cant think how
its refined and purified me how its appealed to my spiritual nature
and I want to tell you that I would die at your door like a dog

I dont know what answer I tried to make but he cut me short

Let me say it out he cried I revere you for your wholesouled
devotion to art I cant rise to it but theres a strain of poetry in
my nature Loudon that responds to it I want you to carry it out and
I mean to help you

Pinkerton what nonsense is this I interrupted

Now dont get mad Loudon this is a plain piece of business said he
its done every day its even typical How are all those fellows over
here in Paris Henderson Sumner Longits all the same story a
young man just plum full of artistic genius on the one side a man of
business on the other who doesnt know what to do with his dollars

But you fool youre as poor as a rat I cried

You wait till I get my irons in the fire returned Pinkerton Im
bound to be rich and I tell you I mean to have some of the fun as I go
along Heres your first allowance take it at the hand of a friend Im
one that holds friendship sacred as you do yourself Its only a hundred
francs youll get the same every month and as soon as my business
begins to expand well increase it to something fitting And so far from
its being a favour just let me handle your statuary for the American
market and Ill call it one of the smartest strokes of business in my
life

It took me a long time and it had cost us both much grateful and
painful emotion before I had finally managed to refuse his offer and
compounded for a bottle of particular wine He dropped the subject at
last suddenly with a Never mind thats all done with nor did he
again refer to the subject though we passed together the rest of the
afternoon and I accompanied him on his departure to the doors of the
waitingroom at St Lazare I felt myself strangely alone a voice told
me that I had rejected both the counsels of wisdom and the helping
hand of friendship and as I passed through the great bright city on
my homeward way I measured it for the first time with the eye of an
adversary




CHAPTER V IN WHICH I AM DOWN ON MY LUCK IN PARIS


In no part of the world is starvation an agreeable business but I
believe it is admitted there is no worse place to starve in than this
city of Paris The appearances of life are there so especially gay
it is so much a magnified beergarden the houses are so ornate the
theatres so numerous the very pace of the vehicles is so brisk that a
man in any deep concern of mind or pain of body is constantly driven in
upon himself In his own eyes he seems the one serious creature moving
in a world of horrible unreality voluble people issuing from a
cafe the queue at theatre doors Sunday cabfuls of secondrate
pleasureseekers the bedizened ladies of the pavement the show in the
jewellers windowsall the familiar sights contributing to flout his
own unhappiness want and isolation At the same time if he be at all
after my pattern he is perhaps supported by a childish satisfaction
this is life at last he may tell himself this is the real thing
the bladders on which I was set swimming are now empty my own weight
depends upon the ocean by my own exertions I must perish or succeed
and I am now enduring in the vivid fact what I so much delighted to
read of in the case of Lonsteau or Lucien Rodolphe or Schaunard

Of the steps of my misery I cannot tell at length In ordinary times
what were politically called loans although they were never meant to
be repaid were matters of constant course among the students and many
a man has partly lived on them for years But my misfortune befell me
at an awkward juncture Many of my friends were gone others were
themselves in a precarious situation Romney for instance was reduced
to tramping Paris in a pair of country sabots his only suit of clothes
so imperfect in spite of cunningly adjusted pins that the authorities
at the Luxembourg suggested his withdrawal from the gallery Dijon too
was on a leeshore designing clocks and gasbrackets for a dealer and
the most he could do was to offer me a corner of his studio where I
might work My own studio it will be gathered I had by that time lost
and in the course of my expulsion the Genius of Muskegon was finally
separated from her author To continue to possess a fullsized statue
a man must have a studio a gallery or at least the freedom of a back
garden He cannot carry it about with him like a satchel in the
bottom of a cab nor can he cohabit in a garret ten by fifteen with
so momentous a companion It was my first idea to leave her behind at
my departure There in her birthplace she might lend an inspiration
methought to my successor But the proprietor with whom I had
unhappily quarrelled seized the occasion to be disagreeable and called
upon me to remove my property For a man in such straits as I now found
myself the hire of a lorry was a consideration and yet even that I
could have faced if I had had anywhere to drive to after it was hired
Hysterical laughter seized upon me as I beheld in imagination myself
the waggoner and the Genius of Muskegon standing in the public view of
Paris without the shadow of a destination perhaps driving at last
to the nearest rubbish heap and dumping there among the ordures of a
city the beloved child of my invention From these extremities I was
relieved by a seasonable offer and I parted from the Genius of Muskegon
for thirty francs Where she now stands under what name she is admired
or criticised history does not inform us but I like to think she
may adorn the shrubbery of some suburban teagarden where holiday
shopgirls hang their hats upon the mother and their swains by way
of an approach of gallantry identify the winged infant with the god of
love

In a certain cabmans eatinghouse on the outer boulevard I got credit
for my midday meal Supper I was supposed not to require sitting
down nightly to the delicate table of some rich acquaintances This
arrangement was extremely illconsidered My fable credible enough at
first and so long as my clothes were in good order must have seemed
worse than doubtful after my coat became frayed about the edges and
my boots began to squelch and pipe along the restaurant floors The
allowance of one meal a day besides though suitable enough to the state
of my finances agreed poorly with my stomach The restaurant was a
place I had often visited experimentally to taste the life of students
then more unfortunate than myself and I had never in those days entered
it without disgust or left it without nausea It was strange to find
myself sitting down with avidity rising up with satisfaction and
counting the hours that divided me from my return to such a table But
hunger is a great magician and so soon as I had spent my ready cash
and could no longer fill up on bowls of chocolate or hunks of bread
I must depend entirely on that cabmans eatinghouse and upon certain
rare longexpected longremembered windfalls Dijon for instance
might get paid for some of his potboiling work or else an old friend
would pass through Paris and then I would be entertained to a meal
after my own soul and contract a Latin Quarter loan which would keep
me in tobacco and my morning coffee for a fortnight It might be thought
the latter would appear the more important It might be supposed that a
life led so near the confines of actual famine should have dulled the
nicety of my palate On the contrary the poorer a mans diet the more
sharply is he set on dainties The last of my ready cash about thirty
francs was deliberately squandered on a single dinner and a great part
of my time when I was alone was passed upon the details of imaginary
feasts

One gleam of hope visited mean order for a bust from a rich
Southerner He was freehanded jolly of speech merry of countenance
kept me in good humour through the sittings and when they were over
carried me off with him to dinner and the sights of Paris I ate well
I laid on flesh by all accounts I made a favourable likeness of the
being and I confess I thought my future was assured But when the bust
was done and I had despatched it across the Atlantic I could never
so much as learn of its arrival The blow felled me I should have
lain down and tried no stroke to right myself had not the honour of
my country been involved For Dijon improved the opportunity in the
European style informing me for the first time of the manners of
America how it was a den of banditti without the smallest rudiment of
law or order and debts could be there only collected with a shotgun
The whole world knows it he would say you are alone mon petit
Loudon you are alone to be in ignorance of these facts The judges of
the Supreme Court fought but the other day with stilettos on the bench
at Cincinnati You should read the little book of one of my friends _Le
Touriste dans le FarWest_ you will see it all there in good French
At last incensed by days of such discussion I undertook to prove to
him the contrary and put the affair in the hands of my late fathers
lawyer From him I had the gratification of hearing after a due
interval that my debtor was dead of the yellow fever in Key West and
had left his affairs in some confusion I suppress his name for though
he treated me with cruel nonchalance it is probable he meant to deal
fairly in the end

Soon after this a shade of change in my reception at the cabmans
eatinghouse marked the beginning of a new phase in my distress The
first day I told myself it was but fancy the next I made quite sure
it was a fact the third in mere panic I stayed away and went for
fortyeight hours fasting This was an act of great unreason for the
debtor who stays away is but the more remarked and the boarder who
misses a meal is sure to be accused of infidelity On the fourth day
therefore I returned inwardly quaking The proprietor looked askance
upon my entrance the waitresses who were his daughters neglected my
wants and sniffed at the affected joviality of my salutations last and
most plain when I called for a suisse such as was being served to all
the other diners I was bluntly told there were no more It was obvious
I was near the end of my tether one plank divided me from want and now
I felt it tremble I passed a sleepless night and the first thing in
the morning took my way to Myners studio It was a step I had long
meditated and long refrained from for I was scarce intimate with the
Englishman and though I knew him to possess plenty of money neither
his manner nor his reputation were the least encouraging to beggars


I found him at work on a picture which I was able conscientiously
to praise dressed in his usual tweeds plain but pretty fresh and
standing out in disagreeable contrast to my own withered and degraded
outfit As we talked he continued to shift his eyes watchfully between
his handiwork and the fat model who sat at the far end of the studio
in a state of nature with one arm gallantly arched above her head My
errand would have been difficult enough under the best of circumstances
placed between Myner immersed in his art and the white fat naked
female in a ridiculous attitude I found it quite impossible Again and
again I attempted to approach the point again and again fell back on
commendations of the picture and it was not until the model had enjoyed
an interval of repose during which she took the conversation in her
own hands and regaled us in a soft weak voice with details as to her
husbands prosperity her sisters lamented decline from the paths
of virtue and the consequent wrath of her father a peasant of stern
principles in the vicinity of Chalons on the Marneit was not I say
until after this was over and I had once more cleared my throat for
the attack and once more dropped aside into some commonplace about the
picture that Myner himself brought me suddenly and vigorously to the
point

You didnt come here to talk this rot said he

No I replied sullenly I came to borrow money

He painted awhile in silence

I dont think we were ever very intimate he asked

Thank you said I I can take my answer and I made as if to go
rage boiling in my heart

Of course you can go if you like said Myner but I advise you to
stay and have it out

What more is there to say I cried You dont want to keep me here
for a needless humiliation

Look here Dodd you must try and command your temper said he This
interview is of your own seeking and not mine if you suppose its not
disagreeable to me youre wrong and if you think I will give you money
without knowing thoroughly about your prospects you take me for a fool
Besides he added if you come to look at it youve got over the
worst of it by now you have done the asking and you have every reason
to know I mean to refuse I hold out no false hopes but it may be worth
your while to let me judge

ThusI was going to sayencouraged I stumbled through my story told
him I had credit at the cabmans eatinghouse but began to think it was
drawing to a close how Dijon lent me a corner of his studio where I
tried to model ornaments figures for clocks Time with the scythe Leda
and the swan musketeers for candlesticks and other kickshaws which
had never up to that day been honoured with the least approval

And your room asked Myner

O my room is all right I think said I She is a very good old
lady and has never even mentioned her bill

Because she is a very good old lady I dont see why she should be
fined observed Myner

What do you mean by that I cried

I mean this said he The French give a great deal of credit amongst
themselves they find it pays on the whole or the system would hardly
be continued but I cant see where WE come in I cant see that its
honest of us AngloSaxons to profit by their easy ways and then skip
over the Channel or as you Yankees do across the Atlantic

But Im not proposing to skip I objected

Exactly he replied And shouldnt you Theres the problem You
seem to me to have a lack of sympathy for the proprietors of cabmens
eatinghouses By your own account youre not getting on the longer you
stay itll only be the more out of the pocket of the dear old lady at
your lodgings Now Ill tell you what Ill do if you consent to go
Ill pay your passage to New York and your railway fare and expenses
to Muskegon if I have the name right where your father lived where he
must have left friends and where no doubt youll find an opening I
dont seek any gratitude for of course youll think me a beast but I
do ask you to pay it back when you are able At any rate thats all
I can do It might be different if I thought you a genius Dodd but I
dont and I advise you not to


I think that was uncalled for at least said I

I daresay it was he returned with the same steadiness It seemed to
me pertinent and besides when you ask me for money upon no security
you treat me with the liberty of a friend and its to be presumed that
I can do the like But the point is do you accept

No thank you said I I have another string to my bow

All right says Myner Be sure its honest

Honest honest I cried What do you mean by calling my honesty in
question

I wont if you dont like it he replied You seem to think
honesty as easy as Blind Mans Buff I dont Its some difference of
definition

I went straight from this irritating interview during which Myner had
never discontinued painting to the studio of my old master Only one
card remained for me to play and I was now resolved to play it I
must drop the gentleman and the frockcoat and approach art in the
workmans tunic

Tiens this little Dodd cried the master and then as his eye fell
on my dilapidated clothing I thought I could perceive his countenance
to darken

I made my plea in English for I knew if he were vain of anything it
was of his achievement of the island tongue Master said I will you
take me in your studio again but this time as a workman

I sought your fazer was immensely reech said he

I explained to him that I was now an orphan and penniless

He shook his head I have betterr workmen waiting at my door said he
far betterr workmen

You used to think something of my work sir I pleaded

Somesing somesingyes he cried enough for a son of a reech
mannot enough for an orphan Besides I sought you might learn to be
an artist I did not sink you might learn to be a workman

On a certain bench on the outer boulevard not far from the tomb of
Napoleon a bench shaded at that date by a shabby tree and commanding
a view of muddy roadway and blank wall I sat down to wrestle with my
misery The weather was cheerless and dark in three days I had eaten
but once I had no tobacco my shoes were soaked my trousers horrid
with mire my humour and all the circumstances of the time and place
lugubriously attuned Here were two men who had both spoken fairly of my
work while I was rich and wanted nothing now that I was poor and lacked
all no genius said the one not enough for an orphan the other
and the first offered me my passage like a pauper immigrant and the
second refused me a days wage as a hewer of stoneplain dealing for
an empty belly They had not been insincere in the past they were not
insincere today change of circumstance had introduced a new criterion
that was all

But if I acquitted my two Jobs comforters of insincerity I was yet far
from admitting them infallible Artists had been contemned before
and had lived to turn the laugh on their contemners How old was Corot
before he struck the vein of his own precious metal When had a young
man been more derided or more justly so than the god of my admiration
Balzac Or if I required a bolder inspiration what had I to do but turn
my head to where the gold dome of the Invalides glittered against inky
squalls and recall the tale of him sleeping there from the day when a
young artillerysub could be giggled at and nicknamed PussinBoots by
frisky misses on to the days of so many crowns and so many victories
and so many hundred mouths of cannon and so many thousand warhoofs
trampling the roadways of astonished Europe eighty miles in front of
the grand army To go back to give up to proclaim myself a failure an
ambitious failure first a rocket then a stick I Loudon Dodd who
had refused all other livelihoods with scorn and been advertised in the
Saint Joseph _Sunday Herald_ as a patriot and an artist to be returned
upon my native Muskegon like damaged goods and go the circuit of my
fathers acquaintance cap in hand and begging to sweep offices No by
Napoleon I would die at my chosen trade and the two who had that
day flouted me should live to envy my success or to weep tears of
unavailing penitence behind my pauper coffin

Meantime if my courage was still undiminished I was none the nearer to
a meal At no great distance my cabmans eatinghouse stood at the
tail of a muddy cabrank on the shores of a wide thoroughfare of mud
offering to fancy a face of ambiguous invitation I might be received
I might once more fill my belly there on the other hand it was perhaps
this day the bolt was destined to fall and I might be expelled instead
with vulgar hubbub It was policy to make the attempt and I knew it was
policy but I had already in the course of that one morning endured
too many affronts and I felt I could rather starve than face another I
had courage and to spare for the future none left for that day courage
for the main campaign but not a spark of it for that preliminary
skirmish of the cabmans restaurant I continued accordingly to sit
upon my bench not far from the ashes of Napoleon now drowsy now
lightheaded now in complete mental obstruction or only conscious
of an animal pleasure in quiescence and now thinking planning and
remembering with unexampled clearness telling myself tales of sudden
wealth and gustfully ordering and greedily consuming imaginary meals
in the course of which I must have dropped asleep

It was towards dark that I was suddenly recalled to famine by a cold
souse of rain and sprang shivering to my feet For a moment I stood
bewildered the whole train of my reasoning and dreaming passed afresh
through my mind I was again tempted drawn as if with cords by
the image of the cabmans eatinghouse and again recoiled from the
possibility of insult Qui dort dine thought I to myself and took my
homeward way with wavering footsteps through rainy streets in which
the lamps and the shopwindows now began to gleam still marshalling
imaginary dinners as I went

Ah Monsieur Dodd said the porter there has been a registered
letter for you The facteur will bring it again tomorrow

A registered letter for me who had been so long without one Of what
it could possibly contain I had no vestige of a guess nor did I delay
myself guessing far less from any conscious plan of dishonesty the
lies flowed from me like a natural secretion

O said I my remittance at last What a bother I should have missed
it Can you lend me a hundred francs until tomorrow


I had never attempted to borrow from the porter till that moment the
registered letter was besides my warranty and he gave me what he
hadthree napoleons and some francs in silver I pocketed the money
carelessly lingered a while chaffing strolled leisurely to the door
and then fast as my trembling legs could carry me round the corner
to the Cafe de Cluny French waiters are deft and speedy they were not
deft enough for me and I had scarce decency to let the man set the wine
upon the table or put the butter alongside the bread before my glass
and my mouth were filled Exquisite bread of the Cafe Cluny exquisite
first glass of old Pomard tingling to my wet feet indescribable first
olive culled from the hors doeuvreI suppose when I come to lie
dying and the lamp begins to grow dim I shall still recall your
savour Over the rest of that meal and the rest of the evening clouds
lie thick clouds perhaps of Burgundy perhaps more properly of famine
and repletion

I remember clearly at least the shame the despair of the next
morning when I reviewed what I had done and how I had swindled the
poor honest porter and as if that were not enough fairly burnt my
ships and brought bankruptcy home to that last refuge my garret The
porter would expect his money I could not pay him here was scandal
in the house and I knew right well the cause of scandal would have to
pack What do you mean by calling my honesty in question I had cried
the day before turning upon Myner Ah that day before the day before
Waterloo the day before the Flood the day before I had sold the roof
over my head my future and my selfrespect for a dinner at the Cafe
Cluny

In the midst of these lamentations the famous registered letter came
to my door with healing under its seals It bore the postmark of
San Francisco where Pinkerton was already struggling to the neck in
multifarious affairs it renewed the offer of an allowance which his
improved estate permitted him to announce at the figure of two hundred
francs a month and in case I was in some immediate pinch it enclosed
an introductory draft for forty dollars There are a thousand excellent
reasons why a man in this selfhelpful epoch should decline to be
dependent on another but the most numerous and cogent considerations
all bow to a necessity as stern as mine and the banks were scarce open
ere the draft was cashed

It was early in December that I thus sold myself into slavery and
for six months I dragged a slowly lengthening chain of gratitude and
uneasiness At the cost of some debt I managed to excel myself and
eclipse the Genius of Muskegon in a small but highly patriotic Standard
Bearer for the Salon whither it was duly admitted where it stood the
proper length of days entirely unremarked and whence it came back to me
as patriotic as before I threw my whole soul as Pinkerton would have
phrased it into clocks and candlesticks the devil a candlestickmaker
would have anything to say to my designs Even when Dijon with his
infinite good humour and infinite scorn for all such journeywork
consented to peddle them in indiscriminately with his own the dealers
still detected and rejected mine Home they returned to me true as
the Standard Bearer who now at the head of quite a regiment of lesser
idols began to grow an eyesore in the scanty studio of my friend Dijon
and I have sat by the hour and gazed upon that company of images The
severe the frisky the classical the Louis Quinze were therefrom
Joan of Arc in her soldierly cuirass to Leda with the swan nay and
God forgive me for a man that knew better the humorous was represented
also We sat and gazed I say we criticised we turned them hither
and thither even upon the closest inspection they looked quite like
statuettes and yet nobody would have a gift of them

Vanity dies hard in some obstinate cases it outlives the man but
about the sixth month when I already owed near two hundred dollars
to Pinkerton and half as much again in debts scattered about Paris I
awoke one morning with a horrid sentiment of oppression and found I
was alone my vanity had breathed her last during the night I dared
not plunge deeper in the bog I saw no hope in my poor statuary I owned
myself beaten at last and sitting down in my nightshirt beside the
window whence I had a glimpse of the treetops at the corner of the
boulevard and where the music of its early traffic fell agreeably upon
my ear I penned my farewell to Paris to art to my whole past life
and my whole former self I give in I wrote When the next allowance
arrives I shall go straight out West where you can do what you like
with me

It is to be understood that Pinkerton had been in a sense pressing
me to come from the beginning depicting his isolation among new
acquaintances who have none of them your culture he wrote
expressing his friendship in terms so warm that it sometimes embarrassed
me to think how poorly I could echo them dwelling upon his need for
assistance and the next moment turning about to commend my resolution
and press me to remain in Paris Only remember Loudon he would
write if you ever DO tire of it theres plenty of work here for
youhonest hard wellpaid work developing the resources of this
practically virgin State And of course I neednt say what a pleasure
it would be to me if we were going at it SHOULDER TO SHOULDER I marvel
looking back that I could so long have resisted these appeals and
continue to sink my friends money in a manner that I knew him to
dislike At least when I did awake to any sense of my position I awoke
to it entirely and determined not only to follow his counsel for the
future but even as regards the past to rectify his losses For in this
juncture of affairs I called to mind that I was not without a possible
resource and resolved at whatever cost of mortification to beard the
Loudon family in their historic city

In the excellent Scots phrase I made a moonlight flitting a thing
never dignified but in my case unusually easy As I had scarce a pair
of boots worth portage I deserted the whole of my effects without
a pang Dijon fell heir to Joan of Arc the Standard Bearer and the
Musketeers He was present when I bought and frugally stocked my new
portmanteau and it was at the door of the trunk shop that I took my
leave of him for my last few hours in Paris must be spent alone It
was alone and at a far higher figure than my finances warranted that
I discussed my dinner alone that I took my ticket at Saint Lazare
all alone though in a carriage full of people that I watched the
moon shine on the Seine flood with its tufted islets on Rouen with her
spires and on the shipping in the harbour of Dieppe When the first
light of the morning called me from troubled slumbers on the deck I
beheld the dawn at first with pleasure I watched with pleasure the
green shores of England rising out of rosy haze I took the salt air
with delight into my nostrils and then all came back to me that I was
no longer an artist no longer myself that I was leaving all I cared
for and returning to all that I detested the slave of debt and
gratitude a public and a branded failure

From this picture of my own disgrace and wretchedness it is not
wonderful if my mind turned with relief to the thought of Pinkerton
waiting for me as I knew with unwearied affection and regarding me
with a respect that I had never deserved and might therefore fairly
hope that I should never forfeit The inequality of our relation struck
me rudely I must have been stupid indeed if I could have considered
the history of that friendship without shameI who had given so
little who had accepted and profited by so much I had the whole day
before me in London and I determined at least in words to set the
balance somewhat straighter Seated in the corner of a public place and
calling for sheet after sheet of paper I poured forth the expression of
my gratitude my penitence for the past my resolutions for the future
Till now I told him my course had been mere selfishness I had been
selfish to my father and to my friend taking their help and denying
them which was all they asked the poor gratification of my company and
countenance

Wonderful are the consolations of literature As soon as that letter was
written and posted the consciousness of virtue glowed in my veins like
some rare vintage




CHAPTER VI IN WHICH I GO WEST


I reached my uncles door next morning in time to sit down with the
family to breakfast More than three years had intervened almost without
mutation in that stationary household since I had sat there first a
young American freshman bewildered among unfamiliar dainties Finnan
haddock kippered salmon baps and mutton ham and had wearied my mind
in vain to guess what should be under the teacosey If there were
any change at all it seemed that I had risen in the family esteem My
fathers death once fittingly referred to with a ceremonial lengthening
of Scotch upper lips and wagging of the female head the party launched
at once God help me into the more cheerful topic of my own successes
They had been so pleased to hear such good accounts of me I was quite
a great man now where was that beautiful statue of the Genius of
Something or other You havent it here not here Really asks the
sprightliest of my cousins shaking curls at me as though it were
likely I had brought it in a cab or kept it concealed about my person
like a birthday surprise In the bosom of this family unaccustomed to
the tropical nonsense of the West it became plain the _Sunday Herald_
and poor blethering Pinkerton had been accepted for their face It is
not possible to invent a circumstance that could have more depressed
me and I am conscious that I behaved all through that breakfast like a
whipt schoolboy

At length the meal and family prayers being both happily over I
requested the favour of an interview with Uncle Adam on the state of
my affairs At sound of this ominous expression the good mans face
conspicuously lengthened and when my grandfather having had the
proposition repeated to him for he was hard of hearing announced his
intention of being present at the interview I could not but think that
Uncle Adams sorrow kindled into momentary irritation Nothing however
but the usual grim cordiality appeared upon the surface and we all
three passed ceremoniously to the adjoining library a gloomy theatre
for a depressing piece of business My grandfather charged a clay pipe
and sat tremulously smoking in a corner of the fireless chimney behind
him although the morning was both chill and dark the window was partly
open and the blind partly down I cannot depict what an air he had of
being out of place like a man shipwrecked there Uncle Adam had his
station at the business table in the midst Valuable rows of books
looked down upon the place of torture and I could hear sparrows
chirping in the garden and my sprightly cousin already banging the
piano and pouring forth an acid stream of song from the drawingroom
overhead

It was in these circumstances that with all brevity of speech and a
certain boyish sullenness of manner looking the while upon the floor
I informed my relatives of my financial situation the amount I owed
Pinkerton the hopelessness of any maintenance from sculpture the
career offered me in the States and how before becoming more beholden
to a stranger I had judged it right to lay the case before my family

I am only sorry you did not come to me at first said Uncle Adam I
take the liberty to say it would have been more decent

I think so too Uncle Adam I replied but you must bear in mind I
was ignorant in what light you might regard my application

I hope I would never turn my back on my own flesh and blood he
returned with emphasis but to my anxious ear with more of temper than
affection I could never forget you were my sisters son I regard
this as a manifest duty I have no choice but to accept the entire
responsibility of the position you have made

I did not know what else to do but murmur thank you


Yes he pursued and there is something providential in the
circumstance that you come at the right time In my old firm there is a
vacancy they call themselves Italian Warehousemen now he continued
regarding me with a twinkle of humour so you may think yourself
in luck we were only grocers in my day I shall place you there
tomorrow

Stop a moment Uncle Adam I broke in This is not at all what I
am asking I ask you to pay Pinkerton who is a poor man I ask you to
clear my feet of debt not to arrange my life or any part of it

If I wished to be harsh I might remind you that beggars cannot be
choosers said my uncle and as to managing your life you have tried
your own way already and you see what you have made of it You must now
accept the guidance of those older and whatever you may think of it
wiser than yourself All these schemes of your friend of whom I
know nothing by the by and talk of openings in the West I simply
disregard I have no idea whatever of your going trekking across
a continent on a wildgoose chase In this situation which I
am fortunately able to place at your disposal and which many a
wellconducted young man would be glad to jump at you will receive to
begin with eighteen shillings a week

Eighteen shillings a week I cried Why my poor friend gave me more
than that for nothing

And I think it is this very friend you are now trying to repay
observed my uncle with an air of one advancing a strong argument

Aadam said my grandfather

Im vexed you should be present at this business quoth Uncle Adam
swinging rather obsequiously towards the stonemason but I must remind
you it is of your own seeking

Aadam repeated the old man

Well sir I am listening says my uncle

My grandfather took a puff or two in silence and then Yere makin an
awfu poor appearance Aadam said he

My uncle visibly reared at the affront Im sorry you should think
so said he and still more sorry you should say so before present
company

A believe that A ken that Aadam returned old Loudon dryly
and the curiis thing is Im no very carin See here ma man he
continued addressing himself to me Am your grandfaither amnt I
not Never you mind what Aadam says All see justice din ye Am rich

Father said Uncle Adam I would like one word with you in private

I rose to go

Set down upon your hinderlands cried my grandfather almost savagely
If Aadam has anything to say let him say it Its me that has the
money here and by Gravy Im goin to be obeyed

Upon this scurvy encouragement it appeared that my uncle had no remark
to offer twice challenged to speak out and be done with it he twice
sullenly declined and I may mention that about this period of the
engagement I began to be sorry for him

See here then Jeannies yin resumed my grandfather Am goin to
give ye a setoff Your mither was always my favrite for A never could
agree with Aadam A like ye fine yoursel theres nae noansense aboot
ye yeve a fine nayteral idee of builders work yeve been to France
where they tell me theyre grand at the stuccy A splendid thing for
ceilins the stuccy and its a vailyable disguise too A dont
believe theres a builder in Scotland has used more stuccy than me But
as A was sayin if yell follie that trade with the capital that Am
goin to give ye ye may live yet to be as rich as mysel Ye see ye
would have always had a share of it when A was gone it appears yere
needin it now well yell get the less as is only just and proper

Uncle Adam cleared his throat This is very handsome father said he
and I am sure Loudon feels it so Very handsome and as you say very
just but will you allow me to say that it had better perhaps be put
in black and white

The enmity always smouldering between the two men at this illjudged
interruption almost burst in flame The stonemason turned upon his
offspring his long upper lip pulled down for all the world like a
monkeys He stared a while in virulent silence and then Get Gregg
said he

The effect of these words was very visible He will be gone to his
office stammered my uncle

Get Gregg repeated my grandfather

I tell you he will be gone to his office reiterated Adam

And I tell ye hes takin his smoke retorted the old man

Very well then cried my uncle getting to his feet with some
alacrity as upon a sudden change of thought I will get him myself

Ye will not cried my grandfather Ye will sit there upon your
hinderland

Then how the devil am I to get him my uncle broke forth with not
unnatural petulance

My grandfather having no possible answer grinned at his son with the
malice of a schoolboy then he rang the bell

Take the garden key said Uncle Adam to the servant go over to the
garden and if Mr Gregg the lawyer is there he generally sits under
the red hawthorn give him old Mr Loudons compliments and will he
step in here for a moment

Mr Gregg the lawyer At once I understood what had been puzzling me
the significance of my grandfather and the alarm of my poor uncle the
stonemasons will it was supposed hung trembling in the balance

Look here grandfather I said I didnt want any of this All
I wanted was a loan of say two hundred pounds I can take care
of myself I have prospects and opportunities good friends in the
States

The old man waved me down Its me that speaks here he said curtly
and we waited the coming of the lawyer in a triple silence He appeared
at last the maid ushering him ina spectacled dry but not ungenial
looking man


Here Gregg cried my grandfather Just a question What has Aadam
got to do with my will

Im afraid I dont quite understand said the lawyer staring

What has he got to do with it repeated the old man smiting with his
fist upon the arm of his chair Is my money mines or is it Aadams
Can Aadam interfere

O I see said Mr Gregg Certainly not On the marriage of both
of your children a certain sum was paid down and accepted in full of
legitim You have surely not forgotten the circumstance Mr Loudon

So that if I like concluded my grandfather hammering out his
words I can leave every doit I die possessed of to the Great
Magunnmeaning probably the Great Mogul

No doubt of it replied Gregg with a shadow of a smile

Ye hear that Aadam asked my grandfather

I may be allowed to say I had no need to hear it said my uncle

Very well says my grandfather You and Jeannies yin can go for a
bit walk Me and Gregg has business

When once I was in the hall alone with Uncle Adam I turned to him sick
at heart Uncle Adam I said you can understand better than I can
say how very painful all this is to me

Yes I am sorry you have seen your grandfather in so unamiable a
light replied this extraordinary man You shouldnt allow it
to affect your mind though He has sterling qualities quite an
extraordinary character and I have no fear but he means to behave
handsomely to you

His composure was beyond my imitation the house could not contain
me nor could I even promise to return to it in concession to which
weakness it was agreed that I should call in about an hour at the
office of the lawyer whom as he left the library Uncle Adam should
waylay and inform of the arrangement I suppose there was never a more
topsyturvy situation you would have thought it was I who had suffered
some rebuff and that ironsided Adam was a generous conqueror who
scorned to take advantage

It was plain enough that I was to be endowed to what extent and upon
what conditions I was now left for an hour to meditate in the wide
and solitary thoroughfares of the new town taking counsel with
streetcorner statues of George IV and William Pitt improving my
mind with the pictures in the window of a musicshop and renewing my
acquaintance with Edinburgh east wind By the end of the hour I made my
way to Mr Greggs office where I was placed with a few appropriate
words in possession of a cheque for two thousand pounds and a small
parcel of architectural works

Mr Loudon bids me add continued the lawyer consulting a little
sheet of notes that although these volumes are very valuable to the
practical builder you must be careful not to lose originality He tells
you also not to be hadden dounhis own expressionby the theory of
strains and that Portland cement properly sanded will go a long way

I smiled and remarked that I supposed it would

I once lived in one of my excellent clients houses observed the
lawyer and I was tempted in that case to think it had gone far
enough

Under these circumstances sir said I you will be rather relieved
to hear that I have no intention of becoming a builder

At this he fairly laughed and the ice being broken I was able to
consult him as to my conduct He insisted I must return to the house
at least for luncheon and one of my walks with Mr Loudon For the
evening I will furnish you with an excuse if you please said he by
asking you to a bachelor dinner with myself But the luncheon and the
walk are unavoidable He is an old man and I believe really fond of
you he would naturally feel aggrieved if there were any appearance of
avoiding him and as for Mr Adam do you know I think your delicacy
out of place And now Mr Dodd what are you to do with this money

Ay there was the question With two thousand poundsfifty thousand
francsI might return to Paris and the arts and be a prince and
millionaire in that thrifty Latin Quarter I think I had the grace with
one corner of my mind to be glad that I had sent the London letter I
know very well that with the rest and worst of me I repented bitterly
of that precipitate act On one point however my whole multiplex
estate of man was unanimous the letter being gone there was no help
but I must follow The money was accordingly divided in two unequal
shares for the first Mr Gregg got me a bill in the name of Dijon to
meet my liabilities in Paris for the second as I had already cash in
hand for the expenses of my journey he supplied me with drafts on San
Francisco

The rest of my business in Edinburgh not to dwell on a very agreeable
dinner with the lawyer or the horrors of the family luncheon took the
form of an excursion with the stonemason who led me this time to no
suburb or work of his old hands but with an impulse both natural and
pretty to that more enduring home which he had chosen for his clay It
was in a cemetery by some strange chance immured within the bulwarks
of a prison standing besides on the margin of a cliff crowded with
elderly stone memorials and green with turf and ivy The east wind
which I thought too harsh for the old man continually shook the
boughs and the thin sun of a Scottish summer drew their dancing
shadows

I wanted ye to see the place said he Yons the stane Euphemia
Ross that was my goodwife your grandmitherhoots Im wrong that was
my first yin I had no bairns by heryours is the second Mary Murray
Born 1819 Died 1850 thats hera fine plain decent sort of
a creature tak her athegether Alexander Loudon Born Seventeen

my name They cad me Ecky when I was a boy Eh Ecky yere an awfu
auld man

I had a second and sadder experience of graveyards at my next
alightingplace the city of Muskegon now rendered conspicuous by
the dome of the new capitol encaged in scaffolding It was late in the
afternoon when I arrived and raining and as I walked in great streets
of the very name of which I was quite ignorantdouble treble and
quadruple lines of horsecars jingling byhundredfold wires of
telegraph and telephone matting heaven above my headhuge staring
houses garish and gloomy flanking me from either handthe thought of
the Rue Racine ay and of the cabmans eatinghouse brought tears to
my eyes The whole monotonous Babel had grown or I should rather say
swelled with such a leap since my departure that I must continually
inquire my way and the very cemetery was brand new Death however had
been active the graves were already numerous and I must pick my way
in the rain among the tawdry sepulchres of millionnaires and past the
plain black crosses of Hungarian labourers till chance or instinct led
me to the place that was my fathers The stone had been erected I
knew already by admiring friends I could now judge their taste in
monuments their taste in literature methought I could imagine and I
refrained from drawing near enough to read the terms of the inscription
But the name was in larger letters and stared at meJAMES K DODD
What a singular thing is a name I thought how it clings to a man and
continually misrepresents and then survives him and it flashed across
my mind with a mixture of regret and bitter mirth that I had never
known and now probably never should know what the K had represented
King Kilter Kay Kaiser I went running over names at random and
then stumbled with ludicrous misspelling on Kornelius and had nearly
laughed aloud I have never been more childish I suppose although the
deeper voices of my nature seemed all dumb because I have never been
more moved And at this last incongruous antic of my nerves I was
seized with a panic of remorse and fled the cemetery

Scarce less funereal was the rest of my experience in Muskegon where
nevertheless I lingered visiting my fathers circle for some days It
was in piety to him I lingered and I might have spared myself the pain
His memory was already quite gone out For his sake indeed I was made
welcome and for mine the conversation rolled awhile with laborious
effort on the virtues of the deceased His former comrades dwelt in
my company upon his business talents or his generosity for public
purposes when my back was turned they remembered him no more My
father had loved me I had left him alone to live and die among the
indifferent now I returned to find him dead and buried and forgotten
Unavailing penitence translated itself in my thoughts to fresh resolve
There was another poor soul who loved me Pinkerton I must not be
guilty twice of the same error

A week perhaps had been thus wasted nor had I prepared my friend for
the delay Accordingly when I had changed trains at Council Bluffs I
was aware of a man appearing at the end of the car with a telegram in
his hand and inquiring whether there were any one aboard of the name of
LONDON Dodd I thought the name near enough claimed the despatch
and found it was from Pinkerton What day do you arrive Awfully
important I sent him an answer giving day and hour and at Ogden found
a fresh despatch awaiting me That will do Unspeakable relief Meet
you at Sacramento In Paris days I had a private name for Pinkerton
The Irrepressible was what I had called him in hours of bitterness
and the name rose once more on my lips What mischief was he up to now
What new bowl was my benignant monster brewing for his Frankenstein In
what new imbroglio should I alight on the Pacific coast My trust in
the man was entire and my distrust perfect I knew he would never
mean amiss but I was convinced he would almost never in my sense do
aright

I suppose these vague anticipations added a shade of gloom to that
already gloomy place of travel Nebraska Wyoming Utah Nevada scowled
in my face at least and seemed to point me back again to that other
native land of mine the Latin Quarter But when the Sierras had been
climbed and the train after so long beating and panting stretched
itself upon the downward trackwhen I beheld that vast extent
of prosperous country rolling seaward from the woods and the blue
mountains that illimitable spread of rippling corn the trees growing
and blowing in the merry weather the country boys thronging aboard
the train with figs and peaches and the conductors and the very
darky stewards visibly exulting in the changeup went my soul like a
balloon Care fell from his perch upon my shoulders and when I spied
my Pinkerton among the crowd at Sacramento I thought of nothing but to
shout and wave for him and grasp him by the hand like what he wasmy
dearest friend

O Loudon he cried Man how Ive pined for you And you havent come
an hour too soon Youre known here and waited for Ive been booming
you already youre billed for a lecture tomorrow night _Student
Life in Paris Grave and Gay_ twelve hundred places booked at the last
stock Tut man youre looking thin Here try a drop of this And
he produced a case bottle staringly labelled PINKERTONS THIRTEEN STAR
GOLDEN STATE BRANDY WARRANTED ENTIRE

God bless me said I gasping and winking after my first plunge into
this fiery fluid And what does Warranted Entire mean

Why Loudon you ought to know that cried Pinkerton Its real
copperbottomed English you see it on all the oldtime wayside
hostelries over there

But if Im not mistaken it means something Warranted Entirely
different said I and applies to the public house and not the
beverages sold

Its very possible said Jim quite unabashed Its effective
anyway and I can tell you sir it has boomed that spirit it goes now
by the gross of cases By the way I hope you wont mind Ive got your
portrait all over San Francisco for the lecture enlarged from that
carte de visite H Loudon Dodd the AmericoParisienne Sculptor Heres
a proof of the small handbills the posters are the same only in red
and blue and the letters fourteen by one

I looked at the handbill and my head turned What was the use of
words why seek to explain to Pinkerton the knotted horrors of
AmericoParisienne He took an early occasion to point it out as
rather a good phrase gives the two sides at a glance I wanted the
lecture written up to that Even after we had reached San Francisco
and at the actual physical shock of my own effigy placarded on the
streets I had broken forth in petulant words he never comprehended in
the least the ground of my aversion

If I had only known you disliked red lettering was as high as he
could rise You are perfectly right a clearcut black is preferable
and shows a great deal further The only thing that pains me is the
portrait I own I thought that a success Im dreadfully and truly
sorry my dear fellow I see now its not what you had a right to
expect but I did it Loudon for the best and the press is all
delighted

At the moment sweeping through green tule swamps I fell direct on the
essential But Pinkerton I cried this lecture is the maddest of
your madnesses How can I prepare a lecture in thirty hours

All done Loudon he exclaimed in triumph All ready Trust me to
pull a piece of business through Youll find it all typewritten in my
desk at home I put the best talent of San Francisco on the job Harry
Miller the brightest pressman in the city

And so he rattled on beyond reach of my modest protestations blurting
out his complicated interests crying up his new acquaintances and ever
and again hungering to introduce me to some wholesouled grand fellow
as sharp as a needle from whom and the very thought of whom my
spirit shrank instinctively

Well I was in for it in for Pinkerton in for the portrait in for the
typewritten lecture One promise I extortedthat I was never again to
be committed in ignorance even for that when I saw how its extortion
puzzled and depressed the Irrepressible my soul repented me and in all
else I suffered myself to be led uncomplaining at his chariot wheels
The Irrepressible did I say The Irresistible were nigher truth

But the time to have seen me was when I sat down to Harry Millers
lecture He was a facetious dog this Harry Miller he had a gallant way
of skirting the indecent which in my case produced physical nausea
and he could be sentimental and even melodramatic about grisettes and
starving genius I found he had enjoyed the benefit of my correspondence
with Pinkerton adventures of my own were here and there horridly
misrepresented sentiments of my own echoed and exaggerated till I
blushed to recognise them I will do Harry Miller justice he must have
had a kind of talent almost of genius all attempts to lower his
tone proving fruitless and the HarryMillerism ineradicable Nay the
monster had a certain key of style or want of style so that certain
milder passages which I sought to introduce discorded horribly and
impoverished if that were possible the general effect

By an early hour of the numbered evening I might have been observed at
the sign of the Poodle Dog dining with my agent so Pinkerton delighted
to describe himself Thence like an ox to the slaughter he led me
to the hall where I stood presently alone confronting assembled San
Francisco with no better allies than a table a glass of water and a
mass of manuscript and typework representing Harry Miller and myself
I read the lecture for I had lacked both time and will to get the trash
by heartread it hurriedly humbly and with visible shame Now and
then I would catch in the auditorium an eye of some intelligence now
and then in the manuscript would stumble on a richer vein of Harry
Miller and my heart would fail me and I gabbled The audience yawned
it stirred uneasily it muttered grumbled and broke forth at last
in articulate cries of Speak up and Nobody can hear I took to
skipping and being extremely illacquainted with the country almost
invariably cut in again in the unintelligible midst of some new topic
What struck me as extremely ominous these misfortunes were allowed to
pass without a laugh Indeed I was beginning to fear the worst and
even personal indignity when all at once the humour of the thing broke
upon me strongly I could have laughed aloud and being again summoned
to speak up I faced my patrons for the first time with a smile Very
well I said I will try though I dont suppose anybody wants to
hear and I cant see why anybody should Audience and lecturer laughed
together till the tears ran down vociferous and repeated applause
hailed my impromptu sally Another hit which I made but a little after
as I turned three pages of the copy You see I am leaving out as much
as I possibly can increased the esteem with which my patrons had begun
to regard me and when I left the stage at last my departing form was
cheered with laughter stamping shouting and the waving of hats

Pinkerton was in the waitingroom feverishly jotting in his
pocketbook As he saw me enter he sprang up and I declare the tears
were trickling on his cheeks

My dear boy he cried I can never forgive myself and you can never
forgive me Never mind I did it for the best And how nobly you clung
on I dreaded we should have had to return the money at the doors

It would have been more honest if we had said I

The pressmen followed me Harry Miller in the front ranks and I was
amazed to find them on the whole a pleasant set of lads probably
more sinned against than sinning and even Harry Miller apparently
a gentleman I had in oysters and champagnefor the receipts were
excellentand being in a high state of nervous tension kept the table
in a roar Indeed I was never in my life so well inspired as when I
described my vigil over Harry Millers literature or the series of my
emotions as I faced the audience The lads vowed I was the soul of good
company and the prince of lecturers andso wonderful an institution
is the popular pressif you had seen the notices next day in all the
papers you must have supposed my evenings entertainment an unqualified
success

I was in excellent spirits when I returned home that night but the
miserable Pinkerton sorrowed for us both

O Loudon he said I shall never forgive myself When I saw you
didnt catch on to the idea of the lecture I should have given it
myself




CHAPTER VII IRONS IN THE FIRE


Opes Strepitumque

The food of the body differs not so greatly for the fool or the sage
the elephant or the cocksparrow and similar chemical elements
variously disguised support all mortals A brief study of Pinkerton
in his new setting convinced me of a kindred truth about that other and
mental digestion by which we extract what is called fun for our money
out of life In the same spirit as a schoolboy deep in Mayne Reid
handles a dummy gun and crawls among imaginary forests Pinkerton sped
through Kearney Street upon his daily business representing to himself
a highly coloured part in lifes performance and happy for hours if
he should have chanced to brush against a millionnaire Reality was his
romance he gloried to be thus engaged he wallowed in his business
Suppose a man to dig up a galleon on the Coromandel coast his rakish
schooner keeping the while an offing under easy sail and he by the
blaze of a great fire of wreckwood to measure ingots by the bucketful
on the uproarious beach such an one might realise a greater material
spoil he should have no more profit of romance than Pinkerton when he
cast up his weekly balancesheet in a bald office Every dollar gained
was like something brought ashore from a mysterious deep every venture
made was like a divers plunge and as he thrust his bold hand into the
plexus of the moneymarket he was delightedly aware of how he shook the
pillars of existence turned out men as at a battlecry to labour
in far countries and set the gold twitching in the drawers of
millionnaires

I could never fathom the full extent of his speculations but there were
five separate businesses which he avowed and carried like a banner The
Thirteen Star Golden State Brandy Warranted Entire a very flagrant
distillation filled a great part of his thoughts and was kept before
the public in an eloquent but misleading treatise _Why Drink French
Brandy A Word to the Wise_ He kept an office for advertisers
counselling designing acting as middleman with printers and
billstickers for the inexperienced or the uninspired the dull
haberdasher came to him for ideas the smart theatrical agent for his
local knowledge and one and all departed with a copy of his pamphlet
_How When and Where or the Advertisers VadeMecum_ He had a tug
chartered every Saturday afternoon and night carried people outside the
Heads and provided them with lines and bait for six hours fishing
at the rate of five dollars a person I am told that some of
them doubtless adroit anglers made a profit on the transaction
Occasionally he bought wrecks and condemned vessels these latter I
cannot tell you how found their way to sea again under aliases and
continued to stem the waves triumphantly enough under the colours of
Bolivia or Nicaragua Lastly there was a certain agricultural engine
glorying in a great deal of vermilion and blue paint and filling it
appeared a longfelt want in which his interest was something like a
tenth

This for the face or front of his concerns On the outside as he
phrased it he was variously and mysteriously engaged No dollar slept
in his possession rather he kept all simultaneously flying like a
conjurer with oranges My own earnings when I began to have a share he
would but show me for a moment and disperse again like those illusive
money gifts which are flashed in the eyes of childhood only to be
entombed in the missionary box And he would come down radiant from a
weekly balancesheet clap me on the shoulder declare himself a winner
by Gargantuan figures and prove destitute of a quarter for a drink

What on earth have you done with it I would ask

Into the mill again all reinvested he would cry with infinite
delight Investment was ever his word He could not bear what he called
gambling Never touch stocks Loudon he would say nothing but
legitimate business And yet Heaven knows many an indurated gambler
might have drawn back appalled at the first hint of some of Pinkertons
investments One which I succeeded in tracking home and instance for
a specimen was a seventh share in the charter of a certain illstarred
schooner bound for Mexico to smuggle weapons on the one trip and
cigars upon the other The latter end of this enterprise involving as
it did shipwreck confiscation and a lawsuit with the underwriters
was too painful to be dwelt upon at length Its proved a
disappointment was as far as my friend would go with me in words but
I knew from observation that the fabric of his fortunes tottered For
the rest it was only by accident I got wind of the transaction for
Pinkerton after a time was shy of introducing me to his arcana the
reason you are to hear presently

The office which was or should have been the point of rest for so many
evolving dollars stood in the heart of the city a high and spacious
room with many plateglass windows A glazed cabinet of polished
redwood offered to the eye a regiment of some two hundred bottles
conspicuously labelled These were all charged with Pinkertons Thirteen
Star although from across the room it would have required an expert to
distinguish them from the same number of bottles of Courvoisier I used
to twit my friend with this resemblance and propose a new edition of
the pamphlet with the title thus improved _Why Drink French Brandy
when we give you the same labels_ The doors of the cabinet revolved all
day upon their hinges and if there entered any one who was a stranger
to the merits of the brand he departed laden with a bottle When I used
to protest at this extravagance My dear Loudon Pinkerton would cry
you dont seem to catch on to business principles The prime cost of
the spirit is literally nothing I couldnt find a cheaper advertisement
if I tried Against the side post of the cabinet there leaned a gaudy
umbrella preserved there as a relic It appears that when Pinkerton was
about to place Thirteen Star upon the market the rainy season was
at hand He lay dark almost in penury awaiting the first shower at
which as upon a signal the main thoroughfares became dotted with his
agents vendors of advertisements and the whole world of San Francisco
from the businessman fleeing for the ferryboat to the lady waiting
at the corner for her car sheltered itself under umbrellas with this
strange device Are you wet Try Thirteen Star It was a mammoth boom
said Pinkerton with a sigh of delighted recollection There wasnt
another umbrella to be seen I stood at this window Loudon feasting
my eyes and I declare I felt like Vanderbilt And it was to this neat
application of the local climate that he owed not only much of the sale
of Thirteen Star but the whole business of his advertising agency

The large desk to resume our survey of the office stood about the
middle kneedeep in stacks of handbills and posters of _Why Drink
French Brandy_ and _The Advertisers VadeMecum_ It was flanked upon
the one hand by two female typewriters who rested not between
the hours of nine and four and upon the other by a model of the
agricultural machine The walls where they were not broken by telephone
boxes and a couple of photographsone representing the wreck of the
James L Moody on a bold and broken coast the other the Saturday tug
alive with amateur fishersalmost disappeared under oilpaintings
gaudily framed Many of these were relics of the Latin Quarter and I
must do Pinkerton the justice to say that none of them were bad
and some had remarkable merit They went off slowly but for handsome
figures and their places were progressively supplied with the work of
local artists These last it was one of my first duties to review and
criticise Some of them were villainous yet all were saleable I said
so and the next moment saw myself the figure of a miserable renegade
bearing arms in the wrong camp I was to look at pictures thenceforward
not with the eye of the artist but the dealer and I saw the stream
widen that divided me from all I loved

Now Loudon Pinkerton had said the morning after the lecture now
Loudon we can go at it shoulder to shoulder This is what I have longed
for I wanted two heads and four arms and now I have em Youll find
its just the same as artall observation and imagination only more
movement Just wait till you begin to feel the charm

I might have waited long Perhaps I lack a sense for our whole
existence seemed to me one dreary bustle and the place we bustled in
fitly to be called the Place of Yawning I slept in a little den behind
the office Pinkerton in the office itself stretched on a patent sofa
which sometimes collapsed his slumbers still further menaced by an
imminent clock with an alarm Roused by this diabolical contrivance we
rose early went forth early to breakfast and returned by nine to what
Pinkerton called work and I distraction Masses of letters must be
opened read and answered some by me at a subsidiary desk which had
been introduced on the morning of my arrival others by my brighteyed
friend pacing the room like a caged lion as he dictated to the tinkling
typewriters Masses of wet proof had to be overhauled and scrawled upon
with a blue pencilrusticsixinch capsbold spacing hereor
sometimes terms more fervid as for instance this which I remember
Pinkerton to have spirted on the margin of an advertisement of Soothing
Syrup Throw this all down Have you never printed an advertisement
Ill be round in half an hour The ledger and salebook besides
we had always with us Such was the backbone of our occupation and
tolerable enough but the far greater proportion of our time was
consumed by visitors wholesouled grand fellows no doubt and as sharp
as a needle but to me unfortunately not diverting Some were apparently
halfwitted and must be talked over by the hour before they could reach
the humblest decision which they only left the office to return again
ten minutes later and rescind Others came with a vast show of hurry
and despatch but I observed it to be principally show The agricultural
model for instance which was practicable proved a kind of flypaper for
these busybodies I have seen them blankly turn the crank of it for five
minutes at a time simulating to nobodys deception business interest
Good thing this Pinkerton Sell much of it Ha Couldnt use it
I suppose as a medium of advertisement for my articlewhich was
perhaps toilet soap Others a still worse variety carried us to
neighbouring saloons to dice for cocktails and after the cocktails were
paid for dollars on a corner of the counter The attraction of dice for
all these people was indeed extraordinary at a certain club where I
once dined in the character of my partner Mr Dodd the dicebox came
on the table with the wine an artless substitute for afterdinner wit

Of all our visitors I believe I preferred Emperor Norton the very
mention of whose name reminds me I am doing scanty justice to the
folks of San Francisco In what other city would a harmless madman who
supposed himself emperor of the two Americas have been so fostered
and encouraged Where else would even the people of the streets have
respected the poor souls illusion Where else would bankers and
merchants have received his visits cashed his cheques and submitted to
his small assessments Where else would he have been suffered to attend
and address the exhibition days of schools and colleges where else
in Gods green earth have taken his pick of restaurants ransacked
the bill of fare and departed scathless They tell me he was even an
exacting patron threatening to withdraw his custom when dissatisfied
and I can believe it for his face wore an expression distinctly
gastronomical Pinkerton had received from this monarch a cabinet
appointment I have seen the brevet wondering mainly at the good nature
of the printer who had executed the forms and I think my friend was at
the head either of foreign affairs or education it mattered indeed
nothing the presentation being in all offices identical It was at a
comparatively early date that I saw Jim in the exercise of his public
functions His Majesty entered the officea portly rather flabby man
with the face of a gentleman rendered unspeakably pathetic and absurd
by the great sabre at his side and the peacocks feather in his hat


I have called to remind you Mr Pinkerton that you are somewhat in
arrear of taxes he said with oldfashioned stately courtesy

Well your Majesty what is the amount asked Jim and when the figure
was named it was generally two or three dollars paid upon the nail
and offered a bonus in the shape of Thirteen Star

I am always delighted to patronise native industries said Norton the
First San Francisco is publicspirited in what concerns its Emperor
and indeed sir of all my domains it is my favourite city

Come said I when he was gone I prefer that customer to the lot

Its really rather a distinction Jim admitted I think it must have
been the umbrella racket that attracted him

We were distinguished under the rose by the notice of other and greater
men There were days when Jim wore an air of unusual capacity and
resolve spoke with more brevity like one pressed for time and took
often on his tongue such phrases as Longhurst told me so this morning
or I had it straight from Longhurst himself It was no wonder I used
to think that Pinkerton was called to council with such Titans for the
creatures quickness and resource were beyond praise In the early
days when he consulted me without reserve pacing the room projecting
ciphering extending hypothetical interests trebling imaginary capital
his engine to renew an excellent old word labouring full steam
ahead I could never decide whether my sense of respect or entertainment
were the stronger But these good hours were destined to curtailment

Yes its smart enough I once observed But Pinkerton do you think
its honest

You dont think its honest he wailed O dear me that ever I should
have heard such an expression on your lips

At sight of his distress I plagiarised unblushingly from Myner You
seem to think honesty as simple as Blind Mans Buff said I Its a
more delicate affair than that delicate as any art

O well at that rate he exclaimed with complete relief Thats
casuistry

I am perfectly certain of one thing that what you propose is
dishonest I returned

Well say no more about it Thats settled he replied

Thus almost at a word my point was carried But the trouble was that
such differences continued to recur until we began to regard each other
with alarm If there were one thing Pinkerton valued himself upon it
was his honesty if there were one thing he clung to it was my
good opinion and when both were involved as was the case in these
commercial cruces the man was on the rack My own position if you
consider how much I owed him how hateful is the trade of faultfinder
and that yet I lived and fattened on these questionable operations
was perhaps equally distressing If I had been more sterling or more
combative things might have gone extremely far But in truth I was
just base enough to profit by what was not forced on my attention
rather than seek scenes Pinkerton quite cunning enough to avail himself
of my weakness and it was a relief to both when he began to involve his
proceedings in a decent mystery

Our last dispute which had a most unlookedfor consequence turned on
the refitting of condemned ships He had bought a miserable hulk and
came rubbing his hands to inform me she was already on the slip under
a new name to be repaired When first I had heard of this industry I
suppose I scarcely comprehended but much discussion had sharpened my
faculties and now my brow became heavy

I can be no party to that Pinkerton said I

He leaped like a man shot What next he cried What ails you
anyway You seem to me to dislike everything thats profitable

This ship has been condemned by Lloyds agent said I

But I tell you its a deal The ships in splendid condition
theres next to nothing wrong with her but the garboard streak and the
sternpost I tell you Lloyds is a ring like everybody else only its
an English ring and thats what deceives you If it was American you
would be crying it down all day Its Anglomania common Anglomania he
cried with growing irritation

I will not make money by risking mens lives was my ultimatum

Great Caesar isnt all speculation a risk Isnt the fairest kind of
shipowning to risk mens lives And mininghows that for risk And
look at the elevator businesstheres danger if you like Didnt I
take my risk when I bought her She might have been too far gone and
where would I have been Loudon he cried I tell you the truth
youre too full of refinement for this world

I condemn you out of your own lips I replied The fairest kind of
shipowning says you If you please let us only do the fairest kind of
business

The shot told the Irrepressible was silenced and I profited by the
chance to pour in a broadside of another sort He was all sunk in
moneygetting I pointed out he never dreamed of anything but dollars
Where were all his generous progressive sentiments Where was his
culture I asked And where was the American Type

Its true Loudon he cried striding up and down the room and
wildly scouring at his hair Youre perfectly right Im becoming
materialised O what a thing to have to say what a confession to make
Materialised Me Loudon this must go on no longer Youve been a loyal
friend to me once more give me your handyouve saved me again I
must do something to rouse the spiritual side something desperate
study something something dry and tough What shall it be Theology
Algebra Whats Algebra

Its dry and tough enough said I a squared  2ab  b squared

Its stimulating though he inquired

I told him I believed so and that it was considered fortifying to
Types

Then thats the thing for me Ill study Algebra he concluded

The next day by application to one of his typewriting women he got
word of a young lady one Miss Mamie McBride who was willing and able
to conduct him in these bloomless meadows and her circumstances
being lean and terms consequently moderate he and Mamie were soon
in agreement for two lessons in the week He took fire with unexampled
rapidity he seemed unable to tear himself away from the symbolic art
an hours lesson occupied the whole evening and the original two was
soon increased to four and then to five I bade him beware of female
blandishments The first thing you know youll be falling in love with
the algebraist said I

Dont say it even in jest he cried Shes a lady I revere I could
no more lay a hand upon her than I could upon a spirit Loudon I dont
believe God ever made a purerminded woman

Which appeared to me too fervent to be reassuring

Meanwhile I had been long expostulating with my friend upon a different
matter Im the fifth wheel I kept telling him For any use I am
I might as well be in Senegambia The letters you give me to attend
to might be answered by a sucking child And I tell you what it is
Pinkerton either youve got to find me some employment or Ill have to
start in and find it for myself

This I said with a corner of my eye in the usual quarter toward the
arts little dreaming what destiny was to provide

Ive got it Loudon Pinkerton at last replied Got the idea on the
Potrero cars Found I hadnt a pencil borrowed one from the conductor
and figured on it roughly all the way in town I saw it was the thing at
last gives you a real show All your talents and accomplishments come
in Heres a sketch advertisement Just run your eye over it Sun
Ozone and Music PINKERTONS HEBDOMADARY PICNICS Thats a good
catching phrase hebdomadary though its hard to say I made a note
of it when I was looking in the dictionary how to spell hectagonal
Well youre a boss word I said Before youre very much older Ill
have you in type as long as yourself And here it is you see Five
dollars a head and ladies free MONSTER OLIO OF ATTRACTIONS How does
that strike you Free luncheon under the greenwood tree Dance on
the elastic sward Home again in the Bright Evening Hours Manager and
Honorary Steward H Loudon Dodd Esq the wellknown connoisseur


Singular how a man runs from Scylla to Charybdis I was so intent on
securing the disappearance of a single epithet that I accepted the rest
of the advertisement and all that it involved without discussion So it
befell that the words wellknown connoisseur were deleted but that
H Loudon Dodd became manager and honorary steward of Pinkertons
Hebdomadary Picnics soon shortened by popular consent to the
Dromedary

By eight oclock any Sunday morning I was to be observed by an
admiring public on the wharf The garb and attributes of sacrifice
consisted of a black frock coat rosetted its pockets bulging with
sweetmeats and inferior cigars trousers of light blue a silk hat
like a reflector and a varnished wand A goodly steamer guarded my
one flank panting and throbbing flags fluttering fore and aft of her
illustrative of the Dromedary and patriotism My other flank was covered
by the ticketoffice strongly held by a trusty character of the Scots
persuasion rosetted like his superior and smoking a cigar to mark the
occasion festive At halfpast having assured myself that all was well
with the free luncheons I lit a cigar myself and awaited the strains
of the Pioneer Band I had never to wait longthey were German and
punctualand by a few minutes after the halfhour I would hear them
booming down street with a long military roll of drums some score of
gratuitous asses prancing at the head in bearskin hats and buckskin
aprons and conspicuous with resplendent axes The band of course
we paid for but so strong is the San Franciscan passion for public
masquerade that the asses as I say were all gratuitous pranced for
the love of it and cost us nothing but their luncheon

The musicians formed up in the bows of my steamer and struck into
a skittish polka the asses mounted guard upon the gangway and the
ticketoffice and presently after in family parties of father mother
and children in the form of duplicate lovers or in that of solitary
youth the public began to descend upon us by the carful at a time four
to six hundred perhaps with a strong German flavour and all merry as
children When these had been shepherded on board and the inevitable
belated two or three had gained the deck amidst the cheering of the
public the hawser was cast off and we plunged into the bay

And now behold the honorary steward in hour of duty and glory see me
circulate amid crowd radiating affability and laughter liberal with
my sweetmeats and cigars I say unblushing things to hobbledehoy girls
tell shy young persons this is the married peoples boat roguishly
ask the abstracted if they are thinking of their sweethearts offer
Paterfamilias a cigar am struck with the beauty and grow curious about
the age of mammas youngest who I assure her gaily will be a man
before his mother or perhaps it may occur to me from the sensible
expression of her face that she is a person of good counsel and I
ask her earnestly if she knows any particularly pleasant place on the
Saucelito or San Rafael coast for the scene of our picnic is always
supposed to be uncertain The next moment I am back at my giddy badinage
with the young ladies wakening laughter as I go and leaving in my wake
applausive comments of Isnt Mr Dodd a funny gentleman and O I
think hes just too nice

An hour having passed in this airy manner I start upon my rounds
afresh with a bag full of coloured tickets all with pins attached and
all with legible inscriptions Old Germany California True Love
Old Fogies La Belle France Green Erin The Land of Cakes
Washington Blue Jay Robin RedBreasttwenty of each
denomination for when it comes to the luncheon we sit down by
twenties These are distributed with anxious tactfor indeed this
is the most delicate part of my functionsbut outwardly with reckless
unconcern amidst the gayest flutter and confusion and are immediately
after sported upon hats and bonnets to the extreme diffusion of
cordiality total strangers hailing each other by the number of their
messso we humorously name itand the deck ringing with cries of
Here all Blue Jays to the rescue or I say am I alone in this
blame ship Aint there no more Californians

By this time we are drawing near to the appointed spot I mount upon the
bridge the observed of all observers

Captain I say in clear emphatic tones heard far and wide the
majority of the company appear to be in favour of the little cove beyond
One Tree Point

All right Mr Dodd responds the captain heartily all one to me
I am not exactly sure of the place you mean but just you stay here and
pilot me

I do pointing with my wand I do pilot him to the inexpressible
entertainment of the picnic for I am why should I deny it the
popular man We slow down off the mouth of a grassy valley watered by
a brook and set in pines and redwoods The anchor is let go the
boats are lowered two of them already packed with the materials of
an impromptu bar and the Pioneer Band accompanied by the resplendent
asses fill the other and move shoreward to the inviting strains of
Buffalo Gals wont you come out tonight It is a part of our programme
that one of the asses shall from sheer clumsiness in the course of
this embarkation drop a dummy axe into the water whereupon the mirth
of the picnic can hardly be assuaged Upon one occasion the dummy axe
floated and the laugh turned rather the wrong way

In from ten to twenty minutes the boats are alongside again the messes
are marshalled separately on the deck and the picnic goes ashore
to find the band and the impromptu bar awaiting them Then come the
hampers which are piled upon the beach and surrounded by a stern
guard of stalwart asses axe on shoulder It is here I take my place
notebook in hand under a banner bearing the legend Come here for
hampers Each hamper contains a complete outfit for a separate twenty
cold provender plates glasses knives forks and spoons an agonized
printed appeal from the fevered pen of Pinkerton pasted on the inside
of the lid beseeches that care be taken of the glass and silver Beer
wine and lemonade are flowing already from the bar and the various
clans of twenty file away into the woods with bottles under their arms
and the hampers strung upon a stick Till one they feast there in a
very moderate seclusion all being within earshot of the band From one
till four dancing takes place upon the grass the bar does a roaring
business and the honorary steward who has already exhausted himself to
bring life into the dullest of the messes must now indefatigably dance
with the plainest of the women At four a buglecall is sounded and by
halfpast behold us on board again pioneers corrugated iron bar empty
bottles and all while the honorary steward free at last subsides
into the captains cabin over a brandy and soda and a book Free at
last I say yet there remains before him the frantic leavetakings
at the pier and a sober journey up to Pinkertons office with two
policemen and the days takings in a bag

What I have here sketched was the routine But we appealed to the taste
of San Francisco more distinctly in particular fetes Ye Olde Time
PyckeNycke largely advertised in handbills beginning Oyez Oyez
and largely frequented by knights monks and cavaliers was drowned
out by unseasonable rain and returned to the city one of the saddest
spectacles I ever remember to have witnessed In pleasing contrast
and certainly our chief success was The Gathering of the Clans
or Scottish picnic So many milkwhite knees were never before
simultaneously exhibited in public and to judge by the prevalence of
Royal Stewart and the number of eagles feathers we were a highborn
company I threw forward the Scottish flank of my own ancestry and
passed muster as a clansman with applause There was indeed but one
small cloud on this redletter day I had laid in a large supply of
the national beverage in the shape of The Rob Roy MacGregor O Blend
Warranted Old and Vatted and this must certainly have been a generous
spirit for I had some anxious work between four and halfpast
conveying on board the inanimate forms of chieftains

To one of our ordinary festivities where he was the life and soul of
his own mess Pinkerton himself came incognito bringing the algebraist
on his arm Miss Mamie proved to be a wellenoughlooking mouse with
a large limpid eye very good manners and a flow of the most correct
expressions I have ever heard upon the human lip As Pinkertons
incognito was strict I had little opportunity to cultivate the ladys
acquaintance but I was informed afterwards that she considered me the
wittiest gentleman she had ever met The Lord mend your taste in wit
thought I but I cannot conceal that such was the general impression
One of my pleasantries even went the round of San Francisco and I have
heard it myself all unknown bandied in saloons To be unknown began at
last to be a rare experience a bustle woke upon my passage above all
in humble neighbourhoods Whos that one would ask and the other
would cry That Why Dromedary Dodd or with withering scorn Not
know Mr Dodd of the Picnics Well and indeed I think it marked a
rather barren destiny for our picnics if a trifle vulgar were as gay
and innocent as the age of gold I am sure no people divert themselves
so easily and so well and even with the cares of my stewardship I was
often happy to be there

Indeed there were but two drawbacks in the least considerable The
first was my terror of the hobbledehoy girls to whom from the demands
of my situation I was obliged to lay myself so open The other if less
momentous was more mortifying In early days at my mothers knee as a
man may say I had acquired the unenviable accomplishment which I have
never since been able to lose of singing _Just before the Battle_
I have what the French call a fillet of voice my best notes scarce
audible about a dinnertable and the upper register rather to be
regarded as a higher power of silence experts tell me besides that
I sing flat nor if I were the best singer in the world does _Just
before the Battle_ occur to my mature taste as the song that I would
choose to sing In spite of all which considerations at one picnic
memorably dull and after I had exhausted every other art of pleasing
I gave in desperation my one song From that hour my doom was gone
forth Either we had a chronic passenger though I could never detect
him or the very wood and iron of the steamer must have retained the
tradition At every successive picnic word went round that Mr Dodd was
a singer that Mr Dodd sang _Just before the Battle_ and finally that
now was the time when Mr Dodd sang _Just before the Battle_ so that
the thing became a fixture like the dropping of the dummy axe and you
are to conceive me Sunday after Sunday piping up my lamentable
ditty and covered when it was done with gratuitous applause It is a
beautiful trait in human nature that I was invariably offered an encore

I was well paid however even to sing Pinkerton and I after an
average Sunday had five hundred dollars to divide Nay and the picnics
were the means although indirectly of bringing me a singular windfall
This was at the end of the season after the Grand Farewell Fancy Dress
Gala Many of the hampers had suffered severely and it was judged
wiser to save storage dispose of them and lay in a fresh stock when
the campaign reopened Among my purchasers was a workingman of the
name of Speedy to whose house after several unavailing letters I
must proceed in person wondering to find myself once again on the wrong
side and playing the creditor to some one elses debtor Speedy was
in the belligerent stage of fear He could not pay It appeared he had
already resold the hampers and he defied me to do my worst I did not
like to lose my own money I hated to lose Pinkertons and the bearing
of my creditor incensed me

Do you know Mr Speedy that I can send you to the penitentiary said
I willing to read him a lesson

The dire expression was overheard in the next room A large fresh
motherly Irishwoman ran forth upon the instant and fell to besiege me
with caresses and appeals Sure now and ye couldnt have the heart to
ut Mr Dodd you thats so well known to be a pleasant gentleman and
its a pleasant face ye have and the picture of me own brother thats
dead and gone Its a truth that hes been drinking Ye can smell it off
of him more blame to him But indade and theres nothing in the
house beyont the furnicher and Thim Stock Its the stock that yell
be taking dear A sore penny it has cost me first and last and by
all tales not worth an owld tobacco pipe Thus adjured and somewhat
embarrassed by the stern attitude I had adopted I suffered myself to be
invested with a considerable quantity of what is called wildcat stock
in which this excellent if illogical female had been squandering her
hardearned gold It could scarce be said to better my position but the
step quieted the woman and on the other hand I could not think I was
taking much risk for the shares in question they were those of what I
will call the Catamount Silver Mine had fallen some time before to the
bedrock quotation and now lay perfectly inert or were only kicked
like other waste paper about the kennel of the exchange by bankrupt
speculators

A month or two after I perceived by the stocklist that Catamount
had taken a bound before afternoon thim stock were worth a quite
considerable pot of money and I learned upon inquiry that a bonanza
had been found in a condemned lead and the mine was now expected to do
wonders Remarkable to philosophers how bonanzas are found in condemned
leads and how the stock is always at freezingpoint immediately before
By some stroke of chance the Speedys had held on to the right thing
they had escaped the syndicate yet a little more if I had not come to
dun them and Mrs Speedy would have been buying a silk dress I could
not bear of course to profit by the accident and returned to
offer restitution The house was in a bustle the neighbours all
stockgamblers themselves had crowded to condole and Mrs Speedy sat
with streaming tears the centre of a sympathetic group For fifteen
year Ive been at ut she was lamenting as I entered and grudging
the babes the very milk more shame to me to pay their dhirty
assessments And now my dears I should be a lady and driving in my
coach if all had their rights and a sorrow on that man Dodd As soon
as I set eyes on him I seen the divil was in the house

It was upon these words that I made my entrance which was therefore
dramatic enough though nothing to what followed For when it appeared
that I was come to restore the lost fortune and when Mrs Speedy after
copiously weeping on my bosom had refused the restitution and when
Mr Speedy summoned to that end from a camp of the Grand Army of the
Republic had added his refusal and when I had insisted and they had
insisted and the neighbours had applauded and supported each of us in
turn and when at last it was agreed we were to hold the stock together
and share the proceeds in three partsone for me one for Mr Speedy
and one for his spouseI will leave you to conceive the enthusiasm that
reigned in that small bare apartment with the sewingmachine in the
one corner and the babes asleep in the other and pictures of Garfield
and the Battle of Gettysburg on the yellow walls Port wine was had in
by a sympathiser and we drank it mingled with tears

And I dhrink to your health my dear sobbed Mrs Speedy especially
affected by my gallantry in the matter of the third share and Im
sure we all dhrink to his healthMr Dodd of the picnics no gentleman
better known than him and its my prayer dear the good God may be
long spared to see ye in health and happiness

In the end I was the chief gainer for I sold my third while it was
worth five thousand dollars but the Speedys more adventurously held on
until the syndicate reversed the process when they were happy to escape
with perhaps a quarter of that sum It was just as well for the bulk
of the money was in Pinkertons phrase reinvested and when next I saw
Mrs Speedy she was still gorgeously dressed from the proceeds of the
late success but was already moist with tears over the new catastrophe
Were froze out me darlin All the money we had dear and the
sewingmachine and Jims uniform was in the Golden West and the
vipers has put on a new assessment

By the end of the year therefore this is how I stood I had made

 By Catamount Silver Mine 5000
 By the picnics 3000
 By the lecture 600
 By profit and loss on capital
 in Pinkertons business 1350
 
 9950

 to which must be added

 What remained of my grandfathers
 donation 8500
 
 18450

 It appears on the other hand that

 I had spent 4000
 
 Which thus left me to the good 14450

A result on which I am not ashamed to say I looked with gratitude and
pride Some eight thousand being late conquest was liquid and actually
tractile in the bank the rest whirled beyond reach and even sight save
in the mirror of a balancesheet under the compelling spell of wizard
Pinkerton Dollars of mine were tacking off the shores of Mexico in
peril of the deep and the guardacostas they rang on salooncounters
in the city of Tombstone Arizona they shone in farotents among the
mountain diggings the imagination flagged in following them so wide
were they diffused so briskly they span to the turning of the wizards
crank But here there or everywhere I could still tell myself it was
all mine and what was more convincing draw substantial dividends My
fortune I called it and it represented when expressed in dollars or
even British pounds an honest pot of money when extended into francs
a veritable fortune Perhaps I have let the cat out of the bag perhaps
you see already where my hopes were pointing and begin to blame my
inconsistency But I must first tell you my excuse and the change that
had befallen Pinkerton

About a week after the picnic to which he escorted Mamie Pinkerton
avowed the state of his affections From what I had observed on board
the steamer where methought Mamie waited on him with her limpid eyes
I encouraged the bashful lover to proceed and the very next evening he
was carrying me to call on his affianced

You must befriend her Loudon as you have always befriended me he
said pathetically

By saying disagreeable things I doubt if that be the way to a young
ladys favour I replied and since this picnicking I begin to be a
man of some experience

Yes you do nobly there I cant describe how I admire you he cried
Not that she will ever need it she has had every advantage God knows
what I have done to deserve her O man what a responsibility this is
for a rough fellow and not always truthful

Brace up old man brace up said I

But when we reached Mamies boardinghouse it was almost with tears
that he presented me Here is Loudon Mamie were his words I want
you to love him he has a grand nature

You are certainly no stranger to me Mr Dodd was her gracious
expression James is never weary of descanting on your goodness

My dear lady said I when you know our friend a little better
you will make a large allowance for his warm heart My goodness has
consisted in allowing him to feed and clothe and toil for me when he
could ill afford it If I am now alive it is to him I owe it no man
had a kinder friend You must take good care of him I added laying my
hand on his shoulder and keep him in good order for he needs it

Pinkerton was much affected by this speech and so I fear was Mamie I
admit it was a tactless performance When you know our friend a little
better was not happily said and even keep him in good order for he
needs it might be construed into matter of offence but I lay it before
you in all confidence of your acquittal was the general tone of it
patronising Even if such was the verdict of the lady I cannot but
suppose the blame was neither wholly hers nor wholly mine I cannot but
suppose that Pinkerton had already sickened the poor woman of my very
name so that if I had come with the songs of Apollo she must still
have been disgusted

Here however were two fingerposts to Paris Jim was going to be
married and so had the less need of my society I had not pleased his
bride and so was perhaps better absent Late one evening I broached
the idea to my friend It had been a great day for me I had just banked
my five thousand catamountain dollars and as Jim had refused to lay a
finger on the stock risk and profit were both wholly mine and I was
celebrating the event with stout and crackers I began by telling him
that if it caused him any pain or any anxiety about his affairs he had
but to say the word and he should hear no more of my proposal He was
the truest and best friend I ever had or was ever like to have and
it would be a strange thing if I refused him any favour he was sure
he wanted At the same time I wished him to be sure for my life was
wasting in my hands I was like one from home all my true interests
summoned me away I must remind him besides that he was now about to
marry and assume new interests and that our extreme familiarity might
be even painful to his wifeO no Loudon I feel you are wrong
there he interjected warmly she DOES appreciate your natureSo
much the better then I continued and went on to point out that our
separation need not be for long that in the way affairs were going
he might join me in two years with a fortune small indeed for the
States but in France almost conspicuous that we might unite our
resources and have one house in Paris for the winter and a second near
Fontainebleau for summer where we could be as happy as the day was
long and bring up little Pinkertons as practical artistic workmen far
from the moneyhunger of the West Let me go then I concluded not
as a deserter but as the vanguard to lead the march of the Pinkerton
men

So I argued and pleaded not without emotion my friend sitting
opposite resting his chin upon his hand and but for that single
interjection silent I have been looking for this Loudon said he
when I had done It does pain me and thats the factIm so miserably
selfish And I believe its a death blow to the picnics for its idle
to deny that you were the heart and soul of them with your wand and your
gallant bearing and wit and humour and chivalry and throwing that kind
of society atmosphere about the thing But for all that youre right
and you ought to go You may count on forty dollars a week and if Depew
Cityone of natures centres for this Statepan out the least as I
expect it may be double But its forty dollars anyway and to think
that two years ago you were almost reduced to beggary

I WAS reduced to it said I

Well the brutes gave you nothing and Im glad of it now cried Jim
Its the triumphant return I glory in Think of the master and that
coldblooded Myner too Yes just let the Depew City boom get on its
legs and you shall go and two years later day for day Ill shake
hands with you in Paris with Mamie on my arm God bless her

We talked in this vein far into the night I was myself so exultant in
my newfound liberty and Pinkerton so proud of my triumph so happy in
my happiness in so warm a glow about the gallant little woman of his
choice and the very room so filled with castles in the air and cottages
at Fontainebleau that it was little wonder if sleep fled our eyelids
and three had followed two upon the office clock before Pinkerton
unfolded the mechanism of his patent sofa




CHAPTER VIII FACES ON THE CITY FRONT


It is very much the custom to view life as if it were exactly ruled in
two like sleep and waking the provinces of play and business standing
separate The business side of my career in San Francisco has been now
disposed of I approach the chapter of diversion and it will be found
they had about an equal share in building up the story of the Wreckera
gentleman whose appearance may be presently expected

With all my occupations some six afternoons and two or three odd
evenings remained at my disposal every week a circumstance the more
agreeable as I was a stranger in a city singularly picturesque
From what I had once called myself The Amateur Parisian I grew or
declined into a waterside prowler a lingerer on wharves a frequenter
of shy neighbourhoods a scraper of acquaintance with eccentric
characters I visited Chinese and Mexican gamblinghells German secret
societies sailors boardinghouses and dives of every complexion of
the disreputable and dangerous I have seen greasy Mexican hands pinned
to the table with a knife for cheating seamen when bloodmoney ran
high knocked down upon the public street and carried insensible on
board shorthanded ships shots exchanged and the smoke and the
company dispersing from the doors of the saloon I have heard
coldminded Polacks debate upon the readiest method of burning San
Francisco to the ground hotheaded working men and women bawl and swear
in the tribune at the Sandlot and Kearney himself open his subscription
for a gallows name the manufacturers who were to grace it with their
dangling bodies and read aloud to the delighted multitude a telegram of
adhesion from a member of the State legislature all which preparations
of proletarian war were in a moment breathed upon and abolished by the
mere name and fame of Mr Coleman That lion of the Vigilantes had but
to rouse himself and shake his ears and the whole brawling mob was
silenced I could not but reflect what a strange manner of man this was
to be living unremarked there as a private merchant and to be so
feared by a whole city and if I was disappointed in my character of
lookeron to have the matter end ingloriously without the firing of a
shot or the hanging of a single millionnaire philosophy tried to tell
me that this sight was truly the more picturesque In a thousand towns
and different epochs I might have had occasion to behold the cowardice
and carnage of street fighting where else but only there and then
could I have enjoyed a view of Coleman the intermittent despot walking
meditatively up hill in a quiet part of town with a very rolling gait
and slapping gently his great thigh

Minora Canamus This historic figure stalks silently through a corner
of the San Francisco of my memory the rest is bricabrac the
reminiscences of a vagrant sketcher My delight was much in slums
Little Italy was a haunt of mine there I would look in at the windows
of small eatingshops transported bodily from Genoa or Naples with
their macaroni and chianti flasks and portraits of Garibaldi and
coloured political caricatures or entering in hold high debate with
some earringed fisher of the bay as to the designs of Mr Owstria and
Mr Rooshia I was often to be observed had there been any to observe
me in that dispeopled hillside solitude of Little Mexico with its
crazy wooden houses endless crazy wooden stairs and perilous mountain
goatpaths in the sand Chinatown by a thousand eccentricities drew
and held me I could never have enough of its ambiguous interracial
atmosphere as of a vitalised museum never wonder enough at its
outlandish necromanticlooking vegetables set forth to sell in
commonplace American shopwindows its temple doors open and the scent
of the jossstick streaming forth on the American air its kites of
Oriental fashion hanging fouled in Western telegraphwires its flights
of paper prayers which the tradewind hunts and dissipates along
Western gutters I was a frequent wanderer on North Beach gazing at
the straits and the huge CapeHorners creeping out to sea and imminent
Tamalpais Thence on my homeward way I might visit that strange and
filthy shed earthpaved and walled with the cages of wild animals and
birds where at a ramshackle counter amid the yells of monkeys and a
poignant atmosphere of menagerie fortyrod whiskey was administered by
a proprietor as dirty as his beasts Nor did I even neglect Nob
Hill which is itself a kind of slum being the habitat of the mere
millionnaire There they dwell upon the hilltop high raised above
mans clamour and the tradewind blows between their palaces about
deserted streets

But San Francisco is not herself only She is not only the most
interesting city in the Union and the hugest smeltingpot of races and
the precious metals She keeps besides the doors of the Pacific and
is the port of entry to another world and an earlier epoch in mans
history Nowhere else shall you observe in the ancient phrase so many
tall ships as here convene from round the Horn from China from Sydney
and the Indies but scarce remarked amid that crowd of deepsea giants
another class of craft the Island schooner circulates low in the
water with lofty spars and dainty lines rigged and fashioned like
a yacht manned with brownskinned softspoken sweeteyed native
sailors and equipped with their great doubleender boats that tell a
tale of boisterous seabeaches These steal out and in again unnoted by
the world or even the newspaper press save for the line in the clearing
column Schooner Soandso for Yap and South Sea Islandssteal out
with nondescript cargoes of tinned salmon gin bolts of gaudy cotton
stuff womens hats and Waterbury watches to return after a year
piled as high as to the eaves of the house with copra or wallowing
deep with the shells of the tortoise or the pearl oyster To me in my
character of the Amateur Parisian this island traffic and even the
island world were beyond the bounds of curiosity and how much more of
knowledge I stood there on the extreme shore of the West and of today
Seventeen hundred years ago and seven thousand miles to the east
a legionary stood perhaps upon the wall of Antoninus and looked
northward toward the mountains of the Picts For all the interval of
time and space I when I looked from the cliffhouse on the broad
Pacific was that mans heir and analogue each of us standing on the
verge of the Roman Empire or as we now call it Western civilization
each of us gazing onward into zones unromanised But I was dull I
looked rather backward keeping a kind eye on Paris and it required a
series of converging incidents to change my attitude of nonchalance for
one of interest and even longing which I little dreamed that I should
live to gratify

The first of these incidents brought me in acquaintance with a certain
San Francisco character who had something of a name beyond the limits
of the city and was known to many lovers of good English I had
discovered a new slum a place of precarious sandy cliffs deep sandy
cuttings solitary ancient houses and the buttends of streets It was
already environed The ranks of the streetlamps threaded it unbroken
The city upon all sides of it was tightly packed and growled with
traffic Today I do not doubt the very landmarks are all swept away
but it offered then within narrow limits a delightful peace and in
the morning when I chiefly went there a seclusion almost rural On a
steep sandhill in this neighbourhood toppled on the most insecure
foundation a certain row of houses each with a bit of garden and all
I have to presume inhabited Thither I used to mount by a crumbling
footpath and in front of the last of the houses would sit down to
sketch The very first day I saw I was observed out of the groundfloor
window by a youngish goodlooking fellow prematurely bald and with
an expression both lively and engaging The second as we were still
the only figures in the landscape it was no more than natural that
we should nod The third he came out fairly from his intrenchments
praised my sketch and with the impromptu cordiality of artists carried
me into his apartment where I sat presently in the midst of a museum of
strange objectspaddles and battleclubs and baskets roughhewn stone
images ornaments of threaded shell cocoanut bowls snowy cocoanut
plumesevidences and examples of another earth another climate
another race and another if a ruder culture Nor did these objects
lack a fitting commentary in the conversation of my new acquaintance
Doubtless you have read his book You know already how he tramped and
starved and had so fine a profit of living in his days among the
islands and meeting him as I did one artist with another after
months of offices and picnics you can imagine with what charm he would
speak and with what pleasure I would hear It was in such talks which
we were both eager to repeat that I first heard the namesfirst fell
under the spellof the islands and it was from one of the first of
them that I returned a happy man with _Omoo_ under one arm and my
friends own adventures under the other

The second incident was more dramatic and had besides a bearing on
my future I was standing one day near a boatlanding under Telegraph
Hill A large barque perhaps of eighteen hundred tons was coming more
than usually close about the point to reach her moorings and I was
observing her with languid inattention when I observed two men to
stride across the bulwarks drop into a shore boat and violently
dispossessing the boatman of his oars pull toward the landing where I
stood In a surprisingly short time they came tearing up the steps and
I could see that both were too well dressed to be foremast handsthe
first even with research and both and specially the first appeared
under the empire of some strong emotion

Nearest police office cried the leader

This way said I immediately falling in with their precipitate pace
Whats wrong What ship is that

Thats the Gleaner he replied I am chief officer this gentlemans
third and weve to get in our depositions before the crew You see they
might corral us with the captain and thats no kind of berth for me
Ive sailed with some hard cases in my time and seen pins flying like
sand on a squally daybut never a match to our old man It never let
up from the Hook to the Farallones and the last man was dropped not
sixteen hours ago Packet rats our men were and as tough a crowd as
ever sandbagged a mans head in but they looked sick enough when the
captain started in with his fancy shooting

O hes done up observed the other He wont go to sea no more

You make me tired retorted his superior If he gets ashore in one
piece and isnt lynched in the next ten minutes hell do yet The
owners have a longer memory than the public theyll stand by him they
dont find as smart a captain every day in the year

O hes a son of a gun of a fine captain there aint no doubt of
that concurred the other heartily Why I dont suppose theres been
no wages paid aboard that Gleaner for three trips

No wages I exclaimed for I was still a novice in maritime affairs

Not to sailormen before the mast agreed the mate Men cleared out
wasnt the soft job they maybe took it for She isn the first ship that
never paid wages

I could not but observe that our pace was progressively relaxing and
indeed I have often wondered since whether the hurry of the start were
not intended for the gallery alone Certain it is at least that when we
had reached the police office and the mates had made their deposition
and told their horrid tale of five men murdered some with savage
passion some with cold brutality between Sandy Hook and San Francisco
the police were despatched in time to be too late Before we arrived
the ruffian had slipped out upon the dock had mingled with the crowd
and found a refuge in the house of an acquaintance and the ship was
only tenanted by his late victims Well for him that he had been
thus speedy For when word began to go abroad among the shoreside
characters when the last victim was carried by to the hospital when
those who had escaped as by miracle from that floating shambles
began to circulate and show their wounds in the crowd it was strange
to witness the agitation that seized and shook that portion of the
city Men shed tears in public bosses of lodginghouses long inured
to brutality and above all brutality to sailors shook their fists at
heaven if hands could have been laid on the captain of the Gleaner
his shrift would have been short That night so gossip reports he was
headed up in a barrel and smuggled across the bay in two ships already
he had braved the penitentiary and the gallows and yet by last
accounts he now commands another on the Western Ocean

As I have said I was never quite certain whether Mr Nares the mate
did not intend that his superior should escape It would have been like
his preference of loyalty to law it would have been like his prejudice
which was all in favour of the afterguard But it must remain a matter
of conjecture only Well as I came to know him in the sequel he was
never communicative on that point nor indeed on any that concerned the
voyage of the Gleaner Doubtless he had some reason for his reticence
Even during our walk to the police office he debated several times with
Johnson the third officer whether he ought not to give up himself as
well as to denounce the captain He had decided in the negative arguing
that it would probably come to nothing and even if there was a stink
he had plenty good friends in San Francisco And to nothing it came
though it must have very nearly come to something for Mr Nares
disappeared immediately from view and was scarce less closely hidden
than his captain

Johnson on the other hand I often met I could never learn this mans
country and though he himself claimed to be American neither his
English nor his education warranted the claim In all likelihood he
was of Scandinavian birth and blood long pickled in the forecastles
of English and American ships It is possible that like so many of his
race in similar positions he had already lost his native tongue In
mind at least he was quite denationalised thought only in Englishto
call it so and though by nature one of the mildest kindest and most
feebly playful of mankind he had been so long accustomed to the cruelty
of sea discipline that his stories told perhaps with a giggle would
sometimes turn me chill In appearance he was tall light of weight
bold and highbred of feature duskyhaired and with a face of a clean
even brown the ornament of outdoor men Seated in a chair you might
have passed him off for a baronet or a military officer but let him
rise and it was Focsle Jack that came rolling toward you crablike
let him but open his lips and it was Focsle Jack that piped and
drawled his ungrammatical gibberish He had sailed among other
places much among the islands and after a Cape Horn passage with
its snowsqualls and its frozen sheets he announced his intention of
taking a turn among them Kanakas I thought I should have lost him
soon but according to the unwritten usage of mariners he had first to
dissipate his wages Guess Ill have to paint this town red was his
hyperbolical expression for sure no man ever embarked upon a milder
course of dissipation most of his days being passed in the little
parlour behind Black Toms public house with a select corps of old
particular acquaintances all from the South Seas and all patrons of a
long yarn a short pipe and glasses round

Black Toms to the front presented the appearance of a fourthrate
saloon devoted to Kanaka seamen dirt negrohead tobacco bad cigars
worse gin and guitars and banjos in a state of decline The proprietor
a powerful coloured man was at once a publican a ward politician
leader of some brigade of lambs or smashers at the wind of whose
clubs the party bosses and the mayor were supposed to tremble and what
hurt nothing an active and reliable crimp His front quarters
then were noisy disreputable and not even safe I have seen worse
frequented saloons where there were fewer scandals for Tom was often
drunk himself and there is no doubt the Lambs must have been a useful
body or the place would have been closed I remember one day not long
before an election seeing a blind man very well dressed led up to the
counter and remain a long while in consultation with the negro The pair
looked so illassorted and the awe with which the drinkers fell back
and left them in the midst of an impromptu privacy was so unusual in
such a place that I turned to my next neighbour with a question He
told me the blind man was a distinguished party boss called by some
the King of San Francisco but perhaps better known by his picturesque
Chinese nickname of the Blind White Devil The Lambs must be wanted
pretty bad I guess my informant added I have here a sketch of the
Blind White Devil leaning on the counter on the next page and taken
the same hour a jotting of Black Tom threatening a whole crowd of
customers with a long Smith and Wesson to such heights and depths we
rose and fell in the front parts of the saloon


Meanwhile away in the back quarters sat the small informal South Sea
club talking of another world and surely of a different century Old
schooner captains they were old South Sea traders cooks and mates
fine creatures softened by residence among a softer race full men
besides though not by reading but by strange experience and for days
together I could hear their yarns with an unfading pleasure All had
indeed some touch of the poetic for the beachcomber when not a mere
ruffian is the poor relation of the artist Even through Johnsons
inarticulate speech his O yes there aint no harm in them Kanakas
or O yes thats a son of a gun of a fine island mountainious right
down I didnt never ought to have left that island there pierced a
certain gusto of appreciation and some of the rest were mastertalkers
From their long tales their traits of character and unpremeditated
landscape there began to piece itself together in my head some image
of the islands and the island life precipitous shores spired mountain
tops the deep shade of hanging forests the unresting surf upon the
reef and the unending peace of the lagoon sun moon and stars of an
imperial brightness man moving in these scenes scarce fallen and woman
lovelier than Eve the primal curse abrogated the bed made ready for
the stranger life set to perpetual music and the guest welcomed the
boat urged and the long night beguiled with poetry and choral song A
man must have been an unsuccessful artist he must have starved on the
streets of Paris he must have been yoked to a commercial force like
Pinkerton before he can conceive the longings that at times assailed
me The draughty rowdy city of San Francisco the bustling office where
my friend Jim paced like a caged lion daily between ten and four even
at times the retrospect of Paris faded in comparison Many a man less
tempted would have thrown up all to realise his visions but I was by
nature unadventurous and uninitiative to divert me from all former
paths and send me cruising through the isles of paradise some force
external to myself must be exerted Destiny herself must use the fitting
wedge and little as I deemed it that tool was already in her hand of
brass

I sat one afternoon in the corner of a great glassy silvered saloon
a free lunch at my one elbow at the other a conscientious nude from
the brush of local talent when with the tramp of feet and a sudden
buzz of voices the swingdoors were flung broadly open and the place
carried as by storm The crowd which thus entered mostly seafaring
men and all prodigiously excited contained a sort of kernel or general
centre of interest which the rest merely surrounded and advertised as
children in the Old World surround and escort the PunchandJudy man
the word went round the bar like wildfire that these were Captain
Trent and the survivors of the British brig Flying Scud picked up by a
British warship on Midway Island arrived that morning in San Francisco
Bay and now fresh from making the necessary declarations Presently I
had a good sight of them four brown seamanlike fellows standing by
the counter glass in hand the centre of a score of questioners
One was a Kanakathe cook I was informed one carried a cage with a
canary which occasionally trilled into thin song one had his left arm
in a sling and looked gentlemanlike and somewhat sickly as though
the injury had been severe and he was scarce recovered and the captain
himselfa redfaced blueeyed thickset man of five and fortywore
a bandage on his right hand The incident struck me I was struck
particularly to see captain cook and foremost hands walking the street
and visiting saloons in company and as when anything impressed me
I got my sketchbook out and began to steal a sketch of the four
castaways The crowd sympathising with my design made a clear lane
across the room and I was thus enabled all unobserved myself to
observe with a stillgrowing closeness the face and the demeanour of
Captain Trent

Warmed by whiskey and encouraged by the eagerness of the bystanders
that gentleman was now rehearsing the history of his misfortune It was
but scraps that reached me how he filled her on the starboard tack
and how it came up sudden out of the nornorwest and there she was
high and dry Sometimes he would appeal to one of the menThat was
how it was Jackand the man would reply That was the way of it
Captain Trent Lastly he started a fresh tide of popular sympathy by
enunciating the sentiment Damn all these Admirality Charts and thats
what I say From the nodding of heads and the murmurs of assent that
followed I could see that Captain Trent had established himself in the
public mind as a gentleman and a thorough navigator about which period
my sketch of the four men and the canarybird being finished and all
especially the canarybird excellent likenesses I buckled up my book
and slipped from the saloon

Little did I suppose that I was leaving Act I Scene I of the drama of
my life and yet the scene or rather the captains face lingered for
some time in my memory I was no prophet as I say but I was something
else I was an observer and one thing I knew I knew when a man was
terrified Captain Trent of the British brig Flying Scud had been
glib he had been ready he had been loud but in his blue eyes I could
detect the chill and in the lines of his countenance spy the agitation
of perpetual terror Was he trembling for his certificate In my
judgment it was some livelier kind of fear that thrilled in the mans
marrow as he turned to drink Was it the result of recent shock and had
he not yet recovered the disaster to his brig I remembered how a friend
of mine had been in a railway accident and shook and started for a
month and although Captain Trent of the Flying Scud had none of the
appearance of a nervous man I told myself with incomplete conviction
that his must be a similar case




CHAPTER IX THE WRECK OF THE FLYING SCUD


The next morning I found Pinkerton who had risen before me seated at
our usual table and deep in the perusal of what I will call the _Daily
Occidental_ This was a paper I know not if it be so still that stood
out alone among its brethren in the West the others down to their
smallest item were defaced with capitals headlines alliterations
swaggering misquotations and the shoddy picturesque and unpathetic
pathos of the Harry Millers the _Occidental_ alone appeared to be
written by a dull sane Christian gentleman singly desirous of
communicating knowledge It had not only this merit which endeared it
to me but was admittedly the best informed on business matters which
attracted Pinkerton

Loudon said he looking up from the journal you sometimes think I
have too many irons in the fire My notion on the other hand is when
you see a dollar lying pick it up Well here Ive tumbled over a whole
pile of em on a reef in the middle of the Pacific

Why Jim you miserable fellow I exclaimed havent we Depew City
one of Gods green centres for this State havent we

Just listen to this interrupted Jim Its miserable copy these
_Occidental_ reporter fellows have no fire but the facts are right
enough I guess And he began to read

WRECK OF THE BRITISH BRIG FLYING SCUD

HBMS Tempest which arrived yesterday at this port brings Captain
Trent and four men of the British brig Flying Scud cast away February
12th on Midway Island and most providentially rescued the next day The
Flying Scud was of 200 tons burthen owned in London and has been out
nearly two years tramping Captain Trent left Hong Kong December 8th
bound for this port in rice and a small mixed cargo of silks teas and
China notions the whole valued at 10000 fully covered by insurance
The log shows plenty of fine weather with light airs calms and
squalls In lat 28 N long 177 W his water going rotten and misled
by Hoyts _North Pacific Directory_ which informed him there was a
coaling station on the island Captain Trent put in to Midway Island
He found it a literal sandbank surrounded by a coral reef mostly
submerged Birds were very plenty there was good fish in the lagoon
but no firewood and the water which could be obtained by digging
brackish He found good holdingground off the north end of the larger
bank in fifteen fathoms water bottom sandy with coral patches Here he
was detained seven days by a calm the crew suffering severely from the
water which was gone quite bad and it was only on the evening of the
12th that a little wind sprang up coming puffy out of NNE Late as
it was Captain Trent immediately weighed anchor and attempted to get
out While the vessel was beating up to the passage the wind took a
sudden lull and then veered squally into N and even NNW driving
the brig ashore on the sand at about twenty minutes before six oclock
John Wallen a native of Finland and Charles Holdorsen a native of
Sweden were drowned alongside in attempting to lower a boat neither
being able to swim the squall very dark and the noise of the breakers
drowning everything At the same time John Brown another of the crew
had his arm broken by the falls Captain Trent further informed the
OCCIDENTAL reporter that the brig struck heavily at first bows on he
supposes upon coral that she then drove over the obstacle and now
lies in sand much down by the head and with a list to starboard In the
first collision she must have sustained some damage as she was making
water forward The rice will probably be all destroyed but the more
valuable part of the cargo is fortunately in the afterhold Captain
Trent was preparing his longboat for sea when the providential arrival
of the Tempest pursuant to Admiralty orders to call at islands in her
course for castaways saved the gallant captain from all further danger
It is scarcely necessary to add that both the officers and men of the
unfortunate vessel speak in high terms of the kindness they received
on board the manofwar We print a list of the survivors Jacob
Trent master of Hull England Elias Goddedaal mate native of
Christiansand Sweden Ah Wing cook native of Sana China John Brown
native of Glasgow Scotland John Hardy native of London England
The Flying Scud is ten years old and this morning will be sold as she
stands by order of Lloyds agent at public auction for the benefit of
the underwriters The auction will take place in the Merchants Exchange
at ten oclock

Farther ParticularsLater in the afternoon the OCCIDENTAL reporter
found Lieutenant Sebright first officer of HBMS Tempest at the
Palace Hotel The gallant officer was somewhat pressed for time but
confirmed the account given by Captain Trent in all particulars He
added that the Flying Scud is in an excellent berth and except in the
highly improbable event of a heavy NW gale might last until next
winter

You will never know anything of literature said I when Jim had
finished That is a good honest plain piece of work and tells the
story clearly I see only one mistake the cook is not a Chinaman he is
a Kanaka and I think a Hawaiian

Why how do you know that asked Jim

I saw the whole gang yesterday in a saloon said I I even heard the
tale or might have heard it from Captain Trent himself who struck me
as thirsty and nervous

Well thats neither here nor there cried Pinkerton The point is
how about these dollars lying on a reef

Will it pay I asked

Pay like a sugar trust exclaimed Pinkerton Dont you see what this
British officer says about the safety Dont you see the cargos valued
at ten thousand Schooners are begging just now I can get my pick of
them at two hundred and fifty a month and how does that foot up It
looks like three hundred per cent to me

You forget I objected the captain himself declares the rice is
damaged


Thats a point I know admitted Jim But the rice is the sluggish
article anyway its little more account than ballast its the tea
and silks that I look to all we have to find is the proportion and one
look at the manifest will settle that Ive rung up Lloyds on purpose
the captain is to meet me there in an hour and then Ill be as posted
on that brig as if I built her Besides youve no idea what pickings
there are about a wreckcopper lead rigging anchors chains even
the crockery Loudon

You seem to me to forget one trifle said I Before you pick that
wreck youve got to buy her and how much will she cost

One hundred dollars replied Jim with the promptitude of an
automaton

How on earth do you guess that I cried

I dont guess I know it answered the Commercial Force My dear boy
I may be a galoot about literature but youll always be an outsider in
business How do you suppose I bought the James L Moody for two hundred
and fifty her boats alone worth four times the money Because my name
stood first in the list Well it stands there again I have the naming
of the figure and I name a small one because of the distance but it
wouldnt matter what I named that would be the price

It sounds mysterious enough said I Is this public auction
conducted in a subterranean vault Could a plain citizenmyself for
instancecome and see

O everythings open and above board he cried indignantly Anybody
can come only nobody bids against us and if he did he would get
frozen out Its been tried before now and once was enough We hold
the plant weve got the connection we can afford to go higher than
any outsider theres two million dollars in the ring and we stick at
nothing Or suppose anybody did buy over our headI tell you Loudon
he would think this town gone crazy he could no more get business
through on the city front than I can dance schooners divers menall
he wantedthe prices would fly right up and strike him

But how did you get in I asked You were once an outsider like your
neighbours I suppose

I took hold of that thing Loudon and just studied it up he replied
It took my fancy it was so romantic and then I saw there was boodle
in the thing and I figured on the business till no man alive could give
me points Nobody knew I had an eye on wrecks till one fine morning I
dropped in upon Douglas B Longhurst in his den gave him all the facts
and figures and put it to him straight Do you want me in this ring
or shall I start another He took half an hour and when I came back
Pink says he Ive put your name on The first time I came to the
top it was that Moody racket now its the Flying Scud

Whereupon Pinkerton looking at his watch uttered an exclamation
made a hasty appointment with myself for the doors of the Merchants
Exchange and fled to examine manifests and interview the skipper I
finished my cigarette with the deliberation of a man at the end of many
picnics reflecting to myself that of all forms of the dollar hunt this
wrecking had by far the most address to my imagination Even as I went
down town in the brisk bustle and chill of the familiar San Francisco
thoroughfares I was haunted by a vision of the wreck baking so far
away in the strong sun under a cloud of seabirds and even then and
for no better reason my heart inclined towards the adventure If not
myself something that was mine some one at least in my employment
should voyage to that oceanbounded pinpoint and descend to that
deserted cabin

Pinkerton met me at the appointed moment pinched of lip and more than
usually erect of bearing like one conscious of great resolves

Well I asked

Well said he it might be better and it might be worse This
Captain Trent is a remarkably honest fellowone out of a thousand As
soon as he knew I was in the market he owned up about the rice in so
many words By his calculation if theres thirty mats of it saved its
an outside figure However the manifest was cheerier Theres about
five thousand dollars of the whole value in silks and teas and nutoils
and that all in the lazarette and as safe as if it was in Kearney
Street The brig was new coppered a year ago Theres upwards of a
hundred and fifty fathom awayup chain Its not a bonanza but theres
boodle in it and well try it on


It was by that time hard on ten oclock and we turned at once into
the place of sale The Flying Scud although so important to ourselves
appeared to attract a very humble share of popular attention The
auctioneer was surrounded by perhaps a score of lookerson big fellows
for the most part of the true Western build long in the leg broad in
the shoulder and adorned to a plain mans taste with needless finery
A jaunty ostentatious comradeship prevailed Bets were flying and
nicknames The boys as they would have called themselves were very
boyish and it was plain they were here in mirth and not on business
Behind and certainly in strong contrast to these gentlemen I could
detect the figure of my friend Captain Trent come as I could very well
imagine that a captain would to hear the last of his old vessel Since
yesterday he had rigged himself anew in readymade black clothes not
very aptly fitted the upper lefthand pocket showing a corner of
silk handkerchief the lower on the other side bulging with papers
Pinkerton had just given this man a high character Certainly he
seemed to have been very frank and I looked at him again to trace if
possible that virtue in his face It was red and broad and flustered
and I thought false The whole man looked sick with some unknown
anxiety and as he stood there unconscious of my observation he tore
at his nails scowled on the floor or glanced suddenly sharply and
fearfully at passersby I was still gazing at the man in a kind of
fascination when the sale began

Some preliminaries were rattled through to the irreverent
uninterrupted gambolling of the boys and then amid a trifle more
attention the auctioneer sounded for some two or three minutes the pipe
of the charmer Fine brignew coppervaluable fittingsthree fine
boatsremarkably choice cargowhat the auctioneer would call a
perfectly safe investment nay gentlemen he would go further he would
put a figure on it he had no hesitation had that bold auctioneer in
putting it in figures and in his view what with this and that and one
thing and another the purchaser might expect to clear a sum equal to
the entire estimated value of the cargo or gentlemen in other words
a sum of ten thousand dollars At this modest computation the
roof immediately above the speakers head I suppose through the
intervention of a spectator of ventriloquial tastes uttered a clear
Cockadoodledoowhereat all laughed the auctioneer himself
obligingly joining

Now gentlemen what shall we say resumed that gentleman plainly
ogling Pinkertonwhat shall we say for this remarkable opportunity

One hundred dollars said Pinkerton

One hundred dollars from Mr Pinkerton went the auctioneer one
hundred dollars No other gentleman inclined to make any advance One
hundred dollars only one hundred dollars

The auctioneer was droning on to some such tune as this and I on my
part was watching with something between sympathy and amazement the
undisguised emotion of Captain Trent when we were all startled by the
interjection of a bid

And fifty said a sharp voice

Pinkerton the auctioneer and the boys who were all equally in the
open secret of the ring were now all equally and simultaneously taken
aback

I beg your pardon said the auctioneer Anybody bid

And fifty reiterated the voice which I was now able to trace to
its origin on the lips of a small unseemly rag of humankind The
speakers skin was gray and blotched he spoke in a kind of broken song
with much variety of key his gestures seemed as in the disease called
Saint Vituss dance to be imperfectly under control he was badly
dressed he carried himself with an air of shrinking assumption as
though he were proud to be where he was and to do what he was doing
and yet half expected to be called in question and kicked out I think I
never saw a man more of a piece and the type was new to me I had never
before set eyes upon his parallel and I thought instinctively of Balzac
and the lower regions of the _Comedie Humaine_

Pinkerton stared a moment on the intruder with no friendly eye tore
a leaf from his notebook and scribbled a line in pencil turned
beckoned a messenger boy and whispered To Longhurst Next moment
the boy had sped upon his errand and Pinkerton was again facing the
auctioneer

Two hundred dollars said Jim

And fifty said the enemy


This looks lively whispered I to Pinkerton

Yes the little beast means cold drawn biz returned my friend Well
hell have to have a lesson Wait till I see Longhurst Three hundred
he added aloud

And fifty came the echo

It was about this moment when my eye fell again on Captain Trent
A deeper shade had mounted to his crimson face the new coat was
unbuttoned and all flying open the new silk handkerchief in busy
requisition and the mans eye of a clear sailor blue shone glassy
with excitement He was anxious still but now if I could read a face
there was hope in his anxiety

Jim I whispered look at Trent Bet you what you please he was
expecting this

Yes was the reply theres some blame thing going on here And he
renewed his bid

The figure had run up into the neighbourhood of a thousand when I
was aware of a sensation in the faces opposite and looking over my
shoulder saw a very large bland handsome man come strolling forth and
make a little signal to the auctioneer

One word Mr Borden said he and then to Jim Well Pink where are
we up to now

Pinkerton gave him the figure I ran up to that on my own
responsibility Mr Longhurst he added with a flush I thought it
the square thing

And so it was said Mr Longhurst patting him kindly on the shoulder
like a gratified uncle Well you can drop out now we take hold
ourselves You can run it up to five thousand and if he likes to go
beyond that hes welcome to the bargain

By the by who is he asked Pinkerton He looks away down

Ive sent Billy to find out And at the very moment Mr Longhurst
received from the hands of one of the expensive young gentlemen a folded
paper It was passed round from one to another till it came to me and I
read Harry D Bellairs AttorneyatLaw defended Clara Varden twice
nearly disbarred

Well that gets me observed Mr Longhurst Who can have put up a
shyster 1 like that Nobody with money thats a sure thing Suppose
you tried a big bluff I think I would Pink Well tata Your partner
Mr Dodd Happy to have the pleasure of your acquaintance sir And the
great man withdrew

1 A low lawyer

Well what do you think of Douglas B whispered Pinkerton looking
reverently after him as he departed Six foot of perfect gentleman and
culture to his boots

During this interview the auction had stood transparently arrested the
auctioneer the spectators and even Bellairs all well aware that Mr
Longhurst was the principal and Jim but a speakingtrumpet But now
that the Olympian Jupiter was gone Mr Borden thought proper to affect
severity

Come come Mr Pinkerton Any advance he snapped

And Pinkerton resolved on the big bluff replied Two thousand
dollars

Bellairs preserved his composure And fifty said he But there was a
stir among the onlookers and what was of more importance Captain Trent
had turned pale and visibly gulped

Pitch it in again Jim said I Trent is weakening

Three thousand said Jim

And fifty said Bellairs

And then the bidding returned to its original movement by hundreds and
fifties but I had been able in the meanwhile to draw two conclusions
In the first place Bellairs had made his last advance with a smile of
gratified vanity and I could see the creature was glorying in the kudos
of an unusual position and secure of ultimate success In the second
Trent had once more changed colour at the thousand leap and his relief
when he heard the answering fifty was manifest and unaffected Here then
was a problem both were presumably in the same interest yet the one
was not in the confidence of the other Nor was this all A few bids
later it chanced that my eye encountered that of Captain Trent and his
which glittered with excitement was instantly and I thought guiltily
withdrawn He wished then to conceal his interest As Jim had said
there was some blamed thing going on And for certain here were these
two men so strangely united so strangely divided both sharpset to
keep the wreck from us and that at an exorbitant figure

Was the wreck worth more than we supposed A sudden heat was kindled
in my brain the bids were nearing Longhursts limit of five thousand
another minute and all would be too late Tearing a leaf from my
sketchbook and inspired I suppose by vanity in my own powers of
inference and observation I took the one mad decision of my life If
you care to go ahead I wrote Im in for all Im worth

Jim read and looked round at me like one bewildered then his eyes
lightened and turning again to the auctioneer he bid Five thousand
one hundred dollars

And fifty said monotonous Bellairs

Presently Pinkerton scribbled What can it be and I answered still
on paper I cant imagine but theres something Watch Bellairs hell
go up to the ten thousand see if he dont

And he did and we followed Long before this word had gone abroad that
there was battle royal we were surrounded by a crowd that looked on
wondering and when Pinkerton had offered ten thousand dollars the
outside value of the cargo even were it safe in San Francisco Bay
and Bellairs smirking from ear to ear to be the centre of so much
attention had jerked out his answering And fifty wonder deepened to
excitement

Ten thousand one hundred said Jim and even as he spoke he made a
sudden gesture with his hand his face changed and I could see that he
had guessed or thought that he had guessed the mystery As he
scrawled another memorandum in his notebook his hand shook like a
telegraphoperators

Chinese ship ran the legend and then in big tremulous halftext
and with a flourish that overran the margin Opium

To be sure thought I this must be the secret I knew that scarce a
ship came in from any Chinese port but she carried somewhere behind a
bulkhead or in some cunning hollow of the beams a nest of the valuable
poison Doubtless there was some such treasure on the Flying Scud How
much was it worth We knew not we were gambling in the dark but Trent
knew and Bellairs and we could only watch and judge

By this time neither Pinkerton nor I were of sound mind Pinkerton was
beside himself his eyes like lamps I shook in every member To any
stranger entering say in the course of the fifteenth thousand we
should probably have cut a poorer figure than Bellairs himself But we
did not pause and the crowd watched us now in silence now with a buzz
of whispers

Seventeen thousand had been reached when Douglas B Longhurst forcing
his way into the opposite row of faces conspicuously and repeatedly
shook his head at Jim Jims answer was a note of two words My
racket which when the great man had perused he shook his finger
warningly and departed I thought with a sorrowful countenance

Although Mr Longhurst knew nothing of Bellairs the shady lawyer knew
all about the Wrecker Boss He had seen him enter the ring with manifest
expectation he saw him depart and the bids continue with manifest
surprise and disappointment Hullo he plainly thought this is not
the ring Im fighting then And he determined to put on a spurt

Eighteen thousand said he

And fifty said Jim taking a leaf out of his adversarys book

Twenty thousand from Bellairs

And fifty from Jim with a little nervous titter

And with one consent they returned to the old pace only now it was
Bellairs who took the hundreds and Jim who did the fifty business But
by this time our idea had gone abroad I could hear the word opium
pass from mouth to mouth and by the looks directed at us I could see
we were supposed to have some private information And here an incident
occurred highly typical of San Francisco Close at my back there had
stood for some time a stout middleaged gentleman with pleasant eyes
hair pleasantly grizzled and a ruddy pleasing face All of a sudden he
appeared as a third competitor skied the Flying Scud with four fat
bids of a thousand dollars each and then as suddenly fled the field
remaining thenceforth as before a silent interested spectator

Ever since Mr Longhursts useless intervention Bellairs had seemed
uneasy and at this new attack he began in his turn to scribble a
note between the bids I imagined naturally enough that it would go to
Captain Trent but when it was done and the writer turned and looked
behind him in the crowd to my unspeakable amazement he did not seem to
remark the captains presence

Messenger boy messenger boy I heard him say Somebody call me a
messenger boy

At last somebody did but it was not the captain

Hes sending for instructions I wrote to Pinkerton

For money he wrote back Shall I strike out I think this is the
time

I nodded

Thirty thousand said Pinkerton making a leap of close upon three
thousand dollars

I could see doubt in Bellairss eye then sudden resolution
Thirtyfive thousand said he

Forty thousand said Pinkerton

There was a long pause during which Bellairss countenance was as
a book and then not much too soon for the impending hammer Forty
thousand and five dollars said he

Pinkerton and I exchanged eloquent glances We were of one mind
Bellairs had tried a bluff now he perceived his mistake and was
bidding against time he was trying to spin out the sale until the
messenger boy returned

Fortyfive thousand dollars said Pinkerton his voice was like a
ghosts and tottered with emotion

Fortyfive thousand and five dollars said Bellairs

Fifty thousand said Pinkerton

I beg your pardon Mr Pinkerton Did I hear you make an advance sir
asked the auctioneer

II have a difficulty in speaking gasped Jim Its fifty thousand
Mr Borden

Bellairs was on his feet in a moment Auctioneer he said I have to
beg the favour of three moments at the telephone In this matter I am
acting on behalf of a certain party to whom I have just written

I have nothing to do with any of this said the auctioneer brutally
I am here to sell this wreck Do you make any advance on fifty
thousand

I have the honour to explain to you sir returned Bellairs with a
miserable assumption of dignity Fifty thousand was the figure named by
my principal but if you will give me the small favour of two moments at
the telephone

O nonsense said the auctioneer If you make no advance Ill knock
it down to Mr Pinkerton

I warn you cried the attorney with sudden shrillness Have a care
what youre about You are here to sell for the underwriters let me
tell younot to act for Mr Douglas Longhurst This sale has been
already disgracefully interrupted to allow that person to hold a
consultation with his minions It has been much commented on

There was no complaint at the time said the auctioneer manifestly
discountenanced You should have complained at the time

I am not here to conduct this sale replied Bellairs I am not paid
for that

Well I am you see retorted the auctioneer his impudence quite
restored and he resumed his singsong Any advance on fifty thousand
dollars No advance on fifty thousand No advance gentlemen Going at
fifty thousand the wreck of the brig Flying Scudgoinggoinggone

My God Jim can we pay the money I cried as the stroke of the
hammer seemed to recall me from a dream

Its got to be raised said he white as a sheet Itll be a hell of
a strain Loudon The credits good for it I think but I shall have to
get around Write me a cheque for your stuff Meet me at the Occidental
in an hour

I wrote my cheque at a desk and I declare I could never have recognised
my signature Jim was gone in a moment Trent had vanished even earlier
only Bellairs remained exchanging insults with the auctioneer and
behold as I pushed my way out of the exchange who should run full tilt
into my arms but the messenger boy

It was by so near a margin that we became the owners of the Flying Scud




CHAPTER X IN WHICH THE CREW VANISH


At the door of the exchange I found myself alongside of the short
middleaged gentleman who had made an appearance so vigorous and so
brief in the great battle

Congratulate you Mr Dodd he said You and your friend stuck to
your guns nobly

No thanks to you sir I replied running us up a thousand at a time
and tempting all the speculators in San Francisco to come and have a
try

O that was temporary insanity said he and I thank the higher
powers I am still a free man Walking this way Mr Dodd Ill walk
along with you Its pleasant for an old fogy like myself to see the
young bloods in the ring Ive done some pretty wild gambles in my time
in this very city when it was a smaller place and I was a younger man
Yes I know you Mr Dodd By sight I may say I know you extremely
well you and your followers the fellows in the kilts eh Pardon me
But I have the misfortune to own a little box on the Saucelito shore
Ill be glad to see you there any Sundaywithout the fellows in kilts
you know and I can give you a bottle of wine and show you the best
collection of Arctic voyages in the States Morgan is my nameJudge
Morgana Welshman and a fortyniner

O if youre a pioneer cried I come to me and Ill provide you with
an axe

Youll want your axes for yourself I fancy he returned with one
of his quick looks Unless you have private knowledge there will be a
good deal of rather violent wrecking to do before you find thatopium
do you call it

Well its either opium or we are stark staring mad I replied But
I assure you we have no private information We went in as I suppose
you did yourself on observation

An observer sir inquired the judge

I may say it is my tradeor rather was said I

Well now and what did you think of Bellairs he asked

Very little indeed said I

I may tell you continued the judge that to me the employment of a
fellow like that appears inexplicable I knew him he knows me too he
has often heard from me in court and I assure you the man is utterly
blown upon it is not safe to trust him with a dollar and here we find
him dealing up to fifty thousand I cant think who can have so trusted
him but I am very sure it was a stranger in San Francisco

Some one for the owners I suppose said I

Surely not exclaimed the judge Owners in London can have nothing
to say to opium smuggled between Hong Kong and San Francisco I should
rather fancy they would be the last to hear of ituntil the ship was
seized No I was thinking of the captain But where would he get the
money above all after having laid out so much to buy the stuff in
China Unless indeed he were acting for some one in Frisco and in
that casehere we go round again in the vicious circleBellairs would
not have been employed

I think I can assure you it was not the captain said I for he and
Bellairs are not acquainted

Wasnt that the captain with the red face and coloured handkerchief
He seemed to me to follow Bellairss game with the most thrilling
interest objected Mr Morgan

Perfectly true said I Trent is deeply interested he very likely
knew Bellairs and he certainly knew what he was there for but I can
put my hand in the fire that Bellairs didnt know Trent

Another singularity observed the judge Well we have had a capital
forenoon But you take an old lawyers advice and get to Midway Island
as fast as you can Theres a pot of money on the table and Bellairs
and Co are not the men to stick at trifles

With this parting counsel Judge Morgan shook hands and made off along
Montgomery Street while I entered the Occidental Hotel on the steps of
which we had finished our conversation I was well known to the clerks
and as soon as it was understood that I was there to wait for Pinkerton
and lunch I was invited to a seat inside the counter Here then in a
retired corner I was beginning to come a little to myself after these
so violent experiences when who should come hurrying in and after a
moment with a clerk fly to one of the telephone boxes but Mr Henry
D Bellairs in person Call it what you will but the impulse was
irresistible and I rose and took a place immediately at the mans back
It may be some excuse that I had often practised this very innocent
form of eavesdropping upon strangers and for fun Indeed I scarce know
anything that gives a lower view of mans intelligence than to overhear
as you thus do one side of a communication

Central said the attorney 2241 and 584 B or some such
numbersWhos thatAll rightMr BellairsOccidental the wires
are fouled in the other placeYes about three minutesYesYesYour
figure I am sorry to sayNoI had no authorityNeither more
nor lessI have every reason to suppose soO Pinkerton Montana
BlockYesYesVery good sirAs you will sirDisconnect 584 B

Bellairs turned to leave at sight of me behind him up flew his hands
and he winced and cringed as though in fear of bodily attack O its
you he cried and then somewhat recovered Mr Pinkertons partner
I believe I am pleased to see you sirto congratulate you on your
late success And with that he was gone obsequiously bowing as he
passed

And now a madcap humour came upon me It was plain Bellairs had been
communicating with his principal I knew the number if not the name
should I ring up at once it was more than likely he would return
in person to the telephone why should not I dash vocally into the
presence of this mysterious person and have some fun for my money I
pressed the bell

Central said I connect again 2241 and 584 B

A phantom central repeated the numbers there was a pause and then
Two two four one came in a tiny voice into my eara voice with the
English singsongthe voice plainly of a gentleman Is that you again
Mr Bellairs it trilled I tell you its no use Is that you Mr
Bellairs Who is that

I only want to put a single question said I civilly Why do you
want to buy the Flying Scud

No answer came The telephone vibrated and hummed in miniature with all
the numerous talk of a great city but the voice of 2241 was silent
Once and twice I put my question but the tiny singsong English voice
I heard no more The man then had fled fled from an impertinent
question It scarce seemed natural to me unless on the principle that
the wicked fleeth when no man pursueth I took the telephone list and
turned the number up 2241 Mrs Keane res 942 Mission Street And
that short of driving to the house and renewing my impertinence in
person was all that I could do

Yet as I resumed my seat in the corner of the office I was conscious
of a new element of the uncertain the underhand perhaps even the
dangerous in our adventure and there was now a new picture in my
mental gallery to hang beside that of the wreck under its canopy of
seabirds and of Captain Trent mopping his red browthe picture of a
man with a telephone dicebox to his ear and at the small voice of a
single question struck suddenly as white as ashes

From these considerations I was awakened by the striking of the clock
An hour and nearly twenty minutes had elapsed since Pinkerton departed
for the money he was twenty minutes behind time and to me who knew so
well his gluttonous despatch of business and had so frequently admired
his iron punctuality the fact spoke volumes The twenty minutes slowly
stretched into an hour the hour had nearly extended to a second and
I still sat in my corner of the office or paced the marble pavement of
the hall a prey to the most wretched anxiety and penitence The hour
for lunch was nearly over before I remembered that I had not eaten
Heaven knows I had no appetite but there might still be much to doit
was needful I should keep myself in proper trim if it were only to
digest the now too probable bad news and leaving word at the office for
Pinkerton I sat down to table and called for soup oysters and a pint
of champagne

I was not long set before my friend returned He looked pale and rather
old refused to hear of food and called for tea

I suppose alls up said I with an incredible sinking

No he replied Ive pulled it through Loudon just pulled it
through I couldnt have raised another cent in all Frisco People
dont like it Longhurst even went back on me said he wasnt a
threecardmonte man

Well whats the odds said I Thats all we wanted isnt it

Loudon I tell you Ive had to pay blood for that money cried my
friend with almost savage energy and gloom Its all on ninety days
too I couldnt get another daynot another day If we go ahead with
this affair Loudon youll have to go yourself and make the fur fly
Ill stay of courseIve got to stay and face the trouble in this city
though I tell you I just long to go I would show these fat brutes of
sailors what work was I would be all through that wreck and out at the
other end before they had boosted themselves upon the deck But youll
do your level best Loudon I depend on you for that You must be all
fire and grit and dash from the word go That schooner and the boodle
on board of her are bound to be here before three months or its B U
S Tbust

Ill swear Ill do my best Jim Ill work double tides said I It
is my fault that you are in this thing and Ill get you out again or
kill myself But what is that you say If we go ahead Have we any
choice then

Im coming to that said Jim It isnt that I doubt the investment
Dont blame yourself for that you showed a fine sound business
instinct I always knew it was in you but then it ripped right out I
guess that little beast of an attorney knew what he was doing and he
wanted nothing better than to go beyond No theres profit in the deal
its not that its these ninetyday bills and the strain Ive given
the credit for Ive been up and down borrowing and begging and
bribing to borrow I dont believe theres another man but me in
Frisco he cried with a sudden fervor of self admiration who could
have raised that last ten thousandThen theres another thing I had
hoped you might have peddled that opium through the islands which is
safer and more profitable But with this threemonth limit you must
make tracks for Honolulu straight and communicate by steamer Ill
try to put up something for you there Ill have a man spoken to whos
posted on that line of biz Keep a bright lookout for him as soons you
make the islands for its on the cards he might pick you up at sea in a
whaleboat or a steamlaunch and bring the dollars right on board

It shows how much I had suffered morally during my sojourn in San
Francisco that even now when our fortunes trembled in the balance
I should have consented to become a smuggler and of all things a
smuggler of opium Yet I did and that in silence without a protest
not without a twinge

And suppose said I suppose the opium is so securely hidden that I
cant get hands on it

Then you will stay there till that brig is kindlingwood and stay
and split that kindlingwood with your penknife cried Pinkerton The
stuff is there we know that and it must be found But all this is
only the one string to our bowthough I tell you Ive gone into it
headfirst as if it was our bottom dollar Why the first thing I
did before Id raised a cent and with this other notion in my head
alreadythe first thing I did was to secure the schooner The Nora
Creina she is sixtyfour tons quite big enough for our purpose since
the rice is spoiled and the fastest thing of her tonnage out of San
Francisco For a bonus of two hundred and a monthly charter of three I
have her for my own time wages and provisions say four hundred more a
drop in the bucket They began firing the cargo out of her she was part
loaded near two hours ago and about the same time John Smith got the
order for the stores Thats what I call business

No doubt of that said I But the other notion


Well here it is said Jim You agree with me that Bellairs was ready
to go higher

I saw where he was coming Yesand why shouldnt he said I Is
that the line

Thats the line Loudon Dodd assented Jim If Bellairs and his
principal have any desire to go me better Im their man

A sudden thought a sudden fear shot into my mind What if I had been
right What if my childish pleasantry had frightened the principal
away and thus destroyed our chance Shame closed my mouth I began
instinctively a long course of reticence and it was without a word
of my meeting with Bellairs or my discovery of the address in Mission
Street that I continued the discussion

Doubtless fifty thousand was originally mentioned as a round sum said
I or at least so Bellairs supposed But at the same time it may be an
outside sum and to cover the expenses we have already incurred for the
money and the schoonerI am far from blaming you I see how needful
it was to be ready for either eventbut to cover them we shall want a
rather large advance

Bellairs will go to sixty thousand its my belief if he were properly
handled he would take the hundred replied Pinkerton Look back on
the way the sale ran at the end

That is my own impression as regards Bellairs I admitted The point I
am trying to make is that Bellairs himself may be mistaken that what he
supposed to be a round sum was really an outside figure

Well Loudon if that is so said Jim with extraordinary gravity of
face and voice if that is so let him take the Flying Scud at fifty
thousand and joy go with her I prefer the loss

Is that so Jim Are we dipped as bad as that I cried

Weve put our hand farther out than we can pull it in again Loudon
he replied Why man that fifty thousand dollars before we get clear
again will cost us nearer seventy Yes it figures up overhead to more
than ten per cent a month and I could do no better and there isnt
the man breathing could have done as well It was a miracle Loudon I
couldnt but admire myself O if we had just the four months And you
know Loudon it may still be done With your energy and charm if the
worst comes to the worst you can run that schooner as you ran one
of your picnics and we may have luck And O man if we do pull it
through what a dashing operation it will be What an advertisement
what a thing to talk of and remember all our lives However he
broke off suddenly we must try the safe thing first Heres for the
shyster

There was another struggle in my mind whether I should even now admit
my knowledge of the Mission Street address But I had let the favourable
moment slip I had now which made it the more awkward not merely the
original discovery but my late suppression to confess I could not help
reasoning besides that the more natural course was to approach the
principal by the road of his agents office and there weighed upon my
spirits a conviction that we were already too late and that the man
was gone two hours ago Once more then I held my peace and after an
exchange of words at the telephone to assure ourselves he was at home
we set out for the attorneys office

The endless streets of any American city pass from one end to another
through strange degrees and vicissitudes of splendour and distress
running under the same name between monumental warehouses the dens
and taverns of thieves and the sward and shrubbery of villas In San
Francisco the sharp inequalities of the ground and the sea bordering
on so many sides greatly exaggerate these contrasts The street for
which we were now bound took its rise among blowing sands somewhere in
view of the Lone Mountain Cemetery ran for a term across that rather
windy Olympus of Nob Hill or perhaps just skirted its frontier passed
almost immediately after through a stage of little houses rather
impudently painted and offering to the eye of the observer this
diagnostic peculiarity that the huge brass plates upon the small and
highly coloured doors bore only the first names of ladiesNorah or Lily
or Florence traversed China Town where it was doubtless undermined
with opium cellars and its blocks pierced after the similitude of
rabbitwarrens with a hundred doors and passages and galleries enjoyed
a glimpse of high publicity at the corner of Kearney and proceeded
among dives and warehouses towards the City Front and the region of the
waterrats In this last stage of its career where it was both grimy
and solitary and alternately quiet and roaring to the wheels of drays
we found a certain house of some pretension to neatness and furnished
with a rustic outside stair On the pillar of the stair a black
plate bore in gilded lettering this device Harry D Bellairs
Attorneyatlaw Consultations 9 to 6 On ascending the stairs a door
was found to stand open on the balcony with this further inscription
Mr Bellairs In

I wonder what we do next said I

Guess we sail right in returned Jim and suited the action to the
word

The room in which we found ourselves was clean but extremely bare A
rather oldfashioned secretaire stood by the wall with a chair drawn to
the desk in one corner was a shelf with halfadozen law books and
I can remember literally not another stick of furniture One inference
imposed itself Mr Bellairs was in the habit of sitting down himself
and suffering his clients to stand At the far end and veiled by a
curtain of red baize a second door communicated with the interior of
the house Hence after some coughing and stamping we elicited the
shyster who came timorously forth for all the world like a man in fear
of bodily assault and then recognising his guests suffered from what
I can only call a nervous paroxysm of courtesy

Mr Pinkerton and partner said he I will go and fetch you seats

Not the least said Jim No time Much rather stand This is
business Mr Bellairs This morning as you know I bought the wreck
Flying Scud

The lawyer nodded

And bought her pursued my friend at a figure out of all proportion
to the cargo and the circumstances as they appeared

And now you think better of it and would like to be off with your
bargain I have been figuring upon this returned the lawyer My
client I will not hide from you was displeased with me for putting her
so high I think we were both too heated Mr Pinkerton rivalrythe
spirit of competition But I will be quite frankI know when I am
dealing with gentlemenand I am almost certain if you leave the matter
in my hands my client would relieve you of the bargain so as you would
losehe consulted our faces with gimleteyed calculationnothing
he added shrilly

And here Pinkerton amazed me

Thats a little too thin said he I have the wreck I know theres
boodle in her and I mean to keep her What I want is some points which
may save me needless expense and which Im prepared to pay for money
down The thing for you to consider is just this am I to deal with you
or direct with your principal If you are prepared to give me the facts
right off why name your figure Only one thing added Jim holding a
finger up when I say money down I mean bills payable when the ship
returns and if the information proves reliable I dont buy pigs in
pokes

I had seen the lawyers face light up for a moment and then at the
sound of Jims proviso miserably fade I guess you know more about
this wreck than I do Mr Pinkerton said he I only know that I was
told to buy the thing and tried and couldnt

What I like about you Mr Bellairs is that you waste no time said
Jim Now then your clients name and address

On consideration replied the lawyer with indescribable furtivity
I cannot see that I am entitled to communicate my clients name I
will sound him for you with pleasure if you care to instruct me but I
cannot see that I can give you his address

Very well said Jim and put his hat on Rather a strong step isnt
it Between every sentence was a clear pause Not think better of
it Well comecall it a dollar

Mr Pinkerton sir exclaimed the offended attorney and indeed I
myself was almost afraid that Jim had mistaken his man and gone too far

No present use for a dollar says Jim Well look here Mr Bellairs
were both busy men and Ill go to my outside figure with you right
away

Stop this Pinkerton I broke in I know the address 924 Mission
Street


I do not know whether Pinkerton or Bellairs was the more taken aback

Why in snakes didnt you say so Loudon cried my friend

You didnt ask for it before said I colouring to my temples under
his troubled eyes

It was Bellairs who broke silence kindly supplying me with all that
I had yet to learn Since you know Mr Dicksons address said
he plainly burning to be rid of us I suppose I need detain you no
longer

I do not know how Pinkerton felt but I had death in my soul as we came
down the outside stair from the den of this blotched spider My whole
being was strung waiting for Jims first question and prepared to
blurt out I believe almost with tears a full avowal But my friend
asked nothing

We must hack it said he tearing off in the direction of the nearest
stand No time to be lost You saw how I changed ground No use in
paying the shysters commission

Again I expected a reference to my suppression again I was
disappointed It was plain Jim feared the subject and I felt I almost
hated him for that fear At last when we were already in the hack and
driving towards Mission Street I could bear my suspense no longer

You do not ask me about that address said I

No said he quickly and timidly What was it I would like to know

The note of timidity offended me like a buffet my temper rose as hot as
mustard I must request you do not ask me said I It is a matter I
cannot explain

The moment the foolish words were said that moment I would have given
worlds to recall them how much more when Pinkerton patting my hand
replied All right dear boy not another word thats all done Im
convinced its perfectly right To return upon the subject was beyond
my courage but I vowed inwardly that I should do my utmost in the
future for this mad speculation and that I would cut myself in pieces
before Jim should lose one dollar

We had no sooner arrived at the address than I had other things to think
of

Mr Dickson Hes gone said the landlady

Where had he gone

Im sure I cant tell you she answered He was quite a stranger to
me

Did he express his baggage maam asked Pinkerton

Hadnt any was the reply He came last night and left again today
with a satchel

When did he leave I inquired

It was about noon replied the landlady Some one rang up the
telephone and asked for him and I reckon he got some news for he
left right away although his rooms were taken by the week He seemed
considerable put out I reckon it was a death

My heart sank perhaps my idiotic jest had indeed driven him away
and again I asked myself Why and whirled for a moment in a vortex of
untenable hypotheses

What was he like maam Pinkerton was asking when I returned to
consciousness of my surroundings

A clean shaved man said the woman and could be led or driven into no
more significant description

Pull up at the nearest drugstore said Pinkerton to the driver and
when there the telephone was put in operation and the message sped to
the Pacific Mail Steamship Companys officethis was in the days
before Spreckels had arisenWhen does the next China steamer touch at
Honolulu

The City of Pekin she cast off the dock today at halfpast one
came the reply

Its a clear case of bolt said Jim Hes skipped or my names not
Pinkerton Hes gone to head us off at Midway Island

Somehow I was not so sure there were elements in the case not known
to Pinkertonthe fears of the captain for examplethat inclined me
otherwise and the idea that I had terrified Mr Dickson into flight
though resting on so slender a foundation clung obstinately in my mind
Shouldnt we see the list of passengers I asked

Dickson is such a blamed common name returned Jim and then as like
as not he would change it

At this I had another intuition A negative of a street scene taken
unconsciously when I was absorbed in other thought rose in my memory
with not a feature blurred a view from Bellairss door as we were
coming down of muddy roadway passing drays matted telegraph wires
a Chinaboy with a basket on his head and almost opposite a corner
grocery with the name of Dickson in great gilt letters

Yes said I you are right he would change it And anyway I dont
believe it was his name at all I believe he took it from a corner
grocery beside Bellairss

As like as not said Jim still standing on the sidewalk with
contracted brows

Well what shall we do next I asked

The natural thing would be to rush the schooner he replied But I
dont know I telephoned the captain to go at it head down and heels in
air he answered like a little man and I guess hes getting around I
believe Loudon well give Trent a chance Trent was in it he was
in it up to the neck even if he couldnt buy he could give us the
straight tip

I think so too said I Where shall we find him

British consulate of course said Jim And thats another reason for
taking him first We can hustle that schooner up all evening but when
the consulates shut its shut

At the consulate we learned that Captain Trent had alighted such is I
believe the classic phrase at the What Cheer House To that large and
unaristocratic hostelry we drove and addressed ourselves to a large
clerk who was chewing a toothpick and looking straight before him

Captain Jacob Trent

Gone said the clerk

Where has he gone asked Pinkerton

Caint say said the clerk

When did he go I asked

Dont know said the clerk and with the simplicity of a monarch
offered us the spectacle of his broad back

What might have happened next I dread to picture for Pinkertons
excitement had been growing steadily and now burned dangerously high
but we were spared extremities by the intervention of a second clerk

Why Mr Dodd he exclaimed running forward to the counter Glad to
see you sir Can I do anything in your way

How virtuous actions blossom Here was a young man to whose pleased ears
I had rehearsed _Just before the battle mother_ at some weekly picnic
and now in that tense moment of my life he came from the machine to
be my helper

Captain Trent of the wreck O yes Mr Dodd he left about twelve he
and another of the men The Kanaka went earlier by the City of Pekin I
know that I remember expressing his chest Captain Trent Ill inquire
Mr Dodd Yes they were all here Here are the names on the register
perhaps you would care to look at them while I go and see about the
baggage

I drew the book toward me and stood looking at the four names all
written in the same hand rather a big and rather a bad one Trent
Brown Hardy and instead of Ah Sing Jos Amalu

Pinkerton said I suddenly have you that _Occidental_ in your
pocket

Never left me said Pinkerton producing the paper


I turned to the account of the wreck Here said I heres the name
Elias Goddedaal mate Why do we never come across Elias Goddedaal

Thats so said Jim Was he with the rest in that saloon when you saw
them

I dont believe it said I They were only four and there was none
that behaved like a mate

At this moment the clerk returned with his report

The captain it appeared came with some kind of an express waggon
and he and the man took off three chests and a big satchel Our porter
helped to put them on but they drove the cart themselves The porter
thinks they went down town It was about one

Still in time for the City of Pekin observed Jim

How many of them were here I inquired

Three sir and the Kanaka replied the clerk I cant somehow fin
out about the third but hes gone too

Mr Goddedaal the mate wasnt here then I asked

No Mr Dodd none but what you see says the clerk

Nor you never heard where he was

No Any particular reason for finding these men Mr Dodd inquired
the clerk

This gentleman and I have bought the wreck I explained we wished to
get some information and it is very annoying to find the men all gone

A certain group had gradually formed about us for the wreck was still
a matter of interest and at this one of the bystanders a rough
seafaring man spoke suddenly

I guess the mate wont be gone said he Hes main sick never left
the sickbay aboard the Tempest so they tell ME

Jim took me by the sleeve Back to the consulate said he

But even at the consulate nothing was known of Mr Goddedaal The doctor
of the Tempest had certified him very sick he had sent his papers in
but never appeared in person before the authorities

Have you a telephone laid on to the Tempest asked Pinkerton

Laid on yesterday said the clerk

Do you mind asking or letting me ask We are very anxious to get hold
of Mr Goddedaal

All right said the clerk and turned to the telephone Im sorry
he said presently Mr Goddedaal has left the ship and no one knows
where he is

Do you pay the mens passage home I inquired a sudden thought
striking me

If they want it said the clerk sometimes they dont But we paid
the Kanakas passage to Honolulu this morning and by what Captain Trent
was saying I understand the rest are going home together

Then you havent paid them said I

Not yet said the clerk

And you would be a good deal surprised if I were to tell you they were
gone already I asked

O I should think you were mistaken said he

Such is the fact however said I

I am sure you must be mistaken he repeated

May I use your telephone one moment asked Pinkerton and as soon as
permission had been granted I heard him ring up the printingoffice
where our advertisements were usually handled More I did not hear for
suddenly recalling the big bad hand in the register of the What Cheer
House I asked the consulate clerk if he had a specimen of Captain
Trents writing Whereupon I learned that the captain could not write
having cut his hand open a little before the loss of the brig that the
latter part of the log even had been written up by Mr Goddedaal and
that Trent had always signed with his left hand By the time I had
gleaned this information Pinkerton was ready

Thats all that we can do Now for the schooner said he and by
tomorrow evening I lay hands on Goddedaal or my names not Pinkerton

How have you managed I inquired

Youll see before you get to bed said Pinkerton And now after
all this backwarding and forwarding and that hotel clerk and that
bug Bellairs itll be a change and a kind of consolation to see the
schooner I guess things are humming there

But on the wharf when we reached it there was no sign of bustle
and but for the galley smoke no mark of life on the Norah Creina
Pinkertons face grew pale and his mouth straightened as he leaped on
board

Wheres the captain of this and he left the phrase unfinished
finding no epithet sufficiently energetic for his thoughts

It did not appear whom or what he was addressing but a head presumably
the cooks appeared in answer at the galley door

In the cabin at dinner said the cook deliberately chewing as he
spoke

Is that cargo out

No sir

None of it

O theres some of it out Well get at the rest of it livelier
tomorrow I guess

I guess therell be something broken first said Pinkerton and strode
to the cabin

Here we found a man fat dark and quiet seated gravely at what seemed
a liberal meal He looked up upon our entrance and seeing Pinkerton
continue to stand facing him in silence hat on head arms folded and
lips compressed an expression of mingled wonder and annoyance began to
dawn upon his placid face

Well said Jim and so this is what you call rushing around

Who are you cries the captain

Me Im Pinkerton retorted Jim as though the name had been a
talisman

Youre not very civil whoever you are was the reply But still a
certain effect had been produced for he scrambled to his feet
and added hastily A man must have a bit of dinner you know Mr
Pinkerton

Wheres your mate snapped Jim

Hes up town returned the other

Up town sneered Pinkerton Now Ill tell you what you are youre a
Fraud and if I wasnt afraid of dirtying my boot I would kick you and
your dinner into that dock

Ill tell you something too retorted the captain duskily flushing
I wouldnt sail this ship for the man you are if you went upon your
knees Ive dealt with gentlemen up to now

I can tell you the names of a number of gentlemen youll never deal
with any more and thats the whole of Longhursts gang said Jim
Ill put your pipe out in that quarter my friend Here rout out your
traps as quick as look at it and take your vermin along with you Ill
have a captain in this very night thats a sailor and some sailors to
work for him

Ill go when I please and thats tomorrow morning cried the captain
after us as we departed for the shore

Theres something gone wrong with the world today it must have come
bottom up wailed Pinkerton Bellairs and then the hotel clerk
and now This Fraud And what am I to do for a captain Loudon with
Longhurst gone home an hour ago and the boys all scattered

I know said I Jump in And then to the driver Do you know Black
Toms

Thither then we rattled passed through the bar and found as I had
hoped Johnson in the enjoyment of club life The table had been
thrust upon one side a South Sea merchant was discoursing music from a
mouthorgan in one corner and in the middle of the floor Johnson and
a fellowseaman their arms clasped about each others bodies somewhat
heavily danced The room was both cold and close a jet of gas
which continually menaced the heads of the performers shed a coarse
illumination the mouthorgan sounded shrill and dismal and the faces
of all concerned were churchlike in their gravity It were of course
indelicate to interrupt these solemn frolics so we edged ourselves to
chairs for all the world like belated comers in a concertroom and
patiently waited for the end At length the organist having exhausted
his supply of breath ceased abruptly in the middle of a bar With
the cessation of the strain the dancers likewise came to a full stop
swayed a moment still embracing and then separated and looked about
the circle for applause

Very well danced said one but it appears the compliment was not
strong enough for the performers who forgetful of the proverb took up
the tale in person

Well said Johnson I maynt be no sailor but I can dance

And his late partner with an almost pathetic conviction added My
foot is as light as a feather

Seeing how the wind set you may be sure I added a few words of
praise before I carried Johnson alone into the passage to whom thus
mollified I told so much as I judged needful of our situation and
begged him if he would not take the job himself to find me a smart
man

Me he cried I couldnt no more do it than I could try to go to
hell

I thought you were a mate said I

So I am a mate giggled Johnson and you dont catch me shipping
noways else But Ill tell you what I believe I can get you Arty Nares
you seen Arty firstrate navigator and a son of a gun for style And
he proceeded to explain to me that Mr Nares who had the promise of
a fine barque in six months after things had quieted down was in the
meantime living very private and would be pleased to have a change of
air

I called out Pinkerton and told him Nares he cried as soon as I
had come to the name I would jump at the chance of a man that had had
Naress trousers on Why Loudon hes the smartest deepwater mate out
of San Francisco and draws his dividends regular in service and out
This hearty indorsation clinched the proposal Johnson agreed to produce
Nares before six the following morning and Black Tom being called into
the consultation promised us four smart hands for the same hour and
even what appeared to all of us excessive promised them sober

The streets were fully lighted when we left Black Toms street after
street sparkling with gas or electricity line after line of distant
luminaries climbing the steep sides of hills towards the overvaulting
darkness and on the other hand where the waters of the bay invisibly
trembled a hundred riding lanterns marked the position of a hundred
ships The seafog flew high in heaven and at the level of mans life
and business it was clear and chill By silent consent we paid the hack
off and proceeded arm in arm towards the Poodle Dog for dinner

At one of the first hoardings I was aware of a billsticker at work it
was a late hour for this employment and I checked Pinkerton until the
sheet should be unfolded This is what I read

 TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD

 OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE

 WRECKED BRIG FLYING SCUD

 APPLYING

 PERSONALLY OR BY LETTER

 AT THE OFFICE OF JAMES PINKERTON MONTANA
 BLOCK

 BEFORE NOON TOMORROW TUESDAY 12TH

 WILL RECEIVE

 TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD

This is your idea Pinkerton I cried

Yes Theyve lost no time Ill say that for themnot like the Fraud
said he But mind you Loudon thats not half of it The cream of
the ideas here we know our mans sick well a copy of that has been
mailed to every hospital every doctor and every drugstore in San
Francisco

Of course from the nature of our business Pinkerton could do a thing
of the kind at a figure extremely reduced for all that I was appalled
at the extravagance and said so

What matter a few dollars now he replied sadly Its in three months
that the pull comes Loudon

We walked on again in silence not without a shiver Even at the Poodle
Dog we took our food with small appetite and less speech and it was
not until he was warmed with a third glass of champagne that Pinkerton
cleared his throat and looked upon me with a deprecating eye

Loudon said he there was a subject you didnt wish to be referred
to I only want to do so indirectly It wasnthe falteredit wasnt
because you were dissatisfied with me he concluded with a quaver

Pinkerton cried I

No no not a word just now he hastened to proceed Let me speak
first I appreciate though I cant imitate the delicacy of your
nature and I can well understand you would rather die than speak of it
and yet might feel disappointed I did think I could have done better
myself But when I found how tight money was in this city and a man
like Douglas B Longhursta fortyniner the man that stood at bay in a
corn patch for five hours against the San Diablo squattersweakening on
the operation I tell you Loudon I began to despair andI may
have made mistakes no doubt there are thousands who could have done
betterbut I give you a loyal hand on it I did my best

My poor Jim said I as if I ever doubted you as if I didnt
know you had done wonders All day Ive been admiring your energy and
resource And as for that affair

No Loudon no more not a word more I dont want to hear cried Jim

Well to tell you the truth I dont want to tell you said I for
its a thing Im ashamed of

Ashamed Loudon O dont say that dont use such an expression even
in jest protested Pinkerton

Do you never do anything youre ashamed of I inquired

No says he rolling his eyes Why Im sometimes sorry afterwards
when it pans out different from what I figured But I cant see what I
would want to be ashamed for

I sat a while considering with admiration the simplicity of my friends
character Then I sighed Do you know Jim what Im sorriest for
said I At this rate I cant be best man at your marriage

My marriage he repeated echoing the sigh No marriage for me now
Im going right down tonight to break it to her I think thats whats
shaken me all day I feel as if I had had no right after I was engaged
to operate so widely

Well you know Jim it was my doing and you must lay the blame on
me said I

Not a cent of it he cried I was as eager as yourself only not so
bright at the beginning No Ive myself to thank for it but its a
wrench

While Jim departed on his dolorous mission I returned alone to the
office lit the gas and sat down to reflect on the events of that
momentous day on the strange features of the tale that had been so far
unfolded the disappearances the terrors the great sums of money and
on the dangerous and ungrateful task that awaited me in the immediate
future

It is difficult in the retrospect of such affairs to avoid attributing
to ourselves in the past a measure of the knowledge we possess today
But I may say and yet be well within the mark that I was consumed that
night with a fever of suspicion and curiosity exhausted my fancy in
solutions which I still dismissed as incommensurable with the facts
and in the mystery by which I saw myself surrounded found a precious
stimulus for my courage and a convenient soothing draught for
conscience Even had all been plain sailing I do not hint that I should
have drawn back Smuggling is one of the meanest of crimes for by that
we rob a whole country pro rata and are therefore certain to impoverish
the poor to smuggle opium is an offence particularly dark since it
stands related not so much to murder as to massacre Upon all these
points I was quite clear my sympathy was all in arms against my
interest and had not Jim been involved I could have dwelt almost with
satisfaction on the idea of my failure But Jim his whole fortune and
his marriage depended upon my success and I preferred the interests of
my friend before those of all the islanders in the South Seas This is
a poor private morality if you like but it is mine and the best I
have and I am not half so much ashamed of having embarked at all on
this adventure as I am proud that while I was in it and for the
sake of my friend I was up early and down late set my own hand to
everything took dangers as they came and for once in my life played
the man throughout At the same time I could have desired another field
of energy and I was the more grateful for the redeeming element of
mystery Without that though I might have gone ahead and done as well
it would scarce have been with ardour and what inspired me that night
with an impatient greed of the sea the island and the wreck was the
hope that I might stumble there upon the answer to a hundred questions
and learn why Captain Trent fanned his red face in the exchange and why
Mr Dickson fled from the telephone in the Mission Street lodginghouse




CHAPTER XI IN WHICH JIM AND I TAKE DIFFERENT WAYS


I was unhappy when I closed my eyes and it was to unhappiness that I
opened them again next morning to a confused sense of some calamity
still inarticulate and to the consciousness of jaded limbs and of
a swimming head I must have lain for some time inert and stupidly
miserable before I became aware of a reiterated knocking at the
door with which discovery all my wits flowed back in their accustomed
channels and I remembered the sale and the wreck and Goddedaal and
Nares and Johnson and Black Tom and the troubles of yesterday
and the manifold engagements of the day that was to come The thought
thrilled me like a trumpet in the hour of battle In a moment I had
leaped from bed crossed the office where Pinkerton lay in a deep trance
of sleep on the convertible sofa and stood in the doorway in my night
gear to receive our visitors

Johnson was first by way of usher smiling From a little behind with
his Sunday hat tilted forward over his brow and a cigar glowing between
his lips Captain Nares acknowledged our previous acquaintance with a
succinct nod Behind him again in the top of the stairway a knot of
sailors the new crew of the Norah Creina stood polishing the wall with
back and elbow These I left without to their reflections But our two
officers I carried at once into the office where taking Jim by the
shoulder I shook him slowly into consciousness He sat up all abroad
for the moment and stared on the new captain

Jim said I this is Captain Nares Captain Mr Pinkerton

Nares repeated his curt nod still without speech and I thought he held
us both under a watchful scrutiny

O says Jim this is Captain Nares is it Good morning Captain
Nares Happy to have the pleasure of your acquaintance sir I know you
well by reputation

Perhaps under the circumstances of the moment this was scarce a
welcome speech At least Nares received it with a grunt

Well Captain Jim continued you know about the size of the
business Youre to take the Nora Creina to Midway Island break up
a wreck call at Honolulu and back to this port I suppose thats
understood

Well returned Nares with the same unamiable reserve for a reason
which I guess you know the cruise may suit me but theres a point or
two to settle We shall have to talk Mr Pinkerton But whether I go or
not somebody will theres no sense in losing time and you might give
Mr Johnson a note let him take the hands right down and set to to
overhaul the rigging The beasts look sober he added with an air of
great disgust and need putting to work to keep them so

This being agreed upon Nares watched his subordinate depart and drew a
visible breath

And now were alone and can talk said he Whats this thing about
Its been advertised like Barnums museum that poster of yours has
set the Front talking thats an objection in itself for Im laying a
little dark just now and anyway before I take the ship I require to
know what Im going after

Thereupon Pinkerton gave him the whole tale beginning with a
businesslike precision and working himself up as he went on to the
boilingpoint of narrative enthusiasm Nares sat and smoked hat
still on head and acknowledged each fresh feature of the story with a
frowning nod But his pale blue eyes betrayed him and lighted visibly

Now you see for yourself Pinkerton concluded theres every last
chance that Trent has skipped to Honolulu and it wont take much of
that fifty thousand dollars to charter a smart schooner down to Midway
Heres where I want a man cried Jim with contagious energy That
wrecks mine Ive paid for it money down and if its got to be fought
for I want to see it fought for lively If youre not back in ninety
days I tell you plainly Ill make one of the biggest busts ever seen
upon this coast its life or death for Mr Dodd and me As like as not
itll come to grapples on the island and when I heard your name last
nightand a blame sight more this morning when I saw the eye youve
got in your headI said Nares is good enough for me

I guess observed Nares studying the ash of his cigar the sooner I
get that schooner outside the Farallones the better youll be pleased

Youre the man I dreamed of cried Jim bouncing on the bed Theres
not five per cent of fraud in all your carcase

Just hold on said Nares Theres another point I heard some talk
about a supercargo

Thats Mr Dodd here my partner said Jim

I dont see it returned the captain drily One captains enough for
any ship that ever I was aboard

Now dont you start disappointing me said Pinkerton for youre
talking without thought Im not going to give you the run of the books
of this firm am I I guess not Well this is not only a cruise its a
business operation and thats in the hands of my partner You sail that
ship you see to breaking up that wreck and keeping the men upon the
jump and youll find your hands about full Only no mistake about one
thing it has to be done to Mr Dodds satisfaction for its Mr Dodd
thats paying

Im accustomed to give satisfaction said Mr Nares with a dark
flush

And so you will here cried Pinkerton I understand you Youre
prickly to handle but youre straight all through

The positions got to be understood though returned Nares perhaps
a trifle mollified My position I mean Im not going to ship
sailingmaster its enough out of my way already to set a foot on this
mosquito schooner

Well Ill tell you retorted Jim with an indescribable twinkle you
just meet me on the ballast and well make it a barquentine

Nares laughed a little tactless Pinkerton had once more gained a
victory in tact Then theres another point resumed the captain
tacitly relinquishing the last How about the owners

O you leave that to me Im one of Longhursts crowd you know said
Jim with sudden bristling vanity Any man thats good enough for me
is good enough for them

Who are they asked Nares

MIntyre and Spittal said Jim

O well give me a card of yours said the captain you neednt
bother to write I keep MIntyre and Spittal in my vestpocket

Boast for boast it was always thus with Nares and Pinkertonthe two
vainest men of my acquaintance And having thus reinstated himself in
his own opinion the captain rose and with a couple of his stiff nods
departed

Jim I cried as the door closed behind him I dont like that man

Youve just got to Loudon returned Jim Hes a typical American
seamanbrave as a lion full of resource and stands high with his
owners Hes a man with a record

For brutality at sea said I

Say what you like exclaimed Pinkerton it was a good hour we got him
in Id trust Mamies life to him tomorrow

Well and talking of Mamie says I

Jim paused with his trousers half on Shes the gallantest little soul
God ever made he cried Loudon Id meant to knock you up last night
and I hope you wont take it unfriendly that I didnt I went in and
looked at you asleep and I saw you were all broken up and let you be
The news would keep anyway and even you Loudon couldnt feel it the
same way as I did

What news I asked

Its this way says Jim I told her how we stood and that I backed
down from marrying Are you tired of me says she God bless her
Well I explained the whole thing over again the chance of smash your
absence unavoidable the point I made of having you for the best man
and that If youre not tired of me I think I see one way to manage
says she Lets get married tomorrow and Mr Loudon can be best man
before he goes to sea Thats how she said it crisp and bright like
one of Dickenss characters It was no good for me to talk about the
smash Youll want me all the more she said Loudon I only pray I
can make it up to her I prayed for it last night beside your bed while
you lay sleepingfor you and Mamie and myself andI dont know if
you quite believe in prayer Im a bit Ingersollian myselfbut a kind
of sweetness came over me and I couldnt help but think it was an
answer Never was a man so lucky You and me and Mamie its a triple
cord Loudon If either of you were to die And she likes you so much
and thinks you so accomplished and distinguelooking and was just as
set as I was to have you for best man Mr Loudon she calls you
seems to me so friendly And she sat up till three in the morning fixing
up a costume for the marriage it did me good to see her Loudon and to
see that needle going going and to say All this hurry Jim is just
to marry you I couldnt believe it it was so like some blame fairy
story To think of those old tintype times about turned my head I was
so unrefined then and so illiterate and so lonesome and here I am in
clover and Im blamed if I can see what Ive done to deserve it

So he poured forth with innocent volubility the fulness of his heart
and I from these irregular communications must pick out here a little
and there a little the particulars of his new plan They were to be
married sure enough that day the wedding breakfast was to be at
Franks the evening to be passed in a visit of Godspeed aboard the
Norah Creina and then we were to part Jim and I he to his married
life I on my seaenterprise If ever I cherished an illfeeling
for Miss Mamie I forgave her now so brave and kind so pretty and
venturesome was her decision The weather frowned overhead with a
leaden sky and San Francisco had never in all my experience looked so
bleak and gaunt and shoddy and crazy like a city prematurely old but
through all my wanderings and errands to and fro by the dock side or in
the jostling street among rude sounds and ugly sights there ran in my
mind like a tiny strain of music the thought of my friends happiness

For that was indeed a day of many and incongruous occupations Breakfast
was scarce swallowed before Jim must run to the City Hall and Franks
about the cares of marriage and I hurry to John Smiths upon the
account of stores and thence on a visit of certification to the
Norah Creina Methought she looked smaller than ever sundry great
ships overspiring her from close without She was already a nightmare of
disorder and the wharf alongside was piled with a world of casks and
cases and tins and tools and coils of rope and miniature barrels of
giant powder such as it seemed no human ingenuity could stuff on board
of her Johnson was in the waist in a red shirt and dungaree trousers
his eye kindled with activity With him I exchanged a word or two
thence stepped aft along the narrow alleyway between the house and the
rail and down the companion to the main cabin where the captain sat
with the commissioner at wine

I gazed with disaffection at the little box which for many a day I was
to call home On the starboard was a stateroom for the captain on the
port a pair of frowsy berths one over the other and abutting astern
upon the side of an unsavoury cupboard The walls were yellow and damp
the floor black and greasy there was a prodigious litter of straw old
newspapers and broken packingcases and by way of ornament only
a glassrack a thermometer presented with compliments of some
advertising whiskeydealer and a swinging lamp It was hard to foresee
that before a week was up I should regard that cabin as cheerful
lightsome airy and even spacious

I was presented to the commissioner and to a young friend of his whom
he had brought with him for the purpose apparently of smoking cigars
and after we had pledged one another in a glass of California port a
trifle sweet and sticky for a morning beverage the functionary spread
his papers on the table and the hands were summoned Down they trooped
accordingly into the cabin and stood eyeing the ceiling or the floor
the picture of sheepish embarrassment and with a common air of wanting
to expectorate and not quite daring In admirable contrast stood
the Chinese cook easy dignified set apart by spotless raiment the
hidalgo of the seas

I daresay you never had occasion to assist at the farce which followed
Our shipping laws in the United States thanks to the inimitable Dana
are conceived in a spirit of paternal stringency and proceed throughout
on the hypothesis that poor Jack is an imbecile and the other parties
to the contract rogues and ruffians A long and wordy paper of
precautions a focsle bill of rights must be read separately to each
man I had now the benefit of hearing it five times in brisk succession
and you would suppose I was acquainted with its contents But the
commissioner worthy man spends his days in doing little else and when
we bear in mind the parallel case of the irreverent curate we need not
be surprised that he took the passage tempo prestissimo in one roulade
of gabblethat I with the trained attention of an educated man
could gather but a fraction of its importand the sailors nothing
No profanity in giving orders no sheathknives Midway Island and any
other port the master may direct not to exceed six calendar months
and to this port to be paid off so it seemed to run with surprising
verbiage so ended And with the end the commissioner in each case
fetched a deep breath resumed his natural voice and proceeded to
business Now my man he would say you ship A B at so many
dollars American gold coin Sign your name here if you have one and
can write Whereupon and the name with infinite hard breathing being
signed the commissioner would proceed to fill in the mans appearance
height etc on the official form In this task of literary portraiture
he seemed to rely wholly upon temperament for I could not perceive him
to cast one glance on any of his models He was assisted however by a
running commentary from the captain Hair blue and eyes red nose
five foot seven and stature brokenjests as old presumably as the
American marine and like the similar pleasantries of the billiard
board perennially relished The highest note of humour was reached in
the case of the Chinese cook who was shipped under the name of One
Lung to the sound of his own protests and the selfapproving chuckles
of the functionary

Now captain said the latter when the men were gone and he had
bundled up his papers the law requires you to carry a slopchest and a
chest of medicines

I guess I know that said Nares

I guess you do returned the commissioner and helped himself to port

But when he was gone I appealed to Nares on the same subject for I was
well aware we carried none of these provisions

Well drawled Nares theres sixty pounds of niggerhead on the quay
isnt there and twenty pounds of salts and I never travel without some
painkiller in my gripsack

As a matter of fact we were richer The captain had the usual sailors
provision of quack medicines with which in the usual sailor fashion
he would daily drug himself displaying an extreme inconstancy and
flitting from Kennedys Red Discovery to Kennedys White and from
Hoods Sarsaparilla to Mother Seigels Syrup And there were besides
some mildewed and halfempty bottles the labels obliterated over
which Nares would sometimes sniff and speculate Seems to smell like
diarrhoea stuff he would remark I wisht I knew and I would
try it But the slopchest was indeed represented by the plugs of
niggerhead and nothing else Thus paternal laws are made thus they
are evaded and the schooner put to sea like plenty of her neighbours
liable to a fine of six hundred dollars

This characteristic scene which has delayed me overlong was but a
moment in that day of exercise and agitation To fit out a schooner for
sea and improvise a marriage between dawn and dusk involves heroic
effort All day Jim and I ran and tramped and laughed and came near
crying and fell in sudden anxious consultations and were sped with
a prepared sarcasm on our lips to some fallacious milliner and made
dashes to the schooner and John Smiths and at every second corner
were reminded by our own huge posters of our desperate estate Between
whiles I had found the time to hover at some halfadozen jewellers
windows and my present thus intemperately chosen was graciously
accepted I believe indeed that was the last though not the least of
my concerns before the old minister shabby and benign was routed from
his house and led to the office like a performing poodle and there in
the growing dusk under the cold glitter of Thirteen Star two hundred
strong and beside the garish glories of the agricultural engine Mamie
and Jim were made one The scene was incongruous but the business
pretty whimsical and affecting the typewriters with such kindly faces
and fine posies Mamie so demure and Jimhow shall I describe that
poor transfigured Jim He began by taking the minister aside to the far
end of the office I knew not what he said but I have reason to believe
he was protesting his unfitness for he wept as he said it and the old
minister himself genuinely moved was heard to console and encourage
him and at one time to use this expression I assure you Mr
Pinkerton there are not many who can say so muchfrom which I
gathered that my friend had tempered his selfaccusations with at least
one legitimate boast From this ghostly counselling Jim turned to me
and though he never got beyond the explosive utterance of my name and
one fierce handgrip communicated some of his own emotion like a charge
of electricity to his best man We stood up to the ceremony at last
in a general and kindly discomposure Jim was all abroad and the divine
himself betrayed his sympathy in voice and demeanour and concluded with
a fatherly allocution in which he congratulated Mamie calling her my
dear upon the fortune of an excellent husband and protested he had
rarely married a more interesting couple At this stage like a glory
descending there was handed in ex machina the card of Douglas B
Longhurst with congratulations and four dozen PerrierJouet A bottle
was opened and the minister pledged the bride and the bridesmaids
simpered and tasted and I made a speech with airy bacchanalianism
glass in hand But poor Jim must leave the wine untasted Dont touch
it I had found the opportunity to whisper in your state it will make
you as drunk as a fiddler And Jim had wrung my hand with a God bless
you Loudonsaved me again

Hard following upon this the supper passed off at Franks with somewhat
tremulous gaiety And thence with one half of the PerrierJouetI
would accept no morewe voyaged in a hack to the Norah Creina

What a dear little ship cried Mamie as our miniature craft was
pointed out to her And then on second thought she turned to the best
man And how brave you must be Mr Dodd she cried to go in that
tiny thing so far upon the ocean And I perceived I had risen in the
ladys estimation

The dear little ship presented a horrid picture of confusion and its
occupants of weariness and illhumour From the cabin the cook was
storing tins into the lazarette and the four hands sweaty and sullen
were passing them from one to another from the waist Johnson was three
parts asleep over the table and in his bunk in his own cabin the
captain sourly chewed and puffed at a cigar

See here he said rising youll be sorry you came We cant stop
work if were to get away tomorrow A ship getting ready for sea is no
place for people anyway Youll only interrupt my men

I was on the point of answering something tart but Jim who was
acquainted with the breed as he was with most things that had a bearing
on affairs made haste to pour in oil

Captain he said I know were a nuisance here and that youve had
a rough time But all we want is that you should drink one glass of wine
with us PerrierJouet from Longhurst on the occasion of my marriage
and LoudonsMr Doddsdeparture

Well its your lookout said Nares I dont mind half an hour
Spell O he added to the men go and kick your heels for half an
hour and then you can turn to again a trifle livelier Johnson see if
you cant wipe off a chair for the lady

His tone was no more gracious than his language but when Mamie had
turned upon him the soft fire of her eyes and informed him that he was
the first seacaptain she had ever met except captains of steamers
of courseshe so qualified the statementand had expressed a lively
sense of his courage and perhaps implied for I suppose the arts of
ladies are the same as those of men a modest consciousness of his good
looks our bear began insensibly to soften and it was already part
as an apology though still with unaffected heat of temper that he
volunteered some sketch of his annoyances

A pretty mess weve had said he Half the stores were wrong Ill
wring John Smiths neck for him some of these days Then two newspaper
beasts came down and tried to raise copy out of me till I threatened
them with the first thing handy and then some kind of missionary bug
wanting to work his passage to Raiatea or somewhere I told him I would
take him off the wharf with the butt end of my boot and he went away
cursing This vessels been depreciated by the look of him

While the captain spoke with his strange humorous arrogant
abruptness I observed Jim to be sizing him up like a thing at once
quaint and familiar and with a scrutiny that was both curious and
knowing

One word dear boy he said turning suddenly to me And when he had
drawn me on deck That man says he will carry sail till your hair
grows white but never you let on never breathe a word I know his
line hell die before hell take advice and if you get his back up
hell run you right under I dont often jam in my advice Loudon and
when I do it means Im thoroughly posted

The little party in the cabin so disastrously begun finished under
the mellowing influence of wine and woman in excellent feeling and
with some hilarity Mamie in a plush Gainsborough hat and a gown of
winecoloured silk sat an apparent queen among her rude surroundings
and companions The dusky litter of the cabin set off her radiant
trimness tarry Johnson was a foil to her fair beauty she glowed in
that poor place fair as a star until even I who was not usually of
her admirers caught a spark of admiration and even the captain who
was in no courtly humour proposed that the scene should be commemorated
by my pencil It was the last act of the evening Hurriedly as I went
about my task the halfhour had lengthened out to more than three
before it was completed Mamie in full value the rest of the party
figuring in outline only and the artist himself introduced in a back
view which was pronounced a likeness But it was to Mamie that I
devoted the best of my attention and it was with her I made my chief
success

O she cried am I really like that No wonder Jim  She paused
Why its just as lovely as hes good she cried an epigram which was
appreciated and repeated as we made our salutations and called out
after the retreating couple as they passed away under the lamplight on
the wharf

Thus it was that our farewells were smuggled through under an ambuscade
of laughter and the parting over ere I knew it was begun The figures
vanished the steps died away along the silent city front on board the
men had returned to their labours the captain to his solitary cigar
and after that long and complex day of business and emotion I was at
last alone and free It was perhaps chiefly fatigue that made my heart
so heavy I leaned at least upon the house and stared at the foggy
heaven or over the rail at the wavering reflection of the lamps like a
man that was quite done with hope and would have welcomed the asylum of
the grave And all at once as I thus stood the City of Pekin flashed
into my mind racing her thirteen knots for Honolulu with the hated
Trentperhaps with the mysterious Goddedaalon board and with the
thought the blood leaped and careered through all my body It seemed no
chase at all it seemed we had no chance as we lay there bound to iron
pillars and fooling away the precious moments over tins of beans Let
them get there first I thought Let them We cant be long behind
And from that moment I date myself a man of a rounded experience
nothing had lacked but this that I should entertain and welcome the
grim thought of bloodshed

It was long before the toil remitted in the cabin and it was worth
my while to get to bed long after that before sleep favoured me
and scarce a moment later or so it seemed when I was recalled to
consciousness by bawling men and the jar of straining hawsers

The schooner was cast off before I got on deck In the misty obscurity
of the first dawn I saw the tug heading us with glowing fires and
blowing smoke and heard her beat the roughened waters of the bay
Beside us on her flock of hills the lighted city towered up and
stood swollen in the raw fog It was strange to see her burn on thus
wastefully with halfquenched luminaries when the dawn was already
grown strong enough to show me and to suffer me to recognise a
solitary figure standing by the piles

Or was it really the eye and not rather the heart that identified that
shadow in the dusk among the shoreside lamps I know not It was Jim
at least Jim come for a last look and we had but time to wave a
valedictory gesture and exchange a wordless cry This was our second
parting and our capacities were now reversed It was mine to play the
Argonaut to speed affairs to plan and to accomplishif need were at
the price of life it was his to sit at home to study the calendar and
to wait I knew besides another thing that gave me joy I knew that my
friend had succeeded in my education that the romance of business
if our fantastic purchase merited the name had at last stirred my
dilletante nature and as we swept under cloudy Tamalpais and through
the roaring narrows of the bay the Yankee blood sang in my veins with
suspense and exultation

Outside the heads as if to meet my desire we found it blowing fresh
from the northeast No time had been lost The sun was not yet up before
the tug cast off the hawser gave us a salute of three whistles and
turned homeward toward the coast which now began to gleam along its
margin with the earliest rays of day There was no other ship in view
when the Norah Creina lying over under all plain sail began her long
and lonely voyage to the wreck




CHAPTER XII THE NORAH CREINA


I love to recall the glad monotony of a Pacific voyage when the trades
are not stinted and the ship day after day goes free The mountain
scenery of tradewind clouds watched and in my case painted under
every vicissitude of lightblotting stars withering in the moons
glory barring the scarlet eve lying across the dawn collapsed into the
unfeatured morning bank or at noon raising their snowy summits between
the blue roof of heaven and the blue floor of sea the small busy
and deliberate world of the schooner with its unfamiliar scenes the
spearing of dolphin from the bowsprit end the holy war on sharks
the cook making bread on the main hatch reefing down before a violent
squall with the men hanging out on the footropes the squall itself
the catch at the heart the opened sluices of the sky and the relief
the renewed loveliness of life when all is over the sun forth again
and our outfought enemy only a blot upon the leeward sea I love to
recall and would that I could reproduce that life the unforgettable
the unrememberable The memory which shows so wise a backwardness
in registering pain is besides an imperfect recorder of extended
pleasures and a longcontinued wellbeing escapes as it were by its
mass our petty methods of commemoration On a part of our lifes map
there lies a roseate undecipherable haze and that is all

Of one thing if I am at all to trust my own annals I was delightedly
conscious Day after day in the sungilded cabin the whiskeydealers
thermometer stood at 84 Day after day the air had the same
indescribable liveliness and sweetness soft and nimble and cool as
the cheek of health Day after day the sun flamed night after night the
moon beaconed or the stars paraded their lustrous regiment I was aware
of a spiritual change or perhaps rather a molecular reconstitution
My bones were sweeter to me I had come home to my own climate and
looked back with pity on those damp and wintry zones miscalled the
temperate

Two years of this and comfortable quarters to live in kind of shake
the grit out of a man the captain remarked cant make out to be
happy anywhere else A townie of mine was lost down this way in a
coalship that took fire at sea He struck the beach somewhere in the
Navigators and he wrote to me that when he left the place it would be
feet first Hes well off too and his father owns some coasting
craft Down East but Billy prefers the beach and hot rolls off the
breadfruit trees

A voice told me I was on the same track as Billy But when was this Our
outward track in the Norah Creina lay well to the northward and perhaps
it is but the impression of a few pet days which I have unconsciously
spread longer or perhaps the feeling grew upon me later in the run to
Honolulu One thing I am sure it was before I had ever seen an island
worthy of the name that I must date my loyalty to the South Seas The
blank sea itself grew desirable under such skies and wherever the
tradewind blows I know no better country than a schooners deck

But for the tugging anxiety as to the journeys end the journey itself
must thus have counted for the best of holidays My physical wellbeing
was overproof effects of sea and sky kept me for ever busy with my
pencil and I had no lack of intellectual exercise of a different order
in the study of my inconsistent friend the captain I call him friend
here on the threshold but that is to look well ahead At first I
was too much horrified by what I considered his barbarities too much
puzzled by his shifting humours and too frequently annoyed by his small
vanities to regard him otherwise than as the cross of my existence It
was only by degrees in his rare hours of pleasantness when he forgot
and made me forget the weaknesses to which he was so prone that he
won me to a kind of unconsenting fondness Lastly the faults were
all embraced in a more generous view I saw them in their place like
discords in a musical progression and accepted them and found them
picturesque as we accept and admire in the habitable face of nature
the smoky head of the volcano or the pernicious thicket of the swamp

He was come of good people Down East and had the beginnings of a
thorough education His temper had been ungovernable from the first and
it is likely the defect was inherited and the blame of the rupture
not entirely his He ran away at least to sea suffered horrible
maltreatment which seemed to have rather hardened than enlightened him
ran away again to shore in a South American port proved his capacity
and made money although still a child fell among thieves and was
robbed worked back a passage to the States and knocked one morning
at the door of an old lady whose orchard he had often robbed The
introduction appears insufficient but Nares knew what he was doing
The sight of her old neighbourly depredator shivering at the door in
tatters the very oddity of his appeal touched a soft spot in the
spinsters heart I always had a fancy for the old lady Nares said
even when she used to stampede me out of the orchard and shake her
thimble and her old curls at me out of the window as I was going by I
always thought she was a kind of pleasant old girl Well when she came
to the door that morning I told her so and that I was stonebroke and
she took me right in and fetched out the pie She clothed him taught
him and had him to sea again in better shape welcomed him to her
hearth on his return from every cruise and when she died bequeathed him
her possessions She was a good old girl he would say I tell you
Mr Dodd it was a queer thing to see me and the old lady talking a
pasear in the garden and the old man scowling at us over the pickets
She lived right next door to the old man and I guess thats just what
took me there I wanted him to know that I was badly beat you see and
would rather go to the devil than to him What made the dig harder he
had quarrelled with the old lady about me and the orchard I guess that
made him rage Yes I was a beast when I was young But I was always
pretty good to the old lady Since then he had prospered not
uneventfully in his profession the old ladys money had fallen in
during the voyage of the Gleaner and he was now as soon as the smoke
of that engagement cleared away secure of his ship I suppose he was
about thirty a powerful active man with a blue eye a thick head
of hair about the colour of oakum and growing low over the brow
cleanshaved and lean about the jaw a good singer a good performer on
that seainstrument the accordion a quick observer a close reasoner
when he pleased of a really elegant address and when he chose the
greatest brute upon the seas

His usage of the men his hazing his bullying his perpetual
faultfinding for no cause his perpetual and brutal sarcasm might have
raised a mutiny in a slave galley Suppose the steersmans eye to have
wandered You   little muttonfaced Dutchman Nares would
bawl you want a booting to keep you on your course I know a little
cityfront slush when I see one Just you glue your eye to that compass
or Ill show you round the vessel at the buttend of my boot Or
suppose a hand to linger aft whither he had perhaps been summoned not
a minute before Mr Daniells will you oblige me by stepping clear
of that mainsheet the captain might begin with truculent courtesy
Thank you And perhaps youll be so kind as to tell me what the hell
youre doing on my quarterdeck I want no dirt of your sort here Is
there nothing for you to do Wheres the mate Dont you set ME to find
work for you or Ill find you some that will keep you on your back a
fortnight Such allocutions conceived with a perfect knowledge of his
audience so that every insult carried home were delivered with a mien
so menacing and an eye so fiercely cruel that his unhappy subordinates
shrank and quailed Too often violence followed too often I have heard
and seen and boiled at the cowardly aggression and the victim his
hands bound by law has risen again from deck and crawled forward
stupefiedI know not what passion of revenge in his wronged heart

It seems strange I should have grown to like this tyrant It may even
seem strange that I should have stood by and suffered his excesses to
proceed But I was not quite such a chicken as to interfere in public
for I would rather have a man or two mishandled than one half of
us butchered in a mutiny and the rest suffer on the gallows And in
private I was unceasing in my protests

Captain I once said to him appealing to his patriotism which was
of a hardy quality this is no way to treat American seamen You dont
call it American to treat men like dogs

Americans he said grimly Do you call these Dutchmen and
Scattermouches 1 Americans Ive been fourteen years to sea all but
one trip under American colours and Ive never laid eye on an American
foremast hand There used to be such things in the old days when
thirtyfive dollars were the wages out of Boston and then you could see
ships handled and run the way they want to be But thats all past and
gone and nowadays the only thing that flies in an American ship is a
belayingpin You dont know you havent a guess How would you like to
go on deck for your middle watch fourteen months on end with all your
duty to do and every ones life depending on you and expect to get
a knife ripped into you as you come out of your stateroom or be
sandbagged as you pass the boat or get tripped into the hold if the
hatches are off in fine weather That kind of shakes the starch out of
the brotherly love and New Jerusalem business You go through the mill
and youll have a bigger grudge against every old shellback that dirties
his plate in the three oceans than the Bank of California could settle
up No it has an ugly look to it but the only way to run a ship is to
make yourself a terror

1 In sealingo Pacific DUTCHMAN includes all Teutons and folk from
the basin of the Baltic SCATTERMOUCH all Latins and Levantines

Come Captain said I there are degrees in everything You know
American ships have a bad name you know perfectly well if it wasnt for
the high wage and the good food theres not a man would ship in one if
he could help and even as it is some prefer a British ship beastly
food and all

O the limejuicers said he Theres plenty booting in limejuicers
I guess though I dont deny but what some of them are soft And with
that he smiled like a man recalling something Look here that brings
a yarn in my head he resumed and for the sake of the joke Ill give
myself away It was in 1874 I shipped mate in the British ship Maria
from Frisco for Melbourne She was the queerest craft in some ways that
ever I was aboard of The food was a caution there was nothing fit
to put your lips tobut the limejuice which was from the end bin no
doubt it used to make me sick to see the mens dinners and sorry to
see my own The old man was good enough I guess Green was his name
a mild fatherly old galoot But the hands were the lowest gang I ever
handled and whenever I tried to knock a little spirit into them the
old man took their part It was Gilbert and Sullivan on the high seas
but you bet I wouldnt let any man dictate to me You give me your
orders Captain Green I said and youll find Ill carry them out
thats all youve got to say Youll find I do my duty I said how
I do it is my lookout and theres no man born thats going to give
me lessons Well there was plenty dirt on board that Maria first and
last Of course the old man put my back up and of course he put up
the crews and I had to regular fight my way through every watch The
men got to hate me sos I would hear them grit their teeth when I came
up At last one day I saw a big hulking beast of a Dutchman booting
the ships boy I made one shoot of it off the house and laid that
Dutchman out Up he came and I laid him out again Now I said if
theres a kick left in you just mention it and Ill stamp your ribs
in like a packingcase He thought better of it and never let on
lay there as mild as a deacon at a funeral and they took him below to
reflect on his native Dutchland One night we got caught in rather a
dirty thing about 25 south I guess we were all asleep for the first
thing I knew there was the foreroyal gone I ran forward bawling blue
hell and just as I came by the foremast something struck me right
through the forearm and stuck there I put my other hand up and by
George it was the grain the beasts had speared me like a porpoise
Capn I criedWhats wrong says heTheyve grained me says
IGrained you says he Well Ive been looking for thatAnd
by God I cried I want to have some of these beasts murdered for
itNow Mr Nares says he you better go below If I had been one
of the men youd have got more than this And I want no more of your
language on deck Youve cost me my foreroyal already says he and
if you carry on youll have the three sticks out of her That was old
man Greens idea of supporting officers But you wait a bit the creams
coming We made Melbourne right enough and the old man said Mr
Nares you and me dont draw together Youre a firstrate seaman no
mistake of that but youre the most disagreeable man I ever sailed
with and your language and your conduct to the crew I cannot stomach
I guess well separate I didnt care about the berth you may be sure
but I felt kind of mean and if he made one kind of stink I thought
I could make another So I said I would go ashore and see how things
stood went found I was all right and came aboard again on the top
railAre you getting your traps together Mr Nares says the old
manNo says I I dont know as well separate much before Frisco
at least I said its a point for your consideration Im very
willing to say goodby to the Maria but I dont know whether youll
care to start me out with three months wages He got his moneybox
right away My son says he I think it cheap at the money He had
me there


It was a singular tale for a man to tell of himself above all in the
midst of our discussion but it was quite in character for Nares I
never made a good hit in our disputes I never justly resented any act
or speech of his but what I found it long after carefully posted in his
daybook and reckoned here was the mans oddity to my credit It was
the same with his father whom he had hated he would give a sketch of
the old fellow frank and credible and yet so honestly touched that
it was charming I have never met a man so strangely constituted to
possess a reason of the most equal justice to have his nerves at the
same time quivering with petty spite and to act upon the nerves and not
the reason

A kindred wonder in my eyes was the nature of his courage There was
never a braver man he went out to welcome danger an emergency came it
never so sudden strung him like a tonic And yet upon the other hand
I have known none so nervous so oppressed with possibilities looking
upon the world at large and the life of a sailor in particular with
so constant and haggard a consideration of the ugly chances All
his courage was in blood not merely cold but icy with reasoned
apprehension He would lay our little craft rail under and hang on in
a squall until I gave myself up for lost and the men were rushing
to their stations of their own accord There he would say I guess
theres not a man on board would have hung on as long as I did that
time theyll have to give up thinking me no schooner sailor I guess
I can shave just as near capsizing as any other captain of this vessel
drunk or sober And then he would fall to repining and wishing himself
well out of the enterprise and dilate on the peril of the seas the
particular dangers of the schooner rig which he abhorred the various
ways in which we might go to the bottom and the prodigious fleet of
ships that have sailed out in the course of history dwindled from the
eyes of watchers and returned no more Well he would wind up I
guess it dont much matter I cant see what any one wants to live for
anyway If I could get into some one elses appletree and be about
twelve years old and just stick the way I was eating stolen apples I
wont say But theres no sense in this grownup businesssailorising
politics the piety mill and all the rest of it Good clean drowning is
good enough for me It is hard to imagine any more depressing talk for
a poor landsman on a dirty night it is hard to imagine anything less
sailorlike as sailors are supposed to be and generally are than this
persistent harping on the minor


But I was to see more of the mans gloomy constancy ere the cruise was
at an end

On the morning of the seventeenth day I came on deck to find the
schooner under double reefs and flying rather wild before a heavy run
of sea Snoring trades and humming sails had been our portion hitherto
We were already nearing the island My restrained excitement had begun
again to overmaster me and for some time my only book had been the
patent log that trailed over the taffrail and my chief interest the
daily observation and our caterpillar progress across the chart My
first glance which was at the compass and my second which was at the
log were all that I could wish We lay our course we had been doing
over eight since nine the night before and I drew a heavy breath of
satisfaction And then I know not what odd and wintry appearance of the
sea and sky knocked suddenly at my heart I observed the schooner
to look more than usually small the men silent and studious of the
weather Nares in one of his rusty humours afforded me no shadow of a
morning salutation He too seemed to observe the behaviour of the ship
with an intent and anxious scrutiny What I liked still less Johnson
himself was at the wheel which he span busily often with a visible
effort and as the seas ranged up behind us black and imminent he kept
casting behind him eyes of animal swiftness and drawing in his neck
between his shoulders like a man dodging a blow From these signs I
gathered that all was not exactly for the best and I would have given
a good handful of dollars for a plain answer to the questions which
I dared not put Had I dared with the present danger signal in the
captains face I should only have been reminded of my position as
supercargoan office never touched upon in kindnessand advised in
a very indigestible manner to go below There was nothing for it
therefore but to entertain my vague apprehensions as best I should be
able until it pleased the captain to enlighten me of his own accord
This he did sooner than I had expected as soon indeed as the Chinaman
had summoned us to breakfast and we sat face to face across the narrow
board

See here Mr Dodd he began looking at me rather queerly here is a
business point arisen This seas been running up for the last two days
and now its too high for comfort The glass is falling the wind is
breezing up and I wont say but what theres dirt in it If I lay her
to we may have to ride out a gale of wind and drift God knows whereon
these French Frigate Shoals for instance If I keep her as she goes
well make that island tomorrow afternoon and have the lee of it to
lie under if we cant make out to run in The point you have to figure
on is whether youll take the big chances of that Captain Trent making
the place before you or take the risk of something happening Im
to run this ship to your satisfaction he added with an ugly sneer
Well heres a point for the supercargo

Captain I returned with my heart in my mouth risk is better than
certain failure

Life is all risk Mr Dodd he remarked But theres one thing its
now or never in half an hour Archdeacon Gabriel couldnt lay her to
if he came down stairs on purpose

All right said I Lets run

Run goes said he and with that he fell to breakfast and passed half
an hour in stowing away pie and devoutly wishing himself back in San
Francisco

When we came on deck again he took the wheel from Johnsonit appears
they could trust none among the handsand I stood close beside him
feeling safe in this proximity and tasting a fearful joy from our
surroundings and the consciousness of my decision The breeze had
already risen and as it tore over our heads it uttered at times a
long hooting note that sent my heart into my boots The sea pursued
us without remission leaping to the assault of the low rail The
quarterdeck was all awash and we must close the companion doors

And all this if you please for Mr Pinkertons dollars the captain
suddenly exclaimed Theres many a fine fellow gone under Mr Dodd
because of drivers like your friend What do they care for a ship or
two Insured I guess What do they care for sailors lives alongside
of a few thousand dollars What they want is speed between ports and
a damned fool of a captain thatll drive a ship under as Im doing this
one You can put in the morning asking why I do it

I sheered off to another part of the vessel as fast as civility
permitted This was not at all the talk that I desired nor was the
train of reflection which it started anyway welcome Here I was running
some hazard of my life and perilling the lives of seven others exactly
for what end I was now at liberty to ask myself For a very large
amount of a very deadly poison was the obvious answer and I thought
if all tales were true and I were soon to be subjected to
crossexamination at the bar of Eternal Justice it was one which would
not increase my popularity with the court Well never mind Jim
thought I Im doing it for you

Before eleven a third reef was taken in the mainsail and Johnson
filled the cabin with a stormsail of No 1 duck and sat crosslegged
on the streaming floor vigorously putting it to rights with a couple of
the hands By dinner I had fled the deck and sat in the bench corner
giddy dumb and stupefied with terror The frightened leaps of the
poor Norah Creina spanking like a stag for bare existence bruised me
between the table and the berths Overhead the wild huntsman of the
storm passed continuously in one blare of mingled noises screaming
wind straining timber lashing ropes end pounding block and bursting
sea contributed and I could have thought there was at times another a
more piercing a more human note that dominated all like the wailing
of an angel I could have thought I knew the angels name and that his
wings were black It seemed incredible that any creature of mans art
could long endure the barbarous mishandling of the seas kicked as the
schooner was from mountain side to mountain side beaten and blown upon
and wrenched in every joint and sinew like a child upon the rack There
was not a plank of her that did not cry aloud for mercy and as she
continued to hold together I became conscious of a growing sympathy
with her endeavours a growing admiration for her gallant staunchness
that amused and at times obliterated my terrors for myself God bless
every man that swung a mallet on that tiny and strong hull It was not
for wages only that he laboured but to save mens lives

All the rest of the day and all the following night I sat in the
corner or lay wakeful in my bunk and it was only with the return of
morning that a new phase of my alarms drove me once more on deck A
gloomier interval I never passed Johnson and Nares steadily relieved
each other at the wheel and came below The first glance of each was
at the glass which he repeatedly knuckled and frowned upon for it was
sagging lower all the time Then if Johnson were the visitor he would
pick a snack out of the cupboard and stand braced against the table
eating it and perhaps obliging me with a word or two of his heehaw
conversation how it was a son of a gun of a cold night on deck Mr
Dodd with a grin how it wasnt no night for panjammers he could
tell me having transacted all which he would throw himself down
in his bunk and sleep his two hours with compunction But the captain
neither ate nor slept You there Mr Dodd he would say after the
obligatory visit to the glass Well my son were one hundred and four
miles or whatever it was off the island and scudding for all were
worth Well make it tomorrow about four or not as the case may be
Thats the news And now Mr Dodd Ive stretched a point for you
you can see Im dead tired so just you stretch away back to your bunk
again And with this attempt at geniality his teeth would settle
hard down on his cigar and he would pass his spell below staring and
blinking at the cabin lamp through a cloud of tobacco smoke He has
told me since that he was happy which I should never have divined You
see he said the wind we had was never anything out of the way but
the sea was really nasty the schooner wanted a lot of humouring and
it was clear from the glass that we were close to some dirt We might
be running out of it or we might be running right crack into it Well
theres always something sublime about a big deal like that and it kind
of raises a man in his own liking Were a queer kind of beasts Mr
Dodd

The morning broke with sinister brightness the air alarmingly
transparent the sky pure the rim of the horizon clear and strong
against the heavens The wind and the wild seas now vastly swollen
indefatigably hunted us I stood on deck choking with fear I seemed
to lose all power upon my limbs my knees were as paper when she plunged
into the murderous valleys my heart collapsed when some black mountain
fell in avalanche beside her counter and the water that was more than
spray swept round my ankles like a torrent I was conscious of but
one strong desire to bear myself decently in my terrors and whatever
should happen to my life preserve my character as the captain said
we are a queer kind of beasts Breakfast time came and I made shift
to swallow some hot tea Then I must stagger below to take the time
reading the chronometer with dizzy eyes and marvelling the while what
value there could be in observations taken in a ship launched as ours
then was like a missile among flying seas The forenoon dragged on in
a grinding monotony of peril every spoke of the wheel a rash but an
obliged experimentrash as a forlorn hope needful as the leap that
lands a fireman from a burning staircase Noon was made the captain
dined on his days work and I on watching him and our place was
entered on the chart with a meticulous precision which seemed to me
half pitiful and half absurd since the next eye to behold that sheet of
paper might be the eye of an exploring fish One oclock came then two
the captain gloomed and chafed as he held to the coaming of the house
and if ever I saw dormant murder in mans eye it was in his God help
the hand that should have disobeyed him

Of a sudden he turned towards the mate who was doing his trick at the
wheel

Two points on the port bow I heard him say And he took the wheel
himself

Johnson nodded wiped his eyes with the back of his wet hand watched a
chance as the vessel lunged up hill and got to the main rigging where
he swarmed aloft Up and up I watched him go hanging on at every
ugly plunge gaining with every lull of the schooners movement until
clambering into the crosstrees and clinging with one arm around the
masts I could see him take one comprehensive sweep of the southwesterly
horizon The next moment he had slid down the backstay and stood on
deck with a grin a nod and a gesture of the finger that said yes
the next again and he was back sweating and squirming at the wheel his
tired face streaming and smiling and his hair and the rags and corners
of his clothes lashing round him in the wind

Nares went below fetched up his binocular and fell into a silent
perusal of the sealine I also with my unaided eyesight Little by
little in that white waste of water I began to make out a quarter
where the whiteness appeared more condensed the sky above was whitish
likewise and misty like a squall and little by little there thrilled
upon my ears a note deeper and more terrible than the yelling of the
galethe long thundering roll of breakers Nares wiped his night glass
on his sleeve and passed it to me motioning as he did so with his
hand An endless wilderness of raging billows came and went and danced
in the circle of the glass now and then a pale corner of sky or the
strong line of the horizon rugged with the heads of waves and then of
a suddencome and gone ere I could fix it with a swallows
swiftnessone glimpse of what we had come so far and paid so dear to
see the masts and rigging of a brig pencilled on heaven with an ensign
streaming at the main and the ragged ribbons of a topsail thrashing
from the yard Again and again with toilful searching I recalled that
apparition There was no sign of any land the wreck stood between sea
and sky a thing the most isolated I had ever viewed but as we drew
nearer I perceived her to be defended by a line of breakers which drew
off on either hand and marked indeed the nearest segment of the reef
Heavy spray hung over them like a smoke some hundred feet into the air
and the sound of their consecutive explosions rolled like a cannonade

In half an hour we were close in for perhaps as long again we skirted
that formidable barrier toward its farther side and presently the sea
began insensibly to moderate and the ship to go more sweetly We had
gained the lee of the island as for forms sake I may call that ring
of foam and haze and thunder and shaking out a reef wore ship and
headed for the passage




CHAPTER XIII THE ISLAND AND THE WRECK


All hands were filled with joy It was betrayed in their alacrity and
easy faces Johnson smiling broadly at the wheel Nares studying the
sketch chart of the island with an eye at peace and the hands clustered
forward eagerly talking and pointing so manifest was our escape so
wonderful the attraction of a single foot of earth after so many suns
had set and risen on an empty sea To add to the relief besides by one
of those malicious coincidences which suggest for fate the image of an
underbred and grinning schoolboy we had no sooner worn ship than the
wind began to abate

For myself however I did but exchange anxieties I was no sooner out
of one fear than I fell upon another no sooner secure that I should
myself make the intended haven than I began to be convinced that Trent
was there before me I climbed into the rigging stood on the board and
eagerly scanned that ring of coral reef and bursting breaker and the
blue lagoon which they enclosed The two islets within began to show
plainlyMiddle Brooks and Lower Brooks Island the Directory named
them two low bushcovered rolling strips of sand each with
glittering beaches each perhaps a mile or a mile and a half in length
running east and west and divided by a narrow channel Over these
innumerable as maggots there hovered chattered screamed and clanged
millions of twinkling seabirds white and black the black by far the
largest With singular scintillations this vortex of winged life swayed
to and fro in the strong sunshine whirled continually through itself
and would now and again burst asunder and scatter as wide as the lagoon
so that I was irresistibly reminded of what I had read of nebular
convulsions A thin cloud overspread the area of the reef and the
adjacent seathe dust as I could not but fancy of earlier explosions
And a little apart there was yet another focus of centrifugal and
centripetal flight where hard by the deafening line of breakers her
sails all but the tattered topsail snugly furled down and the red rag
that marks Old England on the seas beating union down at the mainthe
Flying Scud the fruit of so many toilers a recollection in so many
lives of men whose tall spars had been mirrored in the remotest corners
of the sealay stationary at last and forever in the first stage of
naval dissolution Towards her the taut Norah Creina vulturewise
wriggled to windward come from so far to pick her bones And look as
I pleased there was no other presence of man or of mans handiwork
no Honolulu schooner lay there crowded with armed rivals no smoke rose
from the fire at which I fancied Trent cooking a meal of seabirds It
seemed after all we were in time and I drew a mighty breath

I had not arrived at this reviving certainty before the breakers were
already close aboard the leadsman at his station and the captain
posted in the fore crosstrees to con us through the coral lumps of the
lagoon All circumstances were in our favour the light behind the sun
low the wind still fresh and steady and the tide about the turn A
moment later we shot at racing speed betwixt two pier heads of broken
water the lead began to be cast the captain to bawl down his anxious
directions the schooner to tack and dodge among the scattered dangers
of the lagoon and at one bell in the first dog watch we had come
to our anchor off the northeast end of Middle Brooks Island in five
fathoms water The sails were gasketted and covered the boats emptied
of the miscellaneous stores and odds and ends of seafurniture that
accumulate in the course of a voyage the kedge sent ashore and the
decks tidied down a good threequarters of an hours work during
which I raged about the deck like a man with a strong toothache The
transition from the wild sea to the comparative immobility of the lagoon
had wrought strange distress among my nerves I could not hold still
whether in hand or foot the slowness of the men tired as dogs after
our rough experience outside irritated me like something personal and
the irrational screaming of the seabirds saddened me like a dirge It
was a relief when with Nares and a couple of hands I might drop into
the boat and move off at last for the Flying Scud

She looks kind of pitiful dont she observed the captain nodding
towards the wreck from which we were separated by some half a mile
Looks as if she didnt like her berth and Captain Trent had used her
badly Give her ginger boys he added to the hands and you can all
have shore liberty tonight to see the birds and paint the town red

We all laughed at the pleasantry and the boat skimmed the faster over
the rippling face of the lagoon The Flying Scud would have seemed small
enough beside the wharves of San Francisco but she was some thrice the
size of the Norah Creina which had been so long our continent and
as we craned up at her wallsides she impressed us with a mountain
magnitude She lay head to the reef where the huge blue wall of the
rollers was for ever ranging up and crumbling down and to gain her
starboard side we must pass below the stern The rudder was hard aport
and we could read the legend

 FLYING SCUD

 HULL

On the other side about the break of the poop some half a fathom of
rope ladder trailed over the rail and by this we made our entrance

She was a roomy ship inside with a raised poop standing some three feet
higher than the deck and a small forward house for the mens bunks and
the galley just abaft the foremast There was one boat on the house
and another and larger one in beds on deck on either hand of it She
had been painted white with tropical economy outside and in and we
found later on that the stanchions of the rail hoops of the scuttle
but etc were picked out with green At that time however when we
first stepped aboard all was hidden under the droppings of innumerable
seabirds

The birds themselves gyrated and screamed meanwhile among the rigging
and when we looked into the galley their outrush drove us back
Savagelooking fowl they were savagely beaked and some of the black
ones great as eagles Halfburied in the slush we were aware of a
litter of kegs in the waist and these on being somewhat cleaned
proved to be water beakers and quarter casks of mess beef with some
colonial brand doubtless collected there before the Tempest hove in
sight and while Trent and his men had no better expectation than to
strike for Honolulu in the boats Nothing else was notable on deck
save where the loose topsail had played some havoc with the rigging
and there hung and swayed and sang in the declining wind a raffle of
intorted cordage

With a shyness that was almost awe Nares and I descended the companion
The stair turned upon itself and landed us just forward of a thwartship
bulkhead that cut the poop in two The fore part formed a kind of
miscellaneous storeroom with a doublebunked division for the cook as
Nares supposed and second mate The after part contained in the midst
the main cabin running in a kind of bow into the curvature of the
stern on the port side a pantry opening forward and a stateroom for
the mate and on the starboard the captains berth and watercloset
Into these we did but glance the main cabin holding us It was dark
for the seabirds had obscured the skylight with their droppings it
smelt rank and fusty and it was beset with a loud swarm of flies that
beat continually in our faces Supposing them close attendants upon man
and his broken meat I marvelled how they had found their way to Midway
reef it was sure at least some vessel must have brought them and that
long ago for they had multiplied exceedingly Part of the floor was
strewn with a confusion of clothes books nautical instruments odds
and ends of finery and such trash as might be expected from the turning
out of several seamens chests upon a sudden emergency and after a
long cruise It was strange in that dim cabin quivering with the near
thunder of the breakers and pierced with the screaming of the fowls
to turn over so many things that other men had coveted and prized and
worn on their warm bodiesfrayed old underclothing pyjamas of strange
design duck suits in every stage of rustiness oil skins pilot coats
bottles of scent embroidered shirts jackets of Ponjee silkclothes
for the night watch at sea or the day ashore in the hotel verandah and
mingled among these books cigars fancy pipes quantities of
tobacco many keys a rusty pistol and a sprinkling of cheap
curiositiesBenares brass Chinese jars and pictures and bottles
of odd shells in cotton each designed no doubt for somebody at
homeperhaps in Hull of which Trent had been a native and his ship a
citizen

Thence we turned our attention to the table which stood spread as if
for a meal with stout ships crockery and the remains of fooda pot of
marmalade dregs of coffee in the mugs unrecognisable remains of
foods bread some toast and a tin of condensed milk The tablecloth
originally of a red colour was stained a dark brown at the captains
end apparently with coffee at the other end it had been folded back
and a pen and inkpot stood on the bare table Stools were here and
there about the table irregularly placed as though the meal had been
finished and the men smoking and chatting and one of the stools lay on
the floor broken

See they were writing up the log said Nares pointing to the
inkbottle Caught napping as usual I wonder if there ever was a
captain yet that lost a ship with his logbook up to date He generally
has about a month to fill up on a clean break like Charles Dickens
and his serial novelsWhat a regular limejuicer spread he added
contemptuously Marmaladeand toast for the old man Nasty slovenly
pigs

There was something in this criticism of the absent that jarred upon my
feelings I had no love indeed for Captain Trent or any of his vanished
gang but the desertion and decay of this once habitable cabin struck me
hard the death of mans handiwork is melancholy like the death of man
himself and I was impressed with an involuntary and irrational sense of
tragedy in my surroundings

This sickens me I said Lets go on deck and breathe

The captain nodded It IS kind of lonely isnt it he said But I
cant go up till I get the code signals I want to run up Got Left or
something just to brighten up this island home Captain Trent hasnt
been here yet but hell drop in before long and itll cheer him up to
see a signal on the brig

Isnt there some official expression we could use I asked vastly
taken by the fancy Sold for the benefit of the underwriters for
further particulars apply to J Pinkerton Montana Block SF

Well returned Nares I wont say but what an old navy quartermaster
might telegraph all that if you gave him a day to do it in and a pound
of tobacco for himself But its above my register I must try something
short and sweet KB urgent signal Heave all aback or LM urgent
The berth youre now in is not safe or what do you say to PQHTell
my owners the ship answers remarkably well

Its premature I replied but it seems calculated to give pain to
Trent PQH for me

The flags were found in Trents cabin neatly stored behind a lettered
grating Nares chose what he required and I following returned on
deck where the sun had already dipped and the dusk was coming

Here dont touch that you fool shouted the captain to one of the
hands who was drinking from the scuttle but That waters rotten

Beg pardon sir replied the man Tastes quite sweet

Let me see returned Nares and he took the dipper and held it to his
lips Yes its all right he said Must have rotted and come sweet
again Queer isnt it Mr Dodd Though Ive known the same on a Cape
Horner

There was something in his intonation that made me look him in the face
he stood a little on tiptoe to look right and left about the ship
like a man filled with curiosity and his whole expression and bearing
testified to some suppressed excitement

You dont believe what youre saying I broke out

O I dont know but what I do he replied laying a hand upon me
soothingly The things very possible Only Im bothered about
something else

And with that he called a hand gave him the code flags and stepped
himself to the main signal halliards which vibrated under the weight of
the ensign overhead A minute later the American colours which we had
brought in the boat replaced the English red and PQH was fluttering at
the fore

Now then said Nares who had watched the breaking out of his signal
with the oldmaidish particularity of an American sailor out with
those handspikes and lets see what water there is in the lagoon

The bars were shoved home the barbarous cacophony of the clanking pump
rose in the waist and streams of illsmelling water gushed on deck and
made valleys in the slab guano Nares leaned on the rail watching the
steady stream of bilge as though he found some interest in it


What is it that bothers you I asked

Well Ill tell you one thing shortly he replied But heres
another Do you see those boats there one on the house and two on the
beds Well where is the boat Trent lowered when he lost the hands

Got it aboard again I suppose said I

Well if youll tell me why returned the captain

Then it must have been another I suggested

She might have carried another on the main hatch I wont deny
admitted Nares but I cant see what she wanted with it unless it
was for the old man to go out and play the accordion in on moonlight
nights

It cant much matter anyway I reflected

O I dont suppose it does said he glancing over his shoulder at the
spouting of the scuppers

And how long are we to keep up this racket I asked Were simply
pumping up the lagoon Captain Trent himself said she had settled down
and was full forward

Did he said Nares with a significant dryness And almost as he spoke
the pumps sucked and sucked again and the men threw down their bars
There what do you make of that he asked Now Ill tell Mr Dodd
he went on lowering his voice but not shifting from his easy attitude
against the rail this ship is as sound as the Norah Creina I had a
guess of it before we came aboard and now I know

Its not possible I cried What do you make of Trent

I dont make anything of Trent I dont know whether hes a liar or
only an old wife I simply tell you whats the fact said Nares And
Ill tell you something more he added Ive taken the ground myself
in deepwater vessels I know what Im saying and I say that when
she first struck and before she bedded down seven or eight hours work
would have got this hooker off and theres no man that ever went two
years to sea but must have known it


I could only utter an exclamation

Nares raised his finger warningly Dont let THEM get hold of it said
he Think what you like but say nothing

I glanced round the dusk was melting into early night the twinkle of
a lantern marked the schooners position in the distance and our men
free from further labour stood grouped together in the waist their
faces illuminated by their glowing pipes

Why didnt Trent get her off inquired the captain Why did he want
to buy her back in Frisco for these fabulous sums when he might have
sailed her into the bay himself

Perhaps he never knew her value until then I suggested

I wish we knew her value now exclaimed Nares However I dont want
to depress you Im sorry for you Mr Dodd I know how bothering it
must be to you and the best I can says this I havent taken much
time getting down and now Im here I mean to work this thing in proper
style I just want to put your mind at rest you shall have no trouble
with me

There was something trusty and friendly in his voice and I found myself
gripping hands with him in that hard short shake that means so much
with Englishspeaking people

Well do old fellow said he Weve shaken down into pretty good
friends you and me and you wont find me working the business any the
less hard for that And now lets scoot for supper

After supper with the idle curiosity of the seafarer we pulled ashore
in a fine moonlight and landed on Middle Brooks Island A flat beach
surrounded it upon all sides and the midst was occupied by a thicket
of bushes the highest of them scarcely five feet high in which the
seafowl lived Through this we tried at first to strike but it were
easier to cross Trafalgar Square on a day of demonstration than to
invade these haunts of sleeping seabirds The nests sank and the eggs
burst under footing wings beat in our faces beaks menaced our eyes
our minds were confounded with the screeching and the coil spread over
the island and mounted high into the air


I guess well saunter round the beach said Nares when we had made
good our retreat

The hands were all busy after seabirds eggs so there were none to
follow us Our way lay on the crisp sand by the margin of the water on
one side the thicket from which we had been dislodged on the other
the face of the lagoon barred with a broad path of moonlight and
beyond that the line alternately dark and shining alternately hove
high and fallen prone of the external breakers The beach was strewn
with bits of wreck and drift some redwood and spruce logs no less than
two lower masts of junks and the sternpost of a European ship all
of which we looked on with a shade of serious concern speaking of the
dangers of the sea and the hard case of castaways In this sober vein we
made the greater part of the circuit of the island had a near view
of its neighbour from the southern end walked the whole length of the
westerly side in the shadow of the thicket and came forth again into
the moonlight at the opposite extremity

On our right at the distance of about half a mile the schooner lay
faintly heaving at her anchors About half a mile down the beach at
a spot still hidden from us by the thicket an upboiling of the birds
showed where the men were still with sailorlike insatiability
collecting eggs And right before us in a small indentation of the
sand we were aware of a boat lying high and dry and right side up

Nares crouched back into the shadow of the bushes

What the devils this he whispered

Trent I suggested with a beating heart

We were damned fools to come ashore unarmed said he But Ive got to
know where I stand In the shadow his face looked conspicuously white
and his voice betrayed a strong excitement He took his boats whistle
from his pocket In case I might want to play a tune said he grimly
and thrusting it between his teeth advanced into the moonlit open
which we crossed with rapid steps looking guiltily about us as we
went Not a leaf stirred and the boat when we came up to it offered
convincing proof of long desertion She was an eighteenfoot whaleboat
of the ordinary type equipped with oars and tholepins Two or three
quartercasks lay on the bilge amidships one of which must have been
broached and now stank horribly and these upon examination proved to
bear the same New Zealand brand as the beef on board the wreck

Well heres the boat said I heres one of your difficulties
cleared away

Hm said he There was a little water in the bilge and here he
stooped and tasted it

Fresh he said Only rainwater

You dont object to that I asked

No said he

Well then what ails you I cried

In plain United States Mr Dodd he returned a whaleboat five ash
sweeps and a barrel of stinking pork

Or in other words the whole thing I commented

Well its this way he condescended to explain Ive no use for a
fourth boat at all but a boat of this model tops the business I dont
say the types not common in these waters its as common as dirt the
traders carry them for surfboats But the Flying Scud a deepwater
tramp who was limejuicing around between big ports Calcutta and
Rangoon and Frisco and the Canton River No I dont see it

We were leaning over the gunwale of the boat as we spoke The captain
stood nearest the bow and he was idly playing with the trailing
painter when a thought arrested him He hauled the line in hand over
hand and stared and remained staring at the end

Anything wrong with it I asked

Do you know Mr Dodd said he in a queer voice this painters been
cut A sailor always seizes a ropes end but this is sliced short off
with the cold steel This wont do at all for the men he added Just
stand by till I fix it up more natural

Any guess what it all means I asked

Well it means one thing said he It means Trent was a liar I guess
the story of the Flying Scud was a sight more picturesque than he gave
out

Half an hour later the whaleboat was lying astern of the Norah Creina
and Nares and I sought our bunks silent and halfbewildered by our late
discoveries




CHAPTER XIV THE CABIN OF THE FLYING SCUD


The sun of the morrow had not cleared the morning bank the lake of the
lagoon the islets and the wall of breakers now beginning to subside
still lay clearly pictured in the flushed obscurity of early day when
we stepped again upon the deck of the Flying Scud Nares myself
the mate two of the hands and one dozen bright virgin axes in war
against that massive structure I think we all drew pleasurable breath
so profound in man is the instinct of destruction so engaging is the
interest of the chase For we were now about to taste in a supreme
degree the double joys of demolishing a toy and playing Hide the
handkerchief sports from which we had all perhaps desisted since the
days of infancy And the toy we were to burst in pieces was a deepsea
ship and the hidden good for which we were to hunt was a prodigious
fortune

The decks were washed down the main hatch removed and a guntackle
purchase rigged before the boat arrived with breakfast I had grown so
suspicious of the wreck that it was a positive relief to me to look
down into the hold and see it full or nearly full of undeniable rice
packed in the Chinese fashion in boluses of matting Breakfast over
Johnson and the hands turned to upon the cargo while Nares and I
having smashed open the skylight and rigged up a windsail on deck began
the work of rummaging the cabins

I must not be expected to describe our first days work or for that
matter any of the rest in order and detail as it occurred Such
particularity might have been possible for several officers and a draft
of men from a ship of war accompanied by an experienced secretary with
a knowledge of shorthand For two plain human beings unaccustomed to
the use of the broadaxe and consumed with an impatient greed of the
result the whole business melts in the retrospect into a nightmare
of exertion heat hurry and bewilderment sweat pouring from the face
like rain the scurry of rats the choking exhalations of the bilge and
the throbs and splinterings of the toiling axes I shall content myself
with giving the cream of our discoveries in a logical rather than a
temporal order though the two indeed practically coincided and we had
finished our exploration of the cabin before we could be certain of the
nature of the cargo

Nares and I began operations by tossing up pellmell through the
companion and piling in a squalid heap about the wheel all clothes
personal effects the crockery the carpet stale victuals tins of
meat and in a word all movables from the main cabin Thence we
transferred our attention to the captains quarters on the starboard
side Using the blankets for a basket we sent up the books
instruments and clothes to swell our growing midden on the deck and
then Nares going on hands and knees began to forage underneath
the bed Box after box of Manilla cigars rewarded his search I took
occasion to smash some of these boxes open and even to guillotine
the bundles of cigars but quite in vainno secret cache of opium
encouraged me to continue

I guess Ive got hold of the dicky now exclaimed Nares and turning
round from my perquisitions I found he had drawn forth a heavy iron
box secured to the bulkhead by chain and padlock On this he was now
gazing not with the triumph that instantly inflamed my own bosom but
with a somewhat foolish appearance of surprise

By George we have it now I cried and would have shaken hands with
my companion but he did not see or would not accept the salutation

Lets see whats in it first he remarked dryly And he adjusted the
box upon its side and with some blows of an axe burst the lock open
I threw myself beside him as he replaced the box on its bottom and
removed the lid I cannot tell what I expected a millions worth of
diamonds might perhaps have pleased me my cheeks burned my heart
throbbed to bursting and lo there was disclosed but a trayful of
papers neatly taped and a chequebook of the customary pattern I made
a snatch at the tray to see what was beneath but the captains hand
fell on mine heavy and hard

Now boss he cried not unkindly is this to be run shipshape or is
it a Dutch grabracket

And he proceeded to untie and run over the contents of the papers
with a serious face and what seemed an ostentation of delay Me and my
impatience it would appear he had forgotten for when he was quite done
he sat a while thinking whistled a bar or two refolded the papers
tied them up again and then and not before deliberately raised the
tray

I saw a cigarbox tied with a piece of fishingline and four fat
canvasbags Nares whipped out his knife cut the line and opened the
box It was about half full of sovereigns

And the bags I whispered

The captain ripped them open one by one and a flood of mixed silver
coin burst forth and rattled in the rusty bottom of the box Without a
word he set to work to count the gold

What is this I asked

Its the ships money he returned doggedly continuing his work

The ships money I repeated Thats the money Trent tramped and
traded with And theres his chequebook to draw upon his owners And he
has left it

I guess he has said Nares austerely jotting down a note of the
gold and I was abashed into silence till his task should be completed

It came I think to three hundred and seventyeight pounds sterling
some nineteen pounds of it in silver all of which we turned again into
the chest

And what do you think of that I asked

Mr Dodd he replied you see something of the rumness of this job
but not the whole The specie bothers you but what gets me is the
papers Are you aware that the master of a ship has charge of all the
cash in hand pays the men advances receives freight and passage
money and runs up bills in every port All this he does as the owners
confidential agent and his integrity is proved by his receipted bills
I tell you the captain of a ship is more likely to forget his pants
than these bills which guarantee his character Ive known men drown to
save them bad men too but this is the shipmasters honour And here
this Captain Trentnot hurried not threatened with anything but a free
passage in a British manofwarhas left them all behind I dont want
to express myself too strongly because the facts appear against me but
the thing is impossible

Dinner came to us not long after and we ate it on deck in a grim
silence each privately racking his brain for some solution of the
mysteries I was indeed so swallowed up in these considerations that
the wreck the lagoon the islets and the strident seafowl the strong
sun then beating on my head and even the gloomy countenance of the
captain at my elbow all vanished from the field of consciousness My
mind was a blackboard on which I scrawled and blotted out hypotheses
comparing each with the pictorial records in my memory cyphering with
pictures In the course of this tense mental exercise I recalled and
studied the faces of one memorial masterpiece the scene of the saloon
and here I found myself on a sudden looking in the eyes of the Kanaka

Theres one thing I can put beyond doubt at all events I cried
relinquishing my dinner and getting briskly afoot There was that
Kanaka I saw in the bar with Captain Trent the fellow the newspapers
and ships articles made out to be a Chinaman I mean to rout his
quarters out and settle that

All right said Nares Ill lazy off a bit longer Mr Dodd I feel
pretty rocky and mean

We had thoroughly cleared out the three aftercompartments of the ship
all the stuff from the main cabin and the mates and captains quarters
lay piled about the wheel but in the forward stateroom with the two
bunks where Nares had said the mate and cook most likely berthed
we had as yet done nothing Thither I went It was very bare a few
photographs were tacked on the bulkhead one of them indecent a single
chest stood open and like all we had yet found it had been partly
rifled An armful of twoshilling novels proved to me beyond a doubt
it was a Europeans no Chinaman would have possessed any and the most
literate Kanaka conceivable in a ships galley was not likely to have
gone beyond one It was plain then that the cook had not berthed aft
and I must look elsewhere

The men had stamped down the nests and driven the birds from the galley
so that I could now enter without contest One door had been already
blocked with rice the place was in part darkness full of a foul stale
smell and a cloud of nasty flies it had been left besides in some
disorder or else the birds during their time of tenancy had knocked
the things about and the floor like the deck before we washed it was
spread with pasty filth Against the wall in the far corner I found
a handsome chest of camphorwood bound with brass such as Chinamen and
sailors love and indeed all of mankind that plies in the Pacific From
its outside view I could thus make no deduction and strange to
say the interior was concealed All the other chests as I have said
already we had found gaping open and their contents scattered abroad
the same remark we found to apply afterwards in the quarters of the
seamen only this camphorwood chest a singular exception was both
closed and locked

I took an axe to it readily forced the paltry Chinese fastening and
like a CustomHouse officer plunged my hands among the contents For
some while I groped among linen and cotton Then my teeth were set
on edge with silk of which I drew forth several strips covered with
mysterious characters And these settled the business for I recognised
them as a kind of bedhanging popular with the commoner class of the
Chinese Nor were further evidences wanting such as nightclothes of
an extraordinary design a threestringed Chinese fiddle a silk
handkerchief full of roots and herbs and a neat apparatus for smoking
opium with a liberal provision of the drug Plainly then the cook had
been a Chinaman and if so who was Jos Amalu Or had Jos stolen the
chest before he proceeded to ship under a false name and domicile It
was possible as anything was possible in such a welter but regarded
as a solution it only led and left me deeper in the bog For why
should this chest have been deserted and neglected when the others were
rummaged or removed and where had Jos come by that second chest with
which according to the clerk at the What Cheer he had started for
Honolulu


And how have YOU fared inquired the captain whom I found luxuriously
reclining in our mound of litter And the accent on the pronoun the
heightened colour of the speakers face and the contained excitement
in his tones advertised me at once that I had not been alone to make
discoveries

I have found a Chinamans chest in the galley said I and John if
there was any John was not so much as at the pains to take his opium

Nares seemed to take it mighty quietly That so said he Now cast
your eyes on that and own youre beaten And with a formidable clap
of his open hand he flattened out before me on the deck a pair of
newspapers

I gazed upon them dully being in no mood for fresh discoveries

Look at them Mr Dodd cried the captain sharply Cant you look
at them And he ran a dirty thumb along the title _Sydney Morning
Herald_ November 26th cant you make that out he cried with rising
energy And dont you know sir that not thirteen days after this
paper appeared in New South Pole this ship were standing in heaved her
blessed anchors out of China How did the _Sydney Morning Herald_ get to
Hong Kong in thirteen days Trent made no land he spoke no ship till
he got here Then he either got it here or in Hong Kong I give you your
choice my son he cried and fell back among the clothes like a man
weary of life

Where did you find them I asked In that black bag

Guess so he said You neednt fool with it Theres nothing else but
a leadpencil and a kind of workedout knife

I looked in the bag however and was well rewarded

Every man to his trade captain said I Youre a sailor and youve
given me plenty of points but I am an artist and allow me to
inform you this is quite as strange as all the rest The knife is a
paletteknife the pencil a Winsor and Newton and a B B B at that
A paletteknife and a B B B on a tramp brig Its against the laws of
nature

It would sicken a dog wouldnt it said Nares

Yes I continued its been used by an artist too see how its
sharpenednot for writingno man could write with that An artist and
straight from Sydney How can he come in

O thats natural enough sneered Nares They cabled him to come up
and illustrate this dime novel

We fell a while silent

Captain I said at last there is something deuced underhand about
this brig You tell me youve been to sea a good part of your life You
must have seen shady things done on ships and heard of more Well what
is this is it insurance is it piracy what is it ABOUT what can it be
for

Mr Dodd returned Nares youre right about me having been to sea
the bigger part of my life And youre right again when you think I know
a good many ways in which a dishonest captain maynt be on the square
nor do exactly the right thing by his owners and altogether be just a
little too smart by ninetynine and threequarters Theres a good many
ways but not so many as youd think and not one that has any mortal
thing to do with Trent Trent and his whole racket has got to do with
nothingthats the bedrock fact theres no sense to it and no use
in it and no story to it its a beastly dream And dont you run away
with that notion that landsmen take about ships A society actress dont
go around more publicly than what a ship does nor is more interviewed
nor more humbugged nor more run after by all sorts of little
fussinesses in brass buttons And more than an actress a ship has a
deal to lose shes capital and the actress only characterif shes
that The ports of the world are thick with people ready to kick a
captain into the penitentiary if hes not as bright as a dollar and as
honest as the morning star and what with Lloyd keeping watch and watch
in every corner of the three oceans and the insurance leeches and the
consuls and the customs bugs and the medicos you can only get
the idea by thinking of a landsman watched by a hundred and fifty
detectives or a stranger in a village Down East

Well but at sea I said

You make me tired retorted the captain Whats the useat sea
Everythings got to come to bearings at some port hasnt it You cant
stop at sea for ever can youNo the Flying Scud is rubbish if it
meant anything it would have to mean something so almighty intricate
that James G Blaine hasnt got the brains to engineer it and I vote
for more axeing pioneering and opening up the resources of this
phenomenal brig and less general fuss he added arising The
dimemuseum symptoms will drop in of themselves I guess to keep us
cheery

But it appeared we were at the end of discoveries for the day and we
left the brig about sundown without being further puzzled or further
enlightened The best of the cabin spoilsbooks instruments papers
silks and curiositieswe carried along with us in a blanket however
to divert the evening hours and when supper was over and the table
cleared and Johnson set down to a dreary game of cribbage between his
right hand and his left the captain and I turned out our blanket on the
floor and sat side by side to examine and appraise the spoils

The books were the first to engage our notice These were rather
numerous as Nares contemptuously put it for a limejuicer Scorn
of the British mercantile marine glows in the breast of every Yankee
merchant captain as the scorn is not reciprocated I can only suppose
it justified in fact and certainly the old country mariner appears of a
less studious disposition The more credit to the officers of the Flying
Scud who had quite a library both literary and professional There
were Findlays five directories of the worldall brokenbacked as is
usual with Findlay and all marked and scribbled over with corrections
and additionsseveral books of navigation a signal code and an
Admiralty book of a sort of orange hue called _Islands of the Eastern
Pacific Ocean Vol III_ which appeared from its imprint to be the
latest authority and showed marks of frequent consultation in the
passages about the French Frigate Shoals the Harman Cure Pearl and
Hermes reefs Lisiansky Island Ocean Island and the place where
we then layBrooks or Midway A volume of Macaulays _Essays_ and a
shilling Shakespeare led the van of the belles lettres the rest were
novels several Miss Braddonsof course _Aurora Floyd_ which has
penetrated to every isle of the Pacific a good many cheap detective
books _Rob Roy_ Auerbachs _Auf der Hohe_ in the German and a prize
temperance story pillaged to judge by the stamp from an AngloIndian
circulating library

The Admiralty man gives a fine picture of our island remarked Nares
who had turned up Midway Island He draws the dreariness rather mild
but you can make out he knows the place

Captain I cried youve struck another point in this mad business
See here I went on eagerly drawing from my pocket a crumpled fragment
of the _Daily Occidental_ which I had inherited from Jim misled by
Hoyts Pacific Directory Wheres Hoyt

Lets look into that said Nares I got that book on purpose for this
cruise Therewith he fetched it from the shelf in his berth turned to
Midway Island and read the account aloud It stated with precision that
the Pacific Mail Company were about to form a depot there in preference
to Honolulu and that they had already a station on the island

I wonder who gives these Directory men their information Nares
reflected Nobody can blame Trent after that I never got in company
with squarer lying it reminds a man of a presidential campaign

All very well said I Thats your Hoyt and a fine tall copy But
what I want to know is where is Trents Hoyt

Took it with him chuckled Nares He had left everything else bills
and money and all the rest he was bound to take something or it would
have aroused attention on the Tempest Happy thought says he lets
take Hoyt

And has it not occurred to you I went on that all the Hoyts in
creation couldnt have misled Trent since he had in his hand that red
admiralty book an official publication later in date and particularly
full on Midway Island

Thats a fact cried Nares and I bet the first Hoyt he ever saw
was out of the mercantile library of San Francisco Looks as if he had
brought her here on purpose dont it But then thats inconsistent with
the steamcrusher of the sale Thats the trouble with this brig racket
any one can make half a dozen theories for sixty or seventy per cent
of it but when theyre made theres always a fathom or two of slack
hanging out of the other end

I believe our attention fell next on the papers of which we had
altogether a considerable bulk I had hoped to find among these matter
for a fulllength character of Captain Trent but here I was doomed on
the whole to disappointment We could make out he was an orderly man
for all his bills were docketed and preserved That he was convivial
and inclined to be frugal even in conviviality several documents
proclaimed Such letters as we found were with one exception arid
notes from tradesmen The exception signed Hannah Trent was a somewhat
fervid appeal for a loan You know what misfortunes I have had to
bear wrote Hannah and how much I am disappointed in George The
landlady appeared a true friend when I first came here and I thought
her a perfect lady But she has come out since then in her true colours
and if you will not be softened by this last appeal I cant think what
is to become of your affectionate and then the signature This
document was without place or date and a voice told me that it had gone
likewise without answer On the whole there were few letters anywhere
in the ship but we found one before we were finished in a seamans
chest of which I must transcribe some sentences It was dated from some
place on the Clyde My dearist son it ran this is to tell you your
dearist father passed away Jan twelft in the peace of the Lord He had
your photo and dear Davids lade upon his bed made me sit by him
Lets be a thegither he said and gave you all his blessing O my dear
laddie why were nae you and Davie here He would have had a happier
passage He spok of both of ye all night most beautiful and how ye used
to stravaig on the Saturday afternoons and of auld Kelvinside Sooth
the tune to me he said though it was the Sabbath and I had to sooth
him Kelvin Grove and he looked at his fiddle the dear man I cannae
bear the sight of it hell never play it mair O my lamb come home to
me Im all by my lane now The rest was in a religious vein and quite
conventional I have never seen any one more put out than Nares when I
handed him this letter he had read but a few words before he cast
it down it was perhaps a minute ere he picked it up again and the
performance was repeated the third time before he reached the end

Its touching isnt it said I

For all answer Nares exploded in a brutal oath and it was some half an
hour later that he vouchsafed an explanation Ill tell you what broke
me up about that letter said he My old man played the fiddle played
it all out of tune one of the things he played was _Martyrdom_ I
rememberit was all martyrdom to me He was a pig of a father and I
was a pig of a son but it sort of came over me I would like to hear
that fiddle squeak again Natural he added I guess were all
beasts

All sons are I guess said I I have the same trouble on my
conscience we can shake hands on that Which oddly enough perhaps
we did

Amongst the papers we found a considerable sprinkling of photographs
for the most part either of very debonairlooking young ladies or old
women of the lodginghouse persuasion But one among them was the means
of our crowning discovery

Theyre not pretty are they Mr Dodd said Nares as he passed it
over

Who I asked mechanically taking the card it was a quarterplate
in hand and smothering a yawn for the hour was late the day had been
laborious and I was wearying for bed

Trent and Company said he Thats a historic picture of the gang

I held it to the light my curiosity at a low ebb I had seen Captain
Trent once and had no delight in viewing him again It was a photograph
of the deck of the brig taken from forward all in applepie order the
hands gathered in the waist the officers on the poop At the foot of
the card was written Brig Flying Scud Rangoon and a date and above
or below each individual figure the name had been carefully noted

As I continued to gaze a shock went through me the dimness of sleep
and fatigue lifted from my eyes as fog lifts in the channel and I
beheld with startled clearness the photographic presentment of a crowd
of strangers J Trent Master at the top of the card directed me to
a smallish weazened man with bushy eyebrows and full white beard
dressed in a frock coat and white trousers a flower stuck in his
buttonhole his bearded chin set forward his mouth clenched with
habitual determination There was not much of the sailor in his looks
but plenty of the martinet a dry precise man who might pass for a
preacher in some rigid sect and whatever he was not the Captain
Trent of San Francisco The men too were all new to me the cook an
unmistakable Chinaman in his characteristic dress standing apart on
the poop steps But perhaps I turned on the whole with the greatest
curiosity to the figure labelled E Goddedaal 1st off He whom I had
never seen he might be the identical he might be the clue and spring
of all this mystery and I scanned his features with the eye of a
detective He was of great stature seemingly blonde as a viking
his hair clustering round his head in frowsy curls and two enormous
whiskers like the tusks of some strange animal jutting from his
cheeks With these virile appendages and the defiant attitude in which
he stood the expression of his face only imperfectly harmonised It was
wild heroic and womanish looking and I felt I was prepared to hear he
was a sentimentalist and to see him weep

For some while I digested my discovery in private reflecting how best
and how with most of drama I might share it with the captain Then my
sketchbook came in my head and I fished it out from where it lay with
other miscellaneous possessions at the foot of my bunk and turned to
my sketch of Captain Trent and the survivors of the British brig Flying
Scud in the San Francisco barroom

Nares said I Ive told you how I first saw Captain Trent in that
saloon in Frisco how he came with his men one of them a Kanaka with
a canarybird in a cage and how I saw him afterwards at the auction
frightened to death and as much surprised at how the figures skipped up
as anybody there Well said I theres the man I sawand I laid
the sketch before himtheres Trent of Frisco and there are his three
hands Find one of them in the photograph and Ill be obliged

Nares compared the two in silence Well he said at last I call this
rather a relief seems to clear the horizon We might have guessed at
something of the kind from the double ration of chests that figured

Does it explain anything I asked

It would explain everything Nares replied but for the
steamcrusher Itll all tally as neat as a patent puzzle if you leave
out the way these people bid the wreck up And there we come to a stone
wall But whatever it is Mr Dodd its on the crook

And looks like piracy I added

Looks like blind hookey cried the captain No dont you deceive
yourself neither your head nor mine is big enough to put a name on this
business




CHAPTER XV THE CARGO OF THE FLYING SCUD


In my early days I was a man the most wedded to his idols of my
generation I was a dweller under roofs the gull of that which we call
civilisation a superstitious votary of the plastic arts a cit and
a prop of restaurants I had a comrade in those days somewhat of an
outsider though he moved in the company of artists and a man famous
in our small world for gallantry knee breeches and dry and pregnant
sayings He looking on the long meals and waxing bellies of the French
whom I confess I somewhat imitated branded me as a cultivator of
restaurant fat And I believe he had his finger on the dangerous spot
I believe if things had gone smooth with me I should be now swollen
like a prizeox in body and fallen in mind to a thing perhaps as low
as many types of bourgeoisthe implicit or exclusive artist That was a
home word of Pinkertons deserving to be writ in letters of gold on the
portico of every school of art What I cant see is why you should want
to do nothing else The dull man is made not by the nature but by the
degree of his immersion in a single business And all the more if that
be sedentary uneventful and ingloriously safe More than one half
of him will then remain unexercised and undeveloped the rest will be
distended and deformed by overnutrition overcerebration and the heat
of rooms And I have often marvelled at the impudence of gentlemen
who describe and pass judgment on the life of man in almost perfect
ignorance of all its necessary elements and natural careers Those
who dwell in clubs and studios may paint excellent pictures or write
enchanting novels There is one thing that they should not do they
should pass no judgment on mans destiny for it is a thing with which
they are unacquainted Their own life is an excrescence of the moment
doomed in the vicissitude of history to pass and disappear the
eternal life of man spent under sun and rain and in rude physical
effort lies upon one side scarce changed since the beginning

I would I could have carried along with me to Midway Island all the
writers and the prating artists of my time Day after day of hope
deferred of heat of unremitting toil night after night of aching
limbs bruised hands and a mind obscured with the grateful vacancy of
physical fatigue the scene the nature of my employment the rugged
speech and faces of my fellowtoilers the glare of the day on deck the
stinking twilight in the bilge the shrill myriads of the oceanfowl
above all the sense of our immitigable isolation from the world and
from the current epochkeeping another time some eras old the new
day heralded by no daily paper only by the rising sun and the State
the churches the peopled empires war and the rumours of war and the
voices of the arts all gone silent as in the days ere they were yet
invented Such were the conditions of my new experience in life
of which if I had been able I would have had all my confreres and
contemporaries to partake forgetting for that while the orthodoxies
of the moment and devoted to a single and material purpose under the
eye of heaven

Of the nature of our task I must continue to give some summary idea
The forecastle was lumbered with ships chandlery the hold nigh full of
rice the lazarette crowded with the teas and silks These must all be
dug out and that made but a fraction of our task The hold was ceiled
throughout a part where perhaps some delicate cargo was once stored
had been lined in addition with inch boards and between every beam
there was a movable panel into the bilge Any of these the bulkheads of
the cabins the very timbers of the hull itself might be the place of
hiding It was therefore necessary to demolish as we proceeded a
great part of the ships inner skin and fittings and to auscultate what
remained like a doctor sounding for a lung disease Upon the return
from any beam or bulkhead of a flat or doubtful sound we must up axe
and hew into the timber a violent andfrom the amount of dry rot in
the wrecka mortifying exercise Every night saw a deeper inroad into
the bones of the Flying Scudmore beams tapped and hewn in splinters
more planking peeled away and tossed asideand every night saw us as
far as ever from the end and object of our arduous devastation In this
perpetual disappointment my courage did not fail me but my spirits
dwindled and Nares himself grew silent and morose At night when
supper was done we passed an hour in the cabin mostly without speech
I sometimes dozing over a book Nares sullenly but busily drilling
seashells with the instrument called a Yankee Fiddle A stranger might
have supposed we were estranged as a matter of fact in this silent
comradeship of labour our intimacy grew

I had been struck at the first beginning of our enterprise upon the
wreck to find the men so ready at the captains lightest word I
dare not say they liked but I can never deny that they admired him
thoroughly A mild word from his mouth was more valued than flattery
and half a dollar from myself if he relaxed at all from his habitual
attitude of censure smiling alacrity surrounded him and I was led to
think his theory of captainship even if pushed to excess reposed upon
some ground of reason But even terror and admiration of the
captain failed us before the end The men wearied of the hopeless
unremunerative quest and the long strain of labour They began to
shirk and grumble Retribution fell on them at once and retribution
multiplied the grumblings With every day it took harder driving to keep
them to the daily drudge and we in our narrow boundaries were kept
conscious every moment of the illwill of our assistants

In spite of the best care the object of our search was perfectly well
known to all on board and there had leaked out besides some knowledge
of those inconsistencies that had so greatly amazed the captain and
myself I could overhear the men debate the character of Captain Trent
and set forth competing theories of where the opium was stowed and as
they seemed to have been eavesdropping on ourselves I thought little
shame to prick up my ears when I had the return chance of spying upon
them in this way I could diagnose their temper and judge how far they
were informed upon the mystery of the Flying Scud It was after having
thus overheard some almost mutinous speeches that a fortunate idea
crossed my mind At night I matured it in my bed and the first thing
the next morning broached it to the captain

Suppose I spirit up the hands a bit I asked by the offer of a
reward

If you think youre getting your months wages out of them the way it
is I dont was his reply However they are all the men youve got
and youre the supercargo

This from a person of the captains character might be regarded as
complete adhesion and the crew were accordingly called aft Never had
the captain worn a front more menacing It was supposed by all that some
misdeed had been discovered and some surprising punishment was to be
announced

See here you he threw at them over his shoulder as he walked the
deck Mr Dodd here is going to offer a reward to the first man who
strikes the opium in that wreck Theres two ways of making a donkey go
both good I guess the ones kicks and the others carrots Mr Dodds
going to try the carrots Well my sonsand here he faced the men for
the first time with his hands behind himif that opiums not found in
five days you can come to me for the kicks

He nodded to the present narrator who took up the tale Here is what
I propose men said I I put up one hundred and fifty dollars If
any man can lay hands on the stuff right away and off his own club
he shall have the hundred and fifty down If any one can put us on the
scent of where to look he shall have a hundred and twentyfive and the
balance shall be for the lucky one who actually picks it up Well call
it the Pinkerton Stakes captain I added with a smile

Call it the Grand Combination Sweep then cries he For I go you
betterLook here men I make up this jackpot to two hundred and
fifty dollars American gold coin

Thank you Captain Nares said I that was handsomely done

It was kindly meant he returned

The offer was not made in vain the hands had scarce yet realised the
magnitude of the reward they had scarce begun to buzz aloud in the
extremity of hope and wonder ere the Chinese cook stepped forward with
gracious gestures and explanatory smiles

Captain he began I servum two year Melican navy servum six year
mailboat steward Savvy plenty

Oho cried Nares you savvy plenty do you Beggars seen this trick
in the mailboats I guess Well why you no savvy a little sooner
sonny

I think bimeby makeum reward replied the cook with smiling dignity

Well you cant say fairer than that the captain admitted and now
the rewards offered youll talk Speak up then Suppose you speak
true you get reward See

I think long time replied the Chinaman See plenty litty mat lice
toomuchy plenty litty mat lice sixty ton litty mat lice I think
alletime perhaps plenty opium plenty litty mat lice

Well Mr Dodd how does that strike you asked the captain He may
be right he may be wrong Hes likely to be right for if he isnt
where can the stuff be On the other hand if hes wrong we destroy
a hundred and fifty tons of good rice for nothing Its a point to be
considered

I dont hesitate said I Lets get to the bottom of the thing The
rice is nothing the rice will neither make nor break us

Thats how I expected you to see it returned Nares

And we called the boat away and set forth on our new quest

The hold was now almost entirely emptied the mats of which there went
forty to the short ton had been stacked on deck and now crowded the
ships waist and forecastle It was our task to disembowel and explore
six thousand individual mats and incidentally to destroy a hundred and
fifty tons of valuable food Nor were the circumstances of the days
business less strange than its essential nature Each man of us armed
with a great knife attacked the pile from his own quarter slashed into
the nearest mat burrowed in it with his hands and shed forth the rice
upon the deck where it heaped up overflowed and was trodden down
poured at last into the scuppers and occasionally spouted from the
vents About the wreck thus transformed into an overflowing granary
the seafowl swarmed in myriads and with surprising insolence The sight
of so much food confounded them they deafened us with their shrill
tongues swooped in our midst dashed in our faces and snatched the
grain from between our fingers The mentheir hands bleeding from these
assaultsturned savagely on the offensive drove their knives into the
birds drew them out crimsoned and turned again to dig among the rice
unmindful of the gawking creatures that struggled and died among their
feet We made a singular picture the hovering and diving birds the
bodies of the dead discolouring the rice with blood the scuppers
vomiting breadstuff the men frenzied by the gold hunt toiling
slaying and shouting aloud over all the lofty intricacy of rigging
and the radiant heaven of the Pacific Every man there toiled in the
immediate hope of fifty dollars and I of fifty thousand Small wonder
if we waded callously in blood and food

It was perhaps about ten in the forenoon when the scene was interrupted
Nares who had just ripped open a fresh mat drew forth and slung at
his feet among the rice a papered tin box

Hows that he shouted

A cry broke from all hands the next moment forgetting their own
disappointment in that contagious sentiment of success they gave three
cheers that scared the seabirds and the next they had crowded round
the captain and were jostling together and groping with emulous hands
in the newopened mat Box after box rewarded them six in all wrapped
as I have said in a paper envelope and the paper printed on in
Chinese characters

Nares turned to me and shook my hand I began to think we should never
see this day said he I congratulate you Mr Dodd on having pulled
it through

The captains tones affected me profoundly and when Johnson and the
men pressed round me in turn with congratulations the tears came in my
eyes

These are fivetael boxes more than two pounds said Nares weighing
one in his hand Say two hundred and fifty dollars to the mat Lay into
it boys Well make Mr Dodd a millionnaire before dark

It was strange to see with what a fury we fell to The men had now
nothing to expect the mere idea of great sums inspired them with
disinterested ardour Mats were slashed and disembowelled the rice
flowed to our knees in the ships waist the sweat ran in our eyes and
blinded us our arms ached to agony and yet our fire abated not Dinner
came we were too weary to eat too hoarse for conversation and yet
dinner was scarce done before we were afoot again and delving in the
rice Before nightfall not a mat was unexplored and we were face to
face with the astonishing result

For of all the inexplicable things in the story of the Flying Scud here
was the most inexplicable Out of the six thousand mats only twenty
were found to have been sugared in each we found the same amount about
twelve pounds of drug making a grand total of two hundred and forty
pounds By the last San Francisco quotation opium was selling for a
fraction over twenty dollars a pound but it had been known not long
before to bring as much as forty in Honolulu where it was contraband

Taking then this high Honolulu figure the value of the opium on board
the Flying Scud fell considerably short of ten thousand dollars while
at the San Francisco rate it lacked a trifle of five thousand And fifty
thousand was the price that Jim and I had paid for it And Bellairs had
been eager to go higher There is no language to express the stupor with
which I contemplated this result

It may be argued we were not yet sure there might be yet another cache
and you may be certain in that hour of my distress the argument was not
forgotten There was never a ship more ardently perquested no stone
was left unturned and no expedient untried day after day of growing
despair we punched and dug in the brigs vitals exciting the men with
promises and presents evening after evening Nares and I sat face
to face in the narrow cabin racking our minds for some neglected
possibility of search I could stake my salvation on the certainty of
the result in all that ship there was nothing left of value but the
timber and the copper nails So that our case was lamentably plain we
had paid fifty thousand dollars borne the charges of the schooner and
paid fancy interest on money and if things went well with us we
might realise fifteen per cent of the first outlay We were not merely
bankrupt we were comic bankrupts a fair butt for jeering in the
streets I hope I bore the blow with a good countenance indeed my mind
had long been quite made up and since the day we found the opium I had
known the result But the thought of Jim and Mamie ached in me like a
physical pain and I shrank from speech and companionship

I was in this frame of mind when the captain proposed that we should
land upon the island I saw he had something to say and only feared
it might be consolation for I could just bear my grief not bungling
sympathy and yet I had no choice but to accede to his proposal

We walked awhile along the beach in silence The sun overhead
reverberated rays of heat the staring sand the glaring lagoon
tortured our eyes and the birds and the boom of the faraway breakers
made a savage symphony

I dont require to tell you the games up Nares asked

No said I

I was thinking of getting to sea tomorrow he pursued

The best thing you can do said I

Shall we say Honolulu he inquired


O yes lets stick to the programme I cried Honolulu be it

There was another silence and then Nares cleared his throat

Weve been pretty good friends you and me Mr Dodd he resumed
Weve been going through the kind of thing that tries a man Weve had
the hardest kind of work weve been badly backed and now were badly
beaten And weve fetched through without a word of disagreement I
dont say this to praise myself its my trade its what Im paid for
and trained for and brought up to But it was another thing for you it
was all new to you and it did me good to see you stand right up to it
and swing right into it day in day out And then see how youve taken
this disappointment when everybody knows you must have been tautened
up to shyingpoint I wish youd let me tell you Mr Dodd that youve
stood out mighty manly and handsomely in all this business and made
every one like you and admire you And I wish youd let me tell you
besides that Ive taken this wreck business as much to heart as you
have something kind of rises in my throat when I think were beaten
and if I thought waiting would do it I would stick on this reef until
we starved

I tried in vain to thank him for these generous words but he was
beforehand with me in a moment

I didnt bring you ashore to sound my praises he interrupted We
understand one another now thats all and I guess you can trust me
What I wished to speak about is more important and its got to be
faced What are we to do about the Flying Scud and the dime novel

I really have thought nothing about that I replied But I expect I
mean to get at the bottom of it and if the bogus Captain Trent is to be
found on the earths surface I guess I mean to find him

All youve got to do is talk said Nares you can make the biggest
kind of boom it isnt often the reporters have a chance at such a yarn
as this and I can tell you how it will go It will go by telegraph Mr
Dodd itll be telegraphed by the column and headlined and frothed
up and denied by authority and itll hit bogus Captain Trent in a
Mexican barroom and knock over bogus Goddedaal in a slum somewhere up
the Baltic and bowl down Hardy and Brown in sailors music halls round
Greenock O theres no doubt you can have a regular domestic Judgment
Day The only point is whether you deliberately want to

Well said I I deliberately dont want one thing I deliberately
dont want to make a public exhibition of myself and Pinkerton so
moralsmuggling opium such damned foolspaying fifty thousand for a
dead horse

No doubt it might damage you in a business sense the captain agreed
And Im pleased you take that view for Ive turned kind of soft upon
the job Theres been some crookedness about no doubt of it but Law
bless you if we dropped upon the troupe all the premier artists would
slip right out with the boodle in their gripsacks and youd only
collar a lot of old muttonheaded shellbacks that didnt know the back
of the business from the front I dont take much stock in Mercantile
Jack you know that but poor devil hes got to go where hes told
and if you make trouble ten to one itll make you sick to see the
innocents who have to stand the racket It would be different if we
understood the operation but we dont you see theres a lot of queer
corners in life and my vote is to let the blame thing lie

You speak as if we had that in our power I objected

And so we have said he

What about the men I asked They know too much by half and you
cant keep them from talking

Cant I returned Nares I bet a boardingmaster can They can be all
halfseasover when they get ashore blind drunk by dark and cruising
out of the Golden Gate in different deepsea ships by the next morning
Cant keep them from talking cant I Well I can make em talk
separate leastways If a whole crew came talking parties would listen
but if its only one lone old shellback its the usual yarn And at
least they neednt talk before six months orif we have luck and
theres a whaler handythree years And by that time Mr Dodd its
ancient history

Thats what they call Shanghaiing isnt it I asked I thought it
belonged to the dime novel

O dime novels are right enough returned the captain Nothing wrong
with the dime novel only that things happen thicker than they do in
life and the practical seamanship is offcolour

So we can keep the business to ourselves I mused

Theres one other person that might blab said the captain Though I
dont believe she has anything left to tell

And who is SHE I asked

The old girl there he answered pointing to the wreck I know
theres nothing in her but somehow Im afraid of some one elseits
the last thing youd expect so its just the first thatll happensome
one dropping into this Godforgotten island where nobody drops in
waltzing into that wreck that weve grown old with searching stooping
straight down and picking right up the very thing that tells the story
Whats that to me you may ask and why am I gone Soft Tommy on this
Museum of Crooks Theyve smashed up you and Mr Pinkerton theyve
turned my hair grey with conundrums theyve been up to larks no doubt
and thats all I know of themyou say Well and thats just where it
is I dont know enough I dont know whats uppermost its just such
a lot of miscellaneous eventualities as I dont care to go stirring
up and I ask you to let me deal with the old girl after a patent of my
own

Certainlywhat you please said I scarce with attention for a new
thought now occupied my brain Captain I broke out you are wrong
we cannot hush this up There is one thing you have forgotten

What is that he asked

A bogus Captain Trent a bogus Goddedaal a whole bogus crew have all
started home said I If we are right not one of them will reach his
journeys end And do you mean to say that such a circumstance as that
can pass without remark

Sailors said the captain only sailors If they were all bound for
one place in a body I dont say so but theyre all going separateto
Hull to Sweden to the Clyde to the Thames Well at each place
what is it Nothing new Only one sailor man missing got drunk or got
drowned or got left the proper sailors end


Something bitter in the thought and in the speakers tones struck me
hard Here is one that has got left I cried getting sharply to my
feet for we had been some time seated I wish it were the other I
dontdont relish going home to Jim with this

See here said Nares with ready tact I must be getting aboard
Johnsons in the brig annexing chandlery and canvas and theres some
things in the Norah that want fixing against we go to sea Would you
like to be left here in the chickenranch Ill send for you to supper

I embraced the proposal with delight Solitude in my frame of mind was
not too dearly purchased at the risk of sunstroke or sandblindness and
soon I was alone on the illomened islet I should find it hard to tell
of what I thoughtof Jim of Mamie of our lost fortune of my lost
hopes of the doom before me to turn to at some mechanical occupation
in some subaltern rank and to toil there unremarked and unamused
until the hour of the last deliverance I was at least so sunk in
sadness that I scarce remarked where I was going and chance or some
finer sense that lives in us and only guides us when the mind is in
abeyance conducted my steps into a quarter of the island where the
birds were few By some devious route which I was unable to retrace
for my return I was thus able to mount without interruption to the
highest point of land And here I was recalled to consciousness by a
last discovery

The spot on which I stood was level and commanded a wide view of the
lagoon the bounding reef the round horizon Nearer hand I saw the
sister islet the wreck the Norah Creina and the Norahs boat already
moving shoreward For the sun was now low flaming on the seas verge
and the galley chimney smoked on board the schooner

It thus befell that though my discovery was both affecting and
suggestive I had no leisure to examine further What I saw was the
blackened embers of fire of wreck By all the signs it must have blazed
to a good height and burned for days from the scantling of a spar that
lay upon the margin only half consumed it must have been the work of
more than one and I received at once the image of a forlorn troop of
castaways houseless in that lost corner of the earth and feeding there
their fire of signal The next moment a hail reached me from the boat
and bursting through the bushes and the rising seafowl I said farewell
I trust for ever to that desert isle




CHAPTER XVI IN WHICH I TURN SMUGGLER AND THE CAPTAIN CASUIST


The last night at Midway I had little sleep the next morning after
the sun was risen and the clatter of departure had begun to reign on
deck I lay a long while dozing and when at last I stepped from the
companion the schooner was already leaping through the pass into the
open sea Close on her board the huge scroll of a breaker unfurled
itself along the reef with a prodigious clamour and behind I saw the
wreck vomiting into the morning air a coil of smoke The wreaths already
blew out far to leeward flames already glittered in the cabin skylight
and the seafowl were scattered in surprise as wide as the lagoon As
we drew farther off the conflagration of the Flying Scud flamed higher
and long after we had dropped all signs of Midway Island the smoke
still hung in the horizon like that of a distant steamer With the
fading out of that last vestige the Norah Creina passed again into the
empty world of cloud and water by which she had approached and the next
features that appeared eleven days later to break the line of sky
were the arid mountains of Oahu

It has often since been a comfortable thought to me that we had thus
destroyed the telltale remnants of the Flying Scud and often a strange
one that my last sight and reminiscence of that fatal ship should be
a pillar of smoke on the horizon To so many others besides myself
the same appearance had played a part in the various stages of that
business luring some to what they little imagined filling some with
unimaginable terrors But ours was the last smoke raised in the story
and with its dying away the secret of the Flying Scud became a private
property

It was by the first light of dawn that we saw close on board the
metropolitan island of Hawaii We held along the coast as near as
we could venture with a fresh breeze and under an unclouded heaven
beholding as we went the arid mountain sides and scrubby cocoapalms
of that somewhat melancholy archipelago About four of the afternoon
we turned Waimanolo Point the westerly headland of the great bight of
Honolulu showed ourselves for twenty minutes in full view and then
fell again to leeward and put in the rest of daylight plying under
shortened sail under the lee of Waimanolo

A little after dark we beat once more about the point and crept
cautiously toward the mouth of the Pearl Lochs where Jim and I had
arranged I was to meet the smugglers The night was happily obscure the
water smooth We showed according to instructions no light on deck
only a red lantern dropped from either cathead to within a couple of
feet of the water A lookout was stationed on the bowsprit end another
in the crosstrees and the whole ships company crowded forward
scouting for enemies or friends It was now the crucial moment of our
enterprise we were now risking liberty and credit and that for a sum
so small to a man in my bankrupt situation that I could have laughed
aloud in bitterness But the piece had been arranged and we must play
it to the finish

For some while we saw nothing but the dark mountain outline of the
island the torches of native fishermen glittering here and there along
the foreshore and right in the midst that cluster of brave lights with
which the town of Honolulu advertises itself to the seaward Presently
a ruddy star appeared inshore of us and seemed to draw near unsteadily
This was the anticipated signal and we made haste to show the
countersign lowering a white light from the quarter extinguishing
the two others and laying the schooner incontinently to The star
approached slowly the sounds of oars and of mens speech came to us
across the water and then a voice hailed us

Is that Mr Dodd

Yes I returned Is Jim Pinkerton there

No sir replied the voice But theres one of his crowd here name
of Speedy

Im here Mr Dodd added Speedy himself I have letters for you

All right I replied Come aboard gentlemen and let me see my
mail

A whaleboat accordingly ranged alongside and three men boarded us my
old San Francisco friend the stockgambler Speedy a little wizened
person of the name of Sharpe and a big flourishing dissipatedlooking
man called Fowler The two last I learned afterward were frequent
partners Sharpe supplied the capital and Fowler who was quite a
character in the islands and occupied a considerable station brought
activity daring and a private influence highly necessary in the case
Both seemed to approach the business with a keen sense of romance and I
believe this was the chief attraction at least with Fowlerfor whom
I early conceived a sentiment of liking But in that first moment I
had something else to think of than to judge my new acquaintances
and before Speedy had fished out the letters the full extent of our
misfortune was revealed

Weve rather bad news for you Mr Dodd said Fowler Your firms
gone up

Already I exclaimed

Well it was thought rather a wonder Pinkerton held on as long as he
did was the reply The wreck deal was too big for your credit you
were doing a big business no doubt but you were doing it on precious
little capital and when the strain came you were bound to go
Pinkertons through all right seven cents dividend some remarks
made but nothing to hurt the press let you down easyI guess Jim had
relations there The only trouble is that all this Flying Scud affair
got in the papers with the rest everybodys wide awake in Honolulu and
the sooner we get the stuff in and the dollars out the better for all
concerned

Gentlemen said I you must excuse me My friend the captain here
will drink a glass of champagne with you to give you patience but as
for myself I am unfit even for ordinary conversation till I have read
these letters

They demurred a little and indeed the danger of delay seemed obvious
but the sight of my distress which I was unable entirely to control
appealed strongly to their goodnature and I was suffered at last to
get by myself on deck where by the light of a lantern smuggled under
shelter of the low rail I read the following wretched correspondence

My dear Loudon ran the first this will be handed you by your friend
Speedy of the Catamount His sterling character and loyal devotion
to yourself pointed him out as the best man for our purposes in
Honoluluthe parties on the spot being difficult to manipulate A man
called Billy Fowler you must have heard of Billy is the boss he is in
politics some and squares the officers I have hard times before me
in the city but I feel as bright as a dollar and as strong as John L
Sullivan What with Mamie here and my partner speeding over the seas
and the bonanza in the wreck I feel like I could juggle with the
Pyramids of Egypt same as conjurers do with aluminium balls My
earnest prayers follow you Loudon that you may feel the way I dojust
inspired My feet dont touch the ground I kind of swim Mamie is like
Moses and Aaron that held up the other individuals arms She carries me
along like a horse and buggy I am beating the record

Your true partner

J PINKERTON

Number two was in a different style

My dearest Loudon how am I to prepare you for this dire intelligence
O dear me it will strike you to the earth The Fiat has gone forth our
firm went bust at a quarter before twelve It was a bill of Bradleys
for 200 that brought these vast operations to a close and evolved
liabilities of upwards of two hundred and fifty thousand O the shame
and pity of it and you but three weeks gone Loudon dont blame your
partner if human hands and brains could have sufficed I would have
held the thing together But it just slowly crumbled Bradley was the
last kick but the blamed business just MELTED I give the liabilities
its supposed theyre all in for the cowards were waiting and the
claims were filed like taking tickets to hear Patti I dont quite have
the hang of the assets yet our interests were so extended but I am at
it day and night and I guess will make a creditable dividend If the
wreck pans out only half the way it ought well turn the laugh still I
am as full of grit and work as ever and just tower above our troubles
Mamie is a host in herself Somehow I feel like it was only me that had
gone bust and you and she soared clear of it Hurry up Thats all you
have to do

Yours ever

J PINKERTON

The third was yet more altered

My poor Loudon it began I labour far into the night getting our
affairs in order you could not believe their vastness and complexity
Douglas B Longhurst said humorously that the receivers work would
be cut out for him I cannot deny that some of them have a speculative
look God forbid a sensitive refined spirit like yours should ever come
face to face with a Commissioner in Bankruptcy these men get all the
sweetness knocked right out of them But I could bear up better if it
werent for press comments Often and often Loudon I recall to mind
your most legitimate critiques of the press system They published an
interview with me not the least like what I said and with JEERING
comments it would make your blood boil it was literally INHUMANE I
wouldnt have written it about a yellow dog that was in trouble like
what I am Mamie just winced the first time she has turned a hair right
through the whole catastrophe How wonderfully true was what you said
long ago in Paris about touching on peoples personal appearance The
fellow said And then these words had been scored through and my
distressed friend turned to another subject I cannot bear to dwell
upon our assets They simply dont show up Even Thirteen Star as sound
a line as can be produced upon this coast goes begging The wreck has
thrown a blight on all we ever touched And wheres the use God never
made a wreck big enough to fill our deficit I am haunted by the thought
that you may blame me I know how I despised your remonstrances O
Loudon dont be hard on your miserable partner The funnydog business
is what kills I fear your stern rectitude of mind like the eye of God
I cannot think but what some of my books seem mixed up otherwise I
dont seem to see my way as plain as I could wish to Or else my brain
is gone soft Loudon if there should be any unpleasantness you can
trust me to do the right thing and keep you clear Ive been telling
them already how you had no business grip and never saw the books O I
trust I have done right in this I knew it was a liberty I know you may
justly complain but it was some things that were said And mind you
all legitimate business Not even your shrinking sensitiveness could
find fault with the first look of one of them if they had panned out
right And you know the Flying Scud was the biggest gamble of the
crowd and that was your own idea Mamie says she never could bear
to look you in the face if that idea had been mine she is SO
conscientious

Your brokenhearted

JIM

The last began without formality

This is the end of me commercially I give up my nerve is gone I
suppose I ought to be glad for were through the court I dont know
as ever I knew how and Im sure I dont remember If it pans outthe
wreck I meanwell go to Europe and live on the interest of our
money No more work for me I shake when people speak to me I have gone
on hoping and hoping and working and working and the lead has pinched
right out I want to lie on my back in a garden and read Shakespeare and
E P Roe Dont suppose its cowardice Loudon Im a sick man Rest is
what I must have Ive worked hard all my life I never spared myself
every dollar I ever made Ive coined my brains for it Ive never done
a mean thing Ive lived respectable and given to the poor Who has a
better right to a holiday than I have And I mean to have a year of it
straight out and if I dont I shall lie right down here in my tracks
and die of worry and brain trouble Dont mistake Thats so If there
are any pickings at all TRUST SPEEDY dont let the creditors get wind
of what there is I helped you when you were down help me now Dont
deceive yourself youve got to help me right now or never I am
clerking and NOT FIT TO CYPHER Mamies typewriting at the Phoenix
Guano Exchange down town The light is right out of my life I know
youll not like to do what I propose Think only of this that its life
or death for

JIM PINKERTON

PS Our figure was seven per cent O what a fall was there Well
well its past mending I dont want to whine But Loudon I do want
to live No more ambition all I ask is life I have so much to make
it sweet to me I am clerking and USELESS AT THAT I know I would have
fired such a clerk inside of forty minutes in MY time But my times
over I can only cling on to you Dont fail

JIM PINKERTON

There was yet one more postscript yet one more outburst of selfpity
and pathetic adjuration and a doctors opinion unpromising enough
was besides enclosed I pass them both in silence I think shame to
have shown at so great length the halfbaked virtues of my friend
dissolving in the crucible of sickness and distress and the effect upon
my spirits can be judged already I got to my feet when I had done drew
a deep breath and stared hard at Honolulu One moment the world seemed
at an end the next I was conscious of a rush of independent energy On
Jim I could rely no longer I must now take hold myself I must decide
and act on my own better thoughts

The word was easy to say the thing at the first blush was
undiscoverable I was overwhelmed with miserable womanish pity for
my broken friend his outcries grieved my spirit I saw him then and
nowthen so invincible now brought so lowand knew neither how
to refuse nor how to consent to his proposal The remembrance of my
father who had fallen in the same field unstained the image of his
monument incongruously rising a fear of the law a chill air that
seemed to blow upon my fancy from the doors of prisons and the
imaginary clank of fetters recalled me to a different resolve And then
again the wails of my sick partner intervened So I stood hesitating
and yet with a strong sense of capacity behind sure if I could but
choose my path that I should walk in it with resolution

Then I remembered that I had a friend on board and stepped to the
companion

Gentlemen said I only a few moments more but these I regret to
say I must make more tedious still by removing your companion It is
indispensable that I should have a word or two with Captain Nares

Both the smugglers were afoot at once protesting The business they
declared must be despatched at once they had run risk enough with a
conscience and they must either finish now or go

The choice is yours gentlemen said I and I believe the
eagerness I am not yet sure that I have anything in your way even if
I have there are a hundred things to be considered and I assure you it
is not at all my habit to do business with a pistol to my head

That is all very proper Mr Dodd there is no wish to coerce you
believe me said Fowler only please consider our position It is
really dangerous we were not the only people to see your schooner off
Waimanolo

Mr Fowler I replied I was not born yesterday Will you allow me
to express an opinion in which I may be quite wrong but to which I
am entirely wedded If the customhouse officers had been coming
they would have been here now In other words somebody is working the
oracle and for a good guess his name is Fowler

Both men laughed loud and long and being supplied with another bottle
of Longhursts champagne suffered the captain and myself to leave them
without further word

I gave Nares the correspondence and he skimmed it through

Now captain said I I want a fresh mind on this What does it
mean

Its large enough text replied the captain It means youre to stake
your pile on Speedy hand him over all you can and hold your tongue
I almost wish you hadnt shown it me he added wearily What with the
specie from the wreck and the opium money it comes to a biggish deal

Thats supposing that I do it said I

Exactly said he supposing you do it

And there are pros and cons to that I observed

Theres San Quentin to start in with said the captain and suppose
you clear the penitentiary theres the nasty taste in the mouth The
figures big enough to make bad trouble but its not big enough to be
picturesque and I should guess a man always feels kind of small who has
sold himself under six cyphers That would be my way at least theres
an excitement about a million that might carry me on but the other way
I should feel kind of lonely when I woke in bed Then theres Speedy Do
you know him well

No I do not said I

Well of course he can vamoose with the entire speculation if he
chooses pursued the captain and if he dont I cant see but what
youve got to support and bed and board with him to the end of time
I guess it would weary me Then theres Mr Pinkerton of course Hes
been a good friend to you hasnt he Stood by you and all that and
pulled you through for all he was worth


That he has I cried I could never begin telling you my debt to
him

Well and thats a consideration said the captain As a matter of
principle I wouldnt look at this business at the money Not good
enough would be my word But even principle goes under when it comes
to friendsthe right sort I mean This Pinkerton is frightened and
he seems sick the medico dont seem to care a cent about his state of
health and youve got to figure how you would like it if he came to
die Remember the risk of this little swindle is all yours its no
sort of risk to Mr Pinkerton Well youve got to put it that way
plainly and see how you like the sound of it my friend Pinkerton is in
danger of the New Jerusalem I am in danger of San Quentin which risk
do I propose to run

Thats an ugly way to put it I objected and perhaps hardly fair
Theres right and wrong to be considered

Dont know the parties replied Nares and Im coming to them
anyway For it strikes me when it came to smuggling opium you walked
right up

So I did I said sick I am to have to say it

All the same continued Nares you went into the opiumsmuggling with
your head down and a good deal of fussing Ive listened to that you
hadnt more of it to smuggle Now maybe your partners not quite fixed
the same as you are maybe he sees precious little difference between
the one thing and the other

You could not say truer he sees none I do believe cried I and
though I see one I could never tell you how

We never can said the oracular Nares taste is all a matter of
opinion But the point is how will your friend take it You refuse a
favour and you take the high horse at the same time you disappoint
him and you rap him over the knuckles It wont do Mr Dodd no
friendship can stand that You must be as good as your friend or as bad
as your friend or start on a fresh deal without him

I dont see it said I You dont know Jim

Well you WILL see said Nares And now heres another point This
bit of money looks mighty big to Mr Pinkerton it may spell life or
health to him but among all your creditors I dont see that it amounts
to a hill of beansI dont believe itll pay their carfares all round
And dont you think youll ever get thanked You were known to pay a
long price for the chance of rummaging that wreck you do the rummaging
you come home and you hand over ten thousandor twenty if you likea
part of which youll have to own up you made by smuggling and mind
youll never get Billy Fowler to stick his name to a receipt Now just
glance at the transaction from the outside and see what a clear case it
makes Your ten thousand is a sop and people will only wonder you were
so damned impudent as to offer such a small one Whichever way you take
it Mr Dodd the bottoms out of your character so theres one thing
less to be considered

I daresay youll scarce believe me said I but I feel that a
positive relief

You must be made some way different from me then returned Nares
And talking about me I might just mention how I stand Youll have
no trouble from meyouve trouble enough of your own and Im friend
enough when a friends in need to shut my eyes and go right where he
tells me All the same Im rather queerly fixed My ownersll have
to rank with the rest on their charterparty Here am I their
representative and I have to look over the ships side while the
bankrupt walks his assets ashore in Mr Speedys hatbox Its a thing
I wouldnt do for James G Blaine but Ill do it for you Mr Dodd and
only sorry I cant do more

Thank you captain my mind is made up said I Ill go straight
RUAT COELUM I never understood that old tag before tonight

I hope it isnt my business that decides you asked the captain

Ill never deny it was an element said I I hope I hope Im not
cowardly I hope I could steal for Jim myself but when it comes to
dragging in you and Speedy and this one and the other why Jim has
got to die and theres an end Ill try and work for him when I get to
Frisco I suppose and I suppose Ill fail and look on at his death
and kick myself it cant be helpedIll fight it on this line


I dont say as youre wrong replied Nares and Ill be hanged if
I know if youre right It suits me anyway And look herehadnt you
better just show our friends over the side he added no good of being
at the risk and worry of smuggling for the benefit of creditors

I dont think of the creditors said I But Ive kept this pair so
long I havent got the brass to fire them now

Indeed I believe that was my only reason for entering upon a
transaction which was now outside my interest but which as it chanced
repaid me fiftyfold in entertainment Fowler and Sharpe were both
preternaturally sharp they did me the honour in the beginning to
attribute to myself their proper vices and before we were done had
grown to regard me with an esteem akin to worship This proud position
I attained by no more recondite arts than telling the mere truth and
unaffectedly displaying my indifference to the result I have doubtless
stated the essentials of all good diplomacy which may be rather
regarded therefore as a grace of state than the effect of management
For to tell the truth is not in itself diplomatic and to have no care
for the result a thing involuntary When I mentioned for instance that
I had but two hundred and forty pounds of drug my smugglers exchanged
meaning glances as who should say Here is a foeman worthy of our
steel But when I carelessly proposed thirtyfive dollars a pound as
an amendment to their offered twenty and wound up with the remark The
whole thing is a matter of moonshine to me gentlemen Take it or want
it and fill your glassesI had the indescribable gratification to
see Sharpe nudge Fowler warningly and Fowler choke down the jovial
acceptance that stood ready on his lips and lamely substitute a Nono
more wine please Mr Dodd Nor was this all for when the affair was
settled at fifty dollars a pounda shrewd stroke of business for my
creditorsand our friends had got on board their whaleboat and shoved
off it appeared they were imperfectly acquainted with the conveyance
of sound upon still water and I had the joy to overhear the following
testimonial

Deep man that Dodd said Sharpe

And the basstoned Fowler echoed Damned if I understand his game

Thus we were left once more alone upon the Norah Creina and the news of
the night and the lamentations of Pinkerton and the thought of my own
harsh decision returned and besieged me in the dark According to
all the rubbish I had read I should have been sustained by the warm
consciousness of virtue Alas I had but the one feeling that I
had sacrificed my sick friend to the fear of prisoncells and stupid
starers And no moralist has yet advanced so far as to number cowardice
amongst the things that are their own reward




CHAPTER XVII LIGHT FROM THE MAN OF WAR


In the early sunlight of the next day we tossed close off the buoy and
saw the city sparkle in its groves about the foot of the Punchbowl and
the masts clustering thick in the small harbour A good breeze which
had risen with the sea carried us triumphantly through the
intricacies of the passage and we had soon brought up not far from the
landingstairs I remember to have remarked an ugly horned reptile of a
modern warship in the usual moorings across the port but my mind was so
profoundly plunged in melancholy that I paid no heed

Indeed I had little time at my disposal Messieurs Sharpe and Fowler
had left the night before in the persuasion that I was a liar of the
first magnitude the genial belief brought them aboard again with the
earliest opportunity proffering help to one who had proved how little
he required it and hospitality to so respectable a character I had
business to mind I had some need both of assistance and diversion I
liked FowlerI dont know why and in short I let them do with me as
they desired No creditor intervening I spent the first half of the
day inquiring into the conditions of the tea and silk market under
the auspices of Sharpe lunched with him in a private apartment at the
Hawaiian Hotelfor Sharpe was a teetotaler in public and about four
in the afternoon was delivered into the hands of Fowler This gentleman
owned a bungalow on the Waikiki beach and there in company with
certain young bloods of Honolulu I was entertained to a seabathe
indiscriminate cocktails a dinner a hulahula and to round off the
night poker and assorted liquors To lose money in the small hours to
pale intoxicated youth has always appeared to me a pleasure overrated
In my then frame of mind I confess I found it even delightful put up
my money or rather my creditors and put down Fowlers champagne with
equal avidity and success and awoke the next morning to a mild headache
and the rather agreeable lees of the last nights excitement The young
bloods many of whom were still far from sober had taken the kitchen
into their own hands vice the Chinaman deposed and since each was
engaged upon a dish of his own and none had the least scruple in
demolishing his neighbours handiwork I became early convinced that
many eggs would be broken and few omelets made The discovery of a jug
of milk and a crust of bread enabled me to stay my appetite and since
it was Sunday when no business could be done and the festivities were
to be renewed that night in the abode of Fowler it occurred to me to
slip silently away and enjoy some air and solitude

I turned seaward under the dead crater known as Diamond Head My way
was for some time under the shade of certain thickets of green thorny
trees dotted with houses Here I enjoyed some pictures of the native
life wideeyed naked children mingled with pigs a youth asleep under
a tree an old gentleman spelling through glasses his Hawaiian Bible
the somewhat embarrassing spectacle of a lady at her bath in a spring
and the glimpse of gaudycoloured gowns in the deep shade of the houses
Thence I found a road along the beach itself wading in sand opposed
and buffeted by the whole weight of the Trade on one hand the
glittering and sounding surf and the bay lively with many sails on the
other precipitous arid gullies and sheer cliffs mounting towards the
crater and the blue sky For all the companionship of skimming vessels
the place struck me with a sense of solitude There came in my head
what I had been told the day before at dinner of a cavern above in
the bowels of the volcano a place only to be visited with the light
of torches a treasurehouse of the bones of priests and warriors and
clamorous with the voice of an unseen river pouring seaward through
the crannies of the mountain At the thought it was revealed to me
suddenly how the bungalows and the Fowlers and the bright busy town
and crowding ships were all children of yesterday and for centuries
before the obscure life of the natives with its glories and ambitions
its joys and crimes and agonies had rolled unseen like the mountain
river in that seagirt place Not Chaldea appeared more ancient nor
the Pyramids of Egypt more abstruse and I heard time measured by
the drums and tramplings of immemorial conquests and saw myself
the creature of an hour Over the bankruptcy of Pinkerton and Dodd
of Montana Block S F and the conscientious troubles of the junior
partner the spirit of eternity was seen to smile

To this mood of philosophic sadness my excesses of the night before no
doubt contributed for more things than virtue are at times their own
reward but I was greatly healed at least of my distresses And while I
was yet enjoying my abstracted humour a turn of the beach brought me in
view of the signalstation with its watchhouse and flagstaff perched
on the immediate margin of a cliff The house was new and clean and
bald and stood naked to the Trades The wind beat about it in loud
squalls the seaward windows rattled without mercy the breach of the
surf below contributed its increment of noise and the fall of my foot
in the narrow verandah passed unheard by those within

There were two on whom I thus entered unexpectedly the lookout
man with grizzled beard keen seamans eyes and that brand on his
countenance that comes of solitary living and a visitor an oldish
oratorical fellow in the smart tropical array of the British
manowars man perched on a table and smoking a cigar I was
made pleasantly welcome and was soon listening with amusement to the
sealawyer

No if I hadnt have been born an Englishman was one of his
sentiments damn me Id rather a been born a Frenchy Id like to see
another nation fit to black their boots Presently after he developed
his views on home politics with similar trenchancy Id rather be a
brute beast than what Id be a liberal he said Carrying banners and
that a pigs got more sense Why look at our chief engineerthey do
say he carried a banner with his own ands Hooroar for Gladstone I
suppose or Down with the Aristocracy What arm does the aristocracy
do Show me a country any good without one Not the States why its
the ome of corruption I knew a manhe was a good man ome bornwho
was signal quartermaster in the Wyandotte He told me he could never
have got there if he hadnt have run with the boystold it me as Im
telling you Now were all British subjects here he was going on

I am afraid I am an American I said apologetically

He seemed the least bit taken aback but recovered himself and with the
ready tact of his betters paid me the usual British compliment on the
riposte You dont say so he exclaimed Well I give you my word of
honour Id never have guessed it Nobody could tell it on you said
he as though it were some form of liquor

I thanked him as I always do at this particular stage with his
compatriots not so much perhaps for the compliment to myself and my
poor country as for the revelation which is ever fresh to me of
Britannic selfsufficiency and taste And he was so far softened by my
gratitude as to add a word of praise on the American method of lacing
sails Youre ahead of us in lacing sails he said You can say that
with a clear conscience

Thank you I replied I shall certainly do so

At this rate we got along swimmingly and when I rose to retrace my
steps to the Fowlery he at once started to his feet and offered me the
welcome solace of his company for the return I believe I discovered
much alacrity at the idea for the creature who seemed to be unique
or to represent a type like that of the dodo entertained me hugely
But when he had produced his hat I found I was in the way of more
than entertainment for on the ribbon I could read the legend HMS
Tempest

I say I began when our adieus were paid and we were scrambling down
the path from the lookout it was your ship that picked up the men on
board the Flying Scud wasnt it

You may say so said he And a blessed good job for the FlyingScuds
Its a Godforsaken spot that Midway Island

Ive just come from there said I It was I who bought the wreck

Beg your pardon sir cried the sailor genlemn in the white
schooner

The same said I

My friend saluted as though we were now for the first time formally
introduced

Of course I continued I am rather taken up with the whole story
and I wish you would tell me what you can of how the men were saved

It was like this said he We had orders to call at Midway after
castaways and had our distance pretty nigh run down the day before
We steamed halfspeed all night looking to make it about noon for old
Tootlesbeg your pardon sirthe captainwas precious scared of the
place at night Well theres nasty filthy currents round that Midway
YOU know as has been there and one on em must have set us down
Leastways about six bells when we had ought to been miles away some
one sees a sail and lo and beold there was the spars of a fullrigged
brig We raised her pretty fast and the island after her and made out
she was hard aground canted on her bilge and had her ensn flying
union down It was breaking igh on the reef and we laid well out and
sent a couple of boats I didnt go in neither only stood and looked
on but it seems they was all badly scared and muddled and didnt know
which end was uppermost One on em kep snivelling and wringing of his
ands he come on board all of a sop like a monthly nurse That Trent
he come first with his and in a bloody rag I was near em as I am to
you and I could make out he was all to bitseard his breath rattle
in his blooming lungs as he come down the ladder Yes they was a scared
lot small blame to em I say The next after Trent come him as was
mate

Goddedaal I exclaimed

And a good name for him too chuckled the manowars man who
probably confounded the word with a familiar oath A good name
too only it werent his He was a genlemn born sir as had gone
maskewerading One of our officers knowed him at ome reckonises him
steps up olds out his and right off and says he Ullo Norrie
old chappie he says The other was coming up as bold as look at it
didnt seem put outthats where blood tells sir Well no sooner does
he ear his born name given him than he turns as white as the Day of
Judgment stares at Mr Sebright like he was looking at a ghost and
then I give you my word of honour turned to and doubled up in a dead
faint Take him down to my berth says Mr Sebright Tis poor old
Norrie Carthew he says

And whatwhat sort of a gentleman was this Mr Carthew I gasped

The wardroom steward told me he was come of the best blood in
England was my friends reply Eton and Arrow bredand might have
been a barnet

No but to look at I corrected him


The same as you or me was the uncompromising answer not much to
look at I didnt know he was a genlemn but then I never see him
cleaned up

How was that I cried O yes I remember he was sick all the way to
Frisco was he not

Sick or sorry or something returned my informant My belief he
didnt hanker after showing up He kep close the wardroom steward
what took his meals in told me he ate nex to nothing and he was
fetched ashore at Frisco on the quiet Here was how it was It seems
his brother had took and died him as had the estate This one had gone
in for his beer by what I could make out the old folks at ome had
turned rusty no one knew where he had gone to Here he was slaving in
a merchant brig shipwrecked on Midway and packing up his duds for a
long voyage in a open boat He comes on board our ship and by God here
he is a landed proprietor and may be in Parliament tomorrow Its no
less than natural he should keep dark so would you and me in the same
box

I daresay said I But you saw more of the others

To be sure says he no arm in them from what I see There was
one Ardy there colonial born he was and had been through a power of
money There was no nonsense about Ardy he had been up and he had
come down and took it so His eart was in the right place and he was
wellinformed and knew French and Latin I believe like a native I
liked that Ardy he was a goodlooking boy too

Did they say much about the wreck I asked

There wasnt much to say I reckon replied the manowars man It
was all in the papers Ardy used to yarn most about the coins he had
gone through he had lived with bookmakers and jockeys and pugs and
actors and all that a precious low lot added this judicious person
But its about here my orse is moored and by your leave Ill be
getting ahead

One moment said I Is Mr Sebright on board

No sir hes ashore today said the sailor I took up a bag for him
to the otel

With that we parted Presently after my friend overtook and passed me on
a hired steed which seemed to scorn its cavalier and I was left in the
dust of his passage a prey to whirling thoughts For I now stood or
seemed to stand on the immediate threshold of these mysteries I knew
the name of the man Dicksonhis name was Carthew I knew where the
money came from that opposed us at the saleit was part of Carthews
inheritance and in my gallery of illustrations to the history of the
wreck one more picture hung perhaps the most dramatic of the series
It showed me the deck of a warship in that distant part of the great
ocean the officers and seamen looking curiously on and a man of birth
and education who had been sailing under an alias on a trading brig
and was now rescued from desperate peril felled like an ox by the
bare sound of his own name I could not fail to be reminded of my
own experience at the Occidental telephone The hero of three styles
Dickson Goddedaal or Carthew must be the owner of a livelyor a
loadedconscience and the reflection recalled to me the photograph
found on board the Flying Scud just such a man I reasoned would be
capable of just such starts and crises and I inclined to think that
Goddedaal or Carthew was the mainspring of the mystery

One thing was plain as long as the Tempest was in reach I must make
the acquaintance of both Sebright and the doctor To this end I excused
myself with Mr Fowler returned to Honolulu and passed the remainder
of the day hanging vainly round the cool verandahs of the hotel It was
near nine oclock at night before I was rewarded

That is the gentleman you were asking for said the clerk

I beheld a man in tweeds of an incomparable languor of demeanour and
carrying a cane with genteel effort From the name I had looked to find
a sort of Viking and young ruler of the battle and the tempest and I
was the more disappointed and not a little alarmed to come face to
face with this impracticable type

I believe I have the pleasure of addressing Lieutenant Sebright said
I stepping forward

Aw yes replied the hero but aw I dawnt knaw you do I He
spoke for all the world like Lord Foppington in the old playa proof of
the perennial nature of mans affectations But his limping dialect I
scorn to continue to reproduce


It was with the intention of making myself known that I have taken
this step said I entirely unabashed for impudence begets in me its
likeperhaps my only martial attribute We have a common subject of
interest to me very lively and I believe I may be in a position to be
of some service to a friend of yoursto give him at least some very
welcome information

The last clause was a sop to my conscience I could not pretend even
to myself either the power or the will to serve Mr Carthew but I felt
sure he would like to hear the Flying Scud was burned

I dont knowII dont understand you stammered my victim I dont
have any friends in Honolulu dont you know

The friend to whom I refer is English I replied It is Mr Carthew
whom you picked up at Midway My firm has bought the wreck I am just
returned from breaking her up andto make my business quite clear to
youI have a communication it is necessary I should make and have to
trouble you for Mr Carthews address

It will be seen how rapidly I had dropped all hope of interesting
the frigid British bear He on his side was plainly on thorns at my
insistence I judged he was suffering torments of alarm lest I should
prove an undesirable acquaintance diagnosed him for a shy dull vain
unamiable animal without adequate defencea sort of dishoused snail
and concluded rightly enough that he would consent to anything to
bring our interview to a conclusion A moment later he had fled
leaving me with a sheet of paper thus inscribed

Norris Carthew

StallbridgeleCarthew

Dorset

I might have cried victory the field of battle and some of the enemys
baggage remaining in my occupation As a matter of fact my moral
sufferings during the engagement had rivalled those of Mr Sebright I
was left incapable of fresh hostilities I owned that the navy of old
England was for me invincible as of yore and giving up all thought of
the doctor inclined to salute her veteran flag in the future from a
prudent distance Such was my inclination when I retired to rest and
my first experience the next morning strengthened it to certainty For I
had the pleasure of encountering my fair antagonist on his way on board
and he honoured me with a recognition so disgustingly dry that my
impatience overflowed and recalling the tactics of Nelson I neglected
to perceive or to return it

Judge of my astonishment some halfhour later to receive a note of
invitation from the Tempest

Dear Sir it began we are all naturally very much interested in
the wreck of the Flying Scud and as soon as I mentioned that I had the
pleasure of making your acquaintance a very general wish was expressed
that you would come and dine on board It will give us all the greatest
pleasure to see you tonight or in case you should be otherwise
engaged to luncheon either tomorrow or today A note of the hours
followed and the document wound up with the name of J Lascelles
Sebright under an undeniable statement that he was sincerely mine

No Mr Lascelles Sebright I reflected you are not but I begin
to suspect that like the lady in the song you are anothers You have
mentioned your adventure my friend you have been blown up you have
got your orders this note has been dictated and I am asked on board
in spite of your melancholy protests not to meet the men and not
to talk about the Flying Scud but to undergo the scrutiny of some one
interested in Carthew the doctor for a wager And for a second wager
all this springs from your facility in giving the address I lost no
time in answering the billet electing for the earliest occasion and at
the appointed hour a somewhat blackguardlooking boats crew from the
Norah Creina conveyed me under the guns of the Tempest

The wardroom appeared pleased to see me Sebrights brother officers
in contrast to himself took a boyish interest in my cruise and much
was talked of the Flying Scud of how she had been lost of how I had
found her and of the weather the anchorage and the currents
about Midway Island Carthew was referred to more than once without
embarrassment the parallel case of a late Earl of Aberdeen who died
mate on board a Yankee schooner was adduced If they told me little
of the man it was because they had not much to tell and only felt an
interest in his recognition and pity for his prolonged illhealth I
could never think the subject was avoided and it was clear that the
officers far from practising concealment had nothing to conceal

So far then all seemed natural and yet the doctor troubled me This
was a tall rugged plain man on the wrong side of fifty already gray
and with a restless mouth and bushy eyebrows he spoke seldom but then
with gaiety and his great quaking silent laughter was infectious
I could make out that he was at once the quiz of the wardroom and
perfectly respected and I made sure that he observed me covertly It is
certain I returned the compliment If Carthew had feigned sicknessand
all seemed to point in that directionhere was the man who knew
allor certainly knew much His strong sterling face progressively and
silently persuaded of his full knowledge That was not the mouth these
were not the eyes of one who would act in ignorance or could be led
at random Nor again was it the face of a man squeamish in the case of
malefactors there was even a touch of Brutus there and something of
the hanging judge In short he seemed the last character for the part
assigned him in my theories and wonder and curiosity contended in my
mind

Luncheon was over and an adjournment to the smokingroom proposed when
upon a sudden impulse I burned my ships and pleading indisposition
requested to consult the doctor

There is nothing the matter with my body Dr Urquart said I as soon
as we were alone

He hummed his mouth worked he regarded me steadily with his gray eyes
but resolutely held his peace


I want to talk to you about the Flying Scud and Mr Carthew I
resumed Come you must have expected this I am sure you know all you
are shrewd and must have a guess that I know much How are we to stand
to one another and how am I to stand to Mr Carthew

I do not fully understand you he replied after a pause and then
after another It is the spirit I refer to Mr Dodd

The spirit of my inquiries I asked

He nodded


I think we are at crosspurposes said I The spirit is precisely
what I came in quest of I bought the Flying Scud at a ruinous figure
run up by Mr Carthew through an agent and I am in consequence a
bankrupt But if I have found no fortune in the wreck I have found
unmistakable evidences of foul play Conceive my position I am ruined
through this man whom I never saw I might very well desire revenge
or compensation and I think you will admit I have the means to extort
either

He made no sign in answer to this challenge

Can you not understand then I resumed the spirit in which I come
to one who is surely in the secret and ask him honestly and plainly
How do I stand to Mr Carthew

I must ask you to be more explicit said he

You do not help me much I retorted But see if you can understand
my conscience is not very finespun still I have one Now there are
degrees of foul play to some of which I have no particular objection
I am sure with Mr Carthew I am not at all the person to forgo an
advantage and I have much curiosity But on the other hand I have no
taste for persecution and I ask you to believe that I am not the man to
make bad worse or heap trouble on the unfortunate

Yes I think I understand said he Suppose I pass you my word that
whatever may have occurred there were excusesgreat excusesI may
say very great

It would have weight with me doctor I replied

I may go further he pursued Suppose I had been there or you had
been there after a certain event had taken place its a grave question
what we might have doneits even a question what we could have
doneourselves Or take me I will be plain with you and own that I am
in possession of the facts You have a shrewd guess how I have acted in
that knowledge May I ask you to judge from the character of my action
something of the nature of that knowledge which I have no call nor yet
no title to share with you

I cannot convey a sense of the rugged conviction and judicial emphasis
of Dr Urquarts speech To those who did not hear him it may appear as
if he fed me on enigmas to myself who heard I seemed to have received
a lesson and a compliment

I thank you I said I feel you have said as much as possible and
more than I had any right to ask I take that as a mark of confidence
which I will try to deserve I hope sir you will let me regard you as
a friend

He evaded my proffered friendship with a blunt proposal to rejoin the
mess and yet a moment later contrived to alleviate the snub For as
we entered the smokingroom he laid his hand on my shoulder with a kind
familiarity

I have just prescribed for Mr Dodd says he a glass of our
Madeira

I have never again met Dr Urquart but he wrote himself so clear
upon my memory that I think I see him still And indeed I had cause to
remember the man for the sake of his communication It was hard enough
to make a theory fit the circumstances of the Flying Scud but one in
which the chief actor should stand the least excused and might retain
the esteem or at least the pity of a man like Dr Urquart failed me
utterly Here at least was the end of my discoveries I learned no more
till I learned all and my reader has the evidence complete Is he more
astute than I was or like me does he give it up




CHAPTER XVIII CROSSQUESTIONS AND CROOKED ANSWERS


I have said hard words of San Francisco they must scarce be literally
understood one cannot suppose the Israelites did justice to the land of
Pharaoh and the city took a fine revenge of me on my return She had
never worn a more becoming guise the sun shone the air was lively the
people had flowers in their buttonholes and smiles upon their faces
and as I made my way towards Jims place of employment with some very
black anxieties at heart I seemed to myself a blot on the surrounding
gaiety

My destination was in a bystreet in a mean rickety building The
Franklin H Dodge Steam Printing Company appeared upon its front and
in characters of greater freshness so as to suggest recent conversion
the watchcry White Labour Only In the office in a dusty pen
Jim sat alone before a table A wretched change had overtaken him in
clothes body and bearing he looked sick and shabby he who had once
rejoiced in his days employment like a horse among pastures now sat
staring on a column of accounts idly chewing a pen at times heavily
sighing the picture of inefficiency and inattention He was sunk deep
in a painful reverie he neither saw nor heard me and I stood and
watched him unobserved I had a sudden vain relenting Repentance
bludgeoned me As I had predicted to Nares I stood and kicked myself
Here was I come home again my honour saved there was my friend in want
of rest nursing and a generous diet and I asked myself with Falstaff
What is in that word honour what is that honour and like Falstaff
I told myself that it was air

Jim said I

Loudon he gasped and jumped from his chair and stood shaking

The next moment I was over the barrier and we were hand in hand

My poor old man I cried

Thank God youre home at last he gulped and kept patting my
shoulder with his hand

Ive no good news for you Jim said I

Youve comethats the good news that I want he replied O how
Ive longed for you Loudon

I couldnt do what you wrote me I said lowering my voice The
creditors have it all I couldnt do it

Ssh returned Jim I was crazy when wrote I could never have looked
Mamie in the face if we had done it O Loudon what a gift that woman
is You think you know something of life you just dont know anything
Its the GOODNESS of the woman its a revelation

Thats all right said I Thats how I hoped to hear you Jim

And so the Flying Scud was a fraud he resumed I didnt quite
understand your letter but I made out that

Fraud is a mild term for it said I The creditors will never believe
what fools we were And that reminds me I continued rejoicing in the
transition how about the bankruptcy

You were lucky to be out of that answered Jim shaking his head
you were lucky not to see the papers The _Occidental_ called me a
fifthrate Kerbstone broker with water on the brain another said I was
a treefrog that had got into the same meadow with Longhurst and
had blown myself out till I went pop It was rough on a man in his
honeymoon so was what they said about my looks and what I had on and
the way I perspired But I braced myself up with the Flying Scud How
did it exactly figure out anyway I dont seem to catch on to that
story Loudon

The devil you dont thinks I to myself and then aloud You see
we had neither one of us good luck I didnt do much more than cover
current expenses and you got floored immediately How did we come to go
so soon

Well well have to have a talk over all this said Jim with a sudden
start I should be getting to my books and I guess you had better
go up right away to Mamie Shes at Speedys She expects you with
impatience She regards you in the light of a favourite brother
Loudon

Any scheme was welcome which allowed me to postpone the hour of
explanation and avoid were it only for a breathing space the topic
of the Flying Scud I hastened accordingly to Bush Street Mrs Speedy
already rejoicing in the return of a spouse hailed me with acclamation
And its beautiful youre looking Mr Dodd my dear she was kind
enough to say And a miracle they naygur waheenies let ye lave the
oilands I have my suspicions of Shpeedy she added roguishly Did ye
see him after the naygresses now

I gave Speedy an unblemished character

The one of ye will niver bethray the other said the playful dame and
ushered me into a bare room where Mamie sat working a typewriter

I was touched by the cordiality of her greeting With the prettiest
gesture in the world she gave me both her hands wheeled forth a chair
and produced from a cupboard a tin of my favourite tobacco and a book
of my exclusive cigarette papers

There she cried you see Mr Loudon we were all prepared for you
the things were bought the very day you sailed

I imagined she had always intended me a pleasant welcome but the
certain fervour of sincerity which I could not help remarking flowed
from an unexpected source Captain Nares with a kindness for which
I can never be sufficiently grateful had stolen a moment from his
occupations driven to call on Mamie and drawn her a generous picture
of my prowess at the wreck She was careful not to breathe a word of
this interview till she had led me on to tell my adventures for myself

Ah Captain Nares was better she cried when I had done From your
account I have only learned one new thing that you are modest as well
as brave

I cannot tell with what sort of disclamation I sought to reply

It is of no use said Mamie I know a hero And when I heard of you
working all day like a common labourer with your hands bleeding and
your nails brokenand how you told the captain to crack on I think
he said in the storm when he was terrified himselfand the danger
of that horrid mutinyNares had been obligingly dipping his brush in
earthquake and eclipseand how it was all done in part at least for
Jim and meI felt we could never say how we admired and thanked you

Mamie I cried dont talk of thanks it is not a word to be used
between friends Jim and I have been prosperous together now we shall
be poor together Weve done our best and thats all that need be said
The next thing is for me to find a situation and send you and Jim up
country for a long holiday in the redwoodsfor a holiday Jim has got to
have

Jim cant take your money Mr Loudon said Mamie

Jim cried I Hes got to Didnt I take his

Presently after Jim himself arrived and before he had yet done mopping
his brow he was at me with the accursed subject Now Loudon said
he here we are all together the days work done and the evening
before us just start in with the whole story

One word on business first said I speaking from the lips outward
and meanwhile in the private apartments of my brain trying for the
thousandth time to find some plausible arrangement of my story I want
to have a notion how we stand about the bankruptcy

O thats ancient history cried Jim We paid seven cents and a
wonder we did as well The receiver methought a spasm seized him
at the name of this official and he broke off But its all past
and done with anyway and what I want to get at is the facts about the
wreck I dont seem to understand it appears to me like as there was
something underneath

There was nothing IN it anyway I said with a forced laugh

Thats what I want to judge of returned Jim

How the mischief is it I can never keep you to that bankruptcy It
looks as if you avoided it said Ifor a man in my situation with
unpardonable folly

Dont it look a little as if you were trying to avoid the wreck asked
Jim

It was my own doing there was no retreat My dear fellow if you make
a point of it here goes said I and launched with spurious gaiety
into the current of my tale I told it with point and spirit described
the island and the wreck mimicked Anderson and the Chinese maintained
the suspense My pen has stumbled on the fatal word I maintained the
suspense so well that it was never relieved and when I stoppedI dare
not say concluded where there was no conclusionI found Jim and Mamie
regarding me with surprise

Well said Jim

Well thats all said I

But how do you explain it he asked

I cant explain it said I


Mamie wagged her head ominously

But great Caesars ghost the money was offered cried Jim It wont
do Loudon its nonsense on the face of it I dont say but what you
and Nares did your best Im sure of course you did but I do say you
got fooled I say the stuff is in that ship today and I say I mean to
get it

There is nothing in the ship I tell you but old wood and iron said
I

Youll see said Jim Next time I go myself Ill take Mamie for the
trip Longhurst wont refuse me the expense of a schooner You wait till
I get the searching of her

But you cant search her cried I Shes burned

Burned cried Mamie starting a little from the attitude of quiescent
capacity in which she had hitherto sat to hear me her hands folded in
her lap

There was an appreciable pause

I beg your pardon Loudon began Jim at last but why in snakes did
you burn her

It was an idea of Naress said I

This is certainly the strangest circumstance of all observed Mamie

I must say Loudon it does seem kind of unexpected added Jim It
seems kind of crazy even What did youwhat did Nares expect to gain by
burning her

I dont know it didnt seem to matter we had got all there was to
get said I

Thats the very point cried Jim It was quite plain you hadnt

What made you so sure asked Mamie

How can I tell you I cried We had been all through her We WERE
sure thats all that I can say


I begin to think you were she returned with a significant emphasis

Jim hurriedly intervened What I dont quite make out Loudon is that
you dont seem to appreciate the peculiarities of the thing said he
It doesnt seem to have struck you same as it does me

Pshaw why go on with this cried Mamie suddenly rising Mr Dodd is
not telling us either what he thinks or what he knows

Mamie cried Jim

You need not be concerned for his feelings James he is not concerned
for yours returned the lady He dare not deny it besides And this
is not the first time he has practised reticence Have you forgotten
that he knew the address and did not tell it you until that man had
escaped

Jim turned to me pleadinglywe were all on our feet Loudon he said
you see Mamie has some fancy and I must say theres just a sort of a
shadow of an excuse for it IS bewilderingeven to me Loudon with my
trained business intelligence For Gods sake clear it up

This serves me right said I I should not have tried to keep you in
the dark I should have told you at first that I was pledged to secrecy
I should have asked you to trust me in the beginning It is all I can
do now There is more of the story but it concerns none of us and my
tongue is tied I have given my word of honour You must trust me and
try to forgive me

I daresay I am very stupid Mr Dodd began Mamie with an alarming
sweetness but I thought you went upon this trip as my husbands
representative and with my husbands money You tell us now that you
are pledged but I should have thought you were pledged first of all
to James You say it does not concern us we are poor people and my
husband is sick and it concerns us a great deal to understand how we
come to have lost our money and why our representative comes back to
us with nothing You ask that we should trust you you do not seem to
understand the question we are asking ourselves is whether we have not
trusted you too much

I do not ask you to trust me I replied I ask Jim He knows me

You think you can do what you please with James you trust to his
affection do you not And me I suppose you do not consider said
Mamie But it was perhaps an unfortunate day for you when we were
married for I at least am not blind The crew run away the ship is
sold for a great deal of money you know that mans address and you
conceal it you do not find what you were sent to look for and yet you
burn the ship and now when we ask explanations you are pledged to
secrecy But I am pledged to no such thing I will not stand by in
silence and see my sick and ruined husband betrayed by his condescending
friend I will give you the truth for once Mr Dodd you have been
bought and sold

Mamie cried Jim no more of this Its me youre striking its only
me you hurt You dont know you cannot understand these things Why
today if it hadnt been for Loudon I couldnt have looked you in the
face He saved my honesty

I have heard plenty of this talk before she replied You are a
sweethearted fool and I love you for it But I am a clearheaded
woman my eyes are open and I understand this mans hypocrisy Did he
not come here today and pretend he would take a situationpretend he
would share his hardearned wages with us until you were well Pretend
It makes me furious His wages a share of his wages That would have
been your pittance that would have been your share of the Flying
Scudyou who worked and toiled for him when he was a beggar in the
streets of Paris But we do not want your charity thank God I can work
for my own husband See what it is to have obliged a gentleman He would
let you pick him up when he was begging he would stand and look on and
let you black his shoes and sneer at you For you were always sneering
at my James you always looked down upon him in your heart you know
it She turned back to Jim And now when he is rich she began and
then swooped again on me For you are rich I dare you to deny it I
defy you to look me in the face and try to deny that you are richrich
with our moneymy husbands money

Heaven knows to what a height she might have risen being by this time
bodily whirled away in her own hurricane of words Heartsickness
a black depression a treacherous sympathy with my assailant pity
unutterable for poor Jim already filled divided and abashed my
spirit Flight seemed the only remedy and making a private sign to Jim
as if to ask permission I slunk from the unequal field

I was but a little way down the street when I was arrested by the sound
of some one running and Jims voice calling me by name He had followed
me with a letter which had been long awaiting my return

I took it in a dream This has been a devil of a business said I

Dont think hard of Mamie he pleaded Its the way shes made its
her hightoned loyalty And of course I know its all right I know your
sterling character but you didnt somehow make out to give us the
thing straight Loudon Anybody might haveI mean itI mean

Never mind what you mean my poor Jim said I Shes a gallant little
woman and a loyal wife and I thought her splendid My story was as
fishy as the devil Ill never think the less of either her or you

Itll blow over it must blow over said he

It never can I returned sighing and dont you try to make it
Dont name me unless its with an oath And get home to her right away
Good by my best of friends Good by and God bless you We shall never
meet again

O Loudon that we should live to say such words he cried

I had no views on life beyond an occasional impulse to commit suicide
or to get drunk and drifted down the street semiconscious walking
apparently on air in the lightheadedness of grief I had money in my
pocket whether mine or my creditors I had no means of guessing and
the Poodle Dog lying in my path I went mechanically in and took
a table A waiter attended me and I suppose I gave my orders for
presently I found myself with a sudden return of consciousness
beginning dinner On the white cloth at my elbow lay the letter
addressed in a clerks hand and bearing an English stamp and the
Edinburgh postmark A bowl of bouillon and a glass of wine awakened in
one corner of my brain where all the rest was in mourning the blinds
down as for a funeral a faint stir of curiosity and while I waited the
next course wondering the while what I had ordered I opened and began
to read the epochmaking document

DEAR SIR I am charged with the melancholy duty of announcing to you
the death of your excellent grandfather Mr Alexander Loudon on
the 17th ult On Sunday the 13th he went to church as usual in the
forenoon and stopped on his way home at the corner of Princes Street
in one of our seasonable east winds to talk with an old friend The
same evening acute bronchitis declared itself from the first Dr
MCombie anticipated a fatal result and the old gentleman appeared to
have no illusion as to his own state He repeatedly assured me it
was by with him now and high time too he once added with
characteristic asperity He was not in the least changed on the approach
of death only what I am sure must be very grateful to your feelings
he seemed to think and speak even more kindly than usual of yourself
referring to you as Jeannies yin with strong expressions of regard
He was the only one I ever liket of the hale jingbang was one of his
expressions and you will be glad to know that he dwelt particularly
on the dutiful respect you had always displayed in your relations
The small codicil by which he bequeaths you his Molesworth and other
professional works was added you will observe on the day before his
death so that you were in his thoughts until the end I should say
that though rather a trying patient he was most tenderly nursed by
your uncle and your cousin Miss Euphemia I enclose a copy of the
testament by which you will see that you share equally with Mr Adam

W RUTHERFORD GREGG

God bless the old gentleman I thought and for that matter God bless
Uncle Adam and my cousin Euphemia and Mr Gregg I had a vision of
that grey old life now brought to an endand high time tooa vision
of those Sabbath streets alternately vacant and filled with silent
people of the babel of the bells the longdrawn psalmody the shrewd
sting of the east wind the hollow echoing dreary house to which
Ecky had returned with the hand of death already on his shoulder a
vision too of the long rough country lad perhaps a serious courtier
of the lasses in the hawthorn den perhaps a rustic dancer on the green
who had first earned and answered to that harsh diminutive And I asked
myself if on the whole poor Ecky had succeeded in life if the last
state of that man were not on the whole worse than the first and the
house in Randolph Crescent a less admirable dwelling than the hamlet
where he saw the day and grew to manhood Here was a consolatory thought
for one who was himself a failure

Yes I declare the word came in my mind and all the while in another
partition of the brain I was glowing and singing for my newfound
opulence The pile of goldfour thousand two hundred and fifty double
eagles seventeen thousand ugly sovereigns twentyone thousand two
hundred and fifty Napoleonsdanced and rang and ran molten and lit
up life with their effulgence in the eye of fancy Here were all things
made plain to me ParadiseParis I meanRegained Carthew protected
Jim restored the creditors

The creditors I repeated and sank back benumbed It was all theirs
to the last farthing my grandfather had died too soon to save me

I must have somewhere a rare vein of decision In that revolutionary
moment I found myself prepared for all extremes except the one ready
to do anything or to go anywhere so long as I might save my money
At the worst there was flight flight to some of those blest countries
where the serpent extradition has not yet entered in

 On no condition is extradition
 Allowed in Callao

the old lawless words haunted me and I saw myself hugging my gold in
the company of such men as had once made and sung them in the rude
and bloody wharfside drinkingshops of Chili and Peru The run of my
illluck the breach of my old friendship this bubble fortune flaunted
for a moment in my eyes and snatched again had made me desperate and
in the expressive vulgarism ugly To drink vile spirits among vile
companions by the flare of a pinetorch to go burthened with my furtive
treasure in a belt to fight for it knife in hand rolling on a clay
floor to flee perpetually in fresh ships and to be chased through
the sea from isle to isle seemed in my then frame of mind a welcome
series of events

That was for the worst but it began to dawn slowly on my mind that
there was yet a possible better Once escaped once safe in Callao I
might approach my creditors with a good grace and properly handled by
a cunning agent it was just possible they might accept some easy
composition The hope recalled me to the bankruptcy It was strange I
reflected often as I had questioned Jim he had never obliged me
with an answer In his haste for news about the wreck my own no less
legitimate curiosity had gone disappointed Hateful as the thought was
to me I must return at once and find out where I stood

I left my dinner still unfinished paying for the whole of course and
tossing the waiter a gold piece I was reckless I knew not what was
mine and cared not I must take what I could get and give as I was able
to rob and to squander seemed the complementary parts of my new destiny
I walked up Bush Street whistling brazening myself to confront Mamie
in the first place and the world at large and a certain visionary judge
upon a bench in the second Just outside I stopped and lighted a cigar
to give me greater countenance and puffing this and wearing what I
am sure was a wretched assumption of braggadocio I reappeared on the
scene of my disgrace

My friend and his wife were finishing a poor mealrags of old mutton
the remainder cakes from breakfast eaten cold and a starveling pot of
coffee

I beg your pardon Mrs Pinkerton said I Sorry to inflict my
presence where it cannot be desired but there is a piece of business
necessary to be discussed

Pray do not consider me said Mamie rising and she sailed into the
adjoining bedroom

Jim watched her go and shook his head he looked miserably old and ill

What is it now he asked

Perhaps you remember you answered none of my questions said I


Your questions faltered Jim

Even so Jim My questions I repeated I put questions as well as
yourself and however little I may have satisfied Mamie with my answers
I beg to remind you that you gave me none at all

You mean about the bankruptcy asked Jim

I nodded

He writhed in his chair The straight truth is I was ashamed he
said I was trying to dodge you Ive been playing fast and loose with
you Loudon Ive deceived you from the first I blush to own it And
here you came home and put the very question I was fearing Why did we
bust so soon Your keen business eye had not deceived you Thats the
point thats my shame thats what killed me this afternoon when Mamie
was treating you so and my conscience was telling me all the time Thou
art the man

What was it Jim I asked

What I had been at all the time Loudon he wailed and I dont know
how Im to look you in the face and say it after my duplicity It was
stocks he added in a whisper

And you were afraid to tell me that I cried You poor old
cheerless dreamer what would it matter what you did or didnt Cant
you see were doomed And anyway thats not my point Its how I stand
that I want to know There is a particular reason Am I clear Have I a
certificate or what have I to do to get one And when will it be dated
You cant think what hangs by it

Thats the worst of all said Jim like a man in a dream I cant see
how to tell him

What do you mean I cried a small pang of terror at my heart

Im afraid I sacrificed you Loudon he said looking at me pitifully

Sacrificed me I repeated How What do you mean by sacrifice

I know itll shock your delicate selfrespect he said but what was
I to do Things looked so bad The receiver as usual the name
stuck in his throat and he began afresh There was a lot of talk the
reporters were after me already there was the trouble and all about
the Mexican business and I got scared right out and I guess I lost my
head You werent there you see and that was my temptation

I did not know how long he might thus beat about the bush with dreadful
hintings and I was already beside myself with terror What had he done
I saw he had been tempted I knew from his letters that he was in no
condition to resist How had he sacrificed the absent

Jim I said you must speak right out Ive got all that I can
carry

Well he saidI know it was a libertyI made it out you were no
business man only a stonebroke painter that half the time you didnt
know anything anyway particularly money and accounts I said you never
could be got to understand whose was whose I had to say that because of
some entries in the books

For Gods sake I cried put me out of this agony What did you
accuse me of

Accuse you of repeated Jim Of what Im telling you And there being
no deed of partnership I made out you were only a kind of clerk that
I called a partner just to give you taffy and so I got you ranked
a creditor on the estate for your wages and the money you had lent
And

I believe I reeled A creditor I roared a creditor Im not in the
bankruptcy at all

No said Jim I know it was a liberty

O damn your liberty read that I cried dashing the letter before
him on the table and call in your wife and be done with eating this
truck as I spoke I slung the cold mutton in the empty grateand
lets all go and have a champagne supper Ive dinedIm sure I dont
remember what I had Id dine again ten scores of times upon a night
like this Read it you blaying ass Im not insane Here Mamie I
continued opening the bedroom door come out and make it up with me
and go and kiss your husband and Ill tell you what after the supper
lets go to some place where theres a band and Ill waltz with you
till sunrise

What does it all mean cried Jim

It means we have a champagne supper tonight and all go to Napa Valley
or to Monterey tomorrow said I Mamie go and get your things on
and you Jim sit down right where you are take a sheet of paper and
tell Franklin Dodge to go to Texas Mamie you were right my dear I
was rich all the time and didnt know it




CHAPTER XIX TRAVELS WITH A SHYSTER


The absorbing and disastrous adventure of the Flying Scud was now quite
ended we had dashed into these deep waters and we had escaped again to
starve we had been ruined and were saved had quarrelled and made up
there remained nothing but to sing Te Deum draw a line and begin on a
fresh page of my unwritten diary I do not pretend that I recovered all
I had lost with Mamie it would have been more than I had merited and
I had certainly been more uncommunicative than became either the partner
or the friend But she accepted the position handsomely and during
the week that I now passed with them both she and Jim had the grace
to spare me questions It was to Calistoga that we went there was
some rumour of a Napa landboom at the moment the possibility of stir
attracted Jim and he informed me he would find a certain joy in looking
on much as Napoleon on St Helena took a pleasure to read military
works The field of his ambition was quite closed he was done with
action and looked forward to a ranch in a mountain dingle a patch of
corn a pair of kine a leisurely and contemplative age in the green
shade of forests Just let me get down on my back in a hayfield said
he and youll find theres no more snap to me than that much putty

And for two days the perfervid being actually rested The third he was
observed in consultation with the local editor and owned he was in two
minds about purchasing the press and paper Its a kind of a hold for
an idle man he said pleadingly and if the section was to open up
the way it ought to there might be dollars in the thing On the fourth
day he was gone till dinnertime alone on the fifth we made a long
picnic drive to the fresh field of enterprise and the sixth was passed
entirely in the preparation of prospectuses The pioneer of McBride City
was already upright and selfreliant as of yore the fire rekindled in
his eye the ring restored to his voice a charger sniffing battle and
saying haha among the spears On the seventh morning we signed a deed
of partnership for Jim would not accept a dollar of my money otherwise
and having once more engaged myselfor that mortal part of me my
purseamong the wheels of his machinery I returned alone to San
Francisco and took quarters in the Palace Hotel

The same night I had Nares to dinner His sunburnt face his queer and
personal strain of talk recalled days that were scarce over and that
seemed already distant Through the music of the band outside and the
chink and clatter of the diningroom it seemed to me as if I heard the
foaming of the surf and the voices of the seabirds about Midway Island
The bruises on our hands were not yet healed and there we sat waited
on by elaborate darkies eating pompano and drinking iced champagne

Think of our dinners on the Norah captain and then oblige me by
looking round the room for contrast

He took the scene in slowly Yes it is like a dream he said like
as if the darkies were really about as big as dimes and a great big
scuttle might open up there and Johnson stick in a great big head and
shoulders and cry Eight bellsand the whole thing vanish

Well its the other thing that has done that I replied Its all
bygone now all dead and buried Amen say I

I dont know that Mr Dodd and to tell you the fact I dont believe
it said Nares Theres more Flying Scud in the oven and the bakers
name I take it is Bellairs He tackled me the day we came in sort of
a razee of poor old humanityjury clothesfull new suit of pimples
knew him at once from your description I let him pump me till I saw his
game He knows a good deal that we dont know a good deal that we do
and suspects the balance Theres trouble brewing for somebody

I was surprised I had not thought of this before Bellairs had been
behind the scenes he had known Dickson he knew the flight of the crew
it was hardly possible but what he should suspect it was certain if
he suspected that he would seek to trade on the suspicion And sure
enough I was not yet dressed the next morning ere the lawyer was
knocking at my door I let him in for I was curious and he after some
ambiguous prolegomena roundly proposed I should go shares with him

Shares in what I inquired

If you will allow me to clothe my idea in a somewhat vulgar form said
he I might ask you did you go to Midway for your health

I dont know that I did I replied

Similarly Mr Dodd you may be sure I would never have taken
the present step without influential grounds pursued the lawyer
Intrusion is foreign to my character But you and I sir are engaged
on the same ends If we can continue to work the thing in company
I place at your disposal my knowledge of the law and a considerable
practice in delicate negotiations similar to this Should you refuse to
consent you might find in me a formidable andhe hesitatedand to
my own regret perhaps a dangerous competitor

Did you get this by heart I asked genially

I advise YOU to he said with a sudden sparkle of temper and menace
instantly gone instantly succeeded by fresh cringing I assure
you sir I arrive in the character of a friend and I believe you
underestimate my information If I may instance an example I am
acquainted to the last dime with what you made or rather lost and I
know you have since cashed a considerable draft on London

What do you infer I asked

I know where that draft came from he cried wincing back like one who
has greatly dared and instantly regrets the venture

So said I

You forget I was Mr Dicksons confidential agent he explained You
had his address Mr Dodd We were the only two that he communicated
with in San Francisco You see my deductions are quite obvious you
see how open and frank I deal with you as I should wish to do with
any gentleman with whom I was conjoined in business You see how much
I know and it can scarcely escape your strong commonsense how much
better it would be if I knew all You cannot hope to get rid of me at
this time of day I have my place in the affair I cannot be shaken off
I am if you will excuse a rather technical pleasantry an encumbrance
on the estate The actual harm I can do I leave you to valuate for
yourself But without going so far Mr Dodd and without in any way
inconveniencing myself I could make things very uncomfortable For
instance Mr Pinkertons liquidation You and I know sirand you
better than Ion what a large fund you draw Is Mr Pinkerton in
the thing at all It was you only who knew the address and you were
concealing it Suppose I should communicate with Mr Pinkerton

Look here I interrupted communicate with him if you will permit
me to clothe my idea in a vulgar shape till you are blue in the face
There is only one person with whom I refuse to allow you to communicate
further and that is myself Good morning

He could not conceal his rage disappointment and surprise and in the
passage I have no doubt was shaken by St Vitus

I was disgusted by this interview it struck me hard to be suspected
on all hands and to hear again from this trafficker what I had heard
already from Jims wife and yet my strongest impression was different
and might rather be described as an impersonal fear There was something
against nature in the mans craven impudence it was as though a lamb
had butted me such daring at the hands of such a dastard implied
unchangeable resolve a great pressure of necessity and powerful means
I thought of the unknown Carthew and it sickened me to see this ferret
on his trail

Upon inquiry I found the lawyer was but just disbarred for some
malpractice and the discovery added excessively to my disquiet Here
was a rascal without money or the means of making it thrust out of the
doors of his own trade publicly shamed and doubtless in a deuce of a
bad temper with the universe Here on the other hand was a man with a
secret rich terrified practically in hiding who had been willing
to pay ten thousand pounds for the bones of the Flying Scud I slipped
insensibly into a mental alliance with the victim the business weighed
on me all day long I was wondering how much the lawyer knew how much
he guessed and when he would open his attack

Some of these problems are unsolved to this day others were soon made
clear Where he got Carthews name is still a mystery perhaps some
sailor on the Tempest perhaps my own sealawyer served him for a tool
but I was actually at his elbow when he learned the address It fell
so One evening when I had an engagement and was killing time until the
hour I chanced to walk in the court of the hotel while the band played
The place was bright as day with the electric light and I recognised
at some distance among the loiterers the person of Bellairs in talk
with a gentleman whose face appeared familiar It was certainly some one
I had seen and seen recently but who or where I knew not A porter
standing hard by gave me the necessary hint The stranger was an
English navy man invalided home from Honolulu where he had left his
ship indeed it was only from the change of clothes and the effects
of sickness that I had not immediately recognised my friend and
correspondent Lieutenant Sebright

The conjunction of these planets seeming ominous I drew near but it
seemed Bellairs had done his business he vanished in the crowd and I
found my officer alone

Do you know whom you have been talking to Mr Sebright I began

No said he I dont know him from Adam Anything wrong

He is a disreputable lawyer recently disbarred said I I wish I had
seen you in time I trust you told him nothing about Carthew

He flushed to his ears Im awfully sorry he said He seemed civil
and I wanted to get rid of him It was only the address he asked

And you gave it I cried

Im really awfully sorry said Sebright Im afraid I did

God forgive you was my only comment and I turned my back upon the
blunderer

The fat was in the fire now Bellairs had the address and I was the
more deceived or Carthew would have news of him So strong was this
impression and so painful that the next morning I had the curiosity to
pay the lawyers den a visit An old woman was scrubbing the stair and
the board was down

Lawyer Bellairs said the old woman Gone East this morning Theres
Lawyer Dean next block up

I did not trouble Lawyer Dean but walked slowly back to my hotel
ruminating as I went The image of the old woman washing that desecrated
stair had struck my fancy it seemed that all the watersupply of the
city and all the soap in the State would scarce suffice to cleanse it
it had been so long a clearinghouse of dingy secrets and a factory
of sordid fraud And now the corner was untenanted some judge like a
careful housewife had knocked down the web and the bloated spider was
scuttling elsewhere after new victims I had of late as I have said
insensibly taken sides with Carthew now when his enemy was at his
heels my interest grew more warm and I began to wonder if I could not
help The drama of the Flying Scud was entering on a new phase It had
been singular from the first it promised an extraordinary conclusion
and I who had paid so much to learn the beginning might pay a little
more and see the end I lingered in San Francisco indemnifying myself
after the hardships of the cruise spending money regretting it
continually promising departure for the morrow Why not go indeed and
keep a watch upon Bellairs If I missed him there was no harm done I
was the nearer Paris If I found and kept his trail it was hard if
I could not put some stick in his machinery and at the worst I could
promise myself interesting scenes and revelations

In such a mixed humour I made up what it pleases me to call my mind
and once more involved myself in the story of Carthew and the Flying
Scud The same night I wrote a letter of farewell to Jim and one of
anxious warning to Dr Urquart begging him to set Carthew on his guard
the morrow saw me in the ferryboat and ten days later I was walking
the hurricane deck on the City of Denver By that time my mind was
pretty much made down again its natural condition I told myself that
I was bound for Paris or Fontainebleau to resume the study of the arts
and I thought no more of Carthew or Bellairs or only to smile at my own
fondness The one I could not serve even if I wanted the other I had
no means of finding even if I could have at all influenced him after he
was found

And for all that I was close on the heels of an absurd adventure My
neighbour at table that evening was a Frisco man whom I knew slightly
I found he had crossed the plains two days in front of me and this was
the first steamer that had left New York for Europe since his arrival
Two days before me meant a day before Bellairs and dinner was scarce
done before I was closeted with the purser

Bellairs he repeated Not in the saloon I am sure He may be in
the second class The lists are not made out butHullo Harry D
Bellairs That the name Hes there right enough

And the next morning I saw him on the forward deck sitting in a chair
a book in his hand a shabby puma skin rug about his knees the picture
of respectable decay Off and on I kept him in my eye He read a good
deal he stood and looked upon the sea he talked occasionally with his
neighbours and once when a child fell he picked it up and soothed it I
damned him in my heart the book which I was sure he did not readthe
sea to which I was ready to take oath he was indifferentthe child
whom I was certain he would as lieve have tossed overboardall seemed
to me elements in a theatrical performance and I made no doubt he was
already nosing after the secrets of his fellowpassengers I took no
pains to conceal myself my scorn for the creature being as strong as my
disgust But he never looked my way and it was night before I learned
he had observed me

I was smoking by the engineroom door for the air was a little sharp
when a voice rose close beside me in the darkness

I beg your pardon Mr Dodd it said

That you Bellairs I replied

A single word sir Your presence on this ship has no connection with
our interview he asked You have no idea Mr Dodd of returning upon
your determination

None said I and then seeing he still lingered I was polite enough
to add Good evening at which he sighed and went away


The next day he was there again with the chair and the puma skin read
his book and looked at the sea with the same constancy and though there
was no child to be picked up I observed him to attend repeatedly on a
sick woman Nothing fosters suspicion like the act of watching a man
spied upon can hardly blow his nose but we accuse him of designs and
I took an early opportunity to go forward and see the woman for myself
She was poor elderly and painfully plain I stood abashed at the
sight felt I owed Bellairs amends for the injustice of my thoughts and
seeing him standing by the rail in his usual attitude of contemplation
walked up and addressed him by name

You seem very fond of the sea said I

I may really call it a passion Mr Dodd he replied And the tall
cataract haunted me like a passion he quoted I never weary of
the sea sir This is my first ocean voyage I find it a glorious
experience And once more my disbarred lawyer dropped into poetry
Roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll

Though I had learned the piece in my readingbook at school I came into
the world a little too late on the one handand I daresay a little
too early on the otherto think much of Byron and the sonorous verse
prodigiously well delivered struck me with surprise

You are fond of poetry too I asked

I am a great reader he replied At one time I had begun to amass
quite a small but well selected library and when that was scattered I
still managed to preserve a few volumeschiefly of pieces designed for
recitationwhich have been my travelling companions

Is that one of them I asked pointing to the volume in his hand

No sir he replied showing me a translation of the _Sorrows of
Werther_ that is a novel I picked up some time ago It has afforded me
great pleasure though immoral

O immoral cried I indignant as usual at any complication of art and
ethics


Surely you cannot deny that sirif you know the book he said The
passion is illicit although certainly drawn with a good deal of pathos
It is not a work one could possibly put into the hands of a lady which
is to be regretted on all accounts for I do not know how it may strike
you but it seems to meas a depiction if I make myself clearto rise
high above its compeerseven famous compeers Even in Scott Dickens
Thackeray or Hawthorne the sentiment of love appears to me to be
frequently done less justice to

You are expressing a very general opinion said I

Is that so indeed sir he exclaimed with unmistakable excitement
Is the book well known and who was GOEATH I am interested in that
because upon the titlepage the usual initials are omitted and it runs
simply by GOEATH Was he an author of distinction Has he written
other works

Such was our first interview the first of many and in all he showed
the same attractive qualities and defects His taste for literature
was native and unaffected his sentimentality although extreme and a
thought ridiculous was plainly genuine I wondered at my own innocent
wonder I knew that Homer nodded that Caesar had compiled a jestbook
that Turner lived by preference the life of Puggy Booth that Shelley
made paper boats and Wordsworth wore green spectacles and with all
this mass of evidence before me I had expected Bellairs to be entirely
of one piece subdued to what he worked in a spy all through As I
abominated the mans trade so I had expected to detest the man himself
and behold I liked him Poor devil he was essentially a man on wires
all sensibility and tremor brimful of a cheap poetry not without
parts quite without courage His boldness was despair the gulf behind
him thrust him on he was one of those who might commit a murder rather
than confess the theft of a postagestamp I was sure that his coming
interview with Carthew rode his imagination like a nightmare when the
thought crossed his mind I used to think I knew of it and that the
qualm appeared in his face visibly Yet he would never flinch necessity
stalking at his back famine his old pursuer talking in his ear and I
used to wonder whether I most admired or most despised this quivering
heroism for evil The image that occurred to me after his visit was
just I had been butted by a lamb and the phase of life that I was now
studying might be called the Revolt of a Sheep

It could be said of him that he had learned in sorrow what he taught in
songor wrong and his life was that of one of his victims He was born
in the back parts of the State of New York his father a farmer who
became subsequently bankrupt and went West The lawyer and moneylender
who had ruined this poor family seems to have conceived in the end a
feeling of remorse he turned the father out indeed but he offered
in compensation to charge himself with one of the sons and Harry the
fifth child and already sickly was chosen to be left behind He made
himself useful in the office picked up the scattered rudiments of an
education read right and left attended and debated at the Young Mens
Christian Association and in all his early years was the model for a
good storybook His landladys daughter was his bane He showed me
her photograph she was a big handsome dashing dressy vulgar hussy
without character without tenderness without mind and as the result
proved without virtue The sickly and timid boy was in the house he
was handy when she was otherwise unoccupied she used and played with
him Romeo and Cressida till in that dreary life of a poor boy in a
country town she grew to be the light of his days and the subject of
his dreams He worked hard like Jacob for a wife he surpassed his
patron in sharp practice he was made head clerk and the same night
encouraged by a hundred freedoms depressed by the sense of his youth
and his infirmities he offered marriage and was received with
laughter Not a year had passed before his master conscious of growing
infirmities took him for a partner he proposed again he was accepted
led two years of troubled married life and awoke one morning to find
his wife had run away with a dashing drummer and had left him heavily
in debt The debt and not the drummer was supposed to be the cause of
the hegira she had concealed her liabilities they were on the point of
bursting forth she was weary of Bellairs and she took the drummer as
she might have taken a cab The blow disabled her husband his partner
was dead he was now alone in the business for which he was no longer
fit the debts hampered him bankruptcy followed and he fled from city
to city falling daily into lower practice It is to be considered that
he had been taught and had learned as a delightful duty a kind of
business whose highest merit is to escape the commentaries of the bench
that of the usurious lawyer in a county town With this training he was
now shot a penniless stranger into the deeper gulfs of cities and the
result is scarce a thing to be surprised at


Have you heard of your wife again I asked

He displayed a pitiful agitation I am afraid you will think ill of
me he said

Have you taken her back I asked

No sir I trust I have too much selfrespect he answered and at
least I was never tempted She wont come she dislikes she seems to
have conceived a positive distaste for me and yet I was considered an
indulgent husband

You are still in relations then I asked

I place myself in your hands Mr Dodd he replied The world is very
hard I have found it bitter hard myselfbitter hard to live How
much worse for a woman and one who has placed herself by her own
misconduct I am far from denying that in so unfortunate a position

In short you support her I suggested

I cannot deny it I practically do he admitted It has been a
millstone round my neck But I think she is grateful You can see for
yourself

He handed me a letter in a sprawling ignorant hand but written with
violet ink on fine pink paper with a monogram It was very foolishly
expressed and I thought except for a few obvious cajoleries very
heartless and greedy in meaning The writer said she had been sick
which I disbelieved declared the last remittance was all gone in
doctors bills for which I took the liberty of substituting dress
drink and monograms and prayed for an increase which I could only
hope had been denied her

I think she is really grateful he asked with some eagerness as I
returned it

I daresay said I Has she any claim on you

O no sir I divorced her he replied I have a very strong sense of
selfrespect in such matters and I divorced her immediately

What sort of life is she leading now I asked

I will not deceive you Mr Dodd I do not know I make a point of
not knowing it appears more dignified I have been very harshly
criticised he added sighing

It will be seen that I had fallen into an ignominious intimacy with the
man I had gone out to thwart My pity for the creature his admiration
for myself his pleasure in my society which was clearly unassumed
were the bonds with which I was fettered perhaps I should add in
honesty my own illregulated interest in the phases of life and human
character The fact is at least that we spent hours together daily
and that I was nearly as much on the forward deck as in the saloon Yet
all the while I could never forget he was a shabby trickster embarked
that very moment in a dirty enterprise I used to tell myself at first
that our acquaintance was a stroke of art and that I was somehow
fortifying Carthew I told myself I say but I was no such fool as to
believe it even then In these circumstances I displayed the two chief
qualities of my character on the largest scalemy helplessness and my
instinctive love of procrastinationand fell upon a course of action so
ridiculous that I blush when I recall it

We reached Liverpool one forenoon the rain falling thickly and
insidiously on the filthy town I had no plans beyond a sensible
unwillingness to let my rascal escape and I ended by going to the same
inn with him dining with him walking with him in the wet streets
and hearing with him in a penny gaff that venerable piece _The
TicketofLeave Man_ It was one of his first visits to a theatre
against which places of entertainment he had a strong prejudice and his
innocent pompous talk innocent old quotations and innocent reverence
for the character of Hawkshaw delighted me beyond relief In charity to
myself I dwell upon and perhaps exaggerate my pleasures I have need of
all conceivable excuses when I confess that I went to bed without one
word upon the matter of Carthew but not without having covenanted with
my rascal for a visit to Chester the next day At Chester we did the
Cathedral walked on the walls discussed Shakespeare and the musical
glassesand made a fresh engagement for the morrow I do not know and
I am glad to have forgotten how long these travels were continued We
visited at least by singular zigzags Stratford Warwick Coventry
Gloucester Bristol Bath and Wells At each stage we spoke dutifully
of the scene and its associations I sketched the Shyster spouted
poetry and copied epitaphs Who could doubt we were the usual Americans
travelling with a design of selfimprovement Who was to guess that one
was a blackmailer trembling to approach the scene of actionthe other
a helpless amateur detective waiting on events

It is unnecessary to remark that none occurred or none the least
suitable with my design of protecting Carthew Two trifles indeed
completed though they scarcely changed my conception of the Shyster The
first was observed in Gloucester where we spent Sunday and I proposed
we should hear service in the cathedral To my surprise the creature
had an ISM of his own to which he was loyal and he left me to go alone
to the cathedralor perhaps not to go at alland stole off down a
deserted alley to some Bethel or Ebenezer of the proper shade When we
met again at lunch I rallied him and he grew restive

You need employ no circumlocutions with me Mr Dodd he said
suddenly You regard my behaviour from an unfavourable point of view
you regard me I much fear as hypocritical

I was somewhat confused by the attack You know what I think of your
trade I replied lamely and coarsely

Excuse me if I seem to press the subject he continued but if you
think my life erroneous would you have me neglect the means of grace
Because you consider me in the wrong on one point would you have me
place myself on the wrong in all Surely sir the church is for the
sinner

Did you ask a blessing on your present enterprise I sneered

He had a bad attack of St Vitus his face was changed and his eyes
flashed I will tell you what I did he cried I prayed for an
unfortunate man and a wretched woman whom he tries to support

I cannot pretend that I found any repartee

The second incident was at Bristol where I lost sight of my gentleman
some hours From this eclipse he returned to me with thick speech
wandering footsteps and a back all whitened with plaster I had half
expected yet I could have wept to see it All disabilities were piled
on that weak backdomestic misfortune nervous disease a displeasing
exterior empty pockets and the slavery of vice

I will never deny that our prolonged conjunction was the result of
double cowardice Each was afraid to leave the other each was afraid
to speak or knew not what to say Save for my illjudged allusion at
Gloucester the subject uppermost in both our minds was buried Carthew
StallbridgeleCarthew StallbridgeMinsterwhich we had long since
and severally identified to be the nearest stationeven the name of
Dorsetshire was studiously avoided And yet we were making progress all
the time tacking across broad England like an unweatherly vessel on a
wind approaching our destination not openly but by a sort of flying
sap And at length I can scarce tell how we were set down by
a dilatory buttend of local train on the untenanted platform of
StallbridgeMinster

The town was ancient and compact a domino of tiled houses and walled
gardens dwarfed by the disproportionate bigness of the church From
the midst of the thoroughfare which divided it in half fields and trees
were visible at either end and through the sallyport of every street
there flowed in from the country a silent invasion of green grass Bees
and birds appeared to make the majority of the inhabitants every garden
had its row of hives the eaves of every house were plastered with the
nests of swallows and the pinnacles of the church were flickered about
all day long by a multitude of wings The town was of Roman foundation
and as I looked out that afternoon from the low windows of the inn
I should scarce have been surprised to see a centurion coming up
the street with a fatigue draft of legionaries In short
StallbridgeMinster was one of those towns which appear to be maintained
by England for the instruction and delight of the American rambler
to which he seems guided by an instinct not less surprising than the
setters and which he visits and quits with equal enthusiasm

I was not at all in the humour of the tourist I had wasted weeks of
time and accomplished nothing we were on the eve of the engagement and
I had neither plans nor allies I had thrust myself into the trade of
private providence and amateur detective I was spending money and I
was reaping disgrace All the time I kept telling myself that I must at
least speak that this ignominious silence should have been broken
long ago and must be broken now I should have broken it when he first
proposed to come to StallbridgeMinster I should have broken it in the
train I should break it there and then on the inn doorstep as the
omnibus rolled off I turned toward him at the thought he seemed to
wince the words died on my lips and I proposed instead that we should
visit the Minster

While we were engaged upon this duty it came on to rain in a manner
worthy of the tropics The vault reverberated every gargoyle instantly
poured its full discharge we waded back to the inn ankledeep in
impromptu brooks and the rest of the afternoon sat weatherbound
hearkening to the sonorous deluge For two hours I talked of indifferent
matters laboriously feeding the conversation for two hours my mind was
quite made up to do my duty instantlyand at each particular instant I
postponed it till the next To screw up my faltering courage I
called at dinner for some sparkling wine It proved when it came to be
detestable I could not put it to my lips and Bellairs who had as much
palate as a weevil was left to finish it himself Doubtless the wine
flushed him doubtless he may have observed my embarrassment of the
afternoon doubtless he was conscious that we were approaching a crisis
and that that evening if I did not join with him I must declare myself
an open enemy At least he fled Dinner was done this was the time
when I had bound myself to break my silence no more delays were to be
allowed no more excuses received I went upstairs after some tobacco
which I felt to be a mere necessity in the circumstances and when I
returned the man was gone The waiter told me he had left the house

The rain still plumped like a vast showerbath over the deserted town
The night was dark and windless the street lit glimmeringly from end
to end lamps house windows and the reflections in the rainpools all
contributing From a publichouse on the other side of the way I heard
a harp twang and a doleful voice upraised in the Larboard Watch
The Anchors Weighed and other naval ditties Where had my Shyster
wandered In all likelihood to that lyrical tavern there was no choice
of diversion in comparison with StallbridgeMinster on a rainy night a
sheepfold would seem gay

Again I passed in review the points of my interview on which I was
always constantly resolved so long as my adversary was absent from the
scene and again they struck me as inadequate From this dispiriting
exercise I turned to the native amusements of the inn coffeeroom and
studied for some time the mezzotints that frowned upon the wall The
railway guide after showing me how soon I could leave Stallbridge
and how quickly I could reach Paris failed to hold my attention An
illustrated advertisement book of hotels brought me very low indeed
and when it came to the local paper I could have wept At this point I
found a passing solace in a copy of Whittakers Almanac and obtained in
fifty minutes more information than I have yet been able to use

Then a fresh apprehension assailed me Suppose Bellairs had given me the
slip suppose he was now rolling on the road to StallbridgeleCarthew
or perhaps there already and laying before a very whitefaced auditor
his threats and propositions A hasty person might have instantly
pursued Whatever I am I am not hasty and I was aware of three grave
objections In the first place I could not be certain that Bellairs was
gone In the second I had no taste whatever for a long drive at that
hour of the night and in so merciless a rain In the third I had no
idea how I was to get admitted if I went and no idea what I should say
if I got admitted In short I concluded the whole situation is the
merest farce You have thrust yourself in where you had no business
and have no power You would be quite as useful in San Francisco
far happier in Paris and being by the wrath of God at
StallbridgeMinster the wisest thing is to go quietly to bed On the
way to my room I saw in a flash that which I ought to have done long
ago and which it was now too late to think ofwritten to Carthew I
mean detailing the facts and describing Bellairs letting him defend
himself if he were able and giving him time to flee if he were not
It was the last blow to my selfrespect and I flung myself into my bed
with contumely

I have no guess what hour it was when I was wakened by the entrance of
Bellairs carrying a candle He had been drunk for he was bedaubed with
mire from head to foot but he was now sober and under the empire of
some violent emotion which he controlled with difficulty He trembled
visibly and more than once during the interview which followed tears
suddenly and silently overflowed his cheeks

I have to ask your pardon sir for this untimely visit he said
I make no defence I have no excuse I have disgraced myself I am
properly punished I appear before you to appeal to you in mercy for the
most trifling aid or God help me I fear I may go mad

What on earth is wrong I asked

I have been robbed he said I have no defence to offer it was of my
own fault I am properly punished

But gracious goodness me I cried who is there to rob you in a
place like this

I can form no opinion he replied I have no idea I was lying in a
ditch inanimate This is a degrading confession sir I can only say in
selfdefence that perhaps in your good nature you have made yourself
partly responsible for my shame I am not used to these rich wines

In what form was your money Perhaps it may be traced I suggested

It was in English sovereigns I changed it in New York I got very good
exchange he said and then with a momentary outbreak God in heaven
how I toiled for it he cried

That doesnt sound encouraging said I It may be worth while to
apply to the police but it doesnt sound a hopeful case

And I have no hope in that direction said Bellairs My hopes Mr
Dodd are all fixed upon yourself I could easily convince you that
a small a very small advance would be in the nature of an excellent
investment but I prefer to rely on your humanity Our acquaintance
began on an unusual footing but you have now known me for some time
we have been some timeI was going to say we had been almost intimate
Under the impulse of instinctive sympathy I have bared my heart to you
Mr Dodd as I have done to few and I believeI trustI may say that
I feel sureyou heard me with a kindly sentiment This is what brings
me to your side at this most inexcusable hour But put yourself in
my placehow could I sleephow could I dream of sleeping in this
blackness of remorse and despair There was a friend at handso I
ventured to think of you it was instinctive I fled to your side
as the drowning man clutches at a straw These expressions are not
exaggerated they scarcely serve to express the agitation of my mind
And think sir how easily you can restore me to hope and I may say
to reason A small loan which shall be faithfully repaid Five hundred
dollars would be ample He watched me with burning eyes Four hundred
would do I believe Mr Dodd that I could manage with economy on two

And then you will repay me out of Carthews pocket I said I am much
obliged But I will tell you what I will do I will see you on board a
steamer pay your fare through to San Francisco and place fifty dollars
in the pursers hands to be given you in New York

He drank in my words his face represented an ecstasy of cunning
thought I could read there plain as print that he but thought to
overreach me

And what am I to do in Frisco he asked I am disbarred I have no
trade I cannot dig to beg he paused in the citation And you
know that I am not alone he added others depend upon me

I will write to Pinkerton I returned I feel sure he can help you
to some employment and in the meantime and for three months after
your arrival he shall pay to yourself personally on the first and the
fifteenth twentyfive dollars

Mr Dodd I scarce believe you can be serious in this offer he
replied Have you forgotten the circumstances of the case Do you
know these people are the magnates of the section They were spoken of
tonight in the saloon their wealth must amount to many millions of
dollars in real estate alone their house is one of the sights of the
locality and you offer me a bribe of a few hundred

I offer you no bribe Mr Bellairs I give you alms I returned I
will do nothing to forward you in your hateful business yet I would not
willingly have you starve

Give me a hundred dollars then and be done with it he cried

I will do what I have said and neither more nor less said I

Take care he cried You are playing a fools game you are making an
enemy for nothing you will gain nothing by this I warn you of it And
then with one of his changes Seventy dollarsonly seventyin mercy
Mr Dodd in common charity Dont dash the bowl from my lips You have
a kindly heart Think of my position remember my unhappy wife

You should have thought of her before said I I have made my offer
and I wish to sleep

Is that your last word sir Pray consider pray weigh both sides
my misery your own danger I warn youI beseech you measure it well
before you answer so he half pleaded half threatened me with clasped
hands

My first word and my last said I

The change upon the man was shocking In the storm of anger that now
shook him the lees of his intoxication rose again to the surface his
face was deformed his words insane with fury his pantomime excessive
in itself was distorted by an access of St Vitus

You will perhaps allow me to inform you of my cold opinion he began
apparently selfpossessed truly bursting with rage when I am a
glorified saint I shall see you howling for a drop of water and exult
to see you That your last word Take it in your face you spy you
false friend you fat hypocrite I defy I defy and despise and spit
upon you Im on the trail his trail or yours I smell blood Ill
follow it on my hands and knees Ill starve to follow it Ill hunt you
down hunt you hunt you down If I were strong Id tear your vitals
out here in this roomtear them outId tear them out Damn damn
damn You think me weak I can bite bite to the blood bite you hurt
you disgrace you 

He was thus incoherently raging when the scene was interrupted by
the arrival of the landlord and inn servants in various degrees of
deshabille and to them I gave my temporary lunatic in charge

Take him to his room I said hes only drunk

These were my words but I knew better After all my study of Mr
Bellairs one discovery had been reserved for the last moment that of
his latent and essential madness




CHAPTER XX STALLBRIDGELECARTHEW


Long before I was awake the shyster had disappeared leaving his bill
unpaid I did not need to inquire where he was gone I knew too well
I knew there was nothing left me but to follow and about ten in the
morning set forth in a gig for StallbridgeleCarthew

The road for the first quarter of the way deserts the valley of the
river and crosses the summit of a chalkdown grazed over by flocks of
sheep and haunted by innumerable larks It was a pleasant but a vacant
scene arousing but not holding the attention and my mind returned to
the violent passage of the night before My thought of the man I was
pursuing had been greatly changed I conceived of him somewhere in
front of me upon his dangerous errand not to be turned aside not
to be stopped by either fear or reason I had called him a ferret
I conceived him now as a mad dog Methought he would run not walk
methought as he ran that he would bark and froth at the lips
methought if the great wall of China were to rise across his path he
would attack it with his nails

Presently the road left the down returned by a precipitous descent into
the valley of the Stall and ran thenceforward among enclosed fields and
under the continuous shade of trees I was told we had now entered on
the Carthew property By and by a battlemented wall appeared on the
left hand and a little after I had my first glimpse of the mansion It
stood in a hollow of a bosky park crowded to a degree that surprised
and even displeased me with huge timber and dense shrubberies of
laurel and rhododendron Even from this low station and the thronging
neighbourhood of the trees the pile rose conspicuous like a cathedral
Behind as we continued to skirt the park wall I began to make out a
straggling town of offices which became conjoined to the rear with those
of the home farm On the left was an ornamental water sailed in by many
swans On the right extended a flower garden laid in the old manner
and at this season of the year as brilliant as stained glass The front
of the house presented a facade of more than sixty windows surmounted
by a formal pediment and raised upon a terrace A wide avenue part in
gravel part in turf and bordered by triple alleys ran to the great
double gateways It was impossible to look without surprise on a place
that had been prepared through so many generations had cost so many
tons of minted gold and was maintained in order by so great a company
of emulous servants And yet of these there was no sign but the
perfection of their work The whole domain was drawn to the line and
weeded like the front plot of some suburban amateur and I looked in
vain for any belated gardener and listened in vain for any sounds of
labour Some lowing of cattle and much calling of birds alone disturbed
the stillness and even the little hamlet which clustered at the gates
appeared to hold its breath in awe of its great neighbour like a troop
of children who should have strayed into a kings anteroom

The Carthew Arms the small but very comfortable inn was a mere
appendage and outpost of the family whose name it bore Engraved
portraits of bygone Carthews adorned the walls Fielding Carthew
Recorder of the city of London MajorGeneral John Carthew in uniform
commanding some military operations the Right Honourable Bailley
Carthew Member of Parliament for Stallbridge standing by a table and
brandishing a document Singleton Carthew Esquire represented in the
foreground of a herd of cattledoubtless at the desire of his tenantry
who had made him a compliment of this work of art and the Venerable
Archdeacon Carthew DD LLD AM laying his hand on the head of
a little child in a manner highly frigid and ridiculous So far as
my memory serves me there were no other pictures in this exclusive
hostelry and I was not surprised to learn that the landlord was an
exbutler the landlady an exladysmaid from the great house and
that the barparlour was a sort of perquisite of former servants

To an American the sense of the domination of this family over so
considerable a tract of earth was even oppressive and as I considered
their simple annals gathered from the legends of the engravings
surprise began to mingle with my disgust Mr Recorder doubtless
occupies an honourable post but I thought that in the course of so
many generations one Carthew might have clambered higher The soldier
had stuck at MajorGeneral the churchman bloomed unremarked in an
archidiaconate and though the Right Honourable Bailley seemed to have
sneaked into the privy council I have still to learn what he did when
he had got there Such vast means so long a start and such a modest
standard of achievement struck in me a strong sense of the dulness of
that race

I found that to come to the hamlet and not visit the Hall would be
regarded as a slight To feed the swans to see the peacocks and
the Raphaelsfor these commonplace people actually possessed two
Raphaelsto risk life and limb among a famous breed of cattle called
the Carthew Chillinghams and to do homage to the sire still living of
Donibristle a renowned winner of the oaks these it seemed were
the inevitable stations of the pilgrimage I was not so foolish as to
resist for I might have need before I was done of general goodwill
and two pieces of news fell in which changed my resignation to
alacrity It appeared in the first place that Mr Norris was from home
travelling  in the second that a visitor had been before me and
already made the tour of the Carthew curiosities I thought I knew who
this must be I was anxious to learn what he had done and seen and
fortune so far favoured me that the undergardener singled out to be my
guide had already performed the same function for my predecessor

Yes sir he said an American gentleman right enough At least I
dont think he was quite a gentleman but a very civil person

The person it seems had been civil enough to be delighted with the
Carthew Chillinghams to perform the whole pilgrimage with rising
admiration and to have almost prostrated himself before the shrine of
Donibristles sire

He told me sir continued the gratified undergardener that he had
often read of the stately omes of England but ours was the first he
had the chance to see When he came to the ead of the long alley he
fetched his breath This is indeed a lordly domain he cries And
it was natural he should be interested in the place for it seems
Mr Carthew had been kind to him in the States In fact he seemed a
grateful kind of person and wonderful taken up with flowers

I heard this story with amazement The phrases quoted told their own
tale they were plainly from the shysters mint A few hours back I
had seen him a mere bedlamite and fit for a straitwaistcoat he was
penniless in a strange country it was highly probable he had gone
without breakfast the absence of Norris must have been a crushing blow
the man by all reason should have been despairing And now I heard of
him clothed and in his right mind deliberate insinuating admiring
vistas smelling flowers and talking like a book The strength of
character implied amazed and daunted me

This is curious I said to the undergardener I have had the
pleasure of some acquaintance with Mr Carthew myself and I believe
none of our western friends ever were in England Who can this person
be He couldntno thats impossible he could never have had the
impudence His name was not Bellairs

I didnt ear the name sir Do you know anything against him cried
my guide

Well said I he is certainly not the person Carthew would like to
have here in his absence

Good gracious me exclaimed the gardener He was so pleasant spoken
too I thought he was some form of a schoolmaster Perhaps sir you
wouldnt mind going right up to Mr Denman I recommended him to Mr
Denman when he had done the grounds Mr Denman is our butler sir he
added

The proposal was welcome particularly as affording me a graceful
retreat from the neighbourhood of the Carthew Chillinghams and giving
up our projected circuit we took a short cut through the shrubbery and
across the bowling green to the back quarters of the Hall

The bowling green was surrounded by a great hedge of yew and entered
by an archway in the quick As we were issuing from this passage my
conductor arrested me

The Honourable Lady Ann Carthew he said in an august whisper And
looking over his shoulder I was aware of an old lady with a stick
hobbling somewhat briskly along the garden path She must have been
extremely handsome in her youth and even the limp with which she walked
could not deprive her of an unusual and almost menacing dignity of
bearing Melancholy was impressed besides on every feature and
her eyes as she looked straight before her seemed to contemplate
misfortune

She seems sad said I when she had hobbled past and we had resumed
our walk

She enjoy rather poor spirits sir responded the undergardener
Mr Carthewthe old gentleman I meandied less than a year ago Lord
Tillibody her ladyships brother two months after and then there was
the sad business about the young gentleman Killed in the untingfield
sir and her ladyships favourite The present Mr Norris has never been
so equally

So I have understood said I persistently and I think gracefully
pursuing my inquiries and fortifying my position as a family friend
Dear dear how sad And has this changepoor Carthews return and
allhas this not mended matters

Well no sir not a sign of it was the reply Worse we think than
ever

Dear dear said I again

When Mr Norris arrived she DID seem glad to see him he pursued
and we were all pleased Im sure for no one knows the young gentleman
but what likes him Ah sir it didnt last long That very night
they had a talk and fell out or something her ladyship took on most
painful it was like old days but worse And the next morning Mr
Norris was off again upon his travels Denman he said to Mr Denman
Denman Ill never come back he said and shook him by the and I
wouldnt be saying all this to a stranger sir added my informant
overcome with a sudden fear lest he had gone too far

He had indeed told me much and much that was unsuspected by himself
On that stormy night of his return Carthew had told his story the old
lady had more upon her mind than mere bereavements and among the mental
pictures on which she looked as she walked staring down the path was
one of Midway Island and the Flying Scud

Mr Denman heard my inquiries with discomposure but informed me the
shyster was already gone

Gone cried I Then what can he have come for One thing I can tell
you it was not to see the house

I dont see it could have been anything else replied the butler

You may depend upon it it was said I And whatever it was he has
got it By the way where is Mr Carthew at present I was sorry to find
he was from home

He is engaged in travelling sir replied the butler dryly

Ah bravo cried I I laid a trap for you there Mr Denman Now I
need not ask you I am sure you did not tell this prying stranger

To be sure not sir said the butler

I went through the form of shaking him by the andlike Mr
Norrisnot however with genuine enthusiasm For I had failed
ingloriously to get the address for myself and I felt a sure conviction
that Bellairs had done better or he had still been here and still
cultivating Mr Denman

I had escaped the grounds and the cattle I could not escape the
house A lady with silver hair a slender silver voice and a stream of
insignificant information not to be diverted led me through the picture
gallery the musicroom the great diningroom the long drawingroom
the Indian room the theatre and every corner as I thought of that
interminable mansion There was but one place reserved the gardenroom
whither Lady Ann had now retired I paused a moment on the outside of
the door and smiled to myself The situation was indeed strange and
these thin boards divided the secret of the Flying Scud

All the while as I went to and fro I was considering the visit and
departure of Bellairs That he had got the address I was quite certain
that he had not got it by direct questioning I was convinced some
ingenuity some lucky accident had served him A similar chance an
equal ingenuity was required or I was left helpless the ferret must
run down his prey the great oaks fall the Raphaels be scattered the
house let to some stockbroker suddenly made rich and the name which now
filled the mouths of five or six parishes dwindle to a memory Strange
that such great matters so old a mansion a family so ancient and so
dull should come to depend for perpetuity upon the intelligence the
discretion and the cunning of a LatinQuarter student What Bellairs
had done I must do likewise Chance or ingenuity ingenuity or
chanceso I continued to ring the changes as I walked down the
avenue casting back occasional glances at the red brick facade and the
twinkling windows of the house How was I to command chance where was I
to find the ingenuity

These reflections brought me to the door of the inn And here pursuant
to my policy of keeping well with all men I immediately smoothed my
brow and accepted being the only guest in the house an invitation to
dine with the family in the barparlour I sat down accordingly with Mr
Higgs the exbutler Mrs Higgs the exladysmaid and Miss Agnes Higgs
their frowsyheaded little girl the least promising and as the event
showed the most useful of the lot The talk ran endlessly on the great
house and the great family the roast beef the Yorkshire pudding the
jamroll and the cheddar cheese came and went and still the stream
flowed on near four generations of Carthews were touched upon without
eliciting one point of interest and we had killed Mr Henry in the
untingfield with a vast elaboration of painful circumstance and
buried him in the midst of a whole sorrowing county before I could so
much as manage to bring upon the stage my intimate friend Mr Norris
At the name the exbutler grew diplomatic and the exladysmaid
tender He was the only person of the whole featureless series
who seemed to have accomplished anything worth mention and his
achievements poor dog seemed to have been confined to going to the
devil and leaving some regrets He had been the image of the Right
Honourable Bailley one of the lights of that dim house and a career
of distinction had been predicted of him in consequence almost from the
cradle But before he was out of long clothes the cloven foot began to
show he proved to be no Carthew developed a taste for low pleasures
and bad company went birdnesting with a stableboy before he was
eleven and when he was near twenty and might have been expected to
display at least some rudiments of the family gravity rambled the
country over with a knapsack making sketches and keeping company in
wayside inns He had no pride about him I was told he would sit down
with any man and it was somewhat woundingly implied that I was indebted
to this peculiarity for my own acquaintance with the hero Unhappily
Mr Norris was not only eccentric he was fast His debts were still
remembered at the University still more it appeared the highly
humorous circumstances attending his expulsion He was always fond of
his jest commented Mrs Higgs

That he were observed her lord

But it was after he went into the diplomatic service that the real
trouble began

It seems sir that he went the pace extraordinary said the
exbutler with a solemn gusto

His debts were somethink awful said the ladysmaid And as nice a
young gentleman all the time as you would wish to see

When word came to Mr Carthews ears the turn up was orrible
continued Mr Higgs I remember it as if it was yesterday The bell was
rung after her laship was gone which I answered it myself supposing
it were the coffee There was Mr Carthew on his feet Iggs he
says pointing with his stick for he had a turn of the gout order the
dogcart instantly for this son of mine which has disgraced hisself
Mr Norris say nothink he sit there with his ead down making belief
to be looking at a walnut You might have bowled me over with a straw
said Mr Higgs

Had he done anything very bad I asked

Not he Mr Dodsley cried the ladyit was so she had conceived my
name He never did anythink to all really wrong in his poor life The
ole affair was a disgrace It was all rank favouritising

Mrs Iggs Mrs Iggs cried the butler warningly

Well what do I care retorted the lady shaking her ringlets You
know it was yourself Mr Iggs and so did every member of the staff

While I was getting these facts and opinions I by no means neglected
the child She was not attractive but fortunately she had reached the
corrupt age of seven when half a crown appears about as large as a
saucer and is fully as rare as the dodo For a shilling down sixpence
in her moneybox and an American gold dollar which I happened to find
in my pocket I bought the creature soul and body She declared her
intention to accompany me to the ends of the earth and had to be
chidden by her sire for drawing comparisons between myself and her uncle
William highly damaging to the latter

Dinner was scarce done the cloth was not yet removed when Miss Agnes
must needs climb into my lap with her stamp album a relic of the
generosity of Uncle William There are few things I despise more than
old stamps unless perhaps it be crests for cattle from the Carthew
Chillinghams down to the old gatekeepers milkcow in the lane
contempt is far from being my first sentiment But it seemed I was
doomed to pass that day in viewing curiosities and smothering a yawn
I devoted myself once more to tread the wellknown round I fancy Uncle
William must have begun the collection himself and tired of it for
the book to my surprise was quite respectably filled There were the
varying shades of the English penny Russians with the coloured heart
old undecipherable ThurnundTaxis obsolete triangular Cape of Good
Hopes Swan Rivers with the Swan and Guianas with the sailing ship
Upon all these I looked with the eyes of a fish and the spirit of a
sheep I think indeed I was at times asleep and it was probably in one
of these moments that I capsized the album and there fell from the end
of it upon the floor a considerable number of what I believe to be
called exchanges

Here against all probability my chance had come to me for as I
gallantly picked them up I was struck with the disproportionate amount
of fivesous French stamps Some one I reasoned must write very
regularly from France to the neighbourhood of StallbridgeleCarthew
Could it be Norris On one stamp I made out an initial C upon a second
I got as far as CH beyond which point the postmark used was in every
instance undecipherable CH when you consider that about a quarter of
the towns in France begin with chateau was an insufficient clue and
I promptly annexed the plainest of the collection in order to consult
the postoffice

The wretched infant took me in the fact Naughty man to teal my
tamp she cried and when I would have brazened it off with a denial
recovered and displayed the stolen article

My position was now highly false and I believe it was in mere pity
that Mrs Higgs came to my rescue with a welcome proposition If the
gentleman was really interested in stamps she said probably supposing
me a monomaniac on the point he should see Mr Denmans album Mr
Denman had been collecting forty years and his collection was said
to be worth a mint of money Agnes she went on if you were a kind
little girl you would run over to the All tell Mr Denman theres
a connaisseer in the ouse and ask him if one of the young gentlemen
might bring the album down

I should like to see his exchanges too I cried rising to the
occasion I may have some of mine in my pocketbook and we might
trade

Half an hour later Mr Denman arrived himself with a most unconscionable
volume under his arm Ah sir he cried when I eard you was a
collector I dropped all Its a saying of mine Mr Dodsley that
collecting stamps makes all collectors kin Its a bond sir it creates
a bond

Upon the truth of this I cannot say but there is no doubt that
the attempt to pass yourself off for a collector falsely creates a
precarious situation

Ah heres the second issue I would say after consulting the legend
at the side The pinkno I mean the mauveyes thats the beauty of
this lot Though of course as you say I would hasten to add this
yellow on the thin paper is more rare

Indeed I must certainly have been detected had I not plied Mr Denman
in selfdefence with his favourite liquora port so excellent that it
could never have ripened in the cellar of the Carthew Arms but must
have been transported under cloud of night from the neighbouring
vaults of the great house At each threat of exposure and in particular
whenever I was directly challenged for an opinion I made haste to fill
the butlers glass and by the time we had got to the exchanges he was
in a condition in which no stamp collector need be seriously feared
God forbid I should hint that he was drunk he seemed incapable of the
necessary liveliness but the mans eyes were set and so long as he was
suffered to talk without interruption he seemed careless of my heeding
him

In Mr Denmans exchanges as in those of little Agnes the same
peculiarity was to be remarked an undue preponderance of that
despicably common stamp the French twentyfive centimes And here
joining them in stealthy review I found the C and the CH then
something of an A just following and then a terminal Y Here was also
the whole name spelt out to me it seemed familiar too and yet for
some time I could not bridge the imperfection Then I came upon another
stamp in which an L was legible before the Y and in a moment the word
leaped up complete Chailly that was the name ChaillyenBiere the
post town of Barbizonah there was the very place for any man to hide
himselfthere was the very place for Mr Norris who had rambled over
England making sketchesthe very place for Goddedaal who had left a
paletteknife on board the Flying Scud Singular indeed that while I
was drifting over England with the shyster the man we were in quest of
awaited me at my own ultimate destination

Whether Mr Denman had shown his album to Bellairs whether indeed
Bellairs could have caught as I did this hint from an obliterated
postmark I shall never know and it mattered not We were equal now
my task at StallbridgeleCarthew was accomplished my interest in
postagestamps died shamelessly away the astonished Denman was bowed
out and ordering the horse to be put in I plunged into the study of
the timetable




CHAPTER XXI FACE TO FACE


I fell from the skies on Barbizon about two oclock of a September
afternoon It is the dead hour of the day all the workers have gone
painting all the idlers strolling in the forest or the plain the
winding causewayed street is solitary and the inn deserted I was the
more pleased to find one of my old companions in the diningroom his
town clothes marked him for a man in the act of departure and indeed
his portmanteau lay beside him on the floor

Why Stennis I cried youre the last man I expected to find here

You wont find me here long he replied King Pandion he is dead all
his friends are lapped in lead For men of our antiquity the poor old
shop is played out

I have had playmates I have had companions I quoted in return
We were both moved I think to meet again in this scene of our old
pleasure parties so unexpectedly after so long an interval and both
already so much altered

That is the sentiment he replied All all are gone the old
familiar faces I have been here a week and the only living creature
who seemed to recollect me was the Pharaon Bar the Sirons of course
and the perennial Bodmer

Is there no survivor I inquired

Of our geological epoch not one he replied This is the city of
Petra in Edom

And what sort of Bedouins encamp among the ruins I asked

Youth Dodd youth blooming conscious youth he returned Such a
gang such reptiles to think we were like that I wonder Siron didnt
sweep us from his premises

Perhaps we werent so bad I suggested

Dont let me depress you said he We were both AngloSaxons anyway
and the only redeeming feature today is another

The thought of my quest a moment driven out by this rencounter revived
in my mind Who is he I cried Tell me about him

What the Redeeming Feature said he Well hes a very pleasing
creature rather dim and dull and genteel but really pleasing He is
very British though the artless Briton Perhaps youll find him too
much so for the transatlantic nerves Come to think of it on the other
hand you ought to get on famously He is an admirer of your great
republic in one of its excuse me shoddiest features he takes in and
sedulously reads a lot of American papers I warned you he was artless

What papers are they cried I

San Francisco papers said he He gets a bale of them about twice
a week and studies them like the Bible Thats one of his weaknesses
another is to be incalculably rich He has taken Massons old
studioyou rememberat the corner of the road he has furnished it
regardless of expense and lives there surrounded with vins fins and
works of art When the youth of today goes up to the Caverne des
Brigands to make punchthey do all that we did like some nauseous form
of ape I never appreciated before what a creature of tradition mankind
isthis Madden follows with a basket of champagne I told him he was
wrong and the punch tasted better but he thought the boys liked the
style of the thing and I suppose they do He is a very goodnatured
soul and a very melancholy and rather a helpless O and he has a
third weakness which I came near forgetting He paints He has never
been taught and hes past thirty and he paints

How I asked

Rather well I think was the reply Thats the annoying part of it
See for yourself That panel is his

I stepped toward the window It was the old familiar room with the
tables set like a Greek P and the sideboard and the aphasiac piano
and the panels on the wall There were Romeo and Juliet Antwerp from
the river Enfields ships among the ice and the huge huntsman winding
a huge horn mingled with them a few new ones the thin crop of a
succeeding generation not better and not worse It was to one of these
I was directed a thing coarsely and wittily handled mostly with the
paletteknife the colour in some parts excellent the canvas in others
loaded with mere clay But it was the scene and not the art or want
of it that riveted my notice The foreground was of sand and scrub and
wreckwood in the middle distance the manyhued and smooth expanse of a
lagoon enclosed by a wall of breakers beyond a blue strip of ocean
The sky was cloudless and I could hear the surf break For the place
was Midway Island the point of view the very spot at which I had landed
with the captain for the first time and from which I had reembarked
the day before we sailed I had already been gazing for some seconds
before my attention was arrested by a blur on the sealine and stooping
to look I recognised the smoke of a steamer

Yes said I turning toward Stennis it has merit What is it

A fancy piece he returned Thats what pleased me So few of the
fellows in our time had the imagination of a garden snail

Madden you say his name is I pursued

Madden he repeated

Has he travelled much I inquired

I havent an idea He is one of the least autobiographical of men He
sits and smokes and giggles and sometimes he makes small jests
but his contributions to the art of pleasing are generally confined to
looking like a gentleman and being one No added Stennis hell never
suit you Dodd you like more head on your liquor Youll find him as
dull as ditch water

Has he big blonde sidewhiskers like tusks I asked mindful of the
photograph of Goddedaal

Certainly not why should he was the reply

Does he write many letters I continued

God knows said Stennis What is wrong with you I never saw you
taken this way before


The fact is I think I know the man said I I think Im looking for
him I rather think he is my longlost brother

Not twins anyway returned Stennis

And about the same time a carriage driving up to the inn he took his
departure

I walked till dinnertime in the plain keeping to the fields for I
instinctively shunned observation and was racked by many incongruous
and impatient feelings Here was a man whose voice I had once heard
whose doings had filled so many days of my life with interest and
distress whom I had lain awake to dream of like a lover and now his
hand was on the door now we were to meet now I was to learn at last
the mystery of the substituted crew The sun went down over the plain of
the Angelus and as the hour approached my courage lessened I let the
laggard peasants pass me on the homeward way The lamps were lit the
soup was served the company were all at table and the room sounded
already with multitudinous talk before I entered I took my place and
found I was opposite to Madden Over six feet high and well set up the
hair dark and streaked with silver the eyes dark and kindly the mouth
very goodnatured the teeth admirable linen and hands exquisite
English clothes an English voice an English bearing the man stood
out conspicuous from the company Yet he had made himself at home and
seemed to enjoy a certain quiet popularity among the noisy boys of the
table dhote He had an odd silver giggle of a laugh that sounded
nervous even when he was really amused and accorded ill with his big
stature and manly melancholy face This laugh fell in continually all
through dinner like the note of the triangle in a piece of modern French
music and he had at times a kind of pleasantry rather of manner than
of words with which he started or maintained the merriment He took his
share in these diversions not so much like a man in high spirits
but like one of an approved good nature habitually selfforgetful
accustomed to please and to follow others I have remarked in old
soldiers much the same smiling sadness and sociable selfeffacement

I feared to look at him lest my glances should betray my deep
excitement and chance served me so well that the soup was scarce
removed before we were naturally introduced My first sip of Chateau
Siron a vintage from which I had been long estranged startled me into
speech


O thisll never do I cried in English

Dreadful stuff isnt it said Madden in the same language Do let
me ask you to share my bottle They call it Chambertin which it isnt
but its fairly palatable and theres nothing in this house that a man
can drink at all

I accepted anything would do that paved the way to better knowledge

Your name is Madden I think said I My old friend Stennis told me
about you when I came

Yes I am sorry he went I feel such a Grandfather William alone among
all these lads he replied

My name is Dodd I resumed

Yes said he so Madame Siron told me

Dodd of San Francisco I continued Late of Pinkerton and Dodd

Montana Block I think said he

The same said I

Neither of us looked at each other but I could see his hand
deliberately making bread pills

Thats a nice thing of yours I pursued that panel The foreground
is a little clayey perhaps but the lagoon is excellent

You ought to know said he

Yes returned I Im rather a good judge ofthat panel

There was a considerable pause

You know a man by the name of Bellairs dont you he resumed

Ah cried I you have heard from Doctor Urquart

This very morning he replied

Well there is no hurry about Bellairs said I Its rather a long
story and rather a silly one But I think we have a good deal to tell
each other and perhaps we had better wait till we are more alone

I think so said he Not that any of these fellows know English but
well be more comfortable over at my place Your health Dodd

And we took wine together across the table

Thus had this singular introduction passed unperceived in the midst of
more than thirty persons art students ladies in dressinggowns and
covered with rice powder six foot of Siron whisking dishes over our
head and his noisy sons clattering in and out with fresh relays

One question more said I Did you recognise my voice

Your voice he repeated How should I I had never heard itwe have
never met

And yet we have been in conversation before now said I and I asked
you a question which you never answered and which I have since had many
thousand better reasons for putting to myself

He turned suddenly white Good God he cried are you the man in the
telephone

I nodded

Well well said he It would take a good deal of magnanimity to
forgive you that What nights I have passed That little whisper has
whistled in my ear ever since like the wind in a keyhole Who could it
be What could it mean I suppose I have had more real solid misery
out of that  He paused and looked troubled Though I had more to
bother me or ought to have he added and slowly emptied his glass

It seems we were born to drive each other crazy with conundrums said
I I have often thought my head would split

Carthew burst into his foolish laugh And yet neither you nor I had the
worst of the puzzle he cried There were others deeper in

And who were they I asked

The underwriters said he

Why to be sure cried I I never thought of that What could they
make of it

Nothing replied Carthew It couldnt be explained They were a crowd
of small dealers at Lloyds who took it up in syndicate one of them has
a carriage now and people say he is a deuce of a deep fellow and has
the makings of a great financier Another furnished a small villa on
the profits But theyre all hopelessly muddled and when they meet each
other they dont know where to look like the Augurs

Dinner was no sooner at an end than he carried me across the road
to Massons old studio It was strangely changed On the walls were
tapestry a few good etchings and some amazing picturesa Rousseau a
Corot a really superb old Crome a Whistler and a piece which my host
claimed and I believe to be a Titian The room was furnished with
comfortable English smokingroom chairs some American rockers and
an elaborate business table spirits and sodawater with the mark of
Schweppe no less stood ready on a butlers tray and in one corner
behind a halfdrawn curtain I spied a campbed and a capacious tub
Such a room in Barbizon astonished the beholder like the glories of the
cave of Monte Cristo

Now said he we are quiet Sit down if you dont mind and tell me
your story all through

I did as he asked beginning with the day when Jim showed me the passage
in the _Daily Occidental_ and winding up with the stamp album and the
Chailly postmark It was a long business and Carthew made it longer
for he was insatiable of details and it had struck midnight on the old
eightday clock in the corner before I had made an end

And now said he turn about I must tell you my side much as I hate
it Mine is a beastly story Youll wonder how I can sleep Ive told it
once before Mr Dodd

To Lady Ann I asked

As you suppose he answered and to say the truth I had sworn never
to tell it again Only you seem somehow entitled to the thing you have
paid dear enough God knows and God knows I hope you may like it now
youve got it

With that he began his yarn A new day had dawned the cocks crew in the
village and the early woodmen were afoot when he concluded




CHAPTER XXII THE REMITTANCE MAN


Singleton Carthew the father of Norris was heavily built and feebly
vitalised sensitive as a musician dull as a sheep and conscientious
as a dog He took his position with seriousness even with pomp the
long rooms the silent servants seemed in his eyes like the observances
of some religion of which he was the mortal god He had the stupid mans
intolerance of stupidity in others the vain mans exquisite alarm lest
it should be detected in himself And on both sides Norris irritated and
offended him He thought his son a fool and he suspected that his son
returned the compliment with interest The history of their relation was
simple they met seldom they quarrelled often To his mother a fiery
pungent practical woman already disappointed in her husband and her
elder son Norris was only a fresh disappointment

Yet the lads faults were no great matter he was diffident placable
passive unambitious unenterprising life did not much attract him he
watched it like a curious and dull exhibition not much amused and not
tempted in the least to take a part He beheld his father ponderously
grinding sand his mother fierily breaking butterflies his brother
labouring at the pleasures of the Hawbuck with the ardour of a soldier
in a doubtful battle and the vital sceptic looked on wondering They
were careful and troubled about many things for him there seemed not
even one thing needful He was born disenchanted the worlds promises
awoke no echo in his bosom the worlds activities and the worlds
distinctions seemed to him equally without a base in fact He liked the
open air he liked comradeship it mattered not with whom his comrades
were only a remedy for solitude And he had a taste for painted art An
array of fine pictures looked upon his childhood and from these roods
of jewelled canvas he received an indelible impression The gallery at
Stallbridge betokened generations of picture lovers Norris was perhaps
the first of his race to hold the pencil The taste was genuine it
grew and strengthened with his growth and yet he suffered it to be
suppressed with scarce a struggle Time came for him to go to Oxford
and he resisted faintly He was stupid he said it was no good to put
him through the mill he wished to be a painter The words fell on his
father like a thunderbolt and Norris made haste to give way It didnt
really matter dont you know said he And it seemed an awful shame
to vex the old boy

To Oxford he went obediently hopelessly and at Oxford became the
hero of a certain circle He was active and adroit when he was in
the humour he excelled in many sports and his singular melancholy
detachment gave him a place apart He set a fashion in his clique
Envious undergraduates sought to parody his unaffected lack of zeal
and fear it was a kind of new Byronism more composed and dignified
Nothing really mattered among other things this formula embraced the
dons and though he always meant to be civil the effect on the college
authorities was one of startling rudeness His indifference cut like
insolence and in some outbreak of his constitutional levity the
complement of his melancholy he was sent down in the middle of the
second year

The event was new in the annals of the Carthews and Singleton was
prepared to make the most of it It had been long his practice to
prophesy for his second son a career of ruin and disgrace There is
an advantage in this artless parental habit Doubtless the father
is interested in his son but doubtless also the prophet grows to be
interested in his prophecies If the one goes wrong the others come
true Old Carthew drew from this source esoteric consolations he dwelt
at length on his own foresight he produced variations hitherto unheard
from the old theme I told you so coupled his sons name with the
gallows and the hulks and spoke of his small handful of college debts
as though he must raise money on a mortgage to discharge them

I dont think that is fair sir said Norris I lived at college
exactly as you told me I am sorry I was sent down and you have a
perfect right to blame me for that but you have no right to pitch into
me about these debts

The effect upon a stupid man not unjustly incensed need scarcely be
described For a while Singleton raved

Ill tell you what father said Norris at last I dont think this
is going to do I think you had better let me take to painting Its
the only thing I take a spark of interest in I shall never be steady as
long as Im at anything else

When you stand here sir to the neck in disgrace said the father I
should have hoped you would have had more good taste than to repeat this
levity

The hint was taken the levity was never more obtruded on the fathers
notice and Norris was inexorably launched upon a backward voyage He
went abroad to study foreign languages which he learned at a very
expensive rate and a fresh crop of debts fell soon to be paid with
similar lamentations which were in this case perfectly justified and
to which Norris paid no regard He had been unfairly treated over the
Oxford affair and with a spice of malice very surprising in one so
placable and an obstinacy remarkable in one so weak refused from that
day forward to exercise the least captaincy on his expenses He wasted
what he would he allowed his servants to despoil him at their pleasure
he sowed insolvency and when the crop was ripe notified his father
with exasperating calm His own capital was put in his hands he was
planted in the diplomatic service and told he must depend upon himself

He did so till he was twentyfive by which time he had spent his money
laid in a handsome choice of debts and acquired like so many other
melancholic and uninterested persons a habit of gambling An Austrian
colonelthe same who afterwards hanged himself at Monte Carlogave
him a lesson which lasted twoandtwenty hours and left him wrecked and
helpless Old Singleton once more repurchased the honour of his name
this time at a fancy figure and Norris was set afloat again on stern
conditions An allowance of three hundred pounds in the year was to be
paid to him quarterly by a lawyer in Sydney New South Wales He was not
to write Should he fail on any quarterday to be in Sydney he was to
be held for dead and the allowance tacitly withdrawn Should he return
to Europe an advertisement publicly disowning him was to appear in
every paper of repute

It was one of his most annoying features as a son that he was always
polite always just and in whatever whirlwind of domestic anger always
calm He expected trouble when trouble came he was unmoved he might
have said with Singleton I told you so he was content with thinking
just as I expected On the fall of these last thunderbolts he bore
himself like a person only distantly interested in the event pocketed
the money and the reproaches obeyed orders punctually took ship and
came to Sydney Some men are still lads at twentyfive and so it was
with Norris Eighteen days after he landed his quarters allowance was
all gone and with the lighthearted hopefulness of strangers in what
is called a new country he began to besiege offices and apply for all
manner of incongruous situations Everywhere and last of all from his
lodgings he was bowed out and found himself reduced in a very elegant
suit of summer tweeds to herd and camp with the degraded outcasts of
the city

In this strait he had recourse to the lawyer who paid him his
allowance

Try to remember that my time is valuable Mr Carthew said the
lawyer It is quite unnecessary you should enlarge on the peculiar
position in which you stand Remittance men as we call them here are
not so rare in my experience and in such cases I act upon a system I
make you a present of a sovereign here it is Every day you choose to
call my clerk will advance you a shilling on Saturday since my office
is closed on Sunday he will advance you half a crown My conditions are
these that you do not come to me but to my clerk that you do not come
here the worse of liquor and you go away the moment you are paid and
have signed a receipt I wish you a goodmorning

I have to thank you I suppose said Carthew My position is so
wretched that I cannot even refuse this starvation allowance

Starvation said the lawyer smiling No man will starve here on a
shilling a day I had on my hands another young gentleman who remained
continuously intoxicated for six years on the same allowance And he
once more busied himself with his papers

In the time that followed the image of the smiling lawyer haunted
Carthews memory That three minutes talk was all the education I
ever had worth talking of says he It was all life in a nutshell
Confound it I thought have I got to the point of envying that ancient
fossil

Every morning for the next two or three weeks the stroke of ten found
Norris unkempt and haggard at the lawyers door The long day and
longer night he spent in the Domain now on a bench now on the grass
under a Norfolk Island pine the companion of perhaps the lowest class
on earth the Larrikins of Sydney Morning after morning the dawn
behind the lighthouse recalled him from slumber and he would stand and
gaze upon the changing east the fading lenses the smokeless city and
the manyarmed and manymasted harbour growing slowly clear under his
eyes His bedfellows so to call them were less active they lay
sprawled upon the grass and benches the dingy men the frowsy women
prolonging their late repose and Carthew wandered among the sleeping
bodies alone and cursed the incurable stupidity of his behaviour Day
brought a new society of nurserymaids and children and freshdressed
and I am sorry to say tightlaced maidens and gay people in rich
traps upon the skirts of which Carthew and the other blackguardshis
own bitter phraseskulked and chewed grass and looked on Day passed
the light died the green and leafy precinct sparkled with lamps or lay
in shadow and the round of the night began again the loitering women
the lurking men the sudden outburst of screams the sound of flying
feet You maynt believe it says Carthew but I got to that pitch
that I didnt care a hang I have been wakened out of my sleep to hear a
woman screaming and I have only turned upon my other side Yes its a
queer place where the dowagers and the kids walk all day and at night
you can hear people bawling for help as if it was the Forest of Bondy
with the lights of a great town all round and parties spinning through
in cabs from Government House and dinner with my lord

It was Norriss diversion having none other to scrape acquaintance
where how and with whom he could Many a long dull talk he held upon
the benches or the grass many a strange waif he came to know many
strange things he heard and saw some that were abominable It was to
one of these last that he owed his deliverance from the Domain For some
time the rain had been merciless one night after another he had been
obliged to squander fourpence on a bed and reduce his board to the
remaining eightpence and he sat one morning near the Macquarrie Street
entrance hungry for he had gone without breakfast and wet as he had
already been for several days when the cries of an animal in distress
attracted his attention Some fifty yards away in the extreme angle of
the grass a party of the chronically unemployed had got hold of a dog
whom they were torturing in a manner not to be described The heart
of Norris which had grown indifferent to the cries of human anger or
distress woke at the appeal of the dumb creature He ran amongst the
Larrikins scattered them rescued the dog and stood at bay They were
six in number shambling gallowsbirds but for once the proverb was
right cruelty was coupled with cowardice and the wretches cursed
him and made off It chanced that this act of prowess had not passed
unwitnessed On a bench near by there was seated a shopkeepers
assistant out of employ a diminutive cheerful redheaded creature by
the name of Hemstead He was the last man to have interfered himself
for his discretion more than equalled his valour but he made haste
to congratulate Carthew and to warn him he might not always be so
fortunate

Theyre a dyngerous lot of people about this park My word it doesnt
do to ply with them he observed in that RYCY AUSTRYLIAN English
which as it has received the imprimatur of Mr Froude we should all
make haste to imitate

Why Im one of that lot myself returned Carthew

Hemstead laughed and remarked that he knew a gentleman when he saw one

For all that I am simply one of the unemployed said Carthew
seating himself beside his new acquaintance as he had sat since this
experience began beside so many dozen others

Im out of a plyce myself said Hemstead

You beat me all the way and back says Carthew My trouble is that I
have never been in one

I suppose youve no tryde asked Hemstead

I know how to spend money replied Carthew and I really do know
something of horses and something of the sea But the unions head me
off if it werent for them I might have had a dozen berths

My word cried the sympathetic listener Ever try the mounted
police he inquired

I did and was bowled out was the reply couldnt pass the doctors

Well what do you think of the ryleways then asked Hemstead

What do YOU think of them if you come to that asked Carthew

O _I_ dont think of them I dont go in for manual labour said the
little man proudly But if a man dont mind that hes pretty sure of a
job there

By George you tell me where to go cried Carthew rising

The heavy rains continued the country was already overrun with floods
the railway system daily required more hands daily the superintendent
advertised but the unemployed preferred the resources of charity
and rapine and a navvy even an amateur navvy commanded money in the
market The same night after a tedious journey and a change of trains
to pass a landslip Norris found himself in a muddy cutting behind South
Clifton attacking his first shift of manual labour

For weeks the rain scarce relented The whole front of the mountain
slipped seaward from above avalanches of clay rock and uprooted
forest spewed over the cliffs and fell upon the beach or in the
breakers Houses were carried bodily away and smashed like nuts others
were menaced and deserted the door locked the chimney cold the
dwellers fled elsewhere for safety Night and day the fire blazed in
the encampment night and day hot coffee was served to the overdriven
toilers in the shift night and day the engineer of the section made his
rounds with words of encouragement hearty and rough and well suited to
his men Night and day too the telegraph clicked with disastrous news
and anxious inquiry Along the terraced line of rail rare trains came
creeping and signalling and paused at the threatened corner like
living things conscious of peril The commandant of the post would
hastily review his labours make with a dry throat the signal to
advance and the whole squad line the way and look on in a choking
silence or burst into a brief cheer as the train cleared the point of
danger and shot on perhaps through the thin sunshine between squalls
perhaps with blinking lamps into the gathering rainy twilight

One such scene Carthew will remember till he dies It blew great guns
from the seaward a huge surf bombarded five hundred feet below him
the steep mountains foot close in was a vessel in distress firing
shots from a fowlingpiece if any help might come So he saw and heard
her the moment before the train appeared and paused throwing up a
Babylonian tower of smoke into the rain and oppressing mens hearts
with the scream of her whistle The engineer was there himself he paled
as he made the signal the engine came at a foots pace but the whole
bulk of mountain shook and seemed to nod seaward and the watching
navvies instinctively clutched at shrubs and trees vain precautions
vain as the shots from the poor sailors Once again fear was
disappointed the train passed unscathed and Norris drawing a long
breath remembered the labouring ship and glanced below She was gone

So the days and the nights passed Homeric labour in Homeric
circumstance Carthew was sick with sleeplessness and coffee his hands
softened by the wet were cut to ribbons yet he enjoyed a peace of
mind and health of body hitherto unknown Plenty of open air plenty of
physical exertion a continual instancy of toil here was what had been
hitherto lacking in that misdirected life and the true cure of vital
scepticism To get the train through there was the recurrent problem
no time remained to ask if it were necessary Carthew the idler the
spendthrift the drifting dilettant was soon remarked praised and
advanced The engineer swore by him and pointed him out for an example
Ive a new chum up here Norris overheard him saying a young swell
Hes worth any two in the squad The words fell on the ears of the
discarded son like music and from that moment he not only found an
interest he took a pride in his plebeian tasks

The press of work was still at its highest when quarterday approached
Norris was now raised to a position of some trust at his discretion
trains were stopped or forwarded at the dangerous cornice near North
Clifton and he found in this responsibility both terror and delight
The thought of the seventyfive pounds that would soon await him at the
lawyers and of his own obligation to be present every quarterday in
Sydney filled him for a little with divided councils Then he made
up his mind walked in a slack moment to the inn at Clifton ordered a
sheet of paper and a bottle of beer and wrote explaining that he held
a good appointment which he would lose if he came to Sydney and asking
the lawyer to accept this letter as an evidence of his presence in the
colony and retain the money till next quarterday The answer came in
course of post and was not merely favourable but cordial Although
what you propose is contrary to the terms of my instructions it ran
I willingly accept the responsibility of granting your request I
should say I am agreeably disappointed in your behaviour My experience
has not led me to found much expectations on gentlemen in your
position

The rains abated and the temporary labour was discharged not Norris
to whom the engineer clung as to found money not Norris who found
himself a ganger on the line in the regular staff of navvies His camp
was pitched in a grey wilderness of rock and forest far from any house
as he sat with his mates about the evening fire the trains passing on
the track were their next and indeed their only neighbours except
the wild things of the wood Lovely weather light and monotonous
employment long hours of somnolent campfire talk long sleepless
nights when he reviewed his foolish and fruitless career as he rose and
walked in the moonlit forest an occasional paper of which he would read
all the advertisements with as much relish as the text such was the
tenor of an existence which soon began to weary and harass him He
lacked and regretted the fatigue the furious hurry the suspense the
fires the midnight coffee the rude and mudbespattered poetry of the
first toilful weeks In the quietness of his new surroundings a voice
summoned him from this exorbital part of life and about the middle of
October he threw up his situation and bade farewell to the camp of tents
and the shoulder of Bald Mountain

Clad in his rough clothes with a bundle on his shoulder and his
accumulated wages in his pocket he entered Sydney for the second time
and walked with pleasure and some bewilderment in the cheerful streets
like a man landed from a voyage The sight of the people led him on He
forgot his necessary errands he forgot to eat He wandered in moving
multitudes like a stick upon a river Last he came to the Domain and
strolled there and remembered his shame and sufferings and looked with
poignant curiosity at his successors Hemstead not much shabbier and
no less cheerful than before he recognised and addressed like an old
family friend

That was a good turn you did me said he That railway was the making
of me I hope youve had luck yourself


My word no replied the little man I just sit here and read the
_Dead Bird_ Its the depression in tryde you see Theres no positions
goin that a man like me would care to look at And he showed
Norris his certificates and written characters one from a grocer
in Wooloomooloo one from an ironmonger and a third from a billiard
saloon Yes he said I tried bein a billiard marker Its no
account these lyte hours are no use for a mans health I wont be no
mans slyve he added firmly

On the principle that he who is too proud to be a slave is usually not
too modest to become a pensioner Carthew gave him half a sovereign
and departed being suddenly struck with hunger in the direction of the
Paris House When he came to that quarter of the city the barristers
were trotting in the streets in wig and gown and he stood to observe
them with his bundle on his shoulder and his mind full of curious
recollections of the past

By George cried a voice its Mr Carthew

And turning about he found himself face to face with a handsome sunburnt
youth somewhat fatted arrayed in the finest of fine raiment and
sporting about a sovereigns worth of flowers in his buttonhole Norris
had met him during his first days in Sydney at a farewell supper had
even escorted him on board a schooner full of cockroaches and blackboy
sailors in which he was bound for six months among the islands and had
kept him ever since in entertained remembrance Tom Hadden known to the
bulk of Sydney folk as Tommy was heir to a considerable property which
a prophetic father had placed in the hands of rigorous trustees The
income supported Mr Hadden in splendour for about three months out of
twelve the rest of the year he passed in retreat among the islands
He was now about a week returned from his eclipse pervading Sydney in
hansom cabs and airing the first bloom of six new suits of clothes and
yet the unaffected creature hailed Carthew in his working jeans and
with the damning bundle on his shoulder as he might have claimed
acquaintance with a duke

Come and have a drink was his cheerful cry

Im just going to have lunch at the Paris House returned Carthew
Its a long time since I have had a decent meal

Splendid scheme said Hadden Ive only had breakfast half an hour
ago but well have a private room and Ill manage to pick something
Itll brace me up I was on an awful tear last night and Ive met no
end of fellows this morning To meet a fellow and to stand and share a
drink were with Tom synonymous terms

They were soon at table in the corner room upstairs and paying due
attention to the best fare in Sydney The odd similarity of their
positions drew them together and they began soon to exchange
confidences Carthew related his privations in the Domain and his toils
as a navvy Hadden gave his experience as an amateur copra merchant in
the South Seas and drew a humorous picture of life in a coral island
Of the two plans of retirement Carthew gathered that his own had been
vastly the more lucrative but Haddens trading outfit had consisted
largely of bottled stout and brown sherry for his own consumption

I had champagne too said Hadden but I kept that in case of
sickness until I didnt seem to be going to be sick and then I opened
a pint every Sunday Used to sleep all morning then breakfast with my
pint of fizz and lie in a hammock and read Hallams _Middle Ages_ Have
you read that I always take something solid to the islands Theres no
doubt I did the thing in rather a fine style but if it was gone about a
little cheaper or there were two of us to bear the expense it ought
to pay hand over fist Ive got the influence you see Im a chief now
and sit in the speakhouse under my own strip of roof Id like to see
them taboo ME They darent try it Ive a strong party I can tell you
Why Ive had upwards of thirty cowtops sitting in my front verandah
eating tins of salmon

Cowtops asked Carthew what are they

Thats what Hallam would call feudal retainers explained Hadden not
without vainglory Theyre My Followers They belong to My Family
I tell you they come expensive though you cant fill up all these
retainers on tinned salmon for nothing but whenever I could get it I
would give em squid Squids good for natives but I dont care for it
do youor shark either Its like the working classes at home With
copra at the price it is they ought to be willing to bear their share
of the loss and so Ive told them again and again I think its a mans
duty to open their minds and I try to but you cant get political
economy into them it doesnt seem to reach their intelligence


There was an expression still sticking in Carthews memory and he
returned upon it with a smile Talking of political economy said he
you said if there were two of us to bear the expense the profits would
increase How do you make out that

Ill show you Ill figure it out for you cried Hadden and with a
pencil on the back of the bill of fare proceeded to perform miracles He
was a man or let us rather say a lad of unusual projective power Give
him the faintest hint of any speculation and the figures flowed from
him by the page A lively imagination and a ready though inaccurate
memory supplied his data he delivered himself with an inimitable heat
that made him seem the picture of pugnacity lavished contradiction
had a form of words with or without significance for every form of
criticism and the lookeron alternately smiled at his simplicity and
fervour or was amazed by his unexpected shrewdness He was a kind of
Pinkerton in play I have called Jims the romance of business this was
its Arabian tale

Have you any idea what this would cost he asked pausing at an item

Not I said Carthew

Ten pounds ought to be ample concluded the projector

O nonsense cried Carthew Fifty at the very least

You told me yourself this moment you knew nothing about it cried
Tommy How can I make a calculation if you blow hot and cold You
dont seem able to be serious

But he consented to raise his estimate to twenty and a little after
the calculation coming out with a deficit cut it down again to five
pounds ten with the remark I told you it was nonsense This sort of
thing has to be done strictly or wheres the use

Some of these processes struck Carthew as unsound and he was at times
altogether thrown out by the capricious startings of the prophets mind
These plunges seemed to be gone into for exercise and by the way like
the curvets of a willing horse Gradually the thing took shape the
glittering if baseless edifice arose and the hare still ran on the
mountains but the soup was already served in silver plate Carthew in a
few days could command a hundred and fifty pounds Hadden was ready with
five hundred why should they not recruit a fellow or two more charter
an old ship and go cruising on their own account Carthew was an
experienced yachtsman Hadden professed himself able to work an
approximate sight Money was undoubtedly to be made or why should so
many vessels cruise about the islands they who worked their own ship
were sure of a still higher profit

And whatever else comes of it you see cried Hadden we get our keep
for nothing Come buy some togs thats the first thing you have to do
of course and then well take a hansom and go to the Currency Lass

Im going to stick to the togs I have said Norris

Are you cried Hadden Well I must say I admire you Youre a
regular sage Its what you call Pythagoreanism isnt it if I havent
forgotten my philosophy

Well I call it economy returned Carthew If we are going to try
this thing on I shall want every sixpence

Youll see if were going to try it cried Tommy rising radiant from
table Only mark you Carthew it must be all in your name I have
capital you see but youre all right You can play vacuus viator if
the thing goes wrong

I thought we had just proved it was quite safe said Carthew

Theres nothing safe in business my boy replied the sage not even
bookmaking

The public house and tea garden called the Currency Lass represented
a moderate fortune gained by its proprietor Captain Bostock during
a long active and occasionally historic career among the islands
Anywhere from Tonga to the Admiralty Isles he knew the ropes and could
lie in the native dialect He had seen the end of sandal wood the end
of oil and the beginning of copra and he was himself a commercial
pioneer the first that ever carried human teeth into the Gilberts He
was tried for his life in Fiji in Sir Arthur Gordons time and if ever
he prayed at all the name of Sir Arthur was certainly not forgotten He
was speared in seven places in New Irelandthe same time his mate
was killedthe famous outrage on the brig Jolly Roger but the
treacherous savages made little by their wickedness and Bostock in
spite of their teeth got seventyfive head of volunteer labour on
board of whom not more than a dozen died of injuries He had a hand
besides in the amiable pleasantry which cost the life of Patteson and
when the sham bishop landed prayed and gave his benediction to the
natives Bostock arrayed in a female chemise out of the traderoom had
stood at his right hand and boomed amens This when he was sure he was
among good fellows was his favourite yarn Two hundred head of labour
for a hatful of amens he used to name the tale and its sequel the
death of the real bishop struck him as a circumstance of extraordinary
humour

Many of these details were communicated in the hansom to the surprise
of Carthew

Why do we want to visit this old ruffian he asked

You wait till you hear him replied Tommy That man knows
everything

On descending from the hansom at the Currency Lass Hadden was struck
with the appearance of the cabman a gross saltlooking man redfaced
blueeyed shorthanded and shortwinded perhaps nearing forty

Surely I know you said he Have you driven me before

Manys the time Mr Hadden returned the driver The last time you
was back from the islands it was me that drove you to the races sir

All right jump down and have a drink then said Tom and he turned
and led the way into the garden

Captain Bostock met the party he was a slow sour old man with
fishy eyes greeted Tommy offhand and as was afterwards remembered
exchanged winks with the driver

A bottle of beer for the cabman there at that table said Tom
Whatever you please from shandygaff to champagne at this one here and
you sit down with us Let me make you acquainted with my friend Mr
Carthew Ive come on business Billy I want to consult you as a
friend Im going into the island trade upon my own account


Doubtless the captain was a mine of counsel but opportunity was denied
him He could not venture on a statement he was scarce allowed to
finish a phrase before Hadden swept him from the field with a volley
of protest and correction That projector his face blazing with
inspiration first laid before him at inordinate length a question and
as soon as he attempted to reply leaped at his throat called his facts
in question derided his policy and at times thundered on him from the
heights of moral indignation

I beg your pardon he said once I am a gentleman Mr Carthew here
is a gentleman and we dont mean to do that class of business Cant
you see who you are talking to Cant you talk sense Cant you give us
a dead bird for a good traderoom

No I dont suppose I can returned old Bostock not when I cant
hear my own voice for two seconds together It was gin and guns I did it
with

Take your gin and guns to Putney cried Hadden It was the thing in
your times thats right enough but youre old now and the games up
Ill tell you whats wanted nowadays Bill Bostock said he and did
and took ten minutes to it

Carthew could not refrain from smiling He began to think less seriously
of the scheme Hadden appearing too irresponsible a guide but on the
other hand he enjoyed himself amazingly It was far from being the same
with Captain Bostock

You know a sight dont you remarked that gentleman bitterly when
Tommy paused

I know a sight more than you if thats what you mean retorted Tom
It stands to reason I do Youre not a man of any education youve
been all your life at sea or in the islands you dont suppose you can
give points to a man like me

Heres your health Tommy returned Bostock Youll make an Aone
bake in the New Hebrides

Thats what I call talking cried Tom not perhaps grasping the spirit
of this doubtful compliment Now you give me your attention We have
the money and the enterprise and I have the experience what we want is
a cheap smart boat a good captain and an introduction to some house
that will give us credit for the trade

Well Ill tell you said Captain Bostock I have seen men like you
baked and eaten and complained of afterwards Some was tough and some
hadnt no flaviour he added grimly

What do you mean by that cried Tom

I mean I dont care cried Bostock It aint any of my interests I
havent underwrote your life Only Im blest if Im not sorry for the
cannibal as tries to eat your head And what I recommend is a cheap
smart coffin and a good undertaker See if you can find a house to give
you credit for a coffin Look at your friend there HES got some sense
hes laughing at you so as he cant stand

The exact degree of illfeeling in Mr Bostocks mind was difficult to
gauge perhaps there was not much perhaps he regarded his remarks as a
form of courtly badinage But there is little doubt that Hadden resented
them He had even risen from his place and the conference was on
the point of breaking up when a new voice joined suddenly in the
conversation

The cabman sat with his back turned upon the party smoking a meerschaum
pipe Not a word of Tommys eloquence had missed him and he now faced
suddenly about with these amazing words

Excuse me gentlemen if youll buy me the ship I want Ill get you
the trade on credit

There was a pause

Well what do YOU mean gasped Tommy

Better tell em who I am Billy said the cabman

Think it safe Joe inquired Mr Bostock

Ill take my risk of it returned the cabman

Gentlemen said Bostock rising solemnly let me make you acquainted
with Captain Wicks of the Grace Darling

Yes gentlemen that is what I am said the cabman You know Ive
been in trouble and I dont deny but what I struck the blow and where
was I to get evidence of my provocation So I turned to and took a cab
and Ive driven one for three year now and nobody the wiser

I beg your pardon said Carthew joining almost for the first time
Im a new chum What was the charge

Murder said Captain Wicks and I dont deny but what I struck the
blow And theres no sense in my trying to deny I was afraid to go to
trial or why would I be here But its a fact it was flat mutiny Ask
Billy here He knows how it was

Carthew breathed long he had a strange halfpleasurable sense of
wading deeper in the tide of life Well said he you were going on
to say

I was going on to say this said the captain sturdily Ive overheard
what Mr Hadden has been saying and I think he talks good sense I like
some of his ideas first chop Hes sound on traderooms hes all there
on the traderoom and I see that he and I would pull together Then
youre both gentlemen and I like that observed Captain Wicks And
then Ill tell you Im tired of this cabbing cruise and I want to get
to work again Now heres my offer Ive a little money I can stake
upall of a hundred anyway Then my old firm will give me trade and
jump at the chance they never lost by me they know what Im worth as
supercargo And last of all you want a good captain to sail your ship
for you Well here I am Ive sailed schooners for ten years Ask Billy
if I can handle a schooner

No man better said Billy

And as for my character as a shipmate concluded Wicks go and ask my
old firm

But look here cried Hadden how do you mean to manage You can whisk
round in a hansom and no questions asked But if you try to come on a
quarterdeck my boy youll get nabbed

Ill have to keep back till the last replied Wicks and take another
name

But how about clearing what other name asked Tommy a little
bewildered

I dont know yet returned the captain with a grin Ill see what
the name is on my new certificate and thatll be good enough for me
If I cant get one to buy though I never heard of such a thing theres
old Kirkup hes turned some sort of farmer down Bondi way hell hire
me his

You seemed to speak as if you had a ship in view said Carthew

So I have too said Captain Wicks and a beauty Schooner yacht
Dream got lines you never saw the beat of and a witch to go She
passed me once off Thursday Island doing two knots to my one and laying
a point and a half better and the Grace Darling was a ship that I was
proud of I took and tore my hair The Dreams been MY dream ever since
That was in her old days when she carried a blue ensn Grant Sanderson
was the party as owned her he was rich and mad and got a fever at last
somewhere about the Fly River and took and died The captain brought
the body back to Sydney and paid off Well it turned out Grant
Sanderson had left any quantity of wills and any quantity of widows and
no fellow could make out which was the genuine article All the widows
brought lawsuits against all the rest and every will had a firm of
lawyers on the quarterdeck as long as your arm They tell me it was
one of the biggest turnsto that ever was seen bar Tichborne the Lord
Chamberlain himself was floored and so was the Lord Chancellor and all
that time the Dream lay rotting up by Glebe Point Well its done now
theyve picked out a widow and a will tossed up for it as like as not
and the Dreams for sale Shell go cheap shes had a long turnto at
rotting

What size is she

Well big enough We dont want her bigger A hundred and ninety going
two hundred replied the captain Shes fully big for us three it
would be all the better if we had another hand though its a pity too
when you can pick up natives for half nothing Then we must have a cook
I can fix raw sailormen but theres no going to sea with a newchum
cook I can lay hands on the man we want for that a Highway boy an
old shipmate of mine of the name of Amalu Cooks first rate and its
always better to have a native he aint fly you can turn him to as you
please and he dont know enough to stand out for his rights

From the moment that Captain Wicks joined in the conversation Carthew
recovered interest and confidence the man whatever he might have done
was plainly goodnatured and plainly capable if he thought well of the
enterprise offered to contribute money brought experience and could
thus solve at a word the problem of the trade Carthew was content to
go ahead As for Hadden his cup was full he and Bostock forgave each
other in champagne toast followed toast it was proposed and carried
amid acclamation to change the name of the schooner when she should
be bought to the Currency Lass and the Currency Lass Island Trading
Company was practically founded before dusk

Three days later Carthew stood before the lawyer still in his jean
suit received his hundred and fifty pounds and proceeded rather
timidly to ask for more indulgence

I have a chance to get on in the world he said By tomorrow evening
I expect to be part owner of a ship

Dangerous property Mr Carthew said the lawyer

Not if the partners work her themselves and stand to go down along with
her was the reply

I conceive it possible you might make something of it in that way
returned the other But are you a seaman I thought you had been in the
diplomatic service

I am an old yachtsman said Norris And I must do the best I can
A fellow cant live in New South Wales upon diplomacy But the point I
wish to prepare you for is this It will be impossible I should present
myself here next quarterday we expect to make a six months cruise of
it among the islands

Sorry Mr Carthew I cant hear of that replied the lawyer

I mean upon the same conditions as the last said Carthew

The conditions are exactly opposite said the lawyer Last time I
had reason to know you were in the colony and even then I stretched a
point This time by your own confession you are contemplating a breach
of the agreement and I give you warning if you carry it out and I
receive proof of it for I will agree to regard this conversation as
confidential I shall have no choice but to do my duty Be here on
quarterday or your allowance ceases

This is very hard and I think rather silly returned Carthew

It is not of my doing I have my instructions said the lawyer

And you so read these instructions that I am to be prohibited from
making an honest livelihood asked Carthew

Let us be frank said the lawyer I find nothing in these
instructions about an honest livelihood I have no reason to suppose
my clients care anything about that I have reason to suppose only
one thingthat they mean you shall stay in this colony and to guess
another Mr Carthew And to guess another

What do you mean by that asked Norris

I mean that I imagine on very strong grounds that your family desire
to see no more of you said the lawyer O they may be very wrong
but that is the impression conveyed that is what I suppose I am paid to
bring about and I have no choice but to try and earn my hire

I would scorn to deceive you said Norris with a strong flush you
have guessed rightly My family refuse to see me but I am not going to
England I am going to the islands How does that affect the islands

Ah but I dont know that you are going to the islands said the
lawyer looking down and spearing the blottingpaper with a pencil

I beg your pardon I have the pleasure of informing you said Norris

I am afraid Mr Carthew that I cannot regard that communication as
official was the slow reply

I am not accustomed to have my word doubted cried Norris

Hush I allow no one to raise his voice in my office said the
lawyer And for that matteryou seem to be a young gentleman of
senseconsider what I know of you You are a discarded son your family
pays money to be shut of you What have you done I dont know But do
you not see how foolish I should be if I exposed my business reputation
on the safeguard of the honour of a gentleman of whom I know just so
much and no more This interview is very disagreeable Why prolong it
Write home get my instructions changed and I will change my behaviour
Not otherwise

I am very fond of three hundred a year said Norris but I cannot pay
the price required I shall not have the pleasure of seeing you again

You must please yourself said the lawyer Fail to be here next
quarterday and the thing stops But I warn you and I mean the warning
in a friendly spirit Three months later you will be here begging and I
shall have no choice but to show you in the street

I wish you a goodevening said Norris

The same to you Mr Carthew retorted the lawyer and rang for his
clerk

So it befell that Norris during what remained to him of arduous days in
Sydney saw not again the face of his legal adviser and he was already
at sea and land was out of sight when Hadden brought him a Sydney
paper over which he had been dozing in the shadow of the galley and
showed him an advertisement

Mr Norris Carthew is earnestly entreated to call without delay at the
office of Mr  where important intelligence awaits him

It must manage to wait for me six months said Norris lightly enough
but yet conscious of a pang of curiosity




CHAPTER XXIII THE BUDGET OF THE CURRENCY LASS


Before noon on the 26th November there cleared from the port of Sydney
the schooner Currency Lass The owner Norris Carthew was on board in
the somewhat unusual position of mate the masters name purported to
be William Kirkup the cook was a Hawaiian boy Joseph Amalu and there
were two hands before the mast Thomas Hadden and Richard Hemstead the
latter chosen partly because of his humble character partly because he
had an oddjobmans handiness with tools The Currency Lass was bound
for the South Sea Islands and first of all for Butaritari in the
Gilberts on a register but it was understood about the harbour that
her cruise was more than half a pleasure trip A friend of the late
Grant Sanderson of Auchentroon and Kilclarty might have recognised in
that tallmasted ship the transformed and rechristened Dream and
the Lloyds surveyor had the services of such a one been called in
requisition must have found abundant subject of remark

For time during her three years inaction had eaten deep into the
Dream and her fittings she had sold in consequence a shade above her
value as old junk and the three adventurers had scarce been able to
afford even the most vital repairs The rigging indeed had been partly
renewed and the rest set up all Grant Sandersons old canvas had been
patched together into one decently serviceable suit of sails Grant
Sandersons masts still stood and might have wondered at themselves
I havent the heart to tap them Captain Wicks used to observe as he
squinted up their height or patted their rotundity and as rotten as
our foremast was an accepted metaphor in the ships company The sequel
rather suggests it may have been sounder than was thought but no one
knew for certain just as no one except the captain appreciated the
dangers of the cruise The captain indeed saw with clear eyes and
spoke his mind aloud and though a man of an astonishing hotblooded
courage following life and taking its dangers in the spirit of a
hound upon the slot he had made a point of a big whaleboat Take your
choice he had said either new masts and rigging or that boat I
simply aint going to sea without the one or the other Chicken coops
are good enough no doubt and so is a dinghy but they aint for Joe
And his partners had been forced to consent and saw six and thirty
pounds of their small capital vanish in the turn of a hand

All four had toiled the best part of six weeks getting ready and though
Captain Wicks was of course not seen or heard of a fifth was there to
help them a fellow in a bushy red beard which he would sometimes lay
aside when he was below and who strikingly resembled Captain Wicks in
voice and character As for Captain Kirkup he did not appear till the
last moment when he proved to be a burly mariner bearded like Abou
Ben Adhem All the way down the harbour and through the Heads his
milkwhite whiskers blew in the wind and were conspicuous from shore
but the Currency Lass had no sooner turned her back upon the lighthouse
than he went below for the inside of five seconds and reappeared clean
shaven So many doublings and devices were required to get to sea with
an unseaworthy ship and a captain that was wanted Nor might
even these have sufficed but for the fact that Hadden was a public
character and the whole cruise regarded with an eye of indulgence as
one of Toms engaging eccentricities The ship besides had been a
yacht before and it came the more natural to allow her still some of
the dangerous liberties of her old employment

A strange ship they had made of it her lofty spars disfigured with
patched canvas her panelled cabin fitted for a traderoom with rude
shelves And the life they led in that anomalous schooner was no less
curious than herself Amalu alone berthed forward the rest occupied
staterooms camped upon the satin divans and sat down in Grant
Sandersons parquetry smokingroom to meals of junk and potatoes bad
of their kind and often scant in quantity Hemstead grumbled Tommy
had occasional moments of revolt and increased the ordinary by a
few haphazard tins or a bottle of his own brown sherry But Hemstead
grumbled from habit Tommy revolted only for the moment and there
was underneath a real and general acquiescence in these hardships For
besides onions and potatoes the Currency Lass may be said to have
gone to sea without stores She carried two thousand pounds worth of
assorted trade advanced on credit their whole hope and fortune It
was upon this that they subsistedmice in their own granary They dined
upon their future profits and every scanty meal was so much in the
savings bank

Republican as were their manners there was no practical at least no
dangerous lack of discipline Wicks was the only sailor on board
there was none to criticise and besides he was so easygoing and so
merryminded that none could bear to disappoint him Carthew did his
best partly for the love of doing it partly for love of the captain
Amalu was a willing drudge and even Hemstead and Hadden turned to upon
occasion with a will Tommys department was the trade and traderoom he
would work down in the hold or over the shelves of the cabin till
the Sydney dandy was unrecognizable come up at last draw a bucket
of seawater bathe change and lie down on deck over a big sheaf of
Sydney _Heralds_ and _Dead Birds_ or perhaps with a volume of Buckles
_History of Civilisation_ the standard work selected for that cruise
In the latter case a smile went round the ship for Buckle almost
invariably laid his student out and when Tom awoke again he was almost
always in the humour for brown sherry The connection was so well
established that a glass of Buckle or a bottle of civilisation
became current pleasantries on board the Currency Lass

Hemsteads province was that of the repairs and he had his hands full
Nothing on board but was decayed in a proportion the lamps leaked so
did the decks doorknobs came off in the hand mouldings parted company
with the panels the pump declined to suck and the defective bathroom
came near to swamp the ship Wicks insisted that all the nails were long
ago consumed and that she was only glued together by the rust You
shouldnt make me laugh so much Tommy he would say Im afraid Ill
shake the sternpost out of her And as Hemstead went to and fro
with his tool basket on an endless round of tinkering Wicks lost
no opportunity of chaffing him upon his duties If youd turn to at
sailoring or washing paint or something useful now he would say
I could see the fun of it But to be mending things that havent no
insides to them appears to me the height of foolishness And doubtless
these continual pleasantries helped to reassure the landsmen who went
to and fro unmoved under circumstances that might have daunted Nelson

The weather was from the outset splendid and the wind fair and steady
The ship sailed like a witch This Currency Lass is a powerful old
girl and has more complaints than I would care to put a name on the
captain would say as he pricked the chart but she could show her
blooming heels to anything of her size in the Western Pacific To
wash decks relieve the wheel do the days work after dinner on the
smokingroom table and take in kites at nightsuch was the easy
routine of their life In the eveningabove all if Tommy had produced
some of his civilisationyarns and music were the rule Amalu had
a sweet Hawaiian voice and Hemstead a great hand upon the banjo
accompanied his own quavering tenor with effect There was a sense in
which the little man could sing It was great to hear him deliver _My
Boy Tammie_ in Austrylian and the words some of the worst of the
ruffian Macneils were hailed in his version with inextinguishable
mirth

 Where hye ye been a dye


 he would ask and answer himself

 Ive been by burn and flowery brye
 Meadow green an mountain grye
 Courtin o this young thing
 Just come frye her mammie

It was the accepted jest for all hands to greet the conclusion of this
song with the simultaneous cry My word thus winging the arrow of
ridicule with a feather from the singers wing But he had his
revenge with _Home Sweet Home_ and _Where is my Wandering Boy
Tonight_ditties into which he threw the most intolerable pathos It
appeared he had no home nor had ever had one nor yet any vestige of
a family except a truculent uncle a baker in Newcastle NSW His
domestic sentiment was therefore wholly in the air and expressed
an unrealised ideal Or perhaps of all his experiences this of
the Currency Lass with its kindly playful and tolerant society
approached it the most nearly

It is perhaps because I know the sequel but I can never think upon this
voyage without a profound sense of pity and mystery of the ship once
the whim of a rich blackguard faring with her battered fineries
and upon her homely errand across the plains of ocean and past
the gorgeous scenery of dawn and sunset and the ships company so
strangely assembled so Britishly chuckleheaded filling their days
with chaff in place of conversation no human book on board with them
except Haddens Buckle and not a creature fit either to read or to
understand it and the one mark of any civilised interest being when
Carthew filled in his spare hours with the pencil and the brush the
whole unconscious crew of them posting in the meanwhile towards so
tragic a disaster

Twentyeight days out of Sydney on Christmas eve they fetched up to
the entrance of the lagoon and plied all that night outside keeping
their position by the lights of fishers on the reef and the outlines of
the palms against the cloudy sky With the break of day the schooner
was hove to and the signal for a pilot shown But it was plain her
lights must have been observed in the darkness by the native fishermen
and word carried to the settlement for a boat was already under weigh
She came towards them across the lagoon under a great press of sail
lying dangerously down so that at times in the heavier puffs they
thought she would turn turtle covered the distance in fine style
luffed up smartly alongside and emitted a haggard looking white man in
pyjamas

Goodmornin Capn said he when he had made good his entrance I
was taking you for a Fiji manofwar what with your flush decks and
them spars Well genlemen all heres wishing you a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year he added and lurched against a stay

Why youre never the pilot exclaimed Wicks studying him with a
profound disfavour Youve never taken a ship indont tell me

Well I should guess I have returned the pilot Im Captain Dobbs
I am and when I take charge the captain of that ship can go below and
shave

But man alive youre drunk man cried the captain

Drunk repeated Dobbs You cant have seen much life if you call me
drunk Im only just beginning Come night I wont say I guess Ill be
properly full by then But now Im the soberest man in all Big Muggin

It wont do retorted Wicks Not for Joseph sir I cant have you
piling up my schooner

All right said Dobbs lay and rot where you are or take and go
in and pile her up for yourself like the captain of the Leslie Thats
business I guess grudged me twenty dollars pilotage and lost twenty
thousand in trade and a brand new schooner ripped the keel right off of
her and she went down in the inside of four minutes and lies in twenty
fathom trade and all

Whats all this cried Wicks Trade What vessel was this Leslie
anyhow

Consigned to Cohen and Co from Frisco returned the pilot and
badly wanted Theres a barque inside filling up for Hamburgyou see
her spars over there and theres two more ships due all the way from
Germany one in two months they say and one in three Cohen and Cos
agent thats Mr Topelius has taken and lain down with the jaundice on
the strength of it I guess most people would in his shoes no trade
no copra and twenty hundred ton of shipping due If youve any copra on
board capn heres your chance Topelius will buy gold down and give
three cents Its all found money to him the way it is whatever he
pays for it And thats what come of going back on the pilot

Excuse me one moment Captain Dobbs I wish to speak with my mate
said the captain whose face had begun to shine and his eyes to sparkle

Please yourself replied the pilot You couldnt think of offering
a man a nip could you just to brace him up This kind of thing looks
damned inhospitable and gives a schooner a bad name

Ill talk about that after the anchors down returned Wicks and he
drew Carthew forward I say he whispered heres a fortune

How much do you call that asked Carthew

I cant put a figure on it yetI darent said the captain We might
cruise twenty years and not find the match of it And suppose another
ship came in tonight Everythings possible And the difficulty is
this Dobbs Hes as drunk as a marine How can we trust him We aint
insuredworse luck

Suppose you took him aloft and got him to point out the channel
suggested Carthew If he tallied at all with the chart and didnt fall
out of the rigging perhaps we might risk it

Well alls risk here returned the captain Take the wheel yourself
and stand by Mind if theres two orders follow mine not his Set the
cook forard with the headsls and the two others at the main sheet
and see they dont sit on it With that he called the pilot they
swarmed aloft in the fore rigging and presently after there was bawled
down the welcome order to ease sheets and fill away

At a quarter before nine oclock on Christmas morning the anchor was let
go

The first cruise of the Currency Lass had thus ended in a stroke of
fortune almost beyond hope She had brought two thousand pounds worth
of trade straight as a homing pigeon to the place where it was most
required And Captain Wicks or rather Captain Kirkup showed himself
the man to make the best of his advantage For hard upon two days he
walked a verandah with Topelius for hard upon two days his partners
watched from the neighbouring public house the field of battle and the
lamps were not yet lighted on the evening of the second before the enemy
surrendered Wicks came across to the Sans Souci as the saloon was
called his face nigh black his eyes almost closed and all bloodshot
and yet bright as lighted matches

Come out here boys he said and when they were some way off
among the palms I hold twentyfour he added in a voice scarcely
recognizable and doubtless referring to the venerable game of cribbage

What do you mean asked Tommy

Ive sold the trade answered Wicks or rather Ive sold only
some of it for Ive kept back all the mess beef and half the flour and
biscuit and by God were still provisioned for four months By God
its as good as stolen

My word cried Hemstead

But what have you sold it for gasped Carthew the captains almost
insane excitement shaking his nerve

Let me tell it my own way cried Wicks loosening his neck Let me
get at it gradual or Ill explode Ive not only sold it boys Ive
wrung out a charter on my own terms to Frisco and back on my own
terms I made a point of it I fooled him first by making believe I
wanted copra which of course I knew he wouldnt hear ofcouldnt in
fact and whenever he showed fight I trotted out the copra and that
man dived I would take nothing but copra you see and so Ive got the
blooming lot in specieall but two short bills on Frisco And the sum
Well this whole adventure including two thousand pounds of credit
cost us two thousand seven hundred and some odd Thats all paid back
in thirty days cruise weve paid for the schooner and the trade Heard
ever any man the match of that And its not all For besides that
said the captain hammering his words weve got Thirteen Blooming
Hundred Pounds of profit to divide I bled him in four Thou he cried
in a voice that broke like a schoolboys

For a moment the partners looked upon their chief with stupefaction
incredulous surprise their only feeling Tommy was the first to grasp
the consequences

Here he said in a hard business tone Come back to that saloon
Ive got to get drunk

You must please excuse me boys said the captain earnestly I
darent taste nothing If I was to drink one glass of beer its my
belief Id have the apoplexy The last scrimmage and the blooming
triumph pretty nigh hand done me

Well then three cheers for the captain proposed Tommy

But Wicks held up a shaking hand Not that either boys he pleaded
Think of the other buffer and let him down easy If Im like this
just fancy what Topelius is If he heard us singing out hed have the
staggers

As a matter of fact Topelius accepted his defeat with a good grace
but the crew of the wrecked Leslie who were in the same employment and
loyal to their firm took the thing more bitterly Rough words and ugly
looks were common Once even they hooted Captain Wicks from the saloon
verandah the Currency Lasses drew out on the other side for some
minutes there had like to have been a battle in Butaritari and though
the occasion passed off without blows it left on either side an
increase of illfeeling

No such small matter could affect the happiness of the successful
traders Five days more the ship lay in the lagoon with little
employment for any one but Tommy and the captain for Topeliuss natives
discharged cargo and brought ballast the time passed like a pleasant
dream the adventurers sat up half the night debating and praising their
good fortune or strayed by day in the narrow isle gaping like Cockney
tourists and on the first of the new year the Currency Lass weighed
anchor for the second time and set sail for Frisco attended by the
same fine weather and good luck She crossed the doldrums with but
small delay on a wind and in ballast of broken coral she outdid
expectations and what added to the happiness of the ships company
the small amount of work that fell on them to do was now lessened by
the presence of another hand This was the boatswain of the Leslie he
had been on bad terms with his own captain had already spent his wages
in the saloons of Butaritari had wearied of the place and while all
his shipmates coldly refused to set foot on board the Currency Lass he
had offered to work his passage to the coast He was a north of Ireland
man between Scotch and Irish rough loud humorous and emotional not
without sterling qualities and an expert and careful sailor His frame
of mind was different indeed from that of his new shipmates instead of
making an unexpected fortune he had lost a berth and he was besides
disgusted with the rations and really appalled at the condition of the
schooner A stateroom door had stuck the first day at sea and Mac as
they called him laid his strength to it and plucked it from the hinges

Glory said he this ships rotten

I believe you my boy said Captain Wicks

The next day the sailor was observed with his nose aloft

Dont you get looking at these sticks the captain said or youll
have a fit and fall overboard

Mac turned towards the speaker with rather a wild eye Why I see what
looks like a patch of dry rot up yonder that I bet I could stick my
fist into said he

Looks as if a fellow could stick his head into it dont it returned
Wicks But theres no good prying into things that cant be mended

I think I was a Currency Ass to come on board of her reflected Mac

Well I never said she was seaworthy replied the captain I only
said she could show her blooming heels to anything afloat And besides
I dont know that its dry rot I kind of sometimes hope it isnt Here
turn to and heave the log thatll cheer you up

Well theres no denying it youre a holy captain said Mac

And from that day on he made but the one reference to the ships
condition and that was whenever Tommy drew upon his cellar Heres to
the junk trade he would say as he held out his can of sherry

Why do you always say that asked Tommy

I had an uncle in the business replied Mac and launched at once into
a yarn in which an incredible number of the characters were laid
out as nice as you would want to see and the oaths made up about
twofifths of every conversation

Only once he gave them a taste of his violence he talked of it indeed
often Im rather a voilent man he would say not without pride but
this was the only specimen Of a sudden he turned on Hemstead in the
ships waist knocked him against the foresail boom then knocked him
under it and had set him up and knocked him down once more before any
one had drawn a breath

Here Belay that roared Wicks leaping to his feet I wont have
none of this

Mac turned to the captain with ready civility I only want to learn him
manners said he He took and called me Irishman

Did he said Wicks O thats a different story What made you do it
you tomfool You aint big enough to call any man that

I didnt call him it spluttered Hemstead through his blood and
tears I only mentionedlike he was

Well lets have no more of it said Wicks

But you ARE Irish aint you Carthew asked of his new shipmate
shortly after

I may be replied Mac but Ill allow no Sydney duck to call me so
No he added with a sudden heated countenance nor any Britisher that
walks Why look here he went on youre a young swell arent you
Suppose I called you that Ill show you you would say and turn to
and take it out of me straight

On the 28th of January when in lat 27 degrees 20 N long 177
degrees W the wind chopped suddenly into the west not very strong
but puffy and with flaws of rain The captain eager for easting made
a fair wind of it and guyed the booms out wing and wing It was Tommys
trick at the wheel and as it was within half an hour of the relief
seven thirty in the morning the captain judged it not worth while to
change him

The puffs were heavy but short there was nothing to be called a squall
no danger to the ship and scarce more than usual to the doubtful spars
All hands were on deck in their oilskins expecting breakfast the
galley smoked the ship smelt of coffee all were in good humour to be
speeding eastward a full nine when the rotten foresail tore suddenly
between two cloths and then split to either hand It was for all the
world as though some archangel with a huge sword had slashed it with the
figure of a cross all hands ran to secure the slatting canvas and in
the sudden uproar and alert Tommy Hadden lost his head Many of his
days have been passed since then in explaining how the thing happened
of these explanations it will be sufficient to say that they were all
different and none satisfactory and the gross fact remains that the
main boom gybed carried away the tackle broke the mainmast some three
feet above the deck and whipped it overboard For near a minute the
suspected foremast gallantly resisted then followed its companion and
by the time the wreck was cleared of the whole beautiful fabric that
enabled them to skim the seas two ragged stumps remained

In these vast and solitary waters to be dismasted is perhaps the worst
calamity Let the ship turn turtle and go down and at least the pang is
over But men chained on a hulk may pass months scanning the empty sea
line and counting the steps of deaths invisible approach There is
no help but in the boats and what a help is that There heaved the
Currency Lass for instance a wingless lump and the nearest human
coast that of Kauai in the Sandwiches lay about a thousand miles to
south and east of her Over the way there to men contemplating that
passage in an open boat all kinds of misery and the fear of death and
of madness brooded

A serious company sat down to breakfast but the captain helped his
neighbours with a smile

Now boys he said after a pull at the hot coffee were done with
this Currency Lass and no mistake One good job we made her pay while
she lasted and she paid first rate and if we were to try our hand
again we can try in style Another good job we have a fine stiff
roomy boat and you know who you have to thank for that Weve got six
lives to save and a pot of money and the point is where are we to
take em

Its all two thousand miles to the nearest of the Sandwiches I fancy
observed Mac

No not so bad as that returned the captain But its bad enough
rather bettern a thousand

I know a man who once did twelve hundred in a boat said Mac and he
had all he wanted He fetched ashore in the Marquesas and never set a
foot on anything floating from that day to this He said he would rather
put a pistol to his head and knock his brains out

Ay ay said Wicks Well I remember a boats crew that made this very
island of Kauai and from just about where we lie or a bit further
When they got up with the land they were clean crazy There was an
ironbound coast and an Old Bob Ridley of a surf on The natives hailed
em from fishingboats and sung out it couldnt be done at the money
Much they cared there was the land that was all they knew and they
turned to and drove the boat slap ashore in the thick of it and was
all drowned but one No boat trips are my eye concluded the captain
gloomily

The tone was surprising in a man of his indomitable temper Come
Captain said Carthew you have something else up your sleeve out
with it

Its a fact admitted Wicks You see theres a raft of little bally
reefs about here kind of chickenpox on the chart Well I looked em
all up and theres oneMidway or Brooks they call it not forty mile
from our assigned positionthat I got news of It turns out its a
coaling station of the Pacific Mail he said simply

Well and I know it aint no such a thing said Mac I been
quartermaster in that line myself

All right returned Wicks Theres the book Read what Hoyt
saysread it aloud and let the others hear

Hoyts falsehood as readers know was explicit incredulity was
impossible and the news itself delightful beyond hope Each saw in his
minds eye the boat draw in to a trim island with a wharf coalsheds
gardens the Stars and Stripes and the white cottage of the keeper
saw themselves idle a few weeks in tolerable quarters and then step on
board the China mail romantic waifs and yet with pocketsful of money
calling for champagne and waited on by troops of stewards Breakfast
that had begun so dully ended amid sober jubilation and all hands
turned immediately to prepare the boat

Now that all spars were gone it was no easy job to get her launched
Some of the necessary cargo was first stowed on board the specie in
particular being packed in a strong chest and secured with lashings to
the afterthwart in case of a capsize Then a piece of the bulwark was
razed to the level of the deck and the boat swung thwartship made
fast with a slack line to either stump and successfully run out For a
voyage of forty miles to hospitable quarters not much food or water
was required but they took both in superfluity Amalu and Mac both
ingrained sailormen had chests which were the headquarters of their
lives two more chests with handbags oilskins and blankets supplied
the others Hadden amid general applause added the last case of the
brown sherry the captain brought the log instruments and chronometer
nor did Hemstead forget the banjo or a pinned handkerchief of Butaritari
shells

It was about three PM when they pushed off and the wind being still
westerly fell to the oars Well weve got the guts out of YOU was
the captains nodded farewell to the hulk of the Currency Lass which
presently shrank and faded in the sea A little after a calm succeeded
with much rain and the first meal was eaten and the watch below lay
down to their uneasy slumber on the bilge under a roaring showerbath
The twentyninth dawned overhead from out of ragged clouds there is
no moment when a boat at sea appears so trenchantly black and so
conspicuously little and the crew looked about them at the sky and
water with a thrill of loneliness and fear With sunrise the trade set
in lusty and true to the point sail was made the boat flew and by
about four in the afternoon they were well up with the closed part of
the reef and the captain standing on the thwart and holding by the
mast was studying the island through the binoculars

Well and wheres your station cried Mac

I dont someway pick it up replied the captain

No nor never will retorted Mac with a clang of despair and triumph
in his tones

The truth was soon plain to all No buoys no beacons no lights no
coal no station the castaways pulled through a lagoon and landed on
an isle where was no mark of man but wreckwood and no sound but of the
sea For the seafowl that harboured and lived there at the epoch of my
visit were then scattered into the uttermost parts of the ocean and
had left no traces of their sojourn besides dropped feathers and addled
eggs It was to this they had been sent for this they had stooped all
night over the dripping oars hourly moving further from relief The
boat for as small as it was was yet eloquent of the hands of men a
thing alone indeed upon the sea but yet in itself all human and the
isle for which they had exchanged it was ingloriously savage a place
of distress solitude and hunger unrelieved There was a strong glare
and shadow of the evening over all in which they sat or lay not
speaking careless even to eat men swindled out of life and riches by
a lying book In the great good nature of the whole party no word of
reproach had been addressed to Hadden the author of these disasters
But the new blow was less magnanimously borne and many angry glances
rested on the captain

Yet it was himself who roused them from their lethargy Grudgingly they
obeyed drew the boat beyond tidemark and followed him to the top of
the miserable islet whence a view was commanded of the whole wheel of
the horizon then part darkened under the coming night part dyed with
the hues of the sunset and populous with the sunset clouds Here the
camp was pitched and a tent run up with the oars sails and mast And
here Amalu at no mans bidding from the mere instinct of habitual
service built a fire and cooked a meal Night was come and the stars
and the silver sickle of new moon beamed overhead before the meal
was ready The cold sea shone about them and the fire glowed in their
faces as they ate Tommy had opened his case and the brown sherry went
the round but it was long before they came to conversation

Well is it to be Kauai after all asked Mac suddenly

This is bad enough for me said Tommy Lets stick it out where we
are

Well I can tell ye one thing said Mac if ye care to hear it When
I was in the China mail we once made this island Its in the course
from Honolulu

Deuce it is cried Carthew That settles it then Lets stay We
must keep good fires going and theres plenty wreck

Lashings of wreck said the Irishman Theres nothing here but wreck
and coffin boards

But well have to make a proper blyze objected Hemstead You cant
see a fire like this not any wye awye I mean

Cant you said Carthew Look round

They did and saw the hollow of the night the bare bright face of the
sea and the stars regarding them and the voices died in their bosoms
at the spectacle In that huge isolation it seemed they must be visible
from China on the one hand and California on the other

My God its dreary whispered Hemstead

Dreary cried Mac and fell suddenly silent

Its better than a boat anyway said Hadden Ive had my bellyful of
boat

What kills me is that specie the captain broke out Think of all
that richesfour thousand in gold bad silver and short billsall
found money tooand no more use than that much dung

Ill tell you one thing said Tommy I dont like it being in the
boatI dont care to have it so far away

Why whos to take it cried Mac with a guffaw of evil laughter

But this was not at all the feeling of the partners who rose clambered
down the isle brought back the inestimable treasurechest slung upon
two oars and set it conspicuous in the shining of the fire

Theres my beauty cried Wicks viewing it with a cocked head Thats
better than a bonfire What we have a chest here and bills for close
upon two thousand pounds theres no show to thatit would go in
your vestpocketbut the rest upwards of forty pounds avoirdupois of
coined gold and close on two hundredweight of Chile silver What aint
that good enough to fetch a fleet Do you mean to say that wont affect
a ships compass Do you mean to tell me that the lookout wont turn to
and SMELL it he cried

Mac who had no part nor lot in the bills the forty pounds of gold or
the two hundredweight of silver heard this with impatience and fell
into a bitter choking laughter Youll see he said harshly Youll
be glad to feed them bills into the fire before youre through with ut
And he turned passed by himself out of the ring of the firelight and
stood gazing seaward

His speech and his departure extinguished instantly those sparks of
better humour kindled by the dinner and the chest The group fell again
to an illfavoured silence and Hemstead began to touch the banjo as
was his habit of an evening His repertory was small the chords of
_Home Sweet Home_ fell under his fingers and when he had played the
symphony he instinctively raised up his voice Be it never so umble
theres no plyce like ome he sang The last word was still upon his
lips when the instrument was snatched from him and dashed into the
fire and he turned with a cry to look into the furious countenance of
Mac

Ill be damned if I stand this cried the captain leaping up
belligerent

I told ye I was a voilent man said Mac with a movement of
deprecation very surprising in one of his character Why dont he give
me a chance then Havent we enough to bear the way we are And to the
wonder and dismay of all the man choked upon a sob Its ashamed of
meself I am he said presently his Irish accent twentyfold increased
I ask all your pardons for me voilence and especially the little
mans who is a harmless crayture and heres me hand tom if hell
condescind to take me by t

So this scene of barbarity and sentimentalism passed off leaving behind
strange and incongruous impressions True every one was perhaps glad
when silence succeeded that all too appropriate music true Macs
apology and subsequent behaviour rather raised him in the opinion of
his fellowcastaways But the discordant note had been struck and its
harmonics tingled in the brain In that savage houseless isle the
passions of man had sounded if only for the moment and all men
trembled at the possibilities of horror

It was determined to stand watch and watch in case of passing vessels
and Tommy on fire with an idea volunteered to stand the first The
rest crawled under the tent and were soon enjoying that comfortable
gift of sleep which comes everywhere and to all men quenching
anxieties and speeding time And no sooner were all settled no sooner
had the drone of many snorers begun to mingle with and overcome the
surf than Tommy stole from his post with the case of sherry and
dropped it in a quiet cove in a fathom of water But the stormy
inconstancy of Macs behaviour had no connection with a gill or two of
wine his passions angry and otherwise were on a different sail plan
from his neighbours and there were possibilities of good and evil in
that hybrid Celt beyond their prophecy

About two in the morning the starry skyor so it seemed for the
drowsy watchman had not observed the approach of any cloudbrimmed over
in a deluge and for three days it rained without remission The islet
was a sponge the castaways sops the view all gone even the reef
concealed behind the curtain of the falling water The fire was soon
drowned out after a couple of boxes of matches had been scratched in
vain it was decided to wait for better weather and the party lived in
wretchedness on raw tins and a ration of hard bread

By the 2nd February in the dark hours of the morning watch the clouds
were all blown by the sun rose glorious and once more the castaways
sat by a quick fire and drank hot coffee with the greed of brutes and
sufferers Thenceforward their affairs moved in a routine A fire was
constantly maintained and this occupied one hand continuously and the
others for an hour or so in the day Twice a day all hands bathed in
the lagoon their chief almost their only pleasure Often they fished
in the lagoon with good success And the rest was passed in lolling
strolling yarns and disputation The time of the China steamers
was calculated to a nicety which done the thought was rejected and
ignored It was one that would not bear consideration The boat voyage
having been tacitly set aside the desperate part chosen to wait there
for the coming of help or of starvation no man had courage left to look
his bargain in the face far less to discuss it with his neighbours But
the unuttered terror haunted them in every hour of idleness at every
moment of silence it returned and breathed a chill about the circle
and carried mens eyes to the horizon Then in a panic of selfdefence
they would rally to some other subject And in that lone spot what
else was to be found to speak of but the treasure

That was indeed the chief singularity the one thing conspicuous in
their island life the presence of that chest of bills and specie
dominated the mind like a cathedral and there were besides connected
with it certain irking problems well fitted to occupy the idle Two
thousand pounds were due to the Sydney firm two thousand pounds were
clear profit and fell to be divided in varying proportions among
six It had been agreed how the partners were to range every pound of
capital subscribed every pound that fell due in wages was to count for
one lay Of these Tommy could claim five hundred and ten Carthew one
hundred and seventy Wicks one hundred and forty and Hemstead and Amalu
ten apiece eight hundred and forty lays in all What was the value of
a lay This was at first debated in the air and chiefly by the strength
of Tommys lungs Then followed a series of incorrect calculations from
which they issued arithmetically foiled but agreed from weariness upon
an approximate value of 2 pounds 7 shillings 7 14 pence The figures
were admittedly incorrect the sum of the shares came not to 2000
pounds but to 1996 pounds 6 shillings 3 pounds 14 shillings being
thus left unclaimed But it was the nearest they had yet found and the
highest as well so that the partners were made the less critical by the
contemplation of their splendid dividends Wicks put in 100 pounds and
stood to draw captains wages for two months his taking was 333 pounds
3 shillings 6 12 pence Carthew had put in 150 pounds he was to take
out 401 pounds 18 shillings 6 12 pence Tommys 500 pounds had grown
to be 1213 pounds 12 shillings 9 34 pence and Amalu and Hemstead
ranking for wages only had 22 pounds 16 shillings 12 pence each

From talking and brooding on these figures it was but a step to
opening the chest and once the chest open the glamour of the cash was
irresistible Each felt that he must see his treasure separate with the
eye of flesh handle it in the hard coin mark it for his own and
stand forth to himself the approved owner And here an insurmountable
difficulty barred the way There were some seventeen shillings in
English silver the rest was Chile and the Chile dollar which had been
taken at the rate of six to the pound sterling was practically their
smallest coin It was decided therefore to divide the pounds only
and to throw the shillings pence and fractions in a common fund This
with the three pound fourteen already in the heel made a total of seven
pounds one shilling

Ill tell you said Wicks Let Carthew and Tommy and me take one
pound apiece and Hemstead and Amalu split the other four and toss up
for the odd bob

O rot said Carthew Tommy and I are bursting already We can take
half a sov each and let the other three have forty shillings

Ill tell you nowits not worth splitting broke in Mac Ive cards
in my chest Why dont you play for the slump sum

In that idle place the proposal was accepted with delight Mac as the
owner of the cards was given a stake the sum was played for in five
games of cribbage and when Amalu the last survivor in the tournament
was beaten by Mac it was found the dinner hour was past After a hasty
meal they fell again immediately to cards this time on Carthews
proposal to Van John It was then probably two PM of the 9th
February and they played with varying chances for twelve hours slept
heavily and rose late on the morrow to resume the game All day of the
10th with grudging intervals for food and with one long absence on the
part of Tommy from which he returned dripping with the case of sherry
they continued to deal and stake Night fell they drew the closer to
the fire It was maybe two in the morning and Tommy was selling his
deal by auction as usual with that timid player when Carthew who
didnt intend to bid had a moment of leisure and looked round him He
beheld the moonlight on the sea the money piled and scattered in that
incongruous place the perturbed faces of the players he felt in his
own breast the familiar tumult and it seemed as if there rose in his
ears a sound of music and the moon seemed still to shine upon a sea
but the sea was changed and the Casino towered from among lamplit
gardens and the money clinked on the green board Good God he
thought am I gambling again He looked the more curiously about the
sandy table He and Mac had played and won like gamblers the mingled
gold and silver lay by their places in the heap Amalu and Hemstead had
each more than held their own but Tommy was cruel far to leeward and
the captain was reduced to perhaps fifty pounds

I say lets knock off said Carthew

Give that man a glass of Buckle said some one and a fresh bottle was
opened and the game went inexorably on

Carthew was himself too heavy a winner to withdraw or to say more and
all the rest of the night he must look on at the progress of this folly
and make gallant attempts to lose with the not uncommon consequence of
winning more The first dawn of the 11th February found him wellnigh
desperate It chanced he was then dealer and still winning He had just
dealt a round of many tens every one had staked heavily the captain
had put up all that remained to him twelve pounds in gold and a few
dollars and Carthew looking privately at his cards before he showed
them found he held a natural

See here you fellows he broke out this is a sickening business
and Im done with it for one So saying he showed his cards tore them
across and rose from the ground

The company stared and murmured in mere amazement but Mac stepped
gallantly to his support

Weve had enough of it I do believe said he But of course it was
all fun and heres my counters back All counters in boys and he
began to pour his winnings into the chest which stood fortunately near
him

Carthew stepped across and wrung him by the hand Ill never forget
this he said

And what are ye going to do with the Highway boy and the plumber
inquired Mac in a low tone of voice Theyve both wan ye see

Thats true said Carthew aloud Amalu and Hemstead count your
winnings Tommy and I pay that

It was carried without speech the pair glad enough to receive their
winnings it mattered not from whence and Tommy who had lost about
five hundred pounds delighted with the compromise

And how about Mac asked Hemstead Is he to lose all

I beg your pardon plumber Im sure ye mean well returned the
Irishman but youd better shut your face for Im not that kind of a
man If I tought I had wan that money fair theres never a soul here
could get it from me But I tought it was in fun that was my mistake
ye see and theres no man big enough upon this island to give a present
to my mothers son So theres my opinion to ye plumber and you can
put it in your pockut till required


Well I will say Mac youre a gentleman said Carthew as he helped
him to shovel back his winnings into the treasure chest

Divil a fear of it sir a drunken sailorman said Mac

The captain had sat somewhile with his face in his hands now he rose
mechanically shaking and stumbling like a drunkard after a debauch But
as he rose his face was altered and his voice rang out over the isle
Sail ho

All turned at the cry and there in the wild light of the morning
heading straight for Midway Reef was the brig Flying Scud of Hull




CHAPTER XXIV A HARD BARGAIN


The ship which thus appeared before the castaways had long tramped the
ocean wandering from one port to another as freights offered She was
two years out from London by the Cape of Good Hope India and the
Archipelago and was now bound for San Francisco in the hope of working
homeward round the Horn Her captain was one Jacob Trent He had retired
some five years before to a suburban cottage a patch of cabbages a
gig and the conduct of what he called a Bank The name appears to have
been misleading Borrowers were accustomed to choose works of art and
utility in the front shop loaves of sugar and bolts of broadcloth were
deposited in pledge and it was a part of the managers duty to dash in
his gig on Saturday evenings from one small retailers to another and
to annex in each the bulk of the weeks takings His was thus an active
life and to a man of the type of a rat filled with recondite joys
An unexpected loss a law suit and the unintelligent commentary of the
judge upon the bench combined to disgust him of the business I was so
extraordinarily fortunate as to find in an old newspaper a report of
the proceedings in Lyall v The Cardiff Mutual Accommodation Banking Co
I confess I fail entirely to understand the nature of the business
the judge had remarked while Trent was being examined in chief a
little after on fuller informationThey call it a bank he had
opined but it seems to me to be an unlicensed pawnshop and he wound
up with this appalling allocution Mr Trent I must put you on your
guard you must be very careful or we shall see you here again In the
inside of a week the captain disposed of the bank the cottage and the
gig and horse and to sea again in the Flying Scud where he did well
and gave high satisfaction to his owners But the glory clung to him he
was a plain sailorman he said but he could never long allow you to
forget that he had been a banker

His mate Elias Goddedaal was a huge viking of a man six feet three
and of proportionate mass strong sober industrious musical and
sentimental He ran continually over into Swedish melodies chiefly in
the minor He had paid nine dollars to hear Patti to hear Nilsson he
had deserted a ship and two months wages and he was ready at any time
to walk ten miles for a good concert or seven to a reasonable play
On board he had three treasures a canary bird a concertina and a
blinding copy of the works of Shakespeare He had a gift peculiarly
Scandinavian of making friends at sight an elemental innocence
commended him he was without fear without reproach and without money
or the hope of making it

Holdorsen was second mate and berthed aft but messed usually with the
hands

Of one more of the crew some image lives This was a foremast hand out
of the Clyde of the name of Brown A small dark thickset creature
with dogs eyes of a disposition incomparably mild and harmless he
knocked about seas and cities the uncomplaining whiptop of one vice
The drink is my trouble ye see he said to Carthew shyly and its
the more shame to me because Im come of very good people at Bowling
down the waer The letter that so much affected Nares in case the
reader should remember it was addressed to this man Brown

Such was the ship that now carried joy into the bosoms of the castaways
After the fatigue and the bestial emotions of their night of play the
approach of salvation shook them from all selfcontrol Their hands
trembled their eyes shone they laughed and shouted like children as
they cleared their camp and some one beginning to whistle _Marching
Through Georgia_ the remainder of the packing was conducted amidst a
thousand interruptions to these martial strains But the strong head of
Wicks was only partly turned


Boys he said easy all Were going aboard of a ship of which we
dont know nothing weve got a chest of specie and seeing the weight
we cant turn to and deny it Now suppose she was fishy suppose it was
some kind of a Bully Hayes business Its my opinion wed better be on
hand with the pistols

Every man of the party but Hemstead had some kind of a revolver these
were accordingly loaded and disposed about the persons of the castaways
and the packing was resumed and finished in the same rapturous spirit as
it was begun The sun was not yet ten degrees above the eastern sea but
the brig was already close in and hove to before they had launched the
boat and sped shouting at the oars towards the passage

It was blowing fresh outside with a strong send of sea The spray flew
in the oarsmens faces They saw the Union Jack blow abroad from the
Flying Scud the men clustered at the rail the cook in the galley door
the captain on the quarterdeck with a pith helmet and binoculars And
the whole familiar business the comfort company and safety of a ship
heaving nearer at each stroke maddened them with joy

Wicks was the first to catch the line and swarm on board helping hands
grabbing him as he came and hauling him across the rail

Captain sir I suppose he said turning to the hard old man in the
pith helmet

Captain Trent sir returned the old gentleman

Well Im Captain Kirkup and this is the crew of the Sydney schooner
Currency Lass dismasted at sea January 28th

Ay ay said Trent Well youre all right now Lucky for you I saw
your signal I didnt know I was so near this beastly island there must
be a drift to the southard here and when I came on deck this morning
at eight bells I thought it was a ship afire

It had been agreed that while Wicks was to board the ship and do the
civil the rest were to remain in the whaleboat and see the treasure
safe A tackle was passed down to them to this they made fast the
invaluable chest and gave the word to heave But the unexpected weight
brought the hand at the tackle to a stand two others ran to tail on and
help him and the thing caught the eye of Trent

Vast heaving he cried sharply and then to Wicks Whats that I
dont ever remember to have seen a chest weigh like that

Its money said Wicks

Its what cried Trent

Specie said Wicks saved from the wreck

Trent looked at him sharply Here let go that chest again Mr
Goddedaal he commanded shove the boat off and stream her with a
line astern

Ay ay sir from Goddedaal

What the devils wrong asked Wicks

Nothing I daresay returned Trent But youll allow its a queer
thing when a boat turns up in midocean with half a ton of specieand
everybody armed he added pointing to Wickss pocket Your boat
will lay comfortably astern while you come below and make yourself
satisfactory

O if thats all said Wicks My log and papers are as right as the
mail nothing fishy about us And he hailed his friends in the boat
bidding them have patience and turned to follow Captain Trent

This way Captain Kirkup said the latter And dont blame a man for
too much caution no offence intended and these China rivers shake a
fellows nerve All I want is just to see youre what you say you
are its only my duty sir and what you would do yourself in the
circumstances Ive not always been a shipcaptain I was a banker once
and I tell you thats the trade to learn caution in You have to keep
your weathereye lifting Saturday nights And with a dry businesslike
cordiality he produced a bottle of gin

The captains pledged each other the papers were overhauled the tale of
Topelius and the trade was told in appreciative ears and cemented
their acquaintance Trents suspicions thus finally disposed of were
succeeded by a fit of profound thought during which he sat lethargic
and stern looking at and drumming on the table

Anything more asked Wicks

What sort of a place is it inside inquired Trent sudden as though
Wicks had touched a spring

Its a good enough lagoona few horses heads but nothing to
mention answered Wicks

Ive a good mind to go in said Trent I was new rigged in China
its given very bad and Im getting frightened for my sticks We could
set it up as good as new in a day For I daresay your lot would turn to
and give us a hand

You see if we dont said Wicks

So be it then concluded Trent A stitch in time saves nine

They returned on deck Wicks cried the news to the Currency Lasses the
foretopsail was filled again and the brig ran into the lagoon lively
the whaleboat dancing in her wake and came to single anchor off Middle
Brooks Island before eight She was boarded by the castaways breakfast
was served the baggage slung on board and piled in the waist and all
hands turned to upon the rigging All day the work continued the two
crews rivalling each other in expense of strength Dinner was served on
deck the officers messing aft under the slack of the spanker the men
fraternising forward Trent appeared in excellent spirits served out
grog to all hands opened a bottle of Cape wine for the aftertable
and obliged his guests with many details of the life of a financier
in Cardiff He had been forty years at sea had five times suffered
shipwreck was once nine months the prisoner of a pepper rajah and had
seen service under fire in Chinese rivers but the only thing he cared
to talk of the only thing of which he was vain or with which he
thought it possible to interest a stranger was his career as a
moneylender in the slums of a seaport town

The afternoon spell told cruelly on the Currency Lasses Already
exhausted as they were with sleeplessness and excitement they did the
last hours of this violent employment on bare nerves and when Trent was
at last satisfied with the condition of his rigging expected eagerly
the word to put to sea But the captain seemed in no hurry He went and
walked by himself softly like a man in thought Presently he hailed
Wicks

Youre a kind of company aint you Captain Kirkup he inquired

Yes were all on board on lays was the reply

Well then you wont mind if I ask the lot of you down to tea in the
cabin asked Trent

Wicks was amazed but he naturally ventured no remark and a little
after the six Currency Lasses sat down with Trent and Goddedaal to
a spread of marmalade butter toast sardines tinned tongue and
steaming tea The food was not very good and I have no doubt Nares
would have reviled it but it was manna to the castaways Goddedaal
waited on them with a kindness far before courtesy a kindness like
that of some old honest countrywoman in her farm It was remembered
afterwards that Trent took little share in these attentions but sat
much absorbed in thought and seemed to remember and forget the presence
of his guests alternately

Presently he addressed the Chinaman

Clear out said he and watched him till he had disappeared in the
stair Now gentlemen he went on I understand youre a jointstock
sort of crew and thats why Ive had you all down for theres a point
I want made clear You see what sort of a ship this isa good ship
though I say it and you see what the rations aregood enough for
sailormen

There was a hurried murmur of approval but curiosity for what was
coming next prevented an articulate reply

Well continued Trent making bread pills and looking hard at the
middle of the table Im glad of course to be able to give you a
passage to Frisco one sailorman should help another thats my motto
But when you want a thing in this world you generally always have
to pay for it He laughed a brief joyless laugh I have no idea of
losing by my kindness

We have no idea you should captain said Wicks

We are ready to pay anything in reason added Carthew


At the words Goddedaal who sat next to him touched him with his
elbow and the two mates exchanged a significant look The character of
Captain Trent was given and taken in that silent second

In reason repeated the captain of the brig I was waiting for that
Reasons between two people and theres only one here Im the judge
Im reason If you want an advance you have to pay for ithe hastily
corrected himselfIf you want a passage in my ship you have to pay my
price he substituted Thats business I believe I dont want you
you want me

Well sir said Carthew and what IS your price

The captain made bread pills If I were like you he said when you
got hold of that merchant in the Gilberts I might surprise you You
had your chance then seems to me its mine now Turn abouts fair play
What kind of mercy did you have on that Gilbert merchant he cried
with a sudden stridency Not that I blame you Alls fair in love and
business and he laughed again a little frosty giggle

Well sir said Carthew gravely

Well this ships mine I think he asked sharply

Well Im of that way of thinking meself observed Mac

I say its mine sir reiterated Trent like a man trying to be angry
And I tell you all if I was a driver like what you are I would take
the lot But theres two thousand pounds there that dont belong to you
and Im an honest man Give me the two thousand thats yours and Ill
give you a passage to the coast and land every manjack of you in
Frisco with fifteen pounds in his pocket and the captain here with
twentyfive

Goddedaal laid down his head on the table like a man ashamed

Youre joking said Wicks purple in the face

Am I said Trent Please yourselves Youre under no compulsion This
ships mine but theres that Brooks Island dont belong to me and you
can lay there till you die for what I care


Its more than your blooming brigs worth cried Wicks

Its my price anyway returned Trent

And do you mean to say you would land us there to starve cried Tommy

Captain Trent laughed the third time Starve I defy you to said he
Ill sell you all the provisions you want at a fair profit

I beg your pardon sir said Mac but my case is by itself Im
working me passage I got no share in that two thousand pounds nor
nothing in my pockut and Ill be glad to know what you have to say to
me

I aint a hard man said Trent That shall make no difference Ill
take you with the rest only of course you get no fifteen pound

The impudence was so extreme and startling that all breathed deep and
Goddedaal raised up his face and looked his superior sternly in the eye

But Mac was more articulate And youre what ye call a British sayman
I suppose the sorrow in your guts he cried

One more such word and I clap you in irons said Trent rising
gleefully at the face of opposition

And where would I be the while you were doin ut asked Mac After
you and your rigging too Ye ould puggy ye havent the civility of a
bug and Ill learn ye some

His voice did not even rise as he uttered the threat no man present
Trent least of all expected that which followed The Irishmans hand
rose suddenly from below the table an open claspknife balanced on the
palm there was a movement swift as conjuring Trent started half to
his feet turning a little as he rose so as to escape the table and the
movement was his bane The missile struck him in the jugular he fell
forward and his blood flowed among the dishes on the cloth

The suddenness of the attack and the catastrophe the instant change
from peace to war and from life to death held all men spellbound Yet a
moment they sat about the table staring openmouthed upon the prostrate
captain and the flowing blood The next Goddedaal had leaped to his
feet caught up the stool on which he had been sitting and swung it
high in air a man transfigured roaring as he stood so that mens
ears were stunned with it There was no thought of battle in the
Currency Lasses none drew his weapon all huddled helplessly from
before the face of the baresark Scandinavian His first blow sent Mac to
ground with a broken arm His second bashed out the brains of Hemstead
He turned from one to another menacing and trumpeting like a wounded
elephant exulting in his rage But there was no counsel no light of
reason in that ecstasy of battle and he shied from the pursuit of
victory to hail fresh blows upon the supine Hemstead so that the stool
was shattered and the cabin rang with their violence The sight of that
postmortem cruelty recalled Carthew to the life of instinct and his
revolver was in hand and he had aimed and fired before he knew The
earbursting sound of the report was accompanied by a yell of pain the
colossus paused swayed tottered and fell headlong on the body of his
victim

In the instant silence that succeeded the sound of feet pounding on the
deck and in the companion leaped into hearing and a face that of the
sailor Holdorsen appeared below the bulkheads in the cabin doorway
Carthew shattered it with a second shot for he was a marksman

Pistols he cried and charged at the companion Wicks at his heels
Tommy and Amalu following They trod the body of Holdorsen underfoot
and flew upstairs and forth into the dusky blaze of a sunset red as
blood The numbers were still equal but the Flying Scuds dreamed not of
defence and fled with one accord for the forecastle scuttle Brown was
first in flight he disappeared below unscathed the Chinaman followed
headforemost with a ball in his side and the others shinned into the
rigging

A fierce composure settled upon Wicks and Carthew their fighting second
wind They posted Tommy at the fore and Amalu at the main to guard the
masts and shrouds and going themselves into the waist poured out a
box of cartridges on deck and filled the chambers The poor devils aloft
bleated aloud for mercy But the hour of any mercy was gone by the cup
was brewed and must be drunken to the dregs since so many had fallen
all must fall The light was bad the cheap revolvers fouled and carried
wild the screaming wretches were swift to flatten themselves against
the masts and yards or find a momentary refuge in the hanging sails The
fell business took long but it was done at last Hardy the Londoner was
shot on the foreroyal yard and hung horribly suspended in the brails
Wallen the other had his jaw broken on the maintopgallant crosstrees
and exposed himself shrieking till a second shot dropped him on the
deck

This had been bad enough but worse remained behind There was still
Brown in the forepeak Tommy with a sudden clamour of weeping begged
for his life One man cant hurt us he sobbed We cant go on with
this I spoke to him at dinner Hes an awful decent little cad It
cant be done Nobody can go into that place and murder him Its too
damned wicked

The sound of his supplications was perhaps audible to the unfortunate
below

One left and we all hang said Wicks Brown must go the same road
The big man was deadly white and trembled like an aspen and he had no
sooner finished speaking than he went to the ships side and vomited

We can never do it if we wait said Carthew Now or never and he
marched towards the scuttle

No no no wailed Tommy clutching at his jacket

But Carthew flung him off and stepped down the ladder his heart rising
with disgust and shame The Chinaman lay on the floor still groaning
the place was pitch dark

Brown cried Carthew Brown where are you

His heart smote him for the treacherous apostrophe but no answer came

He groped in the bunks they were all empty Then he moved towards the
forepeak which was hampered with coils of rope and spare chandlery in
general

Brown he said again

Here sir answered a shaking voice and the poor invisible caitiff
called on him by name and poured forth out of the darkness an endless
garrulous appeal for mercy A sense of danger of daring had alone
nerved Carthew to enter the forecastle and here was the enemy crying
and pleading like a frightened child His obsequious Here sir his
horrid fluency of obtestation made the murder tenfold more revolting
Twice Carthew raised the pistol once he pressed the trigger or thought
he did with all his might but no explosion followed and with that the
lees of his courage ran quite out and he turned and fled from before
his victim

Wicks sat on the fore hatch raised the face of a man of seventy and
looked a wordless question Carthew shook his head With such composure
as a man displays marching towards the gallows Wicks arose walked to
the scuttle and went down Brown thought it was Carthew returning
and discovered himself half crawling from his shelter with another
incoherent burst of pleading Wicks emptied his revolver at the voice
which broke into mouselike whimperings and groans Silence succeeded
and the murderer ran on deck like one possessed

The other three were now all gathered on the fore hatch and Wicks
took his place beside them without question asked or answered They
sat close like children in the dark and shook each other with their
shaking The dusk continued to fall and there was no sound but the
beating of the surf and the occasional hiccup of a sob from Tommy
Hadden

God if there was another ship cried Carthew of a sudden

Wicks started and looked aloft with the trick of all seamen and
shuddered as he saw the hanging figure on the royal yard

If I went aloft Id fall he said simply Im done up

It was Amalu who volunteered climbed to the very truck swept the
fading horizon and announced nothing within sight

No odds said Wicks We cant sleep 

Sleep echoed Carthew and it seemed as if the whole of Shakespeares
_Macbeth_ thundered at the gallop through his mind

Well then we cant sit and chitter here said Wicks till weve
cleaned ship and I cant turn to till Ive had gin and the gins in
the cabin and whos to fetch it


I will said Carthew if any one has matches

Amalu passed him a box and he went aft and down the companion and into
the cabin stumbling upon bodies Then he struck a match and his looks
fell upon two living eyes

Well asked Mac for it was he who still survived in that shambles of
a cabin

Its done theyre all dead answered Carthew

Christ said the Irishman and fainted

The gin was found in the dead captains cabin it was brought on deck
and all hands had a dram and attacked their farther task The night
was come the moon would not be up for hours a lamp was set on the main
hatch to light Amalu as he washed down decks and the galley lantern
was taken to guide the others in their graveyard business Holdorsen
Hemstead Trent and Goddedaal were first disposed of the last still
breathing as he went over the side Wallen followed and then Wicks
steadied by the gin went aloft with a boathook and succeeded in
dislodging Hardy The Chinaman was their last task he seemed to be
lightheaded talked aloud in his unknown language as they brought
him up and it was only with the splash of his sinking body that the
gibberish ceased Brown by common consent was left alone Flesh and
blood could go no further

All this time they had been drinking undiluted gin like water three
bottles stood broached in different quarters and none passed without
a gulp Tommy collapsed against the mainmast Wicks fell on his face
on the poop ladder and moved no more Amalu had vanished unobserved
Carthew was the last afoot he stood swaying at the break of the poop
and the lantern which he still carried swung with his movement His
head hummed it swarmed with broken thoughts memory of that days
abominations flared up and died down within him like the light of a lamp
in a strong draught And then he had a drunkards inspiration

There must be no more of this he thought and stumbled once more
below

The absence of Holdorsens body brought him to a stand He stood and
stared at the empty floor and then remembered and smiled From the
captains room he took the open case with one dozen and three bottles of
gin put the lantern inside and walked precariously forth Mac was once
more conscious his eyes haggard his face drawn with pain and flushed
with fever and Carthew remembered he had never been seen to had lain
there helpless and was so to lie all night injured perhaps dying
But it was now too late reason had now fled from that silent ship If
Carthew could get on deck again it was as much as he could hope
and casting on the unfortunate a glance of pity the tragic drunkard
shouldered his way up the companion dropped the case overboard and
fell in the scuppers helpless




CHAPTER XXV A BAD BARGAIN


With the first colour in the east Carthew awoke and sat up A while he
gazed at the scroll of the morning bank and the spars and hanging canvas
of the brig like a man who wakes in a strange bed with a childs
simplicity of wonder He wondered above all what ailed him what he had
lost what disfavour had been done him which he knew he should resent
yet had forgotten And then like a river bursting through a dam the
truth rolled on him its instantaneous volume his memory teemed with
speech and pictures that he should never again forget and he sprang to
his feet stood a moment hand to brow and began to walk violently
to and fro by the companion As he walked he wrung his hands
GodGodGod he kept saying with no thought of prayer uttering a
mere voice of agony

The time may have been long or short it was perhaps minutes perhaps
only seconds ere he awoke to find himself observed and saw the captain
sitting up and watching him over the break of the poop a strange
blindness as of fever in his eyes a haggard knot of corrugations on his
brow Cain saw himself in a mirror For a flash they looked upon each
other and then glanced guiltily aside and Carthew fled from the eye of
his accomplice and stood leaning on the taffrail

An hour went by while the day came brighter and the sun rose and drank
up the clouds an hour of silence in the ship an hour of agony beyond
narration for the sufferers Browns gabbling prayers the cries of the
sailors in the rigging strains of the dead Hemsteads minstrelsy
ran together in Carthews mind with sickening iteration He neither
acquitted nor condemned himself he did not think he suffered In
the bright water into which he stared the pictures changed and were
repeated the baresark rage of Goddedaal the bloodred light of the
sunset into which they had run forth the face of the babbling Chinaman
as they cast him over the face of the captain seen a moment since
as he awoke from drunkenness into remorse And time passed and the sun
swam higher and his torment was not abated

Then were fulfilled many sayings and the weakest of these condemned
brought relief and healing to the others Amalu the drudge awoke like
the rest to sickness of body and distress of mind but the habit of
obedience ruled in that simple spirit and appalled to be so late
he went direct into the galley kindled the fire and began to get
breakfast At the rattle of dishes the snapping of the fire and the
thin smoke that went up straight into the air the spell was lifted
The condemned felt once more the good dry land of habit under foot they
touched again the familiar guideropes of sanity they were restored to
a sense of the blessed revolution and return of all things earthly The
captain drew a bucket of water and began to bathe Tommy sat up watched
him awhile and slowly followed his example and Carthew remembering
his last thoughts of the night before hastened to the cabin

Mac was awake perhaps had not slept Over his head Goddedaals canary
twittered shrilly from its cage

How are you asked Carthew

Me arrums broke returned Mac but I can stand that Its this place
I cant abide I was coming on deck anyway

Stay where you are though said Carthew Its deadly hot above and
theres no wind Ill wash out this and he paused seeking a word
and not finding one for the grisly foulness of the cabin

Faith Ill be obliged to ye then replied the Irishman He spoke
mild and meek like a sick child with its mother There was now no
violence in the violent man and as Carthew fetched a bucket and swab
and the stewards sponge and began to cleanse the field of battle
he alternately watched him or shut his eyes and sighed like a man near
fainting I have to ask all your pardons he began again presently
and the more shame to me as I got ye into trouble and couldnt do
nothing when it came Ye saved me life sir yere a clane shot

For Gods sake dont talk of it cried Carthew It cant be talked
of you dont know what it was It was nothing down here they fought
On deckO my God And Carthew with the bloody sponge pressed to his
face struggled a moment with hysteria

Kape cool Mr Cartew Its done now said Mac and ye may bless God
yere not in pain and helpless in the bargain

There was no more said by one or other and the cabin was pretty well
cleansed when a stroke on the ships bell summoned Carthew to breakfast
Tommy had been busy in the meanwhile he had hauled the whaleboat close
aboard and already lowered into it a small keg of beef that he found
ready broached beside the galley door it was plain he had but the one
ideato escape

We have a shipful of stores to draw upon he said Well what are
we staying for Lets get off at once for Hawaii Ive begun preparing
already

Mac has his arm broken observed Carthew how would he stand the
voyage

A broken arm repeated the captain That all Ill set it after
breakfast I thought he was dead like the rest That madman hit out
like and there at the evocation of the battle his voice ceased
and the talk died with it

After breakfast the three white men went down into the cabin

Ive come to set your arm said the captain

I beg your pardon captain replied Mac but the firrst thing ye got
to do is to get this ship to sea Well talk of me arrum after that

O theres no such blooming hurry returned Wicks

When the next ship sails in yell tell me stories retorted Mac

But theres nothing so unlikely in the world objected Carthew

Dont be deceivin yourself said Mac If ye want a ship divil a
onell look near ye in six year but if ye dont ye may take my word
for ut well have a squadron layin here

Thats what I say cried Tommy thats what I call sense Lets stock
that whaleboat and be off

And what will Captain Wicks be thinking of the whaleboat asked the
Irishman

I dont think of it at all said Wicks Weve a smartlooking brig
under foot thats all the whaleboat I want

Excuse me cried Tommy Thats childish talk Youve got a brig to
be sure and what use is she You darent go anywhere in her What port
are you to sail for

For the port of Davy Joness Locker my son replied the captain
This brigs going to be lost at sea Ill tell you where too and
thats about forty miles to windward of Kauai Were going to stay by
her till shes down and once the masts are under shes the Flying Scud
no more and we never heard of such a brig and its the crew of the
schooner Currency Lass that comes ashore in the boat and takes the
first chance to Sydney

Captain dear thats the first Christian word Ive heard of ut cried
Mac And now just let me arrum be jewel and get the brig outside

Im as anxious as yourself Mac returned Wicks but theres not wind
enough to swear by So lets see your arm and no more talk

The arm was set and splinted the body of Brown fetched from the
forepeak where it lay still and cold and committed to the waters of
the lagoon and the washing of the cabin rudely finished All these were
done ere midday and it was past three when the first catspaw ruffled
the lagoon and the wind came in a dry squall which presently sobered
to a steady breeze

The interval was passed by all in feverish impatience and by one of
the party in secret and extreme concern of mind Captain Wicks was a
foreandaft sailor he could take a schooner through a Scotch reel
felt her mouth and divined her temper like a rider with a horse she
on her side recognising her master and following his wishes like a dog
But by a not very unusual train of circumstance the mans dexterity was
partial and circumscribed On a schooners deck he was Rembrandt or at
the least Mr Whistler on board a brig he was Pierre Grassou Again
and again in the course of the morning he had reasoned out his
policy and rehearsed his orders and ever with the same depression and
weariness It was guesswork it was chance the ship might behave as
he expected and might not suppose she failed him he stood there
helpless beggared of all the proved resources of experience Had
not all hands been so weary had he not feared to communicate his own
misgivings he could have towed her out But these reasons sufficed and
the most he could do was to take all possible precautions Accordingly
he had Carthew aft explained what was to be done with anxious patience
and visited along with him the various sheets and braces

I hope Ill remember said Carthew It seems awfully muddled

Its the rottenest kind of rig the captain admitted all blooming
pocket handkerchiefs And not one sailorman on deck Ah if shed only
been a brigantine now But its lucky the passage is so plain theres
no manoeuvring to mention We get under way before the wind and run
right so till we begin to get foul of the island then we haul our wind
and lie as near southeast as may be till were on that line bout ship
there and stand straight out on the port tack Catch the idea

Yes I see the idea replied Carthew rather dismally and the two
incompetents studied for a long time in silence the complicated gear
above their heads

But the time came when these rehearsals must be put in practice The
sails were lowered and all hands heaved the anchor short The whaleboat
was then cut adrift the upper topsails and the spanker set the yards
braced up and the spanker sheet hauled out to starboard

Heave away on your anchor Mr Carthew

Anchors gone sir

Set jibs

It was done and the brig still hung enchanted Wicks his head full of
a schooners mainsail turned his mind to the spanker First he hauled
in the sheet and then he hauled it out with no result

Brail the damned thing up he bawled at last with a red face There
aint no sense in it

It was the last stroke of bewilderment for the poor captain that he had
no sooner brailed up the spanker than the vessel came before the wind
The laws of nature seemed to him to be suspended he was like a man in
a world of pantomime tricks the cause of any result and the probable
result of any action equally concealed from him He was the more
careful not to shake the nerve of his amateur assistants He stood
there with a face like a torch but he gave his orders with aplomb and
indeed now the ship was under weigh supposed his difficulties over

The lower topsails and courses were then set and the brig began to
walk the water like a thing of life her forefoot discoursing music the
birds flying and crying over her spars Bit by bit the passage began to
open and the blue sea to show between the flanking breakers on the reef
bit by bit on the starboard bow the low land of the islet began to
heave closer aboard The yards were braced up the spanker sheet hauled
aft again the brig was close hauled lay down to her work like a thing
in earnest and had soon drawn near to the point of advantage where she
might stay and lie out of the lagoon in a single tack

Wicks took the wheel himself swelling with success He kept the brig
full to give her heels and began to bark his orders Ready about
Helms alee Tacks and sheets Mainsail haul And then the fatal
words Thatll do your mainsail jump forrard and haul round your
foreyards

To stay a squarerigged ship is an affair of knowledge and swift sight
and a man used to the succinct evolutions of a schooner will always tend
to be too hasty with a brig It was so now The order came too soon the
topsails set flat aback the ship was in irons Even yet had the helm
been reversed they might have saved her But to think of a sternboard
at all far more to think of profiting by one were foreign to the
schoonersailors mind Wicks made haste instead to wear ship a
manoeuvre for which room was wanting and the Flying Scud took ground on
a bank of sand and coral about twenty minutes before five

Wicks was no hand with a squarerigger and he had shown it But he
was a sailor and a born captain of men for all homely purposes where
intellect is not required and an eye in a mans head and a heart under
his jacket will suffice Before the others had time to understand the
misfortune he was bawling fresh orders and had the sails clewed up
and took soundings round the ship

She lies lovely he remarked and ordered out a boat with the
starboard anchor

Here steady cried Tommy You aint going to turn us to to warp her
off

I am though replied Wicks

I wont set a hand to such tomfoolery for one replied Tommy Im
dead beat He went and sat down doggedly on the main hatch You got us
on get us off again he added

Carthew and Wicks turned to each other

Perhaps you dont know how tired we are said Carthew

The tides flowing cried the captain You wouldnt have me miss a
rising tide

O gammon theres tides tomorrow retorted Tommy

And Ill tell you what added Carthew the breeze is failing fast
and the sun will soon be down We may get into all kinds of fresh mess
in the dark and with nothing but light airs

I dont deny it answered Wicks and stood awhile as if in thought
But what I cant make out he began again with agitation what I
cant make out is what youre made of To stay in this place is beyond
me Theres the bloody sun going downand to stay here is beyond me

The others looked upon him with horrified surprise This fall of their
chief pillarthis irrational passion in the practical man suddenly
barred out of his true sphere the sphere of actionshocked and daunted
them But it gave to another and unseen hearer the chance for which he
had been waiting Mac on the striking of the brig had crawled up the
companion and he now showed himself and spoke up

Captain Wicks said he its me that brought this trouble on the lot
of ye Im sorry for ut I ask all your pardons and if theres any one
can say I forgive ye itll make my soul the lighter

Wicks stared upon the man in amaze then his selfcontrol returned to
him Were all in glass houses here he said we aint going to turn
to and throw stones I forgive you sure enough and much good may it do
you

The others spoke to the same purpose

I thank ye for ut and tis done like gentlemen said Mac But
theres another thing I have upon my mind I hope were all Prodestans
here

It appeared they were it seemed a small thing for the Protestant
religion to rejoice in

Well thats as it should be continued Mac And why shouldnt we say
the Lords Prayer There cant be no hurt in ut

He had the same quiet pleading childlike way with him as in the
morning and the others accepted his proposal and knelt down without a
word

Knale if ye like said he Ill stand And he covered his eyes

So the prayer was said to the accompaniment of the surf and seabirds
and all rose refreshed and felt lightened of a load Up to then they
had cherished their guilty memories in private or only referred to
them in the heat of a moment and fallen immediately silent Now they had
faced their remorse in company and the worst seemed over Nor was it
only that But the petition Forgive us our trespasses falling in
so apposite after they had themselves forgiven the immediate author of
their miseries sounded like an absolution

Tea was taken on deck in the time of the sunset and not long after the
five castawayscastaways once morelay down to sleep

Day dawned windless and hot Their slumbers had been too profound to be
refreshing and they woke listless and sat up and stared about them
with dull eyes Only Wicks smelling a hard days work ahead was more
alert He went first to the well sounded it once and then a second
time and stood awhile with a grim look so that all could see he was
dissatisfied Then he shook himself stripped to the buff clambered on
the rail drew himself up and raised his arms to plunge The dive was
never taken He stood instead transfixed his eyes on the horizon

Hand up that glass he said

In a trice they were all swarming aloft the nude captain leading with
the glass

On the northern horizon was a finger of grey smoke straight in the
windless air like a point of admiration

What do you make it they asked of Wicks

Shes truck down he replied no telling yet By the way the smoke
builds she must be heading right here

What can she be

She might be a China mail returned Wicks and she might be a
blooming manofwar come to look for castaways Here This aint the
time to stand staring On deck boys

He was the first on deck as he had been the first aloft handed down
the ensign bent it again to the signal halliards and ran it up union
down

Now hear me he said jumping into his trousers and everything I say
you grip on to If thats a manofwar shell be in a tearing hurry
all these ships are what dont do nothing and have their expenses paid
Thats our chance for well go with them and they wont take the time
to look twice or to ask a question Im Captain Trent Carthew youre
Goddedaal Tommy youre Hardy Macs Brown AmaluHold hard we cant
make a Chinaman of him Ah Wing must have deserted Amalu stowed away
and I turned him to as cook and was never at the bother to sign him
Catch the idea Say your names

And that pale company recited their lesson earnestly

What were the names of the other two he asked Him Carthew shot in
the companion and the one I caught in the jaw on the main topgallant

Holdorsen and Wallen said some one

Well theyre drowned continued Wicks drowned alongside trying to
lower a boat We had a bit of a squall last night thats how we
got ashore He ran and squinted at the compass Squall out of
nornorwesthalfwest blew hard every one in a mess falls jammed
and Holdorsen and Wallen spilt overboard See Clear your blooming
heads He was in his jacket now and spoke with a feverish impatience
and contention that rang like anger

But is it safe asked Tommy

Safe bellowed the captain Were standing on the drop you
mooncalf If that ships bound for China which she dont look to be
were lost as soon as we arrive if shes bound the other way she comes
from China dont she Well if theres a man on board of her that ever
clapped eyes on Trent or any blooming hand out of this brig well all
be in irons in two hours Safe no it aint safe its a beggarly last
chance to shave the gallows and thats what it is

At this convincing picture fear took hold on all

Hadnt we a hundred times better stay by the brig cried Carthew
They would give us a hand to float her off

Youll make me waste this holy day in chattering cried Wicks Look
here when I sounded the well this morning there was two foot of water
there against eight inches last night Whats wrong I dont know might
be nothing might be the worst kind of smash And then there we are in
for a thousand miles in an open boat if thats your taste

But it may be nothing and anyway their carpenters are bound to help us
repair her argued Carthew

Moses Murphy cried the captain How did she strike Bows on
I believe And shes down by the head now If any carpenter comes
tinkering here wherell he go first Down in the forepeak I suppose
And then how about all that blood among the chandlery You would think
you were a lot of members of Parliament discussing Plimsoll and youre
just a pack of murderers with the halter round your neck Any other ass
got any time to waste No Thank God for that Now all hands Im going
below and I leave you here on deck You get the boat cover off that
boat then you turn to and open the specie chest There are five of us
get five chests and divide the specie equal among the fiveput it
at the bottomand go at it like tigers Get blankets or canvas or
clothes so it wont rattle Itll make five pretty heavy chests but we
cant help that You Carthewdash meYou Mr Goddedaal come below
Weve our share before us

And he cast another glance at the smoke and hurried below with Carthew
at his heels

The logs were found in the main cabin behind the canarys cage two of
them one kept by Trent one by Goddedaal Wicks looked first at one
then at the other and his lip stuck out

Can you forge hand of write he asked

No said Carthew

Theres luck for youno more can I cried the captain Hullo heres
worse yet heres this Goddedaal up to date he must have filled it in
before supper See for yourself Smoke observedCaptain Kirkup and
five hands of the schooner Currency Lass Ah this is better he
added turning to the other log The old man aint written anything for
a clear fortnight Well dispose of your log altogether Mr Goddedaal
and stick to the old mansto mine I mean only I aint going to write
it up for reasons of my own You are Youre going to sit down right
here and fill it in the way I tell you

How to explain the loss of mine asked Carthew

You never kept one replied the captain Gross neglect of duty
Youll catch it

And the change of writing resumed Carthew You began why do you
stop and why do I come in And youll have to sign anyway

O Ive met with an accident and cant write replied Wicks

An accident repeated Carthew It dont sound natural What kind of
an accident

Wicks spread his hand faceup on the table and drove a knife through
his palm

That kind of an accident said he Theres a way to draw to windward
of most difficulties if youve a head on your shoulders He began
to bind up his hand with a handkerchief glancing the while over
Goddedaals log Hullo he said thisll never do for usthis is an
impossible kind of a yarn Here to begin with is this Captain Trent
trying some fancy course leastways hes a thousand miles to southard
of the great circle And here it seems he was close up with this
island on the sixth sails all these days and is close up with it again
by daylight on the eleventh

Goddedaal said they had the deuces luck said Carthew

Well it dont look like real lifethats all I can say returned
Wicks

Its the way it was though argued Carthew

So it is and what the better are we for that if it dont look so
cried the captain sounding unwonted depths of art criticism Here try
and see if you cant tie this bandage Im bleeding like a pig

As Carthew sought to adjust the handkerchief his patient seemed sunk
in a deep muse his eye veiled his mouth partly open The job was yet
scarce done when he sprang to his feet

I have it he broke out and ran on deck Here boys he cried we
didnt come here on the eleventh we came in here on the evening of the
sixth and lay here ever since becalmed As soon as youve done with
these chests he added you can turn to and roll out beef and water
breakers itll look more shipshapelike as if we were getting ready
for the boat voyage

And he was back again in a moment cooking the new log Goddedaals was
then carefully destroyed and a hunt began for the ships papers Of
all the agonies of that breathless morning this was perhaps the most
poignant Here and there the two men searched cursing cannoning
together streaming with heat freezing with terror News was bawled
down to them that the ship was indeed a manofwar that she was close
up that she was lowering a boat and still they sought in vain By what
accident they missed the iron box with the money and accounts is hard
to fancy but they did And the vital documents were found at last in
the pocket of Trents shoregoing coat where he had left them when last
he came on board

Wicks smiled for the first time that morning None too soon said
he And now for it Take these others for me Im afraid Ill get them
mixed if I keep both

What are they Carthew asked

Theyre the Kirkup and Currency Lass papers he replied Pray God we
need em again


Boats inside the lagoon sir hailed down Mac who sat by the
skylight doing sentry while the others worked

Time we were on deck then Mr Goddedaal said Wicks

As they turned to leave the cabin the canary burst into piercing song

My God cried Carthew with a gulp we cant leave that wretched bird
to starve It was poor Goddedaals

Bring the bally thing along cried the captain

And they went on deck

An ugly brute of a modern manofwar lay just without the reef now
quite inert now giving a flap or two with her propeller Nearer hand
and just within a big white boat came skimming to the stroke of many
oars her ensign blowing at the stern

One word more said Wicks after he had taken in the scene Mac
youve been in China ports All right then you can speak for yourself
The rest of you I kept on board all the time we were in Hongkong hoping
you would desert but you fooled me and stuck to the brig Thatll make
your lying come easier

The boat was now close at hand a boy in the stern sheets was the
only officer and a poor one plainly for the men were talking as they
pulled

Thank God theyve only sent a kind of a middy ejaculated Wicks
Here you Hardy stand forard Ill have no deck hands on my
quarterdeck he cried and the reproof braced the whole crew like a
cold douche

The boat came alongside with perfect neatness and the boy officer
stepped on board where he was respectfully greeted by Wicks

You the master of this ship he asked

Yes sir said Wicks Trent is my name and this is the Flying Scud
of Hull

You seem to have got into a mess said the officer

If youll step aft with me here Ill tell you all there is of it
said Wicks

Why man youre shaking cried the officer

So would you perhaps if you had been in the same berth returned
Wicks and he told the whole story of the rotten water the long calm
the squall the seamen drowned glibly and hotly talking with his head
in the lions mouth like one pleading in the dock I heard the same
tale from the same narrator in the saloon in San Francisco and even
then his bearing filled me with suspicion But the officer was no
observer

Well the captain is in no end of a hurry said he but I was
instructed to give you all the assistance in my power and signal back
for another boat if more hands were necessary What can I do for you

O we wont keep you no time replied Wicks cheerily Were all
ready bless youmens chests chronometer papers and all

Do you mean to leave her cried the officer She seems to me to lie
nicely cant we get your ship off

So we could and no mistake but how were to keep her afloats another
question Her bows is stove in replied Wicks

The officer coloured to the eyes He was incompetent and knew he was
thought he was already detected and feared to expose himself again
There was nothing further from his mind than that the captain should
deceive him if the captain was pleased why so was he All right he
said Tell your men to get their chests aboard

Mr Goddedaal turn the hands to to get the chests aboard said Wicks

The four Currency Lasses had waited the while on tenterhooks This
welcome news broke upon them like the sun at midnight and Hadden burst
into a storm of tears sobbing aloud as he heaved upon the tackle But
the work went none the less briskly forward chests men and bundles
were got over the side with alacrity the boat was shoved off it moved
out of the long shadow of the Flying Scud and its bows were pointed at
the passage

So much then was accomplished The sham wreck had passed muster they
were clear of her they were safe away and the water widened between
them and her damning evidences On the other hand they were drawing
nearer to the ship of war which might very well prove to be their
prison and a hangmans cart to bear them to the gallowsof which they
had not yet learned either whence she came or whither she was bound and
the doubt weighed upon their heart like mountains

It was Wicks who did the talking The sound was small in Carthews ears
like the voices of men miles away but the meaning of each word struck
home to him like a bullet What did you say your ship was inquired
Wicks

Tempest dont you know returned the officer

Dont you know What could that mean Perhaps nothing perhaps that the
ships had met already Wicks took his courage in both hands Where is
she bound he asked

O were just looking in at all these miserable islands here said the
officer Then we bear up for San Francisco

O yes youre from China ways like us pursued Wicks

Hong Kong said the officer and spat over the side

Hong Kong Then the game was up as soon as they set foot on board
they would be seized the wreck would be examined the blood found the
lagoon perhaps dredged and the bodies of the dead would reappear to
testify An impulse almost incontrollable bade Carthew rise from the
thwart shriek out aloud and leap overboard it seemed so vain a thing
to dissemble longer to dally with the inevitable to spin out some
hundred seconds more of agonised suspense with shame and death thus
visibly approaching But the indomitable Wicks persevered His face
was like a skull his voice scarce recognisable the dullest of men and
officers it seemed must have remarked that telltale countenance and
broken utterance And still he persevered bent upon certitude

Nice place Hong Kong he said

Im sure I dont know said the officer Only a day and a half there
called for orders and came straight on here Never heard of such a
beastly cruise And he went on describing and lamenting the untoward
fortunes of the Tempest

But Wicks and Carthew heeded him no longer They lay back on the gunnel
breathing deep sunk in a stupor of the body the mind within still
nimbly and agreeably at work measuring the past danger exulting in the
present relief numbering with ecstasy their ultimate chances of escape
For the voyage in the manofwar they were now safe yet a few more days
of peril activity and presence of mind in San Francisco and the
whole horrid tale was blotted out and Wicks again became Kirkup and
Goddedaal became Carthewmen beyond all shot of possible suspicion men
who had never heard of the Flying Scud who had never been in sight of
Midway Reef

So they came alongside under many craning heads of seamen and
projecting mouths of guns so they climbed on board somnambulous and
looked blindly about them at the tall spars the white decks and the
crowding ships company and heard men as from far away and answered
them at random

And then a hand fell softly on Carthews shoulder


Why Norrie old chappie where have you dropped from All the worlds
been looking for you Dont you know youve come into your kingdom

He turned beheld the face of his old schoolmate Sebright and fell
unconscious at his feet

The doctor was attending him a while later in Lieutenant Sebrights
cabin when he came to himself He opened his eyes looked hard in the
strange face and spoke with a kind of solemn vigour

Brown must go the same road he said now or never And then paused
and his reason coming to him with more clearness spoke again What was
I saying Where am I Who are you

I am the doctor of the Tempest was the reply You are in Lieutenant
Sebrights berth and you may dismiss all concern from your mind Your
troubles are over Mr Carthew

Why do you call me that he asked Ah I rememberSebright knew me
O and he groaned and shook Send down Wicks to me I must see Wicks
at once he cried and seized the doctors wrist with unconscious
violence

All right said the doctor Lets make a bargain You swallow down
this draught and Ill go and fetch Wicks

And he gave the wretched man an opiate that laid him out within ten
minutes and in all likelihood preserved his reason

It was the doctors next business to attend to Mac and he found
occasion while engaged upon his arm to make the man repeat the names
of the rescued crew It was now the turn of the captain and there is
no doubt he was no longer the man that we have seen sudden relief the
sense of perfect safety a square meal and a good glass of grog had all
combined to relax his vigilance and depress his energy

When was this done asked the doctor looking at the wound

More than a week ago replied Wicks thinking singly of his log

Hey cried the doctor and he raised his hand and looked the captain
in the eyes

I dont remember exactly faltered Wicks

And at this remarkable falsehood the suspicions of the doctor were at
once quadrupled

By the way which of you is called Wicks he asked easily

Whats that snapped the captain falling white as paper

Wicks repeated the doctor which of you is he thats surely a plain
question

Wicks stared upon his questioner in silence

Which is Brown then pursued the doctor

What are you talking of what do you mean by this cried Wicks
snatching his halfbandaged hand away so that the blood sprinkled in
the surgeons face

He did not trouble to remove it Looking straight at his victim he
pursued his questions Why must Brown go the same way he asked

Wicks fell trembling on a locker Carthews told you he cried

No replied the doctor he has not But he and you between you have
set me thinking and I think theres something wrong

Give me some grog said Wicks Id rather tell than have you find
out Im damned if its half as bad as what any one would think

And with the help of a couple of strong grogs the tragedy of the Flying
Scud was told for the first time

It was a fortunate series of accidents that brought the story to the
doctor He understood and pitied the position of these wretched men and
came wholeheartedly to their assistance He and Wicks and Carthew so
soon as he was recovered held a hundred councils and prepared a policy
for San Francisco It was he who certified Goddedaal unfit to be moved
and smuggled Carthew ashore under cloud of night it was he who kept
Wickss wound open that he might sign with his left hand he who took
all their Chile silver and in the course of the first day got it
converted for them into portable gold He used his influence in the
wardroom to keep the tongues of the young officers in order so that
Carthews identification was kept out of the papers And he rendered
another service yet more important He had a friend in San Francisco
a millionaire to this man he privately presented Carthew as a young
gentleman come newly into a huge estate but troubled with Jew debts
which he was trying to settle on the quiet The millionaire came readily
to help and it was with his money that the wrecker gang was to be
fought What was his name out of a thousand guesses It was Douglas
Longhurst

As long as the Currency Lasses could all disappear under fresh names
it did not greatly matter if the brig were bought or any small
discrepancies should be discovered in the wrecking The identification
of one of their number had changed all that The smallest scandal must
now direct attention to the movements of Norris It would be asked how
he who had sailed in a schooner from Sydney had turned up so shortly
after in a brig out of Hong Kong and from one question to another all
his original shipmates were pretty sure to be involved Hence arose
naturally the idea of preventing danger profiting by Carthews
newfound wealth and buying the brig under an alias and it was put in
hand with equal energy and caution Carthew took lodgings alone under
a false name picked up Bellairs at random and commissioned him to buy
the wreck

What figure if you please the lawyer asked

I want it bought replied Carthew I dont mind about the price

Any price is no price said Bellairs Put a name upon it

Call it ten thousand pounds then if you like said Carthew

In the meanwhile the captain had to walk the streets appear in the
consulate be crossexamined by Lloyds agent be badgered about his
lost accounts sign papers with his left hand and repeat his lies to
every skipper in San Francisco not knowing at what moment he might
run into the arms of some old friend who should hail him by the name of
Wicks or some new enemy who should be in a position to deny him that
of Trent And the latter incident did actually befall him but was
transformed by his stout countenance into an element of strength It was
in the consulate of all untoward places that he suddenly heard a big
voice inquiring for Captain Trent He turned with the customary sinking
at his heart

YOU aint Captain Trent said the stranger falling back Why whats
all this They tell me youre passing off as Captain TrentCaptain
Jacob Trenta man I knew since I was that high

O youre thinking of my uncle as had the bank in Cardiff replied
Wicks with desperate aplomb

I declare I never knew he had a nevvy said the stranger

Well you see he has says Wicks

And how is the old man asked the other

Fit as a fiddle answered Wicks and was opportunely summoned by the
clerk

This alert was the only one until the morning of the sale when he
was once more alarmed by his interview with Jim and it was with some
anxiety that he attended the sale knowing only that Carthew was to
be represented but neither who was to represent him nor what were the
instructions given I suppose Captain Wicks is a good life In spite of
his personal appearance and his own known uneasiness I suppose he is
secure from apoplexy or it must have struck him there and then as he
looked on at the stages of that insane sale and saw the old brig and her
not very valuable cargo knocked down at last to a total stranger for ten
thousand pounds

It had been agreed that he was to avoid Carthew and above all Carthews
lodging so that no connexion might be traced between the crew and the
pseudonymous purchaser But the hour for caution was gone by and he
caught a tram and made all speed to Mission Street

Carthew met him in the door

Come away come away from here said Carthew and when they were clear
of the house Alls up he added


O youve heard of the sale then said Wicks

The sale cried Carthew I declare I had forgotten it And he told
of the voice in the telephone and the maddening question Why did you
want to buy the Flying Scud

This circumstance coming on the back of the monstrous improbabilities
of the sale was enough to have shaken the reason of Immanuel Kant The
earth seemed banded together to defeat them the stones and the boys on
the street appeared to be in possession of their guilty secret Flight
was their one thought The treasure of the Currency Lass they packed in
waistbelts expressed their chests to an imaginary address in British
Columbia and left San Francisco the same afternoon booked for Los
Angeles

The next day they pursued their retreat by the Southern Pacific route
which Carthew followed on his way to England but the other three
branched off for Mexico



EPILOGUE

TO WILL H LOW

DEAR LOW The other day at Manihiki of all places I had the pleasure
to meet Dodd We sat some two hours in the neat little toylike
church set with pews after the manner of Europe and inlaid with
motherofpearl in the style I suppose of the New Jerusalem The
natives who are decidedly the most attractive inhabitants of this
planet crowded round us in the pew and fawned upon and patted us and
here it was I put my questions and Dodd answered me

I first carried him back to the night in Barbizon when Carthew told his
story and asked him what was done about Bellairs It seemed he had
put the matter to his friend at once and that Carthew took it with an
inimitable lightness Hes poor and Im rich he had said I can
afford to smile at him I go somewhere else thats allsomewhere
thats far away and dear to get to Persia would be found to answer I
fancy No end of a place Persia Why not come with me And they had
left the next afternoon for Constantinople on their way to Teheran
Of the shyster it is only known by a newspaper paragraph that he
returned somehow to San Francisco and died in the hospital

Now theres another point said I There you are off to Persia with
a millionaire and rich yourself How come you here in the South Seas
running a trader

He said with a smile that I had not yet heard of Jims last
bankruptcy I was about cleaned out once more he said and then it
was that Carthew had this schooner built and put me in as supercargo
Its his yacht and its my trader and as nearly all the expenses go to
the yacht I do pretty well As for Jim hes right again one of the
best businesses they say in the West fruit cereals and real estate
and he has a Tartar of a partner nowNares no less Nares will keep
him straight Nares has a big head They have their countryplaces next
door at Saucelito and I stayed with them time about the last time I
was on the coast Jim had a paper of his ownI think he has a notion
of being senator one of these daysand he wanted me to throw up the
schooner and come and write his editorials He holds strong views on the
State Constitution and so does Mamie

And what became of the other three Currency Lasses after they left
Carthew I inquired

Well it seems they had a huge spree in the city of Mexico said Dodd
and then Hadden and the Irishman took a turn at the gold fields in
Venezuela and Wicks went on alone to Valparaiso Theres a Kirkup in
the Chilean navy to this day I saw the name in the papers about the
Balmaceda war Hadden soon wearied of the mines and I met him the other
day in Sydney The last news he had from Venezuela Mac had been knocked
over in an attack on the gold train So theres only the three of them
left for Amalu scarcely counts He lives on his own land in Maui at
the side of Haleakala where he keeps Goddedaals canary and they
say he sticks to his dollars which is a wonder in a Kanaka He had
a considerable pile to start with for not only Hemsteads share but
Carthews was divided equally among the other fourMac being counted

What did that make for him altogether I could not help asking for I
had been diverted by the number of calculations in his narrative

One hundred and twentyeight pounds nineteen shillings and eleven pence
halfpenny he replied with composure Thats leaving out what little
he won at Van John Its something for a Kanaka you know

And about that time we were at last obliged to yield to the
solicitations of our native admirers and go to the pastors house to
drink green cocoanuts The ship I was in was sailing the same night for
Dodd had been beforehand and got all the shell in the island and though
he pressed me to desert and return with him to Auckland whither he was
now bound to pick up Carthew I was firm in my refusal

The truth is since I have been mixed up with Havens and Dodd in the
design to publish the latters narrative I seem to feel no want for
Carthews society Of course I am wholly modern in sentiment and think
nothing more noble than to publish peoples private affairs at so much a
line They like it and if they dont they ought to But a still small
voice keeps telling me they will not like it always and perhaps not
always stand it Memory besides supplies me with the face of a pressman
in the sacred phrase who proved altogether too modern for one of his
neighbours and


 Qui nunc it per iter tenebricosum

as it were marshalling us our way I am in no haste to

 nos proecedens

be that mans successor Carthew has a record as a clane shot and for
some years Samoa will be good enough for me

We agreed to separate accordingly but he took me on board in his own
boat with the hardwood fittings and entertained me on the way with
an account of his late visit to Butaritari whither he had gone on
an errand for Carthew to see how Topelius was getting along and if
necessary to give him a helping hand But Topelius was in great force
and had patronised andwelloutmanoeuvred him

Carthew will be pleased said Dodd for theres no doubt they
oppressed the man abominably when they were in the Currency Lass Its
diamond cut diamond now


This I think was the most of the news I got from my friend Loudon and
I hope I was well inspired and have put all the questions to which you
would be curious to hear an answer

But there is one more that I daresay you are burning to put to myself
and that is what your own name is doing in this place cropping up as
it were uncalledfor on the stern of our poor ship If you were not
born in Arcadia you linger in fancy on its margin your thoughts are
busied with the flutes of antiquity with daffodils and the classic
poplar and the footsteps of the nymphs and the elegant and moving
aridity of ancient art Why dedicate to you a tale of a caste
so modernfull of details of our barbaric manners and unstable
moralsfull of the need and the lust of money so that there is scarce
a page in which the dollars do not jinglefull of the unrest and
movement of our century so that the reader is hurried from place to
place and sea to sea and the book is less a romance than a panoramain
the end as bloodbespattered as an epic

Well you are a man interested in all problems of art even the most
vulgar and it may amuse you to hear the genesis and growth of _The
Wrecker_ On board the schooner Equator almost within sight of the
Johnstone Islands if anybody knows where these are and on a moonlit
night when it was a joy to be alive the authors were amused with
several stories of the sale of wrecks The subject tempted them and
they sat apart in the alleyway to discuss its possibilities What a
tangle it would make suggested one if the wrong crew were aboard
But how to get the wrong crew thereI have it cried the other
the soandso affair For not so many months before and not so many
hundred miles from where we were then sailing a proposition almost
tantamount to that of Captain Trent had been made by a British skipper
to some British castaways

Before we turned in the scaffolding of the tale had been put together
But the question of treatment was as usual more obscure We had long
been at once attracted and repelled by that very modern form of the
police novel or mystery story which consists in beginning your yarn
anywhere but at the beginning and finishing it anywhere but at the
end attracted by its peculiar interest when done and the peculiar
difficulties that attend its execution repelled by that appearance
of insincerity and shallowness of tone which seems its inevitable
drawback For the mind of the reader always bent to pick up clews
receives no impression of reality or life rather of an airless
elaborate mechanism and the book remains enthralling but
insignificant like a game of chess not a work of human art It seemed
the cause might lie partly in the abrupt attack and that if the tale
were gradually approached some of the characters introduced as it
were beforehand and the book started in the tone of a novel of manners
and experience briefly treated this defect might be lessened and our
mystery seem to inhere in life The tone of the age its movement the
mingling of races and classes in the dollar hunt the fiery and not
quite unromantic struggle for existence with its changing trades and
scenery and two types in particular that of the American handyman of
business and that of the Yankee merchant sailorwe agreed to dwell upon
at some length and make the woof to our not very precious warp Hence
Dodds father and Pinkerton and Nares and the Dromedary picnics and
the railway work in New South Walesthe last an unsolicited testimonial
from the powers that be for the tale was half written before I saw
Carthews squad toil in the rainy cutting at South Clifton or heard
from the engineer of his young swell After we had invented at some
expense of time this method of approaching and fortifying our police
novel it occurred to us it had been invented previously by some one
else and was in facthowever painfully different the results may
seemthe method of Charles Dickens in his later work

I see you staring Here you will say is a prodigious quantity of
theory to our halfpenny worth of police novel and withal not a shadow
of an answer to your question

Well some of us like theory After so long a piece of practice these
may be indulged for a few pages And the answer is at hand It was
plainly desirable from every point of view of convenience and contrast
that our hero and narrator should partly stand aside from those with
whom he mingles and be but a pressedman in the dollar hunt Thus it
was that Loudon Dodd became a student of the plastic arts and that our
globetrotting story came to visit Paris and look in at Barbizon And
thus it is dear Low that your name appears in the address of this
epilogue

For sure if any person can here appreciate and read between the lines
it must be youand one other our friend All the dominos will be
transparent to your better knowledge the statuary contract will be to
you a piece of ancient history and you will not have now heard for the
first time of the dangers of Roussillon Dead leaves from the Bas Breau
echoes from Lavenues and the Rue Racine memories of a common past let
these be your bookmarkers as you read And if you care for naught else
in the story be a little pleased to breathe once more for a moment the
airs of our youth

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
