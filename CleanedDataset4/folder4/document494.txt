TOMORROW


By Joseph Conrad


What was known of Captain Hagberd in the little seaport of Colebrook was
not exactly in his favour He did not belong to the place He had come
to settle there under circumstances not at all mysterioushe used to
be very communicative about them at the timebut extremely morbid and
unreasonable He was possessed of some little money evidently because
he bought a plot of ground and had a pair of ugly yellow brick cottages
run up very cheaply He occupied one of them himself and let the other
to Josiah Carvilblind Carvil the retired boatbuildera man of evil
repute as a domestic tyrant

These cottages had one wall in common shared in a line of iron railing
dividing their front gardens a wooden fence separated their back
gardens Miss Bessie Carvil was allowed as it were of right to throw
over it the teacloths blue rags or an apron that wanted drying

It rots the wood Bessie my girl the captain would remark mildly
from his side of the fence each time he saw her exercising that
privilege

She was a tall girl the fence was low and she could spread her elbows
on the top Her hands would be red with the bit of washing she had
done but her forearms were white and shapely and she would look at her
fathers landlord in silencein an informed silence which had an air of
knowledge expectation and desire

It rots the wood repeated Captain Hagberd It is the only unthrifty
careless habit I know in you Why dont you have a clothes line out in
your back yard

Miss Carvil would say nothing to thisshe only shook her head
negatively The tiny back yard on her side had a few stonebordered
little beds of black earth in which the simple flowers she found time
to cultivate appeared somehow extravagantly overgrown as if belonging
to an exotic clime and Captain Hagberds upright hale person clad in
No 1 sailcloth from head to foot would be emerging kneedeep out of
rank grass and the tall weeks on his side of the fence He appeared
with the colour and uncouth stiffness of the extraordinary material in
which he chose to clothe himselffor the time being would be his
mumbled remark to any observation on the subjectlike a man roughened
out of granite standing in a wilderness not big enough for a decent
billiardroom A heavy figure of a man of stone with a red handsome
face a blue wandering eye and a great white beard flowing to his waist
and never trimmed as far as Colebrook knew

Seven years before he had seriously answered Next month I think
to the chaffing attempt to secure his custom made by that distinguished
local wit the Colebrook barber who happened to be sitting insolently
in the taproom of the New Inn near the harbour where the captain had
entered to buy an ounce of tobacco After paying for his purchase with
three halfpence extracted from the corner of a handkerchief which he
carried in the cuff of his sleeve Captain Hagberd went out As soon
as the door was shut the barber laughed The old one and the young one
will be strolling arm in arm to get shaved in my place presently The
tailor shall be set to work and the barber and the candlestick maker
high old times are coming for Colebrook they are coming to be sure It
used to be next week now it has come to next month and so onsoon
it will be next spring for all I know

Noticing a stranger listening to him with a vacant grin he explained
stretching out his legs cynically that this queer old Hagberd a
retired coastingskipper was waiting for the return of a son of his
The boy had been driven away from home he shouldnt wonder had run
away to sea and had never been heard of since Put to rest in Davy
Joness locker this many a day as likely as not That old man came
flying to Colebrook three years ago all in black broadcloth had lost
his wife lately then getting out of a thirdclass smoker as if the
devil had been at his heels and the only thing that brought him down
was a lettera hoax probably Some joker had written to him about a
seafaring man with some such name who was supposed to be hanging about
some girl or other either in Colebrook or in the neighbourhood Funny
aint it The old chap had been advertising in the London papers for
Harry Hagberd and offering rewards for any sort of likely information
And the barber would go on to describe with sardonic gusto how that
stranger in mourning had been seen exploring the country in carts on
foot taking everybody into his confidence visiting all the inns
and alehouses for miles around stopping people on the road with his
questions looking into the very ditches almost first in the greatest
excitement then with a plodding sort of perseverance growing slower
and slower and he could not even tell you plainly how his son looked
The sailor was supposed to be one of two that had left a timber
ship and to have been seen dangling after some girl but the old man
described a boy of fourteen or soa cleverlooking highspirited
boy And when people only smiled at this he would rub his forehead in
a confused sort of way before he slunk off looking offended He found
nobody of course not a trace of anybodynever heard of anything worth
belief at any rate but he had not been able somehow to tear himself
away from Colebrook

It was the shock of this disappointment perhaps coming soon after the
loss of his wife that had driven him crazy on that point the barber
suggested with an air of great psychological insight After a time the
old man abandoned the active search His son had evidently gone away
but he settled himself to wait His son had been once at least in
Colebrook in preference to his native place There must have been some
reason for it he seemed to think some very powerful inducement that
would bring him back to Colebrook again

Ha ha ha Why of course Colebrook Where else Thats the only
place in the United Kingdom for your longlost sons So he sold up his
old home in Colchester and down he comes here Well its a craze
like any other Wouldnt catch me going crazy over any of my youngsters
clearing out Ive got eight of them at home The barber was showing
off his strength of mind in the midst of a laughter that shook the
taproom

Strange though that sort of thing he would confess with the
frankness of a superior intelligence seemed to be catching His
establishment for instance was near the harbour and whenever a
sailorman came in for a haircut or a shaveif it was a strange face he
couldnt help thinking directly Suppose hes the son of old Hagberd
He laughed at himself for it It was a strong craze He could remember
the time when the whole town was full of it But he had his hopes of the
old chap yet He would cure him by a course of judicious chaffing He
was watching the progress of the treatment Next weeknext monthnext
year When the old skipper had put off the date of that return till next
year he would be well on his way to not saying any more about it In
other matters he was quite rational so this too was bound to come
Such was the barbers firm opinion

Nobody had ever contradicted him his own hair had gone grey since
that time and Captain Hagberds beard had turned quite white and had
acquired a majestic flow over the No 1 canvas suit which he had made
for himself secretly with tarred twine and had assumed suddenly coming
out in it one fine morning whereas the evening before he had been seen
going home in his mourning of broadcloth It caused a sensation in the
High Streetshopkeepers coming to their doors people in the houses
snatching up their hats to run outa stir at which he seemed strangely
surprised at first and then scared but his only answer to the
wondering questions was that startled and evasive For the present

That sensation had been forgotten long ago and Captain Hagberd
himself if not forgotten had come to be disregardedthe penalty of
dailinessas the sun itself is disregarded unless it makes its power
felt heavily Captain Hagberds movements showed no infirmity he walked
stiffly in his suit of canvas a quaint and remarkable figure only his
eyes wandered more furtively perhaps than of yore His manner abroad had
lost its excitable watchfulness it had become puzzled and diffident
as though he had suspected that there was somewhere about him something
slightly compromising some embarrassing oddity and yet had remained
unable to discover what on earth this something wrong could be

He was unwilling now to talk with the townsfolk He had earned for
himself the reputation of an awful skinflint of a miser in the matter
of living He mumbled regretfully in the shops bought inferior scraps
of meat after long hesitations and discouraged all allusions to his
costume It was as the barber had foretold For all one could tell he
had recovered already from the disease of hope and only Miss Bessie
Carvil knew that he said nothing about his sons return because with him
it was no longer next week next month or even next year It was
tomorrow

In their intimacy of back yard and front garden he talked with her
paternally reasonably and dogmatically with a touch of arbitrariness
They met on the ground of unreserved confidence which was authenticated
by an affectionate wink now and then Miss Carvil had come to look
forward rather to these winks At first they had discomposed her the
poor fellow was mad Afterwards she had learned to laugh at them there
was no harm in him Now she was aware of an unacknowledged pleasurable
incredulous emotion expressed by a faint blush He winked not in the
least vulgarly his thin red face with a wellmodelled curved nose had
a sort of distinctionthe more so that when he talked to her he looked
with a steadier and more intelligent glance A handsome hale upright
capable man with a white beard You did not think of his age His son
he affirmed had resembled him amazingly from his earliest babyhood

Harry would be oneandthirty next July he declared Proper age to get
married with a nice sensible girl that could appreciate a good home He
was a very highspirited boy Highspirited husbands were the easiest
to manage These mean soft chaps that you would think butter
wouldnt melt in their mouths were the ones to make a woman thoroughly
miserable And there was nothing like a homea firesidea good roof
no turning out of your warm bed in all sorts of weather Eh my dear

Captain Hagberd had been one of those sailors that pursue their calling
within sight of land One of the many children of a bankrupt farmer he
had been apprenticed hurriedly to a coasting skipper and had remained
on the coast all his sea life It must have been a hard one at first
he had never taken to it his affection turned to the land with its
innumerable houses with its quiet lives gathered round its firesides
Many sailors feel and profess a rational dislike for the sea but his
was a profound and emotional animosityas if the love of the stabler
element had been bred into him through many generations

People did not know what they let their boys in for when they let them
go to sea he expounded to Bessie As soon make convicts of them at
once He did not believe you ever got used to it The weariness of such
a life got worse as you got older What sort of trade was it in which
more than half your time you did not put your foot inside your house
Directly you got out to sea you had no means of knowing what went on
at home One might have thought him weary of distant voyages and the
longest he had ever made had lasted a fortnight of which the most part
had been spent at anchor sheltering from the weather As soon as his
wife had inherited a house and enough to live on from a bachelor uncle
who had made some money in the coal business he threw up his command of
an Eastcoast collier with a feeling as though he had escaped from the
galleys After all these years he might have counted on the fingers of
his two hands all the days he had been out of sight of England He
had never known what it was to be out of soundings I have never been
further than eighty fathoms from the land was one of his boasts

Bessie Carvil heard all these things In front of their cottage grew an
undersized ash and on summer afternoons she would bring out a chair
on the grassplot and sit down with her sewing Captain Hagberd in his
canvas suit leaned on a spade He dug every day in his front plot He
turned it over and over several times every year but was not going to
plant anything just at present

To Bessie Carvil he would state more explicitly Not till our Harry
comes home tomorrow And she had heard this formula of hope so often
that it only awakened the vaguest pity in her heart for that hopeful old
man

Everything was put off in that way and everything was being prepared
likewise for tomorrow There was a boxful of packets of various
flowerseeds to choose from for the front garden He will doubtless let
you have your say about that my dear Captain Hagberd intimated to her
across the railing

Miss Bessies head remained bowed over her work She had heard all this
so many times But now and then she would rise lay down her sewing and
come slowly to the fence There was a charm in these gentle ravings He
was determined that his son should not go away again for the want of a
home all ready for him He had been filling the other cottage with all
sorts of furniture She imagined it all new fresh with varnish piled
up as in a warehouse There would be tables wrapped up in sacking rolls
of carpets thick and vertical like fragments of columns the gleam of
white marble tops in the dimness of the drawn blinds Captain Hagberd
always described his purchases to her carefully as to a person having
a legitimate interest in them The overgrown yard of his cottage could
be laid over with concrete after tomorrow

We may just as well do away with the fence You could have your
dryingline out quite clear of your flowers He winked and she would
blush faintly

This madness that had entered her life through the kind impulses of her
heart had reasonable details What if some day his son returned But she
could not even be quite sure that he ever had a son and if he existed
anywhere he had been too long away When Captain Hagberd got excited in
his talk she would steady him by a pretence of belief laughing a little
to salve her conscience

Only once she had tried pityingly to throw some doubt on that hope
doomed to disappointment but the effect of her attempt had scared her
very much All at once over that mans face there came an expression of
horror and incredulity as though he had seen a crack open out in the
firmament

Youyouyou dont think hes drowned

For a moment he seemed to her ready to go out of his mind for in his
ordinary state she thought him more sane than people gave him credit
for On that occasion the violence of the emotion was followed by a most
paternal and complacent recovery

Dont alarm yourself my dear he said a little cunningly the sea
cant keep him He does not belong to it None of us Hagberds ever did
belong to it Look at me I didnt get drowned Moreover he isnt
a sailor at all and if he is not a sailor hes bound to come back
Theres nothing to prevent him coming back

His eyes began to wander

Tomorrow

She never tried again for fear the man should go out of his mind on
the spot He depended on her She seemed the only sensible person in
the town and he would congratulate himself frankly before her face
on having secured such a levelheaded wife for his son The rest of the
town he confided to her once in a fit of temper was certainly queer
The way they looked at youthe way they talked to you He had never got
on with any one in the place Didnt like the people He would not have
left his own country if it had not been clear that his son had taken a
fancy to Colebrook

She humoured him in silence listening patiently by the fence
crocheting with downcast eyes Blushes came with difficulty on her
deadwhite complexion under the negligently twisted opulence of
mahoganycoloured hair Her father was frankly carroty

She had a full figure a tired unrefreshed face When Captain Hagberd
vaunted the necessity and propriety of a home and the delights of ones
own fireside she smiled a little with her lips only Her home delights
had been confined to the nursing of her father during the ten best years
of her life

A bestial roaring coming out of an upstairs window would interrupt their
talk She would begin at once to roll up her crochetwork or fold her
sewing without the slightest sign of haste Meanwhile the howls and
roars of her name would go on making the fishermen strolling upon the
seawall on the other side of the road turn their heads towards the
cottages She would go in slowly at the front door and a moment
afterwards there would fall a profound silence Presently she would
reappear leading by the hand a man gross and unwieldy like a
hippopotamus with a badtempered surly face

He was a widowed boatbuilder whom blindness had overtaken years before
in the full flush of business He behaved to his daughter as if she
had been responsible for its incurable character He had been heard to
bellow at the top of his voice as if to defy Heaven that he did not
care he had made enough money to have ham and eggs for his breakfast
every morning He thanked God for it in a fiendish tone as though he
were cursing

Captain Hagberd had been so unfavourably impressed by his tenant that
once he told Miss Bessie He is a very extravagant fellow my dear

She was knitting that day finishing a pair of socks for her father who
expected her to keep up the supply dutifully She hated knitting
and as she was just at the heel part she had to keep her eyes on her
needles

Of course it isnt as if he had a son to provide for Captain
Hagberd went on a little vacantly Girls of course dont require so
muchhmhm They dont run away from home my dear

No said Miss Bessie quietly

Captain Hagberd amongst the mounds of turnedup earth chuckled With
his maritime rig his weatherbeaten face his beard of Father Neptune
he resembled a deposed seagod who had exchanged the trident for the
spade

And he must look upon you as already provided for in a manner Thats
the best of it with the girls The husbands He winked Miss
Bessie absorbed in her knitting coloured faintly

Bessie my hat old Carvil bellowed out suddenly He had been sitting
under the tree mute and motionless like an idol of some remarkably
monstrous superstition He never opened his mouth but to howl for her
at her sometimes about her and then he did not moderate the terms of
his abuse Her system was never to answer him at all and he kept up
his shouting till he got attended totill she shook him by the arm or
thrust the mouthpiece of his pipe between his teeth He was one of the
few blind people who smoke When he felt the hat being put on his head
he stopped his noise at once Then he rose and they passed together
through the gate

He weighed heavily on her arm During their slow toilful walks she
appeared to be dragging with her for a penance the burden of that infirm
bulk Usually they crossed the road at once the cottages stood in the
fields near the harbour two hundred yards away from the end of the
street and for a long long time they would remain in view ascending
imperceptibly the flight of wooden steps that led to the top of the
seawall It ran on from east to west shutting out the Channel like a
neglected railway embankment on which no train had ever rolled within
memory of man Groups of sturdy fishermen would emerge upon the sky
walk along for a bit and sink without haste Their brown nets like the
cobwebs of gigantic spiders lay on the shabby grass of the slope and
looking up from the end of the street the people of the town would
recognise the two Carvils by the creeping slowness of their gait
Captain Hagberd pottering aimlessly about his cottages would raise his
head to see how they got on in their promenade

He advertised still in the Sunday papers for Harry Hagberd These sheets
were read in foreign parts to the end of the world he informed Bessie
At the same time he seemed to think that his son was in Englandso
near to Colebrook that he would of course turn up tomorrow Bessie
without committing herself to that opinion in so many words argued that
in that case the expense of advertising was unnecessary Captain Hagberd
had better spend that weekly halfcrown on himself She declared she did
not know what he lived on Her argumentation would puzzle him and cast
him down for a time They all do it he pointed out There was a whole
column devoted to appeals after missing relatives He would bring the
newspaper to show her He and his wife had advertised for years only
she was an impatient woman The news from Colebrook had arrived the very
day after her funeral if she had not been so impatient she might have
been here now with no more than one day more to wait You are not an
impatient woman my dear

Ive no patience with you sometimes she would say

If he still advertised for his son he did not offer rewards for
information any more for with the muddled lucidity of a mental
derangement he had reasoned himself into a conviction as clear as
daylight that he had already attained all that could be expected in that
way What more could he want Colebrook was the place and there was no
need to ask for more Miss Carvil praised him for his good sense and
he was soothed by the part she took in his hope which had become his
delusion in that idea which blinded his mind to truth and probability
just as the other old man in the other cottage had been made blind by
another disease to the light and beauty of the world

But anything he could interpret as a doubtany coldness of assent or
even a simple inattention to the development of his projects of a home
with his returned son and his sons wifewould irritate him into flings
and jerks and wicked side glances He would dash his spade into
the ground and walk to and fro before it Miss Bessie called it his
tantrums She shook her finger at him Then when she came out again
after he had parted with her in anger he would watch out of the corner
of his eyes for the least sign of encouragement to approach the iron
railings and resume his fatherly and patronising relations

For all their intimacy which had lasted some years now they had never
talked without a fence or a railing between them He described to her
all the splendours accumulated for the settingup of their housekeeping
but had never invited her to an inspection No human eye was to behold
them till Harry had his first look In fact nobody had ever been
inside his cottage he did his own housework and he guarded his sons
privilege so jealously that the small objects of domestic use he bought
sometimes in the town were smuggled rapidly across the front garden
under his canvas coat Then coming out he would remark apologetically
It was only a small kettle my dear

And if not too tired with her drudgery or worried beyond endurance by
her father she would laugh at him with a blush and say Thats all
right Captain Hagberd I am not impatient

Well my dear you havent long to wait now he would answer with a
sudden bashfulness and looking uneasily as though he had suspected
that there was something wrong somewhere

Every Monday she paid him his rent over the railings He clutched
the shillings greedily He grudged every penny he had to spend on his
maintenance and when he left her to make his purchases his bearing
changed as soon as he got into the street Away from the sanction of her
pity he felt himself exposed without defence He brushed the walls with
his shoulder He mistrusted the queerness of the people yet by then
even the town children had left off calling after him and the tradesmen
served him without a word The slightest allusion to his clothing had
the power to puzzle and frighten especially as if it were something
utterly unwarranted and incomprehensible

In the autumn the driving rain drummed on his sailcloth suit saturated
almost to the stiffness of sheetiron with its surface flowing with
water When the weather was too bad he retreated under the tiny porch
and standing close against the door looked at his spade left planted
in the middle of the yard The ground was so much dug up all over that
as the season advanced it turned to a quagmire When it froze hard he
was disconsolate What would Harry say And as he could not have so much
of Bessies company at that time of the year the roars of old Carvil
that came muffled through the closed windows calling her indoors
exasperated him greatly

Why dont that extravagant fellow get you a servant he asked
impatiently one mild afternoon She had thrown something over her head
to run out for a while

I dont know said the pale Bessie wearily staring away with her
heavylidded grey and unexpectant glance There were always smudgy
shadows under her eyes and she did not seem able to see any change or
any end to her life

You wait till you get married my dear said her only friend drawing
closer to the fence Harry will get you one

His hopeful craze seemed to mock her own want of hope with so bitter an
aptness that in her nervous irritation she could have screamed at him
outright But she only said in selfmockery and speaking to him as
though he had been sane Why Captain Hagberd your son may not even
want to look at me

He flung his head back and laughed his throaty affected cackle of anger

What That boy Not want to look at the only sensible girl for miles
around What do you think I am here for my dearmy dearmy dear
What You wait You just wait Youll see tomorrow Ill soon

Bessie Bessie Bessie howled old Carvil inside Bessiemy pipe
That fat blind man had given himself up to a very lust of laziness He
would not lift his hand to reach for the things she took care to leave
at his very elbow He would not move a limb he would not rise from his
chair he would not put one foot before another in that parlour where
he knew his way as well as if he had his sight without calling her to
his side and hanging all his atrocious weight on her shoulder He would
not eat one single mouthful of food without her close attendance He had
made himself helpless beyond his affliction to enslave her better She
stood still for a moment setting her teeth in the dusk then turned and
walked slowly indoors

Captain Hagberd went back to his spade The shouting in Carvils cottage
stopped and after a while the window of the parlour downstairs was lit
up A man coming from the end of the street with a firm leisurely step
passed on but seemed to have caught sight of Captain Hagberd because
he turned back a pace or two A cold white light lingered in the western
sky The man leaned over the gate in an interested manner

You must be Captain Hagberd he said with easy assurance

The old man spun round pulling out his spade startled by the strange
voice

Yes I am he answered nervously

The other smiling straight at him uttered very slowly Youve been
advertising for your son I believe

My son Harry mumbled Captain Hagberd off his guard for once Hes
coming home tomorrow

The devil he is The stranger marvelled greatly and then went on
with only a slight change of tone Youve grown a beard like Father
Christmas himself

Captain Hagberd drew a little nearer and leaned forward over his
spade Go your way he said resentfully and timidly at the same time
because he was always afraid of being laughed at Every mental
state even madness has its equilibrium based upon selfesteem Its
disturbance causes unhappiness and Captain Hagberd lived amongst a
scheme of settled notions which it pained him to feel disturbed by
peoples grins Yes peoples grins were awful They hinted at something
wrong but what He could not tell and that stranger was obviously
grinninghad come on purpose to grin It was bad enough on the streets
but he had never before been outraged like this

The stranger unaware how near he was of having his head laid open with
a spade said seriously I am not trespassing where I stand am I I
fancy theres something wrong about your news Suppose you let me come
in

_You_ come in murmured old Hagberd with inexpressible horror

I could give you some real information about your sonthe very latest
tip if you care to hear

No shouted Hagberd He began to pace wildly to and fro he shouldered
his spade he gesticulated with his other arm Heres a fellowa
grinning fellow who says theres something wrong Ive got more
information than youre aware of Ive all the information I want
Ive had it for yearsfor yearsfor yearsenough to last me till
tomorrow Let you come in indeed What would Harry say

Bessie Carvils figure appeared in black silhouette on the parlour
window then with the sound of an opening door flitted out before the
other cottage all black but with something white over her head
These two voices beginning to talk suddenly outside she had heard them
indoors had given her such an emotion that she could not utter a sound

Captain Hagberd seemed to be trying to find his way out of a cage His
feet squelched in the puddles left by his industry He stumbled in the
holes of the ruined grassplot He ran blindly against the fence

Here steady a bit said the man at the gate gravely stretching his
arm over and catching him by the sleeve Somebodys been trying to get
at you Hallo whats this rig youve got on Storm canvas by George
He had a big laugh Well you _are_ a character

Captain Hagberd jerked himself free and began to back away shrinkingly
For the present he muttered in a crestfallen tone

Whats the matter with him The stranger addressed Bessie with the
utmost familiarity in a deliberate explanatory tone I didnt want
to startle the old man He lowered his voice as though he had known
her for years I dropped into a barbers on my way to get a twopenny
shave and they told me there he was something of a character The old
man has been a character all his life

Captain Hagberd daunted by the allusion to his clothing had retreated
inside taking his spade with him and the two at the gate startled
by the unexpected slamming of the door heard the bolts being shot the
snapping of the lock and the echo of an affected gurgling laugh within

I didnt want to upset him the man said after a short silence
Whats the meaning of all this He isnt quite crazy

He has been worrying a long time about his lost son said Bessie in a
low apologetic tone

Well I am his son

Harry she criedand was profoundly silent

Know my name Friends with the old man eh

Hes our landlord Bessie faltered out catching hold of the iron
railing

Owns both them rabbithutches does he commented young Hagberd
scornfully just the thing he would be proud of Can you tell me whos
that chap coming tomorrow You must know something of it I tell you
its a swindle on the old mannothing else

She did not answer helpless before an insurmountable difficulty
appalled before the necessity the impossibility and the dread of an
explanation in which she and madness seemed involved together

OhI am so sorry she murmured

Whats the matter he said with serenity You neednt be afraid
of upsetting me Its the other fellow thatll be upset when he least
expects it I dont care a hang but there will be some fun when he
shows his mug tomorrow I dont care _that_ for the old mans pieces
but right is right You shall see me put a head on that coonwhoever he
is

He had come nearer and towered above her on the other side of the
railings He glanced at her hands He fancied she was trembling and it
occurred to him that she had her part perhaps in that little game that
was to be sprung on his old man tomorrow He had come just in time
to spoil their sport He was entertained by the ideascornful of the
baffled plot But all his life he had been full of indulgence for all
sorts of womens tricks She really was trembling very much her wrap
had slipped off her head Poor devil he thought Never mind about
that chap I daresay hell change his mind before tomorrow But what
about me I cant loaf about the gate til the morning

She burst out It is _you_you yourself that hes waiting for It is
_you_ who come tomorrow

He murmured Oh Its me blankly and they seemed to become
breathless together Apparently he was pondering over what he had heard
then without irritation but evidently perplexed he said I dont
understand I hadnt written or anything Its my chum who saw the paper
and told methis very morning Eh what

He bent his ear she whispered rapidly and he listened for a while
muttering the words yes and I see at times Then But why wont
today do he queried at last

You didnt understand me she exclaimed impatiently The clear
streak of light under the clouds died out in the west Again he stooped
slightly to hear better and the deep night buried everything of the
whispering woman and the attentive man except the familiar contiguity
of their faces with its air of secrecy and caress

He squared his shoulders the broadbrimmed shadow of a hat sat
cavalierly on his head Awkward this eh he appealed to her
Tomorrow Well well Never heard tell of anything like this Its all
tomorrow then without any sort of today as far as I can see

She remained still and mute

And you have been encouraging this funny notion he said

I never contradicted him

Why didnt you

What for should I she defended herself It would only have made him
miserable He would have gone out of his mind

His mind he muttered and heard a short nervous laugh from her

Where was the harm Was I to quarrel with the poor old man It was
easier to half believe it myself

Aye aye he meditated intelligently I suppose the old chap got
around you somehow with his soft talk You are goodhearted

Her hands moved up in the dark nervously And it might have been true
It was true It has come Here it is This is the tomorrow we have been
waiting for

She drew a breath and he said goodhumouredly Aye with the door
shut I wouldnt care if And you think he could be brought round
to recognise me Eh What You could do it In a week you
say Hm I daresay you couldbut do you think I could hold out a
week in this deadalive place Not me I want either hard work or an
allfired racket or more space than there is in the whole of England I
have been in this place though once before and for more than a week
The old man was advertising for me then and a chum I had with me had
a notion of getting a couple quid out of him by writing a lot of silly
nonsense in a letter That lark did not come off though We had to
clear outand none too soon But this time Ive a chum waiting for me
in London and besides

Bessie Carvil was breathing quickly

What if I tried a knock at the door he suggested

Try she said

Captain Hagberds gate squeaked and the shadow of the son moved on
then stopped with another deep laugh in the throat like the fathers
only soft and gentle thrilling to the womans heart awakening to her
ears

He isnt friskyis he I would be afraid to lay hold of him The chaps
are always telling me I dont know my own strength

Hes the most harmless creature that ever lived she interrupted

You wouldnt say so if you had seen him chasing me upstairs with a hard
leather strap he said I havent forgotten it in sixteen years

She got warm from head to foot under another soft subdued laugh At the
rattattat of the knocker her heart flew into her mouth

Hey dad Let me in I am Harry I am Straight Come back home a day
too soon

One of the windows upstairs ran up

A grinning information fellow said the voice of old Hagberd up in
the darkness Dont you have anything to do with him It will spoil
everything

She heard Harry Hagberd say Hallo dad then a clanging clatter The
window rumbled down and he stood before her again

Its just like old times Nearly walloped the life out of me to stop me
going away and now I come back he throws a confounded shovel at my head
to keep me out It grazed my shoulder

She shuddered

I wouldnt care he began only I spent my last shillings on the
railway fare and my last twopence on a shaveout of respect for the old
man

Are you really Harry Hagberd she asked Can you prove it

Can I prove it Can any one else prove it he said jovially Prove
with what What do I want to prove There isnt a single corner in the
world barring England perhaps where you could not find some man or
more likely woman that would remember me for Harry Hagberd I am more
like Harry Hagberd than any man alive and I can prove it to you in a
minute if you will let me step inside your gate

Come in she said

He entered then the front garden of the Carvils His tall shadow strode
with a swagger she turned her back on the window and waited watching
the shape of which the footfalls seemed the most material part The
light fell on a tilted hat a powerful shoulder that seemed to cleave
the darkness on a leg stepping out He swung about and stood still
facing the illuminated parlour window at her back turning his head from
side to side laughing softly to himself

Just fancy for a minute the old mans beard stuck on to my chin Hey
Now say I was the very spit of him from a boy

Its true she murmured to herself

And thats about as far as it goes He was always one of your domestic
characters Why I remember how he used to go about looking very sick
for three days before he had to leave home on one of his trips to South
Shields for coal He had a standing charter from the gasworks You
would think he was off on a whaling cruisethree years and a tail Ha
ha Not a bit of it Ten days on the outside The Skimmer of the Seas
was a smart craft Fine name wasnt it Mothers uncle owned her

He interrupted himself and in a lowered voice Did he ever tell you
what mother died of he asked

Yes said Miss Bessie bitterly from impatience

He made no sound for a while then brusquely They were so afraid I
would turn out badly that they fairly drove me away Mother nagged at me
for being idle and the old man said he would cut my soul out of my
body rather than let me go to sea Well it looked as if he would do it
tooso I went It looks to me sometimes as if I had been born to them
by a mistakein that other hutch of a house

Where ought you to have been born by rights Bessie Carvil interrupted
him defiantly

In the open upon a beach on a windy night he said quick as
lightning Then he mused slowly They were characters both of them by
George and the old man keeps it up welldont he A damned shovel on
theHark whos that making that row Bessie Bessie Its in your
house

Its for me she said with indifference

He stepped aside out of the streak of light Your husband he
inquired with the tone of a man accustomed to unlawful trysts Fine
voice for a ships deck in a thundering squall

No my father I am not married

You seem a fine girl Miss Bessie dear he said at once

She turned her face away

Oh I saywhats up Whos murdering him

He wants his tea She faced him still and tall with averted head
with her hands hanging clasped before her

Hadnt you better go in he suggested after watching for a while the
nape of her neck a patch of dazzling white skin and soft shadow above
the sombre line of her shoulders Her wrap had slipped down to her
elbows Youll have all the town coming out presently Ill wait here a
bit

Her wrap fell to the ground and he stooped to pick it up she had
vanished He threw it over his arm and approaching the window squarely
he saw a monstrous form of a fat man in an armchair an unshaded lamp
the yawning of an enormous mouth in a big flat face encircled by a
ragged halo of hairMiss Bessies head and bust The shouting stopped
the blind ran down He lost himself in thinking how awkward it was
Father mad no getting into the house No money to get back a hungry
chum in London who would begin to think he had been given the goby
Damn he muttered He could break the door in certainly but
they would perhaps bundle him into chokey for that without asking
questionsno great matter only he was confoundedly afraid of being
locked up even in mistake He turned cold at the thought He stamped
his feet on the sodden grass

What are youa sailor said an agitated voice

She had flitted out a shadow herself attracted by the reckless shadow
waiting under the wall of her home

Anything Enough of a sailor to be worth my salt before the mast Came
home that way this time

Where do you come from she asked

Right away from a jolly good spree he said by the London
trainsee Ough I hate being shut up in a train I dont mind a house
so much

Ah she said thats lucky

Because in a house you can at any time open the blamed door and walk
away straight before you

And never come back

Not for sixteen years at least he laughed To a rabbit hutch and
get a confounded old shovel

A ship is not so very big she taunted

No but the sea is great

She dropped her head and as if her ears had been opened to the voices
of the world she heard beyond the rampart of seawall the swell
of yesterdays gale breaking on the beach with monotonous and solemn
vibrations as if all the earth had been a tolling bell

And then why a ships a ship You love her and leave her and a
voyage isnt a marriage He quoted the sailors saying lightly

It is not a marriage she whispered

I never took a false name and Ive never yet told a lie to a woman
What lie Why _the_ lie Take me or leave me I say and if you take
me then it is He hummed a snatch very low leaning against the
wall

 Oh ho ho Rio
 And fare thee well
 My bonnie young girl
 Were bound to Rio Grande

Capstan song he explained Her teeth chattered

You are cold he said Heres that affair of yours I picked up She
felt his hands about her wrapping her closely Hold the ends together
in front he commanded

What did you come here for she asked repressing a shudder

Five quid he answered promptly We let our spree go on a little too
long and got hard up

Youve been drinking she said

Blind three days on purpose I am not given that waydont you think
Theres nothing and nobody that can get over me unless I like I can be
as steady as a rock My chum sees the paper this morning and says he to
me Go on Harry loving parent Thats five quid sure So we scraped
all our pockets for the fare Devil of a lark

You have a hard heart I am afraid she sighed

What for For running away Why he wanted to make a lawyers clerk of
mejust to please himself Master in his own house and my poor mother
egged him onfor my good I suppose Well thenso long and I went
No I tell you the day I cleared out I was all black and blue from his
great fondness for me Ah he was always a bit of a character Look at
that shovel now Off his chump Not much Thats just exactly like my
dad He wants me here just to have somebody to order about However
we two were hard up and whats five quid to himonce in sixteen hard
years

Oh but I am sorry for you Did you never want to come back home

Be a lawyers clerk and rot herein some such place as this he cried
in contempt What if the old man set me up in a home today I would
kick it down about my earsor else die there before the third day was
out

And where else is it that you hope to die

In the bush somewhere in the sea on a blamed mountaintop for choice
At home Yes the worlds my home but I expect Ill die in a hospital
some day What of that Any place is good enough as long as Ive lived
and Ive been everything you can think of almost but a tailor or a
soldier Ive been a boundary rider Ive sheared sheep and humped my
swag and harpooned a whale Ive rigged ships and prospected for gold
and skinned dead bullocksand turned my back on more money than the
old man would have scraped in his whole life Ha ha

He overwhelmed her She pulled herself together and managed to utter
Time to rest now

He straightened himself up away from the wall and in a severe voice
said Time to go

But he did not move He leaned back again and hummed thoughtfully a bar
or two of an outlandish tune

She felt as if she were about to cry Thats another of your cruel
songs she said

Learned it in Mexicoin Sonora He talked easily It is the song of
the Gambucinos You dont know The song of restless men Nothing could
hold them in one placenot even a woman You used to meet one of them
now and again in the old days on the edge of the gold country away
north there beyond the Rio Gila Ive seen it A prospecting engineer
in Mazatlan took me along with him to help look after the waggons
A sailors a handy chap to have about you anyhow Its all a
desert cracks in the earth that you cant see the bottom of and
mountainssheer rocks standing up high like walls and church spires
only a hundred times bigger The valleys are full of boulders and black
stones Theres not a blade of grass to see and the sun sets more red
over that country than I have seen it anywherebloodred and angry It
_is_ fine

You do not want to go back there again she stammered out

He laughed a little No Thats the blamed gold country It gave me the
shivers sometimes to look at itand we were a big lot of men together
mind but these Gambucinos wandered alone They knew that country before
anybody had ever heard of it They had a sort of gift for prospecting
and the fever of it was on them too and they did not seem to want the
gold very much They would find some rich spot and then turn their
backs on it pick up perhaps a littleenough for a spreeand then be
off again looking for more They never stopped long where there were
houses they had no wife no chick no home never a chum You couldnt
be friends with a Gambucino they were too restlesshere today and
gone God knows where tomorrow They told no one of their finds and
there has never been a Gambucino well off It was not for the gold they
cared it was the wandering about looking for it in the stony country
that got into them and wouldnt let them rest so that no woman yet born
could hold a Gambucino for more than a week Thats what the song says
Its all about a pretty girl that tried hard to keep hold of a Gambucino
lover so that he should bring her lots of gold No fear Off he went
and she never saw him again

What became of her she breathed out

The song dont tell Cried a bit I daresay They were the fellows
kiss and go But its the looking for a thinga something
Sometimes I think I am a sort of Gambucino myself

No woman can hold you then she began in a brazen voice which
quavered suddenly before the end

No longer than a week he joked playing upon her very heartstrings
with the gay tender note of his laugh and yet I am fond of them all
Anything for a woman of the right sort The scrapes they got me into
and the scrapes they got me out of I love them at first sight Ive
fallen in love with you already MissBessies your nameeh

She backed away a little and with a trembling laugh

You havent seen my face yet

He bent forward gallantly A little pale it suits some But you are a
fine figure of a girl Miss Bessie

She was all in a flutter Nobody had ever said so much to her before

His tone changed I am getting middling hungry though Had no
breakfast today Couldnt you scare up some bread from that tea for me
or

She was gone already He had been on the point of asking her to let him
come inside No matter Anywhere would do Devil of a fix What would
his chum think

I didnt ask you as a beggar he said jestingly taking a piece
of breadandbutter from the plate she held before him I asked as a
friend My dad is rich you know

He starves himself for your sake

And I have starved for his whim he said taking up another piece

All he has in the world is for you she pleaded

Yes if I come here to sit on it like a dam toad in a hole Thank you
and what about the shovel eh He always had a queer way of showing his
love

I could bring him round in a week she suggested timidly

He was too hungry to answer her and holding the plate submissively to
his hand she began to whisper up to him in a quick panting voice
He listened amazed eating slower and slower till at last his jaws
stopped altogether Thats his game is it he said in a rising tone
of scathing contempt An ungovernable movement of his arm sent the plate
flying out of her fingers He shot out a violent curse

She shrank from him putting her hand against the wall

No he raged He expects Expects _me_for his rotten money
Who wants his home Madnot he Dont you think He wants his own way
He wanted to turn me into a miserable lawyers clerk and now he wants
to make of me a blamed tame rabbit in a cage Of me Of me His subdued
angry laugh frightened her now

The whole world aint a bit too big for me to spread my elbows in I
can tell youwhats your nameBessielet alone a dam parlour in a
hutch Marry He wants me to marry and settle And as likely as not he
has looked out the girl toodash my soul And do you know the Judy may
I ask

She shook all over with noiseless dry sobs but he was fuming and
fretting too much to notice her distress He bit his thumb with rage at
the mere idea A window rattled up

A grinning information fellow pronounced old Hagberd dogmatically
in measured tones And the sound of his voice seemed to Bessie to make
the night itself madto pour insanity and disaster on the earth Now
I know whats wrong with the people here my dear Why of course
With this mad chap going about Dont you have anything to do with him
Bessie Bessie I say

They stood as if dumb The old man fidgeted and mumbled to himself at
the window Suddenly he cried piercingly BessieI see you Ill tell
Harry

She made a movement as if to run away but stopped and raised her hands
to her temples Young Hagberd shadowy and big stirred no more than a
man of bronze Over their heads the crazy night whimpered and scolded in
an old mans voice

Send him away my dear Hes only a vagabond What you want is a good
home of your own That chap has no homehes not like Harry He cant
be Harry Harry is coming tomorrow Do you hear One day more he
babbled more excitedly never you fearHarry shall marry you

His voice rose very shrill and mad against the regular deep soughing of
the swell coiling heavily about the outer face of the seawall

He will have to I shall make him or if nothe swore a great
oathIll cut him off with a shilling tomorrow and leave everything
to you I shall To you Let him starve

The window rattled down

Harry drew a deep breath and took one step toward Bessie So its
youthe girl he said in a lowered voice She had not moved and she
remained half turned away from him pressing her head in the palms of
her hands My word he continued with an invisible halfsmile on his
lips I have a great mind to stop

Her elbows were trembling violently

For a week he finished without a pause

She clapped her hands to her face

He came up quite close and took hold of her wrists gently She felt his
breath on her ear

Its a scrape I am inthis and it is you that must see me through
He was trying to uncover her face She resisted He let her go then and
stepping back a little Have you got any money he asked I must be
off now

She nodded quickly her shamefaced head and he waited looking away from
her while trembling all over and bowing her neck she tried to find
the pocket of her dress

Here it is she whispered Oh go away go away for Gods sake If I
had moremoreI would give it all to forgetto make you forget

He extended his hand No fear I havent forgotten a single one of you
in the world Some gave me more than moneybut I am a beggar nowand
you women always had to get me out of my scrapes

He swaggered up to the parlour window and in the dim light filtering
through the blind looked at the coin lying in his palm It was a
halfsovereign He slipped it into his pocket She stood a little on
one side with her head drooping as if wounded with her arms hanging
passive by her side as if dead

You cant buy me in he said and you cant buy yourself out

He set his hat firmly with a little tap and next moment she felt
herself lifted up in the powerful embrace of his arms Her feet lost the
ground her head hung back he showered kisses on her face with a silent
and overmastering ardour as if in haste to get at her very soul He
kissed her pale cheeks her hard forehead her heavy eyelids her faded
lips and the measured blows and sighs of the rising tide accompanied
the enfolding power of his arms the overwhelming might of his caresses
It was as if the sea breaking down the wall protecting all the homes
of the town had sent a wave over her head It passed on she staggered
backwards with her shoulders against the wall exhausted as if she had
been stranded there after a storm and a shipwreck

She opened her eyes after awhile and listening to the firm leisurely
footsteps going away with their conquest began to gather her skirts
staring all the time before her Suddenly she darted through the open
gate into the dark and deserted street

Stop she shouted Dont go

And listening with an attentive poise of the head she could not tell
whether it was the beat of the swell or his fateful tread that seemed
to fall cruelly upon her heart Presently every sound grew fainter as
though she were slowly turning into stone A fear of this awful silence
came to herworse than the fear of death She called upon her ebbing
strength for the final appeal

Harry

Not even the dying echo of a footstep Nothing The thundering of the
surf the voice of the restless sea itself seemed stopped There was
not a soundno whisper of life as though she were alone and lost in
that stony country of which she had heard where madmen go looking for
gold and spurn the find

Captain Hagberd inside his dark house had kept on the alert A window
ran up and in the silence of the stony country a voice spoke above
her head high up in the black airthe voice of madness lies and
despairthe voice of inextinguishable hope Is he gone yetthat
information fellow Do you hear him about my dear

She burst into tears No no no I dont hear him any more she
sobbed

He began to chuckle up there triumphantly You frightened him away
Good girl Now we shall be all right Dont you be impatient my dear
One day more

In the other house old Carvil wallowing regally in his armchair with
a globe lamp burning by his side on the table yelled for her in a
fiendish voice Bessie Bessie you Bessie

She heard him at last and as if overcome by fate began to totter
silently back toward her stuffy little inferno of a cottage It had no
lofty portal no terrific inscription of forfeited hopesshe did not
understand wherein she had sinned

Captain Hagberd had gradually worked himself into a state of noisy
happiness up there

Go in Keep quiet she turned upon him tearfully from the doorstep
below

He rebelled against her authority in his great joy at having got rid at
last of that something wrong It was as if all the hopeful madness of
the world had broken out to bring terror upon her heart with the voice
of that old man shouting of his trust in an everlasting tomorrow

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
