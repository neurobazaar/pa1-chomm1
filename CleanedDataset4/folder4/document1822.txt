THE AMATEUR


By Richard Harding Davis




I


It was February off the Banks and so thick was the weather that on
the upper decks one could have driven a sleigh Inside the smokingroom
Austin Ford as securely sheltered from the blizzard as though he had
been sitting in front of a wood fire at his club ordered hot gin for
himself and the ships doctor The ships doctor had gone below on
another hurry call from the widow At the first luncheon on board the
widow had sat on the right of Doctor Sparrow with Austin Ford facing
her But since then except to the doctor she had been invisible So
at frequent intervals the ill health of the widow had deprived Ford of
the society of the doctor That it deprived him also of the society
of the widow did not concern him HER life had not been spent upon ocean
liners she could not remember when staterooms were named after the
States of the Union She could not tell him of shipwrecks and salvage
of smugglers and of the modern pirates who found their victims in the
smokingroom

Ford was on his way to England to act as the London correspondent of the
New York Republic For three years on that most sensational of the New
York dailies he had been the star man the chief muckraker the chief
sleuth His interest was in crime Not in crimes committed in passion or
inspired by drink but in such offences against law and society as
are perpetrated with nice intelligence The murderer the burglar the
strongarm men who in side streets waylay respectable citizens did not
appeal to him The man he studied pursued and exposed was the cashier
who evolved a new method of covering up his peculations the dishonest
president of an insurance company the confidence man who used no
concealed weapon other than his wit Toward the criminals he pursued
young Ford felt no personal animosity He harassed them as he would
have shot a hawk killing chickens Not because he disliked the hawk
but because the battle was unequal and because he felt sorry for the
chickens

Had you called Austin Ford an amateur detective he would have been
greatly annoyed He argued that his position was similar to that of
the dramatic critic The dramatic critic warned the public against bad
plays Ford warned it against bad men Having done that he left it to
the public to determine whether the bad man should thrive or perish

When the managing editor told him of his appointment to London Ford had
protested that his work lay in New York that of London and the English
except as a tourist and sightseer he knew nothing

Thats just why we are sending you explained the managing editor
Our readers are ignorant To make them read about London youve got
to tell them about themselves in London They like to know whos been
presented at court about the American girls who have married dukes and
which ones opened a bazaar and which one opened a hat shop and which
is getting a divorce Dont send us anything concerning suffragettes and
Dreadnaughts Just send us stuff about Americans If you take your meals
in the Carlton grillroom and drink at the Cecil you can pick up more
good stories than we can print You will find lots of your friends over
there Some of those girls who married dukes he suggested know you
dont they

Not since they married dukes said Ford

Well anyway all your other friends will be there continued the
managing editor encouragingly Now that they have shut up the tracks
here all the con men have gone to London They say an American cant
take a drink at the Salisbury without his fellowcountrymen having a
fight as to which one will sell him a gold brick

Fords eyes lightened in pleasurable anticipation

Look them over urged the managing editor and send us a special
Call it The American Invasion Dont you see a story in it

It will be the first one I send you said Ford The ships doctor
returned from his visit below decks and sank into the leather cushion
close to Fords elbow For a few moments the older man sipped doubtfully
at his gin and water and as though perplexed rubbed his hand over his
bald and shining head I told her to talk to you he said fretfully

Her Who inquired Ford Oh the widow

You were right about that said Doctor Sparrow she is not a widow

The reporter smiled complacently

Do you know why I thought not he demanded Because all the time she
was at luncheon she kept turning over her weddingring as though she was
not used to it It was a new ring too I told you then she was not a
widow

Do you always notice things like that asked the doctor

Not on purpose said the amateur detective I cant help it I see
ten things where other people see only one just as some men run ten
times as fast as other men We have tried it out often at the office
put all sorts of junk under a newspaper lifted the newspaper for five
seconds and then each man wrote down what he had seen Out of twenty
things I would remember seventeen The next best guess would be about
nine Once I saw a man lift his coat collar to hide his face It was in
the Grand Central Station I stopped him and told him he was wanted
Turned out he WAS wanted It was Goldberg making his getaway to
Canada

It is a gift said the doctor

No its a nuisance laughed the reporter I see so many things I
dont want to see I see that people are wearing clothes that are not
made for them I see when women are lying to me I can see when men are
on the verge of a nervous breakdown and whether it is drink or debt or
morphine

The doctor snorted triumphantly

You did not see that the widow was on the verge of a breakdown

No returned the reporter Is she Im sorry

If youre sorry urged the doctor eagerly youll help her She is
going to London alone to find her husband He has disappeared She
thinks that he has been murdered or that he is lying ill in some
hospital I told her if any one could help her to find him you could I
had to say something Shes very ill

To find her husband in London repeated Ford London is a large
town

She has photographs of him and she knows where he spends his time
pleaded the doctor He is a company promoter It should be easy for
you

Maybe he doesnt want her to find him said Ford Then it wouldnt be
so easy for me

The old doctor sighed heavily I know he murmured I thought of
that too And she is so very pretty

That was another thing I noticed said Ford

The doctor gave no heed

She must stop worrying he exclaimed or she will have a mental
collapse I have tried sedatives but they dont touch her I want to
give her courage She is frightened Shes left a baby boy at home and
shes fearful that something will happen to him and shes frightened
at being at sea frightened at being alone in London its pitiful The
old man shook his head Pitiful Will you talk to her now he asked

Nonsense exclaimed Ford She doesnt want to tell the story of her
life to strange young men

But it was she suggested it cried the doctor She asked me if you
were Austin Ford the great detective

Ford snorted scornfully She did not he protested His tone was that
of a man who hopes to be contradicted

But she did insisted the doctor and I told her your specialty was
tracing persons Her face lightened at once it gave her hope She will
listen to you Speak very gently and kindly and confidently Say you are
sure you can find him

Where is the lady now asked Ford

Doctor Sparrow scrambled eagerly to his feet She cannot leave her
cabin he answered

The widow as Ford and Doctor Sparrow still thought of her was lying on
the sofa that ran the length of the stateroom parallel with the lower
berth She was fully dressed except that instead of her bodice she wore
a kimono that left her throat and arms bare She had been sleeping
and when their entrance awoke her her blue eyes regarded them
uncomprehendingly Ford hidden from her by the doctor observed that
not only was she very pretty but that she was absurdly young and
that the drowsy smile she turned upon the old man before she noted the
presence of Ford was as innocent as that of a baby Her cheeks were
flushed her eyes brilliant her yellow curls had become loosened and
were spread upon the pillow When she saw Ford she caught the kimono so
closely around her throat that she choked Had the doctor not pushed her
down she would have stood

I thought she stammered he was an OLD man

The doctor misunderstanding hastened to reassure her Mr Ford is old
in experience he said soothingly He has had remarkable success
Why he found a criminal once just because the man wore a collar And
he found Walsh the burglar and Phillips the forger and a gang of
counterfeiters

Mrs Ashton turned upon him her eyes wide with wonder But MY
husband she protested is not a criminal

My dear lady the doctor cried I did not mean that of course not I
meant if Mr Ford can find men who dont wish to be found how easy for
him to find a man who He turned helplessly to Ford You tell her
he begged

Ford sat down on a steamer trunk that protruded from beneath the berth
and turning to the widow gave her the full benefit of his working
smile It was confiding helpless appealing It showed a trustfulness
in the person to whom it was addressed that caused that individual to
believe Ford needed protection from a wicked world

Doctor Sparrow tells me began Ford timidly you have lost your
husbands address that you will let me try to find him If I can help
in any way I should be glad

The young girl regarded him apparently with disappointment It was
as though Doctor Sparrow had led her to expect a man full of years
and authority a man upon whom she could lean not a youth whose smile
seemed to beg one not to scold him She gave Ford three photographs
bound together with a string

When Doctor Sparrow told me you could help me I got out these she
said

Ford jotted down a mental note to the effect that she got them out
That is she did not keep them where she could always look at them That
she was not used to look at them was evident by the fact that they were
bound together

The first photograph showed three men standing in an open place and
leaning on a railing One of them was smiling toward the photographer
He was a goodlooking young man of about thirty years of age well fed
well dressed and apparently well satisfied with the world and himself
Fords own smile had disappeared His eyes were alert and interested

The one with the Panama hat pulled down over his eyes is your husband
he asked

Yes assented the widow Her tone showed slight surprise

This was taken about a year ago inquired Ford Must have been he
answered himself they havent raced at the Bay since then This was
taken in front of the club standprobably for the Telegraph He lifted
his eyes inquiringly

Rising on her elbow the young wife bent forward toward the photograph
Does it say that there she asked doubtfully How did you guess
that

In his role as chorus the ships doctor exclaimed with enthusiasm
Didnt I tell you Hes wonderful

Ford cut him off impatiently You never saw a rail as high as
that except around a racetrack he muttered And the badge in his
buttonhole and the angle of the stand all show

He interrupted himself to address the widow This is an owners badge
What was the name of his stable

I dont know she answered She regarded the young man with sudden
uneasiness They only owned one horse but I believe that gave them the
privilege of

I see exclaimed Ford Your husband is a bookmaker But in London he
is a promoter of companies

So my friend tells me said Mrs Ashton Shes just got back from
London Her husband told her that Harry my husband was always at the
American bar in the Cecil or at the Salisbury or the Savoy The girl
shook her head But a woman cant go looking for a man there she
protested Thats why I thought you

Thatll be all right Ford assured her hurriedly Its a coincidence
but it happens that my own work takes me to these hotels and if your
husband is there I will find him He returned the photographs

Hadnt you better keep one she asked

I wont forget him said the reporter Besideshe turned his eyes
toward the doctor and as though thinking aloud saidhe may have
grown a beard

There was a pause

The eyes of the woman grew troubled Her lips pressed together as though
in a sudden access of pain

And he may Ford continued have changed his name

As though fearful if she spoke the tears would fall the girl nodded
her head stiffly

Having learned what he wanted to know Ford applied to the wound a
soothing ointment of promises and encouragement

Hes as good as found he protested You will see him in a day two
days after you land

The girls eyes opened happily She clasped her hands together and
raised them

You will try she begged You will find him for meshe corrected
herself eagerlyfor me and the baby

The loose sleeves of the kimono fell back to her shoulders showing the
white arms the eyes raised to Ford were glistening with tears

Of course I will find him growled the reporter

He freed himself from the appeal in the eyes of the young mother
and left the cabin The doctor followed He was bubbling over with
enthusiasm

That was fine he cried You said just the right thing There will be
no collapse now

His satisfaction was swept away in a burst of disgust

The blackguard he protested To desert a wife as young as that and
as pretty as that

So I have been thinking said the reporter I guess he added
gravely what is going to happen is that before I find her husband I
will have got to know him pretty well

Apparently young Mrs Ashton believed everything would come to pass
just as Ford promised it would and as he chose to order it for the next
day with a color not born of fever in her cheeks and courage in
her eyes she joined Ford and the doctor at the luncheontable Her
attention was concentrated on the younger man In him she saw the one
person who could bring her husband to her

She acts growled the doctor later in the smokingroom as though
she was afraid you were going to back out of your promise and jump
overboard

Dont think he protested violently its you shes interested in
All she sees in you is what you can do for her Can you see that

Any one as clever at seeing things as I am returned the reporter
cannot help but see that

Later as Ford was walking on the upper deck Mrs Ashton came toward
him beating her way against the wind Without a trace of coquetry or
selfconsciousness and with a sigh of content she laid her hand on his
arm

When I dont see you she exclaimed as simply as a child I feel so
frightened When I see you I know all will come right Do you mind if I
walk with you she asked And do you mind if every now and then I ask
you to tell me again it will all come right

For the three days following Mrs Ashton and Ford were constantly
together Or at least Mrs Ashton was constantly with Ford She told
him that when she sat in her cabin the old fears returned to her and in
these moments of panic she searched the ship for him

The doctor protested that he was growing jealous

Im not so greatly to be envied suggested Ford Harry at
meals three times a day and on deck all the rest of the day becomes
monotonous On a closer acquaintance with Harry he seems to be a decent
sort of a young man at least he seems to have been at one time very
much in love with her

Well sighed the doctor sentimentally she is certainly very much in
love with Harry

Ford shook his head noncommittingly I dont know her story he said
Dont want to know it

The ship was in the channel on her way to Cherbourg and running as
smoothly as a clock From the shore friendly lights told them they were
nearing their journeys end that the land was on every side Seated
on a steamerchair next to his in the semidarkness of the deck Mrs
Ashton began to talk nervously and eagerly

Now that we are so near she murmured I have got to tell you
something If you did not know I would feel I had not been fair You
might think that when you were doing so much for me I should have been
more honest

She drew a long breath Its so hard she said

Wait commanded Ford Is it going to help me to find him

No

Then dont tell me

His tone caused the girl to start She leaned toward him and peered
into his face His eyes as he looked back to her were kind and
comprehending

You mean said the amateur detective that your husband has deserted
you That if it were not for the baby you would not try to find him Is
that it

Mrs Ashton breathed quickly and turned her face away

Yes she whispered That is it

There was a long pause When she faced him again the fact that there was
no longer a secret between them seemed to give her courage

Maybe she said you can understand Maybe you can tell me what it
means I have thought and thought I have gone over it and over it until
when I go back to it my head aches I have done nothing else but think
and I cant make it seem better I cant find any excuse I have had no
one to talk to no one I could tell I have thought maybe a man could
understand She raised her eyes appealingly

If you can only make it seem less cruel Dont you see she cried
miserably I want to believe I want to forgive him I want to think he
loves me Oh I want so to be able to love him but how can I I cant
I cant

In the week in which they had been thrown together the girl
unconsciously had told Ford much about herself and her husband What she
now told him was but an amplification of what he had guessed

She had met Ashton a year and a half before when she had just left
school at the convent and had returned to live with her family Her home
was at Far Rockaway Her father was a cashier in a bank at Long Island
City One night with a party of friends she had been taken to a dance
at one of the beach hotels and there met Ashton At that time he was
one of a firm that was making book at the Aqueduct racetrack The girl
had met very few men and with them was shy and frightened but with
Ashton she found herself at once at ease That night he drove her and
her friends home in his touringcar and the next day they teased her
about her conquest It made her very happy After that she went to hops
at the hotel and as the bookmaker did not dance the two young people
sat upon the piazza Then Ashton came to see her at her own house but
when her father learned that the young man who had been calling upon her
was a bookmaker he told him he could not associate with his daughter

But the girl was now deeply in love with Ashton and apparently he with
her He begged her to marry him They knew that to this partly from
prejudice and partly owing to his position in the bank her father would
object Accordingly they agreed that in August when the racing moved to
Saratoga they would run away and get married at that place Their plan
was that Ashton would leave for Saratoga with the other racing men and
that she would join him the next day

They had arranged to be married by a magistrate and Ashton had shown
her a letter from one at Saratoga who consented to perform the ceremony
He had given her an engagement ring and two thousand dollars which he
asked her to keep for him lest tempted at the track he should lose it

But she assured Ford it was not such material things as a letter a
ring or gift of money that had led her to trust Ashton His fear of
losing her his complete subjection to her wishes his happiness in her
presence all seemed to prove that to make her happy was his one wish
and that he could do anything to make her unhappy appeared impossible

They were married the morning she arrived at Saratoga and the same day
departed for Niagara Falls and Quebec The honeymoon lasted ten days
They were ten days of complete happiness No one so the girl declared
could have been more kind more unselfishly considerate than her
husband They returned to Saratoga and engaged a suite of rooms at one
of the big hotels Ashton was not satisfied with the rooms shown him
and leaving her upstairs returned to the office floor to ask for others

Since that moment his wife had never seen him nor heard from him

On the day of her marriage young Mrs Ashton had written to her father
asking him to give her his good wishes and pardon He refused both As
she had feared he did not consider that for a bank clerk a gambler made
a desirable soninlaw and the letters he wrote his daughter were
so bitter that in reply she informed him he had forced her to choose
between her family and her husband and that she chose her husband
In consequence when she found herself deserted she felt she could not
return to her people She remained in Saratoga There she moved into
cheap lodgings and in order that the two thousand dollars Ashton
had left with her might be saved for his child she had learned to
typewrite and after four months had been able to support herself
Within the last month a girl friend who had known both Ashton and
herself before they were married had written her that her husband was
living in London For the sake of her son she had at once determined to
make an effort to seek him out

The son nonsense exclaimed the doctor when Ford retold the story
She is not crossing the ocean because she is worried about the future
of her son She seeks her own happiness The woman is in love with her
husband

Ford shook his head

I dont know he objected Shes so extravagant in her praise of
Harry that it seems unreal It sounds insincere Then again when I
swear I will find him she shows a delight that you might describe as
savage almost vindictive As though if I did find Harry the first
thing she would do would be to stick a knife in him

Maybe volunteered the doctor sadly she has heard there is a woman
in the case Maybe she is the one shes thinking of sticking the knife
into

Well declared the reporter if she doesnt stop looking savage every
time I promise to find Harry I wont find Harry Why should I act the
part of Fate anyway How do I know that Harry hasnt got a wife in
London and several in the States How do we know he didnt leave his
country for his countrys good Thats what it looks like to me How can
we tell what confronted him the day he went down to the hotel desk to
change his rooms and instead got into his touringcar and beat the
speed limit to Canada Whom did he meet in the hotel corridor A woman
with a perfectly good marriage certificate or a detective with a
perfectly good warrant Or did Harry find out that his bride had a devil
of a temper of her own and that for him marriage was a failure The
widow is certainly a very charming young woman but there may be two
sides to this

You are a cynic sir protested the doctor

That may be growled the reporter but I am not a private detective
agency or a matrimonial bureau and before I hear myself saying Bless
you my children both of these young people will have to show me why
they should not be kept asunder




II


On the afternoon of their arrival in London Ford convoyed Mrs Ashton to
an oldestablished private hotel in Craven Street

Here he explained you will be within a few hundred yards of the
place in which your husband is said to spend his time I will be living
in the same hotel If I find him you will know it in ten minutes

The widow gave a little gasp whether of excitement or of happiness Ford
could not determine

Whatever happens she begged will you let me hear from you
sometimes You are the only person I know in Londonandits so big it
frightens me I dont want to be a burden she went on eagerly but if
I can feel you are within call

What you need said Ford heartily is less of the doctors nerve
tonic and sleeping draughts and a little innocent diversion Tonight I
am going to take you to the Savoy to supper

Mrs Ashton exclaimed delightedly and then was filled with misgivings

I have nothing to wear she protested and over here in the evening
the women dress so well I have a dinner gown she exclaimed but its
black Would that do

Ford assured her nothing could be better He had a mans vanity in
liking a woman with whom he was seen in public to be pretty and smartly
dressed and he felt sure that in black the blond beauty of Mrs Ashton
would appear to advantage They arranged to meet at eleven on the
promenade leading to the Savoy supperroom and parted with mutual
satisfaction at the prospect


The finding of Harry Ashton was so simple that in its very simplicity it
appeared spectacular

On leaving Mrs Ashton Ford engaged rooms at the Hotel Cecil Before
visiting his rooms he made his way to the American bar He did not go
there seeking Harry Ashton His object was entirely selfcentred His
purpose was to drink to himself and to the lights of London But as
though by appointment the man he had promised to find was waiting for
him As Ford entered the room at a table facing the door sat Ashton
There was no mistaking him He wore a mustache but it was no disguise
He was the same goodnatured goodlooking youth who in the photograph
from under a Panama hat had smiled upon the world With a glad cry Ford
rushed toward him

Fancy meeting YOU he exclaimed

Mr Ashtons goodnatured smile did not relax He merely shook his head

Afraid you have made a mistake he said The reporter regarded him
blankly His face showed his disappointment

Arent you Charles W Garrett of New York he demanded

Not me said Mr Ashton

But Ford insisted in hurt tones as though he were being trifled
with you have been told you look like him havent you

Mr Ashtons good nature was unassailable

Sorry he declared never heard of him

Ford became garrulous he could not believe two men could look so much
alike It was a remarkable coincidence The stranger must certainly
have a drink the drink intended for his twin Ashton was bored but
accepted He was well acquainted with the easy goodfellowship of his
countrymen The room in which he sat was a meetingplace for them He
considered that they were always giving each other drinks and not only
were they always introducing themselves but saying Shake hands with
my friend Mr SoandSo After five minutes they showed each other
photographs of the children This one though as loquacious as the
others seemed better dressed more wise he brought to the exile the
atmosphere of his beloved Broadway so Ashton drank to him pleasantly

My name is Sydney Carter he volunteered

As a pokerplayer skims over the cards in his hand Ford in his minds
eye ran over the value of giving or not giving his right name He
decided that Ashton would not have heard it and that if he gave a false
one there was a chance that later Ashton might find out that he had
done so Accordingly he said Mine is Austin Ford and seated himself
at Ashtons table Within ten minutes the man he had promised to
pluck from among the eight million inhabitants of London was smiling
sympathetically at his jests and buying a drink

On the steamer Ford had rehearsed the story with which should he meet
Ashton he would introduce himself It was one arranged to fit with his
theory that Ashton was a crook If Ashton were a crook Ford argued
that to at once ingratiate himself in his good graces he also must be
a crook His plan was to invite Ashton to cooperate with him in some
scheme that was openly dishonest By so doing he hoped apparently to
place himself at Ashtons mercy He believed if he could persuade Ashton
he was more of a rascal than Ashton himself and an exceedingly
stupid rascal any distrust the bookmaker might feel toward him would
disappear He made his advances so openly and apparently showed his
hand so carelessly that from being bored Ashton became puzzled
then interested and when Ford insisted he should dine with him he
considered it so necessary to find out who the youth might be who was
forcing himself upon him that he accepted the invitation

They adjourned to dress and an hour later at Fords suggestion they
met at the Carlton There Ford ordered a dinner calculated to lull his
newly made friend into a mood suited to confidence but which had on
Ashton exactly the opposite effect Merely for the pleasure of his
company utter strangers were not in the habit of treating him to
strawberries in February and vintage champagne and in consequence in
Fords hospitality he saw only cause for suspicion If as he had first
feared Ford was a New York detective it was most important he should
know that No one better than Ashton understood that at that moment
his presence in New York meant for the police unalloyed satisfaction
and for himself undisturbed solitude But Ford was unlike any detective
of his acquaintance and his acquaintance had been extensive It
was true Ford was familiar with all the habits of Broadway and the
Tenderloin Of places with which Ashton was intimate and of men with
whom Ashton had formerly been well acquainted he talked glibly But if
he were a detective Ashton considered they certainly had improved the
class

The restaurant into which for the first time Ashton had penetrated
and in which he felt ill at ease was to Ford he observed a matter
of course Evidently for Ford it held no terrors He criticised the
service patronized the head waiters and grumbled at the food and
when on leaving the restaurant an Englishman and his wife stopped at
their table to greet him he accepted their welcome to London without
embarrassment

Ashton rolling his cigar between his lips observed the incident with
increasing bewilderment

Youve got some swell friends he growled Ill bet you never met
THEM at Healeys

I meet all kinds of people in my business said Ford I once sold
that man some mining stock and the joke of it was he added smiling
knowingly it turned out to be good

Ashton decided that the psychological moment had arrived

What IS your business he asked

Im a company promoter said Ford easily I thought I told you

I did not tell you that I was a company promoter too did I demanded
Ashton

No answered Ford with apparent surprise Are you Thats funny

Ashton watched for the next move but the subject seemed in no way to
interest Ford Instead of following it up he began afresh

Have you any money lying idle he asked abruptly About a thousand
pounds

Ashton recognized that the mysterious stranger was about to disclose
both himself and whatever object he had in seeking him out He cast a
quick glance about him

I can always find money he said guardedly Whats the proposition

With pretended nervousness Ford leaned forward and began the story
he had rehearsed It was a new version of an old swindle and to every
selfrespecting confidence man was well known as the sick engineer
game The plot is very simple The sick engineer is supposed to be a
mining engineer who as an expert has examined a gold mine and reported
against it For his services the company paid him partly in stock He
falls ill and is at the point of death While he has been ill much gold
has been found in the mine he examined and the stock which he considers
worthless is now valuable Of this owing to his illness he is
ignorant One confidence man acts the part of the sick engineer and the
other that of a broker who knows the engineer possesses the stock but
has no money with which to purchase it from him For a share of the
stock he offers to tell the dupe where it and the engineer can be found
They visit the man apparently at the point of death and the dupe gives
him money for his stock Later the dupe finds the stock is worthless
and the supposed engineer and the supposed broker divide the money he
paid for it In telling the story Ford pretended he was the broker and
that he thought in Ashton he had found a dupe who would buy the stock
from the sick engineer

As the story unfolded and Ashton appreciated the part Ford expected
him to play in it his emotions were so varied that he was in danger
of apoplexy Amusement joy chagrin and indignation illuminated his
countenance His cigar ceased to burn and with his eyes opened wide he
regarded Ford in pitying wonder

Wait he commanded He shook his head uncomprehendingly Tell me he
asked do I look as easy as that or are you just naturally foolish

Ford pretended to fall into a state of great alarm

I dont understand he stammered

Why son exclaimed Ashton kindly I was taught that story in the
public schools I invented it I stopped using it before you cut
your teeth Gee he exclaimed delightedly I knew I had
grown respectablelooking but I didnt think I was so damned
respectablelooking as that He began to laugh silently so greatly was
he amused that the tears shone in his eyes and his shoulders shook

Im sorry for you son he protested but thats the funniest thing
thats come my way in two years And you buying me hothouse grapes
too and fancy water I wish you could see your face he taunted

Ford pretended to be greatly chagrined

All right he declared roughly The laughs on me this time but just
because I lost one trick dont think I dont know my business Now that
Im wise to what YOU are we can work together and

The face of young Mr Ashton became instantly grave His jaws
snapped like a trap When he spoke his tone was assured and slightly
contemptuous

Not with ME you cant work he said

Dont think because I fell down on this Ford began hotly

Im not thinking of you at all said Ashton Youre a nice little
fellow all right but you have sized me up wrong I am on the straight
and narrow that leads back to little old New York and Gods country
and I am warranted not to run off my trolley

The words were in the vernacular but the tone in which the young man
spoke rang so confidently that it brought to Ford a pleasant thrill
of satisfaction From the first he had found in the personality of the
young man something winning and likable a shrewd manliness and tolerant
goodhumor His eyes may have shown his sympathy for in sudden
confidence Ashton leaned nearer

Its like this he said Several years ago I made a bad break and
about a year later they got on to me and I had to cut and run In a
month the law of limitation lets me loose and I can go back And you can
bet Im GOING back I will be on the bowsprit of the first boat Ive
had all I want of the fugitivefromjustice game thank you and I
have taken good care to keep a clean bill of health so that I wont
have to play it again Theyve been trying to get me for several
yearsespecially the Pinkertons They have chased me all over Europe
Chased me with all kinds of men sometimes with women theyve tried
everything except bloodhounds At first I thought YOU were a Pink
thats why

I interrupted Ford exploding derisively Thats GOOD Thats one
on YOU He ceased laughing and regarded Ashton kindly How do you know
Im not he asked

For an instant the face of the bookmaker grew a shade less red and
his eyes searched those of Ford in a quick agony of suspicion Ford
continued to smile steadily at him and Ashton breathed with relief

Ill take a chance with you he said and if you are as bad a
detective as you are a sport I neednt worry

They both laughed and with sudden mutual liking each raised his glass
and nodded

But they havent got me yet continued Ashton and unless they get
me in the next thirty days Im free So you neednt think that Ill help
you Its never again for me The first time that was the fault of
the crowd I ran with the second time that would be MY fault And there
aint going to be any second time

He shook his head doggedly and with squared shoulders leaned back in
his chair

If it only breaks right for me he declared Ill settle down in one
of those Ownyour ownhomes fortyfive minutes from Broadway and
never leave the wife and the baby

The words almost brought Ford to his feet He had forgotten the wife and
the baby He endeavored to explain his surprise by a sudden assumption
of incredulity

Fancy you married he exclaimed

Married protested Ashton Im married to the finest little lady
that ever wore skirts and in thirtyseven days Ill see her again
Thirtyseven days he repeated impatiently Gee Thats a hell of a
long time

Ford studied the young man with increased interest That he was speaking
sincerely from the heart there seemed no possible doubt

Ashton frowned and his face clouded Ive not been able to treat her
just right he volunteered If she wrote me the letters might give
them a clew and I dont write HER because I dont want her to know
all my troubles until theyre over But I know he added that five
minutes talk will set it all right That is if she still feels about
me the way I feel about her

The man crushed his cigar in his fingers and threw the pieces on the
floor Thats whats been the worst he exclaimed bitterly Not
hearing not knowing Its been hell

His eyes as he raised them were filled with suffering deep and genuine

Ford rose suddenly Lets go down to the Savoy for supper he said

Supper growled Ashton Whats the use of supper Do you suppose cold
chicken and a sardine can keep me from THINKING

Ford placed his hand on the others shoulder

You come with me he said kindly Im going to do you a favor Im
going to bring you a piece of luck Dont ask me any questions he
commanded hurriedly Just take my word for it

They had sat so late over their cigars that when they reached the
restaurant on the Embankment the supperroom was already partly
filled and the corridors and lounge were brilliantly lit and gay with
welldressed women Ashton regarded the scene with gloomy eyes Since
he had spoken of his wife he had remained silent chewing savagely on a
fresh cigar But Ford was grandly excited He did not know exactly what
he intended to do He was prepared to let events direct themselves but
of two things he was assured Mrs Ashton loved her husband and her
husband loved her As the god in the car who was to bring them together
he felt a delightful responsibility

The young men left the coatroom and came down the short flight of
steps that leads to the wide lounge of the restaurant Ford slightly in
advance searching with his eyes for Mrs Ashton found her seated alone
in the lounge evidently waiting for him At the first glance she was
hardly be recognized Her lowcut dinner gown of black satin that clung
to her like a wet bath robe was the last word of the new fashion and
since Ford had seen her her blond hair had been arranged by an artist
Her appearance was smart elegant daring She was easily the prettiest
and most strikinglooking woman in the room and for an instant Ford
stood gazing at her trying to find in the selfpossessed young woman
the deserted wife of the steamer She did not see Ford Her eyes were
following the progress down the hall of a woman and her profile was
toward him

The thought of the happiness he was about to bring to two young people
gave Ford the sense of a genuine triumph and when he turned to
Ashton to point out his wife to him he was thrilling with pride and
satisfaction His triumph received a bewildering shock Already Ashton
had discovered the presence of Mrs Ashton He was standing transfixed
lost to his surroundings devouring her with his eyes And then to the
amazement of Ford his eyes filled with fear doubt and anger Swiftly
with the movement of a man ducking a blow he turned and sprang up the
stairs and into the coatroom Ford bewildered and more conscious of
his surroundings followed him less quickly and was in consequence only
in time to see Ashton dragging his overcoat behind him disappear into
the courtyard He seized his own coat and raced in pursuit As he ran
into the courtyard Ashton in the Strand was just closing the door of
a taxicab but before the chauffeur could free it from the surrounding
traffic Ford had dragged the door open and leaped inside Ashton was
huddled in the corner panting his face pale with alarm

What the devil ails you roared Ford Are you trying to shake me
Youve got to come back You must speak to her

Speak to her repeated Ashton His voice was sunk to a whisper The
look of alarm in his face was confused with one grim and menacing Did
you know she was there he demanded softly Did you take me there
knowing

Of course I knew protested Ford Shes been looking for you

His voice subsided in a squeak of amazement and pain Ashtons left hand
had shot out and swiftly seized his throat With the other he pressed an
automatic revolver against Fords shirt front

I know shes been looking for me the man whispered thickly For two
years shes been looking for me I know all about HER But WHO IN HELL
ARE YOU

Ford gasping and gurgling protested loyally

You are wrong he cried Shes been at home waiting for you She
thinks you have deserted her and your baby I tell you she loves you
you fool she LOVES you

The fingers on his throat suddenly relaxed the flaming eyes of Ashton
glaring into his wavered and grew wide with amazement

Loves me he whispered WHO loves me

Your wife protested Ford the girl at the Savoy your wife

Again the fingers of Ashton pressed deep around his neck

That is not my wife he whispered His voice was unpleasantly cold and
grim Thats Baby Belle with her hair dyed a detective lady of the
Pinkertons hired to find me And YOU know it Now who are YOU

To permit him to reply Ashton released his hand but at the same moment
in a sudden access of fear dug the revolver deeper into the pit of
Fords stomach

Quick he commanded Never mind the girl WHO ARE YOU

Ford collapsed against the cushioned corner of the cab And she begged
me to find you he roared because she LOVED you because she wanted
to BELIEVE in you He held his arms above his head Go ahead and
shoot he cried You want to know who I am he demanded His voice
rang with rage Im an amateur Just a natural born foolamateur Go on
and shoot

The gun in Ashtons hand sank to his knee Between doubt and laughter
his face was twisted in strange lines The cab was whirling through a
narrow unlit street leading to Covent Garden Opening the door Ashton
called to the chauffeur and then turned to Ford

You get off here he commanded Maybe youre a Pink maybe youre
a good fellow I think youre a good fellow but Im not taking any
chances Get out

Ford scrambled to the street and as the taxicab again butted itself
forward Ashton leaned far through the window Goodby son he
called Send me a picturepostal card to Paris For I am off to
Maxims he cried and you can go to

Not at all shouted the amateur detective indignantly Im going back
to take supper with Baby Belle
