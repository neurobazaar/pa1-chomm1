I


I thought once how Theocritus had sung
Of the sweet years the dear and wishedfor years
Who each one in a gracious hand appears
To bear a gift for mortals old or young
And as I mused it in his antique tongue
I saw in gradual vision through my tears
The sweet sad years the melancholy years
Those of my own life who by turns had flung
A shadow across me Straightway I was ware
So weeping how a mystic Shape did move
Behind me and drew me backward by the hair
And a voice said in mastery while I strove
Guess now who holds theeDeath I said But there
The silver answer rang Not Death but Love




II


But only three in all Gods universe
Have heard this word thou hast saidHimself beside
Thee speaking and me listening and replied
One of us    that was God    and laid the curse
So darkly on my eyelids as to amerce
My sight from seeing theethat if I had died
The deathweights placed there would have signified
Less absolute exclusion Nay is worse
From God than from all others O my friend
Men could not part us with their worldly jars
Nor the seas change us nor the tempests bend
Our hands would touch for all the mountainbars
And heaven being rolled between us at the end
We should but vow the faster for the stars




III


Unlike are we unlike O princely Heart
Unlike our uses and our destinies
Our ministering two angels look surprise
On one another as they strike athwart
Their wings in passing Thou bethink thee art
A guest for queens to social pageantries
With gages from a hundred brighter eyes
Than tears even can make mine to play thy part
Of chief musician What hast thou to do
With looking from the latticelights at me
A poor tired wandering singer singing through
The dark and leaning up a cypress tree
The chrism is on thine headon mine the dew
And Death must dig the level where these agree




IV


Thou hast thy calling to some palacefloor
Most gracious singer of high poems where
The dancers will break footing from the care
Of watching up thy pregnant lips for more
And dost thou lift this houses latch too poor
For hand of thine and canst thou think and bear
To let thy music drop here unaware
In folds of golden fulness at my door
Look up and see the casement broken in
The bats and owlets builders in the roof
My cricket chirps against thy mandolin
Hush call no echo up in further proof
Of desolation theres a voice within
That weeps    as thou must sing    alone aloof




V


I lift my heavy heart up solemnly
As once Electra her sepulchral urn
And looking in thine eyes I overturn
The ashes at thy feet Behold and see
What a great heap of grief lay hid in me
And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn
Through the ashen greyness If thy foot in scorn
Could tread them out to darkness utterly
It might be well perhaps But if instead
Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow
The grey dust up    those laurels on thine head
O my Beloved will not shield thee so
That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred
The hair beneath Stand further off then go




VI


Go from me Yet I feel that I shall stand
Henceforward in thy shadow Nevermore
Alone upon the threshold of my door
Of individual life I shall command
The uses of my soul nor lift my hand
Serenely in the sunshine as before
Without the sense of that which I forbore
Thy touch upon the palm The widest land
Doom takes to part us leaves thy heart in mine
With pulses that beat double What I do
And what I dream include thee as the wine
Must taste of its own grapes And when I sue
God for myself He hears that name of thine
And sees within my eyes the tears of two




VII


The face of all the world is changed I think
Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul
Move still oh still beside me as they stole
Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink
Of obvious death where I who thought to sink
Was caught up into love and taught the whole
Of life in a new rhythm The cup of dole
God gave for baptism I am fain to drink
And praise its sweetness Sweet with thee anear
The names of country heaven are changed away
For where thou art or shalt be there or here
And this    this lute and song    loved yesterday
The singing angels know are only dear
Because thy name moves right in what they say




VIII


What can I give thee back O liberal
And princely giver who hast brought the gold
And purple of thine heart unstained untold
And laid them on the outside of the wall
For such as I to take or leave withal
In unexpected largesse am I cold
Ungrateful that for these most manifold
High gifts I render nothing back at all
Not so not coldbut very poor instead
Ask God who knows For frequent tears have run
The colours from my life and left so dead
And pale a stuff it were not fitly done
To give the same as pillow to thy head
Go farther let it serve to trample on




IX


Can it be right to give what I can give
To let thee sit beneath the fall of tears
As salt as mine and hear the sighing years
Resighing on my lips renunciative
Through those infrequent smiles which fail to live
For all thy adjurations O my fears
That this can scarce be right We are not peers
So to be lovers and I own and grieve
That givers of such gifts as mine are must
Be counted with the ungenerous Out alas
I will not soil thy purple with my dust
Nor breathe my poison on thy Veniceglass
Nor give thee any lovewhich were unjust
Beloved I only love thee let it pass




X


Yet love mere love is beautiful indeed
And worthy of acceptation Fire is bright
Let temple burn or flax an equal light
Leaps in the flame from cedarplank or weed
And love is fire And when I say at need
I love thee    mark    I love theein thy sight
I stand transfigured glorified aright
With conscience of the new rays that proceed
Out of my face toward thine Theres nothing low
In love when love the lowest meanest creatures
Who love God God accepts while loving so
And what I feel across the inferior features
Of what I am doth flash itself and show
How that great work of Love enhances Natures




XI


And therefore if to love can be desert
I am not all unworthy Cheeks as pale
As these you see and trembling knees that fail
To bear the burden of a heavy heart
This weary minstrellife that once was girt
To climb Aornus and can scarce avail
To pipe now gainst the valley nightingale
A melancholy musicwhy advert
To these things O Beloved it is plain
I am not of thy worth nor for thy place
And yet because I love thee I obtain
From that same love this vindicating grace
To live on still in love and yet in vain
To bless thee yet renounce thee to thy face




XII


Indeed this very love which is my boast
And which when rising up from breast to brow
Doth crown me with a ruby large enow
To draw mens eyes and prove the inner cost
This love even all my worth to the uttermost
I should not love withal unless that thou
Hadst set me an example shown me how
When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed
And love called love And thus I cannot speak
Of love even as a good thing of my own
Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak
And placed it by thee on a golden throne
And that I love O soul we must be meek
Is by thee only whom I love alone




XIII


And wilt thou have me fashion into speech
The love I bear thee finding words enough
And hold the torch out while the winds are rough
Between our faces to cast light on each
I drop it at thy feet I cannot teach
My hand to hold my spirits so far off
From myselfmethat I should bring thee proof
In words of love hid in me out of reach
Nay let the silence of my womanhood
Commend my womanlove to thy belief
Seeing that I stand unwon however wooed
And rend the garment of my life in brief
By a most dauntless voiceless fortitude
Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief




XIV


If thou must love me let it be for nought
Except for loves sake only Do not say
I love her for her smileher lookher way
Of speaking gentlyfor a trick of thought
That falls in well with mine and certes brought
A sense of pleasant ease on such a day
For these things in themselves Beloved may
Be changed or change for theeand love so wrought
May be unwrought so Neither love me for
Thine own dear pitys wiping my cheeks dry
A creature might forget to weep who bore
Thy comfort long and lose thy love thereby
But love me for loves sake that evermore
Thou mayst love on through loves eternity




XV


Accuse me not beseech thee that I wear
Too calm and sad a face in front of thine
For we two look two ways and cannot shine
With the same sunlight on our brow and hair
On me thou lookest with no doubting care
As on a bee shut in a crystalline
Since sorrow hath shut me safe in loves divine
And to spread wing and fly in the outer air
Were most impossible failure if I strove
To fail so But I look on theeon thee
Beholding besides love the end of love
Hearing oblivion beyond memory
As one who sits and gazes from above
Over the rivers to the bitter sea




XVI


And yet because thou overcomest so
Because thou art more noble and like a king
Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling
Thy purple round me till my heart shall grow
Too close against thine heart henceforth to know
How it shook when alone Why conquering
May prove as lordly and complete a thing
In lifting upward as in crushing low
And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword
To one who lifts him from the bloody earth
Even so Beloved I at last record
Here ends my strife If thou invite me forth
I rise above abasement at the word
Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth




XVII


My poet thou canst touch on all the notes
God set between His After and Before
And strike up and strike off the general roar
Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats
In a serene air purely Antidotes
Of medicated music answering for
Mankinds forlornest uses thou canst pour
From thence into their ears Gods will devotes
Thine to such ends and mine to wait on thine
How Dearest wilt thou have me for most use
A hope to sing by gladly or a fine
Sad memory with thy songs to interfuse
A shade in which to singof palm or pine
A grave on which to rest from singing Choose




XVIII


I never gave a lock of hair away
To a man Dearest except this to thee
Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully
I ring out to the full brown length and say
Take it My day of youth went yesterday
My hair no longer bounds to my foots glee
Nor plant I it from rose or myrtletree
As girls do any more it only may
Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears
Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
Through sorrows trick I thought the funeralshears
Would take this first but Love is justified
Take it thoufinding pure from all those years
The kiss my mother left here when she died




XIX


The souls Rialto hath its merchandize
I barter curl for curl upon that mart
And from my poets forehead to my heart
Receive this lock which outweighs argosies
As purply black as erst to Pindars eyes
The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
The nine white Musebrows For this counterpart   
The bay crowns shade Beloved I surmise
Still lingers on thy curl it is so black
Thus with a fillet of smoothkissing breath
I tie the shadows safe from gliding back
And lay the gift where nothing hindereth
Here on my heart as on thy brow to lack
No natural heat till mine grows cold in death




XX


Beloved my Beloved when I think
That thou wast in the world a year ago
What time I sat alone here in the snow
And saw no footprint heard the silence sink
No moment at thy voice but link by link
Went counting all my chains as if that so
They never could fall off at any blow
Struck by thy possible handwhy thus I drink
Of lifes great cup of wonder Wonderful
Never to feel thee thrill the day or night
With personal act or speechnor ever cull
Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white
Thou sawest growing Atheists are as dull
Who cannot guess Gods presence out of sight




XXI


Say over again and yet once over again
That thou dost love me Though the word repeated
Should seem a cuckoosong as thou dost treat it
Remember never to the hill or plain
Valley and wood without her cuckoostrain
Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed
Beloved I amid the darkness greeted
By a doubtful spiritvoice in that doubts pain
Cry Speak once morethou lovest Who can fear
Too many stars though each in heaven shall roll
Too many flowers though each shall crown the year
Say thou dost love me love me love metoll
The silver iteranceonly minding Dear
To love me also in silence with thy soul




XXII


When our two souls stand up erect and strong
Face to face silent drawing nigh and nigher
Until the lengthening wings break into fire
At either curved pointwhat bitter wrong
Can the earth do to us that we should not long
Be here contented Think In mounting higher
The angels would press on us and aspire
To drop some golden orb of perfect song
Into our deep dear silence Let us stay
Rather on earth Belovedwhere the unfit
Contrarious moods of men recoil away
And isolate pure spirits and permit
A place to stand and love in for a day
With darkness and the deathhour rounding it




XXIII


Is it indeed so If I lay here dead
Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine
And would the sun for thee more coldly shine
Because of gravedamps falling round my head
I marvelled my Beloved when I read
Thy thought so in the letter I am thine
But    so much to thee Can I pour thy wine
While my hands tremble Then my soul instead
Of dreams of death resumes lifes lower range
Then love me Love look on mebreathe on me
As brighter ladies do not count it strange
For love to give up acres and degree
I yield the grave for thy sake and exchange
My near sweet view of heaven for earth with thee




XXIV


Let the worlds sharpness like a clasping knife
Shut in upon itself and do no harm
In this close hand of Love now soft and warm
And let us hear no sound of human strife
After the click of the shutting Life to life
I lean upon thee Dear without alarm
And feel as safe as guarded by a charm
Against the stab of worldlings who if rife
Are weak to injure Very whitely still
The lilies of our lives may reassure
Their blossoms from their roots accessible
Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer
Growing straight out of mans reach on the hill
God only who made us rich can make us poor




XXV


A heavy heart Beloved have I borne
From year to year until I saw thy face
And sorrow after sorrow took the place
Of all those natural joys as lightly worn
As the stringed pearls each lifted in its turn
By a beating heart at dancetime Hopes apace
Were changed to long despairs till Gods own grace
Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn
My heavy heart Then thou didst bid me bring
And let it drop adown thy calmly great
Deep being Fast it sinketh as a thing
Which its own nature does precipitate
While thine doth close above it mediating
Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate




XXVI


I lived with visions for my company
Instead of men and women years ago
And found them gentle mates nor thought to know
A sweeter music than they played to me
But soon their trailing purple was not free
Of this worlds dust their lutes did silent grow
And I myself grew faint and blind below
Their vanishing eyes Then thou didst cometo be
Beloved what they seemed Their shining fronts
Their songs their splendours better yet the same
As riverwater hallowed into fonts
Met in thee and from out thee overcame
My soul with satisfaction of all wants
Because Gods gifts put mans best dreams to shame




XXVII


My own Beloved who hast lifted me
From this drear flat of earth where I was thrown
And in betwixt the languid ringlets blown
A lifebreath till the forehead hopefully
Shines out again as all the angels see
Before thy saving kiss My own my own
Who camest to me when the world was gone
And I who looked for only God found thee
I find thee I am safe and strong and glad
As one who stands in dewless asphodel
Looks backward on the tedious time he had
In the upper lifeso I with bosomswell
Make witness here between the good and bad
That Love as strong as Death retrieves as well




XXVIII


My letters all dead paper mute and white
And yet they seem alive and quivering
Against my tremulous hands which loose the string
And let them drop down on my knee tonight
This saidhe wished to have me in his sight
Once as a friend this fixed a day in spring
To come and touch my hand    a simple thing
Yet I wept for itthis    the papers light   
Said Dear I love thee and I sank and quailed
As if Gods future thundered on my past
This said I am thineand so its ink has paled
With lying at my heart that beat too fast
And this    O Love thy words have ill availed
If what this said I dared repeat at last




XXIX


I think of theemy thoughts do twine and bud
About thee as wild vines about a tree
Put out broad leaves and soon theres nought to see
Except the straggling green which hides the wood
Yet O my palmtree be it understood
I will not have my thoughts instead of thee
Who art dearer better Rather instantly
Renew thy presence as a strong tree should
Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare
And let these bands of greenery which insphere thee
Drop heavily downburst shattered everywhere
Because in this deep joy to see and hear thee
And breathe within thy shadow a new air
I do not think of theeI am too near thee




XXX


I see thine image through my tears tonight
And yet today I saw thee smiling How
Refer the causeBeloved is it thou
Or I who makes me sad The acolyte
Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite
May so fall flat with pale insensate brow
On the altarstair I hear thy voice and vow
Perplexed uncertain since thou art out of sight
As he in his swooning ears the choirs amen
Beloved dost thou love or did I see all
The glory as I dreamed and fainted when
Too vehement light dilated my ideal
For my souls eyes Will that light come again
As now these tears comefalling hot and real




XXXI


Thou comest all is said without a word
I sit beneath thy looks as children do
In the noonsun with souls that tremble through
Their happy eyelids from an unaverred
Yet prodigal inward joy Behold I erred
In that last doubt and yet I cannot rue
The sin most but the occasionthat we two
Should for a moment stand unministered
By a mutual presence Ah keep near and close
Thou dovelike help and when my fears would rise
With thy broad heart serenely interpose
Brood down with thy divine sufficiencies
These thoughts which tremble when bereft of those
Like callow birds left desert to the skies




XXXII


The first time that the sun rose on thine oath
To love me I looked forward to the moon
To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon
And quickly tied to make a lasting troth
Quickloving hearts I thought may quickly loathe
And looking on myself I seemed not one
For such mans lovemore like an outoftune
Worn viol a good singer would be wroth
To spoil his song with and which snatched in haste
Is laid down at the first illsounding note
I did not wrong myself so but I placed
A wrong on thee For perfect strains may float
Neath masterhands from instruments defaced
And great souls at one stroke may do and doat




XXXIII


Yes call me by my petname let me hear
The name I used to run at when a child
From innocent play and leave the cowslips plied
To glance up in some face that proved me dear
With the look of its eyes I miss the clear
Fond voices which being drawn and reconciled
Into the music of Heavens undefiled
Call me no longer Silence on the bier
While I call Godcall Godso let thy mouth
Be heir to those who are now exanimate
Gather the north flowers to complete the south
And catch the early love up in the late
Yes call me by that nameand I in truth
With the same heart will answer and not wait




XXXIV


With the same heart I said Ill answer thee
As those when thou shalt call me by my name
Lo the vain promise is the same the same
Perplexed and ruffled by lifes strategy
When called before I told how hastily
I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game
To run and answer with the smile that came
At play last moment and went on with me
Through my obedience When I answer now
I drop a grave thought break from solitude
Yet still my heart goes to theeponder how
Not as to a single good but all my good
Lay thy hand on it best one and allow
That no childs foot could run fast as this blood




XXXV


If I leave all for thee wilt thou exchange
And be all to me Shall I never miss
Hometalk and blessing and the common kiss
That comes to each in turn nor count it strange
When I look up to drop on a new range
Of walls and floors another home than this
Nay wilt thou fill that place by me which is
Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change
Thats hardest If to conquer love has tried
To conquer grief tries more as all things prove
For grief indeed is love and grief beside
Alas I have grieved so I am hard to love
Yet love mewilt thou Open thy heart wide
And fold within the wet wings of thy dove




XXXVI


When we met first and loved I did not build
Upon the event with marble Could it mean
To last a love set pendulous between
Sorrow and sorrow Nay I rather thrilled
Distrusting every light that seemed to gild
The onward path and feared to overlean
A finger even And though I have grown serene
And strong since then I think that God has willed
A still renewable fear    O love O troth   
Lest these enclasped hands should never hold
This mutual kiss drop down between us both
As an unowned thing once the lips being cold
And Love be false if he to keep one oath
Must lose one joy by his lifes star foretold




XXXVII


Pardon oh pardon that my soul should make
Of all that strong divineness which I know
For thine and thee an image only so
Formed of the sand and fit to shift and break
It is that distant years which did not take
Thy sovranty recoiling with a blow
Have forced my swimming brain to undergo
Their doubt and dread and blindly to forsake
Thy purity of likeness and distort
Thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit
As if a shipwrecked Pagan safe in port
His guardian seagod to commemorate
Should set a sculptured porpoise gills asnort
And vibrant tail within the templegate




XXXVIII


First time he kissed me he but only kissed
The fingers of this hand wherewith I write
And ever since it grew more clean and white
Slow to worldgreetings quick with its O list
When the angels speak A ring of amethyst
I could not wear here plainer to my sight
Than that first kiss The second passed in height
The first and sought the forehead and half missed
Half falling on the hair O beyond meed
That was the chrism of love which loves own crown
With sanctifying sweetness did precede
The third upon my lips was folded down
In perfect purple state since when indeed
I have been proud and said My love my own




XXXIX


Because thou hast the power and ownst the grace
To look through and behind this mask of me
Against which years have beat thus blanchingly
With their rains and behold my souls true face
The dim and weary witness of lifes race
Because thou hast the faith and love to see
Through that same souls distracting lethargy
The patient angel waiting for a place
In the new Heavensbecause nor sin nor woe
Nor Gods infliction nor deaths neighbourhood
Nor all which others viewing turn to go
Nor all which makes me tired of all selfviewed
Nothing repels thee    Dearest teach me so
To pour out gratitude as thou dost good




XL


Oh yes they love through all this world of ours
I will not gainsay love called love forsooth
I have heard love talked in my early youth
And since not so long back but that the flowers
Then gathered smell still Mussulmans and Giaours
Throw kerchiefs at a smile and have no ruth
For any weeping Polyphemes white tooth
Slips on the nut if after frequent showers
The shell is oversmoothand not so much
Will turn the thing called love aside to hate
Or else to oblivion But thou art not such
A lover my Beloved thou canst wait
Through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch
And think it soon when others cry Too late




XLI


I thank all who have loved me in their hearts
With thanks and love from mine Deep thanks to all
Who paused a little near the prisonwall
To hear my music in its louder parts
Ere they went onward each one to the marts
Or temples occupation beyond call
But thou who in my voices sink and fall
When the sob took it thy divinest Arts
Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot
To harken what I said between my tears   
Instruct me how to thank thee Oh to shoot
My souls full meaning into future years
That they should lend it utterance and salute
Love that endures from life that disappears




XLII


My future will not copy fair my past
I wrote that once and thinking at my side
My ministering lifeangel justified
The word by his appealing look upcast
To the white throne of God I turned at last
And there instead saw thee not unallied
To angels in thy soul Then I long tried
By natural ills received the comfort fast
While budding at thy sight my pilgrims staff
Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled
I seek no copy now of lifes first half
Leave here the pages with long musing curled
And write me new my futures epigraph
New angel mine unhoped for in the world




XLIII


How do I love thee Let me count the ways
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace
I love thee to the level of everydays
Most quiet need by sun and candlelight
I love thee freely as men strive for Right
I love thee purely as they turn from Praise
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs and with my childhoods faith
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saintsI love thee with the breath
Smiles tears of all my lifeand if God choose
I shall but love thee better after death




XLIV


Beloved thou hast brought me many flowers
Plucked in the garden all the summer through
And winter and it seemed as if they grew
In this close room nor missed the sun and showers
So in the like name of that love of ours
Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too
And which on warm and cold days I withdrew
From my hearts ground Indeed those beds and bowers
Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue
And wait thy weeding yet heres eglantine
Heres ivytake them as I used to do
Thy flowers and keep them where they shall not pine
Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true
And tell thy soul their roots are left in mine

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBooks
eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII
compressed zipped HTML and others

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 httpwwwgutenbergnet

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks

EBooks posted prior to November 2003 with eBook numbers BELOW 10000
are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year For example

 httpwwwgutenbergnetetext06

 Or etext 05 04 03 02 01 00 99
 98 97 96 95 94 93 92 92 91 or 90

EBooks posted since November 2003 with etext numbers OVER 10000 are
filed in a different way The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path The path is based on the etext number which is
identical to the filename The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at

 httpwwwgutenbergnet102310234

or filename 24689 would be found at
 httpwwwgutenbergnet246824689
