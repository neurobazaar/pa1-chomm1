Chapter IPRELIMINARY HOW THE MOMENT ARRIVED

Battle being once seen to be inevitable it was Friedrichs plan not to
wait for it but to give it Thanks to Friedrich Wilhelm and himself
there is no Army nor ever was any in such continual preparation
Military people say Some Countries take six months some twelve to
get in motion for war but in three weeks Prussia can be across
the marches and upon the throat of its enemy Which is an immense
advantage to little Prussia among its big neighbors Some Countries
have a longer sword than Prussia but none can unsheathe it so
soonwe hope too it is moderately sharp when wielded by a deft
hand

The French as was intimated are in great vigor this Year thoroughly
provoked and especially since Friedrich sent his Rothenburg among
them have been doing their very utmost Their main effort is in the
Netherlands at presentand indeed as happened continues all
through this War to be They by no means intend or ever did to neglect
Teutschland yet it turns out they have pretty much done with their
fighting there And next Year driven or led by accidents of various
kinds they quit it altogether and turning their whole strength upon
the Netherlands and Italy chiefly on the Netherlands leave Friedrich
much to his astonishment with the German War hanging wholly round
HIS neck and take no charge of it farther In which to Friedrichs
Biographers there is this inestimable benefit if far the reverse to
Friedrichs self That we shall soon have done with the French then
with them and with so much else and may in time coming for most part
leave their huge Sorcerers Sabbath of a European War to dance
itself out well in the distance not encumbering us farther like a
circumambient Bedlam as it has hitherto done Courage reader Let us
give in a glance or two some notion of the course things took and
what moment it was when Friedrich struck inwhom alone or almost
alone we hope to follow thenceforth Dismal Swamp so gracious was
Heaven to us lying now mostly to rearward little as we hoped it

It was mere accident a series of bad accidents that led King Louis and
his Ministers into gradually forsaking Friedrich They were the
farthest in the world from intending such a thing Contrariwise what
brainbeating diplomatic spiderweaving practical contriving now
and afterwards for that object especially now Rothenburg Noailles
Belleisle Cardinal Tencin have been busy not less the mistress
Chateauroux who admires Friedrich being indeed a highminded
unfortunate female as they say and has thrown out Amelot not
for stammering alone They are able almost high people this new
Chateauroux Ministry compared with some and already show results

Nay what is most important of all France has unconsciously or by
mere help of Noailles and luck got a real General to her Armies Comte
de Saxe now Marechal de Saxe who will shine very splendent in these
Netherland operationscountershone by mere Wades DAhrembergs
Cumberlandsin this and the Four following Years Noailles had
always recognized Comte de Saxe had long striven for him in Official
quarters and here gets the light of him unveiled at last and set on a
high place loyal Noailles

This was the Year this 1744 when Louis XV urged by his Chateauroux
the highsouled unfortunate female appeared in person at the head
of his troops Go Sire go MON CHOU and I will accompany show
yourself where a King should be at the head of your troops be a second
LouisleGrand Which he did his Chateauroux and he actually went to
the Netherlands with baggagetrain immeasurable including not cooks
only but playactors with their thunderbarrels off from Paris May

and looking on from the distance unable to attempt the least stroke in
opposition So that the Dutch Barrier if anybody now cared for it
did go all flat and the Balance of Power gets kicked out of its sacred
pivot to such purpose have the Dutch been hoisted Terrible to think
ofhad not there from the opposite quarter risen a surprising
counterpoise had not there been a Prince Karl with his 70000
pressing victoriously over the Rhine which stayed the French in these
sacrilegious procedures




PRINCE KARL GETS ACROSS THE RHINE 20 JUNE2 JULY 1744

Prince Karl some weeks ago at Heilbronn joined his Rhine Army which
had gathered thither from the Austrian side through Baiern and from
the HitherAustrian or Swabian Winterquarters with full intent to be
across the Rhine and home upon Elsass and the Compensation Countries
this Summer under what difficulties soever Karl or as some whisper
old Marshal Traun who is nominally second in command do make a
glorious campaign of it this Yearand lift the Cause of Liberty at
one time to the highest pitch it ever reached Here in brief terms is
Prince Karls Operation on the Rhine much admired by military men

STOCKSTADT JUNE 20th 1744 Some thirty and odd miles north of
Mannheim the Rhine before turning westward at Mainz makes one other
of its many Islands of which there are hundreds since the leap at
Schaffhausen one other and I think the biggest of them all perhaps
two miles by five which the Germans call KUHKOPF Cowhead from the
shape it hasa narrow semiellipse River there splitting in two one
split the western going straight the other bending luxuriantly round
so that the HINDhead or straight end of the Island lies towards France
and the round end or cowLIPS so to speak towards native Teutschland
and the woody Hills of the BergStrasse thereabouts Stockstadt chief
little Town looking over into this Cowhead Island lies under the
CHIN understand only farther that the German branch carries more than
twothirds of the River that on the Island itself there is no town
or post of defence and that Stockstadt is the place for getting over
Coigny and the French some 40000 are guarding the River hereabouts
with lines with batteries cordons the best they can Seckendorf with
20000 more Imperial Old Bavarian Troops revivified recruited
by French pay is in his garrison of Philipsburg ready to help when
needednot moulting now at Wembdingen in that dismal manner
newfeathered now into Kaisers Army waiting in his Philipsburg to
guard the River there Coignys French have ramparts ditches not
quite unfurnished on their own shore opposite this Cowhead Island
ISLE DE HERON as they call it looking over to the hindhead namely
but they have nothing considerable there and in the Island itself
nothing whatever If now Stockstadt were suddenly snatched by us
thinks Karlif a few pontoons were nimbly swung in

JUNE 20thCoignys people all shooting FEUDEJOIE for that never
enough to be celebrated Capture of Menin and the Dutch Barrier
a fortnight agothis is managed to be done The active General
Barenklau active Brigadier Daun under him pushes rapidly across into
Kuhkopf rapidly throws up intrenchments ramparts mounts cannon digs
himself ingreatly to Coignys astonishment whose people hereabouts
and in all their lines and posts are busy shooting FEUDEJOIE for
those immortal Dutch victories at the moment and never dreaming of
such a thing Fresh force floods in Prince Karl himself arrives next
day in support of Barenklau Coigny headquarters at Speyer forty
miles south need not attempt dislodging him but must stand upon his
guard and prepare for worse Which he does with diligence shifting
northward into those StockstadtMainz parts calling Seckendorf across
the River and otherwise doing his bestfor about ten days more when
worse and almost worst did verily befall him

No attempt was made on Barenklau nor beyond the alarming of the
CoignySeckendorf people did anything occur in Cowhead Islandunless
it were the finis of an ugly bully and ruffian who has more than once
afflicted us which may be worth one word Colonel Mentzel copperfaced
Colonel originally Playactor Spy in Persia and I know not what
had been at the seizure of Kuhkopf a prominent man Whom on the fifth
day after June 25th Prince Karl overwhelmed with joy by handing
him a Patent of Generalcy Just received from Court my Friend
on account of your merits old and lateAha said Barenklau
congratulating warmly Dine with me then Herr General Mentzel
this very day The Prince himself is to be there Highness of
HessenDarmstadt and who not all are impatient to drink your health
Mentzel had a glorious dinner still more glorious drinkPrince
Karl and the others it is said egging him into much wild bluster and
gasconade to season their much wine Eminent swill of drinking with
the loud coarse talk supposable on the part of Mentzel and consorts did
go on in this manner all afternoon in the evening drunk Mentzel came
out for air went strutting and staggering about emerging finally on
the platform of some rampart face of him huge and red as that of
the foggiest rising Moonand stood looking over into the Lorraine
Country belching out a storm of oaths as to his taking it as to
his doing this and that and was even flourishing his sword by way of
accompaniment when lo whistling slightly through the summer air a
rifleball from some sentry on the French side writers say it was a
French drummer grown impatient and snatching a sentrys piece took
the brain of him or the belly of him and he rushed down at once a
totally collapsed monster and mere heap of dead ruin never to trouble
mankind more _Guerre de Boheme_ iii 165 For which my readers and
I are rather thankful Voltaire and perhaps other memorable persons
sometimes mention this brute miraculous to the Plebs and Gazetteers
otherwise eternal oblivion were the best we could do with him Trenck
also readers will be glad to understand ends in jail and bedlam by and
by

Prince Karl had not the least intention of crossing by this Cowhead
Island Nevertheless he set about two other Bridges in the neighborhood
nearer Mainz few miles below that City kept manoeuvring his Force
in huge halfmoon round that quarter and mysteriously up and down
alarming Coigny wholly into the Mainz region For the space of ten
days and then stealing off to Schrock a little Rhine Village above
Philipsburg many miles away from Coigny and his vigilantes he

NIGHT OF 30th JUNE1st JULY Suddenly shot Pandour Trenck followed
by Nadasti and 6000 across at Schrock who scattered Seckendorfs poor
outposts thereabouts to the winds built a bridge before morning and
next day another Next day Prince Karl in person appeared and on the
3d of July had his whole Army with its luggages across and had seized
the Lines of Lauterburg and Weissenburg celebrated northern defence of
Elsassmuch to Coignys amazement and remained inexpugnable there
with Elsass open to him and to Coigny shut for the present Adelung
iv 139141 Coigny made bitter wail accusation blame of Seckendorf
blame of men and of things even tried some fighting Seckendorf too
doing feats to recover those Lines of Weissenburg but could not do it
And in fact blazing to and fro in that excited rather than luminous
condition could not do anything except retire into the strong posts
of the background and send express on express swifter than the wind if
you can to a victorious King overturning the Dutch Barrier Help your
Majesty or we are lost and France iswhat shall I say

Admirable feat of Strategy What a General this Prince Karl
exclaimed mankindCauseofLiberty mankind with special enthusiasm
and took to writing LIVES of Prince Karl For instance _The Life of
his Highness Prince Charles of c with c c_ London 1746 one
of the most distracted Blotches ever published under the name of
Bookwakening thoughts of a public dimness very considerable indeed
to which this could offer itself as lamp as well as tarburning and
TEDEUMing on an extensive scale For it had sent the Cause of Liberty
bounding up again to the top of things this of crossing the Rhine
in such fashion And in effect the Cause of Liberty and Prince
Karl himself had risen hereby to their acme or culminating point in
WorldHistory not to continue long at such height little as they
dreamt of that among their tarburnings The feat itselfcontrived
by Nadasti people say and executed what was the real difficulty by
Traunbrought Prince Karl very great renown this Year and is praised
by Friedrich himself now and afterwards as masterly as Julius
Caesars method and the proper way of crossing rivers when executable
in face of an enemy And indeed Prince Karl owing to Traun or not
is highly respectable in the way of Generalship at present and did in
these Five Months from June onward really considerable things At his
very acme of Life as well as of Generalship which alas soon changed
poor man never to culminate again He had got at the beginning of the
Year the high Maria Theresas one Sister Archduchess Maria Anna to
Wife Age then twentyfive gone born 14th September 1718 married to
Prince Karl 7th January 1744 died of childbirth 16th December same

the crown of long mutual attachment she safe now at Brussels
diligent CoRegent and in a promising familyway he here walking on
victoriousneed any man be happier No man can be supremely happy
long and this Generals strategic felicity and his domestic were
fatally cut down almost together The Cause of Liberty too now at the
top of its orbit wasBut let us stick by our Excerpting

DUNKIRK 19th JULY 1744 Princess Ulriques Wedding just two days
ago King Louis on hearing of the Jobsnews from Elsass instantly
suspended his Conquests in Flanders detached Noailles detached this
one and that doublequick Division after Division leaving Saxe with
45000 to his own resources and the fatuities of Marshal Wade
and 19th July himself hastens off from Dunkirk leaving much of the
luggage but not the Chateauroux behind him to save his Country poor
soul But could not in the least save it the reverse rather August
4th he got to Metz Belleisles strong town about 100 miles from the
actual scene his detached reinforcements say 50000 men or so hanging
out ahead like flameclouds but uncertain how to actNoailles being
always cunctatious in time of crisis and poor Louis himself nothing of
a CloudCompellerand then

METZ AUGUST 8th The Most Christian King fell ill dangerously
dreadfully just like to die Which entirely paralyzed Noailles and
Company or reduced them to mere hysterics and excitement of the
unluminous kind And filled France in general Paris in particular
with terror lamentation prayers of forty hours and such a paroxysm
of heroworship as was never seen for such an object before Espagnac
ii 12 Adelung iv 180 _Fastes de Louis XV_ ii 423 c c

For the Cause of Liberty here we consider was the culminating moment
Elsass Lorraine and the Three Bishoprics lying in their quasimoribund
condition Austrian claims of Compensation ceasing to be visions of the
heated brain and gaining some footing on the Earth as facts Prince
Karl is here actually in Elsass master of the strong passes elate in
heart he and his France again as if fallen paralytic into temporary
distraction offering for resistance nothing hitherto but that universal
wailing of mankind Heroworship of a thricelamentable nature and the
Prayers of FortyHours Most Christian Majesty now IN EXTREMIS centre
of the basest hubbub that ever was is dismissing Chateauroux Noailles
Coigny and Company hang well back upon the Hill regions and strong
posts which are not yet menaced or fly vaguely more or less
distractedly hither and thither not in the least like fighting Karl
much less like beating him Karl has Germany free at his back nay it is
a German population round him here neither haversack nor cartridgebox
like to fail before him are only a Noailles and consorts flying
vaguely aboutand there is in Karl or under the same cloak with him
at present a talent of manoeuvring men which even Friedrich finds
masterly If old Marshal Wade at the other end of the line should
chance to awaken and press home on Saxe and his remnant of French with
right vigor In fact there was not that I can see for centuries past
not even at the Siege of Lille in Marlboroughs time a more imminent
peril for France




FRIEDRICH DECIDES TO INTERVENE

King Friedrich on hearing of these Rhenish emergencies and of King
Louiss heroic advance to the rescue perceived that for himself too the
moment was come and hastened to inform heroic Louis That though the
terms of their Bargain were not yet completed Sweden Russia and other
points being still in a pendent condition he Friedrichwith an eye
to success of their Joint Adventure and to the indispensability of
joint action energy and the top of ones speed now or neverwould
by the middle of this same August be on the field with 100000 men An
invasion of Bohemia will not that astonish Prince Karl and bring him
to his RhineBridges again Over which if your Most Christian Majesty
be active he will not get except in a half or wholly ruined state
Follow him close send the rest of your force to threaten Hanover sit
well on the skirts of Prince Karl Him as he hurries homeward ruined or
halfruined him or whatever Austrian will fight I do my best to beat
We may have Bohemia and a beaten Austria this very Autumn seeand
in one Campaign there is Peace ready for us This is Friedrichs
scheme of action success certain thinks he if only there be energy
activity on your side as there shall be on mineand has sent Count
Schmettau filled with fiery speed and determination to keep the French
full of the like and concert mutual operations

Magnanimous exclaim Noailles and the paralyzed French Gentlemen King
Louis I think now past speech for Schmettau only came August 9th
Most sublime behavior on his Prussian Majestys part own they And
truly it is a fine manful indifference by no means so common as it
should be to all interests to all considerations but that of a Joint
Enterprise one has engaged in And truly furthermore it was immediate
salvation to the paralyzed French Gentlemen in that alarming crisis
though they did not much recognize it afterwards as such and indeed
were conspicuously forgetful of all parts of it when their own danger
was over

Maria Theresas feelings may be conceived George IIs feelings and
what the Cause of Liberty in general felt and furiously said and
complained whensuddenly as a DEUS EX MACHINA or Supernal Genie
in the Minor TheatresFriedrich stept in Precisely in this supreme
crisis 7th August 1744 Friedrichs Minister Graf von Dohna at
Vienna has given notice of the Frankfurt Union and solemn Engagement
entered into Obliged in honor and conscience will and must now step
forth to right an injured Kaiser cannot stand these high procedures
against an Imperial Majesty chosen by all the Princes of the Reich this
unheardof protest that the Kaiser is no Kaiser as if all Germany were
but Austria and the Queen of Hungarys Prussian Majesty has not the
least quarrel of his own with the Queen of Hungary stands true and
will stand by the Treaty of Berlin and Breslauonly with certain
other German Princes has done what all German Princes and peoples not
Austrian are bound to do on behalf of their downtrodden Kaiser
formed a Union of Frankfurt and will with armed hand if indispensable
endeavor to see right done in that matter In _Adelung_ iv 155 156
the Declaration itself Audience 7th August 1744 Dohna off homeward
on the second day after

This is the astonishing fact for the Cause of Liberty and no clamor and
execration will avail anything This man is prompt too does not
linger in getting out his Sword when he has talked of it Prince
Karls Operation is likely to be marred amazingly If this swift King
comparable to the old Serpent for devices were to burst forth from
his Silesian strengths tread sharply on the TAIL of Prince Karls
Operation and bring back the formidably fanged head of IT out of
Alsace five hundred miles all at oncethere would be a business

We will now quit the Rhine Operations which indeed are not now of
moment Friedrich being suddenly the key of events again I add only
what readers are vaguely aware of that King Louis did not die that he
lay at deaths door for precisely one week 8th15th August symptoms
mending on the 15th In the interimGrandAlmoner FitzJames Uncle
of our Conte di Spinelli insisting that a certain Cardinal who had got
the Sacraments in hand should insist and endless ministerial intrigue
being busymoribund Louis had when it came to the Sacramental
point been obliged to dismiss his Chateauroux Poor Chateauroux an
unfortunate female yet one almost thinks the best man among them
dismissed at Metz here and like to be mobbed That was the one issue
of King Louiss deathsickness Sublime sickness during which all Paris
wept aloud in terror and sorrow like a child that has lost its mother
and sees a mastiff coming wept sublimely and did the Prayers
of FortyHours and called King Louis Le BIENAIME The
Wellbelovedmerely some obstruction in the royal bowels it turned
outa good cathartic and the Prayers of FortyHours quite reinstated
matters Nay reinstated even Chateauroux some time afterthe Devil
being well again and as the Proverb says quitting his monastic view
Reinstated Chateauroux but this time poor creature she continued only
about a daySudden fever from excitement said the Doctors Fever
Poison you mean whispered others and looked for changes in the
Ministry Enough oh enough

Old Marshal Wade did not awaken though bawled to by his Ligoniers and
others and much shaken about poor old gentleman No artillery to
speak of murmured he want baggagewagons too and lay still Here
is artillery answered the Official people With my own money I will
buy you baggagewagons answered the high Maria Anna in her own name
and her Prince Karls who are JointGovernors there Possibly he would
have awakened had they given him time But time in War especially is
the thing that is never given Once Friedrich HAD struck in the moment
was gone by Poor old Wade Of him also enough




Chapter IIFRIEDRICH MARCHES UPON PRAG CAPTURES PRAG

It was on Saturday early in the morning 15th August 1744 that
Friedrich set out attended by his two eldest Brothers Prince of
Prussia and Prince Henri from Potsdam towards this new Adventure
which proved so famous since Sudden swift to the worlds
astonishmentactually on march here in three Columns two through
Saxony by various routes southeastward one from Silesia through Glatz
southwestward to invade Bohemia rumor says 100000 strong fact
itself says upwards of 80000 on their various routes converging
towards Prag HeldenGeschichteii 1165 Orlich ii 25 27
enumerates the various regiments His Columns especially his Saxon
Columns are already on the road he joins one Column this night
at Wittenberg and is bent through Saxony towards the frontiers of
Bohemia at the utmost military speed he has

Through Saxony about 60000 go he has got the Kaisers Order to the
Government of Saxony Our august Ally requiring on our Imperial
business a transit through youand Winterfeld an excellent soldier
and negotiator has gone forward to present said Order A Document which
flurries the Dresden Officials beyond measure Their King is in Warsaw
their King if here could do little and indeed has been inclining
to Maria Theresa this long while And Winterfeld insists on such
despatchand not even the Duke of Weissenfels is in Town Dresden
Officials send off five couriers and thirteen estafettes to the poor
old Duke _HeldenGeschichte_ ii 1163 get him at last andThe
march is already taking effect they may as well consent to it what can
they do but consent In the uttermost flurry they had set to fortifying
Dresden all hands driving palisades picking delving making COUPURES
trenches or sunk barricades in the streetsfatally aware that it
can avail nothing Is not this the Kaisers Order Prussians to the
amount of 60000 are across our Frontiers rapidly speeding on

Friedrichs Manifestounder the modest Title ANZEIGE DER URSACHEN
Advertisement of the Causes which have induced his Prussian Majesty to
send the Romish Kaisers Majesty some Auxiliary Troopshad appeared
in the Berlin Newspapers Thursday 13th only two days before An
astonishment to all mankind which gave rise to endless misconceptions
of Friedrich but which supporting itself on proofs on punctually
excerpted footnotes is intrinsically a modest quiet Piece and what
is singular in Manifestoes has nothing or almost nothing in it that
is not so far as it goes a perfect statement of the fact Auxiliary
troops that is our essential character No war with her Hungarian
Majesty or with any other on our own score But her Hungarian Majesty
how has she treated the Romish Kaiser her and our and the Reichs
Sovereign Head and to what pass reduced him refusing him Peace on any
terms except those of selfannihilation denying that he is a Kaiser at
alland enumerates the various Imperial injuries with proof given
quiet footnotes by way of proof and concludes in these words For
himself his Majesty requires nothing The question here is not of his
Majestys own interest at all everything his Majesty required or
requires is by the Treaty of Berlin solemnly his if the Reich and its
Laws endure and he has taken up arms simply and solely in the view of
restoring to the Reich its freedom to the Kaiser his Headship of the
Reich and to all Europe the Peace which is so desirable Given in
Seyfarth _Beylage_ i 121136 with date August 1744

Pretences subterfuges lies exclaimed the Austrian and Allied
Public everywhere or strove to exclaim especially the English Public
which had no difficulty in so doinga Public comfortably blank as to
German facts or nonfacts and finding with amazement only this a very
certain fact That hereby is their own Pragmatic thunder checked in
midvolley in a most surprising manner and the triumphant Cause of
Liberty brought to jeopardy again Perfidious ambitious capricious
exclaimed they a Prince without honor without truth without
constancyand completed for themselves in hot rabid humor that
English Theory of Friedrich which has prevailed ever since Perhaps the
most surprising item of which is this latter very prominent in
those old times That Friedrich has no constancy but follows his
caprices and accidental whirls of impulseitem which has dropped
away in our times though the others stand as stable as ever A monument
of several things Friedrichs suddenness is an essential part of what
fighting talent he has if the Public thrown into flurry cannot judge
it well they must even misjudge it what help is there

That the above were actually Friedrichs reasons for venturing into
this Big Game again is not now disputable And as to the rumor which
rose afterwards and was denied and could only be denied diplomatically
to the ear if even to the ear That Friedrich by Secret Article was
to have for himself the Three Bohemian Circles Konigsgratz
Bunzlau Leitmeritz which lie between Schlesien and Sachsen
_HeldenGeschichte_ i 1081 Scholl ii 349there is not a doubt
but Friedrich had so bargained Very well if we can get said Circles
and would right cheerfully have kept and held them had the big game
gone in all points completely well game to reinstate the Kaiser BOTH
in Bohemia and Bavaria by Friedrichs fine playing Not a doubt of all
thisnor of what an extremely hypothetic outlook it then and always
was greatly too weak for enticing such a man

Friedrich goes in Three Columns One on the south or left shore of the
Elbe coming in various branches under Friedrich himself this alone
will touch on Dresden pass on the south side of Dresden gather itself
about Pirna in the Saxon Switzerland so called a notable locality
thence over the Metal Mountains into Bohmen by Toplitz by Lowositz
Leitmeritz and the Highway called the Pascopol famous in War The
Second Column under Leopold the Young Dessauer goes on the other or
north side of the Elbe at a fair distance marching through the Lausitz
rendezvous or startingpoint was Bautzen in the Lausitz straight
south to meet the King at Leitmeritz where the grand Magazine is to
be and thence still south straight upon Prag in conjunction with his
Majesty or parallel to him _HeldenGeschichte_ i 1081 These are
the Two Saxon Columns The Third Column under Schwerin collects itself
in the interior of Silesia is issuing by Glatz Country through the
Giant Mountains BOHMISCHE KAMME Bohemian COMBS as they are called
which Tourists know by the Pass of Braunaudisturbing the dreams of
Rubezahl if Rubezahl happen to be there This say 20000 will come
down upon Prag from the eastern side and be first on the ground 31st
Augustfirst by one day In the home parts of Silesia well eastward
of Glatz there is left another Force of 20000 which can go across the
Austrian Border there and hang upon the Hills threatening Olmutz and
the Moravian Countries should need be

And so in its Three Columns from west from north from east the
march with a steady swiftness proceeds Important especially those
Two Saxon Columns from west and north 60000 of them with a frightful
ENTSETZLICH quantity of big guns coming up the Elbe Much is coming
up the Elbe indispensable Highway for this Enterprise Three months
provisions endless artillery and provender is on the Elbe 480 big
boats with immense VORSPANN of tracehorses dreadful swearing too
as I have heard will pass through the middle of Dresden not landing
by any means No be assured of it ye Dresdeners all flurried
palisaded barricaded no hair of you shall be harmed After a day or
two the flurry of Saxony subsided Prussians under strict discipline
molest no private person pay their way keep well aloof to south and
to north of Dresden all but the necessary ammunitionescorts doand
require of the Official people nothing but what the Law of the
Reich authorizes to Imperial Auxiliaries in such case The Saxons
themselves Friedrich observes had some 40000 but scattered
about King in Warsawdreadful terror making COUPURES and
TETESDEPONTcould have made no defence Had we diligently spent
eight days on them reflects he afterwards To seize Saxony and hobble
it with ropes so that at any time you could pin it motionless and
even if need were milk the substance out of it would not have
detained us eight days  _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii 53 Which would
have been the true plan had we known what was getting ready there
Certain it is Friedrich did no mischief paid for everything anxious
to keep well with Saxony hoping always they might join him again
in such a Cause Cause dear to every Patriot German Prince urges
Friedrichthough Bruhl and the Polish once Moravian Majesty are
of a very different opinion

Maria Theresa her thoughts at hearing of it may be imagined The Evil
Genius of my House afoot again My high projects on Elsass and Lorraine
Husband for Kaiser Elsass for the Reich and him Lorraine for myself
and him gone probably to water Nevertheless she said an Official
person heard her say My right is known to God God will protect me
as He has already done  _HeldenGeschichte_ ii 1024 And rose very
strong and magnanimously defiant again perhaps at the bottom of her
heart almost glad withal that she would now have a stroke for her
dear Silesia again unhindered by Paladin George and his Treaties
and notions What measures against this nefarious Prussian outbreak
hateful to gods and men are possible she rapidly takes in Bohemia
in Bavaria and her other Countries that are threatened or can help And
abates nothing of heart or hopepraying withal immensely she and
her People according to the mode they have Sending for Prince Karl we
need not say doublequick as the very first thing

Of Maria Theresa in Hungaryfor she ran to Presburg again with her
woes August 16th Diet just assembling therelet us say only that
Hungary was again chivalrous that old Palfy and the general Hungarian
Nation answered in the old toneVIVAT MARIA AD ARMA AD ARMA with
Tolpatches Pandours Warasdinsand in short that great and small
in infinite Insurrection have still a stroke of battle in them
PRO REGE NOSTRO Scarcely above a District or two as the JASZERS and
KAUERS in their overcautious way making the least difficulty Much
enthusiasm and unanimity in all the others here and there a Hungarian
gentleman complaining scornfully that their troops known as among
the best fighters in Nature are called irregular troopsirregular
forsooth In one public consultation District not important not very
spellable though doubtless pronounceable by natives to it a gentleman
suggests that Winter is near should not there be some slight provision
of tents of shelter in the frozen sleety Mountains to our gallant
fellows bound thither Upon which another starts up When our
Ancestors came out of Asia Minor over the Palus Maeotis bound in winter
ice and sabre in hand cut their way into this fine Country which
is still ours what shelter had they No talk of tents of barracks or
accommodation there each wrapt in his sheep skin found it shelter
sufficient Tents  _HeldenGeschichte_ ii 1030 And the thing was
carried by acclamation

Wide wail in Bohemia that War is coming back Nobility all making off
some to Vienna or the intermediate Towns lying thitherward some to
their Countryseats all out of Prag Willing mind on the part of the
Common People which the Government strains every nerve to make the most

Meanwhile Friedrichs march from west from north from east is flowing
on diligent swift punctual to its times its places and meets no
impediment to speak of At Tetschen on the SaxonBohemian Frontiera
pleasant Schloss perched on its crags as Tourists know where the
Elbe sweeps into Saxon Switzerland and its long stone labyrinthsat
Tetschen the Austrians had taken post had tried to block the River
driving piles into it and tumbling boulders into it with a view to
stop the 480 Prussian Boats These people needed to be torn out their
piles and they which was done in two days the soldier part of it
and occupied the boatmen above a week before all was clear again

night at Wittenberg Through Mieissen Torgau Freyberg is at
Peterswalde eastern slope of the Metal Mountains August 25th all the
Columns now on Bohemian ground

Friedrich had crossed Elbe by the Bridge of Meissen on the
southern shore politely waiting to receive his Majesty there stood
Feldmarschall the Duke of Weissenfels to whom the King gave his hand
no doubt in friendly style and talked for above half an hourwith
such success thinks Friedrich by and by We have heard of Weissenfels
before the same poor Weissenfels who was Wilhelminas Wooer in old
time now on the verge of sixty an extremely polite but weakish old
gentleman accidentally preserved in History One of those conspicuous
Human ClothesHorses phantasmal all but the digestive part which
abound in that Eighteenth Century and others like it and distress

CommanderinChief here Has been in Turk and other Wars with little
profit to himself or others Used to like his glass they say is still
very poor though now Duke in reality as well as title succeeded two
egregious Brothers some years since who had been spendthrift he has
still one other beating to get in this worldfrom Friedrich next year
Died altogether two years hence and Wilhelmina heard no more of him

At Meissen Bridge say some was this Halfhours Interview at
Pirna the Bridge of Pirna others say See Orlich ii 25
and _HeldenGeschichte_ ii 1166quite indifferent to us which At
Pirna and hither and thither in Saxon Switzerland Friedrich certainly
was Who ever saw such positions your Majesty For Friedrich is
always looking out were it even from the window of his carriage and
putting military problems to himself in all manner of scenery What
would a man do in that kind of ground if attacking if attacked with
that hill that brook that bit of bog and advises every Officer to
be continually doing the like MILITARY INSTRUCTIONS RULES FOR A
GOOD COMMANDER OF cI have for certain read this Passage but the
reference is gone again like a sparrow from the housetop That is the
value of picturesque or other scenery to Friedrich and their effect on

And so they are all assembled about Prag begirdling the poor
Citythird Siege it has stood within these three years since that
moonlight November night in 1741and are only waiting for their heavy
artillery to begin battering The poor inhabitants in spite of three
sieges the 10000 raw militiamen mostly of Hungarian breed the 4000
regulars and Harsch and old Ogilvy are all disposed to do their best
Friedrich is naturally in haste to get hold of Prag But he finds on
taking survey that the swordinhand method is not now as in 1741
feasible at all that the place is in good posture of strength and
will need a hot battering to tear it open Owing to that accident at
Tetschen the siegecannon are not yet come up Build your batteries
your Moldaubridges your communications till the cannon come and
beware of Bathyani meddling with your cannon by the road

Bathyani is within twenty miles of us at Beraun a compact little Town

more force than Friedrich guesses Drive him out seize that Magazine
of his orders Friedrich September 5th and despatches General
Hacke on it a right manat whose wedding we assisted wedding to
an heiress long since in Friedrich Wilhelms time if anybody now
remembered And on the morrow there falls out a pretty little Action
of Beraun about which great noise was made in the Gazettes PRO and
CONTRA which did not dislodge Bathyani by airy means but which might
easily have ruined the impetuous Hacke and his 6000 getting into
masked batteries Pandour whirlwinds charges of horses from
front from rear and from both flankshad not he with masterly
promptitude whirled himself out of it snatched instantly what best

Seyfarth _Beylage_ i 136 137 Brilliant little action well
performed on both sides but leading to nothing and which shall not
concern us farther Except to say that Bathyani did now more at his
leisure retire out of harms way and begin collecting Magazines at
Pilsen far rearward which may prove useful to Prince Karl in the route
Prince Karl is upon

Siegecannon having at last come September 8th the batteries are all
mountedon Wednesday 9th late at night the Artillery in enormous
quantity opens its dread throat poor Prag is startled from its bed
by torrents of shot solid and shell from three different quarters and
makes haste to stand to its guns From three different quarters
from Bubenetsch northward from the Upland of St Lawrence famed
WEISSENBERG or WhiteHill westward and from the Ziscaberg eastward
Hill of Zisca where iron Zisca posted himself on a grand occasion
oncewhich latter is a broad long Hill west end of it falling
sheer over Prag and on another point of it highest point of all the
Praguers have a strong battery and works The Prag guns otherwise are
not too effectual planted mostly on low ground By much the best Prag
battery is this of the Ziscaberg And this after two days experience
had of it the Prussians determine to take on the morrow

SEPTEMBER 12th Schwerin who commands on that side assaults
accordingly with the due steadfastness and stormfulness throwing
shells and balls by way of prelude Friedrich with some group of
staffofficers and dignitaries steps out on the Bubenetsch post to see
how this affair of the Ziscaberg will prosper the Praguers thereabouts
seeing so many dignitaries turn cannon on them Disperse IHR HERREN
have a care cried Friedrich not himself much minding so intent upon
the Ziscaberg And could have skipt indifferently over your cannonballs
ploughing the groundhad not one fateful ball shattered out the life
of poor Prince Wilhelm a good young Cousin of his shot down here at
his hand Doubtless a sharp moment for the King Prince Margraf Wilhelm
and a poor young page there they lie dead indifferent to the Ziscaberg
and all coming wars of mankind Lamentation naturally for this young
manBrother to the one who fell at Mollwitz youngest Brother of the
Margraf Karl who commands in this Bubenetsch redoubtBut we must lift
our eyeglass again see how Schwerin is prospering Schwerin with due
steadfastness and stormfulness after his prelude of bombshells rushes
on doublequick cannot be withstood hurls out the Praguers and seizes
their battery a ruinous loss to them

Their grand Zisca redoubt is gone then and two subsidiary small
redoubts behind it withal which the French had built and named the
magpienests NIDS A PIE these also are ours And we overhang from
our Zisca Hill the very roofs as it were and there is nothing but a
long bare curtain now in this quarter ready to be battered in breach
and soon holed if needful It is not needfulnot quite In the course
of three days more our Bubenetsch battery of enormous power has been
so diligent it has set fire to the Watermill burns irretrievably the
Watermill and still worse the wooden Sluice of the Moldau so that
the river falls to the everywhere wadable pitch And Governor Harsch
perceives that all this quarter of the Town is open to any comerand
in fact that he will have to get away the best he can

White flag accordingly Tuesday 15th Free withdrawal to the
Wischerad wont you By no manner of means answers Friedrich
Bids Schwerin from his Ziscaberg make a hole or two in that curtain
opposite him and gets ready for storm Upon which Harsch next morning
has to beat the chamade and surrender Prisoner of War And thus
Wednesday 16th it is done a siege of one week no moreafter
all that thrashing of grain drilling of militia and other spirited
preparation Harsch could not help it the Prussian cannonading was
so furious Orlich ii 3639 _HeldenGeschichte_ i 1082 and ii

Chapter IIIFRIEDRICH DILIGENT IN HIS BOHEMIAN CONQUESTS
UNEXPECTEDLY COMES UPON PRINCE KARL WITH NO FRENCH ATTENDING HIM

This electrically sudden operation on Prag was considered by astonished
mankind whatever else they might think about it a decidedly brilliant
feat of War falling like a bolt out of the bluelike three bolts
suddenly coalescing over Prag and striking it down Friedrich himself
though there is nothing of boast audible here or anywhere was evidently
very well satisfied and thought the aspects good There is Prince Karl
whirling instantly back from his Strasburg Prospects the general St
Vitus Dance of Austrian things rising higher and higher in these home
partsreasonable hope that in the course of one Campaign proud
obstinate Austria might feel itself so wrung and screwed as to be glad
of Peace with neighbors not wishing War That was the young
Kings calculation at this time And had France done at all as it
promisedor had the young King himself been considerably wiser than he
washe had not been disappointed in the way we shall see

Friedrich admits he did not understand War at this period His own
scheme now was To move towards the southwest there to abolish Bathyani
and his Tolpatches who are busy gathering Magazines for Prince Karls
advent to seize the said Magazines which will be very useful to us
then advance straight towards the Passes of the Bohemian Mountains
Towns of Furth Waldmunchen unfortunate Town of Cham burnt by Trenck
where masons are now busy these stand successive in the grand Pass
through which the highway runs some hundred miles or so from where
we are march at ones swiftest thitherward Bathyanis Magazines to
help and there await Prince Karl It was Friedrichs own notion not a
bad one though not the best The best he admits would have been
To stay pretty much where he was abolish Bathyanis Tolpatch people
seizing their Magazines and collecting others in general well rooting
and fencing himself in Prag and in the Circles that lie thereabouts
upon the Elbebounded to southward by the Sazawa branch of the
Moldau which runs parallel to the Elbebut well refusing to stir
much farther at such an advanced season of the year

That second plan would have been the wisestthen why not follow it
Too tame a plan for the youthful mind Besides we perceive as indeed
is intimated by himself he dreaded the force of public opinion in
France Aha look at your King of Prussia again Gone to conquer
Bohemia and except the Three Circles he himself is to have of it
lets Bohemia go to the winds This sort of thing Friedrich admits he
dreaded too much at that young period so loud had the criticisms
been on him in the time of the Breslau Treaty Out upon your King of
Prussia call you that an honorable Ally Undoubtedly a weakness in the
young King inasmuch says he as every General and every man add we
should look to the fact not to the rumor of the fact Well but at
least he will adopt his own other notion that of making for the Passes
of the Bohemian Mountains to abolish Bathyani at least and lock the
door upon Prince Karls advent That was his own plan and though
secondbest that also would have done well had there been no third

But there was as we hinted a third plan ardently favored by
Belleisle whose wartalent Friedrich much respected at this time plan
built on Belleisles reminiscences of the old TaborBudweis businesses
and totally inapplicable now Belleisle said Go southeast not
southwest right towards the Austrian Frontier itself that will
frighten Austria into a fine tremor Shut up the roads from Austria
Budweis Neuhaus seize those two Highroad Towns and keep them if you
would hold Bohemia the want of them was our ruin there Your ruin
yes but your enemy was not coming from Alsace and the southwest then
He was coming from Austria and your own home lay on the southwest it
is all different now Friedrich might well think himself bewitched not
to have gone for Cham and Furth and the Passes of the BohmerWald
according to his own notion But so it was he yielded to the big
reputation of Belleisle and to fear of what the world would say of him
in France a weakness which he will perhaps be taught not to repeat In
fact he is now about to be taught several thingsand will have to pay
his schoolwages as he goes




FRIEDRICH LEAVING SMALL GARRISON IN PRAG RUSHES SWIFTLY UP THE MOLDAU
VALLEY UPON THE TABORBUDWEIS COUNTRY TO PLEASE HIS FRENCH FRIENDS

Friedrich made no delay in Prag in haste at this late time of year
September 17th on the very morrow of the Siege the Prussians get in
motion southward on the 19th Friedrich from his post to north of the
City defiles through Prag on march to Kunraditzfirst stage on that
questionable Expedition up the Moldau Valley right bank towards Tabor
Budweis Neuhaus to threaten Austria and please Belleisle and the
French

Prag is left under General Einsiedel with a small garrison of
5000Einsiedel a steady elderly gentleman favorite of Friedrich
Wilhelms has brief order or outline of order to be filled up by his
own good sense Posadowsky follows the march with as many mealwagons
as possibledraughtcattle in very ineffectual condition Our main
Magazine is at Leitmeritz should have been brought on to Prag thinks
Friedrich Commissariat very illmanaged in comparison to what it ought
to beto what it shall be if we ever live to make another Campaign
Heavy artillery is left in Prag another fault and from each regiment
one of its baggagewagons  _HeldenGeschichte_ i 1083 Orlich ii
41 et seqq _Frederic_ iii 59 c We rest a day here at Kunraditz
21st September get to the Sazawa River22d to Bistritz rest a
day26th to Miltschin and 27th to TaborBut the Diary would be
tedious

Friedrich goes in two Columns one along the great road towards Tabor
under Schwerin this and Friedrich mainly with him the other to the
right along the Rivers bank under Leopold Young Dessauer which has
to go by wild country roads or now and then roads of its own making
and much needs the pioneer a difficult march in the shortening days
Posadowsky follows with the proviant drawn by cattle of the horse and
ox species daily falling down starved great swearing there too
I doubt not General Nassau is vanguard and stretches forward
successfully at a much lighter pace

There are two Rivers considerable branches of the Moldau coming from
eastward which and first of them the Sazawa concern us here After
mounting the southern Uplands from Prag for a day or two you then begin
to drop again into the hollow of a River called Sazawa important in
Bohemian Wars It is of winding course the first considerable branch
of the Moldau rising in Teutschbrod Country seventy or eighty miles
to east of us in regard to Sazawa there is at present no difficulty
about crossing the Country being all ours After the Sazawa mount
again long miles day after day through intricate stony desolation
rocks bogs untrimmed woods you will get to Miltschin thence to
Tabor Miltschin is the crown of that rough moor country from Prag to
Tabor is some sixty miles After Miltschin the course of those brown
mountainbrooks is all towards the Luschnitz the next considerable
branch of the Moldau branch still longer and more winding than the
Sazawa Tabor towers up near this branch Budweis on the Moldau itself
is forty miles farther and there at last you are out of the stony
moors and in a rich champaign comfortable to man and horse were you
but once there after plodding through the desolations But from that
Sazawa by the Luschnitz on to Budweis mounting and falling in such
fashion there must be ninety miles or thereby Plod along and keep
a sharp eye on the whirling clouds of Pandours for those too have got
across upon usadded to the other tempests of Autumn

On the ninth day of their march the Prussians begin to descry on
the horizon ahead the steeples and chimneytops of Tabor on its high
scarped rock or Hill of Ziscafor it was Zisca and his Hussites
that built themselves this Bit of Inexpugnability and named it Tabor
from their Biblesin those waste mountain regions On the tenth day
27th September the Prussians without difficulty took Tabor walls
being ruined garrison small We lie at Tabor till the 30th last day
of September Thence 2d October part of us to MoldauTein rightwards
where cross the Moldau by a BridgeBridge one has heard of in old
Broglio timescross there with intent easily successful to snatch
that Castle of Frauenberg darling of Broglio for which he fought his
Pharsalia of a Sahay to no purpose

Both Columns got united at Tabor and paused for a day or two to rest
and gather up their draggled skirts there The Expedition does not
improve in promise as we advance in it the march one of the
most untowardly and Posadowsky comes up with only half of his
provisioncartshalf of his cattle having fallen down of bad weather
hillroads and starvation what could he do That is an ominous
circumstance not the less

Three things are against the Prussians on this march two of them
accidental things FIRST there is at this late season too the
intrinsic nature of the Country which Friedrich with emphasis describes
as boggy stony precipitous a waste hungry and altogether barren
Countrytoo emphatically so described But then SECONDLY what might
have been otherwise the Population worked upon by Austrian officials
all fly from the sight of us nothing but fireless deserted hamlets and
the corn if they ever had any all thrashed and hidden No amount
of money can purchase any service from them Poor dark creatures not
loving Austria much but loving some others even less it would appear
Of Bigoted Papist Creed for one thing that is a great point We do not
meddle with their worship more or less but we are Heretics and they
hate us as the Night Which is a dreadful difficulty you always have
in Bohemia nowhere but in the Circle of Konigsgraz where there
are Hussites far to the rear of us at this time will you find it
otherwise This is difficulty second

Then THIRDLY what much aggravates itwe neglected to abolish
Bathyani And here are Bathyanis Pandours come across the Moldau on
us Plenty of Pandoursto whom 10000 fresh Hungarians of a new
Insurrection which has been got up there are daily speeding forward to
add themselvessuch a swarm of hornets as darkens the very daylight
for you Vain to scourge them down to burn them off by blaze of
gunpowder they fly fast but are straightway back again They lurk in
these bushy wildernesses scraggy woods no foraging possible unless
whole regiments are sent out to do it you cannot get a letter safely
carried for them They are an unspeakable contemptible grief to the
earnest leader of menLet us proceed however it will serve nothing
to complain Let us hope the French sit well on the skirts of Prince
Karl these sorrowful labors may all turn to good in that case

Friedrich pushes on from Tabor shoots partly as we have seen across
the Moldau to the left bank as well captures romantic Frauenberg on
its high rock where Broglio got into such a fluster once We could
push to Pisek too and make a Bivouac of Pisek if we lost our wits
Nassau is in Budweis in Neuhaus and proper garrisons are gone thither
nothing wanting on our side of the business But these Pandours these
10000 Insurrection Hungarians with their Trencks spurring them A
continual unblessed swarm of hornets these which shut out the very
light of day from us Too literally the light of day we can get no
free messaging from part to part of our own Army even As many as six
Orderlies have been despatched to an outlying General and not one of
them could get through to him They have snapt up three Letterbags
destined for the King himself For four weeks he is absolutely shut out
from the rest of Europe knows not in the least what the Kaiser or the
Most Christian or any other King is doing or whether the French are
sitting well on Prince Karls skirts or not attempting that at all
This also is a thing to be amended a thing you had to learn your
Majesty An Army absolutely shut out from news from letters messages
to or fro and groping its way in darkness owing to these circumambient
thunderclouds of Tolpatches is not a wellsituated Army And alas
when at last the Letterbag did get through andBut let us not
anticipate

At Tabor there arose two opinions which in spite of the Kings
presence was a new difficulty South from Tabor a days march the
Highway splits direct way for Vienna lefthand goes to Neuhaus
righthand or straightforward rather goes to Budweis bearing upon
Linz which of these two Nassau has already seized Budweis and it is
a habitable champaign country in comparison Neuhaus farther from the
Moldau and its uses but more imminent on Austria would be easy to
seize and would frighten the Enemy more Leopold the Young Dessauer is
for Budweis rapid Schwerin a hardy outspoken man is emphatic for the
other place as Headquarter So emphatic are both that the two Generals
quarrel there and Friedrich needs his authority to keep them from
outbreaks from open incompatibility henceforth which would be
destructive to the service For the rest Friedrich seizes both places
sends a detachment to Neuhaus as well but holds by Budweis and the
Moldau region with his main Army which was not quite gratifying to the
hardy Schwerin On the opposite or left bank holding Frauenberg the
renowned Hillfortress there we make inroads at discretion but the
country is woody favorable to Pandours and the right bank is our chief
scene of action How we are to maintain ourselves in this country To
winter in these towns between the Sazawa and the Luschnitz Unless the
French sit well on Prince Karls skirts it will not be possible




THE FRENCH ARE LITTLE GRATEFUL FOR THE PLEASURE DONE THEM AT SUCH
RUINOUS EXPENSE

French sitting well on Prince Karls skirts They are not molesting
Prince Karl in the smallest never tried such a thingare turned away
to the Brisgan to the Upper Rhine Country gone to besiege Freyburg
there and seize Towns about the Lake of Constance as if there were no
Friedrich in the game It must be owned the French do liberally pay off
old scores against Friedrichif except in their own imagination
they had old scores against him No man ever delivered them from a more
imminent peril and they the rope once cut that was strangling
them magnificently forget who cut it and celebrate only their own
distinguished conduct during and after the operation To a degree truly
wonderful

It was moonlight clear as day that night 23d August when Prince Karl
had to recross the Rhine close in their neighborhood _Guerre de
Boheme_ iii 196and instead of harassing Prince Karl to half or to
whole ruin as the bargain was their distinguished conduct consisted
in going quietly to their beds old Marechal de Noailles even calling
back some of his too forward subalterns and joyfully leaving Prince
Karl then and afterwards to cross the Rhine and march for Bohmen at
his own perfect convenience

Seckendorf will sit on Karls skirts they said too late for US
this season next season you shall see Such was their theory
after Louis got that cathartic and rose from bed Schmettau with his
importunities which at last irritated everybody could make nothing
more of it Let the King of France crown his glories by the Siege of
Freyburg the conquest of Brisgaufor behoof of the poor Kaiser dont
you observe Hither Austria is the Kaisersand furthermore were
Freyburg gone there will be no invading of Elsass again which is
another privately very interesting point

And there at Freyburg the Most Christian King now is and his Army up
to the knees in mud conquering Hither Austria besieging Freyburg with
much difficulty owing to the wetbesieging there with what energy
a spectacle to the world And has for the present but one wife no
mistress either With rapturous eyes France looks on with admiration
too big for words Voltaire I have heard made pilgrimage to Freyburg
with rhymed Panegyric in his pocket saw those miraculous operations
of a Most Christian King miraculously awakened and had the honor to
present said Panegyric and be seen for the first time by the royal
eyeswhich did not seem to relish him much The Panegyric EPITRE AU
ROI DEVANT FRIBOURG is in _OEuvres de Voltaire_ xvii 184 Since the
first days of October Freyburg had been under constant assault amid
rains amid frosts a siege long and murderous to the besieging
partyand was not got till November 5th not quite entirely the
Citadels of it till November 25th Majesty gone home to Paris to
illuminations and triumphal arches in the interim Adelung iv 266
Barbier ii 414 13th November c for the illuminations grand in
the extreme in spite of wild rains and winds It had been a difficult
and bloody conquest to him this of Freyburg and the Brisgau Country
and I never heard that either the Kaiser or he got sensible advantage by
itthough Prince Karl on the present occasion might be said to get a
great deal

Seckendorf will do your Prince Karl they had cried always
Seckendorf and his Prussian Majesty Are not we conquering Hither
Austria here for the Kaisers behoof Seckendorf they did officially
appoint to pursue appoint or allowand laid all the blame on
Seckendorf who perhaps deserved his share of it Very certain it is
Seckendorf did little or nothing to Prince Karl marched leisurely
behind him through the OberPfalzskirting Baireuth Country Karl and
he to Wilhelminas grief Her Letters  _OEuvres de Frederic_ xxvii
i 133 cleisurely behind him at a distance of four days knew
better than meddle with Prince Karl So that Prince Karl in twentyone
marches disturbed only by the elements and bad roads reached
Waldmunchen 26th September in the FurthCham Country Ranke iii
187 and was heard to exclaim We are let off for the fright then
NOUS VOILA QUITTES POUR LA PEURSeckendorf finding nothing to live
upon in OberPfalz could not attend Prince Karl farther but turned
leftwards home to Bavaria made a kind of Second Reconquest of Bavaria
on exactly the same terms as the First Austrian occupants being all
called off to assist in Bohmen againconcerning which here is an
Excerpt

Seckendorf following at his leisure and joined by the Hessians and
Pfalzers so as now to exceed 30000 leaves Prince Karl and the rest of
the enterprise to do as it can and applies himself for his own share
as the needfulest thing to getting hold of Bavaria again that his poor
Kaiser may have where to lay his head and pay old servants their wages
Dreadfully exclaimed against the old gentleman especially by the
French comanagers Why did not the old traitor stick in the rear of
Prince Karl in the difficult passes and drive him pronewhile we
went besieging Freyburg and poaching about trying for a bit of the
Brisgau while chance served A traitor beyond doubt probably bought
with money down thinks Valori But after all what could Seckendorf
do He is now of weight for Barenklau and Bavaria not for much more He
does sweep Barenklau and his Austrians from Bavaria clear out in the
course of this October all but Ingolstadt and two or three strong
townsPassau especially which can be blockaded and afterwards
besieged if needful For the rest he is dreadfully illoff for
provisions incapable of the least attempt on Passau as Friedrich
urged on hearing of him again and will have to canton himself in
homequarters and live by his shifts till Spring

The noise of French censure rises loud against not themselves
but against SeckendorfFriedrich before that Tolpatch eclipse of
Correspondence when three of his Letterbags were seized and he fell
quite dark had too well foreboded and contemptuously expressed his
astonishment at the blame BOTH were well earning Passau said he
cannot you go at least upon Passau which might alarm the Enemy a
little and drag him homewards Adieu my dear Seckendorf your Officer
will tell you how we did the Siege of Prag You and your French are
wetted hens POULES MOUILLEEScowering about like drenched hens in a
day of set rain As I hear nothing of either of you I must try to get
out of this business without your helpotherwise it will be ill for
me indeed Excerpted Fragment of a Letter from Friedrichexact
date not given date of EXCERPT is Donanworth Country 23d September
1744which the French Agent in Seckendorfs Army had a reading of
_Campagnes de Coigny_ iv 185187 ib 216219 cited in Adelung iv
225 Which latter expression alarmed the French and set them upon
writing and bustling but not upon doing anything

Prince Karl had crossed the Rhine unmolested in the clearest
moonlight August 23d24th Seckendorf was not wholly got to Heilbronn
September 8th a pretty way behind Prince Karl The 6000 Hessians
formerly in English pay indignant Landgraf Wilhelm who never could
forgive that Machiavellian conduct of Carteret at Hanau never till he
found out what it really was has this year put into French pay And
they have now joined Seckendorf Espagnac ii 13 Buchholz ii 123
Prince Friedrich Britannic Majestys Soninlaw not good fat Uncle
George commanding them henceforthwith extreme lack of profit to
Prince Friedrich to the Hessians and to the French as will appear in
time These 6000 and certain thousands of Pfalzers likewise in French
pay are now with Seckendorf and have raised him to above 30000it
is the one fruit King Friedrich has got by that Union of Frankfurt
and by all his long prospective haggling and struggling for a Union
of German Princes in general Two pears after that long shaking of
the tree both pears rotten or indeed falling into Seckendorf who is
a basket of such quality Seckendorf increased in this munificent
manner can he still do nothing cry the French the old traitorI
have no magazines said Seckendorf nothing to live upon to shoot
with no money And it is a mutual crescendo between the perfidious
Seckendorf and them without work done In the Nurnberg Country some
Hussars of his picked up Lord Holderness an English Ambassador making
for Venice by that bad route Prisoner are not you But they did not
use him ill on consideration the Heads of Imperial Departments gave
him a Pass and he continued his Venetian Journey result of it zero
without farther molestation that I heard of Adelung iv 222

These FrenchSeckendorf cunctations recriminations and drenchedhen
procedures are an endless sorrow to poor Kaiser Karl who at length
can stand it no longer but resolves since at least Bavaria though
moneyless and in ruins is his he will in person go thither confident

being once burnt and indispensable sortings effected he went to the
field along with Seckendorf to encourage his men under Seckendorf and
urge the French by all considerations to come on And really did what
he could poor man But the cordage of his life had been so strained and
torn he was not now good for much alas it had been but little he was
ever good for A couple of dear Kurfursts his Father and he have stood

downwards




Chapter IVFRIEDRICH REDUCED TO STRAITS CANNOT MAINTAIN HIS MOLDAU
CONQUESTS AGAINST PRICE KARL

One may fancy what were Friedrichs reflections when he heard that
Prince Karl had prosperously and unmolested got across by those
Passes from the OberPfalz into Bohmen and the Circle of Pilsen into
junction with Bathyani and his magazines At Mirotitz October 2d
Ranke iii 194 Orlich ii 49 heard moreover that the Saxons
20000 strong under Weissenfels crossing the Metal Mountains coming
on by Eger and Karlsbad regions were about uniting with him bound by
Treaty to assist the Hungarian Majesty when invadedand had finally
what confirms everything that the said Prince Karl in person making
for Budweis just seen his advanced guard said rumor under mistake
was but few miles off Few miles off on the other side of the
Moldauof unknown strength hidden in the circumambient clouds of
Pandours

Suppressing all the rages and natural reflections but those needful for
the moment Friedrich October 4th by MoldauTein dashes across the
Moldau to seek Prince Karl at the place indicated and at once smite
him down if possiblethat will be a remedy for all things Prince Karl
is not there nor was the indication had been false Friedrich searches
about for four days to no purpose Prince Karl he then learns for
certain has crossed the Moldau farther down farther northward between
Prag and us Means to cut us off from Prag then which is our fountain
of life in these circumstances That is his intentionOld Traun who
is with him understands his trade thinks Friedrich Traun or the
Prince is diligently forming magazines all the Country carrying to
him in the Town of Beneschau hither side of the Sazawa some seventy
miles north of us an important Town where roads meetunless we can
get hold of Beneschau it will be ill with us here Across the River
again at any rate and let us hasten thither That is an affair which
must be looked to and speed is necessary

OCTOBER 8th After four days search ending in this manner Friedrich
swiftly crosses towards Tabor again to Bechin over on the Luschnitz
one march there to collect himself for Beneschau and the other
intricacies Towards Tabor again by his Bridge of MoldauTeinclouds
of Pandour people larger clouds than usual hanging round hidden by
the woods till Friedrich is gone Friedrich being gone there occurs the
AFFAIR OF MOLDAUTEIN much talked of in Prussian Books Of which in
extreme condensation this is the essence

OCTOBER 9th Friedrich once off to Bechin the Pandour clouds gather
on his rearguard next day at Tein Bridge here to the number of about
10000 rumor counts 14000 and with desperate intent and more
regularity than usual attack the TeinBridge Party which consists
of perhaps 2000 grenadiers and hussars the whole under Ziethens
chargeobliged to wait for a cargo of Breadwagons here Defend your
Bridge with cannon with caseshot that is what the grenadiers do
The Pandour cloud with horrid lanes cut in it draws back out of this
then plunges at the River itself which can be ridden above or below
rides it furious by the thousand Off with your infantry quit the
Bridge cries Ziethen to his Captain there Retire you Parthianlike
thricesteady orders Ziethen It is to be hoped our hussars can deal
with this maddoggery And they do it cutting in with iron discipline
with fierceness not undrilled a wedge of iron hussars with ditto
grenadiers continually wheeling like so many reapers steady among
windtossed grain and gradually give the Pandours enough Seven hours
of it in all of their sixty cartridges the grenadiers had fired
fiftyfour when it ended about 7 PM The coming Breadwagons
getting word had to cast their loaves into the River sad to think of
and make for Bechin at their swiftest But the rearguard got off with
its guns in this victorious manner thanks to MajorGeneral Ziethen
Colonel Reusch and the others concerned _Feldzuge der Preussen_ i
268 Orlich ii 55

Ziethen handsels his MajorGeneralcy in this fine way Patent given
him 3d October 1744 only a week ago and ordered to be dated eight
months back Rodenbeck i 109 a man who has had promotion and also
has had none and may again come to have noneand is able to do either
way Never mind my excellent tacit friend Ziethen is fiveandforty
gone has a face which is beautiful to me though one of the coarsest
Face thricehonest intricately ploughed with thoughts which are well
kept silent the thoughts indeed being themselves mostly inarticulate
thoughts of a simplehearted muchenduring hottempered son of
iron and oatmealdecidedly rather likable with its lazily hanging
underlip and respectable bearskin cylinder atop




FRIEDRICH TRIES TO HAVE BATTLE FROM PRINCE KARL IN THE MOLDAU
COUNTRIES CANNOT OWING TO THE SKILL OF PRINCE KARL OR OF OLD
FELDMARSCHALL TRAUNHAS TO RETIRE BEHIND THE SAZAWA AND ULTIMATELY
BEHIND THE ELBE WITH MUCH LABOR IN VAIN

OCTOBER 14th18th RETREAT FROM BECHINTABOR COUNTRY TO BENESCHAU 
These Pandours give us trouble enough no Magazine here no living to
be had in this Country beside them Unfortunate Colonel Jahnus went out
from Tabor lately to look after requisitioned grains infinite Pandours
set upon him Muhlhausen is the memorable place Jahnus was obstinate
too obstinate thinks Friedrich and perished on the ground he and
200 of his  _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii 61 Nay next a swarm of
them came to Tabor itself Nadasti at their head to try whether Tabor
with its small garrison could not be escaladed and perhaps Prince
Henri who lies sick there be taken Tabor taught them another lesson
sent them home with heads brokenwhich Friedrich thinks was an
extremely suitable thing But so it stands Here by the thousand and the
ten thousand they hang round us and Prince KarlIt is of all things
necessary we get hold of that Beneschau and the Magazine he is
gathering there

Rapidity is indispensableand yet how quit Tabor We have detachments
out at Neuhaus at Budweis and in Tabor 300 men in hospital whom there
are no means of carrying To leave them to the Tolpaches Friedrich
confesses he was weak on this occasion he could not leave these 300
men as was his clear duty in this extremity of War He ordered in his
Neuhaus Detachment not yet any of the others He despatched Schmerin
towards Beneschau with all his speed Schwerin was lucky enough to
take Beneschau and its provendera most blessed fortuneand fences
himself there Hearing which Friedrich having now got the Neuhaus
Detachment in hand orders the other Three the Budweis the Tabor here
and the Frauenberg across the River to maintain themselves and
then leaving those southern regions to their chance hastens towards
Beneschau and Schwerin encamps October 18th near BeneschauCamp of
Konopischt unattackable Camp celebrated in the Prussian Booksand
there for eight days still on the south side of Sazawa tries every
shift to mend the bad posture of affairs in that LuschnitzSazawa
Country His Three Garrisons 3000 men in them besides the 300 sick
he now sees will not be able to maintain themselves and he sends in
succession eight messengers not one messenger of whom could get
through to bid them come away His own hope now is for a Battle
with Prince Karl which might remedy all things _OEuvres de
Frederic_ iii 6264

That is Friedrichs wish but it is by no means Trauns who sees that
hunger and wet weather will of themselves suffice for Friedrich There
ensues accordingly for three weeks to come in that confused Country
a series of swift shufflings checkings and manoeuvrings between these
two which is gratifying and instructive to the strategic mind but
cannot be inflicted upon common readers Two considerable chessplayers
an old and a young their chessboard a bushy rocky marshy
parallelogram running fifty miles straight east from Prag and twenty
or fewer south of which Prag is the northwest angle and Beneschau or
the impregnable Konopischt the southwest the reader must conceive it
and how Traun will not fight Friedrich yet makes him skip hither and
thither chiefly by threatening his victuals Friedrichs main magazine
is now at Pardubitz the extreme northeast angle of the parallelogram
Parallelogram has one river in it with the innumerable rocks and
brooks and quagmires the river Sazawa and on the north side where are
Kuttenberg Czaslau Chotusitz places again become important in
this business it is bounded by another river the Elbe Intricate
manoeuvring there is here for three weeks following old Traun an
admirable man thinks Friedrich who ever after recognized Traun as his
Schoolmaster in the art of War We mark here and there a date and leave
it to readers

RADICZ OCTOBER 21st22d At Radicz a march to southwest of us and on
our side of the Moldau the Saxons under Weissenfels 20000 effective
join Prince Karl which raises his force to 69514 men some 10000 more
than Friedrich is master of Orlich ii 66 Prospect of wintering
between the Luschnitz and the Sazawa there is now little unless they
will fight us and be beaten Friedrich from his inaccessible Camp of
Konopischt manoeuvres reconnoitres in all directions to produce
this result but to no purpose An Austrian Detachment did come to look
after Beneschau and the Magazines there but rapidly drew back again
finding Konopischt on their road and how matters were Friedrich
will guard the door of this SazawaElbe tract of Country hope of the
SazawaLuschnitz tract has in few days fallen extinct Here is
news come to Konopischt our Three poor Garrisons Budweis Tabor
Frauenberg already all lost guns and men after defence to the
last cartridgein Frauenberg their water was cut off it was
eightandforty hours of thirst at Frauenbergone way or other they
are all Three gone eight couriers galloping with message Come away
were all picked up by the Pandours so they stood and were lost Three
thousand fighting men gone for the weak chance of saving three hundred
who were in hospital thinks Friedrich War is not a school of the
weak pities For the chance of ten you lose a hundred and the ten too
SazawaElbe tract of country let us vigilantly keep the door of that

SATURDAY OCTOBER 24th Friedrich out reconnoitring from Konopischt
discovers of a certainty that the whole AustrianSaxon force is
now advaucing towards Beneschau and will this night encamp at
Marschowitz to southwest only one march from us On the instant
Friedrich hurries back gets his Army on march thitherward though the
late October sun is now past noon off instantly a stroke yonder will
perhaps be the cure of all Such roads we had says Friedrich as never
Army travelled before long after nightfall we arrive near the Austrian
camp bivouac as we can till daylight return At the first streak of
day Friedrich and his chief generals are on the heights with their
spyglasses Austrian Army sure enough and there they have altered
their posture overnight for Traun too has been awake they lie now
opposite our RIGHT flank on a scarped height at the foot of which
through swamps and quagmires runs a muddy stream Unattackable on this
side their right flank and foot are safe enough Creep round and see
their leftNothing but copses swampy intricacies We may shoulder
arms again and go back to Konopischt no fight here _OEuvres
de Frederic_ iii 63 64 Orlich ii 69 Speaking of defensive
Campaigns says Friedrich didactically years afterwards If such
situations are to answer the purpose intended the front and flanks must
be equally strong but the rear entirely open Such for instance
are those heights which have an extensive front and whose flanks are
covered by morassesas was Prince Karls Camp at Marschowitz in the
year 1744 with its front covered by a stream and the wings by deep
hollows or that which we ourselves then occupied at Konopischtas you
well remember _Military Instructions_ above cited p 44

OCTOBER 26thNOVEMBER 1st The SazawaLuschnitz tract of Country is
quite lost then lost with damages the question now is Can we keep
the SazawaElbe tract For about three weeks more Friedrich struggles
for that object cannot compass that either Want of horseprovender is
very greatcountry entirely eaten say the peasants and not a truss
remaining October 26th Friedrich has to cross the Sazawa we must quit
the door of that tract hunger driving us and fight for the interior
in detail Traun gets to Beneschau in that cheap way and now in behalf
of Traun the peasants find forage enough being zealous for Queen and
creed Pandours spread themselves all over this SazawaElbe country
endanger our subsistences make our lives miserable It is the old
story Friedrich famine and mud and misery of Pandours compelling
has to retire northward Elbeward inch by inch whither the Austrians
follow at a safe distance and in spite of all manoeuvring cannot be
got to fight

Brave General Nassau who much distinguishes himself in these
businesses has though Friedrich does not yet know it dexterously
seized Kolin westward in those Elbe partsground that will be notable
in years coming Important little feat of Nassaus of which anon On
the other hand our Magazine at Pardubitz eastward on the Elbe is
not out of danger Pandours and regulars 2000 and odd sixty of the
Pandour kind disguised as peasants leading haycarts made an attempt
there lately but were detected by the vigilant Colonel and blown to
pieces in the nick of time some of them actually within the gate
 _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii 65 Nay a body of Austrian regulars were
in full march for Kolin lately intending to get hold of the Elbe
itself at that point midway between Prag and Pardubitz but the prompt
General Nassau as we remarked had struck in before them and now holds
Kolinthough for several days Friedrich could not tell what had
become of Nassau owing to the swarms of Pandours

Friedrich standing with his back to Prag which is fifty miles from
him and rather in need of his support than able to give him any and
drawing his meal from the uncertain distance with Pandours hovering
roundis in difficult case While old Traun is kept luminous as
midday the circumambient atmosphere of Pandours is tenebrific to
Friedrich keeps him in perpetual midnight He has to read his position
as with flashes of lightning for most part A heavyladen sorely
exasperated man and must keep his haggard miseries strictly secret
which I believe he does Were Valori here it is very possible he might
find the countenance FAROUCHE again eyes gloomy on damp November
mornings Schwerin in a huff has gone home Since your Majesty is
pleased to prefer his young Durchlaucht of Anhalts advice what can
an elderly servant not without rheumatisms do otherWell answers
Friedrich not with eyes cheered by the phenomenon The ElbeSazawa
tract even this looks as if it would be hard to keep A world very dark
for Friedrich enveloped so by the ill chances and the Pandours But
what help

From the French Camp far away there comes dated 17th October
third week of their Siege of Freyburg by way of help to Friedrich
magnanimous promise So soon as this Siege is done which will be
speedily though it is difficult we propose to send fifty battalions
and a hundred squadronssay only 60000 horse and foot not a hoof
or toe of which ever got that length on actually trying ittowards
Westphalia to bring the Elector of Koln to reason poor Kaisers lanky
Brother who cannot stand the French procedures and has lately sold
himself that is sold his troops to England and keep the King of
England and the Dutch in checkby way of solacement to your Majesty
Will you indeed you magnanimous AlliesThis was picked up by the
Pandours and I know not but Friedrich was spared the useless pain of
reading it Orlich ii 73

NOVEMBER 1st9th FRIEDRICH LOSES SAZAWAELBE COUNTRY TOO On the first
day of November here is a lightningflash which reveals strange things
to Friedrich Trauns late manoeuvrings which have been so enigmatic
to right and to left upon Prag and other points issue now in an
attempt towards Pardubitz which reveals to Friedrich the intention
Traun has formed of forcing him to choose one of those two places and
let go the other Formidable fatal thinks Friedrich and yet admirable
on the part of Traun a design beautiful and worthy of admiration If
we stay near Prag what becomes of our communication with Silesia what
becomes of Silesia itself If we go towards Pardubitz Prag and Bohmen
are lost What to do Despatch reinforcement to Pardubitz thanks to
Nassau the KolinPardubitz road is ours That is done Pardubitz saved
for the moment Could we now get to Kuttenberg before the old Marshal
his design were overset altogether Alas we cannot march at once have
to wait a day for the bread Forward nevertheless and again forward
and again three heavy marches in November weather let us make a fourth
forced march start tomorrow before dawnKuttenberg above all things
In vain tomorrow 4th November there is such a fog dark as London
itself from six in the morning onwards no starting till noon and then
impossible with all our efforts to reach Kuttenberg We have to halt
an eight miles short of it in front of Kolin and pitch tents there On
the morrow 5th November Traun is found encamped unattackable between
us and our object sits there at his ease in a friendly Country with
Pandour whirlpools flowing out and in an irreducible case to Friedrich
November 5th and for three days more Friedrich to no purpose tries
his utmostfinds he will have to give up the ElbeSazawa region like
the others Monday November 9th Friedrich gathers himself at Kolin
crosses the Elbe by Kolin Bridge that day Point after point of the
game going against him

Kolin was of course attacked that Monday evening so soon as the main
Army crossed but so soon as the Army left General Nassau had taken
his measures and with his great guns and his small handled the
Pandours in a way that pleased us  _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii 68
Thursday night following they came back with regular grenadiers to
support under cloud of night in great force ruffian Trenck at the
head of them a frightful phenomenon to weak nerves But this also
Nassau treated in such a fiery fashion that it vanished without return
three hundred dead left on the ground and ruffian Trenck riding off
with his own crown brokenbeautiful indigo face streaking itself into
GINGHAMpattern for the moment

Except Pardubitz where also the due battalions are left Friedrich now
holds no post south of the Elbe in this quarter ElbeSazawa Tract is
gone like the others to all appearance And we must now say Silesia
or Prag Prince Leopold CouncilofWar being held on the matter is for
keeping hold of Prag Pity to lose all the excellent siegeartillery we
brought thither says he True too true an illmanaged business
that of Prag thinks Friedrich sadly to himself but what is Prag and
artillery compared to Silesia Parthian retreat into Silesia and
let Prag and the artillery go that to Friedrich is clearly the sure
course Or perhaps the fatal alternative will not actually arrive So
long as Pardubitz and Kolin hold and we have the Elbe for barrier
Truth is Prince Karl has himself written to Court that having now
pushed his Enemy fairly over the Elbe and winter being come with its
sleets and slushes ruinous to troops that have been so marched about
the Campaign ought to endnay his own young Wife is in perilous
interesting circumstances and the poor Prince wishes to be home To
which however it is again understood Maria Theresa has emphatically
answered Nofinish first

NOVEMBER 9th19th WE DEFEND THE ELBE RIVER Friedrich has posted
himself on the north shore of the Elbe from Pardubitz to the other side
of Kolin means to defend that side of the River where go the Silesian
roads At Bohdenetz short way across from Pardubitz he himself is
Prince Leopold is near Kolin thirty miles of riverbank to dispute
The controversy lasts ten days ends in ELBETEINITZ a celebrated
passage in Books and otherwise Friedrich is in shaggy intricate
country no want of dingles woods and quagmires now and then pleasant
places toohere is Kladrup for example where our Father came three
hundred miles to dine with the Kaiser once The grooms and colts are
all off at present Father and Kaiser are off and much is changed since
then Grim tussle of War now sleety winter and the Giant Mountains in
the distance getting on their white hoods Friedrich doubtless has
his thoughts as he rides up and down in sight of Kladrup among other
places settling many things but what his thoughts were he is careful
not to say except where necessary Much is to be looked after in this
River controversy of thirty miles Detachments lie at intervals all
the way and mounted sentries a sentry every five miles patrol the
Riverbank vigilant we hope as lynxes Nothing can cross but alarm
will be given and by degrees the whole Prussian force be upon it This
is the Circle of Konigsgratz this that now lies to rear and happily
there are a few Hussites in it not utterly indisposed to do a little
spying for us and bring a glimmering of intelligence now and then

It is now the second week that Frietrich has lain so with his mounted
patrols in motion with his Hussite spies guarding Arguslike this
thirty miles of River and the Austrians attempt nothing or nothing
with effect If the Austrians go home to their winterquarters he hopes
to issue from Kolin again before Spring and to sweep the ElbeSazawa
Tract clear of them after all Maria Theresa having answered No it is
likely the Austrians will try to get across Be vigilant therefore
ye mounted sentries Or will they perhaps make an attempt on Prag
Einsiedel who has no garrison of the least adequacy apprises us That
in all the villages round Prag people are busy making ladderswhat
can that mean Friedrich has learned by intercepted letters that
something great is to be done on Wednesday 18th he sends Rothenburg
with reinforcement to Einsiedel lest a scalade of Prag should be on
the cards Rothenburg is right welcome in the lines of Prag though with
reinforcement still ineffectual but it is not Prag that is meant nor
is Wednesday the day Through Wednesday Friedrich all eye and ear
could observe nothing much marching to and fro on the Austrian side of
the River but apparently it comes to nothing The mounted patrols had
better be vigilant however

On the morrow 5 AM what is this that is going on Audible booming of
cannon of musketry and battle echoing through the woods penetrates to
Friedrichs quarters at Bohdenetz in the Pardubitz region Attack upon
Kolin Nassau defending himself there Out swift scouts and see Many
scouts gallop out but none comes back Friedrich for hours has to
remain uncertain can only hope Nassau will defend himself Boom go the
distant volleyings no scout comes back And it is not Nassau or Kolin
it is something worse very glorious for Prussian valor but ruinous to
this Campaign

The Austrians at 2 oclock this morning Austrians and Saxons came in
great force in dead silence to the south brink of the River opposite
a place called Teinitz ElbeTeinitz ten miles east of Kolin that
was the fruit of their marching yesterday They sat there forbidden to
speak to smoke tobacco or do anything but breathe till all was ready
till pontoons cannons had come up and some gleam of dawn had broken
At the first gleam of dawn as they are shoving down their pontoon
boats there comes a WERDA Who goes from our Prussian patrol across
the River Receiving no answer he fires and is himself shot down One
Wedell Wedell and Ziethen who keep watch in this part start instantly
at sound of these shots and make a dreadful day of it for these
invasive Saxon and Austrian multitudes Naturally too they send off
scouts galloping for more help to the right and to the left But that
avails not Wild doggery of Pandours it would seem have already swum
or waded the River above Teinitz and belowWant of vigilance barks
Friedrich impatiently but such a doggery is difficult to watch with
effect At any rate to the right and to the left the woods are already
beset with Pandours every scout sent out is killed and to east or to
west there comes no news but an echoing of musketry a boom of distant
cannon Orlich ii 8285 SaxonAustrian battalions four or five
with unlimited artillery going VERSUS Wedells one battalion with
musketry and Ziethens hussars it is fearful odds The Prussians stand
to it like heroes doggedly for four hours continue the
disputetill it is fairly desperate two bridges of the enemys now
finishedwhereupon they manoeuvre off with Parthian or Prussian
countenance into the woods safe towards Kolin despatching definite
news to Friedrich which does arrive about 11 AM and sets him at once
on new measures

This is a great feat in the Prussian military annals for which sad
as the news was Wedell got the name of Leonidas attached to him by
Friedrich himself And indeed it is a gallant passage of war Forcing
of the Elbe at Teinitz of which I could give two Narratives one from
the Prussian and one from the Saxon side Seyfarth _Beylage_ i
595598 _HeldenGeschichte_ ii 11751181 didactic admonitory
to the military mind nay to the civic reader that has sympathy with
heroisms with work done manfully and terror and danger and difficulty
well trampled under foot Leonidas Wedell has an admirable silence too
and Ziethens lazily hanging underlip is in its old attitude again now
that the spasm is over WAS THUTS They are across without a doubt We
would have helped it and could not Steady




FRIEDRICHS RETREAT ESPECIALLY EINSIEDELS FROM PRAG

Seeing then that they are fairly over Friedrich with a creditable
veracity of mind sees also that the game is done and that same
night he begins manoeuvring towards Silesia lest far more be lost by
continuing the play One column under Leopold the Young Dessauer goes
through Glatz takes the Magazine of Pardubitz along with it good to go
in several columns the enemy will less know which to chase Friedrich
with another column will wait for Nassau about Konigsgratz then go by
the more westerly road through Nachod and the Pass of Braunau Nassau
who is to get across from Kolin and join us northwards has due
rendezvous appointed him in the Konigsgratz region Einsiedel in Prag
is to spike his guns since he cannot carry them blow up his
bastions and the like and get away with all discretion and all
diligencenorthwestward first to Leitmeritz where our magazines are
there to leave his heavier goods and make eastward towards Friedland
and across the Silesian Combs by what Passes he can Will have
a difficult operation but must stand to it And speed steady
simultaneous regular unresting velocity that is the word for all And
so it is donethough with difficulty on the part of poor Einsiedel
for one It was Thursday 19th November when the Austrians got across
the Elbe on Monday 23d the Prussian rendezvousings are completed and
Friedrichs column and the Glatz one under Leopold are both on march
infinite baggagewagons groaning orderly along sickwagons well
ahead and the like precautions and arrangements on both these
highways for Silesia and before the week ends Thursday 26th even
Einsiedel is under way Let us give something of poor Einsiedel
whose disasters made considerable noise in the world that Winter and
afterwards

The two main columns were not much molested that which went by Glatz
under Leopold was not pursued at all On the rear of Friedrichs own
column going towards Braunau all the way to Nachod or beyond there
hung the usual doggery of Pandours which required whipping off from
time to time but in the defiles and difficult places due precaution was
taken and they did little real damage Truchsess von Waldburg our old
friend of the Spartan feat near Austerlitz in the MORAVIANFORAY time
whom we have known in London society as Prussian Envoy in bygone years
was in one of the divisions of this column and one day at a village
where there was a little river to cross river Mietau Konigsgratz
branch of the Elbe got provoked injudiciously into fighting with
a body of these people Intent not on whipping them merely but on
whipping them to death Truchsess had already lost some forty men and
the business with such crowds of them was getting hot when all at
once a loud squeaking of pigs was heard in the villageapprehensive
swineherd hastily penning his pigs belike and some pig refractoryat
sound of which the Pandour multitude suddenly pauses quits fighting
and struck by a new enthusiasm rushes wholly into the village leaving
Truchsess in a tragicomic humor victorious but half ashamed
of himself  _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii 73 In the beginning of
December Friedrichs column reached home by Braunau through the
Mountains the same way part of it had come in August not quite so
brilliant in equipment now as then

It was upon Einsiedels poor Garrison leaving Prag in such haste that
the real stress of the retreat fell its difficulties great indeed and
its losses great Einsiedel did what was possible but all things are
not possible on a weeks warning He spiked great guns shook endless
hundredweights of powder and 10000 stand of arms into the River
he requisitioned horses oxen without number put mines under the
bastions almost none of which went off with effect He kept Prag
accurately shut the Praguers accurately in the dark took his measures
prudently and labored night and day One measure I note of him
stringent Proclamation to the inhabitants of Prag Provision yourselves
for three months nothing but starvation ahead otherwise Alas we
are to stand a fourth siege then say the Praguers But where are
provisions to be had At such and such places from the Royal Magazines
only if you bring a certificate and ready money Whereby Einsiedel
got delivered of his mealmagazine for one thing But his difficulties
otherwise were immense

On the Thursday morning 26th November 1744 he marched His wagons
had begun the night before and went all night rumbling continuous

burning Nessusshirt wriggled off and tramps successfully forth with
its baggages About 11 AM this rearguard of Brandess did should
have been at sevenright well that it could be at all

Einsiedel after this got tolerably well to Leitmeritz left his heavy
baggage there then turned at an acute angle right eastward towards the
Silesian Combs as ordered still a good seventy miles to do and the
weather getting snowy and the days towards their shortest Worse still
old Weissenfels now in Prag with his Saxons is aware that Einsiedel
before ending will touch on a wild highlying corner of the Lausitz
which is Saxon Country and thitherward Weissenfels has despatched
Chevalier de Saxe in plenty of time November 29th with horse and
foot to waylay Einsiedel and block the entrance of the Silesian
Mountains for him Whereupon in the latter end of his long march
and almost within sight of home ensues the hardest brush of all for
Einsiedel And in the desolation of that rugged Hill country of the
Lausitz HOCHWALD Upper Weld twenty or more miles from Bohemian
Friedland from his entrance on the Mountain Barrier and Silesian Combs
there are sceneswhich gave rise to a CourtMartial before long
For unexpectedly on the winter afternoon December 9th Einsiedel
struggling among the snows and pathless Hills comes upon Chevalier de
Saxe and his Saxon Detachmentintrenched with trees snowredoubts
and a hollow bog dividing us plainly unassailableand stands there
without covering without food fire or salt says one Eyewitness
for the space of fourteen hours Gazing gloomily into it exchanging a
few shots uncertain what more to do the muchdubitating Einsiedel At
which the men were so disgusted and enraged they deserted the foreign
part of them I fancy in groups at a time says the above
Eyewitness Not to think what became of the equipments baggagewagons
sickwagonstoo evident Einsiedels loss in all kinds was very
considerable Nassau despatched by Leopold out of Glatz from the other
side of the Combs is marching to help Einsiedelwho knows at this
moment where or whitherward For the peasants are all against us
our very guides desert and become spies Push to the left over the
Hochwald top must not we thinks Einsiedel that is Lausitz a Saxon
Country and Saxony though the Saxons stand intrenched here with the
knife at our throat are not at war with us oh no only allies of her
Majesty of Hungary and neutral otherwise And here it is too clear
the Chevalier de Saxe stands intrenched behind his trees and snow and
it is the fourteenth hour men deserting by the hundred without fire
and without salt and Nassau is comingGod knows by what road

Einsiedel pushes to the left the Hochwald way finds in the Hochwald
too a Saxon Commandant waiting him with arms strictly shouldered
And we cannot pass through this moor skirt of Lausitz say you then
Unarmed yes your muskets can come in wagons after you replies the
Saxon Commandant of Lausitz Thousand thanks Herr Commandant but we
will not give you all that trouble answer Einsiedel and his Prussians
and march on overwhelming him with politenesses says Friedrichthe
approach of Nassau above all being a stringent civility Of course
despatch is very requisite to Einsiedel the Chevalier with his force
being still within hail The Prussians march all night with pitchlinks
flaringnights I think of the 13th15th December 1744 up among the
highlands there rugged buttresses of the Silesian Combs a sight enough
to astonish Rubezahl if he happened to be out As good chance would
have it Nassau and Einsiedel by preconcert partly by lucky guess of
their own were hurrying by the same road three heavenrending cheers
December 16th when we get sight of Nassau and find that here is land

These were intricate strange scenes much talked of at the time
Rothenburg ugly Walrave Hacke and other known figures concerned in
them Scenes in which Friedrich is not well informed who much blames
Einsiedel as he is apt to do the unsuccessful Accounts exist both
from the Prussian and from the Saxon side decipherable with industry
not now worth deciphering to English readers Only that final scene
of the pitchlinks the night before meeting with Nassau dwells
voluntarily in ones memory And is the farewell of Einsiedel withal
Friedrich blames him to the last though a CourtMartial had sat on his
case some months after and honorably acquitted him Good solid silent
Einsiedeland in some months more he went to a still higher court
got still stricter justice I do not hear expressly that it was the
winter marches or strain of mind but he died in 1745 and that
flare of pitchlinks in Rubezahls country is the last scene of him
to usand the end of Friedrichs unfortunate First Expedition in the
Second Silesian War

Foiled ultimately then on every point a totally illordered game on
our part Evidently we for our part have been altogether in the wrong
in various essential particulars Amendment that and no other is the
word now Let us take the scathe and the scorn candidly home to usand
try to prepare for doing better The world will crow over us Well the
world knows little about it the world if it did know would be partly
in the rightWise is he who when beaten learns the reasons of it
and alters these This wisdom it must be owned is Friedrichs and
much distinguishes him among generals and men Veracity of mind as
I say loyal eyesight superior to sophistries noble incapacity of
selfdelusion the root of all good qualities in man His epilogue to
this Campaign is remarkabletoo long for quoting here except the
first word of it and the last

No General committed more faults than did the King in this Campaign
The conduct of M de Traun is a model of perfection which every soldier
that loves his business ought to study and try to imitate if he have
the talent The king has himself admitted that he regarded this Campaign
as his school in the Art of War and M de Traun as his teacher But
what shall we say Bad is often better for Princes than goodand
instead of intoxicating them with presumption renders them circumspect
and modest _OEuvres_ iii76 77 Let us still hope




Chapter VFRIEDRICH UNDER DIFFICULTIES PREPARES FOR A NEW CAMPAIGN

To the Court of Vienna especially to the Hungarian Majesty this
wonderful reconquest of Bohemia without battle foughtor any cause
assignable but Trauns excellent manoeuvring and Friedrichs imprudences
and trust in the Frenchwas a thing of heavenly miracle blessed omen
that Providence had vouchsafed to her prayers the recovery of Silesia
itself All the world was crowing over Friedrich but her Majesty of
Hungarys views had risen to a clearly higher pitch of exultation
and triumphant hope terrestrial and celestial than any other living
persons Silesia back again that was now the hope and resolution of
her Majestys high heart My wicked neighbor shall be driven out and
smart dear for the ill he has done Heaven so wills it Very little
uplifts the Austrians says Valori which is true under such a Queen
and yet there is nothing that can crush them altogether down adds he

No sooner is Bohemia cleared of Friedrich than Maria winter as it is
orders that there be through the GiantMountains vigorous assault upon
Silesia Highland snows and ices what are these to Pandour people
who at their first entrance on the scene of History crossed the
PalusMaeotis itself Father of Quagmires so to speak in a frozen
state and were sufficiently accommodated each in his own dirty
sheepskin Prosecute the King of Prussia ordered she take your
winterquarters in Silesiaand Traun in spite of the advanced
season and prior labors and hardships had to try from the
southwestern Bohemian side what he could do while a new Insurrection
coming through the Jablunka spread itself over the southeast and east
Seriously invasive multitudes which were an unpleasant surprise to
Friedrich and did as we shall see require to be smitten back again
and resmitten making a very troublesome winter to the Prussians and
themselves but by no means getting winterquarters as they once hoped

In a like sense Maria Theresa had already December 2d sent forth
her Manifesto or Patent solemnly apprising her everfaithful Silesian
Populations That the Treaty of Breslau not by her fault is broken
palpably a Treaty no longer That they accordingly are absolved
from all oaths and allegiance to the King of Prussia and shall hold
themselves in readiness to swear anew to her Majesty which will be
a great comfort to such faithful creatures suffering as her Majesty
explains to them that they have done under Prussian tyranny for these
two years past Immediate deadlift effort there shall be that is
certain and the Almighty God assisting who does not leave such
injustices unpunished We have the fixed Christian hope Omnipotence
blessing our arms of almost immediately EHESTENS delivering you from
this temporary Bondage BISHERIGEN JOCH You can pray in the mean
while for the success of her Majestys arms good fighting aided by
prayer in a Cause clearly Heavens will now to appearance bring
matters swiftly round again to the astonishment and confusion of
bad men In _HeldenGeschichte_ ii 11941198 Ib 12011206 is
Friedrichs Answer 19th December 1744

These are her Majestys views intensely true I doubt not to her
devout heart Robinson and the English seem not to be enthusiastic in
that direction as indeed how can they They would fain be tender of
Silesia which they have guaranteed fain now and afterwards restrain
her Majesty from driving at such a pace down hill but the declivity is
so encouraging her Majesty is not to be restrained and goes faster
and faster for the time being And indeed under less devout forms the
general impression among Pragmatic people Saxon Austrian British
even was That Friedrich had pretty much ruined himself and deserved
to do so that this of his being mere Auxiliary to a Kaiser in
distress was an untenable pretext now justly fallen bankrupt upon him
The evident fact That he had by his Frankfurt Union and struggles
about union reopened the door for French tribulations and
roughridings in the Reich was universally distasteful all chance of
a general union of German Princes in aid of their Kaiser was extinct
for the present

Friedrichs rapidity had served him ill with the Public in this as
in some other instances Friedrich contemplating his situation not
selfdelusively but with the candor of real remorse was by no means
yet aware how very bad it was For six months coming partly as existing
facts better disclosed themselves as France Saxony and others showed
what spirit they were of partly as new sinister events and facts
arrived one after the otherhis outlook continued to darken and
darken till it had become very dark indeed There is perennially the
great comfort immense if you can manage it of making front against
misfortune of looking it frankly in the face and doing with a
resolution hour by hour your own utmost against it Friedrich never
lacked that comfort and was not heard complaining But from December
13th 1744 when he hastened home to Berlin under such aspects till
June 4th 1745 when aspects suddenly changed are probably the worst
six months Friedrich had yet had in the world During which his affairs
all threatening to break down about him he himself behooving to stand
firm if the worst was not to realize itself had to draw largely on
what silent courage or private inexpugnability of mind was in hima
larger instalment of that royal quality as I compute than the Fates
had ever hitherto demanded of him Ever hitherto though perhaps nothing
like the largest of all which they had upon their Books for him at a
farther stage As will be seen For he was greatly drawn upon in that
way in his time And he paid always no man in his Century so well few
men in any Century better As perhaps readers may be led to guess or
acknowledge on surveying and considering To see and sympathetically
recognize cannot be expected of modern readers in the present great
distance and changed conditions of men and things

Friedrich after despatching Nassau to cut out Einsiedel had delivered
the Silesian Army to the Old Dessauer who is to command in chief during
Winter and had then hastened to Berlinmany things there urgently
requiring his presence preparations reparations not to speak of
diplomacies and what was the heaviest item of all new finance for the
coming exertions In Schweidnitz on Leopolds appearance there had
been an interview due consultings orderings which done Friedrich at
once took the road and was at Berlin Monday December 14thprecisely
in the time while Nassau and Einsiedel were marching with torchlights in
Rubezahls Country and near ending their difficult enterprise better or
worse

Friedrich fastening eagerly on Home business is astonished and
provoked to learn that the Austrians not content with pushing him
out of Bohmen are themselves pushing into Schlesienso Old Leopold
reports with increasing emphasis day by day to whom Friedrich sends
impatient order Hurl them out again gather what force you need ten
thousand or were it twenty or thirty thousand and be immediate about
it I will as soon be pitched HERAUSGESCHMISSEN out of the Mark of
Brandenburg as out of Schlesien no delay I tell you And as the Old
Dessauer still explains that the ten or fifteen thousand he needs are
actually assembling and cannot be got on march quite in a moment
Friedrich dashes away his incipient Berlin Operations will go himself
and do it Haggle no more you tedious Old Dessauer

BERLIN 19th DECEMBER 1744 On the 21st Monday one week after
my arriving I leave Berlin and mean to be at Neisse on the 24th at
latest Your Serenity will in the interim make out the OrderofBattle
which is also OrderofMarch for what regiments are come in For I
will on the 25th without delay cross the Neisse and attack those
people cost what it mayto chase them out of Schlesien and Glatz and
follow them so far as possible Your Serenity will therefore take your
measures and provide everything so far as in this short time you can
that the project may be executable the moment I arrive Friedrich to
the Old Dessauer _Orlich_ ii 356

And rushed off accordingly in a somewhat flamy humor but at
Schweidnitz where the Old Dessauer met him again became convinced that
the matter was weightier than he thought not one of Tolpatchery alone
but had Traun himself in it Upon which Friedrich candidly drew bridle
hastened back and with a loss of four days was at his Potsdam Affairs
again To which he stuck henceforth ardently and I think rather with
increase of gloom though without spurt of impatience farther for three
months to come Before his returnnay had he known it was the
night before he went awaya strange little thing had happened in the
opposite or Western parts surprising accident to Marechal de Belleisle
which now lies waiting his immediate consideration But let us finish
Silesia first




OLD DESSAUER REPELS THE SILESIAN INVASION Winter 174445

This Silesian Affair includes due inroad of Pandours or indeed
two inroads southwest and southeast and in the southwest or Traun
quarter regulars are the main element of it Traun 20000 strong PLUS
stormyenough Pandour ACCOMPANIMENT is by this time through into Glatz
in three columnsis master of all Glatz except the RockFortress
itself and has spread himself right and left along the Neisse River
and from the southwest northwards in a skilful and dangerous manner In
concert with whom far to the east are Pandour whirlwinds on their own
footing brandnew Insurrection of them got thus far starting from
Olmutz and Brunn scouring that eastern country as far as Namslau
northward a place we were at the taking of in old Brieg times much
more infesting the Mountains of the South A rather serious thing with
Traun for general manager of it

With Traun we say poor Prince Karl is off weeks ago on the saddest
of errands His beautiful young WifeHungarian Majestys one Sister
ViceRegents of the Netherlands he and she conspicuous among the bright
couples of the worldshe had a bad lyingin child stillborn while
those grand Moldau Operations went on has been ill poor lady ever
since and at Brussels on December 16th she herself lies dead Prince
Karl weeping over her and the days that will not return Prince Karls
felicities private and public had been at their zenith lately which
was very high indeed but go on declining from this day Never more the
Happiest of Husbands did not wed again at all still less the Greatest
of Captains equal or superior to Caesar in the Gazetteer judgment with
distracted EULOGIES BIOGRAPHIES and such like filling the air before
long a WarCaptain of quite moderate renown which we shall see
sink gradually into no renown at all and even unjustly into MINUS
quantities before all end A mad world my masters

Between Traun on the southwest hand and his Pandours on the southeast
the small Prussian posts have all been driven in upon TroppauJagerndorf
region more and more narrowed thereand in fine two days before
this new Interview of Leopold and the impatient King at Schweidnitz
have had to quit the TroppauJagerndorf position to quit the Hills
altogether and are now in full march towards Brieg Of which march I
should say nothing were it not that Marwitz Father of Wilhelminas
giggling Marmitzes commandedand came by his death in the course of
it though our Wilhelmina is not now there pen in hand to tell us
what the effects at Baireuth were Marwitz had been left for dead on
the Field of Mollwitz lay so all night but was nursed to some kind
of strength again by those giggling young women and came back to
Schlesien to posts of chief trust for the last year or twowas
guarding the Mountains and even invading Mahren during the late
Campaignbut saw himself reduced latterly to Jagerndorf and Troppau
and had even to retreat out of these And in the whirlpool of hurries
thereuponhow is not very clear by apoplexy say some by accidental
pistol from a servant of his own in actual skirmish with Pandourstoo
certainly one way or the other on December 23d just during that
second Interview at Schweidnitz brave old Marwitz did suddenly sink
dead and is ended _HeldenGeschichte_ ii 1201 Even so ye poor
giggling creatures and your loud weeping will not mend it at all

Friedrich looking candidly into these phenomena could not but see
that what with Tolpatcheries what with Trauns 20000 regulars and
the whole Army at their back his Silesian Border is girt in by a very
considerable inroad of Austrianshuge Chain of them in horseshoe
form 300 miles long pressing in from beyond Glatz and Landshut round
by the southern Mountains and up eastward again as far as Namslau
nothing but war whirlwinds in regular or irregular form in the centre
of them Traunand that the Old Dessauer really must have time to gird
himself for dealing with Traun and them

It was not till January 9th that Old Leopold 25000 strong equipped
to his mind which was a difficult matter crossed the Neisse River
and marched direct upon Traun with Ziethen charging ahead Actually
marched after which the main wrestle was done in a week January 16th
Old Leopold got to Jagerndorf found the actual Traun concentrated at
Jagerndorf and drew up to be ready for assault tomorrow morninghad
not Traun candidly computing judged it better to glide wholly away in
the nighttime diligently towards Mahren breaking the bridges behind
him And so in effect to give up the Silesian Invasion for this time
After which though there remained a good deal of rough tussling with
Pandour details and some rugged exploits of fight there isexcept
that of Lehwald in clearing of Glatznothing farther that we can afford
to speak of Lehwalds exploit Lehwald VERSUS Wallis same Wallis who
defended Glogau long since which came to be talked of and got name
and date Action of Habelschwert February 14th something almost like
a pitched fight on the small scale is to the following effect

PLOMNITZ NEAR HABELSCHWERT 14th FEBRUARY 1745 Old General Lehwald
marching in the hollow ground near Habelschwert hollow of the young
Neisse River twenty miles south of Glatz with intent to cut that
Country free the Enemy whom he is in search of appears in great
forceposted on the uphill ground ahead halffrozen difficult stream
in front of them cannon on flank Pandour multitude in woods all
things betokening inexpugnability on the part of the Enemy So that
Lehwald has to take his measures study well where the vital point is
the root of that extensive Austrian junglery and cut in upon the same
By considerable fire of effort the uphill ground halffrozen stream
sylvan Pandours cannonbatteries and what inexpugnabilities there may
be are subdued Austrian wide junglery the root of it slit asunder
rolls homeward simultaneously not too fast nay it halted and
reranked itself twice over finding woods and quaggy runlets to its
mind but was always slit out again disrooted and finally tumbled
home having had enough Wenzel Wallis Friedrich asserts with due
scorn was all this while in a Chapel praying ardently to St
Vitus or one knows not whom without effect till they shouted to him
Beaten Sir Off or you are lost upon which he sprang to saddle and
spurred with both heels PIQUA DES DEUX  _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii
79 80 That was the feat of Lehwald clearing the Glatz Country with
one good cut a skilful Captain now getting decidedly oldish close on
sixty whom we shall meet again a dozen years hence still in harness

The old Serene Highness himself face the color of gunpowder and
bluer in the winter frost went rushing far and wide in an open vehicle
which he called his cart pushing out detachments supervising
everything wheeling hither and thither as needful sweeping out the
Pandour world and keeping it out not much of fighting needed but a
great deal of marching murmurs Friedrich which in winter is as bad
and wears down the force of the battalions Of all which we give no
detail sufficient to fancy in this manner the Old Dessauer flapping
his wide military wings in the faces of the Pandour hordes with here
and there a hard twitch from beak or claws tolerably keeping down the
Pandour interest all Winter His sons Leopold and Dietrich were under
him occasionally beside him the Junior Leopold so worn down with
feverish gout he could hardly sit on horseback at all while old
Papa went tearing about in his cart at that rate _Unternehmung in
OberSchlesien unter dem Fursten Leopold von AnhaltDessau im Januar
und Februar_ 1745 Seyfarth _Beylage_ i 141152 Stenzel iv 232
c

There was on the 21st of February TEDEUM sung in the churches of
Berlin for the Deliverance of Silesia from Invasion Not that even
yet the Pandours would be quite quiet or allow Old Leopold to quit his
cart far from it And they returned in such increased and
tempestuous state as will again require mention with the earliest
Springprecursors to a second far more serious and deadly Invasion
of Silesia for which it hangs yet on the balance whether there will be
a TEDEUM or a MISERERE to sing

Hungarian Majesty disappointed of Silesiawhich it seems is not to
be had all at once EHESTENS in the form of miraclemakes amends
by a rush upon Seckendorf and Bavaria attacks Seckendorf furiously
Bathyani pressing up the Donau Valley with Browne on one hand and
Barenklau on the other in midwinter and makes a terrible hand of him
reducing his Reconquest of Bavaria to nothing again nay to less Of
which in due time




THE FRENCH FULLY INTEND TO BEHAVE BETTER NEXT SEASON TO FRIEDRICH AND
THEIR GERMAN ALLIESBUT ARE PREVENTED BY VARIOUS ACCIDENTS November
1744April 1745 AprilAugust 1745

It is not divine miracle Friedrich knows well that has lost him his
late Bohemian Conquests without battle fought it was rash choosing of
a plan inexecutable without French cooperationculpable blindness to
the chance that France would break its promises and not cooperate Had
your Majesty forgotten the JointStock Principle then His Majesty has
sorrowful cause to remember it from this time on a still larger scale

Reflections indignant or exculpatory on the conduct of the French in
this Business are useless to Friedrich and to us The performance on
their part has been nearly the worstthough their intentions
while the Austrian Dragon had them by the throat were doubtless
enthusiastically good But the big Austrian Dragon being jerked away
from Elsass by Friedrichs treading on his tail 500 miles off they
were charmed quite into new enthusiasm to be rid of said Dragon and
instead of chasing HIM according to bargain took to destroying his DEN
that he might be harmless thenceforth Freyburg is a captured Town to
the joy and glory of admiring France and Friedrichs Campaign has gone
the road we see The Freyburg Illuminations having burnt out
there might rise in the triumphant mind some thought of Friedrich
againperhaps almost of a remorseful nature Certain it is the French
intentions are now again magnanimous more so than ever coupled now
with some attempts at fulfilment too which obliges us to mention them
here They were still a matter of important hope to Friedrich hope
which did not quite go out till August coming Though alas it did then
go out in gusts of indignation on Friedrichs part And as the whole of
these magnanimous French intentions latter like former again came to
zero we are interested only in rendering them conceivable to readers
for Friedrichs sakewith the more brevity the better for everybody
Two grand French Attempts there were listen on the threshold a
little

 It is certain the French intend gloriously regardless of expense
They are dismantling Freyburg to render it harmless henceforth But
withal in answer to the poor Kaisers shrieks they have sent Segur
our old Linz friend with 12000 to assist Seckendorf the
bravest troops in the worldwho did bravely take one beating at
Pfaffenhofen as will be seen and go home again They have Coigny
guarding those fine Brisgau Conquests And are furthermore diplomatizing
diligently not to say truculently in the Rhine Countries bullying
poor little fat KurTrier lean KurKoln and others To join the
Frankfurt Union not one of whom would under menacethough it
is the clear duty of all ReichsPrinces with a Kaiser under
oppressionand have marched Maillebois directly after Freyburg into
the MiddleRhine Countries to Koln Country to Mainz Country and to
and fro in support of said compulsory diplomaciesbut without the
least effect

To the MiddleRhine Countries observe and under Maillebois then
under Conti little matter under whom only let readers recollect the
name of itfor it is the FIRST of the French Attempts to do something
of a jointstock nature something for self AND Allies instead of for
self only It caused great alarm in those months to Britannic George
and others and brought out poor Duc dAhremberg with portions no
English included of the poor Pragmatic Army to go marching about in
the winter slushes instead of resting in bed Adelung iv 276 420
December 1744June 1745and is indeed a very loud business in
the old Gazettes and books till August coming Business which almost
broke poor DAhrembergs heart he says till once I got out of
it was TURNED out in fact Business of Pragmatic Army under
DAhremberg VERSUS MiddleRhine Army under Maillebois under Conti
Business now wholly of Zero VERSUS Zero to usexcept for a few dates
and reflex glimmerings upon King Friedrich Result otherwiseWe shall
see the Result

Attempt SECOND was still more important to Friedrich being directed
upon the Kaiser and Bavaria Belleisle is to go thither and take survey
Belleisle thither first you may judge if the intention is sincere
Valori is quite eloquent upon it Directly after Freyburg says he
Sechelles that first of Commissaries was sent to Munchen Sechelles
cleared up the chaos of Accounts which King Louis then instantly
paid Your Imperial Majesty shall have Magazines also said Louis
regardless of expense and your Army with auxiliaries Segur and
25000 of them French shall be raised to 60000 Belleisle then came
We will have Ingolstadt the first thing in Spring Alas Belleisle
had his Accident in the Harz and all went aback from that time
Valori i 322329 Aback too indisputably allAnd Belleisles
Accident Patience readers

The truth is Attempt SECOND and chief broke down at once Bathyani
beating it to pieces as will be seenthe ruins of it painfully
reacting on Attempt FIRST which had the like fate some months
laterand there was no THIRD made And in fact from the date of that
latter downbreak August or end of July 1745 and quite especially
from September 13th by which time several irrevocable things had
happened which we shall hear of the French withdrew altogether out of
German entanglements and concentrated themselves upon the Netherlands
there to demolish his Britannic Majesty as the likelier enterprise
This was a course to which ever since the Exit of Broglio and the
Oriflamme they had been more and more tending and inclining Nothing
for us but loss on loss to be had in Germany and so they at last
frankly gave up that bad Country They fought well in the Netherlands
with great splendor of success under Saxe VERSUS Cumberland and
Company They did also some successful work in Italyand left
Friedrich to bear the brunt in Germany too glad if he or another
were there to take Germany off their hand Friedrichs feelings on his
arriving at this consummation and during his gradual advance towards
it which was pretty steady all along from those first drenchedhen
POULES MOUILLEES procedures were amply known to Excellency Valori
and may be conceived by readerswho are slightly interested in the
dates of them at farthest And now for the Belleisle Accident with
these faint preliminary lights




STRANGE ACCIDENT TO MARECHAL DE BELLEISLE IN THE HARZ MOUNTAINS 20th
December 1744

Siege of Freyburg being completed and the River and most other things
except always the bastions which we blow up being let into their old
channels there Marechal de Belleisle who is to have a chief management
henceforththe Most Christian King recognizing him again as his ablest
man in war or peacesets forth on a long tour of supervision of
diplomacy and general arrangement to prepare matters for the next
Campaign Need enough of a Belleisle what a business we have made of
it since Friedrich trod on the serpents tail for us Nothing but
our own Freyburg to show for ourselves elsewhere mere downrush of
everything whitherward it likedand King Friedrich got into such a
humor Friedrich must be put in tune again something real and good to
be agreed on at Berlin let that be the last thing crown of the whole
The first thing is look into Bavaria a little and how the Kaiser
poor gentleman in want of all requisites but goodwill can be put into
something of fighting posture

In the end of November Marechal Duc de Belleisle with his Brother the
Chevalier now properly the Count there having been promotions and
a great retinue more alights at Munchen holds counsel with the poor
Kaiser for certain daysMoney wanted many things wanted and all
things we need not doubt much fallen out of square Those Seckendorf
troops in their winterquarters say our French Inspectors and Segur
people as usual do but look on it your Excellency Scattered along
the valleys into the very edge of Austria Austria will swallow them
the first thing next year they will never rendezvous again except in
the Austrian prisons Surely Monseigneur only a man ignorant of war
or with treasonous intention or illoff for victualscould post
troops in that way Seckendorf is not ignorant of war say they
Valori i 206 For in fact suspicion runs high and there is no end
to the accusations just and unjust and Seckendorf is as ill treated as
any of us could wish Poor old soul Probably nobody in all the Earth
but his old Wife in the Schloss of Altenburg has any pity for himif
even she which I hope He has fought and diplomatized and intrigued
in many countries very much and in his old days is hard bested
Monseigueur whose part is rather that of Jove the Cloudcompeller
is studious to be himself noiseless amid this noise and makes no
alteration in the Seckendorf troops but it is certain he meant to do
it thinks Valori

And indeed Seckendorf tired of the Bavarian bedofroses had privately
fixed with himself to quit the sameand does so inexorable to the
very Kaiser on NewYear arriving _Seckendorfs Leben_ p 365
Succeeded by Thorring our old friend DRUM Thorring if that be an
improvement Marechal de Belleisle has still a long journey ahead
and infinitely harder problems than theseassuagement of the King of
Prussia for example Let us follow his remarkable steps

WEDNESDAY 9th DECEMBER 1744 the Marechal leaves Munchen
northwards through OEttingen and the BambergAnspach regions towards
Casseljourney of some three hundred and fifty miles with a great
retinue of his own with an escort of two hundred horse from the Kaiser
these latter to prevent any outfall or insult in the Ingolstadt quarter
where the Austrians have a garrison not at all very tightly blocked by
the Seckendorf people thereabouts No insult or outfall occurring the
Marechal dismisses his escort at OEttingen fares forward in his twenty
coaches and fourgons some score or so of vehiclesmere neutral
Imperial Countries henceforth where the Kaisers Agent as Marechal
de Belleisle can style himself and Titular Prince of the German Empire
withal has only to pay his way By Donauworth by OEttingen over
the Donau acclivities then down the pleasant Valley of the Mayn See

SUNDAY 13th DECEMBER Marechal de Belleisle arrives at Hanau where
we have seen Conferences held before now and Carteret Prince Karl and
great George our King very busy there to confer with Marshals Coigny
Maillebois and other high men Commanders in those Rhine parts Who
all come accordingly except Marechal Maillebois who is sorry that he
absolutely cannot but will surely do himself the honor as Monseigneur
returns As Monseigneur returns And so on Monday 14th Monseigneur
starts for Cassel say a hundred miles right north where we shall meet
Prince Wilhelm of HessenCassel a zealous Ally inform him how his
Troops under Seckendorf are posted at Vilshofen yonder hiding how
perilous their post is or promising alterations perhaps rest a day or
two consulting as to the common weal How the King of Prussia takes
our treatment of him How to smooth the King of Prussia and turn him
to harmony again We are approaching the true nodus of our business
difficulty of difficulties and Wilhelm the wise Landgraf may afford
a hint or two Thus travels magnanimous Belleisle in twenty vehicles a
man loaded with weighty matters in these deep Winter months suffering
dreadfully from rheumatic neuralgic ailments a Doctor one of his
needfulest equipments and has the hardest problem yet ahead of him

Prince Wilhelms consultations are happily lost altogether buried from
sight forever to the last hintall except as to what road to Berlin
would be the best from Cassel By Leipzig through lowlying country is
the great Highway advisable in winter but it runs a hundred and thirty
miles to right before ever starting northward such a roundabout Not
to say that the Saxons are allies of Austriaif there be anything in
that Enemies they to the Most Christian King though surely again
we are on Kaisers business nay we are titular Prince of the Reich
for that matter such the Kaisers grace to us Well it is better
perhaps to AVOID the Saxon Territory And of course the Hanoverian
much more through which lies the other Great Road Go by the Harz
advises Landgraf Wilhelm a rugged Hill Country but it is your
hypotenuse towards Berlin passes at once or nearly so from Cassel
Territory into Prussian a rugged road but a shorter and safer That
is the road Belleisle resolves upon Twenty carriages his Brother the
Chevalier and himself occupy one and always the courier rides before
ordering forty posthorses to be ready harnessed

SUNDAY 20th DECEMBER 1744 In this way they have climbed the eastern
shin of the Harz Range where the Harz is capable of wheelcarriages
and hope now to descend this night to Halberstadt and thence rapidly
by level roads to Berlin It is sinking towards dark the courier is
forward to Elbingerode ordering forty horses to be out Roughish
uphill road winter in the sky and earth winter vapors and tumbling
windgusts westward in torn stormcloak the Bracken with its
witchdances highland Goslar and ghost of Henry the Fowler on the
other side of it A multifarious wizard Country much overhung by goblin
reminiscences witchdances sorcererssabbaths and the likeif a
rheumatic gentleman cared to look on it in the cold twilight Brrh
Waste chasmy uplands snowchoked torrents wild people gloomy firs
Here at last by ones watch 5 PM is Elbingerode uncomfortable
little Town and it is to be hoped the forty posthorses are ready

Behold while the forty posthorses are getting ready a thing takes
place most unexpectedwhich made the name of Elbingerode famous for
eight months to come Of which let us hastily give the bare facts
Fancy making of them what she can Was Monseigneur aware that this
Elbingerode with a patch of territory round it is Hanoverian ground
one of those distracted patches or ragged outskirts frequent in the
German map Prussia is not yet and HessenCassel has ceased to be
Undoubtedly Hanoverian Apparently the Landgraf and Monseigneur had not
thought of that But Munchhausen of Hanover spies informing him
had The Bailiff Vogt AdVOCATus has gathered twenty JAGER official
Gamekeepers with their guns and a select idle Sunday population of
the place with or without guns the Vogt steps forward and inquires for
Monseigneurs passport No passport no need of anyPardon and
signifies to Monseigneur on the part of George Elector of Hanover King
of Great Britain France and Ireland that Monseigneur is arrested

Monseigneur with compressed or incompressible feelings indignantly
complieswhat could he else unfortunate rheumatic gentlemanand is
plucked away in such sudden manner he for one out of that big German
game of his raising The twenty vehicles are dragged different roads
towards Scharzfels Osterode or I know not wherehandiest roads to
Hanoverand Monseigneur himself has travelling treatment which might
be complained of did not one disdain complaint my Brother parted from
me nay my Doctor and my Interpreternot even speech possible to
me Letter of Belleisle next morning Neuhof 21st December 9 AM
in _Valori_ i 204 to Munchhausen at Hanoverby no possibility
to Valori as the distracted French Editor has given it That was the
Belleisle Accident in the Harz Sunday Evening 20th December 1744

Afflicted indignant Valori soon enough apprised runs to Friedrich
with the newsgreets Friedrich with it just alighting from that
Silesian run of his own Friedrich not without several other things to
think of is naturally sorry at such news sorry for his own sake even
but not overmuch Friedrich refuses to despatch a party of horse and
cut out Marechal de Belleisle That will never do MON CHERand even
gets into FROIDES PLAISANTERIES Perhaps the Marechal did it
himself Tallard prisoner after Blenheim made PEACE you know in
Englandand the like which grieved the soul of Valori and convinced
him of Friedrichs inhumanity in a crying case

Belleisle is lugged on to Hanover his case not doubtful to
Munchhausen or the English Ministrythough it raised great argument
was the capture fair was it unfair Is he entitled to exchange by
cartel or not entitled and produced in the next eight months much
angry animated pamphleteering and negotiation For we hear by and by
he is to be forwarded to Stade on the Hamburg seacoast where English
Seventyfours are waiting for him his case still undecidedand
in effect it was not till after eight months that he got dismissal
Lodged handsomely in Windsor Palace in the interim free on his
parole people of rank very civil to him though the Gazetteers were
sometimes illtonguedhad he understood their PATOIS or concerned
himself about such things

TUESDAY 18th FEBRUARY 1st March 1745 Marshal Belleisle landed at
Harwich lay at Greenwich Palace having crossed Thames at the Isle of
Dogs next morning about 10 set out in a coachandsix Colonel
Douglas and two troops of horse escorting arrived 3 PMby
Camberwell Clapham Wandsworth over Kingston and Staines Bridgesat
Windsor Castle and the apartments ready for him _Gentlemans
Magazine_ 1745 p 107 Was let go 13th 24th August again with great
pomp and civilities ib p 442 See Adelung iv 299 346 v 83 84

It was a current notion among contemporary mankind this of Friedrich
that Belleisles capture might be a mere collusion meant to bring about
a Peace in that Tallard fashionwide of the truth as such a notion
is far as any Peace was from following To Britannic George and his
Hanoverians it had merely seemed Here was a chief WarCaptain and
Diplomatist among the French the pivot of all these worldwide
movements as Valori defines him which pivot a chance offering it
were well to twitch from its socket and see what would follow Perhaps
nothing will follow next to nothing A world all waltzing in mad war
is not to be stopped by acting on any pivot your waltzing world will
find new pivots or do without any and perhaps only waltz the more
madly for wanting the principal one

This withdrawal of Belleisle the one Frenchman respected by Friedrich
or much interested for his own sake in things German is reckoned a main
cause why the French Alliance turned out so ill for Friedrich and why
French effort took more and more a Netherlands direction thenceforth
and these new French magnanimities on Friedrichs behalf issued in
futility again Probably they never could have issued in very much but
it is certain that from this point they also do become zero and that
Friedrich from his French alliance reaped from first to last nothing
at all except a great deal of obloquy from German neighbors and from
the French side endless trouble anger and disappointment in every
particular Which might be a joy though not unmixed to Britannic
Majesty and the subtle followers who had ginned this fine Belleisle bird
in its flight over the Harz Range Though again had they passively let
him wing his way and he had GOT to be Commander and Manager as was
in agitationhe Belleisle and in Germany instead of Marechal de Saxe
with the Netherlands as chief scenewhat an advantage might that have
been to them




THE KAISER KARL VII GETS SECURED FROM OPPRESSIONS IN A TRAGIC WAY
FRIEDRICH PROPOSES PEACE BUT TO NO PURPOSE

A still sadder cross for Friedrich in the current of foreign Accidents
and Diplomacies was the next that befell exactly a month laterat
Munchen 20th January 1745 Hardly was Belleisles back turned when
her Hungarian Majesty by her Bathyani and Company broke furiously in
upon the poor Kaiser and his SeckendorfSegur defences Belleisle had
not reached the Harz when all was going topsyturvy there again and
the DonauValley fast falling back into Austrian hands Nor is that the
worst or nearly so

MUNCHEN 20th JANUARY 1745 This day poor Kaiser Karl laid down his
earthly burden here and at length gave all his enemies the slip He
had been ill of gout for some time a man of much malady always with no
want of vexations and apprehensions Too likely the Austrians will drive
him out of Munchen again then nothing but furnished lodgings and the
French to depend upon He had been much chagrined by some Election
just done in the Chapter of Salzburg Adelung iv 249 276 313
The Archbishop thereit was Firmian he of the SALZBURG EMIGRATION
memorable to readershad died some while ago And now in flat
contradiction to Imperial customs prerogatives these people had
admitted an Austrian Garrison and then in the teeth of our express
precept had elected an Austrian to their benefice what can one account
it but an insult as well as an injury And the neuralgic maladies press
sore and the gouty twinges and Belleisle is seized perhaps with
important papers of ours and the SeckendorfSegur detachments were ill
placed nay here are the Austrians already on the throat of them in
midwinter It is said a babbling valet or lordinwaiting happened to
talk of some skirmish that had fallen out called a battle in the valet
rumor and how ill the French and Bavarians had fared in it owing to
their ill behavior And this add they proved to be the ounceweight
too much for the so heavyladen back

The Kaiser took to bed not much complaining patient mild though
the saddest of all mortals and in a day or two died Adieu adieu
ye loved faithful ones pity me and pray for me He gave his Wife poor
little fat devout creature and his poor Children eldest lad his Heir
only seventeen a tender blessing solemnly exhorted them To eschew
ambition and be warned by his exampleto make their peace with
Austria and never like him try COM E DURO CALLE and what the
charity of Christian Kings amounts to This counsel it is thought the
Empress Dowager zealously accedes to and will impress upon her Son
That is the Austrian and CauseofLiberty account King Friedrich from
the other side has heard a directly opposite one How the Kaiser at
the point of death exhorted his son Never forget the services which
the King of France and the King of Prussia have done us and do not
repay them with ingratitude  _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii 92and see
PER CONTRA in Adelung iv 314 A in Coxe c The reader can choose
which he will or reject both into the region of the uncertain Karl
Alberts pious and affectionate demeanor drew tears from all eyes say
the bystanders the manner in which he took leave of his Empress would
have melted a heart of stone He was in his fortyeighth year he had
been of all men in his generation the most conspicuously unhappy

What a downrush of confusion there ensued on this event not to Bavaria
alone but to all the world and to King Friedrich more than another
no reader can now take the pains of conceiving The Frankfurt Union
then has gone to air Here is now no Kaiser to be delivered from
oppression here is a new Kaiser to be electedGrandDuke Franz the
man cry the Pragmatic Potentates with exultation no Belleisle to
disturband questions arise innumerable thereupon Will France go
into electioneering again The new KurBaiern only seventeen poor
child cannot be set up as candidate What will France do with HIM
what he with France Whom can the French try as Candidate against the
GrandDuke KurSachsen the Polish Majesty again Belleisle himself
must have paused uncertain over such a welterand probably have done
like the others little or nothing in it but left it to collapse by
natural gravitation

Hungarian Majesty checked her Bavarian Armaments a little If perhaps
this young KurBaiern will detach himself from France and on submissive
terms come over to us Whereupon at Munchen and in the cognate
quarters such wriggling dubitating and diplomatizing as seldom
wasFrench AntiFrench Seckendorf busiest of all straining every
nerve in that way and for almost three months nothing coming of
ittill Hungarian Majesty sent her Barenklaus and Bathyanis upon them
again and these rapidly solved the question in what way we shall see

Friedrich has still his hopes of Bavaria so grandiloquent are the
French in regard to it who but would hope The French diplomatize to
all lengths in Munchen promising seas and mountains but they perform
little in an effectual manner nothing Bavarian Army raised to
60000 counts in fact little above half that number with no General
to it but an imaginary one Segurs actual French contingent instead
of 25000 is perhaps 12000and so of other things Add to all which
Seckendorf is there not now as WarGeneral but as extraofficial
Adviser busier than everscandalous old traitor say the
Frenchand Friedrich may justly fear that Bavaria will go by
collapse a bad road for him

Friedrich a week or two after the Kaisers death seeing Bavarian and
French things in such a hypothetic state instructs his Ambassador
at London to declare his Friedrichs perfect readiness and wish for
Peace Old Treaty of Breslau and Berlin made indubitable to me the
rest of the quarrel has by decease of the Kaiser gone to air
To which the Britannic Majesty rather elated at this time as all
Pragmatic people are answers somewhat in a careless way Well if
the others like it and promises that he will propose it in the proper
quarter So that henceforth there is always a hope of Peace through
England as well as contrariwise especially till Bavaria settle itself
in April next a hope of great assistance from the French Here are
potentialities and counterpotentialities which make the Bavarian
Intricacy very agitating to the young King while it lasts And indeed
his world is one huge imbroglio of Potentialities and Diplomatic
Intricacies agitating to behold Concerning which we have again to
remark how these huge Spectres of Diplomacy now filling Friedrichs
world came mostly in result to Nothingshaping themselves wholly
for or against in exact proportion direct or inverse to the actual
Quantity of Battle and effective Performance that happened to be found
in Friedrich himself Diplomatic Spectralities wide Fatamorganas of
hope and hideous big Bugbears blotting out the sun of these few
men ever had more than Friedrich at this time And he is careful none
carefuler not to neglect his Diplomacies at any timethough he
knows better than most that good fighting of his own is what alone
can determine the value of these contingent and aerial quantitiesmere
Lapland witchcraft the greater part of them

A second grand Intricacy and difficulty still more enigmatic and
pressing the tighter by its close neighborhood was that with the
Saxons Are the Saxons enemies are they friends Neutrals at lowest
bound by Treaty to lend Austria troops but to lend for defence merely
not for offence Could not one by good methods make friends with his
Polish Majesty Friedrich was far from suspecting the rages that lurked
in the Polish Majesty and least of all owing to what Owing to that old
MORAVIANFORAY business and to his Friedrichs behavior to the Saxons
in it excellent Saxons who had behaved so beautifully to Friedrich
That is the sad fact however Stupid Polish Majesty has his natural
envies jealousies of a Brandenburg waxing over his head at this rate
But it appears the Moravian Foray entered for a great deal into the
account and was the final overwhelming item Bruhl by much descanting
on that famous Expeditionwith such candid Eyewitnesses to appeal to
such corroborative Staffofficers and appliances powerful on the idle
heart and weak brain of a Polish Majestyhas brought it so far Fixed
indignation for intolerable usage especially in that MoravianForay
time fixed not very malignant but altogether obstinate as I am
told that of the pacific sheep species usually is which carried Bruhl
and his Polish Majesty to extraordinary heights and depths in years
coming But that will deserve a section to itself by and by

A third difficulty privately more stringent than any is that of
Finance The expenses of the late Bohemian Expedition Friedrichs
Army costing 75000 pounds a month have been excessive For our
next Campaign if it is to be done in the way essential there are by
rigorous arithmetic 900000 pounds needed A frugal Prussia raises
no new taxes pays its Wars from the Treasure from the Fund saved
beforehand for emergencies of that kind Fund which is running low
threatening to be at the lees if such drain on it continue To fight
with effect being the one sure hope and salve for all sores it is
not in the Army in the Fortresses the Fighting Equipments that there
shall be any flaw left Friedrichs budget is a sore problem upon him
needing endless shift and ingenuity now and onwards through this
waralready during these months in the Berlin Schloss a great deal
of those massive FriedrichWilhelm plate Sumptuosities especially
that unparalleled MusicBalcony up stairs all silver has been under
Fredersdorfs management quietly taken away carried over in the
nighttime to the Mint Orlich ii 126128

And in fact no modern reader not deeper in that distressing story
of the AustrianSuccession War than readers are again like to be can
imagine to himself the difficulties of Friedrich at this time as they
already lay disclosed and kept gradually disclosing themselves
for months coming nor will ever know what perspicacity patience
of scanning sharpness of discernment dexterity of management were
required at Friedrichs handsand under what imminency of peril too
victorious deliverance or ruin and annihilation wavering fearfully
in the balance for him more than once or rather all along But it
is certain the deeper one goes into that hideous Medeas Caldron of
stupidities once so flamy now fallen extinct the more is one
sensible of Friedrichs difficulties and of the talent for all kinds
of Captaincyby no means in the Field only or perhaps even
chieflythat was now required of him Candid readers shall accept
these hints and do their bestFriedrich himself made not the least
complaint of mens then misunderstanding him still less will he now
We keeping henceforth the Diplomacies the vaporous Foreshadows and
general Dance of Unclean Spirits with their intrigues and spectralities
well underground so far as possible will stick to what comes up as
practical Performance on Friedrichs part and try to give intelligible
account of that

Valori says he is greatly changed and for the better by these late
reverses of fortune All the world notices it says Valori No longer
that brief infallibility of manner that lofty light air that politely
disdainful view of Valori and mankind he has now need of men Complains
of nothing is cheerful quizzicalardently busy to grind out the
notches as our proverb is has a mild humane aspect something of
modesty almost of piety in him Help me thou Supreme Power Maker of
men if my purposes are manlike Though one does not go upon the Prayers
of FortyHours or apply through St Vitus and such channels there may
be something of authentic petition to Heaven in the thoughts of that
young man He is grown very amiable the handsomest young bit of Royalty
now going He must fight well next Summer or it will go hard with him




Chapter VIVALORI GOES ON AN ELECTIONEERING MISSION TO DRESDEN

Some time in January a new Frenchman a Chevalier de Courten if the
name is known to anybody was here at Berlin consulting settling about
mutual interests and operations Since Belleisle is snatched from us
it is necessary some Courten should come and produce what he has got
little of settlement I should fear of definite program that will
hold water in regard to War operations chiefly a magazine of clouds
Specimens of it in Ranke iii 219 For the rest the Bavarian
question and very specially Who the new Emperor is to beKing of
Poland thinks your MajestyBy all means answers Friedrich if
you can Detach him from Austria that will be well Which was reckoned
magnanimous at least publicspirited in Friedrich considering what
Saxonys behavior to him had already been By all means his Polish
Majesty for Kaiser do our utmost Excellencies Valori Courten and
Company answers Friedrichand for his own part I observe is
intensely busy upon Army matters looking after the main chance

And so Valori is to go to Dresden and manage this cloud or cobwebbery
department of the thing namely persuade his Polish Majesty to stand
for the Kaisership Baiern Pfalz Koln Brandenburg there are four
votes Sire your own is five sure of carrying it your Polish Majesty
backed by the Most Christian King and his Allies and resources And
Polish Majesty does for his own share very much desire to be Kaiser
But none of us yet knows how he is tied up by Austria AntiFriedrich
AntiFrench considerations and can only accept if it is offered me
thricewilling to accept if it will fall into my mouth which on those
terms it has so little chance of doingSaxony and its mysterious
affairs and intentions having been to Friedrich a riddle and trouble
and astonishment during all this Campaign readers ought to know the
fact welland no reader could stand the details of such a fact Here
in condensed form are some scraps of Excerpt which enable us to go
with Valori on this Dresden Mission and look for ourselves




1 FRIEDRICHS POSITION TOWARDS SAXONY

 By known Treaty the Polish Majesty is bound to assist the
Hungarian with 12000 men whenever invaded in her own dominions
Polish Majesty had 20000 in the field for that object latelypart
of them 8000 of them hired by Britannic subsidy as he alleges The
question now is Will Saxony assist Austria in invading Silesia with
or without Britannic subsidy Friedrich hopes that this is impossible
Friedrich is deeply unaware of the humor he has raised against himself
in the Saxon Courtcircles how the Polish Majesty regards that Moravian
Foray with what a perfect hatred little Bruhl regards him Friedrich
and to what pitch of humor owing to those MoravianForay starvings
marchings about and inhuman treatment of the poor Saxon Army not to
mention other offences and afflictive considerations Bruhl has raised
the simple Polish Majesty against Friedrich These things as they
gradually unfolded themselves to Friedrich were very surprising And
proved very disadvantageous at the present juncture and for a long time
afterwards To Friedrich disadvantageous and surprising and to Saxony
in the end ruinous poor Saxony having got its back broken by them and
never stood up in the world since Ruined by this wretched little Bruhl
and reduced from the first place in Northern Teutschland to a second
or third or no real place at all




2 THERE IS A UNION OF WARSAW 8th January 1745 AND STILL MORE
SPECIALLY A TREATY OF WARSAW 8th January18th May 1745

January 8th 1745 before the Old Dessauer got ranked in Schlesien
against Traun there had concluded itself at Warsaw by way of
counterpoise to the Frankfurt Union a Union of Warsaw called
also Quadruple Alliance of Warsaw the Parties to which were Polish
Majesty Hungarian ditto PrimeMovers and the two SeaPowers as
Purseholders stipulating to the effect We Four will hold together in
affairs of the Reich VERSUS that dangerous Frankfurt Union we willdo
a variety of salutary things and as one practical thing There shall
be this Season 30000 Saxons conjoined to the Austrian Force for
which we SeaPowers will furnish subsidyThis was the one practical
point stipulated January 8th and farther than this the SeaPowers did
not go now or afterwards in that affair

But there was then proposed by the Polish and Hungarian Majesties
in the form of Secret Articles an ulterior Project with which the
SeaPowers expressing mere disbelief and even abhorrence of it refused
to have any concern now or henceforth Polish Majesty in hopes it
would have been better taken had given his 30000 soldiers at a rate
of subsidy miraculously low only 150000 pounds for the whole but the
SeaPowers were inexorable perhaps almost repented of their 150000
pounds and would hear nothing farther of secret Articles and delirious
Projects

So that the Union of Warsaw had to retire to its pigeonhole content
with producing those 30000 Saxons for the immediate occasion and
there had to be concocted between the Polish and Hungarian Majesties
themselves what is now in the modern Pamphlets called a TREATY of
Warsawmuch different from the innocent UNION of Warsaw though it
is merely the specifying and fixing down of what had been shadowed
out as secret codicils in said Union when the SeaPower parties
obstinately recoiled Treaty of Warsaw let us continue to call it
though its actual birthplace was Leipzig in the profoundest secrecy
18th May 1745 above four months after it had tried to be born at
Warsaw and failed as aforesaid Warsaw Union is not worth speaking
of but this other is a Treaty highly remarkable to the readerand to
Friedrich was almost infinitely so when he came to get wind of it long
after

Treaty which though it proved abortional and never came to fulfilment
in any part of it is at this day one of the remarkablest bits of
sheepskin extant in the world It was signed 18th May 1745 Scholl
ii 350 and had cost a great deal of painful contriving capable still
of new altering and retouching to hit mutual views Treaty not only for
reconquering Silesia which to the Two Majesties though it did not
to the SeaPowers seems infallible in Friedrichs now ruined
circumstances but for cutting down that bad Neighbor to something like
the dimensions proper for a Brandenburg Vassalin fact quite the old
Detestable Project of Spring 1741 only more elaborated into detail
in which Britannic George knows better than to meddleSaxony to have
share of the parings when we get them What share asked Saxony and
long keeps asking A road to Warsaw Strip of Country carrying us from
the end of the Lausitz which is ours into Poland which we trust will
continue ours would be very handy Duchy of Glogau some small paring
of Silesia wont your Majesty Of my Silesia not one handbreadth
answered the Queen impatiently though she did at last concede
some outlying handbreadths famed old Circle of Schwiebus if I
recollect and they have had to think of other equivalent parings for
Saxonys behoof Magdeburg Halberstadt SaaleCircle or one knows
not what and have had and will have their adoes to get it fixed
Excellent bearskin to be slit into straps only the bear is still on his
feetPolish Majesty and Hungarian Polish with especial vigor Bruhl
quite restless upon it arelittle as Valori or any mortal could dream
of itengaged in this partition of the bearskin when Valori arrives
Of their innocent Union of Warsaw there was from the first no secret
made but the Document now called TREATY of Warsaw needs to lie secret
and thricesecret and it was not till 1756 that Friedrich having
unearthed it by industries of his own and studied it with great
intensity for some years made it known to the world Adelung v 308
397 Ranke iii 231 who for some reason of his own dates 3d May
instead of 18th

Treaties vaporous Foreshadows of Events have oftenest something of the
ghost in them and are importune to human nature longing for the Events
themselves all the more if they have proved abortional Treaties and
become doubly ghostlike or ghastly Nevertheless the reader is to
note well this Treaty of Warsaw as important to Friedrich and him and
indeed it is perhaps the remarkablest Treaty abortional or realized
which got to parchment in that Century For though it proved abortional
and no part of it now or afterwards could be executed and even the
subsidy and 30000 Saxons stipulated in the UNION of Warsaw became
crowsmeat in a mannerthis preternatural Treaty of Warsaw trodden
down never so much by the heel of Destiny and by the weight of
new Treaties superseding it or presupposing its impossibility or
inconceivability would by no means die such the humor of Bruhl of
the Two Majesties and others but lay alive under the ashes carefully
tended for Ten or Twenty Years to comeand had got all Europe kindled
again for destruction of that bad Neighbor before it would itself
consent to go out And did succeed in getting Saxonys back broken
if not the bad Neighborsin answer to the humor of little Bruhl
unfortunate Saxony to possess such a Bruhl

In those beautiful SaxonAustrian developments of the Treaty of
Warsaw Czarina Elizabeth bobbing about in that unlovely whirlpool of
intrigues amours devotions and strong liquor which her History is
took ask not for what reason a lively partand already in this
Spring of 1745 they hope she could by a gift of two millions for
her pleasures gift so easy to you SeaPowers be stirred up to anger
against Friedrich And she did in effect from this time hover about
in a manner questionable to Friedrich though not yet in anger but
only with the wish to be important and to make herself felt in Foreign
affairs Whether the SeaPowers gave her that trifle of pocketmoney
for her pleasures I never knew but it is certain they spent first
and last very large amounts that way upon her and hers especially the
English did with what result may be considered questionable

As for Graf von Bruhl most rising man of Saxony once a page now by
industry King August IIIs first favorite and factotum the fact that
he cordially hates Friedrich is too evident but the why is not known to
me Except indeed That no manespecially no man with three hundred
and sixtyfive fashionable suits of clothes usually about him different
suit each day of the yearcan be comfortable in the evident contempt of
another man Other man of sarcastic bantering turn too tongue sharp
as needles whose sayings many birds of the air are busy to carry about
Year after year Bruhl doubtless with help enough that way if there
had needed such hates him more and more as the too jovial Czarina
herself comes to do wounded by things that birds have carried And now
we will go with Valoriseeing better into some things than Valori yet
can




3 VALORIS ACCOUNT OF HIS MISSION in compressed form Valori i
211219

Valori I could guess about the 10th of February but there is no date
at all was despatched to Dresden with that fine project Polish Majesty
for Kaiser is authorized to offer 60000 men with money corresponding
and no end of brilliant outlooksmust keep back his offers however
if he find the people indisposed Which he did to an extreme degree
nothing but vague talk procrastination hesitation on the part of
Bruhl This wretched little Bruhl has twelve tailors always sewing for
him and three hundred and sixtyfive suits of clothes so many suits
all pictured in a Book a valet enters every morning proposes a suit
which after deliberation with perhaps amendments is acceded to and
worn at dinner Vainest of human clotheshorses foolishest coxcomb
Valori has seen it is visibly his notion that it was he Bruhl by his
Saxon auxiliaries by his masterly strokes of policy that checkmated
Friedrich and drove him from Bohemia last Year and for the rest that
Friedrich is ruined and will either shirk out of Silesia or be cut to
ribbons there by the Austrian force this Summer To which Valori hints
dissent but it is ill received Valori sees the King finds him as
expected the facsimile of Bruhl in this matter Jesuit Guarini the
like how otherwise They have his Majesty in their leash and lead him
as they please

At four every morning this Guarini Jesuit Confessor to the King and
Queen comes to Bruhl Bruhl settles with him what his Majesty shall
think in reference to current business this day Guarini then goes
confesses both Majesties confesses absolves turns in the due way
to secular matters At nine Bruhl himself arrives for Privy Council
What is your Majesty pleased to think on these points of current
business Majesty serenely issues his thoughts in the form of orders
which are found correct to pattern This is the process with his
Majesty A poor Majesty taking deeply into tobacco this is the way
they have him benetted as in a dark cocoon of cobwebs rendering the
whole world invisible to him Which cunning arrangement is more and more
perfected every year so that on all roads he travels be it to mass
to hunt to dinner anywhither in his Palace or out of it there are
faithful creatures keeping eye who admit no unsafe man to the least
glimpse of him by night or by day In this manner he goes on and before
the end of him twenty years hence has carried it far Nothing but
disgust to be had out of businessmutinous Polish Diets too some
forty of them in his time not one of which did any business at all
but ended in LIBERUM VETO and Billingsgate conflagration perhaps
with swords drawn See Buchholz 154 cbusiness more and more
disagreeable to him What can Valori expect on this heroic occasion
from such a King

The Queen herself Maria Theresas Cousin an ambitious hardfavored
Majestywho had sense once to dislike Bruhl but has been quite
reconciled to him by her Jesuit Messenger of Heaven which latter is an
oily rather stupid creature who really wishes well to her and loves
a peaceable life at any priceeven she will not take the bait Valori
was in Dresden nine days middle part of February it is likely never
produced his big bait his 60000 men and other brilliancies at all
He saw old Feldmarschall Konigseck passing from Vienna towards the
Netherlands Camp where he is to drynurse so they irreverently call
it in time coming his Royal Highness of Cumberland that magnificent
English Babe of War and do feats with him this Summer Konigseck
though Valori did not know it has endless diplomacies to do withal
inspections of troops advisings in Hanover in Holland in Dresden
here AnonymousDuke of Cumberlandp 186and secures the Saxon
ElectoralVote for his GrandDuke in passing The welcome given to
Konigseck disgusted Valori on the ninth day he left said adieu seeing
them blind to their interest and took post for Berlinwhere he finds
Friedrich much out of humor at the Saxon reception of his magnanimities

on Bruhl see _Graf von Bruhl Leben und Charakter_ 1760 No Place
Anonymous by one Justi a noted Pamphleteer of the time exists in
English too or partly exists but is unreadable except on compulsion

This Saxon intricacy indecipherable formidable contemptible was the
plague of Friedrichs life one considerable plague all through this
Campaign Perhaps nothing in the Diplomatic sphere of things caused
him such perplexity vexation indignation An insoluble riddle to
him extremely contemptible yetwith a huge Russia tacked to it and
looming minatory in the distancefrom time to time formidable enough
Let readers keep it in mind and try to imagine it It cost Friedrich
such guessing computing arranging rearranging as would weary the
toughest reader to hear of in detail How Friedrich did at last solve it
in December coming all readers will see with eyes




MIDDLERHINE ARMY IN A STAGGERING STATE THE BAVARIAN INTRICACY SETTLES
ITSELF THE WRONG WAY

Early in March it becomes surmisable that Mailleboiss MiddleRhine Army
will not go a good road Maillebois has been busy in those countries
working extensive discontent bullying mankind to join the Frankfurt
Union to join France at any rate which nobody would consent to and
exacting merciless contributions which everybody had to consent to and
payAnd now on DAhrembergs mere advance with that poor Fraction
of Pragmatic Army roused from its winter sleep Maillebois without
waiting for DAhrembergs attack rapidly calls in his truculent
detachments and rolls confusedly back into the Frankfurt regions
Adelung iv 276352 December 1744March 1745 Upon which
DAhrembergif by no means going upon Mailleboiss throatsets at
least to coercing Wilhelm of Hessen our only friend in those parts
who is already a good deal disgusted with the Maillebois procedures
and at a loss what to do on the Kaisers death which has killed the
Frankfurt Union too Wise Wilhelm consents under DAhrembergs menaces
to become Neutral and recall his 6000 out of Baiernwishes he had
them home beside him even now

With an Election in the wind it is doubly necessary for the French who
have not even a Candidate as yet to stand supreme and minatory in the
Frankfurt Country and to King Friedrich it is painfully questionable
whether Maillebois can do it Do it we will doubt not that your
Majesty answer Valori and the Frenchand study to make improvements
reinforcements in their Rhine Army And they do at least change the
General of their MiddleRhine Armythat is to say recall Prince Conti
out of Italy where he has distinguished himself and send Maillebois
thither in his steadwho likewise distinguishes himself THERE if that
could be a comfort to us Whether the distinguished Conti will maintain
that Frankfurt Country in spite of the Austrians and their Election
movements is still a question with Friedrich though Valori continued
assuring him always till July came that it was beyond question
Siege of Tournay vigorous Campaign in the Netherlands for behoof of
Britannic George this is the grand French program for the Year This
good intention was achieved on the French part but this like Aarons
rod among the serpents proved to have EATEN the others as it wriggled
along

Those MailleboisDAhremberg affairs throw a damp on the Bavarian
Question withalin fact settle the Bavarian Question her Hungarian
Majesty tired of the delays having ordered Bathyani to shoulder arms
again and bring a decision Bathyani with Barenklau to right of him
and Browne our old Silesian friend to left goes sweeping across those
SeckendorfSegur posts and without difficulty tumbles everything to
ruin at a grand rate The traitor Seckendorf had made such a choice of
postsleft unaltered by Drum Thorringwhat could French valor do
Nothing neither French valor nor Bavarian want of valor could
do anything but whirl to the rightabout at sight of the Austrian
SweepingApparatus and go off explosively as in former instances at
a rate almost unique in military annals Finished within three weeks or
soWe glance only at two points of it March 21st Bathyani stood to
arms to BESOMS we might call it Browne on the left Barenklau on the
right it was March 21st when Bathyani started from Passau up the Donau
Countriesand within the week coming see

VILSHOFEN 28th MARCH 1745 Here at the mouth of the Vils River
between Inn and Iser is the first considerable Post garrison some
4000 Hessians and Prince Friedrich the main partwho have their
share of valor I dare say but with such news out of Hessen not to
speak of the prospects in this Country are probably in poorish spirits
for acting General Browne summons them in Vilshofen this day and on
their negative storms in upon them bursts them to pieces upon which
they beat chamade But the Croats who are foremost care nothing for
chamade go plundering slaughtering burn the poor Town butcher in
round numbers 3000 of the poor Hessians and wound General Browne
himself while he too vehemently interferes Adelung iv 356 and the
halfintelligible Footnote in Ranke iii 220 This was the finale
of those 6000 Hessians and indeed their principal function while in
French payand must have been we can Judge how surprising to Prince
Friedrich and to his Papa on hearing of it Note another point

Precisely about this time twelvemonth March 16th 1746 the same
Prince Friedrich with remainder of those Hessians now again completed
to 6000 and come back with emphasis to the Britannic side of
things wasmarching out of Edinburgh in much state with streamers

but subtending a great angle there and thenmuch of unexpected and

troops those Hessians observes my orthodox Whig friend they carry
swords as well as guns and bayonets their uniform is blue turned up
with white the Hussar part of them about 500 have scimitars of
a great length small horses mostly black of Swedish breed swift
durable little creatures with long tails Honors dinners to his

auspicious morning IN was for affluence of Nobility and Gentry of both
sexes a sublime thing

PFAFFENHOFEN APRIL 15th Unfortunate Segur the Segur of Linz three
years agowhose conduct was great according to Valori but powerless
against traitors and fatewas again once more unfortunate in those
parts Unfortunate Segur drew up at Pfaffenhofen centre of the Country
many miles from Vilshofen to defend himself when fallen upon by
Barenklau in that manner but could not though with masterly demeanor
and had to retreat three days with his face to the enemy so to speak
fighting and manoeuvring all the way no shelter for him either but
Munchen and that a most temporary one Instead of taking Straubingen
taking Passau perhaps of pushing on to Vienna itself this is what
we have already come to No Rhine Army MiddleRhine Army Coigny
Maillebois Conti whoever it was should send us the least
reinforcement when shrieked to No outlook whatever but rapid
withdrawal retreat to the Rhine Army since it will not stir to help
us Adelung iv 360

The young KurBaiern is still polite grateful to us French
overwhelms us with politeness but flies to Augsburg as his Father used
to do Notable however his poor fat little Mother wont this time
No I will stay here I for one and have done with flying and running
we have had enough of that Seckendorf quite gone from Court in this
crisis reappears about the middle of April in questionable capacity
at a place called Fussen not far off at the foot of the Tyrol
Hillswhere certain Austrian Dignitaries seem also to be enjoying a
picturesque Easter Yes indeed and on APRIL 22d there is signed a
PEACE OF FUSSEN there general amicable ASYOUWERE between Austria
and Bavaria Renounce your AntiPragmatic moonshine forevermore vote

Seckendorf it is presumable will get his Turkish arrears liquidated

intentions of secularizing Salzburg secularizing Passau Regensburg
and loud tremulous denial of suchCarteret and Wilhelm of Hesseu
Conferences of Hanau which ruined Carteret in vain King Friedrich
and many Kings in vain a thing nobody could settleand it has at
last settled itself as the generality of illguided and unlucky things
do by collapse Delirium once out the law of gravity acts and there
the mad matter lies

Bought by Austria that old villain cry the French Friedrich does
not think the Austrians bought Seckendorf having no money at present
but guesses they may have given him to understand that a certain large
arrear of payment due ever since those Turkish Warswhen Seckendorf
instead of payment was lodged in the Fortress of Gratz and almost
got his head cut offshould now be paid down in cash or authentic
Papermoney if matters become amicable  _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii

Chapter VIIFRIEDRICH IN SILESIA UNUSUALLY BUSY

Here sure enough are sad new intricacies in the Diplomatic hypothetic
sphere of things and clouds piling themselves ahead in a very minatory
manner to King Friedrich Let King Friedrich all the more get his
Fighting Arrangements made perfect Diplomacy is clouds beating of
your enemies is sea and land Austria and the Gazetteer world consider
Friedrich to be as good as finished but that is privately far from
being Friedrichs own opinionthough these occurrences are heavy and
dismal to him as none of us can now fancy

Herr Ranke has got access in the Archives to a series of private
utterances by FriedrichLetters from him of a franker nature than
usual and letting us far deeper into his mindwhich must have been
well worth reading in the original in their fully dated and developed
condition From Herr Rankes Fragmentary Excerpts let us thankful
for what we have got select one or two The Letters are to Minister
Podewils at Berlin written from Silesia Neisse and neighborhood
where since the middle of March Friedrich has been personally pushing
on his Army Preparations while the above sinister things befell




KING FRIEDRICH TO PODEWILS IN BERLIN under various dates MarchApril
1745

NEISSE 29th MARCH We find ourselves in a great crisis If we
dont by mediation of England get Peace our enemies from different
sides Saxony Austria who knows if not Russia withal will come
plunging in against me Peace I cannot force them to But if they
must have War we will either beat them or none of us will see Berlin
again Ranke iii 236 et seqq

APRIL no day given In any case I have my troops well together
The sicknesses are ceasing the recruitments are coming in shortly all
will be complete That does not hinder us from making Peace if it will
only come but in the contrary case nobody can accuse me of neglecting
what was necessary

APRIL 17th still from Neisse I toil day and night to improve our
situation The soldiers will do their duty There is none among us who
will not rather have his backbone broken than give up one footbreadth
of ground They must either grant us a good Peace or we will surpass
ourselves by miracles of daring and force the enemy to accept it from
us

APRIL 20th Our situation is disagreeable constrained a kind of
spasm but my determination is taken If we needs must fight we will do
it like men driven desperate Never was there a greater peril than
that I am now in Time at its own pleasure will untie this knot or
Destiny if there is one determine the event The game I play is so
high one cannot contemplate the issue with cold blood Pray for the
return of my good luckTwo days hence the poor young KurBaiern
deaf to the French seductions and exertions which were intense had
signed his Peace of Fussen 22d April 1745a finale to France on
the German Field as may be feared The other Fragments we will give a
little farther on

Friedrich had left Berlin for Silesia March 15th rather sooner than he
counted onOld Leopold pleading to be let home At Glogau at Breslau
there had been the due inspecting Friedrich got to Neisse on the 23d
Bathyani just stirring in that Bavarian Business Vilshofen and the
Hessians close ahead and on the 27th had dismissed Old Leopold
with thanks and sympathiessent him home to recover his health
Leopolds health is probably suffering but his heart and spirits still
more Poor old man he has just lostthe other week 5th February
lasthis poor old Wife at Dessau and is broken down with grief The
soft silk lining of his hard Existence in all parts of it is torn
away Apothecary Foss Daughter Reichs Princess Princess of Dessau
called by whatever name she had been the truest of Wives used to
attend him in all his Campaigns for above fifty years back Gone
now forever goneOld Leopold had wells of strange sorrow in the
rugged heart of himsorrow and still better thingswhich he does
not wear on his sleeve Here is an incident I never can forgetdating
twelve or thirteen years ago as is computable middle of July 1732

Louisa Leopolds eldest Daughter Wife of Victor Leopold reigning
Prince of AnhaltBernburg lay dying of a decline Still only
twentythree poor Lady though married seven years agothe end now
evidently drawing nigh A few days before her deathperhaps some
attendant sorrowfully asking Can we do nothing thenshe was heard
to say If I could see my Father at the head of his Regiment yet
onceHalle where the Regiment lies is some thirty or more miles
off and King Friedrioh Wilhelm I suppose would have to be written
toLeopold was ready the soonest possible and at a set hour
marched in all pomp with banner flying music playing into the
SCHLOSSHOF Palace Court of Bernburg and did the due salutations
and manoeuvringshis poor Daughter sitting at her window till they
endedfigure them the last glitter of those muskets the last wail
of that bandmusicThe Regiment was then marched to the Waisenhaus
ORPHANHOUSE where the common men were treated with bread and beer
all the Officers dining at the Princes Table All the Officers except
Leopold alone who stole away out of the crowd sat himself upon the
balustrade of the Saale Bridge and wept into the river LEBEN 12mo
not Rannfts but Anonymous like his p 234 nLeopold is now on the
edge of seventy ready to think all is finished with him Perhaps not
quite my tough old friend recover yourself a little and we shall see

Old Leopold is hardly home at Dessau when new Pandour Tempests tides
of ravaging War again come beating against the Giant Mountains pouring
through all passes from utmost Jablunka westward by Jagerndorf to
Glatz huge influx of wild riding hordes each with some support of
Austrian grenadiers cannoniers threatening to submerge Silesia
Precursors Friedrich need not doubt of a strenuous regular attempt
that way Hungarian Majestys fixed intention hope and determination
is To expel him straightway from Silesia Her Patent circulates
these three months calling on all men to take note of that fixed
fact especially on all Silesian men to note it well and shift their
allegiance accordingly Silesian men in great majorityour friend
the Mayor of Landshut for exampleare believed to have no inclination
towards change and whoever has had clearly better not show any till he
see In Ranke iii 234 there is vestige of some intended
voluntary subscription by the common people of Glatz for Friedrichs
behoofcontrariwise in Orlich ii 380 6th February 1745 from
the Dessau Archives notice of one individual suspected of stirring
for Austria whom you are to put under lock and keybut he runs off
and has no successor that I hear of

Friedrichs thousandfold preliminary orderings movements rearrangings
in his Army matters must not detain us herestill less his dealings
with the Pandour element which is troublesome rather than dangerous
Vigilance wise swift determination valor drilled to its work can deal
with phenomena of that nature though never so furious and innumerable
Not a cheering service for drilled valor but a very needful one
Continual bickerings and skirmishings fell out sometimes rising to
sharp fight on the small scaleAustrian grenadiers with cannon are on
that Height to left and also on this to right meaning to cut off our
march the difficult landscape furnished out far and wide with Pandour
companies in position you must clash in my Burschen seize me that
cannonbattery yonder master such and such a postthere is the heart
of all that network of armed doggery slit asunder that the network
wholly will tumble over the Hills again Which is always done on
the part of the Prussian Burschen though sometimes not without
difficultyHis Majesty is forming Magazines at Neisse Brieg and
the principal Fortresses in those parts driving on all manner of
preparations at the rapidest rate of speed and looking with his own
eyes into everything The regiments are about what we may call complete
arithmetically and otherwise the cavalry show good perfection in their
new mode of manoeuvringit is to be hoped the Fighting Apparatus
generally will give fair account of itself when the time comes Our one
anchor of hope as now more and more appears

On the Pandour element he first tried under General Hautcharmoi with
Winterfeld as chief active hand a direct outburst or two with a view
to slash them home at once But finding that it was of no use as they
always reappeared in new multitudes he renounced that took to calling
in his remoter outposts and except where Magazines or the like
remained to be cared for let the Pandours baffle about checked only by
the fortified Towns and more and more submerge the Hill Country Prince
Karl to be expected in the form of lion mysteriously uncertain on
which side coming to invade ushe and not the innumerable weasel
kind is our important matter By the end of April news of the PEACE
OF FUSSEN coming withal Friedrich had quitted Neisse lay cantoned in
Neisse Valley between Frankenstein and Patschkau able to assemble in
fortyeight hours studying with his whole strength to be ready
for the mysterious Prince Karl on whatever side he might arriveand
disregarding the Pandours in comparison

The points of inrush the tideways of these Pandour Deluges seem to be
mainly three Direct through the Jablunka upon Ratibor Country is
the first and chief less direct partly supplied by REFLUENCES from
Ratibor when Ratibor is found not to answer a second disembogues by
Jagerndorf a third the westernmost by Landshut Three main ingresses
at each of which there fall out little Fights which are still
celebrated in the Prussian Books and indeed well deserve reading by
soldiers that would know their trade In the Ratibor parts the invasive
leader is a General Karoly with 12000 under him who are the wildest
horde of all Karoly lodges in a wood for himself there is a tent
his companions sleep under trees or under the open sky by the edge of
morasses Ranke iii 244 It was against this Karoly and his horde
that Hautcharmois little expedition or express attacking party to
drive them home again was shot out 8th2lst April Which did its work
very prettily Winterfeld chief hand in it crowning the matter by a
Fight of Wurbitz Orlich ii 136 21st Aprilwhere Winterfeld
cutting the taproot in his usual electric way tumbles Karoly quite
INTO the morasses and clears the country of him for a time For a time
though for a time onlyKaroly or others returning in a week or two
to a still higher extent of thousands mischievous as ever in those
RatiborNamslau countries Upon which Friedrich finding this an
endless business and nothing like the most important gives it up for
the present calls in his remoter detachments has his Magazines carted
home to the Fortress TownsKaroly trying once or so to hinder in
that operation but only again getting his crown broken Fight of
Mocker May 4th Orlich ii 141 Or if carting be too difficult
still do not waste your MagazineMargraf Karl for instance is
ordered to Jagerndorf with his Detachment to eat the Magazine hungry
Pandours looking on till he finish On which occasion a renowned little
Fight took place Fight of Neustadt or of JagerndorfNeustadt as
shall be mentioned farther on

So that for certain weeks to come the Tolpatcheries had free course
in those Frontier parts and were left to rove about under check only
of the Garrison Towns Friedrich being obliged to look elsewhere
after higher perils which were now coming in view In which favorable
circumstances Karoly and Consorts did at last make one stroke in
those Ratibor countries that of Kosel which was greatly consolatory
26th May 1743 Orlich ii 156158 By treachery of an Ensign
who had deserted to them provoked by rigor of discipline or some
intolerable thing they glided stealthily one night across the
ditches into Kosel a halffortified place Prussian works only
half finished which being the Key of the Oder in those parts they
reckoned a glorious conquest of good omen and worthy of TEDEUMS at
Vienna And they did eagerly without the least molestation labor
to complete the Prussian works at Kosel One garrison already
ourswhich was not had from them without battering and I believe
burning when General von Nassau came to inquire after it in Autumn
next

Friedrich had always hoped that the Saxons who are not yet in declared
War with him though bound by Treaty to assist the Queen of Hungary
under certain conditions would not venture on actual Invasion of his
Territories but in this as readers anticipate Friedrich finds himself
mistaken Weissenfels is hastening from the Leitmeritz northwestern
quarter where he has wintered to join Prince Karl who is gathering
himself from Olmutz and his southeastern home region their full
intention is to invade Silesia together and they hope now at length to
make an end of Friedrich and it These Pandour hordes supported by the
necessary grenadiers and cannoniers are sent as vanguard these cannot
themselves beat him but they may induce him which they do not to
divide his Force they may in part burn him away as by slow fire
after which he will be the easier to beat Instead of which Friedrich
leaving the Pandours to their luck lies concentrated in Neisse Valley
watching with all his faculties Prince Karls own advent coming on
like Fate indubitable yet involved in mysteries hitherto and is
perilously sensible that only in giving that a good reception is there
any hope left him

Prince Karl who arrived in Olmutz April 30th commands in chief
againsaddened poor man by the loss of his young Wife in December
last willing to still his grief in action for the cause SHE lovedbut
old Traun is not with him this year which is a still more material
circumstance Traun is to go this year under cloak not of Prince Karl
but of GrandDuke Franz to clear those Frankfurt Countries for
the KAISERWAHL and him Prince Conti lies there with his famous
MiddleRhine Army DAhremberg from the western parts not nearly so
diligent upon him as one could wish and must at all rates be cleared
away Traun taking command of Bathyanis Army now that it has finished
the Bavarian job is preparing to push down upon Conti while Bathyani
who is to supersede the laggard DAhremberg shall push vigorously
upand before summer is over we shall hear of Traun again and Conti
will have heard

Friedrichs indignation on learning that the Saxons were actually on
march and gradually that they intended to invade him was great and
the whole matter is portentously enigmatic to him as he lies vigilant
in Neisse Valley waiting on the When and the How Indignationand
yet there is need of caution withal To be ready for events the Old
Dessauer has as one sure measure been requested to take charge once
more of a Camp of Observation on the Saxon Frontier as of old in
1741 and has given his consent April 25th consents Orlich ii
130 Camp of Magdeburg Camp of Dieskau for it had various names
and figures checkings of your hand then layings of it on heavier
lighter and again heavier according to ones various READINGS of the
Saxon Mystery and we shall hear enough about it intermittently till
December coming when it ended in a way we shall not forgetOn which
take this Note

The Camp of Observation was to have begun May 1st did begin somewhat
later near Magdeburg not too close on the Frontier nor in too
alarming strength was reinforced to about 30000 in which state
middle of August it stept forward to Wieskau then to Dieskau
close on the Saxon Border and becamewith a Saxon Camp lying close
opposite and War formally threatened or almost declared on Saxony
by Friedrichan alarmingly serious matter Friedrich however again
checked his hand and did not consummate till NovemberDecember But
did then consummate greatly against his will and in a way
flamingly visible to all men Orlich ii 130 209 210
_HeldenGeschichte_ ii 12241226 i 1117

Friedrichs own incidental utterances what more we have of Fractions
from the Podewils Letters in such portentous aspect of affairs may
now be worth giving It is not now to Jordan that he writes gayly
unbosoming himself as in the First Warpoor Jordan lies languishing
these many months consumptive too evidently dyingNot to Jordan
this time nor is the theme GLOIRE now but a far different




FRIEDRICH TO PODEWILS as before AprilMay 1745

April 20th or so Orders are come to Berlin orders to Podewilss
horror at such a thought Whitherward should Berlin be assaulted
the Official Boards the Preciosities and household gods are to betake
themselvesto Magdeburg all these which is an impregnable place
to Stettin the Two Queens and Royal Family if they like it better
Podewils in horror hair standing on end writes thereupon to Eichel
That he hopes the management in a certain contingency will be given
to Minister Boden he Podewils with his hair in that posture being
quite unequal to it Friedrich answers

APRIL 26th I can understand how you are getting uneasy you
Berliners I have the most to lose of you all but I am quiet and
prepared for events If the Saxons take part as they surely will in
the Invasion of Silesia and we beat them I am determined to plunge
into Saxony For great maladies there need great remedies Either
I will maintain my all or else lose my all Hear it friend and
understand itwith hair lying flat It is true the disaffection of
the Russian Court on such trifling grounds was not to be expected and
great misfortune can befall us Well a year or two sooner a year or
two laterit is not worth ones while to bother about the very worst
If things take the better turn our condition will be surer and firmer
than it was before If we have nothing to reproach ourselves with
neither need we fret and plague ourselves about bad events which can
happen to any manI am causing despatch a secret Order for Boden on
YOU know what which you will not deliver him till I give signOn
hearing of the Peace of Fussen perhaps a day or so later Friedrich
again writes

to possess myself in patience If all alliances resources and
negotiations fail and all conjunctures go against me I prefer to
perish with honor rather than lead an inglorious life deprived of all
dignity My ambition whispers me that I have done more than another to
the building up of my House and have played a distinguished part among
the crowned heads of Europe To maintain myself there has become as it
were a personal duty which I will fulfil at the expense of my happiness
and my life I have no choice left I will maintain my power or it
may go to ruin and the Prussian name be buried under it If the enemy
attempt anything upon us we will either beat him or we will all
be hewed to pieces for the sake of our Country and the renown of
Brandenburg No other counsel can I listen to

By what points the AustrianSaxon Armament will come through upon us
Together will it be or separately Saxons from the Lausitz Austrians
from Bohmen enclosing us between two fireswere enigmatic questions
with Friedrich and the Saxons especially are an enigma But that come
they will that these Pandours are their preliminary veilingapparatus
as usual is evident to him and that he must not spend himself upon
Pandours but coalesce and lie ready for the main wrestle So that from
April 28th as above noticed Friedrich has gone into cantonments some
way up the Neisse Valley westward of Neisse Town and is calling in his
outposts his detachments emptying his Frontier Magazinesabandoning
his UpperSilesian Frontier more and more and in the end altogether to
the Pandour hordes a small matter they compared to the grand Invasion
which is coming on Here with shiftings up the Neisse Valley he
lies till the end of May watching Arguslike and scanning with every
faculty the AustrianSaxon motions and intentions until at length they
become clear to him and we shall see how he deals with them

Chapter VIIITHE MARTIAL BOY AND HIS ENGLISH versus THE LAWS OF
NATURE

Glorious Campaign in the Netherlands Siege of Tournay final ruin
of the Dutch Barrier this is the French program for Season 1745no
Belleisle to contradict it Belleisle secure at Windsor who might have
leant more towards German enterprises And to this his Britannic Majesty
small gain to him from that adroitness in the Harz last winter has
to make front And is strenuously doing so by all methods especially
by heroic expenditure of money and ditto exposure of his Martial Boy
Poor old Wade last yearperhaps Wade did suffer as he alleged
from want of sufficient authority in that mixed Army Well here is a
Prince of the Blood Royal Highness of Cumberland to command in
chief With a Konigseck to drynurse him may not Royal Highness luck
favoring do very well Luck did not favor Britannic Majesty neither
in the Netherlands over seas nor at home strange new domestic wool of
a tarry HIGHLAND nature being thrown him to card on the sudden made
a good Campaign but a bad And again a bad 1746 and again 1747
ever again till he pleased to cease altogether Of which distressing
objects we propose that the following one glimpse be our last




BATTLE OF FONTENOY 11th May 1745

 In the end of April Marechal de Saxe now become very famous for
his sieges in the Netherlands opened trenches before Tournay King
Louis with his Dauphin not to speak of mistresses playactors and
cookery apparatus in wagons innumerable hastens to be there A
fighting Army say of 70000 besides the garrisons and great things
it is expected will be done Tournay in spite of strong works and
Dutch garrison of 9000 to be taken in the first place

Of the Siege which was difficult and ardent we will remember nothing
except the mischance that befell a certain Marquis de Talleyrand
and his men in the trenches one night Night of the 8th9th May by
carelessness of somebody a spark got into the Marquiss powder two
powderbarrels that there were and with horrible crash sent eighty

other world raining down their limbs into the covered way where
the Dutch were very inhuman to them and provoked us to retaliate

turns out on study of the French Peerages to be Uncle of a lame little
Boy who became Right Reverend Tallyrand under singular conditions and
has made the name very current in aftertimes

Hearing of this Siege the Duke of Cumberland hastened over from
England with intent to raise the same Mustered his Allied Army once

straightway his Royal Highness 60000 strong let us say set forth by
slowish marches and a route somewhat leftward of the great Tournay Road
no place on it except perhaps STEENKERKE ever heard of by an English
reader and on Sunday 9th May Espagnac ii 27 precisely on the
morrow after poor Talleyrand had gone aloft reached certain final
Villages Vezon Maubray where he encamps Briffoeil to rear Camp
looking towards Tournay and the setting sunwith Fontenoy short
way ahead and Antoine to left of it and Barry with its Woods to
rightsmall peaceable Villages which become famous in the Newspapers
shortly after Patch of Map at p 440 Royal Highness resting here
at Vezon is but some six or seven miles from Tournay in low undulating
Country woody here and there not without threads of running water
and with frequent Villages and their adjuncts the part of it now
interesting to us lies all between the BrusselsTournay Road and
the Scheld Riverall in immediate front of his Royal Highnessto
southeastward from beleaguered Tournay where said Road and River
intersect How shall he make some impression on the Siege of Tournay
That is now the question and his Royal Highness struggles to manoeuvre
accordingly

Marechal de Saxe whose habit is much that of vigilance forethought
sagacious precaution singular in so dissolute a man has neglected
nothing on this occasion He knows every foot of the ground having
sieged here in his boyhood once before Leaving the siegetrenches at
Tournay under charge of a ten or fifteen thousand he has taken camp
here still with superior force 56000 as they count Royal Highness
being only 50000 ranked barring Royal Highnesss way Tournay or
at least the Marechals trenches there are on the right bank of the
Scheld which flows from southeast securing all on that hand The broad
Brussels Highway comes in to him from the eastnorth of that he has
nothing to fear the ground being cut with bogs no getting through
upon him that way to Tournay and what he calls the Under Scheld The
Upper Scheld too avail them nothing There is only that triangle
to the southeast between Road and River where the Enemy is now
manoeuvring in front of him from which damage can well come and he has
done his best to be secure there Four villages or hamlets close to
the Scheld and onwards to the Great RoadAntoine Fontenoy Barry
Ramecroix with their lanes and boscagesmake a kind of circular base
to his triangle base of some six or eight miles with hollows in it
brooks and northward a considerable Wood BOIS DE BARRY enveloping
Barry and Ramecroix which do not prove of much interest to us though
the BOIS does of a good deal In and before each of those villages
are posts and defences in Antoine and Fontenoy elaborate redoubts
batteries redans connecting in the Wood BOIS DE BARRY an abattis
or wall of felled trees as well as cannon and at the point of the
Wood well within double range of Fontenoy is a Redoubt called of Eu
REDOUTE DEU from the regiment occupying it which will much concern
his Royal Highness and us Saxe has a hundred pieces of cannon say the
English which is correct consummately disposed along this space no
ingress possible anywhere except through the cannons throat torrents
of fire and crossfire playing on you He is armed to the teeth as they
say and has his 56000 arranged according to the best rules of tactics
behind this murderous line of works If his Royal Highness think of
breaking in he may count on a very warm reception indeed

Saxe is only afraid his Royal Highness will not Outside of these
lines with a 50000 dashing fiercely round us under any kind of
leading pouncing on our convoys harassing and sieging USour siege
of Toumay were a sad outlook And this is old Austrian Konigsecks
opinion too though they say Waldeck and the Dutch impetuous in
theory at least opined otherwise and strengthened Royal Highnesss
view Two young men against one old Be it so then His Royal
Highness resolute for getting in manoeuvres and investigates
all Monday 10th his cannon is not to arrive completely till night
otherwise he would be for breaking in at once a fearless young man
fearless as ever his poor Father was certainly a man SANS PEUY this
one too whether of much AVIS we shall see anon

Tuesday morning early 11th May 1745 cannon being up and
dispositions made his Royal Highness sallies out sees his men taking
their ground Dutch and Austrians to the left chiefly opposite Antoine
English with some Hanoverians in the centre and to the right
infantry in front facing Fontenoy cavalry to rear flanking the Wood
of BarryKonigseck Ligonier and others able assisting to plant
them advantageously cannon going on both sides the while radiant
enthusiasm SANS PEUR ET SANS AVIS looking from his Royal Highnesss
face He has been on horseback since two in the morning cannon started
thundering between five and sixhas killed chivalrous Grammont over
yonder the Grammont of Dettingen almost at the first volley And
now about the time when ploughers breakfast eight AM no ploughing
hereabouts today begins the attack simultaneously or in swift
succession on the various batteries which it will be necessary to
attack and storm

The attacks took place but none of them succeeded Dutch and
Austrians on the extreme left were to have stormed Antoine by the edge
of the River that was their main task right skirt of them to help US
meanwhile with Fontenoy And they advanced accordingly but found
the shot from Antoine too fierce especially when a subsidiary battery
opened from across the River and took them in flank the Dutch and
Austrians felt astonished and hastily drew aside under some sheltering
mound or earthwork they had found for themselves or prudently thrown
up the night before There under their earthwork stood the Dutch
and Austrians patiently expecting a fitter timewhich indeed never
occurred for always the instant they drew out the batteries from
Antoine and from across the River instantly opened upon them and they
had to draw in again So that they stood there in a manner all day
and so to speak did nothing but patiently expect when it should be time
to run For which they were loudly censured and deservedly Antoine is
and remains a total failure on the part of the Dutch and Austrians

Royal Highness in person with his English was to attack
Fontenoyand is doing so by battery and storm at various points
with emphasis though without result As preliminary at an early stage
he had sent forward on the right by the Wood of Barry a Brigadier
Ingoldsby with Semples Highlanders and other force to silence that
redoubt yonder at the point of the Woodredoubt fort or whatever it
be famous REDOUTE DEU as it turned outwhich guards Fontenoy to
north and will take us in flank nay in rear as we storm the cannon of
the Village Ingoldsby speed imperative on him pushed into the Wood
found French lighttroops God knows how many of them prowling
about there found the Redoubt a terribly strong thing with ditch
drawbridge what not spent thirty or forty of his Highlanders in
some frantic attempt on it by rule of thumband found He would need
artillery and other things In short Ingoldsby hasten what he might
could not perfect the preparations to his mind had to wait for this and
for that and did not storm the Redoubt dEu at all but hung fire in
an unaccountable manner For which he had to answer to CourtMartial
still more to the Newspapers afterwards and prove that it was
misfortune merely or misfortune and stupidity combined Too evident
the REDOUTE DEU was not taken then or thenceforth which might have
proved the saving of the whole affair could Ingoldsby have managed it
Royal Highness attacked Fontenoy and reattacked furiously thrice
over and had to desist and find Fontenoy impossible on those terms

Here is a piece of work Repulsed at all those points and on the left
and on the right no spirit visible but what deserves repulse His Royal
Highness blazes into resplendent PLATTDEUTSCH rage what we may call
spiritual whiteheat a man SANS PEUR at any rate and pretty much SANS
AVIS decides that he must and will be through those lines if it please
God that he will not be repulsed at his part of the attack not he for
one but will plunge through by what gap there is 900 yards Voltaire

there has a small irrefragable Document come to me which modifies it a
good deal and reduces matters to the business form Lord Charles
Hay LieutenantColonel practical Head of the First Regiment
of Footguards wrote about three weeks after or dictated in sad
spelling not himself able to write for wounds a Letter to his
Brother of which here is an Excerpt at first hand with only the
spelling altered It was our Regiment that attacked the French
Guards and when we came within twenty or thirty paces of them I
advanced before our Regiment drank to them to the French from the

the English Guards and hoped that they would stand till we came quite
up to them and not swim the Scheld as they did the Mayn at Dettingen
shameful THIRDBRIDGE not of wood though carpeted with blue cloth

dAuteroche came out of the ranks and tried to make his men huzza

totally ignorant on which side firstfired into rather feebly and
wounded by those DAuteroche people while he was still advancing with
shouldered armsupon which and not till which he did give it them
in liberal dose and quite blew them off the ground for that day
From all which one has to infer That the mutual salutation by hat was
probably a fact that for certain there was some slight preliminary
talk and gesticulation but in the Homeric style by no means in the
EspagnacFrenchnot chivalrous epigram at all mere rough banter and
what is called chaffingand in short that the French Messrooms
with their eloquent talent that way had rounded off the thing into the
current epigrammatic redaction the authentic businessform of it being

DAuteroche declining the first fireor accepting it if ever

DAuteroche responding more or less cannot stand it but has at once
to rustle into discontinuity he and his and roll rapidly out of the

manner A compact Column slowly advancingapparently of some 16000

The terrible Column with slow inflexibility advances cannon now in
reversed position from that Redoubt dEu Shame on you Ingoldsby
and irregular musketry from Fontenoy side playing upon it defeated
regiments making barriers of their dead men and firing there Column
always closing its gapped ranks and girdled with insupportable fire
It ought to have taken Fontenoy and Redoubt dEu say military men it
ought to have done several things It has now cut the French fairly in
twoand Saxe who is earnestly surveying it a hundred paces ahead
sends word conjuring the King to retire instantlyacross the Scheld
by Calonne Bridge and the strong rearguard therewho however will
not King and Dauphin on horseback both have stood at the Justice
GALLOWS in fact of our Lady of the Woods not stirring much
occasionally shifting to a windmill which is still higherye Heavens
with what intrepidity all daya good many countryfolk in trees
close behind them Countryfolk I suppose have by this time seen
enough and are copiously making off but the King will not though
things do look dubious

In fact the Battle hangs now upon a hair the Battle is as good as
lost thinks Marechal de Saxe His battlelines torn in two in that
manner hovering in ragged clouds over the field what hope is there in
the Battle Fontenoy is firing blank this some time its cannonballs
done Officers in Antoine are about withdrawing the artillerythen
again on new order replacing it awhile All are looking towards the
Scheld Bridge earnestly entreating his Majesty to withdraw Had the
Dutch at this point of time broken heartily in as Waldeck was urging
them to do upon the redoubts of Antoine or had his Royal Highness the
Duke for his own behoof possessed due cavalry or artillery to act upon
these ragged clouds which hang broken there very fit for being swept
were there an artilleryandhorse besom to do itin either of these
cases the Battle was the Dukes And a right fiery victory it would
have been to make his name famous and confirm the English in their mad
method of fighting like Baresarks or Janizaries rather than strategic
human creatures See in Buschings _Magazin_ xvi 169 Your
illustrious Column at Fontenoy It was fortuitous I say done like
janizaries and so forth a Criticism worth reading by soldiers

But neither of these contingencies had befallen The DutchAustrian
wing did evince some wish to get possession of Antoine and drew out a
little but the guns also awoke upon them whereupon the DutchAustrians
drew in again thinking the time not come As for the Duke he had taken
with him of cannon a good few but of horse none at all impossible for
horse unless Fontenoy and the Redoubt dEu were oursand his horse
have been hanging about in the Wood of Barry all this while uncertain
what to do their old Commander being killed withal and their new a
dubitative person and no orders left The Duke had left no orders
having indeed broken in here in what we called a spiritual whiteheat
without asking himself much what he would do when in Beat the French
knock them to powder if I canMeanwhile the French clouds are
reassembling a little Royal Highness too is readjusting himself now
got 300 yards ahead of Fontenoypauses there about half an hour not
seeing his way farther

During which pause Duc de Richelieu famous blackguard man gallops
up to the Marechal gallops rapidly from Marechal to King suggesting
were cannon brought AHEAD of this close deep Column might not they
shear it into beautiful destruction and then a general charge be made
So counselled Richelieu it is said the Jacobite Irishman Count Lally
of the Irish Brigade was prime author of this notiona man of tragic
notoriety in time coming Thomas Arthur Lally Comte de Tollendal
patronymically OMULALLY of TULLINDALLY a place somewhere in
Connaught undiscoverable where not material where see our
dropsical friend in one of his wheeziest states _King Jamess Irish
ArmyList_ Dublin 1855 pp 594600 Whoever was author of it
Marechal de Saxe adopts it eagerly King Louis eagerly swift it becomes
a fact Universal rally universal simultaneous charge on both flanks
of the terrible Column this it might resist as it has done these two
hours past but cannon ahead shearing gaps through it from end to end
this is what no column can resistand only perhaps one of Friedrichs
columns if even that with Friedrichs eye upon it could make its
halfrightabout QUART DE CONVERSION turn its side to it and
manoeuvre out of it in such circumstances The wrathful English
column slit into ribbons can do nothing at manoeuvring blazes and
ragesmore and more clearly in vain collapses by degrees rolls into
ribboncoils and winds itself out of the field Not much chasedits
cavalry now seeing a job and issuing from the Wood of Barry to cover
the retreat Not much chasedyet with a loss they say in all of
7000 killed and wounded and about 2000 prisoners French loss being
under 5000

The Dutch and Austrians had found that the fit time was now come or
taken time by the forelocktheir part of the loss they said was a
thousand and odd hundreds The Battle ended about two oclock of the
day had begun about eight Tuesday 11th May 1745 one of the hottest
halfdays works I have known A thing much to be meditated by the
English mindKing Louis stept down from the GallowsHill of Our Lady
and KISSED Marechal de Saxe Saxe was nearly dead of dropsy could not
sit on horseback except for minutes was carried about in a wicker bed
has had a lead bullet in his mouth all day to mitigate the intolerable
thirst Tournay was soon taken the Dutch garrison though strong and
in a strong place making no due debate

Royal Highness retired upon Ath and Brussels hovered about nothing
daunted he or his Dastard fellows they would not come out into the
open ground and try us fairly snort indignantly the Gazetteers and
enlightened Public Old Newspapers Nothing dauntedbut as it
were did not do anything farther this Campaign except lose Gand by
negligence VERSUS vigilance and eat his victualstill called home
by the Rebellion Business in an unexpected manner Fontenoy was the
nearest approach he ever made to getting victory in a battle but a
miss too as they all were He was nothing like so rash on subsequent
occasions but had no better luck and was beaten in all his
battlesexcept the immortal Victory of Culloden alone Which latter
indeed was it not itself in the Gazetteer mind a kind of apotheosis
or lifting of a man to the immortal godsby endless tarbarrels and
beer for the time being

Old Marechal de Noailles was in this Battle busy about the redans and
proud to see his Saxe do well Chivalrous Grammont too as we saw
was therekilled at the first discharge Prince de Soubise too not
killed a certain Lord George Sackville hurt slightlyperhaps had

The French made immense explosions of rejoicing over this Victory of
Fontenoy Voltaire now a man well at Court celebrating it in prose and
verse to an amazing degree 21000 copies sold in one day the whole

Chapter IXTHE AUSTRIANSAXON ARMY INVADES SILESIA ACROSS THE
MOUNTAINS

Valori who is to be of Friedrichs Campaign this Year came posting off
directly in rear of the glorious news of Fontenoy found Friedrich at
Camenz rather in spirits than otherwise and lodged pleasantly with
Abbot Tobias and him till the Campaign should begin Two things
surprise Valori first the great strength impregnable as it were
to which Neisse has been brought since he saw it lastsuperlative
condition of that Fortress and of the Army itself as it gathers
daily more and more about Frankenstein hereand then secondly and
contrariwise the strangely neglected posture of mountainous or Upper
Silesia given up to Pandours Quite submerged in a manner Margraf
Karl lies quiet among them at Jagerndorf eating his magazine General
Hautcharmoi Winterfelds late chief in that Wurben affair with his
small Detachment still hovers about in those Ratibor parts with
the Strong Towns to fallback upon or has in effect fallen back
accordingly and nothing done to coerce the Pandours at all While
Prince Karl and Weissenfels are daily coming on in force 100000 their
intention certain force say about 100000 regular Very singular to
Valori

Sire will not you dispute the Passes then asks Valori amazed Not
defend your Mountain rampart then MON CHER the Mountain rampart is
three or four hundred miles long there are twelve or twenty practicable
roads through it One is kept in darkness too endless Pandour doggery
shutting out your daylightill defending such a rampart answers
Friedrich But how then persists Valori but One day the King
answered me says Valori MON AMI if you want to get the mouse
dont shut the trap leave the trap open ON LAISSE LA SOURICIERE
OUVERTE Which was a beam of light to the inquiring thought of
Valori a military man of some intelligence See VALORI i 222 224
228

That in fact is Friedrichs purpose privately formed He means that
the Austrians shall consider him cowed into nothing as he understands
they already do that they shall enter Silesia in the notion of chasing
him and shall if need be have the pleasure of chasing himtill
perhaps a right moment arrive For he is full of silent finesse this
young King soon sees into his man and can lead him strange dances on
occasion In no man is there a plentifuler vein of cunning nor of a
finer kind Lynxeyed perspicacity inexhaustible contrivance prompt
ingenuitya man very dangerous to play with at games of skill And
it is cunning regulated always by a noble sense of honor too
instinctively abhorrent of attorneyism and the swindler element a
cunning sharp as the vulpine yet always strictly human which is
rather beautiful to see This is one of Friedrichs marked endowments
Intellect sunclear wholly practical need not be specially deep
and entirely loyal to the fact before it thisif you add rapidity
and energy prompt weight of stroke such as was seldom met withwill
render a man very dangerous to his adversary in the game of warHere
is the last of our Pandour Adventures for the present

From May 12th Friedrich had been gathering closer and closer about
Frankenstein by the end of the month 28th as it proved he intends
that all Detachments shall be home and the Army take Camp there The
most are home Margraf Karl at Jagerndorf has not yet done eating his
magazine but he too must come home Summon the Margraf homeit is not
doubted he will cut himself through he and his 12000 but such is
the swarm of Pandours hovering between him and us no estafette or
cleverest letterbearer can hope to get across to him Ziethen with 500
Hussars he must take the Letter there is no other way Ziethen mounts
fares swiftly forth towards Neustadt with his Letter lodges in
woods dodges the thickcrowding Tolpatcheries passes himself off for a
Tolpatchery say some and captures Hungarian StaffOfficers who come to
give him orders Frau van Blumenthal _Life of De Ziethen_ pp 171181

Orlich ii 150 but also Ranke iii 245 Preuss c is at
length found out and furiously set upon Ziethen Hahbut gets
to Jagerndorf Margraf Karl coming out to the rescue and delivers his
Letter Home then all of us tomorrow And so Saturday 22d May
before we get to Neustadt on the way home there is an authentic passage
of arms done very brilliantly by Margraf Karl against Pandours and
others

To right of us to left barring our road the enemy 20000 of
them stand ranked on heights in chosen positions cannonbatteries
grenadiers dragoons of Gotha and infinite Pandours military jungle
bristling far and wide And you must push it heartily and likewise
cut the taproot of it seize its big guns or it will not roll away
Margraf Karl shoots forth his steady infantry Silent till you see
the whites of their eyeshis cavalry with new manoeuvres whose
behavior is worthy of Ziethen himselfin brief the jungle is struck
as by a whirlwind the taproot of it cut and rolls simultaneously out
of range leaving only the Regiment of Gotha Regiment of Ogilvy and
some Regulars who also get torn to shreds and utterly ruined Seeing
which the Pandour jungle plunges wholly into the woods uttering
horrible cries EN POUSSANT DES CRIS TERRIBLES says Friedrich

day and to prove himself says the Cousin worthy of the
grandfather he came frommy own greatgrandfather Great Elector
FriedrichWilhelm whose style of motion at Fehrbellin or on the ice
of the Frische Haf soldiers all in sledges tearing along to be at the
Swedes was probably somewhat of this kind

Some days ago Winterfeld had been pushed out to Landshut with
Detachment of 2000 to judge a little for himself which way the
Austrians were coming and to scare off certain Uhlans the SAXON
species of Tolpatchery who were threatening to be mischievous
thereabouts The Uhlans at sound of Winterfeld jingled away at once
but in a day or two there came upon him on the sudden Pandour
outburst in quite other forceand in the very hours while Ziethen was
struggling into Jagerndorf and still more emphatically next day while
Margraf Karl was handling his PandoursColonel Winterfeld a hundred
miles to westward lapped among the Mountains chanced to be dealing
again with the same article Very busy with it from 4 oclock this
morning likely to give a good account of the job Steadily defending
Landshut and himself against the grenadier battalions cannon and
furious overplus of Pandours 8000 or 9000 it is said six to one
or so in the article of cavalry which General Nadasti a scientific
leader of men or Pandours skilfully and furiously hurls upon Landshut

themselvesto one who is a judge of men and greatly needs for his own
use the firstrate quality in that article

Friedrich has left the mousetrap openand latterly has been baiting
it with a pleasant spicing of toasted cheese One of his Spies
reporting from Prince Karls quarters Friedrich has at this time
discovered to be a DoubleSpy reporting thither as well DoubleSpy
there is an ugly factperhaps not quite convenient to abolish it
by hemp and gibbet perhaps it could be turned to use as most facts
can Very good my expert Herr von Schonfeld that was the
knaves name and now of all things whenever the Prince does get
acrossinstant word to us of that Nothing so important to us If
he should get BETWEEN us and Breslau for example what would the
consequence be To this purport Friedrich instructs his DoubleSpy
sends him off unhanged to Prince Karls Camp to blab this fresh bit
of knowledge We likewise says Friedrich ordered some repairs on
the roads leading to Breslaulast turn of the hand to our bit of
toasted fragrancy And Prince Karl is actually striding forward at
an eager paceand Nadasti VERSUS Winterfeld the other day could
Winterfeld have guessed it was the actual vanguard of the march and
will be up again straightway Whereupon Winterfeld too is called home
and all eyes are bent on the Landshut side

Prince Karl under these fine omens had been urgent on the Saxons to be
swift Saxons under Weissenfels did at last get their cannon up
and we hear of them for certain in junction with the Austrians at
Schatzlar on the Bohemian side of the GiantMountains climbing with
diligence those wizard solitudes and highland wastes In a word they
roll across into Silesia to Landshut 29th May nothing doubting but
Friedrich has cowered into what retreats he has as good as desperate of
Silesia and will probably be first heard of in Breslau when they get
thither with their sieging guns No cautious sagacious old Feldmarschall
Traun is in that Host at present nothing but a Prince Karl and a
poor Duke of Weissenfels who are too certain of several thingsvery
capable of certainty and also of doubt the wrong way of the facts
Their force is by strict count 75000 and they march from Landshut
detained a little by provender concerns on the last day of May

May 28th Friedrich had encamped at Frankenstein May 30th he sets
forth northwestward to be nearer the new scene encamps at Reichenbach
that night pushes forward again next day for Schweidnitz for
Striegau in all a shift northwest of some forty milesand from June
1st lies stretched out between Schweidnitz and Striegau nine miles
long well hidden in the hollows of the little Rivers thereabouts
Schweidnitz Water Striegau Water with their little knolls and
hills watching Prince Karls probable place of egress from the Mountain
Country opposite His main Camp is from Schweidnitz to Jauernik some
five miles long but he has his vanguard up as far as Striegau Dumoulin
and Winterfeld as vanguard in good strength a little way behind or
westward of that Town and Stream Nassau and his Division are screened
in the Wood called Nonnenbusch NUNS BUSH and there are outposts
sprinkled all about and vedettes watching from the hilltops from
the Stanowitz Foxhill the Zedlitz Cowhill Winchill an Army not
courting observation but intent very much to observe Nadasti has
appeared again at Freyburg few miles off on this side of the
Mountains goes out scouting reconnoitring but is fired at from the
growing corn and otherwise hoodwinked by false symptoms and makes
little of that business Friedrichs Army we will compute at 70000
GeneralLieutenant Freiherr Leo von Lutzow _Die Schlacht von
Hohenfriedbeg_ Potsdam 1845 pp 18 21 Not quite equal in number
to Prince Karls and in other particulars willing and longing that
Prince Karl would arrive and try its quality

Friedrichs headquarter is at Jauernik he goes daily riding hither
thither to the top of the Fuchsberg FOXHILL at Stanowitz with eager
spyglass daily many times looks with his spyglass to the ragged peaks
about Bolkenhayn Kauder Rohnstock expecting the throw of the dice
from that part On Thursday 3d June Do you notice that cloud of dust
rising among the peaks over yonder Dustcloud mounting higher and
higher There comes the big crisis then There are the combined
Weissenfels and Karl with their Austrian Saxons issuing proudly from
their stone labyrinth guns equipments baggages all perfectly brought
through rich Silesian plain country now fairly at their feet Breslau
itself but a few marches offat sight of all which the Austrian big
host bursts forth into universal fieldmusic and shakes out its banners
to the wind Thursday 3d June 1745 a dramatic Entry of something
quite considerable on the Stage of History

Friedrich with Nassau and generals round stands upon the
Fuchsberghis remarks not given his looks or emotions not described
to us his thought well knownand looks at it through his TUBUS or
spyglass There they are then and the big moment is come Friedrich
had seen the dust and the manoeuvring of them deeper in the Hills from
this same Fuchsberg yesterday and inferred what was coming calculated
by what roads or hilltracks they could issue and how he in each case
was to deal with them his marchroutes are all settled plankbridges
repaired all privately is ready for these proud Austrian musical
gentlemen here in the hollow Friedrich has been upon this Fuchsberg
with his TUBUS daily many times since Monday last it is our general
observatorium says Stille and commands a fine view into the interior
of these Hills A Fuchsberg which has become notable in the Prussian
maps the Stanowitz Fuchsberg east side of Striegau Waterlet
no tourist mistake himself for there are two or even three other
Fuchsbergs a mile or so northward on the western side of that Stream
which need to be distinguished by epithets as the Striegau Fuchsberg
the Graben Fuchsberg and perhaps still others comparable to the FOUR
Neisse rivers three besides the one we know which occur in this piece
of Country Our German cousins I have often sorrowed to find have
practically a most poor talent for GIVING NAMES and indeed much
for ages back is lying in a sad state of confusion among them Many
confused things rotting far and wide in contradiction to the plainest
laws of Nature things as well as names All the welcomer this Prussian
Army this young Friedrich leading it they beyond all earthly entities
of their epoch are not in a state of confusion but of most strict
conformity to the laws of Arithmetic and facts of Nature perhaps a very
blessed phenomenon for Germany in the longrun

Prince Karl with Weissenfels General Berlichingen and many plumed
dignitaries are dining on the Hilltop near Hohenfriedberg after
having given order about everything they witness there over their
wine the issue of their Columns from the Mountains which goes on all
afternoon with fieldmusic spread banners and the oldest General
admits he never saw a finer reviewmanoeuvre or one better done if
so well Thus sit they on the Hilltop GALGENBERG not far from the
gallows of the place says Friedrich in the beautiful June afternoon
Silesia lying beautifully azure at their feet the Zobtenberg enchanted
Mountain blue and high on ones eastern horizon Prussians noticeable
only in weak hussar parties four or five miles off which vanish in the
hollow grounds again All intending for Breslau they it is
likeand here red wine and the excellent manoeuvre going on The
AustrianandSaxon Army streamed out all afternoon says a Country
Schoolmaster of those parts whose Daybook has been preserved In
Lutzow pp 123132 each regiment or division taking the place
appointed it all afternoon till late in the night submerging the
Country as in a deluge five miles long of them taking post at the
foot of the Hills there from Hohenfriedberg round upon Striegau
looking towards the morrows sunrise To us poor countryfolk not a
beautiful sight their light troops flying ahead and doing theft and
other mischief at a sad rate

On the other hand the Austrian and Saxon gentlemen from their
GallowsHill at Hohenfriedberg notice four or five miles in the
distance opposite them or a little to the left of opposite a Body
of Prussian horse and foot visibly wending northward like a long
glittering serpent the glitter of their muskets flashing back yonder
on the afternoon sun and us as they mount from hollow to height Ten or
twelve thousand of them making for Striegau to appearance Intending
to bivouac or billet there and keep some kind of watch over us
belike with an eye to being rearguard on the retreat towards Breslau
tomorrow Or will they retreat without attempting mischief Serenity of
Weissenfels engages to seize the heights and proper posts over
yonder this night yet and will take Striegau itself the first thing
tomorrow morning

Yes your Serenities those are Prussians in movement Vanguard Corps of
Dumoulin WinterfeldRittmeister Seydlitz rides yonderand it is not
their notion to retreat without mischief For there stands not so far
off on the Stanowitz Fuchsberg a brisk little Gentleman if you could
notice him with his eyes fixed on you and plans in the head of him
now getting nearly mature For certain he is pushing out that column of
men and all manner of other columns are getting order to push out
and take their ground and tomorrow morningyou will not find him in
retreat Such are the phenomena in that StriegauHohenfriedberg region
while the sun is bending westward on Thursday 3d June 1745

From Hohenfriedberg which leans against the higher Mountains there
may be across to Striegau northeast which stands well apart from them
among lower Hills of its own a distance of about five English miles
The intervening country is of flat though upland nature the first
broad stage or STAIRSTEP so to speak leading down into the general
interior levels of Silesia in those parts A tract which is now
tolerably dried by draining but was then marshy as well as bushyflat
to the eye yet must be imperceptibly convexed a little for the line of
watershed is hereabouts walk from Hohenfriedberg to Striegau the
water on your left hand flows though mainly in ditches or imperceptible
oozings to the north and westthere to fall into an eastern fork of
the Roaring Neisse one of our three new Neisses which is a very quiet
stream here runs close by the Mountain base fed by many torrents
and must get its name WUTHENDE or Roaring from the suddenness of its
floods into this bound northward and westward run or ooze all waters
on your left hand as you go to Striegau Right hand again or to
eastward you will find all sauntering or running in visible brooks
into Striegau Water little River notable to us which comes circling
from the Mountains past Hohenfriedberg farther south and has got to
some force as a stream before it reaches Striegau and turns abruptly
eastwardeastward to join Schweidnitz Water and form with it the
SECOND stairstep downwards to the Plain Country Has its Fuchsbergs
Kuhbergs and little knolls and heights interspersed on both sides of
it in the conceivable way

So that looking eastward from the heights of Hohenfriedberg our broad
stage or stairstep has nothing of the nature of a valley but rather is
a kind of insensibly swelling plain between two valleys or hollows
of small depth and slopes both ways Both ways but MORE towards the
StriegauWater valley or hollow and thence in a lazily undulating
manner to other hollows and waters farther down Friedrichs Camp lies
in the next the SchweidnitzWater hollow and is five or even
nine miles long from Schweidnitz northwardmuch hidden from the
AustrianSaxon gentlemen at present No hills farther mere flat
country to eastward of that But to the north again about Striegau
the hollow deepens narrows and certain Hills much notable at
present rise to west of Striegau definite peaked Hills with granite
quarries in them and basalt blocks atopStriegau it appears is in
old Czech dialect TRZIZA which means TRIPLE HILL the Town of the
Three Hills Lutzow p 28 An ancient quaint little Town of perhaps
2000 souls browngray the stones of it venerably weathered has its
wide big marketplace piazza plainstones silent enough except on
marketdays nestles itself compactly in the shelter of its Three Hills
which screen it from the northwest and has a picturesque appearance
its Hills and it projected against the big Mountain range beyond as
you approach it from the Plain Country

Hohenfriedberg at the other corner of our battlestage on the road
to Landshut is a Village of no great compass but sticks pleasantly
together does not straggle in the usual way climbs steep against its
GallowsHill now called SIEGESBERG Victory Hill with some tower or
steeplemonument on it built by subscription and would look better
if trimmed a little and habitually well swept The higher Mountain
summits Landshut way or still more if you look southeastward
Glatzward rise blue and huge remote on your right to left the
Roaring Neisse range close at hand is also picturesque though less
Alpine in type Tourists Note 1858 And of all Hills the
notablest just now to us are those Three at Striegau

Those Three Hills of Striegau his Serenity of Weissenfels is to lay hold
of this night with his extreme left were it once got deployed and
bivouacked Those Hills if he can but Prussian Dumoulin is already
on march thither and privately has his eye upon them on Friedrichs
partFor the rest this upland platform insensibly sloping two ways
and as yet undrained is of scraggy boggy nature in many places much
of it damp ground or sheer morass better parts of it covered at this
season with rank June grass or greener luxuriance of oats and barley
A humble peaceable scene peaceable till this afternoon dotted too
with six or seven poor Hamlets with scraggy woods where they have
their fuel most sleepy littery ploughman Hamlets sometimes with a
SCHLOSS or Mansion for the owner of the soil who has absconded in the
present crisis of things their evening smoke rising rather fainter
than usual much cookery is not advisable with Uhlans and Tolpatchcs
flying about Northward between Striegau and the higher Mountains there
is an extensive TEICHWIRTHSCHAFT or PondHusbandry gleaming visible
from Hohenfriedberg GallowsHill just now a combination of stagnant
pools and carpponds the ground much occupied hereabouts with what
they name CarpHusbandry Which is all drained away in our time yet
traceable by the studiousquaggy congeries of sluices and fishponds
no road through them except on intricate dams have scrubby thickets
about the borderthis also is very strong ground if Weissenfels
thought of defence there

Which Weissenfels does not but only of attack He occupies the ground
nevertheless rearward of this CarpHusbandry as becomes a strategic
man gradually bivouacking all round there to end on the Three Hills
were his last regiments got up The CarpHusbandry is mainly about
Eisdorf Hamletin Pilgramshayn where Weissenfels once thought of
lodging lives our Writing Schoolmaster The Mountains lie to westward
flinging longer shadows as the invasive troops continually deploy in
that beautiful manner and coil themselves strategically on the ground
a bent rope cordon or line THREE lines in depth reaching from the
front skirts of Hohenfriedberg to the Hills at Striegau againterrible
to behold

In front of Hohenfriedberg we say is the extremity or right wing of
the AustrianSaxon bivouac or will be when the process is complete
five miles to northeast sweeping round upon Striegau region will be
their left where mainly are the Saxonsto nestle upon those Three
Hills of Striegau whitherward however Dumoulin on Friedrichs behalf
is already on march AustrianSaxon bivouac as is the way in regulated
hosts can at once become AustrianSaxon orderofbattle and then
probably on the Chord of that Arc of five miles the big Fight will
roll tomorrow Striegau one end of it Hohenfriedbcrg the other
Flattish somewhat elliptic upland stairstep from the Mountains as
we called it tract considerably cut with ditches carphusbandries and
their tufts of wood line from Striegau to Hohenfriedberg being axis
or main diameter of it and in general the line of watershed there
probably will the tug of war be Friedrich on his Fuchsberg knows
this the AustrianSaxon gentlemen over their wine on the GallowsHill
do not yet know it but will know

It was about four in the afternoon when Valori with a companion
waiting a good while in the Kings Tent at Jauernik at last saw his
Majesty return from the Fuchsberg observatory Valori and friend have
great news Tournay fallen siege done your Majesty Valoris friend
is one De Latour who had brought word of Fontenoy important victory
on the Scamander as Friedrich indignantly defined it to himself and
was bid wait here till this SiegeofTournay consummation as helpful
to me as the Siege of Pekin should supervene They hasten to salute
his Majesty with the glorious tidings Hmph thinks Friedrich and
we are at deathgrips here little to be helped by your taking Pekin
However he lets wit of nothing I make my compliments mean to
fight tomorrow Valori i 228 Valori as old soldier and friend
volunteers to be there and assistGood

Friedrich I presume at this late hour of four may bc snatching a
morsel of dinner his orderlies are silently speeding plans taken
orders given To start all at eight in the evening for the Bridge
of Striegau there to cross and spread to the right and to the left
Silent not a word spoken not a pipe lighted silently across the
Striegau Water there A march of three miles for the nearest who are
here at Jauernik of nine miles for the farthest about Schweidnitz at
Schweidnitz leave all your baggage safe under the guns there To
the Bridge of Striegau diligently silently march along Bridge of
Striegau there cross Striegau Water and deploy to right and to left
in the way each of you knows These are Friedrichs orders

Late in the dusk Dumoulin and Winterfeld whom we saw silently on march
some hours ago have silently glided past Striegau and got into the
ThreeHill region which is some furlong or so farther northto his
surprise Dumoulin finds Saxon parties posting themselves thereabouts
He attacks said Saxon parties and after some slight tussle drives them
mostly from their Three Hills mostly not altogether one Saxon Hill
is precipitous on our hither side of it and we must leave that till the
dawn break Of the other Heights Dumoulin takes good possession with
cannon too to be ready against dawnand ranks himself out to leftward
withal along the plain ground for he is to be right wing had the
other troops come up These are now all under way astir from Jauernik
and Schweidnitz silently streaming along and Dumoulin bivouacs
herevery silent he not so silent the Saxons who are still marching
in over yonder to westward of Dumoulin their rearguard groping out
its posts as it best can in the dark Elsewhere miles and miles along
the foot of the Mountains AustrianSaxon watchfires flame through the
ambrosial night and it is an impressive sight for Dumoulinstill more
for the poor Schoolmaster at Pilgramshayn and others less concerned
than Dumoulin It was beautiful says Stille who was there to see
how the plain about Rohnstock and all over that way was ablaze with
thousands of watchfires TAUSEND UND ABER TAUSEND by the light of
these we could clearly perceive the enemys troops continually defile
from the Hills the whole night through Cited in Seyfarth i 630

Serenity of Weissenfels after all does not lodge at Pilgramshayn far
in the night he goes to sleep at Rohnstock a Schloss and Hamlet on
that fork of Roaring Neisse by the foot of the Mountains three or
four miles off yet handy enough for picking up Striegau the first
thing tomorrow His Highness Prince Karl lies in Hausdorf tolerable
quarters pretty much in the centre of his long bivouac days business
well done and bottle as ones wont rather is well enjoyed Nadasti
has been out scouting but was pricked into by hussar parties fired
into from the growing corn and could make out little but the image
of his own ideas Nadastis ultimate report is That the Prussians are
perfectly quiet in their camp from Jauernik to Schweidnitz watchfires
all alight sentries going their rounds And so they are in fact
sentries and watchfiresbut now nothing else there a mere shell of
a camp the men of it streaming steadily along without speech without
tobacco and many of them are across Striegau Bridge by this time

It was past eleven so close and continuous went this march before
Valori and his Latour with their carriages and furnitures could
find an interval and get well into it Never will Valori forget the
discipline of these Prussians and how they marched Difficult ways the
hard road is for their artillery the men march on each side sometimes
to midleg in waternever mind Wholly in order wholly silent Valori
followed them three leagues close and there was not one straggler
Every private man much more every officer knows well what grim errand
they are on and they make no remarks Steady as Time and except that
their shoes are not of felt silent as he The Austrian watchfires glow
silent manifold to leftward yonder silent overhead are the starsthe
path of all duty too is silent not about Striegau alone for every
welldrilled man Tomorrowwell tomorrow

A grimmish feeling against the Saxons is understood to be prevalent
among these men Bruhl Weissenfels himself have been reported talking
highReduce our King to the size of an Elector again and other
foolish thingsindeed grudges have been accumulating for some time
KEIN PARDON No quarter we hear has been a word among the Saxons
as they came along the Prussians growl to one another Very well then
None Nay Friedrichs general order is No prisoners you cavalry in
the heat of fight cavalry strike at the faces of them you infantry
keep your fire till within fifty steps bayonet withal is to be relied
on These were Friedrichs last general orders given in the hollow of
the night near the foot of that Fuchsberg where he had been so busy all
day a widish plain space hereabouts Striegau Bridge now near he had
lain snme time in his cloak waiting till the chief generals with
the heads of their columns could rendezvous here He then sprang
on horseback spoke briefly the essential things one of them the
aboveHad meant to be more minute in regard to positions and the
like but all is so in darkness embroiled by the flare of the Austrian
watchfires we can make nothing farther of localities at present
Striegau for right wing left wing opposite to Hohenfriedbergso and
Striegau Water well to rear of us Be diligent exact all faculties
awake your own sense and the Order of Battle which you know must do
the rest Forward steady can I doubt but you will acquit yourselves
like Prussian men And so they march across the Bridge at Striegau
south outskirt of the Townplank Bridge I am afraidand pour
themselves to right and to left continually the livelong night

To describe the Battle which ensued Battle named of Striegau or
Hohenfriedberg excels the power of human talentif human talent had
leisure for such employment It is the huge shock and clash of 70000
against 70000 placed in the way we said An enormous furious SIMALTAS

Chapter XBATTLE OF HOHENFRIEDBERG

With the first streak of dawn the dispute renewed itself between those
Prussians and Saxons who are on the Heights of Striegau The two Armies
are in contact here they lie wide apart as yet at the other end
Cannonading rises here on both sides in the dim gray of the morning
for the possession of these Heights The Saxons are outcannonaded and
dislodged other Saxons start to arms in support the cry To arms
spreads everywhere rouses Weissenfels to horseback and by sunrise a
furious storm of battle has begun in this part Hot and fierce on both
sides charges of horse shock after shock bayonetcharges of foot the
great guns going like Joves thunder and the continuous tearing storm
of small guns very loud indeed such a noise as our poor Schoolmaster
who lives on this spot thinks he will hear only once again when
the Last Trumpet sounds It did indeed he informs us resemble the
dissolution of Nature For all fell dark too a general element
of sulphurous powdersmoke streaked with dull blazes and death
and destruction very nigh What will become of poor pacific mortals
hereabouts Rittmeister Seydlitz Winterfeld his patron ride with
knit brows in these horsecharges fiery Rothenburg too Truchsess von
Waldburg at the head of his Divisionpoor Truchsess known in London
society a cannonball smites the life out of him and he ended here

At the first clash of horse and foot the Saxons fancied they rather
had it at the second their horse became distressed at the third
they rolled into disorderly heaps The foot also stubborn as they
were could not stand that swift firing followed by the bayonet and the
sabre and were forced to give ground The morning sun shone into their
eyes too they say and there had risen a breath of easterly wind
which hurled the smoke upon them so that they could not see Decidedly
staggering backwards getting to be taken in flank and ruined though
poor Weissenfels does his best About five in the morning Friedrich
came galloping hitherward Valori with him MON AMI this is looking
well This will do wont it The Saxons are fast sinking in the scale
and did nothing thenceforth but sink ever faster though they made a
stiff defence fierce exasperation on both sides and disputed every
inch Their position in these scraggy Woods and Villages in these
Morasses and CarpHusbandries is very strong

It had proved to be farther north too than was expected so that the
Prussians had to wheel round a little right wing as a centre fighting
army as radius before they could come parallel and get to work a
delicate manoeuvre which they executed to Valoris admiration here in
the storm of battle tramp tramp velocity increasing from your centre
outwards till at the end of the radius the troops are at treblequick
fairly running forward and the line straight all the while Admirable
to Valori in the hot whirlwind of battle here For the great guns go
in horrid salvos unabated and the crackling thunder of the small guns
terrible tussling about those Carpponds that quaggy Carphusbandry
says the Schoolmaster and the Heavens blotted out in sulphurous
firestreaked smoke What had become of us pacific Some had run in
time and they were the wisest others had squatted who could find a
nook suitable Most of us had gathered into the Nurserygarden at
the foot of our Village we sat quaking thereour prayers grown
tremulously vocalin tears and wail at least the women part Enemies
made reconcilement with each other says he and dear friends took
farewell His Narrative in Lutzow UBI SUPRA One general Alleleu
the Last Day to all appearance having come Friedrich seeing things
in this good posture gallops to the left again where much urgently
requires attention from him

On the Austrian side Prince Karl through his morning sleep at
Hausdorf had heard the cannonading Saxons taking Striegau thinks
he a pleasant lullaby enough and continues to sleep and dream
Agitated messengers rush in at last draw his curtains Prussians
all in rank this side Striegau Water Saxons beaten or nearly so at
Striegau we must stand to arms your HighnessTo arms of course
answers Karl and hurries now what he can to get everything in motion
The bivouac itself had been in order of battle but naturally there is
much to adjust to put in trim and the Austrians are not distinguished
for celerity of movement All the worse for them just now

On Friedrichs side so far as I can gather there have happened two
cross accidents First by that wheeling movement done to Valoris
admiration in the Striegau quarter the Prussian line has hitched itself
up towards Striegau has got curved inward and covers less ground than
was counted on so that there is like to be some gap in the central
part ofas in fact there was in spite of Friedrichs efforts and
hitchings of battalions and squadrons an indisputable gap though it
turned to rich profit for Friedrich Prince Karl paying no attention to
it Upon such indisputable gap a wakeful enemy might have done Friedrich
some perilous freak but Karl was in his bed as we sayin a terrible
flurry too when out of bed Nothing was done upon the gap and
Friedrich had his unexpected profit by it before long

The second accident is almost worse Striegau Bridge of planks as
I feared creaking under such a heavy stream of feet and wheels all
night did at last break in some degree and needed to be mended so
that the rearward regiments who are to form Friedrichs left wing
are in painful retardand are becoming frightfully necessary the
Austrians as yet far outflanking us capable of taking us in flank
with that right wing of theirs The moment was agitating to a
Generalinchief Valori will own this young Kings bearing was perfect
not the least flurry though under such a strain He has aidesdecamp
dashing out everywhither with orders with expedients Prince Henri
his younger Brother galloping the fastest nay at last he begs Valori
himself to gallop with orders to a certain General Gessler in whose
Brigade are Dragoons Which Valori doeshappily without effect on
Gessler who knows no Valori for an aidedecamp and keeps the ground
appointed him rearward of that gap we talked of

Happily the Austrian right wing is in no haste to charge Happily
Ziethen blocked by that incumbrance of the Bridge mending finds a
ford higher up the assiduous Ziethen splashes across other regiments
following forms in line well leftward and instead of waiting for the
Austrian charge charges home upon them fiercely through the difficult
grounds No danger of the Austrians outflanking us now they are
themselves likely to get hard measure on their flank By the ford and
by the Bridge all regiments some of them at treblequick get to their
posts still in time Accident second has passed without damage
Forward then rapid steady and reserve your fire till within fifty
pacesPrinoe Ferdinand of Brunswick Friedrichs Brotherinlaw a
brighteyed steady young man of great heart for fight tramps forth
with his Divisionsteadyall manner of Divisions tramp forth and
the hot storm Ziethen and cavalry dashing upon that right wing of
theirs kindles here also far and wide

The Austrian cavalry on this wing and elsewhere it is clear were
ill off We could not charge the Prussian left wing say they partly
because of the morasses that lay between us and partly which is
remarkable because they rushed across and charged us Austrian
report _HeldenGeschichte_ i 1113 Prince Karl is sorry to report
such things of his cavalry but their behavior was bad and not good
The first shock threw them wavering the secondnothing would persuade
them to dash forth and meet it High officers commanded obtested drew
out pistols Prince Karl himself shot a fugitive or twoit was to no
purpose they wavered worse at every new shock and at length a shock
came sixth it was as the reporter counts which shook them all into
the wind Decidedly shy of the Prussians with their new manoeuvres and
terrible way of coming on as if sure of beating In the Saxon quarter
certain Austrian regiments of horse would not charge at all merely kept
firing from their carbines and when the time came ran

As for the Saxons they have been beaten these two hours that is to
say hopeless these two hours and getting beaten worse and worse The
Saxons cannot stand but neither generally will they run they dispute
every ditch morass and tuft of wood especially every village Wrecks
of the muddy desperate business last hour after hour I gave my men a
little rest under the garden walls says one Saxon Gentleman or they
would have died in the heat and thirst and extreme fatigue I would
have given 100 gulden 10 pounds Sterling for a glass of water
 _HeldenGeschichte_ ubi supra The Prussians push them on bayonet
in back inexorable not to be resisted slit off whole battalions of
them prisoners now and quarter given take all their guns or all
that are not sunk in the quagmiresin fine drive them part into the
Mountains direct part by circuit thither down upon the rear of the
Austrian fight through Hausdorf Seifersdorf and other Mountain gorges
where we hear no more of them and shall say no more of them A sore
stroke for poor old Weissenfels the last public one he has to take in
this world for the poor man died before long Nobodys blame he says
every Saxon man did well only some Austrian horseregiments that we
had among us were too shy Adieu to poor old Weissenfels Luck of war
what elsethereby is he in this pass

And now new Prussian force its Saxons being well abolished is pressing
down upon Prince Karls naked left flank YesPrince Karl too will
have to go His cavalry is for most part shaken into ragged clouds
infantry steady enough men cannot stand everything I have observed
says Friedrich if you step sharply up to an Austrian battalion within
fifty paces or so and pour in your fire well in about a quarter of
an hour you see the ranks beginning to shake and jumble towards
indistinctness _Military Instructions_  a very hopeful symptom to
you

It was at this moment that LieutenantGeneral Gessler under whom is the
Dragoon regiment Baireuth who had kept his place in spite of Valoris
message determined on a thingadvised to it by General Schmettau
younger Schmettau who was near Gessler as we saw stood in the rear
line behind that gap most likely one of several gaps or wide spaces
left too wide as we explained Gessler noticing the jumbly condition
of those Austrian battalions heaped now one upon another in this
partmotions to the Prussian Infantry to make what farther room
is needful then dashes through in two columns self and
the DragoonColonel heading the one French Chasot who is
LieutenantColonel heading the other sabre in hand with
extraordinary impetus and fire into the belly of these jumbly
Austrians and slashes them to rags twenty battalions of them in an
altogether unexampled manner Takes several thousand prisoners and
such a haul of standards kettledrums and insignia of honor as was
never got before at one charge Sixtyseven standards by the tale for

Towards Bolkenhayn the Saxons and he their heavy artillery and baggage

time this is a far other march The mousetrap had been left open and
we rashly went inPrince Karls loss including that of the Saxons

VALORI says with a pious emotion in voice and look My friend God
has helped me wonderfully this day Actually there was a kind of devout
feeling visible in him thinks Valori A singular mixture this
Prince of good qualities and of bad I never know which preponderates
Valori SOEPIUS As is the way with fat Valoris when they come into
such company

Friedrich is blamed by some military men and perhaps himself thought it
questionable that he did not pursue Prince Karl more sharply He says
his troops could not they were worn out with the nights marching and
the days fighting He himself may well be worn out I suppose for the
last fourandtwenty hours he of all the contemporary sons of Adam
has probably been the busiest Let us rest this day rest till tomorrow
morning and be thankful So decisive a defeat writes he to his
Mother hastily misdating 6th June for 4th has not been since

tolerably true and I have made the Princes sign their names to give
the good Mother assurance of her children in these perils of war Seldom
has such a deliverance come to a man




Chapter XICAMP OF CHLUM FRIEDRICH CANNOT ACHIEVE PEACE

Friedrich marched on the morrow likewise to Bolkenhayn which the
enemy have just left our hussars hanging on their rear and bickering
with Nadasti Then again on the morrow Sundaytwelve hours of
continuous rain writes Valori but there is no downpour or distress
or disturbance that will shake these men from their ranks writes
Valori And so it goes on march after march the Austrians ahead
Dumoulin and our hussars infesting their rear which skilfully defended
itself through Landshut down into Bohemia where are new successive
marches the Prussian quarterstaff stuck into the back of defeated
Austria Home with you farther homeand shogging it onwithout
pause for about a fortnight to come And then only with temporary
pause that is to say with intricate manoeuvrings of a month long
which shove it to Konigsgratz its ultimatum beyond which there is no
getting it The stages and successive campings to be found punctually
in the old Books and new can interest only military readers Here is a
small theological thing at Landshut from first hand

JUNE 8th 1745 The Army followed Dumoulins Corps and marched upon
Landshut On arriving in that neighborhood the King was surrounded by
a troop of 2000 Peasantsof Protestant persuasion very evidently
which is much the prevailing thereaboutswho begged permission of
him to massacre the Catholics of these parts and clear the country of
them altogether This animosity arose from the persecutions which the
Protestants had suffered during the Austrian domination when
their churches used to be taken from them and given to the Popish
priestschurches and almost their children such was the anxiety to
make them orthodox The patience of these peasants had run over and
now in the hour of hope they proposed the above sweeping measure The
King was very far from granting them so barbarous a permission He told
them They ought rather to conform to the Scripture precept to bless
those that cursed them and pray for those that despitefully used them
such was the way to gain the Kingdom of Heaven The peasants rolling
dubious eyes for a moment answered His Majesty was right and
desisted from their cruel pretension _OEuvres de Frederic_
ii218On Hohenfriedberg Day says another Witness as far as
the sound of the cannon was heard all round the Protestants fell on
their knees praying for victory to the Prussians In Ranke iii
259 and at Breslau that evening when the Thirteen trumpeting
Postilions came tearing in with the news what an enthusiasm without
limit

Prince Karl has skill in choosing camps and positions his Austrians are
much cowed that is the grievous loss in his late fight So from June
8th when they quit Silesiaby two roads to go more readilyall
through that month and the next Friedrich spread to the due width
duly pricking into the rear of them drives the beaten hosts onward and
onward They do not think of fighting their one thought is to get into
positions where they can have living conveyed to them and cannot be
attacked for the former of which objects the farther homewards they
go it is the better The main pursuit as I gather goes leftward from
Landshut by Friedlandthe Silesian Friedland once Wallensteins
Through rough wild country the southern slope of the Giant Mountains
goes that slow pursuit or the main stream of it where Friedrich
in person is intricate savage regions cut by precipitous rocks and
soaking quagmires shaggy with woods watershed between the Upper Elbe
and Middle Oder Glatz on our leftwith the rain of its mountains
gathering to a Neisse River eastward which we know and on their west
or hither side to a Mietau Adler Aupa and other manybranched feeders
of the Elbe Most complex military ground the manoeuvrings on it
endlesswhich must be left to the readers fancy here

About the end of June Karl and his Austrians find a place suitable to
their objects Konigsgratz a compact little Town in the nook between
the Elbe and Adler covered to west and to south by these two streams
strong enough to east withal and sure and convenient to the southern
roads and victual Against which Friedrichs manoeuvres avail nothing
so that he at last 20th July crosses Elbe River takes he likewise
an inexpugnable Camp on the opposite shore at a Village called Chlum
and lies there making a mutual deadlock of it for six weeks or
more Of the prior Camps with their abundance of strategic shufflings
wheelings pushings all issuing in this of Chlum we say nothing none
of themexcept the immediately preceding one called of Nahorzan
called also of Drewitz for it was in parts a shifting entity and flung
the LIMBS of it about strategically clutching at Konigsgratzhad any
permanency let us take Chlum the longest and essentially the last in
those parts as the general summary of them and alone rememberable by
us Camp of GrossParzitz across the Mietau to dislodge Prince Karl
from his shelter behind that stream June 14th Camp of Nahorzan
June 18th and abstruse manoeuvrings of a month for Konigsgratz 20th
July cross Elbe for Chlum and lie yourself also inexpugnable there
See _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii 120 et seq especially see Orlich
ii pp 193 194 203 c cwith an amplitude of inorganic
details sufficient to astonish the robustest memory

Friedrichs purposes at Chlum or previously are not towards conquests
in Bohemia nor of fighting farther if he can help it But in the mean
while he is eating out these Bohemian vicinages no invasion of Silesia
possible from that quarter soon again That is one benefit and he hopes
always his enemies under screw of military pressure with the one hand
and offer of the olivebranch with the other will be induced to grant
him Peace Britannic Majesty after Fontenoy and Hohenfriedberg not to
mention the first rumors of a Jacobite Rebellion with France to rear of
it is getting eager to have Friedrich settled with and withdrawn from
the game againthe rather as Friedrich knowing his man has ceased
latterly to urge him on the subject Peace with George the Purseholder
does not that mean Peace with all the others Friedrich knows the high
Queens indignation but he little guesses at this time the humor of
Bruhl and the Polish Majesty He has never yet sent the Old Dessauer in
upon them always only keeps him on the slip at Magdeburg still
hoping actualities may not be needed He hopes too in spite of her
indignation the Hungarian Majesty with an Election on hand with the
Netherlands at such a pass not to speak of Italy and the Middle Rhine
will come to moderate views again On which latter points his reckoning
was far from correct Within three months Britannic Majesty and he did
get to explicit Agreement CONVENTION OF HANOVER 26th August but in
regard to the Polish Majesty and the Hungarian there proved to be no
such result attainable and quite other methods necessary first

Of military transactions in this Camp of Chlum or in all these
BohemianSilesian Camps for near four months there is nothing or as
good as nothing Chlum has no events Chlum vigilantly guards itself
and expects as the really decisive to it events that will happen far
away We are to conceive this military business as a deadlock
attended with hussar skirmishes attacks defences of outposts of
provisionwagons from Moravia or SilesiaFriedrich has his food from
Silesia chiefly by several routes convoys come once in the five
days His horseprovender he forages with Tolpatches watching him and
continual scufflings of fight for hay and glory writes one
Prussian Officer I assure you we fight well Endless enterprising
manoeuvring countermanoeuvring there at first was and still is if
either party stir but here in their mutually fixed camps tacit
mutual observances establish themselves and amid the rigorous armed
vigilantes there are traits of human neighborship As usual in such
cases The guardparties do not fire on one another within certain
limits a signal that there are dead to bury or the like is strictly
respected On one such occasion it was June 30th CampofNahorzan
time that Prince Ferdinand of BrunswickPrince Ferdinand with a young
Brother Albert volunteering and learning his business here who are both
Prussianhad a snatch of interview with a third muchloved Brother
Ludwig who is in the Austrian service A Prussian officer venturing
beyond the limits had been shot Ferdinands message Grant us burial
of him found by chance Brother Ludwig in command of that Austrian
outpost who answers Surelyand beg that I may embrace my Brothers
And they rode out those three to the space intermediate talked there
for half an hour till the burial was done Mauvillon _Geschichte
Ferdinands von BraunschweigLuneburg_ i 118 Fancy such an interview
between the poor young fellows the soul of honor each and tied in that
manner

Trenck of the Lifeguard was not quite the soul of honor It was in the
Nahorzan time too that Trenck who had in spite of express order to the
contrary been writing to his Cousin the indigo Pandour was put under
arrest when found out Wrote merely about horses purchase of horses
so help me God protests the blusterous Lifeguardsman loud as lungs
willwhether with truth in them nobody can say Arrest for breaking
orders answers Friedrich doubting or disbelieving the horses and
loud Trenck is packed over the Hills to Glatz to Governor Fouquet or
Substitutewhere by not submitting and repenting by resisting and
rebelling and ever again doing it he makes out for himself with
Fouquet and his other Governors what kind of life we know GARDEZ

JULY 5th19th MIDDLERHINE COUNTRY The first Electionnews that
reaches Friedrich is from the MiddleRhine Country and of very
bad complexion Readers remember Traun and his Bathyanis and his
intentions upon Conti there In the end of May old Traun things being
all completed in Bavaria had got on march with his Bavarian Army
say 40000 to look into Prince Conti down in those parts a fact very
interesting to the Prince Traun held leftward westward as if for the
Neckar ValleyPerhaps intending to be through upon Elsass in those
southern undefended portions of the Rhine Conti and his Segur and
MiddleRhine Army stood diligently on their guard got their forces
defences apparatuses hurried southward from Frankfurt quarter where
they lay on watch into those Neckar regions Which seen to be done
Traun whirled rapidly to rightward to northward crossed the Mayn
at Wertheim wholly leaving the Neckar and its Conti having weighty
business quite in the other directionon the north side of the Mayn
namely on the Kinzig River where Bathyani who has taken DAhrembergs
command below Frankfurt and means to bestir himself in another than the
DAhremberg fashion is to meet him on a set day Traun having thus
by strategic suction pulled the MiddleRhine Army out of his and
Bathyanis way hopes they two will manage a junction on the Kinzig
after junction they will be a little stronger than Conti though
decidedly weaker taken one by one Traun in the long June days had
such a march through the Spessart Forest Mayn River to his left with
our old friends Dettingen Aschaffenburg far down in the plain as
was hardly ever known before pathless wildernesses rocky steeps and
chasms the sweltering June sun sending down the upper snows upon him in
the form of muddy slush so that the infantry had to wade haunchdeep
in many of the hollow parts and nearly all the cavalry lost its
horseshoes A strenuous march and a wellschemed For at the Kinzig
River Conti still far off in the Neckar country Bathyani punctually
appeared on the opposite shore and Traun and he took camp together

knowand rest there calculating that Conti is now a manageable
quantityand comfortably wait till the GrandDuke arrives Adelung

being the Commanders Cloak this season as Karl was lasta right
lucky Cloak he while Traun lurked under him not so lucky since July
13th Franz arrived and Traun under Franz instantly went into Conti
now again in those Frankfurt parts clutched at Conti Briareuslike
in a multiform alarming manner so that Conti lost head took to mere
retreating rushing about burning bridgesand in fine July 19th had
flung himself bodily across the Rhine clouds of Tolpatches sticking to
him and left old Traun and his GrandDuke supreme lord in those parts
Who did NOT invade Elsass as was now expected but lay at Heidelberg
intending to play pacifically a surer card All French are out of
Teutschland again and the game given up In what a premature and
shameful manner thinks Friedrich

Nominally it was the GrandDuke that flung Conti over the Rhine and
delivered Teutschland from its plagues After which fine feat salvatory
to the Cause of Liberty and destructive to French influence what is
to prevent his election to the Kaisership Friedrich complains aloud
Conti has given it up you drafted 15000 from him for imaginary uses
in the Netherlandsyou have given it up then Was that our bargain
We have given it up answers DArgenson the Warminister writing to
Valori butAnd supplies instead of performance according to the
laws of fact eloquent logic very superfluous to Friedrich and the said
lawsValori and the French Minister at Dresden had again been trying
to stir up the Polish Majesty to stand for Kaiser but of course that
enterprise eager as the Polish Majesty might be for such a dignity had
now to collapse and become totally hopeless A new offer of
Friedrichs to cooperate had been refused by Bruhl with a brevity a
decisivenessThinks me finished AUX ABOIS says Friedrich and not
worth giving terms to on surrendering The foolish little creature
insolent in the wrong quarter  _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii 128

The German Burden thenwhich surely was mutual at lowest and
lately was French altogetherthe French have thrown it off the French
have dropped their end of the BEARINGPOLES so to speak and left
Friedrich by himself to stand or stagger under the beweltered broken
harnessgear and intolerable weight That is ones payment for cutting
the rope from their neck last yearLong since while the present
Campaign was being prepared for under such financial pressures
Friedrich had bethought him The French might at least give me money
if they can nothing elseand he had one day penned a Letter with that
object but had thrown it into his desk again No not till the very
last extremity that Friedrich did at last despatch the unpleasant
missive Service done you in Elsass let us say little of it but the
repayment has been zero hitherto your Bavarian expenses poor Kaiser
gone and Peace of Fussen come are now endedA round sum say of
600000 pounds is becoming indispensable here if we are to keep on
our feet at all Herr Ranke who has seen the Most Christian Kings
response though in a capricious way finds three or four successive
redactions of the difficult passage all painfully meaning
Impossible alaspainfully adding We will try however And
after due cunctations Friedrich waiting silent the whileLouis Most
Christian King who had failed in so many things towards Friedrich does
empower Valori To offer him a subsidy of 600000 livres a month till we
see farther Twenty thousand pounds a month he hopes this will suffice
being himself run terribly low Friedrichs feeling is to be guessed

MON GROS VALORI who could not himself help all this poor soul falls
now into complete disgrace waits daily upon Friedrich at the giving
out of the parole but frequently his Majesty does not speak to me at
all Hardly looks at me or only looks as if I had suddenly become Zero
Incarnate It is now in these days I suppose that Friedrich writes
about the Scamander Battle of Fontenoy and Capture of Pekin by
way of helping one to fight the Austrians according to Treaty And has
a touch of bitter sarcasm in uttering his complaints against such
treatmentthe heart of him I suppose bitter enough Most Christian
King has felt this of the Scamander Friedrich perceives Louiss next
letter testifies piqueand of course we are farther from help on
that side than ever From the STANDE of the KurMark Brandenburg

CAMP OF DIESKAU BRITANNIC MAJESTY MAKES PEACE FOR HIMSELF WITH
FRIEDRICH BUT CANNOT FOR AUSTRIA OR SAXONY

About the middle of August there are certain Saxon phenomena which
awaken dread expectation in the world Friedrich watching Arguslike
near and far in his Chlum observatory has noticed that Prince Karl
is getting reinforced in Konigsgratz 10000 lately 7000 more
comingand contrariwise that the Saxons seem to be straggling off from
him ebbing away corps after corpstowards Saxony can it be There
are whispers of Bavarian auxiliaries being hired for them too And
little Bruhls late insolence Bruhls evident belief that we are
finished AUX ABOIS Putting all this together Friedrich judgeswith
an indignation very naturalthat there is again some insidious Saxon
mischief most likely an attack on Brandenburg in the wind Friedrich
orders the Old Dessauer March into them delay no longer and
publishes a clangorously indignant Manifesto evidently his own writing
and coming from the heart In Adelung v 6471 no date middle of
August say the Books How they have not bound by their Austrian
Treaty wantonly invaded our Silesia have since and before in spite
of our forbearance done so many thingsand in fact have finally
exhausted our patience and are forcing us to seek redress and safety by
the natural methods which they will see how they like

Old Leopold advances straightway as bidden direct for the Saxon
frontier To whom Friedrich shoots off detachmentsPrince Dietrich
with so many thousands to reinforce Papa then General Gessler with
so manytill Papa is 30000 odd and could eat Saxony at a mouthful
nothing whatever being yet ready there on Bruhls part though he has
such immense things in the windNevertheless Friedrich again paused
did not yet strike The Saxon question has Russian bugbears no end of
complications His Britannic Majesty now at Hanover and his prudent
Harrington with him are in the act of laboring with all earnestness
for a general Agreement with Friedrich Without farther bitterness
embroilment and bloodshed how much preferable for Friedrich Old
Dessauer therefore pauses Camp of Dieskau which we have often
heard of close on the Saxon Border stands there looking over as with
sword drawn 30000 good swordsbut no stroke not for almost three
months more In three months wretched Bruhl had not repented but on
the contrary had completed his preparations and gone to workand the
stroke did fall as will be seen That is Bruhls posture in the matter
Ranke iii 231 314

To Britannic George for a good while past it has been manifest that
the Pragmatic Sanction in its original form is an extinct object that
reconquest of Silesia and such like is melancholy moonshine and that
in fact towards fighting the French with effect it is highly necessary
to make peace with Friedrich of Prussia again This once more is
Georges and his Harringtons fixed view Friedrichs own wishes are
known or used to be ever since the late Kaisers deaththough
latterly he has fallen silent and even avoids the topic when offered
knowing his man Herrington has to apply formally to Friedrichs
Minister at Hanover Very well if they are in earnest this time so
Friedrich instructs his Minister My terms are known to you no change
admissible in the termsdo not speak with me on it farther and
observe within four weeks the thing finished or else broken off
Ranke iii 277281 And in this sense they are laboring incessantly
with Austria with Saxonywithout the least successand Excellency
Robinson has again a panting uncomfortable time Here is a scene
Robinson transacts at Vienna which gives us a curious facetoface
glimpse of her Hungarian Majesty while Friedrich is in his Camp at
Chlum




SCHONBRUNN 2d AUGUST 1745 ROBINSON HAS AUDIENCE OF HER HUNGARIAN
MAJESTY

Robinson in a copious sonorous speech rather apt to be copious and to
fall into the Parliamentary CANTOFERMO sets forth how extremely
ill we Allies are faring on the French hand nothing done upon Silesia
either a hopeless matter thatis it not your Majesty And your
Majestys forces all lying there in mere deadlock and we in such need
of them Peace with Prussia is indispensableTo which her Majesty
listened in statuesque silence mostly never saw her so reserved
before my Lord

ROBINSON Madam the Dutch will be obliged to accept Neutrality
and plump down again after such hoisting

QUEEN Well and if they did they It would be easier to accommodate
with France itself and so finish the whole matter than with Prussia
My Army could not get to the Netherlands this season No General of
mine would undertake conducting it at this day of the year Peace with
Prussia what good could it do at present

ROBINSON England has already found for subsidies this year
1178753 pounds Cannot go on at that rate Peace with Prussia is one
of the returns the English Nation expects for all it has done

QUEEN I must have Silesia again without Silesia the Kaiserhood were
an empty title Or would you have us administer it under the guardiancy
of Prussia

ROBINSON In Bohemia itself things dont look well nothing done on
Friedrich your Saxons seem to be qnarrelling with you and going home

QUEEN Prince Karl is himself capable of fighting the Prussians again
Till that do not speak to me of Peace Grant me only till October

ROBINSON Prussia will help the GrandDuke to Kaisership

QUEEN The GrandDuke is not so ambitions of an empty honor as to
engage in it under the tutelage of Prussia Consider farther the
Imperial dignity is it compatible with the fatal deprivation of
Silesia One other battle I say Good God give me only till the month
of October

ROBINSON A battle Madam if won wont reconquer Silesia if lost
your Majesty is ruined at home

QUEEN DUSSEJE CONCLURE AVEC LUI LE LENDEMAIN JE LUI LIVRERAIS
BATAILLE CE SOIR Had I to agree with him tomorrow I would try him in
a battle this evening Robinsons Despatch 4th August 1745 Ranke
iii 287 Raumer pp 161 162

Her Majesty is not to be hindered deaf to Robinson to her Britannic
George who pays the money Cruel man is that what you call keeping the
Pragmatic Sanction dismembering me of Province after Province now in
Germany then in Italy on pretext of necessity Has not England money
then Does not England love the Cause of Liberty Give me till October
Her Majesty did take till October and later as we shall see poor
George not able to hinder by power of the purse or otherwise who can
hinder high females or low when they get into their humors Much of
this Austrian obstinacy think impartial persons was of female nature
We shall see what profit her Majesty made by taking till October

As for George the time being run and her Majesty and Saxony
unpersuadable he determined to accept Friedrichs terms himself in
hope of gradually bringing the others to do it August 26th at Hanover
there is signed a CONVENTION OF HANOVER between Friedrich and him
Peace on the old BreslauBerlin termsprecisely the same terms but
Britannic Majesty to have them guaranteed by All the Powers on the
General Peace comingso that there be no snakeprocedure henceforth
Silesia Friedrichs without fail dear Hanover unmolested even by a
thought of Friedrichsand her Hungarian Majesty to be invited nay
urged by every feasible method to accede Adelung v 75 is in
Rousset xix 441 in c c Which done Britannic Majestyfor
there has hung itself out in the Scotch Highlands the other day
Glenfinlas August 12th a certain Standard TANDEM TRIUMPHANS and
unpleasant things are imminenthurries home at his best pace and has
his hands full there for some time On Austria on Saxony he could
not prevail By no manner of means answered they and went their own
roadjingling his Britannic subsidies in their pocket regardless of
the once Supreme Jove who is sunk now to a very different figure on the
German boards

Friedrichs outlook is very bad such a War to go on and not even
finance to do it with His intimates his Rothenburg one time have
found him sunk in gloomy thought But he wears a bright face usually
No wavering or doubting in him his mind made up which is a great help
that way Friedrich indicates and has indicated everywhere for many
months that Peace precisely on the old footing is all he wants The
Kaiser being dead whom I took up arms to defend what farther object is
there says he Renounce Silesia more honestly than last time engage
to have it guaranteed by everybody at the General Peace or perhaps
Hohenfriedberg will help to guarantee itand I march home My money
is running down privately thinks he guarantee Silesia and I shall
be glad to go If not I must raise money somehow melt the big silver
balustrades at Berlin borrow from the STANDE or do something and in
fact must stand here unless Silesia is guaranteed and struggle till I
die

That latter withal is still privately Friedrichs thought Under his
light air he carries unspoken that grimly clear determination at all
times now and henceforth and it is an immense help to the guidance
of him An indispensable indeed No king or man attempting anything
considerable in this world need expect to achieve it except tacitly
on those same terms I will achieve it or die For the world in spite
of rumors to the contrary is always much of a bedlam to the sanity
so far as he may have any of every individual man A strict place
moreover its very bedlamisms flowing by law as do alike the sudden
muddeluges and the steady Atlantic tides and all things whatsoever a
world inexorable truly as gravitation itselfand it will behoove
you to front it in a similar humor as the tacit basis for whatever wise
plans you lay In Friedrich from the first entrance of him on the stage
of things we have had to recognize this prime quality in a fine tacit
form to a complete degree and till his last exit we shall never find
it wanting Tacit enough unconscious almost not given to articulate
itself at alland if there be less of piety than we could wish in the
silence of it there is at least no playactor mendacity or cant of
devoutness to poison the high worth of it No braver little figure
stands on the Earth at that epoch Ready at the due season with
his mind silently made upable to answer diplomatic Robinsons
Bartensteins and the very Destinies when they apply If you will
withdraw your snakish notions will guarantee Silesia will give him
back his old Treaty of Berlin in an irrefragable shape he will march
home if not he will never march home but be carried thither dead
rather That is his intention if the gods permit

of Kaiserhood without even money to feed itself not to speak of
governing of defending and coercing upon such entities the blessings
of man avail little the gods having warned them to go do not bless
them for stayingHowever tarbarrels burn the fountains play wine
in some of them I hope Franz is to be crowned in a fortnight hence
with extraordinary magnificence At this last part of it Maria Theresa
will in her own high person attend and proceeds accordingly towards
Frankfurt in the end of September say the old Books so soon as the
Election is over

Hungarian Majestys bearing was not popular there according to
Friedrichwho always admires her after a sort and always speaks of
her like a king and gentlemanbut the High Lady it is intimated felt
somewhat too well that she was high Not sorry to have it known under
the due veils that her KaiserHusband is but of a mimetic nature that
it is she who has the real power and that indeed she is in a victorious
posture at present Very high in her carriage towards the Princes of the
Reich and their privilegespoor KurPfalzs notary or herald coming
to protest I think it was the second time about something she quite
disregarded his tabards pasteboards or whatever they were and clapt
him in prison The thing was commented upon but KurPfalz got no
redress Need we repeatlazy readers having so often met him and
forgotten him againthis is a new younger KurPfalz Karl Theodor
this one not Friedrich Wilhelms old Friend but his Successor of the
Sulzbach line of whom after thirty years or so we may again hear He
can complain about his violated tabard will get his notary out of jail
again but no redress

Highish even towards her friends this EmpressQueen
KAISERINKONIGIN such her new title and has a kind of
ThankyouforNothing air towards them Prussian Majesty she said
had unquestionable talents but oh what a character Too much levity
she said by far heterodox too in the extreme a BOSER MANNand what
a neighbor has he been As to Silesia she was heard to say she
would as soon part with her petticoat as part with it _OEuvres de
Frederic_ iii 126 128So that there is not the least prospect of
peace here None answer Friedrichs emissaries whom he had empowered
to hint the thing Which is heavy news to Friedrich

Early in August not long after that Audience of Robinsons her
Majesty after repeated written messages to Prince Karl urging him to
go into fight again or attempt something had sent two high messengers
Prince Lobkowitz Duke dAhremberg high dignitaries from Court have
come to Konigsgratz with the latest urgencies the newest ideas and
would fain help Prince Karl to attempt something Daily they used to
come out upon a little height in view of Friedrichs tent and gaze in
upon him and round all Nature with big tubes he says as if
they had been astronomers but never attempted anything We remember
DAhremberg and what part he has played from the Dettingen times and
onward A debauched old fellow says Friedrich gone all to hebetude
by his labors in that line agrees always with the last speaker Prince
Karl seems to have little stomach himself and does not see his way into
or across another Battle Lobkowitz again is always saying Try
something We are now stronger than they by their detachings by our
reinforcings indeed about twice their number regular and irregular
though most of the Saxons are gone home After much gazing through
their tubes the Austrians August 23d do make a small shift of place
insignificant otherwise the Prussians next day do the like in
consequence quit Chlum burning their huts post themselves a little
farther up the Elbetheir left at a place called Jaromirz embouchure
of the Aupa into Elbe  _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii 129and are
again unattackable

The worst fact is the multitude of Pandours more and more infesting our
provisionroads and that horseforage itself is at last running
low Detachments lie all duly round to right and left to secure our
communications with Silesia especially to left out of Glatz where
runs one of the chief roads we have But the service is becoming daily
more difficult For example

NEUSTADT 8th SEPTEMBER In that lefthand quarter coming out of
Glatz at a little Bohemian Town called Neustadt the Prussian Commander
Tauenzien by name was repeatedly assaulted and from September 8th had
to stand actual siege gallantly repulsing a full 10000 with their big
artillery though his walls were all breached for about a week till
Friedrich sent him relief Prince Lobkowitz our old antiBelleisle
friend who is always of forward fiery humor had set them on this
enterprise which has turned out fruitless The King is much satisfied
with Tauenzien Ib 132 of whom we shall hear again Who indeed
becomes notable to us were it only for getting one Lessing as
secretary by and by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing whose fame has since
gone into all countries the man having been appointed a Secretary
to the very Destinies in some sort that is to say a Writer of Books
which have turned out to have truth in them Tauenzien a grimmish
aquiline kind of man of no superfluous words has distinguished himself
for the present by defending Neustadt which the Austrians fully counted
to get hold of

Let us give another little scene preparatory to quitting this Country
as it is evident the King and we will soon have to do Country being
quite eaten out Pandours getting ever rifer and the Season done

JAROMIRZ EARLY IN SEPTEMBER 1745 Jaromirz is a little Bohemian
Town on the Aupa or between the Aupa and Metau branches of the Upper
Elbe four or five miles north of Semonitz where Friedrichs quarter
now is Valori so seldom spoken to is lodged in a suburb there Had
not you better go into the town itself his Majesty did once say but
Valori dreading nothing lodged onLandlord a Burgher whom I thought
respectable Respectable yes he but his son had been dealing with
Franquini the Pandour and had sold Valorinight appointed measures
all taken a miracle if Valori escape Franquini chief of 30000
Pandours has come in person to superintend this important capture and
lies hidden with a strong party in the woods to rearward Prussians
about 200 scattered in posts occupy the hedges in front for guard of
the ovens to rear Jaromirz being wholly ours there is no suspicion

In the dead of the night Franquini emerges from the woods sends
forward a party of sixty under the young Judas who by methods
suitable gets them stealthily conducted into Papas Barn which looks
across a courtyard into Valoris very windows From the Barn it is easy
on paws of velvet to get into the House if you have a Judas to open
it Which you havebolts all drawn for you and even beams ready for
barricading if you be meddled with Upstairs is his Excellency asleep
Excellencys room isto right do you remember or to leftPshaw we
shall find it The Pandours mount find a bedroom break it opensome
fifteen or sixteen of them and one who knows a little Frenchcome
crowding forward to the horror and terror of the poor inhabitant QUE
VOULEZVOUS DONC His Excellency Valori Well no violence I am
your prisoner let me dress answers the supposed Excellencyand
contrives to secrete portfolios and tear or make away with papers
And is marched off under a select guard who leave the rest to do the
pillage And was not Valori at all was Valoris Secretary one DArget
who had called himself Valori on this dangerous occasion Valori sat
quaking behind his partition not till the Pandours began plundering the
stables did the Prussian sentry catch sound of them and plunge in

Friedrich had his amusement out of this adventure liked DArget
the clever Secretary got DArget to himself before long as will be
seenand in quieter times dashed off a considerable Explosion of

Chapter XIIBATTLE OF SOHR

The famed beautiful Elbe River rises in romantic chasms terrible to the
picturesque beholder at the roots of the Riesengebirge overlooked
by the HoheKamms and highest summits of that chain Out of eleven
wells says gentle Dulness EILF or ELF QUELLEN whence its name Elbe
for ELF Sure enough it starts out of various wells Description in
Zollner _Briefe uber Schlesien_ ii 305 in c c rushes out like
a great peacocks or pashas tail from the roots of the Giant Mountains
thereabouts and hurries southwardor even rather eastward at first
for except the Iser to westward which does not fall in for a great
while its chief branches come from the eastern side Aupa Metau
Adler the drainings of Glatz and of that rugged Country where
Friedrich has been camping and manoeuvring all summer On the whole
its course is southward for the first seventy or eighty miles washing
Jaromirz Konigshof Konigsgratz down to Pardubitz at Pardubitz it
turns abruptly westward and holds on so bending even northward by
hill and plain through the rest of its five or six hundred miles

Its first considerable branch on that eastern or left bank is the
Aupa which rises in the Pass of Schatzlar great struggling there for
convoys just now goes next by Trautenau which has lately been burnt
and joins the Elbe at Jaromirz where Valori was stolen or nearly so
from under the Prussian left wing The Aupa runs nearly straight south
the Elbe till meeting it has run rather southeast but after joining
they go south together augmented by the Metau by the Adler down to
Pardubitz where the final turn to west occurs Jaromirz which lies in
the very angle of Elbe and Aupa is the left wing of Friedrichs Camp
main body of the Camp lies on the other side of the Elbe but of course
has bridges as at Smirzitz where that straw sentry did his pranks
lately bridges are indispensable part of our provision coming always
by that BOHEMIAN Neustadt from the northeast quarter out of Silesia
though the main course of our meal and much fighting for it is direct
from the north by the Pass of SchatzlarChaslard as poor Valori
calls it

Thus Friedrich lay when Valori escaped being stolen when Tauenzien
was assailed by the 10000 Pandours with siege artillery and stood
inexpugnable in the breach till Friedrich relieved him Those Pandours
had cut away his water for the last two days so that except
for speedy relief all valor had been in vain Water being gone not
recoverable without difficulties Neustadt was abandoned September
16th as I guessone of our main Silesian roads for meal has ceased
We have now only Schatzlar to depend on where Franquinilying westward
among the glens of the Upper Elbe and possessed of abundant talent in
the Tolpatch way witness Valoris narrow miss latelygives us trouble
enough Friedrich determines to move towards Schatzlar Homewards in
fact eating the Country well as he goes

Saturday 18th September Friedrich crosses the Elbe at Jaromirz
Entirely unopposed the Austrians were all busy firing FEUDEJOIE
for the Election of their GrandDuke Election done five days ago at
Frankfurt and the news just come So they crackle about and deliver
rolling fire at a great rate proud to be IMPERIAL Army henceforth
as if that could do much for them There was also vast dining for
three days among the high heads and a great deal of wine spent That
probably would have been the chance to undertake something upon them
better than crossing the Elbe says Friedrich looking back But he did
not think of it in time took secondbest in place of best

He is now therefore over into that Triangular piece of Country between
Elbe and Aupa if readers will consult their Map in that triangle
his subsequent notable operations all lie He here proposes to move
northward by degreesthrough Trautenau Schatzlar and home well
eating this bit of Country too the last uneaten bit as he goes This
well eaten there will be no harbor anywhere for Invasion through the
Winter coming One of my old Notes says of it in the topographic point
of view

It is a triangular patch of Country which has lain asleep since the
Creation of the World traversed only by Boii BOIHEIMERS Bohemians
Czechs and other such populations in Human History but which Friedrich
has been fated to make rather notable to the Moderns henceforth Let me
recommend it to the picturesque tourist especially to the military
one Lovers of rocky precipices quagmires brawling torrents and the
unadulterated ruggedness of Nature will find scope there and it was
the scene of a distinguished passage of arms with notable display of
human dexterity and swift presence of mind For the rest one of the
wildest and perhaps except to the picturesque tourist most unpleasant
regions in the world Wild stony upland topmost Upland we may say
of Europe in general or portion of such Upland for the rainstorms
hereabouts run several roadsinto the German Ocean and Atlantic by the
Elbe into the Baltic by the Oder into the Black Sea by the Donauand
it is the waste Outfield whither you rise by long weeksjourneys from
many sides

Much of it towards the angle of Elbe and Aupa is occupied by a huge
waste Wood called Kingdom Forest KONIGREICH SYLVA or WALD peculium
of Old Czech Majesties I fancy may be sixty square miles in area the
longer side of which lies along the Elbe A Country of rocky defiles
lowish hills chaotically shoved together not wanting their brooks and
quagmires straight labyrinthic passages shaggy with wild wood Some
poor Hamlets here and there probably the sleepiest in Nature are
scattered about there may be patches ploughable for rye modern Tourist
says snappishly There are many such whole region now drained reminded
me of Yorkshire Highlands with the Western Sun gilding it that fine
afternoonploughable for rye buckwheat boggy grass to be gathered
in summer charcoaling to do pigs at least are presumable among
these straggling outposts of humanity in their obscure Hamlets poor
ploughing moiling creatures they little thought of becoming notable so
soon None of the Books all intent on mere soldiering take the least
notice of them not at the pains to spell their Hamlets right no
more notice than if they also had been stocks and mossgrown stones
Nevertheless there they did evidently live for thousands of years
past in a dim mannerand are much terrified to have become the seat
of war all on a sudden Their poor Hamlets Sohr Staudentz Prausnitz
Burgersdorf and others still send up a faint smoke and have in them
languidly the livecoal of mysterious human existence in those
woodsto judge by the last maps that have come out A thing worth
considering by the passing tourist military or other

It is in this Kingdom Forest which he calls ROYAUME DE SILVA instead
of SYLVA DE ROYAUME that Friedrich now marches keeping the body of the
Forest well on his left and skirting the southern and eastern sides
of it Rough marching for his Majesty painfully infested by Nadastian
Tolpatches who run out on him from ambushes and need to be scourged
one ambush in particular at a place called Liebenthal second days
march and near the end of itwhere our Prussian Hussars winding
like fiery dragons on the dangerous precipices gave them better than
they brought and completely quenched their appetite for that day After
Liebenthal the march soon ends three miles farther on at the dim
woldhamlet of Staudentz here a camp is pitched here till the Country
is well eaten out or till something else occur we propose to tarry for
a time

Horseforage abounds here but there is no getting of it without
disturbance from those dogs you must fight for every truss of grass
if a mealtrain is coming as there does every five days you have
to detach 8000 foot and 3000 horse to help it safe in A fretting
fatiguing time for regular troops Our bakery is at Trautenauwhere
Valori is now lodging The Tolpatchery unable to take Trautenau set
fire to it though it is their own town their own Queens town thatchy
Trautenau wooden too in the upper stories of it takes greedily to
the fire goes all aloft in flame and then lies black A scandalous
transaction thinks Friedrich The Prussian corn lay nearly all in
cellars little got even of the Prussians by such an atrocity and
your own poor fellowsubjects where are they Valori was burnt out
here again exploded from his quarters poor manseems to have thought
it a mere fire in his own lodging and that he was an unfortunate
diplomatist Happily he got notice PRIVATISSIME for no officer dare
whisper in such cases that there is an armed party setting out for
Silesia to guard meal that is coming Valori yokes himself to this
armed party and gets safe over the Hills with itthen swift by extra
post to Breslau and to civilized partially civilized accommodation
for a little rest after these hustlings and tossings

Friedrich had lain at Staudentz in this manner bickering continually
for his forage and eating the Country for about ten days and now
as the latter process is well on and the season drawing to a close
he determines on a shift northward Thursday 30th September next let
there be one other grand forage the final one in this eaten tract then
northward to fresh grounds That it appears was the design But
on Wednesday there came in an Austrian deserter who informs us that
Prince Karl is not now in Konigsgratz but in motion up the Elbe
already some fifty miles up past Jaromirz his rear at Konigshof his
van at Arnauon a level with burnt Trautenau and farther north than
we ourselves are This is important news Intending to block us out
from Schatzlar Hmh Single scouts or small parties cannot live in
this Kingdom Wood swarming with Pandours Friedrich sends out a Colonel
Katzler with 500 light horse to investigate a little Katzler
pushes forward on such lane or forest roadtrack as there is towards
Konigshof beats back small hussar partiescomes in about an hours
space not upon hussars merely but upon dense masses of heavy horse
winding through the forest lanes and with that imperfect intelligence
is obliged to return The deserter spake truth apparently and that
is all we can know Forage scheme is given up the order is Baggage
packed and MARCH tomorrow morning at ten Long before ten there
had great things befallen on the morrowTry to understand this Note a
little

The Camp of Staudentzwhich two persons the King and General Stille
a more careful reporter who also was an eyewitness have done their
best to describewill after all efforts and an Ordnance Map to help
remain considerably unintelligible to the reader as is too usual
in such cases A block of highlying ground Friedrichs Camp on it
perhaps two miles long looks to the south small Village of Staudentz
in front hollow beyond that and second small Village Deutsch
Prausnitz hanging on the opposite slope with shaggy heights beyond
and the Kingdom Forest there beginning on the left defiles brooks
and strait country leading towards the small town of Eypel that is our
left and front aspect a hollow well isolating us on those sides Hollow
continues all along the front hollow definite on our side of it and
forming a tolerable defencethough again I perceive to rightward at
no great distance there rise High Grounds which considerably overhang
us A thing to be marked These we could not occupy for want of men
but only maintain vedettes upon them Over these Heights a mile or
two westward of this hollow of ours runs the big winding hollow called
Georgengrund GEORGES BOTTOM which winds up and down in that Kingdom
Forest and offers a road from Konigshof to Trautenau among other
courses it takes

From the crown of those Heights on our right flank here looking to
the west you might discern perhaps three miles off from one of
the sheltering nooks in the hither side of that Georgengrund rising
faintly visible over knolls and dingles the smoke of a little Forest
Village That Village is Sohr notable ever since beyond others in
the Kingdom Wood Sohr like the other Villages has its laneroads its
road to Trautenau to Konigshof no doubt but much nearer you on our
eastern slope of the Heights and far hitherward of Sohr which is on
the western goes the great road what is now the great road from
Konigshof to Trautenau well visible from Friedrichs Camp though still
at some distance from it Could these Heights between us and Sohr which
lie beyond the great road be occupied we were well secured isolated
on the right too as on the other sides from Kingdom Forest and its
ambushes Should have been done admits Friedrich but then as
it is there are not troops enough with 18000 men you cannot do
everything

Here however is the important point In Sohr this night 29th
September in a most private manner the Austrians 30000 of them and
more have come gliding through the woods without even their pipe lit
and with thick veil of hussars ahead Outposts of theirs lie squatted in
the bushes behind Deutsch Prausnitz hardly 500 yards from Friedrichs
Camp And eastward leftward of him in the defiles about Eypel lie
Nadasti and Ruffian Trenck with ten or twelve thousand who are to take
him in rear His Camp of Staudentz will be at a fine pass tomorrow
morning The Austrian Gentlemen had found last week a certain bare
Height in the Forest Height still known from which they could use
their astronomer tubes day after day Orlich ii 225 and now they
are about attempting something

Thursday morning very early 30th September 1745 Friedrich was in his
tent busy with generals and marchrouteswhen a rapid orderly comes
in from that Vedette or strong Piquet on the Heights to our right
Austrians visibly moving in quantity near by and before he has done
answering the officer himself arrives Regular Cavalry in great force
long dustcloud in Kingdom Forest in the gray dawn and so far as we
can judge it is their Army coming on Here is news for a poor man in
the raw of a September morning by way of breakfast to him To arms
is of course Friedrichs instant order and he himself gallops to the
Piquet on the Heights glass in hand Austrian Army sure enough
thirty to thirtyfive thousand of them we only eighteen _OEuvres
de Frederic_ iii 139 Coming to take us on the right flank here
to attack our Camp by surprise will crush us northward through the
defiles and trample us down in detail Hmh To run for it will never
do We must fight for it and even attack THEM as our way is though on
such terms Quick a plan The head of Friedrich is a bank you cannot
easily break by coming on it for plans such a creature for impromptu
plans and unexpected dashes swift as the panthers I have hardly
knownespecially when you squeeze him into a corner and fancy he is
over with it Friedrich gallops down with his plan clear enough and
already the Austrians horse and foot are deploying upon those Heights
he has quitted Fifty Squadrons of Horse for left wing to them and
a battery of Twentyeight big Guns is establishing itself where
Friedrichs Piquet lately stood

Friedrichs right flank has to become his front and face those
formidable Austrian Heights and Batteries and this with more than
Prussian velocity and under the play of those twentyeight big guns
throwing caseshot GRENADES ROYALES and so forth all the while
To Valori when he heard of the thing it is inconceivable how mortal
troops could accomplish such a movement Friedrich himself praises
it as a thing honorably well done Took about half an hour caseshot
raining all the while soldier honorably neverminding no flurry
though a speed like that of spinningtops And here we at length are
Staudentz now to rear of us behind our centre a good space Burgersdorf
in front of us to right our left reaching to Prausnitz Austrian lines
three deep of them on the opposite Height we one line only which
matches them in length

They that left wing of horse should have thundered down on us
attacking us not waiting our attack thinks Friedrich but they
have not done it They stand on their height there will perhaps fire
carbines as their wont is You Buddenbrock go into them with your
Cuirassiers Buddenbrock and the Cuirassiers though it is uphill
go into them at a furious rate meet no countercharge mere sputter of
carbinestumble them to mad wreck back upon their second line back
upon their third absurdly crowded there on their narrow height no room
to manoeuvre so that they plunge fifty squadrons of them wholly into
the Georgengrund rearward into the Kingdom Wood and never come on
again at all Buddenbrock has done his job right well

Seeing which our Infantry of the right wing which stood next to
Buddenbrock made impetuous charge uphill emulous to capture that
Battery of Twentyeight but found it for some time a terrible
attempt These Heights are not to be called hills still less
mountains as in some careless Books but it is a stiff climb at
doublequick with twentyeight big guns playing in the face of you
Storms of caseshot shear away this Infantry are quenching its noble
fury in despair Infantry visibly recoiling when our sole Three
Regiments of Reserve hurry up to support Round these all rallies
rushes desperately on and takes the Batteryof course sending the
Austrian left wing rapidly adrift on loss of the same

This I consider is the crisis of the Fight the back of the Austrian
enterprise is already broken by this sad winging of it on the left But
it resists still comes down againthe reserve of their left wing
seen rapidly making for Burgersdorf intending an attack there which we
oppose with vigor setting Burgersdorf on fire for temporary screen and
drive the Austrian reserve rapidly to rearward again But there is rally
after rally of them They rank again on every new height and dispute
there loath to be driven into Kingdom Wood after such a flourish of
arms One height bushy steep height the lightlimbed valiant Prince
little Ferdinand of Brunswick had the charge of attacking and he did
it with his usual impetus and irresistibilityand strangely enough
the defender of it chanced to be that Brother of his Prince Ludwig
with whom he had the little Interview lately Prince Ludwig got a wound
as well as lost his height The third Brother poor Prince Albrecht
who is also here as volunteer apprentice on the Prussian side gets
killed There will never be another Interview for all three between
the Camps Strange times for those poor Princes who have to seek
soldiering for their existence

Meanwhile the Cavalry of Buddenbrock that is to say of the right wing
having now no work in that quarter is despatched to reinforce the left
wing which has stood hitherto apart on its own ground not attacked or
attackinga left wing REFUSED as the soldiers style it Reinforced by
Buddenbrock this left wing of horse does now also storm forwardnear
the Village of Prausnitz Prausnitz a little way to rear of it
thereabouts is the scene of its feat Feat done in such fashion that
the Austrians opposite will not stand the charge at all but gurgle
about in a chaotic manner then gallop fairly into Kingdom Wood without
stroke struck and disappear as their fellows had done Whereupon
the Prussian horse breaks in upon the adjoining Infantry of that flank
Austrian right flank left bare in this manner champs it also into
chaotic whirlpools cuts away an outskirt of near 2000 prisoners
and sets the rest running This seems to have been pretty much the
COUPDEGRACE of the Fight and to have brought the Austrian dispute to
finis From the first they had rallied on the heights had struggled
and disputed Two general rallies they made and various partial but
none had any success They were driven on bayonet in back as the
phrase is with this sad slap on their right added to that old one on
their left what can they now do but ebb rapidly pour in cataracts
into Kingdom Wood and disappear there  _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii

Prince Karls scheme was good says Friedrich but it was ill executed
He never should have let us form his first grand fault was that he
waited to be attacked instead of attacking Parts of his scheme were
never executed at all Duke dAhremberg for instance it is said had
so dim a notion of the ground that he drew up some miles off with
his back to the Prussians Such is the rumorperhaps only a rumor
in mockery of the hebetated old gentleman fallen unlucky On the
other hand that Nadasti made a failure which proved important is
indubitable Nadasti with some thousands of Tolpatchery was at
Liebenthal four miles to southeast of the action Ruffian Trenck lay
behind Eypel perhaps as far to east of it Trenck and Nadasti were to
rendezvous to unite and attack the Prussian Camp on its rearCamp
so ran the order for it was understood the Prussians would all be
there we others attacking it in front and both flankswhich turned
out otherwise not for Nadasti alone

Nadasti came to his rendezvous in time Ruffian Trenck did not
Nadasti grew tired of waiting for Trenck and attacked the Camp by
himselfCamp but not any men Camp being now empty and the men all
fighting ranked at right angles to it furlongs and miles away Nadasti
made a rare hand of the Camp plundered everything took all the Kings
Campfurniture ready money favorite dog Bichelikewise poor
Eichel his Secretary who however tore the papers first Tolpatchery
exultingly gutted the Camp and at last set fire to itburnt even some
eight or ten poor Prussian sick and also some women whom they caught
We found the limbs of these poor men and women lying about reports
old General Lehwald who knew about it A doggery well worthy of the
gallows think Lehwald and I Could nt help it ferocity of wild men
says Nadasti Well but why not attack then with your ferocity
Confused Courtmartial put these questions at Vienna subsequently and
Ruffian Trenck some say got injustice Nadasti shuffling things upon
him for which one cares almost nothing Lehwald lying at Trautenau
had heard the firing at sunrise and instantly marched to help he only
arrived to give Nadasti a slash or two and was too late for the Fight
One Schlichtling on guard with a weak party saved what was in the
right wing of the Campsmall thanks to him the Main Fight being so
near Friedrichs opinion is an Officer in Schlichtlings place ought
to have done more and not have been so helpless

This was the Battle of Sohr so called because the Austrians had begun
there and the Prussians ended there The Prussian pursuit drew bridle
at that Village unsafe to prosecute Austrians farther now in the deeps
of Kingdom Forest The Battle has lasted five hours It must be now
getting towards noon and time for breakfast if indeed any were to be
had but that is next to impossible Nadasti having been so busy Not
without extreme difficulty is a manchet of bread with or without a drop
of wine procured for the Kings Majesty this day Many a tired hero
will have nothing but tobacco with springwater to fall back upon
Never mind says the King says everybody After all it is a cheap
price to pay for missing an attack from Pandours in the rear while such
crisis went on ahead

Lying COUSIN Trenck of the Lifeguard who is now in Glatz gives vivid
eyewitness particulars of these things time of the morning and so on
says expressly he was there and what he did there Frederic Baron de
Trenck _Memoires traduits par luimeme_ Strasburg and Paris 1789
i 7478 79though in Glatz under lock and key three good months
before How could I help mistakes said he afterwards when people
objected to this and that in his blusterous mendacity of a Book I had
nothing but my poor agitated memory to trust to A mans memory when
it gets the length of remembering that he was in the Battle of Sohr
while bodily absent ought it not toin fact to strike work to still
its agitations altogether and call halt Trenck some months after
got clambered out of Glatz by sewers or I forget how and leaped or
dropped from some parapet into the River Neissesinking to the loins
in tough mud so that he could not stir

Friedrich lay at Sohr five days partly for the honor of the thing
partly to eat out the Country to perfection Prince Karl from
Konigshof soon fell back to Konigsgratz and lay motionless there
nothing but his Tolpatcheries astir Sohr Country all eaten Friedrich
in the due Divisions marched northward Through Trautenau Schatzlar
his own Division which was the main oneand fencing off the
Tolpatches successfully with trouble brings all his men into Silesia
again A good job of work behind them surely Cantons them to right and
left of Landshut about Rohnstock and Hohenfriedberg hamlets known so
well and leaving the Young Dessauer to command drives for Berlin 30th
Octoberrapidly as his wont is Prince Karl has split up his force
at Konigsgratz means one cannot doubt to go into winterquarters
If he think of invading across that eaten Country and those bad
Mountainswell our troops can all be got together in six hours time

At Trautenau a week after Sohr Friedrich had at last received the
English ratification of that Convention of Hanover signed 26th August
almost a month ago not ratified till September 22d About which there
had latterly been some anxiety lest his Britannic Majesty himself might
have broken off from it With Austria with Saxony Britannic Majesty
has been entirely unsuccessfulMay not Sohr perhaps be a fresh
persuasive hopes Friedrichbut as to Britannic Majestys breaking
off his thoughts are far from that if we knew Poor Majesty not long
since Supreme Jove of Germany and nowis like to be swallowed
in ragamuffin streetriots not a thunderbolt within clutch of him
thunderbolts all sticking in the mud of the Netherlands far off and
not a constables staff of the least efficacy Consider these dates in
combination Battle of Sohr was on THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 30th

Edinburgh as had not been seen therenot since Jenny Geddess stool
went flying at the Bishops head above a hundred years before Big
alarmbell bursting out in the middle of divine service emptying all
the Churches Highland rebels just at handinto General Meeting of
the Inhabitants into Chaos come again for the next forty hours
Till in the gaunt midnight Tuesday 2 AM Lochiel with about 1000
Camerons waiting slight opportunity crushed in through the Netherbow
Port andAnd about noon of that day a poor friend of ours
loitering expectant in the road that leads by St Anthonys Well saw
making entry into paternal Holyroodthe Young Pretender in person
who is just being proclaimed Prince of Wales up in the Highstreet
yonder A tall slender young man about five feet ten inches high of
a ruddy complexion highnosed large rolling brown eyes longvisaged
redhaired but at that time wore a pale periwig He was in a Highland
habit coat over the shoulder a blue sash wrought with gold red
velvet breeches a green velvet bonnet with white cockade on it and
a gold lace His speech seemed very like that of an Irishman very sly
how did you know my poor friendspoke often to OSullivan thought
to be a person of some counsel had been Tutor to Mailleboiss Boys had
even tried some irregular fighting under Mailleboisto OSullivan and
Henderson _Highland Rebellion_ p 14 And on Saturday in short
came PRESTONPANS Enough of such a Supreme Jove good for us here as a
timetable chiefly or marker of dates

Sunday 3d October Kings Adjutant Captain Mollendorf a young Officer
deservedly in favor arrives at Berlin with the joyful tidings of
this Sohr business Prausnitz we then called it to the joy of all
Prussians especially of a Queen Mother for whom there is a Letter in
pencil After brief congratulation Mollendorf rushes on having next to
give the Old Dessauer notice of it in his Camp at Dieskau in the Halle
neighborhood Mollendorf appears in Halle suddenly next morning Monday
about ten oclock sixteen postilions trumpeting and at their swiftest
trot in front of himshooting like a melodious morningstar across
the rusty old city in this mannerto Dieskau Camp where he gives the
Old Dessauer his good news Excellent Victory indeed sharp striking
swift selfhelp on our part Halle and the Camp have enough to think
of for this day and the next Whither Mollendorf went next we will not
ask perhaps to Brunswick and other consanguineous placesCertain it
is

On Wednesday the 6th about two in the afternoon the Old Dessauer
has his whole Army drawn out there with green sprigs in their hats
at Dieskau close upon the Saxon Frontier and after swashing and
manoeuvring about in the highest military style of art ranks them
all in line or two suitable lines 30000 of them and then
with clangorous outburst of trumpet kettledrum and all manner of
fieldmusic fires off his united artillery a first time almost shaking
the very hills by such a thunderous peal in the still afternoon And
mark close fitted into the artillery peal commences a rolling fire
like a peal spread out in threads sparkling strangely to eye and ear
from right to left long spears of fire and sharp strokes of sound
darting aloft successive simultaneous winding for the space of miles
then back by the rear line and home to the startingpoint very
grand indeed Again and also again the artillery peal and rolling
smallarms fitted into it is repeated a second and a third time
kettledrums and trumpets doing what they can That was the Old
Dessauers bonfiring what is called FEUDEJOIE for the Victory of
Sohr audible almost at Leipzig if the wind were westerly Overpowering
to the human mind at least to the old Newspaper reporter of that day
But what was strangest in the business continues he DAS CURIEUSESTE
DABEY was that the Saxon Uhlans lying about in the villages across
the Border were out in the fields watching the sight hardly 300 yards
off from beginning to end and little dreamed that his High Princely
Serenity blue of face and dreadful in war was quite close to them
on the Height called Bornhock condescending to take all this into
HighSerene Eyeshine there and by having a white flag waved
deigning to give signal for the discharges of the artillery
_HeldenGeschichte_ i 1124

By this the reader may know that the Old Dessauer is alive ready for
action if called on and Bruhl ought to comprehend better how riskish
his game with edgetools is Bruhl is not now in an unprepared
statehere are Uhlans at ones elbow looking on Rutowskis Uhlans
who lies encamped not far off in good force posted among morasses
strongly entrenched and with schemes in his head and in Bruhls of
an aggressive thricesecret and very surprising nature I remark only
that in Heidelberg Country victorious old Traun is putting his people

Chapter XIIISAXONY AND AUSTRIA MAKE A SURPRISING LAST ATTEMPT

After this strenuous and victorious Campaign which has astonished all
public men especially all Pragmatic Gazetteers and with which all
Europe is disharmoniously ringing Friedrich is hopeful there will be
Peace through Englandcannot doubt at least but the Austrians have
had enough for one yearand looks forward to certain months if not
of rest yet of another kind of activity Negotiation Peace through
England if possible that is the high prize and in the other case
or in any case readiness for next Campaignwhich with the treasury
exhausted and no honorable subsidy from France is a difficult problem

That was Friedrichs and everybodys program of affairs for the months
coming but in that Friedrich and everybody found themselves greatly
mistaken Bruhl and the Austrians had decided otherwise Open
mousetrap at Striegau claws of the sleeping cat at Sohr these were
sad experiences ill to bear with the SeaPowers grumbling on you and
the world sniffing its pity on youbut are not conclusive are only
provoking and even maddening to the sanguine mind Two sad failures
but let us try another time A tricky man cunning enough your King of
Prussia thinks Bruhl with a fellness of humor against Friedrich which
is little conceivable to us now Cunning enough But it is possible
cunning may be surpassed by deeper cunningand decides Bartenstein
and an indignant EmpressQueen assenting eagerly That there shall in
the profoundest secrecy till it break out be a third and much fiercer
trial this Winter yet The BruhlBartenstein plan owing mainly to the
Russian Bugbear which hung over it protective but with whims of its
own underwent changes successive redactions or editions which the
reader would grudge to hear explained to him Account of them in

contemporary satirical Pamphlet MONDSCHEINWURFE Mirrorcastings of
Moonshine by ZEBEDAUS Cuckoo beaten Captain of a beaten Army Of the
final or acted edition some loose notion sufficient for our purpose
may be collected from the following fractions of Notes

NOVEMBER 17th INTERIOR OF GERMANY FeldmarschallLieutenant von
Grune a General of mark detached by Traun not long since from the
Rhine Country with a force of 10000 men why is he marching about
first to Baireuth Country at Hof November 9th as if for Bohemia
then north to Gera lies at Gera till the 17th as if for
Saxony Proper Prince Karl you would certainly say has gone into
winterquarters about Konigsgratz and farther on Gone or going
sure enough is Prince Karl into the convenient Bohemian
districtsuncertain which particular districts at least the Young
Dessauer watching him from the Silesian side is uncertain which
Better be vigilant Prince LeopoldGrune lying at Gera yonder is not
intending for Prince Karl then No not thither Then perhaps
towards Saxony to reinforce the Saxons Or somewhither to find fat
winterquarters who knows Indeed who cares particularly for such
inconsiderable Grune and his 10000

The Saxons quitted their inexpugnable Camp towards Halle some time
ago went into cantonments farther inlandthe Old Dessauer middle
of October having done the like and gone home his force lies rather
scattered for convenience of food and forage From the Silesian
side again Prince Leopold whose headquarters are about Striegau
intimates That he cannot yet say with certainty what districts Prince
Karl will occupy for winterquarters in Bohemia Prince Karl is vaguely
roving about detaching Pandours to the Silesian Mountains as if for
checking our victorious Nassau therealways rather creeping northward
skirting Western Silesia with his main force 30000 or better with
Lobkowitz and Nadasti ahead Meaning what Be vigilant my young friend

The private fact is Prince Karl does not mean to go into
winterquarters at all In private fact Prince Karl is one of Three
mysterious Elements or Currents sent on a far errand Grune is another
Rutowskis Saxon Camp now become Cantonment is a third Three Currents
instinct with fire and destruction but as yet quite opaque which have
been launchedwhitherward thinks the reader On Berlin itself and
the Mark of Brandenburg there to collide and ignite in a marvellous
manner There is their meetingpoint there shall they on a sudden
smite one another into flame and the destruction blaze fiery enough
round Friedrich and his own Brandenburg homesteads there

It is a grand scheme scheme at least on a grand scale For the LEGS of
it Grunes march and Prince Karls are about 600 miles long Plan due
chiefly they say to the yellow rage of Bruhl aided by the contrivance
of Rutowski and the counsel of Austrian military men For there is much
consulting about it and redacting of it Polish Majesty himself
very busy To Bruhls yellow rage it is highly solacing and hopeful
Rutowski lying close in his Cantonments and then suddenly springing
out will overwhelm the Old Dessauer who lies widecan do it surely
and Grune is there to help if necessary Dessauer blown to pieces
Grune with Rutowski combined push in upon BrandenburgGrune himself
upon Berlinfrom the west and south nobody expecting him Prince
Karl not taking into winterquarters in Bohemia as they idly think
but falling down the Valley of the Bober or Bober and Queiss into the
Lausitz to Gorlitz Guben where we have Magazines for him comes upon
it from the southeastnobody expecting any of them Three simultaneous
Armies hurled on the head of your Friedrich combustible deluges flowing
towards him as from the ends of Germany so opaque silent yet of fire
wholly will not that surprise him thinks Bruhl These are the schemes
of the little man

Bruhl having constituted himself rival to Friedrich and fallen into
pale or yellow rage by the course things took this Plan is naturally
his chief joy or crown of joys a bubbling well of solace to him in
his parched condition He should obviously have kept it secret
thricesecret the little foolbut a poor parched man is not always
master of his private bubbling wells in that kind Wolfstierna is
Swedish Envoy at Dresden Rudenskjold Swedish Envoy at Berlin has
run over to see him in the dim November days Swedes since Ulriques
marriage are friendly to Prussia Bruhl has these two men to dinner
talks with them over his wine about Friedrichs insulting usage
of him among other topics Insulting how your Excellency asks
Rudenskjold privately a friend of Friedrich Bruhl explains with voice
quivering those cuts in the Friedrich manifesto of August last and
other griefs suffered the two Swedes soothing him with what oil they
have ready No matter hints Bruhl and proceeds from hint to hint
till the two Swedes are fully aware of the grand scheme Grune Prince
Karl and how Destruction with legs 500 miles long is steadily
advancing to assuage one with just revenge Right your
Excellencyonly that Rudenskjold proceeds to Berlin and there
straightway 8th November punctually makes Friedrich also aware

FRIEDRICH GOES OUT TO MEET HIS THREELEGGED MONSTER CUTS ONE LEG OF IT
IN TWO Fight of Hennersdorf 23d November 1745

Friedrich having heard the secret gazes into it with horror and
astonishment What a time I have This is not living this is being
killed a thousand times a day Ranke iii 321 n TO whom said we
are not toldwith horror and astonishment but also with what most
luminous flash of eyesight is in him compares it with Prince Karls
enigmatic motions Grunes open ones and the other phenomenaperceives
that it is an indisputable fact and a thriceformidable requiring to
be instantly dealt with by the party interested Whereupon after hearty
thanks to Rudenskjold there occur these rapidly successive phases of
activity which we study to take up in a curt form

FIRST probably 9th or 10th November there is Council held with
Minister Podewils and the Old Dessauer Council from which comes little
benefit or none Podewils and Old Leopold stare incredulous cannot
be made to believe such a thing Impossible any Saxon minister or man
would voluntarily bring the theatre of war into his own Country in
this manner thinks the Old Dessauer and persists to thinkon what
obstinate ground Friedrich never knew To which Podewils who
has properties in the Lausitz and would so fain think them safe
obstinately though more covertly adheres Impossible urge both
these Councillors and Friedrich cannot even make them believe it
Believe it and alas believing it is not the whole problem

Happily Friedrich has the privilege of ordering with or without their
belief You Podewils announce the matter to foreign Courts You
Serene Highness of Anhalt at your swiftest collect yonder and encamp
again Your eye well on Grune and Rutowski and the instant I give you
signal I am for Silesia to look after Prince Karl the other long
leg of this Business Old Leopold according to Friedrichs account is
visibly glad of such opportunity to fight again before he die and yet
for no reason except some senile jealousy is not content with these
arrangements perversely objects to this and that At length the
King saysthink of this hard word and of the eyes that accompany
itWhen your Highness gets Armies of your own you will order them
according to your mind at present it must be according to mine On
then and not a moment lost for of all things we must be swift

Old Leopold goes accordingly Friedrich himself goes in a week hence
Orders correspondences from Podewils and the rest are flying right and
leftto Young Leopold in Silesia first of all Young Leopold draws
out his forces towards the SilesianLausitz border where Prince Karls
intentions are now becoming visible Andhere is the second phase
notable

On Monday 15th 18th _Feldzuge_ i 402 see Rodenbeck i 122
at 7 AM Friedrich rushes off by Crossen full speed for Liegnitz
with Rothenburg with the Prince of Prussia and Ferdinand of Brunswick
accompanying With what thoughtsthough in his face you can read
nothing all Berlin being already in such tremor Friedrich is in
Liegnitz next day and after needful preliminaries there does on the
Thursday following at NiederAdelsdorf not far off take actual
command of Prince Leopolds Army which had lain encamped for some days
waiting him And now with such force in hand35000 soldiers every
man of them and freshened by a months restone will endeavor to do
some good upon Prince Karl Probably sooner than Prince Karl supposes
For there is great velocity in this young King a pantherlike
suddenness of spring in him cunning too as any Felis of them and
with claws like the Felis Leo on occasion Here follows the brief
Campaign that ensued which I strive greatly to abridge

Prince Karls intentions towards FrankfurtonOder Country through the
Lausitz are now becoming practically manifest There is a Magazine for
him at Guben within thirty miles of Frankfurt arrangements getting
ready all the way A winter march of 150 milesbut what say the
spies is to hinder Prince Karl dreams not that Friedrich is on the
ground or that anybody is aware Which notion Friedrich finds that it
will be extremely suitable to maintain in Prince Karl Friedrich is now
at Adelsdorf some thirty miles eastward of the Lausitz Border perhaps
forty or more from the route Prince Karl will follow through that
Province

It is a highlying irregularly hilly Country hilly not mountainous
Various streams rise out of it that have a long courseamong others
the Spree which washes Berlinespecially three Valleys cross it
three Rivers with their Valleys Bober Queiss Neisse the THIRD Neisse
we have come upon all running northward pretty much parallel though
all are branches of the Oder This is Neisse THIRD we say not the
Neisse of Neisse City which we used to know at the north base of
the Giant Mountains nor the Roaring Neisse which we have seen at
Hohenfriedberg but a third and the FOURTH and last Black Neisse
thank Heaven is an upper branch of this and we have and shall have
nothing to do with itthird Neisse which we may call the Lausitz
Neisse On which near the head of it there is a fine old spinning
linenweaving Town called Zittauwhere to make it memorable one
Tourist has read on the Townhouse an Inscription worth repeating
BENE FACERE ET MALE AUDIRE REGIUM EST To do good and have evil said
of you is a kingly thing Other Towns as Gorlitz and seventy miles
farther the abovesaid Guben lie on this same Neisseshall we
add that Herrnhuth stands near the head of it The wondrous Town of
Herrnhuth LORDSKEEPING founded by Count Zinzendorf twenty
years before those dates In 1722 the first tree felled LIVES of
Zinzendorf where are a kind of German MethodistQuakers to this day
who have become very celebrated in the interim An opulent enough most
silent strictly regular strange little Town The women are in uniform
wives maids widows each their form of dress Missionaries speaking
flabby English who have been in the West Indies or are going thither
seem to abound in the place male population otherwise I should think
must be mainly doing trade elsewhere nothing but prayers preachings
charitable boardingschooling and the like appeared to be going on
Herrnhuth is a Sabbath Petrified Calvinistic Sabbath done into Stone
as one of my companions called it Tourists Note Autumn 1852

Herrnhuth of which all Englishmen have heard stands near the head of
this our third Neisse as does Zittau a few miles higher up I can do
nothing more to give it mark for them Bober Valley then Queiss Valley
which run parallel though they join at last and become Bober wholly
before getting into the Oderthese two Valleys and Rivers lie in
Friedrichs own Territory and are between him and the Lausitz Queiss
River being the boundary of Silesia and the Lausitz here It is down
the Neisse that Prince Karl means to march There are Saxons already
gathering about Zittau and down as far as Guben they are making
Magazines and arrangementsfor it is all their own Country in those
years though most of it is Prussias now Prince Karls march will go
parallel to the Bober and the Queiss separated from the Queiss in this
part by an undulating Hilltract of twenty miles or more

Friedrich has had somewhat to settle for the Southern Frontier of
Silesia withal which new doggeries of Pandours are invadingto lie
ready for Prince Karl on his return thither whose grand meaning all
this while as Friedrich well knows is Silesia in the lump again
had he once cut us off from Brandenburg and our supplies General
Nassau far eastward who is doing exploits in Moravia itselfhim
Friedrich has ordered homeward westward to his own side of the
Mountains to attend these new Pandour gentlemen Winterfeld he has
called home out of those Southern mountains as likely to be usefuler
here on this Western frontier Winterfeld arrived in Camp the same day
with Friedrich and is sent forward with a body of 3000 light troops
to keep watch about the Lausitz Frontier and the River Queiss careful
not to quit our own side of that streamas we mean to hoodwink Prince
Karl if we can

Friedrich lies strictly within his own borders for a day or two till
Prince Karl march till his own arrangements are complete Friedrich
himself keeps the Bober Winterfeld the Queiss all pass freely out of
the Lausitz none are allowed to cross into it thereby we hear notice
of Prince Karl he none of us Perfectly quiescent we poor creatures
and aware of nothing Thus too Friedrichin spite of his warlike
Manifesto which the Saxons are on the eve of answering with a formal
Declaration of Waraffects great rigor in considering the Saxons as not
yet at war with him respects their frontier Winterfeld even punishes
hussars for trespassing on Lausitz ground Friedrich also affects to
have roads repaired which he by no means intends to travelthe whole
with a view of lulling Prince Karl of keeping the mousetrap open
as he had done in the Striegau case It succeeded again quite as
conspicuously and at less expense

Prince Karlwhose Tolpatch doggery Winterfeld will not allow to pass
the Queiss and to whom no traveller or tidings can come from beyond
that Riverdiscerns only on the farther shore of it Winterfeld with
his 3000 light troops Behind these he discerns either nothing or
nothing immediately momentous but contentedly supposes that this the
superficies of things is all the solidcontent they have Prince
Karl gets under way therefore nothing doubting with his Saxons as
vanguard Down the Neisse Valley on the right or Queissward side of
it Saturday 20th November is his first march in Lusatian territory
He lies that night spread out in three Villages Schonberg Schonbrunn
Kieslingswalde _Feldzuge_ i 407 Bericht von der Action bey
KatholischHennersdorf c some ten miles long parallel to the
Neisse River and about four miles from it east or Queissward of it
Karl himself is rear at Schonberg fierce Lobkowitz is centre the
Saxons are vanguard 6000 in all posted in Villages which again are
some ten or twelve miles ahead of Prince Karls forces the Queiss on
their right hand and the Naumburg Bridge of Queiss where Winterfeld
now is about fifteen miles to east Their Uhlans circulate through
the intervening space were much patrolling needed in such quiet
circumstances and maintain the due communication There lies Prince
Karl on Saturday night 20th November 1745 an Army of perhaps 40000
dnngerously straggling out above twenty miles long and appears to see
no difficulty ahead The Saxons I think are to continue where they
are guarding the flank while the Prince and Lobkowitz push
forward closer by Neisse River In four marches more they can be in
Brandenburg with Guben and their Magazines at hand

Seeing which state of matters Winterfeld gives Friedrich notice of
it and that he Winterfeld thinks the moment is come Pontoons to
Naumburg then orders Friedrich Winterfeld at the proper moment is
to form a Bridge there One permanent Bridge there already is and two
fords one above it one below with a second Bridge there will be
roadway for four columns and a swift transit when needful Sunday
21st Friedrich quits the Bober diligently towards Naumburg marches
Sunday Monday Tuesday 23d about eleven AM begins to arrive there
Winterfeld and passages all ready Forward then and let us drive in
upon Prince Karl and either cut him in two or force him to fight us
he little thinks where or on what terms Sure enough in the worst place
we can choose for him Friedrich begins crossing in four columns at
one PM crosses continuously for four hours unopposed except some
skirmishing of Uhlans while his Cavalry is riding the Fords to right
and left Uhlans were driven back swiftly so soon as the Cavalry got
over At five in the evening he has got entirely across 35000 horse
and foot Ziethen is chasing the Uhlans at full speed who at least will
show us the wayfor by this time a mist has begun falling and the
brief daylight is done

Friedrich himself without waiting for the rear of his force and some
while before this mist fell as I judge is pushing forward a miller
lad for his guide across to HennersdorfKatholischHennersdorf a
long straggling Village eight or ten miles off and itself two miles
longwhere he understands the Saxons are Miller lad guides us over
height and hollow with his best skill at a brisk pacethrough one
hollow where he has known the cattle pasture in summer time but which
proves impassable and mere quagmire at this season No getting through
it you unfortunate miller lad GARCON DE MEUNIER Nevertheless we did
find passage through the skirts of it nay this quagmire proved the
luck of us for the enemy trusting to it had no outguard there never
expecting us on that side So that the vanguard Ziethen and rapid
Hussars made an excellent thing of it Ziethen sends us word That he
has got into the body of Hennersdorffound the Saxon Quartermaster
quietly paying his menthat he Ziethen is tolerably master of
Hennersdorf and will amuse the enemy till the other force come up

Of course Friedrich now pushes on double speed detaches other force
horse and foot which was lucky says my informant for the Ziethen
Hussars getting good plunder had by no means demolished the Saxons
but had left them time to draw up in firm order with a hedge in front
a little west of the Villagefrom which post unassailable by Ziethen
they would have got safe off to the main body with little but an
affront and some loss of goods The new forcea rapid Katzler
with light horse in the van cuirassiers and foot rapidly following
himsweeps past the long Village through a thin wood and a defile
finds the enemy firmly ranked as above said cavalry their left
infantry on right flanked by an impenetrable hedge and at once strikes
in At once Katzler does on order given but is far too weak Charges
he but is countercharged tumbled back the Saxons horse and foot
showing excellent fight At length more Prussian force coming up
cuirassiers charge them in front dragoons in flank hussars in rear
all attacking at once and with a will and the poor Saxon Cavalry is
entirely cut to shreds

And now there remains only the Infantry perhaps about 1000 men if one
must guess who form a square ply vigorously their fieldpieces and
their firearms and cannot be broken by horsecharges In fact these
Saxons made a fierce resistancetill before long Prussian Infantry
came up and with counter fieldpieces and musketries blasted gaps
in them upon which the Cavalry got admittance and reduced the gallant
fellows nearly wholly to annihilation either by death or capture There
are 914 Prisoners in this Action 4 big guns and I know not how many
kettledrums standards and the likeall that were there I suppose
The number of dead not given Orlich ii 291 _Feldzuge_i 400413
But in brief this Saxon Force is utterly cut to pieces and only
scattered twos and threes of it rush through the dark mist scattering
terror to this hand and that The Prussians take their post at and round
Hennersdorf that nightbivouacking though only in sack trousers a
blanket each manWe work hard my men and suffer all things for a
day or two that it may save much work afterwards said the King to
them and they cheerfully bivouacked

This was the Action of KatholischHennersdorf fought on Tuesday
23d November 1745 and still celebrated in the Prussian Annals and
reckoned a brilliant passage of war KATHOLISCHHennersdorf some
ten miles southwest of Naumburg ON THE QUEISS for there are to my
knowledge Twentyfive other Villages called Hennersdorf and Three
several Towns of Naumburg and many Castles and Hamlets so named in dear
Germany of the NomenclaturesKatholischHennersdorf is the place
and Tuesday about dusk the time A sharp brush of fighting not great in
quantity but laid in at the right moment in the right place Like
the prick of a needle duly sharp into the spinal marrow of a gigantic
object totally ruinous to such object Never or rarely in the Annals
of War was as much good got of so little fighting You may with labor
and peril plunge a hundred dirks into your boaconstrictor hack him
with axes bray him with sledgehammers that is not uncommon but the
one true prick in the spinal marrow and the Artist that can guide you
well to that he and it are the notable and beneficent phenomena




PRINCE KARL CUT IN TWO TUMBLES HOME AGAIN DOUBLEQUICK

Next morning Wednesday 24th the Prussians are early astir again
groping on all manner of roads to find what Prince Karl is doing in
a world all covered in thick mist They can find nothing of him but
broken tumbrils left baggagewagons rumor of universal marching hither
and marching thitherevidences of an Army fallen into universal St
VitussDance distractedly hurrying to and fro not knowing whitherward
for the moment except that it must be homewards homewards with
velocity

Prince Karls farther movements are not worth particularizing Ordering
and crossordering march this way no back again such a scene in that
mist Prince Karl is flowing homeward confusedly deluging and gurgling
southward the best he can Next afternoon near Gorlitz and again one
other time he appears drawn up as if for fighting but has himself no
such thought flies again without a shot leaves Gorlitz to capitulate
that afternoon all places to capitulate or be evacuated We hear he is
for Zittau Winterfeld with light horse hastens after him gets sight of
him on the Heights at Zittau yonder  _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii 157
Orlich ii 296 about two in the morning but the Prince has not
the least notion to fight Prince leaves Zittau to capitulatequits
silently the Heights of Zittau at two AM Winterfeld very lively in
the rear of him cutting off his baggageand so tumbles pellmell
through the Passes of Gabel home to Bohemia again Let us save this
poor Note from the fire

On Saturday night November 27th the Prussians pursuing Prince Karl
were cantoned in the Herrnhuth neighborhoodmy informants regiment
in the Town of Herrnhuth itself _Feldzuge_ i ubi supra Yes there
lay the Prussians over Sunday and might hear some weighty expounder
if they liked Considerably theological many of these poor Prussian
soldiers carrying a Bible in their knapsack and devout Psalms in the
heart of them Twothirds of every regiment are LANDESKINDER native
Prussians each regiment from a special cantongenerally rather
religious men The other third are recruits gathered in the Free Towns
of the Reich or where they can be got not distinguished by devotion
these we may fancy only trained to the uttermost by Spartan drill

Before the week is done that first leg of the grand Enterprise the
PrinceKarl leg is such a leg as we see Silesia in the lumpfond
dream again what a dream Old Dessauer getting signal where now too
probably is Saxony itselfRanking again at Aussig in Bohemia Prince
Karl5000 of his men lost and all impetus and fire gonefalls gently
down the Elbe to join Rutowski at least and will reappear within four
weeks out of Saxon Switzerland still rather in dismal humor

The Prussian Troops in four great Divisions are cantoned in that
Lausitz Country now so quiet in and about Bautzen and three other
Towns of the neighborhood to rest and be ready for the old Dessauer
when we hear of him The Magazine at Guben in 138 wagons the Gorlitz
and other Magazines of Prince Karl in the due number of wagons supply
them with comfortable unexpected provender Thus they lie cantoned
and have with despatch effectually settled their part of the problem
Question now is How will it stand with the Old Dessauer and his part
Or better still Would not perhaps the Saxons in this humiliated
state accept Peace and finish the matter




Chapter XIVBATTLE OF KESSELSDORF

A Correspondence of a certain Excellency Villiers English Minister
at DresdenSir Thomas Villiers Grandfather of the present Earl of
Clarendonwas very famous in those weeks and is still worth mention
as a trait of Friedrichs procedure in this crisis Friedrich not
intoxicated with his swift triumph over Prince Karl but calculating
the perils and the chances still aheadmiserably off for money
tooadmits to himself that not revenge or triumph that Peace is the
one thing needful to him November 29th Old Leopold is entering Saxony
and in the same hours Podewils at Berlin by order of Friedrich writes
to Villiers who is in Dresden about Peace about mediating for Peace
My King ready and desirous now as at all times for Peace the terms
of it known terms not altered not alterable no bargaining or higgling
needed or allowable CONVENTION OF HANOVER let his Polish Majesty
accede honestly to that and all these miseries are ended
CORRESPONDANCE DU ROI AVEC SIR THOMAS VILLIERS commences on
Podewilss part 28th November on Friedrichs 4th December ends
on Villiers 18th December fourteen Pieces in all four of them
Friedrichs Given in _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii 183216 see IB 158
and in many other Books

Villiers starts instantly on this beneficent business goes to Court
on it that very night Villiers shows himself really diligent
reasonable loyal doing his very best now and afterwards but has no
success at all Polish Majesty is obstinateI always think in the way
sheep are when they feel themselves too much put uponand is deaf
to everybody but Bruhl Bruhl answers Let his Prussian Majesty retire
from our Territorywhat is he doing in the Lausitz just now Retire
from our Territory THEN we will treat Bruhl still refuses to be
desperate of his bad gameat any rate Bruhls rage is yellower
than ever That very evening while talking to Villiers he has had
preparations going onand next morning takes his Master Polish
Majesty August III with some comfortable minimum of apparatus
cigarboxes not forgotten off to Prag where they can be out of
danger till the thing decide itself Villiers follows to Prag desists
not from his eloquent Letters and earnest persuasions at Prag but
begins to perceive that the means of persuading Bruhl will be a much
heavier kind of artillery

On the whole negotiations have yet done little Britannic George
though Purseholder what is his success here As little is the Russian
Bugbear persuasive on Friedrich himself The Czarina of the Russias a
luxurious lady of far more weight than insight has just notified to
him with more emphasis than ever That he shall not attack Saxony that
if he do she with considerable vigor will attack him That has always
been a formidable puzzle for Friedrich however he reflects that the
Russians never could draw sword or be ready with their Army in less
than six months probably not in twelve and has answered translating
it into polite official terms Feefawfum your Czarish Majesty
Question is not now of attacking but of being myself attackedand so
is now running his risks with the Czarina

Still worse was the result he got from Louis XV Lately for forms
sake as he tells us and not expecting anything he had November
15th made a new appeal to France Ruin menacing your Most Christian
Majestys Ally in this huge sudden crisis of invasive AustrianSaxons
and for your Majestys sake may I not in some measure say To which
Louiss Answer is also given A very sickly unpleasant Document
testifying to considerable pique against FriedrichRanke says it was
a joint production all the Ministers gradually contributing each his
little pinch of irony to make it spicier and Louis signing when it was
enoughvery considerable pique against Friedrich and something of the
stupid sulkiness as of a fat bad boy almost glad that the house is on
fire because it will burn his nimble younger brother whom everybody
calls so clever Sorry indeed Sir my Brother most sorryand so
you have actually signed that HANOVER CONVENTION with our worst Enemy
France is far from having done so France has done and will do great
things Our Royal heart grieves much at your situation but is not
alarmed no Your Majesty has such invention vigor and ability
superior to any crisis our clever younger Brother And herewith we
pray God to have you in his holy keeping This is the purport of King
Louiss Letterwhich Friedrich folds together again looking up from
perusal of it we may fancy with what a glance of those eyes Louiss
Original in _OEuvres de Frederic_ iii 173 174 with a much
more satirical paraphrase than the above and Friedrichs Answer
adjoinedafter the events had come

Bautzen 11th December 1745 UBI SUPRA Yes truly it is the
ULTIMATE persuasive that Here in condensed form are the essential
details of the course it went in this instanceGeneral Grune on
the road to Berlin hearing of the rout at Hennersdorf halted
instantlyhastened back to Saxony to join Rutowski there and stand
on the defensive Not now in that HalleFrontier region Rutowski has
quitted that and all the intrenchments and marshy impregnabilities
there not on that HalleFrontier but hovering about in the
interior Rutowski and Grune are in junction gravitating towards
Dresdenexpecting Prince Karls advent who ought to emerge from the
Saxon Switzerland in few days were he sharp and again enable us to
make a formidable figure Be speedy Old Dessauer you must settle the
GruneRutowski account before that junction not after it

The Old Dessauer has been tolerably successful and by no means thinks
he has been losing time November 29th at three in the morning he
stept over into Saxony with its impregnable camps drove Rutowskis
rearguard or remnant out of the quagmires canals and intrenchments
before daylight drove it that same evening or before dawn of the
morrow out of Leipzig has seized that Townlays heavy contribution
on it nearly 50000 pounds such our strait for finance and be sure
you take only substantial men as sureties Orlich ii 308and
will and does after a two days rest advance with decent celerity
inwards though One must first know exactly whither one must have
bread and preparations and precautions do all things solidly and in
order thinks the Old Dessauer Friedrich well knows the whither and
that Dresden itself is or may be made the place for falling in with
Rutowski Friedrich is now himself ready to join from the Bautzen
region the days and hours precious to him and spurs the Old Dessauer
with the sharpest remonstrances All solidly and in order your
Majesty answers the Old Dessauer solid strongboned old coachhorse
who has his own modes of trotting having done many a heavy mile of it
in his time and whose skin one hopes is of the due thickness against
undue spurring

Old Dessauer wishes two things bread to live upon and a sure Bridge
over the Elbe whereby Friedrich may join him Old Dessauer makes for
Torgau far north where is both an Elbe Bridge and a Magazine which he
takes Torgau and pertinents now his But it is far down the Elbe far
off from Bautzen and Friedrich A nearer Bridge and rendezvous your
Highness Meissen where they make the china only fifty miles from me
and twenty from Dresden let that be the Bridge now that you have got
victual And speedy for Heavens sake speedy Friedrich pushes out
General Lehwald from Bautzen with 4000 men towards Meissen Bridge
Lehwald does not himself meddle with the Bridge only fires shot across
upon the Saxon party till the Old Dessauer on the other bank come
upand the Old Dessauer impatience thinks will never come Three
days in Torgau yes Your Majesty I had bread to bake and the very
ovens had to be built A solid old roadster with his own modes of
trotting needs thickness of skin Friedrichs Letters to Leopold in
Orlich ii 431 435 6th10th December 1745

At long last on Sunday 12th December about two PM the Old Dessauer
does appear or General Gessler his vanguard does appearGessler of
the sixtyseven standardsalways about an hour ahead Gessler has
summoned Meissen has not got it is haggling with it about terms when
towards sunset of the short day Old Dessauer himself arrives Whereupon
the Saxon Commandant quits the Bridge not much breaking it and glides
off in the dark clear out of Meissen towards Dresdenchased but
successfully defending himself See Plan p 10 Had he but stood out
for two days say the SaxonsPrince Karl had then been up and much
might have been different Well Friedrich too would have been up
and it had most likely been the same on a larger scale But the Saxon
Commandant did not stand out he glided off safe joined Rutowski and
Grune who are lying about Wilsdruf six or seven miles on the hither
side of Dresden and eagerly waiting for Prince Karl Bridge and Town
of Meissen are your Majestys reports the Old Dessauer that night
upon which Friedrich instantly rises hastening thitherward Lehwald
comes across Meissen Bridge effects the desired junction and all
Monday the Old Dessauer defiles through Meissen town and territory
continually advances towards Dresden the Saxons harassing the flanks
of him a littlenay in one defile being sharp strenuous fellows they
threw his rear into some confusion cut off certain carts and prisoners
and the life of one brave General LieutenantGeneral Roel who had
charge there Spurring ones trot into a gallop This comes of your
fast marching of your spurring beyond the rules of war thinks Old
Leopold and Friedrich who knows otherwise is very angry for a moment

But indeed the crisis is pressing Prince Karl is across the Metal
Mountains nearing Dresden from the east Friedrich strikes into march
for the same point by Meissen so soon as the Bridge is his Old Leopold
is advancing thither from the westwardsteadily hour by hour Dresden
City the fateful goal Therein these middle days of December 1745
Highland Rebellion just whirling back from Derby again the London
shops shut for one dayit is clear there will be a big and bloody
game played before we are much older Very sad indeed but Count Bruhl
is not persuadable otherwise By slumbering and sluggarding over their
moneytills and fleshpots trying to take evil for good and to say
It will do when it will not do respectable Nations come at last
to be governed by Bruhls cannot help themselvesand get their backs
broken in consequence Why not Would you have a Nation live forever
that is content to be governed by Bruhls The gods are wiserIt is now
the 13th Old Dessauer tramping forward hour by hour towards Dresden
and some field of Fate

On Tuesday 14th by break of day Old Dessauer gets on march again
in four columns in battle order steady all dayhard winter weather
ground crisp and flecked with snow The Pass at Neustadt his cavalry
went into it at full gallop but found nobody there That night
he encamps at a place called Rohrsdorf which may be eight miles
westbynorth from Dresden as the crow flies and ten or more if you
follow the highway round by Wilsdruf on your right The real direct
Highway from Meissen to Dresden is on the other side of the Elbe and
keeps by the Riverbank a fine level road but on this western side
where Leopold now is the road is inland and goes with a bend Leopold
of course keeps command of this road his columns are on both sides of
it River on their left at some miles distance and incessantly expect
to find Rutowski drawn out on favorable ground somewhere The country
is of fertile but very broken character intersected by many
brooks making obliquely towards the Elbe obliquely with a leaning
Meissenwards country always mounting till here about Rohrsdorf we
seem to have almost reached the watershed and the brooks make for the
Elbe leaning Dresden way Good posts abound in such broken country
with its villages and brooks with its thickets hedges and patches of
swamp But Rutowski has not appeared anywhere during this Tuesday

Our four columns therefore lie all night under arms about Rohrsdorf
and again by morrows dawn are astir in the old order crunching far
and wide the frozen ground and advance charged to the muzzle with
potential battle Slightly upwards always to the actual watershed
of the country leaving Wilsdruf a little to their right Wilsdruf is
hardly past when see from this broad tableland top of the country
Yonder is Rutowski at lastand this new Wednesday will be a day
Yonder sure enough drawn out three or four miles long with his
right to the Elbe his left to that intricate Village of Kesselsdorf
bristling with cannon deep gullet and swampy brook in front of him the
strongest post a man could have chosen in those parts

The Village of Kesselsdorf itself lies rather in a hollow in the slight
beginning or uppermost extremity of a little Valley or Dell called
the Tschonengrundwhich with its quaggy brook of a Tschone wends
northeastward into the Elbe a course of four or five miles a little
Valley very deep for its length and getting altogether chasmy and
precipitous towards the Elbeward or lower end Kesselsdorf itself
as we said is mainly in a kind of hollow between Old Leopold and
Kesselsdorf the ground rather mounts and there is perceptibly a flat
knoll or rise at the head of it where the Village begins Some trees
there and abundance of cannon and grenadiers at this moment It is the
southwestern or leftmost point of Rutowskis line impregnable with
its cannonbatteries and grenadiers Rightward Rutowski extends in long
lines with the quaggydell of Tschonengrund in front of him parallel
to him Dell ever deepening as it goes Northeastward at the extreme
right or Elbe point of it where Grune and the Austrians stand it has
grown so chasmy we judge that Grune can neither advance nor be

advanced uponewhich he did all day
in a purely meditative posture Rutowski numbers 35000 now on this
ground with immensity of cannon 32000 we with only the usual
fieldartillery and such a Tschonengrund with its halffrozen
quagmires ahead A ticklish case for the old man as he grimly
reconnoitres it in the winter morning

Grim Old Dessauer having reconnoitred and rapidly considered decides
to try itwhat elsewill range himself on the west side of that
Tschonengrund horse and foot two lines wide as Rutowski opposite him
but means to direct his main and prime effort against Kesselsdorf which
is clearly the key of the position if it can be taken For which end
the Old Dessauer lengthens himself out to rightward so as to outflank
Kesselsdorfneglecting Grune refusing Grune as the soldiers
sayour horse of the right wing reached from the Wood called
Lerchenbusoh LARCHBUSH rightward as far as Freyberg road foot
all between that Lerchenbusch and the big Birchtree on the road to
Wilsdruf horse of the left wing from there to Roitsch Stille p
181 who was present See Plan It was about two PM before the old
man got all his deployments completed what corps of his deploying this
way or that came within wind of Kesselsdorf were saluted with cannon
thirty pieces or more which are in battery in three batteries on the
knoll there but otherwise no fighting as yet At two the Old Dessauer
is complete he reverently doffs his hat as had always been his wont
in prayer to God before going in A grim fervor of prayer is in his
heart doubtless though the words as reported are not very regular or
orthodox O HERR GOTT help me yet this once let me not be disgraced
in my old days Or if thou wilt not help me dont help those HUNDSVOGTE
damned Scoundrels so to speak but leave us to try it ourselves
That is the Old Scandinavian of a Dessauers prayer a kind of GODUR
he too Priest as well as Captain Prayer mythically true as given
mythically not otherwise Ranke iii 334 n Which done he waves his
hat once On in Gods name and the storm is loose Prussian right
wing pushing grandly forward bent in that manner to take Kesselsdorf
and its firethroats in flank

The Prussians tramp on with the usual grimbrowed resolution foot
in front horse in rear but they have a terrible problem at that
Kesselsdorf with its retrenched batteries and numerous grenadiers
fighting under cover The very ground is sore against them uphill and
the trampled snow wearing into a slide so that you sprawl and stagger
sadly Thirtyone big guns and about 9000 small pouring out mere
death on you from that knollhead The Prussians stagger cannot stand
it bend to rightwards and get out of shotrange cannot manage it
this bout Rally reinforce try it again Again with a will but again
there is not a way The Prussians are again repulsed fall back down
this slippery course in more disorder than the first time Had the
Saxons stood still steadily handling arms how on such terms could
the Prussians ever have managed it

But at sight of this second repulse the Saxon grenadiers and
especially one battalion of Austrians who were there the only Austrians
who fought this day gave a shout Victoryand in the height of
their enthusiasm rushed out this Austrian battalion first and the
Saxons after them to charge these Prussians and sweep the world clear
of them It was the ruin of their battle a fatal hollaing before you
are out of the woods Old Leopold quick as thought noticing the thing
hurls cavalry on these victorious downplunging grenadiers slashes them
asunder into mere recoiling whirlpools of ruin so that few of
them got back unwounded and the Prussians storming in along with
themaided by ever new Prussians from beyond the Tschonengrund
eventhe place was at length carried and the Saxon battle became
hopeless

For their right being in such hurricane the Prussians from the
centre as we hint storm forward withal will not be held back by the
Tschonengrund They find the Tschonengrund quaggy in the extreme brook
frozen at the sides but waistdeep of liquid mud in the centre cross
it nevertheless towards the upper part of ityoung Moritz of Dessau
leading the way to help his old Father in extremity They climb the
opposite sidequite slippery in places but helping one another
upno Saxons there till you get fairly atop which was an oversight
on the Saxon part Fairly atop Moritz is saluted by the Saxons with
diligent musketvolleys but Moritz also has musketvolleys in him
bayonetcharges in him eager to help his old Papa at this hard pinch
Old Papa has the Saxons in flank sends more and ever more other cavalry
in on them and in fact the right wing altogether storms violently
through Kesselsdorf and sweeps it clean Whole regiments of the Saxons
are made prisoners Roels Light Horse we see there taking standards
cutting violently in to avenge Roels death and the affront they had
at Meissen lately Furious Moritz on their front from across the
Tschonengrund furious Roel GHOST of Roel and others in their flank
through Kesselsdorf no standing for the Saxons longer

About nightfalltheir horse having made poorish fight though the foot
had stood to it like menthey roll universally away The Prussian left
wing of horse are summoned through the Tschonengrund to chase had there
remained another hour of daylight the Saxon Army had been one wide
ruin Hidden in darkness the Saxon Army ebbed confusedly towards
Dresden with the loss of 6000 prisoners and 3000 killed and wounded
a completely beaten Army It is the last battle the Saxons fought as
a Nationor probably will fight Battle called of Kesselsdorf
Wednesday 15th December 1745

Prince Karl had arrived at Dresden the night before heard all this
volleying and cannonading from the distance but did not see good to
interfere at all Too wide apart some say quartered at unreasonably
distant villages by some irrefragable ignorant Warclerk of Bruhls
appointingfatal Bruhl Others say his Highness had himself no mind
and made excuses that his troops were tired disheartened by the two
beatings latelywhat will become of us in case of a third or fourth
It is certain Prince Karl did nothing Nor has Grimes corps the
right wing done anything except meditateit stood there unattacked
unattacking till deep in the dark night when Rutowski remembered
it and sent it order to come home One Austrian battalion that of
grenadiers on the knoll at Kesselsdorf did actually fightand did
begin that fatal outbreak and quitting of the post there which lost
the Battle to us say the Saxons

Had those grenadiers stood in their place there is no Prussian but
admits that it would have been a terrible business to take Kesselsdorf
and its batteries But they did not stand they rushed out shouting
Victory and lost us the battle And that is the good we have got of
the sublime Austrian Alliance and that is the pass our grand scheme
of Partitioning Prussia has come to Fatal little Bruhl of the three
hundred and sixtyfive clothessuits Valet fatally become divine in
Valethoodare not you costing your Country dear

Old Dessauer glorious in the last of his fields lay on his arms all
night in the posts about three bullets through his roquelaure no
scratch of wound upon the old man Young Moritz too had a bullet
through his coatskirt and three horses shot under him but no hurt

considerably about him in times coming A lean tall austere man and

Chapter XVPEACE OF DRESDEN FRIEDRICH DOES MARCH HOME

Friedrich himself had got to Meissen Tuesday 14th no enemy on his
road or none to speak of Friedrich was there or not yet far across
all Wednesday collecting himself waiting on the slip for a signal
from Old Leopold Sound of cannon up the Elbe Dresdenward is
reported there to Friedrich that afternoon cannon sure enough notes
Friedrich and deep dimrolling peals as of volleying smallarms
the sky all on fire over there as the hoarfrosty evening fell Old
Leopold busy at it seemingly That is the glare of the Old Dessauers
countenance who is giving voice in that manner to the earthly and the
heavenly powers conquering Peace for us let us hope

Friedrich as may be supposed made his best speed next morning All
well say the messengers all well says Old Leopold whom he meets
at Wilsdruf and welcomes with a joyful embrace dismounting from his
horse at sight of Leopold and advancing to meet him with doffed hat
and open armsand such words and treatments that day as made the
old mans face visibly shine Your Highness shall conduct me And the
two made survey together of the actual Field of Kesselsdorf strewn with
the ghastly wrecks of battlemany citizens of Dresden strolling about
or sorrowfully seeking for their lost ones among the wounded and dead
No hurt to these poor citizens who dread none help to them rather
such is Friedrichs mindconcerning which in the AnecdoteBooks
there are Narratives not worth giving of a vapidly romantic character
credible though inexact For the indisputable pa so we leave him
standing therrt see Orlich ii 343 344 and _OEuvres de
Frederic_ iii 170 Friedrich who may well be profuse of thanks and
praises charms the Old Dessauer while they walk together brave old man
with his holed roquelaure For certain he has done the work therea
great deal of work in his time Joy looks through his old rough face of
gunpowder color the Herr Gott has not delivered him to those damned
Scoundrels in the end of his daysOn the morrow Friday Leopold
rolled grandly forward upon Dresden Rutowski and Prince Karl vanishing
into the Metal Mountains by Pirna for Bohemia at sound of himas he
had scarcely hoped they would

On the Saturday evening Dresden capable of not the least defence has
opened all its gates and Friedrich and the Prussians are in Dresden
Austrians and wrecked Saxons falling back diligently towards the Metal
Mountains for Bohemia diligent to clear the road for him Queen and
Junior Princes are here to whom as to all men Friedrich is courtesy
itself making personal visit to the Royalties appointing guards of
honor sacred respect to the Royal Houses himself will lodge at the
Princess Lubomirskis a private mansion

That ferocious false ambitious King of PrussiaWell he is not to
be ruined in open fight on the contrary is ruinous there nor by the
cunningest ambuscades and secret combinations in field or cabinet our
overwhelming Winter Invasion of himsee where it has ended Bruhl and
Polish Majestythe nocturnal sky all on fire in those parts and loud
general doomsday comeare a muchilluminated pair of gentlemen

From the time Meissen Bridge was lost Prince Karl too showing himself
so languid even Bruhl had discerned that the case was desperate On the
very day of Kesselsdorfnot the day BEFORE which would have been
such a thrift to Bruhl and othersFriedrich had a Note from Villiers
signifying joyfully that his Polish Majesty would accept Peace Thanks
to his Polish Majestyand after Kesselsdorf perhaps the EmpressQueen
too will Friedrichs offers are precisely what they were what they
have always been Convention of Hanover that in all its parts old
treaty of Breslau to be guaranteed to be actually kept To me Silesia
surefrom you Polish Majesty one million crowns as damages for
the trouble and cost this Triple Ambuscade of yours has given me one
million crowns 150000 pounds we will say and all other requisitions
to cease on the day of signature These are my terms accept these then
wholly As you were EmpressQueen and you and all surviving creatures
and I march home within a week Villiers speeds rapidly from Prag with
the due olivebranch with Count Harrach experienced Austrian and full
powers Harrach cannot believe his senses Such the terms to be still
granted after all these beatings and rebeatingsthen at last does
believe with stiff thankfulness and Austrian bows The Negotiation need
not occupy many hours

His Majesty of Prussia was far too hasty with this Peace says Valori
he had taken a threap that he would have it finished before the Year
was donein fact he knows his own mind MON GROS VALORI and that
is what few do You shear through no end of cobwebs with that fine
implement a wisely fixed resolution of your own A Peace slow enough
for Valori and the French where could that be looked forValori is at
Berlin in complete disgrace his Most Christian King having behaved so
like a Turk of late Valori horrorstruck at such Peace what shall
he do to prevent it to retard it One effort at least DArget his
Secretary stolen at Jaromirz is safe back to him ingenious ingenuous
DArget was always a favorite with Friedrich despatch DArget to
him DArget is despatched with reasons with remonstrances with
considerations DArgets Narrative is given an ingenuous offhand
Piecepoor little crevice through which there is still to be had

Friedrichs own thoughts in that manysounding Dresdenso loud

grandparades and Peacenegotiations


 THE SIEUR DARGET TO EXCELLENCY VALORI at Berlin

 DRESDEN 1745 dateless otherwise must be
 December between 18th and 25th
MONSEIGNEURI arrived yesterday at 7 PM as I had the honor of
forewarning you by the word I wrote to the Abbe never mind what Abbe
another ValoriClerk from Sonnenwalde my halfway house between Berlin
and this City I went first of all to M de Vaugrenand our Envoy
here who had the goodness to open himself to me on the Business now
on hand In my opinion nothing can be added to the excellent
considerations he has been urging on the King of Prussia and the Count
de Podewils

At halfpast 8 I went to his Prussian Majestys I found he was
engaged with his Concertlodges in the Lubomirski Palace has his
snatch of melody in the evening of such discordant daysand I could
not see him till after halfpast 9 I announced myself to M Eichel he
was too overwhelmed with affairs to give me audience I asked for Count
Rothenburg he was at cards with the Princess Lubomirski At last I did
get to the King who received me in the most agreeable way but was just
going to Supper said he must put off answering till tomorrow morning
morning of this day M de Vaugrenand had been so good as prepare me on
the rumors of a Peace with Saxony and the Queen of Hungary I went to M
Podewils who said a great many kind things to me for you I could only
sketch out the matter at that time and represented to Podewils the
brilliant position of his Master who had become Arbiter of the Peace
of Europe that the moment was come for making this Peace a General One
and that perhaps there would be room for repentance afterwards if the
opportunity were slighted He said his Masters object was that same
and thus closed the conversation by general questions

This morning I again presented myself at the King of Prussias I had
to wait and wait in fine it was not till halfpast 5 in the evening
that he returned or gave me admittance and I stayed with him till
after 7when Concerttime was at hand again Listen to a remarkable
Dialogue of the Conquering Hero with a humble Friend whom he likes
His Majesty condescended A DAIGNE to enter with me into all manner of
details and began by telling me

That M de Valori had done admirably not to come himself with that
Letter from the King Most Christian OUR King Letter the sickly
Document above spoken of that there could not have been an Answer
expectedthe Letter being almost of ironical strain his Majesty Most
Christian not giving him the least hope but merely talking of his fine
genius and how that would extricate him from the perilous entanglement
and inspire him with a wise resolution in the matter That he had in
effect taken a resolution the wisest he could and was making his Peace
with Saxony and the Queen of Hungary That he had felt all the dangers
of the difficult situations he had been insheer destruction
yawning all round him in huge imminency more than once and no
friend heedingthat weary of playing always doubleorquits he had
determined to end it and get into a state of tranquillity which both
himself and his People had such need of That France could not without
difficulty have remedied his mishaps and that he saw by the Kings
Letter there was not even the wish to do it That his Friedrichs
military career was completedso far as HE could foresee or
decide That he would not again expose his Country to the Caprices of
Fortune whose past constancy to him was sufficiently astonishing to
raise fears of a reverse HEAR That his ambitions were fulfilled in
having compelled his Enemies to ask Peace from him in their own Capital
with the Chancellor of Bohemia Harrach typifying fallen Austrian
pride obliged to cooperate

That he would always be attached to our Kings interests and set
all the value in the world on his friendship but that he had not been
sufficiently assisted to be content That observing henceforth an
exact neutrality he might be enabled to do offices of mediation and to
carry to the one side and to the other words of peace That he offered
himself for that object and would be charmed to help in it but that he
was fixed to stop there That in regard to the basis of General Peace
he had Two Ideas which the reader can attend to and see where they
differed from the Event and where notOne was That France should
keep Ypres Furnes Tournay which France did not giving up the
Netherlands otherwise with Ostend to the English to the English
in exchange for Cape Breton The other was To give up more of our
Conquests we gave them all up and got only the glory and our
Codfishery Cape Breton back the English being equally generous and
bargain for liberty to reestablish Dunkirk in its old condition not
a word of your Dunkirk there is your Cape Breton and we also will go
home with what glory there isnot difficult to carry But that it
was by England we must make the overtures without addressing ourselves
to the Court of Vienna and put it in his Friedrichs power to propose
a receivable Project of Peace That he well conceived the great point
was the Queen of Spain Termagant and Jenkinss Ear Termagants
Husband still living is a lappet of Termagants self but that she
must content herself with Parma and Piacenza for the Infant Don Philip
which the Termagant did and give back her hold of Savoy partial
hold of no use to her without the Passes to the King of Sardinia And
of the JENKINSSEAR question generous England will say nothing Next
to nothing hopes a modicum of putty and diplomatic varnish may close
that troublesome questionwhich springs meanwhile in the centre of
the world

These kind condescensions of his Majesty emboldened me to represent to
him the brilliant position he now held and how noble it would be
after having been the Hero of Germany to become instead of ones own
pacificator the Pacificator of Europe I grant you said he MON
CHER DArget but it is too dangerous a part for playing A reverse
brings me to the edge of ruin I know too well the mood of mind I
was in last time I left Berlin with that Threelegged Immensity of
Atropos NOT yet mown down at Hennersdorf by a lucky cut ever to
expose myself to it again If luck had been against me there I saw
myself a Monarch without throne and my subjects in the cruelest
oppression A bad game that always mere CHECK TO YOUR KING no other
moveI refer it to you friend DArgetin fine I wish to be at
peace

I represented to him that the House of Austria would never with a
tranquil eye see his House in possession of Silesia Those that come
after me said he will do as they like the Future is beyond mans
reach Those that come after will do as they can I have acquired it is
theirs to preserve I am not in alarm about the Austriansand this
is my answer to what you have been saying about the weakness of my
guarantees They dread my Army the luck that I have I am sure of
their sitting quiet for the dozen years or so which may remain to me of
lifequiet till I have most likely done with it What Are we never
to have any good of our life then NE DOISJE DONC JAMAIS JOUIR There
is more for me in the true greatness of laboring for the happiness of
my subjects than in the repose of Europe I have put Saxony out of a
condition to do hurt She owes 14775000 crowns of debt two millions
and a quarter sterling and by the Defensive Alliance which I form with
her I provide myself but ask Bruhl withal a help against Austria I
would not henceforth attack a cat except to defend myself These
are his very words adds DArgetand well worth noting Ambition
GLOIRE and my interests were the occasion of my first Campaigns
The late Kaisers situation and my zeal for France not to mention
interests again gave rise to these second and I have been fighting
always since for my own hearthsfor my very existence I might say
Once more I know the state I had got intoif I saw Prince Karl at
the gates of Paris I would not stirAnd us at the gates of Vienna
answered I promptly with the same indifferenceYes and I swear
it to you DArget In a word I want to have some good of my life VEUX
JOUIR What are we poor human atoms to get up projects that cost so
much blood Let us live and help to live

The rest of the conversation passed in general talk about Literature
Theatres and such objects My reasonings and objectings on the great
matter I need not farther detail by the frank discourse his Prussian
Majesty was kind enough to go into you may gather perhaps that my
arguments were various and not illchosenand it is too evident they
have all been in vainYour Excellencys really in a very faithful

January 1746 had some title Secretary at Orders SECRETAIRE DES
COMMANDEMENTS bit of pension and continued in the character of
reader or miscellaneous literary attendant and agent very much liked
by his Master for six years coming A man much heard of during those
years of office March 1752 having lost his dear little Prussian Wife
and got into ill health and spirits he retired on leave to Paris and
next year had to give up the thought of returningthough he still and
to the end continued loyally attached to his old Master and more
or less in correspondence with him Had got before long not through
Friedrichs influence at Paris some small Appointment in the ECOLE

with the exception of DArgens alone the most honesthearted The above

DE LECOLE MILITAIRE till 1778 and seems of all the ExPrussian
Frenchmen to have known most about Friedrich and to have never spoken
any falsity against him Duvernet the M Biographer of VOLTAIRE
frequented him a good deal and any true notions or glimmerings of
such that he has about Prussia are probably ascribable to DArget

CORRESPONDENCE there

The Treaty of Dresden can be read in Scholl Flassan Rousset Adelung
but except on compulsion no creature will now read itnor did this
Editor even he find it pay Peace is made Peace of Dresden is signed
Christmas Day 1745 To me Silesia without farther treachery or trick
you wholly as you were Europe at large as Friedrich had done sees
the sky all on fire about Dresden The fierce big battles done against
this man have one and all of them become big defeats The strenuous
machinations highbuilt plans cunningly devisedthe utmost sumtotal
of what the Imperial and Royal Potencies can for the life of them do
behold it has all tumbled down here in loud crash the final peal of
it at Kesselsdorf and the consummation is flame and smoke conspicuous
over all the Nations You will let him keep his own henceforth then
will you Silesia which was NOT yours nor ever shall be Silesia and
no afterthought The Saxons sign the high Plenipotentiaries all in the
eyes of Villiers I am told were seen sublimely pious tears
Harrach bowing with stiff almost incredulous gratitude swears and
signshurries home to his Sovereign Lady with Peace and such a smile
on his face and on her Imperial Majestys such a smilereaders shall
conceive it

There are but Two new points in the Treaty of Dresdennay properly
there is but One point about which posterity can have the least care
or interest for that other concerning The Toll of Schidlo and
settlement of haggles on the Navigation of the Elbe there was not
kept by the Saxons but continued a haggle still this One point is
the Eleventh Article Inconceivably small but liable to turn up on
us again in a memorable manner That let us translatefor M
de Voltaires sake and time coming STEUER means LandTax
OBERSTEUEREINNAHME will be something like Royal Exchequer therefore
and STEUERSCHEIN will be approximately equivalent to Exchequer Bill
Article Eleventh stipulates

All subjects and servants of his Majesty the King of Prussia who hold
bonds of the Saxon OBERSTEUEREINNAHME shall be paid in full capital
and interest at the times and to the amount specified in said
STEUERSCHEINE or Bonds That is Article EleventhThe Saxon
Exchequer says an old Note on it thanks to Bruhls extravagance has
been as good as bankrupt paying with inconvertible paper with SCHEINE
Things to be SHOWN for some time past which paper has accordingly
sunk let us say 25 per cent below its nominal amount in gold All
Prussian subjects who hold these Bonds are to be paid in gold Saxons
and others will have to be content with paper till things come round
again if things ever do Yesand by ill chance the matter will
attract M de Voltaires keen eye in the interim

Friedrich stayed eight days in Dresden the loud theme of Gazetteers and
rumors the admired of two classes in all Countries of the many who
admire success and also of the few who can understand what it is to
deserve success Among his own Countrymen this last Winter has kindled
all their admirations to the flaming pitch Saved by him from imminent
destruction their enemies swept home as if by one invincible nay sent
home in a kind of noble shame conquered by generosity These feelings
though not encouraged to speak run very high The Dresdeners in private
society found him delightful the high ladies especially Could you
have thought it terrific Mars to become radiant Apollo in this manner
From considerable Collections of Anecdotes illustrating this fact in a
way now fallen vapid to usI select only the Introduction

Do readers recollect Friedrichs first visit to Dresden in 1728
seventeen years ago and a certain charming young Countess Flemming
at that time only fourteen who like a Hebe as she was contrived
beautiful surprises for him and among other things presented him so
gracefully on the part of August the Strong with his first fluteNo
reader of this History can recollect it nor indeed except in a
mythic sense believe it A young Countess Flemming daughter of old
Feldmarschall Flemming doubtless there might be who presented him a
flute but as to HIS FIRST flute That same charming young Countess
Flemming is still here age now thirtyone charming more than ever
though now under a changed name having wedded a Von Racknitz Supreme
GentlemanUsher or some such thing a few years ago and brought him
children and the usual felicities How much is changed August the
Strong where is he and his famous Three Hundred and Fiftyfour
Enchantress Orzelska and the others where are they Enchantress
Orzelska wedded quarrelled and is in a convent her charming destiny
concluded Rutowski is not now in the Prussian Army he got beaten
Wednesday last at Kesselsdorf fighting against that Army And the
Chevalier de Saxe he too was beaten thereclambering now across the
Metal Mountains ask not of him And the Marechal de Saxe he takes
Cities fights Battles of Fontenoy mumbling a lead bullet all day
being dropsical nearly dead of debaucheries the most dissolute or
probably so of all the Sons of Adam in his day August the Physically
Strong is dead August the Spiritually Weak is fled to Prag with his
Bruhl And we do not come this time to get a flute but to settle
the account of Victories and give Peace to Nations Strange here as
always to look backto look round or forwardin the mad huge whirl
of that loudroaring Loom of TimeOne of Countess Racknitzs
Sons happened to leave MANUSCRIPT DIARIES rather feeble not too
exactlooking and gives us from Mammas reminiscences Not a word

The Peace we said was signed on Christmasday Next day Sunday
Friedrich attended Sermon in the Kreuzkirche Protestant HighChurch of
Dresden attended Opera withal and on Monday morning had vanished
out of Dresden as all his people had done or were diligently doing
Tuesday he dined briefly at Wusterhausen a place we once knew well
with the Prince of Prussia whose it now is got into his open carriage
again with the said Prince and his other Brother Ferdinand and drove
swiftly homeward Berlin drunk with joy was all out on the streets
waiting On the Heath of Britz four or five miles hitherward of Berlin
a body of young gentlemen Merchants mostly who had ridden out so
far saluted him with VIVAT FRIEDRICH DER GROSSE Long live Friedrich

streets Population vigorously shouting Pupils of the Koln Gymnasium
