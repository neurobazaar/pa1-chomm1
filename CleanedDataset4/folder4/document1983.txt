MONSIEUR BEAUCAIRE


by Booth Tarkington




Chapter One


The young Frenchman did very well what he had planned to do His guess
that the Duke would cheat proved good As the unshod halfdozen figures
that had been standing noiselessly in the entryway stole softly into the
shadows of the chamber he leaned across the table and smilingly plucked
a card out of the big Englishmans sleeve

Merci M le Duc he laughed rising and stepping back from the table

The Englishman cried out It means the dirty work of silencing you with
my bare hands and came at him

Do not move said M Beaucaire so sharply that the other paused
Observe behind you

The Englishman turned and saw what trap he had blundered into then
stood transfixed impotent alternately scarlet with rage and white
with the vital shame of discovery M Beaucaire remarked indicating the
silent figures by a polite wave of the hand Is it not a compliment
to monsieur that I procure six large men to subdue him They are quite
devote to me and monsieur is alone Could it be that he did not wish
even his lackeys to know he play with the yong Frenchman who Meestaire
Nash does not like in the pomproom Monsieur is unfortunate to have
come on foot and alone to my apartment

The Dukes mouth foamed over with chaotic revilement His captor
smiled brightly and made a slight gesture as one who brushes aside
a boisterous insect With the same motion he quelled to stony quiet a
resentful impetus of his servants toward the Englishman

Its murder is it you carrion finished the Duke

M Beaucaire lifted his shoulders in a mock shiver What words No no
no No killing A such word to a such host No no not murrder only
disgrace He laughed a clear light laugh with a rising inflection
seeming to launch himself upon an adventurous quest for sympathy

You little devilish scullion spat out the Duke

Tut tut But I forget Monsieur has pursue his studies of deportment
amongs his fellowcountrymen

Do you dream a soul in Bath will take your word that Ithat I

That M le Duc de Winterset had a card up his sleeve

You pitiful stroller you stableboy born in a stable

Is it not an honor to be born where monsieur must have been bred

You scurvy footboy you greasy barber you cutthroat groom

Overwhelm The young man bowed with imperturbable elation M le Duc
appoint me to all the office of his househol

You mustachioed fool there are not five people of quality in Bath will
speak to you

No monsieur not on the parade but how many come to play with me
here Because I will play always night or day for what one will for
any long and always fair monsieur

You outrageous varlet Every one knows you came to England as the
French Ambassadors barber What man of fashion will listen to you Who

entrance Francois So now we shall talk Monsieur I wish you to think
very cool Then listen I will be briefly It is that I am well known to

but fair always fair every one say that Is it not so Think of it
Andis there never a wisper come to M le Duc that not all people
belief him to play always hones Ha ha Did it almos be said to
him las year after when he play with Milor Tappinford at the
chocolatehouse

You dirty scandalmonger the Duke burst out Ill

Monsieur monsieur said the Frenchman It is a poor valor to insult
a helpless captor Can he retort upon his own victim But it is for you
to think of what I say True I am not reconize on the parade that my
friens who come here do not present me to their ladies that Meestaire
Nash has reboff me in the pomproom still am I not known for being
hones and fair in my play and will I not be belief even I when I

of it You are a noble and there will be some hangdogs who might not
fall away from you Only such would be lef to you Do you want it tol
And you can keep out of France monsieur I have lef his service but
I have still the ear of M de Mirepoix and he know I never lie Not a
gentleman will play you when you come to Paris

The Englishmans white lip showed a row of scarlet dots upon it How
much do you want he said

The room rang with the gay laughter of Beaucaire I hol your note for
sevenhunder pound You can have them monsieur Why does a such great
man come to play M Beaucaire Because no one else willin to play M
le Duche cannot pay Ha ha So he come to good Monsieur Beaucaire
Money ha ha What I want with money

His Grace of Wintersets features were set awry to a sinister pattern
He sat glaring at his companion in a snarling silence

Money Pouf snapped the little gambler No no no It is that M
le Duc impoverish somewhat in a bad odor as he is yet command the
entree anywhereonless IHa ha Eh monsieur

Ha You dare think to force me

M Beaucaire twirled the tip of his slender mustache around the end
of his white forefinger Then he said Monsieur and me goin to Lady
Malbournes ball tonightM le Duc and me

The Englishman roared Curse your impudence

Sit quiet Oh yes thats all we goin together

No

Certain I make all my little plan Tis all arrange He paused and

Bath society I should have cartels from the fathers brothers and
lovers of every wench and madam in the place even I You would be
thrust from Lady Malbournes door five minutes after you entered it

No no no

Half the gentlemen in Bath have been here to play They would know

Guilford and Townbrake They would have you lashed by the grooms as
your ugly deserts are You to speak to Lady Mary Carlisle Ods blood
You Also dolt she would know you if you escaped the others She stood
within a yard of you when Nash expelled you the pumproom

M Beaucaire flushed slightly You think I did not see he asked

Do you dream that because Winterset introduces a low fellow he will be
toleratedthat Bath will receive a barber

I have the distinction to call monsieurs attention replied the young
man gayly I have renounce that profession

Fool

nothing to worry you nothing in the worl I am goin to assassinate my
poor mustachioalso remove this horrible black peruke and emerge in my
own hair Behol He swept the heavy curled mass from his head as he
spoke and his hair coiled under the great wig fell to his shoulders
and sparkled yellow in the candlelight He tossed his head to shake the
hair back from his cheeks When it is dress I am transform nobody can
know me you shall observe See how little I ask of you how very little
bit No one shall reconize M Beaucaire or Victor Ha ha Tis all

natural you should attemp a little avengement for the rascal trap I
was such a wicked fellow as to set for you I shall meet some strange
friens of yours after tonight not so I must try to be not too much
frighten He looked at the Duke curiously You want to know why I
create this tragedy why I am so unkind as to entrap monsieur

His Grace of Winterset replied with a chill glance a pulse in the
noblemans cheek beat less relentlessly his eye raged not so bitterly
the steady purple of his own color was returning his voice was less
hoarse he was regaining his habit Tis ever the manner of the
vulgar he observed to wish to be seen with people of fashion

Oh no no no The Frenchman laughed Tis not that Am I not
already one of these men of fashion I lack only the reputation of
birth Monsieur is goin supply that Ha ha I shall be noble from
tonight Victor the artis is condemn to death his throat shall
be cut with his own razor M Beaucaire Here the young man sprang
to his feet caught up the black wig clapped into it a dicebox
from the table and hurled it violently through the open door M
Beaucaire shall be choke with his own dicebox Who is the Phoenix to
remain What advantage have I not over other men of rank who are merely
born to it I may choose my own No Choose for me monsieur Shall I
be chevalier comte vicomte marquis what None Out of compliment to
monsieur can I wish to be anything he is not No no I shall be M
le Duc M le Duc dede Chateaurien Ha ha You see You are my
confrere

M Beaucaire trod a dainty step or two waving his hand politely to the
Duke as though in invitation to join the celebration of his rank
The Englishman watched his eye still and harsh already gathering in
craftiness Beaucaire stopped suddenly But how I forget my age I am
twentythree he said with a sigh I rejoice too much to be of the
quality It has been too great for me and I had always belief myself
free of such ambition I thought it was enough to behol the opera
without wishing to sing but no England have teach me I have those
vulgar desire Monsieur I am goin tell you a secret the ladies of
your country are very diffrunt than ours One may adore the demoiselle

one among these starsah yes there is onethe poor Frenchman has
observe from his humble distance even there he could bask in the
glowing M Beaucaire turned to the window and looked out into the
dark He did not see the lights of the town When he turned again he
had half forgotten his prisoner other pictures were before him

Ah what radiance he cried Those people up over the sky they want
to show they wish the earth to be happy so they smile and make this
lady Goldhaired an angel of heaven and yet a Diana of the chase I
see her fly by me on her great horse one day she touch his mane with
her fingers I buy that clipping from the groom I have it here with my

Chapter Two


The chairmen swarmed in the street at Lady Malbournes door where the
joyous vulgar fought with muddied footmen and tipsy linkboys for places
of vantage whence to catch a glimpse of quality and of raiment at its
utmost Dawn was in the east and the guests were departing Singly or
in pairs glittering in finery they came mincing down the steps the
ghost of the nights smirk fading to jadedness as they sought the dark
recesses of their chairs From within sounded the twang of fiddles still
swinging manfully at it and the windows were bright with the light of
many candles When the door was flung open to call the chair of Lady
Mary Carlisle there was an eager pressure of the throng to see

A small fair gentleman in white satin came out upon the steps turned
and bowed before a lady who appeared in the doorway a lady whose royal
loveliness was given to view for a moment in that glowing frame The
crowd sent up a hearty English cheer for the Beauty of Bath

The gentleman smiled upon them delightedly What enchanting people he
cried Why did I not know so I might have shout with them The
lady noticed the people not at all whereat being pleased the people
cheered again The gentleman offered her his hand she made a slow
courtesy placed the tips of her fingers upon his own I am honored M
de Chateaurien she said

No no he cried earnestly Behol a poor Frenchman whom emperors
should envy Then reverently and with the pride of his gallant office
vibrant in every line of his slight figure invested in white satin and
very grand as he had prophesied M le Duc de Chateaurien handed Lady
Mary Carlisle down the steps an achievement which had figured in the
ambitions of seven other gentlemen during the evening

Am I to be lefin such onhappiness he said in a low voice That rose
I have beg for so long


Never said Lady Mary

Ah I do not deserve it I know so well But

Never

It is the greatness of my onworthiness that alone can claim your
charity let your kin heart give this little red rose this great alms
to the poor beggar

Never

She was seated in the chair Ah give the rose he whispered Her
beauty shone dazzlingly on him out of the dimness

Never she flashed defiantly as she was closed in Never

Never

The rose fell at his feet


A rose lasts till morning said a voice behind him

Turning M de Chateaurien looked beamingly upon the face of the Duke of
Winterset

Tis already the daylight he replied pointing to the east
Monsieur was it not enough honor for you to han out madame the aunt
of Lady Mary Lady Rellerton retain much trace of beauty Tis strange
you did not appear more happy

The rose is of an unlucky color I think observed the Duke

The color of a blush my brother

Unlucky I still maintain said the other calmly

The color of the veins of a Frenchman Ha ha cried the young man
What price would be too high A rose is a rose A goodnight my
brother a goodnight I wish you dreams of roses red roses only
beautiful red red roses

Stay Did you see the look she gave these street folk when they shouted
for her And how are you higher than they when she knows As high as
yonder horseboy

Red roses my brother only roses I wish you dreams of red red
roses


Chapter Three


It was well agreed by the fashion of Bath that M le Duc de Chateaurien
was a person of sensibility and haut ton that his retinue and equipage
surpassed in elegance that his person was exquisite his manner
engaging In the company of gentlemen his ease was slightly tinged with
graciousness his single equal in Bath being his Grace of Winterset
but it was remarked that when he bowed over a ladys hand his air
bespoke only a gay and tender reverence

He was the idol of the dowagers within a week after his appearance
matrons warmed to him young belles looked sweetly on him while the
gentlemen were won to admiration or envy He was of prodigious wealth
old Mr Bicksit who dared not for his fames sake fail to have seen
all things had visited Chateaurien under the present Dukes father
and descanted to the curious upon its grandeurs The young noble had one
fault he was so poor a gambler He cared nothing for the hazards of a
die or the turn of a card Gayly admitting that he had been born with no
spirit of adventure in him he was sure he declared that he failed of
much happiness by his lack of taste in such matters

But he was not long wanting the occasion to prove his taste in the
matter of handling a weapon A certain ledcaptain Rohrer by
name notorious amongst other things for bearing a dexterous and
bloodthirsty blade came to Bath posthaste one night and jostled
heartily against him in the pumproom on the following morning M
de Chauteaurien bowed and turned aside without offense continuing a
conversation with some gentlemen near by Captain Rohrer jostled
against him a second time M de Chateaurien looked him in the eye and
apologized pleasantly for being so much in the way Thereupon Rohrer
procured an introduction to him and made some observations derogatory
to the valor and virtue of the French There was current a curious piece
of gossip of the French court a prince of the blood royal grandson of
the late Regent and second in the line of succession to the throne
of France had rebelled against the authority of Louis XV who had
commanded him to marry the Princess Henriette cousin to both of them
The princess was reported to be openly devoted to the cousin who refused
to accept her hand at the bidding of the king and as rumor ran the
princes caprice elected in preference the discipline of Vincennes to
which retirement the furious king had consigned him The story was the
staple gossip of all polite Europe and Captain Rohrer having in his
mind a purpose to make use of it in leading up to a statement that
should be general to the damage of all Frenchwomen and which a
Frenchman might not pass over as he might a jog of the elbow repeated
it with garbled truths to make a scandal of a story which bore none on a
plain relation

He did not reach his deduction M de Chateaurien breaking into his
narrative addressed him very quietly Monsieur he said none but
swine deny the nobleness of that good and gentle lady Mademoiselle la
Princesse de BourbonConti Every Frenchman know that her cousin is a
bad rebel and ingrate who had only honor and rispec for her but was
so wilful he could not let even the king say You shall marry here
you shall marry there My friens the young man turned to the others
may I ask you to close roun in a circle for one moment It is clearly
shown that the Duke of Orleans is a scurvy fellow but not he wheeled
about and touched Captain Rohrer on the brow with the back of his gloved
handbut not so scurvy as thou thou swine of the gutter

Two hours later with perfect ease he ran Captain Rohrer through the
left shoulderafter which he sent a basket of red roses to the Duke
of Winterset In a few days he had another captain to fight This was
a ruffling buck who had the astounding indiscretion to proclaim M
de Chateaurien an impostor There was no Chateaurien he swore The
Frenchman laughed in his face and at twilight of the same day pinked
him carefully through the right shoulder It was not that he could
not put aside the insult to himself he declared to Mr Molyneux
his second and the few witnesses as he handed his wet sword to his
lackeyone of his station could not be insulted by a doubt of that
stationbut he fought in the quarrel of his friend Winterset This
rascal had asserted that M le Duc had introduced an impostor Could he
overlook the insult to a friend one to whom he owed his kind reception
in Bath Then bending over his fallen adversary he whispered Naughty
man tell your master find some better quarrel for the nex he sen
agains me

The conduct of M de Chateaurien was pronounced admirable

There was no surprise when the young foreigner fell naturally into the
long train of followers of the beautiful Lady Mary Carlisle nor was
there great astonishment that he should obtain marked favor in her eyes
shown so plainly that my Lord Townbrake Sir Hugh Guilford and the rich
Squire Bantison all of whom had followed her through three seasons
swore with rage and his Grace of Winterset stalked from her aunts
house with black brows

Meeting the Duke there on the evening after his second encounter de
Chateaurien smiled upon him brilliantly It was badly done oh so
badly he whispered Can you afford to have me strip of my mask by
any but yourself You who introduce me They will say there is some
bad scandal that I could force you to be my godfather You mus get the
courage yourself

I told you a rose had a short life was the answer

Oh those roses Tis the very greates rizzon to gather each day
a fresh one He took a red bud from his breast for an instant and
touched it to his lips

M de Chateaurien It was Lady Marys voice she stood at a table
where a vacant place had been left beside her M de Chateaurien we
have been waiting very long for you

The Duke saw the look she did not know she gave the Frenchman and he
lost countenance for a moment

We approach a climax eh monsieur said M de Chateaurien



Chapter Four


There fell a clear September night when the moon was radiant over town
and country over cobbled streets and winding roads From the fields the
mists rose slowly and the air was mild and fragrant while distances
were white and full of mystery All of Bath that pretended to fashion or
condition was present that evening at a fete at the house of a country
gentleman of the neighborhood When the stately junket was concluded it
was the pleasure of M de Chateaurien to form one of the escort of Lady
Marys carriage for the return As they took the road Sir Hugh Guilford
and Mr Bantison engaging in indistinct but vigorous remonstrance with
Mr Molyneux over some matter fell fifty or more paces behind where
they continued to ride keeping up their argument Half a dozen other
gallants rode in advance muttering among themselves or attended laxly
upon Lady Marys aunt on the other side of the coach while the happy
Frenchman was permitted to ride close to that adorable window which
framed the fairest face in England

He sang for her a little French song a song of the voyageur who dreamed
of home The lady listening looking up at the bright moon felt a warm
drop upon her cheek and he saw the tears sparkling upon her lashes

Mademoiselle he whispered then I too have been a wanderer but my
dreams were not of France no I do not dream of that home of that dear
country It is of a dearer country a dream countrya country of gold
and snow he cried softly looking it her white brow and the fair
lightly powdered hair above it Gold and snow and the blue sky of a
ladys eyes

I had thought the ladies of France were dark sir

Cruel It is that she will not understan Have I speak of the ladies
of France No no no It is of the faires country yes tis a
province of heaven mademoiselle Do I not renounce my allegiance to
France Oh yes I am subjecno content to be slavein the lan of
the blue sky the gold and the snow

A very pretty figure answered Lady Mary her eyes downcast But does
it not hint a notable experience in the making of such speeches

Tormentress No It prove only the inspiration it is to know you

We English ladies hear plenty of the like sir and we even grow
brilliant enough to detect the assurance that lies beneath the
courtesies of our own gallants

Merci I should believe so ejaculated M de Chateaurien but he
smothered the words upon his lips

Her eyes were not lifted She went on We come in time to believe
that true feeling comes faltering forth not glibly that smoothness
betokens the adept in the art sir rather than your trueyour true
She was herself faltering more blushing deeply and halting to a full
stop in terror of a word There was a silence

Yourtruelover he said huskily When he had said that word both
trembled She turned half away into the darkness of the coach

I know what make you to doubt me he said faltering himself though
it was not his art that prompted him They have tol you the French
do nothing always but make love is it not so Yes you think I am like
that You think I am like that now

She made no sign

I suppose he sighed I am unriznable I would have the snow not so
colfor jus me

She did not answer

Turn to me he said

The fragrance of the fields came to them and from the distance the
faint clear note of a huntinghorn

Turn to me

The lovely head was bent very low Her little gloved hand lay upon the
narrow window ledge He laid his own gently upon it The two hands were
shaking like twin leaves in the breeze Hers was not drawn away After
a pause neither knew how long he felt the warm fingers turn and clasp
themselves tremulously about his own At last she looked up bravely and
met his eyes The horn was wound againnearer

All the cold was gone from the snowslong ago she said

My beautiful he whispered it was all he could say My beautiful
But she clutched his arm startled

Ware the road A wild halloo sounded ahead The horn wound loudly
Ware the road There sprang up out of the night a flying thunder of
hoofbeats The gentlemen riding idly in front of the coach scattered to
the hedgesides and with drawn swords flashing in the moon a party of
horsemen charged down the highway their cries blasting the night

Barber Kill the barber they screamed Barber Kill the barber

Beaucaire had but time to draw his sword when they were upon him

A moi his voice rang out clearly as he rose in his stirrups A moi
Francois Louis Berquin A moi Francois

The cavaliers came straight at him He parried the thrust of the first
but the shock of collision hurled his horse against the side of the
coach Sacred swine he cried bitterly To endanger a lady to make
this brawl in a ladys presence Drive on he shouted

No cried Lady Mary

The Frenchmans assailants were masked but they were not highwaymen
Barber Barber they shouted hoarsely and closed in on him in a
circle

See how he use his steel laughed M Beaucaire as his point passed
through a tawdry waistcoat For a moment he cut through the ring and
cleared a space about him and Lady Mary saw his face shining in the
moonlight Canaille he hissed as his horse sank beneath him and
though guarding his head from the rain of blows from above he managed
to drag headlong from his saddle the man who had hamstrung the poor
brute The fellow came suddenly to the ground and lay there

Is it not a compliment said a heavy voice to bring six large men to
subdue monsieur

Oh you are there my frien In the reara little in the rear I
think Ha ha

The Frenchmans play with his weapon was a revelation of skill the more
extraordinary as he held in his hand only a light dress sword But the
ring closed about him and his keen defense could not avail him for more
than a few moments Lady Marys outriders the gallants of her escort
rode up close to the coach and encircled it not interfering

Sir Hugh Guilford cried Lady Mary wildly if you will not help him
give me your sword She would have leaped to the ground but Sir Hugh
held the door

Sit quiet madam he said to her then to the man on the box Drive
on

If he does Ill kill him she said fiercely Ah what cowards Will
you see the Duke murdered

The Duke laughed Guilford They will not kill him unlessbe easy
dear madam twill be explained Gads life he muttered to Molyneux
Twere time the varlet had his lashing Dye hear her

Barber or no barber answered Molyneux I wish I had warned him He
fights as few gentlemen could Ahah Look at that Tis a shame

On foot his hat gone his white coat sadly rent and gashed flecked
too with red M Beaucaire wary alert brilliant seemed to transform
himself into a dozen fencingmasters and though his skill appeared
to lie in delicacy and quickness his play being continually with
the point sheer strength failed to beat him down The young man was
laughing like a child

Believe me said Molyneux hes no barber No and never was

For a moment there was even a chance that M Beaucaire might have the
best of it Two of his adversaries were prostrate more than one were
groaning and the indomitable Frenchman had actually almost beat off the
ruffians when by a trick he was overcome One of them dismounting
ran in suddenly from behind and seized his blade in a thick leather
gauntlet Before Beaucaire could disengage the weapon two others threw
themselves from their horses and hurled him to the earth A moi A moi
Francois he cried as he went down his sword in fragments but his
voice unbroken and clear

Shame muttered one or two of the gentlemen about the coach

Twas dastardly to take him so said Molyneux Whatever his
deservings Im nigh of a mind to offer him a rescue in the Dukes
face

Truss him up lads said the heavy voice Clear the way in front of
the coach There sit those whom we avenge upon a presumptuous lackey
Now Whiffen you have a fair audience lay on and baste him

Two men began to drag M Beaucaire toward a great oak by the roadside
Another took from his saddle a heavy whip with three thongs

A moi Francois

There was borne on the breeze an answerMonseigneur Monseigneur
The cry grew louder suddenly The clatter of hoofs urged to an anguish
of speed sounded on the night M Beaucaires servants had lagged sorely
behind but they made up for it now Almost before the noise of their
own steeds they came riding down the moonlit aisle between the mists
Chosen men these servants of Beaucaire and like a thunderbolt they
fell upon the astounded cavaliers

Chateaurien Chateaurien they shouted and smote so swiftly that
through lack of time they showed no proper judgment discriminating
nothing between noncombatants and their masters foes They charged
first into the group about M Beaucaire and broke and routed it
utterly Two of them leaped to the young mans side while the other
four swerving scarce losing the momentum of their onset bore on upon
the gentlemen near the coach who went down beneath the fierceness of
the onslaught cursing manfully

Our just deserts said Mr Molyneux his mouth full of dust and
philosophy

Sir Hugh Guilfords horse fell with him being literally ridden over
and the baronets leg was pinned under the saddle In less than ten
minutes from the first attack on M Beaucaire the attacking party
had fled in disorder and the patrician noncombatants choking with
expletives consumed with wrath were prisoners disarmed by the
Frenchmans lackeys

Guilfords discomfiture had freed the doors of the coach so it was that
when M Beaucaire struggling to rise assisted by his servants threw
out one hand to balance himself he found it seized between two small
cold palms and he looked into two warm dilating eyes that were doubly
beautiful because of the fright and rage that found room in them too

M le Duc Chateaurien sprang to his feet without the aid of his lackeys
and bowed low before Lady Mary

I make ten thousan apology to be the cause of a such melee in your
presence he said and then turning to Francois he spoke in French
Ah thou scoundrel A little and it had been too late

Francois knelt in the dust before him Pardon he said Monseigneur
commanded us to follow far in the rear to remain unobserved The wind
malignantly blew against monseigneurs voice

See what it might have cost my children said his master pointing
to the ropes with which they would have bound him and to the whip lying
beside them A shudder passed over the lackeys frame the utter horror
in his face echoed in the eyes of his fellows

Oh monseigneur Francois sprang back and tossed his arms to heaven

But it did not happen said M Beaucaire

It could not exclaimed Francois

No And you did very well my children the young man smiled
benevolentlyvery well And now he continued turning to Lady Mary
and speaking in English let me be asking of our gallants yonder what
make them to be in cabal with highwaymen One should come to a polite
understanding with them you think Not so

He bowed offering his hand to conduct her to the coach where Molyneux
and his companions having drawn Sir Hugh from under his horse were
engaged in reviving and reassuring Lady Rellerton who had fainted But
Lady Mary stayed Beaucaire with a gesture and the two stood where they
were

Monseigneur she said with a note of raillery in her voice but
raillery so tender that he started with happiness His movement brought
him a hot spasm of pain and he clapped his hand to a red stain on his
waistcoat

You are hurt

It is nothing smiled M Beaucaire Then that she might not see
the stain spreading he held his handkerchief over the spot I am a
littlebut jus a triflingbruise tis all

You shall ride in the coach she whispered Will you be pleased M
de Chateaurien

Ah my beautiful She seemed to wave before him like a shining
mist I wish that ride might las for always Can you say that
mademoiselle

Monseigneur she cried in a passion of admiration I would what you
would have be should be What do you not deserve You are the bravest
man in the world

Ha ha I am jus a poor Frenchman

Would that a few Englishmen had shown themselves as poor tonight
The vile cowards not to help you With that suddenly possessed by her
anger she swept away from him to the coach

Sir Hugh groaning loudly was being assisted into the vehicle

My little poltroons she said what are you doing with your
fellowcraven Sir Hugh Guilford there

Madam replied Molyneux humbly Sir Hughs leg is broken Lady
Rellerton graciously permits him to be taken in

I do not permit it M de Chateaurien rides with us

But

Sir Leave the wretch to groan by the roadside she cried fiercely
which plight I would were that of all of you But there will be a
pretty story for the gossips tomorrow And I could almost find pity
for you when I think of the wits when you return to town Fine gentlemen
you hardy bravos by heaven to leave one man to meet a troop of horse
singlehanded while you huddle in shelter until you are overthrown and
disarmed by servants Oh the wits Heaven save you from the wits

Madam

Address me no more M de Chateaurien Lady Rellerton and I will
greatly esteem the honor of your company Will you come

She stepped quickly into the coach and was gathering her skirts to make
room for the Frenchman when a heavy voice spoke from the shadows of the
tree by the wayside

Lady Mary Carlisle will no doubt listen to a word of counsel on this
point

The Duke of Winterset rode out into the moonlight composedly untieing a
mask from about his head He had not shared the flight of his followers
but had retired into the shade of the oak whence he now made his
presence known with the utmost coolness

Gracious heavens tis Winterset exclaimed Lady Rellerton

Turned highwayman and cutthroat cried Lady Mary

No no laughed M Beaucaire somewhat unsteadily as he stood
swaying a little with one hand on the coachdoor the other pressed
hard on his side he only oversee he is jus a little bashful
sometime He is a great man but he don want all the glory

Barber replied the Duke I must tell you that I gladly descend to
bandy words with you your monstrous impudence is a claim to rank
I cannot ignore But a lackey who has himself followed by six other
lackeys

Ha ha Has not M le Duc been busy all this evening to justify me And
I think mine mus be the bes six Ha ha You think

M de Chateaurien said Lady Mary we are waiting for you

Pardon he replied He has something to say maybe it is bes if you
hear it now

I wish to hear nothing from himever

My faith madam cried the Duke this saucy fellow has paid you the
last insult He is so sure of you he does not fear you will believe the
truth When all is told if you do not agree he deserved the lashing we
planned to

Ill hear no more

You will bitterly repent it madam For your own sake I entreat

And I also broke in M Beaucaire Permit me mademoiselle let him
speak

Then let him be brief said Lady Mary for I am earnest to be quit of
him His explanation or an attack on my friend and on my carriage should
be made to my brother

Alas that he was not here said the Duke to aid me Madam was your
carriage threatened I have endeavored only to expunge a debt I owed to
Bath and to avenge an insult offered to yourself through

Sir sir my patience will bear little more

A thousan apology said M Beaucaire You will listen I only beg
Lady Mary

She made an angry gesture of assent

Madam I will be brief as I may Two months ago there came to Bath a
French gambler calling himself Beaucaire a desperate fellow with the
cards or dice and all the men of fashion went to play at his lodging
where he won considerable sums He was small wore a black wig and
mustachio He had the insolence to show himself everywhere until the
Master of Ceremonies rebuffed him in the pumproom as you know and
after that he forbore his visits to the rooms Mr Nash explained and
was confirmed madam by indubitable information that this Beaucaire
was a man of unspeakable vile low birth being in fact no other than
a lackey of the French kings ambassador Victor by name de Mirepoixs
barber Although his condition was known the hideous impudence of the
fellow did not desert him and he remained in Bath where none would
speak to him

Is your farrago nigh done sir

A few moments madam One evening three weeks gone I observed a very
elegant equipage draw up to my door and the Duke of Chateaurien was
announced The young mans manners were worthyaccording to the French
acceptanceand twere idle to deny him the most monstrous assurance He
declared himself a noble traveling for pleasure He had taken lodgings
in Bath for a season he said and called at once to pay his respects
to me His tone was so candidin truth I am the simplest of men very
easily gulledand his stroke so bold that I did not for one moment
suspect him and to my poignant regretthough in the humblest spirit
I have shown myself eager to atonethat very evening I had the shame of
presenting him to yourself

The shame sir

Have patience pray madam Ay the shame You know what figure he hath
cut in Bath since that evening All ran merrily with him until several
days ago Captain Badger denounced him as an impostor vowing that
Chateaurien was nothing

Pardon interrupted M Beaucaire Castle Nowhere would have been so
much better Why did you not make him say it that way monsieur

Lady Mary started she was looking at the Duke and her face was white
He continued Poor Captain Badger was stabbed that same day

Most befitting poor Captain Badger muttered Molyneux

And his adversary had the marvelous insolence to declare that he
fought in my quarrel This afternoon the wounded man sent for me and
imparted a very horrifying intelligence He had discovered a lackey whom
he had seen waiting upon Beaucaire in attendance at the door of
this Chateauriens lodging Beaucaire had disappeared the day before
Chateauriens arrival Captain Badger looked closely at Chateaurien at
their next meeting and identified him with the missing Beaucaire beyond
the faintest doubt Overcome with indignation he immediately proclaimed
the impostor Out of regard for me he did not charge him with being
Beaucaire the poor soul was unwilling to put upon me the humiliation of
having introduced a barber but the secret weighed upon him till he sent
for me and put everything in my hands I accepted the odium thinking
only of atonement I went to Sir John Wimpledons I took poor Sir
Hugh there and these other gentlemen aside and told them my news We
narrowly observed this man and were shocked at our simplicity in not
having discovered him before These are men of honor and cool judgment
madam Mr Molyneux had acted for him in the affair of Captain Badger
and was strongly prejudiced in his favor but Mr Molyneux Sir Hugh
Mr Bantison every one of them in short recognized him In spite of
his smooth face and his light hair the adventurer Beaucaire was
writ upon him amazing plain Look at him madam if he will dare the
inspection You saw this Beaucaire well the day of his expulsion from
the rooms Is not this he

M Beaucaire stepped close to her Her pale face twitched

Look he said

Oh oh she whispered with a dry throat and fell back in the
carriage

Is it so cried the Duke

I do not knowIcannot tell

One moment more I begged these gentlemen to allow me to wipe out the
insult I had unhappily offered to Bath but particularly to you They
agreed not to forestall me or to interfere I left Sir John Wimpledons
early and arranged to give the sorry rascal a lashing under your own
eyes a satisfaction due the lady into whose presence he had dared to
force himself

Noblesse oblige said M Beaucaire in a tone of gentle inquiry

And now madam said the Duke I will detain you not one second
longer I plead the good purpose of my intentions begging you to
believe that the desire to avenge a hateful outrage next to the wish to
serve you forms the dearest motive in the heart of Winterset

Bravo cried Beaucaire softly

Lady Mary leaned toward him a thriving terror in her eyes It is
false she faltered

Monsieur should not have been born so high He could have made little
book

You mean it is false she cried breathlessly

Ods blood is she not convinced broke out Mr Bantison Fellow
were you not the ambassadors barber

It is all false she whispered

The mos fine art mademoiselle How long you think it take M de
Winterset to learn that speech after he write it out It is a mix of
what is true and the mos chaste art Monsieur has become a man of
letters Perhaps he may enjoy that more than the wars Ha ha

Mr Bantison burst into a roar of laughter Do French gentlemen
fight lackeys Ho ho ho A pretty country We English do as was done
tonight have our servants beat them

And attend ourselves added M Beaucaire looking at the Duke
somewhat in the background But pardon he mocked that remind me
Francois return to Mr Bantison and these gentlemen their weapons

Will you answer a question said Molyneux mildly

Oh with pleasure monsieur

Were you ever a barber

No monsieur laughed the young man

Pah exclaimed Bantison Let me question him Now fellow a
confession may save you from jail Do you deny you are Beaucaire

Deny to a such judge

Ha said Bantison What more do you want Molyneux Fellow do you
deny that you came to London in the ambassadors suite

No I do not deny

He admits it Didnt you come as his barber

Yes my frien as his barber Lady Mary cried out faintly and
shuddering put both hands over her eyes

Im sorry said Molyneux You fight like a gentleman

I thank you monsieur

You called yourself Beaucaire

Yes monsieur He was swaying to and fro his servants ran to support
him

I wish continued Molyneux hesitating Evil take mebut Im
sorry youre hurt

Assist Sir Hugh into my carriage said Lady Mary

Farewell mademoiselle M Beaucaires voice was very faint His eyes
were fixed upon her face She did not look toward him

They were propping Sir Hugh on the cushions The Duke rode up close to
Beaucaire but Francois seized his bridle fiercely and forced the horse
back on its haunches

The mans servants worship him said Molyneux

Curse your insolence exclaimed the Duke How much am I to bear from
this varlet and his varlets Beaucaire if you have not left Bath by
tomorrow noon you will be clapped into jail and the lashing you
escaped tonight shall be given you thrice tenfold

I shall bein theAssemilyRoom at nineoclock one week
fromtonight answered the young man smiling jauntily though
his lips were colorless The words cost him nearly all his breath and
strength You mus keepin thebackgroun monsieur Ha ha The
door of the coach closed with a slam

Mademoisellefarewell

Drive on said Lady Mary

M Beaucaire followed the carriage with his eyes As the noise of the
wheels and the hoofbeats of the accompanying cavalcade grew fainter in
the distance the handkerchief he had held against his side dropped into
the white dust a heavy red splotch

Onlyroses he gasped and fell back in the arms of his servants


Chapter Five


Beau Nash stood at the door of the rooms smiling blandly upon a dainty
throng in the pink of its finery and gay furbelows The great exquisite
bent his body constantly in a series of consummately adjusted bows
before a great dowager seeming to sweep the floor in august deference
somewhat stately to the young bucks greeting the wits with gracious
friendliness and a twinkle of raillery inclining with fatherly
gallantry before the beauties the degree of his inclination measured
the altitude of the recipient as accurately as a nicely calculated
sandglass measures the hours

The King of Bath was happy for wit beauty fashionto speak more
concretely nobles belles gamesters beaux statesmen and poets
made fairyland or opera bouffe at least in his dominions play ran
higher and higher and Mr Nashs coffers filled up with gold To
crown his pleasure a prince of the French blood the young Comte de
Beaujolais just arrived from Paris had reached Bath at noon in state
accompanied by the Marquis de Mirepoix the ambassador of Louis XV The
Beau dearly prized the society of the lofty and the present visit was
an honor to Bath hence to the Master of Ceremonies What was better
there would be some profitable hours with the cards and dice So it was
that Mr Nash smiled never more benignly than on that bright evening
The rooms rang with the silvery voices of women and delightful laughter
while the fiddles went merrily their melodies chiming sweetly with the
joyance of his mood

The skill and brazen effrontery of the ambassadors scoundrelly servant
in passing himself off for a man of condition formed the point of
departure for every conversation It was discovered that there were but
three persons present who had not suspected him from the first and by
a singular paradox the most astute of all proved to be old Mr Bicksit
the traveler once a visitor at Chateaurien for he according to
report had by a coup of diplomacy entrapped the impostor into an
admission that there was no such place However like poor Captain
Badger the worthy old man had held his peace out of regard for the Duke
of Winterset This nobleman heretofore secretly disliked suspected
of irregular devices at play and never admired had won admiration and
popularity by his remorse for the mistake and by the modesty of his
attitude in endeavoring to atone for it without presuming upon the
privilege of his rank to laugh at the indignation of society an action
the more praiseworthy because his exposure of the impostor entailed the
disclosure of his own culpability in having stood the villains sponsor
Tonight the happy gentleman with Lady Mary Carlisle upon his arm
went grandly about the rooms sowing and reaping a harvest of smiles
Twas said work would be begun at once to rebuild the Dukes country
seat while several ruined Jews might be paid out of prison People
gazing on the beauty and the stately but modest hero by her side said
they would make a noble pair She had long been distinguished by his
attentions and he had come brilliantly out of the episode of the
Frenchman who had been his only real rival Wherever they went there
arose a buzz of pleasing gossip and adulation Mr Nash seeing them
near him came forward with greetings A word on the side passed between
the nobleman and the exquisite

I had news of the rascal tonight whispered Nash He lay at a farm
till yesterday when he disappeared his ruffians too

You have arranged asked the Duke

Fourteen bailiffs are watching without He could not come within
gunshot If they clap eyes on him they will hustle him to jail and his
cutthroats shall not avail him a hairs weight The impertinent swore
hed be here by nine did he

He said so and tis a rash dog sir

It is just nine now

Send out to see if they have taken him

Gladly

The Beau beckoned an attendant and whispered in his ear

Many of the crowd had edged up to the two gentlemen with apparent
carelessness to overhear their conversation Those who did overhear
repeated it in covert asides and this circulating undertone confirming
a vague rumor that Beaucaire would attempt the entrance that night lent
a pleasurable color of excitement to the evening The French prince the
ambassador and their suites were announced Polite as the assembly
was it was also curious and there occurred a mannerly rush to see the
newcomers Lady Mary already pale grew whiter as the throng closed
round her she looked up pathetically at the Duke who lost no time in
extricating her from the pressure

Wait here he said I will fetch you a glass of negus and
disappeared He had not thought to bring a chair and she looking about
with an increasing faintness and finding none saw that she was standing
by the door of a small sideroom The crowd swerved back for the passage
of the legate of France and pressed upon her She opened the door and
went in

The room was empty save for two gentlemen who were quietly playing
cards at a table They looked up as she entered They were M Beaucaire
and Mr Molyneux

She uttered a quick cry and leaned against the wall her hand to her
breast Beaucaire though white and weak had brought her a chair before
Molyneux could stir

Mademoiselle

Do not touch me she said with such frozen abhorrence in her voice
that he stopped short Mr Molyneux you seek strange company

Madam replied Molyneux bowing deeply as much to Beaucaire as to
herself I am honored by the presence of both of you

Oh are you mad she exclaimed contemptuously

This gentleman has exalted me with his confidence madam he replied

Will you add your ruin to the scandal of this fellows presence here
How he obtained entrance

Pardon mademoiselle interrupted Beaucaire Did I not say I should
come M Molyneux was so obliging as to answer for me to the fourteen
friens of M de Winterset and Meestaire Nash

Do you not know she turned vehemently upon Molyneux that he will be
removed the moment I leave this room Do you wish to be dragged out
with him For your sake sir because I have always thought you a man
of heart I give you a chance to save yourself from disgraceandyour
companion from jail Let him slip out by some retired way and you
may give me your arm and we will enter the next room as if nothing had
happened Come sir

Mademoiselle

Mr Molyneux I desire to hear nothing from your companion Had I not
seen you at cards with him I should have supposed him in attendance as
your lackey Do you desire to take advantage of my offer sir

Mademoiselle I could not tell you on that night

You may inform your highborn friend Mr Molyneux that I heard
everything he had to say that my pride once had the pleasure of
listening to his highborn confession

Ah it is gentle to taunt one with his birth mademoiselle Ah no
There is a man in my country who say strange things of thatthat a man
is not his father but himself

You may inform your friend Mr Molyneux that he had a chance to
defend himself against accusation that he said all

That I did say all I could have strength to say Mademoiselle you did
not seeas it was rightthat I had been stung by a big wasp It was
nothing a scratch but mademoiselle the sky went round and the moon
dance on the earth I could not wish that big wasp to see he had stung
me so I mus only say what I can have strength for and stand straight
till he is gone Beside there are other rizzons Ah you mus belief
My Molyneux I sen for and tell him all because he show courtesy
to the yong Frenchman and I can trus him I trus you
mademoisellelong agoand would have tol you evrything excep jus
becausewell for the romance the fon You belief It is so clearly
so you do belief mademoiselle

She did not even look at him M Beaucaire lifted his hand appealingly
toward her Can there be no faith ininhe said timidly and paused
She was silent a statue my Lady Disdain

If you had not belief me to be an impostor if I had never said I was
Chateaurien if I had been jus that Monsieur Beaucaire of the story
they tol you but never with the heart of a lackey an hones man a
man the man you knew himself could youwould you He was trying
to speak firmly yet as he gazed upon her splendid beauty he
choked slightly and fumbled in the lace at his throat with unsteady
fingersWould youhave let me ride by your side in the autumn
moonlight Her glance passed by him as it might have passed by a
footman or a piece of furniture He was dressed magnificently a
multitude of orders glittering on his breast Her eye took no knowledge
of him

MademoiselleI have the honor to ask you if you had known this
Beaucaire was hones though of peasant birth would you

Involuntarily controlled as her icy presence was she shuddered There
was a moment of silence

Mr Molyneux said Lady Mary in spite of your discourtesy in
allowing a servant to address me I offer you a last chance to leave
this room undisgraced Will you give me your arm

Pardon me madam said Mr Molyneux

Beaucaire dropped into a chair with his head bent low and his arm
outstretched on the table his eyes filled slowly in spite of himself
and two tears rolled down the young mans cheeks

An live men are jusnames said M Beaucaire



Chapter Six


In the outer room Winterset unable to find Lady Mary and supposing
her to have joined Lady Rellerton disposed of his negus then
approached the two visitors to pay his respects to the young prince
whom he discovered to be a stripling of seventeen arrogant looking
but pretty as a girl Standing beside the Marquis de Mirepoixa man of
quiet bearinghe was surrounded by a group of the great among whom Mr
Nash naturally counted himself The Beau was felicitating himself that
the foreigners had not arrived a week earlier in which case he and Bath
would have been detected in a piece of gross ignorance concerning the
French nobilitymaking much of de Mirepoixs exbarber

Tis a lucky thing that fellow was got out of the way he ejaculated
under cover

Thank me for it rejoined Winterset

An attendant begged Mr Nashs notice The head bailiff sent word that
Beaucaire had long since entered the building by a side door It was
supposed Mr Nash had known of it and the Frenchman was not arrested
as Mr Molyneux was in his company and said he would be answerable for
him Consternation was so plain on the Beaus trained face that the Duke
leaned toward him anxiously

The villains in and Molyneux hath gone mad

Mr Bantison who had been fiercely elbowing his way toward them joined
heads with them You may well say he is in he exclaimed and if you
want to know where why in yonder cardroom I saw him through the
halfopen door

Whats to be done asked the Beau

Send the bailiffs

Fie fie A file of bailiffs The scandal

Then listen to me said the Duke Ill select halfadozen gentlemen
explain the matter and well put him in the center of us and take him
out to the bailiffs Twill appear nothing Do you remain here and
keep the attention of Beaujolais and de Mirepoix Come Bantison fetch
Townbrake and Harry Rakell yonder Ill bring the others

Three minutes later his Grace of Winterset flung wide the cardroom
door and after his friends had entered closed it

Ah remarked M Beaucaire quietly Six more large men

The Duke seeing Lady Mary started but the angry signs of her
interview had not left her face and reassured him He offered his hand
to conduct her to the door May I have the honor

If this is to be known twill be better if I leave after I should be
observed if I went now

As you will madam he answered not displeased And now you
impudent villain he began turning to M Beaucaire but to fall back
astounded Ods blood the dog hath murdered and robbed some royal
prince He forgot Lady Marys presence in his excitement Lay hands on
him he shouted Tear those orders from him

Molyneux threw himself between One word he cried One word before
you offer an outrage you will repent all your lives

Or let M de Winterset come alone laughed M Beaucaire

Do you expect me to fight a cutthroat barber and with bare hands

I think one does not expec monsieur to fight anybody Would I fight
you you think That was why I had my servants that evening we play
I would gladly fight almos any one in the won but I did not wish to
soil my hand with a

Stuff his lying mouth with his orders shouted the Duke

But Molyneux still held the gentlemen back One moment he cried

M de Winterset said Beaucaire of what are you afraid You
calculate well Beaucaire might have been beliefan impostor that you
yourself expose Never But I was not goin reveal that secret You
have not absolve me of my promise

Tell what you like answered the Duke Tell all the wild lies
you have time for You have five minutes to make up your mind to go
quietly

Now you absolve me then Ha ha Oh yes Mademoiselle he bowed to
Lady Mary I have the honor to reques you leave the room You shall
miss no details if these friens of yours kill me on the honor of a
French gentleman

A French what laughed Bantison

Do you dare keep up the pretense cried Lord Town brake Know you
villain barber that your master the Marquis de Mirepoix is in the
next room

Molyneux heaved a great sigh of relief Shall I He turned to M
Beaucaire

The young man laughed and said Tell him come here at once

Impudent to the last cried Bantison as Molyneux hurried from the
room

Now you goin to see M Beaucaires master said Beaucaire to Lady
Mary Tis true what I say the other night I cross from Prance in his
suite my passport say as his barber Then to pass the ennui of exile I
come to Bath and play for what one will It kill the time But when the
people hear I have been a servant they come only secretly and there
is one of themhe has absolve me of a promise not to speakof him I
learn something he cannot wish to be tol I make some trouble to learn
this thing Why I should do this Wellthat is my own rizzon So I make
this man help me in a masque the unmasking it was for as there is no
one to know me I throw off my black wig and become myselfand so I
am Chateaurien Castle Nowhere Then this man I use this Winterset
he

I have great need to deny these accusations said the Duke

Nay said Lady Mary wearily

Shall I tell you why I mus be Victor and Beaucaire and
Chateaurien and not myself

To escape from the bailiffs for debts for razors and soap gibed Lord
Townbrake

No monsieur In France I have got a cousin who is a man with a very
bad temper at some time and he will never enjoy his relatives to do
what he does not wish

He was interrupted by a loud commotion from without The door was flung
open and the young Count of Beaujolais bounded in and threw his arms
about the neck of M Beaucaire

Philippe he cried My brother I have come to take you back with
me

M de Mirepoix followed him bowing as a courtier in deference but M
Beaucaire took both his hands heartily Molyneux came after with Mr
Nash and closed the door

My warmest felicitations said the Marquis There is no longer need
for your incognito

Thou best of masters said Beaucaire touching him fondly on the
shoulder I know Your courier came safely And so I am forgiven But
I forget He turned to the lady She had begun to tremble exceedingly
Faires of all the English fair he said as the gentlemen bowed low
to her deep courtesy I beg the honor to presen to Lady Mary Carlisle
M le Comte de Beaujolais M de Mirepoix has already the honor Lady
Mary has been very kind to me my friens you mus help me make my
acknowledgment Mademoiselle and gentlemen will you give me that favour
to detain you one instan

Henri he turned to the young Beaujolais I wish you had shared my
masqueI have been so gay The surface of his tone was merry but
there was an undercurrent wearysad to speak of what was the mood
not the manner He made the effect of addressing every one present but
he looked steadily at Lady Mary Her eyes were fixed upon him with a
silent and frightened fascination and she trembled more and more I am
a great actor Henri These gentlemen are yet scarce convince I am not
a lackey And I mus tell you that I was jus now to be expelled for
having been a barber

Oh no the ambassador cried out He would not be content with me
he would wander over a strange country

Ha ha my Mirepoix And what is better one evening I am oblige
to fight some friens of M de Winterset there and some ladies and
cavaliers look on and they still think me a servant Oh I am a great
actor Tis true there is not a peasant in France who would not have
then known one born but they are wonderful this English people
holding by an idea once it is in their headsa mos worthy quality But
my good Molyneux here he had speak to me with courtesy jus because
I am a man an jus because he is always kind I have learn that
his greatgrandfather was a Frenchman So I sen to him and tell him
evrything and he gain admittance for me here tonight to await my
friens

I was speaking to messieurs about my cousin who will meddle in the
affair of his relatives Well that gentleman he make a marriage for
me with a good and accomplish lady very noble and very beautifuland
amiable The young count at his elbow started slightly at this but
immediately appeared to wrap himself in a mantle of solemn thought
Unfortunately when my cousin arrange so I was a dolt a little
blockhead I swear to marry for myself and when I please or never if
I like That lady is all things charming and gentle and in truth she
isvery much attach to mewhy should I not say it I am so proud of
it She is very faithful and forgiving and sweet she would be the
same I think if Iwere evena lackey But I I was a dolt a little
unsensible brute I did not value such thing then I was too yong
las June So I say to my cousin No I make my own choosing Little
fool he answer she is the one for you Am I not wiser than you And
he was very angry and as he has influence in France word come that
he will get me put in Vincennes so I mus run away quick till his anger
is gone My good frien Mirepoix is jus leaving for London he take
many risk for my sake his hairdresser die before he start so I
travel as that poor barber But my cousin is a man to be afraid of when
he is angry even in England and I mus not get my Mirepoix in trouble
I mus not be discover till my cousin is ready to laugh about it all
and make it a joke And there may be spies so I change my name again
and come to Bath to amuse my retreat with a little gamingI am always
fond of that But three day ago M le Marquis send me a courier to say
that my brother who know where I had run away is come from France to
say that my cousin is appease he need me for his little theatre the
play cannot go on I do not need to espouse mademoiselle All shall be
forgiven if I return and my brother and M de Mirepoix will meet me in
Bath to felicitate

There is one more thing to say that is all I have said I learn a
secret and use it to make a man introduce me if I will not tell He has
absolve me of that promise My friens I had not the wish to ruin that
man I was not receive Meestaire Nash had reboff me I had no other
way excep to use this fellow So I say Take me to Lady Malbournes
ball as Chateaurien I throw off my wig and shave and behol I am
M le Duc de Castle Nowhere Ha ha You see

The young mans manner suddenly changed He became haughty menacing
He stretched out his arm and pointed at Winterset Now I am no
Beaucaire messieurs I am a French gentleman The man who introduce
me at the price of his honor and then betray me to redeem it is that
coward that cardcheat there

Winterset made a horrible effort to laugh The gentlemen who surrounded
him fell away as from pestilence A French gentleman he sneered
savagely and yet fearfully I dont know who you are Hide behind as
many toys and ribbons as you like Ill know the name of the man who
dares bring such a charge

Sir cried de Mirepoix sharply advancing a step towards him but he
checked himself at once He made a low bow of state first to the young
Frenchman then to Lady Mary and the company Permit me Lady Mary
and gentlemen he said to assume the honor of presenting you to His
Highness Prince LouisPhilippe de Valois Duke of Orleans Duke of
Chartres Duke of Nemours Duke of Montpetisier First Prince of
the Blood Royal First Peer of France LieutenantGeneral of French
Infantry Governor of Dauphine Knight of the Golden Fleece Grand
Master of the Order of Notre Dame of Mount Carmel and of St Lazarus
in Jerusalem and cousin to His most Christian Majesty Louis the
Fifteenth King of France

Those are a few of my brothers names whispered Henri of Beaujolais
to Molyneux Old Mirepoix has the long breath but it take a strong
man two day to say all of them I can suppose this Winterset know now
who bring the charge

Castle Nowhere gasped Beau Nash falling back upon the burly prop of
Mr Bantisons shoulder

The Duke of Orleans will receive a message from me within the hour
said Winterset as he made his way to the door His face was black with
rage and shame

I tol you that I would not soil my hand with you answered the young
man If you send a message no gentleman will bring it Whoever shall
bear it will receive a little beating from Francois

He stepped to Lady Marys side Her head was bent low her face averted
She seemed to breathe with difficulty and leaned heavily upon a chair
Monseigneur she faltered in a half whisper can youforgive me It
is a bittermistakeI have made Forgive

Forgive he answered and his voice was as broken as hers but he went
on more firmly It isnothingless than nothing There isonly jus
onein thewhole worl who would not have treat me the way that you
treat me It is to her that I am goin to make reparation You know
something Henri I am not goin back only because the king forgive
me I am goin to please him I am goin to espouse mademoiselle our
cousin My friens I ask your felicitations

And the king does not compel him exclaimed young Henri

Henri you want to fight me cried his brother sharply Don you
think the King of France is a wiser man than me

He offered his hand to Lady Mary Mademoiselle is fatigue Will she
honor me
