FLYING U RANCH



CHAPTER I The Coming of a Native Son

The Happy Family waiting for the Sunday supper call were grouped
around the open door of the bunkhouse gossiping idly of things purely
local when the Old Man returned from the Stock Association at Helena
beside him on the buggy seat sat a stranger The Old Man pulled up at
the bunkhouse the stranger sprang out over the wheel with the agility
which bespoke youthful muscles and the Old Man introduced him with a
quirk of the lips

This is Mr Miguell Rapponi boysa peeler straight from the Golden
Gate Throw out your warbag and make yourself to home Miguell some
of the boysll show you where to bed down

The Old Man drove on to the house with his own luggage and Happy Jack
followed to take charge of the team but the remainder of the Happy
Family unobtrusively took the measure of the foreign element From his
blackandwhite horsehair hatband with tassels that swept to the very
edge of his gray hatbrim to the crimson silk neckerchief draped over
the pale blue bosom of his shirt from the beautifully stamped leather
cuffs down to the exaggerated height of his tan bootheels their
critical eyes swept in swift appraising glances and unanimous
disapproval was the result The Happy Family had themselves an eye to
picturesque garb upon occasion but this passed even Pinks love of
display

Hes some gaudy to look at Irish murmured under his breath to Cal
Emmett

All he lacks is a spotlight and a brass band Cal returned in much
the same tone with which a woman remarks upon a last seasons hat on the
head of a rival

Miguel was not embarrassed by the inspection He was tall straight
and swarthily handsome and he stood with the complacence of a stage
favorite waiting for the applause to cease so that he might speak his
first lines and while he waited he sifted tobacco into a cigarette
paper daintily with his little finger extended There was a ring upon
that finger a ring with a moonstone setting as large and round as the
eye of a startled cat and the Happy Family caught the pale gleam of it
and drew a long breath He lighted a match nonchalantly by the artfully
simple method of pinching the head of it with his fingernails leaned
negligently against the wall of the bunkhouse and regarded the group
incuriously while he smoked

Any pretty girls up this way he inquired languidly after a moment
fanning a thin smokecloud from before his face while he spoke

The Happy Family went prickly hot The girls in that neighborhood were
held in esteem and there was that in his tone which gave offense

Sure theres pretty girls here Big Medicine bellowed unexpectedly
close beside him Were all of us engaged to em by cripes

Miguel shot an oblique glance at Big Medicine examined the end of his
cigarette and gave a lift of shoulder which might mean anything
or nothing and so was irritating to a degree He did not pursue the
subject further and so several belated retorts were left tickling
futilely the tongues of the Happy Familywhich does not make for
amiability

To a man they liked him little in spite of their easy friendliness with
mankind in general At supper they talked with him perfunctorily and
covertly sneered because he sprinkled his food liberally with cayenne
and his speech with Spanish words pronounced with soft slurred
vowels that made them sound unfamiliar and against which his English
contrasted sharply with its crisp American enunciation He met their
infrequent glances with the cool stare of absolute indifference to their
opinion of him and their perfunctory civility with introspective calm

The next morning when there was riding to be done and Miguel
appeared at the last moment in his working clothes even Weary the
sunnyhearted had an unmistakable curl of his lip after the first
glance

Miguel wore the hatband the crimson kerchief tied loosely with the
point draped over his chest the stamped leather cuffs and the tan boots
with the highest heels ever built by the cobbler craft Also the lower
half of him was incased in chaps the like of which had never before been
brought into Flying U coulee Black Angora chaps they were longhaired
crinkly to the very hide with three white diamondshaped patches
running down each leg of them and with the leather waistband stamped
elaborately to match the cuffs The bands of his spurs were two inches
wide and inlaid to the edge with beaten silver and each concho was
engraved to represent a large wild rose with a golden center A dollar
laid upon the rowels would have left a fringe of prongs all around

He bent over his sacked riding outfit and undid it revealing a
wonderful saddle of stamped leather inlaid on skirt and cantle with
more beaten silver He straightened the skirts carefully ignoring the
glances thrown in his direction and swore softly to himself when he
discovered where the leather had been scratched through the canvas
wrappings and the end of the silver scroll ripped up He drew out his
bridle and shook it into shape and the silver mountings and the reins
of braided leather with horsehair tassels made Happy Jacks eyes greedy
with desire His blanket was a scarlet Navajo and his rope a rawhide
lariat

Altogether his splendor when he was mounted so disturbed the fine
mental poise of the Happy Family that they left him jingling richly
off by himself while they rode closely grouped and discussed him
acrimoniously

By gosh a man might do worse than locate that Native Son for a silver
mine Cal began eyeing the interloper scornfully Its plumb wicked
to ride around with all that wealth and fussy stuff He must a robbed
a bank and put the money all into a riding outfit

By golly he looks to me like a pair uh trays when he comes bowleggin
along with them white diamonds on his legs Slim stated solemnly

And Ill gamble thats a spot higher than he stacks up in the cow
game Pink observed with the pessimism which matrimony had given him
You mind him asking about bad horses last night That Lizzieboy never
saw a bad horse they dont grow em where he come from What they dont
know about riding they make up for with a swell rig

And oh mamma It sure is a swell rig Weary paid generous tribute
Only I will say old Banjo reminds me of an Irish cook rigged out in
silk and diamonds That outfit on Glory now He sighed enviously

Well Ive gone up against a few real ones in my long and varied
career Irish remarked reminiscently and Ive noticed that a hoss
never has any respect or admiration for a swell rig When he gets real
busy it aint the silver filigree stuff thats going to help you hold
connections with your saddle and a silvermounted bridlebit aint a
darned bit better than a plain one

Just take a look at him cried Pink with intense disgust Ambling
off there so the sun can strike all that silver and bounce back in our
eyes And that braided lariatId sure love to see the pieces if he
ever tries to anchor anything bigger than a yearling

Why you dont think for a minute he could ever get out and rope
anything do yuh Irish laughed That there Native Son throws on
awltogether too much dog to really get out and do anything

Aw fleered Happy Jack he aint any Natiff Son Hes a dago

Hes got the earmarks uh both Big Medicine stated authoritatively I
know em by cripes and I know their ways He jerked his thumb toward
the dazzling Miguel I can tell yuh the kinda cowpuncher he is Ive
saw em workin at it Hawhawhaw Theyll start out to move ten or a
dozen head uh tame old cows from one field to another and therell be
six or eight fellers rigged up like this here trayspot ridin along
important as hell drivin them few cows down a lane with peach trees
on both sides by cripes jingling their big silver spurs all wearin
fancy chaps to ride four or five miles down the road Honest to grandma
they call that punchin cows Oh hes a Native Son all right Ive
saw lots of em only I never saw one so far away from the Promised Land
before That there looks queer to me Natiff Sonsthe real ones like
himare as scarce outside Calyforny as buffalo are right here in this
coulee

Thats the way they do it all right Irish agreed And then theyll
have a rodeo

Hawhawhaw Big Medicine interrupted and took up the tale which
might have been entitled Some Cowpunching I Have Seen

They have them rodeos on a Sunday mostly and they invite everybody to
it like it was a picnic And therell be two or three fellers to
every calf all lit up like Miguell over there in chaps and silver
fixins fussin around on horseback in a corral and every feller
trying to pile his rope on the same calf by cripes They stretch em
out with two ropescalves remember Little weenty fellers you could
pack under one arm Yuh cant blame em much They never have moren
thirty or forty head to brand at a time and they never git moren a
taste uh real work So they make the most uh what they git and go in
heavy on fancy outfits And this here silvermounted fellow thinks hes
a real cowpuncher by cripes

The Happy Family laughed at the idea laughed so loud that Miguel left
his lonely splendor and swung over to them ostensibly to borrow a
match

Whats the joke he inquired languidly his chin thrust out and his
eyes upon the match blazing at the end of his cigarette

The Happy Family hesitated and glanced at one another Then Cal spoke
truthfully

Youre it he said bluntly with a secret desire to test the temper of
this darkskinned son of the West

Miguel darted one of his swift glances at Cal blew out his match and
threw it away

Oh how funny Haha His voice was soft and absolutely
expressionless his face blank of any emotion whatever He merely spoke
the words as a machine might have done

If he had been one of them the Happy Family would have laughed at the
whimsical humor of it As it was they repressed the impulse though
Weary warmed toward him slightly

Dont you believe anything this innocenteyed gazabo tells you Mr
Rapponi he warned amiably Hes known to be a liar

Thats funny too Haha some more Miguel permitted a thin ribbon of
smoke to slide from between his lips and gazed off to the crinkled line
of hills

Sure it isnow you mention it Weary agreed after a perceptible
pause

How fortunate that I brought the humor to your attention drawled
Miguel in the same expressionless tone much as if he were reciting a
text

Virtue is its own penalty paraphrased Pink not stopping to see
whether the statement applied to the subject

Hawhawhaw roared Big Medicine quite as irrelevantly

Hehehe supplemented the silvertrimmed one

Big Medicine stopped laughing suddenly reined his horse close to the
other and stared at him challengingly with his pale protruding eyes
while the Happy Family glanced meaningly at one another Big Medicine
was quite as unsafe as he looked at that moment and they wondered if
the offender realized his precarious situation

Miguel smoked with the infinite leisure which is a fine art when it is
not born of genuine abstraction and none could decide whether he was
aware of the unfriendly proximity of Big Medicine Weary was just on the
point of saying something to relieve the tension when Miguel blew the
ash gently from his cigarette and spoke lazily

Parrots are so common out on the Coast that they use them in cheap
restaurants for stew Ive often heard them gabbling together in the
kettle

The statement was so ambiguous that the Happy Family glanced at him
doubtfully Big Medicines stare became more curious than hostile
and he permitted his horse to lag a length It is difficult to fight
absolute passivity Then Slim who ever tramped solidly over the flowers
of sarcasm blurted one of his unexpected retorts

I was just wonderin by golly where yuh learnt to talk

Miguel turned his velvet eyes sleepily toward the speaker From the
boarders who ate those parrots amigo he smiled serenely

At this Slimonce justly accused by Irish of being a singleshot
when it came to reparteeturned purple and dumb The Happy Family
forswearing loyalty in their enjoyment of his discomfiture grinned and
left to Miguel the barren triumph of the last word

He did not gain in popularity as the days passed They tilted noses at
his beautiful riding gear and would have died rather than speak of it
in his presence They never gossiped with him of horses or men or the
lands he knew They were ready to snub him at a moments noticeand
it did not lessen their dislike of him that he failed to yield them an
opportunity It is to be hoped that he found his thoughts sufficient
entertainment since he was left to them as much as is humanly possible
when half a dozen men eat and sleep and work together It annoyed them
exceedingly that Miguel did not seem to know that they held him at a
distance they objected to his manner of smoking cigarettes and staring
off at the skyline as if he were alone and content with his dreams When
he did talk they listened with an air of weary tolerance When he
did not talk they ignored his presence and when he was absent they
criticized him mercilessly

They let him ride unwarned into an adobe patch one dayat least Big
Medicine Pink Cal Emmett and Irish did for they were with himand
laughed surreptitiously together while he wallowed there and came out
afoot his horse floundering behind him mud to the ears both of them

Pretty soft going along there aint it Pink commiserated
deceitfully

It is kinda Miguel responded evenly scraping the adobe off Banjo
with a flat rock And the subject was closed

Well its some relief to the eyes to have the shine taken off him
anyway Pink observed a little guiltily afterward

I betche he aint goin to forget that though Happy Jack warned when
he saw the caked mud on Miguels Angora chaps and silver spurs and the
condition of his saddle Yuh better watch out and not turn your backs
on him in the dark none uh you guys I betche he packs a knife Them
kind always does

Hawhawhaw bellowed Big Medicine uproariously Id love to see him
git out an try to use it by cripes

I wish Andy was here Pink sighed Andyd take the starch outa him
all right

Wouldnt he be pickings for old Andy though Gee Cal looked around
at them with his wide babyblue eyes and laughed Lets kinda jolly
him along boys till Andy gets back It sure would be great to watch
em Ill bet he can jar the eternal calm outa that Native Son Thats
what grinds me worse than his throwin on so much dog hes so blamed
satisfied with himself You snub him and he looks at yuh as if you was
his hired manand then forgets all about yuh He come outa that doby
like hed been swimmin a river on a bet and had made good and was
a heero right before the ladies Kinda Oh thats nothing to what I
could do if it was worth while way he had with him

It wouldnt matter so much if he wasnt all front Pink complained
Youll notice thats always the way though The fellow all fussed
up with silver and braided leather cant get out and do anything
I remember up on Milk river Pink trailed off into absorbing
reminiscence which however is too lengthy to repeat here

Say Miguells down at the stable sweatin from every pore trying to
get his saddle clean by golly Slim reported cheerfully just as Pink
was relighting the cigarette which had gone out during the big scene of
his story He was cussin in Spanish when I walked up to himbut he
shut up when he seen me and got that peaceful look uh hisn on his face
I wonder by golly

Oh shut up and go awn Irish commanded bluntly and looked at Pink
Did he call it off then Or did you have to wade in

Naw he was like this here Native Sonall front He could look sudden
death all right he had black eyes like Miguellbut all a fellow had
to do was go after him and hed back up so blamed quick

Slim listened that far saw that he had interrupted a tale evidently
more interesting than anything he could say and went off muttering to
himself



CHAPTER II When Greek Meets Greek

The next morning which was Sunday the machinations of Big Medicine
took Pink down to the creek behind the bunkhouse Whats hurtin yuh
he asked curiously when he came to where Big Medicine stood in the
fringe of willows choking between his spasms of mirth

Hawhawhaw roared Big Medicine and seizing Pinks arm in a
gorillalike grip he pointed down the bank

Miguel seated upon a convenient rock in a sunny spot was painstakingly
combing out the tangled hair of his chaps which he had washed quite as
carefully not long before as the cake of soap beside him testified

Combingcombinghis chaps by cripes Big Medicine gasped
and waggled his finger at the spectacle Hawhawhaw
Ccombinhischaps

Miguel glanced up at them as impersonally as if they were two cackling
hens rather than derisive humans then bent his head over a stubborn
knot and whistled La Paloma softly while he coaxed out the tangle

Pinks eyes widened as he looked but he did not say anything He backed
up the path and went thoughtfully to the corrals leaving Big Medicine
to follow or not as he chose

Combinhis chaps by cripes came rumbling behind him Pink turned

Say Dont make so much noise about it he advised guardedly Ive
got an idea

Yuh want to hogtie it then Big Medicine retorted resentful because
Pink seemed not to grasp the full humor of the thing Idees sure seems
to be skurce in this outfitor that there lilyuhthevalley couldnt
set and comb no chaps in broad daylight by cripes not and get off with
it

Hes an ornament to the Flying U Pink stated dreamily Us boneheads
dont appreciate him is all that ails us What we ought to do ishelp
him be as pretty as he wants to be and

Looky here Little One Big Medicine hurried his steps until he was
close alongside I wouldnt give a punched nickel for a fourhorse load
uh them idees and thats the truth He passed Pink and went on ahead
disgust in every line of his squareshouldered figure Combin his
chaps by cripes he snorted again and straightway told the tale
profanely to his fellows who laughed until they were weak and
wateryeyed as they listened

Afterward because Pink implored them and made a mystery of it they
invited Miguel to take a hand in a longwinded gamerather a series
of gamesof sevenup while his chaps hung to dry upon a willow by the
creek bankor so he believed

The chaps however were up in the whitehouse kitchen where were also
the reek of scorched hair and the laughing expostulations of the
Little Doctor and the boyish titter of Pink and Irish who were curling
laboriously the chaps of Miguel with the curling tongs of the Little
Doctor and those of the Countess besides

Its a shame and I just hope Miguel thrashes you both for it the
Little Doctor told them more than once but she laughed nevertheless
and showed Pink how to give the twist which made of each lock a
corkscrew ringlet The Countess stopped with her dishcloth dangling
from one red bony hand while she looked You boys couldnt sleep
nights if you didnt pester the life outa somebody she scolded Seems
to me Id friz them diamonds if I was goin to be mean enough to do
anything

You would eh Pink glanced up at her and dimpled Ill find you
a rich husband to pay for that He straightway proceeded to friz the
diamonds of white

Why dont you have a strip of ringlets down each leg with tight little
curls between suggested the Little Doctor not to be outdone by any
other woman

Correct you are praised Irish

And remember youre not heating brandingirons mister man she
added Youll burn all the hair off if you let the tongs get redhot
Just so theyll sizzle Ive told you five times already She picked
up the Kid kissed many times the finger he held up for sympathythe
finger with which he had touched the tongs as Pink was putting them
back into the grate of the kitchen stove and spoke again to ease her
conscience I think its awfully mean of you to do it Miguel ought to
thrash you both

Were dead willing to let him try Mrs Chip We know its mean Were
real ashamed of ourselves Irish tested his tongs as he had been told
to do But wed rather be ashamed than good any old time

The Little Doctor giggled behind the Kids tousled curls and reached
out a slim hand once more to give Pinks tongs the expert twist he was
trying awkwardly to learn Im sorry for Miguel hes got lovely eyes
anyway

Yes aint he Pink looked up briefly from his task Hows your leg
Irish Mines done

Seems to me Id make a deep border of them corkscrew curls all around
the bottoms if I was doin it said the Countess peevishly from the
kitchen sink If I was that dago Id murder the hull outfit I never
did see a body so hectored in my lifeand him not ever ketchin on He
must be plumb simpleminded

When the curling was done to the hilarious satisfaction of Irish and
Pink and while Pink was dancing in them to show them off another
entered with mail from town And because the mailbearer was Andy Green
himself back from a winters journeyings Cal Happy Jack and Slim
followed close behind talking all at once in their joy at beholding
the man they loved well and hated occasionally also Andy delivered the
mail into the hands of the Little Doctor pinched the Kids cheek
and said how he had grown goodlooking as his mother almost spoke a
cheerful howdy to the Countess and turned to shake hands with Pink It
was then that the honest gray eyes of him widened with amazement

Well by golly gasped Slim goggling at the chaps of Miguel

That there Natiff Sonll just about kill yuh for that warned Happy
Jack as mournfully as he might with laughing Hell knife yuh sure

Andy demanding the meaning of it all learned all about Miguel
Rapponifrom the viewpoint of the Happy Family At least he learned as
much as it was politic to tell in the presence of the Little Doctor and
afterward while Pink was putting the chaps back upon the willow where
Miguel had left them he was told that they looked to him Andy Green
for assistance

Oh gosh You dont want to depend on me Pink Andy expostulated
modestly I cant think of anythingand besides Ive reformed I
dont know as its any compliment to me by graciousbeing told soon as
I land that Im expected to lie to a perfect stranger

You come on down to the stable and take a look at his saddle and
bridle urged Cal And wait till you see him smoking and looking past
you as if you was an ornery little peak that didnt do nothing but
obstruct the scenery Ive seen mean cusseslots of em and Ive seen
men that was stuck on themselves But I never

Come outa that doby Pink interrupted mud to his eyebrows just
about And he knew darned well we headed him in there deliberate And
when I remarks its soft going he says It is kindajust like
that Pink managed to imitate the languid tone of Miguel very well
Not another word outa him Didnt even make him mad He

Tell him about the parrots Slim Cal suggested soberly But Slim only
turned purple at the memory and swore

Old Patsy sure has got it in for him Happy Jack observed He asked
Patsy if he ever had enchiladas Patsy wont speak to him no more He
claims Miguell insulted him He told Miguell

Enchiladas are sure fine eating said Andy I took to em like a
shebear to honey down in New Mexico this winter Your Native Son is
solid there all right

Aw gwan He aint solid nowhere but in the head Maybe youll love him
to death when yuh see himchances is you will if youve took to eatin
dago grub

Andy patted Happy Jack reassuringly on the shoulder Dont get
excited he soothed Ill put it all over the gentleman just to show
my hearts in the right place Just this once though Ive reformed
And Ive got to have time to size him up Where do you keep him when he
aint in the show window He swung into step with Pink Ill tell you
the truth he confided engagingly Any man thatll wear chaps like
hes goteven leaving out the extra finish you fellows have given
emhad ought to be taught a lesson hell remember He sure must be a
tough proposition if the whole bunch of yuh have had to give him up By
gracious

We havent tried Pink defended It kinda looked to us as if he was
aiming to make us guy him so we didnt Weve left him strictly alone
Todayhe glanced over his shoulder to where the becurled chaps swung
comically from the willow branchtodays the first time anybodys
made a move Unless he added as an afterthought you count yesterday
in the doby patchand even then we didnt tell him to ride into it we
just let him do it

And kinda herded him over towards it Cal amended slyly

Can he ride asked Andy going straight to the main point in the mind
of a cowpuncher

Weellhe hasnt been piled so far But then Pink qualified
hastily he hasnt topped anything worse than Crowhop He aint hard
to ride Happy Jack could

Aw Im gittin good and sick of hearin that there tune Happy
growled indignantly Why dont you point out Slim as the limit once in
a while

Come on down to the stable and lets talk it over Andy suggested
and led the way Whats his style anyway Mouthy or what

With four willing tongues to enlighten him it would be strange indeed
if one so acute as Andy Green failed at last to have a very fair mental
picture of Miguel He gazed thoughtfully at his boots laughed suddenly
and slapped Irish quite painfully upon the back

Come on up and introduce me boys he said Well make this Native
Son so hungry for homeyou watch me put it on the gentleman Only it
does seem a shame to do it

No it aint If youd been around him for two weeks youd want to
kill him just to make him take notice Irish assured him

What gets me Andy mused is why you fellows come crying to me for
help I should think the bunch of you ought to be able to handle one
lone Native Son

Aw youre the biggest liar and faker in the bunch is why Happy Jack
blurted

Oh I see Andy hummed a little tune and pushed his hands deep into
his pockets and at the corners of his lips there flickered a smile

The Native Son sat with his hat tilted slightly back upon his head and a
cigarette between his lips and was reaching lazily for the trick which
made the fourth game his when the group invaded the bunkhouse He
looked up indifferently swept Andys face and figure with a glance
too impersonal to hold even a shade of curiosity and began rapidly
shuffling his cards to count the points he had made

Andy stopped short just inside the door and stared hard at Miguel
who gave no sign He turned his honest gray eyes upon Pink and Irish
accusinglywhereat they wondered greatly

Your dealif you want to play drawled Miguel and shoved his cards
toward Big Medicine But the boys were already uptilting chairs to
grasp the quicker the outstretched hand of the prodigal so that Miguel
gathered up the cards evened their edges mechanically and deigned
another glance at this stranger who was being welcomed so vociferously
Also he sighed a bitfor even a languideyed stoic of a Native Son may
feel the twinge of loneliness Andy shook hands all round swore amiably
at Weary and advanced finally upon Miguel

You dont know me from Adams off ox he began genially but I know
you all right all right I hollered my head off with the rest of em
when you played merry hell in that bullring last Christmas Also I
was part of your bodyguard when them greasers were trying to tickle you
in the ribs with their knives in that dark alley Shake oldtimer You
done yourself proud and Im glad to know yuh

Miguel for the first time in two weeks permitted himself the luxury
of an expressive countenance He gave Andy Green one quick grateful
lookand a smile the like of which made the Happy Family quiver
inwardly with instinctive sympathy

So you were there too eh Miguel exclaimed softly and rose to greet
him And that scrap in the alleywe sure had a hell of a time there
for a few minutes didnt we Are you that tall fellow who kicked that
squinteyed greaser in the stomach Muchos gracios senor They were
piling on me three deep right then and I always believed theyd have
got me only for a tall vaquero I couldnt locate afterward He smiled
again that wonderful smile which lighted the darkness of his eyes as
with a flame and murmured a sentence or two in Spanish

Did you get the spurs me and my friends sent you afterward asked Andy
eagerly We heard about the Arizona boys giving you the saddleand we
raked high and low for them spurs And by gracious they were beauts
toodid yuh get em

I wear them every day I ride answered Miguel a peculiar caressing
note in his voice

I didnt knowwe heard you had disappeared off the earth Why

Miguel laughed outright To fight a bull with bare hands is one thing
amigo he said To take a chance on getting a knife stuck in your
back is another Those Mexicansthey dont love the man who crosses the
river and makes of their bullfights a plaything

Thats right only I thought you being a

Not a Mexican Miguels voice sharpened a trifle My father was
Spanish yes My motherhis eyes flashed briefly at the faces of the
gaping Happy Familymy mother was born in Ireland

And that sure makes a hard combination to beat cried Andy heartily
He looked at the othersat all that is save Pink and Irish who had
disappeared Well boys I never thought Id come home and find

Miguel Rapponi supplied the Native Son quickly As well forget that
other name And he added with the shrug which the Happy Family had
come to hate as well forget the story also I am not hungry for the
feel of a knife in my back He smiled again engagingly at Andy Green
It was astonishing how readily that smile had sprung to life with the
warmth of a little friendship and how pleasant it was withal

Just as you say Andy agreed not trying to hide his admiration I
guess nobodys got a better right to holler for silence Butsay you
sure delivered the goods old boy You musta read about it you fellows
about the American puncher that went over the line and rode one of
their crack bulls all round the ring and then He stopped and looked
apologetically at Miguel in whose dark eyes there flashed a warning
light I clean forgot he confessed impulsively This meeting you
here unexpectedly like this has kinda got me rattled I guess ButI
never saw yuh before in my life he declared emphatically I dont
know a darn thing aboutanything that ever happened in an alley in
the city ofoh come on oldtimer lets talk about the weather or
something safe

After that the boys of the Flying U behaved very much as do children
who have quarreled foolishly and are trying shamefacedly to reestablish
friendly relations without the preliminary indignity of open repentance
They avoided meeting the velveteyed glances of Miguel and at the same
time they were plainly anxious to include him in their talk as if that
had been their habit from the first A difficult situation to meet even
with the fine aplomb of the Happy Family to ease the awkwardness

Later Miguel went unobtrusively down to the creek after his chaps he
did not get them just then but he stood for a long time hidden behind
the willowfringe watching Pink and Irish feverishly combing out
certain corkscrew ringlets and dampening their combs in the creek to
facilitate the process of straightening certain patches of rebellious
frizzes Miguel did not laugh aloud as Big Medicine had done He stood
until he wearied of the sight then lifted his shoulders in the gesture
which may mean anything smiled and went his way

Not until dusk did Andy get a private word with him When he did find
him alone he pumped Miguels hand up and down and afterward clutched at
the manger for support and came near strangling Miguel leaned beside
him and smiled to himself

Good team work old boy Andy gasped at length in a whisper Best I
ever saw in mlife impromptu on the spot like that I saw you had the
makings in you soon as I caught your eye And the whole blame bunch
fell for itwoooof He laid his face down again upon his folded arms
and shook in all the long length of him

They had it coming said Miguel softly with a peculiar relish Two
whole weeks and never a friendly word from one of themoh hell

I knowI heard it all soon as I hit the ranch Andy replied weakly
standing up and wiping his eyes I just thought Id learn em a
lessonand the way you played upsay my hats off to you all right

One learns to seize opportunities without stuttering Miguel observed
calmlyand a queer look came into his eyes as they rested upon the face
of Andy And if the chance comes Ill do as much for you By the way
did you see the saddle those Arizona boys sent me Its over here Its
a pippinalmost as fine as the spurs which I keep in the bunkhouse
when theyre not on my heels And if I didnt say so before Im sure
glad to meet the man that helped me through that alley That big fat
devil would have landed me sure if you hadnt

Ahwhat Andy leaned and peered into the face of Miguel his jaw
hanging slack You dont mean to tell meits true

True Why I thought you were the fellow Miguel faced him steadily
His eyes were frankly puzzled

Ill tell you the truth so help me Andy said heavily I dont know
a darned thing about it only what I read in the papers I spent the
whole winter in Colorado and Wyoming I was just joshing the boys

Oh said Miguel

They stood there in the dusk and silence for a space after which Andy
went forth into the night to meditate upon this thing Miguel stood and
looked after him

Hes the real goods when it comes to lyingbut there are others he
said aloud and smiled a peculiar smile But for all that he felt that
he was going to like Andy very much indeed And since the Happy Family
had shown a disposition to make him one of themselves he knew that he
was going to become quite as foolishly attached to the Flying U as was
even Slim confessedly the most rabid of partisans

In this wise did Miguel Rapponi then become a member of Jim Whitmores
Happy Family and play his part in the events which followed his
adoption



CHAPTER III Bad News

Andy Green that honesteyed young man whom everyone loved but whom
not a man believed save when he was indulging his love for more or less
fantastic flights of the imagination pulled up on the brow of Flying U
coulee and stared somberly at the picture spread below him On the porch
of the White House the hammock swung gently under the weight of the
Little Doctor who pushed her shippertoe mechanically against a post
support at regular intervals while she read

On the steps the Kid was crawling laboriously upward only to descend
again quite as laboriously when he attained the top One of the boys was
just emerging from the blacksmith shop from the build of him Andy knew
it must be either Weary or Irish though it would take a much closer
observation and some familiarity with the two to identify the man more
exactly In the corral were a swirl of horses and an overhanging cloud
of dust with two or three figures discernible in the midst and away
in the little pasture two other figures were galloping after a fleeing
dozen of horses While he looked old Patsy came out of the messhouse
and went with flapping floursack apron to the woodpile

Peaceful it was and homelike and contentedly prosperous a little
world tucked away in its hills with its own little triumphs and
defeats its own heartaches and rejoicings a lucky little world
because its triumphs had been satisfying its defeats small its
heartaches brief and its rejoicings untainted with harassment or guilt
Yet Andy stared down upon it with a frown and when he twitched the
reins and began the descent he sighed impatiently

Past the stable he rode with scarcely a glance toward Weary who shouted
a casual Hello at him from the corral through the big gate and up the
trail to the White House and straight to the porch where the Little
Doctor flipped a leaf of her magazine and glanced at him with a smile
and the Kid turned his plump body upon the middle step and wrinkled his
nose in a smile of recognition while he threw out an arm in welcome
and made a wobbling effort to get upon his feet

Andy smiled at the Kid but his smile did not reach his eyes and faded
almost immediately He glanced at the Little Doctor sent his horse past
the steps and the Kid and close to the railing so that he could lean
and toss the mail into the Little Doctors lap There was a yellow
envelope among the letters and her fingers singled it out curiously
Andy folded his hands upon the saddlehorn and watched her frankly

Must be from J G guessed the Little Doctor inserting a slim finger
under the badly sealed flap Ive been wondering if he wasnt going
to send some wordhes been gone a weekBaby Hes right between
your horses legs Andy Ohhbaby boy what wont you do next She
scattered letters and papers from her lap and flew to the rescue Will
he kick Andy You little ruffian She held out her arms coaxingly from
the top of the steps and her face Andy saw when he looked at her had
lost some of its color

The horse is quiet enough he reassured her But at the same time I
wouldnt hand him out as a plaything for a kid He leaned cautiously
and peered backward

Ohdid you ever see such a child Come to mother Baby Her voice was
becoming strained

The Kid wrinkling his nose and jabbering unintelligibly at her so
that four tiny teeth showed in his pink mouth moved farther backward
and sat down violently under the horses sweatroughened belly He
wriggled round so that he faced forward reached out gleefully caught
the front fetlocks and cried Dup while he pulled The Little Doctor
turned white

Hes all right soothed Andy and leaning with a twist of his slim
body caught the Kid firmly by the back of his pink dress and lifted
him clear of danger He came up with a red face tossed the Kid into the
eager arms of the Little Doctor and soothed his horse with soft words
and a series of little slaps upon the neck He was breathing unevenly
because the Kid had really been in rather a ticklish position but the
Little Doctor had her face hidden on the babys neck and did not see

Wheres Chip Andy turned to ride back to the stable glancing toward
the telegram lying on the floor of the porch and from it his eyes went
to the young woman trying to laugh away her trembling while she scolded
adoringly her adventurous manchild He was about to speak again but
thought better of it and sighed

Down at the stables somewhereI dont know really the boys can tell
you Mothers baby mustnt touch the naughty horses Naughty horses hurt
mothers baby Make him cry

Andy gave her a long look which had in it much pity and rode away
He knew what was in that telegram for the agent had told him when he
hunted him up at Rusty Browns and gave it to him and the horse of Andy
bore mute testimony to the speed with which he had brought it to the
ranch Not until he had reached the coulee had he slackened his pace
He decided after that glance that he would not remind her that she
had not read the telegram instead he thought he ought to find Chip
immediately and send him to her

Chip was rummaging after something in the storehouse and when Andy
saw him there he dismounted and stood blotting out the light from
the doorway Chip looked up said Hello carelessly and flung an old
slicker aside that he might search beneath it Back early arent you
he asked for sake of saying something

Andys attitude was not as casual as he would have had it

Say maybe you better go on up to the house he began diffidently I
guess your wife wants to see yuh maybe

Just as a good wife should grinned Chip Whats the matter Kid fall
off the porch

NooI brought out a wire from Chicago Its from a doctor
theresome hospital TheOld Man got hurt One of them cussed
automobiles knocked him down They want you to come

Chip had straightened up and was hooking at Andy blankly If youre
just

Honest Andy asserted and flushed a little Ill go tell some one to
catch up the teamyoull want to make that 1120 I take it He added
as Chip went by him hastily I had the agent wire for sleeper berths on
the 1120 so

Thanks Yes you have the team caught up Andy Chip was already well
on his way to the house

Andy waited till he saw the Little Doctor come hurriedly to the end of
the porch overlooking the pathway with the telegram fluttering in her
fingers and then led his horse down through the gate and to the stable
He yanked the saddle off turned the tired animal into a stall and went
on to the corral where he leaned elbows on a warped rail and peered
through at the turmoil within Close beside him stood Weary with his
loop dragging behind him waiting for a chance to throw it over the head
of a buckskin threeyearold with black mane and tail

Get in here and make a hand why dont you Weary bantered his eye
on the buckskin Good chance to make a rep for yourself Andy
Gawd greased that buckskinhe sure can slide out from under a rope as
easy

He broke off to flip the hoop dexterously forward had the reward of
seeing the buckskin dodge backward so that the rope barely flicked him
on the nose and drew in his rope disgustedly Come on Andymy hands
are up in the air I cant land himthats the fourth throw

Andys interest in the buckskin however was scant His face was sober
his whole attitude one of extreme dejection

You got the tummyache Pink inquired facetiously moving around so
that he got a fair look at his face

Nawhis girls went back on him Happy Jack put in coiling his rope
as he came up

Oh shut up Andys voice was sharp with trouble Boys the Old
Manswell hes most likely dead by this time I brought out a
telegram

Go on Pinks eyes widened incredulously Dont you try that kind of
a load Andy Green or Ill just about

Oh you fellows make me sick Andy took his elbows off the rail and
stood straight Dammit the telegrams up at the housego and read it
yourselves then

The three stared after him doubtfully fear struggling with the caution
born of much experience

He dont act to me like he was putting up a josh Weary stated
uneasily after a minute of silence Run up to the house and find out
Cadwalloper The Old Manoh good Lord The tan on Wearys face took a
lighter tinge Scootit wont take but a minute to find out for sure
Go on Pink

So help me Josephine Ill kill that same Andy Green if hes lied about
it Pink declared while he climbed the fence

In three minutes he was back and before he had said a word his face
confirmed the bad news Their eyes besought him for details and he
gave them jerkily Automobile run over him He aint dead but they
thinkChip and the Little Doctor are going to catch the night train
You go haze in the team Happy And give em a feed of oats Chip said

Irish and Big Medicine seeing the three standing soberly together
there and sensing something unusual came up and heard the news in
stunned silence Andy forgetting his pique at their first disbelief
came forlornly back and stood with them

The Old Manthe thing could not be true To every man of them his
presence conjured by the impending tragedy was almost a palpable
thing His stocky figure seemed almost to stand in their midst
he looked at them with his whimsical eyes which had the radiating
crowsfeet of age humor and habitual squinting against sun and wind
the bald spot on his head the wrinkling shirtcollar that seldom knew
a tie the carpet slippers which were his favorite footgear because they
were kind to his bunions his husky voice goodnaturedly complaining
were poignantly real to them at that moment Then Irish mentally
pictured him lying maimed dying perhaps in a faroff hospital among
strangers and swore

If hes got to die it oughta be here where folks know him andwhere
he knows Irish was not accustomed to giving voice to his deeper
feelings and he blundered awkwardly over it

I never did go much on them darned hospitals anyway Weary observed
gloomily He oughta be home where folks can look after him Mamma It
sure is a fright

I betche Chip and the Little Doctor wont get there in time Happy
Jack predicted with his usual pessimism The Old Mans gittin old

He aint but fiftytwo yuh call that old consarn yuh Hes younger
right now than youll be when youre forty

Countess is going along too so she can ride herd on the Kid Pink
informed then I heard the Little Doctor tell her to pack up and
never mind if she did have sponge all set Countess seemed to think
her bread was a darned sight more important than the Old Man Thats the
way with women Theyll pass up

Well by golly I like to see a woman take some interest in her own
affairs Slim defended What they packin up for and where they
goin Slim had just ridden up to the group in time to overhear Pinks
criticism

They told him the news and Slim swallowed twice said By golly quite
huskily and then rode slowly away with his head bowed He had worked
for the Flying U when it was strictly a bachelor outfit and with the
tenacity of slow minds he held J G Whitmore his beloved Old Man
as but a degree lower than that mysterious power which made the sun to
shineand if the truth were known he had accepted him as being quite
as eternal His loyalty adjusted everything to the interests of the
Flying U That the Old Man could diethe possibility stunned him

They were a sorry company that gathered that night around the long table
with its mottled oilcloth covering and benches polished to a glasslike
smoothness with their own vigorous bodies They did not talk much about
the Old Man indeed they came no nearer the subject than to ask Weary
if he were going to drive the team in to Dry Lake They did not talk
much about anything for that matter even the knives and forks seemed
to share the general depression of spirits and failed to give forth the
cheerful clatter which was a daily accompaniment of meals in that room

Old Patsy he who had cooked for J G Whitmore when the Flying U
coulee was a wilderness and the brand yet unrecorded and the irons
unmadePatsy lumbered heavily about the room and could not find his
dishcloth when it was squeezed tight in one great fat hand and
unthinkingly started to fill their coffee cups from the teakettle

Py cosh I vould keel der fool vot made her first von of der
automobeels yet he exclaimed unexpectedly after a long silence and
cast his pipe vindictively toward his bunk in one corner

The Happy Family looked around at him then understandingly at one
another

Same here Patsy Jack Bates agreed What they want of the damned
things when the countrys full uh good horses gits me

So some Yahoo with just sense enough to put goggles on to cover up
his fool face can run over folks he aint good enough to speak to by
cripes Big Medicine glared aggressively up and down the table

Weary got up suddenly and went out and Slim followed him though his
supper was halfuneaten

This goin to be hard on the Little Doctoronly brother shes got
they heard Happy Jack point out unnecessarily and Weary the equable
was guilty of slamming the door so that the whole building shook by way
of demonstrating his dislike of speech upon the subject

They were a sorry company who waved hands at the Little Doctor and
the Kid and the Countess just when the afterglow of a red sunset
was merging into the vague purple shadows of coming dusk They stood
silent for the most part and let them go without the usual facetious
advice to Be good to yourselves and the hackneyed admonition to Chip
to keep out of jail if he could There must have been something very
wistful in their faces for the Little Doctor smiled bravely down upon
then from the buggy seat and lifted up the Kid for a fourtoothed smile
and an ecstatic Bye accompanied by a vigorous flopping of hands
which included then all

Well telegraph first thing boys the Little Doctor called back as
the rig chucked into the pebbly creek crossing Well keep you posted
and Ill write all the particulars as soon as I can Dont think the
worstunless you have to I dont She smiled again and waved her
hand hastily because of the Kids contortions and though the smile
had tears close behind it though her voice was tremulous in spite of
herself the Happy Family took heart from her courage and waved their
hats gravely and smiled back as best they could

Theres a lot uh cake you boys might just as well eat up the Countess
called belatedly Itll all dry out if yuh dontand there aint no
use wastin itand theres two lemon pies in the brown cupboard and
what under the shinin sun The wheels bumped violently against a
rock and the Happy Family heard no more



CHAPTER IV Some Hopes

On the third day after the Happy Family decided that there should be
some word from Chicago and since that day was Sunday they rode in a
body to Dry Lake after it They had not discussed the impending tragedy
very much but they were an exceedingly Unhappy Family nevertheless
and since Flying U coulee was but a place of gloom they were not
averse to leaving it behind them for a few hours and riding where every
stick and stone did not remind then of the Old Man

In Dry Lake was a message brief but heartening

J G still alive Some hopes

They left the station with lighter spirits after reading that rode to
the hotel tied their horses to the long hitching pole there and went
in And right there the Happy Family unwittingly became cast for the
leading parts in one of those dramas of the West which never is heard
of outside the theater in which grim circumstance stages it for a single
playingunless indeed the curtain rings down on a tragedy that brings
the actors before their district judge for trial And as so frequently
is the case the beginning was casual to the point of triviality

Sary Ellen Margreet Sybilly and Josphine Denson spelled in
accordance with parental pronunciation were swinging idly upon the
hitching pole with the selfconscious sang froid of country children
come to town They backed away from the Happy Familys approach grinned
foolishly in response to their careless greeting and tittered openly
at the resplendence of the Native Son who was wearing his black Angora
chaps with the three white diamonds down each leg the gay horsehair
hatband crimson neckerchief and Mexican spurs with their immense
rowels and ornate conchos of handbeaten silver Sary Ellen Margreet
Josphine and Sybilly were also resplendent in their way Their carroty
hair was tied with ribbons quite aggressively new their freckles
shone with maternal scrubbing and there was a hint of homemade
crochetlace beneath each stiffly starched dress

Hello kids Weary greeted them amiably with a secret smile over the
memory of a time when they had purloined the Little Doctors pills and
had made reluctant acquaintance with a stomach pump Wheres the circus
going to be at

There aint goin to be no circus Sybilly retorted because she was
the forward one of the family Were going away on the train The next
one that comes along Were going to be on it all night too and well
have to eat on it too

Well by golly youll want something to eat then Slim was feeling
abstractedly in his pocket for a coin for these were the nieces of the
Countess and therefore claimed more than a cursory interest from
Slim You take this up to the store and see if yuh cant swop it for
something good to eat Because Sary was the smallest of the lot he
pressed the dollar into her shrinking amazed palm

Paws got more moneyn that Sybilly announced proudly Paws got
a million dollars A man bought our ranch and gave him a lot of money
Were rich now Maybe pawll buy us a phonygraft He said maybe he
would And maws goin to have a blue silk dress with green onto it
And

Better haze along and buy that grub stake Slim interrupted the family
gift for profuse speech He had caught the boys grinning and fancied
that they were tracing a likeness between the garrulity of Sybilly and
the fluency of her aunt the Countess You dont want that train to go
off and leave yuh by golly

Wonder who bought Denson out Cal Emmett asked of no one in
particular as the children went strutting off to the store to spend the
dollar which little Sary clutched so tightly it seemed as if the goddess
of liberty must surely have been imprinted upon her palm

When they went inside and found Denson himself pompously setting em up
to the house Cal repeated the question in a slightly different form to
the man himself

Denson while he was ready to impress the beholders with his
unaccustomed affluence became noticeably embarrassed at the inquiry
and edged off into vague generalities

I jest nacherlly had to sell when I got m price he told the Happy
Family in a tone that savored strongly of apology I like the country
and I like m neighbors fine Neverd ask for better than the Flyin U
has been t me I aint got no kick comin there Sorry to hear the Old
Mans hurt back East Mary was real put out at not bein able to
see Louise fore she went awayLouise being the Countess and Mary
Densons sisterbut soon as I sold I got oneasy like The feller
wanted psession right away too so I told Mary we might as well start
bfore we git outa the notion I wouldnt uh cared about sellin maybe
but the kids needs to be in school Theyre growin up in ignrance
out here and Marys folks wants us to come back n settle close handy
bythey been at us t sell out and move fer the last five years now
and I told Mary

Even Cal forgot eventually that he had asked a question which remained
unanswered what interest he had felt at first was smothered to death
beneath that blanket of words and he eagerly followed the boys out
and over to Rusty Browns place where Denson because of an old grudge
against Rusty might be trusted not to follow

Mamma Weary commented amusedly when they were crossing the street
that Denson bunch can sure talk the fastest and longest and say the
least of any outfit I ever saw

Wonder who did buy him out Jack Bates queried Old gingerwhiskers
didnt pass out any facts yuh notice He couldnt have got much his
lands mostly gravel and doby patches Hes got a water right on Flying
U creek you knowfirst right at that seems to meand a dandy fine
spring in that coulee Wonder why our outfit didnt buy him outseeing
he wanted to sell so bad

This wantin to sell is something I never heard of bfore Slim said
slowly To hear him tell it that ranch uh hisn was worth a dollar an
inch by golly I dont blieve hes been wantin to sell out If he
had Mis Bixby woulda said something about it She dont know about
this here sellin business or shed a said

Yeah you can most generally bank on the Countess telling all she
knows Cal assented with some sarcasm at which Slim grunted and turned
sulky afterward

Denson and his affairs they speedily forgot for a time in the diversion
which Rusty Browns familiar place afforded to young men with unjaded
nerves and a zest for the primitive pleasures Not until midafternoon
did it occur to them that Flying U coulee was deserted by all save old
Patsy and that there were chores to be done if all the creatures of
the coulee would sleep in comfort that night Pink therefore withdrew
his challenge to the bunch and laid his billiard cue down with a sigh
and the remark that all he lacked was time to have the scalps of every
last one of them hanging from his belt Pink was figurative in his
speech you will understand and also a bit vainglorious over beating
Andy Green and Big Medicine twice in succession

It occurred to Weary then that a word of cheer to the Old Man and
his anxious watchers might not cone amiss Therefore the Happy Family
mounted and rode to the depot to send it and on the way wrangled over
the wording of the message after their usual contentious manner

Better tell em everything is fine at this end uh the line Cal
suggested and was hooted at for a poet

Just say Weary began when he was interrupted by the discordant
clamor from a trainload of sheep that had just pulled in and stopped
Maaaa Maaaaa darn yuh he shouted derisively at the peering
plaintive faces glimpsed between the closeset bars Mamma how I do
love sheep Whereupon he put spurs to his horse and galloped down to
the station to rid his ears of the turbulent wave of protest from the
cars

Naturally it required some time to compose the telegram in a style
satisfactory to all parties Outside cars banged together an engine
snorted stertorously and suffocating puffs of coal smoke now and
then invaded the waitingroom while the Happy Family were sending that
message of cheer to Chicago If you are curious the final version of
their combined sentiments was not at all spectacular It said merely

Everything fine here Take good care of the Old Man Hows the Kid
stacking up

It was signed simply The Bunch

Marys little lambs are here yet I see the Native Son remarked
carelessly when they went out Enough lambs for all the Marys in the
country How would you like to be Mary

Not for me Irish declared and turned his face away from the stench
of them

Others there were who rode the length of the train with faces averted
and looks of disdain cowmen all of them they shared the range
prejudice and took no pains to hide it

The wind blew strong from the east that day it whistled through the
open doubledecked cars packed with gray woolly bodies whose voices
were ever raised in strident complaint and the stench of them smote
the unaccustomed nostrils of the Happy Family and put them to disgusted
flight up the track and across it to where the air was clean again

Honest to grandma Id make the poorest kind of a sheepherder Big
Medicine bawled earnestly when they were well away from the noise and
smell of the detested animals If I had to herd sheep by cripes do
you know what Id do Id haze em into a coulee and turn loose with a
good rifle and plenty uh shells and call in the coyotes to git a square
meal Thats the way Id herd sheep Its the only way you can shut em
up They just baaaa baaaa baaaa from the time theyre dropped
till somebody kills em off Honest they blat in their sleep Ive
heard em

When you and the dogs were shooting off coyotes asked Andy Green
pointedly and so precipitated dissension which lasted for ten miles



CHAPTER V Sheep

Slim rising first from dinner on the next day but one opened the door
of the messhouse and stood there idly picking his teeth before he went
about his work After a minute of listening to the boys joshing old
Patsy about some gooseberry pies he had baked without sugar he turned
his face outward threw up his head like a startled bull and began to
sniff

Say I smell sheep by golly he announced in the bellowing tone which
was his conversational voice and sniffed again

Oh thats just a leftover in your system from the dose yuh got in
town Sunday Weary explained soothingly Ive smelled sheep and
tasted sheep and dreamed sheep ever since

No by golly its sheep It aint no memory II bhieve I hear
em too by golly Slim stepped out away from the building and faced
suspiciously down the coulee

Slim I never suspected you of imagination before the Native Son
drawled and loitered out to where Slim stood still sniffing I wonder
if youre catching it from Andy and me Dont you think you ought to be
vaccinated

That aint imagination Pink called out from within When anybody
claims theres sheep in Flying U coulee thats straight loco

Come on out here and smell em yourself then Slim bawled
indignantly I never seen such an outfit as this is gittin to be you
fellers dont believe nobody no more We aint all Andy Greens

Upon hearing this Andy pushed back his chair and strolled outside He
clapped his hand down upon Slims fatcushioned shoulder and swayed him
gently Never mind Slim you cant all be famous he comforted Some
day maybe Ill teach yuh the fine art of lying more convincingly than
the ordinary man can tell the truth It is a fine art it takes a genius
to put it across Now the only time anybody doubts my word is when Im
sticking to the truth hike a sand burr to a dogs tail

From away to the west borne on the wind which swept steadily down the
coulee came that faint humming singsong which can be made only by a
herd of a thousand or more sheep all blatting in different keysor
by a distant band playing monotonously upon the middle octave of their
varied instruments

Slims right by gracious Its sheep sure as yuh live Andy did not
wait for more but started at a fast walk for the stable and his horse
After him went the Native Son who had not been with the Flying U long
enough to sense the magnitude of the affront and Slim who knew to a
nicety just what cowmen considered the unpardonable sin and the rest
of the Happy Family who were rather incredulous still

Must be some fool herder just crossing the coulee on the move
somewhere Weary gave as a solution Half of em dont know a fence
when they see it

As they galloped toward the sound and the smell they expressed freely
their opinion of sheep the men who owned them and the lunatics who
watched over the blatting things They were cattlemen to the marrow
in their bones and they gloried in their prejudice against the woolly
despoilers of the range

All these years had the Flying U been immune from the nuisance save for
an occasional trespasser who was quickly sent about his business The
Flying U range had been kept in the main inviolate from the little gray
vandals which ate the grass clean to the sod and trampled with their
sharppointed hoofs the very roots into lifelessness which polluted the
waterholes and creeks until cattle and horses went thirsty rather than
drink which in that land of scant rainfall devastated the range
where they fed so that a longestablished prairiedog town was not more
barren What wonder if the men who owned cattle and those who tended
them hated sheep So does the farmer dread an invasion of grasshoppers

A mile down the coulee they came upon the band with two herders and four
dogs keeping watch Across the coulee and up the hillsides they spread
like a noisome gray blanket Maaaa maaaa maaaa two thousand
strong they blatted a strident medley while they hurried here and there
after sweeter bunches of grass very much like a disturbed anthill

The herders loitered upon either slope their dogs lying close beside
them There was good grass in that part of the coulee the Flying U
had saved it for the saddle horses that were to be gathered and held
temporarily at the ranch for it would save herding and a week in that
pasture would put a keen edge on their spirits for the hard work of the
calf roundup A dozen or two that ranged close had already been driven
into the field and were feeding disdainfully in a corner as far away
from the sheep as the fence would permit

The Happy Family riding closegrouped stiffened in their saddles and
stared amazed at the outrage

Sheepherders never did have any nerve Irish observed after a minute
They keep their places fine Theyll drive their sheep right into your
dooryard and tell en to help themselves to anything that happens to
look good to them Oh theyre sure modest and retiring

Weary who had charge of the outfit during Chips absence was making
straight for the nearest herder Pink and Andy went with him as a
matter of course

You fellows ride up around that side and put the run on them sheep
Weary shouted back to the others Well start the other side moving
Make em travelback where they came from He jerked his head toward
the north He knew just as they all knew that there had been no sheep
to the south unless one counted those that ranged across the Missouri
river

As the three forced their horses up the steep slope the herder sitting
slouched upon a rock glanced up at them dully He had a long stick
with which he was apathetically turning over the smaller stones within
his reach and as apathetically killing the black bugs that scuttled out
from the moist earth beneath He desisted from this unexciting pastime
as they drew near and eyed them with the sullenness that comes of
long isolation when the persons nature forbids that other extreme of
babbling garrulity for no man can live long months alone and remain
perfectly normal Nature that stern mistress always exacts a penalty
from us foolish mortals who would ignore the instincts she has wisely
implanted within us for our good

Maybe Weary began mildly and without preface you dont know this is
private property Get busy with your dogs and haze these sheep back on
the bench He waved his hand to the north And when you get a good
start in that direction he added yuh better keep right on going

The herder surveyed him morosely but he said nothing neither did he
rise from the rock to obey the command The dogs sat upon their haunches
and perked their ears inquiringly as if they understood better than did
their master that these men were not to be quite overlooked

I meant today Weary hinted with the manner of one who deliberately
holds his voice quiet

I never asked yuh what yuh meant the herder mumbled scowling We
got to keep em on water another hour yet He went back to turning
over the small rocks and to pursuing with his stick the bugs as if the
whole subject were squeezed dry of interest

For a minute Weary stared unwinkingly down at him uncertain whether to
resent this as pure insolence or to condone it as imbecility Mamma
he breathed eloquently and grinned at Andy and Pink This is a real
talkative cuss and obliging too Come on boys hes too busy to
bother with a little thing like sheep

He led the way around to the far side of the band the nearest sheep
scuttling away from then as they passed I dont suppose we could work
the combination on those dogswhat he considered aloud glancing back
at them where they still sat upon their haunches and watched the strange
riders Say Cadwalloper you took a few lessons in sheepherding a
couple of years ago when you was stuck on that girlremember Whistle
em up here and set en to work

You go to the devil Pinks curved hips replied amiably to his boss
Ive got lossuhmemory on the sheep business

Whereat Weary grinned and said no more about it

On the opposite side of the coulee the boys seemed to be laboring
quite as fruitlessly with the other herder They heard Big Medicines
truculent bellow as he leaned from the saddle and waved a fist close to
the face of the herder but though they rode with their eyes fixed upon
the group they failed to see any resultant movement of dogs sheep or
man

There is at times a certain safety in being the hopeless minority
Though seven indignant cowpunchers surrounded him that herder was
secure from any personal molestationand he knew it They were seven
against one therefore after making some caustic remarks which
produced as little effect as had Wearys command upon the first man the
seven were constrained to ride here and there along the wavering gray
line and with shouts and swinging ropes themselves drive the sheep
from the coulee

There was much clamor and dust and riding to and fro There was language
which would have made the mothers of then weep and there were faces
grown crimson from wrath Eventually however the Happy Family faced
the north fence of the Flying U boundary and saw the last woolly back
scrape under the lower wire leaving a toll of greasy wool hanging from
the barbs

The herders had drawn together and were looking on from a distance and
the four dogs were yelping uneasily over their enforced inaction The
Happy Family went back and rounded up the herders and by sheer weight
of numbers forced them to the fence without laying so much as a finger
upon then The one who had been killing black bugs gave then an ugly
look as he crawled through but even he did not say anything

Snap them wires down where they belong Weary commanded tersely

The man hesitated a minute then sullenly unhooked the barbs of the two
lower strands so that the wires which had thus been lifted to permit
the passing of the sheep twanged apart and once more stretched straight
from post to post

Now just keep in mind the fact that fences are built for use This is
a private ranch and sheep are just about as welcome as smallpox Haze
them stinking things as far north as theyll travel before dark and at
daylight start em going again Wheres your camp anyhow

None of your business mumbled the bugkiller sourly

Weary scanned the undulating slope beyond the fence saw no sign of a
camp and glanced uncertainly at his fellows Well it dont matter
much where it is you see to it you dont sleep within five miles of
here or youre liable to have bad dreams Hit the trail now

They waited inside the fence until the retreating sheep lost their
individuality as blatting animals ambling erratically here and there
while they moved toward the brow of the hill and merged into a great
gray blotch against the faint green of the new grassa blotch from
which rose again that vibrant singsong humming of many voices mingled
Then they rode back down the coulee to their own work taking it
for granted that the trespassing was an incident which would not be
repeatedby those particular sheep at any rate

It was therefore with something of a shock that the Happy Family
awoke the next morning to hear Pinks melodious treble shouting in the
bunkhouse at sunrise next morning

Gwaay round em Shep Seven black ones in the coulee Men who
know well the West are familiar with that facetious call

Ah whats the matter with yuh Irish raised a rumpled brown head
from his pillow and blinked sleepily at him Ive been dreaming I was
a sheepherder all night

Well youve got the swellest chance in the world to make every dream
cone true dearie Pink retorted The whole blamed coulees full uh
sheep I woke up a while ago and thought I just imagined I heard en
again so I went out to take a lookor a smell it wasand theyre
sure enough there

Weary swung one long leg out from under his blankets and reached for his
clothes He did not say anything but his face portended trouble for the
invaders

Say cried Big Medicine coming out of his bunk as if it were afire
I tell yuh right now then blattin human apes wouldnt git gay around
here if I was runnin this outfit The way Id have of puttin them
sheep on the run wouldnt be slow by cripes Ill guarantee

By then the bunkhouse was buzzing with voices and there was none to
give heed to Big Medicine s blatant boasting Others there were who
seemed rather inclined to give Weary good advice while they pulled
on their boots and sought for their gloves and rolled earlymorning
cigarettes and otherwise prepared themselves for what Fate might have
waiting for then outside the door

Are you sure theyre in the coulee Cadwalloper Weary asked during a
brief lull They could be up on the hill

Hell yes was Pinks forceful answer They could be on the hill but
they aint Why darn it theyre straggling into the little pasture I
could see em from the stable They

Come and eat your breakfast first boys anyway Weary had his hand
upon the doorknob A few minutes more wont make any difference one
way or the other He went out and over to the messhouse to see if
Patsy had the coffee ready for this was a good threequarters of an
hour earlier than the Flying U outfit usually bestirred themselves on
these days of preparation for roundup and waiting for good grass

Ill be darned if Id be as calm as he is Cal Emmett muttered while
the door was being closed Good thing the Old Man aint here now Hed
go straight up in the air He wouldnt wait for no breakfast

I betche therell be a killin yet before were through with them
sheep gloomed Happy Jack When sheepherders starts in once to be
ornery there aint no way uh stoppin em except by killin em off
And thatll mean the pen for a lot of us fellers

Well by golly it wont be me Slim declared loudly Yuh wouldnt
ketch me goin t jail for no doggone sheepherder They oughta be a
bounty on en by rights

Seems queer theyd be right back here this morning after being hazed
out yesterday afternoon said Andy Green thoughtfully Looks like
theyre plumb anxious to build a lot of trouble for themselves

Patsy thumping energetically the bottom of a tin pan sent them
trooping to the messhouse There it was evident that the breakfast had
been unduly hurried there were no biscuits in sight for one thing
though Patsy was lumbering about the stove frying hotcakes They were
in too great a hurry to wait for them however They swallowed their
coffee hurriedly bolted a few mouthfuls of meat and fried eggs and let
it go at that

Weary looked at then with a faint smile Im going to give a few of you
fellows a chance to herd sheep today he announced cooling his coffee
so that it would not actually scald his palate Thats why I wanted
you to get some grub into you Some of you fellows will have to take the
trail up on the hill and meet us outside the fence so when we chase
em through you can make a good job of it this time I wonder

You dont need to call out the troops for that job one man is
enough to put the fear uh the Lord into then herders Andy remarked
slightingly Once theyre on the move

All right my boy well let you be the man Weary told him promptly
I was going to have a bunch of you take a packadero outfit down toward
Boiler Bottom and comb the breaks along there for horsesand I sure
do hate to spend the whole day chasing sheepherders around over the
country So well haze em through the fence again and seeing you feel
that way about it Ill let you go around and keep em going And if
you locate their camp kinda impress it on the tender if you can round
him up that the Flying U aint pasturing sheep this spring No matter
what kinda talk he puts up you put the run on em till you see em
across OneMan coulee Better have Patsy put you up a lunchunless
youre fond of mutton

Andy twisted his mouth disgustedly Say Im going to quit handing out
any valuable advice to you Weary he expostulated

Hawhawhawww laughed Big Medicine and slapped Andy on the
shoulder so that his face almost came in contact with his plate
Yuh will try to work some innercent man into sheepherdin will yuh
Hawhawhaww Youll come in tonight blattinif yuh dont stay out
on the range tryin t eat grass by cripes Andy had a little lamb that
follered him around

Better let Bud take that herdin job Weary Andy suggested It wont
hurt himhes blattin already

If you think youre liable to need somebody along Weary began
softheartedly relenting why I guess

If I cant handle two crazy sheepherders without any help by gracious
Ill get me a job holdin yarn in an old ladies hone Andy cut in
hastily and got up from the table Being a truthful man I cant say
Im stuck on the job but Im game for it And Ill promise you there
wont be no more sheep of that brand lickin our doorsteps What darned
outfit is it anyway I never bumped into any Dot sheep before to my
knowledge

Its a new one on me Weary testified heading the procession down
to the stable If they belonged anywhere in this part of the country
though they wouldnt be acting the way they are Theyd be wise to the
fact that it aint healthy

Even while he spoke his eyes were fixed with cold intensity upon a
fringe of gray across the coulee below the little pasture To the
nostrils of the outraged Happy Family was borne that indescribable aroma
which betrays the presence of sheep that aroma which sheepmen love and
which cattlemen hate and which a favorable wind will carry a long way

They slapped saddles on their horses in record time that morning and
raced down the coulee ironically shouting commiserating sentences to
the unfortunate Andy who rode slowly up to the messhouse for the lunch
which Patsy had waiting for him in a flour sack and afterward climbed
the grade and loped along outside the line fence to a point opposite
the sheep and the shouting horsemen who forced them back by weight of
numbers

This morning the herders were not quite so passive The bugkiller still
scowled but he spoke without the preliminary sulky silence of the day
before

Were goin across the coulee he growled Thems orders We range
south uh here

No you dont Weary dissented calmly Not by a long shot you dont
Youre going back where you come fromif you ask me And youre going
quick



CHAPTER VI What Happened to Andy

With the sun shining comfortably upon his back and with a cigarette
between his lips Andy sat upon his horse and watched in silent glee
while the irate Happy Family scurried here and there behind the band
swinging their ropes down upon the woolly backs and searching their
vocabularies for new and terrible epithets Andy smiled broadly as a
colorful phrase now and then boomed across the coulee in that clear
snappy atmosphere which carries sounds so far He did not expect to
do much smiling upon his own account that day and he was therefore
grateful for the opportunity to behold the spectacle before him

There was Slim for instance unwillingly careening down hill toward
home because in his zeal to slap an old ewe smartly with his rope he
drove her unexpectedly under his horse and so created a momentary panic
that came near standing both horse and rider upon their heads And there
was Big Medicine whistling until he was purple while the herder with a
single gesture held the dog motionless though a dozen sheep broke
back from the band and climbed a slope so steep that Big Medicine was
compelled to go after them afoot and turn them with stones and profane
objurgations

It was very funnywhen one could sit at ease upon the hilltop and smoke
a cigarette while others risked apoplexy and their souls salvation
below By the time they panted up the last rockstrewn slope of the
bluff and sent the vanguard of the invaders under the fence Andys
mood was complacent in the extreme and his smile offensively wide

Oh you neednt look so sorry for us drawled the Native Son jingling
over toward him until only the fence and a few feet of space divided
them Heres where you get yours amigo I wish you a pleasant dayand
a long one He waved his hand in mocking adieu touched his horse with
his silver spurs and rode gaily away down the coulee

Here sheepherders your outfit Maaaaa jeered Big Medicine
Youll wisht by cripes you was a dozen men just like yuh before
youre through with the deal Hawhawhaww

There were others who seeing Andys grin had something to say upon the
subject before they left

Weary rode up and looked undecidedly from Andy to the sheep and back
again

If you dont feel like tackling it singlehanded Ill send

What do yuh think I am anyway Andy interrupted crisply a
Montgomery Ward twoforaquarter cowpuncher Dont you fellows waste
any time worrying over me

The herders stared at Andy curiously when he swung in behind the
tailend of the band and kept pace with their slow moving but they did
not speak beyond shouting an occasional command to their dogs Neither
did Andy have anything to say until he saw that they were swinging
steadily to the west instead of keeping straight north as they had
been told to do Then he rode over to the nearest herder who happened
to be the bugkiller

You dont want to get turned around he hinted quietly Thats north
over there

Im workin fer the man that pays my wages the fellow retorted
glumly and waved an arm to a collie that was waiting for orders The
dog dropped his head and ran around the right wing of the band with
sharp yelps and dartings here and there turning them still more to the
west

Andy hesitated decided to leave the man alone for the present and rode
around to the other herder

You swing these sheep north he commanded disdaining preface or
explanation

Im workin for the man that pays my wages the herder made answer
stolidly and chewed steadily upon a quid of tobacco that had stained
his lips unbecomingly

So they had talked the thing overhad those two herdersand were
following a premeditated plan of defiance Andy hooked at the man a
minute You turn them sheep damn you he commanded again and laid a
hand upon his saddlehorn suggestively

You go to the devil damn yuh advised the herder and cocked a wary
eye at him from under his hatbrim Not all herders let it be said
in passing take unto themselves the mental attributes of their sheep
there are those who believe that a bold front is better than weak
compliance and who will back that belief by a very bold front indeed

Andy appraised him mentally decided that he was an ablebodied man
and therefore fightable and threw his right leg over the cantle with a
quite surprising alacrity

Are you going to turn them sheep Andy was taking off his coat when he
made that inquiry

Not for your tellin You keep back young feller or Ill sick the
dogs on yuh He turned and whistled to the nearest one and Andy hit
him on the ear

They clinched and pummeled when they could and where they could The
dog came up circled the gyrating forms twice then sat down upon his
haunches at a safe distance tilted his head sidewise and lifted his
ears interestedly He was a wise little dog the other dog was also
wise and remained phlegmatically at his post as did the bugkiller

Are you going to turn them sheep Andy spoke breathlessly but with
deadly significance

Nyes

Andy took his fingers from the others Adams apple his knee from the
others diaphragm and went over to where he had thrown down his coat
felt in a pocket for his handkerchief and when he had found it
applied it to his nose which was bleeding profusely

Fly at it then he advised eyeing the other sternly over the
handkerchief Id hate to ask you a third time

Id hate to have yuh conceded the herder reluctantly I was sure I
cd lick yuh or Id a turned em before He sent the dog racing down
the south line of the band

Andy got thoughtfully back upon his horse and sat looking hard at the
herder Say youre grade above the general run uh lambhickers he
observed after a minute Who are you working for and whats your
object in throwing sheep on Flying U land Theres plenty of range to
the north

Im workin said the herder for the Dot outfit I thought you could
read brands

Dont get sassyIve got a punch or two I havent used yet Who owns
these woollies

WellWhittaker and Oleson if yuh want to know

I do Andy was keeping pace with him around the band which edged
off from then and the dogs And what makes you so crazy about Flying U
grass he pursued

Weve got to cross that coulee to git to where were headed for we got
a right to and were going to do it The herder paused and glanced up
at Andy sourly We knowed you was a mean outfit the boss told us so
And he told us you was blank catridges and we neednt back up just
cause you raised up on your hind legs and howled a little Ive had
truck with you cowmen before Ive herded sheep in Wyoming He walked a
few steps with his head down considering

I better go over and talk some sense into the other fellow he said
looking up at Andy as if all his antagonism had oozed in the fight You
ride along this edge so they wont scatterwe ought to be grazin em
along by rights only you seem to be in such an allfired rush

You go on and tell that loco sonofagun over there what hes up
against Andy urged Blank cartridgesI sure do like that If you
only knew it high power dumdums would be a lot closer to our brand
Run alongI am in a kinda hurry this morning

Andy riding slowly upon the outskirts of the grazing blatting band
watched the two confer earnestly together a hundred yards or so
away They seemed to be having some sort of argument the bugkiller
gesticulated with the long stick he carried and the sheep while
the herders talked scattered irresponsibly Andy wondered what made
sheepmen so ornery particularly herders He wondered why the fellow
he had thrashed was so insultingly defiant at first and after
the thrashing so unresentful and communicative and so amenable to
authority withal He felt his nose and decided that it was all
things considered a cheap victory and yet one of which he need not be
ashamed

The herder cane back presently and helped drive the sheep over the edge
of the bluff which bordered Antelope coulee The bugkiller upon his
side also seemed imbued with the spirit of obedience Andy heard him
curse a collie into frenzied zeal and smiled approvingly

Now youre acting a heap more human he observed and the man from
Wyoming grinned ruefully by way of reply

Antelope coulee at that point was steep too steep for riding so that
Andy dismounted and dug his bootheels into the soft soil to gain a
foothold on the descent When he was halfway down he chanced to look
back straight into the scowling gaze of the bugkiller who was sliding
down behind him

Thought you were hazing down the other side of em Andy called back
but the herder did not choose to answer save with another scowl

Andy edged his horse around an impracticable slope of shale stuff and
went on The herder followed When he was within twelve feet or so
of the bottom there was a sound of pebbles knocked loose in haste a
scrambling and then came the impact of his body Andy teetered lost
his balance and went to the bottom in one glorious slide He landed
with the bugkiller on topand the bugkiller failed to remove his
person as speedily as true courtesy exacted

Andy kicked and wriggled and tried to remember what was that
highcolored vituperative sentence that Irish had invented over a
stubborn sheep that he might repeat it to the bugkiller The herder
from Wyoming ran up caught Andys horse and untied Andys rope from
the saddle

Good fer you Oscar he praised the bugkiller Hang onto him while
I take a few turns He thereupon helped force Andys arms to his side
and wound the rope several times rather tightly around Andys outraged
squirming person

Oh it aint goin to do yuh no good to buck n bawl admonished
the tier I learnt this here little trick down in Wyoming A bunch uh
punchers done it to meand Ive been just achin all over fer a chance
to return the favor to some uh you gay boys And he added with
malicious satisfaction while he rolled Andy over and tied a perfectly
unslippable knot behind it gives me great pleasure to hand the dose
out to you in pticular If I was a mean man Id hand yuh the boot a
few times fer luck but Ill save that up till next time

You can bet your sweet life therell be a next time Andy promised
earnestly with embellishments better suited to the occasion than to a
childrens party

Well when it arrives Im sure Johnnyonthespot Them Wyoming
punchers beat me up after theyd got me tied Im tellin yuh so youll
see I aint mean unless Im drove to it Turn him feet down hill Oscar
so he wont git a rush uh brains to the head and die on our hands Now
youre goin to mind your own business sonny Next time yuh set out to
herd sheep better see the boss first and git on the job right

He rose to his feet surveyed Andy with his hands on his hips mentally
pronounced the job well done and took a generous chew of tobacco after
which he grinned down at the trussed one

That the language uh flowers youre talkin he inquired banteringly
before he turned his attention to the horse which he disposed of by
tying up the reins and giving it a slap on the rump When it had trotted
fifty yards down the coulee bottom and showed a disposition to go
farther he whistled to his dogs and turned again to Andy

This here is just a hint to that bunch you trot with to leave us and
our sheep alone he said We dont pick no quarrels but were goin
to cross our sheep wherever we dern please to git where we want to go
Gawd didnt make this range and hand it over to you cowmen to put in yer
pocketsI guess theres a chance fer other folks to hang on by their
eyebrows anyway

Andy lying there like a very good presentation of a giant cocoon roped
round and round with his arms pinned to his sides had the doubtful
pleasure of seeing that noisome foolishfaced band trail down Antelope
coulee and back upon the level they had just left and of knowing to a
gloomy certainty that he could do nothing about it except swear and
even that palls when a man has gone over his entire repertoire three
times in rapid succession

Andy therefore when the last sheep had trotted out of sight hearing
and smell wriggled himself into as comfortable a position as his bonds
would permit and took a nap



CHAPTER VII Truth Crushed to Earth etc

Andy only half awake tried to obey both instinct and habit and reach
up to pull his hat down over his eyes so that the sun could not shine
upon his lids so hotly when he discovered that he could do no more than
wiggle his fingers he came back with a jolt to reality and tried to sit
up It is surprising to a man to discover suddenly just how important a
part his arms play in the most simple of body movements Andy with his
arms pinioned tightly the whole length of them rolled over on his face
kicked a good deal and rolled back again but he did not sit up as he
had confidently expected to do

He lay absolutely quiet for at least five minutes staring up at the
brilliant blue arch above him Then he began to speak rapidly and
earnestly a man just close enough to hear his voice sweeping up to a
certain rhetorical climax pausing there and commencing again with a
rhythmic fluency of intonation might have thought that he was repeating
poetry indeed it sounded like some of Miltons majestic blank
verse but it was not Andy was engaged in a methodical scientific
reprehensibly soulsatisfying period of swearing

A curlew soaring low with long beak outstretched before him and
long legs outstretched behind cast a beady eye upon him and shrilled
Correck Correck in unregenerate approbation of the blasphemy

Andy stopped suddenly and laughed Glad you agree with me old sport
he addressed the bird whimsically with a reaction to his normally
cheerful outlook Sheepherders are all those things I named over
birdie and some that I cant think of at present

He tried again this time with a more careful realization of his
limitations to assume an upright position and being a persevering
young man and one with a ready wit he managed at length to wriggle
himself back upon the slope from which he had slid in his sleep and by
digging in his heels and going carefully he did at last rise upon his
knees and from there triumphantly to his feet

He had at first believed that one of the herders would in the course
of an hour or so return and untie him when he hoped to be able to
retrieve in a measure his selfrespect which he had lost when the
first three feet of his own rope had encircled him To be tied and
trussed by sheepherders Andy gritted his teeth and started down the
coulee

He was hungry and his lunch was tied to his saddle He looked eagerly
down the coulee in the faint hope of seeing his horse grazing somewhere
along its length until the numbness of his arms and hands reminded him
that forty lunches tied upon forty saddles at his side would be of no
use to him in his present position His hands he could not move from his
thighs he could wiggle his fingerswhich he did to relieve as much
as possible that unpleasant prickly sensation which we call a going to
sleep of the afflicted members When it occurred to him that he could
not do anything with his horse if he found it he gave up looking for it
and started for the ranch walking awkwardly because of his bonds the
sun shining hotly upon his brown head because his hat had been knocked
off in the scuffle and he could not pick it up and put it back where it
belonged

Taking a straight course across the prairie he struck Flying U coulee
at the point where the sheep had left it On the way there he had
crossed their trail where they went through the fence farther along
the coulee than before and therefore with a better chance of passing
undetected especially since the Happy Family believing that he was
forcing them steadily to the north would not be watching for sheep The
barbed wire barrier bothered him somewhat He was compelled to lie down
and roll under the fence in the most undignified manner and when he
was through there was the problem of getting upon his feet again But
he managed it somehow and went on down the coulee perspiring with the
heat and a bitter realization of his ignominy What the Happy Family
would have to say when they saw him even Andy Greens vivid imagination
declined to picture

He knew by the sun that it was full noon when he came in sight of the
stable and corrals and his soul sickened at the thought of facing that
derisive bunch of punchers with their fiendish grins and their barbed
tongues But he was hungry and his arms had reached the limit of
prickly sensations and were numb to his shoulders He shook his hair
back from his beaded forehead cast a wary glance at the silent stables
set his jaw and went on up the hill to the messhouse wishing tardily
that he had waited until they were off at work again when he might
intimidate old Patsy into keeping quiet about his predicament

Within the messhouse was the clatter of knives and forks plied by
hungry men the sound of desultory talk and a savory odor of good
things to eat The door was closed Andy stood before it as a
guiltyconscienced child stands before its teacher clicked his teeth
together and since he could not open the door lifted his right foot
and gave it a kick to strain the hinges

Within were exclamations of astonishment silence and then a heavy
tread Patsy opened the door gasped and stood still his eyes popping
out like a startled rabbit

Well whats eating you Andy demanded querulously and pushed past
him into the room

Not all of the Happy Family were there Cal Jack Bates Irish and
Happy Jack had gone into the Bad Lands next to the river but there were
enough left to make the soul of Andy quiver forebodingly and to send
the flush of extreme humiliation to his cheeks

The Happy Family looked at him in stunned surprise then they glanced at
one another in swift wordless inquiry grinned wisely and warily and
went on with their dinner At least they pretended to go on with
their dinner while Andy glared at them with amazed reproach in his
misleadingly honest gray eyes

When youve got plenty of time he said at last in a choked tone
maybe one of you obliging cusses will untie this damned rope

Why sure Pink threw a leg over the bench and got up with cheerful
alacrity Ill do it now if you say so I didnt know but what that
was some new fad of yours like

Fad Andy repeated the word like an explosion

Well by golly Andy neednt think Im goin to foller that there
style Slim stated solemnly I need m rope for something else than to
tie n clothes on with

I sure do hate to see a man wear funny things just to make himself
conspicuous Pink observed while he fumbled at the knot which was
intricate Andy jerked away from him that he might face him ragefully

Maybe this looks funny to you he cried husky with wrath But I
cant seem to see the joke myself I admit I let then herders make
a monkey of me They slipped up behind going down into Antelope
coulee and slid down the bluff onto me and before I could get up
they got me tied all right I licked one of en before that and
thought I had en gentled down

Andy stopped short silenced by that unexplainable sense which warns us
when our words are received with cold disbelief

MhhmI thought maybe youd run up against a hostile jackrabbit or
something Pink purred and went back to his place on the bench

Hawhawhawww came Big Medicines tardy bellow Thats more
reasonable than the sheepherder story by cripes

Andy looked at them much as he had stared up at the sky before he began
to swearspeechlessly with a trembling of the muscles around his
mouth He was quite white considering how tanned he was and his
forehead was shiny with beads of perspiration standing thickly upon it

Weary I wish youd untie this rope I cant He spoke still in that
peculiar husky tone and when the last words were out his teeth went
together with a snap

Weary glanced inquiringly across at the Native Son who was regarding
Andy steadily as one gazes upon a tangled rope looking for the end
which will easiest lead to an untangling

Miguels brown eyes turned languidly to meet the look Youd better
untie him he advised in his soft drawl He may not be in the habit of
doing itbut hes telling the truth

Untie me Miguel begged Andy going over to him and let me at this
bunch

Ill do it said Weary and rose pacifically I kinda believe you
myself Andy But you cant blame the boys none youve fooled em till
theyre dead shy of anything they cant see through And besides it
sure does look like a plant Id back you singlehanded against a dozen
sheepherders like then two weve been chasing around If I hadnt felt
that way I wouldnt have sent yuh out alone with em

Well Andy neednt think hes goin to stick me on that there story
Slim declared with brutal emphasis Ive swallered too many baits
by golly Hes figurin on gettin us all out on the warpath runnin
around in circles sost he can give us the laugh Ill bet by golly
he paid then herders to tie him up like that He cant fool me

Say Slim I do believe your brains is commencin to sprout Big
Medicine thumped him painfully upon the back by way of accenting the
compliment You got the idee all right

Andy stood quiet while Weary unwound the rope lifted his numbed arms
with some difficulty and displayed to the doubters his ropecreased
wrists and purple swollen hands

I couldnt fight a caterpiller right now he said thickly Look at
them hands Do yuh call that a josh Ive been tied up like a bedroll
for five hours you Well never mind he merely repeated a part of
what he had recited aloud in Antelope coulee the only difference being
that he applied the vitriolic utterances to the Happy Family instead of
to sheepherders and that with the second recitation he gained much in
fluency and dramatic delivery

It is not nice for a man to swear to swear the way Andy did at any
rate But the result perhaps atoned in a measure for the wickedness in
that the Happy Family were absolutely convinced of his sincerity and
the feelings of Andy greatly relieved so that when he had for the
third time that day completely exhausted his vocabulary he sat down and
began to eat his dinner with a keen appetite

I dont suppose you know where your horse is at by this tine Weary
observed as casually as possible breaking a somewhat constrained
silence

I dontand I dont give a darn Andy snapped back He ate a few
mouthfuls and added less savagely He wasnt in sight as I came
along I didnt follow the trail I struck straight across and came down
the coulee He may be at the gate and he may be down toward Rogers

Pink reached for a toothpick eyeing Andy sidelong dimpled his cheeks
disarmingly and cleared his throat Please dont kill me off when you
get that pie swallowed he began pacifically Strange as it may seem
I believe you Andy What I want to know is this Who owns them Dots
And what are they chasing all over the Flying U range for It looks
plumb malicious to me Did you find out anything about en Andy while
youerwhile they His eyes twinkled and betrayed him for an arrant
pretender Pink was not afraid of anything on earthleast of all Andy
Green

I will kill yuh by inches if I hear any remarks out of yuh that
aint respectful Andy promised thawing to his normal tone which was
pleasant to the ear I didnt find out much about em The fellow I
licked told me that Whittaker and Oleson owned the sheep He didnt
say

Wellbygolly Shin thrust his head forward belligerently
Whittaker Well what dyuh think uh that He glared from one face
to the other his gaze at last resting upon Weary Say do yuh reckon
itsDunk

Weary paid no heed to Slim He leaned forward his face turned to Andy
with that concentration of attention which means so much more than mere
exclamation Youre sure he said Whittaker he asked

His tone and his attitude arrested Andys cup midway to his mouth
SureWhittaker and Oleson I never heard of the outfitwhos this
Whittaker person

Weary settled back in his place and smiled but his eyes had quite lost
their habitually sunny expression

Up until four years ago he explained evenly he was the Old Mans
partner We caught him in some mighty dirty work andwell he sold
out to the Old Man The old party with the hoofs and tail cant be
everywhere at once the way Ive got it sized up so he turns some of
his business over to other folks Dunk Whittakers his top hand

Why by golly he framed up a job on the Gordon boys and railroaded
em to the pen just

Oh thats the gazabo Andys eyes shone with enlightenment Ive
heard a lot about Dunk but I didnt know his last name

Say Ill bet theyre the outfit that bought out Denson Thats why old
Denson acted so queer maybe Selling to a sheep outfit would make the
old devil feel kinda uneasy talking to us Pinks eyes were big and
purple with excitement And that trainload of sheep we saw Sunday
Ill bet is the same identical outfit

Dunk Whittakerd better not try to monkey with me by golly Slims
face was lowering And hed better not monkey with the Flying U either
Id pump him so full uh holes hed look like a colander by golly

Weary got up and started to the door his face suddenly grown careworn
Slim you and Miguel better go and hunt up Andys horse he said with
a hint of abstraction in his tone as though his mind was busy with more
important things Maybe Andyll feel able to help you set those posts
Budand youd better go along the upper end of the little pasture with
the wire stretchers and tighten her up the top wire is pretty loose I
noticed this morning His fingers fumbled with the doorknob

Want me to do anything Pink asked quizzically just behind him I
thought sure wed go and remonstrate with then gay

Weary interrupted him The herders can waitand anyway Ive kinda
got an idea Andy wants to hand out his own brand of poison to that
bunch You and I will take a ride over to Densons and see whats going
on over there Mamma he added fervently under his breath I sure do
wish Chip and the Old Man were here



CHAPTER VIII The Dot Outfit

Before he laid him down to sleep that night Weary had repeated to
himself many times and fervently that wish for old J G Whitmore and
the stout staff upon which he was beginning more and more to lean his
brotherinlaw Chip Bennett As matters stood Weary could not even
bring himself to let then know anything about his troubleand that the
thing was beginning to assume the form and shape and general malevolent
attributes of Trouble Weary was forced to admit to himself

Just at present an unthinking unobserving person might pass over
this sheep outfit as a mere unsavory incident but Weary was neither
unobserving nor unthinkingnor for the matter of that were the
rest of the Happy Family It needed no Happy Jack with his foreboding
nature to point out the unpleasant possibilities that night when the
committee of two made their informal report at the supper table

They had ridden to Denson coulee which was in reality a meandering
branch of Flying U coulee itself To reach it one rode out of Flying
U coulee and over a wide hill and down again to Densons But the
creekFlying U creekfollowed the devious turnings from Denson coulee
down to the Flying U A long mile of Flying U coulee J G Whitmore
owned outright Another mile he held under no other title save a fence
The creek flowed through it allbut that creek had its source somewhere
up near the head of Denson coulee J G Whitmore had to his regret
been unable to claim the whole earthor at least that portion of
itfor his own so when he was constrained to make a choice he
settled himself in the wider more fertile coulee which he thereafter
called the Flying U While it is good policy to locate as near as
possible to the source of those erratic little creeks which water
certain garden spots of the northern range land it is also well to
choose land that will grow plenty of hay J G Whitmore chose the hay
land and trusted that providence would insure the water supply Through
all these years Flying U creek had never once disappointed him Denson
who settled in the tributary coulee had not made any difference in the
water supply and his stock had consisted of thirty or forty head of
cattle and horses

When Denson sold however things might be different And if he had
sold to a sheepman the change might be unpleasant If he had sold to
Dunk Whittakerthe Flying U boys faced that possibility just as they
would face any other disaster undaunted but grim and unsmiling

It was thus that Pink and Weary rode slowly down into Denson coulee Two
miles back they had passed the band of Dot sheep feeding leisurely
just without the Flying U fence which was the southern boundary The
bugkiller and the other were there and they noted that the features
of that other bore witness to the truth of Andys story of the fight He
regarded them with one perfectly good eye and one which was considerably
swollen and grinned a swollen grin

The two had ridden ten paces past him when Pink pulled up suddenly Im
going to get off and lick that sonofagun myself just for luck he
stated dispassionately Im going to lick em both he revised while
he dismounted

Oh come on Cadwalloper Weary dissuaded Youll likely have all the
excitement you need without that

Here you hold this fool cayuse No He shook his head cutting short
further protest Youre the boss and you dont want to mix in and
that part is all right But I aint responsibleand I sure am going
to take a fall or two out of these geesers Theyre awl together too
stuck on themselves to suit me Pink did not say that he was thinking
of Andy but nevertheless a vivid recollection of that unfortunate young
mans ropecreased wrists and swollen hands sent him toward the herder
with long eager strides

Pink was not tall and he was slight and boyish of build also his
cherubic face topped by tawny curls and lighted by eyes as deeply blue
and as innocent as a babys probably deceived that herder just as
they had deceived many another For Pink was a good deal like a stick
of dynamite wrapped in white tissue paper and tied with blue ribbon
and Weary was not at all uneasy over the outcome as he watched Pink go
clanking back though he loved him well

Pink did not waste any time or words on the preliminaries With a
delightful frankness of purpose he pulled off his coat and threw it
on the ground as he came up sent his hat after it and arrived fist
first

The herder had waited grinning and he had shouted something to Weary
about spanking the kid if Weary didnt make him behave Speedily he
became a very surprised herder and a distressed one as well

All right Pink remarked a little quickbreathed when the herder
decided for the third time to get up A friend of mine worked yuh over
a little this morning and I just thought Id make a better job than he
did Your eyes didnt match They will now

The herder mumbled maledictions after him but Pink would not even give
him the satisfaction of resenting it

Id like to have broken a knuckle against his teeth darn him he
observed ruefully when he was in the saddle again Come on Weary It
wont take but a minute to hand a punch or two to that bugkiller
and then Ill feel better Theyve both got it comingcome on This
because Weary showed a strong inclination to take the trail and keep it
to his destination Well Ill go alone then Ive got to kinda square
myself for the way I threw it into Andy and you know blamed well
Weary they played it lowdown on him or theyd never have got that
rope on him And Im going to lick that

Mamma You sure are a rambunctious person when you feel that way
Weary made querulous comment but he rode over with Pink to where the
bugkiller was standing with his long stick held in a somewhat menacing
manner and once more he held Pinks horse for him

Pink was gone longer this time and he came back with a cut lip and a
large lump on his forehead the bugkiller had thrown a small rock with
the precision which comes of much practicesuch as stoning disobedient
dogs and the likeand when Pink rushed at him furiously the herder
caught him very neatly alongside the head with his stick These little
amenities serving merely to whet Pinks appetite for battle he stopped
long enough to thrash that particular herder very thoroughly and to his
own complete satisfaction

Well I guess Im ready to go on now he observed dimpling rather
onesidedly as he got back on his horse

I thought maybe youd want to whip the dogs too Weary told him
dryly which was the nearest he came to expressing any disapproval
of the incident Weary was a peaceloving soul whenever peace was
compatible with selfrespect and it would never have occurred to him to
punish strange men as summarily as Pink had done

I would if the dogs were half as ornery as the men Pink retorted
Say they hang together like bull snakes and rattlers dont they If
they was human theyd have helped each other outbut nothing doing Do
you reckon a man could ride up to a couple of our bunch and thrash one
at a time without the other fellow having something to say about it He
turned in the saddle and looked back So help me Josephine Ive got a
good mind to go back and lick them again for not hanging together like
they ought to But the threat was an idle one and they went on to
Densons Weary still with that anxious look in his eyes and Pink quite
complacent over his exploit

In Denson coulee was an unwonted atmosphere of activity heretofore the
place had been animated chiefly by young Densons engaged in the pursuit
of pleasure but now a covered buggy evidently just arrived bore mute
witness to the new order of things There were more horses about the
place a covered wagon or two three or four men working upon the
corral and lastly there was one whom Weary recognized the moment he
caught sight of him

Looks like a sheep outfit all right he said somberly And if that
aint old Dunk himself its the devil and thats next thing to him

Dunk they judged had just arrived with another man whom they did not
know a tall man with light hair that hung lank to his collar a thin
sharpnosed face and a wide mouth which stretched easily into a smile
but which was none the pleasanter for that When he turned inquiringly
toward them they saw that he was stoopshouldered though not from any
deformity but from sheer slouching lankness Dunk gave them a swift
sour look from under his eyebrows and went on

Weary rode straight past the lank man whom he judged to be Oleson and
overtook Dunk Whittaker himself

Hello Dunk he said cheerfully sliding over in the saddle so that a
foot hung free of the stirrup as men who ride much have learned to do
when they stop for a chat thereby resting while they may Back on the
old stamping ground are you

Since you see me here I suppose I am Dunk made churlish response

Do you happen to own those Dot sheep back there on the hill Weary
tilted his head toward home

I happen to own half of them By then they had reached the gate and
Dunk passed through and started on to the house

Oh dont be in a rushcome on back and be sociable Weary called
out in the mildest of tones twisting the reins around his saddlehorn
so that he might roll a cigarette at ease

Dunk remembered perhaps certain things he had learned when he was
J G Whitmores partner and had more or less to do with the charter
members of the Happy Family He came back and stood by the gate
ungraciously enough to be sure still he came back Weary smiled under
cover of lighting his cigarette Dunk by that reluctant compliance
betrayed something which Weary had been rather anxious to know

Weve been having a little trouble with those sheep of yours Weary
remarked between puffs Youve got some poor excuses for humans herding
them They drove the bunch across our coulee just exactly three times
There aint enough grass left in our lower field to graze a prairie
dog He glanced back to see where Pink was saw that he was close
behind as was the lank man and spoke in a tone that included them all

The Flying U aint pasturing sheep this spring he informed them
pleasantly But seeing the grass is eat up well let yuh pay for it
Why didnt you bring them in along the trail anyway

I didnt bring them in I just came down from Butte today I suppose
the herders brought them out where the feed was best they did if
theyre worth their wages

They happened to strike some feed that was pretty expensive And
he smiled down at Whittaker misleadingly you ought to keep an eye
on those herders or they might let you in for another grass bill The
Flying U has got quite a lot of range right around here you recollect
And weve got plenty of cattle to eat it We dont need any help to keep
the grass down so we can ride through it

Now look here began the lank man with that sort of persuasiveness
which can turn instantly into bluster all this is pure foolishness
you know Were here to stay Weve bought this place and some other
land to go with it and we expect to stay right here and make a living
It happens that we expect to make a living off of sheep Now we dont
want to start in by quarreling with our neighbors and we dont want our
neighbors to start any quarrel with us All we want

Mamma Youre taking a fine way to make us love yuh Weary cut in
ironically I know what you want You want the same as every other meek
and lovely sheepman wants You want it allcore seeds and peeling
Dunk he said with a more impatient disgust than he was in the habit
of showing for his fellowmen this mans a stranger but I should think
youd know better than to come in here with sheep

I dont know why a sheep outfit isnt exactly as good as a cow outfit
and I dont know why they havent as much right here Youre welcome to
what land you own but it always seemed to me that public land is open
to the use of the public Now as Oleson says we expect to raise sheep
here and we expect your outfit to leave us alone As far as our sheep
crossing your coulee is concernedI dont know that they did But if
they did and if they did any damage let J G do the talking about
that I deal with the ownersnot with the hired men

Weary you must understand was never a bellicose young man But for
all that he leaned over and gave Dunk a slap on the jaw which must have
stung considerablyand the full reason for his violence lay four years
behind the two when Dunk was part owner of the Flying U and when his
sneering arrogance had been very hard to endure

Are you going to swallow thatfrom a hired man Weary inquired
after a minute during which nothing whatever occurred beyond the slow
reddening of Dunks face

Im not going to fight if thats what you mean Dunk sneered I
decline to bring myself down to your level One doesnt expect anything
from a jackass but a bray you knowand one doesnt feel compelled to
bray because the jackass does He smiled that supercilious smile which
Weary had hated of old and which he knew was well used to covering
much treachery and small meannesses of various sorts

As I said if the Flying U has any claim against us let the owner
present it in the usual way Dunk drew down his black brows lifted a
corner of his lip and turned his back deliberately upon them

Oleson let himself through the gate which he closed somewhat hastily
behind him Im sorry you fellows seem to want to make trouble he
said without looking up from the latch which seemed somewhat out of
repair like the rest of the Denson property Thats a poor way
to start in with new neighbors He lifted his hat with what Pink
considered insulting politeness and followed Dunk into the house

Weary waited there until they had gone in and closed the door then
turned and rode back home again frowning thoughtfully at the trail
ahead of them all the way and making no reply to Pinks importunings
for war

Id hate to say youve lost your nerve Weary Pink cried at last in
sheer desperation But why the devil didnt you get down and thump the
daylights out of that black sonofagun I came pretty near walking
into him myself only I hate to butt into another fellows scrap But
if Id known you were going to set there and let him walk off with that
sneer on his face

I cant fight a man that wont hit back Weary protested You
couldnt either Cadwalloper Youd have done just what I did youd
have let him go

He will hit back all right enough Pink retorted passionately Hell
do it when you aint looking though He

I know it Weary sighed Im kinda sorry now I slapped him Hell
hit backbut he wont hit me hell aim at the outfit If the Old Man
was here or Chip Id feel a whole lot easier in my mind

They couldnt do anything you cant do Pink assured him loyally
forgetting his petulance when he saw the careworn look in Wearys
face All they can do is gobble all the range around hereand I guess
theres a few of us that will have a word or two to say about that

What makes me sore Weary confided is knowing that Dunk isnt
thinking altogether of the dollar end of it Hes tickled to death to
get a whack at the outfit And I hate to see him get away with it but I
guess well have to stand for it

That sentiment did not please Pink nor when Weary repeated it later
that evening in the bunkhouse did it please the Happy Family The less
pleasing it was because it was perfectly true and every man of them knew
it Beyond keeping the sheep off Flying U land there was nothing they
could do without stepping over the line into lawlessnessand while
they were not in any sense a meek Happy Family they were far more
lawabiding than their conversation that night made them appear



CHAPTER IX More Sheep

The next week was a time of harassment for the Flying U a week
filled to overflowing with petty irritations traceable directly or
indirectly to their new neighbors the Dot sheepmen The band in charge
of the bugchaser and that other unlovable man from Wyoming fed just as
close to the Flying U boundary as their guardians dared let them feed a
great deal closer than was good for the tempers of the Happy Family who
rode fretfully here and there upon their own business and at the same
time tried to keep an eye upon their unsavory neighborsa proceeding as
nerveracking as it was futile

The Native Son riding home in jingling haste from Dry Lake whither
he had hurried one afternoon in the hope of cheering news from Chicago
reported another trainload of Dots on the wide level beyond Antelope
coulee There were he said four men in charge of the band and he
believed they carried guns though he was not positive of that They
were moving slowly and he thought they would not attempt to cross
Flying U coulee before the next day though from the course they were
taking he was sure they meant to cross

Coupled with that bit of illtidings the brief note from Chip saying
very little about the Old Man but implying a good deal by its very
omissions would have been enough to send the Happy Family to sleepless
beds that night if they had been the kind to endure with silent
fortitude their troubles

If you fellers would back me up brooded Big Medicine down by the
corral after supper Id see to it them sheep never gits across the
coulee by cripes Id send em so far the other way theyd git plumb
turned around and forgit they ever wanted to go south

Its all Dunks devilishness Jack Bates declared He could take them
in the other way even if the feed aint so good along the trail Its
most all prairiedog townsbut thats good enough for sheep Jack in
his intense partisanship spoke as if sheep were not entitled to decent
grass at any time or under any circumstances

Them herders packin guns looks to me like theyre goin to make
trouble if they kin gloomed Happy Jack I betche theyll kill
somebody before theyre through When sheepmen gits mean

Pink picked up his rope and started for the large corral where a few
saddle horses had been driven in just before supper and had not yet been
turned out

You fellows can stand around and chew the rag if you want to he said
caustically and wait for Weary to make a wartalk But Im going to
keep cases on them Dots if I have to stand an allnight guard on em I
dont blame Weary hes looking out for the lawandorder businessand
thats all right But Im not in charge of the outfit Im going to do
as I darn please and if they dont like my style they can give me my
time

Good for you Little One Big Medicine hurried to overtake him so
that he might slap him on the shoulder with his favorite sledgehammer
method of signifying his approval of a mans sentiments Honest to
grandma I was just bginnin to think this bunch was gitting all
streaked up with yeller Course we aint goin to wait for no official
orders by cripes Id ruther lock Weary up in the blacksmith shop than
let him tell us to go ahead Go awn and tell him a good stiff lie
Andyjust to keep him interested while us fellers make a gitaway He
aint in on this we dont want him in on it

What yuh goin to do Happy Jack inquired suspiciously Yuh cant
go and monkey with them sheep er them herders They aint on our land
And if you dont git killed old Dunkll fix yuh like he fixed the
Gordon boysI know himto a fareyouwell Itd tickle him to death to
git something on us fellers I betche thats what hes aiming tdo Git
us to fightin his outfit sost

Oh go off and lie down Andy implored him contemptuously Were
going to hang those herders and drive the sheep all over a cutback
somewhere like Jesus done to the hogs and then were going over and
murder old Dunk if hes at home and burn the house to hide the guilty
deed And if the sheriff comes snooping around asking disagreeable
questions well all swear you done it So now you know our plans shut
your face and go on to bed And be sure he added witheringly you
pull the soogans over your head so you wont hear the dying shriek of
our victims Were liable to get kinda excited and torture em a while
before we kill em

Aw gwan gulped Happy Jack mechanically You make me sick If yuh
think Im goin to swaller all that youre away off You wouldnt dast
do nothing of the kind and if yuh did youd sure have a sweet time
layin it onto me

Oh I dont know drawled the Native Son with a slow velveteyed
glance any jury in the country would hang you on your looks Happy I
knew a man down in the lower part of California who was arrested tried
and hanged for murder And all the evidence there was against him was
the fact that he was seen within five miles of the place on the same day
the murder was committed and his face They had an expert physiognomist
there and he swore that the fellow had the face of a murderer the poor
devil looked like a criminaland though he had one of the best lawyers
on the Coast it was adios for him

I spose you mean I got the face of a criminal sputtered Happy Jack
It aint always the purty fellers that wins outlike you n Pink I
never seen the purty man yit that was worth the powder itd take to
blow him up Aw you fellers make me sick He went off muttering his
opinion of them all and particularly of the Native Son who smiled
while he listened You go awn and start somethingand youll wisht you
hadnt they heard him croak from the big gate and chuckled over his
wrath

As a matter of fact the Happy Family as a whole or as individuals
had no intention of committing any great violence that evening Pink
wanted to see just where this new band of sheep was spending the night
and to find out if possible what were the herders intentions Since
the boys were all restless under their worry and since there is a
contagious element in seeking a troublezone none save Happy Jack who
was sore at them and Weary stayed behind in the coulee with old Patsy
while the others rode away up the grade and out toward Antelope coulee
beyond

They meant only to reconnoiter and to warn the herders against
attempting to cross Flying U coulee though they were not exactly
sure that they would be perfectly polite or that they would confine
themselves rigidly to the language they were wont to employ at dances
Andy Green in particular seemed rather to look forward with pleasure
to the meeting Andy by the way had remained heartbrokenly passive
during that whole week because Weary had extracted from him a promise
which Andy mendacious though he had the name of being felt constrained
to keep intact Though of a truth it irked him much to think of two
sheepherders walking abroad unpunished for their outrage upon his
person

Weary as he had made plain to them all wanted to avoid trouble if it
were possible to do so And though they grinned together in secret
over his own affair with Dunkwhich was not in their opinion exactly
pacificthey meant to respect his wishes as far as human nature was
able to do so So that the Happy Family galloping toward the red sunset
and the great gray blot on the prairie just where the glory of
the west tinged the grass blades with red were not onehalf as
bloodthirsty as they had proclaimed themselves to be

While they were yet afar off they could see two men walking slowly in
the immediate vicinity of the huddled band A hundred yards away was
a small tent with a couple of horses picketed near by and feeding
placidly The men turned gazed long at their approach and walked to
the tent which they entered somewhat hastily

Look at em dodge outa sight will you cried Cal Emmett and lifted
up his voice in the yell which sometimes announced the Happy Familys
arrival in Dry Lake after a long thirsty absence on roundup Other
voices joined in after that first shrill Owowoweee of Cals so
that presently the whole lot of them were emitting nervecrimping yells
and spurring their horses into a thunder of hoofbeats as they bore down
upon the tent Between howls they laughed picturing to themselves four
terrified sheepherders cowering within those frail canvas walls

Im a rambler and a gambler and far from my hoome And if yuh dont
like me jest leave me aloone chanted Big Medicine most horribly
and finished with a yell that almost scared himself and set his horse to
plunging wildly

Come out of there you lopeared muttonchewers and let us pick the
wool outa your teeth shouted Andy Green telling himself hastily
that this was not breaking his promise to Weary and yielding to the
temptation of coming as close to the guilty persons as he might for
while these were not the men who had tied him and left him alone on the
prairie they belonged to the same outfit and there was some comfort in
giving them a few disagreeable minutes

Pink in the lead was turning to ride around the tent still yelling
when someone within the tent fired a rifleand did not aim as high as
he should The bullet zipped close over the head of Big Medicine who
happened to be opposite the crack between the tentflaps The hand of
Big Medicine jerked back to his hip but quick as he was the Native
Son plunged between him and the tent before he could take aim

Steady amigo smiled Miguel You arent a crazy sheepherder

No but Im goin to kill off one Git outa my way Big Medicine was
transformed into a coldeyed ironjawed fighting machine He dug the
spurs in meaning to ride ahead of Miguel But Miguels spurs also
pressed home so that the two horses plunged as one Big Medicine
bellowing one solitary oath drew his right leg from the stirrup to
dismount Miguel reached out caught him by the arm and held him to the
saddle And though Big Medicine was a strong man the grip held firm
and unyielding

You must think of the outfit you know said Miguel smiling still
There must be no shooting Once that begins He shrugged his
shoulders with that slight eloquent movement which the Happy Family
had come to know so well He was speaking to them all as they crowded
up to the scuffle The man who feels the triggeritch had better throw
his gun away he advised coolly I know boys Ive seen these things
start before All hell cant stop you once you begin to shoot Put it
up Bud or give it to me

The man dont live that can shoot at me by cripes and git away with
it Not if he misses killin me Big Medicine was shaking with rage
but the Native Son saw that he hesitated nevertheless and laughed
outright

Call him out and give him a thumping Thats good enough for a
sheepherder he suggested as a substitute

Perhaps because the Native Son so seldom offered advice and because of
his cool courage in interfering with Big Medicine at such a time Buds
jaw relaxed and his pale eyes became more human in their expression He
even permitted Miguel to remove the big wicked Colt from his hand
and slide it into his own pocket whereat the Happy Family gasped with
astonishment Not even Pink would have dreamed of attempting such a
thing

Well hes got to come out and take a lickin anyway shouted Big
Medicine vengefully and rode close enough to slap the canvas smartly
with his quirt By all the gods he knew by name he called upon the
offender to come forth while the others drew up in a rude halfcircle
to await developments Heavy silence was the reply he got It was as
though the men within were sitting tense and watchful like cougars
crouched for a spring with claws unsheathed and muscles quivering

You better come out called Andy sharply after they had waited a
decent interval We didnt come here hunting trouble we want to know
where youre headed for with these sheep The fellow that cut loose with
the gun

Aw dont talk so purty Im gitting almighty tired just setting here
lettin m legs hang down Git your ropes boys With one sweeping
gesture of his arm Big Medicine made plain his meaning as he rode a few
paces away his fingers fumbling with the string that held his rope
Im goin to have a look at em anyway he grinned I sure do hate
to see men act so bashful

With his rope free and ready for action Big Medicine shook the loop
out glanced around and saw that Andy Pink and Cal Emmett were also
ready and with a dexterous flip settled the noose neatly over the
iron pin that thrust up through the end of the ridgepole in front
Andys loop sank neatly over it a second later and the two wheeled and
dashed away together with Pink and Irish duplicating their performance
at the other end of the tent The dingy smokestained canvas swayed
toppled as the pegs gave way and finally lay flat upon the prairie
fifty feet from where it had stood leaving the inmates exposed to the
cruel stare of eight unfriendly cowpunchers Four cowering figures they
were with guns in their hands that shook

Drop them guns thundered Big Medicine flipping his rope loose and
recoiling it mechanically as he plunged up to the group

One man obeyed One gave a squawk of terror and permitted his gun to go
off at random before he fled toward the coulee The other two crouched
behind their bedrolls set their jaws doggedly and glared defiance

Pink Andy Irish Big Medicine and the Native Son slid off their horses
and made a rush at them A rifle barked viciously and Slim sitting
prudently on his horse well in the rear gave a yell and started for
home at a rapid pace

Considering the provocation the Happy Family behaved with quite
praiseworthy selfcontrol and leniency They did not lynch those two
herders They did not kill them either by bullets knives or beating
to death They took away the guns however and they told them with
extreme bluntness what sort of men they believed them to be They
defined accurately their position in society at large in that
neighborhood and stated what would be their future fate if they
persisted in acting with so little caution and common sense

At Andy Greens earnest behest they also wound them round and round with
ropes before they departed and gave them some very good advice upon
the matter of range rules and the herding of sheep particularly of Dot
sheep

Youre playing big luck if you only had sense enough to know it Andy
pointed out to the recumbent three before they rode away We didnt
come over here on the warpath and if you hadnt got in such a darned
hurry to start something youd be a whole lot more comfortable right
now We rode over to tell yuh not to start them sheep across Flying U
coulee because if you do youre going to have both hands and your
hats plumb full uh trouble It has taken some little time and fussing
to get yuh gentled down so we can talk to you and I sure do hope yuh
remember what Im saying

Oh well remember it all right menaced one of the men lifting his
head turtlewise that he might glare at the group And our bossesll
remember it you neednt worry about that none You wait till

The next man to him turned his head and muttered a sentence and the
speaker dropped his head back upon the ground silenced

It was your own outfit started this style of rope trimming so you
cant kick about that part of the deal Pink informed them melodiously
Its liable to get to be all the rage with us So if you dont like
it dont come around where we are And say His dimples stood deep in
his cheeks You send those ropes home tomorrow will yuh Were liable
to need em

By cripes Big Medicine bawled What say we haze them sheep a few
miles north boys

Oh I guess theyll be all right where they are Andy protested his
thirst for revenge assuaged at sight of those three trussed as he had
been trussed and apparently not liking it any better than he had liked
it Theyll be good and careful not to come around the Flying Uor I
miss my guess a mile

The others cast comprehensive glances at their immediate surroundings
and decided that they had at least made their meaning plain there
was no occasion for emphasizing their disapproval any further They
confiscated the rifles and they told the fellows why they did so
They very kindly pulled a tarpaulin over the three to protect them in a
measure from the chill night that was close upon them and they wished
them good night and pleasant dreams and rode away home

On the way they met Weary and Happy Jack galloping anxiously to the
battle scene Slim it appeared from Wearys rapid explanation had
arrived at the ranch with his horse in a lather and with a fourinch
furrow in the fleshiest part of his leg where a bullet had flicked him
in passing The tale he told had led Weary to believe that Slim was the
sole survivor of that reckless company

Mamma Im so glad to see you boys able to fork your horses and swear
natural that I dont believe I can speak my little piece about staying
on your own side the fence and letting trouble do some of the hunting
he exclaimed thankfully I wish youd stayed at home and left these
blamed Dots alone But seeing yuh didnt Im tickled to death to hear
you didnt kill anybody off I dont want the folks to come home and
find the whole bunch in the pen It might look as if

You dont want the folks to come home and find the whole ranch sheeped
off either and the herders camping up in the white house do yuh
Pink inquired pointedly I kinda think he added dryly those same
herders will feel like going away around Flying U fences with their
sheep I dont believe theyll do any cutting across

I betche old Dunkll make it interestin fer this outfit just the
same Happy Jack predicted Tyin up three men uh hisn like that and
ropin their tent and draggin it off aint things hell pass up Hell
have a possy out hereyou see if he dont

In that case Ill be sorry for you Happy purred Miguel close beside
him Youre the only one in the outfit that looks capable of such a
vile deed

Oh Dunk wont do anything Weary said cheerfully Youll have to
take those guns back though They might take a notion to call that
stealing

You forget the Native Son reminded calmly that we left them three
good ropes in exchange

Whereupon the Happy Family laughed and went to offer their unsought
sympathy to Slim



CHAPTER X The Happy Family Herd Sheep

The boys of the Flying U had many faults in common aside from certain
individual frailties one of their chief weaknesses was overconfidence
in their own ability to cope with any situation which might arise
unexpectedly or otherwise and a belief that others felt that same
confidence in them and that enemies were wont to sit a long time
counting the cost before venturing to offer too great an affront Also
they believedand made it manifest in their conversationthat they
could even bring the Old Man back to health if they only had him on
the ranch where they could get at him They maligned the hospitals and
Chicago doctors most unjustly and were agreed that all he needed was
to be back on the ranch where somebody could look after him right They
asserted that if they ever got tired of living and wanted to cash in
without using a gun or anything theyd go to a hospital and tell the
doctors to turn loose and try to cure them of something

This by way of illustration also as an explanation of their sleeping
soundly that night instead of watching for some hostile demonstration
on the part of the Dot outfit To a manone never counted Happy Jacks
prophecies of disaster as being anything more than a personal deformity
of thoughtthey were positive in their belief that the Dot sheepherders
would be very very careful not to provoke the Happy Family to further
manifestations of disapproval They knew what theyd get if they tried
any more funny business and theyd be mighty careful where they drove
their sheep after this

So with the comfortable glow of victory in their souls they laid
them down and when the animated discussion of that nights adventure
flagged as their tongues grew sleepclogged and their eyelids drooped
they slept in peace save when Slim awakened by the soreness of his
leg grunted a malediction or two before he began snoring again

They rose and ate their breakfast in a fair humor with the world One
grows accustomed to the thought of sickness even when it strikes close
to the affections and with the resilience of youth and hope life
adjusts itself to make room for the specter of fear so that it does
not crowd unduly but stands halfforgotten in the background of ones
thoughts For that reason they no longer spoke soberly because of the
Old Man lying hurt unto death in Chicago And when they mentioned the
Dot sheep and men they spoke as men speak of the vanquished

With the taste of hot biscuits and maple syrup still lingering
pleasantly against their palates they went out and were confronted with
sheep blatting sheep stinking sheep devastating sheep Dot sheep On
the south side of the coulee up on the bluff grazed the band They fed
upon the brow of the hill opposite the ranch buildings they squeezed
under the fence and spilled a ragged fringe of running gray animals
down the slope Half a mile away though the nearest of them were the
murmur of them the smell of them the whole intolerable presence of
them filled the Happy Family with an amazed loathing too deep for
words

Technically that high level stretch of land bounding Flying U coulee
on the south was open range It belonged to the government The soil was
not fertile enough even for the most optimistic of dry land farmers to
locate upon it and this was before the dryland farming craze had swept
the country gathering in all public land as claims J G Whitmore
had contented himself with acquiring title to the whole of the Flying
U coulee secure in his belief that the old order of things would not
change in his lifetime at least and that the unwritten law of the
range land which leaves the vicinity of a ranch to the use of the ranch
owner would never be repealed by new customs imposed by a new class of
people

Legally there was no trespassing of the Dots beyond the two or three
hundred which had made their way through the fence Morally however
and by right of custom their offense would not be much greater if they
came on down the hill and invaded the Old Mans pet meadows just beyond
the little pasture

Ladies may read this story so I am not going to pretend to repeat the
things they said once they were released from dumb amazement I should
be compelled to improvise and substitutewhich would remove much of the
flavor Let bare facts suffice at present

They saddled in haste and in haste they rode to the scene This they
were convinced was the band herded by the bugkiller and the man from
Wyoming and the nerve of those two almost excited the admiration of the
Happy Family It did not however deter them from their purpose

Weary to look at him was no longer in the mood to preach patience and
a turning of the other cheek He also made that change of heart manifest
in his speech when Pink his eyes almost black rode up close and
gritted at him

Well whats the orders now Want me to go back and get the wire
nippers so we can let them poor little sheep down into the meadow Maybe
we better ask the herders down to have some of Patsys grub too I
dont believe they had time to cook much breakfast And it wouldnt be
a bad idea to haze our own stuff clear off the range Im afraid Dunks
sheep are going to fare kinda slim if we go on letting our cattle eat
all the good grass Pink did not often indulge in such lengthy sarcasm
especially toward his beloved Weary but his exasperation toward Wearys
mild tactics had been growing apace

Wearys reply I fear will have to be omitted It was terribly
unrefined

I want you boys to spread out around the whole bunch was his first
printable utterance and haze these sheep just as far south as they
can get without taking to the river Dont get all het up chasing em
yourselfmake the men Weary did not call them men he called them
something very naughty thats paid for it do the driving

And if they dont go drawled the smooth voice of the Native Son
what shall we do amigo Slap them on the wrist

Weary twisted in the saddle and sent him a baleful glance which was not
at all like Weary the sunnyhearted

If you cant figure that out for yourself he snapped you had better
go back and wipe the dishes for Patsy and when thats done you can
pull the weeds out of his radishes Maybe hell give you a nickel to buy
candy with if you do it good Before he faced to the front again his
harsh glance swept the faces of his companions

They were grinning every man of them and he knew why To see him lose
his temper was something of an event with the Happy Family who used
sometimes to fix the date of an incident by saying It was right after
that time Weary got mad a year ago last fall or something of the
sort He grinned himself shamefacedly and told them that they were
a bunch of noaccount cusses anyway and hed just about as soon herd
sheep himself as to have to run with such an outfit which swept his
anger from him and left him his usual self with but the addition of a
purpose from which nothing could stay him He was going to settle the
sheep question and he was going to settle it that day

Only one injunction did he lay upon the Happy Family You fellows dont
want to get excited and go to shooting he warned while they were
still out of hearing of the herders We dont want Dunk to get anything
like that on us savvy

They savvied and they told him so each after his own individual
manner

I guess we ought to be able to put the run on a couple of sheepherders
without wasting any powder Pink said loftily remembering his meeting
with them a few days before

One thing surewell make a good job of it this time promised Irish
and spurred after Weary who was leading the way around the band

The herders watched them openly and with the manner of men who are
expecting the worst to happen Unlike the four whose camp had been laid
low the night before these two were unarmed as they had been from the
first which in Wearys opinion was a bit of guile upon the part of
Dunk If trouble cametrouble which it would take a jury to settlethe
fact that the sheepmen were unarmed would tell heavily in their favor
for while the petty meanness of rangestealing and nagging trespass may
be harder to bear than the flourishing of a gun before ones face it
all sounds harmless enough in the telling

Weary headed straight for the nearest herder told him to put his dogs
to work rounding up the sheep which were scattered over an area half
a mile across while they fed and when the herder who was the
bugkiller made no move to obey Weary deliberately pulled his gun and
pointed at his head

You move he directed with grim intent and dont take too much time
about it either

The bugkiller an unkempt ungainly figure standing with his back to
the morning sun scowled up at Weary stolidly

Yuh dassent shoot he stated sourly and did not move

For answer Weary pulled back the hammer also he smiled as malignantly
as it was in his nature to do and hoped in his heart that he looked
sufficiently terrifying to convince the man So they faced each other in
a silent clash of wills

Big Medicine had not been saying much on the way over which was
unusual Now he rode forward until he was abreast of Weary and he
grinned down at the bugkiller in a way to distract his attention from
the gun

Nobody dont have to shoot by cripes he bawled We haint goin to
kill yuh Well make yuh wisht by cripes we had though bfore we
git through Git to work boys n gether up some dry grass an sticks
Over there in them rosebushes you oughta find enough bresh Well give
him a taste uh what we was talkin about comm over by cripes I guess
hell be willin to drive sheep all right when we git through with
him Hawhawhawww He leaned forward in the saddle and ogled the
bugkiller with horrid significance

Git busy with that bresh he yelled authoritatively when a glance
showed him that the Happy Family was hesitating and eyeing him
uncertainly Git a fire goin quicks yuh kinIll do the rest Down
in Coconino county we used to have a way uh fixin sheepherders

Aw gwan We dont want no torture business remonstrated Happy Jack
uneasily edging away

Yuh dont hey Big Medicine turned in the saddle wrathfully and
glared When he had succeeded in catching Andy Greens eye he winked
and that young mans face kindled understandingly Well now you
haint runnin this here show Honest to grandma Ive saw the time when
a little footwarmin done a sheepherder a whole lot uh good and it
looks to me by cripes as if this here feller needed a dose to gentle
him down You git the fire started Thats all I want you t do Happy
Some uh you boys help me rope himlike him and that other jasper over
there done to Andy Cmon Andyit aint goin to take long

You bet your sweet life Ill come on exclaimed Andy dismounting
eagerly Let me take your rope Weary Too bad we havent got a
branding iron

Aw we dont need no irons Big Medicine was also on the ground by
then and untying his rope Lemme git his shoes off once and Ill show
yuh

The bugkiller lifted his stick snarling like a mongrel dog when
a stranger tries to drive it out of the house hurled the stick
hysterically as Big Medicine rope in hand advanced implacably and
with a squawk of horror turned suddenly and ran After him bellowing
terribly lunged Big Medicine straight through the band like a
snowplow leaving behind them a wide open trail

Say we kinda overplayed that bet by gracious Andy commented to
Weary while he watched the chase That gazabos scared silly lets
try the other one That torture talk works fine

In his enthusiasm Andy remounted and was about to lead the way to
the other herder when Big Medicine returned puffing the bugkiller
squirming in his grasp Tell him what yuh want him to do Weary he
panted with some difficulty holding his limp victim upright by a
greasy coatcollar And if he dont fall over himself doin it whyby
cripeswell take off his shoes

Whereupon the bugkiller gave another howl and professed himself eager
to drive the sheepwell what he said was that he would drive them to
that place which ladies dislike to hear mentioned if the Happy Family
wanted him to

Thats all right then Start em south and dont quit till somebody
tells you to Weary carefully let down the hammer of his sixshooter
and shoved it thankfully into his scabbard

Now you dont want to pile it on quite so thick next time Irish
admonished Big Medicine when they turned away from watching the
bugkiller set his dogs to work by gestures and a shouted word or two
You like to have sent this one plumb nutty

I betche Bud gets us all pinched for that grumbled Happy Jack
Torturing folks is purty darned serious business You might as well
shoot em up decent and be done with it

Hawhawhawww Big Medicine ogled the group mirthfully Nobody
cant swear I done a thing or said a thing All I said definite was
that Id take off his shoes Any jury in the countryd know that
would be hull lot worse fer us than it would fer him by cripes
Hawhawhawww

Say thats right yuh didnt say nothin ner do nothin By golly
that was purty slick work all right Slim forgot his sore leg until he
clapped his hand enthusiastically down upon the place as comprehension
of Buds finesse dawned upon him He yelped and the Happy Family
laughed unfeelingly

You want to be careful and dont try to see through any jokes Slim
till that leg uh yours gets well Irish bantered and they laughed the
louder

All this was mere byplay a momentary swinging of their mood to
pleasantry because they were a temperamentally cheerful lot and
laughter came to them easily as it always does to youth and perfect
mental and physical health Their brief hilarity over Slims misfortune
did not swerve them from their purpose nor soften the mood of them
toward their adversaries They were unsmiling and unfriendly when they
reached the man from Wyoming and if they ever behaved like boys let
out of school they did not show it then

The Wyoming man was wiser than his fellow He had been given several
minutes grace in which to meditate upon the unwisdom of defiance and he
had seen the bugkiller change abruptly from sullenness to terror and
afterward to abject obedience He did not know what they had said to
him or what they had done but he knew the bugkiller was a hard man to
stampede And he was one man and they were many also he judged that
being human and this being the third offense of the Dot sheep under his
care it would be extremely unsafe to trust that their indignation would
vent itself in mere words

Therefore when Weary told him to get the stragglers back through the
fence and up on the level he stopped only long enough for a good look
at their faces After that he called his dogs and crawled through the
fence

It really did not require the entire Family to force those sheep south
that morning But Wearys jaw was set as was his heart upon a
thorough cleaning of that particular bit of range and since he did
not definitely request any man to turn back and every fellow there
was minded to see the thing to a finish they straggled out behind the
trailing two thousandand never had one bunch of sheep so efficient a
convoy

After the first few miles the way grew rough Sheep lagged and the
blatting increased to an uproar Old ewes and yearlings these were
mostly and there were few to suffer more than hunger and thirst
perhaps So Weary was merciless and drove them forward without a stop
until the first jumble of hills and deepworn gullies held them back
from easy traveling

But the Happy Family had not ridden those breaks for cattle all these
years to be hindered by rough going Weary when the band stopped and
huddled blatting incessantly against a sheer wall of sandstone and
gravel got the herders together and told them what he wanted

You take em down that slope till you come to the second little coulee
Dont go up the first onethats a blind pocket In the second coulee
up a mile or so theres a spring creek You can hold em there on water
for half an hour Thats more than any of yuh deserve Haze em down
there

The herders did not know it but that second coulee was the rude gateway
to an intricate system of high ridges and winding waterways that would
later be dry as a bleached bonethe real beginning of the bad lands
which border the Missouri river for long terrible miles Down there
it is possible for two men to reach places where they may converse quite
easily across a chasm and yet be compelled to ride fifteen or twenty
miles perhaps in order to shake hands Yet even in that scrapheap of
Nature there are ways of passing deep into the heart of the upheaval

The Happy Family knew those ways as they knew the most complicated
figures of the quadrilles they danced so lightfootedly with the girls of
the Bear Paw country When they forced the sheep and their herders out
of the coulee Weary had indicated he sent Irish and Pink ahead to point
the way and he told them to head for the Wash Bowl which they did with
praiseworthy zeal and scant pity for the sheep

When at last after a slow heartbreaking climb up a long bare ridge
Pink and Irish paused upon the brow of a slope and let the trailweary
band spill itself reluctantly down the steep slope beyond the sun stood
high in the blue above them and their stomachs clamored for food by
which signs they knew that it must be near noon

When the last sheep had passed blatting discordantly down the bluff
Weary halted the sweating herders for a parting admonition

We dont aim to deal you any more misery for a while if you stay
where youre at Youre only working for a living like the rest of
usbut I must say I dont admire your trade none Anyway Ill send
some of your bunch down here with grub and beds This is good enough
range for sheep You keep away from the Flying U and nobodyll bother
you Over there in them trees he added pointing a gloved finger
toward a little grove on the far side of the basin youll find a
cabin and water And farther down the river theres pretty good grass
in the little bottoms Now git

The herders looked as if they would enjoy murdering them all but they
did not say a word With their dogs at heel they scrambled down
the bluff in the wake of their sheep and the Happy Family rolling
cigarettes while they watched them depart told one another that this
settled that bunch they wouldnt bed down in the Flying U dooryard
that night anyway



CHAPTER XI Weary Unburdens

Hungry with the sharp gnawing hunger of healthy stomachs accustomed
to regular and generous feeding tired with the weariness of healthy
muscles pushed past their accustomed limit of action and hot with the
unaccustomed heat of a blazing day shunted unaccountably into the midst
of soft spring weather the Happy Family rode out of the embrace of
the last barren coulee and up on the wide level where the breeze swept
gratefully up from the west and where every day brought with it a
deeper tinge of green into its grassy carpet

Only for this harassment of the Dot sheep the roundup wagons would
be loaded and ready to rattle abroad over the land Meadow larks and
curlews and little perteyed ground sparrows called out to them that
roundup time was come They passed a bunch of feeding Flying U cattle
and flatribbed bandylegged calves galloped in brief panic to their
mothers and from the sanctuary of grassfilled paunches watched the
riders with wide inquisitive eyes

We ought to be starting out by now Weary observed a bit gloomily to
Andy and Pink who rode upon either side of him The calf crop is going
to be good if this weather holds on another two weeks or so But he
waved his cigarette disgustedly that darned Dot outfit would be all
over the place if we pulled out on roundup and left em the run of
things He smoked moodily for a minute My religion has changed a lot
in the last few days he observed whimsically My idea of hell is
a place where there aint anything but sheep and sheepherders and
cowpunchers have got to spend thousands uh years right in the middle of
the corrals

If thats the case Im going to quit cussing and say my prayers every
night Andy Green asserted emphatically

What worries me Weary confided obeying the impulse to talk over his
troubles with those who sympathized is how Im going to keep the work
going along like it ought to and at the same time keep them Dot sheep
outa the house Dunks wise all right He knows enough about the cow
business to know we ye got to get out on the range pretty quick now
And hes so mean that every day or every half day he can feed his sheep
on Flying U grass he calls that much to the good And he knows we wont
go to opening up any real gunfights if we can get out of it he counts
on our faunching around and kicking up a lot of dust maybebut we
wont do anything like what hed do in our places He knows the Old Man
and Chip are gone and he knows weve just naturally got to sit back and
swallow our tongues because we havent any authority Mamma It comes
pretty tough when a lowdown skunk like that just banks on your doing
the square thing He wouldnt do it but he knows we will and so he
takes advantage of white men and gets the best of em And if we should
happen to break out and do something he knows the herders would be the
ones to get it in the neck and hed wait till the dust settled and bob
up with the sheriff He waved his hand again with a hopeless gesture
It may not look that way on the face of it he added gloomily but
Dunk has got us right where he wants us From the way theyve been
letting sheep on our land time and time again Id gamble hes just
trying to make us so mad well break out Hes got it in for the whole
outfit from the Old Man and the Little Doctor down to Slim If any of
us boys got into trouble the Old Man would spend his last cent to clear
us and Dunk knows that just as well as he knows the way from the house
to the stable Hed see to it that it would just about take the Old
Mans last cent too And hes using these Dot sheep like youd use a
red flag on a bull to make us so crazy mad well kill off somebody

Thats why he said to them all when he saw that they had ridden up
close that they might hear what he was saying Ive been hollering so
loud for the meekandmild stunt When I slapped him on the jaw and he
stood there and took it I saw his game He had a witness to swear I hit
him and he didnt hit back And when I saw them Dots in our field again
I knew just as well as if Dunk had told me that he was kinda hoping
wed kill a herder or two so he could cinch us good and plenty I dont
say he qualified with a rueful grin that Dunk went into the sheep
business just to get rrevenge as they say in shows But if he can
make money running sheepand he can all right because theres more
money in them right now than there is in cattleand at the same time
get a good whack at the Flying U hes the lad that will sure make a
running jump at the chance He spat upon the burnt end of his cigarette
stub from force of the habit that fear of range fires had built and
cast it petulantly from him as if he would like to have been able to
throw Dunk and his sheep problem as easily out of his path

So I wish you boys would hang onto yourselves when you hear a sheep
blatting under your window he summed up his unburdening whimsically
As Bud said this morning you cant hang a man for telling a
sheepherder youll take off his shoes And they cant send us over the
road for moving that band of sheep onto new range today Last night
you all were kinda disorderly maybe but you didnt hurt anybody or
destroy any property You see what I mean Our only show is to stop with
our toes on the right side of the dead line

If Andy here would jest git his thinkwheels greased and going good
Big Medicine suggested loudly he ought to frame up something that
would put them Dots on the run permanent I dno by cripes why it is
a feller can always think uh lies and joshes by the dozens and put em
over O K when there aint nothing to be made out of it except hard
feelins and then when a deal like this here sheep deal comes up hes
got about as many idees by cripes as that there lineback calf over
there Honest to grandma Andy makes me feel kinda faint Only time he
did have a chanct he let them It occurred to Big Medicine at that
point that perhaps his remarks might be construed by the object of
them as being offensively personal He turned his head and grinned
goodnaturedly in Andys direction and refrained from finishing what he
was going to say I sure do like them windflowers scattered all
over the ground he observed with such deliberate and ostentatious
irrelevance that the Happy Family laughed even to Andy Green who had
at first been inclined toward anger

Everything declared Andy in the tone of a paid instructor has its
proper time and place boys Ive told you that before For instance I
wouldnt try to kill a skunk by talking it to death and I wouldnt
be hopeful of putting the run on this Dunk person by telling him ghost
stories As to ideasIm plumb full of them But theyre all about
grub just right at present

That started Slim and Happy Jack to complaining because no one had had
sense enough to go back after some lunch before taking that long trail
south the longer because it was a slow one with sheep to set the pace
And by the time they had presented their arguments against the Happy
Familys having enough brains to last them overnight and the Happy
Family had indignantly pointed out just where the mental deficiency was
most noticeable they were upon that last broad stretch of bench land
beyond which lay Flying U coulee and Patsy and dinner a belated dinner
to be sure but for that the more welcome

And when they reached the point where they could look away to the
very rim of the coulee they saw sheepsheep to the skyline feeding
scattered and at ease making the prairie look in the distance as
if it were covered with a thin growth of gray sagebrush Four herders
moved slowly upon the outskirts and the dogs were little scurrying
black dots which stopped occasionally to wait thankfully until the
masterminds again urged them to endeavor

The Happy Family drew up and stared in silence

Do I see sheep Pink inquired plaintively at last Tell me
somebody

Its that bunch you fellows tackled last night said Weary miserably
I ought to have had sense enough to leave somebody on the ranch to look
out for this

Theyve got their nerve stated Irish after the deal they got last
night Id have bet good money that you couldnt drag them herders
across Flying U coulee with a log chain

Say by golly do we have to drive this here bunch anywheres before we
git anything to eat Slim wanted to know distressfully

Weary considered briefly No I guess well pass em up for the
present An hour or so wont make much difference in the long run and
our horses are about all in right now

Som I by cripes Big Medicine attested grinning mirthlessly This
here sheep business is plumb wearin on a man Specially he added
with a fretful note when youve got to handle em gentle The things
Id like to do to them Dots is all ruled outa the game seems like
Honest to grandma a little gore would look better to me right now than
a Dutch picnic before the foams all blowed off the refreshments Lemme
kill off jest one herder Weary he pleaded The one that took a shot
at me las night Purty please

If you killed one Weary told him glumly you might as well make a
clean sweep and take in the whole bunch

Well I wont charge nothin extra fer that either Bud assured him
generously Im willin to throw in the other threeand the dawgs
too by cripes He goggled the Happy Family quizzically Nobody cant
say theres anything small about me Why down in the Coconino country
they used to set half a dozen greasers diggin graves by cripes soon
as I started in to argy with a man It was a safe bet theyd need three
or four anyways if old Bud cut loose oncet Sheepherders Why they
jest natcherly couldnt keep enough on hand securely to run their
sheep They used to order sheepherders like they did woolsacks by
cripes You could always tell when I was in the country by the number
uh extra herders them sheep outfits always kep in reserve Honest to
grandma Ive knowed two or three outfits to club together and ship in
a carload at a time when they heard I was headed their way And so when
it comes to killin off four why that aint skurcely enough to make it
worth mwhile to dirty up mgun

Aw I betche yuh never killed a man in your life Happy Jack grumbled
in his characteristic tone of disparagement but such was his respect
for Big Medicines prowess that he took care not to speak loud enough
to be overheard by that modest gentleman who continued with certain
fearsome details of alleged murderous exploits of his own down in
Coconino County Arizona

But as they passed the detested animals thankful that the trail
permitted them to ride by at a distance sufficient to blur the most
unsavory details even Big Medicine gave over his deliberate boastings
and relapsed into silence

He had begun his fantastic vauntings from an instinctive impulse
to leaven with humor a situation which at the moment could not be
bettered Just as they had when came the news of the Old Mans dire
plight sought to push the tragedy of it into the background and cling
to their creed of optimism they had avoided openly facing the sheep
complication squarely with mutual admissions of all it might mean to the
Flying U

Until Weary had unburdened his heart of worry on the ride home that day
they had not said much about it beyond a general vilification of the
sheep industry as a whole of Dunk as the chief of the encroaching Dots
and of the herders personally

But there were times when they could not well avoid thinking rather
deeply upon the subject even if they did refuse to put their
forebodings into speech They were not children neither were they to
any degree lacking in intelligence Swearing about herders and at them
was all very well bluffing threatening pummeling even with willing
fists tearing down tents and binding men with ropes might serve to
relieve the emotions upon occasion But there was the grim economic
problem which faced squarely the Flying U as a cow outfitthe problem
of range and water the Happy Family did not call it by name but they
realized to the full what it meant to the Old Man to have sheep just
over his boundary line always They realized too what it meant to have
the Old Man absent at this timeworse to have him lying in a
hospital likely to die at any moment what it meant to have the whole
responsibility shifted to their shoulders willing though they might be
to bear the burden what it meant to have the general of an army gone
when the enemy was approaching in overwhelming numbers

Pink when they were descending the first slope of the bluff which was
the southern rim of Flying U coulee turned and glared vindictively back
at the wavering gray blanket out there to the west When he faced to
the front his face had the look it wore when he was fighting

So help me Josephine he gritted desperately weve got to clean the
range of them Dots before the Old Man comes back or He snapped his
jaws shut viciously

Weary turned haggard eyes toward him

How he asked simply And Pink had no answer for him



CHAPTER XII Two of a Kind

Patsy staunch old partisan that he was placed before them much food
which he had tried his best to keep hot without burning everything to
a crisp and while they ate with ravenous haste he told with German
epithets and a trembling lower jaw of his troubles that day

Dem sheeps dey coom by der leetle pasture he lamented while he
poured coffee muddy from long boiling Looks like dey know so soon you
ride away und dey cooms cheeky as you pleece und eats der grass und
crawls under der fence and leafs der vool sthicking by der vires I goes
out mit a club py cosh und der sheeps chust looks und valks by some
better place alreatty und I throw rocks and yells till mine neck iss
sore

Und dose herders dey sets dem by der rock and laugh till I felt like
I could kill der whole punch by cosh Und von yells Hey dutchy
pring me some pie alreatty Und he laughs some more pecause der sheeps
dey dont go avay dey chust run around und eat more grass and baaaa
He turned and went heavily back to the greasy range with the depleted
coffee pot lifted the lid of a kettle and looked in upon the contents
with a purely mechanical glance gave a perfunctory prod or two with a
longhandled fork and came back to stand uneasily behind Weary

If you poys are goin to shtand fer dot he began querulously Py
cosh I vont Py myself I vill go and tell dot Dunk Wittaker vot
lowdown skunk I tink he iss Sheeps vool shtickin by der fences
efferwhere on der ranch py cosh Dot vould sure kill der Old Man quick
if he see it Shtinkin off sheeps py our noses all der time till I
cant eat no more mit der shmell of dem Neffer pefore did I see vool on
der Flying U fences py cosh und sheeps baaaain in der coulee

Never had they seen Patsy take so to heart a matter of mere business
importance They did not say much to him there was not much that they
could say They ate their fill and went out disconsolately to discuss
the thing among themselves away from Patsys throaty complainings They
hated it as badly as did he with Wearys urgent plea for no violence
holding them in leash they hated it more if that were possible

The Native Son tilted his head unobtrusively stableward when he caught
Andys eye and as unobtrusively wandered away from the group Andy
stopped long enough to roll and light a cigarette and then strolled
after him with apparent aimlessness secretly curious over the summons
He found Miguel in the stable waiting for him and Miguel led the way
rope in hand across the corral and into the little pasture where fed a
horse he meant to ride He did not say anything until he had turned to
close the gate and to make sure that they were alone and that their
departure had not carried to the Happy Family any betraying air of
significance

You remember when you blew in here a few weeks or so ago the Native
Son asked abruptly a twinkle in his fathomless eyes You put up a good
one on the boys that time you remember Bluffed them into thinking I
was a hero in disguise and that youd seen me pull off a big stunt of
bullfighting and bulldogging down in Mexico It was a fine josh They
believe it yet

Andy glanced at him perplexedly Yesbut when it turned out to be
true he amended the josh was on me I guess I thought I was just
lying when I wasnt Ive wondered a good deal about that By
gracious it makes a man feel funny to frame up a yarn out of his own
thinkmachine and then find out hes been telling the truth all the
while Its like a fellow handing out a twentyfour karat gold bar to a
rube by mistake under the impression it only looks like one Of course
they believe it Only they dont know I just merely hit the truth by
accident

The Native Son smiled his slow amused smile that somehow never failed
to be impressive Thats the funny part of it he drawled You
didnt I just piled another little josh on top of yours thats all I
never throwed a bull in my life except with my lariat Id heard a
good deal about you andwell I thought Id see if I could go you one
better And you put that Mexico yarn across so smooth and easy I just
simply couldnt resist the temptation to make you think it was all
straight goods Sabe

Andy Green did not say a word but he looked exceedingly foolish

So I think we can both safely consider ourselves tophands when it
comes to lying the Native Son went on shamelessly And if youre
willing to go in with me on it and help put Dunk on the run He
glanced over his shoulder saw that Happy Jack on horseback was coming
out to haze in the saddle bunch and turned to stroll back as lazily as
he had come He continued to speak smoothly and swiftly in a voice
that would not carry ten paces While Andy Green with brown head bent
attentively listened eagerly and added a sentence or two on his own
account now and then and smiledwhich he had not been in the habit of
doing lately

Say you fellers are gittin awful energetic aint yuhwranglin
horses afoot Happy Jack bantered at the top of his voice when he
passed them by Better save up your strength while you kin Wearys
goin to set us herdin sheep aginand I betche theres goin to be
something moren herdin on our hands before we git through

I wouldnt be a bit surprised if there was sang out Andy as
cheerfully as if he had been invited to dance Ladies choice with the
prettiest girl in the crowd Wonder what hole hes going to dump this
bunch into he added to the Native Son By gracious he ought to send
em just as far north as he can drive em without paying duty Id sure
take em over into Canada if it was me running the show

It was a mistake the Native Son volunteered for the whole bunch to
go off like we did today They had those sheep up here on the hill just
for a bait They knew wed go straight up in the air and come down on
those two freaks herding em and that gave them the chance to cross the
other bunch I thought so all along but I didnt like to butt in

Well Wearys mad enough now to do things that will leave a dent
anyway Andy commented under his breath when from the corral gate he
got a good look at Wearys profile which showed the set of his mouth
and chin See that mouth Its hunt the top rail and do it quick when
old Weary straightens out his lips like that

Behind them Happy Jack bellowed for an open gate and no obstructions
and they drew hastily to one side to let the saddle horses gallop
past with a great upflinging of dust Pink with a quite obtrusive
facetiousness began lustily chanting that it looked to him like a big
night tonightwith occasional furtive glances at Wearys face for
he also had been quick to read those closepressed lips which did not
soften in response to the ditty Usually he laughed at Pinks drollery

They rode rather quietly upon the hill again to where fed the sheep
During the hour or so that they had been absent the sheep had not moved
appreciably they still grazed close enough to the boundary to make
their position seem a direct insult to the Flying U a virtual slap in
the face And these young men who worked for the Flying U and who made
its interests right loyally their own were growing very very tired
of turning the other cheek With them the time for profanity and for
horseplay bluffing and judicious temporizing was past There were other
lips besides Wearys that were drawn tight and thin when they approached
that particular band of sheep More than one pair of eyes turned
inquiringly toward him and away again when they met no answering look

They topped a rise of ground and in the shallow wrinkle which had
hidden him until now they came full upon Dunk Whittaker riding a chunky
black which stepped restlessly about while he conferred in low tones
with a couple of the herders The Happy Family recognized them as two
of the fellows in whose safe keeping they had left their ropes the night
before Dunk looked around quickly when the group appeared over the
little ridge scowled hesitated and then came straight up to them

I want you rowdies to bring back those sheep you took the trouble to
drive off this morning he began with the even grating voice and the
sneering lift of lip under his little black mustache which the older
members of the Happy Family rememberedand hatedso vividly
Ive stood just all Im going to stand of these typically Flying U
performances youve been indulging in so freely during the past week
Its all very well to terrorize a neighborhood of longhaired rubes who
dont know enough to teach you your places but interfering with another
mans property is

Interfering with anotherwhat Big Medicine his pale blue eyes
standing out more like a frogs than ever upon his face gave his horse
a kick and lunged close that he might lean and thrust his red face near
to Dunks Another what I dont see nothin in your saddle that looks
tme like a man by cripes All I can see is a smoothskinned slippery
vermin Id hate to name a snake after that crawls around in the dark
and lets cheap roughnecks do all his dirty work Ive saw dogs sneak
up and grab a man behind but most always they let out a growl or two
first And even a rattler is square enough to buzz at yuh and give yuh
a chanct to sidestep him Honest to grandma I dont hardly know what
kinda reptyle yare I hate to insult any of em by cripes by namin
yuh after em But dont for Lordys sake ever call yourself a man
agin

Big Medicine turned his head and spat disgustedly into the grass and
looked back slightingly with other annihilating remarks close behind his
wideapart teeth but instead of speaking he made an unbelievably quick
motion with his hand The blow smacked loudly upon Dunks cheek and so
nearly sent him out of the saddle that he grabbed for the horn to save
himself

Oh I seert yuh keepin yer hand next yer sixgun all the while Big
Medicine bawled Thats one reason I say yuh aint no man Yuh wouldnt
dast talk up to a prairie dog if yuh wasnt all set to make a quick
draw Yuh got your face slapped oncet before by a Flyin U man and yuh
had it comm Now youregittinitdoneright

If you have ever seen an irate proletarian mother cuffing her offspring
over an empty woodbox you may picture perhaps the present proceeding
of Big Medicine To many a man the thing would have been unfeasible
after the first blow because of the horses But Big Medicine was very
nearly all that he claimed to be and one of his pet vanities was his
horsemanship he managed to keep within a fine slapping distance of
Dunk He stopped when his hand began to sting through his glove

Now you keep your hand away from that gunthat you aint honest enough
to carry where folks can see it but ye got it cached in your pocket
he thundered And go on with what you was goin tsay Only dont get
swellheaded enough to think youre a man agin You aint

Ive got this to say Mere type cannot reproduce the malevolence of
Dunks spluttering speech Ive sent for the county sheriff and a dozen
deputies to arrest you and you and you damn you He was pointing
a shaking finger at the older members of the Happy Family whom he
recognized not gladly but too well Ill have you all in Deer Lodge
before that lying thieving cattlestealing Old Man of yours can lift a
finger Ill sheep Flying U coulee to the very doors of the white house
Ill skin the range between here and the riverand Ill have every one
of you hounds put where the dogs wont bite you He drew a hand across
his mouth and smiled as they say Satan himself can smile upon occasion

Youve done enough to send you all over the road destroying property
and assaulting harmless menyou wait There are other and better
ways to fight than with the fists and I havent forgotten any of you
fellowsthere are a few more rounders among you

Hey You apologize fer that by cripes er Ill kill yuh the longest
way I know And that Big Medicine again laid violent hands upon Dunk
and that way wont feel good now Im tellin yuh Apologize er

Say all this dont do any good Bud Weary expostulated Let Dunk
froth at the mouth if he wants to what we want is to get these sheep
off the range And he added recklessly so long as the sheriff is
headed for us anyway we may as well get busy and make it worth his
while So He stopped silenced by a most amazing interruption

On the brow of the hill when first they had sighted Dunk in the hollow
something had gone wrong with Miguels saddle so that he had stopped
behind and to keep him company Andy had stopped also and waited for
him Later when Dunk was spluttering threats they had galloped up to
the edge of the group and pulled their horses to a stand Now Miguel
rode abruptly close to Dunk as rides one with a purpose

He leaned and peered intently into Dunks distorted countenance until
every man there struck by his manner was watching him curiously Then
he sat back in the saddle straightened his legs in the stirrups and
laughed And like his smile when he would have it so or the little
twitch of shoulders by which he could so incense a man that laugh
brought a deeper flush to Dunks face reddened though it was by Big
Medicines vigorous slapping

Say youve got nerve drawled the Native Son to let a sheriff
travel toward you I can remember when you were more timid amigo He
turned his head until his eyes fell upon Andy Say Andy he called
Come and take a look at this hombre Youll have to think back a few
years he assisted laconically

In response Andy rode up eagerly Like the Native Son he leaned and
peered into eyes that stared back defiantly wavered and turned away
Andy also sat back in the saddle then and snorted

So this is the Dunk Whittaker thats been raising merry hell around
here And talks about sending for the sheriff huh Ive always heard
that a lot uh gall is the best disguise a man can hide under but by
gracious this beats the deuce He turned to the astounded Happy Family
with growing excitement in his manner

Boys we dont have to worry much about this gazabo Well just
freeze onto him till the sheriff heaves in sight Gee Therell sure be
something stirring when we tell him who this Dunk person really is
And you say he was in with the Old Man once Oh Lord He looked
with withering contempt at Dunk and Dunks glance flickered again and
dropped just as his hand dropped to the pocket of his coat

No yuh dont by cripes Big Medicines hand gripped Dunks arm on
the instant With his other he plucked the gun from Dunks pocket and
released him as he would let go of something foul which he had been
compelled to touch

Hell be good or hell lose his dinner quick drawled the Native
Son drawing his own silvermounted sixshooter and resting it upon the
saddle horn so that it pointed straight at Dunks diaphragm You take
Weary off somewhere and tell him something about this deal Andy Ill
watch this slippery gentleman He smiled slowly and got an answering
grin from Andy Green who immediately rode a few rods away with Weary
and Pink close behind

Say by golly whats Dunk wanted fer Slim blurted inquisitively
after a short silence

Not for riding or driving over a bridge faster than a walk Slim
purred the Native Son shifting his gun a trifle as Dunk moved uneasily
in the saddle You know the man Look at his faceand use your
imagination if youve got any



CHAPTER XIII The Happy Family Learn Something

Well I hope this farce is about over Dunk sneered with as near an
approach to his old supercilious manner as he could command when the
three who had ridden apart returned presently Perhaps Weary youll
be good enough to have this fellow put up his gun and these he
hesitated after a swift glance to apply any epithet whatever to the
Happy Family I have two witnesses here to swear that you have without
any excuse assaulted and maligned and threatened me and you may
consider yourselves lucky if I do not insist

Ah cut that out Andy advised wearily I dont know how it strikes
the rest but it sounds pretty sickening to me Dont overlook the fact
that two of us happen to know all about you and we know just where to
send word to dig up a lot more identification So bluffing aint going
to help you out a darned bit

Miguel you can go with Andy Weary said with brisk decision Take
Dunk down to the ranch till the sheriff gets hereif its straight
goods about Dunk sending for him If he didnt we can take Dunk in
tomorrow ourselves He turned and fixed a cold commanding eye upon
the slackjawed herders Come along you two and get these sheep
headed outa here

Say well just lock him up in the blacksmith shop and come on back
Andy amended the order after his own free fashion He couldnt get out
in a million years not after Im through staking him out to the anvil
with a logchain He smiled maliciously into Dunks fearyellowed
countenance and waved him a signal to ride ahead which Dunk did
without a word of protest while the Happy Family looked on dazedly

Whats it all about Weary Irish asked when the three were gone
What is it theyve got on Dunk Must be something pretty fierce the
way he wilted down into the saddle

Youll have to wait and ask the boys Weary rode off to hurry the
herders on the far side of the band

So the Happy Family remained perforce unenlightened upon the subject and
for that they said hard things about Weary and about Andy and Miguel as
well They believed that they were entitled to know the truth and they
called it a smartaleck trick to keep the thing so almighty secret

There is in resentment a crisis when that crisis is reached and the
dam of repression gives way the full flood does not always sweep down
upon those who have provoked the disaster Frequently it happens that
perfectly innocent victims are made to suffer The Happy Family had
been extremely forbearing as has been pointed out before They had
frequently come to the boiling point of rage and had cooled without
committing any real act of violence But that day had held a long series
of petty annoyances and here was a really important thing kept from
them as if they were mere outsiders When Weary was gone Irish asked
Pink what crime Dunk had committed in the past And Pink shook his head
and said he didnt know Irish mentally accused Pink of lying and
his temper was none the better for the rebuff as anyone can readily
understand

When the herders therefore rounded up the sheep and started them
moving south the Happy Family speedily rebelled against that shuffling
nibbling desultory pace that had kept them long weary hours in the
saddle with the other band But it was Irish who first took measures to
accelerate that pace

He got down his rope and whacked the loop viciously down across the
nearest gray back The sheep jumped scuttled away a few paces and
returned to its nibbling progress Irish called it names and whacked
another

After a few minutes he grew tired of swinging his loop and seeing it
have so fleeting an effect and pulled his gun He fired close to the
heels of a yearling buck that had more than once stopped to look up at
him foolishly and blat and the buck charged ahead in a panic at the
noise and the spat of the bullet behind him

Hit him agin in the same place yelled Big Medicine and drew his own
gun The Happy Family at that high tension where they were ready for
anything caught the infection and began shooting and yelling like crazy
men

The effect was not at all what they expected Instead of adding impetus
to the band as would have been the case if they had been driving
cattle the result was exactly the opposite The sheep ranbut they
ran to a common center As the shooting went on they bunched tighter and
tighter until it seemed as though those in the center must surely be
crushed flat From an ambling feeding company of animals they become
a lumpy gray blanket with here and there a long vacuous face showing
idiotically upon the surface

The herders grinned and drew together as against a common enemyor
as with a new joke to be discussed among themselves The dogs wandered
helplessly about yelped halfheartedly at the woolly mass then sat
down upon their haunches and lolled red tongues far out over their
pointed little teeth and tilted knowing heads at the Happy Family

Look at the darned things wailed Pink riding twice around the
huddle almost ready to shed tears of pure rage and helplessness
Git outa that Hi Wooppee He fired again and again and gave the
rangeold cattleyell the yell which had sent many a tired herd over
many a weary mile the yell before which had fled fat steers into the
stockyards at shipping time and up the chutes into the cars the yell
that had hoarsened many a cowpunchers voice and left him with a mere
croak to curse his fate with a yell to bring resultsbut it did not
start those sheep

The Happy Family riding furiously round and round fired every
cartridge they had upon their persons they said every improper thing
they could remember or invent they yelled until their eyes were
starting from their sockets they glued that band of sheep so tight
together that dynamite could scarcely have pried them apart

And the herders sitting apart with grimy hands clasped loosely over
hunchedup knees looked on and talked together in low tones and
grinned

Irish glanced that way and caught them grinning caught them pointing
derisively with heaving shoulders He swore a great oath and made for
them calling aloud that he would knock those grins so far in that they
would presently find themselves smiling wrongsideout from the back of
their heads

Pink overhearing him gave a last swat at the waggling tail of a
burrowing buck and wheeled to overtake Irish and have a hand in
reversing the grins Big Medicine saw them start and came bellowing up
from the far side of the huddle like a bull challenging to combat from
across a meadow Big Medicine did not know what it was all about but he
scented battle and that was sufficient Cal Emmett and Weary equally
ignorant of the cause started at a lope toward the trouble center

It began to look as if the whole Family was about to fall upon those
herders and rend them asunder with teeth and nails so much so that
the herders jumped up and ran like scared cottontails toward the rim of
Denson coulee a hundred yards or so to the west

Mamma I wish we could make the sheep hit that gait and keep it
exclaimed Weary with the first laugh they had heard from him that day

While he was still laughing there was a shot from the ridge toward
which they were running the sharp vicious crack of a rifle The Happy
Family heard the whistling hum of the bullet singing low over their
heads quite low indeed altogether too low to be funny And they had
squandered all their ammunition on the prairie sod to hurry a band of
sheep that flatly refused to hurry anywhere except under one anothers
odorous perspiring bodies

From the edge of the coulee the rifle spoke again A tiny geyser of
dust spurting up from the ground ten feet to one side of Cal Emmett
showed them all where the bullet struck

Get outa range everybody yelled Weary and set the example by
tilting his rowels against Glorys smooth hide and heading eastward
I like to be accommodating all right but I draw the line on standing
around for a target while my neighbors practise shooting

The Happy Family having no other recourse therefore retreated in haste
toward the eastern skyline Bullets followed them overtook them as
the shooter raised his sights for the increasing distance and whined
harmlessly over their heads All save one



CHAPTER XIV Happy Jack

Big Medicine Irish and Pink racing almost abreast heard a scream
behind them and pulled up their horses with short stifflegged plunges
A brown horse overtook them a brown horse with Happy Jack clinging to
the saddlehorn his body swaying far over to one side Even as he went
hurtling past them his hold grew slack and he slumped head foremost to
the ground The brown horse gave a startled leap away from him and went
on with empty stirrups flapping

They sprang down and lifted him to a less awkward position and Big
Medicine pillowed the sweatdampened carroty head in the hollow of his
arm Those who had been in the lead looked back startled when the brown
horse tore past them with that empty saddle saw what had happened
wheeled and galloped back They dismounted and stood silently grouped
about poor ungainly Happy Jack lying there limp and motionless in Big
Medicines arms Not one of them remembered then that there was a man
with a rifle not more than two hundred yards away or if they did they
quite forgot that the rifle might be dangerous to themselves They were
thinking of Happy Jack

Happy Jack butt of all their jokes and jibes Happy the croaker
the lugubrious forecaster of trouble Happy Jack the ugliest the
stupidest the softesthearted man of them all He had betched there
would be someone killed over these Dot sheep he had predicted trouble
of every conceivable kind and they had laughed at him swore at him
lied to him joshed him unmercifully and kept him in a state of
chronic indignation never dreaming that the memory of it would choke
them and strike them dumb with that horrible dull weight in their
chests with which men suffer when a woman would find the relief of
weeping

Wheres he hurt asked Weary in the repressed tone which only tragedy
can bring into a mans voice and knelt beside Big Medicine

I dunnothrough the lungs I guess my sleeves gitting soppy right
under his shoulder Big Medicine did not bellow his voice was as quiet
as Wearys

Weary looked up briefly at the circle of staring faces Pink you pile
onto Glory and go wire for a doctor Try Havre first you may get one
up on the nine o clock train If you cant get one down on the
leventwenty from Great Falls Or theres Bentonanyway git one If
you could catch MacPherson do it Try him first and never mind a Havre
doctor unless you cant get MacPherson Id rather wait a couple of
hours longer for him Ill have a rigno you better get a team from
Jim Theyll be fresh and you can put em through If you kill em he
added grimly we can pay for em He had his jackknife out and
was already slashing carefully the shirt of Happy Jack that he might
inspect the wound

Pink gave a last wistful look at Happy Jacks face which seemed
unfamiliar with all the color and all the expression wiped out of it
like that and turned away Come and help me change saddles Cal
he said shortly Wearys stirrups are too darned long Even with the
delay he was mounted on Glory and galloping toward Flying U coulee
before Weary was through uncovering the wound and that does not mean
that Weary was slow

The rifle cracked again and a bullet plucked into the sod twenty feet
beyond the circle of men and horses But no one looked up or gave any
other sign of realization that they were still the target they were
staring with that frowning painfully intent look men have at such
moments at a purplish hole not much bigger than if punched by a lead
pencil just under the point of Happy Jacks shoulder blade and at the
blood oozing sluggishly from it in a tiny stream across the girlishly
white flesh and dripping upon Big Medicines arm

Hadnt we better get a rig to take him home with Irish suggested

Weary exploring farther had just disclosed a ragged wound under the
arm where the bullet had passed out he made no immediate reply

Well he aint got it stuck inside of im anyway Big Medicine
commented relievedly Dont look to me like its so awful badwent
through kinda anglin and maybe missed his lungs Ive saw men shot up
before

AwI betche youdthink it was badif you had it murmured Happy
Jack peevishly lifting his eyelids heavily for a resentful glance when
they moved him a little But even as Big Medicine grinned joyfully down
at him he went off again into mental darkness and the grin faded into
solicitude

Youd kick by golly if you was goin to be hung Slim bantered
tritely and belatedly and gulped remorsefully when he saw that he was
joshing an unconscious man

We better get him home Irish you Weary looked up and discovered
that Irish and jack Bates were already headed for home and a conveyance
He gave a sigh of approval and turned his attention toward wiping the
sweat and grime from Happys face with his handkerchief

Somebody else is goin to git hit by golly if we stay here Slim
blurted suddenly when another bullet dug up the dirt in that vicinity

That goldarned foolll keep on till he kills somebody I wisht I
had m thirtythirty hereId make him wisht his mother was a man by
golly

Big Medicine looked toward the coulee rim I aint got a shell left
he growled regretfully I wisht wed thought to tell the boys to bring
them rifles Say Slim you crawl onto your hoss and go git em It
wont take moren a minute Therell likely be some shells in the
magazines

Go on Slim urged Weary grimly Weve got to do something They
cant do a thing like this he glanced down at Happy Jack and get
away with it

I got half a box uh shells for my thirtythirty Ill bring that Slim
turned to go stopped short and stared at the coulee rim By golly
theyre comm over here he exclaimed

Big Medicine glanced up took off his hat crumpled it for a pillow
and eased Happy Jack down upon it He got up stiffly wiped his fingers
mechanically upon his trouser legs broke his gun open just to make sure
that it was indeed empty put it back and picked up a handful of rocks

Let em come he said viciously I cn kill every damn one with m
bare hands



CHAPTER XV Oleson

Say aint that Andy and Mig following along behind Cal asked after a
minute of watching the approach Sure it is Now what

Theyre drivin em by cripes Big Medicine under the stress of the
moment returned to his usual bellowing tone Whos that tall lanky
feller in the lead I dont call to mind ever seem him before Them four
herders Id know a mile off

That Weary shaded his eyes with his hatbrim against the slant rays
of the westering sun Thats Oleson Dunks partner

His motherd be aweepin Big Medicine observed bodefully if she
knowed what was due to happen to her son right away quick Must be him
that done the shootin

They came on steadily the four herders and Oleson walking reluctantly
ahead with Andy Green and the Native Son riding relentlessly in the
rear their guns held unwaveringly in a line with the backs of their
captives Andy was carrying a rifle evidently taken from one of the
menOleson they judged for the guilty one Half the distance was
covered when Andy was seen to turn his head and speak briefly with the
Native Son after which he lunged past the captives and galloped up to
the waiting group His quick eye sought first the face of Happy Jack
in anxious questioning then miserably he searched the faces of his
friends

Good Lord he exclaimed mechanically dismounted and bent over the
figure on the ground For a long minute he knelt there he laid his ear
close to Happy Jacks mouth took off his glove and laid his hand over
Happys heart reached up twitched off his neckerchief shook out the
creases and spread it reverently over Happy Jacks face He stood up
then and spoke slowly his eyes fixed upon the stumbling approach of the
captives

Pink told us Happy had been shot so we rode around and come up behind
em It was a cinch Andsay boys weve got the Dots in a pocket
Theyve got to eat outa our hands now So dont think aboutour own
feelings or about he stopped abruptly and let a downward glance
finish the sentence Weve got to keep our own hands clean andnow
dont let your fingers get the itch Bud This because of certain
manifestations of a murderous intent on the part of Big Medicine

Oh its all right to talk if yuh feel like talking Big Medicine
retorted savagely I dont He made a catlike spring at the foremost
man who happened to be Oleson and got a merciless grip with his
fingers on his throat snarling like a predatory animal over its kill
From behind Andy with Weary to help pulled him off

I didnt mean toto kill anybody gasped Oleson pasty white I
heard a lot of shooting and so I ran up the hilland the herders came
running toward me and I thought I was defending my property and men I
had a right to defend

Defend hell Big Medicine writhed in the restraining grasp of those
who held him Look at that there As good hearted a boy as ever turned
a cow Never harmed a soul in is life Is all your dirty stinkin
sheep an all your lousy herders worth that boys life Yuh shot im
down like a doglemme go boys His voice was husky Lemme tromp the
life outa him

I thought you were killing my men or I neverI never meant toto
kill Oleson shaking till he could scarcely stand broke down and
wept wept pitiably hysterically as men of a certain fiber will weep
when black tragedy confronts them all unawares He cowered miserably
before the Happy Family his face hidden behind his two hands

Boys I want to say a word or two Come over here Andys voice quiet
as ever contrasted strangely with the mans sobbing He led them back
a few pacesWeary Cal Big Medicine and Slim and spoke hurriedly The
Native Son eyed them sidelong from his horse but he was careful to keep
Oleson covered with his gunand the herders too although they were
unarmed Once or twice he glanced at that long ungainly figure in the
grass with the handkerchief of Andy Green hiding the face except where
a corner fluttering in the faint breeze which came creeping out of the
west lifted now and then and gave a glimpse of sunbrowned throat and a
quiet chin and mouth

Quit that blubbering Oleson and listen here Andys voice broke
relentlessly upon the others woe All these boys want to hang yuh
without any red tape far as Im concerned Im dead willing But were
going to give yuh a chance Your partner as we told yuh coming over
weve got the dead immortal cinch on right now Andwell you can see
what youre up against But well give yuh a chance Have you got any
family

Oleson trying to pull himself together shook his head

Well then you can get rid of them sheep cant yuh Sell em ship
em outa herewe dont give a darn what yuh do only so yuh get em off
the range

Yyes Ill do that Olesons consent was reluctant but it was fairly
prompt Ill get rid of the sheep he said as if he was minded to
clinch the promise Ill do it at once

Thats nice Andy spoke with grim irony And youll get rid of the
ranch too Youll sell it to the Flying Ucheap

But my partnerWhittaker might object

Look here oldtimer Youll fix that part up youll find a way
of fixing it Look hereat what youre up against He waited with
pointing finger for one terrible minute Will you sell to the Flying
U

Yyes The word was really a gulp He tried to avoid looking where
Andy pointed failed and shuddered at what he saw

I thought you would Well get that in writing And were going to wait
just exactly twentyfour hours before we make a move Itll take some
fine work but well do it Our boss here will fix up the business end
with you Hell go with yuh right now and stay with yuh till you
make good And the first crooked move you make Andy in unconscious
imitation of the Native Son shrugged a shoulder expressively and urged
Weary by a glance to take the leadership

Irish you come with me The rest of you fellows know about what to
do Andy I guess youll have to ride point till I get back Weary
hesitated looked from Happy Jack to Oleson and the herders and back
to the sober faces of his fellows Do what you can for him boysand I
wish one of you would ride over after Pink gets back andlet me know
how things stack up will you

Incredible as was the situation on the face of it nevertheless it was
extremely matteroffact in the handling which is the way sometimes
with incredible situations as if since we know instinctively that we
cannot rise unprepared to the bigness of its possibilities we keep our
feet planted steadfastly on the ground and refuse to rise at all And
afterward perhaps we look back and wonder how it all came about

At the last moment Weary turned back and exchanged guns with Andy Green
because his own was empty and he realized the possible need of oneor
at least the need of having the sheepmen perfectly aware that he had
one ready for use The Native Son without a word of comment handed his
own silvertrimmed weapon over to Irish and rolled a cigarette deftly
with one hand while he watched them ride away

Does this strike anybody else as being pretty raw he inquired calmly
dismounting among them Id do a good deal for the outfit myself
but letting that man get offSay you fellows up this way dont think
killing a man amounts to much do you He looked from one to the other
with a queer contemptuous hostility in his eyes

Andy Green took a forward step and laid a hand familiarly on his rigid
shoulder Quit it Mig We would do a lot for the outfit thats the
Gods truth And I played the game right up to the hilt I admit But
nobodys killed I told Happy to play dead By gracious I caught him
just in the nick uh time hed been setting up in another minute To
prove it he bent and twitched the handkerchief from the face of Happy
Jack and Happy opened his eyes and made shift to growl

Yuh purty nearsmothered me tdeath darn yuh

Dios breathed the Native Son for once since they knew him jolted out
of his eternal calm God but Im glad

I guess the rest of us aint insinuated Andy softly and lifted his
hat to wipe the sweat off his forehead I will say that After
all he did not Instead he knelt beside Happy Jack and painstakingly
adjusted the crumpled hat a hairs breadth differently

How do yuh feel oldtimer he asked with a very thin disguise of
cheerfulness upon the anxiety of his tone

Well I could feel a lotbetter without hurtin nothin Happy Jack
responded somberly I hope you fellersfeel better now Yuh got
emtryin to murderthe hull outfit jes like Itold yuh
they would Gunshot wounds contrary to the tales of certain
sentimentalists do not appreciably sweeten or even change a mans
disposition Happy Jack with a bullet hole through one side of him was
still Happy Jack

Aw quit your beefin Big Medicine advised gruffly A feller with
a hole in his lung yuh could throw a calf through sideways aint got no
business statin his views on nothin by cripes

Aw gwan I thought you saidit didnt amount t nothin Happy
reminded him anxiety stealing into his face

Well it dont May lay yuh up a day or two wouldnt be suprised if
yuh had to stay on the bedground two or three meals But look at Slim
here Shot through the legshattered a bone by cripeslas night
only and here hes makin a hand and ridin and cussin same as any of
us tday We aint goin to let yuh grouch around thats all We claim
we got a vacation comm to us youre shot up now and thats fun
enough for one man without throwin it into the whole bunch Why a
little nick like that aint nothin nothin atall Why Ive been
shot right through here by cripesBig Medicine laid an impressive
fingertip on the top button of his trousersand it come out back
herehe whirled and showed his thumb against the small of his
backand I never laid off but that day and part uh the next I was
sore he admitted goggling Happy Jack earnestly but I kep agoin
I was right in fall roundup an I had to A man cant lay down an cry
by cripes jes because he gets pinked a little

Aw thats jest becauseit aint you I betche youd lay em
downjest like other folks if yuh got shotthrough the lungs That
aint nojoke lemme tell yuh Happy Jack was beginning to show
considerable spirit for a wounded man So much spirit that Andy Green
who had seen men stricken down with various ills read fever signs in
the countenance and in the voice of Happy and led Big Medicine somewhat
peremptorily out of earshot

Aint you got any sense he inquired with fine candor What do you
want to throw it into him like that for You may not think so but hes
pretty bad offif you ask me

Big Medicines pale eyes turned commiseratingly toward Happy Jack I
know he is I aint no fool I was jest tryin to cheer im up a little
He was beginnin to look like he was gittin scared about it I reckon
maybe I made a break sayin what I did about it so I jest wanted to
take the cuss off Honest to granma

If you know anything at all about such things you must know what fever
means in such a case And recollect its going to be quite a while
before a doctor can get here

Oh Ill be careful Maybe I did throw it purty strong I wont no
more Big Medicine s meekness was not the least amazing incident of
the day He was a bighearted soul under his bellow and bluff and his
sympathy for Happy Jack struck deep He went back walking on his toes
and he stood so that his sturdy body shaded Happy Jacks face from the
sun and he did not open his mouth for another word until Irish and Jack
Bates came rattling up with the spring wagon hurriedly transformed with
mattress pillows and blankets into an ambulance

They had been thoughtful to a degree They brought with them a jug of
water and a tin cup and they gave Happy Jack a long cooling drink of
it and bathed his face before they lifted him into the wagon And of all
the hands that ministered to his needs the hands of Big Medicine were
the eagerest and gentlest and his voice was the most vibrant with
sympathy which was saying a good deal



CHAPTER XVI The End of the Dots

Slim may not have been more curious than his fellows but he was perhaps
more singlehearted in his loyalty to the outfit To him the shooting
of Happy Jack once he felt assured that the wound was not necessarily
fatal became of secondary importance It was all in behalf of the
Flying U and if the bullet which laid Happy Jack upon the ground was
also the means of driving the hated Dots from that neighborhood he
felt in his slow phlegmatic way that it wasnt such a catastrophe as
some of the others seemed to think Of course he wouldnt want Happy
to die but he didnt believe after all that Happy was going to do
anything like that Old Patsy knew a lot about sickness and wounds Who
can cook for a cattle outfit for twenty years and more and not know a
good deal of hurts Old Patsy had looked Happy over carefully and had
given a grin and a snort

Py cosh dot vos lucky for you alreatty he had pronounced So you
dont git ploodpoisonings mit fever you be all right pretty soon
You go to shleep yet If fix you oop till der dochtor he cooms I seen
fellers shot plumb through der middle off dem und git yell You aint
shot so bad You go to shleep

So his immediate fears relieved Slims slow mind had swung back to
the Dots and to Oleson whom Weary was even now assisting to keep his
promise Slim grinned widely to himself when he thought of the abject
fear which Oleson had displayed because of the murder he thought he had
done while Happy Jack obediently played dead And of Dunk whom Slim
had hated most abominably of old Dunk a criminal found out Dunk a
prisoner right there on the very ranch he had thought to despoil Dunk
at that very moment locked in the blacksmith shop Perhaps it was not
curiosity alone which sent him down there perhaps it was partly a
desire to look upon Dunk humbledhe who had trodden so arrogantly
upon the necks of those below him so arrogantly that even Slim the
slowwitted one had many a time trembled with anger at his tone

Slim walked slowly as was his wont with deadly directness as was his
nature The blacksmith shop was silent closedas grimly noncommittal
as a vault You might guess whatever you pleased about its inmate it
was like trying to imagine the emotions pictured upon the face behind
a smooth black mask Slim stopped before the closed door and listened
The rusty iron hasp attracted his slow gaze at first puzzling him a
little making him vaguely aware that something about it did not quite
harmonize with his mental attitude toward it It took him a full minute
to realize that he had expected to find the door locked and that the
hasp hung downward uselessly just as it hung every day in the year

He remembered then that Andy had spoken of chaining Dunk to the anvil
That would make it unnecessary to lock the door of course Slim seized
the hanging strip of iron gave it a jerk and bathed all the dingy
interior with a soft sunset glow Cobwebs quivered at the inrush of the
breeze and glistened like threads of fine gold The forge remained a
dark blot in the corner A new chisel lying upon the earthen floor
became a bar of yellow light

Slims eyes went to the anvil and clung there in a widening stare His
hands white and soft when his gloves were off drew up convulsively
into fighting fists and as he stood looking the cords swelled and
stood out upon his thick neck For years he had hated Dunk Whittaker

The Happy Family with rare good sense had not hesitated to turn the
white house into an impromptu hospital They knew that if the Little
Doctor and Chip and the Old Man had been at home Happy Jack would have
been taken unquestioningly into the guest chamberwhich was a square
threewindowed room off the big livingroom More than one of them had
occupied it upon occasion They took Happy Jack up there and put him to
bed quite as a matterofcourse and when he was asleep they lingered
upon the wide front porch the hammock of the Little Doctor squeaked
under the weight of Andy Green and the widearmed chairs received the
weary forms of divers young cowpunchers who did not give a thought to
the intrusion but were thankful for the comfort Andy was swinging
luxuriously and drawing the last few puffs from a cigarette when Slim
purple and puffing audibly appeared portentously before him

I thought you said you was goin to lock Dunk up in the blacksmith
shop he launched accusingly at Andy

We did averred that young man pushing his toe against the railing to
accelerate the voluptuous motion of the hammock

He aint there Hes broke loose The chainby golly yuh went an
used that chain that was broke an jest barely hangin together His
horse aint anywheres around either You fellers make me sick Lollin
around here an not paying no attention by gollyhes liable to be ten
mile from here by this time When Slim stopped his jaw quivered like
a dish of disturbed jelly and I wish I could give you his tone choppy
every sentence an accusation that should have made those fellows wince

Irish Big Medicine and Jack Bates had sprung guiltily to their feet
and started down the steps The drawling voice of the Native Son stopped
them ten feet from the porch

Twelve or fifteen I should make it That horse of his looked to me
like a drifter

Wellare yuh goin t set there on your haunches an let him GO
Slim by the look of him was ripe for murder

You want to look out or youll get apoplexy sure Andy soothed
giving himself another luxurious push and pulling the last little whiff
from his cigarette before he threw away the stub Fat men cant afford
to get as excited as skinny ones can

Aw say Where did you put him Andy asked Big Medicine his first
flurry subsiding before the absolute calm of those two on the porch

In the blacksmith shop said Andy with a slurring accent on the first
word that made the whole sentence perfectly maddening Ah come on back
here and sit down I guess we better tell em the how of it Huh Mig

Miguel cast a slow humorous glance over the four Yeestheyll have
us treed in about two minutes if we dont he assented Go ahead

Well Andy lifted his head and shoulders that he might readjust a
pillow to his liking we wanted him to make a getaway Fact is if he
hadnt wed have beenstrictly up against it Right If he hadnthow
about it Mig I guess wed have been to the Little Rockies ourselves

Youve got a sweet little voice Irish cut in savagely but were
tired Wed rather hear yuh say something

Ohall right Well Mig and I just ribbed up a josh on Dunk Id read
somewhere about the same kinda deal so it aint original I dont lay
any claim to the idea at all we just borrowed it You see its like
this We figured that a man as mean as this Dunk person most likely had
stepped over the line somewhere So we just took a gambling chance and
let him do the rest You see we never saw him before in our lives All
that identification stunt of ours was just a bluff But the minute I
shoved my chips to the center I knew we had him dead to rights You
were there You saw him wilt By gracious

Yuh dont know anything against him gasped Irish

Not a darned thingany more than what you all know testified Andy
complacently

It took a minute or two for that to sink in

Well Ill be damned breathed Irish

We did chain him to the anvil Andy went on On the way down we
talked about being in a hurry to get back to you fellows and I told
Migso Dunk could hearthat we wouldnt bother with the horse We tied
him to the corral And I hunted around for that bum chain and then we
made out we couldnt find the padlock for the door so we decided right
out loud that hed be dead safe for an hour or two till the bunch of
us got back Not knowing a darn thing about him except what you boys
have told us we sure would have been in bad if he hadnt taken a sneak
Fact is we were kinda worried for fear he wouldnt have nerve enough
to try it We waited up on the hill till we saw him sneak down to the
corral and jump on his horse and take off down the coulee like a scared
coyote It was quoth the young man unmistakably pleased with himself
pretty smooth work if you ask me

Id hate to ride as fast and far tonight as that hombre will
supplemented Miguel with his brief smile that was just a flash of
white even teeth and a momentary lightening of his languorous eyes

Slim stood for five minutes a stolid stocky figure in the midst of
a storm of congratulatory comment They forgot all about Happy Jack
asleep inside the house and so their voices were not hushed Indeed
Big Medicines bulllike remarks boomed fullthroated across the coulee
and were flung back mockingly by the barren hills Slim did not hear
a word they were saying he was thinking it over with that complete
mental concentration which is the chief recompense of a slowworking
mind He was methodically thinking it all outand eventually he saw
the joke

Well by golly he bawled suddenly and brought his palm down with
a terrific smack upon his sore legwhereat his fellows laughed
uproariously

We told you not to try to see through any more jokes till your leg gets
well Slim Andy reminded condescendingly

Say by golly thats a good one on Dunk aint it Chasin himself
clean outa the country by gollyscared plumb to deathand you
fellers was only jest makin blieve yuh knowed him By golly that sure
is a good one all right

Youve got it give you time enough and you could see through a
barbedwire fence patronized Andy from the hammock Yes since you
mention it I think myself it aint so bad

Aww shut up out there an let a feller sleep came a querulous
voice from within Id ruther bed down with a corral full uh calves at
weanin time than be anywheres within ten mile uh you darned mouthy
The rest was indistinguishable but it did not matter The Happy Family
save Slim who stayed to look after the patient tiptoed penitently
off the porch and took themselves and their enthusiasm down to the
bunkhouse



CHAPTER XVII Good News

Pink rolled over in his bed so that he might lookhowever
sleepilyupon his fellows dressing more or less quietly in the cool
dawnhour

Say I got a letter for you Weary he yawned stretching both arms
above his head I opened it and read it it was from Chip so

What did he have to say

Old Man any better

How they comm back here

Several voices speaking at once necessitated a delayed reply

Theyll be here today or tomorrow Pink replied without any
circumlocution whatever while he fumbled in his coat pocket for the
letter He says the Old Man wants to come and the doctors think he
might as well tackle it as stay there fussing over it Theyre coming in
a special car and weve got to rig up an outfit to meet him The Little
Doctor tells just how she wants things fixed I thought maybe it was
importantit come special delivery Pink added naively so I just
played it was mine and read it

Thats all right Cadwalloper Weary assured him while he read hastily
the letter Well well fix up the spring wagon and take it in right
away somebodys got to go back anyway with MacPherson Hello Cal
hows Happy

All right answered Cal who had watched over him during the night and
came in at that moment after someone to take his place in the sickroom
Waked up on the fight because I just happened to be setting with my
eyes shut I wasnt asleep but he said I was claimed I snored so loud
I kept him awake all night Gee whiz Id ruther nurse a she bear with
the mumps

Old Mans coming home Cal Pink announced with more joy in his
tone and in his face than had appeared in either for many a weary
day Whereupon Cal gave an exultant whoop Go tell that to Happy
he shouted Maybe hell forget a grouch or two Say luck seems to be
kinda casting loving glances our way againwhat

By golly seems to me Pink oughta told us when he come in las night
grumbled Slim when he could make himself heard

You were all dead to the world Pink defended and I wanted to
be Two oclock in the morning is a mighty poor time for elegant
conversation if you want my opinion

And the main point is you knew all about it and you didnt give a
darn whether we did or not Irish said bluntly And Weary sneaked in
too and never let a yip outa him about things over in Denson coulee

Oh what was the use asked Weary blandly I got an option out of
Oleson for the ranch and outfit and all his sheep at a mighty good
figurefor the Flying U The Old Man can do what he likes about it
but ten to one hell buy him out That is Olesons share which was
twothirds I kinda counted on Dunk letting go easy And he added
reaching for his hat once I got the papers for it there wasnt
anything to hang around for was there Especially he said with his
old sunny smile when we werent urged a whole lot to stay

Remained therefore little save the actual arrival of the Old Mana
pitifully weak Old Man bandaged and odorous with antiseptics and quite
pathetically glad to be back homeand his recovery which was rather
slow and the recovery of Happy Jack which was rapid

For a brief space the Flying U outfit owned the Dots very brief it
was not a day longer than it took Chip to find a buyerat a figure
considerably above that named in the option by the way

So after a season of worry and trouble and impending tragedy such as
no man may face unflinchingly life dropped back to its usual level and
the trail of the Flying U outfit once more led through pleasant places
