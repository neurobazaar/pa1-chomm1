LEAVES OF GRASS

By Walt Whitman



 Come said my soul
 Such verses for my Body let us write for we are one
 That should I after return
 Or long long hence in other spheres
 There to some group of mates the chants resuming
 Tallying Earths soil trees winds tumultuous waves
 Ever with pleasd smile I may keep on
 Ever and ever yet the verses owningas first I here and now
 Signing for Soul and Body set to them my name

 Walt Whitman





BOOK I INSCRIPTIONS




OnesSelf I Sing

 Onesself I sing a simple separate person
 Yet utter the word Democratic the word EnMasse

 Of physiology from top to toe I sing
 Not physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse I say
 the Form complete is worthier far
 The Female equally with the Male I sing

 Of Life immense in passion pulse and power
 Cheerful for freest action formd under the laws divine
 The Modern Man I sing




As I Ponderd in Silence

 As I ponderd in silence
 Returning upon my poems considering lingering long
 A Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect
 Terrible in beauty age and power
 The genius of poets of old lands
 As to me directing like flame its eyes
 With finger pointing to many immortal songs
 And menacing voice What singest thou it said
 Knowst thou not there is but one theme for everenduring bards
 And that is the theme of War the fortune of battles
 The making of perfect soldiers

 Be it so then I answerd
 I too haughty Shade also sing war and a longer and greater one than any
 Waged in my book with varying fortune with flight advance
 and retreat victory deferrd and wavering
 Yet methinks certain or as good as certain at the last the
 field the world
 For life and death for the Body and for the eternal Soul
 Lo I too am come chanting the chant of battles
 I above all promote brave soldiers




In Cabind Ships at Sea

 In cabind ships at sea
 The boundless blue on every side expanding
 With whistling winds and music of the waves the large imperious waves
 Or some lone bark buoyd on the dense marine
 Where joyous full of faith spreading white sails
 She cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day or under
 many a star at night
 By sailors young and old haply will I a reminiscence of the land be read
 In full rapport at last

 Here are our thoughts voyagers thoughts
 Here not the land firm land alone appears may then by them be said
 The sky oerarches here we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet
 We feel the long pulsation ebb and flow of endless motion
 The tones of unseen mystery the vague and vast suggestions of the
 briny world the liquidflowing syllables
 The perfume the faint creaking of the cordage the melancholy rhythm
 The boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here
 And this is oceans poem

 Then falter not O book fulfil your destiny
 You not a reminiscence of the land alone
 You too as a lone bark cleaving the ether purposd I know not
 whither yet ever full of faith
 Consort to every ship that sails sail you
 Bear forth to them folded my love dear mariners for you I fold it
 here in every leaf
 Speed on my book spread your white sails my little bark athwart the
 imperious waves
 Chant on sail on bear oer the boundless blue from me to every sea
 This song for mariners and all their ships




To Foreign Lands

 I heard that you askd for something to prove this puzzle the New World
 And to define America her athletic Democracy
 Therefore I send you my poems that you behold in them what you wanted




To a Historian

 You who celebrate bygones
 Who have explored the outward the surfaces of the races the life
 that has exhibited itself
 Who have treated of man as the creature of politics aggregates
 rulers and priests
 I habitan of the Alleghanies treating of him as he is in himself
 in his own rights
 Pressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself
 the great pride of man in himself
 Chanter of Personality outlining what is yet to be
 I project the history of the future




To Thee Old Cause

 To thee old cause
 Thou peerless passionate good cause
 Thou stern remorseless sweet idea
 Deathless throughout the ages races lands
 After a strange sad war great war for thee
 I think all war through time was really fought and ever will be
 really fought for thee
 These chants for thee the eternal march of thee

 A war O soldiers not for itself alone
 Far far more stood silently waiting behind now to advance in this book

 Thou orb of many orbs
 Thou seething principle thou wellkept latent germ thou centre
 Around the idea of thee the war revolving
 With all its angry and vehement play of causes
 With vast results to come for thrice a thousand years
 These recitatives for theemy book and the war are one
 Merged in its spirit I and mine as the contest hinged on thee
 As a wheel on its axis turns this book unwitting to itself
 Around the idea of thee




Eidolons

 I met a seer
 Passing the hues and objects of the world
 The fields of art and learning pleasure sense
 To glean eidolons

 Put in thy chants said he
 No more the puzzling hour nor day nor segments parts put in
 Put first before the rest as light for all and entrancesong of all
 That of eidolons

 Ever the dim beginning
 Ever the growth the rounding of the circle
 Ever the summit and the merge at last to surely start again
 Eidolons eidolons

 Ever the mutable
 Ever materials changing crumbling recohering
 Ever the ateliers the factories divine
 Issuing eidolons

 Lo I or you
 Or woman man or state known or unknown
 We seeming solid wealth strength beauty build
 But really build eidolons

 The ostent evanescent
 The substance of an artists mood or savans studies long
 Or warriors martyrs heros toils
 To fashion his eidolon

 Of every human life
 The units gatherd posted not a thought emotion deed left out
 The whole or large or small summd added up
 In its eidolon

 The old old urge
 Based on the ancient pinnacles lo newer higher pinnacles
 From science and the modern still impelld
 The old old urge eidolons

 The present now and here
 Americas busy teeming intricate whirl
 Of aggregate and segregate for only thence releasing
 Todays eidolons

 These with the past
 Of vanishd lands of all the reigns of kings across the sea
 Old conquerors old campaigns old sailors voyages
 Joining eidolons

 Densities growth facades
 Strata of mountains soils rocks giant trees
 Farborn fardying living long to leave
 Eidolons everlasting

 Exalte rapt ecstatic
 The visible but their womb of birth
 Of orbic tendencies to shape and shape and shape
 The mighty eartheidolon

 All space all time
 The stars the terrible perturbations of the suns
 Swelling collapsing ending serving their longer shorter use
 Filld with eidolons only

 The noiseless myriads
 The infinite oceans where the rivers empty
 The separate countless free identities like eyesight
 The true realities eidolons

 Not this the world
 Nor these the universes they the universes
 Purport and end ever the permanent life of life
 Eidolons eidolons

 Beyond thy lectures learnd professor
 Beyond thy telescope or spectroscope observer keen beyond all mathematics
 Beyond the doctors surgery anatomy beyond the chemist with his chemistry
 The entities of entities eidolons

 Unfixd yet fixd
 Ever shall be ever have been and are
 Sweeping the present to the infinite future
 Eidolons eidolons eidolons

 The prophet and the bard
 Shall yet maintain themselves in higher stages yet
 Shall mediate to the Modern to Democracy interpret yet to them
 God and eidolons

 And thee my soul
 Joys ceaseless exercises exaltations
 Thy yearning amply fed at last prepared to meet
 Thy mates eidolons

 Thy body permanent
 The body lurking there within thy body
 The only purport of the form thou art the real I myself
 An image an eidolon

 Thy very songs not in thy songs
 No special strains to sing none for itself
 But from the whole resulting rising at last and floating
 A round fullorbd eidolon




For Him I Sing

 For him I sing
 I raise the present on the past
 As some perennial tree out of its roots the present on the past
 With time and space I him dilate and fuse the immortal laws
 To make himself by them the law unto himself




When I Read the Book

 When I read the book the biography famous
 And is this then said I what the author calls a mans life
 And so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life
 As if any man really knew aught of my life
 Why even I myself I often think know little or nothing of my real life
 Only a few hints a few diffused faint clews and indirections
 I seek for my own use to trace out here




Beginning My Studies

 Beginning my studies the first step pleasd me so much
 The mere fact consciousness these forms the power of motion
 The least insect or animal the senses eyesight love
 The first step I say awed me and pleasd me so much
 I have hardly gone and hardly wishd to go any farther
 But stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs




Beginners

 How they are provided for upon the earth appearing at intervals
 How dear and dreadful they are to the earth
 How they inure to themselves as much as to anywhat a paradox
 appears their age
 How people respond to them yet know them not
 How there is something relentless in their fate all times
 How all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward
 And how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same
 great purchase




To the States

 To the States or any one of them or any city of the States Resist
 much obey little
 Once unquestioning obedience once fully enslaved
 Once fully enslaved no nation state city of this earth ever
 afterward resumes its liberty




On Journeys Through the States

 On journeys through the States we start
 Ay through the world urged by these songs
 Sailing henceforth to every land to every sea
 We willing learners of all teachers of all and lovers of all

 We have watchd the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on
 And have said Why should not a man or woman do as much as the
 seasons and effuse as much

 We dwell a while in every city and town
 We pass through Kanada the Northeast the vast valley of the
 Mississippi and the Southern States
 We confer on equal terms with each of the States
 We make trial of ourselves and invite men and women to hear
 We say to ourselves Remember fear not be candid promulge the
 body and the soul
 Dwell a while and pass on be copious temperate chaste magnetic
 And what you effuse may then return as the seasons return
 And may be just as much as the seasons




To a Certain Cantatrice

 Here take this gift
 I was reserving it for some hero speaker or general
 One who should serve the good old cause the great idea the
 progress and freedom of the race
 Some brave confronter of despots some daring rebel
 But I see that what I was reserving belongs to you just as much as to any




Me Imperturbe

 Me imperturbe standing at ease in Nature
 Master of all or mistress of all aplomb in the midst of irrational things
 Imbued as they passive receptive silent as they
 Finding my occupation poverty notoriety foibles crimes less
 important than I thought
 Me toward the Mexican sea or in the Mannahatta or the Tennessee
 or far north or inland
 A river man or a man of the woods or of any farmlife of these
 States or of the coast or the lakes or Kanada
 Me wherever my life is lived O to be selfbalanced for contingencies
 To confront night storms hunger ridicule accidents rebuffs as
 the trees and animals do




Savantism

 Thither as I look I see each result and glory retracing itself and
 nestling close always obligated
 Thither hours months yearsthither trades compacts
 establishments even the most minute
 Thither everyday life speech utensils politics persons estates
 Thither we also I with my leaves and songs trustful admirant
 As a father to his father going takes his children along with him




The Ship Starting

 Lo the unbounded sea
 On its breast a ship starting spreading all sails carrying even
 her moonsails
 The pennant is flying aloft as she speeds she speeds so stately
 below emulous waves press forward
 They surround the ship with shining curving motions and foam




I Hear America Singing

 I hear America singing the varied carols I hear
 Those of mechanics each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong
 The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam
 The mason singing his as he makes ready for work or leaves off work
 The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat the deckhand
 singing on the steamboat deck
 The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench the hatter singing as
 he stands
 The woodcutters song the ploughboys on his way in the morning
 or at noon intermission or at sundown
 The delicious singing of the mother or of the young wife at work
 or of the girl sewing or washing
 Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else
 The day what belongs to the dayat night the party of young
 fellows robust friendly
 Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs




What Place Is Besieged

 What place is besieged and vainly tries to raise the siege
 Lo I send to that place a commander swift brave immortal
 And with him horse and foot and parks of artillery
 And artillerymen the deadliest that ever fired gun




Still Though the One I Sing

 Still though the one I sing
 One yet of contradictions made I dedicate to Nationality
 I leave in him revolt O latent right of insurrection O
 quenchless indispensable fire




Shut Not Your Doors

 Shut not your doors to me proud libraries
 For that which was lacking on all your wellfilld shelves yet
 needed most I bring
 Forth from the war emerging a book I have made
 The words of my book nothing the drift of it every thing
 A book separate not linkd with the rest nor felt by the intellect
 But you ye untold latencies will thrill to every page




Poets to Come

 Poets to come orators singers musicians to come
 Not today is to justify me and answer what I am for
 But you a new brood native athletic continental greater than
 before known
 Arouse for you must justify me

 I myself but write one or two indicative words for the future
 I but advance a moment only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness

 I am a man who sauntering along without fully stopping turns a
 casual look upon you and then averts his face
 Leaving it to you to prove and define it
 Expecting the main things from you




To You

 Stranger if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me why
 should you not speak to me
 And why should I not speak to you




Thou Reader

 Thou reader throbbest life and pride and love the same as I
 Therefore for thee the following chants




BOOK II


Starting from Paumanok

 1
 Starting from fishshape Paumanok where I was born
 Wellbegotten and raisd by a perfect mother
 After roaming many lands lover of populous pavements
 Dweller in Mannahatta my city or on southern savannas
 Or a soldier campd or carrying my knapsack and gun or a miner
 in California
 Or rude in my home in Dakotas woods my diet meat my drink from
 the spring
 Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess
 Far from the clank of crowds intervals passing rapt and happy
 Aware of the fresh free giver the flowing Missouri aware of
 mighty Niagara
 Aware of the buffalo herds grazing the plains the hirsute and
 strongbreasted bull
 Of earth rocks Fifthmonth flowers experienced stars rain snow
 my amaze
 Having studied the mockingbirds tones and the flight of the
 mountainhawk
 And heard at dawn the unrivalld one the hermit thrush from the
 swampcedars
 Solitary singing in the West I strike up for a New World

 2
 Victory union faith identity time
 The indissoluble compacts riches mystery
 Eternal progress the kosmos and the modern reports
 This then is life
 Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions

 How curious how real
 Underfoot the divine soil overhead the sun

 See revolving the globe
 The ancestorcontinents away groupd together
 The present and future continents north and south with the isthmus
 between

 See vast trackless spaces
 As in a dream they change they swiftly fill
 Countless masses debouch upon them
 They are now coverd with the foremost people arts institutions known

 See projected through time
 For me an audience interminable

 With firm and regular step they wend they never stop
 Successions of men Americanos a hundred millions
 One generation playing its part and passing on
 Another generation playing its part and passing on in its turn
 With faces turnd sideways or backward towards me to listen
 With eyes retrospective towards me

 3
 Americanos conquerors marches humanitarian
 Foremost century marches Libertad masses
 For you a programme of chants

 Chants of the prairies
 Chants of the longrunning Mississippi and down to the Mexican sea
 Chants of Ohio Indiana Illinois Iowa Wisconsin and Minnesota
 Chants going forth from the centre from Kansas and thence equidistant
 Shooting in pulses of fire ceaseless to vivify all

 4
 Take my leaves America take them South and take them North
 Make welcome for them everywhere for they are your own offspring
 Surround them East and West for they would surround you
 And you precedents connect lovingly with them for they connect
 lovingly with you

 I connd old times
 I sat studying at the feet of the great masters
 Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and study me

 In the name of these States shall I scorn the antique
 Why these are the children of the antique to justify it

 5
 Dead poets philosophs priests
 Martyrs artists inventors governments long since
 Languageshapers on other shores
 Nations once powerful now reduced withdrawn or desolate
 I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left
 wafted hither
 I have perused it own it is admirable moving awhile among it
 Think nothing can ever be greater nothing can ever deserve more
 than it deserves
 Regarding it all intently a long while then dismissing it
 I stand in my place with my own day here

 Here lands female and male
 Here the heirship and heiressship of the world here the flame of
 materials
 Here spirituality the translatress the openlyavowd
 The evertending the finale of visible forms
 The satisfier after due longwaiting now advancing
 Yes here comes my mistress the soul

 6
 The soul
 Forever and foreverlonger than soil is brown and solidlonger
 than water ebbs and flows
 I will make the poems of materials for I think they are to be the
 most spiritual poems
 And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality
 For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and
 of immortality

 I will make a song for these States that no one State may under any
 circumstances be subjected to another State
 And I will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by
 night between all the States and between any two of them
 And I will make a song for the ears of the President full of
 weapons with menacing points
 And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces
 And a song make I of the One formd out of all
 The fangd and glittering One whose head is over all
 Resolute warlike One including and over all
 However high the head of any else that head is over all

 I will acknowledge contemporary lands
 I will trail the whole geography of the globe and salute courteously
 every city large and small
 And employments I will put in my poems that with you is heroism
 upon land and sea
 And I will report all heroism from an American point of view

 I will sing the song of companionship
 I will show what alone must finally compact these
 I believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love
 indicating it in me
 I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were
 threatening to consume me
 I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires
 I will give them complete abandonment
 I will write the evangelpoem of comrades and of love
 For who but I should understand love with all its sorrow and joy
 And who but I should be the poet of comrades

 7
 I am the credulous man of qualities ages races
 I advance from the people in their own spirit
 Here is what sings unrestricted faith

 Omnes omnes let others ignore what they may
 I make the poem of evil also I commemorate that part also
 I am myself just as much evil as good and my nation isand I say
 there is in fact no evil
 Or if there is I say it is just as important to you to the land or
 to me as any thing else

 I too following many and followd by many inaugurate a religion I
 descend into the arena
 It may be I am destind to utter the loudest cries there the
 winners pealing shouts
 Who knows they may rise from me yet and soar above every thing

 Each is not for its own sake
 I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for religions sake

 I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough
 None has ever yet adored or worshipd half enough
 None has begun to think how divine he himself is and how certain
 the future is

 I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be
 their religion
 Otherwise there is just no real and permanent grandeur
 Nor character nor life worthy the name without religion
 Nor land nor man or woman without religion

 8
 What are you doing young man
 Are you so earnest so given up to literature science art amours
 These ostensible realities politics points
 Your ambition or business whatever it may be

 It is wellagainst such I say not a word I am their poet also
 But behold such swiftly subside burnt up for religions sake
 For not all matter is fuel to heat impalpable flame the essential
 life of the earth
 Any more than such are to religion

 9
 What do you seek so pensive and silent
 What do you need camerado
 Dear son do you think it is love

 Listen dear sonlisten America daughter or son
 It is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess and yet it
 satisfies it is great
 But there is something else very great it makes the whole coincide
 It magnificent beyond materials with continuous hands sweeps and
 provides for all

 10
 Know you solely to drop in the earth the germs of a greater religion
 The following chants each for its kind I sing

 My comrade
 For you to share with me two greatnesses and a third one rising
 inclusive and more resplendent
 The greatness of Love and Democracy and the greatness of Religion

 Melange mine own the unseen and the seen
 Mysterious ocean where the streams empty
 Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me
 Living beings identities now doubtless near us in the air that we
 know not of
 Contact daily and hourly that will not release me
 These selecting these in hints demanded of me

 Not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing me
 Has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him
 Any more than I am held to the heavens and all the spiritual world
 After what they have done to me suggesting themes

 O such themesequalities O divine average
 Warblings under the sun usherd as now or at noon or setting
 Strains musical flowing through ages now reaching hither
 I take to your reckless and composite chords add to them and
 cheerfully pass them forward

 11
 As I have walkd in Alabama my morning walk
 I have seen where the shebird the mockingbird sat on her nest in
 the briers hatching her brood

 I have seen the hebird also
 I have pausd to hear him near at hand inflating his throat and
 joyfully singing

 And while I pausd it came to me that what he really sang for was
 not there only
 Nor for his mate nor himself only nor all sent back by the echoes
 But subtle clandestine away beyond
 A charge transmitted and gift occult for those being born

 12
 Democracy near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and
 joyfully singing

 Ma femme for the brood beyond us and of us
 For those who belong here and those to come
 I exultant to be ready for them will now shake out carols stronger
 and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth

 I will make the songs of passion to give them their way
 And your songs outlawd offenders for I scan you with kindred eyes
 and carry you with me the same as any

 I will make the true poem of riches
 To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and goes forward
 and is not dropt by death
 I will effuse egotism and show it underlying all and I will be the
 bard of personality
 And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of
 the other
 And sexual organs and acts do you concentrate in me for I am determind
 to tell you with courageous clear voice to prove you illustrious
 And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present and
 can be none in the future
 And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it may be turnd to
 beautiful results
 And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death
 And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are
 compact
 And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles each
 as profound as any

 I will not make poems with reference to parts
 But I will make poems songs thoughts with reference to ensemble
 And I will not sing with reference to a day but with reference to
 all days
 And I will not make a poem nor the least part of a poem but has
 reference to the soul
 Because having lookd at the objects of the universe I find there
 is no one nor any particle of one but has reference to the soul

 13
 Was somebody asking to see the soul
 See your own shape and countenance persons substances beasts
 the trees the running rivers the rocks and sands

 All hold spiritual joys and afterwards loosen them
 How can the real body ever die and be buried

 Of your real body and any mans or womans real body
 Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpsecleaners and
 pass to fitting spheres
 Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the
 moment of death

 Not the types set up by the printer return their impression the
 meaning the main concern
 Any more than a mans substance and life or a womans substance and
 life return in the body and the soul
 Indifferently before death and after death

 Behold the body includes and is the meaning the main concern and
 includes and is the soul
 Whoever you are how superb and how divine is your body or any part
 of it

 14
 Whoever you are to you endless announcements

 Daughter of the lands did you wait for your poet
 Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand
 Toward the male of the States and toward the female of the States
 Exulting words words to Democracys lands

 Interlinkd foodyielding lands
 Land of coal and iron land of gold land of cotton sugar rice
 Land of wheat beef pork land of wool and hemp land of the apple
 and the grape
 Land of the pastoral plains the grassfields of the world land of
 those sweetaird interminable plateaus
 Land of the herd the garden the healthy house of adobie
 Lands where the northwest Columbia winds and where the southwest
 Colorado winds
 Land of the eastern Chesapeake land of the Delaware
 Land of Ontario Erie Huron Michigan
 Land of the Old Thirteen Massachusetts land land of Vermont and
 Connecticut
 Land of the ocean shores land of sierras and peaks
 Land of boatmen and sailors fishermens land
 Inextricable lands the clutchd together the passionate ones
 The side by side the elder and younger brothers the bonylimbd
 The great womens land the feminine the experienced sisters and
 the inexperienced sisters
 Far breathd land Arctic braced Mexican breezd the diverse the
 compact
 The Pennsylvanian the Virginian the double Carolinian
 O all and each wellloved by me my intrepid nations O I at any
 rate include you all with perfect love
 I cannot be discharged from you not from one any sooner than another
 O death O for all that I am yet of you unseen this hour with
 irrepressible love
 Walking New England a friend a traveler
 Splashing my bare feet in the edge of the summer ripples on
 Paumanoks sands
 Crossing the prairies dwelling again in Chicago dwelling in every town
 Observing shows births improvements structures arts
 Listening to orators and oratresses in public halls
 Of and through the States as during life each man and woman my neighbor
 The Louisianian the Georgian as near to me and I as near to him and her
 The Mississippian and Arkansian yet with me and I yet with any of them
 Yet upon the plains west of the spinal river yet in my house of adobie
 Yet returning eastward yet in the Seaside State or in Maryland
 Yet Kanadian cheerily braving the winter the snow and ice welcome to me
 Yet a true son either of Maine or of the Granite State or the
 Narragansett Bay State or the Empire State
 Yet sailing to other shores to annex the same yet welcoming every
 new brother
 Hereby applying these leaves to the new ones from the hour they
 unite with the old ones
 Coming among the new ones myself to be their companion and equal
 coming personally to you now
 Enjoining you to acts characters spectacles with me

 15
 With me with firm holding yet haste haste on
 For your life adhere to me
 I may have to be persuaded many times before I consent to give
 myself really to you but what of that
 Must not Nature be persuaded many times

 No dainty dolce affettuoso I
 Bearded sunburnt grayneckd forbidding I have arrived
 To be wrestled with as I pass for the solid prizes of the universe
 For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them

 16
 On my way a moment I pause
 Here for you and here for America
 Still the present I raise aloft still the future of the States I
 harbinge glad and sublime
 And for the past I pronounce what the air holds of the red aborigines

 The red aborigines
 Leaving natural breaths sounds of rain and winds calls as of birds
 and animals in the woods syllabled to us for names
 Okonee Koosa Ottawa Monongahela Sauk Natchez Chattahoochee
 Kaqueta Oronoco
 Wabash Miami Saginaw Chippewa Oshkosh WallaWalla
 Leaving such to the States they melt they depart charging the
 water and the land with names

 17
 Expanding and swift henceforth
 Elements breeds adjustments turbulent quick and audacious
 A world primal again vistas of glory incessant and branching
 A new race dominating previous ones and grander far with new contests
 New politics new literatures and religions new inventions and arts

 These my voice announcingI will sleep no more but arise
 You oceans that have been calm within me how I feel you
 fathomless stirring preparing unprecedented waves and storms

 18
 See steamers steaming through my poems
 See in my poems immigrants continually coming and landing
 See in arriere the wigwam the trail the hunters hut the flatboat
 the maizeleaf the claim the rude fence and the backwoods village
 See on the one side the Western Sea and on the other the Eastern Sea
 how they advance and retreat upon my poems as upon their own shores
 See pastures and forests in my poemssee animals wild and tamesee
 beyond the Kaw countless herds of buffalo feeding on short curly grass
 See in my poems cities solid vast inland with paved streets
 with iron and stone edifices ceaseless vehicles and commerce
 See the manycylinderd steam printingpresssee the electric
 telegraph stretching across the continent
 See through Atlanticas depths pulses American Europe reaching
 pulses of Europe duly returnd
 See the strong and quick locomotive as it departs panting blowing
 the steamwhistle
 See ploughmen ploughing farmssee miners digging minessee
 the numberless factories
 See mechanics busy at their benches with toolssee from among them
 superior judges philosophs Presidents emerge drest in
 working dresses
 See lounging through the shops and fields of the States me
 wellbelovd closeheld by day and night
 Hear the loud echoes of my songs thereread the hints come at last

 19
 O camerado close O you and me at last and us two only
 O a word to clear ones path ahead endlessly
 O something ecstatic and undemonstrable O music wild
 O now I triumphand you shall also
 O hand in handO wholesome pleasureO one more desirer and lover
 O to haste firm holdingto haste haste on with me




BOOK III


Song of Myself

 1
 I celebrate myself and sing myself
 And what I assume you shall assume
 For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you

 I loafe and invite my soul
 I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass

 My tongue every atom of my blood formd from this soil this air
 Born here of parents born here from parents the same and their
 parents the same
 I now thirtyseven years old in perfect health begin
 Hoping to cease not till death

 Creeds and schools in abeyance
 Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are but never forgotten
 I harbor for good or bad I permit to speak at every hazard
 Nature without check with original energy

 2
 Houses and rooms are full of perfumes the shelves are crowded with
 perfumes
 I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it
 The distillation would intoxicate me also but I shall not let it

 The atmosphere is not a perfume it has no taste of the
 distillation it is odorless
 It is for my mouth forever I am in love with it
 I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked
 I am mad for it to be in contact with me

 The smoke of my own breath
 Echoes ripples buzzd whispers loveroot silkthread crotch and vine
 My respiration and inspiration the beating of my heart the passing
 of blood and air through my lungs
 The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves and of the shore and
 darkcolord searocks and of hay in the barn

 The sound of the belchd words of my voice loosd to the eddies of
 the wind
 A few light kisses a few embraces a reaching around of arms
 The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag
 The delight alone or in the rush of the streets or along the fields
 and hillsides
 The feeling of health the fullnoon trill the song of me rising
 from bed and meeting the sun

 Have you reckond a thousand acres much have you reckond the earth much
 Have you practisd so long to learn to read
 Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems

 Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of
 all poems
 You shall possess the good of the earth and sun there are millions
 of suns left
 You shall no longer take things at second or third hand nor look through
 the eyes of the dead nor feed on the spectres in books
 You shall not look through my eyes either nor take things from me
 You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self

 3
 I have heard what the talkers were talking the talk of the
 beginning and the end
 But I do not talk of the beginning or the end

 There was never any more inception than there is now
 Nor any more youth or age than there is now
 And will never be any more perfection than there is now
 Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now

 Urge and urge and urge
 Always the procreant urge of the world

 Out of the dimness opposite equals advance always substance and
 increase always sex
 Always a knit of identity always distinction always a breed of life
 To elaborate is no avail learnd and unlearnd feel that it is so

 Sure as the most certain sure plumb in the uprights well
 entretied braced in the beams
 Stout as a horse affectionate haughty electrical
 I and this mystery here we stand

 Clear and sweet is my soul and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul

 Lack one lacks both and the unseen is proved by the seen
 Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn

 Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age
 Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things while they
 discuss I am silent and go bathe and admire myself

 Welcome is every organ and attribute of me and of any man hearty and clean
 Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile and none shall be
 less familiar than the rest

 I am satisfiedI see dance laugh sing
 As the hugging and loving bedfellow sleeps at my side through the night
 and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread
 Leaving me baskets coverd with white towels swelling the house with
 their plenty
 Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes
 That they turn from gazing after and down the road
 And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent
 Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two and which is ahead

 4
 Trippers and askers surround me
 People I meet the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and
 city I live in or the nation
 The latest dates discoveries inventions societies authors old and new
 My dinner dress associates looks compliments dues
 The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love
 The sickness of one of my folks or of myself or illdoing or loss
 or lack of money or depressions or exaltations
 Battles the horrors of fratricidal war the fever of doubtful news
 the fitful events
 These come to me days and nights and go from me again
 But they are not the Me myself

 Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am
 Stands amused complacent compassionating idle unitary
 Looks down is erect or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest
 Looking with sidecurved head curious what will come next
 Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it

 Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with
 linguists and contenders
 I have no mockings or arguments I witness and wait

 5
 I believe in you my soul the other I am must not abase itself to you
 And you must not be abased to the other

 Loafe with me on the grass loose the stop from your throat
 Not words not music or rhyme I want not custom or lecture not
 even the best
 Only the lull I like the hum of your valved voice

 I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning
 How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turnd over upon me
 And parted the shirt from my bosombone and plunged your tongue
 to my barestript heart
 And reachd till you felt my beard and reachd till you held my feet

 Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass
 all the argument of the earth
 And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own
 And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own
 And that all the men ever born are also my brothers and the women
 my sisters and lovers
 And that a kelson of the creation is love
 And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields
 And brown ants in the little wells beneath them
 And mossy scabs of the worm fence heapd stones elder mullein and
 pokeweed

 6
 A child said What is the grass fetching it to me with full hands
 How could I answer the child I do not know what it is any more than he

 I guess it must be the flag of my disposition out of hopeful green
 stuff woven

 Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord
 A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt
 Bearing the owners name someway in the corners that we may see
 and remark and say Whose

 Or I guess the grass is itself a child the produced babe of the vegetation

 Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic
 And it means Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones
 Growing among black folks as among white
 Kanuck Tuckahoe Congressman Cuff I give them the same I
 receive them the same

 And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves

 Tenderly will I use you curling grass
 It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men
 It may be if I had known them I would have loved them
 It may be you are from old people or from offspring taken soon out
 of their mothers laps
 And here you are the mothers laps

 This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers
 Darker than the colorless beards of old men
 Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths

 O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues
 And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing

 I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women
 And the hints about old men and mothers and the offspring taken
 soon out of their laps

 What do you think has become of the young and old men
 And what do you think has become of the women and children

 They are alive and well somewhere
 The smallest sprout shows there is really no death
 And if ever there was it led forward life and does not wait at the
 end to arrest it
 And ceasd the moment life appeard

 All goes onward and outward nothing collapses
 And to die is different from what any one supposed and luckier

 7
 Has any one supposed it lucky to be born
 I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die and I know it

 I pass death with the dying and birth with the newwashd babe and
 am not containd between my hat and boots
 And peruse manifold objects no two alike and every one good
 The earth good and the stars good and their adjuncts all good

 I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth
 I am the mate and companion of people all just as immortal and
 fathomless as myself
 They do not know how immortal but I know

 Every kind for itself and its own for me mine male and female
 For me those that have been boys and that love women
 For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted
 For me the sweetheart and the old maid for me mothers and the
 mothers of mothers
 For me lips that have smiled eyes that have shed tears
 For me children and the begetters of children

 Undrape you are not guilty to me nor stale nor discarded
 I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no
 And am around tenacious acquisitive tireless and cannot be shaken away

 8
 The little one sleeps in its cradle
 I lift the gauze and look a long time and silently brush away flies
 with my hand

 The youngster and the redfaced girl turn aside up the bushy hill
 I peeringly view them from the top

 The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom
 I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair I note where the pistol
 has fallen

 The blab of the pave tires of carts sluff of bootsoles talk of
 the promenaders
 The heavy omnibus the driver with his interrogating thumb the
 clank of the shod horses on the granite floor
 The snowsleighs clinking shouted jokes pelts of snowballs
 The hurrahs for popular favorites the fury of rousd mobs
 The flap of the curtaind litter a sick man inside borne to the hospital
 The meeting of enemies the sudden oath the blows and fall
 The excited crowd the policeman with his star quickly working his
 passage to the centre of the crowd
 The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes
 What groans of overfed or halfstarvd who fall sunstruck or in fits
 What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and
 give birth to babes
 What living and buried speech is always vibrating here what howls
 restraind by decorum
 Arrests of criminals slights adulterous offers made acceptances
 rejections with convex lips
 I mind them or the show or resonance of themI come and I depart

 9
 The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready
 The dried grass of the harvesttime loads the slowdrawn wagon
 The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged
 The armfuls are packd to the sagging mow

 I am there I help I came stretchd atop of the load
 I felt its soft jolts one leg reclined on the other
 I jump from the crossbeams and seize the clover and timothy
 And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps

 10
 Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt
 Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee
 In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night
 Kindling a fire and broiling the freshkilld game
 Falling asleep on the gatherd leaves with my dog and gun by my side

 The Yankee clipper is under her skysails she cuts the sparkle and scud
 My eyes settle the land I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck

 The boatmen and clamdiggers arose early and stopt for me
 I tuckd my trowserends in my boots and went and had a good time
 You should have been with us that day round the chowderkettle

 I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west
 the bride was a red girl
 Her father and his friends sat near crosslegged and dumbly smoking
 they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets
 hanging from their shoulders
 On a bank lounged the trapper he was drest mostly in skins his luxuriant
 beard and curls protected his neck he held his bride by the hand
 She had long eyelashes her head was bare her coarse straight locks
 descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reachd to her feet

 The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside
 I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile
 Through the swung halfdoor of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak
 And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him
 And brought water and filld a tub for his sweated body and bruisd feet
 And gave him a room that enterd from my own and gave him some
 coarse clean clothes
 And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness
 And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles
 He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and passd north
 I had him sit next me at table my firelock leand in the corner

 11
 Twentyeight young men bathe by the shore
 Twentyeight young men and all so friendly
 Twentyeight years of womanly life and all so lonesome

 She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank
 She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window

 Which of the young men does she like the best
 Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her

 Where are you off to lady for I see you
 You splash in the water there yet stay stock still in your room

 Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twentyninth bather
 The rest did not see her but she saw them and loved them

 The beards of the young men glistend with wet it ran from their long hair
 Little streams passd all over their bodies

 An unseen hand also passd over their bodies
 It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs

 The young men float on their backs their white bellies bulge to the
 sun they do not ask who seizes fast to them
 They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch
 They do not think whom they souse with spray

 12
 The butcherboy puts off his killingclothes or sharpens his knife
 at the stall in the market
 I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and breakdown

 Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil
 Each has his mainsledge they are all out there is a great heat in
 the fire

 From the cinderstrewd threshold I follow their movements
 The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms
 Overhand the hammers swing overhand so slow overhand so sure
 They do not hasten each man hits in his place

 13
 The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses the block swags
 underneath on its tiedover chain
 The negro that drives the long dray of the stoneyard steady and
 tall he stands poisd on one leg on the stringpiece
 His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over
 his hipband
 His glance is calm and commanding he tosses the slouch of his hat
 away from his forehead
 The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache falls on the black of
 his polishd and perfect limbs

 I behold the picturesque giant and love him and I do not stop there
 I go with the team also

 In me the caresser of life wherever moving backward as well as
 forward sluing
 To niches aside and junior bending not a person or object missing
 Absorbing all to myself and for this song

 Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade what
 is that you express in your eyes
 It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life

 My tread scares the wooddrake and woodduck on my distant and
 daylong ramble
 They rise together they slowly circle around

 I believe in those wingd purposes
 And acknowledge red yellow white playing within me
 And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional
 And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else
 And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut yet trills pretty well to me
 And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me

 14
 The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night
 Yahonk he says and sounds it down to me like an invitation
 The pert may suppose it meaningless but I listening close
 Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky

 The sharphoofd moose of the north the cat on the housesill the
 chickadee the prairiedog
 The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats
 The brood of the turkeyhen and she with her halfspread wings
 I see in them and myself the same old law

 The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections
 They scorn the best I can do to relate them

 I am enamourd of growing outdoors
 Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods
 Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and
 mauls and the drivers of horses
 I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out

 What is commonest cheapest nearest easiest is Me
 Me going in for my chances spending for vast returns
 Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me
 Not asking the sky to come down to my good will
 Scattering it freely forever

 15
 The pure contralto sings in the organ loft
 The carpenter dresses his plank the tongue of his foreplane
 whistles its wild ascending lisp
 The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner
 The pilot seizes the kingpin he heaves down with a strong arm
 The mate stands braced in the whaleboat lance and harpoon are ready
 The duckshooter walks by silent and cautious stretches
 The deacons are ordaind with crossd hands at the altar
 The spinninggirl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel
 The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a Firstday loafe and
 looks at the oats and rye
 The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirmd case
 He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mothers
 bedroom
 The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case
 He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript
 The malformd limbs are tied to the surgeons table
 What is removed drops horribly in a pail
 The quadroon girl is sold at the auctionstand the drunkard nods by
 the barroom stove
 The machinist rolls up his sleeves the policeman travels his beat
 the gatekeeper marks who pass
 The young fellow drives the expresswagon I love him though I do
 not know him
 The halfbreed straps on his light boots to compete in the race
 The western turkeyshooting draws old and young some lean on their
 rifles some sit on logs
 Out from the crowd steps the marksman takes his position levels his piece
 The groups of newlycome immigrants cover the wharf or levee
 As the woollypates hoe in the sugarfield the overseer views them
 from his saddle
 The bugle calls in the ballroom the gentlemen run for their
 partners the dancers bow to each other
 The youth lies awake in the cedarroofd garret and harks to the
 musical rain
 The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron
 The squaw wrapt in her yellowhemmd cloth is offering moccasins and
 beadbags for sale
 The connoisseur peers along the exhibitiongallery with halfshut
 eyes bent sideways
 As the deckhands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for
 the shoregoing passengers
 The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it
 off in a ball and stops now and then for the knots
 The oneyear wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne
 her first child
 The cleanhaird Yankee girl works with her sewingmachine or in the
 factory or mill
 The pavingman leans on his twohanded rammer the reporters lead
 flies swiftly over the notebook the signpainter is lettering
 with blue and gold
 The canal boy trots on the towpath the bookkeeper counts at his
 desk the shoemaker waxes his thread
 The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him
 The child is baptized the convert is making his first professions
 The regatta is spread on the bay the race is begun how the white
 sails sparkle
 The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray
 The pedler sweats with his pack on his back the purchaser higgling
 about the odd cent
 The bride unrumples her white dress the minutehand of the clock
 moves slowly
 The opiumeater reclines with rigid head and justopend lips
 The prostitute draggles her shawl her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and
 pimpled neck
 The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths the men jeer and wink to
 each other
 Miserable I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you
 The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great
 Secretaries
 On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms
 The crew of the fishsmack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold
 The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle
 As the farecollector goes through the train he gives notice by the
 jingling of loose change
 The floormen are laying the floor the tinners are tinning the
 roof the masons are calling for mortar
 In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers
 Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gatherd it
 is the fourth of Seventhmonth what salutes of cannon and small arms
 Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs the mower mows
 and the wintergrain falls in the ground
 Off on the lakes the pikefisher watches and waits by the hole in
 the frozen surface
 The stumps stand thick round the clearing the squatter strikes deep
 with his axe
 Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cottonwood or pecantrees
 Coonseekers go through the regions of the Red river or through
 those draind by the Tennessee or through those of the Arkansas
 Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or Altamahaw
 Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and greatgrandsons
 around them
 In walls of adobie in canvas tents rest hunters and trappers after
 their days sport
 The city sleeps and the country sleeps
 The living sleep for their time the dead sleep for their time
 The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife
 And these tend inward to me and I tend outward to them
 And such as it is to be of these more or less I am
 And of these one and all I weave the song of myself

 16
 I am of old and young of the foolish as much as the wise
 Regardless of others ever regardful of others
 Maternal as well as paternal a child as well as a man
 Stuffd with the stuff that is coarse and stuffd with the stuff
 that is fine
 One of the Nation of many nations the smallest the same and the
 largest the same
 A Southerner soon as a Northerner a planter nonchalant and
 hospitable down by the Oconee I live
 A Yankee bound my own way ready for trade my joints the limberest
 joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth
 A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deerskin
 leggings a Louisianian or Georgian
 A boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts a Hoosier Badger Buckeye
 At home on Kanadian snowshoes or up in the bush or with fishermen
 off Newfoundland
 At home in the fleet of iceboats sailing with the rest and tacking
 At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine or the
 Texan ranch
 Comrade of Californians comrade of free NorthWesterners loving
 their big proportions
 Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen comrade of all who shake hands
 and welcome to drink and meat
 A learner with the simplest a teacher of the thoughtfullest
 A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons
 Of every hue and caste am I of every rank and religion
 A farmer mechanic artist gentleman sailor quaker
 Prisoner fancyman rowdy lawyer physician priest

 I resist any thing better than my own diversity
 Breathe the air but leave plenty after me
 And am not stuck up and am in my place

 The moth and the fisheggs are in their place
 The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place
 The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place

 17
 These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands they
 are not original with me
 If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing or next to nothing
 If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing
 If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing

 This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is
 This the common air that bathes the globe

 18
 With music strong I come with my cornets and my drums
 I play not marches for accepted victors only I play marches for
 conquerd and slain persons

 Have you heard that it was good to gain the day
 I also say it is good to fall battles are lost in the same spirit
 in which they are won

 I beat and pound for the dead
 I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them

 Vivas to those who have faild
 And to those whose warvessels sank in the sea
 And to those themselves who sank in the sea
 And to all generals that lost engagements and all overcome heroes
 And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known

 19
 This is the meal equally set this the meat for natural hunger
 It is for the wicked just same as the righteous I make appointments
 with all
 I will not have a single person slighted or left away
 The keptwoman sponger thief are hereby invited
 The heavylippd slave is invited the venerealee is invited
 There shall be no difference between them and the rest

 This is the press of a bashful hand this the float and odor of hair
 This the touch of my lips to yours this the murmur of yearning
 This the faroff depth and height reflecting my own face
 This the thoughtful merge of myself and the outlet again

 Do you guess I have some intricate purpose
 Well I have for the Fourthmonth showers have and the mica on the
 side of a rock has

 Do you take it I would astonish
 Does the daylight astonish does the early redstart twittering
 through the woods
 Do I astonish more than they

 This hour I tell things in confidence
 I might not tell everybody but I will tell you

 20
 Who goes there hankering gross mystical nude
 How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat

 What is a man anyhow what am I what are you

 All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own
 Else it were time lost listening to me

 I do not snivel that snivel the world over
 That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth

 Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids conformity
 goes to the fourthremovd
 I wear my hat as I please indoors or out

 Why should I pray why should I venerate and be ceremonious

 Having pried through the strata analyzed to a hair counseld with
 doctors and calculated close
 I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones

 In all people I see myself none more and not one a barleycorn less
 And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them

 I know I am solid and sound
 To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow
 All are written to me and I must get what the writing means

 I know I am deathless
 I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenters compass
 I know I shall not pass like a childs carlacue cut with a burnt
 stick at night

 I know I am august
 I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood
 I see that the elementary laws never apologize
 I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by
 after all

 I exist as I am that is enough
 If no other in the world be aware I sit content
 And if each and all be aware I sit content

 One world is aware and by far the largest to me and that is myself
 And whether I come to my own today or in ten thousand or ten
 million years
 I can cheerfully take it now or with equal cheerfulness I can wait

 My foothold is tenond and mortisd in granite
 I laugh at what you call dissolution
 And I know the amplitude of time

 21
 I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul
 The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me
 The first I graft and increase upon myself the latter I translate
 into new tongue

 I am the poet of the woman the same as the man
 And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man
 And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men

 I chant the chant of dilation or pride
 We have had ducking and deprecating about enough
 I show that size is only development

 Have you outstript the rest are you the President
 It is a trifle they will more than arrive there every one and
 still pass on

 I am he that walks with the tender and growing night
 I call to the earth and sea halfheld by the night

 Press close barebosomd nightpress close magnetic nourishing night
 Night of south windsnight of the large few stars
 Still nodding nightmad naked summer night

 Smile O voluptuous coolbreathd earth
 Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees
 Earth of departed sunsetearth of the mountains mistytopt
 Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue
 Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river
 Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake
 Farswooping elbowd earthrich appleblossomd earth
 Smile for your lover comes

 Prodigal you have given me lovetherefore I to you give love
 O unspeakable passionate love

 Thruster holding me tight and that I hold tight
 We hurt each other as the bridegroom and the bride hurt each other

 22
 You sea I resign myself to you alsoI guess what you mean
 I behold from the beach your crooked fingers
 I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me
 We must have a turn together I undress hurry me out of sight of the land
 Cushion me soft rock me in billowy drowse
 Dash me with amorous wet I can repay you

 Sea of stretchd groundswells
 Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths
 Sea of the brine of life and of unshovelld yet alwaysready graves
 Howler and scooper of storms capricious and dainty sea
 I am integral with you I too am of one phase and of all phases

 Partaker of influx and efflux I extoller of hate and conciliation
 Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others arms

 I am he attesting sympathy
 Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that
 supports them

 I am not the poet of goodness only I do not decline to be the poet
 of wickedness also

 What blurt is this about virtue and about vice
 Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me I stand indifferent
 My gait is no faultfinders or rejecters gait
 I moisten the roots of all that has grown

 Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy
 Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be workd over and rectified

 I find one side a balance and the antipedal side a balance
 Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine
 Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start

 This minute that comes to me over the past decillions
 There is no better than it and now

 What behaved well in the past or behaves well today is not such wonder
 The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel

 23
 Endless unfolding of words of ages
 And mine a word of the modern the word EnMasse

 A word of the faith that never balks
 Here or henceforward it is all the same to me I accept Time absolutely

 It alone is without flaw it alone rounds and completes all
 That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all

 I accept Reality and dare not question it
 Materialism first and last imbuing

 Hurrah for positive science long live exact demonstration
 Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac
 This is the lexicographer this the chemist this made a grammar of
 the old cartouches
 These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas
 This is the geologist this works with the scalper and this is a
 mathematician

 Gentlemen to you the first honors always
 Your facts are useful and yet they are not my dwelling
 I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling

 Less the reminders of properties told my words
 And more the reminders they of life untold and of freedom and extrication
 And make short account of neuters and geldings and favor men and
 women fully equipt
 And beat the gong of revolt and stop with fugitives and them that
 plot and conspire

 24
 Walt Whitman a kosmos of Manhattan the son
 Turbulent fleshy sensual eating drinking and breeding
 No sentimentalist no stander above men and women or apart from them
 No more modest than immodest

 Unscrew the locks from the doors
 Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs

 Whoever degrades another degrades me
 And whatever is done or said returns at last to me

 Through me the afflatus surging and surging through me the current
 and index

 I speak the password primeval I give the sign of democracy
 By God I will accept nothing which all cannot have their
 counterpart of on the same terms

 Through me many long dumb voices
 Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves
 Voices of the diseasd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs
 Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion
 And of the threads that connect the stars and of wombs and of the
 fatherstuff
 And of the rights of them the others are down upon
 Of the deformd trivial flat foolish despised
 Fog in the air beetles rolling balls of dung

 Through me forbidden voices
 Voices of sexes and lusts voices veild and I remove the veil
 Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigurd

 I do not press my fingers across my mouth
 I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart
 Copulation is no more rank to me than death is

 I believe in the flesh and the appetites
 Seeing hearing feeling are miracles and each part and tag of me
 is a miracle

 Divine am I inside and out and I make holy whatever I touch or am
 touchd from
 The scent of these armpits aroma finer than prayer
 This head more than churches bibles and all the creeds

 If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of
 my own body or any part of it
 Translucent mould of me it shall be you
 Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you
 Firm masculine colter it shall be you
 Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you
 You my rich blood your milky stream pale strippings of my life
 Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you
 My brain it shall be your occult convolutions
 Root of washd sweetflag timorous pondsnipe nest of guarded
 duplicate eggs it shall be you
 Mixd tussled hay of head beard brawn it shall be you
 Trickling sap of maple fibre of manly wheat it shall be you
 Sun so generous it shall be you
 Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you
 You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you
 Winds whose softtickling genitals rub against me it shall be you
 Broad muscular fields branches of live oak loving lounger in my
 winding paths it shall be you
 Hands I have taken face I have kissd mortal I have ever touchd
 it shall be you

 I dote on myself there is that lot of me and all so luscious
 Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy
 I cannot tell how my ankles bend nor whence the cause of my faintest wish
 Nor the cause of the friendship I emit nor the cause of the
 friendship I take again

 That I walk up my stoop I pause to consider if it really be
 A morningglory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics
 of books

 To behold the daybreak
 The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows
 The air tastes good to my palate

 Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising
 freshly exuding
 Scooting obliquely high and low

 Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs
 Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven

 The earth by the sky staid with the daily close of their junction
 The heavd challenge from the east that moment over my head
 The mocking taunt See then whether you shall be master

 25
 Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sunrise would kill me
 If I could not now and always send sunrise out of me

 We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun
 We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak

 My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach
 With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds

 Speech is the twin of my vision it is unequal to measure itself
 It provokes me forever it says sarcastically
 Walt you contain enough why dont you let it out then

 Come now I will not be tantalized you conceive too much of
 articulation
 Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded
 Waiting in gloom protected by frost
 The dirt receding before my prophetical screams
 I underlying causes to balance them at last
 My knowledge my live parts it keeping tally with the meaning of all things
 Happiness which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search
 of this day

 My final merit I refuse you I refuse putting from me what I really am
 Encompass worlds but never try to encompass me
 I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you

 Writing and talk do not prove me
 I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face
 With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic

 26
 Now I will do nothing but listen
 To accrue what I hear into this song to let sounds contribute toward it

 I hear bravuras of birds bustle of growing wheat gossip of flames
 clack of sticks cooking my meals
 I hear the sound I love the sound of the human voice
 I hear all sounds running together combined fused or following
 Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city sounds of the day and night
 Talkative young ones to those that like them the loud laugh of
 workpeople at their meals
 The angry base of disjointed friendship the faint tones of the sick
 The judge with hands tight to the desk his pallid lips pronouncing
 a deathsentence
 The heaveeyo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves the
 refrain of the anchorlifters
 The ring of alarmbells the cry of fire the whirr of swiftstreaking
 engines and hosecarts with premonitory tinkles and colord lights
 The steamwhistle the solid roll of the train of approaching cars
 The slow march playd at the head of the association marching two and two
 They go to guard some corpse the flagtops are draped with black muslin

 I hear the violoncello tis the young mans hearts complaint
 I hear the keyd cornet it glides quickly in through my ears
 It shakes madsweet pangs through my belly and breast

 I hear the chorus it is a grand opera
 Ah this indeed is musicthis suits me

 A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me
 The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full

 I hear the traind soprano what work with hers is this
 The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies
 It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possessd them
 It sails me I dab with bare feet they are lickd by the indolent waves
 I am cut by bitter and angry hail I lose my breath
 Steepd amid honeyd morphine my windpipe throttled in fakes of death
 At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles
 And that we call Being

 27
 To be in any form what is that
 Round and round we go all of us and ever come back thither
 If nothing lay more developd the quahaug in its callous shell were enough

 Mine is no callous shell
 I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop
 They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me

 I merely stir press feel with my fingers and am happy
 To touch my person to some one elses is about as much as I can stand

 28
 Is this then a touch quivering me to a new identity
 Flames and ether making a rush for my veins
 Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them
 My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly
 different from myself
 On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs
 Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip
 Behaving licentious toward me taking no denial
 Depriving me of my best as for a purpose
 Unbuttoning my clothes holding me by the bare waist
 Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasturefields
 Immodestly sliding the fellowsenses away
 They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me
 No consideration no regard for my draining strength or my anger
 Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while
 Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me

 The sentries desert every other part of me
 They have left me helpless to a red marauder
 They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me

 I am given up by traitors
 I talk wildly I have lost my wits I and nobody else am the
 greatest traitor
 I went myself first to the headland my own hands carried me there

 You villain touch what are you doing my breath is tight in its throat
 Unclench your floodgates you are too much for me

 29
 Blind loving wrestling touch sheathd hooded sharptoothd touch
 Did it make you ache so leaving me

 Parting trackd by arriving perpetual payment of perpetual loan
 Rich showering rain and recompense richer afterward

 Sprouts take and accumulate stand by the curb prolific and vital
 Landscapes projected masculine fullsized and golden

 30
 All truths wait in all things
 They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it
 They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon
 The insignificant is as big to me as any
 What is less or more than a touch

 Logic and sermons never convince
 The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul

 Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so
 Only what nobody denies is so

 A minute and a drop of me settle my brain
 I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps
 And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman
 And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other
 And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it
 becomes omnific
 And until one and all shall delight us and we them

 31
 I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars
 And the pismire is equally perfect and a grain of sand and the egg
 of the wren
 And the treetoad is a chefdoeuvre for the highest
 And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven
 And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery
 And the cow crunching with depressd head surpasses any statue
 And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels

 I find I incorporate gneiss coal longthreaded moss fruits
 grains esculent roots
 And am stuccod with quadrupeds and birds all over
 And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons
 But call any thing back again when I desire it

 In vain the speeding or shyness
 In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach
 In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powderd bones
 In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes
 In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low
 In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky
 In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs
 In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods
 In vain the razorbilld auk sails far north to Labrador
 I follow quickly I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff

 32
 I think I could turn and live with animals they are so placid and
 selfcontaind
 I stand and look at them long and long

 They do not sweat and whine about their condition
 They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins
 They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God
 Not one is dissatisfied not one is demented with the mania of
 owning things
 Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that lived thousands of
 years ago
 Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth

 So they show their relations to me and I accept them
 They bring me tokens of myself they evince them plainly in their
 possession

 I wonder where they get those tokens
 Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them

 Myself moving forward then and now and forever
 Gathering and showing more always and with velocity
 Infinite and omnigenous and the like of these among them
 Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers
 Picking out here one that I love and now go with him on brotherly terms

 A gigantic beauty of a stallion fresh and responsive to my caresses
 Head high in the forehead wide between the ears
 Limbs glossy and supple tail dusting the ground
 Eyes full of sparkling wickedness ears finely cut flexibly moving

 His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him
 His wellbuilt limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return

 I but use you a minute then I resign you stallion
 Why do I need your paces when I myself outgallop them
 Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you

 33
 Space and Time now I see it is true what I guessd at
 What I guessd when I loafd on the grass
 What I guessd while I lay alone in my bed
 And again as I walkd the beach under the paling stars of the morning

 My ties and ballasts leave me my elbows rest in seagaps
 I skirt sierras my palms cover continents
 I am afoot with my vision

 By the citys quadrangular housesin log huts camping with lumbermen
 Along the ruts of the turnpike along the dry gulch and rivulet bed
 Weeding my onionpatch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips
 crossing savannas trailing in forests
 Prospecting golddigging girdling the trees of a new purchase
 Scorchd ankledeep by the hot sand hauling my boat down the
 shallow river
 Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead where the
 buck turns furiously at the hunter
 Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock where the
 otter is feeding on fish
 Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou
 Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey where the
 beaver pats the mud with his paddleshaped tall
 Over the growing sugar over the yellowflowerd cotton plant over
 the rice in its low moist field
 Over the sharppeakd farm house with its scallopd scum and
 slender shoots from the gutters
 Over the western persimmon over the longleavd corn over the
 delicate blueflower flax
 Over the white and brown buckwheat a hummer and buzzer there with
 the rest
 Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze
 Scaling mountains pulling myself cautiously up holding on by low
 scragged limbs
 Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush
 Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheatlot
 Where the bat flies in the Seventhmonth eve where the great
 goldbug drops through the dark
 Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to
 the meadow
 Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous
 shuddering of their hides
 Where the cheesecloth hangs in the kitchen where andirons straddle
 the hearthslab where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters
 Where triphammers crash where the press is whirling its cylinders
 Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs
 Where the pearshaped balloon is floating aloft floating in it
 myself and looking composedly down
 Where the lifecar is drawn on the slipnoose where the heat
 hatches palegreen eggs in the dented sand
 Where the shewhale swims with her calf and never forsakes it
 Where the steamship trails hindways its long pennant of smoke
 Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water
 Where the halfburnd brig is riding on unknown currents
 Where shells grow to her slimy deck where the dead are corrupting below
 Where the densestarrd flag is borne at the head of the regiments
 Approaching Manhattan up by the longstretching island
 Under Niagara the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance
 Upon a doorstep upon the horseblock of hard wood outside
 Upon the racecourse or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of
 baseball
 At hefestivals with blackguard gibes ironical license
 bulldances drinking laughter
 At the cidermill tasting the sweets of the brown mash sucking the
 juice through a straw
 At applepeelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find
 At musters beachparties friendly bees huskings houseraisings
 Where the mockingbird sounds his delicious gurgles cackles
 screams weeps
 Where the hayrick stands in the barnyard where the drystalks are
 scatterd where the broodcow waits in the hovel
 Where the bull advances to do his masculine work where the stud to
 the mare where the cock is treading the hen
 Where the heifers browse where geese nip their food with short jerks
 Where sundown shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie
 Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles
 far and near
 Where the hummingbird shimmers where the neck of the longlived
 swan is curving and winding
 Where the laughinggull scoots by the shore where she laughs her
 nearhuman laugh
 Where beehives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the
 high weeds
 Where bandneckd partridges roost in a ring on the ground with
 their heads out
 Where burial coaches enter the archd gates of a cemetery
 Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees
 Where the yellowcrownd heron comes to the edge of the marsh at
 night and feeds upon small crabs
 Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon
 Where the katydid works her chromatic reed on the walnuttree over
 the well
 Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silverwired leaves
 Through the saltlick or orange glade or under conical firs
 Through the gymnasium through the curtaind saloon through the
 office or public hall
 Pleasd with the native and pleasd with the foreign pleasd with
 the new and old
 Pleasd with the homely woman as well as the handsome
 Pleasd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously
 Pleasd with the tune of the choir of the whitewashd church
 Pleasd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher
 impressd seriously at the campmeeting
 Looking in at the shopwindows of Broadway the whole forenoon
 flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass
 Wandering the same afternoon with my face turnd up to the clouds
 or down a lane or along the beach
 My right and left arms round the sides of two friends and I in the middle
 Coming home with the silent and darkcheekd bushboy behind me
 he rides at the drape of the day
 Far from the settlements studying the print of animals feet or the
 moccasin print
 By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient
 Nigh the coffind corpse when all is still examining with a candle
 Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure
 Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any
 Hot toward one I hate ready in my madness to knife him
 Solitary at midnight in my back yard my thoughts gone from me a long while
 Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side
 Speeding through space speeding through heaven and the stars
 Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring and the
 diameter of eighty thousand miles
 Speeding with taild meteors throwing fireballs like the rest
 Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly
 Storming enjoying planning loving cautioning
 Backing and filling appearing and disappearing
 I tread day and night such roads

 I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product
 And look at quintillions ripend and look at quintillions green

 I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul
 My course runs below the soundings of plummets

 I help myself to material and immaterial
 No guard can shut me off no law prevent me

 I anchor my ship for a little while only
 My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me

 I go hunting polar furs and the seal leaping chasms with a
 pikepointed staff clinging to topples of brittle and blue

 I ascend to the foretruck
 I take my place late at night in the crowsnest
 We sail the arctic sea it is plenty light enough
 Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty
 The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them the scenery is
 plain in all directions
 The whitetopt mountains show in the distance I fling out my
 fancies toward them
 We are approaching some great battlefield in which we are soon to
 be engaged
 We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment we pass with still
 feet and caution
 Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruind city
 The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities
 of the globe

 I am a free companion I bivouac by invading watchfires
 I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself
 I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips

 My voice is the wifes voice the screech by the rail of the stairs
 They fetch my mans body up dripping and drownd

 I understand the large hearts of heroes
 The courage of present times and all times
 How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the
 steamship and Death chasing it up and down the storm
 How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch and was faithful of
 days and faithful of nights
 And chalkd in large letters on a board Be of good cheer we will
 not desert you
 How he followd with them and tackd with them three days and
 would not give it up
 How he saved the drifting company at last
 How the lank loosegownd women lookd when boated from the
 side of their prepared graves
 How the silent oldfaced infants and the lifted sick and the
 sharplippd unshaved men
 All this I swallow it tastes good I like it well it becomes mine
 I am the man I sufferd I was there

 The disdain and calmness of martyrs
 The mother of old condemnd for a witch burnt with dry wood her
 children gazing on
 The hounded slave that flags in the race leans by the fence
 blowing coverd with sweat
 The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck the murderous
 buckshot and the bullets
 All these I feel or am

 I am the hounded slave I wince at the bite of the dogs
 Hell and despair are upon me crack and again crack the marksmen
 I clutch the rails of the fence my gore dribs thinnd with the
 ooze of my skin
 I fall on the weeds and stones
 The riders spur their unwilling horses haul close
 Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whipstocks

 Agonies are one of my changes of garments
 I do not ask the wounded person how he feels I myself become the
 wounded person
 My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe

 I am the mashd fireman with breastbone broken
 Tumbling walls buried me in their debris
 Heat and smoke I inspired I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades
 I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels
 They have cleard the beams away they tenderly lift me forth

 I lie in the night air in my red shirt the pervading hush is for my sake
 Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy
 White and beautiful are the faces around me the heads are bared
 of their firecaps
 The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches

 Distant and dead resuscitate
 They show as the dial or move as the hands of me I am the clock myself

 I am an old artillerist I tell of my forts bombardment
 I am there again

 Again the long roll of the drummers
 Again the attacking cannon mortars
 Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive

 I take part I see and hear the whole
 The cries curses roar the plaudits for wellaimd shots
 The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip
 Workmen searching after damages making indispensable repairs
 The fall of grenades through the rent roof the fanshaped explosion
 The whizz of limbs heads stone wood iron high in the air

 Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general he furiously waves
 with his hand
 He gasps through the clot Mind not memindthe entrenchments

 34
 Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth
 I tell not the fall of Alamo
 Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo
 The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo
 Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve
 young men

 Retreating they had formd in a hollow square with their baggage for
 breastworks
 Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies nine times their
 number was the price they took in advance
 Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone
 They treated for an honorable capitulation receivd writing and
 seal gave up their arms and marchd back prisoners of war

 They were the glory of the race of rangers
 Matchless with horse rifle song supper courtship
 Large turbulent generous handsome proud and affectionate
 Bearded sunburnt drest in the free costume of hunters
 Not a single one over thirty years of age

 The second Firstday morning they were brought out in squads and
 massacred it was beautiful early summer
 The work commenced about five oclock and was over by eight

 None obeyd the command to kneel
 Some made a mad and helpless rush some stood stark and straight
 A few fell at once shot in the temple or heart the living and dead
 lay together
 The maimd and mangled dug in the dirt the newcomers saw them there
 Some halfkilld attempted to crawl away
 These were despatchd with bayonets or batterd with the blunts of muskets
 A youth not seventeen years old seizd his assassin till two more
 came to release him
 The three were all torn and coverd with the boys blood

 At eleven oclock began the burning of the bodies
 That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men

 35
 Would you hear of an oldtime seafight
 Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars
 List to the yarn as my grandmothers father the sailor told it to me

 Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you said he
 His was the surly English pluck and there is no tougher or truer
 and never was and never will be
 Along the lowerd eve he came horribly raking us

 We closed with him the yards entangled the cannon touchd
 My captain lashd fast with his own hands

 We had receivd some eighteen pound shots under the water
 On our lowergundeck two large pieces had burst at the first fire
 killing all around and blowing up overhead

 Fighting at sundown fighting at dark
 Ten oclock at night the full moon well up our leaks on the gain
 and five feet of water reported
 The masteratarms loosing the prisoners confined in the afterhold
 to give them a chance for themselves

 The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels
 They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust

 Our frigate takes fire
 The other asks if we demand quarter
 If our colors are struck and the fighting done

 Now I laugh content for I hear the voice of my little captain
 We have not struck he composedly cries we have just begun our part
 of the fighting

 Only three guns are in use
 One is directed by the captain himself against the enemys mainmast
 Two well servd with grape and canister silence his musketry and
 clear his decks

 The tops alone second the fire of this little battery especially
 the maintop
 They hold out bravely during the whole of the action

 Not a moments cease
 The leaks gain fast on the pumps the fire eats toward the powdermagazine

 One of the pumps has been shot away it is generally thought we are sinking

 Serene stands the little captain
 He is not hurried his voice is neither high nor low
 His eyes give more light to us than our battlelanterns

 Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us

 36
 Stretchd and still lies the midnight
 Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness
 Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking preparations to pass to the
 one we have conquerd
 The captain on the quarterdeck coldly giving his orders through a
 countenance white as a sheet
 Near by the corpse of the child that servd in the cabin
 The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully
 curld whiskers
 The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below
 The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty
 Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves dabs of flesh
 upon the masts and spars
 Cut of cordage dangle of rigging slight shock of the soothe of waves
 Black and impassive guns litter of powderparcels strong scent
 A few large stars overhead silent and mournful shining
 Delicate sniffs of seabreeze smells of sedgy grass and fields by
 the shore deathmessages given in charge to survivors
 The hiss of the surgeons knife the gnawing teeth of his saw
 Wheeze cluck swash of falling blood short wild scream and long
 dull tapering groan
 These so these irretrievable

 37
 You laggards there on guard look to your arms
 In at the conquerd doors they crowd I am possessd
 Embody all presences outlawd or suffering
 See myself in prison shaped like another man
 And feel the dull unintermitted pain

 For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch
 It is I let out in the morning and barrd at night

 Not a mutineer walks handcuffd to jail but I am handcuffd to him
 and walk by his side
 I am less the jolly one there and more the silent one with sweat
 on my twitching lips

 Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too and am tried
 and sentenced

 Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp
 My face is ashcolord my sinews gnarl away from me people retreat

 Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them
 I project my hat sit shamefaced and beg

 38
 Enough enough enough
 Somehow I have been stunnd Stand back
 Give me a little time beyond my cuffd head slumbers dreams gaping
 I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake

 That I could forget the mockers and insults
 That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the
 bludgeons and hammers
 That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and
 bloody crowning

 I remember now
 I resume the overstaid fraction
 The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it or to any graves
 Corpses rise gashes heal fastenings roll from me

 I troop forth replenishd with supreme power one of an average
 unending procession
 Inland and seacoast we go and pass all boundary lines
 Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth
 The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years

 Eleves I salute you come forward
 Continue your annotations continue your questionings

 39
 The friendly and flowing savage who is he
 Is he waiting for civilization or past it and mastering it

 Is he some Southwesterner raisd outdoors is he Kanadian
 Is he from the Mississippi country Iowa Oregon California
 The mountains prairielife bushlife or sailor from the sea

 Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him
 They desire he should like them touch them speak to them stay with them

 Behavior lawless as snowflakes words simple as grass uncombd
 head laughter and naivete
 Slowstepping feet common features common modes and emanations
 They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers
 They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath they fly out of
 the glance of his eyes

 40
 Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your basklie over
 You light surfaces only I force surfaces and depths also

 Earth you seem to look for something at my hands
 Say old topknot what do you want

 Man or woman I might tell how I like you but cannot
 And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you but cannot
 And might tell that pining I have that pulse of my nights and days

 Behold I do not give lectures or a little charity
 When I give I give myself

 You there impotent loose in the knees
 Open your scarfd chops till I blow grit within you
 Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets
 I am not to be denied I compel I have stores plenty and to spare
 And any thing I have I bestow

 I do not ask who you are that is not important to me
 You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you

 To cottonfield drudge or cleaner of privies I lean
 On his right cheek I put the family kiss
 And in my soul I swear I never will deny him

 On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes
 This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics

 To any one dying thither I speed and twist the knob of the door
 Turn the bedclothes toward the foot of the bed
 Let the physician and the priest go home

 I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will
 O despairer here is my neck
 By God you shall not go down hang your whole weight upon me

 I dilate you with tremendous breath I buoy you up
 Every room of the house do I fill with an armd force
 Lovers of me bafflers of graves

 SleepI and they keep guard all night
 Not doubt not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you
 I have embraced you and henceforth possess you to myself
 And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so

 41
 I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs
 And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help

 I heard what was said of the universe
 Heard it and heard it of several thousand years
 It is middling well as far as it goesbut is that all

 Magnifying and applying come I
 Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters
 Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah
 Lithographing Kronos Zeus his son and Hercules his grandson
 Buying drafts of Osiris Isis Belus Brahma Buddha
 In my portfolio placing Manito loose Allah on a leaf the crucifix
 engraved
 With Odin and the hideousfaced Mexitli and every idol and image
 Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more
 Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days
 They bore mites as for unfledgd birds who have now to rise and fly
 and sing for themselves
 Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself
 bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see
 Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house
 Putting higher claims for him there with his rolldup sleeves
 driving the mallet and chisel
 Not objecting to special revelations considering a curl of smoke or
 a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation
 Lads ahold of fireengines and hookandladder ropes no less to me
 than the gods of the antique wars
 Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction
 Their brawny limbs passing safe over charrd laths their white
 foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames
 By the mechanics wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for
 every person born
 Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels
 with shirts baggd out at their waists
 The snagtoothd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come
 Selling all he possesses traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his
 brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery
 What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me and
 not filling the square rod then
 The bull and the bug never worshippd half enough
 Dung and dirt more admirable than was dreamd
 The supernatural of no account myself waiting my time to be one of
 the supremes
 The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the
 best and be as prodigious
 By my lifelumps becoming already a creator
 Putting myself here and now to the ambushd womb of the shadows


 42
 A call in the midst of the crowd
 My own voice orotund sweeping and final

 Come my children
 Come my boys and girls my women household and intimates
 Now the performer launches his nerve he has passd his prelude on
 the reeds within

 Easily written loosefingerd chordsI feel the thrum of your
 climax and close

 My head slues round on my neck
 Music rolls but not from the organ
 Folks are around me but they are no household of mine

 Ever the hard unsunk ground
 Ever the eaters and drinkers ever the upward and downward sun ever
 the air and the ceaseless tides
 Ever myself and my neighbors refreshing wicked real
 Ever the old inexplicable query ever that thornd thumb that
 breath of itches and thirsts
 Ever the vexers hoot hoot till we find where the sly one hides
 and bring him forth
 Ever love ever the sobbing liquid of life
 Ever the bandage under the chin ever the trestles of death

 Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking
 To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning
 Tickets buying taking selling but in to the feast never once going
 Many sweating ploughing thrashing and then the chaff for payment
 receiving
 A few idly owning and they the wheat continually claiming

 This is the city and I am one of the citizens
 Whatever interests the rest interests me politics wars markets
 newspapers schools
 The mayor and councils banks tariffs steamships factories
 stocks stores real estate and personal estate

 The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and taild coats
 I am aware who they are they are positively not worms or fleas
 I acknowledge the duplicates of myself the weakest and shallowest
 is deathless with me
 What I do and say the same waits for them
 Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them

 I know perfectly well my own egotism
 Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less
 And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself

 Not words of routine this song of mine
 But abruptly to question to leap beyond yet nearer bring
 This printed and bound bookbut the printer and the
 printingoffice boy
 The welltaken photographsbut your wife or friend close and solid
 in your arms
 The black ship maild with iron her mighty guns in her turretsbut
 the pluck of the captain and engineers
 In the houses the dishes and fare and furniturebut the host and
 hostess and the look out of their eyes
 The sky up thereyet here or next door or across the way
 The saints and sages in historybut you yourself
 Sermons creeds theologybut the fathomless human brain
 And what is reason and what is love and what is life

 43
 I do not despise you priests all time the world over
 My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths
 Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern
 Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years
 Waiting responses from oracles honoring the gods saluting the sun
 Making a fetich of the first rock or stump powowing with sticks in
 the circle of obis
 Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols
 Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession rapt and
 austere in the woods a gymnosophist
 Drinking mead from the skullcap to Shastas and Vedas admirant
 minding the Koran
 Walking the teokallis spotted with gore from the stone and knife
 beating the serpentskin drum
 Accepting the Gospels accepting him that was crucified knowing
 assuredly that he is divine
 To the mass kneeling or the puritans prayer rising or sitting
 patiently in a pew
 Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis or waiting deadlike till
 my spirit arouses me
 Looking forth on pavement and land or outside of pavement and land
 Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits

 One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like
 man leaving charges before a journey

 Downhearted doubters dull and excluded
 Frivolous sullen moping angry affected disheartend atheistical
 I know every one of you I know the sea of torment doubt despair
 and unbelief

 How the flukes splash
 How they contort rapid as lightning with spasms and spouts of blood

 Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers
 I take my place among you as much as among any
 The past is the push of you me all precisely the same
 And what is yet untried and afterward is for you me all precisely
 the same

 I do not know what is untried and afterward
 But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient and cannot fail

 Each who passes is considerd each who stops is considerd not
 single one can it fall

 It cannot fall the young man who died and was buried
 Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side
 Nor the little child that peepd in at the door and then drew back
 and was never seen again
 Nor the old man who has lived without purpose and feels it with
 bitterness worse than gall
 Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder
 Nor the numberless slaughterd and wreckd nor the brutish koboo
 calld the ordure of humanity
 Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in
 Nor any thing in the earth or down in the oldest graves of the earth
 Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres nor the myriads of myriads
 that inhabit them
 Nor the present nor the least wisp that is known

 44
 It is time to explain myselflet us stand up

 What is known I strip away
 I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown

 The clock indicates the momentbut what does eternity indicate

 We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers
 There are trillions ahead and trillions ahead of them

 Births have brought us richness and variety
 And other births will bring us richness and variety

 I do not call one greater and one smaller
 That which fills its period and place is equal to any

 Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you my brother my sister
 I am sorry for you they are not murderous or jealous upon me
 All has been gentle with me I keep no account with lamentation
 What have I to do with lamentation

 I am an acme of things accomplishd and I an encloser of things to be

 My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs
 On every step bunches of ages and larger bunches between the steps
 All below duly traveld and still I mount and mount

 Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me
 Afar down I see the huge first Nothing I know I was even there
 I waited unseen and always and slept through the lethargic mist
 And took my time and took no hurt from the fetid carbon

 Long I was huggd closelong and long

 Immense have been the preparations for me
 Faithful and friendly the arms that have helpd me

 Cycles ferried my cradle rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen
 For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings
 They sent influences to look after what was to hold me

 Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me
 My embryo has never been torpid nothing could overlay it

 For it the nebula cohered to an orb
 The long slow strata piled to rest it on
 Vast vegetables gave it sustenance
 Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it
 with care

 All forces have been steadily employd to complete and delight me
 Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul


 45
 O span of youth everpushd elasticity
 O manhood balanced florid and full

 My lovers suffocate me
 Crowding my lips thick in the pores of my skin
 Jostling me through streets and public halls coming naked to me at night
 Crying by day Ahoy from the rocks of the river swinging and
 chirping over my head
 Calling my name from flowerbeds vines tangled underbrush
 Lighting on every moment of my life
 Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses
 Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine

 Old age superbly rising O welcome ineffable grace of dying days

 Every condition promulges not only itself it promulges what grows
 after and out of itself
 And the dark hush promulges as much as any

 I open my scuttle at night and see the farsprinkled systems
 And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of
 the farther systems

 Wider and wider they spread expanding always expanding
 Outward and outward and forever outward

 My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels
 He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit
 And greater sets follow making specks of the greatest inside them

 There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage
 If I you and the worlds and all beneath or upon their surfaces
 were this moment reduced back to a pallid float it would
 not avail the long run
 We should surely bring up again where we now stand
 And surely go as much farther and then farther and farther

 A few quadrillions of eras a few octillions of cubic leagues do
 not hazard the span or make it impatient
 They are but parts any thing is but a part

 See ever so far there is limitless space outside of that
 Count ever so much there is limitless time around that

 My rendezvous is appointed it is certain
 The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms
 The great Camerado the lover true for whom I pine will be there

 46
 I know I have the best of time and space and was never measured and
 never will be measured

 I tramp a perpetual journey come listen all
 My signs are a rainproof coat good shoes and a staff cut from the woods
 No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair
 I have no chair no church no philosophy
 I lead no man to a dinnertable library exchange
 But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll
 My left hand hooking you round the waist
 My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road

 Not I not any one else can travel that road for you
 You must travel it for yourself

 It is not far it is within reach
 Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know
 Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land

 Shoulder your duds dear son and I will mine and let us hasten forth
 Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go

 If you tire give me both burdens and rest the chuff of your hand
 on my hip
 And in due time you shall repay the same service to me
 For after we start we never lie by again

 This day before dawn I ascended a hill and lookd at the crowded heaven
 And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs
 and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them shall we
 be filld and satisfied then
 And my spirit said No we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond

 You are also asking me questions and I hear you
 I answer that I cannot answer you must find out for yourself

 Sit a while dear son
 Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink
 But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes I kiss you
 with a goodby kiss and open the gate for your egress hence

 Long enough have you dreamd contemptible dreams
 Now I wash the gum from your eyes
 You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every
 moment of your life

 Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore
 Now I will you to be a bold swimmer
 To jump off in the midst of the sea rise again nod to me shout
 and laughingly dash with your hair

 47
 I am the teacher of athletes
 He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own
 He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher

 The boy I love the same becomes a man not through derived power
 but in his own right
 Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear
 Fond of his sweetheart relishing well his steak
 Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts
 Firstrate to ride to fight to hit the bulls eye to sail a
 skiff to sing a song or play on the banjo
 Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with smallpox over
 all latherers
 And those welltannd to those that keep out of the sun

 I teach straying from me yet who can stray from me
 I follow you whoever you are from the present hour
 My words itch at your ears till you understand them

 I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while
 I wait for a boat
 It is you talking just as much as myself I act as the tongue of you
 Tied in your mouth in mine it begins to be loosend

 I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house
 And I swear I will never translate myself at all only to him or her
 who privately stays with me in the open air

 If you would understand me go to the heights or watershore
 The nearest gnat is an explanation and a drop or motion of waves key
 The maul the oar the handsaw second my words

 No shutterd room or school can commune with me
 But roughs and little children better than they

 The young mechanic is closest to me he knows me well
 The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with
 him all day
 The farmboy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice
 In vessels that sail my words sail I go with fishermen and seamen
 and love them

 The soldier campd or upon the march is mine
 On the night ere the pending battle many seek me and I do not fail them
 On that solemn night it may be their last those that know me seek me
 My face rubs to the hunters face when he lies down alone in his blanket
 The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon
 The young mother and old mother comprehend me
 The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are
 They and all would resume what I have told them

 48
 I have said that the soul is not more than the body
 And I have said that the body is not more than the soul
 And nothing not God is greater to one than ones self is
 And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own
 funeral drest in his shroud
 And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth
 And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the
 learning of all times
 And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it
 may become a hero
 And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheeld universe
 And I say to any man or woman Let your soul stand cool and composed
 before a million universes

 And I say to mankind Be not curious about God
 For I who am curious about each am not curious about God
 No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and
 about death

 I hear and behold God in every object yet understand God not in the least
 Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself

 Why should I wish to see God better than this day
 I see something of God each hour of the twentyfour and each moment then
 In the faces of men and women I see God and in my own face in the glass
 I find letters from God dropt in the street and every one is signd
 by Gods name
 And I leave them where they are for I know that wheresoeer I go
 Others will punctually come for ever and ever

 49
 And as to you Death and you bitter hug of mortality it is idle to
 try to alarm me

 To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes
 I see the elderhand pressing receiving supporting
 I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors
 And mark the outlet and mark the relief and escape

 And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure but that does not
 offend me
 I smell the white roses sweetscented and growing
 I reach to the leafy lips I reach to the polishd breasts of melons

 And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths
 No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before

 I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven
 O sunsO grass of gravesO perpetual transfers and promotions
 If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing

 Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest
 Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight
 Toss sparkles of day and dusktoss on the black stems that decay
 in the muck
 Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs

 I ascend from the moon I ascend from the night
 I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected
 And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small

 50
 There is that in meI do not know what it isbut I know it is in me

 Wrenchd and sweatycalm and cool then my body becomes
 I sleepI sleep long

 I do not know itit is without nameit is a word unsaid
 It is not in any dictionary utterance symbol

 Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on
 To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me

 Perhaps I might tell more Outlines I plead for my brothers and sisters

 Do you see O my brothers and sisters
 It is not chaos or deathit is form union planit is eternal
 lifeit is Happiness

 51
 The past and present wiltI have filld them emptied them
 And proceed to fill my next fold of the future

 Listener up there what have you to confide to me
 Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening
 Talk honestly no one else hears you and I stay only a minute longer

 Do I contradict myself
 Very well then I contradict myself
 I am large I contain multitudes

 I concentrate toward them that are nigh I wait on the doorslab

 Who has done his days work who will soonest be through with his supper
 Who wishes to walk with me

 Will you speak before I am gone will you prove already too late

 52
 The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me he complains of my gab
 and my loitering

 I too am not a bit tamed I too am untranslatable
 I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world

 The last scud of day holds back for me
 It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadowd wilds
 It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk

 I depart as air I shake my white locks at the runaway sun
 I effuse my flesh in eddies and drift it in lacy jags

 I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love
 If you want me again look for me under your bootsoles

 You will hardly know who I am or what I mean
 But I shall be good health to you nevertheless
 And filter and fibre your blood

 Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged
 Missing me one place search another
 I stop somewhere waiting for you




BOOK IV CHILDREN OF ADAM


To the Garden the World

 To the garden the world anew ascending
 Potent mates daughters sons preluding
 The love the life of their bodies meaning and being
 Curious here behold my resurrection after slumber
 The revolving cycles in their wide sweep having brought me again
 Amorous mature all beautiful to me all wondrous
 My limbs and the quivering fire that ever plays through them for
 reasons most wondrous
 Existing I peer and penetrate still
 Content with the present content with the past
 By my side or back of me Eve following
 Or in front and I following her just the same




From PentUp Aching Rivers

 From pentup aching rivers
 From that of myself without which I were nothing
 From what I am determind to make illustrious even if I stand sole
 among men
 From my own voice resonant singing the phallus
 Singing the song of procreation
 Singing the need of superb children and therein superb grown people
 Singing the muscular urge and the blending
 Singing the bedfellows song O resistless yearning
 O for any and each the body correlative attracting
 O for you whoever you are your correlative body O it more than all
 else you delighting
 From the hungry gnaw that eats me night and day
 From native moments from bashful pains singing them
 Seeking something yet unfound though I have diligently sought it
 many a long year
 Singing the true song of the soul fitful at random
 Renascent with grossest Nature or among animals
 Of that of them and what goes with them my poems informing
 Of the smell of apples and lemons of the pairing of birds
 Of the wet of woods of the lapping of waves
 Of the mad pushes of waves upon the land I them chanting
 The overture lightly sounding the strain anticipating
 The welcome nearness the sight of the perfect body
 The swimmer swimming naked in the bath or motionless on his back
 lying and floating
 The female form approaching I pensive loveflesh tremulous aching
 The divine list for myself or you or for any one making
 The face the limbs the index from head to foot and what it arouses
 The mystic deliria the madness amorous the utter abandonment
 Hark close and still what I now whisper to you
 I love you O you entirely possess me
 O that you and I escape from the rest and go utterly off free and lawless
 Two hawks in the air two fishes swimming in the sea not more
 lawless than we
 The furious storm through me careering I passionately trembling
 The oath of the inseparableness of two together of the woman that
 loves me and whom I love more than my life that oath swearing
 O I willingly stake all for you
 O let me be lost if it must be so
 O you and I what is it to us what the rest do or think
 What is all else to us only that we enjoy each other and exhaust
 each other if it must be so
 From the master the pilot I yield the vessel to
 The general commanding me commanding all from him permission taking
 From time the programme hastening I have loiterd too long as it is
 From sex from the warp and from the woof
 From privacy from frequent repinings alone
 From plenty of persons near and yet the right person not near
 From the soft sliding of hands over me and thrusting of fingers
 through my hair and beard
 From the long sustaind kiss upon the mouth or bosom
 From the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk fainting
 with excess
 From what the divine husband knows from the work of fatherhood
 From exultation victory and relief from the bedfellows embrace in
 the night
 From the actpoems of eyes hands hips and bosoms
 From the cling of the trembling arm
 From the bending curve and the clinch
 From side by side the pliant coverlet offthrowing
 From the one so unwilling to have me leave and me just as unwilling
 to leave
 Yet a moment O tender waiter and I return
 From the hour of shining stars and dropping dews
 From the night a moment I emerging flitting out
 Celebrate you act divine and you children prepared for
 And you stalwart loins




I Sing the Body Electric

 1
 I sing the body electric
 The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them
 They will not let me off till I go with them respond to them
 And discorrupt them and charge them full with the charge of the soul

 Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves
 And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead
 And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul
 And if the body were not the soul what is the soul

 2
 The love of the body of man or woman balks account the body itself
 balks account
 That of the male is perfect and that of the female is perfect

 The expression of the face balks account
 But the expression of a wellmade man appears not only in his face
 It is in his limbs and joints also it is curiously in the joints of
 his hips and wrists
 It is in his walk the carriage of his neck the flex of his waist
 and knees dress does not hide him
 The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth
 To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem perhaps more
 You linger to see his back and the back of his neck and shoulderside

 The sprawl and fulness of babes the bosoms and heads of women the
 folds of their dress their style as we pass in the street the
 contour of their shape downwards
 The swimmer naked in the swimmingbath seen as he swims through
 the transparent greenshine or lies with his face up and rolls
 silently to and from the heave of the water
 The bending forward and backward of rowers in rowboats the
 horseman in his saddle
 Girls mothers housekeepers in all their performances
 The group of laborers seated at noontime with their open
 dinnerkettles and their wives waiting
 The female soothing a child the farmers daughter in the garden or
 cowyard
 The young fellow hosing corn the sleighdriver driving his six
 horses through the crowd
 The wrestle of wrestlers two apprenticeboys quite grown lusty
 goodnatured nativeborn out on the vacant lot at sundown after work
 The coats and caps thrown down the embrace of love and resistance
 The upperhold and underhold the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes
 The march of firemen in their own costumes the play of masculine
 muscle through cleansetting trowsers and waiststraps
 The slow return from the fire the pause when the bell strikes
 suddenly again and the listening on the alert
 The natural perfect varied attitudes the bent head the curvd
 neck and the counting
 Suchlike I loveI loosen myself pass freely am at the mothers
 breast with the little child
 Swim with the swimmers wrestle with wrestlers march in line with
 the firemen and pause listen count

 3
 I knew a man a common farmer the father of five sons
 And in them the fathers of sons and in them the fathers of sons

 This man was a wonderful vigor calmness beauty of person
 The shape of his head the pale yellow and white of his hair and
 beard the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes the richness
 and breadth of his manners
 These I used to go and visit him to see he was wise also
 He was six feet tall he was over eighty years old his sons were
 massive clean bearded tanfaced handsome
 They and his daughters loved him all who saw him loved him
 They did not love him by allowance they loved him with personal love
 He drank water only the blood showd like scarlet through the
 clearbrown skin of his face
 He was a frequent gunner and fisher he saild his boat himself he
 had a fine one presented to him by a shipjoiner he had
 fowlingpieces presented to him by men that loved him
 When he went with his five sons and many grandsons to hunt or fish
 you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang
 You would wish long and long to be with him you would wish to sit
 by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other

 4
 I have perceivd that to be with those I like is enough
 To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough
 To be surrounded by beautiful curious breathing laughing flesh is enough
 To pass among them or touch any one or rest my arm ever so lightly
 round his or her neck for a moment what is this then
 I do not ask any more delight I swim in it as in a sea

 There is something in staying close to men and women and looking
 on them and in the contact and odor of them that pleases the soul well
 All things please the soul but these please the soul well

 5
 This is the female form
 A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot
 It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction
 I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor
 all falls aside but myself and it
 Books art religion time the visible and solid earth and what
 was expected of heaven or feard of hell are now consumed
 Mad filaments ungovernable shoots play out of it the response
 likewise ungovernable
 Hair bosom hips bend of legs negligent falling hands all
 diffused mine too diffused
 Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb loveflesh swelling
 and deliciously aching
 Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous quivering jelly of
 love whiteblow and delirious nice
 Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn
 Undulating into the willing and yielding day
 Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweetfleshd day

 This the nucleusafter the child is born of woman man is born of woman
 This the bath of birth this the merge of small and large and the
 outlet again

 Be not ashamed women your privilege encloses the rest and is the
 exit of the rest
 You are the gates of the body and you are the gates of the soul

 The female contains all qualities and tempers them
 She is in her place and moves with perfect balance
 She is all things duly veild she is both passive and active
 She is to conceive daughters as well as sons and sons as well as daughters

 As I see my soul reflected in Nature
 As I see through a mist One with inexpressible completeness
 sanity beauty
 See the bent head and arms folded over the breast the Female I see

 6
 The male is not less the soul nor more he too is in his place
 He too is all qualities he is action and power
 The flush of the known universe is in him
 Scorn becomes him well and appetite and defiance become him well
 The wildest largest passions bliss that is utmost sorrow that is
 utmost become him well pride is for him
 The fullspread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul
 Knowledge becomes him he likes it always he brings every thing to
 the test of himself
 Whatever the survey whatever the sea and the sail he strikes
 soundings at last only here
 Where else does he strike soundings except here

 The mans body is sacred and the womans body is sacred
 No matter who it is it is sacredis it the meanest one in the
 laborers gang
 Is it one of the dullfaced immigrants just landed on the wharf
 Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the welloff just as
 much as you
 Each has his or her place in the procession

 All is a procession
 The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion

 Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant
 Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight and he or she has
 no right to a sight
 Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float and
 the soil is on the surface and water runs and vegetation sprouts
 For you only and not for him and her

 7
 A mans body at auction
 For before the war I often go to the slavemart and watch the sale
 I help the auctioneer the sloven does not half know his business

 Gentlemen look on this wonder
 Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it
 For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one
 animal or plant
 For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily rolld

 In this head the allbaffling brain
 In it and below it the makings of heroes

 Examine these limbs red black or white they are cunning in
 tendon and nerve
 They shall be stript that you may see them

 Exquisite senses lifelit eyes pluck volition
 Flakes of breastmuscle pliant backbone and neck flesh not flabby
 goodsized arms and legs
 And wonders within there yet

 Within there runs blood
 The same old blood the same redrunning blood
 There swells and jets a heart there all passions desires
 reachings aspirations
 Do you think they are not there because they are not expressd in
 parlors and lecturerooms

 This is not only one man this the father of those who shall be
 fathers in their turns
 In him the start of populous states and rich republics
 Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments

 How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring
 through the centuries
 Who might you find you have come from yourself if you could trace
 back through the centuries

 8
 A womans body at auction
 She too is not only herself she is the teeming mother of mothers
 She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers

 Have you ever loved the body of a woman
 Have you ever loved the body of a man
 Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations
 and times all over the earth

 If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred
 And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted
 And in man or woman a clean strong firmfibred body is more
 beautiful than the most beautiful face

 Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body or the fool
 that corrupted her own live body
 For they do not conceal themselves and cannot conceal themselves

 9
 O my body I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and
 women nor the likes of the parts of you
 I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of
 the soul and that they are the soul
 I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems and
 that they are my poems
 Mans womans child youths wifes husbands mothers
 fathers young mans young womans poems
 Head neck hair ears drop and tympan of the ears
 Eyes eyefringes iris of the eye eyebrows and the waking or
 sleeping of the lids
 Mouth tongue lips teeth roof of the mouth jaws and the jawhinges
 Nose nostrils of the nose and the partition
 Cheeks temples forehead chin throat back of the neck neckslue
 Strong shoulders manly beard scapula hindshoulders and the
 ample sideround of the chest
 Upperarm armpit elbowsocket lowerarm armsinews armbones
 Wrist and wristjoints hand palm knuckles thumb forefinger

 Broad breastfront curling hair of the breast breastbone breastside
 Ribs belly backbone joints of the backbone
 Hips hipsockets hipstrength inward and outward round

 Strong set of thighs well carrying the trunk above
 Legfibres knee kneepan upperleg underleg
 Ankles instep football toes toejoints the heel
 All attitudes all the shapeliness all the belongings of my or your
 body or of any ones body male or female
 The lungsponges the stomachsac the bowels sweet and clean
 The brain in its folds inside the skullframe
 Sympathies heartvalves palatevalves sexuality maternity
 Womanhood and all that is a woman and the man that comes from woman
 The womb the teats nipples breastmilk tears laughter weeping
 lovelooks loveperturbations and risings
 The voice articulation language whispering shouting aloud
 Food drink pulse digestion sweat sleep walking swimming
 Poise on the hips leaping reclining embracing armcurving and tightening
 The continual changes of the flex of the mouth and around the eyes
 The skin the sunburnt shade freckles hair
 The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked
 meat of the body
 The circling rivers the breath and breathing it in and out
 The beauty of the waist and thence of the hips and thence downward
 toward the knees
 The thin red jellies within you or within me the bones and the
 marrow in the bones
 The exquisite realization of health
 O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only but of the soul
 O I say now these are the soul




A Woman Waits for Me

 A woman waits for me she contains all nothing is lacking
 Yet all were lacking if sex were lacking or if the moisture of the
 right man were lacking

 Sex contains all bodies souls
 Meanings proofs purities delicacies results promulgations
 Songs commands health pride the maternal mystery the seminal milk
 All hopes benefactions bestowals all the passions loves
 beauties delights of the earth
 All the governments judges gods followd persons of the earth
 These are containd in sex as parts of itself and justifications of itself

 Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his sex
 Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers

 Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women
 I will go stay with her who waits for me and with those women that
 are warmblooded and sufficient for me
 I see that they understand me and do not deny me
 I see that they are worthy of me I will be the robust husband of
 those women

 They are not one jot less than I am
 They are tannd in the face by shining suns and blowing winds
 Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength
 They know how to swim row ride wrestle shoot run strike
 retreat advance resist defend themselves
 They are ultimate in their own rightthey are calm clear
 wellpossessd of themselves

 I draw you close to me you women
 I cannot let you go I would do you good
 I am for you and you are for me not only for our own sake but for
 others sakes
 Envelopd in you sleep greater heroes and bards
 They refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me

 It is I you women I make my way
 I am stern acrid large undissuadable but I love you
 I do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you
 I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for these States I
 press with slow rude muscle
 I brace myself effectually I listen to no entreaties
 I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long accumulated within me

 Through you I drain the pentup rivers of myself
 In you I wrap a thousand onward years
 On you I graft the grafts of the bestbeloved of me and America
 The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls
 new artists musicians and singers
 The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn
 I shall demand perfect men and women out of my lovespendings
 I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others as I and you
 interpenetrate now
 I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them as I
 count on the fruits of the gushing showers I give now
 I shall look for loving crops from the birth life death
 immortality I plant so lovingly now




Spontaneous Me

 Spontaneous me Nature
 The loving day the mounting sun the friend I am happy with
 The arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder
 The hillside whitend with blossoms of the mountain ash
 The same late in autumn the hues of red yellow drab purple and
 light and dark green
 The rich coverlet of the grass animals and birds the private
 untrimmd bank the primitive apples the pebblestones
 Beautiful dripping fragments the negligent list of one after
 another as I happen to call them to me or think of them
 The real poems what we call poems being merely pictures
 The poems of the privacy of the night and of men like me
 This poem drooping shy and unseen that I always carry and that all
 men carry
 Know once for all avowd on purpose wherever are men like me are
 our lusty lurking masculine poems
 Lovethoughts lovejuice loveodor loveyielding loveclimbers
 and the climbing sap
 Arms and hands of love lips of love phallic thumb of love breasts
 of love bellies pressd and glued together with love
 Earth of chaste love life that is only life after love
 The body of my love the body of the woman I love the body of the
 man the body of the earth
 Soft forenoon airs that blow from the southwest
 The hairy wildbee that murmurs and hankers up and down that gripes the
 fullgrown ladyflower curves upon her with amorous firm legs takes
 his will of her and holds himself tremulous and tight till he is
 satisfied
 The wet of woods through the early hours
 Two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep one with
 an arm slanting down across and below the waist of the other
 The smell of apples aromas from crushd sageplant mint birchbark
 The boys longings the glow and pressure as he confides to me what
 he was dreaming
 The dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl and falling still and
 content to the ground
 The noformd stings that sights people objects sting me with
 The hubbd sting of myself stinging me as much as it ever can any
 one
 The sensitive orbic underlappd brothers that only privileged
 feelers may be intimate where they are
 The curious roamer the hand roaming all over the body the bashful
 withdrawing of flesh where the fingers soothingly pause and
 edge themselves
 The limpid liquid within the young man
 The vexd corrosion so pensive and so painful
 The torment the irritable tide that will not be at rest
 The like of the same I feel the like of the same in others
 The young man that flushes and flushes and the young woman that
 flushes and flushes
 The young man that wakes deep at night the hot hand seeking to
 repress what would master him
 The mystic amorous night the strange halfwelcome pangs visions sweats
 The pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling fingers
 the young man all colord red ashamed angry
 The souse upon me of my lover the sea as I lie willing and naked
 The merriment of the twin babes that crawl over the grass in the
 sun the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from them
 The walnuttrunk the walnuthusks and the ripening or ripend
 longround walnuts
 The continence of vegetables birds animals
 The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or find myself indecent
 while birds and animals never once skulk or find themselves indecent
 The great chastity of paternity to match the great chastity of maternity
 The oath of procreation I have sworn my Adamic and fresh daughters
 The greed that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw till I saturate
 what shall produce boys to fill my place when I am through
 The wholesome relief repose content
 And this bunch pluckd at random from myself
 It has done its workI toss it carelessly to fall where it may




One Hour to Madness and Joy

 One hour to madness and joy O furious O confine me not
 What is this that frees me so in storms
 What do my shouts amid lightnings and raging winds mean
 O to drink the mystic deliria deeper than any other man
 O savage and tender achings I bequeath them to you my children
 I tell them to you for reasons O bridegroom and bride

 O to be yielded to you whoever you are and you to be yielded to me
 in defiance of the world
 O to return to Paradise O bashful and feminine
 O to draw you to me to plant on you for the first time the lips of
 a determind man

 O the puzzle the thricetied knot the deep and dark pool all
 untied and illumind
 O to speed where there is space enough and air enough at last
 To be absolvd from previous ties and conventions I from mine and
 you from yours
 To find a new unthoughtof nonchalance with the best of Nature
 To have the gag removd from ones mouth
 To have the feeling today or any day I am sufficient as I am

 O something unprovd something in a trance
 To escape utterly from others anchors and holds
 To drive free to love free to dash reckless and dangerous
 To court destruction with taunts with invitations
 To ascend to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me
 To rise thither with my inebriate soul
 To be lost if it must be so
 To feed the remainder of life with one hour of fulness and freedom
 With one brief hour of madness and joy




Out of the Rolling Ocean the Crowd

 Out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me
 Whispering I love you before long I die
 I have traveld a long way merely to look on you to touch you
 For I could not die till I once lookd on you
 For I feard I might afterward lose you

 Now we have met we have lookd we are safe
 Return in peace to the ocean my love
 I too am part of that ocean my love we are not so much separated
 Behold the great rondure the cohesion of all how perfect
 But as for me for you the irresistible sea is to separate us
 As for an hour carrying us diverse yet cannot carry us diverse forever
 Be not impatienta little spaceknow you I salute the air the
 ocean and the land
 Every day at sundown for your dear sake my love




Ages and Ages Returning at Intervals

 Ages and ages returning at intervals
 Undestroyd wandering immortal
 Lusty phallic with the potent original loins perfectly sweet
 I chanter of Adamic songs
 Through the new garden the West the great cities calling
 Deliriate thus prelude what is generated offering these offering myself
 Bathing myself bathing my songs in Sex
 Offspring of my loins




We Two How Long We Were Foold

 We two how long we were foold
 Now transmuted we swiftly escape as Nature escapes
 We are Nature long have we been absent but now we return
 We become plants trunks foliage roots bark
 We are bedded in the ground we are rocks
 We are oaks we grow in the openings side by side
 We browse we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any
 We are two fishes swimming in the sea together
 We are what locust blossoms are we drop scent around lanes mornings
 and evenings
 We are also the coarse smut of beasts vegetables minerals
 We are two predatory hawks we soar above and look down
 We are two resplendent suns we it is who balance ourselves orbic
 and stellar we are as two comets
 We prowl fangd and fourfooted in the woods we spring on prey
 We are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead
 We are seas mingling we are two of those cheerful waves rolling
 over each other and interwetting each other
 We are what the atmosphere is transparent receptive pervious impervious
 We are snow rain cold darkness we are each product and influence
 of the globe
 We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again we two
 We have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy




O Hymen O Hymenee

 O hymen O hymenee why do you tantalize me thus
 O why sting me for a swift moment only
 Why can you not continue O why do you now cease
 Is it because if you continued beyond the swift moment you would
 soon certainly kill me




I Am He That Aches with Love

 I am he that aches with amorous love
 Does the earth gravitate does not all matter aching attract all matter
 So the body of me to all I meet or know




Native Moments

 Native momentswhen you come upon meah you are here now
 Give me now libidinous joys only
 Give me the drench of my passions give me life coarse and rank
 Today I go consort with Natures darlings tonight too
 I am for those who believe in loose delights I share the midnight
 orgies of young men
 I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers
 The echoes ring with our indecent calls I pick out some low person
 for my dearest friend
 He shall be lawless rude illiterate he shall be one condemnd by
 others for deeds done
 I will play a part no longer why should I exile myself from my companions
 O you shunnd persons I at least do not shun you
 I come forthwith in your midst I will be your poet
 I will be more to you than to any of the rest




Once I Passd Through a Populous City

 Once I passd through a populous city imprinting my brain for future
 use with its shows architecture customs traditions
 Yet now of all that city I remember only a woman I casually met
 there who detaind me for love of me
 Day by day and night by night we were togetherall else has long
 been forgotten by me
 I remember I say only that woman who passionately clung to me
 Again we wander we love we separate again
 Again she holds me by the hand I must not go
 I see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous




I Heard You SolemnSweet Pipes of the Organ

 I heard you solemnsweet pipes of the organ as last Sunday morn I
 passd the church
 Winds of autumn as I walkd the woods at dusk I heard your long
 stretchd sighs up above so mournful
 I heard the perfect Italian tenor singing at the opera I heard the
 soprano in the midst of the quartet singing
 Heart of my love you too I heard murmuring low through one of the
 wrists around my head
 Heard the pulse of you when all was still ringing little bells last
 night under my ear




Facing West from Californias Shores

 Facing west from Californias shores
 Inquiring tireless seeking what is yet unfound
 I a child very old over waves towards the house of maternity
 the land of migrations look afar
 Look off the shores of my Western sea the circle almost circled
 For starting westward from Hindustan from the vales of Kashmere
 From Asia from the north from the God the sage and the hero
 From the south from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands
 Long having wanderd since round the earth having wanderd
 Now I face home again very pleasd and joyous
 But where is what I started for so long ago
 And why is it yet unfound




As Adam Early in the Morning

 As Adam early in the morning
 Walking forth from the bower refreshd with sleep
 Behold me where I pass hear my voice approach
 Touch me touch the palm of your hand to my body as I pass
 Be not afraid of my body




BOOK V CALAMUS


In Paths Untrodden

 In paths untrodden
 In the growth by margins of pondwaters
 Escaped from the life that exhibits itself
 From all the standards hitherto publishd from the pleasures
 profits conformities
 Which too long I was offering to feed my soul
 Clear to me now standards not yet publishd clear to me that my soul
 That the soul of the man I speak for rejoices in comrades
 Here by myself away from the clank of the world
 Tallying and talkd to here by tongues aromatic
 No longer abashd for in this secluded spot I can respond as I
 would not dare elsewhere
 Strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself yet contains
 all the rest
 Resolvd to sing no songs today but those of manly attachment
 Projecting them along that substantial life
 Bequeathing hence types of athletic love
 Afternoon this delicious Ninthmonth in my fortyfirst year
 I proceed for all who are or have been young men
 To tell the secret my nights and days
 To celebrate the need of comrades




Scented Herbage of My Breast

 Scented herbage of my breast
 Leaves from you I glean I write to be perused best afterwards
 Tombleaves bodyleaves growing up above me above death
 Perennial roots tall leaves O the winter shall not freeze you
 delicate leaves
 Every year shall you bloom again out from where you retired you
 shall emerge again
 O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you or inhale
 your faint odor but I believe a few will
 O slender leaves O blossoms of my blood I permit you to tell in
 your own way of the heart that is under you
 O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves you are
 not happiness
 You are often more bitter than I can bear you burn and sting me
 Yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots you make me
 think of death
 Death is beautiful from you what indeed is finally beautiful
 except death and love
 O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of lovers
 I think it must be for death
 For how calm how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere of lovers
 Death or life I am then indifferent my soul declines to prefer
 I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most
 Indeed O death I think now these leaves mean precisely the same as
 you mean
 Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see grow up out of my breast
 Spring away from the conceald heart there
 Do not fold yourself so in your pinktinged roots timid leaves
 Do not remain down there so ashamed herbage of my breast
 Come I am determind to unbare this broad breast of mine I have
 long enough stifled and choked
 Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you now you serve me not
 I will say what I have to say by itself
 I will sound myself and comrades only I will never again utter a
 call only their call
 I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States
 I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and will
 through the States
 Through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating
 Give me your tone therefore O death that I may accord with it
 Give me yourself for I see that you belong to me now above all and
 are folded inseparably together you love and death are
 Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life
 For now it is conveyd to me that you are the purports essential
 That you hide in these shifting forms of life for reasons and that
 they are mainly for you
 That you beyond them come forth to remain the real reality
 That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait no matter how long
 That you will one day perhaps take control of all
 That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance
 That maybe you are what it is all for but it does not last so very long
 But you will last very long




Whoever You Are Holding Me Now in Hand

 Whoever you are holding me now in hand
 Without one thing all will be useless
 I give you fair warning before you attempt me further
 I am not what you supposed but far different

 Who is he that would become my follower
 Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections

 The way is suspicious the result uncertain perhaps destructive
 You would have to give up all else I alone would expect to be your
 sole and exclusive standard
 Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting
 The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives
 around you would have to be abandond
 Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further let
 go your hand from my shoulders
 Put me down and depart on your way

 Or else by stealth in some wood for trial
 Or back of a rock in the open air
 For in any roofd room of a house I emerge not nor in company
 And in libraries I lie as one dumb a gawk or unborn or dead
 But just possibly with you on a high hill first watching lest any
 person for miles around approach unawares
 Or possibly with you sailing at sea or on the beach of the sea or
 some quiet island
 Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you
 With the comrades longdwelling kiss or the new husbands kiss
 For I am the new husband and I am the comrade

 Or if you will thrusting me beneath your clothing
 Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip
 Carry me when you go forth over land or sea
 For thus merely touching you is enough is best
 And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally

 But these leaves conning you con at peril
 For these leaves and me you will not understand
 They will elude you at first and still more afterward I will
 certainly elude you
 Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me behold
 Already you see I have escaped from you

 For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book
 Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it
 Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me
 Nor will the candidates for my love unless at most a very few
 prove victorious
 Nor will my poems do good only they will do just as much evil
 perhaps more
 For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times
 and not hit that which I hinted at
 Therefore release me and depart on your way




For You O Democracy

 Come I will make the continent indissoluble
 I will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon
 I will make divine magnetic lands
 With the love of comrades
 With the lifelong love of comrades

 I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of America
 and along the shores of the great lakes and all over the prairies
 I will make inseparable cities with their arms about each others necks
 By the love of comrades
 By the manly love of comrades

 For you these from me O Democracy to serve you ma femme
 For you for you I am trilling these songs




These I Singing in Spring

 These I singing in spring collect for lovers
 For who but I should understand lovers and all their sorrow and joy
 And who but I should be the poet of comrades
 Collecting I traverse the garden the world but soon I pass the gates
 Now along the pondside now wading in a little fearing not the wet
 Now by the postandrail fences where the old stones thrown there
 pickd from the fields have accumulated
 Wildflowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and
 partly cover them beyond these I pass
 Far far in the forest or sauntering later in summer before I
 think where I go
 Solitary smelling the earthy smell stopping now and then in the silence
 Alone I had thought yet soon a troop gathers around me
 Some walk by my side and some behind and some embrace my arms or neck
 They the spirits of dear friends dead or alive thicker they come a
 great crowd and I in the middle
 Collecting dispensing singing there I wander with them
 Plucking something for tokens tossing toward whoever is near me
 Here lilac with a branch of pine
 Here out of my pocket some moss which I pulld off a liveoak in
 Florida as it hung trailing down
 Here some pinks and laurel leaves and a handful of sage
 And here what I now draw from the water wading in the pondside
 O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me and returns again
 never to separate from me
 And this O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades this
 calamusroot shall
 Interchange it youths with each other let none render it back
 And twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut
 And stems of currants and plumblows and the aromatic cedar
 These I compassd around by a thick cloud of spirits
 Wandering point to or touch as I pass or throw them loosely from me
 Indicating to each one what he shall have giving something to each
 But what I drew from the water by the pondside that I reserve
 I will give of it but only to them that love as I myself am capable
 of loving




Not Heaving from My Ribbd Breast Only

 Not heaving from my ribbd breast only
 Not in sighs at night in rage dissatisfied with myself
 Not in those longdrawn illsupprest sighs
 Not in many an oath and promise broken
 Not in my wilful and savage souls volition
 Not in the subtle nourishment of the air
 Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists
 Not in the curious systole and diastole within which will one day cease
 Not in many a hungry wish told to the skies only
 Not in cries laughter defiancies thrown from me when alone far in
 the wilds
 Not in husky pantings through clinchd teeth
 Not in sounded and resounded words chattering words echoes dead words
 Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep
 Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day
 Nor in the limbs and senses of my body that take you and dismiss you
 continuallynot there
 Not in any or all of them O adhesiveness O pulse of my life
 Need I that you exist and show yourself any more than in these songs




Of the Terrible Doubt of Appearances

 Of the terrible doubt of appearances
 Of the uncertainty after all that we may be deluded
 That maybe reliance and hope are but speculations after all
 That maybe identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only
 Maybe the things I perceive the animals plants men hills
 shining and flowing waters
 The skies of day and night colors densities forms maybe these
 are as doubtless they are only apparitions and the real
 something has yet to be known
 How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and mock me
 How often I think neither I know nor any man knows aught of them
 Maybe seeming to me what they are as doubtless they indeed but seem
 as from my present point of view and might prove as of course they
 would nought of what they appear or nought anyhow from entirely
 changed points of view
 To me these and the like of these are curiously answerd by my
 lovers my dear friends
 When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding me
 by the hand
 When the subtle air the impalpable the sense that words and reason
 hold not surround us and pervade us
 Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom I am silent I
 require nothing further
 I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity
 beyond the grave
 But I walk or sit indifferent I am satisfied
 He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me




The Base of All Metaphysics

 And now gentlemen
 A word I give to remain in your memories and minds
 As base and finale too for all metaphysics

 So to the students the old professor
 At the close of his crowded course

 Having studied the new and antique the Greek and Germanic systems
 Kant having studied and stated Fichte and Schelling and Hegel
 Stated the lore of Plato and Socrates greater than Plato
 And greater than Socrates sought and stated Christ divine having
 studied long
 I see reminiscent today those Greek and Germanic systems
 See the philosophies all Christian churches and tenets see
 Yet underneath Socrates clearly see and underneath Christ the divine I see
 The dear love of man for his comrade the attraction of friend to friend
 Of the wellmarried husband and wife of children and parents
 Of city for city and land for land




Recorders Ages Hence

 Recorders ages hence
 Come I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior I
 will tell you what to say of me
 Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover
 The friend the lovers portrait of whom his friend his lover was fondest
 Who was not proud of his songs but of the measureless ocean of love
 within him and freely pourd it forth
 Who often walkd lonesome walks thinking of his dear friends his lovers
 Who pensive away from one he lovd often lay sleepless and
 dissatisfied at night
 Who knew too well the sick sick dread lest the one he lovd might
 secretly be indifferent to him
 Whose happiest days were far away through fields in woods on hills
 he and another wandering hand in hand they twain apart from other men
 Who oft as he saunterd the streets curvd with his arm the shoulder
 of his friend while the arm of his friend rested upon him also




When I Heard at the Close of the Day

 When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receivd
 with plaudits in the capitol still it was not a happy night for
 me that followd
 And else when I carousd or when my plans were accomplishd still
 I was not happy
 But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health
 refreshd singing inhaling the ripe breath of autumn
 When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the
 morning light
 When I wanderd alone over the beach and undressing bathed
 laughing with the cool waters and saw the sun rise
 And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way
 coming O then I was happy
 O then each breath tasted sweeter and all that day my food
 nourishd me more and the beautiful day passd well
 And the next came with equal joy and with the next at evening came
 my friend
 And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly
 continually up the shores
 I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me
 whispering to congratulate me
 For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in
 the cool night
 In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me
 And his arm lay lightly around my breastand that night I was happy




Are You the New Person Drawn Toward Me

 Are you the new person drawn toward me
 To begin with take warning I am surely far different from what you suppose
 Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal
 Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover
 Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloyd satisfaction
 Do you think I am trusty and faithful
 Do you see no further than this facade this smooth and tolerant
 manner of me
 Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man
 Have you no thought O dreamer that it may be all maya illusion




Roots and Leaves Themselves Alone

 Roots and leaves themselves alone are these
 Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods and pondside
 Breastsorrel and pinks of love fingers that wind around tighter
 than vines
 Gushes from the throats of birds hid in the foliage of trees as the
 sun is risen
 Breezes of land and love set from living shores to you on the living
 sea to you O sailors
 Frostmellowd berries and Thirdmonth twigs offerd fresh to young
 persons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up
 Lovebuds put before you and within you whoever you are
 Buds to be unfolded on the old terms
 If you bring the warmth of the sun to them they will open and bring
 form color perfume to you
 If you become the aliment and the wet they will become flowers
 fruits tall branches and trees




Not Heat Flames Up and Consumes

 Not heat flames up and consumes
 Not seawaves hurry in and out
 Not the air delicious and dry the air of ripe summer bears lightly
 along white downballs of myriads of seeds
 Waited sailing gracefully to drop where they may
 Not these O none of these more than the flames of me consuming
 burning for his love whom I love
 O none more than I hurrying in and out
 Does the tide hurry seeking something and never give up O I the same
 O nor downballs nor perfumes nor the high rainemitting clouds
 are borne through the open air
 Any more than my soul is borne through the open air
 Wafted in all directions O love for friendship for you




Trickle Drops

 Trickle drops my blue veins leaving
 O drops of me trickle slow drops
 Candid from me falling drip bleeding drops
 From wounds made to free you whence you were prisond
 From my face from my forehead and lips
 From my breast from within where I was conceald press forth red
 drops confession drops
 Stain every page stain every song I sing every word I say bloody drops
 Let them know your scarlet heat let them glisten
 Saturate them with yourself all ashamed and wet
 Glow upon all I have written or shall write bleeding drops
 Let it all be seen in your light blushing drops




City of Orgies

 City of orgies walks and joys
 City whom that I have lived and sung in your midst will one day make
 Not the pageants of you not your shifting tableaus your
 spectacles repay me
 Not the interminable rows of your houses nor the ships at the wharves
 Nor the processions in the streets nor the bright windows with
 goods in them
 Nor to converse with learnd persons or bear my share in the soiree
 or feast
 Not those but as I pass O Manhattan your frequent and swift flash
 of eyes offering me love
 Offering response to my ownthese repay me
 Lovers continual lovers only repay me




Behold This Swarthy Face

 Behold this swarthy face these gray eyes
 This beard the white wool unclipt upon my neck
 My brown hands and the silent manner of me without charm
 Yet comes one a Manhattanese and ever at parting kisses me lightly
 on the lips with robust love
 And I on the crossing of the street or on the ships deck give a
 kiss in return
 We observe that salute of American comrades land and sea
 We are those two natural and nonchalant persons




I Saw in Louisiana a LiveOak Growing

 I saw in Louisiana a liveoak growing
 All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches
 Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous of dark green
 And its look rude unbending lusty made me think of myself
 But I wonderd how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there
 without its friend near for I knew I could not
 And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it and
 twined around it a little moss
 And brought it away and I have placed it in sight in my room
 It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends
 For I believe lately I think of little else than of them
 Yet it remains to me a curious token it makes me think of manly love
 For all that and though the liveoak glistens there in Louisiana
 solitary in a wide in a wide flat space
 Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near
 I know very well I could not




To a Stranger

 Passing stranger you do not know how longingly I look upon you
 You must be he I was seeking or she I was seeking it comes to me
 as of a dream
 I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you
 All is recalld as we flit by each other fluid affectionate
 chaste matured
 You grew up with me were a boy with me or a girl with me
 I ate with you and slept with you your body has become not yours
 only nor left my body mine only
 You give me the pleasure of your eyes face flesh as we pass you
 take of my beard breast hands in return
 I am not to speak to you I am to think of you when I sit alone or
 wake at night alone
 I am to wait I do not doubt I am to meet you again
 I am to see to it that I do not lose you




This Moment Yearning and Thoughtful

 This moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone
 It seems to me there are other men in other lands yearning and thoughtful
 It seems to me I can look over and behold them in Germany Italy
 France Spain
 Or far far away in China or in Russia or talking other dialects
 And it seems to me if I could know those men I should become
 attached to them as I do to men in my own lands
 O I know we should be brethren and lovers
 I know I should be happy with them




I Hear It Was Charged Against Me

 I hear it was charged against me that I sought to destroy institutions
 But really I am neither for nor against institutions
 What indeed have I in common with them or what with the
 destruction of them
 Only I will establish in the Mannahatta and in every city of these
 States inland and seaboard
 And in the fields and woods and above every keel little or large
 that dents the water
 Without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument
 The institution of the dear love of comrades




The PrairieGrass Dividing

 The prairiegrass dividing its special odor breathing
 I demand of it the spiritual corresponding
 Demand the most copious and close companionship of men
 Demand the blades to rise of words acts beings
 Those of the open atmosphere coarse sunlit fresh nutritious
 Those that go their own gait erect stepping with freedom and
 command leading not following
 Those with a neverquelld audacity those with sweet and lusty
 flesh clear of taint
 Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and governors
 as to say Who are you
 Those of earthborn passion simple never constraind never obedient
 Those of inland America




When I Peruse the Conquerd Fame

 When I peruse the conquerd fame of heroes and the victories of
 mighty generals I do not envy the generals
 Nor the President in his Presidency nor the rich in his great house
 But when I hear of the brotherhood of lovers how it was with them
 How together through life through dangers odium unchanging long
 and long
 Through youth and through middle and old age how unfaltering how
 affectionate and faithful they were
 Then I am pensiveI hastily walk away filld with the bitterest envy




We Two Boys Together Clinging

 We two boys together clinging
 One the other never leaving
 Up and down the roads going North and South excursions making
 Power enjoying elbows stretching fingers clutching
 Armd and fearless eating drinking sleeping loving
 No law less than ourselves owning sailing soldiering thieving
 threatening
 Misers menials priests alarming air breathing water drinking on
 the turf or the seabeach dancing
 Cities wrenching ease scorning statutes mocking feebleness chasing
 Fulfilling our foray




A Promise to California

 A promise to California
 Or inland to the great pastoral Plains and on to Puget sound and Oregon
 Sojourning east a while longer soon I travel toward you to remain
 to teach robust American love
 For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you
 inland and along the Western sea
 For these States tend inland and toward the Western sea and I will also




Here the Frailest Leaves of Me

 Here the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting
 Here I shade and hide my thoughts I myself do not expose them
 And yet they expose me more than all my other poems




No LaborSaving Machine

 No laborsaving machine
 Nor discovery have I made
 Nor will I be able to leave behind me any wealthy bequest to found
 hospital or library
 Nor reminiscence of any deed of courage for America
 Nor literary success nor intellect nor book for the bookshelf
 But a few carols vibrating through the air I leave
 For comrades and lovers




A Glimpse

 A glimpse through an interstice caught
 Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a barroom around the stove
 late of a winter night and I unremarkd seated in a corner
 Of a youth who loves me and whom I love silently approaching and
 seating himself near that he may hold me by the hand
 A long while amid the noises of coming and going of drinking and
 oath and smutty jest
 There we two content happy in being together speaking little
 perhaps not a word




A Leaf for Hand in Hand

 A leaf for hand in hand
 You natural persons old and young
 You on the Mississippi and on all the branches and bayous of
 the Mississippi
 You friendly boatmen and mechanics you roughs
 You twain and all processions moving along the streets
 I wish to infuse myself among you till I see it common for you to
 walk hand in hand




Earth My Likeness

 Earth my likeness
 Though you look so impassive ample and spheric there
 I now suspect that is not all
 I now suspect there is something fierce in you eligible to burst forth
 For an athlete is enamourd of me and I of him
 But toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me eligible
 to burst forth
 I dare not tell it in words not even in these songs




I Dreamd in a Dream

 I dreamd in a dream I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the
 whole of the rest of the earth
 I dreamd that was the new city of Friends
 Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love it led the rest
 It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city
 And in all their looks and words




What Think You I Take My Pen in Hand

 What think you I take my pen in hand to record
 The battleship perfectmodeld majestic that I saw pass the
 offing today under full sail
 The splendors of the past day or the splendor of the night that
 envelops me
 Or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me no
 But merely of two simple men I saw today on the pier in the midst
 of the crowd parting the parting of dear friends
 The one to remain hung on the others neck and passionately kissd him
 While the one to depart tightly prest the one to remain in his arms




To the East and to the West

 To the East and to the West
 To the man of the Seaside State and of Pennsylvania
 To the Kanadian of the north to the Southerner I love
 These with perfect trust to depict you as myself the germs are in all men
 I believe the main purport of these States is to found a superb
 friendship exalte previously unknown
 Because I perceive it waits and has been always waiting latent in all men




Sometimes with One I Love

 Sometimes with one I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuse
 unreturnd love
 But now I think there is no unreturnd love the pay is certain one
 way or another
 I loved a certain person ardently and my love was not returnd
 Yet out of that I have written these songs




To a Western Boy

 Many things to absorb I teach to help you become eleve of mine
 Yet if blood like mine circle not in your veins
 If you be not silently selected by lovers and do not silently select lovers
 Of what use is it that you seek to become eleve of mine




Fast Anchord Eternal O Love

 Fastanchord eternal O love O woman I love
 O bride O wife more resistless than I can tell the thought of you
 Then separate as disembodied or another born
 Ethereal the last athletic reality my consolation
 I ascend I float in the regions of your love O man
 O sharer of my roving life




Among the Multitude

 Among the men and women the multitude
 I perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs
 Acknowledging none else not parent wife husband brother child
 any nearer than I am
 Some are baffled but that one is notthat one knows me

 Ah lover and perfect equal
 I meant that you should discover me so by faint indirections
 And I when I meet you mean to discover you by the like in you




O You Whom I Often and Silently Come

 O you whom I often and silently come where you are that I may be with you
 As I walk by your side or sit near or remain in the same room with you
 Little you know the subtle electric fire that for your sake is
 playing within me




That Shadow My Likeness

 That shadow my likeness that goes to and fro seeking a livelihood
 chattering chaffering
 How often I find myself standing and looking at it where it flits
 How often I question and doubt whether that is really me
 But among my lovers and caroling these songs
 O I never doubt whether that is really me




Full of Life Now

 Full of life now compact visible
 I forty years old the eightythird year of the States
 To one a century hence or any number of centuries hence
 To you yet unborn these seeking you

 When you read these I that was visible am become invisible
 Now it is you compact visible realizing my poems seeking me
 Fancying how happy you were if I could be with you and become your comrade
 Be it as if I were with you Be not too certain but I am now with you

 O take my hand Walt Whitman
 Such gliding wonders such sights and sounds
 Such joind unended links each hookd to the next
 Each answering all each sharing the earth with all

 What widens within you Walt Whitman

 What climes what persons and cities are here
 Who are the infants some playing some slumbering
 Who are the girls who are the married women
 Who are the groups of old men going slowly with their arms about
 each others necks
 What rivers are these what forests and fruits are these
 What are the mountains calld that rise so high in the mists
 What myriads of dwellings are they filld with dwellers

 2
 Within me latitude widens longitude lengthens
 Asia Africa Europe are to the eastAmerica is provided for in the west
 Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator
 Curiously north and south turn the axisends
 Within me is the longest day the sun wheels in slanting rings it
 does not set for months
 Stretchd in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above
 the horizon and sinks again
 Within me zones seas cataracts forests volcanoes groups
 Malaysia Polynesia and the great West Indian islands

 husky gangs pass on by twos and threes fastend together
 with wristchains and anklechains

 the Romans
 I hear the tale of the divine life and bloody death of the beautiful
 God the Christ

 adages transmitted safely to this day from poets who wrote three
 thousand years ago

 Toward you all in Americas name
 I raise high the perpendicular hand I make the signal
 To remain after me in sight forever
 For all the haunts and homes of men




BOOK VII


Song of the Open Road

 1
 Afoot and lighthearted I take to the open road
 Healthy free the world before me
 The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose

 Henceforth I ask not goodfortune I myself am goodfortune
 Henceforth I whimper no more postpone no more need nothing
 Done with indoor complaints libraries querulous criticisms
 Strong and content I travel the open road

 The earth that is sufficient
 I do not want the constellations any nearer
 I know they are very well where they are
 I know they suffice for those who belong to them

 Still here I carry my old delicious burdens
 I carry them men and women I carry them with me wherever I go
 I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them
 I am filld with them and I will fill them in return

 2
 You road I enter upon and look around I believe you are not all
 that is here
 I believe that much unseen is also here

 Here the profound lesson of reception nor preference nor denial
 The black with his woolly head the felon the diseasd the
 illiterate person are not denied
 The birth the hasting after the physician the beggars tramp the
 drunkards stagger the laughing party of mechanics
 The escaped youth the rich persons carriage the fop the eloping couple
 The early marketman the hearse the moving of furniture into the
 town the return back from the town
 They pass I also pass any thing passes none can be interdicted
 None but are accepted none but shall be dear to me

 3
 You air that serves me with breath to speak
 You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape
 You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers
 You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides
 I believe you are latent with unseen existences you are so dear to me

 You flaggd walks of the cities you strong curbs at the edges
 You ferries you planks and posts of wharves you timberlined
 side you distant ships
 You rows of houses you windowpiercd facades you roofs
 You porches and entrances you copings and iron guards
 You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much
 You doors and ascending steps you arches
 You gray stones of interminable pavements you trodden crossings
 From all that has touchd you I believe you have imparted to
 yourselves and now would impart the same secretly to me
 From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces
 and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me

 4
 The earth expanding right hand and left hand
 The picture alive every part in its best light
 The music falling in where it is wanted and stopping where it is
 not wanted
 The cheerful voice of the public road the gay fresh sentiment of the road

 O highway I travel do you say to me Do not leave me
 Do you say Venture notif you leave me you are lost
 Do you say I am already prepared I am wellbeaten and undenied
 adhere to me

 O public road I say back I am not afraid to leave you yet I love you
 You express me better than I can express myself
 You shall be more to me than my poem

 I think heroic deeds were all conceivd in the open air and all
 free poems also
 I think I could stop here myself and do miracles
 I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like and whoever
 beholds me shall like me
 I think whoever I see must be happy

 5
 From this hour I ordain myself loosd of limits and imaginary lines
 Going where I list my own master total and absolute
 Listening to others considering well what they say
 Pausing searching receiving contemplating
 Gently but with undeniable will divesting myself of the holds that
 would hold me

 I inhale great draughts of space
 The east and the west are mine and the north and the south are mine

 I am larger better than I thought
 I did not know I held so much goodness

 All seems beautiful to me
 can repeat over to men and women You have done such good to me
 I would do the same to you
 I will recruit for myself and you as I go
 I will scatter myself among men and women as I go
 I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them
 Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me
 Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me

 6
 Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me
 Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appeard it would not
 astonish me

 Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons
 It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth

 Here a great personal deed has room
 Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men
 Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all
 authority and all argument against it

 Here is the test of wisdom
 Wisdom is not finally tested in schools
 Wisdom cannot be passd from one having it to another not having it
 Wisdom is of the soul is not susceptible of proof is its own proof
 Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content
 Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things and the
 excellence of things
 Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes
 it out of the soul

 Now I reexamine philosophies and religions
 They may prove well in lecturerooms yet not prove at all under the
 spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents

 Here is realization
 Here is a man talliedhe realizes here what he has in him
 The past the future majesty loveif they are vacant of you you
 are vacant of them

 Only the kernel of every object nourishes
 Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me
 Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me

 Here is adhesiveness it is not previously fashiond it is apropos
 Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers
 Do you know the talk of those turning eyeballs

 7
 Here is the efflux of the soul
 The efflux of the soul comes from within through embowerd gates
 ever provoking questions
 These yearnings why are they these thoughts in the darkness why are they
 Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight
 expands my blood
 Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank
 Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious
 thoughts descend upon me
 I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always
 drop fruit as I pass
 What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers
 What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side
 What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by
 and pause
 What gives me to be free to a womans and mans goodwill what
 gives them to be free to mine

 8
 The efflux of the soul is happiness here is happiness
 I think it pervades the open air waiting at all times
 Now it flows unto us we are rightly charged

 Here rises the fluid and attaching character
 The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of
 man and woman
 The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day
 out of the roots of themselves than it sprouts fresh and sweet
 continually out of itself

 Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the
 love of young and old
 From it falls distilld the charm that mocks beauty and attainments
 Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact

 9
 Allons whoever you are come travel with me
 Traveling with me you find what never tires

 The earth never tires
 The earth is rude silent incomprehensible at first Nature is rude
 and incomprehensible at first
 Be not discouraged keep on there are divine things well envelopd
 I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell

 Allons we must not stop here
 However sweet these laidup stores however convenient this dwelling
 we cannot remain here
 However shelterd this port and however calm these waters we must
 not anchor here
 However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are permitted
 to receive it but a little while

 10
 Allons the inducements shall be greater
 We will sail pathless and wild seas
 We will go where winds blow waves dash and the Yankee clipper
 speeds by under full sail

 Allons with power liberty the earth the elements
 Health defiance gayety selfesteem curiosity
 Allons from all formules
 From your formules O bateyed and materialistic priests

 The stale cadaver blocks up the passagethe burial waits no longer

 Allons yet take warning
 He traveling with me needs the best blood thews endurance
 None may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and health
 Come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself
 Only those may come who come in sweet and determind bodies
 No diseasd person no rumdrinker or venereal taint is permitted here

 I and mine do not convince by arguments similes rhymes
 We convince by our presence

 11
 Listen I will be honest with you
 I do not offer the old smooth prizes but offer rough new prizes
 These are the days that must happen to you
 You shall not heap up what is calld riches
 You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve
 You but arrive at the city to which you were destind you hardly
 settle yourself to satisfaction before you are calld by an
 irresistible call to depart
 You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those
 who remain behind you
 What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with
 passionate kisses of parting
 You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reachd hands
 toward you

 12
 Allons after the great Companions and to belong to them
 They too are on the roadthey are the swift and majestic menthey
 are the greatest women
 Enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas
 Sailors of many a ship walkers of many a mile of land
 Habitues of many distant countries habitues of fardistant dwellings
 Trusters of men and women observers of cities solitary toilers
 Pausers and contemplators of tufts blossoms shells of the shore
 Dancers at weddingdances kissers of brides tender helpers of
 children bearers of children
 Soldiers of revolts standers by gaping graves lowerersdown of coffins
 Journeyers over consecutive seasons over the years the curious
 years each emerging from that which preceded it
 Journeyers as with companions namely their own diverse phases
 Forthsteppers from the latent unrealized babydays
 Journeyers gayly with their own youth journeyers with their bearded
 and wellgraind manhood
 Journeyers with their womanhood ample unsurpassd content
 Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood
 Old age calm expanded broad with the haughty breadth of the universe
 Old age flowing free with the delicious nearby freedom of death

 13
 Allons to that which is endless as it was beginningless
 To undergo much tramps of days rests of nights
 To merge all in the travel they tend to and the days and nights
 they tend to
 Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys
 To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it
 To conceive no time however distant but what you may reach it and pass it
 To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you
 however long but it stretches and waits for you
 To see no being not Gods or any but you also go thither
 To see no possession but you may possess it enjoying all without
 labor or purchase abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one
 particle of it
 To take the best of the farmers farm and the rich mans elegant
 villa and the chaste blessings of the wellmarried couple and
 the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens
 To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through
 To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go
 To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter
 them to gather the love out of their hearts
 To take your lovers on the road with you for all that you leave
 them behind you
 To know the universe itself as a road as many roads as roads for
 traveling souls

 All parts away for the progress of souls
 All religion all solid things arts governmentsall that was or is
 apparent upon this globe or any globe falls into niches and corners
 before the procession of souls along the grand roads of the universe

 Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of
 the universe all other progress is the needed emblem and sustenance

 Forever alive forever forward
 Stately solemn sad withdrawn baffled mad turbulent feeble
 dissatisfied
 Desperate proud fond sick accepted by men rejected by men
 They go they go I know that they go but I know not where they go
 But I know that they go toward the besttoward something great

 Whoever you are come forth or man or woman come forth
 You must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house though
 you built it or though it has been built for you

 Out of the dark confinement out from behind the screen
 It is useless to protest I know all and expose it

 Behold through you as bad as the rest
 Through the laughter dancing dining supping of people
 Inside of dresses and ornaments inside of those washd and trimmd faces
 Behold a secret silent loathing and despair

 No husband no wife no friend trusted to hear the confession
 Another self a duplicate of every one skulking and hiding it goes
 Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities polite and
 bland in the parlors
 In the cars of railroads in steamboats in the public assembly
 Home to the houses of men and women at the table in the bedroom
 everywhere
 Smartly attired countenance smiling form upright death under the
 breastbones hell under the skullbones
 Under the broadcloth and gloves under the ribbons and artificial flowers
 Keeping fair with the customs speaking not a syllable of itself
 Speaking of any thing else but never of itself

 14
 Allons through struggles and wars
 The goal that was named cannot be countermanded

 Have the past struggles succeeded
 What has succeeded yourself your nation Nature
 Now understand me wellit is provided in the essence of things that
 from any fruition of success no matter what shall come forth
 something to make a greater struggle necessary

 My call is the call of battle I nourish active rebellion
 He going with me must go well armd
 He going with me goes often with spare diet poverty angry enemies
 desertions

 15
 Allons the road is before us
 It is safeI have tried itmy own feet have tried it wellbe not
 detaind
 Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten and the book on the
 shelf unopend
 Let the tools remain in the workshop let the money remain unearnd
 Let the school stand mind not the cry of the teacher
 Let the preacher preach in his pulpit let the lawyer plead in the
 court and the judge expound the law

 Camerado I give you my hand
 I give you my love more precious than money
 I give you myself before preaching or law
 Will you give me yourself will you come travel with me
 Shall we stick by each other as long as we live




BOOK VIII


Crossing Brooklyn Ferry

 1
 Floodtide below me I see you face to face
 Clouds of the westsun there half an hour highI see you also face
 to face

 Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes how curious
 you are to me
 On the ferryboats the hundreds and hundreds that cross returning
 home are more curious to me than you suppose
 And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more
 to me and more in my meditations than you might suppose

 2
 The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day
 The simple compact welljoind scheme myself disintegrated every
 one disintegrated yet part of the scheme
 The similitudes of the past and those of the future
 The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings on
 the walk in the street and the passage over the river
 The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away
 The others that are to follow me the ties between me and them
 The certainty of others the life love sight hearing of others

 Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore
 Others will watch the run of the floodtide
 Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west and the
 heights of Brooklyn to the south and east
 Others will see the islands large and small
 Fifty years hence others will see them as they cross the sun half
 an hour high
 A hundred years hence or ever so many hundred years hence others
 will see them
 Will enjoy the sunset the pouringin of the floodtide the
 fallingback to the sea of the ebbtide

 3
 It avails not time nor placedistance avails not
 I am with you you men and women of a generation or ever so many
 generations hence
 Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky so I felt
 Just as any of you is one of a living crowd I was one of a crowd
 Just as you are refreshd by the gladness of the river and the
 bright flow I was refreshd
 Just as you stand and lean on the rail yet hurry with the swift
 current I stood yet was hurried
 Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the
 thickstemmd pipes of steamboats I lookd

 I too many and many a time crossd the river of old
 Watched the Twelfthmonth seagulls saw them high in the air
 floating with motionless wings oscillating their bodies
 Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left
 the rest in strong shadow
 Saw the slowwheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south
 Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water
 Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams
 Lookd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my
 head in the sunlit water
 Lookd on the haze on the hills southward and southwestward
 Lookd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet
 Lookd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving
 Saw their approach saw aboard those that were near me
 Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops saw the ships at anchor
 The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars
 The round masts the swinging motion of the hulls the slender
 serpentine pennants
 The large and small steamers in motion the pilots in their pilothouses
 The white wake left by the passage the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels
 The flags of all nations the falling of them at sunset
 The scallopedged waves in the twilight the ladled cups the
 frolicsome crests and glistening
 The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer the gray walls of the
 granite storehouses by the docks
 On the river the shadowy group the big steamtug closely flankd on
 each side by the barges the hayboat the belated lighter
 On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning
 high and glaringly into the night
 Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow
 light over the tops of houses and down into the clefts of streets

 4
 These and all else were to me the same as they are to you
 I loved well those cities loved well the stately and rapid river
 The men and women I saw were all near to me
 Others the sameothers who look back on me because I lookd forward
 to them
 The time will come though I stop here today and tonight

 5
 What is it then between us
 What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us

 Whatever it is it avails notdistance avails not and place avails not
 I too lived Brooklyn of ample hills was mine
 I too walkd the streets of Manhattan island and bathed in the
 waters around it
 I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me
 In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me
 In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me
 I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution
 I too had receivd identity by my body
 That I was I knew was of my body and what I should be I knew I
 should be of my body

 6
 It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall
 The dark threw its patches down upon me also
 The best I had done seemd to me blank and suspicious
 My great thoughts as I supposed them were they not in reality meagre
 Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil
 I am he who knew what it was to be evil
 I too knitted the old knot of contrariety
 Blabbd blushd resented lied stole grudgd
 Had guile anger lust hot wishes I dared not speak
 Was wayward vain greedy shallow sly cowardly malignant
 The wolf the snake the hog not wanting in me
 The cheating look the frivolous word the adulterous wish not wanting

 Refusals hates postponements meanness laziness none of these wanting
 Was one with the rest the days and haps of the rest
 Was calld by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as
 they saw me approaching or passing
 Felt their arms on my neck as I stood or the negligent leaning of
 their flesh against me as I sat
 Saw many I loved in the street or ferryboat or public assembly yet
 never told them a word
 Lived the same life with the rest the same old laughing gnawing sleeping
 Playd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress
 The same old role the role that is what we make it as great as we like
 Or as small as we like or both great and small

 7
 Closer yet I approach you
 What thought you have of me now I had as much of youI laid in my
 stores in advance
 I considerd long and seriously of you before you were born

 Who was to know what should come home to me
 Who knows but I am enjoying this
 Who knows for all the distance but I am as good as looking at you
 now for all you cannot see me

 8
 Ah what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than
 masthemmd Manhattan
 River and sunset and scallopedgd waves of floodtide
 The seagulls oscillating their bodies the hayboat in the
 twilight and the belated lighter
 What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand and with voices I
 love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach
 What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that
 looks in my face
 Which fuses me into you now and pours my meaning into you

 We understand then do we not
 What I promisd without mentioning it have you not accepted
 What the study could not teachwhat the preaching could not
 accomplish is accomplishd is it not

 9
 Flow on river flow with the floodtide and ebb with the ebbtide
 Frolic on crested and scallopedgd waves
 Gorgeous clouds of the sunset drench with your splendor me or the
 men and women generations after me
 Cross from shore to shore countless crowds of passengers
 Stand up tall masts of Mannahatta stand up beautiful hills of Brooklyn
 Throb baffled and curious brain throw out questions and answers
 Suspend here and everywhere eternal float of solution
 Gaze loving and thirsting eyes in the house or street or public assembly
 Sound out voices of young men loudly and musically call me by my
 nighest name
 Live old life play the part that looks back on the actor or actress
 Play the old role the role that is great or small according as one
 makes it
 Consider you who peruse me whether I may not in unknown ways be
 looking upon you
 Be firm rail over the river to support those who lean idly yet
 haste with the hasting current
 Fly on seabirds fly sideways or wheel in large circles high in the air
 Receive the summer sky you water and faithfully hold it till all
 downcast eyes have time to take it from you
 Diverge fine spokes of light from the shape of my head or any
 ones head in the sunlit water
 Come on ships from the lower bay pass up or down whitesaild
 schooners sloops lighters
 Flaunt away flags of all nations be duly lowerd at sunset
 Burn high your fires foundry chimneys cast black shadows at
 nightfall cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses
 Appearances now or henceforth indicate what you are
 You necessary film continue to envelop the soul
 About my body for me and your body for you be hung our divinest aromas
 Thrive citiesbring your freight bring your shows ample and
 sufficient rivers
 Expand being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual
 Keep your places objects than which none else is more lasting

 You have waited you always wait you dumb beautiful ministers
 We receive you with free sense at last and are insatiate henceforward
 Not you any more shall be able to foil us or withhold yourselves from us
 We use you and do not cast you asidewe plant you permanently within us
 We fathom you notwe love youthere is perfection in you also
 You furnish your parts toward eternity
 Great or small you furnish your parts toward the soul




BOOK IX


Song of the Answerer

 1
 Now list to my mornings romanza I tell the signs of the Answerer
 To the cities and farms I sing as they spread in the sunshine before me

 A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother
 How shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother
 Tell him to send me the signs And I stand before the young man
 face to face and take his right hand in my left hand and his
 left hand in my right hand
 And I answer for his brother and for men and I answer for him that
 answers for all and send these signs

 Him all wait for him all yield up to his word is decisive and final
 Him they accept in him lave in him perceive themselves as amid light
 Him they immerse and he immerses them

 Beautiful women the haughtiest nations laws the landscape
 people animals
 The profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean so
 tell I my mornings romanza
 All enjoyments and properties and money and whatever money will buy
 The best farms others toiling and planting and he unavoidably reaps
 The noblest and costliest cities others grading and building and he
 domiciles there
 Nothing for any one but what is for him near and far are for him
 the ships in the offing
 The perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they are for anybody

 He puts things in their attitudes
 He puts today out of himself with plasticity and love
 He places his own times reminiscences parents brothers and
 sisters associations employment politics so that the rest
 never shame them afterward nor assume to command them

 He is the Answerer
 What can be answerd he answers and what cannot be answerd he
 shows how it cannot be answerd

 A man is a summons and challenge
 It is vain to skulkdo you hear that mocking and laughter do you
 hear the ironical echoes

 Books friendships philosophers priests action pleasure pride
 beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction
 He indicates the satisfaction and indicates them that beat up and
 down also

 Whichever the sex whatever the season or place he may go freshly
 and gently and safely by day or by night
 He has the passkey of hearts to him the response of the prying of
 hands on the knobs

 His welcome is universal the flow of beauty is not more welcome or
 universal than he is
 The person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed

 Every existence has its idiom every thing has an idiom and tongue
 He resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men and
 any man translates and any man translates himself also
 One part does not counteract another part he is the joiner he sees
 how they join

 He says indifferently and alike How are you friend to the President
 at his levee
 And he says Goodday my brother to Cudge that hoes in the sugarfield
 And both understand him and know that his speech is right

 He walks with perfect ease in the capitol
 He walks among the Congress and one Representative says to another
 Here is our equal appearing and new

 Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic
 And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier and the sailors that
 he has followd the sea
 And the authors take him for an author and the artists for an artist
 And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them
 No matter what the work is that he is the one to follow it or has
 followd it
 No matter what the nation that he might find his brothers and
 sisters there

 The English believe he comes of their English stock
 A Jew to the Jew he seems a Russ to the Russ usual and near
 removed from none

 Whoever he looks at in the travelers coffeehouse claims him
 The Italian or Frenchman is sure the German is sure the Spaniard
 is sure and the island Cuban is sure
 The engineer the deckhand on the great lakes or on the Mississippi
 or St Lawrence or Sacramento or Hudson or Paumanok sound claims him

 The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood
 The insulter the prostitute the angry person the beggar see
 themselves in the ways of him he strangely transmutes them
 They are not vile any more they hardly know themselves they are so grown

 2
 The indications and tally of time
 Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs
 Time always without break indicates itself in parts
 What always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company
 of singers and their words
 The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark
 but the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark
 The maker of poems settles justice reality immortality
 His insight and power encircle things and the human race
 He is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race

 The singers do not beget only the Poet begets
 The singers are welcomd understood appear often enough but rare
 has the day been likewise the spot of the birth of the maker
 of poems the Answerer
 Not every century nor every five centuries has containd such a
 day for all its names

 The singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible
 names but the name of each of them is one of the singers
 The name of each is eyesinger earsinger headsinger
 sweetsinger nightsinger parlorsinger lovesinger
 weirdsinger or something else

 All this time and at all times wait the words of true poems
 The words of true poems do not merely please
 The true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty
 The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers
 and fathers
 The words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science

 Divine instinct breadth of vision the law of reason health
 rudeness of body withdrawnness
 Gayety suntan airsweetness such are some of the words of poems

 The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems the Answerer
 The builder geometer chemist anatomist phrenologist artist all
 these underlie the maker of poems the Answerer

 The words of the true poems give you more than poems
 They give you to form for yourself poems religions politics war
 peace behavior histories essays daily life and every thing else
 They balance ranks colors races creeds and the sexes
 They do not seek beauty they are sought
 Forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty longing
 fain lovesick

 They prepare for death yet are they not the finish but rather the outset
 They bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full
 Whom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars to
 learn one of the meanings
 To launch off with absolute faith to sweep through the ceaseless
 rings and never be quiet again

 How can I but as here chanting invite you for yourself to collect
 bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of these States




BOOK XI


A Song of Joys

 O to make the most jubilant song
 Full of musicfull of manhood womanhood infancy
 Full of common employmentsfull of grain and trees

 O for the voices of animalsO for the swiftness and balance of fishes
 O for the dropping of raindrops in a song
 O for the sunshine and motion of waves in a song

 O the joy of my spiritit is uncagedit darts like lightning
 It is not enough to have this globe or a certain time
 I will have thousands of globes and all time

 O the engineers joys to go with a locomotive
 To hear the hiss of steam the merry shriek the steamwhistle the
 laughing locomotive
 To push with resistless way and speed off in the distance

 O the gleesome saunter over fields and hillsides
 The leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds the moist fresh
 stillness of the woods
 The exquisite smell of the earth at daybreak and all through the forenoon

 O the horsemans and horsewomans joys
 The saddle the gallop the pressure upon the seat the cool
 gurgling by the ears and hair

 O the firemans joys
 I hear the alarm at dead of night
 I hear bells shouts I pass the crowd I run
 The sight of the flames maddens me with pleasure

 O the joy of the strongbrawnd fighter towering in the arena in
 perfect condition conscious of power thirsting to meet his opponent

 O the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the human soul is
 capable of generating and emitting in steady and limitless floods

 O the mothers joys
 The watching the endurance the precious love the anguish the
 patiently yielded life

 O the of increase growth recuperation
 The joy of soothing and pacifying the joy of concord and harmony

 O to go back to the place where I was born
 To hear the birds sing once more
 To ramble about the house and barn and over the fields once more
 And through the orchard and along the old lanes once more

 O to have been brought up on bays lagoons creeks or along the coast
 To continue and be employd there all my life
 The briny and damp smell the shore the salt weeds exposed at low water
 The work of fishermen the work of the eelfisher and clamfisher
 I come with my clamrake and spade I come with my eelspear
 Is the tide out I Join the group of clamdiggers on the flats
 I laugh and work with them I joke at my work like a mettlesome young man
 In winter I take my eelbasket and eelspear and travel out on foot
 on the iceI have a small axe to cut holes in the ice
 Behold me wellclothed going gayly or returning in the afternoon
 my brood of tough boys accompanying me
 My brood of grown and partgrown boys who love to be with no
 one else so well as they love to be with me
 By day to work with me and by night to sleep with me

 Another time in warm weather out in a boat to lift the lobsterpots
 where they are sunk with heavy stones I know the buoys
 O the sweetness of the Fifthmonth morning upon the water as I row
 just before sunrise toward the buoys
 I pull the wicker pots up slantingly the dark green lobsters are
 desperate with their claws as I take them out I insert
 wooden pegs in the oints of their pincers

 I go to all the places one after another and then row back to the shore
 There in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters shall be boild
 till their color becomes scarlet

 Another time mackereltaking
 Voracious mad for the hook near the surface they seem to fill the
 water for miles
 Another time fishing for rockfish in Chesapeake bay I one of the
 brownfaced crew
 Another time trailing for bluefish off Paumanok I stand with braced body
 My left foot is on the gunwale my right arm throws far out the
 coils of slender rope
 In sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs my
 companions

 O boating on the rivers
 The voyage down the St Lawrence the superb scenery the steamers
 The ships sailing the Thousand Islands the occasional timberraft
 and the raftsmen with longreaching sweepoars
 The little huts on the rafts and the stream of smoke when they cook
 supper at evening

 O something pernicious and dread
 Something far away from a puny and pious life
 Something unproved something in a trance
 Something escaped from the anchorage and driving free

 O to work in mines or forging iron
 Foundry casting the foundry itself the rude high roof the ample
 and shadowd space
 The furnace the hot liquid pourd out and running

 O to resume the joys of the soldier
 To feel the presence of a brave commanding officerto feel his sympathy
 To behold his calmnessto be warmd in the rays of his smile
 To go to battleto hear the bugles play and the drums beat
 To hear the crash of artilleryto see the glittering of the bayonets
 and musketbarrels in the sun

 To see men fall and die and not complain
 To taste the savage taste of bloodto be so devilish
 To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy

 O the whalemans joys O I cruise my old cruise again
 I feel the ships motion under me I feel the Atlantic breezes fanning me
 I hear the cry again sent down from the masthead Thereshe blows
 Again I spring up the rigging to look with the restwe descend
 wild with excitement
 I leap in the lowerd boat we row toward our prey where he lies
 We approach stealthy and silent I see the mountainous mass
 lethargic basking
 I see the harpooneer standing up I see the weapon dart from his
 vigorous arm
 O swift again far out in the ocean the wounded whale settling
 running to windward tows me
 Again I see him rise to breathe we row close again
 I see a lance driven through his side pressd deep turnd in the wound
 Again we back off I see him settle again the life is leaving him fast
 As he rises he spouts blood I see him swim in circles narrower and
 narrower swiftly cutting the waterI see him die
 He gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle and then
 falls flat and still in the bloody foam

 O the old manhood of me my noblest joy of all
 My children and grandchildren my white hair and beard
 My largeness calmness majesty out of the long stretch of my life

 O ripend joy of womanhood O happiness at last
 I am more than eighty years of age I am the most venerable mother
 How clear is my mindhow all people draw nigh to me
 What attractions are these beyond any before what bloom more
 than the bloom of youth
 What beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me

 O the orators joys
 To inflate the chest to roll the thunder of the voice out from the
 ribs and throat
 To make the people rage weep hate desire with yourself
 To lead Americato quell America with a great tongue

 O the joy of my soul leaning poisd on itself receiving identity through
 materials and loving them observing characters and absorbing them
 My soul vibrated back to me from them from sight hearing touch
 reason articulation comparison memory and the like
 The real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and flesh
 My body done with materials my sight done with my material eyes
 Proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyes
 which finally see
 Nor my material body which finally loves walks laughs shouts
 embraces procreates

 O the farmers joys
 Ohioans Illinoisians Wisconsinese Kanadians Iowans
 Kansians Missourians Oregonese joys
 To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work
 To plough land in the fall for wintersown crops
 To plough land in the spring for maize
 To train orchards to graft the trees to gather apples in the fall

 O to bathe in the swimmingbath or in a good place along shore
 To splash the water to walk ankledeep or race naked along the shore

 O to realize space
 The plenteousness of all that there are no bounds
 To emerge and be of the sky of the sun and moon and flying
 clouds as one with them

 O the joy a manly selfhood
 To be servile to none to defer to none not to any tyrant known or unknown
 To walk with erect carriage a step springy and elastic
 To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye
 To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest
 To confront with your personality all the other personalities of the earth

 Knowist thou the excellent joys of youth
 Joys of the dear companions and of the merry word and laughing face
 Joy of the glad lightbeaming day joy of the widebreathd games
 Joy of sweet music joy of the lighted ballroom and the dancers
 Joy of the plenteous dinner strong carouse and drinking

 Yet O my soul supreme
 Knowist thou the joys of pensive thought
 Joys of the free and lonesome heart the tender gloomy heart
 Joys of the solitary walk the spirit bowd yet proud the suffering
 and the struggle
 The agonistic throes the ecstasies joys of the solemn musings day
 or night
 Joys of the thought of Death the great spheres Time and Space
 Prophetic joys of better loftier loves ideals the divine wife
 the sweet eternal perfect comrade
 Joys all thine own undying one joys worthy thee O soul

 O while I live to be the ruler of life not a slave
 To meet life as a powerful conqueror
 No fumes no ennui no more complaints or scornful criticisms
 To these proud laws of the air the water and the ground proving
 my interior soul impregnable
 And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me

 For not lifes joys alone I sing repeatingthe joy of death
 The beautiful touch of Death soothing and benumbing a few moments
 for reasons
 Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burnd or renderd
 to powder or buried
 My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres
 My voided body nothing more to me returning to the purifications
 further offices eternal uses of the earth

 O to attract by more than attraction
 How it is I know notyet behold the something which obeys none
 of the rest
 It is offensive never defensiveyet how magnetic it draws

 O to struggle against great odds to meet enemies undaunted
 To be entirely alone with them to find how much one can stand
 To look strife torture prison popular odium face to face
 To mount the scaffold to advance to the muzzles of guns with
 perfect nonchalance
 To be indeed a God

 O to sail to sea in a ship
 To leave this steady unendurable land
 To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets the sidewalks and the
 houses
 To leave you O you solid motionless land and entering a ship
 To sail and sail and sail

 O to have life henceforth a poem of new joys
 To dance clap hands exult shout skip leap roll on float on
 To be a sailor of the world bound for all ports
 A ship itself see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air
 A swift and swelling ship full of rich words full of joys




BOOK XII


Song of the BroadAxe

 1
 Weapon shapely naked wan
 Head from the mothers bowels drawn
 Wooded flesh and metal bone limb only one and lip only one
 Grayblue leaf by redheat grown helve produced from a little seed sown
 Resting the grass amid and upon
 To be leand and to lean on

 Strong shapes and attributes of strong shapes masculine trades
 sights and sounds
 Long varied train of an emblem dabs of music
 Fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of the great organ

 2
 Welcome are all earths lands each for its kind
 Welcome are lands of pine and oak
 Welcome are lands of the lemon and fig
 Welcome are lands of gold
 Welcome are lands of wheat and maize welcome those of the grape
 Welcome are lands of sugar and rice
 Welcome the cottonlands welcome those of the white potato and
 sweet potato
 Welcome are mountains flats sands forests prairies
 Welcome the rich borders of rivers tablelands openings
 Welcome the measureless grazinglands welcome the teeming soil of
 orchards flax honey hemp
 Welcome just as much the other more hardfaced lands
 Lands rich as lands of gold or wheat and fruit lands
 Lands of mines lands of the manly and rugged ores
 Lands of coal copper lead tin zinc
 Lands of ironlands of the make of the axe

 3
 The log at the woodpile the axe supported by it
 The sylvan hut the vine over the doorway the space cleard for garden
 The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves after the storm is lulld
 The walling and moaning at intervals the thought of the sea
 The thought of ships struck in the storm and put on their beam ends
 and the cutting away of masts
 The sentiment of the huge timbers of oldfashiond houses and barns
 The rememberd print or narrative the voyage at a venture of men
 families goods
 The disembarkation the founding of a new city
 The voyage of those who sought a New England and found it the outset
 anywhere
 The settlements of the Arkansas Colorado Ottawa Willamette
 The slow progress the scant fare the axe rifle saddlebags
 The beauty of all adventurous and daring persons
 The beauty of woodboys and woodmen with their clear untrimmd faces
 The beauty of independence departure actions that rely on themselves
 The American contempt for statutes and ceremonies the boundless
 impatience of restraint
 The loose drift of character the inkling through random types the
 solidification
 The butcher in the slaughterhouse the hands aboard schooners and
 sloops the raftsman the pioneer
 Lumbermen in their winter camp daybreak in the woods stripes of
 snow on the limbs of trees the occasional snapping
 The glad clear sound of ones own voice the merry song the natural
 life of the woods the strong days work
 The blazing fire at night the sweet taste of supper the talk the
 bed of hemlockboughs and the bearskin
 The housebuilder at work in cities or anywhere
 The preparatory jointing squaring sawing mortising
 The hoistup of beams the push of them in their places laying them
 regular
 Setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises according as they
 were prepared
 The blows of mallets and hammers the attitudes of the men their
 curvd limbs
 Bending standing astride the beams driving in pins holding on by
 posts and braces
 The hookd arm over the plate the other arm wielding the axe
 The floormen forcing the planks close to be naild
 Their postures bringing their weapons downward on the bearers
 The echoes resounding through the vacant building
 The huge storehouse carried up in the city well under way
 The six framingmen two in the middle and two at each end carefully
 bearing on their shoulders a heavy stick for a crossbeam
 The crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands rapidly
 laying the long sidewall two hundred feet from front to rear
 The flexible rise and fall of backs the continual click of the
 trowels striking the bricks
 The bricks one after another each laid so workmanlike in its place
 and set with a knock of the trowelhandle
 The piles of materials the mortar on the mortarboards and the
 steady replenishing by the hodmen
 Sparmakers in the sparyard the swarming row of wellgrown apprentices
 The swing of their axes on the squarehewd log shaping it toward
 the shape of a mast
 The brisk short crackle of the steel driven slantingly into the pine
 The buttercolord chips flying off in great flakes and slivers
 The limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy costumes
 The constructor of wharves bridges piers bulkheads floats
 stays against the sea
 The city fireman the fire that suddenly bursts forth in the
 closepackd square
 The arriving engines the hoarse shouts the nimble stepping and daring
 The strong command through the firetrumpets the falling in line
 the rise and fall of the arms forcing the water
 The slender spasmic bluewhite jets the bringing to bear of the
 hooks and ladders and their execution
 The crash and cut away of connecting woodwork or through floors
 if the fire smoulders under them
 The crowd with their lit faces watching the glare and dense shadows
 The forger at his forgefurnace and the user of iron after him
 The maker of the axe large and small and the welder and temperer
 The chooser breathing his breath on the cold steel and trying the
 edge with his thumb
 The one who cleanshapes the handle and sets it firmly in the socket
 The shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also
 The primal patient mechanics the architects and engineers
 The faroff Assyrian edifice and Mizra edifice
 The Roman lictors preceding the consuls
 The antique European warrior with his axe in combat
 The uplifted arm the clatter of blows on the helmeted head
 The deathhowl the limpsy tumbling body the rush of friend and foe
 thither
 The siege of revolted lieges determind for liberty
 The summons to surrender the battering at castle gates the truce
 and parley
 The sack of an old city in its time
 The bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and disorderly
 Roar flames blood drunkenness madness
 Goods freely rifled from houses and temples screams of women in the
 gripe of brigands
 Craft and thievery of campfollowers men running old persons despairing
 The hell of war the cruelties of creeds
 The list of all executive deeds and words just or unjust
 The power of personality just or unjust

 4
 Muscle and pluck forever
 What invigorates life invigorates death
 And the dead advance as much as the living advance
 And the future is no more uncertain than the present
 For the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as much as the
 delicatesse of the earth and of man
 And nothing endures but personal qualities

 What do you think endures
 Do you think a great city endures
 Or a teeming manufacturing state or a prepared constitution or the
 best built steamships
 Or hotels of granite and iron or any chefdoeuvres of engineering
 forts armaments

 Away these are not to be cherishd for themselves
 They fill their hour the dancers dance the musicians play for them
 The show passes all does well enough of course
 All does very well till one flash of defiance

 A great city is that which has the greatest men and women
 If it be a few ragged huts it is still the greatest city in the
 whole world

 5
 The place where a great city stands is not the place of stretchd
 wharves docks manufactures deposits of produce merely
 Nor the place of ceaseless salutes of newcomers or the
 anchorlifters of the departing
 Nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings or shops
 selling goods from the rest of the earth
 Nor the place of the best libraries and schools nor the place where
 money is plentiest
 Nor the place of the most numerous population

 Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards
 Where the city stands that is belovd by these and loves them in
 return and understands them
 Where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common words and deeds
 Where thrift is in its place and prudence is in its place
 Where the men and women think lightly of the laws
 Where the slave ceases and the master of slaves ceases
 Where the populace rise at once against the neverending audacity of
 elected persons
 Where fierce men and women pour forth as the sea to the whistle of
 death pours its sweeping and unript waves
 Where outside authority enters always after the precedence of inside
 authority
 Where the citizen is always the head and ideal and President
 Mayor Governor and what not are agents for pay
 Where children are taught to be laws to themselves and to depend on
 themselves
 Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs
 Where speculations on the soul are encouraged
 Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same as the men
 Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men
 Where the city of the faithfulest friends stands
 Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands
 Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands
 Where the city of the bestbodied mothers stands
 There the great city stands

 6
 How beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed
 How the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a
 mans or womans look

 All waits or goes by default till a strong being appears
 A strong being is the proof of the race and of the ability of the universe
 When he or she appears materials are overawd
 The dispute on the soul stops
 The old customs and phrases are confronted turnd back or laid away

 What is your moneymaking now what can it do now
 What is your respectability now
 What are your theology tuition society traditions statutebooks now
 Where are your jibes of being now
 Where are your cavils about the soul now

 7
 A sterile landscape covers the ore there is as good as the best for
 all the forbidding appearance
 There is the mine there are the miners
 The forgefurnace is there the melt is accomplishd the hammersmen
 are at hand with their tongs and hammers
 What always served and always serves is at hand

 Than this nothing has better served it has served all
 Served the fluenttongued and subtlesensed Greek and long ere the Greek
 Served in building the buildings that last longer than any
 Served the Hebrew the Persian the most ancient Hindustanee
 Served the moundraiser on the Mississippi served those whose
 relics remain in Central America
 Served Albic temples in woods or on plains with unhewn pillars and
 the druids
 Served the artificial clefts vast high silent on the
 snowcoverd hills of Scandinavia
 Served those who time out of mind made on the granite walls rough
 sketches of the sun moon stars ships ocean waves
 Served the paths of the irruptions of the Goths served the pastoral
 tribes and nomads
 Served the long distant Kelt served the hardy pirates of the Baltic
 Served before any of those the venerable and harmless men of Ethiopia
 Served the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure and the
 making of those for war
 Served all great works on land and all great works on the sea
 For the mediaeval ages and before the mediaeval ages
 Served not the living only then as now but served the dead

 8
 I see the European headsman
 He stands maskd clothed in red with huge legs and strong naked arms
 And leans on a ponderous axe

 Whom have you slaughterd lately European headsman
 Whose is that blood upon you so wet and sticky

 I see the clear sunsets of the martyrs
 I see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts
 Ghosts of dead lords uncrownd ladies impeachd ministers rejected kings
 Rivals traitors poisoners disgraced chieftains and the rest

 I see those who in any land have died for the good cause
 The seed is spare nevertheless the crop shall never run out
 Mind you O foreign kings O priests the crop shall never run out

 I see the blood washd entirely away from the axe
 Both blade and helve are clean
 They spirt no more the blood of European nobles they clasp no more
 the necks of queens

 I see the headsman withdraw and become useless
 I see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy I see no longer any axe upon it

 I see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own race
 the newest largest race

 9
 America I do not vaunt my love for you
 I have what I have

 The axe leaps
 The solid forest gives fluid utterances
 They tumble forth they rise and form
 Hut tent landing survey
 Flail plough pick crowbar spade
 Shingle rail prop wainscot lamb lath panel gable
 Citadel ceiling saloon academy organ exhibitionhouse library
 Cornice trellis pilaster balcony window turret porch
 Hoe rake pitchfork pencil wagon staff saw jackplane mallet
 wedge rounce
 Chair tub hoop table wicket vane sash floor
 Workbox chest stringd instrument boat frame and what not
 Capitols of States and capitol of the nation of States
 Long stately rows in avenues hospitals for orphans or for the poor or sick
 Manhattan steamboats and clippers taking the measure of all seas

 The shapes arise
 Shapes of the using of axes anyhow and the users and all that
 neighbors them
 Cutters down of wood and haulers of it to the Penobscot or Kenebec
 Dwellers in cabins among the Californian mountains or by the little
 lakes or on the Columbia
 Dwellers south on the banks of the Gila or Rio Grande friendly
 gatherings the characters and fun
 Dwellers along the St Lawrence or north in Kanada or down by the
 Yellowstone dwellers on coasts and off coasts
 Sealfishers whalers arctic seamen breaking passages through the ice

 The shapes arise
 Shapes of factories arsenals foundries markets
 Shapes of the twothreaded tracks of railroads
 Shapes of the sleepers of bridges vast frameworks girders arches
 Shapes of the fleets of barges tows lake and canal craft river craft
 Shipyards and drydocks along the Eastern and Western seas and in
 many a bay and byplace
 The liveoak kelsons the pine planks the spars the
 hackmatackroots for knees
 The ships themselves on their ways the tiers of scaffolds the
 workmen busy outside and inside
 The tools lying around the great auger and little auger the adze
 bolt line square gouge and beadplane

 10
 The shapes arise
 The shape measurd sawd jackd joind staind
 The coffinshape for the dead to lie within in his shroud
 The shape got out in posts in the bedstead posts in the posts of
 the brides bed
 The shape of the little trough the shape of the rockers beneath
 the shape of the babes cradle
 The shape of the floorplanks the floorplanks for dancers feet
 The shape of the planks of the family home the home of the friendly
 parents and children
 The shape of the roof of the home of the happy young man and
 woman the roof over the wellmarried young man and woman
 The roof over the supper joyously cookd by the chaste wife and joyously
 eaten by the chaste husband content after his days work

 The shapes arise
 The shape of the prisoners place in the courtroom and of him or
 her seated in the place
 The shape of the liquorbar leand against by the young rumdrinker
 and the old rumdrinker
 The shape of the shamed and angry stairs trod by sneaking foot steps
 The shape of the sly settee and the adulterous unwholesome couple
 The shape of the gamblingboard with its devilish winnings and losings
 The shape of the stepladder for the convicted and sentenced
 murderer the murderer with haggard face and piniond arms
 The sheriff at hand with his deputies the silent and whitelippd
 crowd the dangling of the rope

 The shapes arise
 Shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances
 The door passing the disseverd friend flushd and in haste
 The door that admits good news and bad news
 The door whence the son left home confident and puffd up
 The door he enterd again from a long and scandalous absence
 diseasd broken down without innocence without means

 11
 Her shape arises
 She less guarded than ever yet more guarded than ever
 The gross and soild she moves among do not make her gross and soild
 She knows the thoughts as she passes nothing is conceald from her
 She is none the less considerate or friendly therefor
 She is the best belovd it is without exception she has no reason
 to fear and she does not fear
 Oaths quarrels hiccuppd songs smutty expressions are idle to
 her as she passes
 She is silent she is possessd of herself they do not offend her
 She receives them as the laws of Nature receive them she is strong
 She too is a law of Naturethere is no law stronger than she is

 12
 The main shapes arise
 Shapes of Democracy total result of centuries
 Shapes ever projecting other shapes
 Shapes of turbulent manly cities
 Shapes of the friends and homegivers of the whole earth
 Shapes bracing the earth and braced with the whole earth




BOOK XIII


Song of the Exposition

 1
 Ah little recks the laborer
 How near his work is holding him to God
 The loving Laborer through space and time

 After all not to create only or found only
 But to bring perhaps from afar what is already founded
 To give it our own identity average limitless free
 To fill the gross the torpid bulk with vital religious fire
 Not to repel or destroy so much as accept fuse rehabilitate
 To obey as well as command to follow more than to lead
 These also are the lessons of our New World
 While how little the New after all how much the Old Old World

 Long and long has the grass been growing
 Long and long has the rain been falling
 Long has the globe been rolling round

 2
 Come Muse migrate from Greece and Ionia
 Cross out please those immensely overpaid accounts
 That matter of Troy and Achilles wrath and AEneas Odysseus wanderings
 Placard Removed and To Let on the rocks of your snowy Parnassus
 Repeat at Jerusalem place the notice high on jaffas gate and on
 Mount Moriah
 The same on the walls of your German French and Spanish castles
 and Italian collections
 For know a better fresher busier sphere a wide untried domain
 awaits demands you

 3
 Responsive to our summons
 Or rather to her longnursd inclination
 Joind with an irresistible natural gravitation
 She comes I hear the rustling of her gown
 I scent the odor of her breaths delicious fragrance
 I mark her step divine her curious eyes aturning rolling
 Upon this very scene

 The dame of dames can I believe then
 Those ancient temples sculptures classic could none of them retain her
 Nor shades of Virgil and Dante nor myriad memories poems old
 associations magnetize and hold on to her
 But that shes left them alland here

 Yes if you will allow me to say so
 I my friends if you do not can plainly see her
 The same undying soul of earths activitys beautys heroisms
 expression
 Out from her evolutions hither come ended the strata of her former themes
 Hidden and coverd by todays foundation of todays
 Ended deceasd through time her voice by Castalys fountain
 Silent the brokenlippd Sphynx in Egypt silent all those century
 baffling tombs
 Ended for aye the epics of Asias Europes helmeted warriors ended
 the primitive call of the muses
 Calliopes call forever closed Clio Melpomene Thalia dead
 Ended the stately rhythmus of Una and Oriana ended the quest of the
 holy Graal
 Jerusalem a handful of ashes blown by the wind extinct
 The Crusaders streams of shadowy midnight troops sped with the sunrise
 Amadis Tancred utterly gone Charlemagne Roland Oliver gone
 Palmerin ogre departed vanishd the turrets that Usk from its
 waters reflected
 Arthur vanishd with all his knights Merlin and Lancelot and
 Galahad all gone dissolvd utterly like an exhalation
 Passd passd for us forever passd that once so mighty world
 now void inanimate phantom world
 Embroiderd dazzling foreign world with all its gorgeous legends myths
 Its kings and castles proud its priests and warlike lords and
 courtly dames
 Passd to its charnel vault coffind with crown and armor on
 Blazond with Shaksperes purple page
 And dirged by Tennysons sweet sad rhyme

 I say I see my friends if you do not the illustrious emigre having it
 is true in her day although the same changed journeyd considerable
 Making directly for this rendezvous vigorously clearing a path for
 herself striding through the confusion
 By thud of machinery and shrill steamwhistle undismayd
 Bluffd not a bit by drainpipe gasometers artificial fertilizers
 Smiling and pleasd with palpable intent to stay
 Shes here installd amid the kitchen ware

 4
 But holddont I forget my manners
 To introduce the stranger what else indeed do I live to chant
 for to thee Columbia
 In libertys name welcome immortal clasp hands
 And ever henceforth sisters dear be both

 Fear not O Muse truly new ways and days receive surround you
 I candidly confess a queer queer race of novel fashion
 And yet the same old human race the same within without
 Faces and hearts the same feelings the same yearnings the same
 The same old love beauty and use the same

 5
 We do not blame thee elder World nor really separate ourselves from thee
 Would the son separate himself from the father
 Looking back on thee seeing thee to thy duties grandeurs through
 past ages bending building
 We build to ours today

 Mightier than Egypts tombs
 Fairer than Grecias Romas temples
 Prouder than Milans statued spired cathedral
 More picturesque than Rhenish castlekeeps
 We plan even now to raise beyond them all
 Thy great cathedral sacred industry no tomb
 A keep for life for practical invention

 As in a waking vision
 Een while I chant I see it rise I scan and prophesy outside and in
 Its manifold ensemble

 Around a palace loftier fairer ampler than any yet
 Earths modern wonder historys seven outstripping
 High rising tier on tier with glass and iron facades
 Gladdening the sun and sky enhued in cheerfulest hues
 Bronze lilac robinsegg marine and crimson
 Over whose golden roof shall flaunt beneath thy banner Freedom
 The banners of the States and flags of every land
 A brood of lofty fair but lesser palaces shall cluster

 Somewhere within their walls shall all that forwards perfect human
 life be started
 Tried taught advanced visibly exhibited

 Not only all the world of works trade products
 But all the workmen of the world here to be represented

 Here shall you trace in flowing operation
 In every state of practical busy movement the rills of civilization
 Materials here under your eye shall change their shape as if by magic
 The cotton shall be pickd almost in the very field
 Shall be dried cleand ginnd baled spun into thread and cloth
 before you
 You shall see hands at work at all the old processes and all the new ones
 You shall see the various grains and how flour is made and then
 bread baked by the bakers
 You shall see the crude ores of California and Nevada passing on and
 on till they become bullion
 You shall watch how the printer sets type and learn what a
 composingstick is
 You shall mark in amazement the Hoe press whirling its cylinders
 shedding the printed leaves steady and fast
 The photograph model watch pin nail shall be created before you

 In large calm halls a stately museum shall teach you the infinite
 lessons of minerals
 In another woods plants vegetation shall be illustratedin
 another animals animal life and development

 One stately house shall be the music house
 Others for other artslearning the sciences shall all be here
 None shall be slighted none but shall here be honord helpd exampled

 6
 This this and these America shall be your pyramids and obelisks
 Your Alexandrian Pharos gardens of Babylon
 Your temple at Olympia

 The male and female many laboring not
 Shall ever here confront the laboring many
 With precious benefits to both glory to all
 To thee America and thee eternal Muse

 And here shall ye inhabit powerful Matrons
 In your vast state vaster than all the old
 Echoed through long long centuries to come
 To sound of different prouder songs with stronger themes
 Practical peaceful life the peoples life the People themselves
 Lifted illumind bathed in peaceelate secure in peace

 7
 Away with themes of war away with war itself
 Hence from my shuddering sight to never more return that show of
 blackend mutilated corpses
 That hell unpent and raid of blood fit for wild tigers or for
 loptongued wolves not reasoning men
 And in its stead speed industrys campaigns
 With thy undaunted armies engineering
 Thy pennants labor loosend to the breeze
 Thy bugles sounding loud and clear

 Away with old romance
 Away with novels plots and plays of foreign courts
 Away with loveverses sugard in rhyme the intrigues amours of idlers
 Fitted for only banquets of the night where dancers to late music slide
 The unhealthy pleasures extravagant dissipations of the few
 With perfumes heat and wine beneath the dazzling chandeliers

 To you ye reverent sane sisters
 I raise a voice for far superber themes for poets and for art
 To exalt the present and the real
 To teach the average man the glory of his daily walk and trade
 To sing in songs how exercise and chemical life are never to be baffled
 To manual work for each and all to plough hoe dig
 To plant and tend the tree the berry vegetables flowers
 For every man to see to it that he really do something for every woman too
 To use the hammer and the saw rip or crosscut
 To cultivate a turn for carpentering plastering painting
 To work as tailor tailoress nurse hostler porter
 To invent a little something ingenious to aid the washing cooking
 cleaning
 And hold it no disgrace to take a hand at them themselves

 I say I bring thee Muse today and here
 All occupations duties broad and close
 Toil healthy toil and sweat endless without cessation
 The old old practical burdens interests joys
 The family parentage childhood husband and wife
 The housecomforts the house itself and all its belongings
 Food and its preservation chemistry applied to it
 Whatever forms the average strong complete sweetblooded man or
 woman the perfect longeve personality
 And helps its present life to health and happiness and shapes its soul
 For the eternal real life to come

 With latest connections works the intertransportation of the world
 Steampower the great express lines gas petroleum
 These triumphs of our time the Atlantics delicate cable
 The Pacific railroad the Suez canal the Mont Cenis and Gothard and
 Hoosac tunnels the Brooklyn bridge
 This earth all spannd with iron rails with lines of steamships
 threading in every sea
 Our own rondure the current globe I bring

 8
 And thou America
 Thy offspring towering eer so high yet higher Thee above all towering
 With Victory on thy left and at thy right hand Law
 Thou Union holding all fusing absorbing tolerating all
 Thee ever thee I sing

 Thou also thou a World
 With all thy wide geographies manifold different distant
 Rounded by thee in oneone common orbic language
 One common indivisible destiny for All

 And by the spells which ye vouchsafe to those your ministers in earnest
 I here personify and call my themes to make them pass before ye

 Behold America and thou ineffable guest and sister
 For thee come trooping up thy waters and thy lands
 Behold thy fields and farms thy faroff woods and mountains
 As in procession coming

 Behold the sea itself
 And on its limitless heaving breast the ships
 See where their white sails bellying in the wind speckle the
 green and blue
 See the steamers coming and going steaming in or out of port
 See dusky and undulating the long pennants of smoke

 Behold in Oregon far in the north and west
 Or in Maine far in the north and east thy cheerful axemen
 Wielding all day their axes

 Behold on the lakes thy pilots at their wheels thy oarsmen
 How the ash writhes under those muscular arms

 There by the furnace and there by the anvil
 Behold thy sturdy blacksmiths swinging their sledges
 Overhand so steady overhand they turn and fall with joyous clank
 Like a tumult of laughter

 Mark the spirit of invention everywhere thy rapid patents
 Thy continual workshops foundries risen or rising
 See from their chimneys how the tall flamefires stream

 Mark thy interminable farms North South
 Thy wealthy daughterstates Eastern and Western
 The varied products of Ohio Pennsylvania Missouri Georgia Texas
 and the rest
 Thy limitless crops grass wheat sugar oil corn rice hemp hops
 Thy barns all filld the endless freighttrain and the bulging storehouse
 The grapes that ripen on thy vines the apples in thy orchards
 Thy incalculable lumber beef pork potatoes thy coal thy gold
 and silver
 The inexhaustible iron in thy mines

 All thine O sacred Union
 Ships farms shops barns factories mines
 City and State North South item and aggregate
 We dedicate dread Mother all to thee

 Protectress absolute thou bulwark of all
 For well we know that while thou givest each and all generous as God
 Without thee neither all nor each nor land home
 Nor ship nor mine nor any here this day secure
 Nor aught nor any day secure

 9
 And thou the Emblem waving over all
 Delicate beauty a word to thee it may be salutary
 Remember thou hast not always been as here today so comfortably
 ensovereignd
 In other scenes than these have I observd thee flag
 Not quite so trim and whole and freshly blooming in folds of
 stainless silk
 But I have seen thee bunting to tatters torn upon thy splinterd staff
 Or clutchd to some young colorbearers breast with desperate hands
 Savagely struggled for for life or death fought over long
 Mid cannons thundercrash and many a curse and groan and yell and
 riflevolleys cracking sharp
 And moving masses as wild demons surging and lives as nothing riskd
 For thy mere remnant grimed with dirt and smoke and soppd in blood
 For sake of that my beauty and that thou mightst dally as now
 secure up there
 Many a good man have I seen go under

 Now here and these and hence in peace all thine O Flag
 And here and hence for thee O universal Muse and thou for them
 And here and hence O Union all the work and workmen thine
 None separate from theehenceforth One only we and thou
 For the blood of the children what is it only the blood maternal
 And lives and works what are they all at last except the roads to
 faith and death

 While we rehearse our measureless wealth it is for thee dear Mother
 We own it all and several today indissoluble in thee
 Think not our chant our show merely for products gross or lucre
 it is for thee the soul in thee electric spiritual
 Our farms inventions crops we own in thee cities and States in thee
 Our freedom all in thee our very lives in thee




BOOK XIV


Song of the RedwoodTree

 1
 A California song
 A prophecy and indirection a thought impalpable to breathe as air
 A chorus of dryads fading departing or hamadryads departing
 A murmuring fateful giant voice out of the earth and sky
 Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense

 Farewell my brethren
 Farewell O earth and sky farewell ye neighboring waters
 My time has ended my term has come

 Along the northern coast
 Just back from the rockbound shore and the caves
 In the saline air from the sea in the Mendocino country
 With the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse
 With crackling blows of axes sounding musically driven by strong arms
 Riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes there in the redwood
 forest dense
 I heard the might tree its deathchant chanting

 The choppers heard not the camp shanties echoed not
 The quickeard teamsters and chain and jackscrew men heard not
 As the woodspirits came from their haunts of a thousand years to
 join the refrain
 But in my soul I plainly heard

 Murmuring out of its myriad leaves
 Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high
 Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs out of its footthick bark
 That chant of the seasons and time chant not of the past only but
 the future

 You untold life of me
 And all you venerable and innocent joys
 Perennial hardy life of me with joys mid rain and many a summer sun
 And the white snows and night and the wild winds
 O the great patient rugged joys my souls strong joys unreckd by man
 For know I bear the soul befitting me I too have consciousness identity
 And all the rocks and mountains have and all the earth
 Joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine
 Our time our term has come

 Nor yield we mournfully majestic brothers
 We who have grandly filld our time
 With Natures calm content with tacit huge delight
 We welcome what we wrought for through the past
 And leave the field for them

 For them predicted long
 For a superber race they too to grandly fill their time
 For them we abdicate in them ourselves ye forest kings
 In them these skies and airs these mountain peaks Shasta Nevadas
 These huge precipitous cliffs this amplitude these valleys far Yosemite
 To be in them absorbd assimilated

 Then to a loftier strain
 Still prouder more ecstatic rose the chant
 As if the heirs the deities of the West
 Joining with mastertongue bore part

 Not wan from Asias fetiches
 Nor red from Europes old dynastic slaughterhouse
 Area of murderplots of thrones with scent left yet of wars and
 scaffolds everywhere
 But come from Natures long and harmless throes peacefully builded thence
 These virgin lands lands of the Western shore
 To the new culminating man to you the empire new
 You promisd long we pledge we dedicate

 You occult deep volitions
 You average spiritual manhood purpose of all poisd on yourself
 giving not taking law
 You womanhood divine mistress and source of all whence life and
 love and aught that comes from life and love
 You unseen moral essence of all the vast materials of America age
 upon age working in death the same as life
 You that sometimes known oftener unknown really shape and mould
 the New World adjusting it to Time and Space
 You hidden national will lying in your abysms conceald but ever alert
 You past and present purposes tenaciously pursued maybe
 unconscious of yourselves
 Unswervd by all the passing errors perturbations of the surface
 You vital universal deathless germs beneath all creeds arts
 statutes literatures
 Here build your homes for good establish here these areas entire
 lands of the Western shore
 We pledge we dedicate to you

 For man of you your characteristic race
 Here may he hardy sweet gigantic grow here tower proportionate to Nature
 Here climb the vast pure spaces unconfined uncheckd by wall or roof
 Here laugh with storm or sun here joy here patiently inure
 Here heed himself unfold himself not others formulas heed
 here fill his time
 To duly fall to aid unreckd at last
 To disappear to serve

 Thus on the northern coast
 In the echo of teamsters calls and the clinking chains and the
 music of choppers axes
 The falling trunk and limbs the crash the muffled shriek the groan
 Such words combined from the redwoodtree as of voices ecstatic
 ancient and rustling
 The centurylasting unseen dryads singing withdrawing
 All their recesses of forests and mountains leaving
 From the Cascade range to the Wahsatch or Idaho far or Utah
 To the deities of the modern henceforth yielding
 The chorus and indications the vistas of coming humanity the
 settlements features all
 In the Mendocino woods I caught

 2
 The flashing and golden pageant of California
 The sudden and gorgeous drama the sunny and ample lands
 The long and varied stretch from Puget sound to Colorado south
 Lands bathed in sweeter rarer healthier air valleys and mountain cliffs
 The fields of Nature long prepared and fallow the silent cyclic chemistry
 The slow and steady ages plodding the unoccupied surface ripening
 the rich ores forming beneath
 At last the New arriving assuming taking possession
 A swarming and busy race settling and organizing everywhere
 Ships coming in from the whole round world and going out to the
 whole world
 To India and China and Australia and the thousand island paradises
 of the Pacific
 Populous cities the latest inventions the steamers on the rivers
 the railroads with many a thrifty farm with machinery
 And wool and wheat and the grape and diggings of yellow gold

 3
 But more in you than these lands of the Western shore
 These but the means the implements the standingground
 I see in you certain to come the promise of thousands of years
 till now deferrd
 Promisd to be fulfilld our common kind the race

 The new society at last proportionate to Nature
 In man of you more than your mountain peaks or stalwart trees imperial
 In woman more far more than all your gold or vines or even vital air

 Fresh come to a new world indeed yet long prepared
 I see the genius of the modern child of the real and ideal
 Clearing the ground for broad humanity the true America heir of
 the past so grand
 To build a grander future




BOOK XV


A Song for Occupations

 1
 A song for occupations
 In the labor of engines and trades and the labor of fields I find
 the developments
 And find the eternal meanings

 Workmen and Workwomen
 Were all educations practical and ornamental well displayd out of
 me what would it amount to
 Were I as the head teacher charitable proprietor wise statesman
 what would it amount to
 Were I to you as the boss employing and paying you would that satisfy you

 The learnd virtuous benevolent and the usual terms
 A man like me and never the usual terms

 Neither a servant nor a master I
 I take no sooner a large price than a small price I will have my
 own whoever enjoys me
 I will be even with you and you shall be even with me

 If you stand at work in a shop I stand as nigh as the nighest in the
 same shop
 If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend I demand as
 good as your brother or dearest friend
 If your lover husband wife is welcome by day or night I must be
 personally as welcome
 If you become degraded criminal ill then I become so for your sake
 If you remember your foolish and outlawd deeds do you think I
 cannot remember my own foolish and outlawd deeds
 If you carouse at the table I carouse at the opposite side of the table
 If you meet some stranger in the streets and love him or her why
 I often meet strangers in the street and love them

 Why what have you thought of yourself
 Is it you then that thought yourself less
 Is it you that thought the President greater than you
 Or the rich better off than you or the educated wiser than you

 Because you are greasy or pimpled or were once drunk or a thief
 Or that you are diseasd or rheumatic or a prostitute
 Or from frivolity or impotence or that you are no scholar and never
 saw your name in print
 Do you give in that you are any less immortal

 2
 Souls of men and women it is not you I call unseen unheard
 untouchable and untouching
 It is not you I go argue pro and con about and to settle whether
 you are alive or no
 I own publicly who you are if nobody else owns

 Grown halfgrown and babe of this country and every country
 indoors and outdoors one just as much as the other I see
 And all else behind or through them

 The wife and she is not one jot less than the husband
 The daughter and she is just as good as the son
 The mother and she is every bit as much as the father

 Offspring of ignorant and poor boys apprenticed to trades
 Young fellows working on farms and old fellows working on farms
 Sailormen merchantmen coasters immigrants
 All these I see but nigher and farther the same I see
 None shall escape me and none shall wish to escape me

 I bring what you much need yet always have
 Not money amours dress eating erudition but as good
 I send no agent or medium offer no representative of value but
 offer the value itself

 There is something that comes to one now and perpetually
 It is not what is printed preachd discussed it eludes discussion
 and print
 It is not to be put in a book it is not in this book
 It is for you whoever you are it is no farther from you than your
 hearing and sight are from you
 It is hinted by nearest commonest readiest it is ever provoked by them

 You may read in many languages yet read nothing about it
 You may read the Presidents message and read nothing about it there
 Nothing in the reports from the State department or Treasury
 department or in the daily papers or weekly papers
 Or in the census or revenue returns prices current or any accounts
 of stock

 3
 The sun and stars that float in the open air
 The appleshaped earth and we upon it surely the drift of them is
 something grand
 I do not know what it is except that it is grand and that it is happiness
 And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation or
 bonmot or reconnoissance
 And that it is not something which by luck may turn out well for us
 and without luck must be a failure for us
 And not something which may yet be retracted in a certain contingency

 The light and shade the curious sense of body and identity the
 greed that with perfect complaisance devours all things
 The endless pride and outstretching of man unspeakable joys and sorrows
 The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees and the wonders
 that fill each minute of time forever
 What have you reckond them for camerado
 Have you reckond them for your trade or farmwork or for the
 profits of your store
 Or to achieve yourself a position or to fill a gentlemans leisure
 or a ladys leisure

 Have you reckond that the landscape took substance and form that it
 might be painted in a picture
 Or men and women that they might be written of and songs sung
 Or the attraction of gravity and the great laws and harmonious combinations
 and the fluids of the air as subjects for the savans
 Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts
 Or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names
 Or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables or
 agriculture itself

 Old institutions these arts libraries legends collections and
 the practice handed along in manufactures will we rate them so high
 Will we rate our cash and business high I have no objection
 I rate them as high as the highestthen a child born of a woman and
 man I rate beyond all rate

 We thought our Union grand and our Constitution grand
 I do not say they are not grand and good for they are
 I am this day just as much in love with them as you
 Then I am in love with You and with all my fellows upon the earth

 We consider bibles and religions divineI do not say they are not divine
 I say they have all grown out of you and may grow out of you still
 It is not they who give the life it is you who give the life
 Leaves are not more shed from the trees or trees from the earth
 than they are shed out of you

 4
 The sum of all known reverence I add up in you whoever you are
 The President is there in the White House for you it is not you who
 are here for him
 The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you not you here for them
 The Congress convenes every Twelfthmonth for you
 Laws courts the forming of States the charters of cities the
 going and coming of commerce and malls are all for you

 List close my scholars dear
 Doctrines politics and civilization exurge from you
 Sculpture and monuments and any thing inscribed anywhere are tallied in you
 The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records
 reach is in you this hour and myths and tales the same
 If you were not breathing and walking here where would they all be
 The most renownd poems would be ashes orations and plays would
 be vacuums

 All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it
 Did you think it was in the white or gray stone or the lines of
 the arches and cornices

 All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded by the instruments
 It is not the violins and the cornets it is not the oboe nor the
 beating drums nor the score of the baritone singer singing his
 sweet romanza nor that of the mens chorus nor that of the
 womens chorus
 It is nearer and farther than they

 5
 Will the whole come back then
 Can each see signs of the best by a look in the lookingglass is
 there nothing greater or more
 Does all sit there with you with the mystic unseen soul

 Strange and hard that paradox true I give
 Objects gross and the unseen soul are one

 Housebuilding measuring sawing the boards
 Blacksmithing glassblowing nailmaking coopering tinroofing

 Shipjoining dockbuilding fishcuring flagging of sidewalks by flaggers
 The pump the piledriver the great derrick the coalkiln and brickkiln

 In that and them the heft of the heaviestin that and them far more
 than you estimated and far less also
 In them realities for you and me in them poems for you and me
 In them not yourselfyou and your soul enclose all things
 regardless of estimation
 In them the development goodin them all themes hints possibilities

 I do not affirm that what you see beyond is futile I do not advise
 you to stop
 I do not say leadings you thought great are not great
 But I say that none lead to greater than these lead to

 6
 Will you seek afar off you surely come back at last
 In things best known to you finding the best or as good as the best
 In folks nearest to you finding the sweetest strongest lovingest
 Happiness knowledge not in another place but this place not for
 another hour but this hour
 Man in the first you see or touch always in friend brother
 nighest neighborwoman in mother sister wife
 The popular tastes and employments taking precedence in poems or anywhere
 You workwomen and workmen of these States having your own divine
 and strong life
 And all else giving place to men and women like you
 When the psalm sings instead of the singer

 When the script preaches instead of the preacher
 When the pulpit descends and goes instead of the carver that carved
 the supporting desk
 When I can touch the body of books by night or by day and when they
 touch my body back again
 When a university course convinces like a slumbering woman and child
 convince
 When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the nightwatchmans daughter
 When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite and are my friendly
 companions
 I intend to reach them my hand and make as much of them as I do
 of men and women like you




BOOK XVI


A Song of the Rolling Earth

 1
 A song of the rolling earth and of words according
 Were you thinking that those were the words those upright lines
 those curves angles dots
 No those are not the words the substantial words are in the ground
 and sea
 They are in the air they are in you

 Were you thinking that those were the words those delicious sounds
 out of your friends mouths
 No the real words are more delicious than they

 Human bodies are words myriads of words
 In the best poems reappears the body mans or womans
 wellshaped natural gay
 Every part able active receptive without shame or the need of shame

 Air soil water firethose are words
 I myself am a word with themmy qualities interpenetrate with
 theirsmy name is nothing to them
 Though it were told in the three thousand languages what would
 air soil water fire know of my name

 A healthy presence a friendly or commanding gesture are words
 sayings meanings
 The charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women
 are sayings and meanings also

 The workmanship of souls is by those inaudible words of the earth
 The masters know the earths words and use them more than audible words

 Amelioration is one of the earths words
 The earth neither lags nor hastens
 It has all attributes growths effects latent in itself from the jump
 It is not half beautiful only defects and excrescences show just as
 much as perfections show

 The earth does not withhold it is generous enough
 The truths of the earth continually wait they are not so conceald either
 They are calm subtle untransmissible by print
 They are imbued through all things conveying themselves willingly
 Conveying a sentiment and invitation I utter and utter
 I speak not yet if you hear me not of what avail am I to you
 To bear to better lacking these of what avail am I

 Accouche accouchez
 Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there
 Will you squat and stifle there

 The earth does not argue
 Is not pathetic has no arrangements
 Does not scream haste persuade threaten promise
 Makes no discriminations has no conceivable failures
 Closes nothing refuses nothing shuts none out
 Of all the powers objects states it notifies shuts none out

 The earth does not exhibit itself nor refuse to exhibit itself
 possesses still underneath
 Underneath the ostensible sounds the august chorus of heroes the
 wail of slaves
 Persuasions of lovers curses gasps of the dying laughter of young
 people accents of bargainers
 Underneath these possessing words that never fall

 To her children the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail
 The true words do not fail for motion does not fail and reflection
 does not fall
 Also the day and night do not fall and the voyage we pursue does not fall

 Of the interminable sisters
 Of the ceaseless cotillons of sisters
 Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters the elder and younger sisters
 The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest

 With her ample back towards every beholder
 With the fascinations of youth and the equal fascinations of age
 Sits she whom I too love like the rest sits undisturbd
 Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror while her
 eyes glance back from it
 Glance as she sits inviting none denying none
 Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face

 Seen at hand or seen at a distance
 Duly the twentyfour appear in public every day
 Duly approach and pass with their companions or a companion
 Looking from no countenances of their own but from the countenances
 of those who are with them
 From the countenances of children or women or the manly countenance
 From the open countenances of animals or from inanimate things
 From the landscape or waters or from the exquisite apparition of the sky
 From our countenances mine and yours faithfully returning them
 Every day in public appearing without fall but never twice with the
 same companions

 Embracing man embracing all proceed the three hundred and
 sixtyfive resistlessly round the sun
 Embracing all soothing supporting follow close three hundred and
 sixtyfive offsets of the first sure and necessary as they

 Tumbling on steadily nothing dreading
 Sunshine storm cold heat forever withstanding passing carrying
 The souls realization and determination still inheriting
 The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing
 No balk retarding no anchor anchoring on no rock striking
 Swift glad content unbereavd nothing losing
 Of all able and ready at any time to give strict account
 The divine ship sails the divine sea

 2
 Whoever you are motion and reflection are especially for you
 The divine ship sails the divine sea for you

 Whoever you are you are he or she for whom the earth is solid and liquid
 You are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in the sky
 For none more than you are the present and the past
 For none more than you is immortality

 Each man to himself and each woman to herself is the word of the
 past and present and the true word of immortality
 No one can acquire for anothernot one
 Not one can grow for anothernot one

 The song is to the singer and comes back most to him
 The teaching is to the teacher and comes back most to him
 The murder is to the murderer and comes back most to him
 The theft is to the thief and comes back most to him
 The love is to the lover and comes back most to him
 The gift is to the giver and comes back most to himit cannot fail
 The oration is to the orator the acting is to the actor and actress
 not to the audience
 And no man understands any greatness or goodness but his own or
 the indication of his own

 3
 I swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or her who shall
 be complete
 The earth remains jagged and broken only to him or her who remains
 jagged and broken

 I swear there is no greatness or power that does not emulate those
 of the earth
 There can be no theory of any account unless it corroborate the
 theory of the earth
 No politics song religion behavior or what not is of account
 unless it compare with the amplitude of the earth
 Unless it face the exactness vitality impartiality rectitude of
 the earth

 I swear I begin to see love with sweeter spasms than that which
 responds love
 It is that which contains itself which never invites and never refuses

 I swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible words
 All merges toward the presentation of the unspoken meanings of the earth
 Toward him who sings the songs of the body and of the truths of the earth
 Toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that print cannot touch

 I swear I see what is better than to tell the best
 It is always to leave the best untold

 When I undertake to tell the best I find I cannot
 My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots
 My breath will not be obedient to its organs
 I become a dumb man

 The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow all or any is best
 It is not what you anticipated it is cheaper easier nearer
 Things are not dismissd from the places they held before
 The earth is just as positive and direct as it was before
 Facts religions improvements politics trades are as real as before
 But the soul is also real it too is positive and direct
 No reasoning no proof has establishd it
 Undeniable growth has establishd it

 4
 These to echo the tones of souls and the phrases of souls
 If they did not echo the phrases of souls what were they then
 If they had not reference to you in especial what were they then

 I swear I will never henceforth have to do with the faith that tells
 the best
 I will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best untold

 Say on sayers sing on singers
 Delve mould pile the words of the earth
 Work on age after age nothing is to be lost
 It may have to wait long but it will certainly come in use
 When the materials are all prepared and ready the architects shall appear

 I swear to you the architects shall appear without fall
 I swear to you they will understand you and justify you
 The greatest among them shall be he who best knows you and encloses
 all and is faithful to all
 He and the rest shall not forget you they shall perceive that you
 are not an iota less than they
 You shall be fully glorified in them




Youth Day Old Age and Night

 Youth large lusty lovingyouth full of grace force fascination
 Do you know that Old Age may come after you with equal grace
 force fascination

 Day fullblown and splendidday of the immense sun action
 ambition laughter
 The Night follows close with millions of suns and sleep and
 restoring darkness




BOOK XVII BIRDS OF PASSAGE


Song of the Universal

 1
 Come said the Muse
 Sing me a song no poet yet has chanted
 Sing me the universal

 In this broad earth of ours
 Amid the measureless grossness and the slag
 Enclosed and safe within its central heart
 Nestles the seed perfection

 By every life a share or more or less
 None born but it is born conceald or unconceald the seed is waiting

 2
 Lo keeneyed towering science
 As from tall peaks the modern overlooking
 Successive absolute fiats issuing

 Yet again lo the soul above all science
 For it has history gatherd like husks around the globe
 For it the entire starmyriads roll through the sky

 In spiral routes by long detours
 As a muchtacking ship upon the sea
 For it the partial to the permanent flowing
 For it the real to the ideal tends

 For it the mystic evolution
 Not the right only justified what we call evil also justified

 Forth from their masks no matter what
 From the huge festering trunk from craft and guile and tears
 Health to emerge and joy joy universal

 Out of the bulk the morbid and the shallow
 Out of the bad majority the varied countless frauds of men and states
 Electric antiseptic yet cleaving suffusing all
 Only the good is universal

 3
 Over the mountaingrowths disease and sorrow
 An uncaught bird is ever hovering hovering
 High in the purer happier air

 From imperfections murkiest cloud
 Darts always forth one ray of perfect light
 One flash of heavens glory

 To fashions customs discord
 To the mad Babeldin the deafening orgies
 Soothing each lull a strain is heard just heard
 From some far shore the final chorus sounding

 O the blest eyes the happy hearts
 That see that know the guiding thread so fine
 Along the mighty labyrinth

 4
 And thou America
 For the schemes culmination its thought and its reality
 For these not for thyself thou hast arrived

 Thou too surroundest all
 Embracing carrying welcoming all thou too by pathways broad and new
 To the ideal tendest

 The measured faiths of other lands the grandeurs of the past
 Are not for thee but grandeurs of thine own
 Deific faiths and amplitudes absorbing comprehending all
 All eligible to all

 All all for immortality
 Love like the light silently wrapping all
 Natures amelioration blessing all
 The blossoms fruits of ages orchards divine and certain
 Forms objects growths humanities to spiritual images ripening

 Give me O God to sing that thought
 Give me give him or her I love this quenchless faith
 In Thy ensemble whatever else withheld withhold not from us
 Belief in plan of Thee enclosed in Time and Space
 Health peace salvation universal

 Is it a dream
 Nay but the lack of it the dream
 And failing it lifes lore and wealth a dream
 And all the world a dream




Pioneers O Pioneers

 Come my tanfaced children
 Follow well in order get your weapons ready
 Have you your pistols have you your sharpedged axes
 Pioneers O pioneers

 For we cannot tarry here
 We must march my darlings we must bear the brunt of danger
 We the youthful sinewy races all the rest on us depend
 Pioneers O pioneers

 O you youths Western youths
 So impatient full of action full of manly pride and friendship
 Plain I see you Western youths see you tramping with the foremost
 Pioneers O pioneers

 Have the elder races halted
 Do they droop and end their lesson wearied over there beyond the seas
 We take up the task eternal and the burden and the lesson
 Pioneers O pioneers

 All the past we leave behind
 We debouch upon a newer mightier world varied world
 Fresh and strong the world we seize world of labor and the march
 Pioneers O pioneers

 We detachments steady throwing
 Down the edges through the passes up the mountains steep
 Conquering holding daring venturing as we go the unknown ways
 Pioneers O pioneers

 We primeval forests felling
 We the rivers stemming vexing we and piercing deep the mines within
 We the surface broad surveying we the virgin soil upheaving
 Pioneers O pioneers

 Colorado men are we
 From the peaks gigantic from the great sierras and the high plateaus
 From the mine and from the gully from the hunting trail we come
 Pioneers O pioneers

 From Nebraska from Arkansas
 Central inland race are we from Missouri with the continental
 blood interveind
 All the hands of comrades clasping all the Southern all the Northern
 Pioneers O pioneers

 O resistless restless race
 O beloved race in all O my breast aches with tender love for all
 O I mourn and yet exult I am rapt with love for all
 Pioneers O pioneers

 Raise the mighty mother mistress
 Waving high the delicate mistress over all the starry mistress
 bend your heads all
 Raise the fangd and warlike mistress stern impassive weapond mistress
 Pioneers O pioneers

 See my children resolute children
 By those swarms upon our rear we must never yield or falter
 Ages back in ghostly millions frowning there behind us urging
 Pioneers O pioneers

 On and on the compact ranks
 With accessions ever waiting with the places of the dead quickly filld
 Through the battle through defeat moving yet and never stopping
 Pioneers O pioneers

 O to die advancing on
 Are there some of us to droop and die has the hour come
 Then upon the march we fittest die soon and sure the gap is filld
 Pioneers O pioneers

 All the pulses of the world
 Falling in they beat for us with the Western movement beat
 Holding single or together steady moving to the front all for us

 All the joyous all the sorrowing all the living all the dying
 Pioneers O pioneers

 I too with my soul and body
 We a curious trio picking wandering on our way
 Through these shores amid the shadows with the apparitions pressing
 Pioneers O pioneers

 Lo the darting bowling orb
 Lo the brother orbs around all the clustering suns and planets
 All the dazzling days all the mystic nights with dreams
 Pioneers O pioneers

 These are of us they are with us
 All for primal needed work while the followers there in embryo wait behind
 We todays procession heading we the route for travel clearing
 Pioneers O pioneers

 O you daughters of the West
 O you young and elder daughters O you mothers and you wives
 Never must you be divided in our ranks you move united
 Pioneers O pioneers

 Minstrels latent on the prairies
 Shrouded bards of other lands you may rest you have done your work
 Soon I hear you coming warbling soon you rise and tramp amid us
 Pioneers O pioneers

 Not for delectations sweet
 Not the cushion and the slipper not the peaceful and the studious
 Not the riches safe and palling not for us the tame enjoyment
 Pioneers O pioneers

 Do the feasters gluttonous feast
 Do the corpulent sleepers sleep have they lockd and bolted doors
 Still be ours the diet hard and the blanket on the ground
 Pioneers O pioneers

 Has the night descended
 Was the road of late so toilsome did we stop discouraged nodding
 on our way
 Yet a passing hour I yield you in your tracks to pause oblivious
 Pioneers O pioneers

 Till with sound of trumpet
 Far far off the daybreak callhark how loud and clear I hear it wind
 Swift to the head of the armyswift spring to your places
 Pioneers O pioneers




To You

 Whoever you are I fear you are walking the walks of dreams
 I fear these supposed realities are to melt from under your feet and hands
 Even now your features joys speech house trade manners
 troubles follies costume crimes dissipate away from you
 Your true soul and body appear before me
 They stand forth out of affairs out of commerce shops work
 farms clothes the house buying selling eating drinking
 suffering dying

 Whoever you are now I place my hand upon you that you be my poem
 I whisper with my lips close to your ear
 I have loved many women and men but I love none better than you

 O I have been dilatory and dumb
 I should have made my way straight to you long ago
 I should have blabbd nothing but you I should have chanted nothing
 but you

 I will leave all and come and make the hymns of you
 None has understood you but I understand you
 None has done justice to you you have not done justice to yourself
 None but has found you imperfect I only find no imperfection in you
 None but would subordinate you I only am he who will never consent
 to subordinate you
 I only am he who places over you no master owner better God
 beyond what waits intrinsically in yourself

 Painters have painted their swarming groups and the centrefigure of all
 From the head of the centrefigure spreading a nimbus of goldcolord light
 But I paint myriads of heads but paint no head without its nimbus
 of goldcolord light
 From my hand from the brain of every man and woman it streams
 effulgently flowing forever

 O I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you
 You have not known what you are you have slumberd upon yourself
 all your life
 Your eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time
 What you have done returns already in mockeries
 Your thrift knowledge prayers if they do not return in
 mockeries what is their return

 The mockeries are not you
 Underneath them and within them I see you lurk
 I pursue you where none else has pursued you
 Silence the desk the flippant expression the night the
 accustomd routine if these conceal you from others or from
 yourself they do not conceal you from me
 The shaved face the unsteady eye the impure complexion if these
 balk others they do not balk me
 The pert apparel the deformd attitude drunkenness greed
 premature death all these I part aside

 There is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in you
 There is no virtue no beauty in man or woman but as good is in you
 No pluck no endurance in others but as good is in you
 No pleasure waiting for others but an equal pleasure waits for you

 As for me I give nothing to any one except I give the like carefully
 to you
 I sing the songs of the glory of none not God sooner than I sing
 the songs of the glory of you

 Whoever you are claim your own at any hazard
 These shows of the East and West are tame compared to you
 These immense meadows these interminable rivers you are immense
 and interminable as they
 These furies elements storms motions of Nature throes of apparent
 dissolution you are he or she who is master or mistress over them
 Master or mistress in your own right over Nature elements pain
 passion dissolution

 The hopples fall from your ankles you find an unfailing sufficiency
 Old or young male or female rude low rejected by the rest
 whatever you are promulges itself
 Through birth life death burial the means are provided nothing
 is scanted
 Through angers losses ambition ignorance ennui what you are
 picks its way




France the 18th Year of these States

 A great year and place
 A harsh discordant natal scream outsounding to touch the mothers
 heart closer than any yet

 I walkd the shores of my Eastern sea
 Heard over the waves the little voice
 Saw the divine infant where she woke mournfully wailing amid the
 roar of cannon curses shouts crash of falling buildings
 Was not so sick from the blood in the gutters running nor from the single
 corpses nor those in heaps nor those borne away in the tumbrils
 Was not so desperate at the battues of deathwas not so shockd at
 the repeated fusillades of the guns

 Pale silent stern what could I say to that longaccrued retribution
 Could I wish humanity different
 Could I wish the people made of wood and stone
 Or that there be no justice in destiny or time

 O Liberty O mate for me
 Here too the blaze the grapeshot and the axe in reserve to fetch
 them out in case of need
 Here too though long represt can never be destroyd
 Here too could rise at last murdering and ecstatic
 Here too demanding full arrears of vengeance

 Hence I sign this salute over the sea
 And I do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism
 But remember the little voice that I heard wailing and wait with
 perfect trust no matter how long
 And from today sad and cogent I maintain the bequeathd cause as
 for all lands
 And I send these words to Paris with my love
 And I guess some chansonniers there will understand them
 For I guess there is latent music yet in France floods of it
 O I hear already the bustle of instruments they will soon be
 drowning all that would interrupt them
 O I think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march
 It reaches hither it swells me to Joyful madness
 I will run transpose it in words to justify
 I will yet sing a song for you ma femme




Myself and Mine

 Myself and mine gymnastic ever
 To stand the cold or heat to take good aim with a gun to sail a
 boat to manage horses to beget superb children
 To speak readily and clearly to feel at home among common people
 And to hold our own in terrible positions on land and sea

 Not for an embroiderer
 There will always be plenty of embroiderers I welcome them also
 But for the fibre of things and for inherent men and women

 Not to chisel ornaments
 But to chisel with free stroke the heads and limbs of plenteous
 supreme Gods that the States may realize them walking and talking

 Let me have my own way
 Let others promulge the laws I will make no account of the laws
 Let others praise eminent men and hold up peace I hold up agitation
 and conflict
 I praise no eminent man I rebuke to his face the one that was
 thought most worthy

 Who are you and what are you secretly guilty of all your life
 Will you turn aside all your life will you grub and chatter all
 your life
 And who are you blabbing by rote years pages languages reminiscences
 Unwitting today that you do not know how to speak properly a single word

 Let others finish specimens I never finish specimens
 I start them by exhaustless laws as Nature does fresh and modern
 continually

 I give nothing as duties
 What others give as duties I give as living impulses
 Shall I give the hearts action as a duty

 Let others dispose of questions I dispose of nothing I arouse
 unanswerable questions
 Who are they I see and touch and what about them
 What about these likes of myself that draw me so close by tender
 directions and indirections

 I call to the world to distrust the accounts of my friends but
 listen to my enemies as I myself do
 I charge you forever reject those who would expound me for I cannot
 expound myself
 I charge that there be no theory or school founded out of me
 I charge you to leave all free as I have left all free

 After me vista
 O I see life is not short but immeasurably long
 I henceforth tread the world chaste temperate an early riser a
 steady grower
 Every hour the semen of centuries and still of centuries

 I must follow up these continual lessons of the air water earth
 I perceive I have no time to lose




Year of Meteors 185960

 Year of meteors brooding year
 I would bind in words retrospective some of your deeds and signs
 I would sing your contest for the 19th Presidentiad
 I would sing how an old man tall with white hair mounted the
 scaffold in Virginia
 I was at hand silent I stood with teeth shut close I watchd
 I stood very near you old man when cool and indifferent but trembling
 with age and your unheald wounds you mounted the scaffold
 I would sing in my copious song your census returns of the States
 The tables of population and products I would sing of your ships
 and their cargoes
 The proud black ships of Manhattan arriving some filld with
 immigrants some from the isthmus with cargoes of gold
 Songs thereof would I sing to all that hitherward comes would welcome give
 And you would I sing fair stripling welcome to you from me young
 prince of England
 Remember you surging Manhattans crowds as you passd with your
 cortege of nobles
 There in the crowds stood I and singled you out with attachment
 Nor forget I to sing of the wonder the ship as she swam up my bay
 Wellshaped and stately the Great Eastern swam up my bay she was
 600 feet long
 Her moving swiftly surrounded by myriads of small craft I forget not
 to sing
 Nor the comet that came unannounced out of the north flaring in heaven
 Nor the strange huge meteorprocession dazzling and clear shooting
 over our heads
 A moment a moment long it saild its balls of unearthly light over
 our heads
 Then departed dropt in the night and was gone
 Of such and fitful as they I singwith gleams from them would
 gleam and patch these chants
 Your chants O year all mottled with evil and goodyear of forebodings
 Year of comets and meteors transient and strangelo even here one
 equally transient and strange
 As I flit through you hastily soon to fall and be gone what is this chant
 What am I myself but one of your meteors




With Antecedents

 1
 With antecedents
 With my fathers and mothers and the accumulations of past ages
 With all which had it not been I would not now be here as I am
 With Egypt India Phenicia Greece and Rome
 With the Kelt the Scandinavian the Alb and the Saxon
 With antique maritime ventures laws artisanship wars and journeys
 With the poet the skald the saga the myth and the oracle
 With the sale of slaves with enthusiasts with the troubadour the
 crusader and the monk
 With those old continents whence we have come to this new continent
 With the fading kingdoms and kings over there
 With the fading religions and priests
 With the small shores we look back to from our own large and present shores
 With countless years drawing themselves onward and arrived at these years
 You and me arrivedAmerica arrived and making this year
 This year sending itself ahead countless years to come

 2
 O but it is not the yearsit is I it is You
 We touch all laws and tally all antecedents
 We are the skald the oracle the monk and the knight we easily
 include them and more
 We stand amid time beginningless and endless we stand amid evil and good
 All swings around us there is as much darkness as light
 The very sun swings itself and its system of planets around us
 Its sun and its again all swing around us

 As for me torn stormy amid these vehement days
 I have the idea of all and am all and believe in all
 I believe materialism is true and spiritualism is true I reject no part

 Have I forgotten any part any thing in the past
 Come to me whoever and whatever till I give you recognition

 I respect Assyria China Teutonia and the Hebrews
 I adopt each theory myth god and demigod
 I see that the old accounts bibles genealogies are true without
 exception
 I assert that all past days were what they must have been
 And that they could nohow have been better than they were
 And that today is what it must be and that America is
 And that today and America could nohow be better than they are

 3
 In the name of these States and in your and my name the Past
 And in the name of these States and in your and my name the Present time

 I know that the past was great and the future will be great
 And I know that both curiously conjoint in the present time
 For the sake of him I typify for the common average mans sake
 your sake if you are he
 And that where I am or you are this present day there is the centre
 of all days all races
 And there is the meaning to us of all that has ever come of races
 and days or ever will come




BOOK XVIII


A Broadway Pageant

 1
 Over the Western sea hither from Niphon come
 Courteous the swartcheekd twosworded envoys
 Leaning back in their open barouches bareheaded impassive
 Ride today through Manhattan

 Libertad I do not know whether others behold what I behold
 In the procession along with the nobles of Niphon the errandbearers
 Bringing up the rear hovering above around or in the ranks marching
 But I will sing you a song of what I behold Libertad

 When millionfooted Manhattan unpent descends to her pavements
 When the thundercracking guns arouse me with the proud roar love
 When the roundmouthd guns out of the smoke and smell I love
 spit their salutes
 When the fireflashing guns have fully alerted me and
 heavenclouds canopy my city with a delicate thin haze
 When gorgeous the countless straight stems the forests at the
 wharves thicken with colors
 When every ship richly drest carries her flag at the peak
 When pennants trail and streetfestoons hang from the windows
 When Broadway is entirely given up to footpassengers and
 footstanders when the mass is densest
 When the facades of the houses are alive with people when eyes
 gaze riveted tens of thousands at a time
 When the guests from the islands advance when the pageant moves
 forward visible
 When the summons is made when the answer that waited thousands
 of years answers
 I too arising answering descend to the pavements merge with the
 crowd and gaze with them

 2
 Superbfaced Manhattan
 Comrade Americanos to us then at last the Orient comes
 To us my city
 Where our talltopt marble and iron beauties range on opposite
 sides to walk in the space between
 Today our Antipodes comes

 The Originatress comes
 The nest of languages the bequeather of poems the race of eld
 Florid with blood pensive rapt with musings hot with passion
 Sultry with perfume with ample and flowing garments
 With sunburnt visage with intense soul and glittering eyes
 The race of Brahma comes

 See my cantabile these and more are flashing to us from the procession
 As it moves changing a kaleidoscope divine it moves changing before us


 For not the envoys nor the tannd Japanee from his island only
 Lithe and silent the Hindoo appears the Asiatic continent itself
 appears the past the dead
 The murky nightmorning of wonder and fable inscrutable
 The envelopd mysteries the old and unknown hivebees
 The north the sweltering south eastern Assyria the Hebrews the
 ancient of ancients
 Vast desolated cities the gliding present all of these and more
 are in the pageantprocession

 Geography the world is in it
 The Great Sea the brood of islands Polynesia the coast beyond
 The coast you henceforth are facingyou Libertad from your Western
 golden shores
 The countries there with their populations the millions enmasse
 are curiously here
 The swarming marketplaces the temples with idols ranged along the
 sides or at the end bonze brahmin and llama
 Mandarin farmer merchant mechanic and fisherman
 The singinggirl and the dancinggirl the ecstatic persons the
 secluded emperors
 Confucius himself the great poets and heroes the warriors the castes
 all
 Trooping up crowding from all directions from the Altay mountains
 From Thibet from the four winding and farflowing rivers of China
 From the southern peninsulas and the demicontinental islands from
 Malaysia
 These and whatever belongs to them palpable show forth to me and
 are seizd by me
 And I am seizd by them and friendlily held by them
 Till as here them all I chant Libertad for themselves and for you

 For I too raising my voice join the ranks of this pageant
 I am the chanter I chant aloud over the pageant
 I chant the world on my Western sea
 I chant copious the islands beyond thick as stars in the sky
 I chant the new empire grander than any before as in a vision it
 comes to me
 I chant America the mistress I chant a greater supremacy
 I chant projected a thousand blooming cities yet in time on those
 groups of seaislands
 My sailships and steamships threading the archipelagoes
 My stars and stripes fluttering in the wind
 Commerce opening the sleep of ages having done its work races
 reborn refreshd
 Lives works resumedthe object I know notbut the old the Asiatic
 renewd as it must be
 Commencing from this day surrounded by the world

 3
 And you Libertad of the world
 You shall sit in the middle wellpoisd thousands and thousands of years
 As today from one side the nobles of Asia come to you
 As tomorrow from the other side the queen of England sends her
 eldest son to you

 The sign is reversing the orb is enclosed
 The ring is circled the journey is done
 The boxlid is but perceptibly opend nevertheless the perfume
 pours copiously out of the whole box

 Young Libertad with the venerable Asia the allmother
 Be considerate with her now and ever hot Libertad for you are all
 Bend your proud neck to the longoff mother now sending messages
 over the archipelagoes to you
 Bend your proud neck low for once young Libertad

 Here the children straying westward so long so wide the tramping
 Were the precedent dim ages debouching westward from Paradise so long
 Were the centuries steadily footing it that way all the while
 unknown for you for reasons

 They are justified they are accomplishd they shall now be turnd
 the other way also to travel toward you thence
 They shall now also march obediently eastward for your sake Libertad




BOOK XIX SEADRIFT


Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking

 Out of the cradle endlessly rocking
 Out of the mockingbirds throat the musical shuttle
 Out of the Ninthmonth midnight
 Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond where the child
 leaving his bed wanderd alone bareheaded barefoot
 Down from the showerd halo
 Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they
 were alive
 Out from the patches of briers and blackberries
 From the memories of the bird that chanted to me
 From your memories sad brother from the fitful risings and fallings I heard
 From under that yellow halfmoon laterisen and swollen as if with tears
 From those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the mist
 From the thousand responses of my heart never to cease
 From the myriad thencearousd words
 From the word stronger and more delicious than any
 From such as now they start the scene revisiting
 As a flock twittering rising or overhead passing
 Borne hither ere all eludes me hurriedly
 A man yet by these tears a little boy again
 Throwing myself on the sand confronting the waves
 I chanter of pains and joys uniter of here and hereafter
 Taking all hints to use them but swiftly leaping beyond them
 A reminiscence sing

 Once Paumanok
 When the lilacscent was in the air and Fifthmonth grass was growing
 Up this seashore in some briers
 Two featherd guests from Alabama two together
 And their nest and four lightgreen eggs spotted with brown
 And every day the hebird to and fro near at hand
 And every day the shebird crouchd on her nest silent with bright eyes
 And every day I a curious boy never too close never disturbing
 them
 Cautiously peering absorbing translating

 Shine shine shine
 Pour down your warmth great sun
 While we bask we two together

 Two together
 Winds blow south or winds blow north
 Day come white or night come black
 Home or rivers and mountains from home
 Singing all time minding no time
 While we two keep together

 Till of a sudden
 Maybe killd unknown to her mate
 One forenoon the shebird crouchd not on the nest
 Nor returnd that afternoon nor the next
 Nor ever appeard again

 And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea
 And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather
 Over the hoarse surging of the sea
 Or flitting from brier to brier by day
 I saw I heard at intervals the remaining one the hebird
 The solitary guest from Alabama

 Blow blow blow
 Blow up seawinds along Paumanoks shore
 I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me

 Yes when the stars glistend
 All night long on the prong of a mossscallopd stake
 Down almost amid the slapping waves
 Sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears

 He calld on his mate
 He pourd forth the meanings which I of all men know

 Yes my brother I know
 The rest might not but I have treasurd every note
 For more than once dimly down to the beach gliding
 Silent avoiding the moonbeams blending myself with the shadows
 Recalling now the obscure shapes the echoes the sounds and sights
 after their sorts
 The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing
 I with bare feet a child the wind wafting my hair
 Listend long and long

 Listend to keep to sing now translating the notes
 Following you my brother

 Soothe soothe soothe
 Close on its wave soothes the wave behind
 And again another behind embracing and lapping every one close
 But my love soothes not me not me

 Low hangs the moon it rose late
 It is laggingO I think it is heavy with love with love

 O madly the sea pushes upon the land
 With love with love

 O night do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers
 What is that little black thing I see there in the white

 Loud loud loud
 Loud I call to you my love
 High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves
 Surely you must know who is here is here
 You must know who I am my love

 Lowhanging moon
 What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow
 O it is the shape the shape of my mate
 O moon do not keep her from me any longer

 Land land O land
 Whichever way I turn O I think you could give me my mate back again
 if you only would
 For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look

 O rising stars
 Perhaps the one I want so much will rise will rise with some of you

 O throat O trembling throat
 Sound clearer through the atmosphere
 Pierce the woods the earth
 Somewhere listening to catch you must be the one I want

 Shake out carols
 Solitary here the nights carols
 Carols of lonesome love deaths carols
 Carols under that lagging yellow waning moon
 O under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea
 O reckless despairing carols

 But soft sink low
 Soft let me just murmur
 And do you wait a moment you huskynoisd sea
 For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me
 So faint I must be still be still to listen
 But not altogether still for then she might not come immediately to me

 Hither my love
 Here I am here
 With this justsustaind note I announce myself to you
 This gentle call is for you my love for you

 Do not be decoyd elsewhere
 That is the whistle of the wind it is not my voice
 That is the fluttering the fluttering of the spray
 Those are the shadows of leaves

 O darkness O in vain
 O I am very sick and sorrowful

 O brown halo in the sky near the moon drooping upon the sea
 O troubled reflection in the sea
 O throat O throbbing heart
 And I singing uselessly uselessly all the night

 O past O happy life O songs of joy
 In the air in the woods over fields
 Loved loved loved loved loved
 But my mate no more no more with me
 We two together no more

 The aria sinking
 All else continuing the stars shining
 The winds blowing the notes of the bird continuous echoing
 With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning
 On the sands of Paumanoks shore gray and rustling
 The yellow halfmoon enlarged sagging down drooping the face of
 the sea almost touching
 The boy ecstatic with his bare feet the waves with his hair the
 atmosphere dallying
 The love in the heart long pent now loose now at last tumultuously
 bursting
 The arias meaning the ears the soul swiftly depositing
 The strange tears down the cheeks coursing
 The colloquy there the trio each uttering
 The undertone the savage old mother incessantly crying
 To the boys souls questions sullenly timing some drownd secret hissing
 To the outsetting bard

 Demon or bird said the boys soul
 Is it indeed toward your mate you sing or is it really to me
 For I that was a child my tongues use sleeping now I have heard you
 Now in a moment I know what I am for I awake
 And already a thousand singers a thousand songs clearer louder
 and more sorrowful than yours
 A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me never to die

 O you singer solitary singing by yourself projecting me
 O solitary me listening never more shall I cease perpetuating you
 Never more shall I escape never more the reverberations
 Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me
 Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what
 there in the night
 By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon
 The messenger there arousd the fire the sweet hell within
 The unknown want the destiny of me

 O give me the clue it lurks in the night here somewhere
 O if I am to have so much let me have more

 A word then for I will conquer it
 The word final superior to all
 Subtle sent upwhat is itI listen
 Are you whispering it and have been all the time you seawaves
 Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands

 Whereto answering the sea
 Delaying not hurrying not
 Whisperd me through the night and very plainly before daybreak
 Lispd to me the low and delicious word death
 And again death death death death
 Hissing melodious neither like the bird nor like my arousd childs heart
 But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet
 Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over
 Death death death death death

 Which I do not forget
 But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother
 That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanoks gray beach
 With the thousand responsive songs at random
 My own songs awaked from that hour
 And with them the key the word up from the waves
 The word of the sweetest song and all songs
 That strong and delicious word which creeping to my feet
 Or like some old crone rocking the cradle swathed in sweet
 garments bending aside
 The sea whisperd me




As I Ebbd with the Ocean of Life

 1
 As I ebbd with the ocean of life
 As I wended the shores I know
 As I walkd where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok
 Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant
 Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways
 I musing late in the autumn day gazing off southward
 Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems
 Was seizd by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot
 The rim the sediment that stands for all the water and all the land
 of the globe

 Fascinated my eyes reverting from the south dropt to follow those
 slender windrows
 Chaff straw splinters of wood weeds and the seagluten
 Scum scales from shining rocks leaves of saltlettuce left by the tide
 Miles walking the sound of breaking waves the other side of me
 Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses
 These you presented to me you fishshaped island
 As I wended the shores I know
 As I walkd with that electric self seeking types

 2
 As I wend to the shores I know not
 As I list to the dirge the voices of men and women wreckd
 As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me
 As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer
 I too but signify at the utmost a little washdup drift
 A few sands and dead leaves to gather
 Gather and merge myself as part of the sands and drift

 O baffled balkd bent to the very earth
 Oppressd with myself that I have dared to open my mouth
 Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me I have
 not once had the least idea who or what I am
 But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet
 untouchd untold altogether unreachd
 Withdrawn far mocking me with mockcongratulatory signs and bows
 With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written
 Pointing in silence to these songs and then to the sand beneath

 I perceive I have not really understood any thing not a single
 object and that no man ever can
 Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon
 me and sting me
 Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all

 3
 You oceans both I close with you
 We murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift knowing not why
 These little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all

 You friable shore with trails of debris
 You fishshaped island I take what is underfoot
 What is yours is mine my father

 I too Paumanok
 I too have bubbled up floated the measureless float and been
 washd on your shores
 I too am but a trail of drift and debris
 I too leave little wrecks upon you you fishshaped island

 I throw myself upon your breast my father
 I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me
 I hold you so firm till you answer me something

 Kiss me my father
 Touch me with your lips as I touch those I love
 Breathe to me while I hold you close the secret of the murmuring I envy

 4
 Ebb ocean of life the flow will return
 Cease not your moaning you fierce old mother
 Endlessly cry for your castaways but fear not deny not me
 Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as I touch you or
 gather from you

 I mean tenderly by you and all
 I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we lead
 and following me and mine

 Me and mine loose windrows little corpses
 Froth snowy white and bubbles
 See from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last
 See the prismatic colors glistening and rolling
 Tufts of straw sands fragments
 Buoyd hither from many moods one contradicting another
 From the storm the long calm the darkness the swell
 Musing pondering a breath a briny tear a dab of liquid or soil
 Up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown
 A limp blossom or two torn just as much over waves floating
 drifted at random
 Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature
 Just as much whence we come that blare of the cloudtrumpets
 We capricious brought hither we know not whence spread out before you
 You up there walking or sitting
 Whoever you are we too lie in drifts at your feet




Tears

 Tears tears tears
 In the night in solitude tears
 On the white shore dripping dripping suckd in by the sand
 Tears not a star shining all dark and desolate
 Moist tears from the eyes of a muffled head
 O who is that ghost that form in the dark with tears
 What shapeless lump is that bent crouchd there on the sand
 Streaming tears sobbing tears throes choked with wild cries
 O storm embodied rising careering with swift steps along the beach
 O wild and dismal night storm with windO belching and desperate
 O shade so sedate and decorous by day with calm countenance and
 regulated pace
 But away at night as you fly none lookingO then the unloosend ocean
 Of tears tears tears




To the ManofWarBird

 Thou who hast slept all night upon the storm
 Waking renewd on thy prodigious pinions
 Burst the wild storm above it thou ascendedst
 And rested on the sky thy slave that cradled thee
 Now a blue point far far in heaven floating
 As to the light emerging here on deck I watch thee
 Myself a speck a point on the worlds floating vast

 Far far at sea
 After the nights fierce drifts have strewn the shore with wrecks
 With reappearing day as now so happy and serene
 The rosy and elastic dawn the flashing sun
 The limpid spread of air cerulean
 Thou also reappearest

 Thou born to match the gale thou art all wings
 To cope with heaven and earth and sea and hurricane
 Thou ship of air that never furlst thy sails
 Days even weeks untired and onward through spaces realms gyrating
 At dusk that lookist on Senegal at morn America
 That sportst amid the lightningflash and thundercloud
 In them in thy experiences hadst thou my soul
 What joys what joys were thine




Aboard at a Ships Helm

 Aboard at a ships helm
 A young steersman steering with care

 Through fog on a seacoast dolefully ringing
 An oceanbellO a warning bell rockd by the waves

 O you give good notice indeed you bell by the seareefs ringing
 Ringing ringing to warn the ship from its wreckplace

 For as on the alert O steersman you mind the loud admonition
 The bows turn the freighted ship tacking speeds away under her gray sails
 The beautiful and noble ship with all her precious wealth speeds
 away gayly and safe

 But O the ship the immortal ship O ship aboard the ship
 Ship of the body ship of the soul voyaging voyaging voyaging




On the Beach at Night

 On the beach at night
 Stands a child with her father
 Watching the east the autumn sky

 Up through the darkness
 While ravening clouds the burial clouds in black masses spreading
 Lower sullen and fast athwart and down the sky
 Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east
 Ascends large and calm the lordstar Jupiter
 And nigh at hand only a very little above
 Swim the delicate sisters the Pleiades

 From the beach the child holding the hand of her father
 Those burialclouds that lower victorious soon to devour all
 Watching silently weeps

 Weep not child
 Weep not my darling
 With these kisses let me remove your tears
 The ravening clouds shall not long be victorious
 They shall not long possess the sky they devour the stars only in
 apparition
 Jupiter shall emerge be patient watch again another night the
 Pleiades shall emerge
 They are immortal all those stars both silvery and golden shall
 shine out again
 The great stars and the little ones shall shine out again they endure
 The vast immortal suns and the longenduring pensive moons shall
 again shine

 Then dearest child mournest thou only for jupiter
 Considerest thou alone the burial of the stars

 Something there is
 With my lips soothing thee adding I whisper
 I give thee the first suggestion the problem and indirection
 Something there is more immortal even than the stars
 Many the burials many the days and nights passing away
 Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous Jupiter
 Longer than sun or any revolving satellite
 Or the radiant sisters the Pleiades




The World below the Brine

 The world below the brine
 Forests at the bottom of the sea the branches and leaves
 Sealettuce vast lichens strange flowers and seeds the thick
 tangle openings and pink turf
 Different colors pale gray and green purple white and gold the
 play of light through the water
 Dumb swimmers there among the rocks coral gluten grass rushes
 and the aliment of the swimmers
 Sluggish existences grazing there suspended or slowly crawling
 close to the bottom
 The spermwhale at the surface blowing air and spray or disporting
 with his flukes
 The leadeneyed shark the walrus the turtle the hairy
 sealeopard and the stingray
 Passions there wars pursuits tribes sight in those oceandepths
 breathing that thickbreathing air as so many do
 The change thence to the sight here and to the subtle air breathed
 by beings like us who walk this sphere
 The change onward from ours to that of beings who walk other spheres




On the Beach at Night Alone

 On the beach at night alone
 As the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song
 As I watch the bright stars shining I think a thought of the clef
 of the universes and of the future

 A vast similitude interlocks all
 All spheres grown ungrown small large suns moons planets
 All distances of place however wide
 All distances of time all inanimate forms
 All souls all living bodies though they be ever so different or in
 different worlds
 All gaseous watery vegetable mineral processes the fishes the brutes
 All nations colors barbarisms civilizations languages
 All identities that have existed or may exist on this globe or any globe
 All lives and deaths all of the past present future
 This vast similitude spans them and always has spannd
 And shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them




Song for All Seas All Ships

 1
 Today a rude brief recitative
 Of ships sailing the seas each with its special flag or shipsignal
 Of unnamed heroes in the shipsof waves spreading and spreading
 far as the eye can reach
 Of dashing spray and the winds piping and blowing
 And out of these a chant for the sailors of all nations
 Fitful like a surge

 Of seacaptains young or old and the mates and of all intrepid sailors
 Of the few very choice taciturn whom fate can never surprise nor
 death dismay
 Pickd sparingly without noise by thee old ocean chosen by thee
 Thou sea that pickest and cullest the race in time and unitest nations
 Suckled by thee old husky nurse embodying thee
 Indomitable untamed as thee

 Ever the heroes on water or on land by ones or twos appearing
 Ever the stock preservd and never lost though rare enough for
 seed preservd

 2
 Flaunt out O sea your separate flags of nations
 Flaunt out visible as ever the various shipsignals
 But do you reserve especially for yourself and for the soul of man
 one flag above all the rest
 A spiritual woven signal for all nations emblem of man elate above death
 Token of all brave captains and all intrepid sailors and mates
 And all that went down doing their duty
 Reminiscent of them twined from all intrepid captains young or old
 A pennant universal subtly waving all time oer all brave sailors
 All seas all ships




Patroling Barnegat

 Wild wild the storm and the sea high running
 Steady the roar of the gale with incessant undertone muttering
 Shouts of demoniac laughter fitfully piercing and pealing
 Waves air midnight their savagest trinity lashing
 Out in the shadows there milkwhite combs careering
 On beachy slush and sand spirts of snow fierce slanting
 Where through the murk the easterly deathwind breasting
 Through cutting swirl and spray watchful and firm advancing
 That in the distance is that a wreck is the red signal flaring
 Slush and sand of the beach tireless till daylight wending
 Steadily slowly through hoarse roar never remitting
 Along the midnight edge by those milkwhite combs careering
 A group of dim weird forms struggling the night confronting
 That savage trinity warily watching




After the SeaShip

 After the seaship after the whistling winds
 After the whitegray sails taut to their spars and ropes
 Below a myriad myriad waves hastening lifting up their necks
 Tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship
 Waves of the ocean bubbling and gurgling blithely prying
 Waves undulating waves liquid uneven emulous waves
 Toward that whirling current laughing and buoyant with curves
 Where the great vessel sailing and tacking displaced the surface
 Larger and smaller waves in the spread of the ocean yearnfully flowing
 The wake of the seaship after she passes flashing and frolicsome
 under the sun
 A motley procession with many a fleck of foam and many fragments
 Following the stately and rapid ship in the wake following




BOOK XX BY THE ROADSIDE


A Boston Ballad 1854

 To get betimes in Boston town I rose this morning early
 Heres a good place at the corner I must stand and see the show

 Clear the way there Jonathan
 Way for the Presidents marshalway for the government cannon
 Way for the Federal foot and dragoons and the apparitions
 copiously tumbling

 I love to look on the Stars and Stripes I hope the fifes will play
 Yankee Doodle
 How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops
 Every man holds his revolver marching stiff through Boston town

 A fog follows antiques of the same come limping
 Some appear woodenlegged and some appear bandaged and bloodless

 Why this is indeed a showit has called the dead out of the earth
 The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see
 Phantoms phantoms countless by flank and rear
 Cockd hats of mothy mouldcrutches made of mist
 Arms in slingsold men leaning on young mens shoulders

 What troubles you Yankee phantoms what is all this chattering of
 bare gums
 Does the ague convulse your limbs do you mistake your crutches for
 firelocks and level them

 If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the Presidents marshal
 If you groan such groans you might balk the government cannon

 For shame old maniacsbring down those tossd arms and let your
 white hair be
 Here gape your great grandsons their wives gaze at them from the windows
 See how well dressd see how orderly they conduct themselves

 Worse and worsecant you stand it are you retreating
 Is this hour with the living too dead for you

 Retreat thenpellmell
 To your gravesbackback to the hills old limpers
 I do not think you belong here anyhow

 But there is one thing that belongs hereshall I tell you what it
 is gentlemen of Boston

 I will whisper it to the Mayor he shall send a committee to England
 They shall get a grant from the Parliament go with a cart to the
 royal vault
 Dig out King Georges coffin unwrap him quick from the
 graveclothes box up his bones for a journey
 Find a swift Yankee clipperhere is freight for you blackbellied clipper
 Up with your anchorshake out your sailssteer straight toward
 Boston bay

 Now call for the Presidents marshal again bring out the government cannon
 Fetch home the roarers from Congress make another procession
 guard it with foot and dragoons

 This centrepiece for them
 Look all orderly citizenslook from the windows women

 The committee open the box set up the regal ribs glue those that
 will not stay
 Clap the skull on top of the ribs and clap a crown on top of the skull
 You have got your revenge old busterthe crown is come to its own
 and more than its own

 Stick your hands in your pockets Jonathanyou are a made man from
 this day
 You are mighty cuteand here is one of your bargains




Europe The 72d and 73d Years of These States

 Suddenly out of its stale and drowsy lair the lair of slaves
 Like lightning it lept forth half startled at itself
 Its feet upon the ashes and the rags its hands tight to the throats
 of kings

 O hope and faith
 O aching close of exiled patriots lives
 O many a sickend heart
 Turn back unto this day and make yourselves afresh

 And you paid to defile the Peopleyou liars mark
 Not for numberless agonies murders lusts
 For court thieving in its manifold mean forms worming from his
 simplicity the poor mans wages
 For many a promise sworn by royal lips and broken and laughd at in
 the breaking

 Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge
 or the heads of the nobles fall
 The People scornd the ferocity of kings

 But the sweetness of mercy brewd bitter destruction and the
 frightend monarchs come back
 Each comes in state with his train hangman priest taxgatherer
 Soldier lawyer lord jailer and sycophant

 Yet behind all lowering stealing lo a shape
 Vague as the night draped interminably head front and form in
 scarlet folds
 Whose face and eyes none may see
 Out of its robes only this the red robes lifted by the arm
 One finger crookd pointed high over the top like the head of a
 snake appears

 Meanwhile corpses lie in newmade graves bloody corpses of young men
 The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily the bullets of princes are
 flying the creatures of power laugh aloud
 And all these things bear fruits and they are good

 Those corpses of young men
 Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets those hearts piercd by
 the gray lead
 Cold and motionless as they seem live elsewhere with unslaughterd vitality

 They live in other young men O kings
 They live in brothers again ready to defy you
 They were purified by death they were taught and exalted

 Not a grave of the murderd for freedom but grows seed for freedom
 in its turn to bear seed
 Which the winds carry afar and resow and the rains and the snows nourish

 Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose
 But it stalks invisibly over the earth whispering counseling cautioning
 Liberty let others despair of youI never despair of you

 Is the house shut is the master away
 Nevertheless be ready be not weary of watching
 He will soon return his messengers come anon




A HandMirror

 Hold it up sternlysee this it sends back who is it is it you
 Outside fair costume within ashes and filth
 No more a flashing eye no more a sonorous voice or springy step
 Now some slaves eye voice hands step
 A drunkards breath unwholesome eaters face venerealees flesh
 Lungs rotting away piecemeal stomach sour and cankerous
 Joints rheumatic bowels clogged with abomination
 Blood circulating dark and poisonous streams
 Words babble hearing and touch callous
 No brain no heart left no magnetism of sex
 Such from one look in this lookingglass ere you go hence
 Such a result so soonand from such a beginning




Gods

 Lover divine and perfect Comrade
 Waiting content invisible yet but certain
 Be thou my God

 Thou thou the Ideal Man
 Fair able beautiful content and loving
 Complete in body and dilate in spirit
 Be thou my God

 O Death for Life has served its turn
 Opener and usher to the heavenly mansion
 Be thou my God

 Aught aught of mightiest best I see conceive or know
 To break the stagnant tiethee thee to free O soul
 Be thou my God

 All great ideas the races aspirations
 All heroisms deeds of rapt enthusiasts
 Be ye my Gods

 Or Time and Space
 Or shape of Earth divine and wondrous
 Or some fair shape I viewing worship
 Or lustrous orb of sun or star by night
 Be ye my Gods




Germs

 Forms qualities lives humanity language thoughts
 The ones known and the ones unknown the ones on the stars
 The stars themselves some shaped others unshaped
 Wonders as of those countries the soil trees cities inhabitants
 whatever they may be
 Splendid suns the moons and rings the countless combinations and effects
 Suchlike and as good as suchlike visible here or anywhere stand
 provided for a handful of space which I extend my arm and
 half enclose with my hand
 That containing the start of each and all the virtue the germs of all




Thoughts

 Of ownershipas if one fit to own things could not at pleasure enter
 upon all and incorporate them into himself or herself
 Of vistasuppose some sight in arriere through the formative chaos
 presuming the growth fulness life now attaind on the journey
 But I see the road continued and the journey ever continued
 Of what was once lacking on earth and in due time has become
 suppliedand of what will yet be supplied
 Because all I see and know I believe to have its main purport in
 what will yet be supplied



When I Heard the Learnd Astronomer

 When I heard the learnd astronomer
 When the proofs the figures were ranged in columns before me
 When I was shown the charts and diagrams to add divide and measure them
 When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much
 applause in the lectureroom
 How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick
 Till rising and gliding out I wanderd off by myself
 In the mystical moist nightair and from time to time
 Lookd up in perfect silence at the stars




Perfections

 Only themselves understand themselves and the like of themselves
 As souls only understand souls




O Me O Life

 O me O life of the questions of these recurring
 Of the endless trains of the faithless of cities filld with the foolish
 Of myself forever reproaching myself for who more foolish than I
 and who more faithless
 Of eyes that vainly crave the light of the objects mean of the
 struggle ever renewd
 Of the poor results of all of the plodding and sordid crowds I see
 around me
 Of the empty and useless years of the rest with the rest me intertwined
 The question O me so sad recurringWhat good amid these O me O life

 Answer
 That you are herethat life exists and identity
 That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse




To a President

 All you are doing and saying is to America dangled mirages
 You have not learnd of Natureof the politics of Nature you have
 not learnd the great amplitude rectitude impartiality
 You have not seen that only such as they are for these States
 And that what is less than they must sooner or later lift off from
 these States




I Sit and Look Out

 I sit and look out upon all the sorrows of the world and upon all
 oppression and shame
 I hear secret convulsive sobs from young men at anguish with
 themselves remorseful after deeds done
 I see in low life the mother misused by her children dying
 neglected gaunt desperate
 I see the wife misused by her husband I see the treacherous seducer
 of young women
 I mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love attempted to be
 hid I see these sights on the earth
 I see the workings of battle pestilence tyranny I see martyrs and
 prisoners
 I observe a famine at sea I observe the sailors casting lots who
 shall be killd to preserve the lives of the rest
 I observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons upon
 laborers the poor and upon negroes and the like
 All theseall the meanness and agony without end I sitting look out upon
 See hear and am silent




To Rich Givers

 What you give me I cheerfully accept
 A little sustenance a hut and garden a little money as I
 rendezvous with my poems
 A travelers lodging and breakfast as journey through the States
 why should I be ashamed to own such gifts why to advertise for them
 For I myself am not one who bestows nothing upon man and woman
 For I bestow upon any man or woman the entrance to all the gifts of
 the universe




The Dalliance of the Eagles

 Skirting the river road my forenoon walk my rest
 Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound the dalliance of the eagles
 The rushing amorous contact high in space together
 The clinching interlocking claws a living fierce gyrating wheel
 Four beating wings two beaks a swirling mass tight grappling
 In tumbling turning clustering loops straight downward falling
 Till oer the river poisd the twain yet one a moments lull
 A motionless still balance in the air then parting talons loosing
 Upward again on slowfirm pinions slanting their separate diverse flight
 She hers he his pursuing




Roaming in Thought After reading Hegel

 Roaming in thought over the Universe I saw the little that is Good
 steadily hastening towards immortality
 And the vast all that is calld Evil I saw hastening to merge itself
 and become lost and dead




A Farm Picture

 Through the ample open door of the peaceful country barn
 A sunlit pasture field with cattle and horses feeding
 And haze and vista and the far horizon fading away




A Childs Amaze

 Silent and amazed even when a little boy
 I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his statements
 As contending against some being or influence




The Runner

 On a flat road runs the welltraind runner
 He is lean and sinewy with muscular legs
 He is thinly clothed he leans forward as he runs
 With lightly closed fists and arms partially raisd




Beautiful Women

 Women sit or move to and fro some old some young
 The young are beautifulbut the old are more beautiful than the young




Mother and Babe

 I see the sleeping babe nestling the breast of its mother
 The sleeping mother and babehushd I study them long and long




Thought

 Of obedience faith adhesiveness
 As I stand aloof and look there is to me something profoundly
 affecting in large masses of men following the lead of those who
 do not believe in men




Visord

 A mask a perpetual natural disguiser of herself
 Concealing her face concealing her form
 Changes and transformations every hour every moment
 Falling upon her even when she sleeps




Thought

 Of justiceas If could be any thing but the same ample law
 expounded by natural judges and saviors
 As if it might be this thing or that thing according to decisions




Gliding Oer all

 Gliding oer all through all
 Through Nature Time and Space
 As a ship on the waters advancing
 The voyage of the soulnot life alone
 Death many deaths Ill sing




Hast Never Come to Thee an Hour

 Hast never come to thee an hour
 A sudden gleam divine precipitating bursting all these bubbles
 fashions wealth
 These eager business aimsbooks politics art amours
 To utter nothingness




Thought

 Of Equalityas if it harmd me giving others the same chances and
 rights as myselfas if it were not indispensable to my own
 rights that others possess the same




To Old Age

 I see in you the estuary that enlarges and spreads itself grandly as
 it pours in the great sea




Locations and Times

 Locations and timeswhat is it in me that meets them all whenever
 and wherever and makes me at home
 Forms colors densities odorswhat is it in me that corresponds
 with them




Offerings

 A thousand perfect men and women appear
 Around each gathers a cluster of friends and gay children and
 youths with offerings




To The States To Identify the 16th 17th or 18th Presidentiad

 Why reclining interrogating why myself and all drowsing
 What deepening twilightscum floating atop of the waters
 Who are they as bats and nightdogs askant in the capitol
 What a filthy Presidentiad O South your torrid suns O North
 your arctic freezings
 Are those really Congressmen are those the great Judges is that
 the President
 Then I will sleep awhile yet for I see that these States sleep for
 reasons
 With gathering murk with muttering thunder and lambent shoots we
 all duly awake
 South North East West inland and seaboard we will surely awake




BOOK XXI DRUMTAPS


First O Songs for a Prelude

 First O songs for a prelude
 Lightly strike on the stretchd tympanum pride and joy in my city
 How she led the rest to arms how she gave the cue
 How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang
 O superb O Manhattan my own my peerless
 O strongest you in the hour of danger in crisis O truer than steel
 How you spranghow you threw off the costumes of peace with
 indifferent hand
 How your soft operamusic changed and the drum and fife were heard
 in their stead
 How you led to the war that shall serve for our prelude songs of
 soldiers
 How Manhattan drumtaps led

 Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading
 Forty years as a pageant till unawares the lady of this teeming and
 turbulent city
 Sleepless amid her ships her houses her incalculable wealth
 With her million children around her suddenly
 At dead of night at news from the south
 Incensd struck with clinchd hand the pavement

 A shock electric the night sustaind it
 Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pourd out its myriads

 From the houses then and the workshops and through all the doorways
 Leapt they tumultuous and lo Manhattan arming

 To the drumtaps prompt
 The young men falling in and arming
 The mechanics arming the trowel the jackplane the blacksmiths
 hammer tost aside with precipitation
 The lawyer leaving his office and arming the judge leaving the court
 The driver deserting his wagon in the street jumping down throwing
 the reins abruptly down on the horses backs
 The salesman leaving the store the boss bookkeeper porter all leaving
 Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm
 The new recruits even boys the old men show them how to wear their
 accoutrements they buckle the straps carefully
 Outdoors arming indoors arming the flash of the musketbarrels
 The white tents cluster in camps the armd sentries around the
 sunrise cannon and again at sunset
 Armd regiments arrive every day pass through the city and embark
 from the wharves
 How good they look as they tramp down to the river sweaty with
 their guns on their shoulders
 How I love them how I could hug them with their brown faces and
 their clothes and knapsacks coverd with dust
 The blood of the city uparmd armd the cry everywhere
 The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the
 public buildings and stores
 The tearful parting the mother kisses her son the son kisses his mother
 Loth is the mother to part yet not a word does she speak to detain him
 The tumultuous escort the ranks of policemen preceding clearing the way
 The unpent enthusiasm the wild cheers of the crowd for their favorites
 The artillery the silent cannons bright as gold drawn along
 rumble lightly over the stones
 Silent cannons soon to cease your silence
 Soon unlimberd to begin the red business
 All the mutter of preparation all the determind arming
 The hospital service the lint bandages and medicines
 The women volunteering for nurses the work begun for in earnest no
 mere parade now
 War an armd race is advancing the welcome for battle no turning away
 War be it weeks months or years an armd race is advancing to
 welcome it

 Mannahatta amarchand its O to sing it well
 Its O for a manly life in the camp

 And the sturdy artillery
 The guns bright as gold the work for giants to serve well the guns
 Unlimber them no more as the past forty years for salutes for
 courtesies merely
 Put in something now besides powder and wadding

 And you lady of ships you Mannahatta
 Old matron of this proud friendly turbulent city
 Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frownd amid
 all your children
 But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta




Eighteen SixtyOne

 Armd yearyear of the struggle
 No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you terrible year
 Not you as some pale poetling seated at a desk lisping cadenzas piano
 But as a strong man erect clothed in blue clothes advancing
 carrying rifle on your shoulder
 With wellgristled body and sunburnt face and hands with a knife in
 the belt at your side
 As I heard you shouting loud your sonorous voice ringing across the
 continent
 Your masculine voice O year as rising amid the great cities
 Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen the
 dwellers in Manhattan
 Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and Indiana
 Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the Allghanies
 Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania or on deck along
 the Ohio river
 Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers or at
 Chattanooga on the mountain top
 Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue bearing
 weapons robust year
 Heard your determind voice launchd forth again and again
 Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the roundlippd cannon
 I repeat you hurrying crashing sad distracted year




Beat Beat Drums

 Beat beat drumsblow bugles blow
 Through the windowsthrough doorsburst like a ruthless force
 Into the solemn church and scatter the congregation
 Into the school where the scholar is studying
 Leave not the bridegroom quietno happiness must he have now with
 his bride
 Nor the peaceful farmer any peace ploughing his field or gathering
 his grain
 So fierce you whirr and pound you drumsso shrill you bugles blow

 Beat beat drumsblow bugles blow
 Over the traffic of citiesover the rumble of wheels in the streets
 Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses no sleepers
 must sleep in those beds
 No bargainers bargains by dayno brokers or speculatorswould
 they continue
 Would the talkers be talking would the singer attempt to sing
 Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge
 Then rattle quicker heavier drumsyou bugles wilder blow

 Beat beat drumsblow bugles blow
 Make no parleystop for no expostulation
 Mind not the timidmind not the weeper or prayer
 Mind not the old man beseeching the young man
 Let not the childs voice be heard nor the mothers entreaties
 Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the
 hearses
 So strong you thump O terrible drumsso loud you bugles blow




From Paumanok Starting I Fly Like a Bird

 From Paumanok starting I fly like a bird
 Around and around to soar to sing the idea of all
 To the north betaking myself to sing there arctic songs
 To Kanada till I absorb Kanada in myself to Michigan then
 To Wisconsin Iowa Minnesota to sing their songs they are inimitable
 Then to Ohio and Indiana to sing theirs to Missouri and Kansas and
 Arkansas to sing theirs
 To Tennessee and Kentucky to the Carolinas and Georgia to sing theirs
 To Texas and so along up toward California to roam accepted everywhere
 To sing first to the tap of the wardrum if need be
 The idea of all of the Western world one and inseparable
 And then the song of each member of these States




Song of the Banner at Daybreak

 Poet
 O A new song a free song
 Flapping flapping flapping flapping by sounds by voices clearer
 By the winds voice and that of the drum
 By the banners voice and childs voice and seas voice and fathers voice
 Low on the ground and high in the air
 On the ground where father and child stand
 In the upward air where their eyes turn
 Where the banner at daybreak is flapping

 Words bookwords what are you
 Words no more for hearken and see
 My song is there in the open air and I must sing
 With the banner and pennant aflapping

 Ill weave the chord and twine in
 Mans desire and babes desire Ill twine them in Ill put in life
 Ill put the bayonets flashing point Ill let bullets and slugs whizz
 As one carrying a symbol and menace far into the future
 Crying with trumpet voice Arouse and beware Beware and arouse
 Ill pour the verse with streams of blood full of volition full of joy
 Then loosen launch forth to go and compete
 With the banner and pennant aflapping

 Pennant
 Come up here bard bard
 Come up here soul soul
 Come up here dear little child
 To fly in the clouds and winds with me and play with the measureless light

 Child
 Father what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger
 And what does it say to me all the while

 Father
 Nothing my babe you see in the sky
 And nothing at all to you it saysbut look you my babe
 Look at these dazzling things in the houses and see you the money
 shops opening
 And see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with goods
 These ah these how valued and toild for these
 How envied by all the earth

 Poet
 Fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high
 On floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels
 On floats the wind over the breast of the sea setting in toward land
 The great steady wind from west or westbysouth
 Floating so buoyant with milkwhite foam on the waters

 But I am not the sea nor the red sun
 I am not the wind with girlish laughter
 Not the immense wind which strengthens not the wind which lashes
 Not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death
 But I am that which unseen comes and sings sings sings
 Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land
 Which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings
 And the shoresands know and the hissing wave and that banner and pennant
 Aloft there flapping and flapping

 Child
 O father it is aliveit is full of peopleit has children
 O now it seems to me it is talking to its children
 I hear itit talks to meO it is wonderful
 O it stretchesit spreads and runs so fastO my father
 It is so broad it covers the whole sky

 Father
 Cease cease my foolish babe
 What you are saying is sorrowful to me much t displeases me
 Behold with the rest again I say behold not banners and pennants aloft
 But the wellprepared pavements behold and mark the solidwalld houses

 Banner and Pennant
 Speak to the child O bard out of Manhattan
 To our children all or north or south of Manhattan
 Point this day leaving all the rest to us over alland yet we know
 not why
 For what are we mere strips of cloth profiting nothing
 Only flapping in the wind


 Poet
 I hear and see not strips of cloth alone
 I hear the tramp of armies I hear the challenging sentry
 I hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men I hear Liberty
 I hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing
 I myself move abroad swiftrising flying then
 I use the wings of the landbird and use the wings of the seabird
 and look down as from a height
 I do not deny the precious results of peace I see populous cities
 with wealth incalculable
 I see numberless farms I see the farmers working in their fields or barns
 I see mechanics working I see buildings everywhere founded going
 up or finishd
 I see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks drawn by
 the locomotives
 I see the stores depots of Boston Baltimore Charleston New Orleans
 I see far in the West the immense area of grain I dwell awhile hovering
 I pass to the lumber forests of the North and again to the Southern
 plantation and again to California
 Sweeping the whole I see the countless profit the busy gatherings
 earnd wages
 See the Identity formed out of thirtyeight spacious and haughty
 States and many more to come
 See forts on the shores of harbors see ships sailing in and out
 Then over all aye aye my little and lengthend pennant shaped
 like a sword
 Runs swiftly up indicating war and defianceand now the halyards
 have raisd it
 Side of my banner broad and blue side of my starry banner
 Discarding peace over all the sea and land

 Banner and Pennant
 Yet louder higher stronger bard yet farther wider cleave
 No longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone
 We may be terror and carnage and are so now
 Not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty States nor
 any five nor ten
 Nor market nor depot we nor moneybank in the city
 But these and all and the brown and spreading land and the mines
 below are ours
 And the shores of the sea are ours and the rivers great and small
 And the fields they moisten and the crops and the fruits are ours
 Bays and channels and ships sailing in and out are ourswhile we over all
 Over the area spread below the three or four millions of square
 miles the capitals
 The forty millions of peopleO bard in life and death supreme
 We even we henceforth flaunt out masterful high up above
 Not for the present alone for a thousand years chanting through you
 This song to the soul of one poor little child

 Child
 O my father I like not the houses
 They will never to me be any thing nor do I like money
 But to mount up there I would like O father dear that banner I like
 That pennant I would be and must be

 Father
 Child of mine you fill me with anguish
 To be that pennant would be too fearful
 Little you know what it is this day and after this day forever
 It is to gain nothing but risk and defy every thing
 Forward to stand in front of warsand O such warswhat have you
 to do with them
 With passions of demons slaughter premature death

 Banner
 Demons and death then I sing
 Put in all aye all will I swordshaped pennant for war
 And a pleasure new and ecstatic and the prattled yearning of children
 Blent with the sounds of the peaceful land and the liquid wash of the sea
 And the black ships fighting on the sea envelopd in smoke
 And the icy cool of the far far north with rustling cedars and pines
 And the whirr of drums and the sound of soldiers marching and the
 hot sun shining south
 And the beachwaves combing over the beach on my Eastern shore
 and my Western shore the same
 And all between those shores and my ever running Mississippi with
 bends and chutes
 And my Illinois fields and my Kansas fields and my fields of Missouri
 The Continent devoting the whole identity without reserving an atom
 Pour in whelm that which asks which sings with all and the yield of all
 Fusing and holding claiming devouring the whole
 No more with tender lip nor musical labial sound
 But out of the night emerging for good our voice persuasive no more
 Croaking like crows here in the wind

 Poet
 My limbs my veins dilate my theme is clear at last
 Banner so broad advancing out of the night I sing you haughty and resolute
 I burst through where I waited long too long deafend and blinded
 My hearing and tongue are come to me a little child taught me
 I hear from above O pennant of war your ironical call and demand
 Insensate insensate yet I at any rate chant you O banner
 Not houses of peace indeed are you nor any nor all their
 prosperity if need be you shall again have every one of those
 houses to destroy them
 You thought not to destroy those valuable houses standing fast
 full of comfort built with money
 May they stand fast then not an hour except you above them and all
 stand fast
 O banner not money so precious are you not farm produce you nor
 the material good nutriment
 Nor excellent stores nor landed on wharves from the ships
 Not the superb ships with sailpower or steampower fetching and
 carrying cargoes
 Nor machinery vehicles trade nor revenuesbut you as henceforth
 I see you
 Running up out of the night bringing your cluster of stars
 everenlarging stars
 Divider of daybreak you cutting the air touchd by the sun
 measuring the sky
 Passionately seen and yearnd for by one poor little child
 While others remain busy or smartly talking forever teaching
 thrift thrift
 O you up there O pennant where you undulate like a snake hissing
 so curious
 Out of reach an idea only yet furiously fought for risking bloody
 death loved by me
 So lovedO you banner leading the day with stars brought from the night
 Valueless object of eyes over all and demanding allabsolute
 owner of allO banner and pennant
 I too leave the restgreat as it is it is nothinghouses machines
 are nothingI see them not
 I see but you O warlike pennant O banner so broad with stripes
 sing you only
 Flapping up there in the wind




Rise O Days from Your Fathomless Deeps

 1
 Rise O days from your fathomless deeps till you loftier fiercer sweep
 Long for my soul hungering gymnastic I devourd what the earth gave me
 Long I roamd amid the woods of the north long I watchd Niagara pouring
 I traveld the prairies over and slept on their breast I crossd
 the Nevadas I crossd the plateaus
 I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific I saild out to sea
 I saild through the storm I was refreshd by the storm
 I watchd with joy the threatening maws of the waves

 I markd the white combs where they careerd so high curling over
 I heard the wind piping I saw the black clouds
 Saw from below what arose and mounted O superb O wild as my
 heart and powerful
 Heard the continuous thunder as it bellowd after the lightning
 Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and
 fast amid the din they chased each other across the sky
 These and such as these I elate sawsaw with wonder yet pensive
 and masterful
 All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me
 Yet there with my soul I fed I fed content supercilious

 2
 Twas well O soultwas a good preparation you gave me
 Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill
 Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us
 Not through the mighty woods we go but through the mightier cities
 Something for us is pouring now more than Niagara pouring
 Torrents of men sources and rills of the Northwest are you indeed
 inexhaustible
 What to pavements and homesteads here what were those storms of
 the mountains and sea
 What to passions I witness around me today was the sea risen
 Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds
 Lo from deeps more unfathomable something more deadly and savage
 Manhattan rising advancing with menacing frontCincinnati Chicago
 unchaind
 What was that swell I saw on the ocean behold what comes here
 How it climbs with daring feet and handshow it dashes
 How the true thunder bellows after the lightninghow bright the
 flashes of lightning
 How Democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on shown
 through the dark by those flashes of lightning
 Yet a mournful wall and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark
 In a lull of the deafening confusion

 3
 Thunder on stride on Democracy strike with vengeful stroke
 And do you rise higher than ever yet O days O cities
 Crash heavier heavier yet O storms you have done me good
 My soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong nutriment
 Long had I walkd my cities my country roads through farms only
 half satisfied
 One doubt nauseous undulating like a snake crawld on the ground before me
 Continually preceding my steps turning upon me oft ironically hissing low
 The cities I loved so well I abandond and left I sped to the
 certainties suitable to me
 Hungering hungering hungering for primal energies and Natures
 dauntlessness
 I refreshd myself with it only I could relish it only
 I waited the bursting forth of the pent fireon the water and air
 waited long
 But now I no longer wait I am fully satisfied I am glutted
 I have witnessd the true lightning I have witnessd my cities electric
 I have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike America rise
 Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds
 No more the mountains roam or sail the stormy sea




VirginiaThe West

 The noble sire fallen on evil days
 I saw with hand uplifted menacing brandishing
 Memories of old in abeyance love and faith in abeyance
 The insane knife toward the Mother of All

 The noble son on sinewy feet advancing
 I saw out of the land of prairies land of Ohios waters and of Indiana
 To the rescue the stalwart giant hurry his plenteous offspring
 Drest in blue bearing their trusty rifles on their shoulders

 Then the Mother of All with calm voice speaking
 As to you Rebellious I seemed to hear her say why strive against
 me and why seek my life
 When you yourself forever provide to defend me
 For you provided me Washingtonand now these also




City of Ships

 City of ships
 O the black ships O the fierce ships
 O the beautiful sharpbowd steamships and sailships
 City of the world for all races are here
 All the lands of the earth make contributions here
 City of the sea city of hurried and glittering tides
 City whose gleeful tides continually rush or recede whirling in and
 out with eddies and foam
 City of wharves and storescity of tall facades of marble and iron
 Proud and passionate citymettlesome mad extravagant city
 Spring up O citynot for peace alone but be indeed yourself warlike
 Fear notsubmit to no models but your own O city
 Behold meincarnate me as I have incarnated you
 I have rejected nothing you offerd mewhom you adopted I have adopted
 Good or bad I never question youI love allI do not condemn any thing
 I chant and celebrate all that is yoursyet peace no more
 In peace I chanted peace but now the drum of war is mine
 War red war is my song through your streets O city




The Centenarians Story

 Volunteer of 18612 at Washington Park Brooklyn assisting
 the Centenarian
 Give me your hand old Revolutionary
 The hilltop is nigh but a few steps make room gentlemen
 Up the path you have followd me well spite of your hundred and
 extra years
 You can walk old man though your eyes are almost done
 Your faculties serve you and presently I must have them serve me

 Rest while I tell what the crowd around us means
 On the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising
 There is the camp one regiment departs tomorrow
 Do you hear the officers giving their orders
 Do you hear the clank of the muskets
 Why what comes over you now old man
 Why do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively
 The troops are but drilling they are yet surrounded with smiles
 Around them at hand the welldrest friends and the women
 While splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down
 Green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze
 Oer proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between

 But drill and parade are over they march back to quarters
 Only hear that approval of hands hear what a clapping

 As wending the crowds now part and dispersebut we old man
 Not for nothing have I brought you hitherwe must remain
 You to speak in your turn and I to listen and tell

 The Centenarian
 When I clutchd your hand it was not with terror
 But suddenly pouring about me here on every side
 And below there where the boys were drilling and up the slopes they ran
 And where tents are pitchd and wherever you see south and south
 east and southwest
 Over hills across lowlands and in the skirts of woods
 And along the shores in mire now filld over came again and
 suddenly raged
 As eightyfive years agone no mere parade receivd with applause of friends
 But a battle which I took part in myselfaye long ago as it is I
 took part in it
 Walking then this hilltop this same ground

 Aye this is the ground
 My blind eyes even as I speak behold it repeopled from graves
 The years recede pavements and stately houses disappear
 Rude forts appear again the old hoopd guns are mounted
 I see the lines of raisd earth stretching from river to bay
 I mark the vista of waters I mark the uplands and slopes
 Here we lay encampd it was this time in summer also

 As I talk I remember all I remember the Declaration
 It was read here the whole army paraded it was read to us here
 By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle he held up
 his unsheathd sword
 It glitterd in the sun in full sight of the army

 Twas a bold act thenthe English warships had just arrived
 We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor
 And the transports swarming with soldiers

 A few days more and they landed and then the battle

 Twenty thousand were brought against us
 A veteran force furnishd with good artillery

 I tell not now the whole of the battle
 But one brigade early in the forenoon orderd forward to engage the
 redcoats
 Of that brigade I tell and how steadily it marchd
 And how long and well it stood confronting death

 Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death
 It was the brigade of the youngest men two thousand strong
 Raisd in Virginia and Maryland and most of them known personally
 to the General

 Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus waters
 Till of a sudden unlookd for by defiles through the woods gaind at night
 The British advancing rounding in from the east fiercely playing
 their guns
 That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemys mercy

 The General watchd them from this hill
 They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment
 Then drew close together very compact their flag flying in the middle
 But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them

 It sickens me yet that slaughter
 I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General
 I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish

 Meanwhile the British manoeuvrd to draw us out for a pitchd battle
 But we dared not trust the chances of a pitchd battle

 We fought the fight in detachments
 Sallying forth we fought at several points but in each the luck was
 against us
 Our foe advancing steadily getting the best of it pushd us back
 to the works on this hill
 Till we turnd menacing here and then he left us

 That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men two thousand
 strong
 Few returnd nearly all remain in Brooklyn

 That and here my Generals first battle
 No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in it did not conclude
 with applause
 Nobody clappd hands here then

 But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain
 Wearied that night we lay foild and sullen
 While scornfully laughd many an arrogant lord off against us encampd
 Quite within hearing feasting clinking wineglasses together over
 their victory

 So dull and damp and another day
 But the night of that mist lifting rain ceasing
 Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him my
 General retreated

 I saw him at the riverside
 Down by the ferry lit by torches hastening the embarcation
 My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all passd over
 And then it was just ere sunrise these eyes rested on him for
 the last time

 Every one else seemd filld with gloom
 Many no doubt thought of capitulation

 But when my General passd me
 As he stood in his boat and lookd toward the coming sun
 I saw something different from capitulation

 Terminus
 Enough the Centenarians story ends
 The two the past and present have interchanged
 I myself as connecter as chansonnier of a great future am now speaking

 And is this the ground Washington trod
 And these waters I listlessly daily cross are these the waters he crossd
 As resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs

 I must copy the story and send it eastward and westward
 I must preserve that look as it beamd on you rivers of Brooklyn

 Seeas the annual round returns the phantoms return
 It is the 27th of August and the British have landed
 The battle begins and goes against us behold through the smoke
 Washingtons face
 The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have marchd forth to intercept
 the enemy
 They are cut off murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them
 Rank after rank falls while over them silently droops the flag
 Baptized that day in many a young mans bloody wounds
 In death defeat and sisters mothers tears

 Ah hills and slopes of Brooklyn I perceive you are more valuable
 than your owners supposed
 In the midst of you stands an encampment very old
 Stands forever the camp of that dead brigade




Cavalry Crossing a Ford

 A line in long array where they wind betwixt green islands
 They take a serpentine course their arms flash in the sunhark to
 the musical clank
 Behold the silvery river in it the splashing horses loitering stop
 to drink
 Behold the brownfaced men each group each person a picture the
 negligent rest on the saddles
 Some emerge on the opposite bank others are just entering the fordwhile
 Scarlet and blue and snowy white
 The guidon flags flutter gayly in the wind




Bivouac on a Mountain Side

 I see before me now a traveling army halting
 Below a fertile valley spread with barns and the orchards of summer
 Behind the terraced sides of a mountain abrupt in places rising high
 Broken with rocks with clinging cedars with tall shapes dingily seen
 The numerous campfires scatterd near and far some away up on the
 mountain
 The shadowy forms of men and horses looming largesized flickering
 And over all the skythe sky far far out of reach studded
 breaking out the eternal stars




An Army Corps on the March

 With its cloud of skirmishers in advance
 With now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip and now an
 irregular volley
 The swarming ranks press on and on the dense brigades press on
 Glittering dimly toiling under the sunthe dustcoverd men
 In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground
 With artillery interspersdthe wheels rumble the horses sweat
 As the army corps advances




By the Bivouacs Fitful Flame

 By the bivouacs fitful flame
 A procession winding around me solemn and sweet and slowbut
 first I note
 The tents of the sleeping army the fields and woods dim outline
 The darkness lit by spots of kindled fire the silence
 Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving
 The shrubs and trees as I lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily
 watching me
 While wind in procession thoughts O tender and wondrous thoughts
 Of life and death of home and the past and loved and of those that
 are far away
 A solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the ground
 By the bivouacs fitful flame




Come Up from the Fields Father

 Come up from the fields father heres a letter from our Pete
 And come to the front door mother heres a letter from thy dear son

 Lo tis autumn
 Lo where the trees deeper green yellower and redder
 Cool and sweeten Ohios villages with leaves fluttering in the
 moderate wind
 Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellisd vines
 Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines
 Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing

 Above all lo the sky so calm so transparent after the rain and
 with wondrous clouds
 Below too all calm all vital and beautiful and the farm prospers well

 Down in the fields all prospers well
 But now from the fields come father come at the daughters call
 And come to the entry mother to the front door come right away

 Fast as she can she hurries something ominous her steps trembling
 She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap

 Open the envelope quickly
 O this is not our sons writing yet his name is signd
 O a strange hand writes for our dear son O stricken mothers soul
 All swims before her eyes flashes with black she catches the main
 words only
 Sentences broken gunshot wound in the breast cavalry skirmish
 taken to hospital
 At present low but will soon be better

 Ah now the single figure to me
 Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms
 Sickly white in the face and dull in the head very faint
 By the jamb of a door leans

 Grieve not so dear mother the justgrown daughter speaks through
 her sobs
 The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismayd
 See dearest mother the letter says Pete will soon be better

 Alas poor boy he will never be better nor maybe needs to be
 better that brave and simple soul
 While they stand at home at the door he is dead already
 The only son is dead

 But the mother needs to be better
 She with thin form presently drest in black
 By day her meals untouchd then at night fitfully sleeping often waking
 In the midnight waking weeping longing with one deep longing
 O that she might withdraw unnoticed silent from life escape and withdraw
 To follow to seek to be with her dear dead son




Vigil Strange I Kept on the Field One Night

 Vigil strange I kept on the field one night
 When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day
 One look I but gave which your dear eyes returnd with a look I
 shall never forget
 One touch of your hand to mine O boy reachd up as you lay on the ground
 Then onward I sped in the battle the evencontested battle
 Till late in the night relievd to the place at last again I made my way
 Found you in death so cold dear comrade found your body son of
 responding kisses never again on earth responding
 Bared your face in the starlight curious the scene cool blew the
 moderate nightwind
 Long there and then in vigil I stood dimly around me the
 battlefield spreading
 Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night
 But not a tear fell not even a longdrawn sigh long long I gazed
 Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my
 chin in my hands
 Passing sweet hours immortal and mystic hours with you dearest
 comradenot a tear not a word
 Vigil of silence love and death vigil for you my son and my soldier
 As onward silently stars aloft eastward new ones upward stole
 Vigil final for you brave boy I could not save you swift was your death
 I faithfully loved you and cared for you living I think we shall
 surely meet again
 Till at latest lingering of the night indeed just as the dawn appeard
 My comrade I wrapt in his blanket envelopd well his form
 Folded the blanket well tucking it carefully over head and
 carefully under feet
 And there and then and bathed by the rising sun my son in his
 grave in his rudedug grave I deposited
 Ending my vigil strange with that vigil of night and battlefield dim
 Vigil for boy of responding kisses never again on earth responding
 Vigil for comrade swiftly slain vigil I never forget how as day
 brightend
 I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket
 And buried him where he fell




A March in the Ranks HardPrest and the Road Unknown

 A march in the ranks hardprest and the road unknown
 A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness
 Our army foild with loss severe and the sullen remnant retreating
 Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dimlighted building
 We come to an open space in the woods and halt by the dimlighted building
 Tis a large old church at the crossing roads now an impromptu hospital
 Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and
 poems ever made
 Shadows of deepest deepest black just lit by moving candles and lamps
 And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and
 clouds of smoke
 By these crowds groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor some
 in the pews laid down
 At my feet more distinctly a soldier a mere lad in danger of
 bleeding to death he is shot in the abdomen
 I stanch the blood temporarily the youngsters face is white as a lily
 Then before I depart I sweep my eyes oer the scene fain to absorb it all
 Faces varieties postures beyond description most in obscurity
 some of them dead
 Surgeons operating attendants holding lights the smell of ether
 odor of blood
 The crowd O the crowd of the bloody forms the yard outside also filld
 Some on the bare ground some on planks or stretchers some in the
 deathspasm sweating
 An occasional scream or cry the doctors shouted orders or calls
 The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of
 the torches
 These I resume as I chant I see again the forms I smell the odor
 Then hear outside the orders given Fall in my men fall in
 But first I bend to the dying lad his eyes open a halfsmile gives he me
 Then the eyes close calmly close and I speed forth to the darkness
 Resuming marching ever in darkness marching on in the ranks
 The unknown road still marching




A Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray and Dim

 A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim
 As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless
 As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital tent
 Three forms I see on stretchers lying brought out there untended lying
 Over each the blanket spread ample brownish woolen blanket
 Gray and heavy blanket folding covering all

 Curious I halt and silent stand
 Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first
 just lift the blanket
 Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim with wellgrayd hair
 and flesh all sunken about the eyes
 Who are you my dear comrade
 Then to the second I stepand who are you my child and darling
 Who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming
 Then to the thirda face nor child nor old very calm as of
 beautiful yellowwhite ivory
 Young man I think I know youI think this face is the face of the
 Christ himself
 Dead and divine and brother of all and here again he lies




As Toilsome I Wanderd Virginias Woods

 As toilsome I wanderd Virginias woods
 To the music of rustling leaves kickd by my feet for twas autumn
 I markd at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier
 Mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat easily all could
 understand
 The halt of a midday hour when up no time to loseyet this sign left
 On a tablet scrawld and naild on the tree by the grave
 Bold cautious true and my loving comrade

 Long long I muse then on my way go wandering
 Many a changeful season to follow and many a scene of life
 Yet at times through changeful season and scene abrupt alone or
 in the crowded street
 Comes before me the unknown soldiers grave comes the inscription
 rude in Virginias woods
 Bold cautious true and my loving comrade




Not the Pilot

 Not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port
 though beaten back and many times baffled
 Not the pathfinder penetrating inland weary and long
 By deserts parchd snows chilld rivers wet perseveres till he
 reaches his destination
 More than I have charged myself heeded or unheeded to compose
 march for these States
 For a battlecall rousing to arms if need be years centuries hence




Year That Trembled and Reeld Beneath Me

 Year that trembled and reeld beneath me
 Your summer wind was warm enough yet the air I breathed froze me
 A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darkend me
 Must I change my triumphant songs said I to myself
 Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled
 And sullen hymns of defeat




The WoundDresser

 1
 An old man bending I come among new faces
 Years looking backward resuming in answer to children
 Come tell us old man as from young men and maidens that love me
 Arousd and angry Id thought to beat the alarum and urge relentless war
 But soon my fingers faild me my face droopd and I resignd myself
 To sit by the wounded and soothe them or silently watch the dead
 Years hence of these scenes of these furious passions these chances
 Of unsurpassd heroes was one side so brave the other was equally brave
 Now be witness again paint the mightiest armies of earth
 Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us
 What stays with you latest and deepest of curious panics
 Of hardfought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains

 2
 O maidens and young men I love and that love me
 What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls
 Soldier alert I arrive after a long march coverd with sweat and dust
 In the nick of time I come plunge in the fight loudly shout in the
 rush of successful charge
 Enter the capturd worksyet lo like a swiftrunning river they fade
 Pass and are gone they fadeI dwell not on soldiers perils or
 soldiers joys
 Both I remember wellmany the hardships few the joys yet I was content

 But in silence in dreams projections
 While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on
 So soon what is over forgotten and waves wash the imprints off the sand
 With hinged knees returning I enter the doors while for you up there
 Whoever you are follow without noise and be of strong heart

 Bearing the bandages water and sponge
 Straight and swift to my wounded I go
 Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in
 Where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground
 Or to the rows of the hospital tent or under the roofd hospital
 To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return
 To each and all one after another I draw near not one do I miss
 An attendant follows holding a tray he carries a refuse pail
 Soon to be filld with clotted rags and blood emptied and filld again

 I onward go I stop
 With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds
 I am firm with each the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable
 One turns to me his appealing eyespoor boy I never knew you
 Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you if that
 would save you

 3
 On on I go open doors of time open hospital doors
 The crushd head I dress poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away
 The neck of the cavalryman with the bullet through and through examine
 Hard the breathing rattles quite glazed already the eye yet life
 struggles hard
 Come sweet death be persuaded O beautiful death
 In mercy come quickly

 From the stump of the arm the amputated hand
 I undo the clotted lint remove the slough wash off the matter and blood
 Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curvd neck and side falling head
 His eyes are closed his face is pale he dares not look on the
 bloody stump
 And has not yet lookd on it

 I dress a wound in the side deep deep
 But a day or two more for see the frame all wasted and sinking
 And the yellowblue countenance see

 I dress the perforated shoulder the foot with the bulletwound
 Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene so sickening
 so offensive
 While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail

 I am faithful I do not give out
 The fracturd thigh the knee the wound in the abdomen
 These and more I dress with impassive hand yet deep in my breast
 a fire a burning flame

 4
 Thus in silence in dreams projections
 Returning resuming I thread my way through the hospitals
 The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand
 I sit by the restless all the dark night some are so young
 Some suffer so much I recall the experience sweet and sad
 Many a soldiers loving arms about this neck have crossd and rested
 Many a soldiers kiss dwells on these bearded lips




Long Too Long America

 Long too long America
 Traveling roads all even and peaceful you learnd from joys and
 prosperity only
 But now ah now to learn from crises of anguish advancing
 grappling with direst fate and recoiling not
 And now to conceive and show to the world what your children
 enmasse really are
 For who except myself has yet conceivd what your children enmasse
 really are




Give Me the Splendid Silent Sun

 1
 Give me the splendid silent sun with all his beams fulldazzling
 Give me autumnal fruit ripe and red from the orchard
 Give me a field where the unmowd grass grows
 Give me an arbor give me the trellisd grape
 Give me fresh corn and wheat give me serenemoving animals teaching
 content
 Give me nights perfectly quiet as on high plateaus west of the
 Mississippi and I looking up at the stars
 Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can
 walk undisturbd
 Give me for marriage a sweetbreathd woman of whom I should never tire
 Give me a perfect child give me away aside from the noise of the
 world a rural domestic life
 Give me to warble spontaneous songs recluse by myself for my own ears only
 Give me solitude give me Nature give me again O Nature your primal
 sanities

 These demanding to have them tired with ceaseless excitement and
 rackd by the warstrife
 These to procure incessantly asking rising in cries from my heart
 While yet incessantly asking still I adhere to my city
 Day upon day and year upon year O city walking your streets
 Where you hold me enchaind a certain time refusing to give me up
 Yet giving to make me glutted enrichd of soul you give me forever faces
 O I see what I sought to escape confronting reversing my cries
 see my own soul trampling down what it askd for

 2
 Keep your splendid silent sun
 Keep your woods O Nature and the quiet places by the woods
 Keep your fields of clover and timothy and your cornfields and orchards
 Keep the blossoming buckwheat fields where the Ninthmonth bees hum
 Give me faces and streetsgive me these phantoms incessant and
 endless along the trottoirs
 Give me interminable eyesgive me womengive me comrades and
 lovers by the thousand
 Let me see new ones every daylet me hold new ones by the hand every day
 Give me such showsgive me the streets of Manhattan
 Give me Broadway with the soldiers marchinggive me the sound of
 the trumpets and drums
 The soldiers in companies or regimentssome starting away flushd
 and reckless
 Some their time up returning with thinnd ranks young yet very
 old worn marching noticing nothing
 Give me the shores and wharves heavyfringed with black ships
 O such for me O an intense life full to repletion and varied
 The life of the theatre barroom huge hotel for me
 The saloon of the steamer the crowded excursion for me the
 torchlight procession
 The dense brigade bound for the war with high piled military wagons
 following
 People endless streaming with strong voices passions pageants
 Manhattan streets with their powerful throbs with beating drums as now
 The endless and noisy chorus the rustle and clank of muskets even
 the sight of the wounded
 Manhattan crowds with their turbulent musical chorus
 Manhattan faces and eyes forever for me




Dirge for Two Veterans

 The last sunbeam
 Lightly falls from the finishd Sabbath
 On the pavement here and there beyond it is looking
 Down a newmade double grave

 Lo the moon ascending
 Up from the east the silvery round moon
 Beautiful over the housetops ghastly phantom moon
 Immense and silent moon

 I see a sad procession
 And I hear the sound of coming fullkeyd bugles
 All the channels of the city streets theyre flooding
 As with voices and with tears

 I hear the great drums pounding
 And the small drums steady whirring
 And every blow of the great convulsive drums
 Strikes me through and through

 For the son is brought with the father
 In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell
 Two veterans son and father dropt together
 And the double grave awaits them

 Now nearer blow the bugles
 And the drums strike more convulsive
 And the daylight oer the pavement quite has faded
 And the strong deadmarch enwraps me

 In the eastern sky upbuoying
 The sorrowful vast phantom moves illumind
 Tis some mothers large transparent face
 In heaven brighter growing

 O strong deadmarch you please me
 O moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me
 O my soldiers twain O my veterans passing to burial
 What I have I also give you

 The moon gives you light
 And the bugles and the drums give you music
 And my heart O my soldiers my veterans
 My heart gives you love




Over the Carnage Rose Prophetic a Voice

 Over the carnage rose prophetic a voice
 Be not disheartend affection shall solve the problems of freedom yet
 Those who love each other shall become invincible
 They shall yet make Columbia victorious

 Sons of the Mother of All you shall yet be victorious
 You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the earth

 No danger shall balk Columbias lovers
 If need be a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one

 One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourians comrade
 From Maine and from hot Carolina and another an Oregonese shall
 be friends triune
 More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth

 To Michigan Florida perfumes shall tenderly come
 Not the perfumes of flowers but sweeter and wafted beyond death

 It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly affection
 The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly
 The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers
 The continuance of Equality shall be comrades

 These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron
 I ecstatic O partners O lands with the love of lovers tie you

 Were you looking to be held together by lawyers
 Or by an agreement on a paper or by arms
 Nay nor the world nor any living thing will so cohere




I Saw Old General at Bay

 I saw old General at bay
 Old as he was his gray eyes yet shone out in battle like stars
 His small force was now completely hemmd in in his works
 He calld for volunteers to run the enemys lines a desperate emergency
 I saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks but two or three
 were selected
 I saw them receive their orders aside they listend with care the
 adjutant was very grave
 I saw them depart with cheerfulness freely risking their lives




The Artillerymans Vision

 While my wife at my side lies slumbering and the wars are over long
 And my head on the pillow rests at home and the vacant midnight passes
 And through the stillness through the dark I hear just hear the
 breath of my infant
 There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses upon me
 The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal
 The skirmishers begin they crawl cautiously ahead I hear the
 irregular snap snap
 I hear the sounds of the different missiles the short tht tht
 of the rifleballs
 I see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds I hear the
 great shells shrieking as they pass
 The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees
 tumultuous now the contest rages
 All the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me again
 The crashing and smoking the pride of the men in their pieces
 The chiefgunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse of
 the right time
 After firing I see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note the effect
 Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging the young colonel
 leads himself this time with brandishd sword
 I see the gaps cut by the enemys volleys quickly filld up no delay
 I breathe the suffocating smoke then the flat clouds hover low
 concealing all
 Now a strange lull for a few seconds not a shot fired on either side
 Then resumed the chaos louder than ever with eager calls and
 orders of officers
 While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears
 a shout of applause some special success
 And ever the sound of the cannon far or near rousing even in
 dreams a devilish exultation and all the old mad joy in the
 depths of my soul
 And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions batteries
 cavalry moving hither and thither
 The falling dying I heed not the wounded dripping and red
 heed not some to the rear are hobbling
 Grime heat rush aidedecamps galloping by or on a full run
 With the patter of small arms the warning sst of the rifles
 these in my vision I hear or see
 And bombs bursting in air and at night the varicolord rockets




Ethiopia Saluting the Colors

 Who are you dusky woman so ancient hardly human
 With your woollywhite and turband head and bare bony feet
 Why rising by the roadside here do you the colors greet

 Tis while our army lines Carolinas sands and pines
 Forth from thy hovel door thou Ethiopia comst to me
 As under doughty Sherman I march toward the sea

 Me master years a hundred since from my parents sunderd
 A little child they caught me as the savage beast is caught
 Then hither me across the sea the cruel slaver brought

 No further does she say but lingering all the day
 Her highborne turband head she wags and rolls her darkling eye
 And courtesies to the regiments the guidons moving by

 What is it fateful woman so blear hardly human
 Why wag your head with turban bound yellow red and green
 Are the things so strange and marvelous you see or have seen




Not Youth Pertains to Me

 Not youth pertains to me
 Nor delicatesse I cannot beguile the time with talk
 Awkward in the parlor neither a dancer nor elegant
 In the learnd coterie sitting constraind and still for learning
 inures not to me
 Beauty knowledge inure not to meyet there are two or three things
 inure to me
 I have nourishd the wounded and soothd many a dying soldier
 And at intervals waiting or in the midst of camp
 Composed these songs




Race of Veterans

 Race of veteransrace of victors
 Race of the soil ready for conflictrace of the conquering march
 No more credulitys race abidingtemperd race
 Race henceforth owning no law but the law of itself
 Race of passion and the storm




World Take Good Notice

 World take good notice silver stars fading
 Milky hue ript wet of white detaching
 Coals thirtyeight baleful and burning
 Scarlet significant hands off warning
 Now and henceforth flaunt from these shores




O TanFaced PrairieBoy

 O tanfaced prairieboy
 Before you came to camp came many a welcome gift
 Praises and presents came and nourishing food till at last among
 the recruits
 You came taciturn with nothing to givewe but lookd on each other
 When lo more than all the gifts of the world you gave me




Look Down Fair Moon

 Look down fair moon and bathe this scene
 Pour softly down nights nimbus floods on faces ghastly swollen purple
 On the dead on their backs with arms tossd wide
 Pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred moon




Reconciliation

 Word over all beautiful as the sky
 Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be
 utterly lost
 That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly
 wash again and ever again this solid world
 For my enemy is dead a man divine as myself is dead
 I look where he lies whitefaced and still in the coffinI draw near
 Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin




How Solemn As One by One Washington City 1865

 How solemn as one by one
 As the ranks returning worn and sweaty as the men file by where stand
 As the faces the masks appear as I glance at the faces studying the masks
 As I glance upward out of this page studying you dear friend
 whoever you are
 How solemn the thought of my whispering soul to each in the ranks
 and to you
 I see behind each mask that wonder a kindred soul
 O the bullet could never kill what you really are dear friend
 Nor the bayonet stab what you really are
 The soul yourself I see great as any good as the best
 Waiting secure and content which the bullet could never kill
 Nor the bayonet stab O friend




As I Lay with My Head in Your Lap Camerado

 As I lay with my head in your lap camerado
 The confession I made I resume what I said to you and the open air
 I resume
 I know I am restless and make others so
 I know my words are weapons full of danger full of death
 For I confront peace security and all the settled laws to
 unsettle them
 I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever have
 been had all accepted me
 I heed not and have never heeded either experience cautions
 majorities nor ridicule
 And the threat of what is calld hell is little or nothing to me
 And the lure of what is calld heaven is little or nothing to me
 Dear camerado I confess I have urged you onward with me and still
 urge you without the least idea what is our destination
 Or whether we shall be victorious or utterly quelld and defeated




Delicate Cluster

 Delicate cluster flag of teeming life
 Covering all my landsall my seashores lining
 Flag of death how I watchd you through the smoke of battle pressing
 How I heard you flap and rustle cloth defiant
 Flag ceruleansunny flag with the orbs of night dappled
 Ah my silvery beautyah my woolly white and crimson
 Ah to sing the song of you my matron mighty
 My sacred one my mother




To a Certain Civilian

 Did you ask dulcet rhymes from me
 Did you seek the civilians peaceful and languishing rhymes
 Did you find what I sang erewhile so hard to follow
 Why I was not singing erewhile for you to follow to understandnor
 am I now
 I have been born of the same as the war was born
 The drumcorps rattle is ever to me sweet music I love well the
 martial dirge
 With slow wail and convulsive throb leading the officers funeral
 What to such as you anyhow such a poet as I therefore leave my works
 And go lull yourself with what you can understand and with pianotunes
 For I lull nobody and you will never understand me




Lo Victress on the Peaks

 Lo Victress on the peaks
 Where thou with mighty brow regarding the world
 The world O Libertad that vainly conspired against thee
 Out of its countless beleaguering toils after thwarting them all
 Dominant with the dazzling sun around thee
 Flauntest now unharmd in immortal soundness and bloomlo in
 these hours supreme
 No poem proud I chanting bring to thee nor masterys rapturous verse
 But a cluster containing nights darkness and blooddripping wounds
 And psalms of the dead




Spirit Whose Work Is Done Washington City 1865

 Spirit whose work is donespirit of dreadful hours
 Ere departing fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets
 Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts yet onward ever unfaltering
 pressing
 Spirit of many a solemn day and many a savage sceneelectric spirit
 That with muttering voice through the war now closed like a
 tireless phantom flitted
 Rousing the land with breath of flame while you beat and beat the drum
 Now as the sound of the drum hollow and harsh to the last
 reverberates round me
 As your ranks your immortal ranks return return from the battles
 As the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders
 As I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders
 As those slanted bayonets whole forests of them appearing in the
 distance approach and pass on returning homeward
 Moving with steady motion swaying to and fro to the right and left
 Evenly lightly rising and falling while the steps keep time
 Spirit of hours I knew all hectic red one day but pale as death next day
 Touch my mouth ere you depart press my lips close
 Leave me your pulses of ragebequeath them to mefill me with
 currents convulsive
 Let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are gone
 Let them identify you to the future in these songs




Adieu to a Soldier

 Adieu O soldier
 You of the rude campaigning which we shared
 The rapid march the life of the camp
 The hot contention of opposing fronts the long manoeuvre
 Red battles with their slaughter the stimulus the strong terrific game
 Spell of all brave and manly hearts the trains of time through you
 and like of you all filld
 With war and wars expression

 Adieu dear comrade
 Your mission is fulfilldbut I more warlike
 Myself and this contentious soul of mine
 Still on our own campaigning bound
 Through untried roads with ambushes opponents lined
 Through many a sharp defeat and many a crisis often baffled
 Here marching ever marching on a war fight outaye here
 To fiercer weightier battles give expression




Turn O Libertad

 Turn O Libertad for the war is over
 From it and all henceforth expanding doubting no more resolute
 sweeping the world
 Turn from lands retrospective recording proofs of the past
 From the singers that sing the trailing glories of the past
 From the chants of the feudal world the triumphs of kings slavery caste
 Turn to the world the triumphs reservd and to comegive up that
 backward world
 Leave to the singers of hitherto give them the trailing past
 But what remains remains for singers for youwars to come are for you
 Lo how the wars of the past have duly inured to you and the wars
 of the present also inure
 Then turn and be not alarmd O Libertadturn your undying face
 To where the future greater than all the past
 Is swiftly surely preparing for you




To the Leavend Soil They Trod

 To the leavend soil they trod calling I sing for the last
 Forth from my tent emerging for good loosing untying the tentropes
 In the freshness the forenoon air in the farstretching circuits
 and vistas again to peace restored
 To the fiery fields emanative and the endless vistas beyond to the
 South and the North
 To the leavend soil of the general Western world to attest my songs
 To the Alleghanian hills and the tireless Mississippi
 To the rocks I calling sing and all the trees in the woods
 To the plains of the poems of heroes to the prairies spreading wide
 To the faroff sea and the unseen winds and the sane impalpable air
 And responding they answer all but not in words
 The average earth the witness of war and peace acknowledges mutely
 The prairie draws me close as the father to bosom broad the son
 The Northern ice and rain that began me nourish me to the end
 But the hot sun of the South is to fully ripen my songs




BOOK XXII MEMORIES OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN


When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomd

 1
 When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomd
 And the great star early droopd in the western sky in the night
 I mournd and yet shall mourn with everreturning spring

 Everreturning spring trinity sure to me you bring
 Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west
 And thought of him I love

 2
 O powerful western fallen star
 O shades of nightO moody tearful night
 O great star disappeardO the black murk that hides the star
 O cruel hands that hold me powerlessO helpless soul of me
 O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul


 3
 In the dooryard fronting an old farmhouse near the whitewashd palings
 Stands the lilacbush tallgrowing with heartshaped leaves of rich green
 With many a pointed blossom rising delicate with the perfume strong I love
 With every leaf a miracleand from this bush in the dooryard
 With delicatecolord blossoms and heartshaped leaves of rich green
 A sprig with its flower I break

 4
 In the swamp in secluded recesses
 A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song

 Solitary the thrush
 The hermit withdrawn to himself avoiding the settlements
 Sings by himself a song

 Song of the bleeding throat
 Deaths outlet song of life for well dear brother I know
 If thou wast not granted to sing thou wouldst surely die

 5
 Over the breast of the spring the land amid cities
 Amid lanes and through old woods where lately the violets peepd
 from the ground spotting the gray debris
 Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes passing the
 endless grass
 Passing the yellowspeard wheat every grain from its shroud in the
 darkbrown fields uprisen
 Passing the appletree blows of white and pink in the orchards
 Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave
 Night and day journeys a coffin

 6
 Coffin that passes through lanes and streets
 Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land
 With the pomp of the inloopd flags with the cities draped in black
 With the show of the States themselves as of crapeveild women standing
 With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night
 With the countless torches lit with the silent sea of faces and the
 unbared heads
 With the waiting depot the arriving coffin and the sombre faces
 With dirges through the night with the thousand voices rising strong
 and solemn
 With all the mournful voices of the dirges pourd around the coffin
 The dimlit churches and the shuddering organswhere amid these
 you journey
 With the tolling tolling bells perpetual clang
 Here coffin that slowly passes
 I give you my sprig of lilac

 7
 Nor for you for one alone
 Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring
 For fresh as the morning thus would I chant a song for you O sane
 and sacred death

 All over bouquets of roses
 O death I cover you over with roses and early lilies
 But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first
 Copious I break I break the sprigs from the bushes
 With loaded arms I come pouring for you
 For you and the coffins all of you O death

 8
 O western orb sailing the heaven
 Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walkd
 As I walkd in silence the transparent shadowy night
 As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night
 As you droopd from the sky low down as if to my side while the
 other stars all lookd on
 As we wanderd together the solemn night for something I know not
 what kept me from sleep
 As the night advanced and I saw on the rim of the west how full you
 were of woe
 As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night
 As I watchd where you passd and was lost in the netherward black
 of the night
 As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank as where you sad orb
 Concluded dropt in the night and was gone

 9
 Sing on there in the swamp
 O singer bashful and tender I hear your notes I hear your call
 I hear I come presently I understand you
 But a moment I linger for the lustrous star has detaind me
 The star my departing comrade holds and detains me

 10
 O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved
 And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone
 And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love

 Seawinds blown from east and west
 Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea till
 there on the prairies meeting
 These and with these and the breath of my chant
 Ill perfume the grave of him I love

 11
 O what shall I hang on the chamber walls
 And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls
 To adorn the burialhouse of him I love
 Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes
 With the Fourthmonth eve at sundown and the gray smoke lucid and bright
 With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous indolent sinking
 sun burning expanding the air
 With the fresh sweet herbage under foot and the pale green leaves
 of the trees prolific
 In the distance the flowing glaze the breast of the river with a
 winddapple here and there
 With ranging hills on the banks with many a line against the sky
 and shadows
 And the city at hand with dwellings so dense and stacks of chimneys
 And all the scenes of life and the workshops and the workmen
 homeward returning

 12
 Lo body and soulthis land
 My own Manhattan with spires and the sparkling and hurrying tides
 and the ships
 The varied and ample land the South and the North in the light
 Ohios shores and flashing Missouri
 And ever the farspreading prairies coverd with grass and corn

 Lo the most excellent sun so calm and haughty
 The violet and purple morn with justfelt breezes
 The gentle softborn measureless light
 The miracle spreading bathing all the fulfilld noon
 The coming eve delicious the welcome night and the stars
 Over my cities shining all enveloping man and land

 13
 Sing on sing on you graybrown bird
 Sing from the swamps the recesses pour your chant from the bushes
 Limitless out of the dusk out of the cedars and pines

 Sing on dearest brother warble your reedy song
 Loud human song with voice of uttermost woe

 O liquid and free and tender
 O wild and loose to my soulO wondrous singer
 You only I hearyet the star holds me but will soon depart
 Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me

 14
 Now while I sat in the day and lookd forth
 In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring and
 the farmers preparing their crops
 In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests
 In the heavenly aerial beauty after the perturbd winds and the storms
 Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing and the
 voices of children and women
 The manymoving seatides and I saw the ships how they saild
 And the summer approaching with richness and the fields all busy
 with labor
 And the infinite separate houses how they all went on each with
 its meals and minutia of daily usages
 And the streets how their throbbings throbbd and the cities pent
 lo then and there
 Falling upon them all and among them all enveloping me with the rest
 Appeard the cloud appeard the long black trail
 And I knew death its thought and the sacred knowledge of death

 Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me
 And the thought of death closewalking the other side of me
 And I in the middle as with companions and as holding the hands of
 companions
 I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not
 Down to the shores of the water the path by the swamp in the dimness
 To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still

 And the singer so shy to the rest receivd me
 The graybrown bird I know receivd us comrades three
 And he sang the carol of death and a verse for him I love

 From deep secluded recesses
 From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still
 Came the carol of the bird

 And the charm of the carol rapt me
 As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night
 And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird

 Come lovely and soothing death
 Undulate round the world serenely arriving arriving
 In the day in the night to all to each
 Sooner or later delicate death

 Praisd be the fathomless universe
 For life and joy and for objects and knowledge curious
 And for love sweet lovebut praise praise praise
 For the sureenwinding arms of coolenfolding death

 Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet
 Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome
 Then I chant it for thee I glorify thee above all
 I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come come unfalteringly

 Approach strong deliveress
 When it is so when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead
 Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee
 Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death

 From me to thee glad serenades
 Dances for thee I propose saluting thee adornments and feastings for thee
 And the sights of the open landscape and the highspread shy are fitting
 And life and the fields and the huge and thoughtful night

 The night in silence under many a star
 The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know
 And the soul turning to thee O vast and wellveild death
 And the body gratefully nestling close to thee

 Over the treetops I float thee a song
 Over the rising and sinking waves over the myriad fields and the
 prairies wide
 Over the densepackd cities all and the teeming wharves and ways
 I float this carol with joy with joy to thee O death

 15
 To the tally of my soul
 Loud and strong kept up the graybrown bird
 With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night

 Loud in the pines and cedars dim
 Clear in the freshness moist and the swampperfume
 And I with my comrades there in the night

 While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed
 As to long panoramas of visions

 And I saw askant the armies
 I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battleflags
 Borne through the smoke of the battles and piercd with missiles I saw them
 And carried hither and yon through the smoke and torn and bloody
 And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs and all in silence
 And the staffs all splinterd and broken

 I saw battlecorpses myriads of them
 And the white skeletons of young men I saw them
 I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war
 But I saw they were not as was thought
 They themselves were fully at rest they sufferd not
 The living remaind and sufferd the mother sufferd
 And the wife and the child and the musing comrade sufferd
 And the armies that remaind sufferd

 16
 Passing the visions passing the night
 Passing unloosing the hold of my comrades hands
 Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul
 Victorious song deaths outlet song yet varying everaltering song
 As low and wailing yet clear the notes rising and falling
 flooding the night
 Sadly sinking and fainting as warning and warning and yet again
 bursting with joy
 Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven
 As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses
 Passing I leave thee lilac with heartshaped leaves
 I leave thee there in the dooryard blooming returning with spring

 I cease from my song for thee
 From my gaze on thee in the west fronting the west communing with thee
 O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night

 Yet each to keep and all retrievements out of the night
 The song the wondrous chant of the graybrown bird
 And the tallying chant the echo arousd in my soul
 With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe
 With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird
 Comrades mine and I in the midst and their memory ever to keep for
 the dead I loved so well
 For the sweetest wisest soul of all my days and landsand this for
 his dear sake
 Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul
 There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim




O Captain My Captain

 O Captain my Captain our fearful trip is done
 The ship has weatherd every rack the prize we sought is won
 The port is near the bells I hear the people all exulting
 While follow eyes the steady keel the vessel grim and daring
 But O heart heart heart
 O the bleeding drops of red
 Where on the deck my Captain lies
 Fallen cold and dead

 O Captain my Captain rise up and hear the bells
 Rise upfor you the flag is flungfor you the bugle trills
 For you bouquets and ribbond wreathsfor you the shores acrowding
 For you they call the swaying mass their eager faces turning
 Here Captain dear father
 This arm beneath your head
 It is some dream that on the deck
 Youve fallen cold and dead

 My Captain does not answer his lips are pale and still
 My father does not feel my arm he has no pulse nor will
 The ship is anchord safe and sound its voyage closed and done
 From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won
 Exult O shores and ring O bells
 But I with mournful tread
 Walk the deck my Captain lies
 Fallen cold and dead




Hushd Be the Camps ToDay May 4 1865

 Hushd be the camps today
 And soldiers let us drape our warworn weapons
 And each with musing soul retire to celebrate
 Our dear commanders death

 No more for him lifes stormy conflicts
 Nor victory nor defeatno more times dark events
 Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky
 But sing poet in our name

 Sing of the love we bore himbecause you dweller in camps know it truly

 As they invault the coffin there
 Singas they close the doors of earth upon himone verse
 For the heavy hearts of soldiers




This Dust Was Once the Man

 This dust was once the man
 Gentle plain just and resolute under whose cautious hand
 Against the foulest crime in history known in any land or age
 Was saved the Union of these States




BOOK XXIII


By Blue Ontarios Shore

 By blue Ontarios shore
 As I mused of these warlike days and of peace returnd and the
 dead that return no more
 A Phantom gigantic superb with stern visage accosted me
 Chant me the poem it said that comes from the soul of America
 chant me the carol of victory
 And strike up the marches of Libertad marches more powerful yet
 And sing me before you go the song of the throes of Democracy

 Democracy the destind conqueror yet treacherous lipsmiles everywhere
 And death and infidelity at every step

 2
 A Nation announcing itself
 I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated
 I reject none accept all then reproduce all in my own forms

 A breed whose proof is in time and deeds
 What we are we are nativity is answer enough to objections
 We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded
 We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves
 We are executive in ourselves we are sufficient in the variety of
 ourselves
 We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves
 We stand selfpoisd in the middle branching thence over the world
 From Missouri Nebraska or Kansas laughing attacks to scorn

 Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves
 Whatever appears whatever does not appear we are beautiful or
 sinful in ourselves only

 O MotherO Sisters dear
 If we are lost no victor else has destroyd us
 It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night

 3
 Have you thought there could be but a single supreme
 There can be any number of supremesone does not countervail
 another any more than one eyesight countervails another or
 one life countervails another

 All is eligible to all
 All is for individuals all is for you
 No condition is prohibited not Gods or any

 All comes by the body only health puts you rapport with the universe

 Produce great Persons the rest follows

 4
 Piety and conformity to them that like
 Peace obesity allegiance to them that like
 I am he who tauntingly compels men women nations
 Crying Leap from your seats and contend for your lives

 I am he who walks the States with a barbd tongue questioning every
 one I meet
 Who are you that wanted only to be told what you knew before
 Who are you that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense

 With pangs and cries as thine own O bearer of many children
 These clamors wild to a race of pride I give

 O lands would you be freer than all that has ever been before
 If you would be freer than all that has been before come listen to me

 Fear grace elegance civilization delicatesse
 Fear the mellow sweet the sucking of honeyjuice
 Beware the advancing mortal ripening of Nature
 Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and men

 5
 Ages precedents have long been accumulating undirected materials
 America brings builders and brings its own styles

 The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work and
 passd to other spheres
 A work remains the work of surpassing all they have done

 America curious toward foreign characters stands by its own at all
 hazards
 Stands removed spacious composite sound initiates the true use
 of precedents
 Does not repel them or the past or what they have produced under
 their forms
 Takes the lesson with calmness perceives the corpse slowly borne
 from the house
 Perceives that it waits a little while in the door that it was
 fittest for its days
 That its life has descended to the stalwart and wellshaped heir who
 approaches
 And that he shall be fittest for his days

 Any period one nation must lead
 One land must be the promise and reliance of the future

 These States are the amplest poem
 Here is not merely a nation but a teeming Nation of nations
 Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the
 day and night
 Here is what moves in magnificent masses careless of particulars
 Here are the roughs beards friendliness combativeness the soul loves
 Here the flowing trains here the crowds equality diversity the
 soul loves

 6
 Land of lands and bards to corroborate
 Of them standing among them one lifts to the light a westbred face
 To him the hereditary countenance bequeathd both mothers and fathers
 His first parts substances earth water animals trees
 Built of the common stock having room for far and near
 Used to dispense with other lands incarnating this land
 Attracting it body and soul to himself hanging on its neck with
 incomparable love
 Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits
 Making its cities beginnings events diversities wars vocal in him
 Making its rivers lakes bays embouchure in him
 Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes Columbia
 Niagara Hudson spending themselves lovingly in him
 If the Atlantic coast stretch or the Pacific coast stretch he
 stretching with them North or South
 Spanning between them East and West and touching whatever is between them
 Growths growing from him to offset the growths of pine cedar hemlock
 liveoak locust chestnut hickory cottonwood orange magnolia
 Tangles as tangled in him as any canebrake or swamp
 He likening sides and peaks of mountains forests coated with
 northern transparent ice
 Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna upland prairie
 Through him flights whirls screams answering those of the
 fishhawk mockingbird nightheron and eagle
 His spirit surrounding his countrys spirit unclosed to good and evil
 Surrounding the essences of real things old times and present times
 Surrounding just found shores islands tribes of red aborigines
 Weatherbeaten vessels landings settlements embryo stature and muscle
 The haughty defiance of the Year One war peace the formation of
 the Constitution
 The separate States the simple elastic scheme the immigrants
 The Union always swarming with blatherers and always sure and impregnable
 The unsurveyd interior loghouses clearings wild animals
 hunters trappers
 Surrounding the multiform agriculture mines temperature the
 gestation of new States
 Congress convening every Twelfthmonth the members duly coming
 up from the uttermost parts
 Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers especially
 the young men
 Responding their manners speech dress friendships the gait they
 have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the
 presence of superiors
 The freshness and candor of their physiognomy the copiousness and
 decision of their phrenology
 The picturesque looseness of their carriage their fierceness when wrongd
 The fluency of their speech their delight in music their curiosity
 good temper and openhandedness the whole composite make
 The prevailing ardor and enterprise the large amativeness
 The perfect equality of the female with the male the fluid movement
 of the population
 The superior marine free commerce fisheries whaling golddigging
 Wharfhemmd cities railroad and steamboat lines intersecting all points
 Factories mercantile life laborsaving machinery the Northeast
 Northwest Southwest
 Manhattan firemen the Yankee swap southern plantation life
 Slaverythe murderous treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the
 ruins of all the rest
 On and on to the grapple with itAssassin then your life or ours
 be the stake and respite no more

 7
 Lo high toward heaven this day
 Libertad from the conqueress field returnd
 I mark the new aureola around your head
 No more of soft astral but dazzling and fierce
 With wars flames and the lambent lightnings playing
 And your port immovable where you stand
 With still the inextinguishable glance and the clinchd and lifted fist
 And your foot on the neck of the menacing one the scorner utterly
 crushd beneath you
 The menacing arrogant one that strode and advanced with his
 senseless scorn bearing the murderous knife
 The wideswelling one the braggart that would yesterday do so much
 Today a carrion dead and damnd the despised of all the earth
 An offal rank to the dunghill maggots spurnd

 8
 Others take finish but the Republic is ever constructive and ever
 keeps vista
 Others adorn the past but you O days of the present I adorn you
 O days of the future I believe in youI isolate myself for your sake
 O America because you build for mankind I build for you
 O wellbeloved stonecutters I lead them who plan with decision
 and science
 Lead the present with friendly hand toward the future
 Bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age
 But damn that which spends itself with no thought of the stain
 pains dismay feebleness it is bequeathing

 9
 I listened to the Phantom by Ontarios shore
 I heard the voice arising demanding bards
 By them all native and grand by them alone can these States be
 fused into the compact organism of a Nation

 To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is no account
 That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living principle
 as the hold of the limbs of the body or the fibres of plants

 Of all races and eras these States with veins full of poetical stuff most
 need poets and are to have the greatest and use them the greatest
 Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their
 poets shall

 Soul of love and tongue of fire
 Eye to pierce the deepest deeps and sweep the world
 Ah Mother prolific and full in all besides yet how long barren barren

 10
 Of these States the poet is the equable man
 Not in him but off from him things are grotesque eccentric fail of
 their full returns
 Nothing out of its place is good nothing in its place is bad
 He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion neither
 more nor less
 He is the arbiter of the diverse he is the key
 He is the equalizer of his age and land
 He supplies what wants supplying he checks what wants checking
 In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace large rich
 thrifty building populous towns encouraging agriculture arts
 commerce lighting the study of man the soul health
 immortality government
 In war he is the best backer of the war he fetches artillery as
 good as the engineers he can make every word he speaks draw blood
 The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his steady faith
 He is no arguer he is judgment Nature accepts him absolutely
 He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun failing round
 helpless thing
 As he sees the farthest he has the most faith
 His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things
 In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent
 He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement
 He sees eternity in men and women he does not see men and women
 as dreams or dots

 For the great Idea the idea of perfect and free individuals
 For that the bard walks in advance leader of leaders
 The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots

 Without extinction is Liberty without retrograde is Equality
 They live in the feelings of young men and the best women
 Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always
 ready to fall for Liberty

 11
 For the great Idea
 That O my brethren that is the mission of poets

 Songs of stern defiance ever ready
 Songs of the rapid arming and the march
 The flag of peace quickfolded and instead the flag we know
 Warlike flag of the great Idea

 Angry cloth I saw there leaping
 I stand again in leaden rain your flapping folds saluting
 I sing you over all flying beckoning through the fightO the
 hardcontested fight
 The cannons ope their rosyflashing muzzlesthe hurtled balls scream
 The battlefront forms amid the smokethe volleys pour incessant
 from the line
 Hark the ringing word Chargenow the tussle and the furious
 maddening yells
 Now the corpses tumble curld upon the ground
 Cold cold in death for precious life of you
 Angry cloth I saw there leaping

 12
 Are you he who would assume a place to teach or be a poet here in
 the States
 The place is august the terms obdurate

 Who would assume to teach here may well prepare himself body and mind
 He may well survey ponder arm fortify harden make lithe himself
 He shall surely be questiond beforehand by me with many and stern questions

 Who are you indeed who would talk or sing to America
 Have you studied out the land its idioms and men
 Have you learnd the physiology phrenology politics geography
 pride freedom friendship of the land its substratums and objects
 Have you considerd the organic compact of the first day of the
 first year of Independence signd by the Commissioners ratified
 by the States and read by Washington at the head of the army
 Have you possessd yourself of the Federal Constitution
 Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind them
 and assumed the poems and processes of Democracy
 Are you faithful to things do you teach what the land and sea the
 bodies of men womanhood amativeness heroic angers teach
 Have you sped through fleeting customs popularities
 Can you hold your hand against all seductions follies whirls
 fierce contentions are you very strong are you really of the
 whole People
 Are you not of some coterie some school or mere religion
 Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life animating now to
 life itself
 Have you vivified yourself from the maternity of these States
 Have you too the old everfresh forbearance and impartiality
 Do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity for the
 lastborn little and big and for the errant

 What is this you bring my America
 Is it uniform with my country
 Is it not something that has been better told or done before
 Have you not imported this or the spirit of it in some ship
 Is it not a mere tale a rhyme a prettinessIs the good old cause in it
 Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets politicians
 literats of enemies lands
 Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here
 Does it answer universal needs will it improve manners
 Does it sound with trumpetvoice the proud victory of the Union in
 that secession war
 Can your performance face the open fields and the seaside
 Will it absorb into me as I absorb food air to appear again in my
 strength gait face
 Have real employments contributed to it original makers not mere
 amanuenses
 Does it meet modern discoveries calibres facts face to face
 What does it mean to American persons progresses cities Chicago
 Kanada Arkansas
 Does it see behind the apparent custodians the real custodians
 standing menacing silent the mechanics Manhattanese Western
 men Southerners significant alike in their apathy and in the
 promptness of their love
 Does it see what finally befalls and has always finally befallen
 each temporizer patcher outsider partialist alarmist
 infidel who has ever askd any thing of America
 What mocking and scornful negligence
 The track strewd with the dust of skeletons
 By the roadside others disdainfully tossd

 13
 Rhymes and rhymers pass away poems distilld from poems pass away
 The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass and leave ashes
 Admirers importers obedient persons make but the soil of literature
 America justifies itself give it time no disguise can deceive it
 or conceal from it it is impassive enough
 Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them
 If its poets appear it will in due time advance to meet them there
 is no fear of mistake
 The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferrd till his country
 absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbd it

 He masters whose spirit masters he tastes sweetest who results
 sweetest in the long run
 The blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint
 In the need of songs philosophy an appropriate native grandopera
 shipcraft any craft
 He or she is greatest who contributes the greatest original
 practical example

 Already a nonchalant breed silently emerging appears on the streets
 Peoples lips salute only doers lovers satisfiers positive knowers
 There will shortly be no more priests I say their work is done
 Death is without emergencies here but life is perpetual emergencies here
 Are your body days manners superb after death you shall be superb
 Justice health selfesteem clear the way with irresistible power
 How dare you place any thing before a man

 14
 Fall behind me States
 A man before allmyself typical before all

 Give me the pay I have served for
 Give me to sing the songs of the great Idea take all the rest
 I have loved the earth sun animals I have despised riches
 I have given aims to every one that askd stood up for the stupid
 and crazy devoted my income and labor to others
 Hated tyrants argued not concerning God had patience and indulgence
 toward the people taken off my hat to nothing known or unknown
 Gone freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young
 and with the mothers of families
 Read these leaves to myself in the open air tried them by trees
 stars rivers
 Dismissd whatever insulted my own soul or defiled my body
 Claimd nothing to myself which I have not carefully claimd for
 others on the same terms
 Sped to the camps and comrades found and accepted from every State
 Upon this breast has many a dying soldier leand to breathe his last
 This arm this hand this voice have nourishd raisd restored
 To life recalling many a prostrate form
 I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of myself
 Rejecting none permitting all

 Say O Mother have I not to your thought been faithful
 Have I not through life kept you and yours before me

 15
 I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things
 It is not the earth it is not America who is so great
 It is I who am great or to be great it is You up there or any one
 It is to walk rapidly through civilizations governments theories
 Through poems pageants shows to form individuals

 Underneath all individuals
 I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals
 The American compact is altogether with individuals
 The only government is that which makes minute of individuals
 The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one
 single individualnamely to You

 Mother with subtle sense severe with the naked sword in your hand
 I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals

 16
 Underneath all Nativity
 I swear I will stand by my own nativity pious or impious so be it
 I swear I am charmd with nothing except nativity
 Men women cities nations are only beautiful from nativity

 Underneath all is the Expression of love for men and women
 I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing
 love for men and women
 After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for men and
 women in myself

 I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself
 Talk as you like he only suits these States whose manners favor
 the audacity and sublime turbulence of the States

 Underneath the lessons of things spirits Nature governments
 ownerships I swear I perceive other lessons
 Underneath all to me is myself to you yourself the same
 monotonous old song

 17
 O I see flashing that this America is only you and me
 Its power weapons testimony are you and me
 Its crimes lies thefts defections are you and me
 Its Congress is you and me the officers capitols armies ships
 are you and me
 Its endless gestations of new States are you and me
 The war that war so bloody and grim the war I will henceforth
 forget was you and me
 Natural and artificial are you and me
 Freedom language poems employments are you and me
 Past present future are you and me

 I dare not shirk any part of myself
 Not any part of America good or bad
 Not to build for that which builds for mankind
 Not to balance ranks complexions creeds and the sexes
 Not to justify science nor the march of equality
 Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn belovd of time

 I am for those that have never been masterd
 For men and women whose tempers have never been masterd
 For those whom laws theories conventions can never master

 I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth
 Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all

 I will not be outfaced by irrational things
 I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me
 I will make cities and civilizations defer to me
 This is what I have learnt from Americait is the amount and it I
 teach again

 Democracy while weapons were everywhere aimd at your breast
 I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children saw in dreams
 your dilating form
 Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world

 18
 I will confront these shows of the day and night
 I will know if I am to be less than they
 I will see if I am not as majestic as they
 I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they
 I will see if I am to be less generous than they
 I will see if I have no meaning while the houses and ships have meaning
 I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves
 and I am not to be enough for myself

 I match my spirit against yours you orbs growths mountains brutes
 Copious as you are I absorb you all in myself and become the master myself
 America isolated yet embodying all what is it finally except myself
 These States what are they except myself

 I know now why the earth is gross tantalizing wicked it is for my sake
 I take you specially to be mine you terrible rude forms


 Mother bend down bend close to me your face
 I know not what these plots and wars and deferments are for
 I know not fruitions success but I know that through war and crime
 your work goes on and must yet go on

 19
 Thus by blue Ontarios shore
 While the winds fannd me and the waves came trooping toward me
 I thrilld with the powers pulsations and the charm of my theme
 was upon me
 Till the tissues that held me parted their ties upon me

 And I saw the free souls of poets
 The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me
 Strange large men long unwaked undisclosed were disclosed to me

 20
 O my rapt verse my call mock me not
 Not for the bards of the past not to invoke them have I launchd
 you forth
 Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontarios shores
 Have I sung so capricious and loud my savage song

 Bards for my own land only I invoke
 For the war the war is over the field is cleard
 Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward
 To cheer O Mother your boundless expectant soul

 Bards of the great Idea bards of the peaceful inventions for the
 war the war is over
 Yet bards of latent armies a million soldiers waiting everready
 Bards with songs as from burning coals or the lightnings forkd stripes
 Ample Ohios Kanadas bardsbards of California inland bards
 bards of the war
 You by my charm I invoke




Reversals

 Let that which stood in front go behind
 Let that which was behind advance to the front
 Let bigots fools unclean persons offer new propositions
 Let the old propositions be postponed
 Let a man seek pleasure everywhere except in himself
 Let a woman seek happiness everywhere except in herself




BOOK XXIV AUTUMN RIVULETS


As Consequent Etc

 As consequent from store of summer rains
 Or wayward rivulets in autumn flowing
 Or many a herblined brooks reticulations
 Or subterranean searills making for the sea
 Songs of continued years I sing

 Lifes evermodern rapids first soon soon to blend
 With the old streams of death

 Some threading Ohios farmfields or the woods
 Some down Colorados canons from sources of perpetual snow
 Some halfhid in Oregon or away southward in Texas
 Some in the north finding their way to Erie Niagara Ottawa
 Some to Atlanticas bays and so to the great salt brine

 In you whoeer you are my book perusing
 In I myself in all the world these currents flowing
 All all toward the mystic ocean tending

 Currents for starting a continent new
 Overtures sent to the solid out of the liquid
 Fusion of ocean and land tender and pensive waves
 Not safe and peaceful only waves rousd and ominous too
 Out of the depths the storms abysmic waves who knows whence
 Raging over the vast with many a broken spar and tatterd sail

 Or from the sea of Time collecting vasting all I bring
 A windrowdrift of weeds and shells

 O little shells so curiousconvolute so limpidcold and voiceless
 Will you not little shells to the tympans of temples held
 Murmurs and echoes still call up eternitys music faint and far
 Wafted inland sent from Atlanticas rim strains for the soul of
 the prairies
 Whisperd reverberations chords for the ear of the West joyously sounding
 Your tidings old yet ever new and untranslatable
 Infinitesimals out of my life and many a life
 For not my life and years alone I giveall all I give
 These waifs from the deep cast high and dry
 Washd on Americas shores




The Return of the Heroes

 1
 For the lands and for these passionate days and for myself
 Now I awhile retire to thee O soil of autumn fields
 Reclining on thy breast giving myself to thee
 Answering the pulses of thy sane and equable heart
 Turning a verse for thee

 O earth that hast no voice confide to me a voice
 O harvest of my landsO boundless summer growths
 O lavish brown parturient earthO infinite teeming womb
 A song to narrate thee

 2
 Ever upon this stage
 Is acted Gods calm annual drama
 Gorgeous processions songs of birds
 Sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul
 The heaving sea the waves upon the shore the musical strong waves
 The woods the stalwart trees the slender tapering trees
 The liliput countless armies of the grass
 The heat the showers the measureless pasturages
 The scenery of the snows the winds free orchestra
 The stretching lighthung roof of clouds the clear cerulean and the
 silvery fringes
 The highdilating stars the placid beckoning stars
 The moving flocks and herds the plains and emerald meadows
 The shows of all the varied lands and all the growths and products

 3
 Fecund Americatoday
 Thou art all over set in births and joys
 Thou groanst with riches thy wealth clothes thee as a swathinggarment
 Thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions
 A myriadtwining life like interlacing vines binds all thy vast demesne
 As some huge ship freighted to waters edge thou ridest into port
 As rain falls from the heaven and vapors rise from earth so have
 the precious values fallen upon thee and risen out of thee
 Thou envy of the globe thou miracle
 Thou bathed choked swimming in plenty
 Thou lucky Mistress of the tranquil barns
 Thou Prairie Dame that sittest in the middle and lookest out upon
 thy world and lookest East and lookest West
 Dispensatress that by a word givest a thousand miles a million
 farms and missest nothing
 Thou allacceptressthou hospitable thou only art hospitable as
 God is hospitable

 4
 When late I sang sad was my voice
 Sad were the shows around me with deafening noises of hatred and
 smoke of war
 In the midst of the conflict the heroes I stood
 Or passd with slow step through the wounded and dying

 But now I sing not war
 Nor the measurd march of soldiers nor the tents of camps
 Nor the regiments hastily coming up deploying in line of battle
 No more the sad unnatural shows of war

 Askd room those flushd immortal ranks the first forthstepping armies
 Ask room alas the ghastly ranks the armies dread that followd

 Pass pass ye proud brigades with your tramping sinewy legs
 With your shoulders young and strong with your knapsacks and your muskets
 How elate I stood and watchd you where starting off you marchd

 Passthen rattle drums again
 For an army heaves in sight O another gathering army
 Swarming trailing on the rear O you dread accruing army
 O you regiments so piteous with your mortal diarrhoea with your fever
 O my lands maimd darlings with the plenteous bloody bandage and
 the crutch
 Lo your pallid army follows

 5
 But on these days of brightness
 On the farstretching beauteous landscape the roads and lanes the
 highpiled farmwagons and the fruits and barns
 Should the dead intrude

 Ah the dead to me mar not they fit well in Nature
 They fit very well in the landscape under the trees and grass
 And along the edge of the sky in the horizons far margin

 Nor do I forget you Departed
 Nor in winter or summer my lost ones
 But most in the open air as now when my soul is rapt and at peace
 like pleasing phantoms
 Your memories rising glide silently by me

 6
 I saw the day the return of the heroes
 Yet the heroes never surpassd shall never return
 Them that day I saw not

 I saw the interminable corps I saw the processions of armies
 I saw them approaching defiling by with divisions
 Streaming northward their work done camping awhile in clusters of
 mighty camps

 No holiday soldiersyouthful yet veterans
 Worn swart handsome strong of the stock of homestead and workshop
 Hardend of many a long campaign and sweaty march
 Inured on many a hardfought bloody field

 A pausethe armies wait
 A million flushd embattled conquerors wait
 The world too waits then soft as breaking night and sure as dawn
 They melt they disappear

 Exult O lands victorious lands
 Not there your victory on those red shuddering fields
 But here and hence your victory

 Melt melt away ye armiesdisperse ye blueclad soldiers
 Resolve ye back again give up for good your deadly arms
 Other the arms the fields henceforth for you or South or North
 With saner wars sweet wars lifegiving wars

 7
 Loud O my throat and clear O soul
 The season of thanks and the voice of fullyielding
 The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility

 All tilld and untilld fields expand before me
 I see the true arenas of my race or first or last
 Mans innocent and strong arenas

 I see the heroes at other toils
 I see wellwielded in their hands the better weapons

 I see where the Mother of All
 With fullspanning eye gazes forth dwells long
 And counts the varied gathering of the products

 Busy the far the sunlit panorama
 Prairie orchard and yellow grain of the North
 Cotton and rice of the South and Louisianian cane
 Open unseeded fallows rich fields of clover and timothy
 Kine and horses feeding and droves of sheep and swine
 And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook
 And healthy uplands with herbyperfumed breezes
 And the good green grass that delicate miracle the everrecurring grass

 8
 Toil on heroes harvest the products
 Not alone on those warlike fields the Mother of All
 With dilated form and lambent eyes watchd you

 Toil on heroes toil well handle the weapons well
 The Mother of All yet here as ever she watches you

 Wellpleased America thou beholdest
 Over the fields of the West those crawling monsters
 The humandivine inventions the laborsaving implements
 Beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the
 revolving hayrakes
 The steampower reapingmachines and the horsepower machines
 The engines thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain well
 separating the straw the nimble work of the patent pitchfork
 Beholdest the newer sawmill the southern cottongin and the
 ricecleanser

 Beneath thy look O Maternal
 With these and else and with their own strong hands the heroes harvest

 All gather and all harvest
 Yet but for thee O Powerful not a scythe might swing as now in security
 Not a maizestalk dangle as now its silken tassels in peace

 Under thee only they harvest even but a wisp of hay under thy great
 face only
 Harvest the wheat of Ohio Illinois Wisconsin every barbed spear
 under thee
 Harvest the maize of Missouri Kentucky Tennessee each ear in its
 lightgreen sheath
 Gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns
 Oats to their bins the white potato the buckwheat of Michigan to theirs
 Gather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama dig and hoard the
 golden the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas
 Clip the wool of California or Pennsylvania
 Cut the flax in the Middle States or hemp or tobacco in the Borders
 Pick the pea and the bean or pull apples from the trees or bunches
 of grapes from the vines
 Or aught that ripens in all these States or North or South
 Under the beaming sun and under thee




There Was a Child Went Forth

 There was a child went forth every day
 And the first object he lookd upon that object he became
 And that object became part of him for the day or a certain part of the day
 Or for many years or stretching cycles of years

 The early lilacs became part of this child
 And grass and white and red morningglories and white and red
 clover and the song of the phoebebird
 And the Thirdmonth lambs and the sows pinkfaint litter and the
 mares foal and the cows calf
 And the noisy brood of the barnyard or by the mire of the pondside
 And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there and the
 beautiful curious liquid
 And the waterplants with their graceful flat heads all became part of him

 The fieldsprouts of Fourthmonth and Fifthmonth became part of him
 Wintergrain sprouts and those of the lightyellow corn and the
 esculent roots of the garden
 And the appletrees coverd with blossoms and the fruit afterward
 and woodberries and the commonest weeds by the road
 And the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the
 tavern whence he had lately risen
 And the schoolmistress that passd on her way to the school
 And the friendly boys that passd and the quarrelsome boys
 And the tidy and freshcheekd girls and the barefoot negro boy and girl
 And all the changes of city and country wherever he went

 His own parents he that had fatherd him and she that had conceivd
 him in her womb and birthd him
 They gave this child more of themselves than that
 They gave him afterward every day they became part of him

 The mother at home quietly placing the dishes on the suppertable
 The mother with mild words clean her cap and gown a wholesome
 odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks by
 The father strong selfsufficient manly mean angerd unjust
 The blow the quick loud word the tight bargain the crafty lure
 The family usages the language the company the furniture the
 yearning and swelling heart
 Affection that will not be gainsayd the sense of what is real the
 thought if after all it should prove unreal
 The doubts of daytime and the doubts of nighttime the curious
 whether and how
 Whether that which appears so is so or is it all flashes and specks
 Men and women crowding fast in the streets if they are not flashes
 and specks what are they
 The streets themselves and the facades of houses and goods in the windows
 Vehicles teams the heavyplankd wharves the huge crossing at
 the ferries
 The village on the highland seen from afar at sunset the river between
 Shadows aureola and mist the light falling on roofs and gables of
 white or brown two miles off
 The schooner near by sleepily dropping down the tide the little
 boat slacktowd astern
 The hurrying tumbling waves quickbroken crests slapping
 The strata of colord clouds the long bar of maroontint away
 solitary by itself the spread of purity it lies motionless in
 The horizons edge the flying seacrow the fragrance of salt marsh
 and shore mud
 These became part of that child who went forth every day and who
 now goes and will always go forth every day




Old Ireland

 Far hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty
 Crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother
 Once a queen now lean and tatterd seated on the ground
 Her old white hair drooping disheveld round her shoulders
 At her feet fallen an unused royal harp
 Long silent she too long silent mourning her shrouded hope and heir
 Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow because most full of love

 Yet a word ancient mother
 You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground with forehead
 between your knees
 O you need not sit there veild in your old white hair so disheveld
 For know you the one you mourn is not in that grave
 It was an illusion the son you love was not really dead
 The Lord is not dead he is risen again young and strong in another country
 Even while you wept there by your fallen harp by the grave
 What you wept for was translated passd from the grave
 The winds favord and the sea saild it
 And now with rosy and new blood
 Moves today in a new country




The City DeadHouse

 By the city deadhouse by the gate
 As idly sauntering wending my way from the clangor
 I curious pause for lo an outcast form a poor dead prostitute brought
 Her corpse they deposit unclaimd it lies on the damp brick pavement
 The divine woman her body I see the body I look on it alone
 That house once full of passion and beauty all else I notice not
 Nor stillness so cold nor running water from faucet nor odors
 morbific impress me
 But the house alonethat wondrous housethat delicate fair house
 that ruin
 That immortal house more than all the rows of dwellings ever built
 Or whitedomed capitol with majestic figure surmounted or all the
 old highspired cathedrals
 That little house alone more than them allpoor desperate house
 Fair fearful wrecktenement of a soulitself a soul
 Unclaimd avoided housetake one breath from my tremulous lips
 Take one tear dropt aside as I go for thought of you
 Dead house of lovehouse of madness and sin crumbled crushd
 House of life erewhile talking and laughingbut ah poor house
 dead even then
 Months years an echoing garnishd housebut dead dead dead




This Compost

 1
 Something startles me where I thought I was safest
 I withdraw from the still woods I loved
 I will not go now on the pastures to walk
 I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea
 I will not touch my flesh to the earth as to other flesh to renew me

 O how can it be that the ground itself does not sicken
 How can you be alive you growths of spring
 How can you furnish health you blood of herbs roots orchards grain
 Are they not continually putting distemperd corpses within you
 Is not every continent workd over and over with sour dead

 Where have you disposed of their carcasses
 Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations
 Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat
 I do not see any of it upon you today or perhaps I am deceivd
 I will run a furrow with my plough I will press my spade through
 the sod and turn it up underneath
 I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat

 2
 Behold this compost behold it well
 Perhaps every mite has once formd part of a sick personyet behold
 The grass of spring covers the prairies
 The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden
 The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward
 The applebuds cluster together on the applebranches
 The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves
 The tinge awakes over the willowtree and the mulberrytree
 The hebirds carol mornings and evenings while the shebirds sit on
 their nests
 The young of poultry break through the hatchd eggs
 The newborn of animals appear the calf is dropt from the cow the
 colt from the mare
 Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potatos dark green leaves
 Out of its hill rises the yellow maizestalk the lilacs bloom in
 the dooryards
 The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata
 of sour dead

 What chemistry
 That the winds are really not infectious
 That this is no cheat this transparent greenwash of the sea which
 is so amorous after me
 That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its tongues
 That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited
 themselves in it
 That all is clean forever and forever
 That the cool drink from the well tastes so good
 That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy
 That the fruits of the appleorchard and the orangeorchard that
 melons grapes peaches plums will none of them poison me
 That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease
 Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once
 catching disease

 Now I am terrified at the Earth it is that calm and patient
 It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions
 It turns harmless and stainless on its axis with such endless
 successions of diseasd corpses
 It distills such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor
 It renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal annual sumptuous crops
 It gives such divine materials to men and accepts such leavings
 from them at last




To a Foild European Revolutionaire

 Courage yet my brother or my sister
 Keep onLiberty is to be subservd whatever occurs
 That is nothing that is quelld by one or two failures or any
 number of failures
 Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people or by any
 unfaithfulness
 Or the show of the tushes of power soldiers cannon penal statutes

 What we believe in waits latent forever through all the continents
 Invites no one promises nothing sits in calmness and light is
 positive and composed knows no discouragement
 Waiting patiently waiting its time

 Not songs of loyalty alone are these
 But songs of insurrection also
 For I am the sworn poet of every dauntless rebel the world over
 And he going with me leaves peace and routine behind him
 And stakes his life to be lost at any moment

 The battle rages with many a loud alarm and frequent advance and retreat
 The infidel triumphs or supposes he triumphs
 The prison scaffold garrote handcuffs iron necklace and
 leadballs do their work
 The named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres
 The great speakers and writers are exiled they lie sick in distant lands
 The cause is asleep the strongest throats are choked with their own blood
 The young men droop their eyelashes toward the ground when they meet
 But for all this Liberty has not gone out of the place nor the
 infidel enterd into full possession

 When liberty goes out of a place it is not the first to go nor the
 second or third to go
 It waits for all the rest to go it is the last

 When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs
 And when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged
 from any part of the earth
 Then only shall liberty or the idea of liberty be discharged from
 that part of the earth
 And the infidel come into full possession

 Then courage European revolter revoltress
 For till all ceases neither must you cease

 I do not know what you are for I do not know what I am for myself
 nor what any thing is for
 But I will search carefully for it even in being foild
 In defeat poverty misconception imprisonmentfor they too are great

 Did we think victory great
 So it isbut now it seems to me when it cannot be helpd that
 defeat is great
 And that death and dismay are great




Unnamed Land

 Nations ten thousand years before these States and many times ten
 thousand years before these States
 Garnerd clusters of ages that men and women like us grew up and
 traveld their course and passd on
 What vastbuilt cities what orderly republics what pastoral tribes
 and nomads
 What histories rulers heroes perhaps transcending all others
 What laws customs wealth arts traditions
 What sort of marriage what costumes what physiology and phrenology
 What of liberty and slavery among them what they thought of death
 and the soul
 Who were witty and wise who beautiful and poetic who brutish and
 undevelopd
 Not a mark not a record remainsand yet all remains

 O I know that those men and women were not for nothing any more
 than we are for nothing
 I know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as much
 as we now belong to it

 Afar they stand yet near to me they stand
 Some with oval countenances learnd and calm
 Some naked and savage some like huge collections of insects
 Some in tents herdsmen patriarchs tribes horsemen
 Some prowling through woods some living peaceably on farms
 laboring reaping filling barns
 Some traversing paved avenues amid temples palaces factories
 libraries shows courts theatres wonderful monuments
 Are those billions of men really gone
 Are those women of the old experience of the earth gone
 Do their lives cities arts rest only with us
 Did they achieve nothing for good for themselves

 I believe of all those men and women that filld the unnamed lands
 every one exists this hour here or elsewhere invisible to us
 In exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life and out of
 what he or she did felt became loved sinnd in life

 I believe that was not the end of those nations or any person of
 them any more than this shall be the end of my nation or of me
 Of their languages governments marriage literature products
 games wars manners crimes prisons slaves heroes poets
 I suspect their results curiously await in the yet unseen world
 counterparts of what accrued to them in the seen world
 I suspect I shall meet them there
 I suspect I shall there find each old particular of those unnamed lands




Song of Prudence

 Manhattans streets I saunterd pondering
 On Time Space Realityon such as these and abreast with them Prudence

 The last explanation always remains to be made about prudence
 Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that
 suits immortality

 The soul is of itself
 All verges to it all has reference to what ensues
 All that a person does says thinks is of consequence
 Not a move can a man or woman make that affects him or her in a day
 month any part of the direct lifetime or the hour of death
 But the same affects him or her onward afterward through the
 indirect lifetime

 The indirect is just as much as the direct
 The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the
 body if not more

 Not one word or deed not venereal sore discoloration privacy of
 the onanist
 Putridity of gluttons or rumdrinkers peculation cunning
 betrayal murder seduction prostitution
 But has results beyond death as really as before death

 Charity and personal force are the only investments worth any thing

 No specification is necessary all that a male or female does that
 is vigorous benevolent clean is so much profit to him or her
 In the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope
 of it forever

 Who has been wise receives interest
 Savage felon President judge farmer sailor mechanic literat
 young old it is the same
 The interest will come roundall will come round

 Singly wholly to affect now affected their time will forever affect
 all of the past and all of the present and all of the future
 All the brave actions of war and peace
 All help given to relatives strangers the poor old sorrowful
 young children widows the sick and to shunnd persons
 All selfdenial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks and saw
 others fill the seats of the boats
 All offering of substance or life for the good old cause or for a
 friends sake or opinions sake
 All pains of enthusiasts scoffd at by their neighbors
 All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers
 All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded
 All the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit
 All the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name
 date location
 All that was ever manfully begun whether it succeeded or no
 All suggestions of the divine mind of man or the divinity of his
 mouth or the shaping of his great hands
 All that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe
 or on any of the wandering stars or on any of the fixd stars
 by those there as we are here
 All that is henceforth to be thought or done by you whoever you are
 or by any one
 These inure have inured shall inure to the identities from which
 they sprang or shall spring

 Did you guess any thing lived only its moment
 The world does not so exist no parts palpable or impalpable so exist
 No consummation exists without being from some long previous
 consummation and that from some other
 Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the
 beginning than any

 Whatever satisfies souls is true
 Prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of souls
 Itself only finally satisfies the soul
 The soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson
 but its own

 Now I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time
 space reality
 That answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own

 What is prudence is indivisible
 Declines to separate one part of life from every part
 Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous or the living from the dead
 Matches every thought or act by its correlative
 Knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement
 Knows that the young man who composedly perild his life and lost it
 has done exceedingly well for himself without doubt
 That he who never perild his life but retains it to old age in
 riches and ease has probably achievd nothing for himself worth
 mentioning
 Knows that only that person has really learnd who has learnd to
 prefer results
 Who favors body and soul the same
 Who perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct
 Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries nor
 avoids death




The Singer in the Prison

 O sight of pity shame and dole
 O fearful thoughta convict soul

 1
 Rang the refrain along the hall the prison
 Rose to the roof the vaults of heaven above
 Pouring in floods of melody in tones so pensive sweet and strong the
 like whereof was never heard
 Reaching the faroff sentry and the armed guards who ceasd their pacing
 Making the hearers pulses stop for ecstasy and awe

 2
 The sun was low in the west one winter day
 When down a narrow aisle amid the thieves and outlaws of the land
 There by the hundreds seated searfaced murderers wily counterfeiters
 Gatherd to Sunday church in prison walls the keepers round
 Plenteous wellarmed watching with vigilant eyes
 Calmly a lady walkd holding a little innocent child by either hand
 Whom seating on their stools beside her on the platform
 She first preluding with the instrument a low and musical prelude
 In voice surpassing all sang forth a quaint old hymn

 A soul confined by bars and bands
 Cries help O help and wrings her hands
 Blinded her eyes bleeding her breast
 Nor pardon finds nor balm of rest

 Ceaseless she paces to and fro
 O heartsick days O nights of woe
 Nor hand of friend nor loving face
 Nor favor comes nor word of grace

 It was not I that sinnd the sin
 The ruthless body draggd me in
 Though long I strove courageously
 The body was too much for me

 Dear prisond soul bear up a space
 For soon or late the certain grace
 To set thee free and bear thee home
 The heavenly pardoner death shall come

 Convict no more nor shame nor dole
 Departa Godenfranchisd soul

 3
 The singer ceasd
 One glance swept from her clear calm eyes oer all those upturnd faces
 Strange sea of prison faces a thousand varied crafty brutal
 seamd and beauteous faces
 Then rising passing back along the narrow aisle between them
 While her gown touchd them rustling in the silence
 She vanishd with her children in the dusk

 While upon all convicts and armed keepers ere they stirrd
 Convict forgetting prison keeper his loaded pistol
 A hush and pause fell down a wondrous minute
 With deep halfstifled sobs and sound of bad men bowd and moved to weeping
 And youths convulsive breathings memories of home
 The mothers voice in lullaby the sisters care the happy childhood
 The longpent spirit rousd to reminiscence
 A wondrous minute thenbut after in the solitary night to many
 many there
 Years after even in the hour of death the sad refrain the tune
 the voice the words
 Resumed the large calm lady walks the narrow aisle
 The wailing melody again the singer in the prison sings

 O sight of pity shame and dole
 O fearful thoughta convict soul




Warble for LilacTime

 Warble me now for joy of lilactime returning in reminiscence
 Sort me O tongue and lips for Natures sake souvenirs of earliest summer
 Gather the welcome signs as children with pebbles or stringing shells
 Put in April and May the hylas croaking in the ponds the elastic air
 Bees butterflies the sparrow with its simple notes
 Bluebird and darting swallow nor forget the highhole flashing his
 golden wings
 The tranquil sunny haze the clinging smoke the vapor
 Shimmer of waters with fish in them the cerulean above
 All that is jocund and sparkling the brooks running
 The maple woods the crisp February days and the sugarmaking
 The robin where he hops brighteyed brownbreasted
 With musical clear call at sunrise and again at sunset
 Or flitting among the trees of the appleorchard building the nest
 of his mate
 The melted snow of March the willow sending forth its yellowgreen sprouts
 For springtime is here the summer is here and what is this in it
 and from it
 Thou soul unloosendthe restlessness after I know not what
 Come let us lag here no longer let us be up and away
 O if one could but fly like a bird
 O to escape to sail forth as in a ship
 To glide with thee O soul oer all in all as a ship oer the waters
 Gathering these hints the preludes the blue sky the grass the
 morning drops of dew
 The lilacscent the bushes with dark green heartshaped leaves
 Woodviolets the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence
 Samples and sorts not for themselves alone but for their atmosphere
 To grace the bush I loveto sing with the birds
 A warble for joy of returning in reminiscence




Outlines for a Tomb G P Buried 1870

 1
 What may we chant O thou within this tomb
 What tablets outlines hang for thee O millionnaire
 The life thou livedst we know not
 But that thou walkdst thy years in barter mid the haunts of
 brokers
 Nor heroism thine nor war nor glory

 2
 Silent my soul
 With drooping lids as waiting ponderd
 Turning from all the samples monuments of heroes

 While through the interior vistas
 Noiseless uprose phantasmic as by night Auroras of the north
 Lambent tableaus prophetic bodiless scenes
 Spiritual projections

 In one among the city streets a laborers home appeard
 After his days work done cleanly sweetaird the gaslight burning
 The carpet swept and a fire in the cheerful stove

 In one the sacred parturition scene
 A happy painless mother birthd a perfect child

 In one at a bounteous morning meal
 Sat peaceful parents with contented sons

 In one by twos and threes young people
 Hundreds concentring walkd the paths and streets and roads
 Toward a talldomed school

 In one a trio beautiful
 Grandmother loving daughter loving daughters daughter sat
 Chatting and sewing

 In one along a suite of noble rooms
 Mid plenteous books and journals paintings on the walls fine statuettes
 Were groups of friendly journeymen mechanics young and old
 Reading conversing

 All all the shows of laboring life
 City and country womens mens and childrens
 Their wants provided for hued in the sun and tinged for once with joy
 Marriage the street the factory farm the houseroom lodgingroom
 Labor and toll the bath gymnasium playground library college
 The student boy or girl led forward to be taught
 The sick cared for the shoeless shod the orphan fatherd and motherd
 The hungry fed the houseless housed
 The intentions perfect and divine
 The workings details haply human

 3
 O thou within this tomb
 From thee such scenes thou stintless lavish giver
 Tallying the gifts of earth large as the earth
 Thy name an earth with mountains fields and tides

 Nor by your streams alone you rivers
 By you your banks Connecticut
 By you and all your teeming life old Thames
 By you Potomac laving the ground Washington trod by you Patapsco
 You Hudson you endless Mississippinor you alone
 But to the high seas launch my thought his memory




Out from Behind This Mask To Confront a Portrait

 1
 Out from behind this bending roughcut mask
 These lights and shades this drama of the whole
 This common curtain of the face containd in me for me in you for
 you in each for each
 Tragedies sorrows laughter tears0 heaven
 The passionate teeming plays this curtain hid
 This glaze of Gods serenest purest sky
 This film of Satans seething pit
 This hearts geographys map this limitless small continent this
 soundless sea
 Out from the convolutions of this globe
 This subtler astronomic orb than sun or moon than Jupiter Venus Mars
 This condensation of the universe nay here the only universe
 Here the idea all in this mystic handful wrapt
 These burind eyes flashing to you to pass to future time
 To launch and spin through space revolving sideling from these to emanate
 To you whoeer you area look

 2
 A traveler of thoughts and years of peace and war
 Of youth long sped and middle age declining
 As the first volume of a tale perused and laid away and this the second
 Songs ventures speculations presently to close
 Lingering a moment here and now to you I opposite turn
 As on the road or at some crevice door by chance or opend window
 Pausing inclining baring my head you specially I greet
 To draw and clinch your soul for once inseparably with mine
 Then travel travel on




Vocalism

 1
 Vocalism measure concentration determination and the divine
 power to speak words
 Are you fulllungd and limberlippd from long trial from vigorous
 practice from physique
 Do you move in these broad lands as broad as they
 Come duly to the divine power to speak words
 For only at last after many years after chastity friendship
 procreation prudence and nakedness
 After treading ground and breasting river and lake
 After a loosend throat after absorbing eras temperaments races
 after knowledge freedom crimes
 After complete faith after clarifyings elevations and removing
 obstructions
 After these and more it is just possible there comes to a man
 woman the divine power to speak words
 Then toward that man or that woman swiftly hasten allnone
 refuse all attend
 Armies ships antiquities libraries paintings machines cities
 hate despair amity pain theft murder aspiration form in
 close ranks
 They debouch as they are wanted to march obediently through the
 mouth of that man or that woman

 2
 O what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices
 Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice him or her I shall follow
 As the water follows the moon silently with fluid steps anywhere
 around the globe

 All waits for the right voices
 Where is the practisd and perfect organ where is the developd soul
 For I see every word utterd thence has deeper sweeter new sounds
 impossible on less terms

 I see brains and lips closed tympans and temples unstruck
 Until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose
 Until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies
 slumbering forever ready in all words




To Him That Was Crucified

 My spirit to yours dear brother
 Do not mind because many sounding your name do not understand you
 I do not sound your name but I understand you
 I specify you with joy O my comrade to salute you and to salute
 those who are with you before and since and those to come also
 That we all labor together transmitting the same charge and succession
 We few equals indifferent of lands indifferent of times
 We enclosers of all continents all castes allowers of all theologies
 Compassionaters perceivers rapport of men
 We walk silent among disputes and assertions but reject not the
 disputers nor any thing that is asserted
 We hear the bawling and din we are reachd at by divisions
 jealousies recriminations on every side
 They close peremptorily upon us to surround us my comrade
 Yet we walk unheld free the whole earth over journeying up and
 down till we make our ineffaceable mark upon time and the diverse eras
 Till we saturate time and eras that the men and women of races
 ages to come may prove brethren and lovers as we are




You Felons on Trial in Courts

 You felons on trial in courts
 You convicts in prisoncells you sentenced assassins chaind and
 handcuffd with iron
 Who am I too that I am not on trial or in prison
 Me ruthless and devilish as any that my wrists are not chaind with
 iron or my ankles with iron

 You prostitutes flaunting over the trottoirs or obscene in your rooms
 Who am I that I should call you more obscene than myself

 O culpable I acknowledgeI expose
 O admirers praise not mecompliment not meyou make me wince
 I see what you do notI know what you do not

 Inside these breastbones I lie smutchd and choked
 Beneath this face that appears so impassive hells tides continually run
 Lusts and wickedness are acceptable to me
 I walk with delinquents with passionate love
 I feel I am of themI belong to those convicts and prostitutes myself
 And henceforth I will not deny themfor how can I deny myself




Laws for Creations

 Laws for creations
 For strong artists and leaders for fresh broods of teachers and
 perfect literats for America
 For noble savans and coming musicians
 All must have reference to the ensemble of the world and the
 compact truth of the world
 There shall be no subject too pronouncedall works shall illustrate
 the divine law of indirections

 What do you suppose creation is
 What do you suppose will satisfy the soul except to walk free and
 own no superior
 What do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hundred ways but
 that man or woman is as good as God
 And that there is no God any more divine than Yourself
 And that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally mean
 And that you or any one must approach creations through such laws




To a Common Prostitute

 Be composedbe at ease with meI am Walt Whitman liberal and
 lusty as Nature
 Not till the sun excludes you do I exclude you
 Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you and the leaves to
 rustle for you do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you

 My girl I appoint with you an appointment and I charge you that you
 make preparation to be worthy to meet me
 And I charge you that you be patient and perfect till I come

 Till then I salute you with a significant look that you do not forget me




I Was Looking a Long While

 I was looking a long while for Intentions
 For a clew to the history of the past for myself and for these
 chantsand now I have found it
 It is not in those paged fables in the libraries them I neither
 accept nor reject
 It is no more in the legends than in all else
 It is in the presentit is this earth today
 It is in Democracythe purport and aim of all the past
 It is the life of one man or one woman todaythe average man of today
 It is in languages social customs literatures arts
 It is in the broad show of artificial things ships machinery
 politics creeds modern improvements and the interchange of nations
 All for the modernall for the average man of today




Thought

 Of persons arrived at high positions ceremonies wealth
 scholarships and the like
 To me all that those persons have arrived at sinks away from them
 except as it results to their bodies and souls
 So that often to me they appear gaunt and naked
 And often to me each one mocks the others and mocks himself or herself
 And of each one the core of life namely happiness is full of the
 rotten excrement of maggots
 And often to me those men and women pass unwittingly the true
 realities of life and go toward false realities
 And often to me they are alive after what custom has served them
 but nothing more
 And often to me they are sad hasty unwaked sonnambules walking the dusk




Miracles

 Why who makes much of a miracle
 As to me I know of nothing else but miracles
 Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan
 Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky
 Or wade with naked feet along the beach just in the edge of the water
 Or stand under trees in the woods
 Or talk by day with any one I love or sleep in the bed at night
 with any one I love
 Or sit at table at dinner with the rest
 Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car
 Or watch honeybees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon
 Or animals feeding in the fields
 Or birds or the wonderfulness of insects in the air
 Or the wonderfulness of the sundown or of stars shining so quiet
 and bright
 Or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring
 These with the rest one and all are to me miracles
 The whole referring yet each distinct and in its place

 To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle
 Every cubic inch of space is a miracle
 Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same
 Every foot of the interior swarms with the same
 To me the sea is a continual miracle
 The fishes that swimthe rocksthe motion of the wavesthe
 ships with men in them
 What stranger miracles are there




Sparkles from the Wheel

 Where the citys ceaseless crowd moves on the livelong day
 Withdrawn I join a group of children watching I pause aside with them

 By the curb toward the edge of the flagging
 A knifegrinder works at his wheel sharpening a great knife
 Bending over he carefully holds it to the stone by foot and knee
 With measurd tread he turns rapidly as he presses with light but
 firm hand
 Forth issue then in copious golden jets
 Sparkles from the wheel

 The scene and all its belongings how they seize and affect me
 The sad sharpchinnd old man with worn clothes and broad
 shoulderband of leather
 Myself effusing and fluid a phantom curiously floating now here
 absorbd and arrested
 The group an unminded point set in a vast surrounding
 The attentive quiet children the loud proud restive base of the streets
 The low hoarse purr of the whirling stone the lightpressd blade
 Diffusing dropping sidewaysdarting in tiny showers of gold
 Sparkles from the wheel




To a Pupil

 Is reform needed is it through you
 The greater the reform needed the greater the Personality you need
 to accomplish it

 You do you not see how it would serve to have eyes blood
 complexion clean and sweet
 Do you not see how it would serve to have such a body and soul that
 when you enter the crowd an atmosphere of desire and command
 enters with you and every one is impressd with your Personality

 O the magnet the flesh over and over
 Go dear friend if need be give up all else and commence today to
 inure yourself to pluck reality selfesteem definiteness
 elevatedness
 Rest not till you rivet and publish yourself of your own Personality




Unfolded out of the Folds

 Unfolded out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded and is
 always to come unfolded
 Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth is to come the
 superbest man of the earth
 Unfolded out of the friendliest woman is to come the friendliest man
 Unfolded only out of the perfect body of a woman can a man be
 formd of perfect body
 Unfolded only out of the inimitable poems of woman can come the
 poems of man only thence have my poems come
 Unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman I love only thence
 can appear the strong and arrogant man I love
 Unfolded by brawny embraces from the wellmuscled woman
 love only thence come the brawny embraces of the man
 Unfolded out of the folds of the womans brain come all the folds
 of the mans brain duly obedient
 Unfolded out of the justice of the woman all justice is unfolded
 Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy
 A man is a great thing upon the earth and through eternity but
 every of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman
 First the man is shaped in the woman he can then be shaped in himself




What Am I After All

 What am I after all but a child pleasd with the sound of my own
 name repeating it over and over
 I stand apart to hearit never tires me

 To you your name also
 Did you think there was nothing but two or three pronunciations in
 the sound of your name




Kosmos

 Who includes diversity and is Nature
 Who is the amplitude of the earth and the coarseness and sexuality of
 the earth and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also
 Who has not lookd forth from the windows the eyes for nothing
 or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing
 Who contains believers and disbelievers who is the most majestic lover
 Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism
 spiritualism and of the aesthetic or intellectual
 Who having considerd the body finds all its organs and parts good
 Who out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body
 understands by subtle analogies all other theories
 The theory of a city a poem and of the large politics of these States
 Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon but in
 other globes with their suns and moons
 Who constructing the house of himself or herself not for a day
 but for all time sees races eras dates generations
 The past the future dwelling there like space inseparable together




Others May Praise What They Like

 Others may praise what they like
 But I from the banks of the running Missouri praise nothing in art
 or aught else
 Till it has well inhaled the atmosphere of this river also the
 western prairiescent
 And exudes it all again




Who Learns My Lesson Complete

 Who learns my lesson complete
 Boss journeyman apprentice churchman and atheist
 The stupid and the wise thinker parents and offspring merchant
 clerk porter and customer
 Editor author artist and schoolboydraw nigh and commence
 It is no lessonit lets down the bars to a good lesson
 And that to another and every one to another still

 The great laws take and effuse without argument
 I am of the same style for I am their friend
 I love them quits and quits I do not halt and make salaams

 I lie abstracted and hear beautiful tales of things and the reasons
 of things
 They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen

 I cannot say to any person what I hearI cannot say it to myself
 it is very wonderful

 It is no small matter this round and delicious globe moving so
 exactly in its orbit for ever and ever without one jolt or
 the untruth of a single second
 I do not think it was made in six days nor in ten thousand years
 nor ten billions of years
 Nor plannd and built one thing after another as an architect plans
 and builds a house

 I do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman
 Nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman
 Nor that years will ever stop the existence of me or any one else

 Is it wonderful that I should be immortal as every one is immortal
 I know it is wonderful but my eyesight is equally wonderful and
 how I was conceived in my mothers womb is equally wonderful
 And passd from a babe in the creeping trance of a couple of
 summers and winters to articulate and walkall this is
 equally wonderful

 And that my soul embraces you this hour and we affect each other
 without ever seeing each other and never perhaps to see
 each other is every bit as wonderful

 And that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful
 And that I can remind you and you think them and know them to
 be true is just as wonderful

 And that the moon spins round the earth and on with the earth is
 equally wonderful
 And that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally
 wonderful




Tests

 All submit to them where they sit inner secure unapproachable to
 analysis in the soul
 Not traditions not the outer authorities are the judges
 They are the judges of outer authorities and of all traditions
 They corroborate as they go only whatever corroborates themselves
 and touches themselves
 For all that they have it forever in themselves to corroborate far
 and near without one exception




The Torch

 On my Northwest coast in the midst of the night a fishermens group
 stands watching
 Out on the lake that expands before them others are spearing salmon
 The canoe a dim shadowy thing moves across the black water
 Bearing a torch ablaze at the prow




O Star of France 187071

 O star of France
 The brightness of thy hope and strength and fame
 Like some proud ship that led the fleet so long
 Beseems today a wreck driven by the gale a mastless hulk
 And mid its teeming maddend halfdrownd crowds
 Nor helm nor helmsman

 Dim smitten star
 Orb not of France alone pale symbol of my soul its dearest hopes
 The struggle and the daring rage divine for liberty
 Of aspirations toward the far ideal enthusiasts dreams of brotherhood
 Of terror to the tyrant and the priest

 Star crucifiedby traitors sold
 Star panting oer a land of death heroic land
 Strange passionate mocking frivolous land

 Miserable yet for thy errors vanities sins I will not now rebuke thee
 Thy unexampled woes and pangs have quelld them all
 And left thee sacred

 In that amid thy many faults thou ever aimedst highly
 In that thou wouldst not really sell thyself however great the price
 In that thou surely wakedst weeping from thy druggd sleep
 In that alone among thy sisters thou giantess didst rend the ones
 that shamed thee
 In that thou couldst not wouldst not wear the usual chains
 This cross thy livid face thy pierced hands and feet
 The spear thrust in thy side

 O star O ship of France beat back and baffled long
 Bear up O smitten orb O ship continue on

 Sure as the ship of all the Earth itself
 Product of deathly fire and turbulent chaos
 Forth from its spasms of fury and its poisons
 Issuing at last in perfect power and beauty
 Onward beneath the sun following its course
 So thee O ship of France

 Finishd the days the clouds dispeld
 The travail oer the longsought extrication
 When lo reborn high oer the European world
 In gladness answering thence as face afar to face reflecting ours
 Columbia
 Again thy star O France fair lustrous star
 In heavenly peace clearer more bright than ever
 Shall beam immortal




The OxTamer

 In a faraway northern county in the placid pastoral region
 Lives my farmer friend the theme of my recitative a famous tamer of oxen
 There they bring him the threeyearolds and the fouryearolds to
 break them
 He will take the wildest steer in the world and break him and tame him
 He will go fearless without any whip where the young bullock
 chafes up and down the yard
 The bullocks head tosses restless high in the air with raging eyes
 Yet see you how soon his rage subsideshow soon this tamer tames him
 See you on the farms hereabout a hundred oxen young and old
 and he is the man who has tamed them
 They all know him all are affectionate to him
 See you some are such beautiful animals so lofty looking
 Some are buffcolord some mottled one has a white line running
 along his back some are brindled
 Some have wide flaring horns a good signsee you the bright hides
 See the two with stars on their foreheadssee the round bodies
 and broad backs
 How straight and square they stand on their legswhat fine sagacious eyes
 How straight they watch their tamerthey wish him near themhow
 they turn to look after him
 What yearning expression how uneasy they are when he moves away from them
 Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them books politics
 poems departall else departs
 I confess I envy only his fascinationmy silent illiterate friend
 Whom a hundred oxen love there in his life on farms
 In the northern county far in the placid pastoral region




An Old Mans Thought of School
 For the Inauguration of a Public School Camden New Jersey 1874

 An old mans thought of school
 An old man gathering youthful memories and blooms that youth itself cannot

 Now only do I know you
 O fair auroral skiesO morning dew upon the grass

 And these I see these sparkling eyes
 These stores of mystic meaning these young lives
 Building equipping like a fleet of ships immortal ships
 Soon to sail out over the measureless seas
 On the souls voyage

 Only a lot of boys and girls
 Only the tiresome spelling writing ciphering classes
 Only a public school

 Ah more infinitely more
 As George Fox raisd his warning cry Is it this pile of brick and
 mortar these dead floors windows rails you call the church
 Why this is not the church at allthe church is living ever living
 souls

 And you America
 Cast you the real reckoning for your present
 The lights and shadows of your future good or evil
 To girlhood boyhood look the teacher and the school




Wandering at Morn

 Wandering at morn
 Emerging from the night from gloomy thoughts thee in my thoughts
 Yearning for thee harmonious Union thee singing bird divine
 Thee coild in evil times my country with craft and black dismay
 with every meanness treason thrust upon thee
 This common marvel I beheldthe parent thrush I watchd feeding its young
 The singing thrush whose tones of joy and faith ecstatic
 Fail not to certify and cheer my soul

 There ponderd felt I
 If worms snakes loathsome grubs may to sweet spiritual songs be turnd
 If vermin so transposed so used and blessd may be
 Then may I trust in you your fortunes days my country
 Who knows but these may be the lessons fit for you
 From these your future song may rise with joyous trills
 Destind to fill the world




Italian Music in Dakota
 The Seventeenththe finest Regimental Band I ever heard

 Through the soft evening air enwinding all
 Rocks woods fort cannon pacing sentries endless wilds
 In dulcet streams in flutes and cornets notes
 Electric pensive turbulent artificial
 Yet strangely fitting even here meanings unknown before
 Subtler than ever more harmony as if born here related here
 Not to the citys frescod rooms not to the audience of the opera house
 Sounds echoes wandering strains as really here at home
 Sonnambulas innocent love trios with Normas anguish
 And thy ecstatic chorus Poliuto
 Rayd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown
 Music Italian music in Dakota

 While Nature sovereign of this gnarld realm
 Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses
 Acknowledging rapport however far removd
 As some old root or soil of earth its lastborn flower or fruit
 Listens well pleasd




With All Thy Gifts

 With all thy gifts America
 Standing secure rapidly tending overlooking the world
 Power wealth extent vouchsafed to theewith these and like of
 these vouchsafed to thee
 What if one gift thou lackest the ultimate human problem never solving
 The gift of perfect women fit for theewhat if that gift of gifts
 thou lackest
 The towering feminine of thee the beauty health completion fit for thee
 The mothers fit for thee




My PictureGallery

 In a little house keep I pictures suspended it is not a fixd house
 It is round it is only a few inches from one side to the other
 Yet behold it has room for all the shows of the world all memories
 Here the tableaus of life and here the groupings of death
 Here do you know this this is cicerone himself
 With finger raisd he points to the prodigal pictures




The Prairie States

 A newer garden of creation no primal solitude
 Dense joyous modern populous millions cities and farms
 With iron interlaced composite tied many in one
 By all the world contributedfreedoms and laws and thrifts society
 The crown and teeming paradise so far of times accumulations
 To justify the past




BOOK XXV


Proud Music of the Storm

 1
 Proud music of the storm
 Blast that careers so free whistling across the prairies
 Strong hum of forest treetopswind of the mountains
 Personified dim shapesyou hidden orchestras
 You serenades of phantoms with instruments alert
 Blending with Natures rhythmus all the tongues of nations
 You chords left as by vast composersyou choruses
 You formless free religious dancesyou from the Orient
 You undertone of rivers roar of pouring cataracts
 You sounds from distant guns with galloping cavalry
 Echoes of camps with all the different buglecalls
 Trooping tumultuous filling the midnight late bending me powerless
 Entering my lonesome slumberchamber why have you seizd me


 2
 Come forward O my soul and let the rest retire
 Listen lose not it is toward thee they tend
 Parting the midnight entering my slumberchamber
 For thee they sing and dance O soul

 A festival song
 The duet of the bridegroom and the bride a marriagemarch
 With lips of love and hearts of lovers filld to the brim with love
 The redflushd cheeks and perfumes the cortege swarming full of
 friendly faces young and old
 To flutes clear notes and sounding harps cantabile

 Now loud approaching drums
 Victoria seest thou in powdersmoke the banners torn but flying
 the rout of the baffled
 Hearest those shouts of a conquering army

 Ah soul the sobs of women the wounded groaning in agony
 The hiss and crackle of flames the blackend ruins the embers of cities
 The dirge and desolation of mankind

 Now airs antique and mediaeval fill me
 I see and hear old harpers with their harps at Welsh festivals
 I hear the minnesingers singing their lays of love
 I hear the minstrels gleemen troubadours of the middle ages

 Now the great organ sounds
 Tremulous while underneath as the hid footholds of the earth
 On which arising rest and leaping forth depend
 All shapes of beauty grace and strength all hues we know
 Green blades of grass and warbling birds children that gambol and
 play the clouds of heaven above
 The strong base stands and its pulsations intermits not
 Bathing supporting merging all the rest maternity of all the rest
 And with it every instrument in multitudes
 The players playing all the worlds musicians
 The solemn hymns and masses rousing adoration
 All passionate heartchants sorrowful appeals
 The measureless sweet vocalists of ages
 And for their solvent setting earths own diapason
 Of winds and woods and mighty ocean waves
 A new composite orchestra binder of years and climes tenfold renewer
 As of the farback days the poets tell the Paradiso
 The straying thence the separation long but now the wandering done
 The journey done the journeyman come home
 And man and art with Nature fused again

 Tutti for earth and heaven
 The Almighty leader now for once has signald with his wand

 The manly strophe of the husbands of the world
 And all the wives responding

 The tongues of violins
 I think O tongues ye tell this heart that cannot tell itself
 This brooding yearning heart that cannot tell itself

 3
 Ah from a little child
 Thou knowest soul how to me all sounds became music
 My mothers voice in lullaby or hymn
 The voice O tender voices memorys loving voices
 Last miracle of all O dearest mothers sisters voices
 The rain the growing corn the breeze among the longleavd corn
 The measurd seasurf beating on the sand
 The twittering bird the hawks sharp scream
 The wildfowls notes at night as flying low migrating north or south
 The psalm in the country church or mid the clustering trees the
 open air campmeeting
 The fiddler in the tavern the glee the longstrung sailorsong
 The lowing cattle bleating sheep the crowing cock at dawn

 All songs of current lands come sounding round me
 The German airs of friendship wine and love
 Irish ballads merry jigs and dances English warbles
 Chansons of France Scotch tunes and oer the rest
 Italias peerless compositions

 Across the stage with pallor on her face yet lurid passion
 Stalks Norma brandishing the dagger in her hand

 I see poor crazed Lucias eyes unnatural gleam
 Her hair down her back falls loose and disheveld

 I see where Ernani walking the bridal garden
 Amid the scent of nightroses radiant holding his bride by the hand
 Hears the infernal call the deathpledge of the horn

 To crossing swords and gray hairs bared to heaven
 The clear electric base and baritone of the world
 The trombone duo Libertad forever
 From Spanish chestnut trees dense shade
 By old and heavy convent walls a wailing song
 Song of lost love the torch of youth and life quenchd in despair
 Song of the dying swan Fernandos heart is breaking

 Awaking from her woes at last retrievd Amina sings
 Copious as stars and glad as morning light the torrents of her joy

 The teeming lady comes
 The lustrious orb Venus contralto the blooming mother
 Sister of loftiest gods Albonis self I hear

 4
 I hear those odes symphonies operas
 I hear in the William Tell the music of an arousd and angry people
 I hear Meyerbeers Huguenots the Prophet or Robert
 Gounods Faust or Mozarts Don Juan

 I hear the dancemusic of all nations
 The waltz some delicious measure lapsing bathing me in bliss
 The bolero to tinkling guitars and clattering castanets

 I see religious dances old and new
 I hear the sound of the Hebrew lyre
 I see the crusaders marching bearing the cross on high to the
 martial clang of cymbals
 I hear dervishes monotonously chanting interspersd with frantic
 shouts as they spin around turning always towards Mecca
 I see the rapt religious dances of the Persians and the Arabs
 Again at Eleusis home of Ceres I see the modern Greeks dancing
 I hear them clapping their hands as they bend their bodies
 I hear the metrical shuffling of their feet

 I see again the wild old Corybantian dance the performers wounding
 each other
 I see the Roman youth to the shrill sound of flageolets throwing and
 catching their weapons
 As they fall on their knees and rise again

 I hear from the Mussulman mosque the muezzin calling
 I see the worshippers within nor form nor sermon argument nor word
 But silent strange devout raisd glowing heads ecstatic faces

 I hear the Egyptian harp of many strings
 The primitive chants of the Nile boatmen
 The sacred imperial hymns of China
 To the delicate sounds of the king the stricken wood and stone
 Or to Hindu flutes and the fretting twang of the vina
 A band of bayaderes

 5
 Now Asia Africa leave me Europe seizing inflates me
 To organs huge and bands I hear as from vast concourses of voices
 Luthers strong hymn Eine feste Burg ist unser Gott
 Rossinis Stabat Mater dolorosa
 Or floating in some high cathedral dim with gorgeous colord windows
 The passionate Agnus Dei or Gloria in Excelsis

 Composers mighty maestros
 And you sweet singers of old lands soprani tenori bassi
 To you a new bard caroling in the West
 Obeisant sends his love

 Such led to thee O soul
 All senses shows and objects lead to thee
 But now it seems to me sound leads oer all the rest

 I hear the annual singing of the children in St Pauls cathedral
 Or under the high roof of some colossal hall the symphonies
 oratorios of Beethoven Handel or Haydn
 The Creation in billows of godhood laves me

 Give me to hold all sounds I madly struggling cry
 Fill me with all the voices of the universe
 Endow me with their throbbings Natures also
 The tempests waters winds operas and chants marches and dances
 Utter pour in for I would take them all

 6
 Then I woke softly
 And pausing questioning awhile the music of my dream
 And questioning all those reminiscences the tempest in its fury
 And all the songs of sopranos and tenors
 And those rapt oriental dances of religious fervor
 And the sweet varied instruments and the diapason of organs
 And all the artless plaints of love and grief and death
 I said to my silent curious soul out of the bed of the slumberchamber
 Come for I have found the clew I sought so long
 Let us go forth refreshd amid the day
 Cheerfully tallying life walking the world the real
 Nourishd henceforth by our celestial dream

 And I said moreover
 Haply what thou hast heard O soul was not the sound of winds
 Nor dream of raging storm nor seahawks flapping wings nor harsh scream
 Nor vocalism of sunbright Italy
 Nor German organ majestic nor vast concourse of voices nor layers
 of harmonies
 Nor strophes of husbands and wives nor sound of marching soldiers
 Nor flutes nor harps nor the buglecalls of camps
 But to a new rhythmus fitted for thee
 Poems bridging the way from Life to Death vaguely wafted in night
 air uncaught unwritten
 Which let us go forth in the bold day and write

Passage to India

 1
 Singing my days
 Singing the great achievements of the present
 Singing the strong light works of engineers
 Our modern wonders the antique ponderous Seven outvied
 In the Old World the east the Suez canal
 The New by its mighty railroad spannd
 The seas inlaid with eloquent gentle wires
 Yet first to sound and ever sound the cry with thee O soul
 The Past the Past the Past

 The Pastthe dark unfathomd retrospect
 The teeming gulfthe sleepers and the shadows
 The pastthe infinite greatness of the past
 For what is the present after all but a growth out of the past
 As a projectile formd impelld passing a certain line still keeps on
 So the present utterly formd impelld by the past

 2
 Passage O soul to India
 Eclaircise the myths Asiatic the primitive fables

 Not you alone proud truths of the world
 Nor you alone ye facts of modern science
 But myths and fables of eld Asias Africas fables
 The fardarting beams of the spirit the unloosd dreams
 The deep diving bibles and legends
 The daring plots of the poets the elder religions
 O you temples fairer than lilies pourd over by the rising sun
 O you fables spurning the known eluding the hold of the known
 mounting to heaven
 You lofty and dazzling towers pinnacled red as roses burnishd
 with gold
 Towers of fables immortal fashiond from mortal dreams
 You too I welcome and fully the same as the rest
 You too with joy I sing

 Passage to India
 Lo soul seest thou not Gods purpose from the first
 The earth to be spannd connected by network
 The races neighbors to marry and be given in marriage
 The oceans to be crossd the distant brought near
 The lands to be welded together

 A worship new I sing
 You captains voyagers explorers yours
 You engineers you architects machinists yours
 You not for trade or transportation only
 But in Gods name and for thy sake O soul

 3
 Passage to India
 Lo soul for thee of tableaus twain
 I see in one the Suez canal initiated opend
 I see the procession of steamships the Empress Engenies leading the van
 I mark from on deck the strange landscape the pure sky the level
 sand in the distance
 I pass swiftly the picturesque groups the workmen gatherd
 The gigantic dredging machines

 In one again different yet thine all thine O soul the same
 I see over my own continent the Pacific railroad surmounting every barrier
 I see continual trains of cars winding along the Platte carrying
 freight and passengers
 I hear the locomotives rushing and roaring and the shrill steamwhistle
 I hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the world
 I cross the Laramie plains I note the rocks in grotesque shapes
 the buttes
 I see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions the barren colorless
 sagedeserts
 I see in glimpses afar or towering immediately above me the great
 mountains I see the Wind river and the Wahsatch mountains
 I see the Monument mountain and the Eagles Nest I pass the
 Promontory I ascend the Nevadas
 I scan the noble Elk mountain and wind around its base
 I see the Humboldt range I thread the valley and cross the river
 I see the clear waters of lake Tahoe I see forests of majestic pines
 Or crossing the great desert the alkaline plains I behold
 enchanting mirages of waters and meadows
 Marking through these and after all in duplicate slender lines
 Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel
 Tying the Eastern to the Western sea
 The road between Europe and Asia

 Ah Genoese thy dream thy dream
 Centuries after thou art laid in thy grave
 The shore thou foundest verifies thy dream

 4
 Passage to India
 Struggles of many a captain tales of many a sailor dead
 Over my mood stealing and spreading they come
 Like clouds and cloudlets in the unreachd sky

 Along all history down the slopes
 As a rivulet running sinking now and now again to the surface rising
 A ceaseless thought a varied trainlo soul to thee thy sight
 they rise
 The plans the voyages again the expeditions
 Again Vasco de Gama sails forth
 Again the knowledge gaind the mariners compass
 Lands found and nations born thou born America
 For purpose vast mans long probation filld
 Thou rondure of the world at last accomplishd

 5
 O vast Rondure swimming in space
 Coverd all over with visible power and beauty
 Alternate light and day and the teeming spiritual darkness
 Unspeakable high processions of sun and moon and countless stars above
 Below the manifold grass and waters animals mountains trees
 With inscrutable purpose some hidden prophetic intention
 Now first it seems my thought begins to span thee

 Down from the gardens of Asia descending radiating
 Adam and Eve appear then their myriad progeny after them
 Wandering yearning curious with restless explorations
 With questionings baffled formless feverish with neverhappy hearts
 With that sad incessant refrain Wherefore unsatisfied soul and
 Whither O mocking life

 Ah who shall soothe these feverish children
 Who Justify these restless explorations
 Who speak the secret of impassive earth
 Who bind it to us what is this separate Nature so unnatural
 What is this earth to our affections unloving earth without a
 throb to answer ours
 Cold earth the place of graves

 Yet soul be sure the first intent remains and shall be carried out
 Perhaps even now the time has arrived

 After the seas are all crossd as they seem already crossd
 After the great captains and engineers have accomplishd their work
 After the noble inventors after the scientists the chemist the
 geologist ethnologist
 Finally shall come the poet worthy that name
 The true son of God shall come singing his songs

 Then not your deeds only O voyagers O scientists and inventors
 shall be justified
 All these hearts as of fretted children shall be soothd
 All affection shall be fully responded to the secret shall be told
 All these separations and gaps shall be taken up and hookd and
 linkd together
 The whole earth this cold impassive voiceless earth shall be
 completely Justified
 Trinitas divine shall be gloriously accomplishd and compacted by
 the true son of God the poet
 He shall indeed pass the straits and conquer the mountains
 He shall double the cape of Good Hope to some purpose
 Nature and Man shall be disjoind and diffused no more
 The true son of God shall absolutely fuse them

 6
 Year at whose wideflung door I sing
 Year of the purpose accomplishd
 Year of the marriage of continents climates and oceans
 No mere doge of Venice now wedding the Adriatic
 I see O year in you the vast terraqueous globe given and giving all
 Europe to Asia Africa joind and they to the New World
 The lands geographies dancing before you holding a festival garland
 As brides and bridegrooms hand in hand

 Passage to India
 Cooling airs from Caucasus far soothing cradle of man
 The river Euphrates flowing the past lit up again

 Lo soul the retrospect brought forward
 The old most populous wealthiest of earths lands
 The streams of the Indus and the Ganges and their many affluents
 I my shores of America walking today behold resuming all
 The tale of Alexander on his warlike marches suddenly dying
 On one side China and on the other side Persia and Arabia
 To the south the great seas and the bay of Bengal
 The flowing literatures tremendous epics religions castes
 Old occult Brahma interminably far back the tender and junior Buddha
 Central and southern empires and all their belongings possessors
 The wars of Tamerlanethe reign of Aurungzebe
 The traders rulers explorers Moslems Venetians Byzantium the
 Arabs Portuguese
 The first travelers famous yet Marco Polo Batouta the Moor
 Doubts to be solvd the map incognita blanks to be filld
 The foot of man unstayd the hands never at rest
 Thyself O soul that will not brook a challenge

 The mediaeval navigators rise before me
 The world of 1492 with its awakend enterprise
 Something swelling in humanity now like the sap of the earth in spring
 The sunset splendor of chivalry declining

 And who art thou sad shade
 Gigantic visionary thyself a visionary
 With majestic limbs and pious beaming eyes
 Spreading around with every look of thine a golden world
 Enhuing it with gorgeous hues

 As the chief histrion
 Down to the footlights walks in some great scena
 Dominating the rest I see the Admiral himself
 Historys type of courage action faith
 Behold him sail from Palos leading his little fleet
 His voyage behold his return his great fame
 His misfortunes calumniators behold him a prisoner chaind
 Behold his dejection poverty death

 Curious in time I stand noting the efforts of heroes
 Is the deferment long bitter the slander poverty death
 Lies the seed unreckd for centuries in the ground lo to Gods due
 occasion
 Uprising in the night it sprouts blooms
 And fills the earth with use and beauty

 7
 Passage indeed O soul to primal thought
 Not lands and seas alone thy own clear freshness
 The young maturity of brood and bloom
 To realms of budding bibles

 O soul repressless I with thee and thou with me
 Thy circumnavigation of the world begin
 Of man the voyage of his minds return
 To reasons early paradise
 Back back to wisdoms birth to innocent intuitions
 Again with fair creation

 8
 O we can wait no longer
 We too take ship O soul
 Joyous we too launch out on trackless seas
 Fearless for unknown shores on waves of ecstasy to sail
 Amid the wafting winds thou pressing me to thee I thee to me O soul
 Caroling free singing our song of God
 Chanting our chant of pleasant exploration

 With laugh and many a kiss
 Let others deprecate let others weep for sin remorse humiliation
 O soul thou pleasest me I thee

 Ah more than any priest O soul we too believe in God
 But with the mystery of God we dare not dally

 O soul thou pleasest me I thee
 Sailing these seas or on the hills or waking in the night
 Thoughts silent thoughts of Time and Space and Death like waters flowing
 Bear me indeed as through the regions infinite
 Whose air I breathe whose ripples hear lave me all over
 Bathe me O God in thee mounting to thee
 I and my soul to range in range of thee

 O Thou transcendent
 Nameless the fibre and the breath
 Light of the light shedding forth universes thou centre of them
 Thou mightier centre of the true the good the loving
 Thou moral spiritual fountainaffections sourcethou reservoir
 O pensive soul of meO thirst unsatisfiedwaitest not there
 Waitest not haply for us somewhere there the Comrade perfect
 Thou pulsethou motive of the stars suns systems
 That circling move in order safe harmonious
 Athwart the shapeless vastnesses of space
 How should I think how breathe a single breath how speak if out
 of myself
 I could not launch to those superior universes

 Swiftly I shrivel at the thought of God
 At Nature and its wonders Time and Space and Death
 But that I turning call to thee O soul thou actual Me
 And lo thou gently masterest the orbs
 Thou matest Time smilest content at Death
 And fillest swellest full the vastnesses of Space

 Greater than stars or suns
 Bounding O soul thou journeyest forth
 What love than thine and ours could wider amplify
 What aspirations wishes outvie thine and ours O soul
 What dreams of the ideal what plans of purity perfection strength
 What cheerful willingness for others sake to give up all
 For others sake to suffer all

 Reckoning ahead O soul when thou the time achievd
 The seas all crossd weatherd the capes the voyage done
 Surrounded copest frontest God yieldest the aim attaind
 As filld with friendship love complete the Elder Brother found
 The Younger melts in fondness in his arms

 9
 Passage to more than India
 Are thy wings plumed indeed for such far flights
 O soul voyagest thou indeed on voyages like those
 Disportest thou on waters such as those
 Soundest below the Sanscrit and the Vedas
 Then have thy bent unleashd

 Passage to you your shores ye aged fierce enigmas
 Passage to you to mastership of you ye strangling problems
 You strewd with the wrecks of skeletons that living never reachd you

 Passage to more than India
 O secret of the earth and sky
 Of you O waters of the sea O winding creeks and rivers
 Of you O woods and fields of you strong mountains of my land
 Of you O prairies of you gray rocks
 O morning red O clouds O rain and snows
 O day and night passage to you


 O sun and moon and all you stars Sirius and Jupiter
 Passage to you

 Passage immediate passage the blood burns in my veins
 Away O soul hoist instantly the anchor

 Cut the hawsershaul outshake out every sail
 Have we not stood here like trees in the ground long enough
 Have we not groveld here long enough eating and drinking like mere brutes
 Have we not darkend and dazed ourselves with books long enough

 Sail forthsteer for the deep waters only
 Reckless O soul exploring I with thee and thou with me
 For we are bound where mariner has not yet dared to go
 And we will risk the ship ourselves and all

 O my brave soul
 O farther farther sail
 O daring joy but safe are they not all the seas of God
 O farther farther farther sail




BOOK XXVII


Prayer of Columbus

 A batterd wreckd old man
 Thrown on this savage shore far far from home
 Pent by the sea and dark rebellious brows twelve dreary months
 Sore stiff with many toils sickend and nigh to death
 I take my way along the islands edge
 Venting a heavy heart

 I am too full of woe
 Haply I may not live another day
 I cannot rest O God I cannot eat or drink or sleep
 Till I put forth myself my prayer once more to Thee
 Breathe bathe myself once more in Thee commune with Thee
 Report myself once more to Thee

 Thou knowest my years entire my life
 My long and crowded life of active work not adoration merely
 Thou knowest the prayers and vigils of my youth
 Thou knowest my manhoods solemn and visionary meditations
 Thou knowest how before I commenced I devoted all to come to Thee
 Thou knowest I have in age ratified all those vows and strictly kept them
 Thou knowest I have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in Thee
 In shackles prisond in disgrace repining not
 Accepting all from Thee as duly come from Thee

 All my emprises have been filld with Thee
 My speculations plans begun and carried on in thoughts of Thee
 Sailing the deep or journeying the land for Thee
 Intentions purports aspirations mine leaving results to Thee

 O I am sure they really came from Thee
 The urge the ardor the unconquerable will
 The potent felt interior command stronger than words
 A message from the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep
 These sped me on

 By me and these the work so far accomplishd
 By me earths elder cloyd and stifled lands uncloyd unloosd
 By me the hemispheres rounded and tied the unknown to the known

 The end I know not it is all in Thee
 Or small or great I know nothaply what broad fields what lands
 Haply the brutish measureless human undergrowth I know
 Transplanted there may rise to stature knowledge worthy Thee
 Haply the swords I know may there indeed be turnd to reapingtools
 Haply the lifeless cross I know Europes dead cross may bud and
 blossom there

 One effort more my altar this bleak sand
 That Thou O God my life hast lighted
 With ray of light steady ineffable vouchsafed of Thee
 Light rare untellable lighting the very light
 Beyond all signs descriptions languages
 For that O God be it my latest word here on my knees
 Old poor and paralyzed I thank Thee

 My terminus near
 The clouds already closing in upon me
 The voyage balkd the course disputed lost
 I yield my ships to Thee

 My hands my limbs grow nerveless
 My brain feels rackd bewilderd
 Let the old timbers part I will not part
 I will cling fast to Thee O God though the waves buffet me
 Thee Thee at least I know

 Is it the prophets thought I speak or am I raving
 What do I know of life what of myself
 I know not even my own work past or present
 Dim evershifting guesses of it spread before me
 Of newer better worlds their mighty parturition
 Mocking perplexing me

 And these things I see suddenly what mean they
 As if some miracle some hand divine unseald my eyes
 Shadowy vast shapes smile through the air and sky
 And on the distant waves sail countless ships
 And anthems in new tongues I hear saluting me




BOOK XXVIII


The Sleepers

 1
 I wander all night in my vision
 Stepping with light feet swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping
 Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers
 Wandering and confused lost to myself illassorted contradictory
 Pausing gazing bending and stopping

 How solemn they look there stretchd and still
 How quiet they breathe the little children in their cradles

 The wretched features of ennuyes the white features of corpses the
 livid faces of drunkards the sickgray faces of onanists
 The gashd bodies on battlefields the insane in their
 strongdoord rooms the sacred idiots the newborn emerging
 from gates and the dying emerging from gates
 The night pervades them and infolds them

 The married couple sleep calmly in their bed he with his palm on
 the hip of the wife and she with her palm on the hip of the husband
 The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed
 The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs
 And the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt

 The blind sleep and the deaf and dumb sleep
 The prisoner sleeps well in the prison the runaway son sleeps
 The murderer that is to be hung next day how does he sleep
 And the murderd person how does he sleep

 The female that loves unrequited sleeps
 And the male that loves unrequited sleeps
 The head of the moneymaker that plotted all day sleeps
 And the enraged and treacherous dispositions all all sleep

 I stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worstsuffering and
 the most restless
 I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them
 The restless sink in their beds they fitfully sleep

 Now I pierce the darkness new beings appear
 The earth recedes from me into the night
 I saw that it was beautiful and I see that what is not the earth is
 beautiful

 I go from bedside to bedside I sleep close with the other sleepers
 each in turn
 I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers
 And I become the other dreamers

 I am a danceplay up there the fit is whirling me fast

 I am the everlaughingit is new moon and twilight
 I see the hiding of douceurs I see nimble ghosts whichever way look
 Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea and where it is
 neither ground nor sea

 Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine
 Only from me can they hide nothing and would not if they could
 I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides
 And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk
 To lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretchd arms and
 resume the way
 Onward we move a gay gang of blackguards with mirthshouting
 music and wildflapping pennants of joy

 I am the actor the actress the voter the politician
 The emigrant and the exile the criminal that stood in the box
 He who has been famous and he who shall be famous after today
 The stammerer the wellformd person the wasted or feeble person

 I am she who adornd herself and folded her hair expectantly
 My truant lover has come and it is dark

 Double yourself and receive me darkness
 Receive me and my lover too he will not let me go without him

 I roll myself upon you as upon a bed I resign myself to the dusk

 He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover
 He rises with me silently from the bed

 Darkness you are gentler than my lover his flesh was sweaty and panting
 I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me

 My hands are spread forth I pass them in all directions
 I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying

 Be careful darkness already what was it touchd me
 I thought my lover had gone else darkness and he are one
 I hear the heartbeat I follow I fade away

 2
 I descend my western course my sinews are flaccid
 Perfume and youth course through me and I am their wake

 It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old womans
 I sit low in a strawbottom chair and carefully darn my grandsons
 stockings

 It is I too the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight
 I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth

 A shroud I see and I am the shroud I wrap a body and lie in the coffin
 It is dark here under ground it is not evil or pain here it is
 blank here for reasons

 It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be happy
 Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he has enough

 3
 I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies
 of the sea
 His brown hair lies close and even to his head he strikes out with
 courageous arms he urges himself with his legs
 I see his white body I see his undaunted eyes
 I hate the swiftrunning eddies that would dash him headforemost on
 the rocks

 What are you doing you ruffianly redtrickled waves
 Will you kill the courageous giant will you kill him in the prime
 of his middle age

 Steady and long he struggles
 He is baffled bangd bruisd he holds out while his strength
 holds out
 The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood they bear him away
 they roll him swing him turn him
 His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies it is
 continually bruisd on rocks
 Swiftly and ought of sight is borne the brave corpse

 4
 I turn but do not extricate myself
 Confused a pastreading another but with darkness yet

 The beach is cut by the razory icewind the wreckguns sound
 The tempest lulls the moon comes floundering through the drifts

 I look where the ship helplessly heads end on I hear the burst as
 she strikes I hear the howls of dismay they grow fainter and fainter

 I cannot aid with my wringing fingers
 I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me

 I search with the crowd not one of the company is washd to us alive
 In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn

 5
 Now of the older wardays the defeat at Brooklyn
 Washington stands inside the lines he stands on the intrenchd
 hills amid a crowd of officers
 His face is cold and damp he cannot repress the weeping drops
 He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes the color is blanchd
 from his cheeks
 He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by
 their parents

 The same at last and at last when peace is declared
 He stands in the room of the old tavern the wellbelovd soldiers
 all pass through
 The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns
 The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek
 He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another he shakes hands
 and bids goodby to the army

 6
 Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together
 Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on
 the old homestead

 A red squaw came one breakfasttime to the old homestead
 On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rushbottoming chairs
 Her hair straight shiny coarse black profuse halfenvelopd
 her face
 Her step was free and elastic and her voice sounded exquisitely as
 she spoke

 My mother lookd in delight and amazement at the stranger
 She lookd at the freshness of her tallborne face and full and
 pliant limbs
 The more she lookd upon her she loved her
 Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity
 She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace she cookd
 food for her
 She had no work to give her but she gave her remembrance and fondness

 The red squaw staid all the forenoon and toward the middle of the
 afternoon she went away
 O my mother was loth to have her go away
 All the week she thought of her she watchd for her many a month
 She rememberd her many a winter and many a summer
 But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again

 7
 A show of the summer softnessa contact of something unseenan
 amour of the light and air
 I am jealous and overwhelmd with friendliness
 And will go gallivant with the light and air myself

 O love and summer you are in the dreams and in me
 Autumn and winter are in the dreams the farmer goes with his thrift
 The droves and crops increase the barns are wellfilld

 Elements merge in the night ships make tacks in the dreams
 The sailor sails the exile returns home
 The fugitive returns unharmd the immigrant is back beyond months
 and years
 The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood with
 the well known neighbors and faces
 They warmly welcome him he is barefoot again he forgets he is well off
 The Dutchman voyages home and the Scotchman and Welshman voyage
 home and the native of the Mediterranean voyages home
 To every port of England France Spain enter wellfilld ships
 The Swiss foots it toward his hills the Prussian goes his way the
 Hungarian his way and the Pole his way
 The Swede returns and the Dane and Norwegian return

 The homeward bound and the outward bound
 The beautiful lost swimmer the ennuye the onanist the female that
 loves unrequited the moneymaker
 The actor and actress those through with their parts and those
 waiting to commence
 The affectionate boy the husband and wife the voter the nominee
 that is chosen and the nominee that has faild
 The great already known and the great any time after today
 The stammerer the sick the perfectformd the homely
 The criminal that stood in the box the judge that sat and sentenced
 him the fluent lawyers the jury the audience
 The laugher and weeper the dancer the midnight widow the red squaw
 The consumptive the erysipalite the idiot he that is wrongd
 The antipodes and every one between this and them in the dark
 I swear they are averaged nowone is no better than the other
 The night and sleep have likend them and restored them

 I swear they are all beautiful
 Every one that sleeps is beautiful every thing in the dim light is
 beautiful
 The wildest and bloodiest is over and all is peace

 Peace is always beautiful
 The myth of heaven indicates peace and night

 The myth of heaven indicates the soul
 The soul is always beautiful it appears more or it appears less it
 comes or it lags behind
 It comes from its embowerd garden and looks pleasantly on itself
 and encloses the world
 Perfect and clean the genitals previously jettingand perfect and
 clean the womb cohering
 The head wellgrown proportiond and plumb and the bowels and
 joints proportiond and plumb

 The soul is always beautiful
 The universe is duly in order every thing is in its place
 What has arrived is in its place and what waits shall be in its place
 The twisted skull waits the watery or rotten blood waits
 The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long and the child of
 the drunkard waits long and the drunkard himself waits long
 The sleepers that lived and died wait the far advanced are to go on
 in their turns and the far behind are to come on in their turns
 The diverse shall be no less diverse but they shall flow and unite
 they unite now

 8
 The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed
 They flow hand in hand over the whole earth from east to west as
 they lie unclothed
 The Asiatic and African are hand in hand the European and American
 are hand in hand
 Learnd and unlearnd are hand in hand and male and female are hand
 in hand
 The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover they
 press close without lust his lips press her neck
 The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with
 measureless love and the son holds the father in his arms with
 measureless love
 The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the daughter
 The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man friend is
 inarmd by friend
 The scholar kisses the teacher and the teacher kisses the scholar
 the wrong d made right
 The call of the slave is one with the masters call and the master
 salutes the slave
 The felon steps forth from the prison the insane becomes sane the
 suffering of sick persons is relievd
 The sweatings and fevers stop the throat that was unsound is sound
 the lungs of the consumptive are resumed the poor distressd
 head is free
 The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever and smoother
 than ever
 Stiflings and passages open the paralyzed become supple
 The swelld and convulsd and congested awake to themselves in condition
 They pass the invigoration of the night and the chemistry of the
 night and awake

 I too pass from the night
 I stay a while away O night but I return to you again and love you

 Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you
 I am not afraid I have been well brought forward by you
 I love the rich running day but I do not desert her in whom I lay so long
 I know not how I came of you and I know not where I go with you but
 I know I came well and shall go well

 I will stop only a time with the night and rise betimes
 I will duly pass the day O my mother and duly return to you




Transpositions

 Let the reformers descend from the stands where they are forever
 bawlinglet an idiot or insane person appear on each of the stands
 Let judges and criminals be transposedlet the prisonkeepers be
 put in prisonlet those that were prisoners take the keys
 Let them that distrust birth and death lead the rest




BOOK XXIX


To Think of Time

 1
 To think of timeof all that retrospection
 To think of today and the ages continued henceforward

 Have you guessd you yourself would not continue
 Have you dreaded these earthbeetles
 Have you feard the future would be nothing to you

 Is today nothing is the beginningless past nothing
 If the future is nothing they are just as surely nothing

 To think that the sun rose in the eastthat men and women were
 flexible real alivethat every thing was alive
 To think that you and I did not see feel think nor bear our part
 To think that we are now here and bear our part

 2
 Not a day passes not a minute or second without an accouchement
 Not a day passes not a minute or second without a corpse

 The dull nights go over and the dull days also
 The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over
 The physician after long putting off gives the silent and terrible
 look for an answer
 The children come hurried and weeping and the brothers and sisters
 are sent for
 Medicines stand unused on the shelf the camphorsmell has long
 pervaded the rooms
 The faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying
 The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying
 The breath ceases and the pulse of the heart ceases
 The corpse stretches on the bed and the living look upon it
 It is palpable as the living are palpable

 The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight
 But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously
 on the corpse

 3
 To think the thought of death merged in the thought of materials
 To think of all these wonders of city and country and others taking
 great interest in them and we taking no interest in them

 To think how eager we are in building our houses
 To think others shall be just as eager and we quite indifferent

 I see one building the house that serves him a few years or
 seventy or eighty years at most
 I see one building the house that serves him longer than that

 Slowmoving and black lines creep over the whole earththey never
 ceasethey are the burial lines
 He that was President was buried and he that is now President shall
 surely be buried


 4
 A reminiscence of the vulgar fate
 A frequent sample of the life and death of workmen
 Each after his kind

 Cold dash of waves at the ferrywharf posh and ice in the river
 halffrozen mud in the streets
 A gray discouraged sky overhead the short last daylight of December
 A hearse and stages the funeral of an old Broadway stagedriver
 the cortege mostly drivers

 Steady the trot to the cemetery duly rattles the deathbell
 The gate is passd the newdug grave is halted at the living
 alight the hearse uncloses
 The coffin is passd out lowerd and settled the whip is laid on
 the coffin the earth is swiftly shoveld in
 The mound above is flatted with the spadessilence
 A minuteno one moves or speaksit is done
 He is decently put awayis there any thing more

 He was a good fellow freemouthd quicktemperd not badlooking
 Ready with life or death for a friend fond of women gambled ate
 hearty drank hearty
 Had known what it was to be flush grew lowspirited toward the
 last sickend was helpd by a contribution
 Died aged fortyone yearsand that was his funeral

 Thumb extended finger uplifted apron cape gloves strap
 wetweather clothes whip carefully chosen
 Boss spotter starter hostler somebody loafing on you you
 loafing on somebody headway man before and man behind
 Good days work bad days work pet stock mean stock first out
 last out turningin at night
 To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers and he
 there takes no interest in them

 5
 The markets the government the workingmans wages to think what
 account they are through our nights and days
 To think that other workingmen will make just as great account of
 them yet we make little or no account

 The vulgar and the refined what you call sin and what you call
 goodness to think how wide a difference
 To think the difference will still continue to others yet we lie
 beyond the difference

 To think how much pleasure there is
 Do you enjoy yourself in the city or engaged in business or
 planning a nomination and election or with your wife and family
 Or with your mother and sisters or in womanly housework or the
 beautiful maternal cares
 These also flow onward to others you and I flow onward
 But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them

 Your farm profits cropsto think how engrossd you are
 To think there will still be farms profits crops yet for you of
 what avail

 6
 What will be will be well for what is is well
 To take interest is well and not to take interest shall be well

 The domestic joys the dally housework or business the building of
 houses are not phantasms they have weight form location
 Farms profits crops markets wages government are none of them
 phantasms
 The difference between sin and goodness is no delusion
 The earth is not an echo man and his life and all the things of his
 life are wellconsiderd

 You are not thrown to the winds you gather certainly and safely
 around yourself
 Yourself yourself yourself for ever and ever

 7
 It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and
 father it is to identify you
 It is not that you should be undecided but that you should be decided
 Something long preparing and formless is arrived and formd in you
 You are henceforth secure whatever comes or goes

 The threads that were spun are gatherd the wet crosses the warp
 the pattern is systematic

 The preparations have every one been justified
 The orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments the baton
 has given the signal

 The guest that was coming he waited long he is now housed
 He is one of those who are beautiful and happy he is one of those
 that to look upon and be with is enough

 The law of the past cannot be eluded
 The law of the present and future cannot be eluded
 The law of the living cannot be eluded it is eternal
 The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded
 The law of heroes and gooddoers cannot be eluded
 The law of drunkards informers mean persons not one iota thereof
 can be eluded

 8
 Slow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth
 Northerner goes carried and Southerner goes carried and they on the
 Atlantic side and they on the Pacific
 And they between and all through the Mississippi country and all
 over the earth

 The great masters and kosmos are well as they go the heroes and
 gooddoers are well
 The known leaders and inventors and the rich owners and pious and
 distinguishd may be well
 But there is more account than that there is strict account of all

 The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing
 The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing
 The perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they go

 Of and in all these things
 I have dreamd that we are not to be changed so much nor the law of
 us changed
 I have dreamd that heroes and gooddoers shall be under the present
 and past law
 And that murderers drunkards liars shall be under the present and
 past law
 For I have dreamd that the law they are under now is enough

 And I have dreamd that the purpose and essence of the known life
 the transient
 Is to form and decide identity for the unknown life the permanent

 If all came but to ashes of dung
 If maggots and rats ended us then Alarum for we are betrayd
 Then indeed suspicion of death

 Do you suspect death if I were to suspect death I should die now
 Do you think I could walk pleasantly and wellsuited toward annihilation

 Pleasantly and wellsuited I walk
 Whither I walk I cannot define but I know it is good
 The whole universe indicates that it is good
 The past and the present indicate that it is good

 How beautiful and perfect are the animals
 How perfect the earth and the minutest thing upon it
 What is called good is perfect and what is called bad is just as perfect
 The vegetables and minerals are all perfect and the imponderable
 fluids perfect
 Slowly and surely they have passd on to this and slowly and surely
 they yet pass on

 9
 I swear I think now that every thing without exception has an eternal soul
 The trees have rooted in the ground the weeds of the sea have the
 animals

 I swear I think there is nothing but immortality
 That the exquisite scheme is for it and the nebulous float is for
 it and the cohering is for it
 And all preparation is for itand identity is for itand life and
 materials are altogether for it




BOOK XXX WHISPERS OF HEAVENLY DEATH


Darest Thou Now O Soul

 Darest thou now O soul
 Walk out with me toward the unknown region
 Where neither ground is for the feet nor any path to follow

 No map there nor guide
 Nor voice sounding nor touch of human hand
 Nor face with blooming flesh nor lips nor eyes are in that land

 I know it not O soul
 Nor dost thou all is a blank before us
 All waits undreamd of in that region that inaccessible land

 Till when the ties loosen
 All but the ties eternal Time and Space
 Nor darkness gravitation sense nor any bounds bounding us

 Then we burst forth we float
 In Time and Space O soul prepared for them
 Equal equipt at last O joy O fruit of all them to fulfil O soul




Whispers of Heavenly Death

 Whispers of heavenly death murmurd I hear
 Labial gossip of night sibilant chorals
 Footsteps gently ascending mystical breezes wafted soft and low
 Ripples of unseen rivers tides of a current flowing forever flowing
 Or is it the plashing of tears the measureless waters of human tears

 I see just see skyward great cloudmasses
 Mournfully slowly they roll silently swelling and mixing
 With at times a halfdimmd saddend faroff star
 Appearing and disappearing

 Some parturition rather some solemn immortal birth
 On the frontiers to eyes impenetrable
 Some soul is passing over




Chanting the Square Deific

 1
 Chanting the square deific out of the One advancing out of the sides
 Out of the old and new out of the square entirely divine
 Solid foursided all the sides needed from this side Jehovah am I
 Old Brahm I and I Saturnius am
 Not Time affects meI am Time old modern as any
 Unpersuadable relentless executing righteous judgments
 As the Earth the Father the brown old Kronos with laws
 Aged beyond computation yet never new ever with those mighty laws rolling
 Relentless I forgive no manwhoever sins diesI will have that mans life
 Therefore let none expect mercyhave the seasons gravitation the
 appointed days mercy no more have I
 But as the seasons and gravitation and as all the appointed days
 that forgive not
 I dispense from this side judgments inexorable without the least remorse

 2
 Consolator most mild the promisd one advancing
 With gentle hand extended the mightier God am I
 Foretold by prophets and poets in their most rapt prophecies and poems
 From this side lo the Lord Christ gazeslo Hermes Ilo mine is
 Hercules face
 All sorrow labor suffering I tallying it absorb in myself
 Many times have I been rejected taunted put in prison and
 crucified and many times shall be again
 All the world have I given up for my dear brothers and sisters
 sake for the souls sake
 Wanding my way through the homes of men rich or poor with the kiss
 of affection
 For I am affection I am the cheerbringing God with hope and
 allenclosing charity
 With indulgent words as to children with fresh and sane words mine only
 Young and strong I pass knowing well I am destind myself to an
 early death
 But my charity has no deathmy wisdom dies not neither early nor late
 And my sweet love bequeathd here and elsewhere never dies

 3
 Aloof dissatisfied plotting revolt
 Comrade of criminals brother of slaves
 Crafty despised a drudge ignorant
 With sudra face and worn brow black but in the depths of my heart
 proud as any
 Lifted now and always against whoever scorning assumes to rule me
 Morose full of guile full of reminiscences brooding with many wiles
 Though it was thought I was baffled and dispeld and my wiles
 done but that will never be
 Defiant I Satan still live still utter words in new lands duly
 appearing and old ones also
 Permanent here from my side warlike equal with any real as any
 Nor time nor change shall ever change me or my words

 4
 Santa Spirita breather life
 Beyond the light lighter than light
 Beyond the flames of hell joyous leaping easily above hell
 Beyond Paradise perfumed solely with mine own perfume
 Including all life on earth touching including God including
 Saviour and Satan
 Ethereal pervading all for without me what were all what were God
 Essence of forms life of the real identities permanent positive
 namely the unseen
 Life of the great round world the sun and stars and of man I the
 general soul
 Here the square finishing the solid I the most solid
 Breathe my breath also through these songs




Of Him I Love Day and Night

 Of him I love day and night I dreamd I heard he was dead
 And I dreamd I went where they had buried him I love but he was
 not in that place
 And I dreamd I wanderd searching among burialplaces to find him
 And I found that every place was a burialplace
 The houses full of life were equally full of death this house is now
 The streets the shipping the places of amusement the Chicago
 Boston Philadelphia the Mannahatta were as full of the dead as
 of the living
 And fuller O vastly fuller of the dead than of the living
 And what I dreamd I will henceforth tell to every person and age
 And I stand henceforth bound to what I dreamd
 And now I am willing to disregard burialplaces and dispense with them
 And if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere
 even in the room where I eat or sleep I should be satisfied
 And if the corpse of any one I love or if my own corpse be duly
 renderd to powder and pourd in the sea I shall be satisfied
 Or if it be distributed to the winds I shall be satisfied




Yet Yet Ye Downcast Hours

 Yet yet ye downcast hours I know ye also
 Weights of lead how ye clog and cling at my ankles
 Earth to a chamber of mourning turnsI hear the oerweening mocking
 voice
 Matter is conquerormatter triumphant only continues onward

 Despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me
 The call of my nearest lover putting forth alarmd uncertain
 The sea I am quickly to sail come tell me
 Come tell me where I am speeding tell me my destination

 I understand your anguish but I cannot help you
 I approach hear behold the sad mouth the look out of the eyes
 your mute inquiry
 Whither I go from the bed I recline on come tell me
 Old age alarmd uncertaina young womans voice appealing to
 me for comfort
 A young mans voice Shall I not escape




As If a Phantom Caressd Me

 As if a phantom caressd me
 I thought I was not alone walking here by the shore
 But the one I thought was with me as now I walk by the shore the
 one I loved that caressd me
 As I lean and look through the glimmering light that one has
 utterly disappeard
 And those appear that are hateful to me and mock me




Assurances

 I need no assurances I am a man who is preoccupied of his own soul
 I do not doubt that from under the feet and beside the hands and
 face I am cognizant of are now looking faces I am not cognizant
 of calm and actual faces
 I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent in
 any iota of the world
 I do not doubt I am limitless and that the universes are limitless
 in vain I try to think how limitless
 I do not doubt that the orbs and the systems of orbs play their
 swift sports through the air on purpose and that I shall one day
 be eligible to do as much as they and more than they
 I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on millions of years
 I do not doubt interiors have their interiors and exteriors have
 their exteriors and that the eyesight has another eyesight and
 the hearing another hearing and the voice another voice
 I do not doubt that the passionatelywept deaths of young men are
 provided for and that the deaths of young women and the
 deaths of little children are provided for
 Did you think Life was so well provided for and Death the purport
 of all Life is not well provided for
 I do not doubt that wrecks at sea no matter what the horrors of
 them no matter whose wife child husband father lover has
 gone down are provided for to the minutest points
 I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen anywhere at any
 time is provided for in the inherences of things
 I do not think Life provides for all and for Time and Space but I
 believe Heavenly Death provides for all




Quicksand Years

 Quicksand years that whirl me I know not whither
 Your schemes politics fail lines give way substances mock and elude me
 Only the theme I sing the great and strongpossessd soul eludes not
 Onesself must never give waythat is the final substancethat
 out of all is sure
 Out of politics triumphs battles life what at last finally remains
 When shows break up what but OnesSelf is sure




That Music Always Round Me

 That music always round me unceasing unbeginning yet long
 untaught I did not hear
 But now the chorus I hear and am elated
 A tenor strong ascending with power and health with glad notes of
 daybreak I hear
 A soprano at intervals sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense waves
 A transparent base shuddering lusciously under and through the universe
 The triumphant tutti the funeral wailings with sweet flutes and
 violins all these I fill myself with
 I hear not the volumes of sound merely I am moved by the exquisite
 meanings
 I listen to the different voices winding in and out striving
 contending with fiery vehemence to excel each other in emotion
 I do not think the performers know themselvesbut now I think
 begin to know them




What Ship Puzzled at Sea

 What ship puzzled at sea cons for the true reckoning
 Or coming in to avoid the bars and follow the channel a perfect
 pilot needs
 Here sailor here ship take aboard the most perfect pilot
 Whom in a little boat putting off and rowing I hailing you offer




A Noiseless Patient Spider

 A noiseless patient spider
 I markd where on a little promontory it stood isolated
 Markd how to explore the vacant vast surrounding
 It launchd forth filament filament filament out of itself
 Ever unreeling them ever tirelessly speeding them

 And you O my soul where you stand
 Surrounded detached in measureless oceans of space
 Ceaselessly musing venturing throwing seeking the spheres to
 connect them
 Till the bridge you will need be formd till the ductile anchor hold
 Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere O my soul




O Living Always Always Dying

 O living always always dying
 O the burials of me past and present
 O me while I stride ahead material visible imperious as ever
 O me what I was for years now dead I lament not I am content
 O to disengage myself from those corpses of me which I turn and
 look at where I cast them
 To pass on O living always living and leave the corpses behind




To One Shortly to Die

 From all the rest I single out you having a message for you
 You are to dielet others tell you what they please I cannot prevaricate
 I am exact and merciless but I love youthere is no escape for you

 Softly I lay my right hand upon you you ust feel it
 I do not argue I bend my head close and half envelop it
 I sit quietly by I remain faithful
 I am more than nurse more than parent or neighbor
 I absolve you from all except yourself spiritual bodily that is
 eternal you yourself will surely escape
 The corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious

 The sun bursts through in unlookedfor directions
 Strong thoughts fill you and confidence you smile
 You forget you are sick as I forget you are sick
 You do not see the medicines you do not mind the weeping friends
 I am with you
 I exclude others from you there is nothing to be commiserated
 I do not commiserate I congratulate you




Night on the Prairies

 Night on the prairies
 The supper is over the fire on the ground burns low
 The wearied emigrants sleep wrapt in their blankets
 I walk by myselfI stand and look at the stars which I think now
 never realized before

 Now I absorb immortality and peace
 I admire death and test propositions

 How plenteous how spiritual how resume
 The same old man and soulthe same old aspirations and the same content

 I was thinking the day most splendid till I saw what the notday exhibited
 I was thinking this globe enough till there sprang out so noiseless
 around me myriads of other globes

 Now while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me I will
 measure myself by them
 And now touchd with the lives of other globes arrived as far along
 as those of the earth
 Or waiting to arrive or passd on farther than those of the earth
 I henceforth no more ignore them than I ignore my own life
 Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine or waiting to arrive

 O I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me as the day cannot
 I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death




Thought

 As I sit with others at a great feast suddenly while the music is playing
 To my mind whence it comes I know not spectral in mist of a
 wreck at sea
 Of certain ships how they sail from port with flying streamers and
 wafted kisses and that is the last of them
 Of the solemn and murky mystery about the fate of the President
 Of the flower of the marine science of fifty generations founderd
 off the Northeast coast and going downof the steamship Arctic
 going down
 Of the veild tableauwomen gatherd together on deck pale heroic
 waiting the moment that draws so closeO the moment

 A huge soba few bubblesthe white foam spirting upand then the
 women gone
 Sinking there while the passionless wet flows onand I now
 pondering Are those women indeed gone
 Are souls drownd and destroyd so
 Is only matter triumphant




The Last Invocation

 At the last tenderly
 From the walls of the powerful fortressd house
 From the clasp of the knitted locks from the keep of the wellclosed doors
 Let me be wafted

 Let me glide noiselessly forth
 With the key of softness unlock the lockswith a whisper
 Set ope the doors O soul

 Tenderlybe not impatient
 Strong is your hold O mortal flesh
 Strong is your hold O love




As I Watch the Ploughman Ploughing

 As I watchd the ploughman ploughing
 Or the sower sowing in the fields or the harvester harvesting
 I saw there too O life and death your analogies
 Life life is the tillage and Death is the harvest according




Pensive and Faltering

 Pensive and faltering
 The words the Dead I write
 For living are the Dead
 Haply the only living only real
 And I the apparition I the spectre




BOOK XXXI


Thou Mother with Thy Equal Brood

 1
 Thou Mother with thy equal brood
 Thou varied chain of different States yet one identity only
 A special song before I go Id sing oer all the rest
 For thee the future

 Id sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality
 Id fashion thy ensemble including body and soul
 Id show away ahead thy real Union and how it may be accomplishd

 The paths to the house I seek to make
 But leave to those to come the house itself

 Belief I sing and preparation
 As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the present only
 But greater still from what is yet to come
 Out of that formula for thee I sing

 2
 As a strong bird on pinions free
 Joyous the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving
 Such be the thought Id think of thee America
 Such be the recitative Id bring for thee

 The conceits of the poets of other lands Id bring thee not
 Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long
 Nor rhyme nor the classics nor perfume of foreign court or indoor
 library
 But an odor Id bring as from forests of pine in Maine or breath of
 an Illinois prairie
 With open airs of Virginia or Georgia or Tennessee or from Texas
 uplands or Floridas glades
 Or the Saguenays black stream or the wide blue spread of Huron
 With presentment of Yellowstones scenes or Yosemite
 And murmuring under pervading all Id bring the rustling seasound
 That endlessly sounds from the two Great Seas of the world

 And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother
 Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee mindformulas fitted
 for thee real and sane and large as these and thee
 Thou mounting higher diving deeper than we knew thou
 transcendental Union
 By thee fact to be justified blended with thought
 Thought of man justified blended with God
 Through thy idea lo the immortal reality
 Through thy reality lo the immortal idea

 3
 Brain of the New World what a task is thine
 To formulate the Modernout of the peerless grandeur of the modern
 Out of thyself comprising science to recast poems churches art
 Recast maybe discard them end themmaybe their work is done
 who knows
 By vision hand conception on the background of the mighty past the dead
 To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present

 And yet thou living present brain heir of the dead the Old World brain
 Thou that lay folded like an unborn babe within its folds so long
 Thou carefully prepared by it so longhaply thou but unfoldest it
 only maturest it
 It to eventuate in theethe essence of the bygone time containd in thee
 Its poems churches arts unwitting to themselves destined with
 reference to thee
 Thou but the apples long long long agrowing
 The fruit of all the Old ripening today in thee

 4
 Sail sail thy best ship of Democracy
 Of value is thy freight tis not the Present only
 The Past is also stored in thee
 Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone not of the Western
 continent alone
 Earths resume entire floats on thy keel O ship is steadied by thy spars
 With thee Time voyages in trust the antecedent nations sink or
 swim with thee
 With all their ancient struggles martyrs heroes epics wars thou
 bearst the other continents
 Theirs theirs as much as thine the destinationport triumphant
 Steer then with good strong hand and wary eye O helmsman thou
 carriest great companions
 Venerable priestly Asia sails this day with thee
 And royal feudal Europe sails with thee

 5
 Beautiful world of new superber birth that rises to my eyes
 Like a limitless golden cloud filling the westernr sky
 Emblem of general maternity lifted above all
 Sacred shape of the bearer of daughters and sons
 Out of thy teeming womb thy giant babes in ceaseless procession issuing
 Acceding from such gestation taking and giving continual strength
 and life
 World of the realworld of the twain in one
 World of the soul born by the world of the real alone led to
 identity body by it alone
 Yet in beginning only incalculable masses of composite precious materials
 By historys cycles forwarded by every nation language hither sent
 Ready collected here a freer vast electric world to be
 constructed here
 The true New World the world of orbic science morals literatures
 to come
 Thou wonder world yet undefined unformd neither do I define thee
 How can I pierce the impenetrable blank of the future
 I feel thy ominous greatness evil as well as good
 I watch thee advancing absorbing the present transcending the past
 I see thy light lighting and thy shadow shadowing as if the entire globe
 But I do not undertake to define thee hardly to comprehend thee
 I but thee name thee prophesy as now
 I merely thee ejaculate

 Thee in thy future
 Thee in thy only permanent life career thy own unloosend mind
 thy soaring spirit
 Thee as another equally needed sun radiant ablaze swiftmoving
 fructifying all
 Thee risen in potent cheerfulness and joy in endless great hilarity
 Scattering for good the cloud that hung so long that weighd so
 long upon the mind of man
 The doubt suspicion dread of gradual certain decadence of man
 Thee in thy larger saner brood of female malethee in thy
 athletes moral spiritual South North West East
 To thy immortal breasts Mother of All thy every daughter son
 endeard alike forever equal
 Thee in thy own musicians singers artists unborn yet but certain
 Thee in thy moral wealth and civilization until which thy proudest
 material civilization must remain in vain
 Thee in thy allsupplying allenclosing worshipthee in no single
 bible saviour merely
 Thy saviours countless latent within thyself thy bibles incessant
 within thyself equal to any divine as any
 Thy soaring course thee formulating not in thy two great wars nor
 in thy centurys visible growth
 But far more in these leaves and chants thy chants great Mother
 Thee in an education grown of thee in teachers studies students
 born of thee
 Thee in thy democratic fetes enmasse thy high original festivals
 operas lecturers preachers
 Thee in thy ultimate the preparations only now completed the
 edifice on sure foundations tied
 Thee in thy pinnacles intellect thought thy topmost rational
 joys thy love and godlike aspiration
 In thy resplendent coming literati thy fulllungd orators thy
 sacerdotal bards kosmic savans
 These these in thee certain to come today I prophesy

 6
 Land tolerating all accepting all not for the good alone all good
 for thee
 Land in the realms of God to be a realm unto thyself
 Under the rule of God to be a rule unto thyself

 Lo where arise three peerless stars
 To be thy natal stars my country Ensemble Evolution Freedom
 Set in the sky of Law

 Land of unprecedented faith Gods faith
 Thy soil thy very subsoil all upheavd
 The general inner earth so long so sedulously draped over now hence
 for what it is boldly laid bare
 Opend by thee to heavens light for benefit or bale

 Not for success alone
 Not to fairsail unintermitted always
 The storm shall dash thy face the murk of war and worse than war
 shall cover thee all over
 Wert capable of war its tug and trials be capable of peace its trials
 For the tug and mortal strain of nations come at last in prosperous
 peace not war
 In many a smiling mask death shall approach beguiling thee thou in
 disease shalt swelter
 The livid cancer spread its hideous claws clinging upon thy
 breasts seeking to strike thee deep within
 Consumption of the worst moral consumption shall rouge thy face
 with hectic
 But thou shalt face thy fortunes thy diseases and surmount them all
 Whatever they are today and whatever through time they may be
 They each and all shall lift and pass away and cease from thee
 While thou Times spirals rounding out of thyself thyself still
 extricating fusing
 Equable natural mystical Union thou the mortal with immortal blent
 Shalt soar toward the fulfilment of the future the spirit of the
 body and the mind
 The soul its destinies

 The soul its destinies the real real
 Purport of all these apparitions of the real
 In thee America the soul its destinies
 Thou globe of globes thou wonder nebulous
 By many a throe of heat and cold convulsd by these thyself solidifying
 Thou mental moral orbthou New indeed new Spiritual World
 The Present holds thee notfor such vast growth as thine
 For such unparalleld flight as thine such brood as thine
 The FUTURE only holds thee and can hold thee




A Paumanok Picture

 Two boats with nets lying off the seabeach quite still
 Ten fishermen waitingthey discover a thick school of mossbonkers
 they drop the joind seineends in the water
 The boats separate and row off each on its rounding course to the
 beach enclosing the mossbonkers
 The net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore
 Some of the fishermen lounge in their boats others stand
 ankledeep in the water poisd on strong legs
 The boats partly drawn up the water slapping against them
 Strewd on the sand in heaps and windrows well out from the water
 the greenbackd spotted mossbonkers




BOOK XXXII FROM NOON TO STARRY NIGHT


Thou Orb Aloft FullDazzling

 Thou orb aloft fulldazzling thou hot October noon
 Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand
 The sibilant near sea with vistas far and foam
 And tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue
 O sun of noon refulgent my special word to thee

 Hear me illustrious
 Thy lover me for always I have loved thee
 Even as basking babe then happy boy alone by some wood edge thy
 touchingdistant beams enough
 Or man matured or young or old as now to thee I launch my invocation

 Thou canst not with thy dumbness me deceive
 I know before the fitting man all Nature yields
 Though answering not in words the skies trees hear his voiceand
 thou O sun
 As for thy throes thy perturbations sudden breaks and shafts of
 flame gigantic
 I understand them I know those flames those perturbations well

 Thou that with fructifying heat and light
 Oer myriad farms oer lands and waters North and South
 Oer Mississippis endless course oer Texas grassy plains
 Kanadas woods
 Oer all the globe that turns its face to thee shining in space
 Thou that impartially enfoldest all not only continents seas
 Thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so liberally
 Shed shed thyself on mine and me with but a fleeting ray out of
 thy million millions
 Strike through these chants

 Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these
 Prepare the later afternoon of me myselfprepare my lengthening shadows
 Prepare my starry nights




Faces

 1
 Sauntering the pavement or riding the country byroad faces
 Faces of friendship precision caution suavity ideality
 The spiritualprescient face the always welcome common benevolent face
 The face of the singing of music the grand faces of natural lawyers
 and judges broad at the backtop
 The faces of hunters and fishers bulged at the brows the shaved
 blanchd faces of orthodox citizens
 The pure extravagant yearning questioning artists face
 The ugly face of some beautiful soul the handsome detested or
 despised face
 The sacred faces of infants the illuminated face of the mother of
 many children
 The face of an amour the face of veneration
 The face as of a dream the face of an immobile rock
 The face withdrawn of its good and bad a castrated face
 A wild hawk his wings clippd by the clipper
 A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and knife of the gelder

 Sauntering the pavement thus or crossing the ceaseless ferry faces
 and faces and faces
 I see them and complain not and am content with all

 2
 Do you suppose I could be content with all if I thought them their
 own finale

 This now is too lamentable a face for a man
 Some abject louse asking leave to be cringing for it
 Some milknosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig to its hole

 This face is a dogs snout sniffing for garbage
 Snakes nest in that mouth I hear the sibilant threat

 This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea
 Its sleepy and wobbling icebergs crunch as they go

 This is a face of bitter herbs this an emetic they need no label
 And more of the drugshelf laudanum caoutchouc or hogslard

 This face is an epilepsy its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly cry
 Its veins down the neck distend its eyes roll till they show
 nothing but their whites
 Its teeth grit the palms of the hands are cut by the turndin nails
 The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground while he
 speculates well

 This face is bitten by vermin and worms
 And this is some murderers knife with a halfpulld scabbard

 This face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee
 An unceasing deathbell tolls there

 3
 Features of my equals would you trick me with your creasd and
 cadaverous march
 Well you cannot trick me

 I see your rounded nevererased flow
 I see neath the rims of your haggard and mean disguises

 Splay and twist as you like poke with the tangling fores of fishes or rats
 Youll be unmuzzled you certainly will

 I saw the face of the most smeard and slobbering idiot they had at
 the asylum
 And I knew for my consolation what they knew not
 I knew of the agents that emptied and broke my brother
 The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen tenement
 And I shall look again in a score or two of ages
 And I shall meet the real landlord perfect and unharmd every inch
 as good as myself

 4
 The Lord advances and yet advances
 Always the shadow in front always the reachd hand bringing up the
 laggards

 Out of this face emerge banners and horsesO superb I see what is coming
 I see the high pioneercaps see staves of runners clearing the way
 I hear victorious drums

 This face is a lifeboat
 This is the face commanding and bearded it asks no odds of the rest
 This face is flavord fruit ready for eating
 This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme of all good

 These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake
 They show their descent from the Master himself

 Off the word I have spoken I except not onered white black are
 all deific
 In each house is the ovum it comes forth after a thousand years

 Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb me
 Tall and sufficient stand behind and make signs to me
 I read the promise and patiently wait

 This is a fullgrown lilys face
 She speaks to the limberhippd man near the garden pickets
 Come here she blushingly cries Come nigh to me limberhippd man
 Stand at my side till I lean as high as I can upon you
 Fill me with albescent honey bend down to me
 Rub to me with your chafing beard rub to my breast and shoulders

 5
 The old face of the mother of many children
 Whist I am fully content

 Lulld and late is the smoke of the Firstday morning
 It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fences
 It hangs thin by the sassafras and wildcherry and catbrier under them

 I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree
 I heard what the singers were singing so long
 Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the white froth and the waterblue

 Behold a woman
 She looks out from her quaker cap her face is clearer and more
 beautiful than the sky

 She sits in an armchair under the shaded porch of the farmhouse
 The sun just shines on her old white head

 Her ample gown is of creamhued linen
 Her grandsons raised the flax and her granddaughters spun it with
 the distaff and the wheel

 The melodious character of the earth
 The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go and does not wish to go
 The justified mother of men




The Mystic Trumpeter

 1
 Hark some wild trumpeter some strange musician
 Hovering unseen in air vibrates capricious tunes tonight

 I hear thee trumpeter listening alert I catch thy notes
 Now pouring whirling like a tempest round me
 Now low subdued now in the distance lost

 2
 Come nearer bodiless one haply in thee resounds
 Some dead composer haply thy pensive life
 Was filld with aspirations high unformd ideals
 Waves oceans musical chaotically surging
 That now ecstatic ghost close to me bending thy cornet echoing pealing
 Gives out to no ones ears but mine but freely gives to mine
 That I may thee translate

 3
 Blow trumpeter free and clear I follow thee
 While at thy liquid prelude glad serene
 The fretting world the streets the noisy hours of day withdraw
 A holy calm descends like dew upon me
 I walk in cool refreshing night the walks of Paradise
 I scent the grass the moist air and the roses
 Thy song expands my numbd imbonded spirit thou freest launchest me
 Floating and basking upon heavens lake

 4
 Blow again trumpeter and for my sensuous eyes
 Bring the old pageants show the feudal world

 What charm thy music works thou makest pass before me
 Ladies and cavaliers long dead barons are in their castle halls
 the troubadours are singing
 Armd knights go forth to redress wrongs some in quest of the holy Graal
 I see the tournament I see the contestants incased in heavy armor
 seated on stately champing horses
 I hear the shouts the sounds of blows and smiting steel
 I see the Crusaders tumultuous armieshark how the cymbals clang
 Lo where the monks walk in advance bearing the cross on high

 5
 Blow again trumpeter and for thy theme
 Take now the enclosing theme of all the solvent and the setting
 Love that is pulse of all the sustenance and the pang
 The heart of man and woman all for love
 No other theme but loveknitting enclosing alldiffusing love

 O how the immortal phantoms crowd around me
 I see the vast alembic ever working I see and know the flames that
 heat the world
 The glow the blush the beating hearts of lovers
 So blissful happy some and some so silent dark and nigh to death
 Love that is all the earth to loverslove that mocks time and space
 Love that is day and nightlove that is sun and moon and stars
 Love that is crimson sumptuous sick with perfume
 No other words but words of love no other thought but love

 6
 Blow again trumpeterconjure wars alarums

 Swift to thy spell a shuddering hum like distant thunder rolls
 Lo where the armd men hastenlo mid the clouds of dust the glint
 of bayonets
 I see the grimefaced cannoneers I mark the rosy flash amid the
 smoke I hear the cracking of the guns
 Nor war alonethy fearful musicsong wild player brings every
 sight of fear
 The deeds of ruthless brigands rapine murderI hear the cries for help
 I see ships foundering at sea I behold on deck and below deck the
 terrible tableaus

 7
 O trumpeter methinks I am myself the instrument thou playest
 Thou meltst my heart my brainthou movest drawest changest
 them at will
 And now thy sullen notes send darkness through me
 Thou takest away all cheering light all hope
 I see the enslaved the overthrown the hurt the opprest of the
 whole earth
 I feel the measureless shame and humiliation of my race it becomes
 all mine
 Mine too the revenges of humanity the wrongs of ages baffled feuds
 and hatreds
 Utter defeat upon me weighsall lostthe foe victorious
 Yet mid the ruins Pride colossal stands unshaken to the last
 Endurance resolution to the last


 8
 Now trumpeter for thy close
 Vouchsafe a higher strain than any yet
 Sing to my soul renew its languishing faith and hope
 Rouse up my slow belief give me some vision of the future
 Give me for once its prophecy and joy

 O glad exulting culminating song
 A vigor more than earths is in thy notes
 Marches of victoryman disenthraldthe conqueror at last
 Hymns to the universal God from universal manall joy
 A reborn race appearsa perfect world all joy
 Women and men in wisdom innocence and healthall joy
 Riotous laughing bacchanals filld with joy
 War sorrow suffering gonethe rank earth purgednothing but joy left
 The ocean filld with joythe atmosphere all joy
 Joy joy in freedom worship love joy in the ecstasy of life
 Enough to merely be enough to breathe
 Joy joy all over joy




To a Locomotive in Winter

 Thee for my recitative
 Thee in the driving storm even as now the snow the winterday declining
 Thee in thy panoply thy measurd dual throbbing and thy beat convulsive
 Thy black cylindric body golden brass and silvery steel
 Thy ponderous sidebars parallel and connecting rods gyrating
 shuttling at thy sides
 Thy metrical now swelling pant and roar now tapering in the distance
 Thy great protruding headlight fixd in front
 Thy long pale floating vaporpennants tinged with delicate purple
 The dense and murky clouds outbelching from thy smokestack
 Thy knitted frame thy springs and valves the tremulous twinkle of
 thy wheels
 Thy train of cars behind obedient merrily following
 Through gale or calm now swift now slack yet steadily careering
 Type of the modernemblem of motion and powerpulse of the continent
 For once come serve the Muse and merge in verse even as here I see thee
 With storm and buffeting gusts of wind and falling snow
 By day thy warning ringing bell to sound its notes
 By night thy silent signal lamps to swing

 Fiercethroated beauty
 Roll through my chant with all thy lawless music thy swinging lamps
 at night
 Thy madlywhistled laughter echoing rumbling like an earthquake
 rousing all
 Law of thyself complete thine own track firmly holding
 No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano thine
 Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills returnd
 Launchd oer the prairies wide across the lakes
 To the free skies unpent and glad and strong




O MagnetSouth

 O magnetsouth O glistening perfumed South my South
 O quick mettle rich blood impulse and love good and evil O all
 dear to me
 O dear to me my birththingsall moving things and the trees where
 I was bornthe grains plants rivers
 Dear to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they flow distant
 over flats of slivery sands or through swamps
 Dear to me the Roanoke the Savannah the Altamahaw the Pedee the
 Tombigbee the Santee the Coosa and the Sabine
 O pensive far away wandering I return with my soul to haunt their
 banks again
 Again in Florida I float on transparent lakes I float on the
 Okeechobee I cross the hummockland or through pleasant openings
 or dense forests
 I see the parrots in the woods I see the papawtree and the
 blossoming titi
 Again sailing in my coaster on deck I coast off Georgia I coast
 up the Carolinas
 I see where the liveoak is growing I see where the yellowpine
 the scented baytree the lemon and orange the cypress the
 graceful palmetto
 I pass rude seaheadlands and enter Pamlico sound through an inlet
 and dart my vision inland
 O the cotton plant the growing fields of rice sugar hemp
 The cactus guarded with thorns the laureltree with large white flowers
 The range afar the richness and barrenness the old woods charged
 with mistletoe and trailing moss
 The piney odor and the gloom the awful natural stillness here in
 these dense swamps the freebooter carries his gun and the
 fugitive has his conceald hut
 O the strange fascination of these halfknown halfimpassable
 swamps infested by reptiles resounding with the bellow of the
 alligator the sad noises of the nightowl and the wildcat and
 the whirr of the rattlesnake
 The mockingbird the American mimic singing all the forenoon
 singing through the moonlit night
 The hummingbird the wild turkey the raccoon the opossum
 A Kentucky cornfield the tall graceful longleavd corn
 slender flapping bright green with tassels with beautiful
 ears each wellsheathd in its husk
 O my heart O tender and fierce pangs I can stand them not I will depart
 O to be a Virginian where I grew up O to be a Carolinian
 O longings irrepressible O I will go back to old Tennessee and
 never wander more




Mannahatta

 I was asking for something specific and perfect for my city
 Whereupon lo upsprang the aboriginal name

 Now I see what there is in a name a word liquid sane unruly
 musical selfsufficient
 I see that the word of my city is that word from of old
 Because I see that word nested in nests of waterbays superb
 Rich hemmd thick all around with sailships and steamships an
 island sixteen miles long solidfounded
 Numberless crowded streets high growths of iron slender strong
 light splendidly uprising toward clear skies
 Tides swift and ample wellloved by me toward sundown
 The flowing seacurrents the little islands larger adjoining
 islands the heights the villas
 The countless masts the white shoresteamers the lighters the
 ferryboats the black seasteamers wellmodeld
 The downtown streets the jobbers houses of business the houses
 of business of the shipmerchants and moneybrokers the riverstreets
 Immigrants arriving fifteen or twenty thousand in a week
 The carts hauling goods the manly race of drivers of horses the
 brownfaced sailors
 The summer air the bright sun shining and the sailing clouds aloft
 The winter snows the sleighbells the broken ice in the river
 passing along up or down with the floodtide or ebbtide
 The mechanics of the city the masters wellformd
 beautifulfaced looking you straight in the eyes
 Trottoirs throngd vehicles Broadway the women the shops and shows
 A million peoplemanners free and superbopen voiceshospitality
 the most courageous and friendly young men
 City of hurried and sparkling waters city of spires and masts
 City nested in bays my city




All Is Truth

 O me man of slack faith so long
 Standing aloof denying portions so long
 Only aware today of compact alldiffused truth
 Discovering today there is no lie or form of lie and can be none
 but grows as inevitably upon itself as the truth does upon itself
 Or as any law of the earth or any natural production of the earth does

 This is curious and may not be realized immediately but it must be
 realized
 I feel in myself that I represent falsehoods equally with the rest
 And that the universe does

 Where has faild a perfect return indifferent of lies or the truth
 Is it upon the ground or in water or fire or in the spirit of man
 or in the meat and blood

 Meditating among liars and retreating sternly into myself I see
 that there are really no liars or lies after all
 And that nothing fails its perfect return and that what are called
 lies are perfect returns
 And that each thing exactly represents itself and what has preceded it
 And that the truth includes all and is compact just as much as
 space is compact
 And that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount of the truthbut
 that all is truth without exception
 And henceforth I will go celebrate any thing I see or am
 And sing and laugh and deny nothing




A Riddle Song

 That which eludes this verse and any verse
 Unheard by sharpest ear unformd in clearest eye or cunningest mind
 Nor lore nor fame nor happiness nor wealth
 And yet the pulse of every heart and life throughout the world incessantly
 Which you and I and all pursuing ever ever miss
 Open but still a secret the real of the real an illusion
 Costless vouchsafed to each yet never man the owner
 Which poets vainly seek to put in rhyme historians in prose
 Which sculptor never chiseld yet nor painter painted
 Which vocalist never sung nor orator nor actor ever utterd
 Invoking here and now I challenge for my song

 Indifferently mid public private haunts in solitude
 Behind the mountain and the wood
 Companion of the citys busiest streets through the assemblage
 It and its radiations constantly glide

 In looks of fair unconscious babes
 Or strangely in the coffind dead
 Or show of breaking dawn or stars by night
 As some dissolving delicate film of dreams
 Hiding yet lingering

 Two little breaths of words comprising it
 Two words yet all from first to last comprised in it

 How ardently for it
 How many ships have saild and sunk for it

 How many travelers started from their homes and neer returnd
 How much of genius boldly staked and lost for it
 What countless stores of beauty love venturd for it
 How all superbest deeds since Time began are traceable to itand
 shall be to the end
 How all heroic martyrdoms to it
 How justified by it the horrors evils battles of the earth
 How the bright fascinating lambent flames of it in every age and
 land have drawn mens eyes
 Rich as a sunset on the Norway coast the sky the islands and the cliffs
 Or midnights silent glowing northern lights unreachable

 Haply Gods riddle it so vague and yet so certain
 The soul for it and all the visible universe for it
 And heaven at last for it




Excelsior

 Who has gone farthest for I would go farther
 And who has been just for I would be the most just person of the earth
 And who most cautious for I would be more cautious

 And who has been bold and true for I would be the boldest and

 And who has made hymns fit for the earth for I am mad with
 devouring ecstasy to make joyous hymns for the whole earth




Ah Poverties Wincings and Sulky Retreats

 Ah poverties wincings and sulky retreats
 Ah you foes that in conflict have overcome me
 For what is my life or any mans life but a conflict with foes the
 old the incessant war
 You degradations you tussle with passions and appetites
 You smarts from dissatisfied friendships ah wounds the sharpest of all
 You toil of painful and choked articulations you meannesses
 You shallow tonguetalks at tables my tongue the shallowest of any
 You broken resolutions you racking angers you smotherd ennuis
 Ah think not you finally triumph my real self has yet to come forth
 It shall yet march forth oermastering till all lies beneath me
 It shall yet stand up the soldier of ultimate victory




Thoughts

 Of public opinion
 Of a calm and cool fiat sooner or later how impassive how certain
 and final
 Of the President with pale face asking secretly to himself What
 will the people say at last
 Of the frivolous Judgeof the corrupt Congressman Governor
 Mayorof such as these standing helpless and exposed
 Of the mumbling and screaming priest soon soon deserted
 Of the lessening year by year of venerableness and of the dicta of
 officers statutes pulpits schools
 Of the rising forever taller and stronger and broader of the
 intuitions of men and women and of Selfesteem and Personality
 Of the true New Worldof the Democracies resplendent enmasse
 Of the conformity of politics armies navies to them
 Of the shining sun by themof the inherent light greater than the rest
 Of the envelopment of all by them and the effusion of all from them




Mediums

 They shall arise in the States
 They shall report Nature laws physiology and happiness
 They shall illustrate Democracy and the kosmos
 They shall be alimentive amative perceptive
 They shall be complete women and men their pose brawny and supple
 their drink water their blood clean and clear
 They shall fully enjoy materialism and the sight of products they
 shall enjoy the sight of the beef lumber breadstuffs of
 Chicago the great city
 They shall train themselves to go in public to become orators and
 oratresses
 Strong and sweet shall their tongues be poems and materials of
 poems shall come from their lives they shall be makers and finders
 Of them and of their works shall emerge divine conveyers to convey gospels
 Characters events retrospections shall be conveyd in gospels
 trees animals waters shall be conveyd
 Death the future the invisible faith shall all be conveyd




Weave in My Hardy Life

 Weave in weave in my hardy life
 Weave yet a soldier strong and full for great campaigns to come
 Weave in red blood weave sinews in like ropes the senses sight weave in
 Weave lasting sure weave day and night the wet the warp incessant
 weave tire not
 We know not what the use O life nor know the aim the end nor
 really aught we know
 But know the work the need goes on and shall go on the
 deathenvelopd march of peace as well as war goes on
 For great campaigns of peace the same the wiry threads to weave
 We know not why or what yet weave forever weave




Spain 187374

 Out of the murk of heaviest clouds
 Out of the feudal wrecks and heapdup skeletons of kings
 Out of that old entire European debris the shatterd mummeries
 Ruind cathedrals crumble of palaces tombs of priests
 Lo Freedoms features fresh undimmd look forththe same immortal
 face looks forth
 A glimpse as of thy Mothers face Columbia
 A flash significant as of a sword
 Beaming towards thee

 Nor think we forget thee maternal
 Lagdst thou so long shall the clouds close again upon thee
 Ah but thou hast thyself now appeard to uswe know thee
 Thou hast given us a sure proof the glimpse of thyself
 Thou waitest there as everywhere thy time




By Broad Potomacs Shore

 By broad Potomacs shore again old tongue
 Still uttering still ejaculating canst never cease this babble
 Again old heart so gay again to you your sense the full flush
 spring returning
 Again the freshness and the odors again Virginias summer sky
 pellucid blue and silver
 Again the forenoon purple of the hills
 Again the deathless grass so noiseless soft and green
 Again the bloodred roses blooming

 Perfume this book of mine O bloodred roses
 Lave subtly with your waters every line Potomac
 Give me of you O spring before I close to put between its pages
 O forenoon purple of the hills before I close of you
 O deathless grass of you




From Far Dakotas Canyons June 25 1876

 From far Dakotas canyons
 Lands of the wild ravine the dusky Sioux the lonesome stretch the
 silence
 Haply today a mournful wall haply a trumpetnote for heroes

 The battlebulletin
 The Indian ambuscade the craft the fatal environment
 The cavalry companies fighting to the last in sternest heroism
 In the midst of their little circle with their slaughterd horses
 for breastworks
 The fall of Custer and all his officers and men

 Continues yet the old old legend of our race
 The loftiest of life upheld by death
 The ancient banner perfectly maintaind
 O lesson opportune O how I welcome thee

 As sitting in dark days
 Lone sulky through the times thick murk looking in vain for
 light for hope
 From unsuspected parts a fierce and momentary proof
 The sun there at the centre though conceald
 Electric life forever at the centre
 Breaks forth a lightning flash

 Thou of the tawny flowing hair in battle
 I erewhile saw with erect head pressing ever in front bearing a
 bright sword in thy hand
 Now ending well in death the splendid fever of thy deeds
 I bring no dirge for it or thee I bring a glad triumphal sonnet
 Desperate and glorious aye in defeat most desperate most glorious
 After thy many battles in which never yielding up a gun or a color
 Leaving behind thee a memory sweet to soldiers
 Thou yieldest up thyself




Old WarDreams

 In midnight sleep of many a face of anguish
 Of the look at first of the mortally wounded of that indescribable look
 Of the dead on their backs with arms extended wide
 I dream I dream I dream

 Of scenes of Nature fields and mountains
 Of skies so beauteous after a storm and at night the moon so
 unearthly bright
 Shining sweetly shining down where we dig the trenches and
 gather the heaps
 I dream I dream I dream

 Long have they passd faces and trenches and fields
 Where through the carnage I moved with a callous composure or away
 from the fallen
 Onward I sped at the timebut now of their forms at night
 I dream I dream I dream




ThickSprinkled Bunting

 Thicksprinkled bunting flag of stars
 Long yet your road fateful flaglong yet your road and lined with
 bloody death
 For the prize I see at issue at last is the world
 All its ships and shores I see interwoven with your threads greedy banner
 Dreamd again the flags of kings highest borne to flaunt unrivald
 O hasten flag of manO with sure and steady step passing highest
 flags of kings
 Walk supreme to the heavens mighty symbolrun up above them all
 Flag of stars thicksprinkled bunting




What Best I See in Thee
 To U S G returnd from his Worlds Tour

 What best I see in thee
 Is not that where thou movst down historys great highways
 Ever undimmd by time shoots warlike victorys dazzle
 Or that thou satst where Washington sat ruling the land in peace
 Or thou the man whom feudal Europe feted venerable Asia swarmd upon
 Who walkd with kings with even pace the round worlds promenade
 But that in foreign lands in all thy walks with kings
 Those prairie sovereigns of the West Kansas Missouri Illinois
 Ohios Indianas millions comrades farmers soldiers all to the front
 Invisibly with thee walking with kings with even pace the round
 worlds promenade
 Were all so justified




Spirit That Formd This Scene
 Written in Platte Canyon Colorado

 Spirit that formd this scene
 These tumbled rockpiles grim and red
 These reckless heavenambitious peaks
 These gorges turbulentclear streams this naked freshness
 These formless wild arrays for reasons of their own
 I know thee savage spiritwe have communed together
 Mine too such wild arrays for reasons of their own
 Wast charged against my chants they had forgotten art
 To fuse within themselves its rules precise and delicatesse
 The lyrists measurd beat the wroughtout temples gracecolumn
 and polishd arch forgot
 But thou that revelest herespirit that formd this scene
 They have rememberd thee




As I Walk These Broad Majestic Days

 As I walk these broad majestic days of peace
 For the war the struggle of blood finishd wherein O terrific Ideal
 Against vast odds erewhile having gloriously won
 Now thou stridest on yet perhaps in time toward denser wars
 Perhaps to engage in time in still more dreadful contests dangers
 Longer campaigns and crises labors beyond all others
 Around me I hear that eclat of the world politics produce
 The announcements of recognized things science
 The approved growth of cities and the spread of inventions

 I see the ships they will last a few years
 The vast factories with their foremen and workmen
 And hear the indorsement of all and do not object to it

 But I too announce solid things
 Science ships politics cities factories are not nothing
 Like a grand procession to music of distant bugles pouring
 triumphantly moving and grander heaving in sight
 They stand for realitiesall is as it should be

 Then my realities
 What else is so real as mine
 Libertad and the divine average freedom to every slave on the face
 of the earth
 The rapt promises and lumine of seers the spiritual world these
 centurieslasting songs
 And our visions the visions of poets the most solid announcements
 of any




A Clear Midnight

 This is thy hour O Soul thy free flight into the wordless
 Away from books away from art the day erased the lesson done
 Thee fully forth emerging silent gazing pondering the themes thou
 lovest best
 Night sleep death and the stars




BOOK XXXIII SONGS OF PARTING


As the Time Draws Nigh

 As the time draws nigh glooming a cloud
 A dread beyond of I know not what darkens me

 I shall go forth
 I shall traverse the States awhile but I cannot tell whither or how long
 Perhaps soon some day or night while I am singing my voice will
 suddenly cease

 O book O chants must all then amount to but this
 Must we barely arrive at this beginning of us and yet it is
 enough O soul
 O soul we have positively appeardthat is enough




Years of the Modern

 Years of the modern years of the unperformd
 Your horizon rises I see it parting away for more august dramas
 I see not America only not only Libertys nation but other nations
 preparing
 I see tremendous entrances and exits new combinations the solidarity
 of races
 I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the worlds stage
 Have the old forces the old wars played their parts are the acts
 suitable to them closed
 I see Freedom completely armd and victorious and very haughty
 with Law on one side and Peace on the other
 A stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste
 What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach
 I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions
 I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken
 I see the landmarks of European kings removed
 I see this day the People beginning their landmarks all others give way
 Never were such sharp questions askd as this day
 Never was average man his soul more energetic more like a God
 Lo how he urges and urges leaving the masses no rest
 His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere he colonizes the
 Pacific the archipelagoes
 With the steamship the electric telegraph the newspaper the
 wholesale engines of war
 With these and the worldspreading factories he interlinks all
 geography all lands
 What whispers are these O lands running ahead of you passing under
 the seas
 Are all nations communing is there going to be but one heart to the globe
 Is humanity forming enmasse for lo tyrants tremble crowns grow dim
 The earth restive confronts a new era perhaps a general divine war
 No one knows what will happen next such portents fill the days and nights
 Years prophetical the space ahead as I walk as I vainly try to
 pierce it is full of phantoms
 Unborn deeds things soon to be project their shapes around me
 This incredible rush and heat this strange ecstatic fever of dreams
 O years
 Your dreams O years how they penetrate through me I know not
 whether I sleep or wake
 The performd America and Europe grow dim retiring in shadow behind me
 The unperformd more gigantic than ever advance advance upon me




Ashes of Soldiers

 Ashes of soldiers South or North
 As I muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought
 The war resumes again to my sense your shapes
 And again the advance of the armies

 Noiseless as mists and vapors
 From their graves in the trenches ascending
 From cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee
 From every point of the compass out of the countless graves
 In wafted clouds in myriads large or squads of twos or threes or
 single ones they come
 And silently gather round me

 Now sound no note O trumpeters
 Not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses
 With sabres drawn and glistening and carbines by their thighs ah
 my brave horsemen
 My handsome tanfaced horsemen what life what joy and pride
 With all the perils were yours

 Nor you drummers neither at reveille at dawn
 Nor the long roll alarming the camp nor even the muffled beat for burial
 Nothing from you this time O drummers bearing my warlike drums

 But aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded promenade
 Admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and voiceless
 The slain elate and alive again the dust and debris alive
 I chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead soldiers

 Faces so pale with wondrous eyes very dear gather closer yet
 Draw close but speak not

 Phantoms of countless lost
 Invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions
 Follow me everdesert me not while I live

 Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the livingsweet are the musical
 voices sounding
 But sweet ah sweet are the dead with their silent eyes

 Dearest comrades all is over and long gone
 But love is not overand what love O comrades
 Perfume from battlefields rising up from the foetor arising

 Perfume therefore my chant O love immortal love
 Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers
 Shroud them embalm them cover them all over with tender pride

 Perfume allmake all wholesome
 Make these ashes to nourish and blossom
 O love solve all fructify all with the last chemistry

 Give me exhaustless make me a fountain
 That I exhale love from me wherever I go like a moist perennial dew
 For the ashes of all dead soldiers South or North




Thoughts

 1
 Of these years I sing
 How they pass and have passd through convulsd pains as through
 parturitions
 How America illustrates birth muscular youth the promise the sure
 fulfilment the absolute success despite of peopleillustrates
 evil as well as good
 The vehement struggle so fierce for unity in onesself
 How many hold despairingly yet to the models departed caste myths
 obedience compulsion and to infidelity
 How few see the arrived models the athletes the Western States or
 see freedom or spirituality or hold any faith in results
 But I see the athletes and I see the results of the war glorious
 and inevitable and they again leading to other results

 How the great cities appearhow the Democratic masses turbulent
 willful as I love them
 How the whirl the contest the wrestle of evil with good the
 sounding and resounding keep on and on
 How society waits unformd and is for a while between things ended
 and things begun
 How America is the continent of glories and of the triumph of
 freedom and of the Democracies and of the fruits of society and
 of all that is begun
 And how the States are complete in themselvesand how all triumphs
 and glories are complete in themselves to lead onward
 And how these of mine and of the States will in their turn be
 convulsd and serve other parturitions and transitions
 And how all people sights combinations the democratic masses too
 serveand how every fact and war itself with all its horrors
 serves
 And how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of death

 2
 Of seeds dropping into the ground of births
 Of the steady concentration of America inland upward to
 impregnable and swarming places
 Of what Indiana Kentucky Arkansas and the rest are to be
 Of what a few years will show there in Nebraska Colorado Nevada
 and the rest
 Or afar mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka or Aliaska
 Of what the feuillage of America is the preparation forand of what
 all sights North South East and West are
 Of this Union welded in blood of the solemn price paid of the
 unnamed lost ever present in my mind
 Of the temporary use of materials for identitys sake
 Of the present passing departingof the growth of completer men
 than any yet
 Of all sloping down there where the fresh free giver the mother the
 Mississippi flows
 Of mighty inland cities yet unsurveyd and unsuspected
 Of the new and good names of the modern developments of
 inalienable homesteads
 Of a free and original life there of simple diet and clean and
 sweet blood
 Of litheness majestic faces clear eyes and perfect physique there
 Of immense spiritual results future years far West each side of the
 Anahuacs
 Of these songs well understood there being made for that area
 Of the native scorn of grossness and gain there
 O it lurks in me night and daywhat is gain after all to savageness
 and freedom




Song at Sunset

 Splendor of ended day floating and filling me
 Hour prophetic hour resuming the past
 Inflating my throat you divine average
 You earth and life till the last ray gleams I sing

 Open mouth of my soul uttering gladness
 Eyes of my soul seeing perfection
 Natural life of me faithfully praising things
 Corroborating forever the triumph of things

 Illustrious every one
 Illustrious what we name space sphere of unnumberd spirits
 Illustrious the mystery of motion in all beings even the tiniest insect
 Illustrious the attribute of speech the senses the body
 Illustrious the passing lightillustrious the pale reflection on
 the new moon in the western sky
 Illustrious whatever I see or hear or touch to the last

 Good in all
 In the satisfaction and aplomb of animals
 In the annual return of the seasons
 In the hilarity of youth
 In the strength and flush of manhood
 In the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age
 In the superb vistas of death

 Wonderful to depart
 Wonderful to be here
 The heart to jet the allalike and innocent blood
 To breathe the air how delicious
 To speakto walkto seize something by the hand
 To prepare for sleep for bed to look on my rosecolord flesh
 To be conscious of my body so satisfied so large
 To be this incredible God I am
 To have gone forth among other Gods these men and women I love

 Wonderful how I celebrate you and myself
 How my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around
 How the clouds pass silently overhead
 How the earth darts on and on and how the sun moon stars dart on and on
 How the water sports and sings surely it is alive
 How the trees rise and stand up with strong trunks with branches
 and leaves
 Surely there is something more in each of the trees some living soul

 O amazement of thingseven the least particle
 O spirituality of things
 O strain musical flowing through ages and continents now reaching
 me and America
 I take your strong chords intersperse them and cheerfully pass
 them forward

 I too carol the sun usherd or at noon or as now setting
 I too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth and of all the
 growths of the earth
 I too have felt the resistless call of myself

 As I steamd down the Mississippi
 As I wanderd over the prairies
 As I have lived as I have lookd through my windows my eyes
 As I went forth in the morning as I beheld the light breaking in the east
 As I bathed on the beach of the Eastern Sea and again on the beach
 of the Western Sea
 As I roamd the streets of inland Chicago whatever streets I have roamd
 Or cities or silent woods or even amid the sights of war
 Wherever I have been I have charged myself with contentment and triumph

 I sing to the last the equalities modern or old
 I sing the endless finales of things
 I say Nature continues glory continues
 I praise with electric voice
 For I do not see one imperfection in the universe
 And I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the universe

 O setting sun though the time has come
 I still warble under you if none else does unmitigated adoration




As at Thy Portals Also Death

 As at thy portals also death
 Entering thy sovereign dim illimitable grounds
 To memories of my mother to the divine blending maternity
 To her buried and gone yet buried not gone not from me
 I see again the calm benignant face fresh and beautiful still
 I sit by the form in the coffin
 I kiss and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips the cheeks
 the closed eyes in the coffin
 To her the ideal woman practical spiritual of all of earth
 life love to me the best
 I grave a monumental line before I go amid these songs
 And set a tombstone here




My Legacy

 The business man the acquirer vast
 After assiduous years surveying results preparing for departure
 Devises houses and lands to his children bequeaths stocks goods
 funds for a school or hospital
 Leaves money to certain companions to buy tokens souvenirs of gems
 and gold

 But I my life surveying closing
 With nothing to show to devise from its idle years
 Nor houses nor lands nor tokens of gems or gold for my friends
 Yet certain remembrances of the war for you and after you
 And little souvenirs of camps and soldiers with my love
 I bind together and bequeath in this bundle of songs




Pensive on Her Dead Gazing

 Pensive on her dead gazing I heard the Mother of All
 Desperate on the torn bodies on the forms covering the battlefields gazing
 As the last gun ceased but the scent of the powdersmoke lingerd
 As she calld to her earth with mournful voice while she stalkd
 Absorb them well O my earth she cried I charge you lose not my
 sons lose not an atom
 And you streams absorb them well taking their dear blood
 And you local spots and you airs that swim above lightly impalpable
 And all you essences of soil and growth and you my rivers depths
 And you mountain sides and the woods where my dear childrens
 blood trickling reddend
 And you trees down in your roots to bequeath to all future trees
 My dead absorb or South or Northmy young mens bodies absorb
 and their precious precious blood
 Which holding in trust for me faithfully back again give me many a
 year hence
 In unseen essence and odor of surface and grass centuries hence
 In blowing airs from the fields back again give me my darlings give
 my immortal heroes
 Exhale me them centuries hence breathe me their breath let not an
 atom be lost
 O years and graves O air and soil O my dead an aroma sweet
 Exhale them perennial sweet death years centuries hence




Camps of Green

 Nor alone those camps of white old comrades of the wars
 When as orderd forward after a long march
 Footsore and weary soon as the light lessens we halt for the night
 Some of us so fatigued carrying the gun and knapsack dropping
 asleep in our tracks
 Others pitching the little tents and the fires lit up begin to sparkle
 Outposts of pickets posted surrounding alert through the dark
 And a word provided for countersign careful for safety
 Till to the call of the drummers at daybreak loudly beating the drums
 We rise up refreshd the night and sleep passd over and resume our
 journey
 Or proceed to battle

 Lo the camps of the tents of green
 Which the days of peace keep filling and the days of war keep filling
 With a mystic army is it too orderd forward is it too only
 halting awhile
 Till night and sleep pass over

 Now in those camps of green in their tents dotting the world
 In the parents children husbands wives in them in the old and young
 Sleeping under the sunlight sleeping under the moonlight content
 and silent there at last
 Behold the mighty bivouacfield and waitingcamp of all
 Of the corps and generals all and the President over the corps and
 generals all
 And of each of us O soldiers and of each and all in the ranks we fought
 There without hatred we all all meet

 For presently O soldiers we too camp in our place in the
 bivouaccamps of green
 But we need not provide for outposts nor word for the countersign
 Nor drummer to beat the morning drum




The Sobbing of the Bells Midnight Sept 1920 1881

 The sobbing of the bells the sudden deathnews everywhere
 The slumberers rouse the rapport of the People
 Full well they know that message in the darkness
 Full well return respond within their breasts their brains the
 sad reverberations
 The passionate toll and clangcity to city joining sounding passing
 Those heartbeats of a Nation in the night




As They Draw to a Close

 As they draw to a close
 Of what underlies the precedent songsof my aims in them
 Of the seed I have sought to plant in them
 Of joy sweet joy through many a year in them
 For them for them have I lived in them my work is done
 Of many an aspiration fond of many a dream and plan
 Through Space and Time fused in a chant and the flowing eternal identity
 To Nature encompassing these encompassing Godto the joyous
 electric all
 To the sense of Death and accepting exulting in Death in its turn
 the same as life
 The entrance of man to sing
 To compact you ye parted diverse lives
 To put rapport the mountains and rocks and streams
 And the winds of the north and the forests of oak and pine
 With you O soul




Joy Shipmate Joy

 Joy shipmate Joy
 Pleasd to my soul at death I cry
 Our life is closed our life begins
 The long long anchorage we leave
 The ship is clear at last she leaps
 She swiftly courses from the shore
 Joy shipmate joy




The Untold Want

 The untold want by life and land neer granted
 Now voyager sail thou forth to seek and find




Portals

 What are those of the known but to ascend and enter the Unknown
 And what are those of life but for Death




These Carols

 These carols sung to cheer my passage through the world I see
 For completion I dedicate to the Invisible World




Now Finale to the Shore

 Now finale to the shore
 Now land and life finale and farewell
 Now Voyager depart much much for thee is yet in store
 Often enough hast thou adventurd oer the seas
 Cautiously cruising studying the charts
 Duly again to port and hawsers tie returning
 But now obey thy cherishd secret wish
 Embrace thy friends leave all in order
 To port and hawsers tie no more returning
 Depart upon thy endless cruise old Sailor




So Long

 To conclude I announce what comes after me

 I remember I said before my leaves sprang at all
 I would raise my voice jocund and strong with reference to consummations

 When America does what was promisd
 When through these States walk a hundred millions of superb persons
 When the rest part away for superb persons and contribute to them
 When breeds of the most perfect mothers denote America
 Then to me and mine our due fruition

 I have pressd through in my own right
 I have sung the body and the soul war and peace have I sung and
 the songs of life and death
 And the songs of birth and shown that there are many births

 I have offerd my style to every one I have journeyd with confident step
 While my pleasure is yet at the full I whisper So long
 And take the young womans hand and the young mans hand for the last time

 I announce natural persons to arise
 I announce justice triumphant
 I announce uncompromising liberty and equality
 I announce the justification of candor and the justification of pride

 I announce that the identity of these States is a single identity only
 I announce the Union more and more compact indissoluble
 I announce splendors and majesties to make all the previous politics
 of the earth insignificant

 I announce adhesiveness I say it shall be limitless unloosend
 I say you shall yet find the friend you were looking for

 I announce a man or woman coming perhaps you are the one So long
 I announce the great individual fluid as Nature chaste
 affectionate compassionate fully armd

 I announce a life that shall be copious vehement spiritual bold
 I announce an end that shall lightly and joyfully meet its translation

 I announce myriads of youths beautiful gigantic sweetblooded
 I announce a race of splendid and savage old men

 O thicker and fasterSo long
 O crowding too close upon me
 I foresee too much it means more than I thought
 It appears to me I am dying

 Hasten throat and sound your last
 Salute mesalute the days once more Peal the old cry once more

 Screaming electric the atmosphere using
 At random glancing each as I notice absorbing
 Swiftly on but a little while alighting
 Curious envelopd messages delivering
 Sparkles hot seed ethereal down in the dirt dropping
 Myself unknowing my commission obeying to question it never daring
 To ages and ages yet the growth of the seed leaving
 To troops out of the war arising they the tasks I have set
 promulging
 To women certain whispers of myself bequeathing their affection
 me more clearly explaining
 To young men my problems offeringno dallier II the muscle of
 their brains trying
 So I pass a little time vocal visible contrary
 Afterward a melodious echo passionately bent for death making
 me really undying
 The best of me then when no longer visible for toward that I have
 been incessantly preparing

 What is there more that I lag and pause and crouch extended with
 unshut mouth
 Is there a single final farewell
 My songs cease I abandon them
 From behind the screen where I hid I advance personally solely to you

 Camerado this is no book
 Who touches this touches a man
 Is it night are we here together alone
 It is I you hold and who holds you
 I spring from the pages into your armsdecease calls me forth

 O how your fingers drowse me
 Your breath falls around me like dew your pulse lulls the tympans
 of my ears
 I feel immerged from head to foot
 Delicious enough

 Enough O deed impromptu and secret
 Enough O gliding presentenough O summdup past

 Dear friend whoever you are take this kiss
 I give it especially to you do not forget me
 I feel like one who has done work for the day to retire awhile
 I receive now again of my many translations from my avataras
 ascending while others doubtless await me
 An unknown sphere more real than I dreamd more direct darts
 awakening rays about me So long
 Remember my words I may again return
 I love you I depart from materials
 I am as one disembodied triumphant dead

Out of Mays Shows Selected

 Apple orchards the trees all coverd with blossoms
 Wheat fields carpeted far and near in vital emerald green
 The eternal exhaustless freshness of each early morning
 The yellow golden transparent haze of the warm afternoon sun
 The aspiring lilac bushes with profuse purple or white flowers




Halcyon Days

 Not from successful love alone
 Nor wealth nor honord middle age nor victories of politics or war
 But as life wanes and all the turbulent passions calm
 As gorgeous vapory silent hues cover the evening sky
 As softness fulness rest suffuse the frame like freshier balmier air
 As the days take on a mellower light and the apple at last hangs
 really finishd and indolentripe on the tree
 Then for the teeming quietest happiest days of all
 The brooding and blissful halcyon days



FANCIES AT NAVESINK

 I The Pilot in the Mist

 Steaming the northern rapidsan old St Lawrence reminiscence
 A sudden memoryflash comes back I know not why
 Here waiting for the sunrise gazing from this hill
 Again tis just at morninga heavy haze contends with daybreak
 Again the trembling laboring vessel veers meI press through
 foamdashd rocks that almost touch me
 Again I mark where aft the small thin Indian helmsman
 Looms in the mist with brow elate and governing hand



 II Had I the Choice

 Had I the choice to tally greatest bards
 To limn their portraits stately beautiful and emulate at will
 Homer with all his wars and warriorsHector Achilles Ajax
 Or Shaksperes woeentangled Hamlet Lear OthelloTennysons fair ladies
 Metre or wit the best or choice conceit to wield in perfect rhyme
 delight of singers
 These these O sea all these Id gladly barter
 Would you the undulation of one wave its trick to me transfer
 Or breathe one breath of yours upon my verse
 And leave its odor there



 III You Tides with Ceaseless Swell

 You tides with ceaseless swell you power that does this work
 You unseen force centripetal centrifugal through spaces spread
 Rapport of sun moon earth and all the constellations
 What are the messages by you from distant stars to us what Sirius
 what Capellas
 What central heartand you the pulsevivifies all what boundless
 aggregate of all
 What subtle indirection and significance in you what clue to all in
 you what fluid vast identity
 Holding the universe with all its parts as oneas sailing in a ship



 IV Last of Ebb and Daylight Waning

 Last of ebb and daylight waning
 Scented seacool landward making smells of sedge and salt incoming
 With many a halfcaught voice sent up from the eddies
 Many a muffled confessionmany a sob and whisperd word
 As of speakers far or hid

 How they sweep down and out how they mutter
 Poets unnamedartists greatest of any with cherishd lost designs
 Loves unresponsea chorus of ages complaintshopes last words
 Some suicides despairing cry Away to the boundless waste and
 never again return

 On to oblivion then
 On on and do your part ye burying ebbing tide
 On for your time ye furious debouche



 V And Yet Not You Alone

 And yet not you alone twilight and burying ebb
 Nor you ye lost designs alonenor failures aspirations
 I know divine deceitful ones your glamours seeming
 Duly by you from you the tide and light againduly the hinges turning
 Duly the needed discordparts offsetting blending
 Weaving from you from Sleep Night Death itself
 The rhythmus of Birth eternal



 VI Proudly the Flood Comes In

 Proudly the flood comes in shouting foaming advancing
 Long it holds at the high with bosom broad outswelling
 All throbs dilatesthe farms woods streets of citiesworkmen at work
 Mainsails topsails jibs appear in the offingsteamers pennants
 of smokeand under the forenoon sun
 Freighted with human lives gaily the outward bound gaily the
 inward bound
 Flaunting from many a spar the flag I love



 VII By That Long Scan of Waves

 By that long scan of waves myself calld back resumed upon myself
 In every crest some undulating light or shadesome retrospect
 Joys travels studies silent panoramasscenes ephemeral
 The long past war the battles hospital sights the wounded and the dead
 Myself through every bygone phasemy idle youthold age at hand
 My threescore years of life summd up and more and past
 By any grand ideal tried intentionless the whole a nothing
 And haply yet some drop within Gods schemes ensemblesome
 wave or part of wave
 Like one of yours ye multitudinous ocean



 VIII Then Last Of All

 Then last of all caught from these shores this hill
 Of you O tides the mystic human meaning
 Only by law of you your swell and ebb enclosing me the same
 The brain that shapes the voice that chants this song




Election Day November 1884

 If I should need to name O Western World your powerfulest scene and show
 Twould not be you Niagaranor you ye limitless prairiesnor
 your huge rifts of canyons Colorado
 Nor you Yosemitenor Yellowstone with all its spasmic
 geyserloops ascending to the skies appearing and disappearing
 Nor Oregons white conesnor Hurons belt of mighty lakesnor
 Mississippis stream
 This seething hemispheres humanity as now Id namethe still
 small voice vibratingAmericas choosing day
 The heart of it not in the chosenthe act itself the main the
 quadriennial choosing
 The stretch of North and South arousdseaboard and inland
 Texas to Mainethe Prairie StatesVermont Virginia California
 The final ballotshower from East to Westthe paradox and conflict
 The countless snowflakes fallinga swordless conflict
 Yet more than all Romes wars of old or modern Napoleons the
 peaceful choice of all
 Or good or ill humanitywelcoming the darker odds the dross
 Foams and ferments the wine it serves to purifywhile the heart

 These stormy gusts and winds waft precious ships
 Swelld Washingtons Jeffersons Lincolns sails




With HuskyHaughty Lips O Sea

 With huskyhaughty lips O sea
 Where day and night I wend thy surfbeat shore
 Imaging to my sense thy varied strange suggestions
 I see and plainly list thy talk and conference here
 Thy troops of whitemaned racers racing to the goal
 Thy ample smiling face dashd with the sparkling dimples of the sun
 Thy brooding scowl and murkthy unloosd hurricanes
 Thy unsubduedness caprices wilfulness
 Great as thou art above the rest thy many tearsa lack from all
 eternity in thy content
 Naught but the greatest struggles wrongs defeats could make thee
 greatestno less could make thee
 Thy lonely statesomething thou ever seekst and seekst yet
 never gainst
 Surely some right withheldsome voice in huge monotonous rage of
 freedomlover pent
 Some vast heart like a planets chaind and chafing in those breakers
 By lengthend swell and spasm and panting breath
 And rhythmic rasping of thy sands and waves
 And serpent hiss and savage peals of laughter
 And undertones of distant lion roar
 Sounding appealing to the skys deaf earbut now rapport for once
 A phantom in the night thy confidant for once
 The first and last confession of the globe
 Outsurging muttering from thy souls abysms
 The tale of cosmic elemental passion
 Thou tellest to a kindred soul




Death of General Grant

 As one by one withdraw the lofty actors
 From that great play on historys stage eterne
 That lurid partial act of war and peaceof old and new contending
 Fought out through wrath fears dark dismays and many a long suspense
 All pastand since in countless graves receding mellowing
 Victors and vanquishdLincolns and Leesnow thou with them
 Man of the mighty daysand equal to the days
 Thou from the prairiestangled and manyveind and hard has been thy part
 To admiration has it been enacted




Red Jacket From Aloft

 Upon this scene this show
 Yielded today by fashion learning wealth
 Nor in caprice alonesome grains of deepest meaning
 Haply aloft who knows from distant skyclouds blended shapes
 As some old tree or rock or cliff thrilld with its soul
 Product of Natures sun stars earth directa towering human form
 In huntingshirt of film armd with the rifle a halfironical
 smile curving its phantom lips
 Like one of Ossians ghosts looks down




Washingtons Monument February 1885

 Ah not this marble dead and cold
 Far from its base and shaft expandingthe round zones circling
 comprehending
 Thou Washington art all the worlds the continents entirenot
 yours alone America
 Europes as well in every part castle of lord or laborers cot
 Or frozen North or sultry Souththe Africansthe Arabs in his tent
 Old Asias there with venerable smile seated amid her ruins
 Greets the antique the hero new tis but the samethe heir
 legitimate continued ever
 The indomitable heart and armproofs of the neverbroken line
 Courage alertness patience faith the sameeen in defeat
 defeated not the same
 Wherever sails a ship or house is built on land or day or night
 Through teeming cities streets indoors or out factories or farms
 Now or to come or pastwhere patriot wills existed or exist
 Wherever Freedom poisd by Toleration swayd by Law
 Stands or is rising thy true monument




Of That Blithe Throat of Thine

 Of that blithe throat of thine from arctic bleak and blank
 Ill mind the lesson solitary birdlet me too welcome chilling drifts
 Een the profoundest chill as nowa torpid pulse a brain unnervd
 Old age landlockd within its winter baycold cold O cold
 These snowy hairs my feeble arm my frozen feet
 For them thy faith thy rule I take and grave it to the last
 Not summers zones alonenot chants of youth or souths warm tides alone
 But held by sluggish floes packd in the northern ice the cumulus
 of years
 These with gay heart I also sing




Broadway

 What hurrying human tides or day or night
 What passions winnings losses ardors swim thy waters
 What whirls of evil bliss and sorrow stem thee
 What curious questioning glancesglints of love
 Leer envy scorn contempt hope aspiration
 Thou portalthou arenathou of the myriad longdrawn lines and groups
 Could but thy flagstones curbs facades tell their inimitable tales
 Thy windows rich and huge hotelsthy sidewalks wide
 Thou of the endless sliding mincing shuffling feet
 Thou like the particolored world itselflike infinite teeming
 mocking life
 Thou visord vast unspeakable show and lesson




To Get the Final Lilt of Songs

 To get the final lilt of songs
 To penetrate the inmost lore of poetsto know the mighty ones
 Job Homer Eschylus Dante Shakespere Tennyson Emerson
 To diagnose the shiftingdelicate tints of love and pride and doubt
 to truly understand
 To encompass these the last keen faculty and entranceprice
 Old age and what it brings from all its past experiences




Old Salt Kossabone

 Far back related on my mothers side
 Old Salt Kossabone Ill tell you how he died
 Had been a sailor all his lifewas nearly 90lived with his
 married grandchild Jenny
 House on a hill with view of bay at hand and distant cape and
 stretch to open sea
 The last of afternoons the evening hours for many a year his
 regular custom
 In his great arm chair by the window seated
 Sometimes indeed through half the day
 Watching the coming going of the vessels he mutters to himself
 And now the close of all
 One struggling outbound brig one day baffled for longcrosstides
 and much wrong going
 At last at nightfall strikes the breeze aright her whole luck veering
 And swiftly bending round the cape the darkness proudly entering
 cleaving as he watches
 Shes freeshes on her destinationthese the last wordswhen
 Jenny came he sat there dead
 Dutch Kossabone Old Salt related on my mothers side far back




The Dead Tenor

 As down the stage again
 With Spanish hat and plumes and gait inimitable
 Back from the fading lessons of the past Id call Id tell and own
 How much from thee the revelation of the singing voice from thee
 So firmso liquidsoftagain that tremulous manly timbre
 The perfect singing voicedeepest of all to me the lessontrial
 and test of all
 How through those strains distilldhow the rapt ears the soul of
 me absorbing
 Fernandos heart Manricos passionate call Ernanis sweet Gennaros
 I fold thenceforth or seek to fold within my chants transmuting
 Freedoms and Loves and Faiths unloosd cantabile
 As perfumes colors sunlights correlation
 From these for these with these a hurried line dead tenor
 A wafted autumn leaf dropt in the closing grave the shoveld earth
 To memory of thee




Continuities

 Nothing is ever really lost or can be lost
 No birth identity formno object of the world
 Nor life nor force nor any visible thing
 Appearance must not foil nor shifted sphere confuse thy brain
 Ample are time and spaceample the fields of Nature
 The body sluggish aged coldthe embers left from earlier fires
 The light in the eye grown dim shall duly flame again
 The sun now low in the west rises for mornings and for noons continual
 To frozen clods ever the springs invisible law returns
 With grass and flowers and summer fruits and corn




Yonnondio

 A song a poem of itselfthe word itself a dirge
 Amid the wilds the rocks the storm and wintry night
 To me such misty strange tableaux the syllables calling up
 YonnondioI see far in the west or north a limitless ravine with
 plains and mountains dark
 I see swarms of stalwart chieftains medicinemen and warriors
 As flitting by like clouds of ghosts they pass and are gone in the
 twilight
 Race of the woods the landscapes free and the falls
 No picture poem statement passing them to the future
 Yonnondio Yonnondiounlimnd they disappear
 Today gives place and fadesthe cities farms factories fade
 A muffled sonorous sound a wailing word is borne through the air
 for a moment
 Then blank and gone and still and utterly lost




Life

 Ever the undiscouraged resolute struggling soul of man
 Have former armies faild then we send fresh armiesand fresh again
 Ever the grappled mystery of all earths ages old or new
 Ever the eager eyes hurrahs the welcomeclapping hands the loud
 applause
 Ever the soul dissatisfied curious unconvinced at last
 Struggling today the samebattling the same




Going Somewhere

 My sciencefriend my noblest womanfriend
 Now buried in an English graveand this a memoryleaf for her dear sake
 Ended our talkThe sum concluding all we know of old or modern
 learning intuitions deep
 Of all GeologiesHistoriesof all Astronomyof Evolution
 Metaphysics all
 Is that we all are onward onward speeding slowly surely bettering
 Life life an endless march an endless army no halt but it is
 duly over
 The world the race the soulin space and time the universes
 All bound as is befitting eachall surely going somewhere




Small the Theme of My Chant

 Small the theme of my Chant yet the greatestnamely OnesSelf
 a simple separate person That for the use of the New World I sing
 Mans physiology complete from top to toe I sing Not physiognomy alone
 nor brain alone is worthy for the MuseI say the Form complete
 is worthier far The Female equally with the Male I sing
 Nor cease at the theme of OnesSelf I speak the word of the
 modern the word EnMasse
 My Days I sing and the Landswith interstice I knew of hapless War
 O friend whoeer you are at last arriving hither to commence I
 feel through every leaf the pressure of your hand which I return
 And thus upon our journey footing the road and more than once and
 linkd together let us go




True Conquerors

 Old farmers travelers workmen no matter how crippled or bent
 Old sailors out of many a perilous voyage storm and wreck
 Old soldiers from campaigns with all their wounds defeats and scars
 Enough that theyve survived at alllong lifes unflinching ones
 Forth from their struggles trials fights to have emerged at all
 in that alone
 True conquerors oer all the rest




The United States to Old World Critics

 Here first the duties of today the lessons of the concrete
 Wealth order travel shelter products plenty
 As of the building of some varied vast perpetual edifice
 Whence to arise inevitable in time the towering roofs the lamps
 The solidplanted spires tall shooting to the stars




The Calming Thought of All

 That coursing on whateer mens speculations
 Amid the changing schools theologies philosophies
 Amid the bawling presentations new and old
 The round earths silent vital laws facts modes continue

Life and Death

 The two old simple problems ever intertwined
 Close home elusive present baffled grappled
 By each successive age insoluble passd on
 To ours todayand we pass on the same




The Voice of the Rain

 And who art thou said I to the softfalling shower
 Which strange to tell gave me an answer as here translated
 I am the Poem of Earth said the voice of the rain
 Eternal I rise impalpable out of the land and the bottomless sea
 Upward to heaven whence vaguely formd altogether changed and
 yet the same
 I descend to lave the drouths atomies dustlayers of the globe
 And all that in them without me were seeds only latent unborn
 And forever by day and night I give back life to my own origin
 and make pure and beautify it
 For song issuing from its birthplace after fulfilment wandering
 Reckd or unreckd duly with love returns




Soon Shall the Winters Foil Be Here

 Soon shall the winters foil be here
 Soon shall these icy ligatures unbind and meltA little while
 And air soil wave suffused shall be in softness bloom and
 growtha thousand forms shall rise
 From these dead clods and chills as from low burial graves

 Thine eyes earsall thy best attributesall that takes cognizance
 of natural beauty
 Shall wake and fill Thou shalt perceive the simple shows the
 delicate miracles of earth
 Dandelions clover the emerald grass the early scents and flowers
 The arbutus under foot the willows yellowgreen the blossoming
 plum and cherry
 With these the robin lark and thrush singing their songsthe
 flitting bluebird
 For such the scenes the annual play brings on




While Not the Past Forgetting

 While not the past forgetting
 Today at least contention sunk entirepeace brotherhood uprisen
 For sign reciprocal our Northern Southern hands
 Lay on the graves of all dead soldiers North or South
 Nor for the past alonefor meanings to the future
 Wreaths of roses and branches of palm




The Dying Veteran

 Amid these days of order ease prosperity
 Amid the current songs of beauty peace decorum
 I cast a reminiscencelikely twill offend you
 I heard it in my boyhoodMore than a generation since
 A queer old savage man a fighter under Washington himself
 Large brave cleanly hotblooded no talker rather spiritualistic
 Had fought in the ranksfought wellhad been all through the
 Revolutionary war
 Lay dyingsons daughters churchdeacons lovingly tending him
 Sharping their sense their ears towards his murmuring halfcaught words
 Let me return again to my wardays
 To the sights and scenesto forming the line of battle
 To the scouts ahead reconnoitering
 To the cannons the grim artillery
 To the galloping aides carrying orders
 To the wounded the fallen the heat the suspense
 The perfume strong the smoke the deafening noise
 Away with your life of peaceyour joys of peace
 Give me my old wild battlelife again




Stronger Lessons

 Have you learnd lessons only of those who admired you and were
 tender with you and stood aside for you
 Have you not learnd great lessons from those who reject you and
 brace themselves against you or who treat you with contempt
 or dispute the passage with you




A Prairie Sunset

 Shot gold maroon and violet dazzling silver emerald fawn
 The earths whole amplitude and Natures multiform power consignd
 for once to colors
 The light the general air possessd by themcolors till now unknown
 No limit confinenot the Western sky alonethe high meridian
 North South all
 Pure luminous color fighting the silent shadows to the last




Twenty Years

 Down on the ancient wharf the sand I sit with a newcomer chatting
 He shippd as greenhand boy and saild away took some sudden
 vehement notion
 Since twenty years and more have circled round and round
 While he the globe was circling round and round and now returns
 How changed the placeall the old landmarks gonethe parents dead
 Yes he comes back to lay in port for goodto settlehas a
 wellfilld purseno spot will do but this
 The little boat that sculld him from the sloop now held in leash I see
 I hear the slapping waves the restless keel the rocking in the sand
 I see the sailor kit the canvas bag the great box bound with brass
 I scan the face all berrybrown and beardedthe stoutstrong frame
 Dressd in its russet suit of good Scotch cloth
 Then what the toldout story of those twenty years What of the future




Orange Buds by Mail from Florida

 A lesser proof than old Voltaires yet greater
 Proof of this present time and thee thy broad expanse America
 To my plain Northern hut in outside clouds and snow
 Brought safely for a thousand miles oer land and tide
 Some three days since on their own soil livesprouting
 Now here their sweetness through my room unfolding
 A bunch of orange buds by mall from Florida




Twilight

 The soft voluptuous opiate shades
 The sun just gone the eager light dispelldI too will soon be
 gone dispelld
 A hazenirwanarest and nightoblivion




You Lingering Sparse Leaves of Me

 You lingering sparse leaves of me on winternearing boughs
 And I some wellshorn tree of field or orchardrow
 You tokens diminute and lornnot now the flush of May or July
 cloverbloomno grain of August now
 You pallid bannerstavesyou pennants valuelessyou overstayd of time
 Yet my souldearest leaves confirming all the rest
 The faithfulesthardiestlast




Not Meagre Latent Boughs Alone

 Not meagre latent boughs alone O songs scaly and bare like
 eagles talons
 But haply for some sunny day who knows some future spring some
 summerbursting forth
 To verdant leaves or sheltering shadeto nourishing fruit
 Apples and grapesthe stalwart limbs of trees emergingthe fresh
 free open air
 And love and faith like scented roses blooming




The Dead Emperor

 Today with bending head and eyes thou too Columbia
 Less for the mighty crown laid low in sorrowless for the Emperor
 Thy true condolence breathest sendest out oer many a salt sea mile
 Mourning a good old mana faithful shepherd patriot




As the Greeks Signal Flame

 As the Greeks signal flame by antique records told
 Rose from the hilltop like applause and glory
 Welcoming in fame some special veteran hero
 With rosy tinge reddening the land hed served
 So I aloft from Mannahattas shipfringed shore
 Lift high a kindled brand for thee Old Poet




The Dismantled Ship

 In some unused lagoon some nameless bay
 On sluggish lonesome waters anchord near the shore
 An old dismasted gray and batterd ship disabled done
 After free voyages to all the seas of earth hauld up at last and
 hawserd tight
 Lies rusting mouldering




Now Precedent Songs Farewell

 Now precedent songs farewellby every name farewell
 Trains of a staggering line in many a strange procession waggons
 From ups and downswith intervalsfrom elder years midage or youth
 In Cabind Ships or Thee Old Cause or Poets to Come
 Or Paumanok Song of Myself Calamus or Adam
 Or Beat Beat Drums or To the Leavend Soil they Trod
 Or Captain My Captain Kosmos Quicksand Years or Thoughts
 Thou Mother with thy Equal Brood and many many more unspecified
 From fibre heart of minefrom throat and tongueMy lifes hot
 pulsing blood
 The personal urge and form for menot merely paper automatic type
 and ink
 Each song of mineeach utterance in the pasthaving its long long
 history
 Of life or death or soldiers wound of countrys loss or safety
 O heaven what flash and started endless train of all compared
 indeed to that
 What wretched shred een at the best of all




An Evening Lull

 After a week of physical anguish
 Unrest and pain and feverish heat
 Toward the ending day a calm and lull comes on
 Three hours of peace and soothing rest of brain




Old Ages Lambent Peaks

 The touch of flamethe illuminating firethe loftiest look at last
 Oer city passion seaoer prairie mountain woodthe earth itself
 The airy different changing hues of all in failing twilight
 Objects and groups bearings faces reminiscences
 The calmer sightthe golden setting clear and broad
 So much i the atmosphere the points of view the situations whence
 we scan
 Brot out by them aloneso much perhaps the best unreckd before
 The lights indeed from themold ages lambent peaks




After the Supper and Talk

 After the supper and talkafter the day is done
 As a friend from friends his final withdrawal prolonging
 Goodbye and Goodbye with emotional lips repeating
 So hard for his hand to release those handsno more will they meet
 No more for communion of sorrow and joy of old and young
 A farstretching journey awaits him to return no more
 Shunning postponing severanceseeking to ward off the last word
 ever so little
 Een at the exitdoor turningcharges superfluous calling back
 een as he descends the steps
 Something to eke out a minute additionalshadows of nightfall deepening
 Farewells messages lesseningdimmer the forthgoers visage and form
 Soon to be lost for aye in the darknessloth O so loth to depart
 Garrulous to the very last




BOOKXXXV GOODBYE MY FANCY


Sail out for Good Eidolon Yacht

 Heave the anchor short
 Raise mainsail and jibsteer forth
 O little whitehulld sloop now speed on really deep waters
 I will not call it our concluding voyage
 But outset and sure entrance to the truest best maturest
 Depart depart from solid earthno more returning to these shores
 Now on for aye our infinite free venture wending
 Spurning all yet tried ports seas hawsers densities gravitation
 Sail out for good eidolon yacht of me




Lingering Last Drops

 And whence and why come you

 We know not whence was the answer
 We only know that we drift here with the rest
 That we lingerd and laggdbut were wafted at last and are now here
 To make the passing showers concluding drops




GoodBye My Fancy

 Goodbye my fancyI had a word to say
 But tis not quite the timeThe best of any mans word or say
 Is when its proper place arrivesand for its meaning
 I keep mine till the last




On on the Same Ye Jocund Twain

 On on the same ye jocund twain
 My life and recitative containing birth youth midage years
 Fitful as motleytongues of flame inseparably twined and merged in
 onecombining all
 My single soulaims confirmations failures joysNor single soul alone
 I chant my nations crucial stage Americas haply humanitys
 the trial great the victory great
 A strange eclaircissement of all the masses past the eastern world
 the ancient medieval
 Here here from wanderings strayings lessons wars defeatshere
 at the west a voice triumphantjustifying all
 A gladsome pealing crya song for once of utmost pride and satisfaction
 I chant from it the common bulk the general average horde the
 best sooner than the worstAnd now I chant old age
 My verses written first for forenoon life and for the summers
 autumns spread
 I pass to snowwhite hairs the same and give to pulses
 wintercoold the same
 As here in careless trill I and my recitatives with faith and love
 wafting to other work to unknown songs conditions
 On on ye jocund twain continue on the same




MY 71st Year

 After surmounting threescore and ten
 With all their chances changes losses sorrows
 My parents deaths the vagaries of my life the many tearing
 passions of me the war of 63 and 4
 As some old broken soldier after a long hot wearying march or
 haply after battle
 Today at twilight hobbling answering company rollcall Here
 with vital voice
 Reporting yet saluting yet the Officer over all




Apparitions

 A vague mist hanging round half the pages
 Sometimes how strange and clear to the soul
 That all these solid things are indeed but apparitions concepts
 nonrealities




The Pallid Wreath

 Somehow I cannot let it go yet funeral though it is
 Let it remain back there on its nail suspended
 With pink blue yellow all blanchd and the white now gray and ashy
 One witherd rose put years ago for thee dear friend
 But I do not forget thee Hast thou then faded
 Is the odor exhaled Are the colors vitalities dead
 No while memories subtly playthe past vivid as ever
 For but last night I woke and in that spectral ring saw thee
 Thy smile eyes face calm silent loving as ever
 So let the wreath hang still awhile within my eyereach
 It is not yet dead to me nor even pallid




An Ended Day

 The soothing sanity and blitheness of completion
 The pomp and hurried contestglare and rush are done
 Now triumph transformation jubilate




Old Ages Ship  Crafty Deaths

 From east and west across the horizons edge
 Two mighty masterful vessels sailers steal upon us
 But well make race atime upon the seasa battlecontest yet bear
 lively there
 Our joys of strife and derringdo to the last
 Put on the old ship all her power today
 Crowd topsail topgallant and royal studdingsails
 Out challenge and defianceflags and flaunting pennants added
 As we take to the opentake to the deepest freest waters




To the Pending Year

 Have I no weaponword for theesome message brief and fierce
 Have I fought out and done indeed the battle Is there no shot left
 For all thy affectations lisps scorns manifold silliness
 Nor for myselfmy own rebellious self in thee

 Down down proud gorgethough choking thee
 Thy bearded throat and highborne forehead to the gutter
 Crouch low thy neck to eleemosynary gifts




ShakspereBacons Cipher

 I doubt it notthen more far more
 In each old song bequeathdin every noble page or text
 Differentsomething unreckd beforesome unsuspected author
 In every object mountain tree and starin every birth and life
 As part of eachevolvd from eachmeaning behind the ostent
 A mystic cipher waits infolded




Long Long Hence

 After a long long course hundreds of years denials
 Accumulations rousd love and joy and thought
 Hopes wishes aspirations ponderings victories myriads of readers
 Coating compassing coveringafter ages and ages encrustations
 Then only may these songs reach fruition




Bravo Paris Exposition

 Add to your show before you close it France
 With all the rest visible concrete temples towers goods
 machines and ores
 Our sentiment wafted from many million heartthrobs ethereal but solid
 We grandsons and greatgrandsons do not forget your grandsires
 From fifty Nations and nebulous Nations compacted sent oversea today
 Americas applause love memories and goodwill




Interpolation Sounds

 Over and through the burial chant
 Organ and solemn service sermon bending priests
 To me come interpolation sounds not in the showplainly to me
 crowding up the aisle and from the window
 Of sudden battles hurry and harsh noiseswars grim game to sight
 and ear in earnest
 The scout calld up and forwardthe general mounted and his aides
 around himthe newbrought wordthe instantaneous order issued
 The rifle crackthe cannon thudthe rushing forth of men from their
 tents
 The clank of cavalrythe strange celerity of forming ranksthe
 slender bugle note
 The sound of horses hoofs departingsaddles arms accoutrements




To the SunSet Breeze

 Ah whispering something again unseen
 Where late this heated day thou enterest at my window door
 Thou laving tempering all coolfreshing gently vitalizing
 Me old alone sick weakdown meltedworn with sweat
 Thou nestling folding close and firm yet soft companion better
 than talk book art
 Thou hast O Nature elements utterance to my heart beyond the
 restand this is of them
 So sweet thy primitive taste to breathe withinthy soothing fingers
 my face and hands
 Thou messengermagical strange bringer to body and spirit of me
 Distances balkdoccult medicines penetrating me from head to foot
 I feel the sky the prairies vastI feel the mighty northern lakes
 I feel the ocean and the forestsomehow I feel the globe itself
 swiftswimming in space
 Thou blown from lips so loved now gonehaply from endless store
 Godsent
 For thou art spiritual Godly most of all known to my sense
 Minister to speak to me here and now what word has never told and
 cannot tell
 Art thou not universal concretes distillation Laws all
 Astronomys last refinement
 Hast thou no soul Can I not know identify thee




Old Chants

 An ancient song reciting ending
 Once gazing toward thee Mother of All
 Musing seeking themes fitted for thee
 Accept me thou saidst the elder ballads
 And name for me before thou goest each ancient poet

 Of many debts incalculable
 Haply our New Worlds chieftest debt is to old poems

 Ever so far back preluding thee America
 Old chants Egyptian priests and those of Ethiopia
 The Hindu epics the Grecian Chinese Persian
 The Biblic books and prophets and deep idyls of the Nazarene
 The Iliad Odyssey plots doings wanderings of Eneas
 Hesiod Eschylus Sophocles Merlin Arthur
 The Cid Roland at Roncesvalles the Nibelungen
 The troubadours minstrels minnesingers skalds
 Chaucer Dante flocks of singing birds
 The Border Minstrelsy the byegone ballads feudal tales essays plays
 Shakespere Schiller Walter Scott Tennyson
 As some vast wondrous weird dreampresences
 The great shadowy groups gathering around
 Darting their mighty masterful eyes forward at thee
 Thou with as now thy bending neck and head with courteous hand
 and word ascending
 Thou pausing a moment drooping thine eyes upon them blent
 with their music
 Well pleased accepting all curiously prepared for by them
 Thou enterest at thy entrance porch




A Christmas Greeting

 Welcome Brazilian brotherthy ample place is ready
 A loving handa smile from the northa sunny instant hall
 Let the future care for itself where it reveals its troubles
 impedimentas
 Ours ours the present throe the democratic aim the acceptance and
 the faith
 To thee today our reaching arm our turning neckto thee from us
 the expectant eye
 Thou cluster free thou brilliant lustrous one thou learning well
 The true lesson of a nations light in the sky
 More shining than the Cross more than the Crown
 The height to be superb humanity




Sounds of the Winter

 Sounds of the winter too
 Sunshine upon the mountainsmany a distant strain
 From cheery railroad trainfrom nearer field barn house
 The whispering aireven the mute crops garnerd apples corn
 Childrens and womens tonesrhythm of many a farmer and of flail
 An old mans garrulous lips among the rest Think not we give out yet
 Forth from these snowy hairs we keep up yet the lilt




A Twilight Song

 As I sit in twilight late alone by the flickering oakflame
 Musing on longpassd warscenesof the countless buried unknown
 soldiers
 Of the vacant names as unindented airs and seasthe unreturnd
 The brief truce after battle with grim burialsquads and the
 deepfilld trenches
 Of gatherd from dead all America North South East West whence
 they came up
 From wooded Maine NewEnglands farms from fertile Pennsylvania
 Illinois Ohio
 From the measureless West Virginia the South the Carolinas Texas
 Even here in my roomshadows and halflights in the noiseless
 flickering flames
 Again I see the stalwart ranks onfiling risingI hear the
 rhythmic tramp of the armies
 You million unwrit names all allyou dark bequest from all the war
 A special verse for youa flash of duty long neglectedyour mystic
 roll strangely gatherd here
 Each name recalld by me from out the darkness and deaths ashes
 Henceforth to be deep deep within my heart recording for many
 future year
 Your mystic roll entire of unknown names or North or South
 Embalmd with love in this twilight song




When the FullGrown Poet Came

 When the fullgrown poet came
 Out spake pleased Nature the round impassive globe with all its
 shows of day and night saying He is mine
 But out spake too the Soul of man proud jealous and unreconciled
 Nay he is mine alone
 Then the fullgrown poet stood between the two and took each
 by the hand
 And today and ever so stands as blender uniter tightly holding hands
 Which he will never release until he reconciles the two
 And wholly and joyously blends them




Osceola

 When his hour for death had come
 He slowly raisd himself from the bed on the floor
 Drew on his wardress shirt leggings and girdled the belt around
 his waist
 Calld for vermilion paint his lookingglass was held before him
 Painted half his face and neck his wrists and backhands
 Put the scalpknife carefully in his beltthen lying down resting
 moment
 Rose again half sitting smiled gave in silence his extended hand
 to each and all
 Sank faintly low to the floor tightly grasping the tomahawk handle
 Fixd his look on wife and little childrenthe last

 And here a line in memory of his name and death




A Voice from Death

 A voice from Death solemn and strange in all his sweep and power
 With sudden indescribable blowtowns drowndhumanity by
 thousands slain
 The vaunted work of thrift goods dwellings forge street iron bridge
 Dashd pellmell by the blowyet usherd life continuing on
 Amid the rest amid the rushing whirling wild debris
 A suffering woman saveda baby safely born

 Although I come and unannouncd in horror and in pang
 In pouring flood and fire and wholesale elemental crash this
 voice so solemn strange
 I too a minister of Deity

 Yea Death we bow our faces veil our eyes to thee
 We mourn the old the young untimely drawn to thee
 The fair the strong the good the capable
 The household wreckd the husband and the wife the engulfed forger
 in his forge
 The corpses in the whelming waters and the mud
 The gatherd thousands to their funeral mounds and thousands never
 found or gatherd

 Then after burying mourning the dead
 Faithful to them found or unfound forgetting not bearing the
 past here new musing
 A daya passing moment or an hourAmerica itself bends low
 Silent resignd submissive

 War death cataclysm like this America
 Take deep to thy proud prosperous heart

 Een as I chant lo out of death and out of ooze and slime
 The blossoms rapidly blooming sympathy help love
 From West and East from South and North and over sea
 Its hotspurrd hearts and hands humanity to human aid moves on
 And from within a thought and lesson yet

 Thou everdarting Globe through Space and Air
 Thou waters that encompass us
 Thou that in all the life and death of us in action or in sleep
 Thou laws invisible that permeate them and all
 Thou that in all and over all and through and under all incessant
 Thou thou the vital universal giant force resistless sleepless calm
 Holding Humanity as in thy open hand as some ephemeral toy
 How ill to eer forget thee

 For I too have forgotten
 Wrapt in these little potencies of progress politics culture
 wealth inventions civilization
 Have lost my recognition of your silent everswaying power ye
 mighty elemental throes
 In which and upon which we float and every one of us is buoyd




A Persian Lesson

 For his oerarching and last lesson the greybeard sufi
 In the fresh scent of the morning in the open air
 On the slope of a teeming Persian rosegarden
 Under an ancient chestnuttree wide spreading its branches
 Spoke to the young priests and students

 Finally my children to envelop each word each part of the rest
 Allah is all all allimmanent in every life and object
 Maybe at many and manyamore removesyet Allah Allah Allah is there

 Has the estray wanderd far Is the reasonwhy strangely hidden
 Would you sound below the restless ocean of the entire world
 Would you know the dissatisfaction the urge and spur of every life
 The something never stilldnever entirely gone the invisible need
 of every seed

 It is the central urge in every atom
 Often unconscious often evil downfallen
 To return to its divine source and origin however distant
 Latent the same in subject and in object without one exception




The Commonplace

 The commonplace I sing
 How cheap is health how cheap nobility
 Abstinence no falsehood no gluttony lust
 The open air I sing freedom toleration
 Take here the mainest lessonless from booksless from the schools
 The common day and nightthe common earth and waters
 Your farmyour work trade occupation
 The democratic wisdom underneath like solid ground for all




The Rounded Catalogue Divine Complete

 The devilish and the dark the dying and diseasd
 The countless nineteentwentieths low and evil crude and savage
 The crazed prisoners in jail the horrible rank malignant
 Venom and filth serpents the ravenous sharks liars the dissolute
 What is the part the wicked and the loathesome bear within earths
 orbic scheme
 Newts crawling things in slime and mud poisons
 The barren soil the evil men the slag and hideous rot




Mirages

 More experiences and sights stranger than youd think for
 Times again now mostly just after sunrise or before sunset
 Sometimes in spring oftener in autumn perfectly clear weather in
 plain sight
 Camps far or near the crowded streets of cities and the shopfronts
 Account for it or notcredit or notit is all true
 And my mate there could tell you the likewe have often confabd
 about it
 People and scenes animals trees colors and lines plain as could be
 Farms and dooryards of home paths borderd with box lilacs in corners
 Weddings in churches thanksgiving dinners returns of longabsent sons
 Glum funerals the crapeveild mother and the daughters
 Trials in courts jury and judge the accused in the box
 Contestants battles crowds bridges wharves
 Now and then markd faces of sorrow or joy
 I could pick them out this moment if I saw them again
 Showd to mejust to the right in the skyedge
 Or plainly there to the left on the hilltops




L of Gs Purport

 Not to exclude or demarcate or pick out evils from their formidable
 masses even to expose them
 But add fuse complete extendand celebrate the immortal and the good
 Haughty this song its words and scope
 To span vast realms of space and time
 Evolutionthe cumulativegrowths and generations

 Begun in ripend youth and steadily pursued
 Wandering peering dallying with allwar peace day and night
 absorbing
 Never even for one brief hour abandoning my task
 I end it here in sickness poverty and old age

 I sing of life yet mind me well of death
 Today shadowy Death dogs my steps my seated shape and has for years
 Draws sometimes close to me as face to face




The Unexpressd

 How dare one say it
 After the cycles poems singers plays
 Vaunted Ionias IndiasHomer Shaksperethe long long times
 thick dotted roads areas
 The shining clusters and the Milky Ways of starsNatures pulses reapd
 All retrospective passions heroes war love adoration
 All ages plummets dropt to their utmost depths
 All human lives throats wishes brainsall experiences utterance
 After the countless songs or long or short all tongues all lands
 Still something not yet told in poesys voice or printsomething lacking
 Who knows the best yet unexpressd and lacking




Grand Is the Seen

 Grand is the seen the light to megrand are the sky and stars
 Grand is the earth and grand are lasting time and space
 And grand their laws so multiform puzzling evolutionary
 But grander far the unseen soul of me comprehending endowing all those
 Lighting the light the sky and stars delving the earth sailing
 the sea
 What were all those indeed without thee unseen soul of what
 amount without thee
 More evolutionary vast puzzling O my soul
 More multiform farmore lasting thou than they




Unseen Buds

 Unseen buds infinite hidden well
 Under the snow and ice under the darkness in every square or cubic inch
 Germinal exquisite in delicate lace microscopic unborn
 Like babes in wombs latent folded compact sleeping
 Billions of billions and trillions of trillions of them waiting
 On earth and in the seathe universethe stars there in the
 heavens
 Urging slowly surely forward forming endless
 And waiting ever more forever more behind




GoodBye My Fancy

 Goodbye my Fancy
 Farewell dear mate dear love
 Im going away I know not where
 Or to what fortune or whether I may ever see you again
 So Goodbye my Fancy

 Now for my lastlet me look back a moment
 The slower fainter ticking of the clock is in me
 Exit nightfall and soon the heartthud stopping

 Long have we lived joyd caressd together
 Delightfulnow separationGoodbye my Fancy

 Yet let me not be too hasty
 Long indeed have we lived slept filterd become really blended
 into one
 Then if we die we die together yes well remain one
 If we go anywhere well go together to meet what happens
 Maybe well be better off and blither and learn something
 Maybe it is yourself now really ushering me to the true songs who
 knows
 Maybe it is you the mortal knob really undoing turningso now finally
 Goodbyeand hail my Fancy
