THE BEAST IN THE JUNGLE


CHAPTER I


What determined the speech that startled him in the course of their
encounter scarcely matters being probably but some words spoken by
himself quite without intentionspoken as they lingered and slowly moved
together after their renewal of acquaintance He had been conveyed by
friends an hour or two before to the house at which she was staying the
party of visitors at the other house of whom he was one and thanks to
whom it was his theory as always that he was lost in the crowd had
been invited over to luncheon There had been after luncheon much
dispersal all in the interest of the original motive a view of
Weatherend itself and the fine things intrinsic features pictures
heirlooms treasures of all the arts that made the place almost famous
and the great rooms were so numerous that guests could wander at their
will hang back from the principal group and in cases where they took
such matters with the last seriousness give themselves up to mysterious
appreciations and measurements There were persons to be observed
singly or in couples bending toward objects in outoftheway corners
with their hands on their knees and their heads nodding quite as with the
emphasis of an excited sense of smell When they were two they either
mingled their sounds of ecstasy or melted into silences of even deeper
import so that there were aspects of the occasion that gave it for
Marcher much the air of the look round previous to a sale highly
advertised that excites or quenches as may be the dream of
acquisition The dream of acquisition at Weatherend would have had to be
wild indeed and John Marcher found himself among such suggestions
disconcerted almost equally by the presence of those who knew too much
and by that of those who knew nothing The great rooms caused so much
poetry and history to press upon him that he needed some straying apart
to feel in a proper relation with them though this impulse was not as
happened like the gloating of some of his companions to be compared to
the movements of a dog sniffing a cupboard It had an issue promptly
enough in a direction that was not to have been calculated

It led briefly in the course of the October afternoon to his closer
meeting with May Bartram whose face a reminder yet not quite a
remembrance as they sat much separated at a very long table had begun
merely by troubling him rather pleasantly It affected him as the sequel
of something of which he had lost the beginning He knew it and for the
time quite welcomed it as a continuation but didnt know what it
continued which was an interest or an amusement the greater as he was
also somehow awareyet without a direct sign from herthat the young
woman herself hadnt lost the thread She hadnt lost it but she
wouldnt give it back to him he saw without some putting forth of his
hand for it and he not only saw that but saw several things more
things odd enough in the light of the fact that at the moment some
accident of grouping brought them face to face he was still merely
fumbling with the idea that any contact between them in the past would
have had no importance If it had had no importance he scarcely knew why
his actual impression of her should so seem to have so much the answer
to which however was that in such a life as they all appeared to be
leading for the moment one could but take things as they came He was
satisfied without in the least being able to say why that this young
lady might roughly have ranked in the house as a poor relation satisfied
also that she was not there on a brief visit but was more or less a part
of the establishmentalmost a working a remunerated part Didnt she
enjoy at periods a protection that she paid for by helping among other
services to show the place and explain it deal with the tiresome
people answer questions about the dates of the building the styles of
the furniture the authorship of the pictures the favourite haunts of
the ghost It wasnt that she looked as if you could have given her
shillingsit was impossible to look less so Yet when she finally
drifted toward him distinctly handsome though ever so much olderolder
than when he had seen her beforeit might have been as an effect of her
guessing that he had within the couple of hours devoted more
imagination to her than to all the others put together and had thereby
penetrated to a kind of truth that the others were too stupid for She
_was_ there on harder terms than any one she was there as a consequence
of things suffered one way and another in the interval of years and
she remembered him very much as she was rememberedonly a good deal
better

By the time they at last thus came to speech they were alone in one of
the roomsremarkable for a fine portrait over the chimneyplaceout of
which their friends had passed and the charm of it was that even before
they had spoken they had practically arranged with each other to stay
behind for talk The charm happily was in other things toopartly in
there being scarce a spot at Weatherend without something to stay behind
for It was in the way the autumn day looked into the high windows as it
waned the way the red light breaking at the close from under a low
sombre sky reached out in a long shaft and played over old wainscots
old tapestry old gold old colour It was most of all perhaps in the
way she came to him as if since she had been turned on to deal with the
simpler sort he might should he choose to keep the whole thing down
just take her mild attention for a part of her general business As soon
as he heard her voice however the gap was filled up and the missing
link supplied the slight irony he divined in her attitude lost its
advantage He almost jumped at it to get there before her I met you
years and years ago in Rome I remember all about it She confessed to
disappointmentshe had been so sure he didnt and to prove how well he
did he began to pour forth the particular recollections that popped up as
he called for them Her face and her voice all at his service now
worked the miraclethe impression operating like the torch of a
lamplighter who touches into flame one by one a long row of gasjets
Marcher flattered himself the illumination was brilliant yet he was
really still more pleased on her showing him with amusement that in his
haste to make everything right he had got most things rather wrong It
hadnt been at Romeit had been at Naples and it hadnt been eight
years beforeit had been more nearly ten She hadnt been either with
her uncle and aunt but with her mother and brother in addition to which
it was not with the Pembles _he_ had been but with the Boyers coming
down in their company from Romea point on which she insisted a little
to his confusion and as to which she had her evidence in hand The
Boyers she had known but didnt know the Pembles though she had heard
of them and it was the people he was with who had made them acquainted
The incident of the thunderstorm that had raged round them with such
violence as to drive them for refuge into an excavationthis incident
had not occurred at the Palace of the Caesars but at Pompeii on an
occasion when they had been present there at an important find

He accepted her amendments he enjoyed her corrections though the moral
of them was she pointed out that he _really_ didnt remember the least
thing about her and he only felt it as a drawback that when all was made
strictly historic there didnt appear much of anything left They
lingered together still she neglecting her officefor from the moment
he was so clever she had no proper right to himand both neglecting the
house just waiting as to see if a memory or two more wouldnt again
breathe on them It hadnt taken them many minutes after all to put
down on the table like the cards of a pack those that constituted their
respective hands only what came out was that the pack was unfortunately
not perfectthat the past invoked invited encouraged could give
them naturally no more than it had It had made them anciently
meether at twenty him at twentyfive but nothing was so strange they
seemed to say to each other as that while so occupied it hadnt done a
little more for them They looked at each other as with the feeling of
an occasion missed the present would have been so much better if the
other in the far distance in the foreign land hadnt been so stupidly
meagre There werent apparently all counted more than a dozen little
old things that had succeeded in coming to pass between them
trivialities of youth simplicities of freshness stupidities of
ignorance small possible germs but too deeply buriedtoo deeply
didnt it seem to sprout after so many years Marcher could only feel
he ought to have rendered her some servicesaved her from a capsized
boat in the bay or at least recovered her dressingbag filched from her
cab in the streets of Naples by a lazzarone with a stiletto Or it would
have been nice if he could have been taken with fever all alone at his
hotel and she could have come to look after him to write to his people
to drive him out in convalescence _Then_ they would be in possession of
the something or other that their actual show seemed to lack It yet
somehow presented itself this show as too good to be spoiled so that
they were reduced for a few minutes more to wondering a little helplessly
whysince they seemed to know a certain number of the same peopletheir
reunion had been so long averted They didnt use that name for it but
their delay from minute to minute to join the others was a kind of
confession that they didnt quite want it to be a failure Their
attempted supposition of reasons for their not having met but showed how
little they knew of each other There came in fact a moment when Marcher
felt a positive pang It was vain to pretend she was an old friend for
all the communities were wanting in spite of which it was as an old
friend that he saw she would have suited him He had new ones enoughwas
surrounded with them for instance on the stage of the other house as a
new one he probably wouldnt have so much as noticed her He would have
liked to invent something get her to makebelieve with him that some
passage of a romantic or critical kind _had_ originally occurred He was
really almost reaching out in imaginationas against timefor something
that would do and saying to himself that if it didnt come this sketch
of a fresh start would show for quite awkwardly bungled They would
separate and now for no second or no third chance They would have
tried and not succeeded Then it was just at the turn as he afterwards
made it out to himself that everything else failing she herself
decided to take up the case and as it were save the situation He felt
as soon as she spoke that she had been consciously keeping back what she
said and hoping to get on without it a scruple in her that immensely
touched him when by the end of three or four minutes more he was able
to measure it What she brought out at any rate quite cleared the air
and supplied the linkthe link it was so odd he should frivolously have
managed to lose

You know you told me something Ive never forgotten and that again and
again has made me think of you since it was that tremendously hot day
when we went to Sorrento across the bay for the breeze What I allude
to was what you said to me on the way back as we sat under the awning
of the boat enjoying the cool Have you forgotten

He had forgotten and was even more surprised than ashamed But the
great thing was that he saw in this no vulgar reminder of any sweet
speech The vanity of women had long memories but she was making no
claim on him of a compliment or a mistake With another woman a totally
different one he might have feared the recall possibly even some
imbecile offer So in having to say that he had indeed forgotten he
was conscious rather of a loss than of a gain he already saw an interest
in the matter of her mention I try to thinkbut I give it up Yet I
remember the Sorrento day

Im not very sure you do May Bartram after a moment said and Im not
very sure I ought to want you to Its dreadful to bring a person back
at any time to what he was ten years before If youve lived away from
it she smiled so much the better

Ah if _you_ havent why should I he asked

Lived away you mean from what I myself was

From what _I_ was I was of course an ass Marcher went on but I
would rather know from you just the sort of ass I was thanfrom the
moment you have something in your mindnot know anything

Still however she hesitated But if youve completely ceased to be
that sort

Why I can then all the more bear to know Besides perhaps I havent

Perhaps Yet if you havent she added I should suppose youd
remember Not indeed that _I_ in the least connect with my impression
the invidious name you use If I had only thought you foolish she
explained the thing I speak of wouldnt so have remained with me It
was about yourself She waited as if it might come to him but as only
meeting her eyes in wonder he gave no sign she burnt her ships Has
it ever happened

Then it was that while he continued to stare a light broke for him and
the blood slowly came to his face which began to burn with recognition

Do you mean I told you But he faltered lest what came to him
shouldnt be right lest he should only give himself away

It was something about yourself that it was natural one shouldnt
forgetthat is if one remembered you at all Thats why I ask you she
smiled if the thing you then spoke of has ever come to pass

Oh then he saw but he was lost in wonder and found himself embarrassed
This he also saw made her sorry for him as if her allusion had been a
mistake It took him but a moment however to feel it hadnt been much
as it had been a surprise After the first little shock of it her
knowledge on the contrary began even if rather strangely to taste sweet
to him She was the only other person in the world then who would have
it and she had had it all these years while the fact of his having so
breathed his secret had unaccountably faded from him No wonder they
couldnt have met as if nothing had happened I judge he finally
said that I know what you mean Only I had strangely enough lost any
sense of having taken you so far into my confidence

Is it because youve taken so many others as well

Ive taken nobody Not a creature since then

So that Im the only person who knows

The only person in the world

Well she quickly replied I myself have never spoken Ive never
never repeated of you what you told me She looked at him so that he
perfectly believed her Their eyes met over it in such a way that he was
without a doubt And I never will

She spoke with an earnestness that as if almost excessive put him at
ease about her possible derision Somehow the whole question was a new
luxury to himthat is from the moment she was in possession If she
didnt take the sarcastic view she clearly took the sympathetic and that
was what he had had in all the long time from no one whomsoever What
he felt was that he couldnt at present have begun to tell her and yet
could profit perhaps exquisitely by the accident of having done so of
old Please dont then Were just right as it is

Oh I am she laughed if you are To which she added Then you do
still feel in the same way

It was impossible he shouldnt take to himself that she was really
interested though it all kept coming as a perfect surprise He had
thought of himself so long as abominably alone and lo he wasnt alone a
bit He hadnt been it appeared for an hoursince those moments on
the Sorrento boat It was she who had been he seemed to see as he
looked at hershe who had been made so by the graceless fact of his
lapse of fidelity To tell her what he had told herwhat had it been
but to ask something of her something that she had given in her
charity without his having by a remembrance by a return of the spirit
failing another encounter so much as thanked her What he had asked of
her had been simply at first not to laugh at him She had beautifully
not done so for ten years and she was not doing so now So he had
endless gratitude to make up Only for that he must see just how he had
figured to her What exactly was the account I gave

Of the way you did feel Well it was very simple You said you had
had from your earliest time as the deepest thing within you the sense
of being kept for something rare and strange possibly prodigious and
terrible that was sooner or later to happen to you that you had in your
bones the foreboding and the conviction of and that would perhaps
overwhelm you

Do you call that very simple John Marcher asked

She thought a moment It was perhaps because I seemed as you spoke to
understand it

You do understand it he eagerly asked

Again she kept her kind eyes on him You still have the belief

Oh he exclaimed helplessly There was too much to say

Whatever its to be she clearly made out it hasnt yet come

He shook his head in complete surrender now It hasnt yet come Only
you know it isnt anything Im to do to achieve in the world to be
distinguished or admired for Im not such an ass as _that_ It would
be much better no doubt if I were

Its to be something youre merely to suffer

Well say to wait forto have to meet to face to see suddenly break
out in my life possibly destroying all further consciousness possibly
annihilating me possibly on the other hand only altering everything
striking at the root of all my world and leaving me to the consequences
however they shape themselves

She took this in but the light in her eyes continued for him not to be
that of mockery Isnt what you describe perhaps but the expectationor
at any rate the sense of danger familiar to so many peopleof falling
in love

John Marcher thought Did you ask me that before

NoI wasnt so freeandeasy then But its what strikes me now

Of course he said after a moment it strikes you Of course it
strikes _me_ Of course whats in store for me may be no more than that
The only thing is he went on that I think if it had been that I
should by this time know

Do you mean because youve _been_ in love And then as he but looked
at her in silence Youve been in love and it hasnt meant such a
cataclysm hasnt proved the great affair

Here I am you see It hasnt been overwhelming

Then it hasnt been love said May Bartram

Well I at least thought it was I took it for thatIve taken it till
now It was agreeable it was delightful it was miserable he
explained But it wasnt strange It wasnt what my affairs to be

You want something all to yourselfsomething that nobody else knows or
_has_ known

It isnt a question of what I wantGod knows I dont want anything
Its only a question of the apprehension that haunts methat I live with
day by day

He said this so lucidly and consistently that he could see it further
impose itself If she hadnt been interested before shed have been
interested now

Is it a sense of coming violence

Evidently now too again he liked to talk of it I dont think of it
aswhen it does comenecessarily violent I only think of it as
natural and as of course above all unmistakeable I think of it simply
as _the_ thing _The_ thing will of itself appear natural

Then how will it appear strange

Marcher bethought himself It wontto _me_

To whom then

Well he replied smiling at last say to you

Oh then Im to be present

Why you are presentsince you know

I see She turned it over But I mean at the catastrophe

At this for a minute their lightness gave way to their gravity it was
as if the long look they exchanged held them together It will only
depend on yourselfif youll watch with me

Are you afraid she asked

Dont leave me now he went on

Are you afraid she repeated

Do you think me simply out of my mind he pursued instead of answering
Do I merely strike you as a harmless lunatic

No said May Bartram I understand you I believe you

You mean you feel how my obsessionpoor old thingmay correspond to
some possible reality

To some possible reality

Then you _will_ watch with me

She hesitated then for the third time put her question Are you
afraid

Did I tell you I wasat Naples

No you said nothing about it

Then I dont know And I should like to know said John Marcher
Youll tell me yourself whether you think so If youll watch with me
youll see

Very good then They had been moving by this time across the room and
at the door before passing out they paused as for the full windup of
their understanding Ill watch with you said May Bartram




CHAPTER II


The fact that she knewknew and yet neither chaffed him nor betrayed
himhad in a short time begun to constitute between them a goodly bond
which became more marked when within the year that followed their
afternoon at Weatherend the opportunities for meeting multiplied The
event that thus promoted these occasions was the death of the ancient
lady her greataunt under whose wing since losing her mother she had
to such an extent found shelter and who though but the widowed mother
of the new successor to the property had succeededthanks to a high
tone and a high temperin not forfeiting the supreme position at the
great house The deposition of this personage arrived but with her
death which followed by many changes made in particular a difference
for the young woman in whom Marchers expert attention had recognised
from the first a dependent with a pride that might ache though it didnt
bristle Nothing for a long time had made him easier than the thought
that the aching must have been much soothed by Miss Bartrams now finding
herself able to set up a small home in London She had acquired
property to an amount that made that luxury just possible under her
aunts extremely complicated will and when the whole matter began to be
straightened out which indeed took time she let him know that the happy
issue was at last in view He had seen her again before that day both
because she had more than once accompanied the ancient lady to town and
because he had paid another visit to the friends who so conveniently made
of Weatherend one of the charms of their own hospitality These friends
had taken him back there he had achieved there again with Miss Bartram
some quiet detachment and he had in London succeeded in persuading her
to more than one brief absence from her aunt They went together on
these latter occasions to the National Gallery and the South Kensington
Museum where among vivid reminders they talked of Italy at largenot
now attempting to recover as at first the taste of their youth and
their ignorance That recovery the first day at Weatherend had served
its purpose well had given them quite enough so that they were to
Marchers sense no longer hovering about the headwaters of their
stream but had felt their boat pushed sharply off and down the current

They were literally afloat together for our gentleman this was marked
quite as marked as that the fortunate cause of it was just the buried
treasure of her knowledge He had with his own hands dug up this little
hoard brought to lightthat is to within reach of the dim day
constituted by their discretions and privaciesthe object of value the
hidingplace of which he had after putting it into the ground himself
so strangely so long forgotten The rare luck of his having again just
stumbled on the spot made him indifferent to any other question he would
doubtless have devoted more time to the odd accident of his lapse of
memory if he hadnt been moved to devote so much to the sweetness the
comfort as he felt for the future that this accident itself had helped
to keep fresh It had never entered into his plan that any one should
know and mainly for the reason that it wasnt in him to tell any one
That would have been impossible for nothing but the amusement of a cold
world would have waited on it Since however a mysterious fate had
opened his mouth betimes in spite of him he would count that a
compensation and profit by it to the utmost That the right person
_should_ know tempered the asperity of his secret more even than his
shyness had permitted him to imagine and May Bartram was clearly right
becausewell because there she was Her knowledge simply settled it
he would have been sure enough by this time had she been wrong There
was that in his situation no doubt that disposed him too much to see
her as a mere confidant taking all her light for him from the factthe
fact onlyof her interest in his predicament from her mercy sympathy
seriousness her consent not to regard him as the funniest of the funny
Aware in fine that her price for him was just in her giving him this
constant sense of his being admirably spared he was careful to remember
that she had also a life of her own with things that might happen to
_her_ things that in friendship one should likewise take account of
Something fairly remarkable came to pass with him for that matter in
this connexionsomething represented by a certain passage of his
consciousness in the suddenest way from one extreme to the other

He had thought himself so long as nobody knew the most disinterested
person in the world carrying his concentrated burden his perpetual
suspense ever so quietly holding his tongue about it giving others no
glimpse of it nor of its effect upon his life asking of them no
allowance and only making on his side all those that were asked He
hadnt disturbed people with the queerness of their having to know a
haunted man though he had had moments of rather special temptation on
hearing them say they were forsooth unsettled If they were as
unsettled as he washe who had never been settled for an hour in his
lifethey would know what it meant Yet it wasnt all the same for
him to make them and he listened to them civilly enough This was why
he had such goodthough possibly such rather colourlessmanners this
was why above all he could regard himself in a greedy world as
decentlyas in fact perhaps even a little sublimelyunselfish Our
point is accordingly that he valued this character quite sufficiently to
measure his present danger of letting it lapse against which he promised
himself to be much on his guard He was quite ready none the less to
be selfish just a little since surely no more charming occasion for it
had come to him Just a little in a word was just as much as Miss
Bartram taking one day with another would let him He never would be
in the least coercive and would keep well before him the lines on which
consideration for herthe very highestought to proceed He would
thoroughly establish the heads under which her affairs her requirements
her peculiaritieshe went so far as to give them the latitude of that
namewould come into their intercourse All this naturally was a sign
of how much he took the intercourse itself for granted There was
nothing more to be done about that It simply existed had sprung into
being with her first penetrating question to him in the autumn light
there at Weatherend The real form it should have taken on the basis
that stood out large was the form of their marrying But the devil in
this was that the very basis itself put marrying out of the question His
conviction his apprehension his obsession in short wasnt a privilege
he could invite a woman to share and that consequence of it was
precisely what was the matter with him Something or other lay in wait
for him amid the twists and the turns of the months and the years like
a crouching Beast in the Jungle It signified little whether the
crouching Beast were destined to slay him or to be slain The definite
point was the inevitable spring of the creature and the definite lesson
from that was that a man of feeling didnt cause himself to be
accompanied by a lady on a tigerhunt Such was the image under which he
had ended by figuring his life

They had at first none the less in the scattered hours spent together
made no allusion to that view of it which was a sign he was handsomely
alert to give that he didnt expect that he in fact didnt care always
to be talking about it Such a feature in ones outlook was really like
a hump on ones back The difference it made every minute of the day
existed quite independently of discussion One discussed of course
_like_ a hunchback for there was always if nothing else the hunchback
face That remained and she was watching him but people watched best
as a general thing in silence so that such would be predominantly the
manner of their vigil Yet he didnt want at the same time to be tense
and solemn tense and solemn was what he imagined he too much showed for
with other people The thing to be with the one person who knew was
easy and naturalto make the reference rather than be seeming to avoid
it to avoid it rather than be seeming to make it and to keep it in any
case familiar facetious even rather than pedantic and portentous Some
such consideration as the latter was doubtless in his mind for instance
when he wrote pleasantly to Miss Bartram that perhaps the great thing he
had so long felt as in the lap of the gods was no more than this
circumstance which touched him so nearly of her acquiring a house in
London It was the first allusion they had yet again made needing any
other hitherto so little but when she replied after having given him
the news that she was by no means satisfied with such a trifle as the
climax to so special a suspense she almost set him wondering if she
hadnt even a larger conception of singularity for him than he had for
himself He was at all events destined to become aware little by little
as time went by that she was all the while looking at his life judging
it measuring it in the light of the thing she knew which grew to be at
last with the consecration of the years never mentioned between them
save as the real truth about him That had always been his own form of
reference to it but she adopted the form so quietly that looking back
at the end of a period he knew there was no moment at which it was
traceable that she had as he might say got inside his idea or
exchanged the attitude of beautifully indulging for that of still more
beautifully believing him

It was always open to him to accuse her of seeing him but as the most
harmless of maniacs and this in the long runsince it covered so much
groundwas his easiest description of their friendship He had a screw
loose for her but she liked him in spite of it and was practically
against the rest of the world his kind wise keeper unremunerated but
fairly amused and in the absence of other near ties not disreputably
occupied The rest of the world of course thought him queer but she
she only knew how and above all why queer which was precisely what
enabled her to dispose the concealing veil in the right folds She took
his gaiety from himsince it had to pass with them for gaietyas she
took everything else but she certainly so far justified by her unerring
touch his finer sense of the degree to which he had ended by convincing
her _She_ at least never spoke of the secret of his life except as the
real truth about you and she had in fact a wonderful way of making it
seem as such the secret of her own life too That was in fine how he
so constantly felt her as allowing for him he couldnt on the whole call
it anything else He allowed for himself but she exactly allowed
still more partly because better placed for a sight of the matter she
traced his unhappy perversion through reaches of its course into which he
could scarce follow it He knew how he felt but besides knowing that
she knew how he looked as well he knew each of the things of importance
he was insidiously kept from doing but she could add up the amount they
made understand how much with a lighter weight on his spirit he might
have done and thereby establish how clever as he was he fell short
Above all she was in the secret of the difference between the forms he
went throughthose of his little office under Government those of
caring for his modest patrimony for his library for his garden in the
country for the people in London whose invitations he accepted and
repaidand the detachment that reigned beneath them and that made of all
behaviour all that could in the least be called behaviour a long act of
dissimulation What it had come to was that he wore a mask painted with
the social simper out of the eyeholes of which there looked eyes of an
expression not in the least matching the other features This the stupid
world even after years had never more than half discovered It was
only May Bartram who had and she achieved by an art indescribable the
feat of at onceor perhaps it was only alternatelymeeting the eyes
from in front and mingling her own vision as from over his shoulder
with their peep through the apertures

So while they grew older together she did watch with him and so she let
this association give shape and colour to her own existence Beneath
_her_ forms as well detachment had learned to sit and behaviour had
become for her in the social sense a false account of herself There
was but one account of her that would have been true all the while and
that she could give straight to nobody least of all to John Marcher Her
whole attitude was a virtual statement but the perception of that only
seemed called to take its place for him as one of the many things
necessarily crowded out of his consciousness If she had moreover like
himself to make sacrifices to their real truth it was to be granted
that her compensation might have affected her as more prompt and more
natural They had long periods in this London time during which when
they were together a stranger might have listened to them without in the
least pricking up his ears on the other hand the real truth was equally
liable at any moment to rise to the surface and the auditor would then
have wondered indeed what they were talking about They had from an
early hour made up their mind that society was luckily unintelligent
and the margin allowed them by this had fairly become one of their
commonplaces Yet there were still moments when the situation turned
almost freshusually under the effect of some expression drawn from
herself Her expressions doubtless repeated themselves but her
intervals were generous What saves us you know is that we answer so
completely to so usual an appearance that of the man and woman whose
friendship has become such a daily habitor almostas to be at last
indispensable That for instance was a remark she had frequently enough
had occasion to make though she had given it at different times
different developments What we are especially concerned with is the
turn it happened to take from her one afternoon when he had come to see
her in honour of her birthday This anniversary had fallen on a Sunday
at a season of thick fog and general outward gloom but he had brought
her his customary offering having known her now long enough to have
established a hundred small traditions It was one of his proofs to
himself the present he made her on her birthday that he hadnt sunk
into real selfishness It was mostly nothing more than a small trinket
but it was always fine of its kind and he was regularly careful to pay
for it more than he thought he could afford Our habit saves you at
least dont you see because it makes you after all for the vulgar
indistinguishable from other men Whats the most inveterate mark of men
in general Why the capacity to spend endless time with dull womento
spend it I wont say without being bored but without minding that they
are without being driven off at a tangent by it which comes to the same
thing Im your dull woman a part of the daily bread for which you pray
at church That covers your tracks more than anything

And what covers yours asked Marcher whom his dull woman could mostly
to this extent amuse I see of course what you mean by your saving me
in this way and that so far as other people are concernedIve seen it
all along Only what is it that saves _you_ I often think you know
of that

She looked as if she sometimes thought of that too but rather in a
different way Where other people you mean are concerned

Well youre really so in with me you knowas a sort of result of my
being so in with yourself I mean of my having such an immense regard
for you being so tremendously mindful of all youve done for me I
sometimes ask myself if its quite fair Fair I mean to have so involved
andsince one may say itinterested you I almost feel as if you
hadnt really had time to do anything else

Anything else but be interested she asked Ah what else does one
ever want to be If Ive been watching with you as we long ago agreed
I was to do watchings always in itself an absorption

Oh certainly John Marcher said if you hadnt had your curiosity
Only doesnt it sometimes come to you as time goes on that your curiosity
isnt being particularly repaid

May Bartram had a pause Do you ask that by any chance because you
feel at all that yours isnt I mean because you have to wait so long

Oh he understood what she meant For the thing to happen that never
does happen For the Beast to jump out No Im just where I was about
it It isnt a matter as to which I can _choose_ I can decide for a
change It isnt one as to which there _can_ be a change Its in the
lap of the gods Ones in the hands of ones lawthere one is As to
the form the law will take the way it will operate thats its own
affair

Yes Miss Bartram replied of course ones fates coming of course it
_has_ come in its own form and its own way all the while Only you
know the form and the way in your case were to have beenwell
something so exceptional and as one may say so particularly _your_
own

Something in this made him look at her with suspicion You say were to
_have_ been as if in your heart you had begun to doubt

Oh she vaguely protested

As if you believed he went on that nothing will now take place

She shook her head slowly but rather inscrutably Youre far from my
thought

He continued to look at her What then is the matter with you

Well she said after another wait the matter with me is simply that
Im more sure than ever my curiosity as you call it will be but too
well repaid

They were frankly grave now he had got up from his seat had turned once
more about the little drawingroom to which year after year he brought
his inevitable topic in which he had as he might have said tasted
their intimate community with every sauce where every object was as
familiar to him as the things of his own house and the very carpets were
worn with his fitful walk very much as the desks in old countinghouses
are worn by the elbows of generations of clerks The generations of his
nervous moods had been at work there and the place was the written
history of his whole middle life Under the impression of what his
friend had just said he knew himself for some reason more aware of
these things which made him after a moment stop again before her Is
it possibly that youve grown afraid

Afraid He thought as she repeated the word that his question had
made her a little change colour so that lest he should have touched
on a truth he explained very kindly You remember that that was what
you asked _me_ long agothat first day at Weatherend

Oh yes and you told me you didnt knowthat I was to see for myself
Weve said little about it since even in so long a time

Precisely Marcher interposedquite as if it were too delicate a
matter for us to make free with Quite as if we might find on pressure
that I _am_ afraid For then he said we shouldnt should we quite
know what to do

She had for the time no answer to this question There have been days
when I thought you were Only of course she added there have been
days when we have thought almost anything

Everything Oh Marcher softly groaned as with a gasp half spent at
the face more uncovered just then than it had been for a long while of
the imagination always with them It had always had its incalculable
moments of glaring out quite as with the very eyes of the very Beast
and used as he was to them they could still draw from him the tribute
of a sigh that rose from the depths of his being All they had thought
first and last rolled over him the past seemed to have been reduced to
mere barren speculation This in fact was what the place had just struck
him as so full ofthe simplification of everything but the state of
suspense That remained only by seeming to hang in the void surrounding
it Even his original fear if fear it as had been had lost itself in
the desert I judge however he continued that you see Im not
afraid now

What I see as I make it out is that youve achieved something almost
unprecedented in the way of getting used to danger Living with it so
long and so closely youve lost your sense of it you know its there
but youre indifferent and you cease even as of old to have to whistle
in the dark Considering what the danger is May Bartram wound up Im
bound to say I dont think your attitude could well be surpassed

John Marcher faintly smiled Its heroic

Certainlycall it that

It was what he would have liked indeed to call it I _am_ then a man of
courage

Thats what you were to show me

He still however wondered But doesnt the man of courage know what
hes afraid ofor not afraid of I dont know _that_ you see I dont
focus it I cant name it I only know Im exposed

Yes but exposedhow shall I sayso directly So intimately Thats
surely enough

Enough to make you feel thenas what we may call the end and the upshot
of our watchthat Im not afraid

Youre not afraid But it isnt she said the end of our watch That
is it isnt the end of yours Youve everything still to see

Then why havent you he asked He had had all along today the
sense of her keeping something back and he still had it As this was
his first impression of that it quite made a date The case was the more
marked as she didnt at first answer which in turn made him go on You
know something I dont Then his voice for that of a man of courage
trembled a little You know whats to happen Her silence with the
face she showed was almost a confessionit made him sure You know
and youre afraid to tell me Its so bad that youre afraid Ill find
out

All this might be true for she did look as if unexpectedly to her he
had crossed some mystic line that she had secretly drawn round her Yet
she might after all not have worried and the real climax was that he
himself at all events neednt Youll never find out




CHAPTER III


It was all to have made none the less as I have said a date which
came out in the fact that again and again even after long intervals
other things that passed between them were in relation to this hour but
the character of recalls and results Its immediate effect had been
indeed rather to lighten insistencealmost to provoke a reaction as if
their topic had dropped by its own weight and as if moreover for that
matter Marcher had been visited by one of his occasional warnings
against egotism He had kept up he felt and very decently on the
whole his consciousness of the importance of not being selfish and it
was true that he had never sinned in that direction without promptly
enough trying to press the scales the other way He often repaired his
fault the season permitting by inviting his friend to accompany him to
the opera and it not infrequently thus happened that to show he didnt
wish her to have but one sort of food for her mind he was the cause of
her appearing there with him a dozen nights in the month It even
happened that seeing her home at such times he occasionally went in
with her to finish as he called it the evening and the better to make
his point sat down to the frugal but always careful little supper that
awaited his pleasure His point was made he thought by his not
eternally insisting with her on himself made for instance at such
hours when it befell that her piano at hand and each of them familiar
with it they went over passages of the opera together It chanced to be
on one of these occasions however that he reminded her of her not
having answered a certain question he had put to her during the talk that
had taken place between them on her last birthday What is it that
saves _you_saved her he meant from that appearance of variation
from the usual human type If he had practically escaped remark as she
pretended by doing in the most important particular what most men
dofind the answer to life in patching up an alliance of a sort with a
woman no better than himselfhow had she escaped it and how could the
alliance such as it was since they must suppose it had been more or
less noticed have failed to make her rather positively talked about

I never said May Bartram replied that it hadnt made me a good deal
talked about

Ah well then youre not saved

It hasnt been a question for me If youve had your woman Ive had
she said my man

And you mean that makes you all right

Oh it was always as if there were so much to say

I dont know why it shouldnt make mehumanly which is what were
speaking ofas right as it makes you

I see Marcher returned Humanly no doubt as showing that youre
living for something Not that is just for me and my secret

May Bartram smiled I dont pretend it exactly shows that Im not
living for you Its my intimacy with you thats in question

He laughed as he saw what she meant Yes but since as you say Im
only so far as people make out ordinary yourearent you no more
than ordinary either You help me to pass for a man like another So if
I _am_ as I understand you youre not compromised Is that it

She had another of her waits but she spoke clearly enough Thats it
Its all that concerns meto help you to pass for a man like another

He was careful to acknowledge the remark handsomely How kind how
beautiful you are to me How shall I ever repay you

She had her last grave pause as if there might be a choice of ways But
she chose By going on as you are

It was into this going on as he was that they relapsed and really for so
long a time that the day inevitably came for a further sounding of their
depths These depths constantly bridged over by a structure firm enough
in spite of its lightness and of its occasional oscillation in the
somewhat vertiginous air invited on occasion in the interest of their
nerves a dropping of the plummet and a measurement of the abyss A
difference had been made moreover once for all by the fact that she had
all the while not appeared to feel the need of rebutting his charge of an
idea within her that she didnt dare to expressa charge uttered just
before one of the fullest of their later discussions ended It had come
up for him then that she knew something and that what she knew was
badtoo bad to tell him When he had spoken of it as visibly so bad
that she was afraid he might find it out her reply had left the matter
too equivocal to be let alone and yet for Marchers special sensibility
almost too formidable again to touch He circled about it at a distance
that alternately narrowed and widened and that still wasnt much affected
by the consciousness in him that there was nothing she could know
after all any better than he did She had no source of knowledge he
hadnt equallyexcept of course that she might have finer nerves That
was what women had where they were interested they made out things
where people were concerned that the people often couldnt have made out
for themselves Their nerves their sensibility their imagination were
conductors and revealers and the beauty of May Bartram was in particular
that she had given herself so to his case He felt in these days what
oddly enough he had never felt before the growth of a dread of losing
her by some catastrophesome catastrophe that yet wouldnt at all be the
catastrophe partly because she had almost of a sudden begun to strike
him as more useful to him than ever yet and partly by reason of an
appearance of uncertainty in her health coincident and equally new It
was characteristic of the inner detachment he had hitherto so
successfully cultivated and to which our whole account of him is a
reference it was characteristic that his complications such as they
were had never yet seemed so as at this crisis to thicken about him
even to the point of making him ask himself if he were by any chance of
a truth within sight or sound within touch or reach within the
immediate jurisdiction of the thing that waited

When the day came as come it had to that his friend confessed to him
her fear of a deep disorder in her blood he felt somehow the shadow of a
change and the chill of a shock He immediately began to imagine
aggravations and disasters and above all to think of her peril as the
direct menace for himself of personal privation This indeed gave him
one of those partial recoveries of equanimity that were agreeable to
himit showed him that what was still first in his mind was the loss she
herself might suffer What if she should have to die before knowing
before seeing It would have been brutal in the early stages of her
trouble to put that question to her but it had immediately sounded for
him to his own concern and the possibility was what most made him sorry
for her If she did know moreover in the sense of her having had
somewhat should he thinkmystical irresistible light this would make
the matter not better but worse inasmuch as her original adoption of
his own curiosity had quite become the basis of her life She had been
living to see what would _be_ to be seen and it would quite lacerate her
to have to give up before the accomplishment of the vision These
reflexions as I say quickened his generosity yet make them as he
might he saw himself with the lapse of the period more and more
disconcerted It lapsed for him with a strange steady sweep and the
oddest oddity was that it gave him independently of the threat of much
inconvenience almost the only positive surprise his career if career it
could be called had yet offered him She kept the house as she had
never done he had to go to her to see hershe could meet him nowhere
now though there was scarce a corner of their loved old London in which
she hadnt in the past at one time or another done so and he found her
always seated by her fire in the deep oldfashioned chair she was less
and less able to leave He had been struck one day after an absence
exceeding his usual measure with her suddenly looking much older to him
than he had ever thought of her being then he recognised that the
suddenness was all on his sidehe had just simply and suddenly noticed
She looked older because inevitably after so many years she _was_ old
or almost which was of course true in still greater measure of her
companion If she was old or almost John Marcher assuredly was and
yet it was her showing of the lesson not his own that brought the truth
home to him His surprises began here when once they had begun they
multiplied they came rather with a rush it was as if in the oddest way
in the world they had all been kept back sown in a thick cluster for
the late afternoon of life the time at which for people in general the
unexpected has died out

One of them was that he should have caught himselffor he _had_ so
done_really_ wondering if the great accident would take form now as
nothing more than his being condemned to see this charming woman this
admirable friend pass away from him He had never so unreservedly
qualified her as while confronted in thought with such a possibility in
spite of which there was small doubt for him that as an answer to his
long riddle the mere effacement of even so fine a feature of his
situation would be an abject anticlimax It would represent as
connected with his past attitude a drop of dignity under the shadow of
which his existence could only become the most grotesques of failures He
had been far from holding it a failurelong as he had waited for the
appearance that was to make it a success He had waited for quite
another thing not for such a thing as that The breath of his good
faith came short however as he recognised how long he had waited or
how long at least his companion had That she at all events might be
recorded as having waited in vainthis affected him sharply and all the
more because of his at first having done little more than amuse himself
with the idea It grew more grave as the gravity of her condition grew
and the state of mind it produced in him which he himself ended by
watching as if it had been some definite disfigurement of his outer
person may pass for another of his surprises This conjoined itself
still with another the really stupefying consciousness of a question
that he would have allowed to shape itself had he dared What did
everything meanwhat that is did _she_ mean she and her vain waiting
and her probable death and the soundless admonition of it allunless
that at this time of day it was simply it was overwhelmingly too late
He had never at any stage of his queer consciousness admitted the whisper
of such a correction he had never till within these last few months been
so false to his conviction as not to hold that what was to come to him
had time whether _he_ struck himself as having it or not That at last
at last he certainly hadnt it to speak of or had it but in the
scantiest measuresuch soon enough as things went with him became the
inference with which his old obsession had to reckon and this it was not
helped to do by the more and more confirmed appearance that the great
vagueness casting the long shadow in which he had lived had to attest
itself almost no margin left Since it was in Time that he was to have
met his fate so it was in Time that his fate was to have acted and as
he waked up to the sense of no longer being young which was exactly the
sense of being stale just as that in turn was the sense of being weak
he waked up to another matter beside It all hung together they were
subject he and the great vagueness to an equal and indivisible law
When the possibilities themselves had accordingly turned stale when the
secret of the gods had grown faint had perhaps even quite evaporated
that and that only was failure It wouldnt have been failure to be
bankrupt dishonoured pilloried hanged it was failure not to be
anything And so in the dark valley into which his path had taken its
unlookedfor twist he wondered not a little as he groped He didnt
care what awful crash might overtake him with what ignominy or what
monstrosity he might yet be associatedsince he wasnt after all too
utterly old to sufferif it would only be decently proportionate to the
posture he had kept all his life in the threatened presence of it He
had but one desire leftthat he shouldnt have been sold




CHAPTER IV


Then it was that one afternoon while the spring of the year was young
and new she met all in her own way his frankest betrayal of these alarms
He had gone in late to see her but evening hadnt settled and she was
presented to him in that long fresh light of waning April days which
affects us often with a sadness sharper than the greyest hours of autumn
The week had been warm the spring was supposed to have begun early and
May Bartram sat for the first time in the year without a fire a fact
that to Marchers sense gave the scene of which she formed part a
smooth and ultimate look an air of knowing in its immaculate order and
cold meaningless cheer that it would never see a fire again Her own
aspecthe could scarce have said whyintensified this note Almost as
white as wax with the marks and signs in her face as numerous and as
fine as if they had been etched by a needle with soft white draperies
relieved by a faded green scarf on the delicate tone of which the years
had further refined she was the picture of a serene and exquisite but
impenetrable sphinx whose head or indeed all whose person might have
been powdered with silver She was a sphinx yet with her white petals
and green fronds she might have been a lily tooonly an artificial lily
wonderfully imitated and constantly kept without dust or stain though
not exempt from a slight droop and a complexity of faint creases under
some clear glass bell The perfection of household care of high polish
and finish always reigned in her rooms but they now looked most as if
everything had been wound up tucked in put away so that she might sit
with folded hands and with nothing more to do She was out of it to
Marchers vision her work was over she communicated with him as across
some gulf or from some island of rest that she had already reached and
it made him feel strangely abandoned Was itor rather wasnt itthat
if for so long she had been watching with him the answer to their
question must have swum into her ken and taken on its name so that her
occupation was verily gone He had as much as charged her with this in
saying to her many months before that she even then knew something she
was keeping from him It was a point he had never since ventured to
press vaguely fearing as he did that it might become a difference
perhaps a disagreement between them He had in this later time turned
nervous which was what he in all the other years had never been and the
oddity was that his nervousness should have waited till he had begun to
doubt should have held off so long as he was sure There was something
it seemed to him that the wrong word would bring down on his head
something that would so at least ease off his tension But he wanted not
to speak the wrong word that would make everything ugly He wanted the
knowledge he lacked to drop on him if drop it could by its own august
weight If she was to forsake him it was surely for her to take leave
This was why he didnt directly ask her again what she knew but it was
also why approaching the matter from another side he said to her in the
course of his visit What do you regard as the very worst that at this
time of day _can_ happen to me

He had asked her that in the past often enough they had with the odd
irregular rhythm of their intensities and avoidances exchanged ideas
about it and then had seen the ideas washed away by cool intervals
washed like figures traced in seasand It had ever been the mark of
their talk that the oldest allusions in it required but a little
dismissal and reaction to come out again sounding for the hour as new
She could thus at present meet his enquiry quite freshly and patiently
Oh yes Ive repeatedly thought only it always seemed to me of old that
I couldnt quite make up my mind I thought of dreadful things between
which it was difficult to choose and so must you have done

Rather I feel now as if I had scarce done anything else I appear to
myself to have spent my life in thinking of nothing but dreadful things
A great many of them Ive at different times named to you but there were
others I couldnt name

They were too too dreadful

Too too dreadfulsome of them

She looked at him a minute and there came to him as he met it an
inconsequent sense that her eyes when one got their full clearness were
still as beautiful as they had been in youth only beautiful with a
strange cold lighta light that somehow was a part of the effect if it
wasnt rather a part of the cause of the pale hard sweetness of the
season and the hour And yet she said at last there are horrors
weve mentioned

It deepened the strangeness to see her as such a figure in such a
picture talk of horrors but she was to do in a few minutes something
stranger yetthough even of this he was to take the full measure but
afterwardsand the note of it already trembled It was for the matter
of that one of the signs that her eyes were having again the high
flicker of their prime He had to admit however what she said Oh
yes there were times when we did go far He caught himself in the act
of speaking as if it all were over Well he wished it were and the
consummation depended for him clearly more and more on his friend

But she had now a soft smile Oh far

It was oddly ironic Do you mean youre prepared to go further

She was frail and ancient and charming as she continued to look at him
yet it was rather as if she had lost the thread Do you consider that
we went far

Why I thought it the point you were just makingthat we _had_ looked
most things in the face

Including each other She still smiled But youre quite right
Weve had together great imaginations often great fears but some of
them have been unspoken

Then the worstwe havent faced that I _could_ face it I believe if
I knew what you think it I feel he explained as if I had lost my
power to conceive such things And he wondered if he looked as blank as
he sounded Its spent

Then why do you assume she asked that mine isnt

Because youve given me signs to the contrary It isnt a question for
you of conceiving imagining comparing It isnt a question now of
choosing At last he came out with it You know something I dont
Youve shown me that before

These last words had affected her he made out in a moment exceedingly
and she spoke with firmness Ive shown you my dear nothing

He shook his head You cant hide it

Oh oh May Bartram sounded over what she couldnt hide It was almost
a smothered groan

You admitted it months ago when I spoke of it to you as of something
you were afraid I should find out Your answer was that I couldnt that
I wouldnt and I dont pretend I have But you had something therefore
in mind and I see now how it must have been how it still is the
possibility that of all possibilities has settled itself for you as the
worst This he went on is why I appeal to you Im only afraid of
ignorance todayIm not afraid of knowledge And then as for a while
she said nothing What makes me sure is that I see in your face and feel
here in this air and amid these appearances that youre out of it
Youve done Youve had your experience You leave me to my fate

Well she listened motionless and white in her chair as on a decision
to be made so that her manner was fairly an avowal though still with a
small fine inner stiffness an imperfect surrender It _would_ be the
worst she finally let herself say I mean the thing Ive never said

It hushed him a moment More monstrous than all the monstrosities weve
named

More monstrous Isnt that what you sufficiently express she asked
in calling it the worst

Marcher thought Assuredlyif you mean as I do something that
includes all the loss and all the shame that are thinkable

It would if it _should_ happen said May Bartram What were speaking
of remember is only my idea

Its your belief Marcher returned Thats enough for me I feel
your beliefs are right Therefore if having this one you give me no
more light on it you abandon me

No no she repeated Im with youdont you seestill And as
to make it more vivid to him she rose from her chaira movement she
seldom risked in these daysand showed herself all draped and all soft
in her fairness and slimness I havent forsaken you

It was really in its effort against weakness a generous assurance and
had the success of the impulse not happily been great it would have
touched him to pain more than to pleasure But the cold charm in her
eyes had spread as she hovered before him to all the rest of her
person so that it was for the minute almost a recovery of youth He
couldnt pity her for that he could only take her as she showedas
capable even yet of helping him It was as if at the same time her
light might at any instant go out wherefore he must make the most of it
There passed before him with intensity the three or four things he wanted
most to know but the question that came of itself to his lips really
covered the others Then tell me if I shall consciously suffer

She promptly shook her head Never

It confirmed the authority he imputed to her and it produced on him an
extraordinary effect Well whats better than that Do you call that
the worst

You think nothing is better she asked

She seemed to mean something so special that he again sharply wondered
though still with the dawn of a prospect of relief Why not if one
doesnt _know_ After which as their eyes over his question met in a
silence the dawn deepened and something to his purpose came
prodigiously out of her very face His own as he took it in suddenly
flushed to the forehead and he gasped with the force of a perception to
which on the instant everything fitted The sound of his gasp filled
the air then he became articulate I seeif I dont suffer

In her own look however was doubt You see what

Why what you meanwhat youve always meant

She again shook her head What I mean isnt what Ive always meant
Its different

Its something new

She hung back from it a little Something new Its not what you
think I see what you think

His divination drew breath then only her correction might be wrong It
isnt that I _am_ a blockhead he asked between faintness and grimness
It isnt that its all a mistake

A mistake she pityingly echoed _That_ possibility for her he saw
would be monstrous and if she guaranteed him the immunity from pain it
would accordingly not be what she had in mind Oh no she declared
its nothing of that sort Youve been right

Yet he couldnt help asking himself if she werent thus pressed
speaking but to save him It seemed to him he should be most in a hole
if his history should prove all a platitude Are you telling me the
truth so that I shant have been a bigger idiot than I can bear to know
I _havent_ lived with a vain imagination in the most besotted illusion
I havent waited but to see the door shut in my face

She shook her head again However the case stands _that_ isnt the
truth Whatever the reality it _is_ a reality The door isnt shut
The doors open said May Bartram

Then somethings to come

She waited once again always with her cold sweet eyes on him Its
never too late She had with her gliding step diminished the distance
between them and she stood nearer to him close to him a minute as if
still charged with the unspoken Her movement might have been for some
finer emphasis of what she was at once hesitating and deciding to say He
had been standing by the chimneypiece fireless and sparely adorned a
small perfect old French clock and two morsels of rosy Dresden
constituting all its furniture and her hand grasped the shelf while she
kept him waiting grasped it a little as for support and encouragement
She only kept him waiting however that is he only waited It had
become suddenly from her movement and attitude beautiful and vivid to
him that she had something more to give him her wasted face delicately
shone with itit glittered almost as with the white lustre of silver in
her expression She was right incontestably for what he saw in her
face was the truth and strangely without consequence while their talk
of it as dreadful was still in the air she appeared to present it as
inordinately soft This prompting bewilderment made him but gape the
more gratefully for her revelation so that they continued for some
minutes silent her face shining at him her contact imponderably
pressing and his stare all kind but all expectant The end none the
less was that what he had expected failed to come to him Something
else took place instead which seemed to consist at first in the mere
closing of her eyes She gave way at the same instant to a slow fine
shudder and though he remained staringthough he stared in fact but the
harderturned off and regained her chair It was the end of what she
had been intending but it left him thinking only of that

Well you dont say

She had touched in her passage a bell near the chimney and had sunk back
strangely pale Im afraid Im too ill

Too ill to tell me it sprang up sharp to him and almost to his lips
the fear she might die without giving him light He checked himself in
time from so expressing his question but she answered as if she had
heard the words

Dont you knownow

Now She had spoken as if some difference had been made within
the moment But her maid quickly obedient to her bell was already with
them I know nothing And he was afterwards to say to himself that he
must have spoken with odious impatience such an impatience as to show
that supremely disconcerted he washed his hands of the whole question

Oh said May Bartram

Are you in pain he asked as the woman went to her

No said May Bartram

Her maid who had put an arm round her as if to take her to her room
fixed on him eyes that appealingly contradicted her in spite of which
however he showed once more his mystification

What then has happened

She was once more with her companions help on her feet and feeling
withdrawal imposed on him he had blankly found his hat and gloves and
had reached the door Yet he waited for her answer What _was_ to
she said




CHAPTER V


He came back the next day but she was then unable to see him and as it
was literally the first time this had occurred in the long stretch of
their acquaintance he turned away defeated and sore almost angryor
feeling at least that such a break in their custom was really the
beginning of the endand wandered alone with his thoughts especially
with the one he was least able to keep down She was dying and he would
lose her she was dying and his life would end He stopped in the Park
into which he had passed and stared before him at his recurrent doubt
Away from her the doubt pressed again in her presence he had believed
her but as he felt his forlornness he threw himself into the explanation
that nearest at hand had most of a miserable warmth for him and least
of a cold torment She had deceived him to save himto put him off with
something in which he should be able to rest What could the thing that
was to happen to him be after all but just this thing that had began to
happen Her dying her death his consequent solitudethat was what he
had figured as the Beast in the Jungle that was what had been in the lap
of the gods He had had her word for it as he left herwhat else on
earth could she have meant It wasnt a thing of a monstrous order not
a fate rare and distinguished not a stroke of fortune that overwhelmed
and immortalised it had only the stamp of the common doom But poor
Marcher at this hour judged the common doom sufficient It would serve
his turn and even as the consummation of infinite waiting he would bend
his pride to accept it He sat down on a bench in the twilight He
hadnt been a fool Something had _been_ as she had said to come
Before he rose indeed it had quite struck him that the final fact really
matched with the long avenue through which he had had to reach it As
sharing his suspense and as giving herself all giving her life to bring
it to an end she had come with him every step of the way He had lived
by her aid and to leave her behind would be cruelly damnably to miss
her What could be more overwhelming than that

Well he was to know within the week for though she kept him a while at
bay left him restless and wretched during a series of days on each of
which he asked about her only again to have to turn away she ended his
trial by receiving him where she had always received him Yet she had
been brought out at some hazard into the presence of so many of the
things that were consciously vainly half their past and there was
scant service left in the gentleness of her mere desire all too visible
to check his obsession and wind up his long trouble That was clearly
what she wanted the one thing more for her own peace while she could
still put out her hand He was so affected by her state that once
seated by her chair he was moved to let everything go it was she
herself therefore who brought him back took up again before she
dismissed him her last word of the other time She showed how she
wished to leave their business in order Im not sure you understood
Youve nothing to wait for more It _has_ come

Oh how he looked at her Really

Really

The thing that as you said _was_ to

The thing that we began in our youth to watch for

Face to face with her once more he believed her it was a claim to which
he had so abjectly little to oppose You mean that it has come as a
positive definite occurrence with a name and a date

Positive Definite I dont know about the name but oh with a
date

He found himself again too helplessly at sea But come in the
nightcome and passed me by

May Bartram had her strange faint smile Oh no it hasnt passed you
by

But if I havent been aware of it and it hasnt touched me

Ah your not being aware of itand she seemed to hesitate an instant to
deal with thisyour not being aware of it is the strangeness in the
strangeness Its the wonder _of_ the wonder She spoke as with the
softness almost of a sick child yet now at last at the end of all with
the perfect straightness of a sibyl She visibly knew that she knew and
the effect on him was of something coordinate in its high character
with the law that had ruled him It was the true voice of the law so on
her lips would the law itself have sounded It _has_ touched you she
went on It has done its office It has made you all its own

So utterly without my knowing it

So utterly without your knowing it His hand as he leaned to her was
on the arm of her chair and dimly smiling always now she placed her
own on it Its enough if _I_ know it

Oh he confusedly breathed as she herself of late so often had done

What I long ago said is true Youll never know now and I think you
ought to be content Youve _had_ it said May Bartram

But had what

Why what was to have marked you out The proof of your law It has
acted Im too glad she then bravely added to have been able to see
what its _not_

He continued to attach his eyes to her and with the sense that it was
all beyond him and that _she_ was too he would still have sharply
challenged her hadnt he so felt it an abuse of her weakness to do more
than take devoutly what she gave him take it hushed as to a revelation
If he did speak it was out of the foreknowledge of his loneliness to
come If youre glad of what its not it might then have been worse

She turned her eyes away she looked straight before her with which
after a moment Well you know our fears

He wondered Its something then we never feared

On this slowly she turned to him Did we ever dream with all our
dreams that we should sit and talk of it thus

He tried for a little to make out that they had but it was as if their
dreams numberless enough were in solution in some thick cold mist
through which thought lost itself It might have been that we couldnt
talk

Wellshe did her best for himnot from this side This you see
she said is the _other_ side

I think poor Marcher returned that all sides are the same to me
Then however as she gently shook her head in correction We mightnt
as it were have got across

To where we areno Were _here_she made her weak emphasis

And much good does it do us was her friends frank comment

It does us the good it can It does us the good that _it_ isnt here
Its past Its behind said May Bartram Before but her voice
dropped

He had got up not to tire her but it was hard to combat his yearning
She after all told him nothing but that his light had failedwhich he
knew well enough without her Before he blankly echoed

Before you see it was always to _come_ That kept it present

Oh I dont care what comes now Besides Marcher added it seems to
me I liked it better present as you say than I can like it absent with
_your_ absence

Oh mineand her pale hands made light of it

With the absence of everything He had a dreadful sense of standing
there before her forso far as anything but this proved this bottomless
drop was concernedthe last time of their life It rested on him with a
weight he felt he could scarce bear and this weight it apparently was
that still pressed out what remained in him of speakable protest I
believe you but I cant begin to pretend I understand _Nothing_ for
me is past nothing _will_ pass till I pass myself which I pray my
stars may be as soon as possible Say however he added that Ive
eaten my cake as you contend to the last crumbhow can the thing Ive
never felt at all be the thing I was marked out to feel

She met him perhaps less directly but she met him unperturbed You
take your feelings for granted You were to suffer your fate That
was not necessarily to know it

How in the worldwhen what is such knowledge but suffering

She looked up at him a while in silence Noyou dont understand

I suffer said John Marcher

Dont dont

How can I help at least _that_

_Dont_ May Bartram repeated

She spoke it in a tone so special in spite of her weakness that he
stared an instantstared as if some light hitherto hidden had
shimmered across his vision Darkness again closed over it but the
gleam had already become for him an idea Because I havent the
right

Dont _know_when you neednt she mercifully urged You needntfor
we shouldnt

Shouldnt If he could but know what she meant

No its too much

Too much he still asked but with a mystification that was the next
moment of a sudden to give way Her words if they meant something
affected him in this lightthe light also of her wasted faceas meaning
_all_ and the sense of what knowledge had been for herself came over him
with a rush which broke through into a question Is it of that then
youre dying

She but watched him gravely at first as to see with this where he
was and she might have seen something or feared something that moved her
sympathy I would live for you stillif I could Her eyes closed for
a little as if withdrawn into herself she were for a last time trying
But I cant she said as she raised them again to take leave of him

She couldnt indeed as but too promptly and sharply appeared and he had
no vision of her after this that was anything but darkness and doom They
had parted for ever in that strange talk access to her chamber of pain
rigidly guarded was almost wholly forbidden him he was feeling now
moreover in the face of doctors nurses the two or three relatives
attracted doubtless by the presumption of what she had to leave how
few were the rights as they were called in such cases that he had to
put forward and how odd it might even seem that their intimacy shouldnt
have given him more of them The stupidest fourth cousin had more even
though she had been nothing in such a persons life She had been a
feature of features in _his_ for what else was it to have been so
indispensable Strange beyond saying were the ways of existence
baffling for him the anomaly of his lack as he felt it to be of
producible claim A woman might have been as it were everything to
him and it might yet present him in no connexion that any one seemed
held to recognise If this was the case in these closing weeks it was
the case more sharply on the occasion of the last offices rendered in
the great grey London cemetery to what had been mortal to what had been
precious in his friend The concourse at her grave was not numerous
but he saw himself treated as scarce more nearly concerned with it than
if there had been a thousand others He was in short from this moment
face to face with the fact that he was to profit extraordinarily little
by the interest May Bartram had taken in him He couldnt quite have
said what he expected but he hadnt surely expected this approach to a
double privation Not only had her interest failed him but he seemed to
feel himself unattendedand for a reason he couldnt seizeby the
distinction the dignity the propriety if nothing else of the man
markedly bereaved It was as if in the view of society he had not
_been_ markedly bereaved as if there still failed some sign or proof of
it and as if none the less his character could never be affirmed nor the
deficiency ever made up There were moments as the weeks went by when he
would have liked by some almost aggressive act to take his stand on the
intimacy of his loss in order that it _might_ be questioned and his
retort to the relief of his spirit so recorded but the moments of an
irritation more helpless followed fast on these the moments during
which turning things over with a good conscience but with a bare
horizon he found himself wondering if he oughtnt to have begun so to
speak further back

He found himself wondering indeed at many things and this last
speculation had others to keep it company What could he have done
after all in her lifetime without giving them both as it were away
He couldnt have made known she was watching him for that would have
published the superstition of the Beast This was what closed his mouth
nownow that the Jungle had been thrashed to vacancy and that the Beast
had stolen away It sounded too foolish and too flat the difference for
him in this particular the extinction in his life of the element of
suspense was such as in fact to surprise him He could scarce have said
what the effect resembled the abrupt cessation the positive
prohibition of music perhaps more than anything else in some place all
adjusted and all accustomed to sonority and to attention If he could at
any rate have conceived lifting the veil from his image at some moment of
the past what had he done after all if not lift it to _her_ so to do
this today to talk to people at large of the Jungle cleared and confide
to them that he now felt it as safe would have been not only to see them
listen as to a goodwifes tale but really to hear himself tell one What
it presently came to in truth was that poor Marcher waded through his
beaten grass where no life stirred where no breath sounded where no
evil eye seemed to gleam from a possible lair very much as if vaguely
looking for the Beast and still more as if acutely missing it He
walked about in an existence that had grown strangely more spacious and
stopping fitfully in places where the undergrowth of life struck him as
closer asked himself yearningly wondered secretly and sorely if it
would have lurked here or there It would have at all events sprung
what was at least complete was his belief in the truth itself of the
assurance given him The change from his old sense to his new was
absolute and final what was to happen had so absolutely and finally
happened that he was as little able to know a fear for his future as to
know a hope so absent in short was any question of anything still to
come He was to live entirely with the other question that of his
unidentified past that of his having to see his fortune impenetrably
muffled and masked

The torment of this vision became then his occupation he couldnt
perhaps have consented to live but for the possibility of guessing She
had told him his friend not to guess she had forbidden him so far as
he might to know and she had even in a sort denied the power in him to
learn which were so many things precisely to deprive him of rest It
wasnt that he wanted he argued for fairness that anything past and
done should repeat itself it was only that he shouldnt as an
anticlimax have been taken sleeping so sound as not to be able to win
back by an effort of thought the lost stuff of consciousness He
declared to himself at moments that he would either win it back or have
done with consciousness for ever he made this idea his one motive in
fine made it so much his passion that none other to compare with it
seemed ever to have touched him The lost stuff of consciousness became
thus for him as a strayed or stolen child to an unappeasable father he
hunted it up and down very much as if he were knocking at doors and
enquiring of the police This was the spirit in which inevitably he
set himself to travel he started on a journey that was to be as long as
he could make it it danced before him that as the other side of the
globe couldnt possibly have less to say to him it might by a
possibility of suggestion have more Before he quitted London however
he made a pilgrimage to May Bartrams grave took his way to it through
the endless avenues of the grim suburban necropolis sought it out in the
wilderness of tombs and though he had come but for the renewal of the
act of farewell found himself when he had at last stood by it beguiled
into long intensities He stood for an hour powerless to turn away and
yet powerless to penetrate the darkness of death fixing with his eyes
her inscribed name and date beating his forehead against the fact of the
secret they kept drawing his breath while he waited as if some sense
would in pity of him rise from the stones He kneeled on the stones
however in vain they kept what they concealed and if the face of the
tomb did become a face for him it was because her two names became a pair
of eyes that didnt know him He gave them a last long look but no
palest light broke




CHAPTER VI


He stayed away after this for a year he visited the depths of Asia
spending himself on scenes of romantic interest of superlative sanctity
but what was present to him everywhere was that for a man who had known
what _he_ had known the world was vulgar and vain The state of mind in
which he had lived for so many years shone out to him in reflexion as a
light that coloured and refined a light beside which the glow of the
East was garish cheap and thin The terrible truth was that he had
lostwith everything elsea distinction as well the things he saw
couldnt help being common when he had become common to look at them He
was simply now one of them himselfhe was in the dust without a peg for
the sense of difference and there were hours when before the temples of
gods and the sepulchres of kings his spirit turned for nobleness of
association to the barely discriminated slab in the London suburb That
had become for him and more intensely with time and distance his one
witness of a past glory It was all that was left to him for proof or
pride yet the past glories of Pharaohs were nothing to him as he thought
of it Small wonder then that he came back to it on the morrow of his
return He was drawn there this time as irresistibly as the other yet
with a confidence almost that was doubtless the effect of the many
months that had elapsed He had lived in spite of himself into his
change of feeling and in wandering over the earth had wandered as might
be said from the circumference to the centre of his desert He had
settled to his safety and accepted perforce his extinction figuring to
himself with some colour in the likeness of certain little old men he
remembered to have seen of whom all meagre and wizened as they might
look it was related that they had in their time fought twenty duels or
been loved by ten princesses They indeed had been wondrous for others
while he was but wondrous for himself which however was exactly the
cause of his haste to renew the wonder by getting back as he might put
it into his own presence That had quickened his steps and checked his
delay If his visit was prompt it was because he had been separated so
long from the part of himself that alone he now valued

Its accordingly not false to say that he reached his goal with a certain
elation and stood there again with a certain assurance The creature
beneath the sod knew of his rare experience so that strangely now the
place had lost for him its mere blankness of expression It met him in
mildnessnot as before in mockery it wore for him the air of
conscious greeting that we find after absence in things that have
closely belonged to us and which seem to confess of themselves to the
connexion The plot of ground the graven tablet the tended flowers
affected him so as belonging to him that he resembled for the hour a
contented landlord reviewing a piece of property Whatever had
happenedwell had happened He had not come back this time with the
vanity of that question his former worrying What _what_ now
practically so spent Yet he would none the less never again so cut
himself off from the spot he would come back to it every month for if
he did nothing else by its aid he at least held up his head It thus
grew for him in the oddest way a positive resource he carried out his
idea of periodical returns which took their place at last among the most
inveterate of his habits What it all amounted to oddly enough was
that in his finally so simplified world this garden of death gave him the
few square feet of earth on which he could still most live It was as
if being nothing anywhere else for any one nothing even for himself he
were just everything here and if not for a crowd of witnesses or indeed
for any witness but John Marcher then by clear right of the register
that he could scan like an open page The open page was the tomb of his
friend and there were the facts of the past there the truth of his
life there the backward reaches in which he could lose himself He did
this from time to time with such effect that he seemed to wander through
the old years with his hand in the arm of a companion who was in the
most extraordinary manner his other his younger self and to wander
which was more extraordinary yet round and round a third presencenot
wandering she but stationary still whose eyes turning with his
revolution never ceased to follow him and whose seat was his point so
to speak of orientation Thus in short he settled to livefeeding all
on the sense that he once _had_ lived and dependent on it not alone for
a support but for an identity

It sufficed him in its way for months and the year elapsed it would
doubtless even have carried him further but for an accident
superficially slight which moved him quite in another direction with a
force beyond any of his impressions of Egypt or of India It was a thing
of the merest chancethe turn as he afterwards felt of a hair though
he was indeed to live to believe that if light hadnt come to him in this
particular fashion it would still have come in another He was to live
to believe this I say though he was not to live I may not less
definitely mention to do much else We allow him at any rate the
benefit of the conviction struggling up for him at the end that
whatever might have happened or not happened he would have come round of
himself to the light The incident of an autumn day had put the match to
the train laid from of old by his misery With the light before him he
knew that even of late his ache had only been smothered It was
strangely drugged but it throbbed at the touch it began to bleed And
the touch in the event was the face of a fellowmortal This face one
grey afternoon when the leaves were thick in the alleys looked into
Marchers own at the cemetery with an expression like the cut of a
blade He felt it that is so deep down that he winced at the steady
thrust The person who so mutely assaulted him was a figure he had
noticed on reaching his own goal absorbed by a grave a short distance
away a grave apparently fresh so that the emotion of the visitor would
probably match it for frankness This fact alone forbade further
attention though during the time he stayed he remained vaguely conscious
of his neighbour a middleaged man apparently in mourning whose bowed
back among the clustered monuments and mortuary yews was constantly
presented Marchers theory that these were elements in contact with
which he himself revived had suffered on this occasion it may be
granted a marked an excessive check The autumn day was dire for him
as none had recently been and he rested with a heaviness he had not yet
known on the low stone table that bore May Bartrams name He rested
without power to move as if some spring in him some spell vouchsafed
had suddenly been broken for ever If he could have done that moment as
he wanted he would simply have stretched himself on the slab that was
ready to take him treating it as a place prepared to receive his last
sleep What in all the wide world had he now to keep awake for He
stared before him with the question and it was then that as one of the
cemetery walks passed near him he caught the shock of the face

His neighbour at the other grave had withdrawn as he himself with force
enough in him would have done by now and was advancing along the path
on his way to one of the gates This brought him close and his pace
was slow so thatand all the more as there was a kind of hunger in his
lookthe two men were for a minute directly confronted Marcher knew
him at once for one of the deeply strickena perception so sharp that
nothing else in the picture comparatively lived neither his dress his
age nor his presumable character and class nothing lived but the deep
ravage of the features that he showed He _showed_ themthat was the
point he was moved as he passed by some impulse that was either a
signal for sympathy or more possibly a challenge to an opposed sorrow
He might already have been aware of our friend might at some previous
hour have noticed in him the smooth habit of the scene with which the
state of his own senses so scantly consorted and might thereby have been
stirred as by an overt discord What Marcher was at all events conscious
of was in the first place that the image of scarred passion presented to
him was conscious tooof something that profaned the air and in the
second that roused startled shocked he was yet the next moment
looking after it as it went with envy The most extraordinary thing
that had happened to himthough he had given that name to other matters
as welltook place after his immediate vague stare as a consequence of
this impression The stranger passed but the raw glare of his grief
remained making our friend wonder in pity what wrong what wound it
expressed what injury not to be healed What had the man _had_ to make
him by the loss of it so bleed and yet live

Somethingand this reached him with a pangthat _he_ John Marcher
hadnt the proof of which was precisely John Marchers arid end No
passion had ever touched him for this was what passion meant he had
survived and maundered and pined but where had been _his_ deep ravage
The extraordinary thing we speak of was the sudden rush of the result of
this question The sight that had just met his eyes named to him as in
letters of quick flame something he had utterly insanely missed and
what he had missed made these things a train of fire made them mark
themselves in an anguish of inward throbs He had seen _outside_ of his
life not learned it within the way a woman was mourned when she had
been loved for herself such was the force of his conviction of the
meaning of the strangers face which still flared for him as a smoky
torch It hadnt come to him the knowledge on the wings of experience
it had brushed him jostled him upset him with the disrespect of
chance the insolence of accident Now that the illumination had begun
however it blazed to the zenith and what he presently stood there
gazing at was the sounded void of his life He gazed he drew breath in
pain he turned in his dismay and turning he had before him in sharper
incision than ever the open page of his story The name on the table
smote him as the passage of his neighbour had done and what it said to
him full in the face was that she was what he had missed This was the
awful thought the answer to all the past the vision at the dread
clearness of which he turned as cold as the stone beneath him Everything
fell together confessed explained overwhelmed leaving him most of all
stupefied at the blindness he had cherished The fate he had been marked
for he had met with a vengeancehe had emptied the cup to the lees he
had been the man of his time _the_ man to whom nothing on earth was to
have happened That was the rare strokethat was his visitation So he
saw it as we say in pale horror while the pieces fitted and fitted So
_she_ had seen it while he didnt and so she served at this hour to
drive the truth home It was the truth vivid and monstrous that all
the while he had waited the wait was itself his portion This the
companion of his vigil had at a given moment made out and she had then
offered him the chance to baffle his doom Ones doom however was
never baffled and on the day she told him his own had come down she had
seen him but stupidly stare at the escape she offered him

The escape would have been to love her then _then_ he would have lived
_She_ had livedwho could say now with what passionsince she had
loved him for himself whereas he had never thought of her ah how it
hugely glared at him but in the chill of his egotism and the light of
her use Her spoken words came back to himthe chain stretched and
stretched The Beast had lurked indeed and the Beast at its hour had
sprung it had sprung in that twilight of the cold April when pale ill
wasted but all beautiful and perhaps even then recoverable she had
risen from her chair to stand before him and let him imaginably guess It
had sprung as he didnt guess it had sprung as she hopelessly turned
from him and the mark by the time he left her had fallen where it
_was_ to fall He had justified his fear and achieved his fate he had
failed with the last exactitude of all he was to fail of and a moan
now rose to his lips as he remembered she had prayed he mightnt know
This horror of waking_this_ was knowledge knowledge under the breath
of which the very tears in his eyes seemed to freeze Through them none
the less he tried to fix it and hold it he kept it there before him so
that he might feel the pain That at least belated and bitter had
something of the taste of life But the bitterness suddenly sickened
him and it was as if horribly he saw in the truth in the cruelty of
his image what had been appointed and done He saw the Jungle of his
life and saw the lurking Beast then while he looked perceived it as
by a stir of the air rise huge and hideous for the leap that was to
settle him His eyes darkenedit was close and instinctively turning
in his hallucination to avoid it he flung himself face down on the
tomb

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergnetfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
