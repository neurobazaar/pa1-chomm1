PART I



CHAPTER ITHE BROWN FAMILY

 Im the Poet of White Horse Vale sir
 With liberal notions under my capBallad

The Browns have become illustrious by the pen of Thackeray and the
pencil of Doyle within the memory of the young gentlemen who are now
matriculating at the universities Notwithstanding the wellmerited but
late fame which has now fallen upon them any one at all acquainted with
the family must feel that much has yet to be written and said before the
British nation will be properly sensible of how much of its greatness it
owes to the Browns For centuries in their quiet dogged homespun way
they have been subduing the earth in most English counties and leaving
their mark in American forests and Australian uplands Wherever the
fleets and armies of England have won renown there stalwart sons of the
Browns have done yeomens work With the yew bow and clothyard shaft at
Cressy and Agincourtwith the brown bill and pike under the brave
Lord Willoughbywith culverin and demiculverin against Spaniards and
Dutchmenwith handgrenade and sabre and musket and bayonet under
Rodney and St Vincent Wolfe and Moore Nelson and Wellington they
have carried their lives in their hands getting hard knocks and hard
work in plentywhich was on the whole what they looked for and the
best thing for themand little praise or pudding which indeed they
and most of us are better without Talbots and Stanleys St Maurs
and suchlike folk have led armies and made laws time out of mind but
those noble families would be somewhat astoundedif the accounts ever
came to be fairly takento find how small their work for England has
been by the side of that of the Browns

These latter indeed have until the present generation rarely been
sung by poet or chronicled by sage They have wanted their sacer vates
having been too solid to rise to the top by themselves and not having
been largely gifted with the talent of catching hold of and holding on
tight to whatever good things happened to be goingthe foundation of
the fortunes of so many noble families But the world goes on its way
and the wheel turns and the wrongs of the Browns like other wrongs
seem in a fair way to get righted And this present writer having for
many years of his life been a devout Brownworshipper and moreover
having the honour of being nearly connected with an eminently
respectable branch of the great Brown family is anxious so far as in
him lies to help the wheel over and throw his stone on to the pile

However gentle reader or simple reader whichever you may be lest you
should be led to waste your precious time upon these pages I make so
bold as at once to tell you the sort of folk youll have to meet and put
up with if you and I are to jog on comfortably together You shall hear
at once what sort of folk the Browns areat least my branch of them
and then if you dont like the sort why cut the concern at once and
let you and I cry quits before either of us can grumble at the other

In the first place the Browns are a fighting family One may question
their wisdom or wit or beauty but about their fight there can be no
question Wherever hard knocks of any kind visible or invisible are
going there the Brown who is nearest must shove in his carcass
And these carcasses for the most part answer very well to the
characteristic propensity they are a squareheaded and snakenecked
generation broad in the shoulder deep in the chest and thin in
the flank carrying no lumber Then for clanship they are as bad as
Highlanders it is amazing the belief they have in one another
With them there is nothing like the Browns to the third and fourth
generation Blood is thicker than water is one of their pet sayings
They cant be happy unless they are always meeting one another Never
were such people for family gatherings which were you a stranger or
sensitive you might think had better not have been gathered together
For during the whole time of their being together they luxuriate in
telling one another their minds on whatever subject turns up and their
minds are wonderfully antagonistic and all their opinions are downright
beliefs Till youve been among them some time and understand them you
cant think but that they are quarrelling Not a bit of it They love
and respect one another ten times the more after a good set family
arguing bout and go back one to his curacy another to his chambers
and another to his regiment freshened for work and more than ever
convinced that the Browns are the height of company

This family training too combined with their turn for combativeness
makes them eminently quixotic They cant let anything alone which they
think going wrong They must speak their mind about it annoying all
easygoing folk and spend their time and money in having a tinker at
it however hopeless the job It is an impossibility to a Brown to leave
the most disreputable lame dog on the other side of a stile Most other
folk get tired of such work The old Browns with red faces white
whiskers and bald heads go on believing and fighting to a green old
age They have always a crotchet going till the old man with the scythe
reaps and garners them away for troublesome old boys as they are

And the most provoking thing is that no failures knock them up or make
them hold their hands or think you or me or other sane people in
the right Failures slide off them like July rain off a ducks back
feathers Jem and his whole family turn out bad and cheat them one
week and the next they are doing the same thing for Jack and when he
goes to the treadmill and his wife and children to the workhouse they
will be on the lookout for Bill to take his place

However it is time for us to get from the general to the particular
so leaving the great army of Browns who are scattered over the whole
empire on which the sun never sets and whose general diffusion I take
to be the chief cause of that empires stability let us at once fix our
attention upon the small nest of Browns in which our hero was hatched
and which dwelt in that portion of the royal county of Berks which is
called the Vale of White Horse

Most of you have probably travelled down the Great Western Railway as
far as Swindon Those of you who did so with their eyes open have been
aware soon after leaving the Didcot station of a fine range of chalk
hills running parallel with the railway on the lefthand side as you go
down and distant some two or three miles more or less from the line
The highest point in the range is the White Horse Hill which you come
in front of just before you stop at the Shrivenham station If you love
English scenery and have a few hours to spare you cant do better
the next time you pass than stop at the Farringdon Road or Shrivenham
station and make your way to that highest point And those who care for
the vague old stories that haunt countrysides all about England will
not if they are wise be content with only a few hours stay for
glorious as the view is the neighbourhood is yet more interesting
for its relics of bygone times I only know two English neighbourhoods
thoroughly and in each within a circle of five miles there is enough
of interest and beauty to last any reasonable man his life I believe
this to be the case almost throughout the country but each has a
special attraction and none can be richer than the one I am speaking of
and going to introduce you to very particularly for on this subject I
must be prosy so those that dont care for England in detail may skip
the chapter

O young England young England you who are born into these racing
railroad times when theres a Great Exhibition or some monster sight
every year and you can get over a couple of thousand miles of ground
for three pound ten in a fiveweeks holiday why dont you know more of
your own birthplaces Youre all in the ends of the earth it seems to
me as soon as you get your necks out of the educational collar for
midsummer holidays long vacations or what notgoing round Ireland
with a return ticket in a fortnight dropping your copies of Tennyson
on the tops of Swiss mountains or pulling down the Danube in Oxford
racing boats And when you get home for a quiet fortnight you turn the
steam off and lie on your backs in the paternal garden surrounded by
the last batch of books from Mudies library and half bored to death
Well well I know it has its good side You all patter French more or
less and perhaps German you have seen men and cities no doubt and
have your opinions such as they are about schools of painting high
art and all that have seen the pictures of Dresden and the Louvre
and know the taste of sour krout All I say is you dont know your own
lanes and woods and fields Though you may be chokefull of science not
one in twenty of you knows where to find the woodsorrel or beeorchis
which grow in the next wood or on the down three miles off or what the
bogbean and woodsage are good for And as for the country legends
the stories of the old gableended farmhouses the place where the last
skirmish was fought in the civil wars where the parish butts stood
where the last highwayman turned to bay where the last ghost was laid
by the parson theyre gone out of date altogether

Now in my time when we got home by the old coach which put us down at
the crossroads with our boxes the first day of the holidays and had
been driven off by the family coachman singing Dulce Domum at the top
of our voices there we were fixtures till black Monday came round We
had to cut out our own amusements within a walk or a ride of home And
so we got to know all the country folk and their ways and songs and
stories by heart and went over the fields and woods and hills again
and again till we made friends of them all We were Berkshire or
Gloucestershire or Yorkshire boys and youre young cosmopolites
belonging to all countries and no countries No doubt its all right I
dare say it is This is the day of large views and glorious humanity
and all that but I wish backsword play hadnt gone out in the Vale of
White Horse and that that confounded Great Western hadnt carried away
Alfreds Hill to make an embankment

But to return to the said Vale of White Horse the country in which the
first scenes of this true and interesting story are laid As I said the
Great Western now runs right through it and it is a land of large rich
pastures bounded by oxfences and covered with fine hedgerow timber
with here and there a nice little gorse or spinney where abideth poor
Charley having no other cover to which to betake himself for miles and
miles when pushed out some fine November morning by the old Berkshire
Those who have been there and well mounted only know how he and the
stanch little pack who dash after himheads high and sterns low with
a breasthigh scentcan consume the ground at such times There being
little ploughland and few woods the Vale is only an average sporting
country except for hunting The villages are straggling queer
oldfashioned places the houses being dropped down without the least
regularity in nooks and outoftheway corners by the sides of shadowy
lanes and footpaths each with its patch of garden They are built
chiefly of good gray stone and thatched though I see that within the
last year or two the redbrick cottages are multiplying for the Vale is
beginning to manufacture largely both bricks and tiles There are lots
of waste ground by the side of the roads in every village amounting
often to village greens where feed the pigs and ganders of the people
and these roads are oldfashioned homely roads very dirty and badly
made and hardly endurable in winter but still pleasant jogtrot roads
running through the great pasturelands dotted here and there with
little clumps of thorns where the sleek kine are feeding with no fence
on either side of them and a gate at the end of each field which makes
you get out of your gig if you keep one and gives you a chance of
looking about you every quarter of a mile

One of the moralists whom we sat under in our youthwas it the great
Richard Swiveller or Mr Stigginssays We are born in a vale and
must take the consequences of being found in such a situation These
consequences I for one am ready to encounter I pity people who
werent born in a vale I dont mean a flat country but a valethat
is a flat country bounded by hills The having your hill always in view
if you choose to turn towards himthats the essence of a vale There
he is for ever in the distance your friend and companion You never
lose him as you do in hilly districts

And then what a hill is the White Horse Hill There it stands right up
above all the rest nine hundred feet above the sea and the boldest
bravest shape for a chalk hill that you ever saw Let us go up to the
top of him and see what is to be found there Ay you may well wonder
and think it odd you never heard of this before but wonder or not as
you please there are hundreds of such things lying about England which
wiser folk than you know nothing of and care nothing for Yes its a
magnificent Roman camp and no mistake with gates and ditch and mounds
all as complete as it was twenty years after the strong old rogues left
it Here right up on the highest point from which they say you can see
eleven counties they trenched round all the tableland some twelve or
fourteen acres as was their custom for they couldnt bear anybody to
overlook them and made their eyrie The ground falls away rapidly on
all sides Was there ever such turf in the whole world You sink up to
your ankles at every step and yet the spring of it is delicious There
is always a breeze in the camp as it is called and here it lies
just as the Romans left it except that cairn on the east side left by
her Majestys corps of sappers and miners the other day when they and
the engineer officer had finished their sojourn there and their surveys
for the ordnance map of Berkshire It is altogether a place that you
wont forget a place to open a mans soul and make him prophesy as
he looks down on that great Vale spread out as the garden of the Lord
before him and wave on wave of the mysterious downs behind and to the
right and left the chalk hills running away into the distance along
which he can trace for miles the old Roman road the Ridgeway the
Rudge as the country folk call it keeping straight along the highest
back of the hillssuch a place as Balak brought Balaam to and told him
to prophesy against the people in the valley beneath And he could not
neither shall you for they are a people of the Lord who abide there

And now we leave the camp and descend towards the west and are on
the Ashdown We are treading on heroes It is sacred ground for
Englishmenmore sacred than all but one or two fields where their bones
lie whitening For this is the actual place where our Alfred won his
great battle the battle of Ashdown Aescendum in the chroniclers
which broke the Danish power and made England a Christian land The
Danes held the camp and the slope where we are standingthe whole crown
of the hill in fact The heathen had beforehand seized the higher
ground as old Asser says having wasted everything behind them from
London and being just ready to burst down on the fair Vale Alfreds
own birthplace and heritage And up the heights came the Saxons as
they did at the Alma The Christians led up their line from the
lower ground There stood also on that same spot a single thorntree
marvellous stumpy which we ourselves with our very own eyes have
seen Bless the old chronicler Does he think nobody ever saw the
single thorntree but himself Why there it stands to this very day
just on the edge of the slope and I saw it not three weeks sincean
old single thorntree marvellous stumpy At least if it isnt the
same tree it ought to have been for its just in the place where the
battle must have been won or lostaround which as I was saying the
two lines of foemen came together in battle with a huge shout And in
this place one of the two kings of the heathen and five of his earls
fell down and died and many thousands of the heathen side in the same
place  After which crowning mercy the pious king that there might
never be wanting a sign and a memorial to the countryside carved out
on the northern side of the chalk hill under the camp where it is
almost precipitous the great Saxon White Horse which he who will may
see from the railway and which gives its name to the Vale over which
it has looked these thousand years and more

Right down below the White Horse is a curious deep and broad gully
called the Manger into one side of which the hills fall with a series
of the most lovely sweeping curves known as the Giants Stairs They
are not a bit like stairs but I never saw anything like them anywhere
else with their short green turf and tender bluebells and gossamer
and thistledown gleaming in the sun and the sheeppaths running along
their sides like ruled lines

The other side of the Manger is formed by the Dragons Hill a curious
little round selfconfident fellow thrown forward from the range
utterly unlike everything round him On this hill some deliverer of
mankindSt George the country folk used to tell mekilled a dragon
Whether it were St George I cannot say but surely a dragon was killed
there for you may see the marks yet where his blood ran down and more
by token the place where it ran down is the easiest way up the hillside

Passing along the Ridgeway to the west for about a mile we come to a
little clump of young beech and firs with a growth of thorn and privet
underwood Here you may find nests of the strong down partridge and
peewit but take care that the keeper isnt down upon you and in the
middle of it is an old cromlech a huge flat stone raised on seven or
eight others and led up to by a path with large single stones set up
on each side This is Wayland Smiths cave a place of classic fame now
but as Sir Walter has touched it I may as well let it alone and refer
you to Kenilworth for the legend

The thick deep wood which you see in the hollow about a mile off
surrounds Ashdown Park built by Inigo Jones Four broad alleys are cut
through the wood from circumference to centre and each leads to one
face of the house The mystery of the downs hangs about house and wood
as they stand there alone so unlike all around with the green slopes
studded with great stones just about this part stretching away on all
sides It was a wise Lord Craven I think who pitched his tent there

Passing along the Ridgeway to the east we soon come to cultivated land
The downs strictly so called are no more Lincolnshire farmers have
been imported and the long fresh slopes are sheepwalks no more but
grow famous turnips and barley One of these improvers lives over there
at the Seven Barrows farm another mystery of the great downs There
are the barrows still solemn and silent like ships in the calm sea
the sepulchres of some sons of men But of whom It is three miles from
the White Horsetoo far for the slain of Ashdown to be buried there
Who shall say what heroes are waiting there But we must get down into
the Vale again and so away by the Great Western Railway to town
for time and the printers devil press and it is a terrible long and
slippery descent and a shocking bad road At the bottom however there
is a pleasant public whereat we must really take a modest quencher for
the down air is provocative of thirst So we pull up under an old oak
which stands before the door

What is the name of your hill landlord

Blawing STWUN Hill sir to be sure

READER Stuym

AUTHOR Stone stupidthe Blowing Stone

And of your house I cant make out the sign

Blawing Stwun sir says the landlord pouring out his old ale from a
Toby Philpot jug with a melodious crash into the longnecked glass

What queer names say we sighing at the end of our draught and
holding out the glass to be replenished

Beant queer at all as I can see sir says mine host handing back
our glass seeing as this here is the Blawing Stwun his self putting
his hand on a square lump of stone some three feet and a half high
perforated with two or three queer holes like petrified antediluvian
ratholes which lies there close under the oak under our very nose We
are more than ever puzzled and drink our second glass of ale wondering
what will come next Like to hear un sir says mine host setting
down Toby Philpot on the tray and resting both hands on the Stwun We
are ready for anything and he without waiting for a reply applies his
mouth to one of the ratholes Something must come of it if he doesnt
burst Good heavens I hope he has no apoplectic tendencies Yes here
it comes sure enough a gruesome sound between a moan and a roar and
spreads itself away over the valley and up the hillside and into the
woods at the back of the house a ghostlike awful voice Um do say
sir says mine host rising purplefaced while the moan is still
coming out of the Stwun as they used in old times to warn the
countryside by blawing the Stwun when the enemy was acomin and as
how folks could make un heered then for seven mile round leastways so
Ive heered Lawyer Smith say and he knows a smart sight about them old
times We can hardly swallow Lawyer Smiths seven miles but could the
blowing of the stone have been a summons a sort of sending the fiery
cross round the neighbourhood in the old times What old times Who
knows We pay for our beer and are thankful

And whats the name of the village just below landlord

Kingstone Lisle sir

Fine plantations youve got here

Yes sir the Squires mazing fond of trees and such like

No wonder Hes got some real beauties to be fond of Goodday
landlord

Goodday sir and a pleasant ride to ee

And now my boys you whom I want to get for readers have you had
enough Will you give in at once and say youre convinced and let me
begin my story or will you have more of it Remember Ive only been
over a little bit of the hillside yetwhat you could ride round easily
on your ponies in an hour Im only just come down into the Vale by
Blowing Stone Hill and if I once begin about the Vale whats to stop
me Youll have to hear all about Wantage the birthplace of Alfred and
Farringdon which held out so long for Charles the First the Vale was
near Oxford and dreadfully malignantfull of Throgmortons Puseys
and Pyes and such like and their brawny retainers Did you ever read
Thomas Ingoldsbys Legend of Hamilton Tighe If you havent you ought
to have Well Farringdon is where he lived before he went to sea
his real name was Hamden Pye and the Pyes were the great folk at
Farringdon Then theres Pusey Youve heard of the Pusey horn which
King Canute gave to the Puseys of that day and which the gallant old
squire lately gone to his rest whom Berkshire freeholders turned out
of last Parliament to their eternal disgrace for voting according to
his conscience used to bring out on high days holidays and bonfire
nights And the splendid old cross church at Uffington the Uffingas
town How the whole countryside teems with Saxon names and memories
And the old moated grange at Compton nestled close under the hillside
where twenty Marianas may have lived with its bright waterlilies
in the moat and its yew walk the cloister walk and its peerless
terraced gardens There they all are and twenty things beside for
those who care about them and have eyes And these are the sort of
things you may find I believe every one of you in any common English
country neighbourhood

Will you look for them under your own noses or will you not Well
well Ive done what I can to make you and if you will go gadding over
half Europe now every holidays I cant help it I was born and bred
a westcountry man thank God a Wessex man a citizen of the noblest
Saxon kingdom of Wessex a regular Angular Saxon the very soul of me
adscriptus glebae Theres nothing like the old countryside for me
and no music like the twang of the real old Saxon tongue as one gets
it fresh from the veritable chaw in the White Horse Vale and I say with
Gaarge Ridler the old westcountry yeoman

 Throo aall the waarld owld Gaarge would bwoast
 Commend me to merry owld England mwoast
 While vools gwoes prating vur and nigh
 We stwops at whum my dog and I

Here at any rate lived and stopped at home Squire Brown JP for the
county of Berks in a village near the foot of the White Horse range
And here he dealt out justice and mercy in a rough way and begat sons
and daughters and hunted the fox and grumbled at the badness of
the roads and the times And his wife dealt out stockings and calico
shirts and smock frocks and comforting drinks to the old folks with
the rheumatiz and good counsel to all and kept the coal and clothes
clubs going for yuletide when the bands of mummers came round
dressed out in ribbons and coloured paper caps and stamped round the
Squires kitchen repeating in true singsong vernacular the legend of
St George and his fight and the tenpound doctor who plays his
part at healing the Sainta relic I believe of the old Middleage
mysteries It was the first dramatic representation which greeted the
eyes of little Tom who was brought down into the kitchen by his nurse
to witness it at the mature age of three years Tom was the eldest
child of his parents and from his earliest babyhood exhibited the
family characteristics in great strength He was a hearty strong boy
from the first given to fighting with and escaping from his nurse and
fraternizing with all the village boys with whom he made expeditions
all round the neighbourhood And here in the quiet oldfashioned
country village under the shadow of the everlasting hills Tom Brown
was reared and never left it till he went first to school when nearly
eight years of age for in those days change of air twice a year was not
thought absolutely necessary for the health of all her Majestys lieges

I have been credibly informed and am inclined to believe that the
various boards of directors of railway companies those gigantic jobbers
and bribers while quarrelling about everything else agreed together
some ten years back to buy up the learned profession of medicine body
and soul To this end they set apart several millions of money which
they continually distribute judiciously among the doctors stipulating
only this one thing that they shall prescribe change of air to every
patient who can pay or borrow money to pay a railway fare and see
their prescription carried out If it be not for this why is it that
none of us can be well at home for a year together It wasnt so twenty
years ago not a bit of it The Browns didnt go out of the country once
in five years A visit to Reading or Abingdon twice a year at assizes
or quarter sessions which the Squire made on his horse with a pair
of saddlebags containing his wardrobe a stay of a day or two at some
country neighbours or an expedition to a county ball or the yeomanry
review made up the sum of the Brown locomotion in most years A stray
Brown from some distant county dropped in every now and then or from
Oxford on grave nag an old don contemporary of the Squire and were
looked upon by the Brown household and the villagers with the same sort
of feeling with which we now regard a man who has crossed the Rocky
Mountains or launched a boat on the Great Lake in Central Africa The
White Horse Vale remember was traversed by no great roadnothing but
country parish roads and these very bad Only one coach ran there and
this one only from Wantage to London so that the western part of the
Vale was without regular means of moving on and certainly didnt
seem to want them There was the canal by the way which supplied the
countryside with coal and up and down which continually went the long
barges with the big black men lounging by the side of the horses along
the towingpath and the women in brightcoloured handkerchiefs standing
in the sterns steering Standing I say but you could never see whether
they were standing or sitting all but their heads and shoulders being
out of sight in the cozy little cabins which occupied some eight feet of
the stern and which Tom Brown pictured to himself as the most desirable
of residences His nurse told him that those goodnaturedlooking women
were in the constant habit of enticing children into the barges and
taking them up to London and selling them which Tom wouldnt
believe and which made him resolve as soon as possible to accept the
oftproffered invitation of these sirens to young master to come in
and have a ride But as yet the nurse was too much for Tom

Yet why should I after all abuse the gadabout propensities of my
countrymen We are a vagabond nation now thats certain for better
for worse I am a vagabond I have been away from home no less than five
distinct times in the last year The Queen sets us the example we are
moving on from top to bottom Little dirty Jack who abides in Clements
Inn gateway and blacks my boots for a penny takes his months
hoppicking every year as a matter of course Why shouldnt he Im
delighted at it I love vagabonds only I prefer poor to rich ones
Couriers and ladiesmaids imperials and travelling carriages are an
abomination unto me I cannot away with them But for dirty Jack and
every good fellow who in the words of the capital French song moves
about

 Comme le limacon
 Portant tout son bagage
 Ses meubles sa maison

on his own back why good luck to them and many a merry roadside
adventure and steaming supper in the chimney corners of roadside inns
Swiss chalets Hottentot kraals or wherever else they like to go So
having succeeded in contradicting myself in my first chapter which
gives me great hopes that you will all go on and think me a good fellow
notwithstanding my crotchets I shall here shut up for the present
and consider my ways having resolved to sar it out as we say in the
Vale holus bolus just as it comes and then youll probably get the
truth out of me



CHAPTER IITHE VEAST

 And the King commandeth and forbiddeth that from
 henceforth neither fairs nor markets be kept in Churchyards
 for the honour of the ChurchSTATUTES  13 Edw I Stat
 II cap vi

As that venerable and learned poet whose voluminous works we all think
it the correct thing to admire and talk about but dont read often
most truly says The child is father to the man a fortiori
therefore he must be father to the boy So as we are going at any rate
to see Tom Brown through his boyhood supposing we never get any farther
which if you show a proper sense of the value of this history there
is no knowing but what we may let us have a look at the life and
environments of the child in the quiet country village to which we were
introduced in the last chapter

Tom as has been already said was a robust and combative urchin and at
the age of four began to struggle against the yoke and authority of his
nurse That functionary was a goodhearted tearful scatterbrained
girl lately taken by Toms mother Madam Brown as she was called from
the village school to be trained as nurserymaid Madam Brown was a rare
trainer of servants and spent herself freely in the profession for
profession it was and gave her more trouble by half than many people
take to earn a good income Her servants were known and sought after for
miles round Almost all the girls who attained a certain place in the
village school were taken by her one or two at a time as housemaids
laundrymaids nurserymaids or kitchenmaids and after a year or twos
training were started in life amongst the neighbouring families with
good principles and wardrobes One of the results of this system was the
perpetual despair of Mrs Browns cook and own maid who no sooner had
a notable girl made to their hands than missus was sure to find a good
place for her and send her off taking in fresh importations from the
school Another was that the house was always full of young girls with
clean shining faces who broke plates and scorched linen but made an
atmosphere of cheerful homely life about the place good for every one
who came within its influence Mrs Brown loved young people and in
fact human creatures in general above plates and linen They were more
like a lot of elder children than servants and felt to her more as a
mother or aunt than as a mistress

Toms nurse was one who took in her instruction very slowlyshe seemed
to have two left hands and no head and so Mrs Brown kept her on longer
than usual that she might expend her awkwardness and forgetfulness upon
those who would not judge and punish her too strictly for them

Charity Lamb was her name It had been the immemorial habit of the
village to christen children either by Bible names or by those of the
cardinal and other virtues so that one was for ever hearing in the
village street or on the green shrill sounds of Prudence Prudence
thee cum out o the gutter or Mercy drat the girl what bist thee
adoin wi little Faith and there were Ruths Rachels Keziahs
in every corner The same with the boys they were Benjamins Jacobs
Noahs Enochs I suppose the custom has come down from Puritan times
There it is at any rate very strong still in the Vale

Well from early morning till dewy eve when she had it out of him in
the cold tub before putting him to bed Charity and Tom were pitted
against one another Physical power was as yet on the side of Charity
but she hadnt a chance with him wherever headwork was wanted This
war of independence began every morning before breakfast when Charity
escorted her charge to a neighbouring farmhouse which supplied the
Browns and where by his mothers wish Master Tom went to drink whey
before breakfast Tom had no sort of objection to whey but he had a
decided liking for curds which were forbidden as unwholesome and there
was seldom a morning that he did not manage to secure a handful of hard
curds in defiance of Charity and of the farmers wife The latter good
soul was a gaunt angular woman who with an old black bonnet on the
top of her head the strings dangling about her shoulders and her
gown tucked through her pocketholes went clattering about the dairy
cheeseroom and yard in high pattens Charity was some sort of niece
of the old ladys and was consequently free of the farmhouse and
garden into which she could not resist going for the purposes of gossip
and flirtation with the heirapparent who was a dawdling fellow never
out at work as he ought to have been The moment Charity had found her
cousin or any other occupation Tom would slip away and in a minute
shrill cries would be heard from the dairy Charity Charity thee lazy
huzzy where bist and Tom would break cover hands and mouth full of
curds and take refuge on the shaky surface of the great muck reservoir
in the middle of the yard disturbing the repose of the great pigs Here
he was in safety as no grown person could follow without getting over
their knees and the luckless Charity while her aunt scolded her from
the dairy door for being allus hankering about arter our Willum
instead of minding Master Tom would descend from threats to coaxing
to lure Tom out of the muck which was rising over his shoes and would
soon tell a tale on his stockings for which she would be sure to catch
it from missuss maid

Tom had two abettors in the shape of a couple of old boys Noah and
Benjamin by name who defended him from Charity and expended much time
upon his education They were both of them retired servants of former
generations of the Browns Noah Crooke was a keen dry old man of almost
ninety but still able to totter about He talked to Tom quite as if he
were one of his own family and indeed had long completely identified
the Browns with himself In some remote age he had been the attendant
of a Miss Brown and had conveyed her about the country on a pillion He
had a little round picture of the identical gray horse caparisoned
with the identical pillion before which he used to do a sort of
fetish worship and abuse turnpikeroads and carriages He wore an old
fullbottomed wig the gift of some dandy old Brown whom he had valeted
in the middle of last century which habiliment Master Tom looked upon
with considerable respect not to say fear and indeed his whole feeling
towards Noah was strongly tainted with awe And when the old gentleman
was gathered to his fathers Toms lamentation over him was not
unaccompanied by a certain joy at having seen the last of the wig Poor
old Noah dead and gone said he Tom Brown so sorry Put him in the
coffin wig and all

But old Benjy was young masters real delight and refuge He was a
youth by the side of Noah scarce seventy years olda cheery humorous
kindhearted old man full of sixty years of Vale gossip and of all
sorts of helpful ways for young and old but above all for children
It was he who bent the first pin with which Tom extracted his first
stickleback out of Pebbly Brook the little stream which ran through
the village The first stickleback was a splendid fellow with fabulous
red and blue gills Tom kept him in a small basin till the day of his
death and became a fisherman from that day Within a month from the
taking of the first stickleback Benjy had carried off our hero to
the canal in defiance of Charity and between them after a whole
afternoons popjoying they had caught three or four small coarse fish
and a perch averaging perhaps two and a half ounces each which Tom
bore home in rapture to his mother as a precious gift and which she
received like a true mother with equal rapture instructing the cook
nevertheless in a private interview not to prepare the same for the
Squires dinner Charity had appealed against old Benjy in the meantime
representing the dangers of the canal banks but Mrs Brown seeing the
boys inaptitude for female guidance had decided in Benjys favour and
from thenceforth the old man was Toms dry nurse And as they sat by the
canal watching their little greenandwhite float Benjy would instruct
him in the doings of deceased Browns How his grandfather in the early
days of the great war when there was much distress and crime in the
Vale and the magistrates had been threatened by the mob had ridden in
with a big stick in his hand and held the petty sessions by himself
How his greatuncle the rector had encountered and laid the last
ghost who had frightened the old women male and female of the
parish out of their senses and who turned out to be the blacksmiths
apprentice disguised in drink and a white sheet It was Benjy too
who saddled Toms first pony and instructed him in the mysteries of
horsemanship teaching him to throw his weight back and keep his hand
low and who stood chuckling outside the door of the girls school when
Tom rode his little Shetland into the cottage and round the table where
the old dame and her pupils were seated at their work

Benjy himself was come of a family distinguished in the Vale for their
prowess in all athletic games Some halfdozen of his brothers and
kinsmen had gone to the wars of whom only one had survived to come
home with a small pension and three bullets in different parts of his
body he had shared Benjys cottage till his death and had left him his
old dragoons sword and pistol which hung over the mantelpiece flanked
by a pair of heavy singlesticks with which Benjy himself had won renown
long ago as an old gamester against the picked men of Wiltshire and
Somersetshire in many a good bout at the revels and pastimes of the
countryside For he had been a famous backswordman in his young days
and a good wrestler at elbow and collar

Backswording and wrestling were the most serious holiday pursuits of
the Valethose by which men attained fameand each village had its
champion I suppose that on the whole people were less worked then
than they are now at any rate they seemed to have more time and energy
for the old pastimes The great times for backswording came round once
a year in each village at the feast The Vale veasts were not
the common statute feasts but much more ancient business They are
literally so far as one can ascertain feasts of the dedicationthat
is they were first established in the churchyard on the day on which
the village church was opened for public worship which was on the wake
or festival of the patron saint and have been held on the same day in
every year since that time

There was no longer any remembrance of why the veast had been
instituted but nevertheless it had a pleasant and almost sacred
character of its own for it was then that all the children of the
village wherever they were scattered tried to get home for a holiday
to visit their fathers and mothers and friends bringing with them their
wages or some little gift from up the country for the old folk Perhaps
for a day or two before but at any rate on veast day and the day
after in our village you might see strapping healthy young men and
women from all parts of the country going round from house to house in
their best clothes and finishing up with a call on Madam Brown
whom they would consult as to putting out their earnings to the best
advantage or how best to expend the same for the benefit of the old
folk Every household however poor managed to raise a feastcake
and a bottle of ginger or raisin wine which stood on the cottage table
ready for all comers and not unlikely to make them remember feasttime
for feastcake is very solid and full of huge raisins Moreover
feasttime was the day of reconciliation for the parish If Job Higgins
and Noah Freeman hadnt spoken for the last six months their old
women would be sure to get it patched up by that day And though there
was a good deal of drinking and low vice in the booths of an evening
it was pretty well confined to those who would have been doing the like
veast or no veast and on the whole the effect was humanising and
Christian In fact the only reason why this is not the case still is
that gentlefolk and farmers have taken to other amusements and have as
usual forgotten the poor They dont attend the feasts themselves and
call them disreputable whereupon the steadiest of the poor leave them
also and they become what they are called Class amusements be
they for dukes or ploughboys always become nuisances and curses to a
country The true charm of cricket and hunting is that they are still
more or less sociable and universal theres a place for every man who
will come and take his part

No one in the village enjoyed the approach of veast day more than Tom
in the year in which he was taken under old Benjys tutelage The feast
was held in a large green field at the lower end of the village The
road to Farringdon ran along one side of it and the brook by the side
of the road and above the brook was another large gentle sloping
pastureland with a footpath running down it from the churchyard and
the old church the originator of all the mirth towered up with its
gray walls and lancet windows overlooking and sanctioning the whole
though its own share therein had been forgotten At the point where the
footpath crossed the brook and road and entered on the field where the
feast was held was a long low roadside inn and on the opposite side
of the field was a large white thatched farmhouse where dwelt an old
sporting farmer a great promoter of the revels

Past the old church and down the footpath pottered the old man and the
child handinhand early on the afternoon of the day before the feast
and wandered all round the ground which was already being occupied
by the cheap Jacks with their greencovered carts and marvellous
assortment of wares and the booths of more legitimate small traders
with their tempting arrays of fairings and eatables and penny
peepshows and other shows containing pinkeyed ladies and dwarfs and
boaconstrictors and wild Indians But the object of most interest to
Benjy and of course to his pupil also was the stage of rough planks
some four feet high which was being put up by the village carpenter for
the backswording and wrestling And after surveying the whole tenderly
old Benjy led his charge away to the roadside inn where he ordered a
glass of ale and a long pipe for himself and discussed these unwonted
luxuries on the bench outside in the soft autumn evening with mine
host another old servant of the Browns and speculated with him on the
likelihood of a good show of old gamesters to contend for the morrows
prizes and told tales of the gallant bouts of forty years back to
which Tom listened with all his ears and eyes

But who shall tell the joy of the next morning when the church bells
were ringing a merry peal and old Benjy appeared in the servants hall
resplendent in a long blue coat and brass buttons and a pair of old
yellow buckskins and topboots which he had cleaned for and inherited
from Toms grandfather a stout thorn stick in his hand and a nosegay
of pinks and lavender in his buttonhole and led away Tom in his best
clothes and two new shillings in his breechespockets Those two at
any rate look like enjoying the days revel

They quicken their pace when they get into the churchyard for already
they see the field thronged with country folk the men in clean white
smocks or velveteen or fustian coats with rough plush waistcoats of
many colours and the women in the beautiful long scarlet cloakthe
usual outdoor dress of westcountry women in those days and which
often descended in families from mother to daughteror in newfashioned
stuff shawls which if they would but believe it dont become them
half so well The air resounds with the pipe and tabor and the drums
and trumpets of the showmen shouting at the doors of their caravans
over which tremendous pictures of the wonders to be seen within hang
temptingly while through all rises the shrill roottootootoo of Mr
Punch and the unceasing panpipe of his satellite

Lawk a massey Mr Benjamin cries a stout motherly woman in a red
cloak as they enter the field be that you Well I never You do look
purely And hows the Squire and madam and the family

Benjy graciously shakes hands with the speaker who has left our village
for some years but has come over for veast day on a visit to an old
gossip and gently indicates the heirapparent of the Browns

Bless his little heart I must gi un a kissHere Susannah
Susannah cries she raising herself from the embrace come and see
Mr Benjamin and young Master TomYou minds our Sukey Mr Benjamin
she be growed a rare slip of a wench since you seen her though herll
be sixteen come Martinmas I do aim to take her to see madam to get her
a place

And Sukey comes bouncing away from a knot of old schoolfellows and
drops a curtsey to Mr Benjamin And elders come up from all parts to
salute Benjy and girls who have been madams pupils to kiss Master
Tom And they carry him off to load him with fairings and he returns
to Benjy his hat and coat covered with ribbons and his pockets crammed
with wonderful boxes which open upon ever new boxes and popguns and
trumpets and apples and gilt gingerbread from the stall of Angel
Heavens sole vender thereof whose booth groans with kings and queens
and elephants and prancing steeds all gleaming with gold There
was more gold on Angels cakes than there is ginger in those of
this degenerate age Skilled diggers might yet make a fortune in the
churchyards of the Vale by carefully washing the dust of the consumers
of Angels gingerbread Alas he is with his namesakes and his receipts
have I fear died with him

And then they inspect the penny peepshowat least Tom doeswhile old
Benjy stands outside and gossips and walks up the steps and enters the
mysterious doors of the pinkeyed lady and the Irish giant who do not
by any means come up to their pictures and the boa will not swallow his
rabbit but there the rabbit is waiting to be swallowed and what can
you expect for tuppence We are easily pleased in the Vale Now there
is a rush of the crowd and a tinkling bell is heard and shouts of
laughter and Master Tom mounts on Benjys shoulders and beholds a
jingling match in all its glory The games are begun and this is the
opening of them It is a quaint game immensely amusing to look at
and as I dont know whether it is used in your counties I had better
describe it A large roped ring is made into which are introduced
a dozen or so of big boys and young men who mean to play these are
carefully blinded and turned loose into the ring and then a man is
introduced not blindfolded with a bell hung round his neck and his two
hands tied behind him Of course every time he moves the bell must ring
as he has no hand to hold it and so the dozen blindfolded men have to
catch him This they cannot always manage if he is a lively fellow but
half of them always rush into the arms of the other half or drive their
heads together or tumble over and then the crowd laughs vehemently
and invents nicknames for them on the spur of the moment and they if
they be choleric tear off the handkerchiefs which blind them and not
unfrequently pitch into one another each thinking that the other must
have run against him on purpose It is great fun to look at a jingling
match certainly and Tom shouts and jumps on old Benjys shoulders at
the sight until the old man feels weary and shifts him to the strong
young shoulders of the groom who has just got down to the fun

And now while they are climbing the pole in another part of the field
and muzzling in a flourtub in another the old farmer whose house as
has been said overlooks the field and who is master of the revels
gets up the steps on to the stage and announces to all whom it may
concern that a halfsovereign in money will be forthcoming to the old
gamester who breaks most heads to which the Squire and he have added a
new hat

The amount of the prize is sufficient to stimulate the men of the
immediate neighbourhood but not enough to bring any very high talent
from a distance so after a glance or two round a tall fellow who is
a down shepherd chucks his hat on to the stage and climbs up the steps
looking rather sheepish The crowd of course first cheer and then
chaff as usual as he picks up his hat and begins handling the sticks to
see which will suit him

Wooy Willum Smith thee canst plaay wi he arra daay says his
companion to the blacksmiths apprentice a stout young fellow of
nineteen or twenty Willums sweetheart is in the veast somewhere and
has strictly enjoined him not to get his head broke at backswording on
pain of her highest displeasure but as she is not to be seen the women
pretend not to like to see the backsword play and keep away from the
stage and as his hat is decidedly getting old he chucks it on to the
stage and follows himself hoping that he will only have to break other
peoples heads or that after all Rachel wont really mind

Then follows the greasy cap lined with fur of a halfgipsy poaching
loafing fellow who travels the Vale not for much good I fancy

 For twenty times was Peter feared
 For once that Peter was respected

in fact And then three or four other hats including the glossy
castor of Joe Willis the selfelected and wouldbe champion of
the neighbourhood a welltodo young butcher of twentyeight or
thereabouts and a great strapping fellow with his full allowance of
bluster This is a capital show of gamesters considering the amount
of the prize so while they are picking their sticks and drawing their
lots I think I must tell you as shortly as I can how the noble old
game of backsword is played for it is sadly gone out of late even in
the Vale and maybe you have never seen it

The weapon is a good stout ash stick with a large basket handle heavier
and somewhat shorter than a common singlestick The players are called
old gamesterswhy I cant tell youand their object is simply
to break one anothers heads for the moment that blood runs an inch
anywhere above the eyebrow the old gamester to whom it belongs is
beaten and has to stop A very slight blow with the sticks will fetch
blood so that it is by no means a punishing pastime if the men dont
play on purpose and savagely at the body and arms of their adversaries
The old gamester going into action only takes off his hat and coat and
arms himself with a stick he then loops the fingers of his left hand in
a handkerchief or strap which he fastens round his left leg measuring
the length so that when he draws it tight with his left elbow in the
air that elbow shall just reach as high as his crown Thus you see so
long as he chooses to keep his left elbow up regardless of cuts he
has a perfect guard for the left side of his head Then he advances his
right hand above and in front of his head holding his stick across so
that its point projects an inch or two over his left elbow and thus
his whole head is completely guarded and he faces his man armed in like
manner and they stand some three feet apart often nearer and feint
and strike and return at one anothers heads until one cries hold
or blood flows In the first case they are allowed a minutes time and
go on again in the latter another pair of gamesters are called on If
good men are playing the quickness of the returns is marvellous you
hear the rattle like that a boy makes drawing his stick along palings
only heavier and the closeness of the men in action to one another
gives it a strange interest and makes a spell at backswording a very
noble sight

They are all suited now with sticks and Joe Willis and the gipsy man
have drawn the first lot So the rest lean against the rails of the
stage and Joe and the dark man meet in the middle the boards having
been strewed with sawdust Joes white shirt and spotless drab breeches
and boots contrasting with the gipsys coarse blue shirt and dirty green
velveteen breeches and leather gaiters Joe is evidently turning up his
nose at the other and half insulted at having to break his head

The gipsy is a tough active fellow but not very skilful with his
weapon so that Joes weight and strength tell in a minute he is too
heavy metal for him Whack whack whack come his blows breaking down
the gipsys guard and threatening to reach his head every moment There
it is at last Blood blood shout the spectators as a thin stream
oozes out slowly from the roots of his hair and the umpire calls to
them to stop The gipsy scowls at Joe under his brows in no pleasant
manner while Master Joe swaggers about and makes attitudes and thinks
himself and shows that he thinks himself the greatest man in the
field

Then follow several stout setsto between the other candidates for the
new hat and at last come the shepherd and Willum Smith This is the
crack setto of the day They are both in famous wind and there is no
crying hold The shepherd is an old hand and up to all the dodges He
tries them one after another and very nearly gets at Willums head
by coming in near and playing over his guard at the halfstick but
somehow Willum blunders through catching the stick on his shoulders
neck sides every now and then anywhere but on his head and his
returns are heavy and straight and he is the youngest gamester and a
favourite in the parish and his gallant stand brings down shouts and
cheers and the knowing ones think hell win if he keeps steady and
Tom on the grooms shoulder holds his hands together and can hardly
breathe for excitement

Alas for Willum His sweetheart getting tired of female companionship
has been hunting the booths to see where he can have got to and now
catches sight of him on the stage in full combat She flushes and turns
pale her old aunt catches hold of her saying Bless ee child
doant ee go anigst it but she breaks away and runs towards the
stage calling his name Willum keeps up his guard stoutly but glances
for a moment towards the voice No guard will do it Willum without the
eye The shepherd steps round and strikes and the point of his stick
just grazes Willums forehead fetching off the skin and the blood
flows and the umpire cries Hold and poor Willums chance is up for
the day But he takes it very well and puts on his old hat and coat
and goes down to be scolded by his sweetheart and led away out of
mischief Tom hears him say coaxingly as he walks off

Now doant ee Rachel I wouldnt ha done it only I wanted summut
to buy ee a fairing wi and I be as vlush o money as a twod o
feathers

Thee mind what I tells ee rejoins Rachel saucily and doant ee
kep blethering about fairings

Tom resolves in his heart to give Willum the remainder of his two
shillings after the backswording

Joe Willis has all the luck today His next bout ends in an easy
victory while the shepherd has a tough job to break his second head
and when Joe and the shepherd meet and the whole circle expect and hope
to see him get a broken crown the shepherd slips in the first round and
falls against the rails hurting himself so that the old farmer will not
let him go on much as he wishes to try and that impostor Joe for he
is certainly not the best man struts and swaggers about the stage the
conquering gamester though he hasnt had five minutes really trying
play

Joe takes the new hat in his hand and puts the money into it and then
as if a thought strikes him and he doesnt think his victory quite
acknowledged down below walks to each face of the stage and looks
down shaking the money and chaffing as how hell stake hat and money
and another halfsovereign agin any gamester as hasnt played already
Cunning Joe he thus gets rid of Willum and the shepherd who is quite
fresh again

No one seems to like the offer and the umpire is just coming down
when a queer old hat something like a doctor of divinitys shovel is
chucked on to the stage and an elderly quiet man steps out who has
been watching the play saying he should like to cross a stick wi the
prodigalish young chap

The crowd cheer and begin to chaff Joe who turns up his nose and
swaggers across to the sticks Impdent old wosbird says he Ill
break the bald head on un to the truth

The old boy is very bald certainly and the blood will show fast enough
if you can touch him Joe

He takes off his longflapped coat and stands up in a longflapped
waistcoat which Sir Roger de Coverley might have worn when it was new
picks out a stick and is ready for Master Joe who loses no time but
begins his old game whack whack whack trying to break down the old
mans guard by sheer strength But it wont do he catches every blow
close by the basket and though he is rather stiff in his returns
after a minute walks Joe about the stage and is clearly a stanch old
gamester Joe now comes in and making the most of his height tries to
get over the old mans guard at halfstick by which he takes a smart
blow in the ribs and another on the elbow and nothing more And now he
loses wind and begins to puff and the crowd laugh Cry hold Joe
theest met thy match Instead of taking good advice and getting his
wind Joe loses his temper and strikes at the old mans body

Blood blood shout the crowd Joes heads broke

Whod have thought it How did it come That bodyblow left Joes head
unguarded for a moment and with one turn of the wrist the old gentleman
has picked a neat little bit of skin off the middle of his forehead and
though he wont believe it and hammers on for three more blows despite
of the shouts is then convinced by the blood trickling into his eye
Poor Joe is sadly crestfallen and fumbles in his pocket for the other
halfsovereign but the old gamester wont have it Keep thy money
man and gis thy hand says he and they shake hands But the old
gamester gives the new hat to the shepherd and soon after the
halfsovereign to Willum who thereout decorates his sweetheart with
ribbons to his hearts content

Who can a be Wur do a cum from ask the crowd And it soon flies
about that the old westcountry champion who played a tie with Shaw the
Lifeguardsman at Vizes twenty years before has broken Joe Williss
crown for him

How my country fair is spinning out I see I must skip the wrestling
and the boys jumping in sacks and rolling wheelbarrows blindfolded
and the donkeyrace and the fight which arose thereout marring the
otherwise peaceful veast and the frightened scurrying away of the
female feastgoers and descent of Squire Brown summoned by the wife of
one of the combatants to stop it which he wouldnt start to do till he
had got on his topboots Tom is carried away by old Benjy dogtired
and surfeited with pleasure as the evening comes on and the dancing
begins in the booths and though Willum and Rachel in her new ribbons
and many another good lad and lass dont come away just yet but have
a good step out and enjoy it and get no harm thereby yet we being
sober folk will just stroll away up through the churchyard and by the
old yewtree and get a quiet dish of tea and a parley with our gossips
as the steady ones of our village do and so to bed

Thats the fair true sketch as far as it goes of one of the larger
village feasts in the Vale of Berks when I was a little boy They
are much altered for the worse I am told I havent been at one these
twenty years but I have been at the statute fairs in some westcountry
towns where servants are hired and greater abominations cannot be
found What village feasts have come to I fear in many cases may
be read in the pages of Yeast though I never saw one so badthank
God

Do you want to know why It is because as I said before gentlefolk and
farmers have left off joining or taking an interest in them They dont
either subscribe to the prizes or go down and enjoy the fun

Is this a good or a bad sign I hardly know Bad sure enough if it
only arises from the further separation of classes consequent on twenty
years of buying cheap and selling dear and its accompanying overwork
or because our sons and daughters have their hearts in London clublife
or socalled society instead of in the old English homeduties
because farmers sons are apeing fine gentlemen and farmers daughters
caring more to make bad foreign music than good English cheeses Good
perhaps if it be that the time for the old veast has gone by that
it is no longer the healthy sound expression of English country
holidaymaking that in fact we as a nation have got beyond it
and are in a transition state feeling for and soon likely to find some
better substitute

Only I have just got this to say before I quit the text Dont let
reformers of any sort think that they are going really to lay hold of
the working boys and young men of England by any educational grapnel
whatever which isnt some bona fide equivalent for the games of the
old country veast in it something to put in the place of the
backswording and wrestling and racing something to try the muscles
of mens bodies and the endurance of their hearts and to make them
rejoice in their strength In all the newfangled comprehensive plans
which I see this is all left out and the consequence is that your
great mechanics institutes end in intellectual priggism and your
Christian young mens societies in religious Pharisaism

Well well we must bide our time Life isnt all beer and skittles
but beer and skittles or something better of the same sort must form
a good part of every Englishmans education If I could only drive this
into the heads of you rising parliamentary lords and young swells
who have your ways made for you as the saying is you who frequent
palaver houses and Westend clubs waiting always ready to strap
yourselves on to the back of poor dear old John as soon as the present
usedup lot your fathers and uncles who sit there on the great
parliamentarymajorities packsaddle and make believe theyre guiding
him with their redtape bridle tumble or have to be lifted off

I dont think much of you yetI wish I couldthough you do go talking
and lecturing up and down the country to crowded audiences and are
busy with all sorts of philanthropic intellectualism and circulating
libraries and museums and Heaven only knows what besides and try to
make us think through newspaper reports that you are even as we of
the working classes But bless your hearts we aint so green though
lots of us of all sorts toady you enough certainly and try to make you
think so

Ill tell you what to do now instead of all this trumpeting and fuss
which is only the old parliamentarymajority dodge over again just you
go each of you youve plenty of time for it if youll only give
up tother line and quietly make three or four friendsreal
friendsamong us Youll find a little trouble in getting at the right
sort because such birds dont come lightly to your lure but found
they may be Take say two out of the professions lawyer parson
doctorwhich you will one out of trade and three or four out of the
working classestailors engineers carpenters engravers Theres
plenty of choice Let them be men of your own ages mind and ask
them to your homes introduce them to your wives and sisters and get
introduced to theirs give them good dinners and talk to them about
what is really at the bottom of your hearts and box and run and row
with them when you have a chance Do all this honestly as man to
man and by the time you come to ride old John youll be able to do
something more than sit on his back and may feel his mouth with some
stronger bridle than a redtape one

Ah if you only would But you have got too far out of the right rut I
fear Too much overcivilization and the deceitfulness of riches It is
easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle Mores the pity I
never came across but two of you who could value a man wholly and solely
for what was in himwho thought themselves verily and indeed of the
same flesh and blood as John Jones the attorneys clerk and Bill Smith
the costermonger and could act as if they thought so



CHAPTER IIISUNDRY WARS AND ALLIANCES


Poor old Benjy The rheumatiz has much to answer for all through
English countrysides but it never played a scurvier trick than in
laying thee by the heels when thou wast yet in a green old age The
enemy which had long been carrying on a sort of border warfare and
trying his strength against Benjys on the battlefield of his hands and
legs now mustering all his forces began laying siege to the citadel
and overrunning the whole country Benjy was seized in the back and
loins and though he made strong and brave fight it was soon clear
enough that all which could be beaten of poor old Benjy would have to
give in before long

It was as much as he could do now with the help of his big stick and
frequent stops to hobble down to the canal with Master Tom and bait
his hook for him and sit and watch his angling telling him quaint old
country stories and when Tom had no sport and detecting a rat some
hundred yards or so off along the bank would rush off with Toby the
turnspit terrier his other faithful companion in bootless pursuit he
might have tumbled in and been drowned twenty times over before Benjy
could have got near him

Cheery and unmindful of himself as Benjy was this loss of locomotive
power bothered him greatly He had got a new object in his old age and
was just beginning to think himself useful again in the world He feared
much too lest Master Tom should fall back again into the hands of
Charity and the women So he tried everything he could think of to get
set up He even went an expedition to the dwelling of one of those queer
mortals whosay what we will and reason how we willdo cure simple
people of diseases of one kind or another without the aid of physic
and so get to themselves the reputation of using charms and inspire for
themselves and their dwellings great respect not to say fear amongst a
simple folk such as the dwellers in the Vale of White Horse Where this
power or whatever else it may be descends upon the shoulders of a
man whose ways are not straight he becomes a nuisance to the
neighbourhooda receiver of stolen goods giver of lovepotions and
deceiver of silly womenthe avowed enemy of law and order of justices
of the peace headboroughs and gamekeeperssuch a man in fact as
was recently caught tripping and deservedly dealt with by the Leeds
justices for seducing a girl who had come to him to get back a
faithless lover and has been convicted of bigamy since then Sometimes
however they are of quite a different stampmen who pretend to
nothing and are with difficulty persuaded to exercise their occult arts
in the simplest cases

Of this latter sort was old Farmer Ives as he was called the wise
man to whom Benjy resorted taking Tom with him as usual in the early
spring of the year next after the feast described in the last chapter
Why he was called farmer I cannot say unless it be that he was the
owner of a cow a pig or two and some poultry which he maintained
on about an acre of land inclosed from the middle of a wild common on
which probably his father had squatted before lords of manors looked as
keenly after their rights as they do now Here he had lived no one knew
how long a solitary man It was often rumoured that he was to be turned
out and his cottage pulled down but somehow it never came to pass and
his pigs and cow went grazing on the common and his geese hissed at the
passing children and at the heels of the horse of my lords steward who
often rode by with a covetous eye on the inclosure still unmolested His
dwelling was some miles from our village so Benjy who was half ashamed
of his errand and wholly unable to walk there had to exercise much
ingenuity to get the means of transporting himself and Tom thither
without exciting suspicion However one fine May morning he managed to
borrow the old blind pony of our friend the publican and Tom persuaded
Madam Brown to give him a holiday to spend with old Benjy and to lend
them the Squires light cart stored with bread and cold meat and a
bottle of ale And so the two in high glee started behind old Dobbin
and jogged along the deeprutted plashy roads which had not been mended
after their winters wear towards the dwelling of the wizard About
noon they passed the gate which opened on to the large common and old
Dobbin toiled slowly up the hill while Benjy pointed out a little deep
dingle on the left out of which welled a tiny stream As they crept
up the hill the tops of a few birchtrees came in sight and blue smoke
curling up through their delicate light boughs and then the little
white thatched home and inclosed ground of Farmer Ives lying cradled in
the dingle with the gay gorse common rising behind and on both sides
while in front after traversing a gentle slope the eye might travel
for miles and miles over the rich vale They now left the main road and
struck into a green track over the common marked lightly with wheel and
horseshoe which led down into the dingle and stopped at the rough gate
of Farmer Ives Here they found the farmer an irongray old man with a
bushy eyebrow and strong aquiline nose busied in one of his vocations
He was a horse and cow doctor and was tending a sick beast which had
been sent up to be cured Benjy hailed him as an old friend and he
returned the greeting cordially enough looking however hard for a
moment both at Benjy and Tom to see whether there was more in their
visit than appeared at first sight It was a work of some difficulty and
danger for Benjy to reach the ground which however he managed to do
without mishap and then he devoted himself to unharnessing Dobbin and
turning him out for a graze a run one could not say of that virtuous
steed on the common This done he extricated the cold provisions from
the cart and they entered the farmers wicket and he shutting up the
knife with which he was taking maggots out of the cows back and sides
accompanied them towards the cottage A big old lurcher got up slowly
from the doorstone stretching first one hind leg and then the other
and taking Toms caresses and the presence of Toby who kept however
at a respectful distance with equal indifference

Us be cum to pay ee a visit Ive a been long minded to dot for old
sakes sake only I vinds I dwont get about now as Id used tot I be
so plaguy bad wi th rheumatiz in my back Benjy paused in hopes
of drawing the farmer at once on the subject of his ailments without
further direct application

Ah I see as you beant quite so lissom as you was replied the
farmer with a grim smile as he lifted the latch of his door we
beant so young as we was nother on us wuss luck

The farmers cottage was very like those of the better class of
peasantry in general A snug chimney corner with two seats and a small
carpet on the hearth an old flint gun and a pair of spurs over the
fireplace a dresser with shelves on which some bright pewter plates
and crockeryware were arranged an old walnut table a few chairs and
settles some framed samplers and an old print or two and a bookcase
with some dozen volumes on the walls a rack with flitches of bacon and
other stores fastened to the ceiling and you have the best part of the
furniture No sign of occult art is to be seen unless the bundles of
dried herbs hanging to the rack and in the ingle and the row of labelled
phials on one of the shelves betoken it

Tom played about with some kittens who occupied the hearth and with a
goat who walked demurely in at the open doorwhile their host and Benjy
spread the table for dinnerand was soon engaged in conflict with the
cold meat to which he did much honour The two old mens talk was of
old comrades and their deeds mute inglorious Miltons of the Vale and
of the doings thirty years back which didnt interest him much except
when they spoke of the making of the canal and then indeed he began to
listen with all his ears and learned to his no small wonder that his
dear and wonderful canal had not been there alwayswas not in fact
so old as Benjy or Farmer Ives which caused a strange commotion in his
small brain

After dinner Benjy called attention to a wart which Tom had on the
knuckles of his hand and which the family doctor had been trying his
skill on without success and begged the farmer to charm it away Farmer
Ives looked at it muttered something or another over it and cut
some notches in a short stick which he handed to Benjy giving him
instructions for cutting it down on certain days and cautioning Tom not
to meddle with the wart for a fortnight And then they strolled out and
sat on a bench in the sun with their pipes and the pigs came up and
grunted sociably and let Tom scratch them and the farmer seeing how he
liked animals stood up and held his arms in the air and gave a call
which brought a flock of pigeons wheeling and dashing through the
birchtrees They settled down in clusters on the farmers arms and
shoulders making love to him and scrambling over one anothers backs
to get to his face and then he threw them all off and they fluttered
about close by and lighted on him again and again when he held up his
arms All the creatures about the place were clean and fearless quite
unlike their relations elsewhere and Tom begged to be taught how to
make all the pigs and cows and poultry in our village tame at which the
farmer only gave one of his grim chuckles

It wasnt till they were just ready to go and old Dobbin was harnessed
that Benjy broached the subject of his rheumatism again detailing his
symptoms one by one Poor old boy He hoped the farmer could charm it
away as easily as he could Toms wart and was ready with equal faith to
put another notched stick into his other pocket for the cure of his
own ailments The physician shook his head but nevertheless produced a
bottle and handed it to Benjy with instructions for use Not as tll
do ee much goodleastways I be afeard not shading his eyes with his
hand and looking up at them in the cart Theres only one thing as I
knows on asll cure old folks like you and I o th rheumatiz

Wot be that then farmer inquired Benjy

Churchyard mould said the old irongray man with another chuckle
And so they said their goodbyes and went their ways home Toms wart
was gone in a fortnight but not so Benjys rheumatism which laid him
by the heels more and more And though Tom still spent many an hour with
him as he sat on a bench in the sunshine or by the chimney corner when
it was cold he soon had to seek elsewhere for his regular companions

Tom had been accustomed often to accompany his mother in her visits to
the cottages and had thereby made acquaintance with many of the village
boys of his own age There was Job Rudkin son of widow Rudkin the most
bustling woman in the parish How she could ever have had such a stolid
boy as Job for a child must always remain a mystery The first time
Tom went to their cottage with his mother Job was not indoors but he
entered soon after and stood with both hands in his pockets staring
at Tom Widow Rudkin who would have had to cross madam to get at
young Hopefula breach of good manners of which she was wholly
incapablebegan a series of pantomime signs which only puzzled him
and at last unable to contain herself longer burst out with Job
Job wheres thy cap

What beant ee on ma head mother replied Job slowly extricating
one hand from a pocket and feeling for the article in question which
he found on his head sure enough and left there to his mothers horror
and Toms great delight

Then there was poor Jacob Dodson the halfwitted boy who ambled about
cheerfully undertaking messages and little helpful odds and ends for
every one which however poor Jacob managed always hopelessly to
imbrangle Everything came to pieces in his hands and nothing would
stop in his head They nicknamed him Jacob Doodlecalf

But above all there was Harry Winburn the quickest and best boy in the
parish He might be a year older than Tom but was very little bigger
and he was the Crichton of our village boys He could wrestle and climb
and run better than all the rest and learned all that the schoolmaster
could teach him faster than that worthy at all liked He was a boy to
be proud of with his curly brown hair keen gray eye straight active
figure and little ears and hands and feet as fine as a lords as
Charity remarked to Tom one day talking as usual great nonsense
Lords hands and ears and feet are just as ugly as other folks when
they are children as any one may convince himself if he likes to look
Tight boots and gloves and doing nothing with them I allow make a
difference by the time they are twenty

Now that Benjy was laid on the shelf and his young brothers were still
under petticoat government Tom in search of companions began to
cultivate the village boys generally more and more Squire Brown be it
said was a trueblue Tory to the backbone and believed honestly that
the powers which be were ordained of God and that loyalty and steadfast
obedience were mens first duties Whether it were in consequence or in
spite of his political creed I do not mean to give an opinion though
I have one but certain it is that he held therewith divers social
principles not generally supposed to be true blue in colour Foremost of
these and the one which the Squire loved to propound above all others
was the belief that a man is to be valued wholly and solely for that
which he is in himself for that which stands up in the four fleshly
walls of him apart from clothes rank fortune and all externals
whatsoever Which belief I take to be a wholesome corrective of all
political opinions and if held sincerely to make all opinions equally
harmless whether they be blue red or green As a necessary corollary
to this belief Squire Brown held further that it didnt matter a
straw whether his son associated with lords sons or ploughmens sons
provided they were brave and honest He himself had played football
and gone birdnesting with the farmers whom he met at vestry and
the labourers who tilled their fields and so had his father and
grandfather with their progenitors So he encouraged Tom in his
intimacy with the boys of the village and forwarded it by all means
in his power and gave them the run of a close for a playground and
provided bats and balls and a football for their sports

Our village was blessed amongst other things with a wellendowed school
The building stood by itself apart from the masters house on an angle
of ground where three roads metan old gray stone building with a steep
roof and mullioned windows On one of the opposite angles stood Squire
Browns stables and kennel with their backs to the road over which
towered a great elmtree on the third stood the village carpenter and
wheelwrights large open shop and his house and the schoolmasters
with long low eaves under which the swallows built by scores

The moment Toms lessons were over he would now get him down to this
corner by the stables and watch till the boys came out of school He
prevailed on the groom to cut notches for him in the bark of the elm
so that he could climb into the lower branches and there he would sit
watching the school door and speculating on the possibility of turning
the elm into a dwellingplace for himself and friends after the manner
of the Swiss Family Robinson But the school hours were long and Toms
patience short so that he soon began to descend into the street and go
and peep in at the school door and the wheelwrights shop and look out
for something to while away the time Now the wheelwright was a choleric
man and one fine afternoon returning from a short absence found Tom
occupied with one of his pet adzes the edge of which was fast vanishing
under our heros care A speedy flight saved Tom from all but one sound
cuff on the ears but he resented this unjustifiable interruption of his
first essays at carpentering and still more the further proceedings
of the wheelwright who cut a switch and hung it over the door of his
workshop threatening to use it upon Tom if he came within twenty yards
of his gate So Tom to retaliate commenced a war upon the swallows who
dwelt under the wheelwrights eaves whom he harassed with sticks
and stones and being fleeter of foot than his enemy escaped all
punishment and kept him in perpetual anger Moreover his presence
about the school door began to incense the master as the boys in that
neighbourhood neglected their lessons in consequence and more than once
he issued into the porch rod in hand just as Tom beat a hasty retreat
And he and the wheelwright laying their heads together resolved to
acquaint the Squire with Toms afternoon occupations but in order to
do it with effect determined to take him captive and lead him away to
judgment fresh from his evil doings This they would have found some
difficulty in doing had Tom continued the war singlehanded or rather
singlefooted for he would have taken to the deepest part of Pebbly
Brook to escape them but like other active powers he was ruined by
his alliances Poor Jacob Doodlecalf could not go to the school with
the other boys and one fine afternoon about three oclock the school
broke up at four Tom found him ambling about the street and pressed
him into a visit to the schoolporch Jacob always ready to do what he
was asked consented and the two stole down to the school together
Tom first reconnoitred the wheelwrights shop and seeing no signs
of activity thought all safe in that quarter and ordered at once an
advance of all his troops upon the schoolporch The door of the school
was ajar and the boys seated on the nearest bench at once recognized
and opened a correspondence with the invaders Tom waxing bold kept
putting his head into the school and making faces at the master when
his back was turned Poor Jacob not in the least comprehending the
situation and in high glee at finding himself so near the school which
he had never been allowed to enter suddenly in a fit of enthusiasm
pushed by Tom and ambling three steps into the school stood there
looking round him and nodding with a selfapproving smile The master
who was stooping over a boys slate with his back to the door became
aware of something unusual and turned quickly round Tom rushed at
Jacob and began dragging him back by his smockfrock and the master
made at them scattering forms and boys in his career Even now they
might have escaped but that in the porch barring retreat appeared the
crafty wheelwright who had been watching all their proceedings So they
were seized the school dismissed and Tom and Jacob led away to Squire
Brown as lawful prize the boys following to the gate in groups and
speculating on the result

The Squire was very angry at first but the interview by Toms
pleading ended in a compromise Tom was not to go near the school till
three oclock and only then if he had done his own lessons well in
which case he was to be the bearer of a note to the master from Squire
Brown and the master agreed in such case to release ten or twelve of
the best boys an hour before the time of breaking up to go off and play
in the close The wheelwrights adzes and swallows were to be for ever
respected and that hero and the master withdrew to the servants hall
to drink the Squires health well satisfied with their days work

The second act of Toms life may now be said to have begun The war of
independence had been over for some time none of the women nownot
even his mothers maiddared offer to help him in dressing or
washing Between ourselves he had often at first to run to Benjy in an
unfinished state of toilet Charity and the rest of them seemed to take
a delight in putting impossible buttons and ties in the middle of his
back but he would have gone without nether integuments altogether
sooner than have had recourse to female valeting He had a room to
himself and his father gave him sixpence a week pocketmoney All
this he had achieved by Benjys advice and assistance But now he had
conquered another step in lifethe step which all real boys so long
to make he had got amongst his equals in age and strength and could
measure himself with other boys he lived with those whose pursuits and
wishes and ways were the same in kind as his own

The little governess who had lately been installed in the house found
her work grow wondrously easy for Tom slaved at his lessons in order
to make sure of his note to the schoolmaster So there were very few
days in the week in which Tom and the village boys were not playing
in their close by three oclock Prisoners base rounders
highcockalorum cricket footballhe was soon initiated into the
delights of them all and though most of the boys were older than
himself he managed to hold his own very well He was naturally active
and strong and quick of eye and hand and had the advantage of light
shoes and wellfitting dress so that in a short time he could run and
jump and climb with any of them

They generally finished their regular games half an hour or so before
teatime and then began trials of skill and strength in many ways Some
of them would catch the Shetland pony who was turned out in the field
and get two or three together on his back and the little rogue
enjoying the fun would gallop off for fifty yards and then turn round
or stop short and shoot them on to the turf and then graze quietly on
till he felt another load others played at pegtop or marbles while
a few of the bigger ones stood up for a bout at wrestling Tom at first
only looked on at this pastime but it had peculiar attractions for him
and he could not long keep out of it Elbow and collar wrestling as
practised in the western counties was next to backswording the way
to fame for the youth of the Vale and all the boys knew the rules of
it and were more or less expert But Job Rudkin and Harry Winburn were
the starsthe former stiff and sturdy with legs like small towers the
latter pliant as indiarubber and quick as lightning Day after day they
stood foot to foot and offered first one hand and then the other and
grappled and closed and swayed and strained till a wellaimed crook of
the heel or thrust of the loin took effect and a fair backfall ended
the matter And Tom watched with all his eyes and first challenged one
of the less scientific and threw him and so one by one wrestled his
way up to the leaders

Then indeed for months he had a poor time of it it was not long indeed
before he could manage to keep his legs against Job for that hero was
slow of offence and gained his victories chiefly by allowing others to
throw themselves against his immovable legs and loins But Harry Winburn
was undeniably his master from the first clutch of hands when they
stood up down to the last trip which sent him on to his back on the
turf he felt that Harry knew more and could do more than he Luckily
Harrys bright unconsciousness and Toms natural good temper kept them
from quarrelling and so Tom worked on and on and trod more and more
nearly on Harrys heels and at last mastered all the dodges and falls
except one This one was Harrys own particular invention and pet he
scarcely ever used it except when hard pressed but then out it came
and as sure as it did over went poor Tom He thought about that fall
at his meals in his walks when he lay awake in bed in his dreams but
all to no purpose until Harry one day in his open way suggested to him
how he thought it should be met and in a week from that time the boys
were equal save only the slight difference of strength in Harrys
favour which some extra ten months of age gave Tom had often
afterwards reason to be thankful for that early drilling and above all
for having mastered Harry Winburns fall

Besides their home games on Saturdays the boys would wander all over
the neighbourhood sometimes to the downs or up to the camp where
they cut their initials out in the springy turf and watched the hawks
soaring and the peert bird as Harry Winburn called the gray plover
gorgeous in his wedding feathers and so home racing down the Manger
with many a roll among the thistles or through Uffington Wood to watch
the fox cubs playing in the green rides sometimes to Rosy Brook to cut
long whispering reeds which grew there to make panpipes of sometimes
to Moor Mills where was a piece of old forest land with short browsed
turf and tufted brambly thickets stretching under the oaks amongst
which rumour declared that a raven last of his race still lingered
or to the sandhills in vain quest of rabbits and birdnesting in the
season anywhere and everywhere

The few neighbours of the Squires own rank every now and then would
shrug their shoulders as they drove or rode by a party of boys with Tom
in the middle carrying along bulrushes or whispering reeds or great
bundles of cowslip and meadowsweet or young starlings or magpies or
other spoil of wood brook or meadow and Lawyer Redtape might mutter
to Squire Straightback at the Board that no good would come of the
young Browns if they were let run wild with all the dirty village boys
whom the best farmers sons even would not play with And the squire
might reply with a shake of his head that his sons only mixed with
their equals and never went into the village without the governess or
a footman But luckily Squire Brown was full as stiffbacked as
his neighbours and so went on his own way and Tom and his younger
brothers as they grew up went on playing with the village boys
without the idea of equality or inequality except in wrestling
running and climbing ever entering their heads as it doesnt till
its put there by Jack Nastys or fine ladies maids

I dont mean to say it would be the case in all villages but it
certainly was so in this one the village boys were full as manly and
honest and certainly purer than those in a higher rank and Tom got
more harm from his equals in his first fortnight at a private school
where he went when he was nine years old than he had from his village
friends from the day he left Charitys apronstrings

Great was the grief amongst the village schoolboys when Tom drove off
with the Squire one August morning to meet the coach on his way to
school Each of them had given him some little present of the best that
he had and his small private box was full of pegtaps white marbles
called alleytaws in the Vale screws birds eggs whipcord
jewsharps and other miscellaneous boys wealth Poor Jacob
Doodlecalf in floods of tears had pressed upon him with spluttering
earnestness his lame pet hedgehog he had always some poor brokendown
beast or bird by him but this Tom had been obliged to refuse by the
Squires order He had given them all a great tea under the big elm in
their playground for which Madam Brown had supplied the biggest cake
ever seen in our village and Tom was really as sorry to leave them
as they to lose him but his sorrow was not unmixed with the pride and
excitement of making a new step in life

And this feeling carried him through his first parting with his mother
better than could have been expected Their love was as fair and whole
as human love can beperfect selfsacrifice on the one side meeting
a young and true heart on the other It is not within the scope of my
book however to speak of family relations or I should have much to
say on the subject of English mothersay and of English fathers and
sisters and brothers too Neither have I room to speak of our private
schools What I have to say is about public schoolsthose muchabused
and muchbelauded institutions peculiar to England So we must hurry
through Master Toms year at a private school as fast as we can

It was a fair average specimen kept by a gentleman with another
gentleman as second master but it was little enough of the real work
they didmerely coming into school when lessons were prepared and all
ready to be heard The whole discipline of the school out of lesson
hours was in the hands of the two ushers one of whom was always with
the boys in their playground in the school at mealsin fact at all
times and every where till they were fairly in bed at night

Now the theory of private schools is or was constant supervision out
of schooltherein differing fundamentally from that of public schools

It may be right or wrong but if right this supervision surely ought
to be the especial work of the headmaster the responsible person The
object of all schools is not to ram Latin and Greek into boys but to
make them good English boys good future citizens and by far the most
important part of that work must be done or not done out of school
hours To leave it therefore in the hands of inferior men is just
giving up the highest and hardest part of the work of education Were I
a private schoolmaster I should say Let who will hear the boys their
lessons but let me live with them when they are at play and rest

The two ushers at Toms first school were not gentlemen and very poorly
educated and were only driving their poor trade of usher to get such
living as they could out of it They were not bad men but had little
heart for their work and of course were bent on making it as easy as
possible One of the methods by which they endeavoured to accomplish
this was by encouraging talebearing which had become a frightfully
common vice in the school in consequence and had sapped all the
foundations of school morality Another was by favouring grossly the
biggest boys who alone could have given them much trouble whereby
those young gentlemen became most abominable tyrants oppressing the
little boys in all the small mean ways which prevail in private schools

Poor little Tom was made dreadfully unhappy in his first week by a
catastrophe which happened to his first letter home With huge labour he
had on the very evening of his arrival managed to fill two sides of
a sheet of letterpaper with assurances of his love for dear mamma his
happiness at school and his resolves to do all she would wish This
missive with the help of the boy who sat at the desk next him also a
new arrival he managed to fold successfully but this done they were
sadly put to it for means of sealing Envelopes were then unknown
they had no wax and dared not disturb the stillness of the evening
schoolroom by getting up and going to ask the usher for some At length
Toms friend being of an ingenious turn of mind suggested sealing with
ink and the letter was accordingly stuck down with a blob of ink and
duly handed by Tom on his way to bed to the housekeeper to be posted
It was not till four days afterwards that the good dame sent for him
and produced the precious letter and some wax saying O Master Brown
I forgot to tell you before but your letter isnt sealed Poor Tom
took the wax in silence and sealed his letter with a huge lump rising
in his throat during the process and then ran away to a quiet corner of
the playground and burst into an agony of tears The idea of his mother
waiting day after day for the letter he had promised her at once and
perhaps thinking him forgetful of her when he had done all in his power
to make good his promise was as bitter a grief as any which he had
to undergo for many a long year His wrath then was proportionately
violent when he was aware of two boys who stopped close by him and one
of whom a fat gaby of a fellow pointed at him and called him Young
mammysick Whereupon Tom arose and giving vent thus to his grief and
shame and rage smote his derider on the nose and made it bleed
which sent that young worthy howling to the usher who reported Tom for
violent and unprovoked assault and battery Hitting in the face was a
felony punishable with flogging other hitting only a misdemeanoura
distinction not altogether clear in principle Tom however escaped the
penalty by pleading primum tempus and having written a second letter
to his mother inclosing some forgetmenots which he picked on their
first halfholiday walk felt quite happy again and began to enjoy
vastly a good deal of his new life

These halfholiday walks were the great events of the week The whole
fifty boys started after dinner with one of the ushers for Hazeldown
which was distant some mile or so from the school Hazeldown measured
some three miles round and in the neighbourhood were several woods full
of all manner of birds and butterflies The usher walked slowly round
the down with such boys as liked to accompany him the rest scattered
in all directions being only bound to appear again when the usher
had completed his round and accompany him home They were forbidden
however to go anywhere except on the down and into the woods the
village had been especially prohibited where huge bullseyes and
unctuous toffy might be procured in exchange for coin of the realm

Various were the amusements to which the boys then betook themselves At
the entrance of the down there was a steep hillock like the barrows of
Toms own downs This mound was the weekly scene of terrific combats
at a game called by the queer name of mudpatties The boys who played
divided into sides under different leaders and one side occupied the
mound Then all parties having provided themselves with many sods of
turf cut with their breadandcheese knives the side which remained
at the bottom proceeded to assault the mound advancing up on all sides
under cover of a heavy fire of turfs and then struggling for victory
with the occupants which was theirs as soon as they could even for a
moment clear the summit when they in turn became the besieged It
was a good rough dirty game and of great use in counteracting the
sneaking tendencies of the school Then others of the boys spread over
the downs looking for the holes of humblebees and mice which they
dug up without mercy often I regret to say killing and skinning the
unlucky mice and I do not regret to say getting well stung by the
bumblebees Others went after butterflies and birds eggs in their
seasons and Tom found on Hazeldown for the first time the beautiful
little blue butterfly with golden spots on his wings which he had never
seen on his own downs and dug out his first sandmartins nest This
latter achievement resulted in a flogging for the sandmartins built in
a high bank close to the village consequently out of bounds but one of
the bolder spirits of the school who never could be happy unless he
was doing something to which risk was attached easily persuaded Tom to
break bounds and visit the martins bank From whence it being only a
step to the toffy shop what could be more simple than to go on there
and fill their pockets or what more certain than that on their return
a distribution of treasure having been made the usher should shortly
detect the forbidden smell of bullseyes and a search ensuing
discover the state of the breechespockets of Tom and his ally

This ally of Toms was indeed a desperate hero in the sight of the boys
and feared as one who dealt in magic or something approaching thereto
Which reputation came to him in this wise The boys went to bed at
eight and of course consequently lay awake in the dark for an hour or
two telling ghoststories by turns One night when it came to his turn
and he had dried up their souls by his story he suddenly declared that
he would make a fiery hand appear on the door and to the astonishment
and terror of the boys in his room a hand or something like it in
pale light did then and there appear The fame of this exploit having
spread to the other rooms and being discredited there the young
necromancer declared that the same wonder would appear in all the rooms
in turn which it accordingly did and the whole circumstances having
been privately reported to one of the ushers as usual that functionary
after listening about at the doors of the rooms by a sudden descent
caught the performer in his nightshirt with a box of phosphorus in his
guilty hand Lucifermatches and all the present facilities for getting
acquainted with fire were then unknownthe very name of phosphorus had
something diabolic in it to the boymind so Toms ally at the cost
of a sound flogging earned what many older folk covet muchthe very
decided fear of most of his companions

He was a remarkable boy and by no means a bad one Tom stuck to him
till he left and got into many scrapes by so doing But he was the
great opponent of the talebearing habits of the school and the open
enemy of the ushers and so worthy of all support

Tom imbibed a fair amount of Latin and Greek at the school but somehow
on the whole it didnt suit him or he it and in the holidays he was
constantly working the Squire to send him at once to a public school
Great was his joy then when in the middle of his third halfyear in
October 183 a fever broke out in the village and the master having
himself slightly sickened of it the whole of the boys were sent off at
a days notice to their respective homes

The Squire was not quite so pleased as Master Tom to see that young
gentlemans brown merry face appear at home some two months before the
proper time for the Christmas holidays and so after putting on his
thinking cap he retired to his study and wrote several letters the
result of which was that one morning at the breakfasttable about a
fortnight after Toms return he addressed his wife withMy dear I
have arranged that Tom shall go to Rugby at once for the last six weeks
of this halfyear instead of wasting them in riding and loitering about
home It is very kind of the doctor to allow it Will you see that his
things are all ready by Friday when I shall take him up to town and
send him down the next day by himself

Mrs Brown was prepared for the announcement and merely suggested a
doubt whether Tom were yet old enough to travel by himself However
finding both father and son against her on this point she gave in like
a wise woman and proceeded to prepare Toms kit for his launch into a
public school



CHAPTER IVTHE STAGE COACH


 Let the steampot hiss till its hot
 Give me the speed of the Tantivy trot
 Coaching Song by REE Warburton Esq

Now sir time to get up if you please Tallyho coach for
Leicesterll be round in half an hour and dont wait for nobody So
spake the boots of the Peacock Inn Islington at halfpast two oclock
on the morning of a day in the early part of November 183 giving
Tom at the same time a shake by the shoulder and then putting down a
candle and carrying off his shoes to clean

Tom and his father arrived in town from Berkshire the day before and
finding on inquiry that the Birmingham coaches which ran from the city
did not pass through Rugby but deposited their passengers at Dunchurch
a village three miles distant on the main road where said passengers
had to wait for the Oxford and Leicester coach in the evening or to
take a postchaise had resolved that Tom should travel down by the
Tallyho which diverged from the main road and passed through Rugby
itself And as the Tallyho was an early coach they had driven out to
the Peacock to be on the road

Tom had never been in London and would have liked to have stopped at
the Belle Savage where they had been put down by the Star just at
dusk that he might have gone roving about those endless mysterious
gaslit streets which with their glare and hum and moving crowds
excited him so that he couldnt talk even But as soon as he found that
the Peacock arrangement would get him to Rugby by twelve oclock in the
day whereas otherwise he wouldnt be there till the evening all
other plans melted away his one absorbing aim being to become a public
schoolboy as fast as possible and six hours sooner or later seeming to
him of the most alarming importance

Tom and his father had alighted at the Peacock at about seven in the
evening and having heard with unfeigned joy the paternal order at the
bar of steaks and oystersauce for supper in half an hour and seen
his father seated cozily by the bright fire in the coffeeroom with the
paper in his hand Tom had run out to see about him had wondered at all
the vehicles passing and repassing and had fraternized with the boots
and hostler from whom he ascertained that the Tallyho was a tiptop
goerten miles an hour including stoppagesand so punctual that all
the road set their clocks by her

Then being summoned to supper he had regaled himself in one of the
bright little boxes of the Peacock coffeeroom on the beefsteak
and unlimited oystersauce and brown stout tasted then for the first
timea day to be marked for ever by Tom with a white stone had at
first attended to the excellent advice which his father was bestowing
on him from over his glass of steaming brandyandwater and then
began nodding from the united effects of the stout the fire and the
lecture till the Squire observing Toms state and remembering that it
was nearly nine oclock and that the Tallyho left at three sent the
little fellow off to the chambermaid with a shake of the hand Tom
having stipulated in the morning before starting that kissing should now
cease between them and a few parting words

And now Tom my boy said the Squire remember you are going at
your own earnest request to be chucked into this great school like a
young bear with all your troubles before youearlier than we should
have sent you perhaps If schools are what they were in my time youll
see a great many cruel blackguard things done and hear a deal of foul
bad talk But never fear You tell the truth keep a brave and kind
heart and never listen to or say anything you wouldnt have your mother
and sister hear and youll never feel ashamed to come home or we to
see you

The allusion to his mother made Tom feel rather choky and he would have
liked to have hugged his father well if it hadnt been for the recent
stipulation

As it was he only squeezed his fathers hand and looked bravely up and
said Ill try father

I know you will my boy Is your money all safe

Yes said Tom diving into one pocket to make sure

And your keys said the Squire

All right said Tom diving into the other pocket

Well then goodnight God bless you Ill tell boots to call you and
be up to see you off

Tom was carried off by the chambermaid in a brown study from which he
was roused in a clean little attic by that buxom person calling him a
little darling and kissing him as she left the room which indignity
he was too much surprised to resent And still thinking of his fathers
last words and the look with which they were spoken he knelt down and
prayed that come what might he might never bring shame or sorrow on
the dear folk at home

Indeed the Squires last words deserved to have their effect for they
had been the result of much anxious thought All the way up to London
he had pondered what he should say to Tom by way of parting
advicesomething that the boy could keep in his head ready for use By
way of assisting meditation he had even gone the length of taking out
his flint and steel and tinder and hammering away for a quarter of an
hour till he had manufactured a light for a long Trichinopoli cheroot
which he silently puffed to the no small wonder of coachee who was an
old friend and an institution on the Bath road and who always expected
a talk on the prospects and doings agricultural and social of the
whole country when he carried the Squire

To condense the Squires meditation it was somewhat as follows I
wont tell him to read his Bible and love and serve God if he dont do
that for his mothers sake and teaching he wont for mine Shall I go
into the sort of temptations hell meet with No I cant do that
Never do for an old fellow to go into such things with a boy He wont
understand me Do him more harm than good ten to one Shall I tell him
to mind his work and say hes sent to school to make himself a good
scholar Well but he isnt sent to school for thatat any rate
not for that mainly I dont care a straw for Greek particles or the
digamma no more does his mother What is he sent to school for Well
partly because he wanted so to go If hell only turn out a brave
helpful truthtelling Englishman and a gentleman and a Christian
thats all I want thought the Squire and upon this view of the case
he framed his last words of advice to Tom which were well enough suited
to his purpose

For they were Toms first thoughts as he tumbled out of bed at the
summons of boots and proceeded rapidly to wash and dress himself At
ten minutes to three he was down in the coffeeroom in his stockings
carrying his hatbox coat and comforter in his hand and there he
found his father nursing a bright fire and a cup of hot coffee and a
hard biscuit on the table

Now then Tom give us your things here and drink this Theres
nothing like starting warm old fellow

Tom addressed himself to the coffee and prattled away while he worked
himself into his shoes and his greatcoat well warmed througha
Petersham coat with velvet collar made tight after the abominable
fashion of those days And just as he is swallowing his last mouthful
winding his comforter round his throat and tucking the ends into the
breast of his coat the horn sounds boots looks in and says Tallyho
sir and they hear the ring and the rattle of the four fast trotters
and the townmade drag as it dashes up to the Peacock

Anything for us Bob says the burly guard dropping down from behind
and slapping himself across the chest

Young genlmn Rugby three parcels Leicester hamper o game
Rugby answers hostler

Tell young gent to look alive says guard opening the hindboot and
shooting in the parcels after examining them by the lamps Here shove
the portmanteau up atop Ill fasten him presentlyNow then sir
jump up behind

Goodbye fathermy love at home A last shake of the hand Up goes
Tom the guard catching his hatbox and holding on with one hand while
with the other he claps the horn to his mouth Toot toot toot the
hostlers let go their heads the four bays plunge at the collar and
away goes the Tallyho into the darkness fortyfive seconds from the
time they pulled up Hostler boots and the Squire stand looking after
them under the Peacock lamp

Sharp work says the Squire and goes in again to his bed the coach
being well out of sight and hearing

Tom stands up on the coach and looks back at his fathers figure as long
as he can see it and then the guard having disposed of his luggage
comes to an anchor and finishes his buttonings and other preparations
for facing the three hours before dawnno joke for those who minded
cold on a fast coach in November in the reign of his late Majesty

I sometimes think that you boys of this generation are a deal tenderer
fellows than we used to be At any rate youre much more comfortable
travellers for I see every one of you with his rug or plaid and other
dodges for preserving the caloric and most of you going in those
fuzzy dusty padded firstclass carriages It was another affair
altogether a dark ride on the top of the Tallyho I can tell you in a
tight Petersham coat and your feet dangling six inches from the floor
Then you knew what cold was and what it was to be without legs for not
a bit of feeling had you in them after the first halfhour But it had
its pleasures the old dark ride First there was the consciousness of
silent endurance so dear to every Englishmanof standing out against
something and not giving in Then there was the music of the rattling
harness and the ring of the horses feet on the hard road and the
glare of the two bright lamps through the steaming hoar frost over the
leaders ears into the darkness and the cheery toot of the guards
horn to warn some drowsy pikeman or the hostler at the next change and
the looking forward to daylight and last but not least the delight of
returning sensation in your toes

Then the break of dawn and the sunrise where can they be ever seen in
perfection but from a coach roof You want motion and change and music
to see them in their glorynot the music of singing men and singing
women but good silent music which sets itself in your own head the
accompaniment of work and getting over the ground

The Tallyho is past St Albans and Tom is enjoying the ride though
halffrozen The guard who is alone with him on the back of the coach
is silent but has muffled Toms feet up in straw and put the end of an
oatsack over his knees The darkness has driven him inwards and he
has gone over his little past life and thought of all his doings and
promises and of his mother and sister and his fathers last words and
has made fifty good resolutions and means to bear himself like a brave
Brown as he is though a young one Then he has been forward into the
mysterious boyfuture speculating as to what sort of place Rugby is
and what they do there and calling up all the stories of public schools
which he has heard from big boys in the holidays He is chokefull of
hope and life notwithstanding the cold and kicks his heels against the
backboard and would like to sing only he doesnt know how his friend
the silent guard might take it

And now the dawn breaks at the end of the fourth stage and the coach
pulls up at a little roadside inn with huge stables behind There is a
bright fire gleaming through the red curtains of the bar window and
the door is open The coachman catches his whip into a double thong and
throws it to the hostler the steam of the horses rises straight up
into the air He has put them along over the last two miles and is two
minutes before his time He rolls down from the box and into the inn
The guard rolls off behind Now sir says he to Tom you just jump
down and Ill give you a drop of something to keep the cold out

Tom finds a difficulty in jumping or indeed in finding the top of the
wheel with his feet which may be in the next world for all he feels
so the guard picks him off the coach top and sets him on his legs and
they stump off into the bar and join the coachman and the other outside
passengers

Here a freshlooking barmaid serves them each with a glass of early purl
as they stand before the fire coachman and guard exchanging business
remarks The purl warms the cockles of Toms heart and makes him cough

Rare tackle that sir of a cold morning says the coachman smiling
Times up They are out again and up coachee the last gathering the
reins into his hands and talking to Jem the hostler about the mares
shoulder and then swinging himself up on to the boxthe horses dashing
off in a canter before he falls into his seat Toottoottootletoo goes
the horn and away they are again fiveandthirty miles on their road
nearly halfway to Rugby thinks Tom and the prospect of breakfast at
the end of the stage

And now they begin to see and the early life of the countryside comes
outa market cart or two men in smockfrocks going to their work pipe
in mouth a whiff of which is no bad smell this bright morning The sun
gets up and the mist shines like silver gauze They pass the hounds
jogging along to a distant meet at the heels of the huntsmans back
whose face is about the colour of the tails of his old pink as he
exchanges greetings with coachman and guard Now they pull up at a
lodge and take on board a wellmuffledup sportsman with his guncase
and carpetbag An early upcoach meets them and the coachmen gather
up their horses and pass one another with the accustomed lift of the
elbow each team doing eleven miles an hour with a mile to spare behind
if necessary And here comes breakfast

Twenty minutes here gentlemen says the coachman as they pull up at
halfpast seven at the inndoor

Have we not endured nobly this morning and is not this a worthy reward
for much endurance There is the low dark wainscoted room hung with
sporting prints the hatstand with a whip or two standing up in it
belonging to bagmen who are still snug in bed by the door the blazing
fire with the quaint old glass over the mantelpiece in which is stuck
a large card with the list of the meets for the week of the county
hounds the table covered with the whitest of cloths and of china and
bearing a pigeonpie ham round of cold boiled beef cut from a mammoth
ox and the great loaf of household bread on a wooden trencher And
here comes in the stout head waiter puffing under a tray of hot
viandskidneys and a steak transparent rashers and poached eggs
buttered toast and muffins coffee and tea all smoking hot The table
can never hold it all The cold meats are removed to the sideboardthey
were only put on for show and to give us an appetite And now fall on
gentlemen all It is a wellknown sportinghouse and the breakfasts are
famous Two or three men in pink on their way to the meet drop in and
are very jovial and sharpset as indeed we all are

Tea or coffee sir says head waiter coming round to Tom

Coffee please says Tom with his mouth full of muffin and kidney
Coffee is a treat to him tea is not

Our coachman I perceive who breakfasts with us is a cold beef man
He also eschews hot potations and addicts himself to a tankard of ale
which is brought him by the barmaid Sportsman looks on approvingly and
orders a ditto for himself

Tom has eaten kidney and pigeonpie and imbibed coffee till his little
skin is as tight as a drum and then has the further pleasure of paying
head waiter out of his own purse in a dignified manner and walks out
before the inndoor to see the horses put to This is done leisurely and
in a highlyfinished manner by the hostlers as if they enjoyed the not
being hurried Coachman comes out with his waybill and puffing a fat
cigar which the sportsman has given him Guard emerges from the tap
where he prefers breakfasting licking round a toughlooking doubtful
cheroot which you might tie round your finger and three whiffs of
which would knock any one else out of time

The pinks stand about the inndoor lighting cigars and waiting to see us
start while their hacks are led up and down the marketplace on which
the inn looks They all know our sportsman and we feel a reflected
credit when we see him chatting and laughing with them

Now sir please says the coachman All the rest of the passengers
are up the guard is locking up the hindboot

A good run to you says the sportsman to the pinks and is by the
coachmans side in no time

Let em go Dick The hostlers fly back drawing off the cloths from
their glossy loins and away we go through the marketplace and down the
High Street looking in at the firstfloor windows and seeing several
worthy burgesses shaving thereat while all the shopboys who are
cleaning the windows and housemaids who are doing the steps stop and
look pleased as we rattle past as if we were a part of their legitimate
mornings amusement We clear the town and are well out between the
hedgerows again as the town clock strikes eight

The sun shines almost warmly and breakfast has oiled all springs
and loosened all tongues Tom is encouraged by a remark or two of the
guards between the puffs of his oily cheroot and besides is getting
tired of not talking He is too full of his destination to talk about
anything else and so asks the guard if he knows Rugby

Goes through it every day of my life Twenty minutes afore twelve
downten oclock up

What sort of place is it please says Tom

Guard looks at him with a comical expression Werry outotheway
place sir no paving to streets nor no lighting Mazin big horse and
cattle fair in autumnlasts a weekjust over now Takes town a week to
get clean after it Fairish hunting country But slow place sir slow
placeoff the main road you seeonly three coaches a day and one on
em a twooss wan more like a hearse nor a coachRegulatorcomes from
Oxford Young genlmn at school calls her Pig and Whistle and goes up
to college by her six miles an hour when they goes to enter Belong to
school sir

Yes says Tom not unwilling for a moment that the guard should think
him an old boy But then having some qualms as to the truth of the
assertion and seeing that if he were to assume the character of an old
boy he couldnt go on asking the questions he wanted addedThat is to
say Im on my way there Im a new boy

The guard looked as if he knew this quite as well as Tom

Youre werry late sir says the guard only six weeks today to the
end of the half Tom assented We takes up fine loads this day six
weeks and Monday and Tuesday arter Hopes we shall have the pleasure of
carrying you back

Tom said he hoped they would but he thought within himself that his
fate would probably be the Pig and Whistle

It pays uncommon certnly continues the guard Werry free with their
cash is the young genlmn But Lor bless you we gets into such rows
all long the road what wi their peashooters and long whips and
hollering and upsetting every one as comes by Id a sight sooner
carry one or two on em sir as I may be acarryin of you now than a
coachload

What do they do with the peashooters inquires Tom

Do wi em Why peppers every ones faces as we comes near cept the
young gals and breaks windows wi them too some on em shoots so hard
Now twas just here last June as we was adriving up the firstday
boys they was mendin a quartermile of road and there was a lot of
Irish chaps reglar roughs abreaking stones As we comes up Now
boys says young gent on the box smart young fellow and despert
reckless heres fun Let the Pats have it about the ears Gods
sake sir says Bob thats my mate the coachman dont go for to
shoot at em Theyll knock us off the coach Damme coachee says
young my lord you aint afraidHoora boys let em have it
Hoora sings out the others and fill their mouths chokefull of peas
to last the whole line Bob seeing as twas to come knocks his hat
over his eyes hollers to his osses and shakes em up and away we goes
up to the line on em twenty miles an hour The Pats begin to hoora
too thinking it was a runaway and first lot on em stands grinnin
and wavin their old hats as we comes abreast on em and then youd ha
laughed to see how took aback and choking savage they looked when they
gets the peas astinging all over em But bless you the laugh werent
all of our side sir by a long way We was going so fast and they was
so took aback that they didnt take what was up till we was halfway
up the line Then twas Look out all surely They howls all down the
line fit to frighten you some on em runs arter us and tries to clamber
up behind only we hits em over the fingers and pulls their hands off
one as had had it very sharp actly runs right at the leaders as though
hed ketch em by the heads only luckly for him he misses his tip and
comes over a heap o stones first The rest picks up stones and gives
it us right away till we gets out of shot the young gents holding out
werry manful with the peashooters and such stones as lodged on us and
a pretty many there was too Then Bob picks hisself up again and looks
at young gent on box werry solemn Bobd had a rum un in the ribs
whichd like to ha knocked him off the box or made him drop the reins
Young gent on box picks hisself up and so does we all and looks round
to count damage Boxs head cut open and his hat gone nother young
gents hat gone mine knocked in at the side and not one on us as
wasnt black and blue somewheres or another most on em all over Two
pound ten to pay for damage to paint which they subscribed for there
and then and give Bob and me a extra halfsovereign each but I
wouldnt go down that line again not for twenty halfsovereigns And
the guard shook his head slowly and got up and blew a clear brisk
toottoot

What fun said Tom who could scarcely contain his pride at this
exploit of his future schoolfellows He longed already for the end of
the half that he might join them

Taint such good fun though sir for the folk as meets the coach nor
for we who has to go back with it next day Them Irishers last summer
had all got stones ready for us and was all but letting drive and wed
got two reverend gents aboard too We pulled up at the beginning of
the line and pacified them and were never going to carry no more
peashooters unless they promises not to fire where theres a line of
Irish chaps astonebreaking The guard stopped and pulled away at his
cheroot regarding Tom benignantly the while

Oh dont stop Tell us something more about the peashooting

Well thered like to have been a pretty piece of work over it at
Bicester a while back We was six mile from the town when we meets an
old squareheaded grayhaired yeoman chap ajogging along quite quiet
He looks up at the coach and just then a pea hits him on the nose and
some catches his cob behind and makes him dance up on his hind legs I
seed the old boys face flush and look plaguy awkward and I thought we
was in for somethin nasty

He turns his cobs head and rides quietly after us just out of shot
How that ere cob did step We never shook him off not a dozen yards
in the six miles At first the young gents was werry lively on him but
afore we got in seeing how steady the old chap come on they was quite
quiet and laid their heads together what they should do Some was for
fighting some for axing his pardon He rides into the town close after
us comes up when we stops and says the two as shot at him must come
before a magistrate and a great crowd comes round and we couldnt get
the osses to But the young uns they all stand by one another and says
all or none must go and as how theyd fight it out and have to be
carried Just as twas gettin serious and the old boy and the mob was
going to pull em off the coach one little fellow jumps up and says
HereIll stay Im only going three miles farther My fathers names
Davis hes known about here and Ill go before the magistrate with
this gentleman What be thee parson Daviss son says the old boy
Yes says the young un Well I be mortal sorry to meet thee in such
company but for thy fathers sake and thine for thee bist a brave
young chap Ill say no more about it Didnt the boys cheer him and
the mob cheered the young chap and then one of the biggest gets down
and begs his pardon werry gentlemanly for all the rest saying as they
all had been plaguy vexed from the first but didnt like to ax his
pardon till then cause they felt they hadnt ought to shirk the
consequences of their joke And then they all got down and shook hands
with the old boy and asked him to all parts of the country to their
homes and we drives off twenty minutes behind time with cheering and
hollering as if we was county members But Lor bless you sir says
the guard smacking his hand down on his knee and looking full into
Toms face ten minutes arter they was all as bad as ever

Tom showed such undisguised and openmouthed interest in his narrations
that the old guard rubbed up his memory and launched out into a graphic
history of all the performances of the boys on the roads for the last
twenty years Off the road he couldnt go the exploit must have been
connected with horses or vehicles to hang in the old fellows head Tom
tried him off his own ground once or twice but found he knew nothing
beyond and so let him have his head and the rest of the road bowled
easily away for old Blowhard as the boys called him was a dry old
file with much kindness and humour and a capital spinner of a yarn
when he had broken the neck of his days work and got plenty of ale
under his belt

What struck Toms youthful imagination most was the desperate and
lawless character of most of the stories Was the guard hoaxing him He
couldnt help hoping that they were true Its very odd how almost all
English boys love danger You can get ten to join a game or climb a
tree or swim a stream when theres a chance of breaking their limbs or
getting drowned for one wholl stay on level ground or in his depth
or play quoits or bowls

The guard had just finished an account of a desperate fight which had
happened at one of the fairs between the drovers and the farmers with
their whips and the boys with cricketbats and wickets which arose out
of a playful but objectionable practice of the boys going round to the
publichouses and taking the linchpins out of the wheels of the gigs
and was moralizing upon the way in which the Doctor a terrible stern
man hed heard tell had come down upon several of the performers
sending three on em off next morning in a poshay with a parish
constable when they turned a corner and neared the milestone the
third from Rugby By the stone two boys stood their jackets buttoned
tight waiting for the coach

Look here sir says the guard after giving a sharp toottoot
theres two on em outandout runners they be They comes out about
twice or three times a week and spirts a mile alongside of us

And as they came up sure enough away went two boys along the footpath
keeping up with the horsesthe first a light cleanmade fellow going
on springs the other stout and roundshouldered labouring in his pace
but going as dogged as a bullterrier

Old Blowhard looked on admiringly See how beautiful that there un
holds hisself together and goes from his hips sir said he hes a
mazin fine runner Now many coachmen as drives a firstrate teamd
put it on and try and pass em But Bob sir bless you hes
tenderhearted hed sooner pull in a bit if he seed em agettin
beat I do blieve too as that there und sooner break his heart than
let us go by him afore next milestone

At the second milestone the boys pulled up short and waved their
hats to the guard who had his watch out and shouted 456 thereby
indicating that the mile had been done in four seconds under the five
minutes They passed several more parties of boys all of them objects
of the deepest interest to Tom and came in sight of the town at ten
minutes before twelve Tom fetched a long breath and thought he had
never spent a pleasanter day Before he went to bed he had quite settled
that it must be the greatest day he should ever spend and didnt alter
his opinion for many a long yearif he has yet



CHAPTER VRUGBY AND FOOTBALL


 Foot and eye opposed
 In dubious strifeScott

And so heres Rugby sir at last and youll be in plenty of time
for dinner at the Schoolhouse as I telled you said the old guard
pulling his horn out of its case and tootletooing away while the
coachman shook up his horses and carried them along the side of the
school close round Deadmans corner past the schoolgates and down
the High Street to the Spread Eagle the wheelers in a spanking trot
and leaders cantering in a style which would not have disgraced Cherry
Bob ramping stamping tearing swearing Billy Harwood or any other
of the old coaching heroes

Toms heart beat quick as he passed the great schoolfield or close with
its noble elms in which several games at football were going on and
tried to take in at once the long line of gray buildings beginning
with the chapel and ending with the Schoolhouse the residence of the
headmaster where the great flag was lazily waving from the highest
round tower And he began already to be proud of being a Rugby boy as
he passed the schoolgates with the oriel window above and saw the boys
standing there looking as if the town belonged to them and nodding in
a familiar manner to the coachman as if any one of them would be quite
equal to getting on the box and working the team down street as well as
he

One of the young heroes however ran out from the rest and scrambled
up behind where having righted himself and nodded to the guard with
How do Jem he turned short round to Tom and after looking him over
for a minute began

I say you fellow is your name Brown

Yes said Tom in considerable astonishment glad however to have
lighted on some one already who seemed to know him

Ah I thought so You know my old aunt Miss East She lives somewhere
down your way in Berkshire She wrote to me that you were coming today
and asked me to give you a lift

Tom was somewhat inclined to resent the patronizing air of his new
friend a boy of just about his own height and age but gifted with
the most transcendent coolness and assurance which Tom felt to be
aggravating and hard to bear but couldnt for the life of him help
admiring and envyingespecially when young my lord begins hectoring
two or three long loafing fellows half porter half stableman with
a strong touch of the blackguard and in the end arranges with one of
them nicknamed Cooey to carry Toms luggage up to the Schoolhouse for
sixpence

And hark ee Cooey it must be up in ten minutes or no more jobs from
me Come along Brown And away swaggers the young potentate with his
hands in his pockets and Tom at his side

All right sir says Cooey touching his hat with a leer and a wink
at his companions

Hullo though says East pulling up and taking another look at Tom
thisll never do Havent you got a hat We never wear caps here Only
the louts wear caps Bless you if you were to go into the quadrangle
with that thing on I dont know whatd happen The very idea was quite
beyond young Master East and he looked unutterable things

Tom thought his cap a very knowing affair but confessed that he had
a hat in his hatbox which was accordingly at once extracted from the
hindboot and Tom equipped in his gotomeeting roof as his new friend
called it But this didnt quite suit his fastidious taste in another
minute being too shiny so as they walk up the town they dive into
Nixons the hatters and Tom is arrayed to his utter astonishment and
without paying for it in a regulation catskin at sevenandsixpence
Nixon undertaking to send the best hat up to the matrons room
Schoolhouse in half an hour

You can send in a note for a tile on Monday and make it all right you
know said Mentor were allowed two sevenandsixers a half besides
what we bring from home

Tom by this time began to be conscious of his new social position and
dignities and to luxuriate in the realized ambition of being a public
schoolboy at last with a vested right of spoiling two sevenandsixers
in half a year

You see said his friend as they strolled up towards the
schoolgates in explanation of his conduct a great deal depends on
how a fellow cuts up at first If hes got nothing odd about him and
answers straightforward and holds his head up he gets on Now youll
do very well as to rig all but that cap You see Im doing the handsome
thing by you because my father knows yours besides I want to please
the old lady She gave me half a sov this half and perhapsll double
it next if I keep in her good books

Theres nothing for candour like a lowerschool boy and East was a
genuine specimenfrank hearty and goodnatured wellsatisfied with
himself and his position and chokefull of life and spirits and
all the Rugby prejudices and traditions which he had been able to get
together in the long course of one halfyear during which he had been at
the Schoolhouse

And Tom notwithstanding his bumptiousness felt friends with him at
once and began sucking in all his ways and prejudices as fast as he
could understand them

East was great in the character of cicerone He carried Tom through
the great gates where were only two or three boys These satisfied
themselves with the stock questions You fellow whats your name
Where do you come from How old are you Where do you board and What
form are you in And so they passed on through the quadrangle and
a small courtyard upon which looked down a lot of little windows
belonging as his guide informed him to some of the Schoolhouse
studies into the matrons room where East introduced Tom to that
dignitary made him give up the key of his trunk that the matron might
unpack his linen and told the story of the hat and of his own presence
of mind upon the relation whereof the matron laughingly scolded him for
the coolest new boy in the house and East indignant at the accusation
of newness marched Tom off into the quadrangle and began showing
him the schools and examining him as to his literary attainments the
result of which was a prophecy that they would be in the same form and
could do their lessons together

And now come in and see my studywe shall have just time before
dinner and afterwards before calling over well do the close

Tom followed his guide through the Schoolhouse hall which opens into
the quadrangle It is a great room thirty feet long and eighteen high
or thereabouts with two great tables running the whole length and
two large fireplaces at the side with blazing fires in them at one of
which some dozen boys were standing and lounging some of whom shouted
to East to stop but he shot through with his convoy and landed him
in the long dark passages with a large fire at the end of each upon
which the studies opened Into one of these in the bottom passage East
bolted with our hero slamming and bolting the door behind them in
case of pursuit from the hall and Tom was for the first time in a Rugby
boys citadel

He hadnt been prepared for separate studies and was not a little
astonished and delighted with the palace in question

It wasnt very large certainly being about six feet long by four
broad It couldnt be called light as there were bars and a grating to
the window which little precautions were necessary in the studies on
the groundfloor looking out into the close to prevent the exit of
small boys after locking up and the entrance of contraband articles
But it was uncommonly comfortable to look at Tom thought The space
under the window at the farther end was occupied by a square table
covered with a reasonably clean and whole red and blue check tablecloth
a hardseated sofa covered with red stuff occupied one side running up
to the end and making a seat for one or by sitting close for two at
the table and a good stout wooden chair afforded a seat to another boy
so that three could sit and work together The walls were wainscoted
halfway up the wainscot being covered with green baize the remainder
with a brightpatterned paper on which hung three or four prints of
dogs heads Grimaldi winning the Aylesbury steeplechase Amy Robsart
the reigning Waverley beauty of the day and Tom Crib in a posture
of defence which did no credit to the science of that hero if truly
represented Over the door were a row of hatpegs and on each side
bookcases with cupboards at the bottom shelves and cupboards being
filled indiscriminately with schoolbooks a cup or two a
mousetrap and candlesticks leather straps a fustian bag and some
curiouslooking articles which puzzled Tom not a little until his
friend explained that they were climbingirons and showed their use A
cricketbat and small fishingrod stood up in one corner

This was the residence of East and another boy in the same form and had
more interest for Tom than Windsor Castle or any other residence in
the British Isles For was he not about to become the joint owner of a
similar home the first place he could call his own Ones own What a
charm there is in the words How long it takes boy and man to find
out their worth How fast most of us hold on to themfaster and more
jealously the nearer we are to that general home into which we can
take nothing but must go naked as we came into the world When shall we
learn that he who multiplieth possessions multiplieth troubles and that
the one single use of things which we call our own is that they may be
his who hath need of them

And shall I have a study like this too said Tom

Yes of course youll be chummed with some fellow on Monday and you
can sit here till then

What nice places

Theyre well enough answered East patronizingly only uncommon cold
at nights sometimes Gowerthats my chumand I make a fire with paper
on the floor after supper generally only that makes it so smoky

But theres a big fire out in the passage said Tom

Precious little we get out of that though said East Jones the
praepostor has the study at the fire end and he has rigged up an iron
rod and green baize curtain across the passage which he draws at night
and sits there with his door open so he gets all the fire and hears if
we come out of our studies after eight or make a noise However hes
taken to sitting in the fifthform room lately so we do get a bit of
fire now sometimes only to keep a sharp lookout that he dont catch you
behind his curtain when he comes downthats all

A quarter past one now struck and the bell began tolling for dinner so
they went into the hall and took their places Tom at the very bottom
of the second table next to the praepostor who sat at the end to keep
order there and East a few paces higher And now Tom for the first
time saw his future schoolfellows in a body In they came some hot
and ruddy from football or long walks some pale and chilly from hard
reading in their studies some from loitering over the fire at
the pastrycooks dainty mortals bringing with them pickles and
saucebottles to help them with their dinners And a great bigbearded
man whom Tom took for a master began calling over the names while the
great joints were being rapidly carved on the third table in the
corner by the old verger and the housekeeper Toms turn came last and
meanwhile he was all eyes looking first with awe at the great man who
sat close to him and was helped first and who read a hardlooking book
all the time he was eating and when he got up and walked off to the
fire at the small boys round him some of whom were reading and the
rest talking in whispers to one another or stealing one anothers
bread or shooting pellets or digging their forks through the
tablecloth However notwithstanding his curiosity he managed to make
a capital dinner by the time the big man called Stand up and said
grace

As soon as dinner was over and Tom had been questioned by such of his
neighbours as were curious as to his birth parentage education and
other like matters East who evidently enjoyed his new dignity of
patron and mentor proposed having a look at the close which Tom
athirst for knowledge gladly assented to and they went out through the
quadrangle and past the big fives court into the great playground

Thats the chapel you see said East and there just behind it is
the place for fights You see its most out of the way of the masters
who all live on the other side and dont come by here after first
lesson or callingsover Thats when the fights come off And all this
part where we are is the littleside ground right up to the trees and
on the other side of the trees is the bigside ground where the great
matches are played And theres the island in the farthest corner
youll know that well enough next half when theres island fagging I
say its horrid cold lets have a run across And away went East Tom
close behind him East was evidently putting his best foot foremost and
Tom who was mighty proud of his running and not a little anxious
to show his friend that although a new boy he was no milksop laid
himself down to work in his very best style Right across the close they
went each doing all he knew and there wasnt a yard between them when
they pulled up at the island moat

I say said East as soon as he got his wind looking with much
increased respect at Tom you aint a bad scud not by no means Well
Im as warm as a toast now

But why do you wear white trousers in November said Tom He had been
struck by this peculiarity in the costume of almost all the Schoolhouse
boys

Why bless us dont you know No I forgot Why todays the
Schoolhouse match Our house plays the whole of the School at football
And we all wear white trousers to show em we dont care for hacks
Youre in luck to come today You just will see a match and Brookes
going to let me play in quarters Thats more than hell do for any
other lowerschool boy except James and hes fourteen

Whos Brooke

Why that big fellow who called over at dinner to be sure Hes cock
of the school and head of the Schoolhouse side and the best kick and
charger in Rugby

Oh but do show me where they play And tell me about it I love
football so and have played all my life Wont Brooke let me play

Not he said East with some indignation Why you dont know the
rules youll be a month learning them And then its no joke playingup
in a match I can tell youquite another thing from your private school
games Why theres been two collarbones broken this half and a dozen
fellows lamed And last year a fellow had his leg broken

Tom listened with the profoundest respect to this chapter of accidents
and followed East across the level ground till they came to a sort of
gigantic gallows of two poles eighteen feet high fixed upright in the
ground some fourteen feet apart with a crossbar running from one to
the other at the height of ten feet or thereabouts

This is one of the goals said East and you see the other across
there right opposite under the Doctors wall Well the match is for
the best of three goals whichever side kicks two goals wins and it
wont do you see just to kick the ball through these postsit must go
over the crossbar any heightll do so long as its between the posts
Youll have to stay in goal to touch the ball when it rolls behind the
posts because if the other side touch it they have a try at goal Then
we fellows in quarters we play just about in front of goal here and
have to turn the ball and kick it back before the big fellows on the
other side can follow it up And in front of us all the big fellows
play and thats where the scrummages are mostly

Toms respect increased as he struggled to make out his friends
technicalities and the other set to work to explain the mysteries
of off your side dropkicks punts places and the other
intricacies of the great science of football

But how do you keep the ball between the goals said he I cant see
why it mightnt go right down to the chapel

Why thats out of play answered East You see this gravelwalk
running down all along this side of the playingground and the line
of elms opposite on the other Well theyre the bounds As soon as the
ball gets past them its in touch and out of play And then whoever
first touches it has to knock it straight out amongst the playersup
who make two lines with a space between them every fellow going on his
own side Aint there just fine scrummages then And the three trees you
see there which come out into the play thats a tremendous place when
the ball hangs there for you get thrown against the trees and thats
worse than any hack

Tom wondered within himself as they strolled back again towards the
fives court whether the matches were really such breakneck affairs as
East represented and whether if they were he should ever get to like
them and play up well

He hadnt long to wonder however for next minute East cried out
Hurrah heres the puntabout come along and try your hand at a kick
The puntabout is the practiceball which is just brought out and
kicked about anyhow from one boy to another before callingsover and
dinner and at other odd times They joined the boys who had brought it
out all small Schoolhouse fellows friends of East and Tom had the
pleasure of trying his skill and performed very creditably after first
driving his foot three inches into the ground and then nearly kicking
his leg into the air in vigorous efforts to accomplish a dropkick
after the manner of East

Presently more boys and bigger came out and boys from other houses
on their way to callingover and more balls were sent for The crowd
thickened as three oclock approached and when the hour struck one
hundred and fifty boys were hard at work Then the balls were held the
master of the week came down in cap and gown to callingover and the
whole school of three hundred boys swept into the big school to answer
to their names

I may come in maynt I said Tom catching East by the arm and
longing to feel one of them

Yes come along nobodyll say anything You wont be so eager to get
into callingover after a month replied his friend and they marched
into the big school together and up to the farther end where that
illustrious form the lower fourth which had the honour of Easts
patronage for the time being stood

The master mounted into the high desk by the door and one of the
praepostors of the week stood by him on the steps the other three
marching up and down the middle of the school with their canes calling
out Silence silence The sixth form stood close by the door on the
left some thirty in number mostly great big grown men as Tom thought
surveying them from a distance with awe the fifth form behind them
twice their number and not quite so big These on the left and on the
right the lower fifth shell and all the junior forms in order while
up the middle marched the three praepostors

Then the praepostor who stands by the master calls out the names
beginning with the sixth form and as he calls each boy answers here
to his name and walks out Some of the sixth stop at the door to turn
the whole string of boys into the close It is a great matchday and
every boy in the school will he nill he must be there The rest of
the sixth go forwards into the close to see that no one escapes by any
of the side gates

Today however being the Schoolhouse match none of the Schoolhouse
praepostors stay by the door to watch for truants of their side there
is carte blanche to the Schoolhouse fags to go where they like They
trust to our honour as East proudly informs Tom they know very well
that no Schoolhouse boy would cut the match If he did wed very soon
cut him I can tell you

The master of the week being shortsighted and the praepostors of the
week small and not well up to their work the lowerschool boys employ
the ten minutes which elapse before their names are called in pelting
one another vigorously with acorns which fly about in all directions
The small praepostors dash in every now and then and generally chastise
some quiet timid boy who is equally afraid of acorns and canes
while the principal performers get dexterously out of the way And so
callingover rolls on somehow much like the big world punishments
lighting on wrong shoulders and matters going generally in a queer
crossgrained way but the end coming somehow which is after all the
great point And now the master of the week has finished and locked up
the big school and the praepostors of the week come out sweeping the
last remnant of the school fags who had been loafing about the corners
by the fives court in hopes of a chance of bolting before them into
the close

Hold the puntabout To the goals are the cries and all stray
balls are impounded by the authorities and the whole mass of boys moves
up towards the two goals dividing as they go into three bodies That
little band on the left consisting of from fifteen to twenty boys Tom
amongst them who are making for the goal under the Schoolhouse wall
are the Schoolhouse boys who are not to play up and have to stay in
goal The larger body moving to the island goal are the School boys in a
like predicament The great mass in the middle are the playersup both
sides mingled together they are hanging their jackets and all who mean
real work their hats waistcoats neckhandkerchiefs and braces on
the railings round the small trees and there they go by twos and
threes up to their respective grounds There is none of the colour and
tastiness of getup you will perceive which lends such a life to
the present game at Rugby making the dullest and worstfought match a
pretty sight Now each house has its own uniform of cap and jersey of
some lively colour but at the time we are speaking of plush caps have
not yet come in or uniforms of any sort except the Schoolhouse
white trousers which are abominably cold today Let us get to work
bareheaded and girded with our plain leather straps But we mean
business gentlemen

And now that the two sides have fairly sundered and each occupies its
own ground and we get a good look at them what absurdity is this You
dont mean to say that those fifty or sixty boys in white trousers many
of them quite small are going to play that huge mass opposite Indeed I
do gentlemen Theyre going to try at any rate and wont make such
a bad fight of it either mark my word for hasnt old Brooke won the
toss with his lucky halfpenny and got choice of goals and kickoff
The new ball you may see lie there quite by itself in the middle
pointing towards the School or island goal in another minute it will be
well on its way there Use that minute in remarking how the Schoolhouse
side is drilled You will see in the first place that the sixthform
boy who has the charge of goal has spread his force the goalkeepers
so as to occupy the whole space behind the goalposts at distances of
about five yards apart A safe and wellkept goal is the foundation of
all good play Old Brooke is talking to the captain of quarters and
now he moves away See how that youngster spreads his men the light
brigade carefully over the ground halfway between their own goal and
the body of their own playersup the heavy brigade These again play
in several bodies There is young Brooke and the bulldogs Mark them
well They are the fighting brigade the diehards larking about
at leapfrog to keep themselves warm and playing tricks on one another
And on each side of old Brooke who is now standing in the middle of
the ground and just going to kick off you see a separate wing of
playersup each with a boy of acknowledged prowess to look tohere
Warner and there Hedge but over all is old Brooke absolute as he
of Russia but wisely and bravely ruling over willing and worshipping
subjects a true football king His face is earnest and careful as he
glances a last time over his array but full of pluck and hopethe sort
of look I hope to see in my general when I go out to fight

The School side is not organized in the same way The goalkeepers
are all in lumps anyhow and nohow you cant distinguish between the
playersup and the boys in quarters and there is divided leadership
But with such odds in strength and weight it must take more than that to
hinder them from winning and so their leaders seem to think for they
let the playersup manage themselves

But now look there is a slight move forward of the Schoolhouse wings
a shout of Are you ready and loud affirmative reply Old Brooke takes
half a dozen quick steps and away goes the ball spinning towards the
School goal seventy yards before it touches ground and at no
point above twelve or fifteen feet high a model kickoff and the
Schoolhouse cheer and rush on The ball is returned and they meet it
and drive it back amongst the masses of the School already in motion
Then the two sides close and you can see nothing for minutes but a
swaying crowd of boys at one point violently agitated That is where
the ball is and there are the keen players to be met and the glory and
the hard knocks to be got You hear the dull thud thud of the ball and
the shouts of Off your side Down with him Put him over Bravo
This is what we call a scrummage gentlemen and the first scrummage
in a Schoolhouse match was no joke in the consulship of Plancus

But see it has broken the ball is driven out on the Schoolhouse side
and a rush of the School carries it past the Schoolhouse playersup
Look out in quarters Brookes and twenty other voices ring out No
need to call though the Schoolhouse captain of quarters has caught it
on the bound dodges the foremost School boys who are heading the rush
and sends it back with a good dropkick well into the enemys country
And then follows rush upon rush and scrummage upon scrummage the ball
now driven through into the Schoolhouse quarters and now into the
School goal for the Schoolhouse have not lost the advantage which the
kickoff and a slight wind gave them at the outset and are slightly
penning their adversaries You say you dont see much in it
allnothing but a struggling mass of boys and a leather ball which
seems to excite them all to great fury as a red rag does a bull My
dear sir a battle would look much the same to you except that the
boys would be men and the balls iron but a battle would be worth
your looking at for all that and so is a football match You cant be
expected to appreciate the delicate strokes of play the turns by which
a game is lost and wonit takes an old player to do that but the broad
philosophy of football you can understand if you will Come along with
me a little nearer and let us consider it together

The ball has just fallen again where the two sides are thickest and
they close rapidly around it in a scrummage It must be driven through
now by force or skill till it flies out on one side or the other
Look how differently the boys face it Here come two of the bulldogs
bursting through the outsiders in they go straight to the heart of the
scrummage bent on driving that ball out on the opposite side That is
what they mean to do My sons my sons you are too hot you have gone
past the ball and must struggle now right through the scrummage and
get round and back again to your own side before you can be of any
further use Here comes young Brooke he goes in as straight as you but
keeps his head and backs and bends holding himself still behind the
ball and driving it furiously when he gets the chance Take a leaf out
of his book you young chargers Here comes Speedicut and Flashman the
Schoolhouse bully with shouts and great action Wont you two come up
to young Brooke after lockingup by the Schoolhouse fire with Old
fellow wasnt that just a splendid scrummage by the three trees But
he knows you and so do we You dont really want to drive that
ball through that scrummage chancing all hurt for the glory of the
Schoolhouse but to make us think thats what you wanta vastly
different thing and fellows of your kidney will never go through more
than the skirts of a scrummage where its all push and no kicking We
respect boys who keep out of it and dont sham going in but youwe
had rather not say what we think of you

Then the boys who are bending and watching on the outside mark them
they are most useful players the dodgers who seize on the ball the
moment it rolls out from amongst the chargers and away with it across
to the opposite goal They seldom go into the scrummage but must have
more coolness than the chargers As endless as are boys characters so
are their ways of facing or not facing a scrummage at football

Threequarters of an hour are gone first winds are failing and weight
and numbers beginning to tell Yard by yard the Schoolhouse have been
driven back contesting every inch of ground The bulldogs are the
colour of mother earth from shoulder to ankle except young Brooke who
has a marvellous knack of keeping his legs The Schoolhouse are being
penned in their turn and now the ball is behind their goal under the
Doctors wall The Doctor and some of his family are there looking on
and seem as anxious as any boy for the success of the Schoolhouse We
get a minutes breathingtime before old Brooke kicks out and he gives
the word to play strongly for touch by the three trees Away goes the
ball and the bulldogs after it and in another minute there is shout
of In touch Our ball Nows your time old Brooke while your men
are still fresh He stands with the ball in his hand while the two
sides form in deep lines opposite one another he must strike it
straight out between them The lines are thickest close to him but
young Brooke and two or three of his men are shifting up farther
where the opposite line is weak Old Brooke strikes it out straight and
strong and it falls opposite his brother Hurrah that rush has taken
it right through the School line and away past the three trees far
into their quarters and young Brooke and the bulldogs are close upon
it The School leaders rush back shouting Look out in goal and
strain every nerve to catch him but they are after the fleetest foot
in Rugby There they go straight for the School goalposts quarters
scattering before them One after another the bulldogs go down but
young Brooke holds on He is down No a long stagger but the danger
is past That was the shock of Crew the most dangerous of dodgers And
now he is close to the School goal the ball not three yards before
him There is a hurried rush of the School fags to the spot but no
one throws himself on the ball the only chance and young Brooke has
touched it right under the School goalposts

The School leaders come up furious and administer toco to the wretched
fags nearest at hand They may well be angry for it is all Lombard
Street to a china orange that the Schoolhouse kick a goal with the ball
touched in such a good place Old Brooke of course will kick it
out but who shall catch and place it Call Crab Jones Here he comes
sauntering along with a straw in his mouth the queerest coolest fish
in Rugby If he were tumbled into the moon this minute he would just
pick himself up without taking his hands out of his pockets or turning
a hair But it is a moment when the boldest chargers heart beats quick
Old Brooke stands with the ball under his arm motioning the School back
he will not kick out till they are all in goal behind the posts They
are all edging forwards inch by inch to get nearer for the rush at
Crab Jones who stands there in front of old Brooke to catch the ball
If they can reach and destroy him before he catches the danger is over
and with one and the same rush they will carry it right away to the
Schoolhouse goal Fond hope it is kicked out and caught beautifully
Crab strikes his heel into the ground to mark the spot where the ball
was caught beyond which the school line may not advance but there they
stand five deep ready to rush the moment the ball touches the ground
Take plenty of room Dont give the rush a chance of reaching you Place
it true and steady Trust Crab Jones He has made a small hole with his
heel for the ball to lie on by which he is resting on one knee with
his eye on old Brooke Now Crab places the ball at the word old
Brooke kicks and it rises slowly and truly as the School rush forward

Then a moments pause while both sides look up at the spinning ball
There it flies straight between the two posts some five feet above the
crossbar an unquestioned goal and a shout of real genuine joy rings
out from the Schoolhouse playersup and a faint echo of it comes over
the close from the goalkeepers under the Doctors wall A goal in the
first hoursuch a thing hasnt been done in the Schoolhouse match
these five years

Over is the cry The two sides change goals and the Schoolhouse
goalkeepers come threading their way across through the masses of
the School the most openly triumphant of themamongst whom is Tom a
Schoolhouse boy of two hours standinggetting their ears boxed in
the transit Tom indeed is excited beyond measure and it is all the
sixthform boy kindest and safest of goalkeepers has been able to do
to keep him from rushing out whenever the ball has been near their
goal So he holds him by his side and instructs him in the science of
touching

At this moment Griffith the itinerant vender of oranges from Hill
Morton enters the close with his heavy baskets There is a rush of
small boys upon the little palefaced man the two sides mingling
together subdued by the great goddess Thirst like the English and
French by the streams in the Pyrenees The leaders are past oranges and
apples but some of them visit their coats and apply innocentlooking
gingerbeer bottles to their mouths It is no gingerbeer though I
fear and will do you no good One short mad rush and then a stitch in
the side and no more honest play Thats what comes of those bottles

But now Griffiths baskets are empty the ball is placed again midway
and the School are going to kick off Their leaders have sent their
lumber into goal and rated the rest soundly and one hundred and twenty
picked playersup are there bent on retrieving the game They are to
keep the ball in front of the Schoolhouse goal and then to drive it in
by sheer strength and weight They mean heavy play and no mistake and
so old Brooke sees and places Crab Jones in quarters just before the
goal with four or five picked players who are to keep the ball away to
the sides where a try at goal if obtained will be less dangerous than
in front He himself and Warner and Hedge who have saved themselves
till now will lead the charges

Are you ready Yes And away comes the ball kicked high in the air
to give the School time to rush on and catch it as it falls And here
they are amongst us Meet them like Englishmen you Schoolhouse boys
and charge them home Now is the time to show what mettle is in you
and there shall be a warm seat by the hall fire and honour and lots of
bottled beer tonight for him who does his duty in the next halfhour
And they are well met Again and again the cloud of their playersup
gathers before our goal and comes threatening on and Warner or Hedge
with young Brooke and the relics of the bulldogs break through
and carry the ball back and old Brooke ranges the field like Jobs
warhorse The thickest scrummage parts asunder before his rush like
the waves before a clippers bows his cheery voice rings out over the
field and his eye is everywhere And if these miss the ball and it
rolls dangerously in front of our goal Crab Jones and his men
have seized it and sent it away towards the sides with the unerring
dropkick This is worth living forthe whole sum of schoolboy
existence gathered up into one straining struggling halfhour a
halfhour worth a year of common life

The quarter to five has struck and the play slackens for a minute
before goal but there is Crew the artful dodger driving the ball in
behind our goal on the island side where our quarters are weakest Is
there no one to meet him Yes look at little East The ball is just at
equal distances between the two and they rush together the young man
of seventeen and the boy of twelve and kick it at the same moment Crew
passes on without a stagger East is hurled forward by the shock and
plunges on his shoulder as if he would bury himself in the ground
but the ball rises straight into the air and falls behind Crews back
while the bravoes of the Schoolhouse attest the pluckiest charge of
all that hardfought day Warner picks East up lame and half stunned
and he hobbles back into goal conscious of having played the man

And now the last minutes are come and the School gather for their last
rush every boy of the hundred and twenty who has a run left in him
Reckless of the defence of their own goal on they come across the level
bigside ground the ball well down amongst them straight for our goal
like the column of the Old Guard up the slope at Waterloo All former
charges have been childs play to this Warner and Hedge have met them
but still on they come The bulldogs rush in for the last time they
are hurled over or carried back striving hand foot and eyelids Old
Brooke comes sweeping round the skirts of the play and turning short
round picks out the very heart of the scrummage and plunges in It
wavers for a moment he has the ball No it has passed him and his
voice rings out clear over the advancing tide Look out in goal Crab
Jones catches it for a moment but before he can kick the rush is upon
him and passes over him and he picks himself up behind them with his
straw in his mouth a little dirtier but as cool as ever

The ball rolls slowly in behind the Schoolhouse goal not three yards
in front of a dozen of the biggest School playersup

There stands the Schoolhouse praepostor safest of goalkeepers and Tom
Brown by his side who has learned his trade by this time Now is
your time Tom The blood of all the Browns is up and the two rush in
together and throw themselves on the ball under the very feet of the
advancing columnthe praepostor on his hands and knees arching his
back and Tom all along on his face Over them topple the leaders of the
rush shooting over the back of the praepostor but falling flat on Tom
and knocking all the wind out of his small carcass Our ball says the
praepostor rising with his prize but get up there theres a little
fellow under you They are hauled and roll off him and Tom is
discovered a motionless body

Old Brooke picks him up Stand back give him air he says and then
feeling his limbs adds No bones brokenHow do you feel young un

Hahhah gasps Tom as his wind comes back pretty well thank
youall right

Who is he says Brooke

Oh its Brown hes a new boy I know him says East coming up

Well he is a plucky youngster and will make a player says Brooke

And five oclock strikes No side is called and the first day of the
Schoolhouse match is over



CHAPTER VIAFTER THE MATCH

 Some food we hadShakespeare
 Greek textTheocr Id

As the boys scattered away from the ground and East leaning on Toms
arm and limping along was beginning to consider what luxury they
should go and buy for tea to celebrate that glorious victory the two
Brookes came striding by Old Brooke caught sight of East and stopped
put his hand kindly on his shoulder and said Bravo youngster you
played famously Not much the matter I hope

No nothing at all said Eastonly a little twist from that
charge

Well mind and get all right for next Saturday And the leader passed
on leaving East better for those few words than all the opodeldoc in
England would have made him and Tom ready to give one of his ears for
as much notice Ah light words of those whom we love and honour what
a power ye are and how carelessly wielded by those who can use you
Surely for these things also God will ask an account

Teas directly after lockingup you see said East hobbling along as
fast as he could so you come along down to Sally Harrowells thats
our Schoolhouse tuckshop She bakes such stunning murphies well have
a pennorth each for tea Come along or theyll all be gone

Toms new purse and money burnt in his pocket he wondered as they
toddled through the quadrangle and along the street whether East
would be insulted if he suggested further extravagance as he had not
sufficient faith in a pennyworth of potatoes At last he blurted out

I say East cant we get something else besides potatoes Ive got
lots of money you know

Bless us yes I forgot said East youve only just come You see
all my tins been gone this twelve weeksit hardly ever lasts beyond
the first fortnight and our allowances were all stopped this morning
for broken windows so I havent got a penny Ive got a tick at
Sallys of course but then I hate running it high you see towards
the end of the half cause one has to shell out for it all directly one
comes back and thats a bore

Tom didnt understand much of this talk but seized on the fact that
East had no money and was denying himself some little pet luxury in
consequence Well what shall I buy said he Im uncommon hungry

I say said East stopping to look at him and rest his leg youre a
trump Brown Ill do the same by you next half Lets have a pound of
sausages then Thats the best grub for tea I know of

Very well said Tom as pleased as possible where do they sell
them

Oh over here just opposite And they crossed the street and walked
into the cleanest little front room of a small house half parlour
half shop and bought a pound of most particular sausages East talking
pleasantly to Mrs Porter while she put them in paper and Tom doing the
paying part

From Porters they adjourned to Sally Harrowells where they found a
lot of Schoolhouse boys waiting for the roast potatoes and relating
their own exploits in the days match at the top of their voices The
street opened at once into Sallys kitchen a low brickfloored room
with large recess for fire and chimneycorner seats Poor little Sally
the most goodnatured and muchenduring of womankind was bustling
about with a napkin in her hand from her own oven to those of the
neighbours cottages up the yard at the back of the house Stumps her
husband a short easygoing shoemaker with a beery humorous eye and
ponderous calves who lived mostly on his wifes earnings stood in
a corner of the room exchanging shots of the roughest description of
repartee with every boy in turn Stumps you lout youve had too
much beer again today Twasnt of your paying for then Stumpss
calves are running down into his ankles they want to get to grass
Better be doing that than gone altogether like yours etc Very poor
stuff it was but it served to make time pass and every now and then
Sally arrived in the middle with a smoking tin of potatoes which was
cleared off in a few seconds each boy as he seized his lot running
off to the house with Put me down twopennorth Sally Put down
threepennorth between me and Davis etc How she ever kept the
accounts so straight as she did in her head and on her slate was a
perfect wonder

East and Tom got served at last and started back for the Schoolhouse
just as the lockingup bell began to ring East on the way recounting
the life and adventures of Stumps who was a character Amongst his
other small avocations he was the hind carrier of a sedanchair the
last of its race in which the Rugby ladies still went out to tea and
in which when he was fairly harnessed and carrying a load it was the
delight of small and mischievous boys to follow him and whip his calves
This was too much for the temper even of Stumps and he would pursue his
tormentors in a vindictive and apoplectic manner when released but was
easily pacified by twopence to buy beer with

The lowerschool boys of the Schoolhouse some fifteen in number had
tea in the lowerfifth school and were presided over by the old verger
or headporter Each boy had a quarter of a loaf of bread and pat of
butter and as much tea as he pleased and there was scarcely one
who didnt add to this some further luxury such as baked potatoes a
herring sprats or something of the sort But few at this period of the
halfyear could live up to a pound of Porters sausages and East was
in great magnificence upon the strength of theirs He had produced a
toastingfork from his study and set Tom to toast the sausages
while he mounted guard over their butter and potatoes Cause as he
explained youre a new boy and theyll play you some trick and get
our butter but you can toast just as well as I So Tom in the midst
of three or four more urchins similarly employed toasted his face and
the sausages at the same time before the huge fire till the latter
cracked when East from his watchtower shouted that they were done and
then the feast proceeded and the festive cups of tea were filled
and emptied and Tom imparted of the sausages in small bits to many
neighbours and thought he had never tasted such good potatoes or seen
such jolly boys They on their parts waived all ceremony and pegged
away at the sausages and potatoes and remembering Toms performance in
goal voted Easts new crony a brick After tea and while the things
were being cleared away they gathered round the fire and the talk on
the match still went on and those who had them to show pulled up their
trousers and showed the hacks they had received in the good cause

They were soon however all turned out of the school and East
conducted Tom up to his bedroom that he might get on clean things and
wash himself before singing

Whats singing said Tom taking his head out of his basin where he
had been plunging it in cold water

Well you are jolly green answered his friend from a neighbouring
basin Why the last six Saturdays of every half we sing of course and
this is the first of them No first lesson to do you know and lie in
bed tomorrow morning

But who sings

Why everybody of course youll see soon enough We begin directly
after supper and sing till bedtime It aint such good fun now
though as in the summer half cause then we sing in the little fives
court under the library you know We take out tables and the big boys
sit round and drink beerdouble allowance on Saturday nights and we
cut about the quadrangle between the songs and it looks like a lot of
robbers in a cave And the louts come and pound at the great gates and
we pound back again and shout at them But this half we only sing in
the hall Come along down to my study

Their principal employment in the study was to clear out Easts table
removing the drawers and ornaments and tablecloth for he lived in the
bottom passage and his table was in requisition for the singing

Supper came in due course at seven oclock consisting of bread and
cheese and beer which was all saved for the singing and directly
afterwards the fags went to work to prepare the hall The Schoolhouse
hall as has been said is a great long high room with two large fires
on one side and two large ironbound tables one running down the
middle and the other along the wall opposite the fireplaces Around the
upper fire the fags placed the tables in the form of a horseshoe and
upon them the jugs with the Saturday nights allowance of beer Then
the big boys used to drop in and take their seats bringing with them
bottled beer and song books for although they all knew the songs by
heart it was the thing to have an old manuscript book descended from
some departed hero in which they were all carefully written out

The sixthform boys had not yet appeared so to fill up the gap an
interesting and timehonoured ceremony was gone through Each new boy
was placed on the table in turn and made to sing a solo under the
penalty of drinking a large mug of salt and water if he resisted or
broke down However the new boys all sing like nightingales tonight
and the salt water is not in requisitionTom as his part performing
the old westcountry song of The Leather Bottel with considerable
applause And at the halfhour down come the sixth and fifth form boys
and take their places at the tables which are filled up by the next
biggest boys the rest for whom there is no room at the table standing
round outside

The glasses and mugs are filled and then the fugleman strikes up the
old seasong

 A wet sheet and a flowing sea
 And a wind that follows fast etc

which is the invariable first song in the Schoolhouse and all the
seventy voices join in not mindful of harmony but bent on noise which
they attain decidedly but the general effect isnt bad And then follow
The British Grenadiers Billy Taylor The Siege of Seringapatam
Three Jolly Postboys and other vociferous songs in rapid succession
including The Chesapeake and Shannon a song lately introduced in
honour of old Brooke and when they come to the words

 Brave Broke he waved his sword crying Now my lads aboard
 And well stop their playing Yankeedoodledandy oh

you expect the roof to come down The sixth and fifth know that brave
Broke of the Shannon was no sort of relation to our old Brooke The
fourth form are uncertain in their belief but for the most part hold
that old Brooke was a midshipman then on board his uncles ship And the
lower school never doubt for a moment that it was our old Brooke who led
the boarders in what capacity they care not a straw During the pauses
the bottledbeer corks fly rapidly and the talk is fast and merry and
the big boysat least all of them who have a fellowfeeling for dry
throatshand their mugs over their shoulders to be emptied by the small
ones who stand round behind

Then Warner the head of the house gets up and wants to speak but he
cant for every boy knows whats coming And the big boys who sit at
the tables pound them and cheer and the small boys who stand behind
pound one another and cheer and rush about the hall cheering Then
silence being made Warner reminds them of the old Schoolhouse custom
of drinking the healths on the first night of singing of those who are
going to leave at the end of the half He sees that they know what he
is going to say already loud cheers and so wont keep them but
only ask them to treat the toast as it deserves It is the head of the
eleven the head of bigside football their leader on this glorious
dayPater Brooke

And away goes the pounding and cheering again becoming deafening when
old Brooke gets on his legs till a table having broken down and a
gallon or so of beer been upset and all throats getting dry silence
ensues and the hero speaks leaning his hands on the table and bending
a little forwards No action no tricks of oratoryplain strong and
straight like his play

Gentlemen of the Schoolhouse I am very proud of the way in which
you have received my name and I wish I could say all I should like in
return But I know I shant However Ill do the best I can to say what
seems to me ought to be said by a fellow whos just going to leave
and who has spent a good slice of his life here Eight years it is and
eight such years as I can never hope to have again So now I hope youll
all listen to me loud cheers of That we will for Im going to
talk seriously Youre bound to listen to me for whats the use of
calling me pater and all that if you dont mind what I say And
Im going to talk seriously because I feel so Its a jolly time
too getting to the end of the half and a goal kicked by us first day
tremendous applause after one of the hardest and fiercest days play
I can remember in eight years Frantic shoutings The School played
splendidly too I will say and kept it up to the last That last
charge of theirs would have carried away a house I never thought to see
anything again of old Crab there except little pieces when I saw him
tumbled over by it Laughter and shouting and great slapping on
the back of Jones by the boys nearest him Well but we beat em
Cheers Ay but why did we beat em Answer me that Shouts of
Your play Nonsense Twasnt the wind and kickoff eitherthat
wouldnt do it Twasnt because weve half a dozen of the best players
in the school as we have I wouldnt change Warner and Hedge and
Crab and the young un for any six on their side Violent cheers
But half a dozen fellows cant keep it up for two hours against two
hundred Why is it then Ill tell you what I think Its because weve
more reliance on one another more of a house feeling more fellowship
than the School can have Each of us knows and can depend on his
nexthand man better Thats why we beat em today Weve union
theyve divisiontheres the secret Cheers But hows this to be
kept up Hows it to be improved Thats the question For I take it
were all in earnest about beating the School whatever else we care
about I know Id sooner win two Schoolhouse matches running than get
the Balliol scholarship any day Frantic cheers

Now Im as proud of the house as any one I believe its the best
house in the school out and out Cheers But its a long way from
what I want to see it First theres a deal of bullying going on I
know it well I dont pry about and interfere that only makes it
more underhand and encourages the small boys to come to us with their
fingers in their eyes telling tales and so we should be worse off than
ever Its very little kindness for the sixth to meddle generallyyou
youngsters mind that Youll be all the better football players for
learning to stand it and to take your own parts and fight it through
But depend on it theres nothing breaks up a house like bullying
Bullies are cowards and one coward makes many so goodbye to the
Schoolhouse match if bullying gets ahead here Loud applause from
the small boys who look meaningly at Flashman and other boys at the
tables Then theres fuddling about in the publichouse and drinking
bad spirits and punch and such rotgut stuff That wont make good
dropkicks or chargers of you take my word for it You get plenty of
good beer here and thats enough for you and drinking isnt fine or
manly whatever some of you may think of it

One other thing I must have a word about A lot of you think and say
for Ive heard you Theres this new Doctor hasnt been here so long
as some of us and hes changing all the old customs Rugby and the
Schoolhouse especially are going to the dogs Stand up for the good old
ways and down with the Doctor Now Im as fond of old Rugby customs
and ways as any of you and Ive been here longer than any of you and
Ill give you a word of advice in time for I shouldnt like to see any
of you getting sacked Down with the Doctors easier said than done
Youll find him pretty tight on his perch I take it and an awkwardish
customer to handle in that line Besides now what customs has he put
down There was the good old custom of taking the linchpins out of the
farmers and bagmens gigs at the fairs and a cowardly blackguard
custom it was We all know what came of it and no wonder the Doctor
objected to it But come now any of you name a custom that he has put
down

The hounds calls out a fifthform boy clad in a green cutaway with
brass buttons and cord trousers the leader of the sporting interest
and reputed a great rider and keen hand generally

Well we had six or seven mangy harriers and beagles belonging to the
house Ill allow and had had them for years and that the Doctor
put them down But what good ever came of them Only rows with all the
keepers for ten miles round and bigside hareandhounds is better fun
ten times over What else

No answer

Well I wont go on Think it over for yourselves Youll find I
believe that he dont meddle with any one thats worth keeping And
mind now I say again look out for squalls if you will go your own way
and that way aint the Doctors for itll lead to grief You all know
that Im not the fellow to back a master through thick and thin If I
saw him stopping football or cricket or bathing or sparring Id be
as ready as any fellow to stand up about it But he dont he encourages
them Didnt you see him out today for half an hour watching us loud
cheers for the Doctor and hes a strong true man and a wise one
too and a publicschool man too cheers and so lets stick to him
and talk no more rot and drink his health as the head of the house
Loud cheers And now Ive done blowing up and very glad I am to have
done But its a solemn thing to be thinking of leaving a place which
one has lived in and loved for eight years and if one can say a word
for the good of the old house at such a time why it should be said
whether bitter or sweet If I hadnt been proud of the house and
youay no one knows how proudI shouldnt be blowing you up And now
lets get to singing But before I sit down I must give you a toast to
be drunk with threetimesthree and all the honours Its a toast which
I hope every one of us wherever he may go hereafter will never fail
to drink when he thinks of the brave bright days of his boyhood Its a
toast which should bind us all together and to those whove gone before
and wholl come after us here It is the dear old Schoolhousethe best
house of the best school in England

My dear boys old and young you who have belonged or do belong to
other schools and other houses dont begin throwing my poor little book
about the room and abusing me and it and vowing youll read no more
when you get to this point I allow youve provocation for it But come
nowwould you any of you give a fig for a fellow who didnt believe
in and stand up for his own house and his own school You know you
wouldnt Then dont object to me cracking up the old School house
Rugby Havent I a right to do it when Im taking all the trouble
of writing this true history for all of your benefits If you aint
satisfied go and write the history of your own houses in your own
times and say all you know for your own schools and houses provided
its true and Ill read it without abusing you

The last few words hit the audience in their weakest place They had
been not altogether enthusiastic at several parts of old Brookes
speech but the best house of the best school in England was too much
for them all and carried even the sporting and drinking interests off
their legs into rapturous applause and it is to be hoped resolutions
to lead a new life and remember old Brookes wordswhich however they
didnt altogether do as will appear hereafter

But it required all old Brookes popularity to carry down parts of his
speechespecially that relating to the Doctor For there are no such
bigoted holders by established forms and customs be they never so
foolish or meaningless as English schoolboysat least as the
schoolboys of our generation We magnified into heroes every boy who
had left and looked upon him with awe and reverence when he revisited
the place a year or so afterwards on his way to or from Oxford or
Cambridge and happy was the boy who remembered him and sure of an
audience as he expounded what he used to do and say though it were sad
enough stuff to make angels not to say headmasters weep

We looked upon every trumpery little custom and habit which had obtained
in the School as though it had been a law of the Medes and Persians and
regarded the infringement or variation of it as a sort of sacrilege And
the Doctor than whom no man or boy had a stronger liking for old school
customs which were good and sensible had as has already been hinted
come into most decided collision with several which were neither the one
nor the other And as old Brooke had said when he came into collision
with boys or customs there was nothing for them but to give in or take
themselves off because what he said had to be done and no mistake
about it And this was beginning to be pretty clearly understood The
boys felt that there was a strong man over them who would have things
his own way and hadnt yet learnt that he was a wise and loving man
also His personal character and influence had not had time to make
itself felt except by a very few of the bigger boys with whom he came
more directly into contact and he was looked upon with great fear and
dislike by the great majority even of his own house For he had found
School and Schoolhouse in a state of monstrous license and misrule
and was still employed in the necessary but unpopular work of setting up
order with a strong hand

However as has been said old Brooke triumphed and the boys cheered
him and then the Doctor And then more songs came and the healths of
the other boys about to leave who each made a speech one flowery
another maudlin a third prosy and so on which are not necessary to be
here recorded

Halfpast nine struck in the middle of the performance of Auld Lang
Syne a most obstreperous proceeding during which there was an immense
amount of standing with one foot on the table knocking mugs together
and shaking hands without which accompaniments it seems impossible
for the youths of Britain to take part in that famous old song The
underporter of the Schoolhouse entered during the performance bearing
five or six long wooden candlesticks with lighted dips in them which he
proceeded to stick into their holes in such part of the great tables
as he could get at and then stood outside the ring till the end of the
song when he was hailed with shouts

Bill you old muff the halfhour hasnt struck Here Bill drink
some cocktail Sing us a song old boy Dont you wish you may
get the table Bill drank the proffered cocktail not unwillingly and
putting down the empty glass remonstrated Now gentlemen theres only
ten minutes to prayers and we must get the hall straight

Shouts of No no and a violent effort to strike up Billy Taylor for
the third time Bill looked appealingly to old Brooke who got up and
stopped the noise Now then lend a hand you youngsters and get the
tables back clear away the jugs and glasses Bills right Open
the windows Warner The boy addressed who sat by the long ropes
proceeded to pull up the great windows and let in a clear fresh rush
of night air which made the candles flicker and gutter and the fires
roar The circle broke up each collaring his own jug glass and
songbook Bill pounced on the big table and began to rattle it away to
its place outside the buttery door The lowerpassage boys carried off
their small tables aided by their friends while above all standing
on the great halltable a knot of untiring sons of harmony made night
doleful by a prolonged performance of God Save the King His Majesty
King William the Fourth then reigned over us a monarch deservedly
popular amongst the boys addicted to melody to whom he was chiefly
known from the beginning of that excellent if slightly vulgar song in
which they much delighted

 Come neighbours all both great and small
 Perform your duties here
 And loudly sing Live Billy our king
 For bating the tax upon beer

Others of the more learned in songs also celebrated his praises in
a sort of ballad which I take to have been written by some Irish
loyalist I have forgotten all but the chorus which ran

 God save our good King William
 Be his name for ever blest
 Hes the father of all his people
 And the guardian of all the rest

In troth we were loyal subjects in those days in a rough way I trust
that our successors make as much of her present Majesty and having
regard to the greater refinement of the times have adopted or written
other songs equally hearty but more civilized in her honour

Then the quarter to ten struck and the prayerbell rang The sixth and
fifth form boys ranged themselves in their school order along the wall
on either side of the great fires the middlefifth and upperschool
boys round the long table in the middle of the hall and the
lowerschool boys round the upper part of the second long table which
ran down the side of the hall farthest from the fires Here Tom found
himself at the bottom of all in a state of mind and body not at all fit
for prayers as he thought and so tried hard to make himself serious
but couldnt for the life of him do anything but repeat in his head
the choruses of some of the songs and stare at all the boys opposite
wondering at the brilliancy of their waistcoats and speculating what
sort of fellows they were The steps of the headporter are heard on the
stairs and a light gleams at the door Hush from the fifthform boys
who stand there and then in strides the Doctor cap on head book
in one hand and gathering up his gown in the other He walks up the
middle and takes his post by Warner who begins calling over the names
The Doctor takes no notice of anything but quietly turns over his book
and finds the place and then stands cap in hand and finger in book
looking straight before his nose He knows better than any one when to
look and when to see nothing Tonight is singing night and theres
been lots of noise and no harm donenothing but beer drunk and nobody
the worse for it though some of them do look hot and excited So the
Doctor sees nothing but fascinates Tom in a horrible manner as he
stands there and reads out the psalm in that deep ringing searching
voice of his Prayers are over and Tom still stares openmouthed after
the Doctors retiring figure when he feels a pull at his sleeve and
turning round sees East

I say were you ever tossed in a blanket

No said Tom why

Cause therell be tossing tonight most likely before the sixth come
up to bed So if you funk you just come along and hide or else theyll
catch you and toss you

Were you ever tossed Does it hurt inquired Tom

Oh yes bless you a dozen times said East as he hobbled along by
Toms side upstairs It dont hurt unless you fall on the floor But
most fellows dont like it

They stopped at the fireplace in the top passage where were a crowd of
small boys whispering together and evidently unwilling to go up
into the bedrooms In a minute however a study door opened and a
sixthform boy came out and off they all scuttled up the stairs and
then noiselessly dispersed to their different rooms Toms heart beat
rather quick as he and East reached their room but he had made up his
mind I shant hide East said he

Very well old fellow replied East evidently pleased no more shall
I Theyll be here for us directly

The room was a great big one with a dozen beds in it but not a boy
that Tom could see except East and himself East pulled off his coat and
waistcoat and then sat on the bottom of his bed whistling and pulling
off his boots Tom followed his example

A noise and steps are heard in the passage the door opens and in rush
four or five great fifthform boys headed by Flashman in his glory

Tom and East slept in the farther corner of the room and were not seen
at first

Gone to ground eh roared Flashman Push em out then boys look
under the beds And he pulled up the little white curtain of the one
nearest him Whooop he roared pulling away at the leg of a small
boy who held on tight to the leg of the bed and sang out lustily for
mercy

Here lend a hand one of you and help me pull out this young howling
bruteHold your tongue sir or Ill kill you

Oh please Flashman please Walker dont toss me Ill fag for
youIll do anythingonly dont toss me

You be hanged said Flashman lugging the wretched boy along twont
hurt youyouCome along boys here he is

I say Flashey sang out another of the big boys drop that you
heard what old Pater Brooke said tonight Ill be hanged if well toss
any one against their will No more bullying Let him go I say

Flashman with an oath and a kick released his prey who rushed
headlong under his bed again for fear they should change their minds
and crept along underneath the other beds till he got under that of the
sixthform boy which he knew they darent disturb

Theres plenty of youngsters dont care about it said Walker Here
heres Scud Eastyoull be tossed wont you young un Scud was
Easts nickname or Black as we called it gained by his fleetness of
foot

Yes said East if you like only mind my foot

And heres another who didnt hideHullo new boy whats your name
sir

Brown

Well Whitey Brown you dont mind being tossed

No said Tom setting his teeth

Come along then boys sang out Walker and away they all went
carrying along Tom and East to the intense relief of four or five other
small boys who crept out from under the beds and behind them

What a trump Scud is said one They wont come back here now

And that new boy too he must be a goodplucked one

Ah wait till he has been tossed on to the floor see how hell like it
then

Meantime the procession went down the passage to Number 7 the largest
room and the scene of the tossing in the middle of which was a great
open space Here they joined other parties of the bigger boys each
with a captive or two some willing to be tossed some sullen and some
frightened to death At Walkers suggestion all who were afraid were let
off in honour of Pater Brookes speech

Then a dozen big boys seized hold of a blanket dragged from one of the
beds In with Scud quick theres no time to lose East was chucked
into the blanket Once twice thrice and away Up he went like a
shuttlecock but not quite up to the ceiling

Now boys with a will cried Walker once twice thrice and away
This time he went clean up and kept himself from touching the ceiling
with his hand and so again a third time when he was turned out and
up went another boy And then came Toms turn He lay quite still by
Easts advice and didnt dislike the once twice thrice but the
away wasnt so pleasant They were in good wind now and sent him
slap up to the ceiling first time against which his knees came rather
sharply But the moments pause before descending was the rubthe
feeling of utter helplessness and of leaving his whole inside behind him
sticking to the ceiling Tom was very near shouting to be set down when
he found himself back in the blanket but thought of East and didnt
and so took his three tosses without a kick or a cry and was called a
young trump for his pains

He and East having earned it stood now looking on No catastrophe
happened as all the captives were cool hands and didnt struggle This
didnt suit Flashman What your real bully likes in tossing is when the
boys kick and struggle or hold on to one side of the blanket and so
get pitched bodily on to the floor its no fun to him when no one is
hurt or frightened

Lets toss two of them together Walker suggested he

What a cursed bully you are Flashey rejoined the other Up with
another one

And so now two boys were tossed together the peculiar hardship of which
is that its too much for human nature to lie still then and share
troubles and so the wretched pair of small boys struggle in the air
which shall fall atop in the descent to the no small risk of both
falling out of the blanket and the huge delight of brutes like
Flashman

But now theres a cry that the praepostor of the room is coming so the
tossing stops and all scatter to their different rooms and Tom is
left to turn in with the first days experience of a public school to
meditate upon



CHAPTER VIISETTLING TO THE COLLAR

 Says Giles Tis mortal hard to go
 But if so bes I must
 I means to follow arter he
 As goes hisself the fustBallad

Everybody I suppose knows the dreamy delicious state in which one
lies half asleep half awake while consciousness begins to return
after a sound nights rest in a new place which we are glad to be in
following upon a day of unwonted excitement and exertion There are
few pleasanter pieces of life The worst of it is that they last such
a short time for nurse them as you will by lying perfectly passive
in mind and body you cant make more than five minutes or so of them
After which time the stupid obtrusive wakeful entity which we call
I as impatient as he is stiffnecked spite of our teeth will force
himself back again and take possession of us down to our very toes

It was in this state that Master Tom lay at halfpast seven on the
morning following the day of his arrival and from his clean little
white bed watched the movements of Bogle the generic name by which the
successive shoeblacks of the Schoolhouse were known as he marched
round from bed to bed collecting the dirty shoes and boots and
depositing clean ones in their places

There he lay half doubtful as to where exactly in the universe he was
but conscious that he had made a step in life which he had been anxious
to make It was only just light as he looked lazily out of the wide
windows and saw the tops of the great elms and the rooks circling
about and cawing remonstrances to the lazy ones of their commonwealth
before starting in a body for the neighbouring ploughed fields The
noise of the roomdoor closing behind Bogle as he made his exit with
the shoebasket under his arm roused him thoroughly and he sat up in
bed and looked round the room What in the world could be the matter
with his shoulders and loins He felt as if he had been severely beaten
all down his backthe natural results of his performance at his first
match He drew up his knees and rested his chin on them and went over
all the events of yesterday rejoicing in his new life what he had seen
of it and all that was to come

Presently one or two of the other boys roused themselves and began to
sit up and talk to one another in low tones Then East after a roll
or two came to an anchor also and nodding to Tom began examining his
ankle

What a pull said he that its lieinbed for I shall be as lame as
a tree I think

It was Sunday morning and Sunday lectures had not yet been established
so that nothing but breakfast intervened between bed and eleven oclock
chapela gap by no means easy to fill up in fact though received with
the correct amount of grumbling the first lecture instituted by
the Doctor shortly afterwards was a great boon to the School It was
lieinbed and no one was in a hurry to get up especially in rooms
where the sixthform boy was a goodtempered fellow as was the case in
Toms room and allowed the small boys to talk and laugh and do pretty
much what they pleased so long as they didnt disturb him His bed was
a bigger one than the rest standing in the corner by the fireplace
with a washingstand and large basin by the side where he lay in state
with his white curtains tucked in so as to form a retiring placean
awful subject of contemplation to Tom who slept nearly opposite and
watched the great man rouse himself and take a book from under his
pillow and begin reading leaning his head on his hand and turning his
back to the room Soon however a noise of striving urchins arose and
muttered encouragements from the neighbouring boys of Go it Tadpole
Now young Green Haul away his blanket Slipper him on the hands
Young Green and little Hall commonly called Tadpole from his great
black head and thin legs slept side by side far away by the door and
were for ever playing one another tricks which usually ended as on
this morning in open and violent collision and now unmindful of all
order and authority there they were each hauling away at the others
bedclothes with one hand and with the other armed with a slipper
belabouring whatever portion of the body of his adversary came within
reach

Hold that noise up in the corner called out the praepostor sitting
up and looking round his curtains and the Tadpole and young Green sank
down into their disordered beds and then looking at his watch added
Hullo past eight Whose turn for hot water

Where the praepostor was particular in his ablutions the fags in his
room had to descend in turn to the kitchen and beg or steal hot water
for him and often the custom extended farther and two boys went down
every morning to get a supply for the whole room

Easts and Tadpoles answered the senior fag who kept the rota

I cant go said East Im dead lame

Well be quick some of you thats all said the great man as he
turned out of bed and putting on his slippers went out into the great
passage which runs the whole length of the bedrooms to get his Sunday
habiliments out of his portmanteau

Let me go for you said Tom to East I should like it

Well thank ee thats a good fellow Just pull on your trousers and
take your jug and mine Tadpole will show you the way

And so Tom and the Tadpole in nightshirts and trousers started off
downstairs and through Thoss hole as the little buttery where
candles and beer and bread and cheese were served out at night was
called across the Schoolhouse court down a long passage and into the
kitchen where after some parley with the stalwart handsome cook who
declared that she had filled a dozen jugs already they got their hot
water and returned with all speed and great caution As it was they
narrowly escaped capture by some privateers from the fifthform rooms
who were on the lookout for the hotwater convoys and pursued them up
to the very door of their room making them spill half their load in the
passage

Better than going down again though as Tadpole remarked as we
should have had to do if those beggars had caught us

By the time that the callingover bell rang Tom and his new
comrades were all down dressed in their best clothes and he had the
satisfaction of answering here to his name for the first time the
praepostor of the week having put it in at the bottom of his list And
then came breakfast and a saunter about the close and town with East
whose lameness only became severe when any fagging had to be done And
so they whiled away the time until morning chapel

It was a fine November morning and the close soon became alive with
boys of all ages who sauntered about on the grass or walked round the
gravel walk in parties of two or three East still doing the cicerone
pointed out all the remarkable characters to Tom as they passed Osbert
who could throw a cricketball from the littleside ground over
the rooktrees to the Doctors wall Gray who had got the Balliol
scholarship and what East evidently thought of much more importance
a halfholiday for the School by his success Thorne who had run ten
miles in two minutes over the hour Black who had held his own against
the cock of the town in the last row with the louts and many more
heroes who then and there walked about and were worshipped all trace
of whom has long since vanished from the scene of their fame And the
fourthform boy who reads their names rudely cut on the old hall tables
or painted upon the bigside cupboard if hall tables and bigside
cupboards still exist wonders what manner of boys they were It will
be the same with you who wonder my sons whatever your prowess may be
in cricket or scholarship or football Two or three years more or
less and then the steadily advancing blessed wave will pass over your
names as it has passed over ours Nevertheless play your games and do
your work manfullysee only that that be doneand let the remembrance
of it take care of itself

The chapelbell began to ring at a quarter to eleven and Tom got in
early and took his place in the lowest row and watched all the other
boys come in and take their places filling row after row and tried
to construe the Greek text which was inscribed over the door with the
slightest possible success and wondered which of the masters who
walked down the chapel and took their seats in the exalted boxes at the
end would be his lord And then came the closing of the doors and the
Doctor in his robes and the service which however didnt impress him
much for his feeling of wonder and curiosity was too strong And the
boy on one side of him was scratching his name on the oak panelling
in front and he couldnt help watching to see what the name was and
whether it was well scratched and the boy on the other side went to
sleep and kept falling against him and on the whole though many boys
even in that part of the school were serious and attentive the general
atmosphere was by no means devotional and when he got out into the
close again he didnt feel at all comfortable or as if he had been to
church

But at afternoon chapel it was quite another thing He had spent the
time after dinner in writing home to his mother and so was in a better
frame of mind and his first curiosity was over and he could attend
more to the service As the hymn after the prayers was being sung and
the chapel was getting a little dark he was beginning to feel that he
had been really worshipping And then came that great event in his as
in every Rugby boys life of that daythe first sermon from the Doctor

More worthy pens than mine have described that scenethe oak pulpit
standing out by itself above the School seats the tall gallant form
the kindling eye the voice now soft as the low notes of a flute now
clear and stirring as the call of the lightinfantry bugle of him who
stood there Sunday after Sunday witnessing and pleading for his Lord
the King of righteousness and love and glory with whose Spirit he was
filled and in whose power he spoke the long lines of young faces
rising tier above tier down the whole length of the chapel from the
little boys who had just left his mother to the young mans who was
going out next week into the great world rejoicing in his strength
It was a great and solemn sight and never more so than at this time of
year when the only lights in the chapel were in the pulpit and at the
seats of the praepostors of the week and the soft twilight stole over
the rest of the chapel deepening into darkness in the high gallery
behind the organ

But what was it after all which seized and held these three hundred
boys dragging them out of themselves willing or unwilling for twenty
minutes on Sunday afternoons True there always were boys scattered up
and down the School who in heart and head were worthy to hear and able
to carry away the deepest and wisest words there spoken But these were
a minority always generally a very small one often so small a one as
to be countable on the fingers of your hand What was it that moved
and held us the rest of the three hundred reckless childish boys who
feared the Doctor with all our hearts and very little besides in heaven
or earth who thought more of our sets in the School than of the Church
of Christ and put the traditions of Rugby and the public opinion of
boys in our daily life above the laws of God We couldnt enter into
half that we heard we hadnt the knowledge of our own hearts or the
knowledge of one another and little enough of the faith hope and love
needed to that end But we listened as all boys in their better moods
will listen ay and men too for the matter of that to a man whom we
felt to be with all his heart and soul and strength striving against
whatever was mean and unmanly and unrighteous in our little world It
was not the cold clear voice of one giving advice and warning from
serene heights to those who were struggling and sinning below but the
warm living voice of one who was fighting for us and by our sides and
calling on us to help him and ourselves and one another And so wearily
and little by little but surely and steadily on the whole was brought
home to the young boy for the first time the meaning of his lifethat
it was no fools or sluggards paradise into which he had wandered
by chance but a battlefield ordained from of old where there are no
spectators but the youngest must take his side and the stakes are life
and death And he who roused this consciousness in them showed them at
the same time by every word he spoke in the pulpit and by his whole
daily life how that battle was to be fought and stood there before
them their fellowsoldier and the captain of their bandthe true sort
of captain too for a boys armyone who had no misgivings and gave
no uncertain word of command and let who would yield or make truce
would fight the fight out so every boy felt to the last gasp and the
last drop of blood Other sides of his character might take hold of
and influence boys here and there but it was this thoroughness and
undaunted courage which more than anything else won his way to the
hearts of the great mass of those on whom he left his mark and made
them believe first in him and then in his Master

It was this quality above all others which moved such boys as our
hero who had nothing whatever remarkable about him except excess of
boyishnessby which I mean animal life in its fullest measure good
nature and honest impulses hatred of injustice and meanness and
thoughtlessness enough to sink a threedecker And so during the next
two years in which it was more than doubtful whether he would get good
or evil from the School and before any steady purpose or principle grew
up in him whatever his weeks sins and shortcomings might have been he
hardly ever left the chapel on Sunday evenings without a serious resolve
to stand by and follow the Doctor and a feeling that it was only
cowardice the incarnation of all other sins in such a boys mind which
hindered him from doing so with all his heart

The next day Tom was duly placed in the third form and began his
lessons in a corner of the big School He found the work very easy as
he had been well grounded and knew his grammar by heart and as he had
no intimate companions to make him idle East and his other Schoolhouse
friends being in the lower fourth the form above him soon gained
golden opinions from his master who said he was placed too low and
should be put out at the end of the halfyear So all went well with him
in School and he wrote the most flourishing letters home to his mother
full of his own success and the unspeakable delights of a public school

In the house too all went well The end of the halfyear was drawing
near which kept everybody in a good humour and the house was ruled
well and strongly by Warner and Brooke True the general system was
rough and hard and there was bullying in nooks and cornersbad signs
for the future but it never got farther or dared show itself openly
stalking about the passages and hall and bedrooms and making the life
of the small boys a continual fear

Tom as a new boy was of right excused fagging for the first month but
in his enthusiasm for his new life this privilege hardly pleased him
and East and others of his young friends discovering this kindly
allowed him to indulge his fancy and take their turns at night fagging
and cleaning studies These were the principal duties of the fags in the
house From supper until nine oclock three fags taken in order stood in
the passages and answered any praepostor who called Fag racing to the
door the last comer having to do the work This consisted generally of
going to the buttery for beer and bread and cheese for the great men
did not sup with the rest but had each his own allowance in his study
or the fifthform room cleaning candlesticks and putting in new
candles toasting cheese bottling beer and carrying messages about the
house and Tom in the first blush of his heroworship felt it a high
privilege to receive orders from and be the bearer of the supper of old
Brooke And besides this nightwork each praepostor had three or four
fags specially allotted to him of whom he was supposed to be the guide
philosopher and friend and who in return for these good offices had to
clean out his study every morning by turns directly after first lesson
and before he returned from breakfast And the pleasure of seeing the
great mens studies and looking at their pictures and peeping into
their books made Tom a ready substitute for any boy who was too lazy to
do his own work And so he soon gained the character of a goodnatured
willing fellow who was ready to do a turn for any one

In all the games too he joined with all his heart and soon became
well versed in all the mysteries of football by continual practice at
the Schoolhouse littleside which played daily

The only incident worth recording here however was his first run at
hareandhounds On the last Tuesday but one of the halfyear he was
passing through the hall after dinner when he was hailed with shouts
from Tadpole and several other fags seated at one of the long tables
the chorus of which was Come and help us tear up scent

Tom approached the table in obedience to the mysterious summons always
ready to help and found the party engaged in tearing up old newspapers
copybooks and magazines into small pieces with which they were
filling four large canvas bags

Its the turn of our house to find scent for bigside hareandhounds
exclaimed Tadpole Tear away theres no time to lose before
callingover

I think its a great shame said another small boy to have such a
hard run for the last day

Which run is it said Tadpole

Oh the Barby run I hear answered the other nine miles at least
and hard ground no chance of getting in at the finish unless youre a
firstrate scud

Well Im going to have a try said Tadpole its the last run of the
half and if a fellow gets in at the end bigside stands ale and bread
and cheese and a bowl of punch and the Cocks such a famous place for
ale

I should like to try too said Tom

Well then leave your waistcoat behind and listen at the door after
callingover and youll hear where the meet is

After callingover sure enough there were two boys at the door calling
out Bigside hareandhounds meet at White Hall and Tom having
girded himself with leather strap and left all superfluous clothing
behind set off for White Hall an old gableended house some quarter
of a mile from the town with East whom he had persuaded to join
notwithstanding his prophecy that they could never get in as it was the
hardest run of the year

At the meet they found some forty or fifty boys and Tom felt sure from
having seen many of them run at football that he and East were more
likely to get in than they

After a few minutes waiting two wellknown runners chosen for the
hares buckled on the four bags filled with scent compared their
watches with those of young Brooke and Thorne and started off at a
long slinging trot across the fields in the direction of Barby

Then the hounds clustered round Thorne who explained shortly Theyre
to have six minutes law We run into the Cock and every one who comes
in within a quarter of an hour of the haresll be counted if he has
been round Barby church Then came a minutes pause or so and then the
watches are pocketed and the pack is led through the gateway into the
field which the hares had first crossed Here they break into a trot
scattering over the field to find the first traces of the scent which
the hares throw out as they go along The old hounds make straight for
the likely points and in a minute a cry of Forward comes from one
of them and the whole pack quickening their pace make for the spot
while the boy who hit the scent first and the two or three nearest to
him are over the first fence and making play along the hedgerow in the
long grassfield beyond The rest of the pack rush at the gap already
made and scramble through jostling one another Forward again
before they are half through The pace quickens into a sharp run the
tail hounds all straining to get up to the lucky leaders They are
gallant hares and the scent lies thick right across another meadow and
into a ploughed field where the pace begins to tell then over a good
wattle with a ditch on the other side and down a large pasture studded
with old thorns which slopes down to the first brook The great
Leicestershire sheep charge away across the field as the pack comes
racing down the slope The brook is a small one and the scent lies
right ahead up the opposite slope and as thick as evernot a turn or
a check to favour the tail hounds who strain on now trailing in a long
line many a youngster beginning to drag his legs heavily and feel his
heart beat like a hammer and the badplucked ones thinking that after
all it isnt worth while to keep it up

Tom East and the Tadpole had a good start and are well up for such
young hands and after rising the slope and crossing the next field
find themselves up with the leading hounds who have overrun the scent
and are trying back They have come a mile and a half in about eleven
minutes a pace which shows that it is the last day About twentyfive
of the original starters only show here the rest having already given
in the leaders are busy making casts into the fields on the left and
right and the others get their second winds

Then comes the cry of Forward again from young Brooke from the
extreme left and the pack settles down to work again steadily and
doggedly the whole keeping pretty well together The scent though
still good is not so thick there is no need of that for in this part
of the run every one knows the line which must be taken and so there
are no casts to be made but good downright running and fencing to be
done All who are now up mean coming in and they come to the foot of
Barby Hill without losing more than two or three more of the pack This
last straight two miles and a half is always a vantage ground for the
hounds and the hares know it well they are generally viewed on the
side of Barby Hill and all eyes are on the lookout for them today But
not a sign of them appears so now will be the hard work for the hounds
and there is nothing for it but to cast about for the scent for it is
now the hares turn and they may baffle the pack dreadfully in the next
two miles

Ill fares it now with our youngsters that they are Schoolhouse boys
and so follow young Brooke for he takes the wide casts round to the
left conscious of his own powers and loving the hard work For if you
would consider for a moment you small boys you would remember that the
Cock where the run ends and the good ale will be going lies far out to
the right on the Dunchurch road so that every cast you take to the left
is so much extra work And at this stage of the run when the evening is
closing in already no one remarks whether you run a little cunning or
not so you should stick to those crafty hounds who keep edging away to
the right and not follow a prodigal like young Brooke whose legs are
twice as long as yours and of castiron wholly indifferent to one or
two miles more or less However they struggle after him sobbing and
plunging along Tom and East pretty close and Tadpole whose big head
begins to pull him down some thirty yards behind

Now comes a brook with stiff clay banks from which they can hardly
drag their legs and they hear faint cries for help from the wretched
Tadpole who has fairly stuck fast But they have too little run left
in themselves to pull up for their own brothers Three fields more and
another check and then Forward called away to the extreme right

The two boys souls die within them they can never do it Young Brooke
thinks so too and says kindly Youll cross a lane after next field
keep down it and youll hit the Dunchurch road below the Cock and
then steams away for the run in in which hes sure to be first as
if he were just starting They struggle on across the next field the
forwards getting fainter and fainter and then ceasing The whole hunt
is out of earshot and all hope of coming in is over

Hang it all broke out East as soon as he had got wind enough
pulling off his hat and mopping at his face all spattered with dirt and
lined with sweat from which went up a thick steam into the still cold
air I told you how it would be What a thick I was to come Here we
are dead beat and yet I know were close to the run in if we knew the
country

Well said Tom mopping away and gulping down his disappointment
it cant be helped We did our best anyhow Hadnt we better find this
lane and go down it as young Brooke told us

I suppose sonothing else for it grunted East If ever I go out
last day again Growl growl growl

So they tried back slowly and sorrowfully and found the lane and went
limping down it plashing in the cold puddly ruts and beginning to feel
how the run had taken it out of them The evening closed in fast and
clouded over dark cold and dreary

I say it must be lockingup I should think remarked East breaking
the silenceits so dark

What if were late said Tom

No tea and sent up to the Doctor answered East

The thought didnt add to their cheerfulness Presently a faint halloo
was heard from an adjoining field They answered it and stopped hoping
for some competent rustic to guide them when over a gate some twenty
yards ahead crawled the wretched Tadpole in a state of collapse He had
lost a shoe in the brook and had been groping after it up to his elbows
in the stiff wet clay and a more miserable creature in the shape of
boy seldom has been seen

The sight of him notwithstanding cheered them for he was some degrees
more wretched than they They also cheered him as he was no longer
under the dread of passing his night alone in the fields And so in
better heart the three plashed painfully down the neverending lane At
last it widened just as utter darkness set in and they came out on
a turnpike road and there paused bewildered for they had lost all
bearings and knew not whether to turn to the right or left

Luckily for them they had not to decide for lumbering along the road
with one lamp lighted and two spavined horses in the shafts came a
heavy coach which after a moments suspense they recognized as the
Oxford coach the redoubtable Pig and Whistle

It lumbered slowly up and the boys mustering their last run caught
it as it passed and began clambering up behind in which exploit East
missed his footing and fell flat on his nose along the road Then the
others hailed the old scarecrow of a coachman who pulled up and agreed
to take them in for a shilling so there they sat on the back seat
drubbing with their heels and their teeth chattering with cold and
jogged into Rugby some forty minutes after lockingup

Five minutes afterwards three small limping shivering figures steal
along through the Doctors garden and into the house by the servants
entrance all the other gates have been closed long since where the
first thing they light upon in the passage is old Thomas ambling along
candle in one hand and keys in the other

He stops and examines their condition with a grim smile Ah East
Hall and Brown late for lockingup Must go up to the Doctors study
at once

Well but Thomas maynt we go and wash first You can put down the
time you know

Doctors study drectly you come inthats the orders replied old
Thomas motioning towards the stairs at the end of the passage which led
up into the Doctors house and the boys turned ruefully down it not
cheered by the old vergers muttered remark What a pickle they boys be
in Thomas referred to their faces and habiliments but they construed
it as indicating the Doctors state of mind Upon the short flight of
stairs they paused to hold counsel

Wholl go in first inquires Tadpole

Youyoure the senior answered East

Catch me Look at the state Im in rejoined Hall showing the arms of
his jacket I must get behind you two

Well but look at me said East indicating the mass of clay behind
which he was standing Im worse than you two to one You might grow
cabbages on my trousers

Thats all down below and you can keep your legs behind the sofa
said Hall

Here Brown youre the showfigure You must lead

But my face is all muddy argued Tom

Oh were all in one boat for that matter but come on were only
making it worse dawdling here

Well just give us a brush then said Tom And they began trying to
rub off the superfluous dirt from each others jackets but it was not
dry enough and the rubbing made them worse so in despair they pushed
through the swingdoor at the head of the stairs and found themselves
in the Doctors hall

Thats the library door said East in a whisper pushing Tom forwards
The sound of merry voices and laughter came from within and his first
hesitating knock was unanswered But at the second the Doctors voice
said Come in and Tom turned the handle and he with the others
behind him sidled into the room

The Doctor looked up from his task he was working away with a great
chisel at the bottom of a boys sailing boat the lines of which he was
no doubt fashioning on the model of one of Niciass galleys Round him
stood three or four children the candles burnt brightly on a large
table at the farther end covered with books and papers and a great
fire threw a ruddy glow over the rest of the room All looked so kindly
and homely and comfortable that the boys took heart in a moment and
Tom advanced from behind the shelter of the great sofa The Doctor
nodded to the children who went out casting curious and amused glances
at the three young scarecrows

Well my little fellows began the Doctor drawing himself up with
his back to the fire the chisel in one hand and his coattails in the
other and his eyes twinkling as he looked them over what makes you so
late

Please sir weve been out bigside hareandhounds and lost our
way

Hah you couldnt keep up I suppose

Well sir said East stepping out and not liking that the Doctor
should think lightly of his running powers we got round Barby all
right but then

Why what a state youre in my boy interrupted the Doctor as the
pitiful condition of Easts garments was fully revealed to him

Thats the fall I got sir in the road said East looking down at
himself the Old Pig came by

The what said the Doctor

The Oxford coach sir explained Hall

Hah yes the Regulator said the Doctor

And I tumbled on my face trying to get up behind went on East

Youre not hurt I hope said the Doctor

Oh no sir

Well now run upstairs all three of you and get clean things on and
then tell the housekeeper to give you some tea Youre too young to try
such long runs Let Warner know Ive seen you Goodnight

Goodnight sir And away scuttled the three boys in high glee

What a brick not to give us even twenty lines to learn said the
Tadpole as they reached their bedroom and in half an hour afterwards
they were sitting by the fire in the housekeepers room at a sumptuous
tea with cold meatTwice as good a grub as we should have got in the
hall as the Tadpole remarked with a grin his mouth full of buttered
toast All their grievances were forgotten and they were resolving to
go out the first bigside next half and thinking hareandhounds the
most delightful of games

A day or two afterwards the great passage outside the bedrooms was
cleared of the boxes and portmanteaus which went down to be packed by
the matron and great games of chariotracing and cockfighting and
bolstering went on in the vacant space the sure sign of a closing
halfyear

Then came the making up of parties for the journey home and Tom joined
a party who were to hire a coach and post with four horses to Oxford

Then the last Saturday on which the Doctor came round to each form to
give out the prizes and hear the masters last reports of how they
and their charges had been conducting themselves and Tom to his huge
delight was praised and got his remove into the lower fourth in which
all his Schoolhouse friends were

On the next Tuesday morning at four oclock hot coffee was going on in
the housekeepers and matrons rooms boys wrapped in greatcoats and
mufflers were swallowing hasty mouthfuls rushing about tumbling over
luggage and asking questions all at once of the matron outside the
Schoolgates were drawn up several chaises and the fourhorse coach
which Toms party had chartered the postboys in their best jackets and
breeches and a cornopean player hired for the occasion blowing away
A southerly wind and a cloudy sky waking all peaceful inhabitants
halfway down the High Street

Every minute the bustle and hubbub increased porters staggered about
with boxes and bags the cornopean played louder Old Thomas sat in
his den with a great yellow bag by his side out of which he was paying
journeymoney to each boy comparing by the light of a solitary dip the
dirty crabbed little list in his own handwriting with the Doctors list
and the amount of his cash his head was on one side his mouth screwed
up and his spectacles dim from early toil He had prudently locked the
door and carried on his operations solely through the window or he
would have been driven wild and lost all his money

Thomas do be quick we shall never catch the Highflyer at Dunchurch

Thats your money all right Green

Hullo Thomas the Doctor said I was to have two pound ten youve only
given me two pound I fear that Master Green is not confining himself
strictly to truth Thomas turns his head more on one side than ever
and spells away at the dirty list Green is forced away from the window

Here Thomasnever mind him mines thirty shillings And mine too
And mine shouted others

One way or another the party to which Tom belonged all got packed and
paid and sallied out to the gates the cornopean playing frantically
Drops of Brandy in allusion probably to the slight potations in
which the musician and postboys had been already indulging All luggage
was carefully stowed away inside the coach and in the front and hind
boots so that not a hatbox was visible outside Five or six small
boys with peashooters and the cornopean player got up behind in
front the big boys mostly smoking not for pleasure but because they
are now gentlemen at large and this is the most correct public method
of notifying the fact

Robinsons coach will be down the road in a minute it has gone up to
Birds to pick up Well wait till theyre close and make a race of
it says the leader Now boys half a sovereign apiece if you beat
em into Dunchurch by one hundred yards

All right sir shouted the grinning postboys

Down comes Robinsons coach in a minute or two with a rival cornopean
and away go the two vehicles horses galloping boys cheering horns
playing loud There is a special providence over schoolboys as well
as sailors or they must have upset twenty times in the first five
milessometimes actually abreast of one another and the boys on the
roofs exchanging volleys of peas now nearly running over a postchaise
which had started before them now halfway up a bank now with a wheel
and a half over a yawning ditch and all this in a dark morning with
nothing but their own lamps to guide them However its all over at
last and they have run over nothing but an old pig in Southam Street
The last peas are distributed in the Corn Market at Oxford where they
arrive between eleven and twelve and sit down to a sumptuous breakfast
at the Angel which they are made to pay for accordingly Here the party
breaks up all going now different ways and Tom orders out a chaise and
pair as grand as a lord though he has scarcely five shillings left in
his pocket and more than twenty miles to get home

Where to sir

Red Lion Farringdon says Tom giving hostler a shilling

All right sirRed Lion Jem to the postboy and Tom rattles away
towards home At Farringdon being known to the innkeeper he gets that
worthy to pay for the Oxford horses and forward him in another chaise
at once and so the gorgeous young gentleman arrives at the paternal
mansion and Squire Brown looks rather blue at having to pay two pound
ten shillings for the posting expenses from Oxford But the boys
intense joy at getting home and the wonderful health he is in and the
good character he brings and the brave stories he tells of Rugby its
doings and delights soon mollify the Squire and three happier people
didnt sit down to dinner that day in England it is the boys first
dinner at six oclock at homegreat promotion already than the Squire
and his wife and Tom Brown at the end of his first halfyear at Rugby



CHAPTER VIIITHE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE

 They are slaves who will not choose
 Hatred scoffing and abuse
 Rather than in silence shrink
 From the truth they needs must think
 They are slaves who dare not be
 In the right with two or three
 LOWELL Stanzas on Freedom

The lowerfourth form in which Tom found himself at the beginning
of the next halfyear was the largest form in the lower school and
numbered upwards of forty boys Young gentlemen of all ages from nine to
fifteen were to be found there who expended such part of their energies
as was devoted to Latin and Greek upon a book of Livy the Bucolics
of Virgil and the Hecuba of Euripides which were ground out in small
daily portions The driving of this unlucky lowerfourth must have been
grievous work to the unfortunate master for it was the most unhappily
constituted of any in the school Here stuck the great stupid boys
who for the life of them could never master the accidencethe objects
alternately of mirth and terror to the youngsters who were daily taking
them up and laughing at them in lesson and getting kicked by them for
so doing in playhours There were no less than three unhappy fellows in
tail coats with incipient down on their chins whom the Doctor and
the master of the form were always endeavouring to hoist into the upper
school but whose parsing and construing resisted the most wellmeant
shoves Then came the mass of the form boys of eleven and twelve the
most mischievous and reckless age of British youth of whom East and Tom
Brown were fair specimens As full of tricks as monkeys and of excuses
as Irishwomen making fun of their master one another and their
lessons Argus himself would have been puzzled to keep an eye on them
and as for making them steady or serious for half an hour together
it was simply hopeless The remainder of the form consisted of young
prodigies of nine and ten who were going up the school at the rate of
a form a halfyear all boys hands and wits being against them in their
progress It would have been one mans work to see that the precocious
youngsters had fair play and as the master had a good deal besides
to do they hadnt and were for ever being shoved down three or four
places their verses stolen their books inked their jackets whitened
and their lives otherwise made a burden to them

The lowerfourth and all the forms below it were heard in the great
school and were not trusted to prepare their lessons before coming in
but were whipped into school threequarters of an hour before the lesson
began by their respective masters and there scattered about on the
benches with dictionary and grammar hammered out their twenty lines
of Virgil and Euripides in the midst of babel The masters of the
lower school walked up and down the great school together during this
threequarters of an hour or sat in their desks reading or looking over
copies and keeping such order as was possible But the lowerfourth
was just now an overgrown form too large for any one man to attend
to properly and consequently the elysium or ideal form of the young
scapegraces who formed the staple of it

Tom as has been said had come up from the third with a good character
but the temptations of the lowerfourth soon proved too strong for him
and he rapidly fell away and became as unmanageable as the rest
For some weeks indeed he succeeded in maintaining the appearance of
steadiness and was looked upon favourably by his new master whose eyes
were first opened by the following little incident

Besides the desk which the master himself occupied there was another
large unoccupied desk in the corner of the great school which was
untenanted To rush and seize upon this desk which was ascended by
three steps and held four boys was the great object of ambition of the
lowerfourthers and the contentions for the occupation of it bred such
disorder that at last the master forbade its use altogether This of
course was a challenge to the more adventurous spirits to occupy it
and as it was capacious enough for two boys to lie hid there completely
it was seldom that it remained empty notwithstanding the veto Small
holes were cut in the front through which the occupants watched the
masters as they walked up and down and as lesson time approached one
boy at a time stole out and down the steps as the masters backs were
turned and mingled with the general crowd on the forms below Tom and
East had successfully occupied the desk some halfdozen times and were
grown so reckless that they were in the habit of playing small games
with fives balls inside when the masters were at the other end of the
big school One day as illluck would have it the game became more
exciting than usual and the ball slipped through Easts fingers and
rolled slowly down the steps and out into the middle of the school just
as the masters turned in their walk and faced round upon the desk The
young delinquents watched their master through the lookout holes march
slowly down the school straight upon their retreat while all the boys
in the neighbourhood of course stopped their work to look on and not
only were they ignominiously drawn out and caned over the hand then
and there but their characters for steadiness were gone from that time
However as they only shared the fate of some threefourths of the rest
of the form this did not weigh heavily upon them

In fact the only occasions on which they cared about the matter were
the monthly examinations when the Doctor came round to examine their
form for one long awful hour in the work which they had done in the
preceding month The second monthly examination came round soon after
Toms fall and it was with anything but lively anticipations that he
and the other lowerfourth boys came in to prayers on the morning of the
examination day

Prayers and callingover seemed twice as short as usual and before they
could get construes of a tithe of the hard passages marked in the margin
of their books they were all seated round and the Doctor was standing
in the middle talking in whispers to the master Tom couldnt hear a
word which passed and never lifted his eyes from his book but he knew
by a sort of magnetic instinct that the Doctors underlip was coming
out and his eye beginning to burn and his gown getting gathered up
more and more tightly in his left hand The suspense was agonizing and
Tom knew that he was sure on such occasions to make an example of the
Schoolhouse boys If he would only begin thought Tom I shouldnt
mind

At last the whispering ceased and the name which was called out was not
Brown He looked up for a moment but the Doctors face was too awful
Tom wouldnt have met his eye for all he was worth and buried himself
in his book again

The boy who was called up first was a clever merry Schoolhouse boy
one of their set he was some connection of the Doctors and a great
favourite and ran in and out of his house as he liked and so was
selected for the first victim

Triste lupus stabulis began the luckless youngster and stammered
through some eight or ten lines

There that will do said the Doctor now construe

On common occasions the boy could have construed the passage well enough
probably but now his head was gone

Triste lupus the sorrowful wolf he began

A shudder ran through the whole form and the Doctors wrath fairly
boiled over He made three steps up to the construer and gave him a
good box on the ear The blow was not a hard one but the boy was so
taken by surprise that he started back the form caught the back of his
knees and over he went on to the floor behind There was a dead silence
over the whole school Never before and never again while Tom was at
school did the Doctor strike a boy in lesson The provocation must have
been great However the victim had saved his form for that occasion
for the Doctor turned to the top bench and put on the best boys for the
rest of the hour and though at the end of the lesson he gave them all
such a rating as they did not forget this terrible fieldday passed
over without any severe visitations in the shape of punishments or
floggings Forty young scapegraces expressed their thanks to the
sorrowful wolf in their different ways before second lesson

But a character for steadiness once gone is not easily recovered as Tom
found and for years afterwards he went up the school without it
and the masters hands were against him and his against them And he
regarded them as a matter of course as his natural enemies

Matters were not so comfortable either in the house as they had
been for old Brooke left at Christmas and one or two others of the
sixthform boys at the following Easter Their rule had been rough but
strong and just in the main and a higher standard was beginning to be
set up in fact there had been a short foretaste of the good time which
followed some years later Just now however all threatened to return
into darkness and chaos again For the new praepostors were either small
young boys whose cleverness had carried them up to the top of the
school while in strength of body and character they were not yet
fit for a share in the government or else big fellows of the wrong
sortboys whose friendships and tastes had a downward tendency who had
not caught the meaning of their position and work and felt none of its
responsibilities So under this nogovernment the Schoolhouse began to
see bad times The big fifthform boys who were a sporting and drinking
set soon began to usurp power and to fag the little boys as if they
were praepostors and to bully and oppress any who showed signs of
resistance The bigger sort of sixthform boys just described soon made
common cause with the fifth while the smaller sort hampered by their
colleagues desertion to the enemy could not make head against them
So the fags were without their lawful masters and protectors and ridden
over roughshod by a set of boys whom they were not bound to obey and
whose only right over them stood in their bodily powers and as old
Brooke had prophesied the house by degrees broke up into small sets and
parties and lost the strong feeling of fellowship which he set so much
store by and with it much of the prowess in games and the lead in all
school matters which he had done so much to keep up

In no place in the world has individual character more weight than at
a public school Remember this I beseech you all you boys who are
getting into the upper forms Now is the time in all your lives
probably when you may have more wide influence for good or evil on the
society you live in than you ever can have again Quit yourselves like
men then speak up and strike out if necessary for whatsoever
is true and manly and lovely and of good report never try to be
popular but only to do your duty and help others to do theirs and you
may leave the tone of feeling in the school higher than you found it
and so be doing good which no living soul can measure to generations of
your countrymen yet unborn For boys follow one another in herds like
sheep for good or evil they hate thinking and have rarely any settled
principles Every school indeed has its own traditionary standard of
right and wrong which cannot be transgressed with impunity marking
certain things as low and blackguard and certain others as lawful and
right This standard is ever varying though it changes only slowly and
little by little and subject only to such standard it is the leading
boys for the time being who give the tone to all the rest and make
the School either a noble institution for the training of Christian
Englishmen or a place where a young boy will get more evil than he
would if he were turned out to make his way in London streets or
anything between these two extremes

The change for the worse in the Schoolhouse however didnt press very
heavily on our youngsters for some time They were in a good bedroom
where slept the only praepostor left who was able to keep thorough order
and their study was in his passage So though they were fagged more or
less and occasionally kicked or cuffed by the bullies they were on
the whole well off and the fresh brave schoollife so full of games
adventures and goodfellowship so ready at forgetting so capacious
at enjoying so bright at forecasting outweighed a thousandfold their
troubles with the master of their form and the occasional illusage
of the big boys in the house It wasnt till some year or so after the
events recorded above that the praepostor of their room and passage left
None of the other sixthform boys would move into their passage and to
the disgust and indignation of Tom and East one morning after breakfast
they were seized upon by Flashman and made to carry down his books and
furniture into the unoccupied study which he had taken From this
time they began to feel the weight of the tyranny of Flashman and his
friends and now that trouble had come home to their own doors began
to look out for sympathizers and partners amongst the rest of the fags
and meetings of the oppressed began to be held and murmurs to arise
and plots to be laid as to how they should free themselves and be
avenged on their enemies

While matters were in this state East and Tom were one evening sitting
in their study They had done their work for first lesson and Tom was
in a brown study brooding like a young William Tell upon the wrongs
of fags in general and his own in particular

I say Scud said he at last rousing himself to snuff the candle
what right have the fifthform boys to fag us as they do

No more right than you have to fag them answered East without
looking up from an early number of Pickwick which was just coming
out and which he was luxuriously devouring stretched on his back on
the sofa

Tom relapsed into his brown study and East went on reading and
chuckling The contrast of the boys faces would have given infinite
amusement to a lookeronthe one so solemn and big with mighty purpose
the other radiant and bubbling over with fun

Do you know old fellow Ive been thinking it over a good deal began
Tom again

Oh yes I knowfagging you are thinking of Hang it all But listen
here Tomheres fun Mr Winkles horse

And Ive made up my mind broke in Tom that I wont fag except for
the sixth

Quite right too my boy cried East putting his finger on the place
and looking up but a pretty peck of troubles youll get into if
youre going to play that game However Im all for a strike myself if
we can get others to join Its getting too bad

Cant we get some sixthform fellow to take it up asked Tom

Well perhaps we might Morgan would interfere I think Only added
East after a moments pause you see we should have to tell him about
it and thats against School principles Dont you remember what old
Brooke said about learning to take our own parts

Ah I wish old Brooke were back again It was all right in his time

Why yes you see then the strongest and best fellows were in the
sixth and the fifthform fellows were afraid of them and they kept
good order but now our sixthform fellows are too small and the fifth
dont care for them and do what they like in the house

And so we get a double set of masters cried Tom indignantlythe
lawful ones who are responsible to the Doctor at any rate and the
unlawful the tyrants who are responsible to nobody

Down with the tyrants cried East Im all for law and order and
hurrah for a revolution

I shouldnt mind if it were only for young Brooke now said Tom hes
such a goodhearted gentlemanly fellow and ought to be in the sixth
Id do anything for him But that blackguard Flashman who never speaks
to one without a kick or an oath

The cowardly brute broke in Easthow I hate him And he knows it
too he knows that you and I think him a coward What a bore that hes
got a study in this passage Dont you hear them now at supper in his
den Brandypunch going Ill bet I wish the Doctor would come out and
catch him We must change our study as soon as we can

Change or no change Ill never fag for him again said Tom thumping
the table

Faaaag sounded along the passage from Flashmans study The
two boys looked at one another in silence It had struck nine so the
regular nightfags had left duty and they were the nearest to the
supperparty East sat up and began to look comical as he always did
under difficulties

Faaaag again No answer

Here Brown East you cursed young skulks roared out Flashman
coming to his open door I know youre in no shirking

Tom stole to their door and drew the bolts as noiselessly as he could
East blew out the candle

Barricade the first whispered he Now Tom mind no surrender

Trust me for that said Tom between his teeth

In another minute they heard the supperparty turn out and come down the
passage to their door They held their breaths and heard whispering of
which they only made out Flashmans words I know the young brutes are
in

Then came summonses to open which being unanswered the assault
commenced Luckily the door was a good strong oak one and resisted the
united weight of Flashmans party A pause followed and they heard a
besieger remark Theyre in safe enough Dont you see how the door
holds at top and bottom So the bolts must be drawn We should have
forced the lock long ago East gave Tom a nudge to call attention to
this scientific remark

Then came attacks on particular panels one of which at last gave way
to the repeated kicks but it broke inwards and the broken pieces got
jammed across the door being lined with green baize and couldnt
easily be removed from outside and the besieged scorning further
concealment strengthened their defences by pressing the end of their
sofa against the door So after one or two more ineffectual efforts
Flashman and Company retired vowing vengeance in no mild terms

The first danger over it only remained for the besieged to effect a
safe retreat as it was now near bedtime They listened intently and
heard the supperparty resettle themselves and then gently drew back
first one bolt and then the other Presently the convivial noises began
again steadily Now then stand by for a run said East throwing the
door wide open and rushing into the passage closely followed by Tom
They were too quick to be caught but Flashman was on the lookout and
sent an empty picklejar whizzing after them which narrowly missed
Toms head and broke into twenty pieces at the end of the passage
He wouldnt mind killing one if he wasnt caught said East as they
turned the corner

There was no pursuit so the two turned into the hall where they found
a knot of small boys round the fire Their story was told The war of
independence had broken out Who would join the revolutionary forces
Several others present bound themselves not to fag for the fifth form
at once One or two only edged off and left the rebels What else could
they do Ive a good mind to go to the Doctor straight said Tom

Thatll never do Dont you remember the levy of the school last half
put in another

In fact the solemn assembly a levy of the School had been held at
which the captain of the School had got up and after premising that
several instances had occurred of matters having been reported to the
masters that this was against public morality and School tradition
that a levy of the sixth had been held on the subject and they had
resolved that the practice must be stopped at once and given out that
any boy in whatever form who should thenceforth appeal to a master
without having first gone to some praepostor and laid the case before
him should be thrashed publicly and sent to Coventry

Well then lets try the sixth Try Morgan suggested another No
useBlabbing wont do was the general feeling

Ill give you fellows a piece of advice said a voice from the end
of the hall They all turned round with a start and the speaker got up
from a bench on which he had been lying unobserved and gave himself a
shake He was a big loosemade fellow with huge limbs which had grown
too far through his jacket and trousers Dont you go to anybody at
allyou just stand out say you wont fag Theyll soon get tired of
licking you Ive tried it on years ago with their forerunners

No Did you Tell us how it was cried a chorus of voices as they
clustered round him

Well just as it is with you The fifth form would fag us and I and
some more struck and we beat em The good fellows left off directly
and the bullies who kept on soon got afraid

Was Flashman here then

Yes and a dirty little snivelling sneaking fellow he was too He
never dared join us and used to toady the bullies by offering to fag
for them and peaching against the rest of us

Why wasnt he cut then said East

Oh toadies never get cut theyre too useful Besides he has no end
of great hampers from home with wine and game in them so he toadied
and fed himself into favour

The quartertoten bell now rang and the small boys went off upstairs
still consulting together and praising their new counsellor who
stretched himself out on the bench before the hall fire again There
he lay a very queer specimen of boyhood by name Diggs and familiarly
called the Mucker He was young for his size and a very clever
fellow nearly at the top of the fifth His friends at home having
regard I suppose to his age and not to his size and place in the
school hadnt put him into tails and even his jackets were always too
small and he had a talent for destroying clothes and making himself
look shabby He wasnt on terms with Flashmans set who sneered at his
dress and ways behind his back which he knew and revenged himself
by asking Flashman the most disagreeable questions and treating him
familiarly whenever a crowd of boys were round him Neither was he
intimate with any of the other bigger boys who were warned off by
his oddnesses for he was a very queer fellow besides amongst other
failings he had that of impecuniosity in a remarkable degree He
brought as much money as other boys to school but got rid of it in no
time no one knew how and then being also reckless borrowed from any
one and when his debts accumulated and creditors pressed would have
an auction in the hall of everything he possessed in the world selling
even his schoolbooks candlestick and study table For weeks after
one of these auctions having rendered his study uninhabitable he would
live about in the fifthform room and hall doing his verses on old
letterbacks and odd scraps of paper and learning his lessons no one
knew how He never meddled with any little boy and was popular with
them though they all looked on him with a sort of compassion and
called him Poor Diggs not being able to resist appearances or to
disregard wholly even the sneers of their enemy Flashman However he
seemed equally indifferent to the sneers of big boys and the pity of
small ones and lived his own queer life with much apparent enjoyment to
himself It is necessary to introduce Diggs thus particularly as he not
only did Tom and East good service in their present warfare as is about
to be told but soon afterwards when he got into the sixth chose them
for his fags and excused them from studyfagging thereby earning unto
himself eternal gratitude from them and all who are interested in their
history

And seldom had small boys more need of a friend for the morning after
the siege the storm burst upon the rebels in all its violence Flashman
laid wait and caught Tom before second lesson and receiving a
pointblank No when told to fetch his hat seized him and twisted his
arm and went through the other methods of torture in use He couldnt
make me cry though as Tom said triumphantly to the rest of the
rebels and I kicked his shins well I know And soon it crept
out that a lot of the fags were in league and Flashman excited his
associates to join him in bringing the young vagabonds to their senses
and the house was filled with constant chasings and sieges and
lickings of all sorts and in return the bullies beds were pulled to
pieces and drenched with water and their names written up on the walls
with every insulting epithet which the fag invention could furnish The
war in short raged fiercely but soon as Diggs had told them all
the better fellows in the fifth gave up trying to fag them and public
feeling began to set against Flashman and his two or three intimates
and they were obliged to keep their doings more secret but being
thorough bad fellows missed no opportunity of torturing in private
Flashman was an adept in all ways but above all in the power of saying
cutting and cruel things and could often bring tears to the eyes of
boys in this way which all the thrashings in the world wouldnt have
wrung from them

And as his operations were being cut short in other directions he now
devoted himself chiefly to Tom and East who lived at his own door and
would force himself into their study whenever he found a chance and sit
there sometimes alone and sometimes with a companion interrupting all
their work and exulting in the evident pain which every now and then he
could see he was inflicting on one or the other

The storm had cleared the air for the rest of the house and a better
state of things now began than there had been since old Brooke had left
but an angry dark spot of thundercloud still hung over the end of the
passage where Flashmans study and that of East and Tom lay

He felt that they had been the first rebels and that the rebellion had
been to a great extent successful but what above all stirred the
hatred and bitterness of his heart against them was that in the frequent
collisions which there had been of late they had openly called him
coward and sneak The taunts were too true to be forgiven While he
was in the act of thrashing them they would roar out instances of his
funking at football or shirking some encounter with a lout of half his
own size These things were all well enough known in the house but
to have his own disgrace shouted out by small boys to feel that they
despised him to be unable to silence them by any amount of torture and
to see the open laugh and sneer of his own associates who were looking
on and took no trouble to hide their scorn from him though they
neither interfered with his bullying nor lived a bit the less intimately
with him made him beside himself Come what might he would make those
boys lives miserable So the strife settled down into a personal affair
between Flashman and our youngstersa war to the knife to be fought
out in the little cockpit at the end of the bottom passage

Flashman be it said was about seventeen years old and big and strong
of his age He played well at all games where pluck wasnt much wanted
and managed generally to keep up appearances where it was and having
a bluff offhand manner which passed for heartiness and considerable
powers of being pleasant when he liked went down with the school in
general for a good fellow enough Even in the Schoolhouse by dint of
his command of money the constant supply of good things which he kept
up and his adroit toadyism he had managed to make himself not only
tolerated but rather popular amongst his own contemporaries although
young Brooke scarcely spoke to him and one or two others of the right
sort showed their opinions of him whenever a chance offered But the
wrong sort happened to be in the ascendant just now and so Flashman
was a formidable enemy for small boys This soon became plain enough
Flashman left no slander unspoken and no deed undone which could in
any way hurt his victims or isolate them from the rest of the
house One by one most of the other rebels fell away from them while
Flashmans cause prospered and several other fifthform boys began to
look black at them and illtreat them as they passed about the house By
keeping out of bounds or at all events out of the house and quadrangle
all day and carefully barring themselves in at night East and Tom
managed to hold on without feeling very miserable but it was as much as
they could do Greatly were they drawn then towards old Diggs who in
an uncouth way began to take a good deal of notice of them and once
or twice came to their study when Flashman was there who immediately
decamped in consequence The boys thought that Diggs must have been
watching

When therefore about this time an auction was one night announced to
take place in the hall at which amongst the superfluities of other
boys all Diggss penates for the time being were going to the hammer
East and Tom laid their heads together and resolved to devote their
ready cash some four shillings sterling to redeem such articles as
that sum would cover Accordingly they duly attended to bid and
Tom became the owner of two lots of Diggss thingsLot 1 price
oneandthreepence consisting as the auctioneer remarked of a
valuable assortment of old metals in the shape of a mousetrap a
cheesetoaster without a handle and a saucepan Lot 2 of a
villainous dirty tablecloth and greenbaize curtain while East for
oneandsixpence purchased a leather papercase with a lock but no
key once handsome but now much the worse for wear But they had still
the point to settle of how to get Diggs to take the things without
hurting his feelings This they solved by leaving them in his study
which was never locked when he was out Diggs who had attended the
auction remembered who had bought the lots and came to their study
soon after and sat silent for some time cracking his great red
fingerjoints Then he laid hold of their verses and began looking over
and altering them and at last got up and turning his back to them
said Youre uncommon goodhearted little beggars you two I value
that papercase my sister gave it to me last holidays I wont
forget And so he tumbled out into the passage leaving them somewhat
embarrassed but not sorry that he knew what they had done

The next morning was Saturday the day on which the allowances of one
shilling a week were paidan important event to spendthrift youngsters
and great was the disgust amongst the small fry to hear that all the
allowances had been impounded for the Derby lottery That great event
in the English year the Derby was celebrated at Rugby in those days
by many lotteries It was not an improving custom I own gentle reader
and led to making books and betting and other objectionable results
but when our great Houses of Palaver think it right to stop the nations
business on that day and many of the members bet heavily themselves can
you blame us boys for following the example of our betters At any rate
we did follow it First there was the great school lottery where the
first prize was six or seven pounds then each house had one or more
separate lotteries These were all nominally voluntary no boy being
compelled to put in his shilling who didnt choose to do so But besides
Flashman there were three or four other fast sporting young gentlemen
in the Schoolhouse who considered subscription a matter of duty and
necessity and so to make their duty come easy to the small
boys quietly secured the allowances in a lump when given out for
distribution and kept them It was no use grumblingso many fewer
tartlets and apples were eaten and fives balls bought on that Saturday
and after lockingup when the money would otherwise have been spent
consolation was carried to many a small boy by the sound of the
nightfags shouting along the passages Gentlemen sportsmen of the
Schoolhouse the lotterys going to be drawn in the hall It was
pleasant to be called a gentleman sportsman also to have a chance of
drawing a favourite horse

The hall was full of boys and at the head of one of the long tables
stood the sporting interest with a hat before them in which were the
tickets folded up One of them then began calling out the list of the
house Each boy as his name was called drew a ticket from the hat and
opened it and most of the bigger boys after drawing left the hall
directly to go back to their studies or the fifthform room The
sporting interest had all drawn blanks and they were sulky accordingly
neither of the favourites had yet been drawn and it had come down to
the upperfourth So now as each small boy came up and drew his ticket
it was seized and opened by Flashman or some other of the standersby
But no great favourite is drawn until it comes to the Tadpoles turn
and he shuffles up and draws and tries to make off but is caught and
his ticket is opened like the rest

Here you are Wandererthe third favourite shouts the opener

I say just give me my ticket please remonstrates Tadpole

Hullo dont be in a hurry breaks in Flashman whatll you sell
Wanderer for now

I dont want to sell rejoins Tadpole

Oh dont you Now listen you young fool you dont know anything
about it the horse is no use to you He wont win but I want him as a
hedge Now Ill give you half a crown for him Tadpole holds out but
between threats and cajoleries at length sells half for one shilling and
sixpenceabout a fifth of its fair market value however he is glad to
realize anything and as he wisely remarks Wanderer maynt win and
the tizzy is safe anyhow

East presently comes up and draws a blank Soon after comes Toms turn
His ticket like the others is seized and opened Here you are then
shouts the opener holding it upHarkawayBy Jove Flashey your
young friends in luck

Give me the ticket says Flashman with an oath leaning across the
table with open hand and his face black with rage

Wouldnt you like it replies the opener not a bad fellow at the
bottom and no admirer of Flashman Here Brown catch hold And he
hands the ticket to Tom who pockets it Whereupon Flashman makes for
the door at once that Tom and the ticket may not escape and there
keeps watch until the drawing is over and all the boys are gone except
the sporting set of five or six who stay to compare books make bets
and so on Tom who doesnt choose to move while Flashman is at the
door and East who stays by his friend anticipating trouble The
sporting set now gathered round Tom Public opinion wouldnt allow them
actually to rob him of his ticket but any humbug or intimidation by
which he could be driven to sell the whole or part at an undervalue was
lawful

Now young Brown come whatll you sell me Harkaway for I hear he
isnt going to start Ill give you five shillings for him begins
the boy who had opened the ticket Tom remembering his good deed and
moreover in his forlorn state wishing to make a friend is about
to accept the offer when another cries out Ill give you seven
shillings Tom hesitated and looked from one to the other

No no said Flashman pushing in leave me to deal with him well
draw lots for it afterwards Now sir you know me youll sell Harkaway
to us for five shillings or youll repent it

I wont sell a bit of him answered Tom shortly

You hear that now said Flashman turning to the others Hes the
coxiest young blackguard in the house I always told you so Were
to have all the trouble and risk of getting up the lotteries for the
benefit of such fellows as he

Flashman forgets to explain what risk they ran but he speaks to willing
ears Gambling makes boys selfish and cruel as well as men

Thats true We always draw blanks cried oneNow sir you shall
sell half at any rate

I wont said Tom flushing up to his hair and lumping them all in
his mind with his sworn enemy

Very well then lets roast him cried Flashman and catches hold of
Tom by the collar One or two boys hesitate but the rest join in East
seizes Toms arm and tries to pull him away but is knocked back by
one of the boys and Tom is dragged along struggling His shoulders are
pushed against the mantelpiece and he is held by main force before the
fire Flashman drawing his trousers tight by way of extra torture Poor
East in more pain even than Tom suddenly thinks of Diggs and darts
off to find him Will you sell now for ten shillings says one boy who
is relenting

Tom only answers by groans and struggles

I say Flashey he has had enough says the same boy dropping the arm
he holds

No no another turnll do it answers Flashman But poor Tom is done
already turns deadly pale and his head falls forward on his breast
just as Diggs in frantic excitement rushes into the hall with East at
his heels

You cowardly brutes is all he can say as he catches Tom from them
and supports him to the hall table Good God hes dying Here get
some cold waterrun for the housekeeper

Flashman and one or two others slink away the rest ashamed and
sorry bend over Tom or run for water while East darts off for the
housekeeper Water comes and they throw it on his hands and face and
he begins to come to Motherthe words came feebly and slowlyits
very cold tonight Poor old Diggs is blubbering like a child Where
am I goes on Tom opening his eyes Ah I remember now And he shut
his eyes again and groaned

I say is whispered we cant do any good and the housekeeper will
be here in a minute And all but one steal away He stays with Diggs
silent and sorrowful and fans Toms face

The housekeeper comes in with strong salts and Tom soon recovers enough
to sit up There is a smell of burning She examines his clothes and
looks up inquiringly The boys are silent

How did he come so No answer Theres been some bad work here she
adds looking very serious and I shall speak to the Doctor about it
Still no answer

Hadnt we better carry him to the sickroom suggests Diggs

Oh I can walk now says Tom and supported by East and the
housekeeper goes to the sickroom The boy who held his ground is soon
amongst the rest who are all in fear of their lives Did he peach
Does she know about it

Not a word hes a stanch little fellow And pausing a moment he
adds Im sick of this work what brutes weve been

Meantime Tom is stretched on the sofa in the housekeepers room with
East by his side while she gets wine and water and other restoratives

Are you much hurt dear old boy whispers East

Only the back of my legs answers Tom They are indeed badly scorched
and part of his trousers burnt through But soon he is in bed with
cold bandages At first he feels broken and thinks of writing home and
getting taken away and the verse of a hymn he had learned years ago
sings through his head and he goes to sleep murmuring


Where the wicked cease from troubling And the weary are at rest


But after a sound nights rest the old boyspirit comes back again
East comes in reporting that the whole house is with him and he
forgets everything except their old resolve never to be beaten by that
bully Flashman

Not a word could the housekeeper extract from either of them and though
the Doctor knew all that she knew that morning he never knew any more

I trust and believe that such scenes are not possible now at school
and that lotteries and bettingbooks have gone out but I am writing of
schools as they were in our time and must give the evil with the good



CHAPTER IXA CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS

 Wherein I speak of most disastrous chances
 Of moving accidents by flood and field
 Of hairbreadth scapesSHAKESPEARE

When Tom came back into school after a couple of days in the sickroom
he found matters much changed for the better as East had led him to
expect Flashmans brutality had disgusted most even of his intimate
friends and his cowardice had once more been made plain to the house
for Diggs had encountered him on the morning after the lottery and
after high words on both sides had struck him and the blow was not
returned However Flashey was not unused to this sort of thing and had
lived through as awkward affairs before and as Diggs had said fed and
toadied himself back into favour again Two or three of the boys who had
helped to roast Tom came up and begged his pardon and thanked him for
not telling anything Morgan sent for him and was inclined to take the
matter up warmly but Tom begged him not to do it to which he agreed
on Toms promising to come to him at once in futurea promise which I
regret to say he didnt keep Tom kept Harkaway all to himself and
won the second prize in the lottery some thirty shillings which he and
East contrived to spend in about three days in the purchase of pictures
for their study two new bats and a cricketballall the best that
could be gotand a supper of sausages kidneys and beefsteak pies
to all the rebels Light come light go they wouldnt have been
comfortable with money in their pockets in the middle of the half

The embers of Flashmans wrath however were still smouldering and
burst out every now and then in sly blows and taunts and they both
felt that they hadnt quite done with him yet It wasnt long however
before the last act of that drama came and with it the end of bullying
for Tom and East at Rugby They now often stole out into the hall at
nights incited thereto partly by the hope of finding Diggs there and
having a talk with him partly by the excitement of doing something
which was against rules for sad to say both of our youngsters since
their loss of character for steadiness in their form had got into
the habit of doing things which were forbidden as a matter of
adventurejust in the same way I should fancy as men fall into
smuggling and for the same sort of reasonsthoughtlessness in the
first place It never occurred to them to consider why such and such
rules were laid down the reason was nothing to them and they only
looked upon rules as a sort of challenge from the rulemakers which it
would be rather bad pluck in them not to accept and then again in the
lower parts of the school they hadnt enough to do The work of the form
they could manage to get through pretty easily keeping a good enough
place to get their regular yearly remove and not having much ambition
beyond this their whole superfluous steam was available for games and
scrapes Now one rule of the house which it was a daily pleasure of all
such boys to break was that after supper all fags except the three
on duty in the passages should remain in their own studies until nine
oclock and if caught about the passages or hall or in one anothers
studies they were liable to punishments or caning The rule was
stricter than its observance for most of the sixth spent their evenings
in the fifthform room where the library was and the lessons were
learnt in common Every now and then however a praepostor would be
seized with a fit of district visiting and would make a tour of
the passages and hall and the fags studies Then if the owner were
entertaining a friend or two the first kick at the door and ominous
Open here had the effect of the shadow of a hawk over a chickenyard
every one cut to coverone small boy diving under the sofa another
under the table while the owner would hastily pull down a book or
two and open them and cry out in a meek voice Hullo whos there
casting an anxious eye round to see that no protruding leg or elbow
could betray the hidden boys Open sir directly its Snooks
Oh Im very sorry I didnt know it was you Snooks And then with
wellfeigned zeal the door would be opened young hopeful praying that
that beast Snooks mightnt have heard the scuffle caused by his coming
If a study was empty Snooks proceeded to draw the passages and hall to
find the truants

Well one evening in forbidden hours Tom and East were in the hall
They occupied the seats before the fire nearest the door while Diggs
sprawled as usual before the farther fire He was busy with a copy of
verses and East and Tom were chatting together in whispers by the light
of the fire and splicing a favourite old fives bat which had sprung
Presently a step came down the bottom passage They listened a moment
assured themselves that it wasnt a praepostor and then went on with
their work and the door swung open and in walked Flashman He didnt
see Diggs and thought it a good chance to keep his hand in and as the
boys didnt move for him struck one of them to make them get out of
his way

Whats that for growled the assaulted one

Because I choose Youve no business here Go to your study

You cant send us

Cant I Then Ill thrash you if you stay said Flashman savagely

I say you two said Diggs from the end of the hall rousing up and
resting himself on his elbowyoull never get rid of that fellow till
you lick him Go in at him both of you Ill see fair play

Flashman was taken aback and retreated two steps East looked at
Tom Shall we try said he Yes said Tom desperately So the two
advanced on Flashman with clenched fists and beating hearts They were
about up to his shoulder but tough boys of their age and in perfect
training while he though strong and big was in poor condition from
his monstrous habit of stuffing and want of exercise Coward as he was
however Flashman couldnt swallow such an insult as this besides he
was confident of having easy work and so faced the boys saying You
impudent young blackguards Before he could finish his abuse they
rushed in on him and began pummelling at all of him which they could
reach He hit out wildly and savagely but the full force of his blows
didnt tellthey were too near to him It was long odds though in
point of strength and in another minute Tom went spinning backwards
over a form and Flashman turned to demolish East with a savage grin
But now Diggs jumped down from the table on which he had seated himself
Stop there shouted he the rounds overhalfminute time allowed

What the  is it to you faltered Flashman who began to lose heart

Im going to see fair I tell you said Diggs with a grin and
snapping his great red fingers taint fair for you to be fighting one
of them at a timeAre you ready Brown Times up

The small boys rushed in again Closing they saw was their best
chance and Flashman was wilder and more flurried than ever he caught
East by the throat and tried to force him back on the ironbound table
Tom grasped his waist and remembering the old throw he had learned
in the Vale from Harry Winburn crooked his leg inside Flashmans and
threw his whole weight forward The three tottered for a moment and
then over they went on to the floor Flashman striking his head against
a form in the hall

The two youngsters sprang to their legs but he lay there still They
began to be frightened Tom stooped down and then cried out scared
out of his wits Hes bleeding awfully Come here East Diggs hes
dying

Not he said Diggs getting leisurely off the table its all sham
hes only afraid to fight it out

East was as frightened as Tom Diggs lifted Flashmans head and he
groaned

Whats the matter shouted Diggs

My skulls fractured sobbed Flashman

Oh let me run for the housekeeper cried Tom What shall we do

Fiddlesticks Its nothing but the skin broken said the relentless
Diggs feeling his head Cold water and a bit of rags all hell want

Let me go said Flashman surlily sitting up I dont want your
help

Were really very sorry began East

Hang your sorrow answered Flashman holding his handkerchief to the
place you shall pay for this I can tell you both of you And he
walked out of the hall

He cant be very bad said Tom with a deep sigh much relieved to see
his enemy march so well

Not he said Diggs and youll see you wont be troubled with him any
more But I say your heads broken too your collar is covered with
blood

Is it though said Tom putting up his hand I didnt know it

Well mop it up or youll have your jacket spoilt And you have got a
nasty eye Scud Youd better go and bathe it well in cold water

Cheap enough too if were done with our old friend Flashey said
East as they made off upstairs to bathe their wounds

They had done with Flashman in one sense for he never laid finger on
either of them again but whatever harm a spiteful heart and venomous
tongue could do them he took care should be done Only throw dirt
enough and some of it is sure to stick and so it was with the fifth
form and the bigger boys in general with whom he associated more or
less and they not at all Flashman managed to get Tom and East into
disfavour which did not wear off for some time after the author of it
had disappeared from the School world This event much prayed for
by the small fry in general took place a few months after the above
encounter One fine summer evening Flashman had been regaling himself on
ginpunch at Brownsover and having exceeded his usual limits started
home uproarious He fell in with a friend or two coming back from
bathing proposed a glass of beer to which they assented the weather
being hot and they thirsty souls and unaware of the quantity of drink
which Flashman had already on board The short result was that Flashey
became beastly drunk They tried to get him along but couldnt so they
chartered a hurdle and two men to carry him One of the masters came
upon them and they naturally enough fled The flight of the rest raised
the masters suspicions and the good angel of the fags incited him
to examine the freight and after examination to convoy the hurdle
himself up to the Schoolhouse and the Doctor who had long had his eye
on Flashman arranged for his withdrawal next morning

The evil that men and boys too do lives after them Flashman was gone
but our boys as hinted above still felt the effects of his hate
Besides they had been the movers of the strike against unlawful
fagging The cause was righteousthe result had been triumphant to a
great extent but the best of the fiftheven those who had never fagged
the small boys or had given up the practice cheerfullycouldnt help
feeling a small grudge against the first rebels After all their form
had been defied on just grounds no doubtso just indeed that they
had at once acknowledged the wrong and remained passive in the strife
Had they sided with Flashman and his set the rebels must have given way
at once They couldnt help on the whole being glad that they had so
acted and that the resistance had been successful against such of their
own form as had shown fight they felt that law and order had gained
thereby but the ringleaders they couldnt quite pardon at once
Confoundedly coxy those young rascals will get if we dont mind was
the general feeling

So it is and must be always my dear boys If the angel Gabriel were
to come down from heaven and head a successful rise against the most
abominable and unrighteous vested interest which this poor old world
groans under he would most certainly lose his character for many years
probably for centuries not only with the upholders of said vested
interest but with the respectable mass of the people whom he had
delivered They wouldnt ask him to dinner or let their names appear
with his in the papers they would be very careful how they spoke of
him in the Palaver or at their clubs What can we expect then when we
have only poor gallant blundering men like Kossuth Garibaldi Mazzini
and righteous causes which do not triumph in their handsmen who
have holes enough in their armour God knows easy to be hit by
respectabilities sitting in their lounging chairs and having large
balances at their bankers But you are brave gallant boys who hate
easychairs and have no balances or bankers You only want to have
your heads set straight to take the right side so bear in mind that
majorities especially respectable ones are nine times out of ten in
the wrong and that if you see a man or boy striving earnestly on the
weak side however wrongheaded or blundering he may be you are not to
go and join the cry against him If you cant join him and help him and
make him wiser at any rate remember that he has found something in the
world which he will fight and suffer for which is just what you have
got to do for yourselves and so think and speak of him tenderly

So East and Tom the Tadpole and one or two more became a sort of
young Ishmaelites their hands against every one and every ones hand
against them It has been already told how they got to war with the
masters and the fifth form and with the sixth it was much the same
They saw the praepostors cowed by or joining with the fifth and shirking
their own duties so they didnt respect them and rendered no willing
obedience It had been one thing to clean out studies for sons of heroes
like old Brooke but was quite another to do the like for Snooks and
Green who had never faced a good scrummage at football and couldnt
keep the passages in order at night So they only slurred through their
fagging just well enough to escape a licking and not always that and
got the character of sulky unwilling fags In the fifthform room
after supper when such matters were often discussed and arranged their
names were for ever coming up

I say Green Snooks began one night isnt that new boy Harrison
your fag

Yes why

Oh I know something of him at home and should like to excuse him
Will you swop

Who will you give me

Well lets see Theres Willis Johnson No that wont do Yes I
have it Theres young East Ill give you him

Dont you wish you may get it replied Green Ill give you two for
Willis if you like

Who then asked Snooks Hall and Brown

Wouldnt have em at a gift

Better than East though for they aint quite so sharp said Green
getting up and leaning his back against the mantelpiece He wasnt a bad
fellow and couldnt help not being able to put down the unruly fifth
form His eye twinkled as he went on Did I ever tell you how the young
vagabond sold me last half

No how

Well he never half cleaned my study outonly just stuck the
candlesticks in the cupboard and swept the crumbs on to the floor So
at last I was mortal angry and had him up and made him go through the
whole performance under my eyes The dust the young scamp made nearly
choked me and showed that he hadnt swept the carpet before Well when
it was all finished Now young gentleman says I mind I expect
this to be done every morningfloor swept tablecloth taken off and
shaken and everything dusted Very well grunts he Not a bit of
it though I was quite sure in a day or two that he never took the
tablecloth off even So I laid a trap for him I tore up some paper
and put half a dozen bits on my table one night and the cloth over them
as usual Next morning after breakfast up I came pulled off the cloth
and sure enough there was the paper which fluttered down on to the
floor I was in a towering rage Ive got you now thought I and sent
for him while I got out my cane Up he came as cool as you please with
his hands in his pockets Didnt I tell you to shake my tablecloth
every morning roared I Yes says he Did you do it this morning
Yes You young liar I put these pieces of paper on the table last
night and if youd taken the tablecloth off youd have seen them so
Im going to give you a good licking Then my youngster takes one hand
out of his pocket and just stoops down and picks up two of the bits
of paper and holds them out to me There was written on each in great
round text Harry East his mark The young rogue had found my
trap out taken away my paper and put some of his there every bit
earmarked Id a great mind to lick him for his impudence but after
all one has no right to be laying traps so I didnt Of course I was
at his mercy till the end of the half and in his weeks my study was so
frowzy I couldnt sit in it

They spoil ones things so too chimed in a third boy Hall and
Brown were nightfags last week I called fag and gave them my
candlesticks to clean Away they went and didnt appear again When
theyd had time enough to clean them three times over I went out to
look after them They werent in the passages so down I went into the
hall where I heard music and there I found them sitting on the table
listening to Johnson who was playing the flute and my candlesticks
stuck between the bars well into the fire redhot clean spoiled
Theyve never stood straight since and I must get some more However I
gave them a good licking thats one comfort

Such were the sort of scrapes they were always getting into and so
partly by their own faults partly from circumstances partly from the
faults of others they found themselves outlaws ticketofleave men or
what you will in that linein short dangerous partiesand lived the
sort of handtomouth wild reckless life which such parties generally
have to put up with Nevertheless they never quite lost favour with
young Brooke who was now the cock of the house and just getting into
the sixth and Diggs stuck to them like a man and gave them store of
good advice by which they never in the least profited

And even after the house mended and law and order had been restored
which soon happened after young Brooke and Diggs got into the sixth
they couldnt easily or at once return into the paths of steadiness and
many of the old wild outofbounds habits stuck to them as firmly as
ever While they had been quite little boys the scrapes they got into
in the School hadnt much mattered to any one but now they were in the
upper school all wrongdoers from which were sent up straight to the
Doctor at once So they began to come under his notice and as they were
a sort of leaders in a small way amongst their own contemporaries his
eye which was everywhere was upon them

It was a tossup whether they turned out well or ill and so they were
just the boys who caused most anxiety to such a master You have been
told of the first occasion on which they were sent up to the Doctor and
the remembrance of it was so pleasant that they had much less fear of
him than most boys of their standing had Its all his look Tom used
to say to East that frightens fellows Dont you remember he never
said anything to us my first halfyear for being an hour late for
lockingup

The next time that Tom came before him however the interview was of
a very different kind It happened just about the time at which we have
now arrived and was the first of a series of scrapes into which our
hero managed now to tumble

The river Avon at Rugby is a slow and not very clear stream in which
chub dace roach and other coarse fish are or were plentiful
enough together with a fair sprinkling of small jack but no fish worth
sixpence either for sport or food It is however a capital river for
bathing as it has many nice small pools and several good reaches for
swimming all within about a mile of one another and at an easy twenty
minutes walk from the school This mile of water is rented or used to
be rented for bathing purposes by the trustees of the School for the
boys The footpath to Brownsover crosses the river by the Planks a
curious old singleplank bridge running for fifty or sixty yards into
the flat meadows on each side of the riverfor in the winter there
are frequent floods Above the Planks were the bathingplaces for the
smaller boysSleaths the first bathingplace where all new boys
had to begin until they had proved to the bathing men three steady
individuals who were paid to attend daily through the summer to prevent
accidents that they could swim pretty decently when they were allowed
to go on to Ansteys about one hundred and fifty yards below Here
there was a hole about six feet deep and twelve feet across over which
the puffing urchins struggled to the opposite side and thought no small
beer of themselves for having been out of their depths Below the Planks
came larger and deeper holes the first of which was Wratislaws and
the last Swifts a famous hole ten or twelve feet deep in parts and
thirty yards across from which there was a fine swimming reach right
down to the mill Swifts was reserved for the sixth and fifth forms
and had a spring board and two sets of steps the others had one set of
steps each and were used indifferently by all the lower boys though
each house addicted itself more to one hole than to another The
Schoolhouse at this time affected Wratislaws hole and Tom and East
who had learnt to swim like fishes were to be found there as regular as
the clock through the summer always twice and often three times a day

Now the boys either had or fancied they had a right also to fish at
their pleasure over the whole of this part of the river and would not
understand that the right if any only extended to the Rugby side As
illluck would have it the gentleman who owned the opposite bank after
allowing it for some time without interference had ordered his keepers
not to let the boys fish on his sidethe consequence of which had been
that there had been first wranglings and then fights between the keepers
and boys and so keen had the quarrel become that the landlord and his
keepers after a ducking had been inflicted on one of the latter and
a fierce fight ensued thereon had been up to the great school at
callingover to identify the delinquents and it was all the Doctor
himself and five or six masters could do to keep the peace Not even his
authority could prevent the hissing and so strong was the feeling that
the four praepostors of the week walked up the school with their canes
shouting Ssssilencccce at the top of their voices However
the chief offenders for the time were flogged and kept in bounds but
the victorious party had brought a nice hornets nest about their ears
The landlord was hissed at the Schoolgates as he rode past and when he
charged his horse at the mob of boys and tried to thrash them with
his whip was driven back by cricketbats and wickets and pursued with
pebbles and fives balls while the wretched keepers lives were a burden
to them from having to watch the waters so closely

The Schoolhouse boys of Toms standing one and all as a protest
against this tyranny and cutting short of their lawful amusements took
to fishing in all ways and especially by means of nightlines The
little tacklemaker at the bottom of the town would soon have made his
fortune had the rage lasted and several of the barbers began to lay in
fishingtackle The boys had this great advantage over their enemies
that they spent a large portion of the day in natures garb by the
riverside and so when tired of swimming would get out on the other
side and fish or set nightlines till the keepers hove in sight and
then plunge in and swim back and mix with the other bathers and the
keepers were too wise to follow across the stream

While things were in this state one day Tom and three or four others
were bathing at Wratislaws and had as a matter of course been taking
up and resetting nightlines They had all left the water and were
sitting or standing about at their toilets in all costumes from
a shirt upwards when they were aware of a man in a velveteen
shootingcoat approaching from the other side He was a new keeper so
they didnt recognize or notice him till he pulled up right opposite
and began

I seed some of you young gentlemen over this side afishing just now

Hullo who are you What business is that of yours old Velveteens

Im the new underkeeper and masters told me to keep a sharp lookout
on all o you young chaps And I tells ee I means business and youd
better keep on your own side or we shall fall out

Well thats right Velveteens speak out and lets know your mind at
once

Look here old boy cried East holding up a miserable coarse fish
or two and a small jack would you like to smell em and see which bank
they lived under

Ill give you a bit of advice keeper shouted Tom who was sitting
in his shirt paddling with his feet in the river youd better go down
there to Swifts where the big boys are theyre beggars at setting
lines andll put you up to a wrinkle or two for catching the
fivepounders Tom was nearest to the keeper and that officer who was
getting angry at the chaff fixed his eyes on our hero as if to take a
note of him for future use Tom returned his gaze with a steady stare
and then broke into a laugh and struck into the middle of a favourite
Schoolhouse song

 As I and my companions
 Were setting of a snare
 The gamekeeper was watching us
 For him we did not care
 For we can wrestle and fight my boys
 And jump out anywhere
 For its my delight of a likely night
 In the season of the year

The chorus was taken up by the other boys with shouts of laughter and
the keeper turned away with a grunt but evidently bent on mischief The
boys thought no more of the matter

But now came on the Mayfly season the soft hazy summer weather lay
sleepily along the rich meadows by Avon side and the green and gray
flies flickered with their graceful lazy upanddown flight over
the reeds and the water and the meadows in myriads upon myriads
The Mayflies must surely be the lotuseaters of the ephemeraethe
happiest laziest carelessest fly that dances and dreams out his few
hours of sunshiny life by English rivers

Every little pitiful coarse fish in the Avon was on the alert for
the flies and gorging his wretched carcass with hundreds daily the
gluttonous rogues and every lover of the gentle craft was out to avenge
the poor Mayflies

So one fine Thursday afternoon Tom having borrowed Easts new rod
started by himself to the river He fished for some time with small
successnot a fish would rise at him but as he prowled along the bank
he was presently aware of mighty ones feeding in a pool on the opposite
side under the shade of a huge willowtree The stream was deep
here but some fifty yards below was a shallow for which he made off
hotfoot and forgetting landlords keepers solemn prohibitions of the
Doctor and everything else pulled up his trousers plunged across and
in three minutes was creeping along on all fours towards the clump of
willows

It isnt often that great chub or any other coarse fish are in earnest
about anything but just then they were thoroughly bent on feeding and
in half an hour Master Tom had deposited three thumping fellows at the
foot of the giant willow As he was baiting for a fourth pounder and
just going to throw in again he became aware of a man coming up the
bank not one hundred yards off Another look told him that it was the
underkeeper Could he reach the shallow before him No not carrying
his rod Nothing for it but the tree So Tom laid his bones to it
shinning up as fast as he could and dragging up his rod after him He
had just time to reach and crouch along upon a huge branch some ten feet
up which stretched out over the river when the keeper arrived at the
clump Toms heart beat fast as he came under the tree two steps more
and he would have passed when as illluck would have it the gleam on
the scales of the dead fish caught his eye and he made a dead point
at the foot of the tree He picked up the fish one by one his eye and
touch told him that they had been alive and feeding within the hour Tom
crouched lower along the branch and heard the keeper beating the clump
If I could only get the rod hidden thought he and began gently
shifting it to get it alongside of him willowtrees dont throw out
straight hickory shoots twelve feet long with no leaves worse luck
Alas the keeper catches the rustle and then a sight of the rod and
then of Toms hand and arm

Oh be up ther be ee says he running under the tree Now you
come down this minute

Treed at last thinks Tom making no answer and keeping as close as
possible but working away at the rod which he takes to pieces Im
in for it unless I can starve him out And then he begins to meditate
getting along the branch for a plunge and scramble to the other side
but the small branches are so thick and the opposite bank so difficult
that the keeper will have lots of time to get round by the ford before
he can get out so he gives that up And now he hears the keeper
beginning to scramble up the trunk That will never do so he scrambles
himself back to where his branch joins the trunk and stands with lifted
rod

Hullo Velveteens mind your fingers if you come any higher

The keeper stops and looks up and then with a grin says Oh be you
be it young measter Well heres luck Now I tells ee to come down at
once and tll be best for ee

Thank ee Velveteens Im very comfortable said Tom shortening the
rod in his hand and preparing for battle

Werry well please yourself says the keeper descending however
to the ground again and taking his seat on the bank I beant in no
hurry so you may take your time Ill larn ee to gee honest folk
names afore Ive done with ee

My luck as usual thinks Tom what a fool I was to give him a black
If Id called him keeper now I might get off The return match is
all his way

The keeper quietly proceeded to take out his pipe fill and light it
keeping an eye on Tom who now sat disconsolately across the branch
looking at keepera pitiful sight for men and fishes The more he
thought of it the less he liked it It must be getting near second
callingover thinks he Keeper smokes on stolidly If he takes me up
I shall be flogged safe enough I cant sit here all night Wonder if
hell rise at silver

I say keeper said he meekly let me go for two bob

Not for twenty neither grunts his persecutor

And so they sat on till long past second callingover and the sun came
slanting in through the willowbranches and telling of lockingup near
at hand

Im coming down keeper said Tom at last with a sigh fairly tired
out Now what are you going to do

Walk ee up to School and give ee over to the Doctor thems my
orders says Velveteens knocking the ashes out of his fourth pipe and
standing up and shaking himself

Very good said Tom but hands off you know Ill go with you
quietly so no collaring or that sort of thing

Keeper looked at him a minute Werry good said he at last And so Tom
descended and wended his way drearily by the side of the keeper up to
the Schoolhouse where they arrived just at lockingup As they passed
the Schoolgates the Tadpole and several others who were standing there
caught the state of things and rushed out crying Rescue But Tom
shook his head so they only followed to the Doctors gate and went
back sorely puzzled

How changed and stern the Doctor seemed from the last time that Tom was
up there as the keeper told the story not omitting to state how Tom
had called him blackguard names Indeed sir broke in the culprit
it was only Velveteens The Doctor only asked one question

You know the rule about the banks Brown

Yes sir

Then wait for me tomorrow after first lesson

I thought so muttered Tom

And about the rod sir went on the keeper Masters told we as we
might have all the rods

Oh please sir broke in Tom the rod isnt mine

The Doctor looked puzzled but the keeper who was a goodhearted
fellow and melted at Toms evident distress gave up his claim Tom
was flogged next morning and a few days afterwards met Velveteens and
presented him with half a crown for giving up the rod claim and they
became sworn friends and I regret to say that Tom had many more fish
from under the willow that Mayfly season and was never caught again by
Velveteens

It wasnt three weeks before Tom and now East by his side were
again in the awful presence This time however the Doctor was not so
terrible A few days before they had been fagged at fives to fetch the
balls that went off the court While standing watching the game they
saw five or six nearly new balls hit on the top of the School I say
Tom said East when they were dismissed couldnt we get those balls
somehow

Lets try anyhow

So they reconnoitred the walls carefully borrowed a coalhammer from
old Stumps bought some big nails and after one or two attempts scaled
the Schools and possessed themselves of huge quantities of fives balls
The place pleased them so much that they spent all their spare time
there scratching and cutting their names on the top of every tower and
at last having exhausted all other places finished up with inscribing
HEAST TBROWN on the minutehand of the great clock in the doing of
which they held the minutehand and disturbed the clocks economy So
next morning when masters and boys came trooping down to prayers and
entered the quadrangle the injured minutehand was indicating three
minutes to the hour They all pulled up and took their time When the
hour struck doors were closed and half the school late Thomas being
set to make inquiry discovers their names on the minutehand and
reports accordingly and they are sent for a knot of their friends
making derisive and pantomimic allusions to what their fate will be as
they walk off

But the Doctor after hearing their story doesnt make much of it and
only gives them thirty lines of Homer to learn by heart and a lecture
on the likelihood of such exploits ending in broken bones

Alas almost the next day was one of the great fairs in the town and as
several rows and other disagreeable accidents had of late taken place
on these occasions the Doctor gives out after prayers in the morning
that no boy is to go down into the town Wherefore East and Tom for
no earthly pleasure except that of doing what they are told not to do
start away after second lesson and making a short circuit through the
fields strike a back lane which leads into the town go down it and
run plump upon one of the masters as they emerge into the High Street
The master in question though a very clever is not a righteous man
He has already caught several of his own pupils and gives them lines
to learn while he sends East and Tom who are not his pupils up to the
Doctor who on learning that they had been at prayers in the morning
flogs them soundly

The flogging did them no good at the time for the injustice of their
captor was rankling in their minds but it was just the end of the half
and on the next evening but one Thomas knocks at their door and says
the Doctor wants to see them They look at one another in silent dismay
What can it be now Which of their countless wrongdoings can he have
heard of officially However its no use delaying so up they go to the
study There they find the Doctor not angry but very graver He has
sent for them to speak to very seriously before they go home They have
each been flogged several times in the halfyear for direct and
wilful breaches of rules This cannot go on They are doing no good to
themselves or others and now they are getting up in the School and
have influence They seem to think that rules are made capriciously and
for the pleasure of the masters but this is not so They are made for
the good of the whole School and must and shall be obeyed Those who
thoughtlessly or wilfully break them will not be allowed to stay at the
School He should be sorry if they had to leave as the School might
do them both much good and wishes them to think very seriously in the
holidays over what he has said Goodnight

And so the two hurry off horribly scared the idea of having to leave
has never crossed their minds and is quite unbearable

As they go out they meet at the door old Holmes a sturdy cheery
praepostor of another house who goes in to the Doctor and they hear
his genial hearty greeting of the newcomer so different to their own
reception as the door closes and return to their study with heavy
hearts and tremendous resolves to break no more rules

Five minutes afterwards the master of their forma late arrival and a
model young masterknocks at the Doctors studydoor Come in And
as he enters the Doctor goes on to HolmesYou see I do not know
anything of the case officially and if I take any notice of it at all
I must publicly expel the boy I dont wish to do that for I think
there is some good in him Theres nothing for it but a good sound
thrashing He paused to shake hands with the master which Holmes does
also and then prepares to leave

I understand Goodnight sir

Goodnight Holmes And remember added the Doctor emphasizing the
words a good sound thrashing before the whole house

The door closed on Holmes and the Doctor in answer to the puzzled
look of his lieutenant explained shortly A gross case of bullying
Wharton the head of the house is a very good fellow but slight and
weak and severe physical pain is the only way to deal with such a
case so I have asked Holmes to take it up He is very careful and
trustworthy and has plenty of strength I wish all the sixth had as
much We must have it here if we are to keep order at all

Now I dont want any wiseacres to read this book but if they should of
course they will prick up their long ears and howl or rather bray at
the above story Very goodI dont object but what I have to add for
you boys is this that Holmes called a levy of his house after breakfast
next morning made them a speech on the case of bullying in question
and then gave the bully a good sound thrashing and that years
afterwards that boy sought out Holmes and thanked him saying it
had been the kindest act which had ever been done upon him and the
turningpoint in his character and a very good fellow he became and a
credit to his School

After some other talk between them the Doctor said I want to speak
to you about two boys in your form East and Brown I have just been
speaking to them What do you think of them

Well they are not hard workers and very thoughtless and full of
spirits but I cant help liking them I think they are sound good
fellows at the bottom

Im glad of it I think so too But they make me very uneasy They are
taking the lead a good deal amongst the fags in my house for they are
very active bold fellows I should be sorry to lose them but I shant
let them stay if I dont see them gaining character and manliness In
another year they may do great harm to all the younger boys

Oh I hope you wont send them away pleaded their master

Not if I can help it But now I never feel sure after any
halfholiday that I shant have to flog one of them next morning for
some foolish thoughtless scrape I quite dread seeing either of them

They were both silent for a minute Presently the Doctor began again

They dont feel that they have any duty or work to do in the school
and how is one to make them feel it

I think if either of them had some little boy to take care of it would
steady them Brown is the most reckless of the two I should say East
wouldnt get into so many scrapes without him

Well said the Doctor with something like a sigh Ill think of it
And they went on to talk of other subjects




PART II

 I hold it truth with him who sings
 To one clear harp in divers tones
 That men may rise on steppingstones
 Of their dead selves to higher things

CHAPTER IHOW THE TIDE TURNED

 Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide
 In the strife of Truth with Falsehood for the good or evil side
    
 Then it is the brave man chooses while the coward stands aside
 Doubting in his abject spirit till his Lord is crucified
 LOWELL

The turningpoint in our heros school career had now come and the
manner of it was as follows On the evening of the first day of the next
halfyear Tom East and another Schoolhouse boy who had just been
dropped at the Spread Eagle by the old Regulator rushed into the
matrons room in high spirits such as all real boys are in when they
first get back however fond they may be of home

Well Mrs Wixie shouted one seizing on the methodical active
little darkeyed woman who was busy stowing away the linen of the boys
who had already arrived into their several pigeonholes here we are
again you see as jolly as ever Let us help you put the things away

And Mary cried another she was called indifferently by either
name whos come back Has the Doctor made old Jones leave How many
new boys are there

Am I and East to have Grays study You know you promised to get it for
us if you could shouted Tom

And am I to sleep in Number 4 roared East

Hows old Sam and Bogle and Sally

Bless the boys cries Mary at last getting in a word why youll
shake me to death There now do go away up to the housekeepers room
and get your suppers you know I havent time to talk Youll find
plenty more in the houseNow Master East do let those things alone
Youre mixing up three new boys things And she rushed at East who
escaped round the open trunks holding up a prize

Hullo look here Tommy shouted he heres fun and he brandished
above his head some pretty little nightcaps beautifully made and
marked the work of loving fingers in some distant country home The
kind mother and sisters who sewed that delicate stitching with aching
hearts little thought of the trouble they might be bringing on the
young head for which they were meant The little matron was wiser and
snatched the caps from East before he could look at the name on them

Now Master East I shall be very angry if you dont go said she
theres some capital cold beef and pickles upstairs and I wont have
you old boys in my room first night

Hurrah for the pickles Come along Tommycome along Smith We shall
find out who the young count is Ill be bound I hope hell sleep in my
room Marys always vicious first week

As the boys turned to leave the room the matron touched Toms arm and
said Master Brown please stop a minute I want to speak to you

Very well Mary Ill come in a minute East Dont finish the
pickles

O Master Brown went on the little matron when the rest had gone
youre to have Grays study Mrs Arnold says And she wants you to
take in this young gentleman Hes a new boy and thirteen years old
though he dont look it Hes very delicate and has never been from
home before And I told Mrs Arnold I thought youd be kind to him and
see that they dont bully him at first Hes put into your form and
Ive given him the bed next to yours in Number 4 so East cant sleep
there this half

Tom was rather put about by this speech He had got the double study
which he coveted but here were conditions attached which greatly
moderated his joy He looked across the room and in the far corner of
the sofa was aware of a slight pale boy with large blue eyes and light
fair hair who seemed ready to shrink through the floor He saw at a
glance that the little stranger was just the boy whose first halfyear
at a public school would be misery to himself if he were left alone or
constant anxiety to any one who meant to see him through his troubles
Tom was too honest to take in the youngster and then let him shift for
himself and if he took him as his chum instead of East where were
all his pet plans of having a bottledbeer cellar under his window and
making nightlines and slings and plotting expeditions to Brownsover
Mills and Caldecotts Spinney East and he had made up their minds to
get this study and then every night from lockingup till ten they would
be together to talk about fishing drink bottledbeer read Marryats
novels and sort birds eggs And this new boy would most likely never
go out of the close and would be afraid of wet feet and always getting
laughed at and called Molly or Jenny or some derogatory feminine
nickname

The matron watched him for a moment and saw what was passing in his
mind and so like a wise negotiator threw in an appeal to his warm
heart Poor little fellow said she in almost a whisper his
fathers dead and hes got no brothers And his mammasuch a kind
sweet ladyalmost broke her heart at leaving him this morning and she
said one of his sisters was like to die of decline and so

Well well burst in Tom with something like a sigh at the effort
I suppose I must give up EastCome along young un Whats your name
Well go and have some supper and then Ill show you our study

His names George Arthur said the matron walking up to him with Tom
who grasped his little delicate hand as the proper preliminary to making
a chum of him and felt as if he could have blown him away Ive had
his books and things put into the study which his mamma has had new
papered and the sofa covered and new greenbaize curtains over the
door the diplomatic matron threw this in to show that the new boy was
contributing largely to the partnership comforts And Mrs Arnold told
me to say she added that she should like you both to come up to tea
with her You know the way Master Brown and the things are just gone
up I know

Here was an announcement for Master Tom He was to go up to tea the
first night just as if he were a sixth or fifth form boy and of
importance in the School world instead of the most reckless young
scapegrace amongst the fags He felt himself lifted on to a higher
social and moral platform at once Nevertheless he couldnt give up
without a sigh the idea of the jolly supper in the housekeepers room
with East and the rest and a rush round to all the studies of his
friends afterwards to pour out the deeds and wonders of the holidays
to plot fifty plans for the coming halfyear and to gather news of who
had left and what new boys had come who had got whos study and where
the new praepostors slept However Tom consoled himself with thinking
that he couldnt have done all this with the new boy at his heels and
so marched off along the passages to the Doctors private house with his
young charge in tow in monstrous goodhumour with himself and all the
world

It is needless and would be impertinent to tell how the two young boys
were received in that drawingroom The lady who presided there is still
living and has carried with her to her peaceful home in the north the
respect and love of all those who ever felt and shared that gentle and
highbred hospitality Ay many is the brave heart now doing its work
and bearing its load in country curacies London chambers under the
Indian sun and in Australian towns and clearings which looks back with
fond and grateful memory to that Schoolhouse drawingroom and dates
much of its highest and best training to the lessons learnt there

Besides Mrs Arnold and one or two of the elder children there were one
of the younger masters young Brooke who was now in the sixth and
had succeeded to his brothers position and influence and another
sixthform boy talking together before the fire The master and young
Brooke now a great strapping fellow six feet high eighteen years old
and powerful as a coalheaver nodded kindly to Tom to his intense
glory and then went on talking The other did not notice them
The hostess after a few kind words which led the boys at once and
insensibly to feel at their ease and to begin talking to one another
left them with her own children while she finished a letter The young
ones got on fast and well Tom holding forth about a prodigious pony he
had been riding out hunting and hearing stories of the winter glories
of the lakes when tea came in and immediately after the Doctor
himself

How frank and kind and manly was his greeting to the party by the
fire It did Toms heart good to see him and young Brooke shake hands
and look one another in the face and he didnt fail to remark that
Brooke was nearly as tall and quite as broad as the Doctor And his cup
was full when in another moment his master turned to him with another
warm shake of the hand and seemingly oblivious of all the late scrapes
which he had been getting into said Ah Brown you here I hope you
left your father and all well at home

Yes sir quite well

And this is the little fellow who is to share your study Well he
doesnt look as we should like to see him He wants some Rugby air and
cricket And you must take him some good long walks to Bilton Grange
and Caldecotts Spinney and show him what a little pretty country we
have about here

Tom wondered if the Doctor knew that his visits to Bilton Grange
were for the purpose of taking rooks nests a proceeding strongly
discountenanced by the owner thereof and those to Caldecotts Spinney
were prompted chiefly by the conveniences for setting nightlines What
didnt the Doctor know And what a noble use he always made of it He
almost resolved to abjure rookpies and nightlines for ever The tea
went merrily off the Doctor now talking of holiday doings and then of
the prospects of the halfyearwhat chance there was for the Balliol
scholarship whether the eleven would be a good one Everybody was at
his ease and everybody felt that he young as he might be was of some
use in the little School world and had a work to do there

Soon after tea the Doctor went off to his study and the young boys a
few minutes afterwards took their leave and went out of the private door
which led from the Doctors house into the middle passage

At the fire at the farther end of the passage was a crowd of boys in
loud talk and laughter There was a sudden pause when the door opened
and then a great shout of greeting as Tom was recognized marching down
the passage

Hullo Brown where do you come from

Oh Ive been to tea with the Doctor says Tom with great dignity

My eye cried East Oh so thats why Mary called you back and you
didnt come to supper You lost something That beef and pickles was no
end good

I say young fellow cried Hall detecting Arthur and catching him by
the collar whats your name Where do you come from How old are you

Tom saw Arthur shrink back and look scared as all the group turned to
him but thought it best to let him answer just standing by his side to
support in case of need

Arthur sir I come from Devonshire

Dont call me sir you young muff How old are you

Thirteen

Can you sing

The poor boy was trembling and hesitating Tom struck inYou be
hanged Tadpole Hell have to sing whether he can or not Saturday
twelve weeks and thats long enough off yet

Do you know him at home Brown

No but hes my chum in Grays old study and its near prayertime
and I havent had a look at it yetCome along Arthur

Away went the two Tom longing to get his charge safe under cover where
he might advise him on his deportment

What a queer chum for Tom Brown was the comment at the fire and it
must be confessed so thought Tom himself as he lighted his candle and
surveyed the new greenbaize curtains and the carpet and sofa with much
satisfaction

I say Arthur what a brick your mother is to make us so cozy But look
here now you must answer straight up when the fellows speak to you and
dont be afraid If youre afraid youll get bullied And dont you
say you can sing and dont you ever talk about home or your mother and
sisters

Poor little Arthur looked ready to cry

But please said he maynt I talk aboutabout home to you

Oh yes I like it But dont talk to boys you dont know or theyll
call you homesick or mammas darling or some such stuff What a jolly
desk Is that yours And what stunning binding Why your schoolbooks
look like novels

And Tom was soon deep in Arthurs goods and chattels all new and good
enough for a fifthform boy and hardly thought of his friends outside
till the prayerbell rang

I have already described the Schoolhouse prayers They were the same on
the first night as on the other nights save for the gaps caused by the
absence of those boys who came late and the line of new boys who stood
all together at the farther tableof all sorts and sizes like young
bears with all their troubles to come as Toms father had said to him
when he was in the same position He thought of it as he looked at the
line and poor little slight Arthur standing with them and as he was
leading him upstairs to Number 4 directly after prayers and showing
him his bed It was a huge high airy room with two large windows
looking on to the School close There were twelve beds in the room The
one in the farthest corner by the fireplace occupied by the sixthform
boy who was responsible for the discipline of the room and the rest
by boys in the lowerfifth and other junior forms all fags for the
fifthform boys as has been said slept in rooms by themselves Being
fags the eldest of them was not more than about sixteen years old and
were all bound to be up and in bed by ten The sixthform boys came to
bed from ten to a quarterpast at which time the old verger came round
to put the candles out except when they sat up to read

Within a few minutes therefore of their entry all the other boys who
slept in Number 4 had come up The little fellows went quietly to their
own beds and began undressing and talking to each other in whispers
while the elder amongst whom was Tom sat chatting about on one
anothers beds with their jackets and waistcoats off Poor little
Arthur was overwhelmed with the novelty of his position The idea of
sleeping in the room with strange boys had clearly never crossed his
mind before and was as painful as it was strange to him He could
hardly bear to take his jacket off however presently with an effort
off it came and then he paused and looked at Tom who was sitting at
the bottom of his bed talking and laughing

Please Brown he whispered may I wash my face and hands

Of course if you like said Tom staring thats your
washhandstand under the window second from your bed Youll have to
go down for more water in the morning if you use it all And on he went
with his talk while Arthur stole timidly from between the beds out
to his washhandstand and began his ablutions thereby drawing for a
moment on himself the attention of the room

On went the talk and laughter Arthur finished his washing and
undressing and put on his nightgown He then looked round more
nervously than ever Two or three of the little boys were already in
bed sitting up with their chins on their knees The light burned clear
the noise went on It was a trying moment for the poor little lonely
boy however this time he didnt ask Tom what he might or might not do
but dropped on his knees by his bedside as he had done every day from
his childhood to open his heart to Him who heareth the cry and beareth
the sorrows of the tender child and the strong man in agony

Tom was sitting at the bottom of his bed unlacing his boots so that his
back was towards Arthur and he didnt see what had happened and looked
up in wonder at the sudden silence Then two or three boys laughed and
sneered and a big brutal fellow who was standing in the middle of the
room picked up a slipper and shied it at the kneeling boy calling him
a snivelling young shaver Then Tom saw the whole and the next moment
the boot he had just pulled off flew straight at the head of the bully
who had just time to throw up his arm and catch it on his elbow

Confound you Brown whats that for roared he stamping with pain

Never mind what I mean said Tom stepping on to the floor every drop
of blood in his body tingling if any fellow wants the other boot he
knows how to get it

What would have been the result is doubtful for at this moment the
sixthform boy came in and not another word could be said Tom and
the rest rushed into bed and finished their unrobing there and the
old verger as punctual as the clock had put out the candle in another
minute and toddled on to the next room shutting their door with his
usual Goodnight genlmn

There were many boys in the room by whom that little scene was taken to
heart before they slept But sleep seemed to have deserted the pillow of
poor Tom For some time his excitement and the flood of memories
which chased one another through his brain kept him from thinking or
resolving His head throbbed his heart leapt and he could hardly keep
himself from springing out of bed and rushing about the room Then the
thought of his own mother came across him and the promise he had made
at her knee years ago never to forget to kneel by his bedside and
give himself up to his Father before he laid his head on the pillow
from which it might never rise and he lay down gently and cried as if
his heart would break He was only fourteen years old

It was no light act of courage in those days my dear boys for a little
fellow to say his prayers publicly even at Rugby A few years later
when Arnolds manly piety had begun to leaven the School the tables
turned before he died in the Schoolhouse at least and I believe in
the other house the rule was the other way But poor Tom had come to
school in other times The first few nights after he came he did not
kneel down because of the noise but sat up in bed till the candle was
out and then stole out and said his prayers in fear lest some one
should find him out So did many another poor little fellow Then he
began to think that he might just as well say his prayers in bed and
then that it didnt matter whether he was kneeling or sitting or lying
down And so it had come to pass with Tom as with all who will not
confess their Lord before men and for the last year he had probably not
said his prayers in earnest a dozen times

Poor Tom the first and bitterest feeling which was like to break his
heart was the sense of his own cowardice The vice of all others which
he loathed was brought in and burnt in on his own soul He had lied to
his mother to his conscience to his God How could he bear it And
then the poor little weak boy whom he had pitied and almost scorned for
his weakness had done that which he braggart as he was dared not do
The first dawn of comfort came to him in swearing to himself that he
would stand by that boy through thick and thin and cheer him and help
him and bear his burdens for the good deed done that night Then he
resolved to write home next day and tell his mother all and what a
coward her son had been And then peace came to him as he resolved
lastly to bear his testimony next morning The morning would be harder
than the night to begin with but he felt that he could not afford to
let one chance slip Several times he faltered for the devil showed him
first all his old friends calling him Saint and Squaretoes and
a dozen hard names and whispered to him that his motives would be
misunderstood and he would only be left alone with the new boy whereas
it was his duty to keep all means of influence that he might do good to
the largest number And then came the more subtle temptation Shall I
not be showing myself braver than others by doing this Have I any right
to begin it now Ought I not rather to pray in my own study letting
other boys know that I do so and trying to lead them to it while in
public at least I should go on as I have done However his good angel
was too strong that night and he turned on his side and slept tired of
trying to reason but resolved to follow the impulse which had been so
strong and in which he had found peace

Next morning he was up and washed and dressed all but his jacket and
waistcoat just as the ten minutes bell began to ring and then in
the face of the whole room knelt down to pray Not five words could
he saythe bell mocked him he was listening for every whisper in
the roomwhat were they all thinking of him He was ashamed to go on
kneeling ashamed to rise from his knees At last as it were from his
inmost heart a still small voice seemed to breathe forth the words of
the publican God be merciful to me a sinner He repeated them over
and over clinging to them as for his life and rose from his knees
comforted and humbled and ready to face the whole world It was not
needed two other boys besides Arthur had already followed his example
and he went down to the great School with a glimmering of another lesson
in his heartthe lesson that he who has conquered his own coward spirit
has conquered the whole outward world and that other one which the old
prophet learnt in the cave in Mount Horeb when he hid his face and the
still small voice asked What doest thou here Elijah that however
we may fancy ourselves alone on the side of good the King and Lord
of men is nowhere without His witnesses for in every society however
seemingly corrupt and godless there are those who have not bowed the
knee to Baal

He found too how greatly he had exaggerated the effect to be produced
by his act For a few nights there was a sneer or a laugh when he knelt
down but this passed off soon and one by one all the other boys but
three or four followed the lead I fear that this was in some measure
owing to the fact that Tom could probably have thrashed any boy in the
room except the praepostor at any rate every boy knew that he would
try upon very slight provocation and didnt choose to run the risk of a
hard fight because Tom Brown had taken a fancy to say his prayers Some
of the small boys of Number 4 communicated the new state of things to
their chums and in several other rooms the poor little fellows tried
it onin one instance or so where the praepostor heard of it and
interfered very decidedly with partial success but in the rest after
a short struggle the confessors were bullied or laughed down and the
old state of things went on for some time longer Before either Tom
Brown or Arthur left the Schoolhouse there was no room in which it had
not become the regular custom I trust it is so still and that the old
heathen state of things has gone out for ever



CHAPTER IITHE NEW BOY

 And Heavens rich instincts in him grew
 As effortless as woodland nooks
 Send violets up and paint them blueLOWELL

I do not mean to recount all the little troubles and annoyances which
thronged upon Tom at the beginning of this halfyear in his new
character of bearleader to a gentle little boy straight from home He
seemed to himself to have become a new boy again without any of the
longsuffering and meekness indispensable for supporting that character
with moderate success From morning till night he had the feeling of
responsibility on his mind and even if he left Arthur in their study
or in the close for an hour was never at ease till he had him in sight
again He waited for him at the doors of the school after every lesson
and every callingover watched that no tricks were played him and none
but the regulation questions asked kept his eye on his plate at dinner
and breakfast to see that no unfair depredations were made upon his
viands in short as East remarked cackled after him like a hen with
one chick

Arthur took a long time thawing too which made it all the harder work
was sadly timid scarcely ever spoke unless Tom spoke to him first and
worst of all would agree with him in everythingthe hardest thing in
the world for a Brown to bear He got quite angry sometimes as they
sat together of a night in their study at this provoking habit of
agreement and was on the point of breaking out a dozen times with a
lecture upon the propriety of a fellow having a will of his own and
speaking out but managed to restrain himself by the thought that he
might only frighten Arthur and the remembrance of the lesson he had
learnt from him on his first night at Number 4 Then he would resolve to
sit still and not say a word till Arthur began but he was always beat
at that game and had presently to begin talking in despair fearing
lest Arthur might think he was vexed at something if he didnt and
dogtired of sitting tonguetied

It was hard work But Tom had taken it up and meant to stick to it and
go through with it so as to satisfy himself in which resolution he
was much assisted by the chafing of East and his other old friends who
began to call him drynurse and otherwise to break their small wit
on him But when they took other ground as they did every now and then
Tom was sorely puzzled

Tell you what Tommy East would say youll spoil young Hopeful with
too much coddling Why cant you let him go about by himself and find
his own level Hell never be worth a button if you go on keeping him
under your skirts

Well but he aint fit to fight his own way yet Im trying to get him
to it every day but hes very odd Poor little beggar I cant make him
out a bit He aint a bit like anything Ive ever seen or heard ofhe
seems all over nerves anything you say seems to hurt him like a cut or
a blow

That sort of boys no use here said East hell only spoil Now Ill
tell you what to do Tommy Go and get a nice large bandbox made and
put him in with plenty of cottonwool and a papbottle labelled With
carethis side up and send him back to mamma

I think I shall make a hand of him though said Tom smiling say
what you will Theres something about him every now and then which
shows me hes got pluck somewhere in him Thats the only thing after
all thatll wash aint it old Scud But how to get at it and bring it
out

Tom took one hand out of his breechespocket and stuck it in his back
hair for a scratch giving his hat a tilt over his nose his one method
of invoking wisdom He stared at the ground with a ludicrously puzzled
look and presently looked up and met Easts eyes That young gentleman
slapped him on the back and then put his arm round his shoulder as
they strolled through the quadrangle together Tom said he blest if
you aint the best old fellow ever was I do like to see you go into a
thing Hang it I wish I could take things as you do but I never
can get higher than a joke Everythings a joke If I was going to be
flogged next minute I should be in a blue funk but I couldnt help
laughing at it for the life of me

Brown and East you go and fag for Jones on the great fives court

Hullo though thats past a joke broke out East springing at
the young gentleman who addressed them and catching him by the
collarHere Tommy catch hold of him tother side before he can
holla

The youth was seized and dragged struggling out of the quadrangle
into the Schoolhouse hall He was one of the miserable little pretty
whitehanded curlyheaded boys petted and pampered by some of the big
fellows who wrote their verses for them taught them to drink and use
bad language and did all they could to spoil them for everything 
in this world and the next One of the avocations in which these young
gentlemen took particular delight was in going about and getting fags
for their protectors when those heroes were playing any game They
carried about pencil and paper with them putting down the names of all
the boys they sent always sending five times as many as were wanted
and getting all those thrashed who didnt go The present youth belonged
to a house which was very jealous of the Schoolhouse and always picked
out Schoolhouse fags when he could find them However this time hed
got the wrong sow by the ear His captors slammed the great door of the
hall and East put his back against it while Tom gave the prisoner a
shake up took away his list and stood him up on the floor while he
proceeded leisurely to examine that document

  A kind and wise critic an old Rugboean notes here in the
 margin The small friend system was not so utterly bad from
 18411847 Before that too there were many noble
 friendships between big and little boys but I cant strike
 out the passage Many boys will know why it is left in

Let me out let me go screamed the boy in a furious passion Ill
go and tell Jones this minute and hell give you both the  thrashing
you ever had

Pretty little dear said East patting the top of his hatHark how
he swears Tom Nicely brought up young man aint he I dont think

Let me alone  you roared the boy foaming with rage and kicking
at East who quietly tripped him up and deposited him on the floor in a
place of safety

Gently young fellow said he taint improving for little
whippersnappers like you to be indulging in blasphemy so you stop that
or youll get something you wont like

Ill have you both licked when I get out that I will rejoined the
boy beginning to snivel

Two can play at that game mind you said Tom who had finished his
examination of the list Now you just listen here Weve just come
across the fives court and Jones has four fags there alreadytwo
more than he wants If hed wanted us to change hed have stopped us
himself And here you little blackguard youve got seven names down on
your list besides ours and five of them Schoolhouse Tom walked up to
him and jerked him on to his legs he was by this time whining like a
whipped puppy Now just listen to me We aint going to fag for
Jones If you tell him youve sent us well each of us give you such
a thrashing as youll remember And Tom tore up the list and threw the
pieces into the fire

And mind you too said East dont let me catch you again sneaking
about the Schoolhouse and picking up our fags You havent got the
sort of hide to take a sound licking kindly And he opened the door and
sent the young gentleman flying into the quadrangle with a parting kick

Nice boy Tommy said East shoving his hands in his pockets and
strolling to the fire

Worst sort we breed responded Tom following his example Thank
goodness no big fellow ever took to petting me

Youd never have been like that said East I should like to have put
him in a museum Christian young gentleman nineteenth century highly
educated Stir him up with a long pole Jack and hear him swear like a
drunken sailor Hed make a respectable public open its eyes I think

Think hell tell Jones said Tom

No said East Dont care if he does

Nor I said Tom And they went back to talk about Arthur

The young gentleman had brains enough not to tell Jones reasoning
that East and Brown who were noted as some of the toughest fags in
the School wouldnt care three straws for any licking Jones might give
them and would be likely to keep their words as to passing it on with
interest

After the above conversation East came a good deal to their study and
took notice of Arthur and soon allowed to Tom that he was a thorough
little gentleman and would get over his shyness all in good time which
much comforted our hero He felt every day too the value of having an
object in his lifesomething that drew him out of himself and it being
the dull time of the year and no games going about for which he much
cared was happier than he had ever yet been at school which was saying
a great deal

The time which Tom allowed himself away from his charge was from
lockingup till suppertime During this hour or hour and a half he used
to take his fling going round to the studies of all his acquaintance
sparring or gossiping in the hall now jumping the old ironbound
tables or carving a bit of his name on them then joining in some
chorus of merry voicesin fact blowing off his steam as we should now
call it

This process was so congenial to his temper and Arthur showed himself
so pleased at the arrangement that it was several weeks before Tom was
ever in their study before supper One evening however he rushed in to
look for an old chisel or some corks or other article essential to his
pursuit for the time being and while rummaging about in the cupboards
looked up for a moment and was caught at once by the figure of poor
little Arthur The boy was sitting with his elbows on the table and
his head leaning on his hands and before him an open book on which his
tears were falling fast Tom shut the door at once and sat down on the
sofa by Arthur putting his arm round his neck

Why young un whats the matter said he kindly you aint unhappy
are you

Oh no Brown said the little boy looking up with the great tears in
his eyes you are so kind to me Im very happy

Why dont you call me Tom Lots of boys do that I dont like half so
much as you What are you reading then Hang it you must come about
with me and not mope yourself And Tom cast down his eyes on the book
and saw it was the Bible He was silent for a minute and thought to
himself Lesson Number 2 Tom Brown and then said gently Im very
glad to see this Arthur and ashamed that I dont read the Bible more
myself Do you read it every night before supper while Im out

Yes

Well I wish youd wait till afterwards and then wed read together
But Arthur why does it make you cry

Oh it isnt that Im unhappy But at home while my father was alive
we always read the lessons after tea and I love to read them over now
and try to remember what he said about them I cant remember all and I
think I scarcely understand a great deal of what I do remember But
it all comes back to me so fresh that I cant help crying sometimes to
think I shall never read them again with him

Arthur had never spoken of his home before and Tom hadnt encouraged
him to do so as his blundering schoolboy reasoning made him think that
Arthur would be softened and less manly for thinking of home But now
he was fairly interested and forgot all about chisels and bottled
beer while with very little encouragement Arthur launched into his home
history and the prayerbell put them both out sadly when it rang to
call them to the hall

From this time Arthur constantly spoke of his home and above all of
his father who had been dead about a year and whose memory Tom soon
got to love and reverence almost as much as his own son did

Arthurs father had been the clergyman of a parish in the Midland
counties which had risen into a large town during the war and upon
which the hard years which followed had fallen with fearful weight The
trade had been half ruined and then came the old sad story of masters
reducing their establishments men turned off and wandering about
hungry and wan in body and fierce in soul from the thought of wives
and children starving at home and the last sticks of furniture going to
the pawnshop children taken from school and lounging about the dirty
streets and courts too listless almost to play and squalid in rags
and misery and then the fearful struggle between the employers and
menlowerings of wages strikes and the long course of oftrepeated
crime ending every now and then with a riot a fire and the county
yeomanry There is no need here to dwell upon such tales the Englishman
into whose soul they have not sunk deep is not worthy the name You
English boys for whom this book is meant God bless your bright faces
and kind hearts will learn it all soon enough

Into such a parish and state of society Arthurs father had been thrown
at the age of twentyfivea young married parson full of faith
hope and love He had battled with it like a man and had lots of fine
Utopian ideas about the perfectibility of mankind glorious humanity
and suchlike knocked out of his head and a real wholesome Christian
love for the poor struggling sinning men of whom he felt himself one
and with and for whom he spent fortune and strength and life driven
into his heart He had battled like a man and gotten a mans rewardno
silver teapots or salvers with flowery inscriptions setting forth
his virtues and the appreciation of a genteel parish no fat living or
stall for which he never looked and didnt care no sighs and praises
of comfortable dowagers and wellgotup young women who worked him
slippers sugared his tea and adored him as a devoted man but a
manly respect wrung from the unwilling souls of men who fancied his
order their natural enemies the fear and hatred of every one who was
false or unjust in the district were he master or man and the blessed
sight of women and children daily becoming more human and more homely a
comfort to themselves and to their husbands and fathers

These things of course took time and had to be fought for with toil
and sweat of brain and heart and with the lifeblood poured out All
that Arthur had laid his account to give and took as a matter of
course neither pitying himself nor looking on himself as a martyr
when he felt the wear and tear making him feel old before his time and
the stifling air of feverdens telling on his health His wife seconded
him in everything She had been rather fond of society and much admired
and run after before her marriage and the London world to which she had
belonged pitied poor Fanny Evelyn when she married the young clergyman
and went to settle in that smoky hole Turley a very nest of Chartism
and Atheism in a part of the country which all the decent families had
had to leave for years However somehow or other she didnt seem to
care If her husbands living had been amongst green fields and near
pleasant neighbours she would have liked it betterthat she never
pretended to deny But there they were The air wasnt bad after all
the people were very good sort of peoplecivil to you if you were civil
to them after the first brush and they didnt expect to work miracles
and convert them all offhand into model Christians So he and she went
quietly among the folk talking to and treating them just as they would
have done people of their own rank They didnt feel that they were
doing anything out of the common way and so were perfectly natural
and had none of that condescension or consciousness of manner which so
outrages the independent poor And thus they gradually won respect and
confidence and after sixteen years he was looked up to by the whole
neighbourhood as the just man the man to whom masters and men could
go in their strikes and in all their quarrels and difficulties and by
whom the right and true word would be said without fear or favour And
the women had come round to take her advice and go to her as a friend
in all their troubles while the children all worshipped the very ground
she trod on

They had three children two daughters and a son little Arthur who
came between his sisters He had been a very delicate boy from his
childhood they thought he had a tendency to consumption and so he had
been kept at home and taught by his father who had made a companion of
him and from whom he had gained good scholarship and a knowledge of
and interest in many subjects which boys in general never come across
till they are many years older

Just as he reached his thirteenth year and his father had settled that
he was strong enough to go to school and after much debating with
himself had resolved to send him there a desperate typhus fever broke
out in the town Most of the other clergy and almost all the doctors
ran away the work fell with tenfold weight on those who stood to their
work Arthur and his wife both caught the fever of which he died in a
few days and she recovered having been able to nurse him to the end
and store up his last words He was sensible to the last and calm and
happy leaving his wife and children with fearless trust for a few years
in the hands of the Lord and Friend who had lived and died for him and
for whom he to the best of his power had lived and died His widows
mourning was deep and gentle She was more affected by the request of
the committee of a freethinking club established in the town by some of
the factory hands which he had striven against with might and main and
nearly suppressed that some of their number might be allowed to help
bear the coffin than by anything else Two of them were chosen who
with six other labouring men his own fellowworkmen and friends bore
him to his gravea man who had fought the Lords fight even unto the
death The shops were closed and the factories shut that day in the
parish yet no master stopped the days wages but for many a year
afterwards the townsfolk felt the want of that brave hopeful loving
parson and his wife who had lived to teach them mutual forbearance and
helpfulness and had almost at last given them a glimpse of what this
old world would be if people would live for God and each other instead
of for themselves

What has all this to do with our story Well my dear boys let a fellow
go on his own way or you wont get anything out of him worth having
I must show you what sort of a man it was who had begotten and trained
little Arthur or else you wont believe in him which I am resolved you
shall do and you wont see how he the timid weak boy had points in
him from which the bravest and strongest recoiled and made his presence
and example felt from the first on all sides unconsciously to himself
and without the least attempt at proselytizing The spirit of his father
was in him and the Friend to whom his father had left him did not
neglect the trust

After supper that night and almost nightly for years afterwards
Tom and Arthur and by degrees East occasionally and sometimes one
sometimes another of their friends read a chapter of the Bible
together and talked it over afterwards Tom was at first utterly
astonished and almost shocked at the sort of way in which Arthur read
the book and talked about the men and women whose lives were there told
The first night they happened to fall on the chapters about the famine
in Egypt and Arthur began talking about Joseph as if he were a living
statesmanjust as he might have talked about Lord Grey and the Reform
Bill only that they were much more living realities to him The book
was to him Tom saw the most vivid and delightful history of real
people who might do right or wrong just like any one who was walking
about in Rugbythe Doctor or the masters or the sixthform boys But
the astonishment soon passed off the scales seemed to drop from his
eyes and the book became at once and for ever to him the great human
and divine book and the men and women whom he had looked upon
as something quite different from himself became his friends and
counsellors

For our purposes however the history of one nights reading will be
sufficient which must be told here now we are on the subject though
it didnt happen till a year afterwards and long after the events
recorded in the next chapter of our story

Arthur Tom and East were together one night and read the story of
Naaman coming to Elisha to be cured of his leprosy When the chapter was
finished Tom shut his Bible with a slap

I cant stand that fellow Naaman said he after what hed seen and
felt going back and bowing himself down in the house of Rimmon because
his effeminate scoundrel of a master did it I wonder Elisha took the
trouble to heal him How he must have despised him

Yes there you go off as usual with a shell on your head struck
in East who always took the opposite side to Tom half from love of
argument half from conviction How do you know he didnt think better
of it How do you know his master was a scoundrel His letter dont look
like it and the book dont say so

I dont care rejoined Tom why did Naaman talk about bowing down
then if he didnt mean to do it He wasnt likely to get more in
earnest when he got back to court and away from the prophet

Well but Tom said Arthur look what Elisha says to himGo in
peace He wouldnt have said that if Naaman had been in the wrong

I dont see that that means more than saying Youre not the man I
took you for

No no that wont do at all said East Read the words fairly and
take men as you find them I like Naaman and think he was a very fine
fellow

I dont said Tom positively

Well I think East is right said Arthur I cant see but what its
right to do the best you can though it maynt be the best absolutely
Every man isnt born to be a martyr

Of course of course said East but hes on one of his pet
hobbiesHow often have I told you Tom that you must drive a nail
where itll go

And how often have I told you rejoined Tom that itll always go
where you want if you only stick to it and hit hard enough I hate
halfmeasures and compromises

Yes hes a wholehog man is Tom Must have the whole animalhair and
teeth claws and tail laughed East Sooner have no bread any day than
half the loaf

I dont know said Arthurits rather puzzling but aint most right
things got by proper compromisesI mean where the principle isnt given
up

Thats just the point said Tom I dont object to a compromise
where you dont give up your principle

Not you said East laughinglyI know him of old Arthur and youll
find him out some day There isnt such a reasonable fellow in the
world to hear him talk He never wants anything but whats right
and fair only when you come to settle whats right and fair its
everything that he wants and nothing that you want And thats his idea
of a compromise Give me the Brown compromise when Im on his side

Now Harry said Tom no more chaff Im serious Look here This is
what makes my blood tingle And he turned over the pages of his Bible
and read Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the
king O Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this
matter If it be so our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from
the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O
king But if not be it known unto thee O king that we will not serve
thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up He read
the last verse twice emphasizing the nots and dwelling on them as if
they gave him actual pleasure and were hard to part with

They were silent a minute and then Arthur said Yes thats a glorious
story but it dont prove your point Tom I think There are times when
there is only one way and that the highest and then the men are found
to stand in the breach

Theres always a highest way and its always the right one said Tom
How many times has the Doctor told us that in his sermons in the last
year I should like to know

Well you aint going to convince usis he Arthur No Brown
compromise tonight said East looking at his watch But its past
eight and we must go to first lesson What a bore

So they took down their books and fell to work but Arthur didnt
forget and thought long and often over the conversation



CHAPTER IIIARTHUR MAKES A FRIEND

 Let Nature be your teacher
 Sweet is the lore which Nature brings
 Our meddling intellect
 Misshapes the beauteous forms of things
 We murder to dissect
 Enough of Science and of Art
 Close up those barren leaves
 Come forth and bring with you a heart
 That watches and receivesWORDSWORTH

About six weeks after the beginning of the half as Tom and Arthur were
sitting one night before supper beginning their verses Arthur suddenly
stopped and looked up and said Tom do you know anything of Martin

Yes said Tom taking his hand out of his back hair and delighted to
throw his Gradus ad Parnassum on to the sofa I know him pretty well
Hes a very good fellow but as mad as a hatter Hes called Madman you
know And never was such a fellow for getting all sorts of rum things
about him He tamed two snakes last half and used to carry them about
in his pocket and Ill be bound hes got some hedgehogs and rats in his
cupboard now and no one knows what besides

I should like very much to know him said Arthur he was next to me
in the form today and hed lost his book and looked over mine and he
seemed so kind and gentle that I liked him very much

Ah poor old Madman hes always losing his books said Tom and
getting called up and floored because he hasnt got them

I like him all the better said Arthur

Well hes great fun I can tell you said Tom throwing himself back
on the sofa and chuckling at the remembrance We had such a game with
him one day last half He had been kicking up horrid stinks for some
time in his study till I suppose some fellow told Mary and she told
the Doctor Anyhow one day a little before dinner when he came down
from the library the Doctor instead of going home came striding into
the hall East and I and five or six other fellows were at the fire and
preciously we stared for he dont come in like that once a year unless
it is a wet day and theres a fight in the hall East says he just
come and show me Martins study Oh heres a game whispered the
rest of us and we all cut upstairs after the Doctor East leading As
we got into the New Row which was hardly wide enough to hold the Doctor
and his gown click click click we heard in the old Madmans den
Then that stopped all of a sudden and the bolts went to like fun The
Madman knew Easts step and thought there was going to be a siege

Its the Doctor Martin Hes here and wants to see you sings out
East

Then the bolts went back slowly and the door opened and there was
the old Madman standing looking precious scaredhis jacket off his
shirtsleeves up to his elbows and his long skinny arms all covered
with anchors and arrows and letters tattooed in with gunpowder like a
sailorboys and a stink fit to knock you down coming out Twas
all the Doctor could do to stand his ground and East and I who were
looking in under his arms held our noses tight The old magpie was
standing on the windowsill all his feathers drooping and looking
disgusted and halfpoisoned

What can you be about Martin says the Doctor You really mustnt
go on in this way youre a nuisance to the whole passage

Please sir I was only mixing up this powder there isnt any harm
in it And the Madman seized nervously on his pestle and mortar to
show the Doctor the harmlessness of his pursuits and went on
poundingclick click click He hadnt given six clicks before puff
up went the whole into a great blaze away went the pestle and mortar
across the study and back we tumbled into the passage The magpie
fluttered down into the court swearing and the Madman danced out
howling with his fingers in his mouth The Doctor caught hold of him
and called to us to fetch some water There you silly fellow said
he quite pleased though to find he wasnt much hurt you see you
dont know the least what youre doing with all these things and now
mind you must give up practising chemistry by yourself Then he took
hold of his arm and looked at it and I saw he had to bite his lip and
his eyes twinkled but he said quite grave Here you see youve been
making all these foolish marks on yourself which you can never get out
and youll be very sorry for it in a year or two Now come down to the
housekeepers room and let us see if you are hurt And away went
the two and we all stayed and had a regular turnout of the den till
Martin came back with his hand bandaged and turned us out However Ill
go and see what hes after and tell him to come in after prayers to
supper And away went Tom to find the boy in question who dwelt in a
little study by himself in New Row

The aforesaid Martin whom Arthur had taken such a fancy for was one of
those unfortunates who were at that time of day and are I fear still
quite out of their places at a public school If we knew how to use
our boys Martin would have been seized upon and educated as a natural
philosopher He had a passion for birds beasts and insects and knew
more of them and their habits than any one in Rugbyexcept perhaps the
Doctor who knew everything He was also an experimental chemist on a
small scale and had made unto himself an electric machine from which
it was his greatest pleasure and glory to administer small shocks to any
small boys who were rash enough to venture into his study And this
was by no means an adventure free from excitement for besides the
probability of a snake dropping on to your head or twining lovingly up
your leg or a rat getting into your breechespocket in search of food
there was the animal and chemical odour to be faced which always hung
about the den and the chance of being blown up in some of the many
experiments which Martin was always trying with the most wondrous
results in the shape of explosions and smells that mortal boy ever heard
of Of course poor Martin in consequence of his pursuits had become
an Ishmaelite in the house In the first place he halfpoisoned all his
neighbours and they in turn were always on the lookout to pounce upon
any of his numerous livestock and drive him frantic by enticing his
pet old magpie out of his window into a neighbouring study and making
the disreputable old bird drunk on toast soaked in beer and sugar Then
Martin for his sins inhabited a study looking into a small court some
ten feet across the window of which was completely commanded by those
of the studies opposite in the Sickroom Row these latter being at
a slightly higher elevation East and another boy of an equally
tormenting and ingenious turn of mind now lived exactly opposite and
had expended huge pains and time in the preparation of instruments of
annoyance for the behoof of Martin and his live colony One morning
an old basket made its appearance suspended by a short cord outside
Martins window in which were deposited an amateur nest containing four
young hungry jackdaws the pride and glory of Martins life for the
time being and which he was currently asserted to have hatched upon
his own person Early in the morning and late at night he was to be
seen half out of window administering to the varied wants of his callow
brood After deep cogitation East and his chum had spliced a knife on
to the end of a fishingrod and having watched Martin out had after
half an hours severe sawing cut the string by which the basket
was suspended and tumbled it on to the pavement below with hideous
remonstrance from the occupants Poor Martin returning from his short
absence collected the fragments and replaced his brood except one
whose neck had been broken in the descent in their old location
suspending them this time by string and wire twisted together defiant
of any sharp instrument which his persecutors could command But like
the Russian engineers at Sebastopol East and his chum had an answer for
every move of the adversary and the next day had mounted a gun in the
shape of a peashooter upon the ledge of their window trained so as to
bear exactly upon the spot which Martin had to occupy while tending his
nurslings The moment he began to feed they began to shoot In vain did
the enemy himself invest in a peashooter and endeavour to answer the
fire while he fed the young birds with his other hand his attention was
divided and his shots flew wild while every one of theirs told on his
face and hands and drove him into howlings and imprecations He
had been driven to ensconce the nest in a corner of his already
toowellfilled den

His door was barricaded by a set of ingenious bolts of his own
invention for the sieges were frequent by the neighbours when any
unusually ambrosial odour spread itself from the den to the neighbouring
studies The door panels were in a normal state of smash but the frame
of the door resisted all besiegers and behind it the owner carried on
his varied pursuitsmuch in the same state of mind I should fancy
as a borderfarmer lived in in the days of the mosstroopers when his
hold might be summoned or his cattle carried off at any minute of night
or day

Open Martin old boy its only I Tom Brown

Oh very well stop a moment One bolt went back Youre sure East
isnt there

No no hang it open Tom gave a kick the other bolt creaked and he
entered the den

Den indeed it wasabout five feet six inches long by five wide and
seven feet high About six tattered schoolbooks and a few chemical
books Taxidermy Stanley on Birds and an odd volume of Bewick the
latter in much better preservation occupied the top shelves The other
shelves where they had not been cut away and used by the owner for
other purposes were fitted up for the abidingplaces of birds beasts
and reptiles There was no attempt at carpet or curtain The table was
entirely occupied by the great work of Martin the electric machine
which was covered carefully with the remains of his tablecloth The
jackdaw cage occupied one wall and the other was adorned by a small
hatchet a pair of climbing irons and his tin candlebox in which he
was for the time being endeavouring to raise a hopeful young family of
fieldmice As nothing should be let to lie useless it was well that
the candlebox was thus occupied for candles Martin never had A pound
was issued to him weekly as to the other boys but as candles were
available capital and easily exchangeable for birds eggs or young
birds Martins pound invariably found its way in a few hours to
Howletts the birdfanciers in the Bilton road who would give a
hawks or nightingales egg or young linnet in exchange Martins
ingenuity was therefore for ever on the rack to supply himself with
a light Just now he had hit upon a grand invention and the den was
lighted by a flaring cotton wick issuing from a gingerbeer bottle full
of some doleful composition When light altogether failed him Martin
would loaf about by the fires in the passages or hall after the manner
of Diggs and try to do his verses or learn his lines by the firelight

Well old boy you havent got any sweeter in the den this half How
that stuff in the bottle stinks Never mind I aint going to stop but
you come up after prayers to our study You know young Arthur Weve got
Grays study Well have a good supper and talk about birdnesting

Martin was evidently highly pleased at the invitation and promised to
be up without fail

As soon as prayers were over and the sixth and fifth form boys had
withdrawn to the aristocratic seclusion of their own room and the rest
or democracy had sat down to their supper in the hall Tom and Arthur
having secured their allowances of bread and cheese started on their
feet to catch the eye of the praepostor of the week who remained in
charge during supper walking up and down the hall He happened to be an
easygoing fellow so they got a pleasant nod to their Please may I go
out and away they scrambled to prepare for Martin a sumptuous banquet
This Tom had insisted on for he was in great delight on the occasion
the reason of which delight must be expounded The fact was that this
was the first attempt at a friendship of his own which Arthur had made
and Tom hailed it as a grand step The ease with which he himself became
hailfellowwellmet with anybody and blundered into and out of twenty
friendships a halfyear made him sometimes sorry and sometimes angry at
Arthurs reserve and loneliness True Arthur was always pleasant and
even jolly with any boys who came with Tom to their study but Tom felt
that it was only through him as it were that his chum associated
with others and that but for him Arthur would have been dwelling in
a wilderness This increased his consciousness of responsibility
and though he hadnt reasoned it out and made it clear to himself yet
somehow he knew that this responsibility this trust which he had taken
on him without thinking about it head over heels in fact was the
centre and turningpoint of his schoollife that which was to make him
or mar him his appointed work and trial for the time being And Tom
was becoming a new boy though with frequent tumbles in the dirt and
perpetual hard battle with himself and was daily growing in manfulness
and thoughtfulness as every highcouraged and wellprincipled boy must
when he finds himself for the first time consciously at grips with self
and the devil Already he could turn almost without a sigh from the
Schoolgates from which had just scampered off East and three or four
others of his own particular set bound for some jolly lark not quite
according to law and involving probably a row with louts keepers
or farmlabourers the skipping dinner or callingover some of Phoebe
Jenningss beer and a very possible flogging at the end of all as a
relish He had quite got over the stage in which he would grumble to
himselfWell hang it its very hard of the Doctor to have saddled me
with Arthur Why couldnt he have chummed him with Fogey or Thomkin or
any of the fellows who never do anything but walk round the close and
finish their copies the first day theyre set But although all this
was past he longed and felt that he was right in longing for more
time for the legitimate pastimes of cricket fives bathing and
fishing within bounds in which Arthur could not yet be his companion
and he felt that when the young un as he now generally called him
had found a pursuit and some other friend for himself he should be
able to give more time to the education of his own body with a clear
conscience

And now what he so wished for had come to pass he almost hailed it as
a special providence as indeed it was but not for the reasons he
gave for itwhat providences are that Arthur should have singled out
Martin of all fellows for a friend The old Madman is the very fellow
thought he he will take him scrambling over half the country after
birds eggs and flowers make him run and swim and climb like an Indian
and not teach him a word of anything bad or keep him from his lessons
What luck And so with more than his usual heartiness he dived into
his cupboard and hauled out an old knucklebone of ham and two or
three bottles of beer together with the solemn pewter only used on
state occasions while Arthur equally elated at the easy accomplishment
of his first act of volition in the joint establishment produced from
his side a bottle of pickles and a pot of jam and cleared the table In
a minute or two the noise of the boys coming up from supper was heard
and Martin knocked and was admitted bearing his bread and cheese and
the three fell to with hearty goodwill upon the viands talking faster
than they ate for all shyness disappeared in a moment before Toms
bottledbeer and hospitable ways Heres Arthur a regular young
townmouse with a natural taste for the woods Martin longing to break
his neck climbing trees and with a passion for young snakes

Well I say sputtered out Martin eagerly will you come tomorrow
both of you to Caldecotts Spinney then for I know of a kestrels
nest up a firtree I cant get at it without help and Brown you can
climb against any one

Oh yes do let us go said Arthur I never saw a hawks nest nor a
hawks egg

You just come down to my study then and Ill show you five sorts
said Martin

Ay the old Madman has got the best collection in the house out and
out said Tom and then Martin warming with unaccustomed good cheer
and the chance of a convert launched out into a proposed birdnesting
campaign betraying all manner of important secretsa goldencrested
wrens nest near Butlins Mound a moorhen who was sitting on nine eggs
in a pond down the Barby road and a kingfishers nest in a corner of
the old canal above Brownsover Mill He had heard he said that no
one had ever got a kingfishers nest out perfect and that the British
Museum or the Government or somebody had offered 100 pounds to any
one who could bring them a nest and eggs not damaged In the middle of
which astounding announcement to which the others were listening with
open ears and already considering the application of the 100 pounds a
knock came to the door and Easts voice was heard craving admittance

Theres Harry said Tom well let him in Ill keep him steady
Martin I thought the old boy would smell out the supper

The fact was that Toms heart had already smitten him for not asking
his fidus Achates to the feast although only an extempore affair and
though prudence and the desire to get Martin and Arthur together alone
at first had overcome his scruples he was now heartily glad to open the
door broach another bottle of beer and hand over the old hamknuckle
to the searching of his old friends pocketknife

Ah you greedy vagabonds said East with his mouth full I knew
there was something going on when I saw you cut off out of hall so
quick with your suppers What a stunning tap Tom You are a wunner for
bottling the swipes

Ive had practice enough for the sixth in my time and its hard if I
havent picked up a wrinkle or two for my own benefit

Well old Madman and how goes the birdnesting campaign Hows
Howlett I expect the young rooksll be out in another fortnight and
then my turn comes

Therell be no young rooks fit for pies for a month yet shows how much
you know about it rejoined Martin who though very good friends with
East regarded him with considerable suspicion for his propensity to
practical jokes

Scud knows nothing and cares for nothing but grub and mischief said
Tom but young rook pie specially when youve had to climb for them
is very pretty eatingHowever I say Scud were all going after a
hawks nest tomorrow in Caldecotts Spinney and if youll come and
behave yourself well have a stunning climb

And a bathe in Aganippe Hooray Im your man

No no no bathing in Aganippe thats where our betters go

Well well never mind Im for the hawks nest and anything that
turns up

And the bottledbeer being finished and his hunger appeased East
departed to his study that sneak Jones as he informed them who had
just got into the sixth and occupied the next study having instituted
a nightly visitation upon East and his chum to their no small
discomfort

When he was gone Martin rose to follow but Tom stopped him No one
goes near New Row said he so you may just as well stop here and do
your verses and then well have some more talk Well be no end quiet
Besides no praepostor comes here now We havent been visited once this
half

So the table was cleared the cloth restored and the three fell to work
with Gradus and dictionary upon the mornings vulgus

They were three very fair examples of the way in which such tasks were
done at Rugby in the consulship of Plancus And doubtless the method
is little changed for there is nothing new under the sun especially at
schools

Now be it known unto all you boys who are at schools which do not
rejoice in the timehonoured institution of the vulgus commonly
supposed to have been established by William of Wykeham at Winchester
and imported to Rugby by Arnold more for the sake of the lines which
were learnt by heart with it than for its own intrinsic value as Ive
always understood that it is a short exercise in Greek or Latin verse
on a given subject the minimum number of lines being fixed for each
form

The master of the form gave out at fourth lesson on the previous day the
subject for next mornings vulgus and at first lesson each boy had to
bring his vulgus ready to be looked over and with the vulgus a
certain number of lines from one of the Latin or Greek poets then being
construed in the form had to be got by heart The master at first lesson
called up each boy in the form in order and put him on in the lines
If he couldnt say them or seem to say them by reading them off the
masters or some other boys book who stood near he was sent back
and went below all the boys who did so say or seem to say them but
in either case his vulgus was looked over by the master who gave and
entered in his book to the credit or discredit of the boy so many
marks as the composition merited At Rugby vulgus and lines were the
first lesson every other day in the week on Tuesdays Thursdays and
Saturdays and as there were thirtyeight weeks in the school year it
is obvious to the meanest capacity that the master of each form had
to set one hundred and fourteen subjects every year two hundred and
twentyeight every two years and so on Now to persons of moderate
invention this was a considerable task and human nature being prone to
repeat itself it will not be wondered that the masters gave the same
subjects sometimes over again after a certain lapse of time To meet
and rebuke this bad habit of the masters the schoolboy mind with its
accustomed ingenuity had invented an elaborate system of tradition
Almost every boy kept his own vulgus written out in a book and these
books were duly handed down from boy to boy till if the tradition has
gone on till now I suppose the popular boys in whose hands bequeathed
vulgusbooks have accumulated are prepared with three or four vulguses
on any subject in heaven or earth or in more worlds than one which
an unfortunate master can pitch upon At any rate such lucky fellows
had generally one for themselves and one for a friend in my time The
only objection to the traditionary method of doing your vulguses was the
risk that the successions might have become confused and so that you
and another follower of traditions should show up the same identical
vulgus some fine morning in which case when it happened considerable
grief was the result But when did such risk hinder boys or men from
short cuts and pleasant paths

Now in the study that night Tom was the upholder of the traditionary
method of vulgus doing He carefully produced two large vulgusbooks
and began diving into them and picking out a line here and an ending
there tags as they were vulgarly called till he had gotten all
that he thought he could make fit He then proceeded to patch his tags
together with the help of his Gradus producing an incongruous and
feeble result of eight elegiac lines the minimum quantity for his form
and finishing up with two highly moral lines extra making ten in
all which he cribbed entire from one of his books beginning O genus
humanum and which he himself must have used a dozen times before
whenever an unfortunate or wicked hero of whatever nation or language
under the sun was the subject Indeed he began to have great doubts
whether the master wouldnt remember them and so only throw them in as
extra lines because in any case they would call off attention from the
other tags and if detected being extra lines he wouldnt be sent back
to do more in their place while if they passed muster again he would
get marks for them

The second method pursued by Martin may be called the dogged or
prosaic method He no more than Tom took any pleasure in the task
but having no old vulgusbooks of his own or any ones else could
not follow the traditionary method for which too as Tom remarked he
hadnt the genius Martin then proceeded to write down eight lines in
English of the most matteroffact kind the first that came into his
head and to convert these line by line by main force of Gradus and
dictionary into Latin that would scan This was all he cared forto
produce eight lines with no false quantities or concords whether the
words were apt or what the sense was mattered nothing and as the
article was all new not a line beyond the minimum did the followers of
the dogged method ever produce

The third or artistic method was Arthurs He considered first what
point in the character or event which was the subject could most neatly
be brought out within the limits of a vulgus trying always to get his
idea into the eight lines but not binding himself to ten or even twelve
lines if he couldnt do this He then set to work as much as possible
without Gradus or other help to clothe his idea in appropriate Latin or
Greek and would not be satisfied till he had polished it well up with
the aptest and most poetic words and phrases he could get at

A fourth method indeed was used in the school but of too simple
a kind to require a comment It may be called the vicarious method
obtained amongst big boys of lazy or bullying habits and consisted
simply in making clever boys whom they could thrash do their whole
vulgus for them and construe it to them afterwards which latter is a
method not to be encouraged and which I strongly advise you all not
to practise Of the others you will find the traditionary most
troublesome unless you can steal your vulguses whole experto crede
and that the artistic method pays the best both in marks and other ways

The vulguses being finished by nine oclock and Martin having rejoiced
above measure in the abundance of light and of Gradus and dictionary
and other conveniences almost unknown to him for getting through the
work and having been pressed by Arthur to come and do his verses there
whenever he liked the three boys went down to Martins den and Arthur
was initiated into the lore of birds eggs to his great delight
The exquisite colouring and forms astonished and charmed him who had
scarcely ever seen any but a hens egg or an ostrichs and by the time
he was lugged away to bed he had learned the names of at least twenty
sorts and dreamed of the glorious perils of treeclimbing and that he
had found a rocs egg in the island as big as Sinbads and clouded like
a titlarks in blowing which Martin and he had nearly been drowned in
the yolk



CHAPTER IVTHE BIRDFANCIERS

 I have found out a gift for my fair
 I have found where the woodpigeons breed
 But let me the plunder forbear
 She would say twas a barbarous deedROWE

 And now my lad take them five shilling
 And on my advice in future think
 So Billy pouched them all so willing
 And got that night disguised in drinkMS Ballad

The next morning at first lesson Tom was turned back in his lines
and so had to wait till the second round while Martin and Arthur said
theirs all right and got out of school at once When Tom got out and
ran down to breakfast at Harrowells they were missing and Stumps
informed him that they had swallowed down their breakfasts and gone off
togetherwhere he couldnt say Tom hurried over his own breakfast
and went first to Martins study and then to his own but no signs of
the missing boys were to be found He felt half angry and jealous of
Martin Where could they be gone

He learnt second lesson with East and the rest in no very good temper
and then went out into the quadrangle About ten minutes before school
Martin and Arthur arrived in the quadrangle breathless and catching
sight of him Arthur rushed up all excitement and with a bright glow
on his face

O Tom look here cried he holding out three moorhens eggs weve
been down the Barby road to the pool Martin told us of last night and
just see what weve got

Tom wouldnt be pleased and only looked out for something to find fault
with

Why young un said he what have you been after You dont mean to
say youve been wading

The tone of reproach made poor little Arthur shrink up in a moment and
look piteous and Tom with a shrug of his shoulders turned his anger on
Martin

Well I didnt think Madman that youd have been such a muff as to
let him be getting wet through at this time of day You might have done
the wading yourself

So I did of course only he would come in too to see the nest We
left six eggs in Theyll be hatched in a day or two

Hang the eggs said Tom a fellow cant turn his back for a moment
but all his works undone Hell be laid up for a week for this precious
lark Ill be bound

Indeed Tom now pleaded Arthur my feet aint wet for Martin made
me take off my shoes and stockings and trousers

But they are wet and dirty too cant I see answered Tom and
youll be called up and floored when the master sees what a state youre
in You havent looked at second lesson you know

O Tom you old humbug you to be upbraiding any one with not learning
their lessons If you hadnt been floored yourself now at first lesson
do you mean to say you wouldnt have been with them And youve taken
away all poor little Arthurs joy and pride in his first birds eggs
and he goes and puts them down in the study and takes down his books
with a sigh thinking he has done something horribly wrong whereas he
has learnt on in advance much more than will be done at second lesson

But the old Madman hasnt and gets called up and makes some frightful
shots losing about ten places and all but getting floored This
somewhat appeases Toms wrath and by the end of the lesson he has
regained his temper And afterwards in their study he begins to get
right again as he watches Arthurs intense joy at seeing Martin blowing
the eggs and gluing them carefully on to bits of cardboard and notes
the anxious loving looks which the little fellow casts sidelong at him
And then he thinks What an illtempered beast I am Heres just what I
was wishing for last night come about and Im spoiling it all and in
another five minutes has swallowed the last mouthful of his bile and is
repaid by seeing his little sensitive plant expand again and sun itself
in his smiles

After dinner the Madman is busy with the preparations for their
expedition fitting new straps on to his climbingirons filling large
pillboxes with cottonwool and sharpening Easts small axe They carry
all their munitions into callingovers and directly afterwards having
dodged such praepostors as are on the lookout for fags at cricket the
four set off at a smart trot down the Lawford footpath straight for
Caldecotts Spinney and the hawks nest

Martin leads the way in high feather it is quite a new sensation to
him getting companions and he finds it very pleasant and means to
show them all manner of proofs of his science and skill Brown and East
may be better at cricket and football and games thinks he but out in
the fields and woods see if I cant teach them something He has
taken the leadership already and strides away in front with his
climbingirons strapped under one arm his peckingbag under the other
and his pockets and hat full of pillboxes cottonwool and other
etceteras Each of the others carries a peckingbag and East his
hatchet

When they had crossed three or four fields without a check Arthur began
to lag and Tom seeing this shouted to Martin to pull up a bit We
aint out hareandhounds Whats the good of grinding on at this rate

Theres the Spinney said Martin pulling up on the brow of a slope
at the bottom of which lay Lawford brook and pointing to the top of the
opposite slope the nest is in one of those high firtrees at this end
And down by the brook there I know of a sedgebirds nest Well go and
look at it coming back

Oh come on dont let us stop said Arthur who was getting excited
at the sight of the wood So they broke into a trot again and were soon
across the brook up the slope and into the Spinney Here they advanced
as noiselessly as possible lest keepers or other enemies should be
about and stopped at the foot of a tall fir at the top of which Martin
pointed out with pride the kestrels nest the object of their quest

Oh where which is it asks Arthur gaping up in the air and having
the most vague idea of what it would be like

There dont you see said East pointing to a lump of mistletoe in
the next tree which was a beech He saw that Martin and Tom were busy
with the climbingirons and couldnt resist the temptation of hoaxing
Arthur stared and wondered more than ever

Well how curious It doesnt look a bit like what I expected said
he

Very odd birds kestrels said East looking waggishly at his victim
who was still stargazing

But I thought it was in a firtree objected Arthur

Ah dont you know Thats a new sort of fir which old Caldecott
brought from the Himalayas

Really said Arthur Im glad I know that How unlike our firs they
are They do very well too here dont they The Spinneys full of
them

Whats that humbug hes telling you cried Tom looking up having
caught the word Himalayas and suspecting what East was after

Only about this fir said Arthur putting his hand on the stem of the
beech

Fir shouted Tom why you dont mean to say young un you dont
know a beech when you see one

Poor little Arthur looked terribly ashamed and East exploded in
laughter which made the wood ring

Ive hardly ever seen any trees faltered Arthur

What a shame to hoax him Scud cried MartinNever mind Arthur
you shall know more about trees than he does in a week or two

And isnt that the kestrels nest then asked Arthur That Why
thats a piece of mistletoe Theres the nest that lump of sticks up
this fir

Dont believe him Arthur struck in the incorrigible East I just
saw an old magpie go out of it

Martin did not deign to reply to this sally except by a grunt as
he buckled the last buckle of his climbingirons and Arthur looked
reproachfully at East without speaking

But now came the tug of war It was a very difficult tree to climb until
the branches were reached the first of which was some fourteen feet
up for the trunk was too large at the bottom to be swarmed in fact
neither of the boys could reach more than half round it with their arms
Martin and Tom both of whom had irons on tried it without success at
first the fir bark broke away where they stuck the irons in as soon as
they leant any weight on their feet and the grip of their arms wasnt
enough to keep them up so after getting up three or four feet down
they came slithering to the ground barking their arms and faces They
were furious and East sat by laughing and shouting at each failure
Two to one on the old magpie

We must try a pyramid said Tom at last Now Scud you lazy rascal
stick yourself against the tree

I dare say and have you standing on my shoulders with the irons on
What do you think my skins made of However up he got and leant
against the tree putting his head down and clasping it with his arms as
far as he could

Now then Madman said Tom you next

No Im lighter than you you go next So Tom got on Easts shoulders
and grasped the tree above and then Martin scrambled up on to Toms
shoulders amidst the totterings and groanings of the pyramid and with
a spring which sent his supporters howling to the ground clasped the
stem some ten feet up and remained clinging For a moment or two they
thought he couldnt get up but then holding on with arms and teeth he
worked first one iron then the other firmly into the bark got another
grip with his arms and in another minute had hold of the lowest branch

All up with the old magpie now said East and after a minutes
rest up went Martin hand over hand watched by Arthur with fearful
eagerness

Isnt it very dangerous said he

Not a bit answered Tom you cant hurt if you only get good
handhold Try every branch with a good pull before you trust it and
then up you go

Martin was now amongst the small branches close to the nest and
away dashed the old bird and soared up above the trees watching the
intruder

All rightfour eggs shouted he

Take em all shouted East thatll be one apiece

No no leave one and then she wont care said Tom

We boys had an idea that birds couldnt count and were quite content as
long as you left one egg I hope it is so

Martin carefully put one egg into each of his boxes and the third
into his mouth the only other place of safety and came down like a
lamplighter All went well till he was within ten feet of the ground
when as the trunk enlarged his hold got less and less firm and at
last down he came with a run tumbling on to his back on the turf
spluttering and spitting out the remains of the great egg which had
broken by the jar of his fall

Ugh ugh something to drinkugh it was addled spluttered he while
the wood rang again with the merry laughter of East and Tom

Then they examined the prizes gathered up their things and went off to
the brook where Martin swallowed huge draughts of water to get rid
of the taste and they visited the sedgebirds nest and from thence
struck across the country in high glee beating the hedges and brakes as
they went along and Arthur at last to his intense delight was allowed
to climb a small hedgerow oak for a magpies nest with Tom who kept all
round him like a mother and showed him where to hold and how to throw
his weight and though he was in a great fright didnt show it and was
applauded by all for his lissomness

They crossed a road soon afterwards and there close to them lay a
great heap of charming pebbles

Look here shouted East heres luck Ive been longing for some
good honest pecking this halfhour Lets fill the bags and have no
more of this foozling birdnesting

No one objected so each boy filled the fustian bag he carried full of
stones They crossed into the next field Tom and East taking one side
of the hedges and the other two the other side Noise enough they made
certainly but it was too early in the season for the young birds and
the old birds were too strong on the wing for our young marksmen
and flew out of shot after the first discharge But it was great fun
rushing along the hedgerows and discharging stone after stone at
blackbirds and chaffinches though no result in the shape of slaughtered
birds was obtained and Arthur soon entered into it and rushed to head
back the birds and shouted and threw and tumbled into ditches and
over and through hedges as wild as the Madman himself

Presently the party in full cry after an old blackbird who was
evidently used to the thing and enjoyed the fun for he would wait till
they came close to him and then fly on for forty yards or so and with
an impudent flicker of his tail dart into the depths of the quickset
came beating down a high double hedge two on each side

There he is again Head him Let drive I had him there Take
care where youre throwing Madman The shouts might have been heard a
quarter of a mile off They were heard some two hundred yards off by a
farmer and two of his shepherds who were doctoring sheep in a fold in
the next field

Now the farmer in question rented a house and yard situate at the end
of the field in which the young birdfanciers had arrived which house
and yard he didnt occupy or keep any one else in Nevertheless like
a brainless and unreasoning Briton he persisted in maintaining on the
premises a large stock of cocks hens and other poultry Of course
all sorts of depredators visited the place from time to time foxes and
gipsies wrought havoc in the night while in the daytime I regret
to have to confess that visits from the Rugby boys and consequent
disappearances of ancient and respectable fowls were not unfrequent
Tom and East had during the period of their outlawry visited the farm in
question for felonious purposes and on one occasion had conquered and
slain a duck there and borne away the carcass triumphantly hidden in
their handkerchiefs However they were sickened of the practice by the
trouble and anxiety which the wretched ducks body caused them They
carried it to Sally Harrowells in hopes of a good supper but she
after examining it made a long face and refused to dress or have
anything to do with it Then they took it into their study and began
plucking it themselves but what to do with the feathers where to hide
them

Good gracious Tom what a lot of feathers a duck has groaned East
holding a bagful in his hand and looking disconsolately at the carcass
not yet half plucked

And I do think hes getting high too already said Tom smelling at
him cautiously so we must finish him up soon

Yes all very well but how are we to cook him Im sure I aint going
to try it on in the hall or passages we cant afford to be roasting
ducks aboutour characters too bad

I wish we were rid of the brute said Tom throwing him on the table
in disgust And after a day or two more it became clear that got rid of
he must be so they packed him and sealed him up in brown paper and put
him in the cupboard of an unoccupied study where he was found in the
holidays by the matron a gruesome body

They had never been duckhunting there since but others had and the
bold yeoman was very sore on the subject and bent on making an example
of the first boys he could catch So he and his shepherds crouched
behind the hurdles and watched the party who were approaching all
unconscious Why should that old guineafowl be lying out in the
hedge just at this particular moment of all the year Who can say
Guineafowls always are so are all other things animals and persons
requisite for getting one into scrapesalways ready when any mischief
can come of them At any rate just under Easts nose popped out the old
guineahen scuttling along and shrieking Come back come back
at the top of her voice Either of the other three might perhaps have
withstood the temptation but East first lets drive the stone he has in
his hand at her and then rushes to turn her into the hedge again He
succeeds and then they are all at it for dear life up and down the
hedge in full cry the Come back come back getting shriller and
fainter every minute

Meantime the farmer and his men steal over the hurdles and creep down
the hedge towards the scene of action They are almost within a stones
throw of Martin who is pressing the unlucky chase hard when Tom
catches sight of them and sings out Louts ware louts your side
Madman look ahead and then catching hold of Arthur hurries him away
across the field towards Rugby as hard as they can tear Had he been by
himself he would have stayed to see it out with the others but now
his heart sinks and all his pluck goes The idea of being led up to the
Doctor with Arthur for bagging fowls quite unmans and takes half the run
out of him

However no boys are more able to take care of themselves than East and
Martin they dodge the pursuers slip through a gap and come pelting
after Tom and Arthur whom they catch up in no time The farmer and his
men are making good running about a field behind Tom wishes to himself
that they had made off in any other direction but now they are all in
for it together and must see it out

You wont leave the young un will you says he as they haul poor
little Arthur already losing wind from the fright through the next
hedge Not we is the answer from both The next hedge is a stiff
one the pursuers gain horribly on them and they only just pull Arthur
through with two great rents in his trousers as the foremost shepherd
comes up on the other side As they start into the next field they are
aware of two figures walking down the footpath in the middle of it and
recognize Holmes and Diggs taking a constitutional Those goodnatured
fellows immediately shout On Lets go to them and surrender
pants Tom Agreed And in another minute the four boys to the great
astonishment of those worthies rush breathless up to Holmes and Diggs
who pull up to see what is the matter and then the whole is explained
by the appearance of the farmer and his men who unite their forces and
bear down on the knot of boys

There is no time to explain and Toms heart beats frightfully quick as
he ponders Will they stand by us

The farmer makes a rush at East and collars him and that young
gentleman with unusual discretion instead of kicking his shins looks
appealingly at Holmes and stands still

Hullo there not so fast says Holmes who is bound to stand up for
them till they are proved in the wrong Now whats all this about

Ive got the young varmint at last have I pants the farmer why
theyve been askulking about my yard and stealing my fowlsthats
where tis and if I doant have they flogged for it every one on em
my name aint Thompson

Holmes looks grave and Diggss face falls They are quite ready to
fightno boys in the school more so but they are praepostors and
understand their office and cant uphold unrighteous causes

I havent been near his old barn this half cries East Nor I Nor
I chime in Tom and Martin

Now Willum didnt you see em there last week

Ees I seen em sure enough says Willum grasping a prong he carried
and preparing for action

The boys deny stoutly and Willum is driven to admit that if it wornt
they twas chaps as like em as two peasn and leastways hell swear
he seed them two in the yard last Martinmas indicating East and Tom

Holmes has had time to meditate Now sir says he to Willum you see
you cant remember what you have seen and I believe the boys

I doant care blusters the farmer they was arter my fowls
todaythats enough for IWillum you catch hold o tother chap
Theyve been asneaking about this two hours I tells ee shouted he
as Holmes stands between Martin and Willum and have druv a matter of a
dozen young pullets pretty nigh to death

Oh theres a whacker cried East we havent been within a hundred
yards of his barn we havent been up here above ten minutes and weve
seen nothing but a tough old guineahen who ran like a greyhound

Indeed thats all true Holmes upon my honour added Tom we
werent after his fowls guineahen ran out of the hedge under our feet
and weve seen nothing else

Drat their talk Thee catch hold o tother Willum and come along wi
un

Farmer Thompson said Holmes warning off Willum and the prong with
his stick while Diggs faced the other shepherd cracking his fingers
like pistolshots now listen to reason The boys havent been after
your fowls thats plain

Tells ee I seedem Who be you I should like to know

Never you mind farmer answered Holmes And now Ill just tell you
what it is you ought to be ashamed of yourself for leaving all that
poultry about with no one to watch it so near the School You deserve
to have it all stolen So if you choose to come up to the Doctor with
them I shall go with you and tell him what I think of it

The farmer began to take Holmes for a master besides he wanted to get
back to his flock Corporal punishment was out of the question the odds
were too great so he began to hint at paying for the damage Arthur
jumped at this offering to pay anything and the farmer immediately
valued the guineahen at half a sovereign

Half a sovereign cried East now released from the farmers grip
well that is a good one The old hen aint hurt a bit and shes seven
years old I know and as tough as whipcord she couldnt lay another
egg to save her life

It was at last settled that they should pay the farmer two shillings
and his man one shilling and so the matter ended to the unspeakable
relief of Tom who hadnt been able to say a word being sick at heart
at the idea of what the Doctor would think of him and now the whole
party of boys marched off down the footpath towards Rugby Holmes who
was one of the best boys in the School began to improve the occasion
Now you youngsters said he as he marched along in the middle of
them mind this youre very well out of this scrape Dont you go near
Thompsons barn again do you hear

Profuse promises from all especially East

Mind I dont ask questions went on Mentor but I rather think some
of you have been there before this after his chickens Now knocking
over other peoples chickens and running off with them is stealing
Its a nasty word but thats the plain English of it If the chickens
were dead and lying in a shop you wouldnt take them I know that any
more than you would apples out of Griffiths basket but theres no real
difference between chickens running about and apples on a tree and the
same articles in a shop I wish our morals were sounder in such matters
Theres nothing so mischievous as these school distinctions which
jumble up right and wrong and justify things in us for which poor boys
would be sent to prison And good old Holmes delivered his soul on the
walk home of many wise sayings and as the song says

 Geed em a sight of good advice

which same sermon sank into them all more or less and very penitent
they were for several hours But truth compels me to admit that East at
any rate forgot it all in a week but remembered the insult which had
been put upon him by Farmer Thompson and with the Tadpole and other
hairbrained youngsters committed a raid on the barn soon afterwards
in which they were caught by the shepherds and severely handled besides
having to pay eight shillingsall the money they had in the worldto
escape being taken up to the Doctor

Martin became a constant inmate in the joint study from this time and
Arthur took to him so kindly that Tom couldnt resist slight fits of
jealousy which however he managed to keep to himself The kestrels
eggs had not been broken strange to say and formed the nucleus
of Arthurs collection at which Martin worked heart and soul and
introduced Arthur to Howlett the birdfancier and instructed him in
the rudiments of the art of stuffing In token of his gratitude Arthur
allowed Martin to tattoo a small anchor on one of his wrists which
decoration however he carefully concealed from Tom Before the end of
the halfyear he had trained into a bold climber and good runner and
as Martin had foretold knew twice as much about trees birds flowers
and many other things as our goodhearted and facetious young friend
Harry East



CHAPTER VTHE FIGHT

 Surgebat Macnevisius
 Et mox jactabat ultro
 Pugnabo tua gratia
 Feroci hoc MactwoltroEtonian

There is a certain sort of fellowwe who are used to studying boys all
know him well enoughof whom you can predicate with almost positive
certainty after he has been a month at school that he is sure to have
a fight and with almost equal certainty that he will have but one Tom
Brown was one of these and as it is our wellweighed intention to give
a full true and correct account of Toms only single combat with a
schoolfellow in the manner of our old friend Bells Life let those
young persons whose stomachs are not strong or who think a good setto
with the weapons which God has given us all an uncivilized unchristian
or ungentlemanly affair just skip this chapter at once for it wont be
to their taste

It was not at all usual in those days for two Schoolhouse boys to
have a fight Of course there were exceptions when some crossgrained
hardheaded fellow came up who would never be happy unless he was
quarrelling with his nearest neighbours or when there was some
classdispute between the fifth form and the fags for instance which
required bloodletting and a champion was picked out on each side
tacitly who settled the matter by a good hearty mill But for the
most part the constant use of those surest keepers of the peace the
boxinggloves kept the Schoolhouse boys from fighting one another Two
or three nights in every week the gloves were brought out either in the
hall or fifthform room and every boy who was ever likely to fight at
all knew all his neighbours prowess perfectly well and could tell to a
nicety what chance he would have in a standup fight with any other
boy in the house But of course no such experience could be gotten as
regarded boys in other houses and as most of the other houses were more
or less jealous of the Schoolhouse collisions were frequent

After all what would life be without fighting I should like to know
From the cradle to the grave fighting rightly understood is the
business the real highest honestest business of every son of man
Every one who is worth his salt has his enemies who must be beaten be
they evil thoughts and habits in himself or spiritual wickednesses in
high places or Russians or Borderruffians or Bill Tom or Harry
who will not let him live his life in quiet till he has thrashed them

It is no good for quakers or any other body of men to uplift their
voices against fighting Human nature is too strong for them and they
dont follow their own precepts Every soul of them is doing his own
piece of fighting somehow and somewhere The world might be a better
world without fighting for anything I know but it wouldnt be our
world and therefore I am dead against crying peace when there is no
peace and isnt meant to be I am as sorry as any man to see folk
fighting the wrong people and the wrong things but Id a deal sooner
see them doing that than that they should have no fight in them So
having recorded and being about to record my heros fights of all
sorts with all sorts of enemies I shall now proceed to give an account
of his passageatarms with the only one of his schoolfellows whom he
ever had to encounter in this manner

It was drawing towards the close of Arthurs first halfyear and
the May evenings were lengthening out Lockingup was not till eight
oclock and everybody was beginning to talk about what he would do in
the holidays The shell in which form all our dramatis personae now
are were reading amongst other things the last book of Homers
Iliad and had worked through it as far as the speeches of the women
over Hectors body It is a whole schoolday and four or five of the
Schoolhouse boys amongst whom are Arthur Tom and East are preparing
third lesson together They have finished the regulation forty lines
and are for the most part getting very tired notwithstanding
the exquisite pathos of Helens lamentation And now several long
foursyllabled words come together and the boy with the dictionary
strikes work

I am not going to look out any more words says he weve done the
quantity Ten to one we shant get so far Lets go out into the close

Come along boys cries East always ready to leave the grind as he
called it our old coach is laid up you know and we shall have one of
the new masters whos sure to go slow and let us down easy

So an adjournment to the close was carried nem con little Arthur not
daring to uplift his voice but being deeply interested in what they
were reading stayed quietly behind and learnt on for his own pleasure

As East had said the regular master of the form was unwell and they
were to be heard by one of the new mastersquite a young man who had
only just left the university Certainly it would be hard lines if
by dawdling as much as possible in coming in and taking their places
entering into longwinded explanations of what was the usual course of
the regular master of the form and others of the stock contrivances of
boys for wasting time in school they could not spin out the lesson so
that he should not work them through more than the forty lines As to
which quantity there was a perpetual fight going on between the master
and his formthe latter insisting and enforcing by passive resistance
that it was the prescribed quantity of Homer for a shell lesson the
former that there was no fixed quantity but that they must always be
ready to go on to fifty or sixty lines if there were time within the
hour However notwithstanding all their efforts the new master got on
horribly quick He seemed to have the bad taste to be really interested
in the lesson and to be trying to work them up into something like
appreciation of it giving them good spirited English words instead
of the wretched bald stuff into which they rendered poor old Homer and
construing over each piece himself to them after each boy to show them
how it should be done

Now the clock strikes the threequarters there is only a quarter of an
hour more but the forty lines are all but done So the boys one after
another who are called up stick more and more and make balder and
ever more bald work of it The poor young master is pretty near beat by
this time and feels ready to knock his head against the wall or his
fingers against somebody elses head So he gives up altogether the
lower and middle parts of the form and looks round in despair at the
boys on the top bench to see if there is one out of whom he can strike
a spark or two and who will be too chivalrous to murder the most
beautiful utterances of the most beautiful woman of the old world His
eye rests on Arthur and he calls him up to finish construing Helens
speech Whereupon all the other boys draw long breaths and begin to
stare about and take it easy They are all safe Arthur is the head of
the form and sure to be able to construe and that will tide on safely
till the hour strikes

Arthur proceeds to read out the passage in Greek before construing it
as the custom is Tom who isnt paying much attention is suddenly
caught by the falter in his voice as he reads the two lines

greek text deleted

He looks up at Arthur Why bless us thinks he what can be the
matter with the young un Hes never going to get floored Hes sure
to have learnt to the end Next moment he is reassured by the spirited
tone in which Arthur begins construing and betakes himself to drawing
dogs heads in his notebook while the master evidently enjoying the
change turns his back on the middle bench and stands before Arthur
beating a sort of time with his hand and foot and saying Yes yes
Very well as Arthur goes on

But as he nears the fatal two lines Tom catches that falter and again
looks up He sees that there is something the matter Arthur can hardly
get on at all What can it be

Suddenly at this point Arthur breaks down altogether and fairly bursts
out crying and dashes the cuff of his jacket across his eyes blushing
up to the roots of his hair and feeling as if he should like to go down
suddenly through the floor The whole form are taken aback most of them
stare stupidly at him while those who are gifted with presence of mind
find their places and look steadily at their books in hopes of not
catching the masters eye and getting called up in Arthurs place

The master looks puzzled for a moment and then seeing as the fact is
that the boy is really affected to tears by the most touching thing in
Homer perhaps in all profane poetry put together steps up to him and
lays his hand kindly on his shoulder saying Never mind my little
man youve construed very well Stop a minute theres no hurry

Now as luck would have it there sat next above Tom on that day in
the middle bench of the form a big boy by name Williams generally
supposed to be the cock of the shell therefore of all the school below
the fifths The small boys who are great speculators on the prowess of
their elders used to hold forth to one another about Williamss great
strength and to discuss whether East or Brown would take a licking from
him He was called Slogger Williams from the force with which it was
supposed he could hit In the main he was a rough goodnatured fellow
enough but very much alive to his own dignity He reckoned himself
the king of the form and kept up his position with the strong hand
especially in the matter of forcing boys not to construe more than the
legitimate forty lines He had already grunted and grumbled to himself
when Arthur went on reading beyond the forty lines but now that he
had broken down just in the middle of all the long words the Sloggers
wrath was fairly roused

Sneaking little brute muttered he regardless of prudenceclapping
on the waterworks just in the hardest place see if I dont punch his
head after fourth lesson

Whose said Tom to whom the remark seemed to be addressed

Why that little sneak Arthurs replied Williams

No you shant said Tom

Hullo exclaimed Williams looking at Tom with great surprise for a
moment and then giving him a sudden dig in the ribs with his elbow
which sent Toms books flying on to the floor and called the attention
of the master who turned suddenly round and seeing the state of
things said

Williams go down three places and then go on

The Slogger found his legs very slowly and proceeded to go below Tom
and two other boys with great disgust and then turning round and
facing the master said I havent learnt any more sir our lesson is
only forty lines

Is that so said the master appealing generally to the top bench No
answer

Who is the head boy of the form said he waxing wroth

Arthur sir answered three or four boys indicating our friend

Oh your names Arthur Well now what is the length of your regular
lesson

Arthur hesitated a moment and then said We call it only forty lines
sir

How do you meanyou call it

Well sir Mr Graham says we aint to stop there when theres time to
construe more

I understand said the masterWilliams go down three more places
and write me out the lesson in Greek and English And now Arthur
finish construing

Oh would I be in Arthurs shoes after fourth lesson said the little
boys to one another but Arthur finished Helens speech without any
further catastrophe and the clock struck four which ended third
lesson

Another hour was occupied in preparing and saying fourth lesson during
which Williams was bottling up his wrath and when five struck and the
lessons for the day were over he prepared to take summary vengeance on
the innocent cause of his misfortune

Tom was detained in school a few minutes after the rest and on coming
out into the quadrangle the first thing he saw was a small ring of
boys applauding Williams who was holding Arthur by the collar

There you young sneak said he giving Arthur a cuff on the head with
his other hand what made you say that

Hullo said Tom shouldering into the crowd you drop that Williams
you shant touch him

Wholl stop me said the Slogger raising his hand again

I said Tom and suiting the action to the word he struck the arm
which held Arthurs arm so sharply that the Slogger dropped it with a
start and turned the full current of his wrath on Tom

Will you fight

Yes of course

Huzza Theres going to be a fight between Slogger Williams and Tom
Brown

The news ran like wildfire about and many boys who were on their way
to tea at their several houses turned back and sought the back of the
chapel where the fights come off

Just run and tell East to come and back me said Tom to a small
Schoolhouse boy who was off like a rocket to Harrowells just
stopping for a moment to poke his head into the Schoolhouse hall where
the lower boys were already at tea and sing out Fight Tom Brown and
Slogger Williams

Up start half the boys at once leaving bread eggs butter sprats
and all the rest to take care of themselves The greater part of the
remainder follow in a minute after swallowing their tea carrying their
food in their hands to consume as they go Three or four only remain
who steal the butter of the more impetuous and make to themselves an
unctuous feast

In another minute East and Martin tear through the quadrangle carrying
a sponge and arrive at the scene of action just as the combatants are
beginning to strip

Tom felt he had got his work cut out for him as he stripped off his
jacket waistcoat and braces East tied his handkerchief round his
waist and rolled up his shirtsleeves for him Now old boy dont you
open your mouth to say a word or try to help yourself a bitwell do
all that you keep all your breath and strength for the Slogger Martin
meanwhile folded the clothes and put them under the chapel rails and
now Tom with East to handle him and Martin to give him a knee steps
out on the turf and is ready for all that may come and here is the
Slogger too all stripped and thirsting for the fray

It doesnt look a fair match at first glance Williams is nearly two
inches taller and probably a long year older than his opponent and he
is very strongly made about the arms and shoulderspeels well as the
little knot of big fifthform boys the amateurs say who stand outside
the ring of little boys looking complacently on but taking no active
part in the proceedings But down below he is not so good by any
meansno spring from the loins and feeblish not to say shipwrecky
about the knees Tom on the contrary though not half so strong in the
arms is good all over straight hard and springy from neck to ankle
better perhaps in his legs than anywhere Besides you can see by the
clear white of his eye and fresh bright look of his skin that he is
in tiptop training able to do all he knows while the Slogger looks
rather sodden as if he didnt take much exercise and ate too much
tuck The timekeeper is chosen a large ring made and the two stand
up opposite one another for a moment giving us time just to make our
little observations

If Tomll only condescend to fight with his head and heels as East
mutters to Martin we shall do

But seemingly he wont for there he goes in making play with both
hands Hard all is the word the two stand to one another like men
rally follows rally in quick succession each fighting as if he thought
to finish the whole thing out of hand Cant last at this rate say
the knowing ones while the partisans of each make the air ring
with their shouts and countershouts of encouragement approval and
defiance

Take it easy take it easy keep away let him come after you
implores East as he wipes Toms face after the first round with a wet
sponge while he sits back on Martins knee supported by the Madmans
long arms which tremble a little from excitement

Times up calls the timekeeper

There he goes again hang it all growls East as his man is at it
again as hard as ever A very severe round follows in which Tom gets
out and out the worst of it and is at last hit clean off his legs and
deposited on the grass by a righthander from the Slogger

Loud shouts rise from the boys of Sloggers house and the Schoolhouse
are silent and vicious ready to pick quarrels anywhere

Two to one in halfcrowns on the big un says Rattle one of the
amateurs a tall fellow in thunderandlightning waistcoat and puffy
goodnatured face

Done says Groove another amateur of quieter look taking out his
notebook to enter it for our friend Rattle sometimes forgets these
little things

Meantime East is freshening up Tom with the sponges for next round and
has set two other boys to rub his hands

Tom old boy whispers he this may be fun for you but its death to
me Hell hit all the fight out of you in another five minutes and then
I shall go and drown myself in the island ditch Feint him use your
legs draw him about Hell lose his wind then in no time and you can
go into him Hit at his body too well take care of his frontispiece
byandby

Tom felt the wisdom of the counsel and saw already that he couldnt go
in and finish the Slogger off at mere hammer and tongs so changed his
tactics completely in the third round He now fights cautiously getting
away from and parrying the Sloggers lunging hits instead of trying
to counter and leading his enemy a dance all round the ring after
him Hes funking go in Williams Catch him up Finish him off
scream the small boys of the Slogger party

Just what we want thinks East chuckling to himself as he sees
Williams excited by these shouts and thinking the game in his own
hands blowing himself in his exertions to get to close quarters again
while Tom is keeping away with perfect ease

They quarter over the ground again and again Tom always on the
defensive

The Slogger pulls up at last for a moment fairly blown

Now then Tom sings out East dancing with delight Tom goes in in a
twinkling and hits two heavy body blows and gets away again before the
Slogger can catch his wind which when he does he rushes with blind fury
at Tom and being skilfully parried and avoided overreaches himself and
falls on his face amidst terrific cheers from the Schoolhouse boys

Double your two to one says Groove to Rattle notebook in hand

Stop a bit says that hero looking uncomfortably at Williams who is
puffing away on his seconds knee winded enough but little the worse
in any other way

After another round the Slogger too seems to see that he cant go in and
win right off and has met his match or thereabouts So he too begins
to use his head and tries to make Tom lose his patience and come in
before his time And so the fight sways on now one and now the other
getting a trifling pull

Toms face begins to look very onesidedthere are little queer bumps
on his forehead and his mouth is bleeding but East keeps the wet
sponge going so scientifically that he comes up looking as fresh and
bright as ever Williams is only slightly marked in the face but by
the nervous movement of his elbows you can see that Toms body blows are
telling In fact half the vice of the Sloggers hitting is neutralized
for he darent lunge out freely for fear of exposing his sides It is
too interesting by this time for much shouting and the whole ring is
very quiet

All right Tommy whispers East hold ons the horse thats to win
Weve got the last Keep your head old boy

But where is Arthur all this time Words cannot paint the poor little
fellows distress He couldnt muster courage to come up to the ring
but wandered up and down from the great fives court to the corner of the
chapel rails now trying to make up his mind to throw himself between
them and try to stop them then thinking of running in and telling his
friend Mary who he knew would instantly report to the Doctor
The stories he had heard of men being killed in prizefights rose up
horribly before him

Once only when the shouts of Well done Brown Huzza for the
Schoolhouse rose higher than ever he ventured up to the ring
thinking the victory was won Catching sight of Toms face in the state
I have described all fear of consequences vanishing out of his mind
he rushed straight off to the matrons room beseeching her to get the
fight stopped or he should die

But its time for us to get back to the close What is this fierce
tumult and confusion The ring is broken and high and angry words are
being bandied about Its all fairIt isntNo hugging The
fight is stopped The combatants however sit there quietly tended by
their seconds while their adherents wrangle in the middle East cant
help shouting challenges to two or three of the other side though he
never leaves Tom for a moment and plies the sponges as fast as ever

The fact is that at the end of the last round Tom seeing a good
opening had closed with his opponent and after a moments struggle
had thrown him heavily by help of the fall he had learnt from his
village rival in the Vale of White Horse Williams hadnt the ghost of
a chance with Tom at wrestling and the conviction broke at once on
the Slogger faction that if this were allowed their man must be licked
There was a strong feeling in the School against catching hold and
throwing though it was generally ruled all fair within limits so the
ring was broken and the fight stopped

The Schoolhouse are overruledthe fight is on again but there is to
be no throwing and East in high wrath threatens to take his man away
after next round which he dont mean to do by the way when suddenly
young Brooke comes through the small gate at the end of the chapel The
Schoolhouse faction rush to him Oh hurrah now we shall get fair
play

Please Brooke come up They wont let Tom Brown throw him

Throw whom says Brooke coming up to the ring Oh Williams I see
Nonsense Of course he may throw him if he catches him fairly above the
waist

Now young Brooke youre in the sixth you know and you ought to stop
all fights He looks hard at both boys Anything wrong says he to
East nodding at Tom

Not a bit

Not beat at all

Bless you no Heaps of fight in himAint there Tom

Tom looks at Brooke and grins

Hows he nodding at Williams

So so rather done I think since his last fall He wont stand above
two more

Times up The boys rise again and face one another Brooke cant find
it in his heart to stop them just yet so the round goes on the Slogger
waiting for Tom and reserving all his strength to hit him out should
he come in for the wrestling dodge again for he feels that that must be
stopped or his sponge will soon go up in the air

And now another newcomer appears on the field to wit the underporter
with his long brush and great wooden receptacle for dust under his arm
He has been sweeping out the schools

Youd better stop gentlemen he says the Doctor knows that Browns
fightinghell be out in a minute

You go to Bath Bill is all that that excellent servitor gets by
his advice and being a man of his hands and a stanch upholder of the
Schoolhouse cant help stopping to look on for a bit and see Tom
Brown their pet craftsman fight a round

It is grim earnest now and no mistake Both boys feel this and summon
every power of head hand and eye to their aid A piece of luck on
either side a foot slipping a blow getting well home or another fall
may decide it Tom works slowly round for an opening he has all the
legs and can choose his own time The Slogger waits for the attack
and hopes to finish it by some heavy righthanded blow As they quarter
slowly over the ground the evening sun comes out from behind a cloud
and falls full on Williamss face Tom darts in the heavy right hand
is delivered but only grazes his head A short rally at close quarters
and they close in another moment the Slogger is thrown again heavily
for the third time

Ill give you three or two on the little one in halfcrowns said
Groove to Rattle

No thank ee answers the other diving his hands farther into his
coattails

Just at this stage of the proceedings the door of the turret which
leads to the Doctors library suddenly opens and he steps into the
close and makes straight for the ring in which Brown and the Slogger
are both seated on their seconds knees for the last time

The Doctor the Doctor shouts some small boy who catches sight of
him and the ring melts away in a few seconds the small boys tearing
off Tom collaring his jacket and waistcoat and slipping through the
little gate by the chapel and round the corner to Harrowells with his
backers as lively as need be Williams and his backers making off not
quite so fast across the close Groove Rattle and the other bigger
fellows trying to combine dignity and prudence in a comical manner and
walking off fast enough they hope not to be recognized and not fast
enough to look like running away

Young Brooke alone remains on the ground by the time the Doctor gets
there and touches his hat not without a slight inward qualm

Hah Brooke I am surprised to see you here Dont you know that I
expect the sixth to stop fighting

Brooke felt much more uncomfortable than he had expected but he was
rather a favourite with the Doctor for his openness and plainness of
speech so blurted out as he walked by the Doctors side who had
already turned back

Yes sir generally But I thought you wished us to exercise a
discretion in the matter toonot to interfere too soon

But they have been fighting this halfhour and more said the Doctor

Yes sir but neither was hurt And theyre the sort of boys wholl be
all the better friends now which they wouldnt have been if they had
been stopped any earlierbefore it was so equal

Who was fighting with Brown said the Doctor

Williams sir of Thompsons He is bigger than Brown and had the best
of it at first but not when you came up sir Theres a good deal of
jealousy between our house and Thompsons and there would have been
more fights if this hadnt been let go on or if either of them had had
much the worst of it

Well but Brooke said the Doctor doesnt this look a little as
if you exercised your discretion by only stopping a fight when the
Schoolhouse boy is getting the worst of it

Brooke it must be confessed felt rather gravelled

Now remember added the Doctor as he stopped at the turretdoor
this fight is not to go on youll see to that And I expect you to
stop all fights in future at once

Very well sir said young Brooke touching his hat and not sorry to
see the turretdoor close behind the Doctors back

Meantime Tom and the stanchest of his adherents had reached Harrowells
and Sally was bustling about to get them a late tea while Stumps had
been sent off to Tew the butcher to get a piece of raw beef for Toms
eye which was to be healed offhand so that he might show well in the
morning He was not a bit the worse except a slight difficulty in his
vision a singing in his ears and a sprained thumb which he kept in
a coldwater bandage while he drank lots of tea and listened to the
babel of voices talking and speculating of nothing but the fight and
how Williams would have given in after another fall which he didnt in
the least believe and how on earth the Doctor could have got to know
of itsuch bad luck He couldnt help thinking to himself that he was
glad he hadnt won he liked it better as it was and felt very friendly
to the Slogger And then poor little Arthur crept in and sat down
quietly near him and kept looking at him and the raw beef with such
plaintive looks that Tom at last burst out laughing

Dont make such eyes young un said he theres nothing the matter

Oh but Tom are you much hurt I cant bear thinking it was all for
me

Not a bit of it dont flatter yourself We were sure to have had it
out sooner or later

Well but you wont go on will you Youll promise me you wont go
on

Cant tell about thatall depends on the houses Were in the hands
of our countrymen you know Must fight for the Schoolhouse flag if so
be

However the lovers of the science were doomed to disappointment this
time Directly after lockingup one of the nightfags knocked at Toms
door

Brown young Brooke wants you in the sixthform room

Up went Tom to the summons and found the magnates sitting at their
supper

Well Brown said young Brooke nodding to him how do you feel

Oh very well thank you only Ive sprained my thumb I think

Sure to do that in a fight Well you hadnt the worst of it I could
see Where did you learn that throw

Down in the country when I was a boy

Hullo why what are you now Well never mind youre a plucky fellow
Sit down and have some supper

Tom obeyed by no means loath And the fifthform boy next filled him a
tumbler of bottled beer and he ate and drank listening to the pleasant
talk and wondering how soon he should be in the fifth and one of that
muchenvied society

As he got up to leave Brooke said You must shake hands tomorrow
morning I shall come and see that done after first lesson

And so he did And Tom and the Slogger shook hands with great
satisfaction and mutual respect And for the next year or two whenever
fights were being talked of the small boys who had been present shook
their heads wisely saying Ah but you should just have seen the fight
between Slogger Williams and Tom Brown

And now boys all three words before we quit the subject I have put
in this chapter on fighting of malice prepense partly because I want to
give you a true picture of what everyday school life was in my time and
not a kidglove and gotomeetingcoat picture and partly because of
the cant and twaddle thats talked of boxing and fighting with fists
nowadays Even Thackeray has given in to it and only a few weeks ago
there was some rampant stuff in the Times on the subject in an article
on field sports

Boys will quarrel and when they quarrel will sometimes fight Fighting
with fists is the natural and English way for English boys to settle
their quarrels What substitute for it is there or ever was there
amongst any nation under the sun What would you like to see take its
place

Learn to box then as you learn to play cricket and football Not one
of you will be the worse but very much the better for learning to box
well Should you never have to use it in earnest theres no exercise
in the world so good for the temper and for the muscles of the back and
legs

As to fighting keep out of it if you can by all means When the
time comes if it ever should that you have to say Yes or No to
a challenge to fight say No if you canonly take care you make
it clear to yourselves why you say No Its a proof of the highest
courage if done from true Christian motives Its quite right and
justifiable if done from a simple aversion to physical pain and danger
But dont say No because you fear a licking and say or think its
because you fear God for thats neither Christian nor honest And if
you do fight fight it out and dont give in while you can stand and
see



CHAPTER VIFEVER IN THE SCHOOL

 This our hope for all thats mortal
 And we too shall burst the bond
 Death keeps watch beside the portal
 But tis life that dwells beyond
 JOHN STERLING

Two years have passed since the events recorded in the last chapter and
the end of the summer halfyear is again drawing on Martin has left and
gone on a cruise in the South Pacific in one of his uncles ships the
old magpie as disreputable as ever his last bequest to Arthur lives
in the joint study Arthur is nearly sixteen and at the head of the
twenty having gone up the school at the rate of a form a halfyear
East and Tom have been much more deliberate in their progress and are
only a little way up the fifth form Great strapping boys they are
but still thorough boys filling about the same place in the house that
young Brooke filled when they were new boys and much the same sort
of fellows Constant intercourse with Arthur has done much for both of
them especially for Tom but much remains yet to be done if they
are to get all the good out of Rugby which is to be got there in these
times Arthur is still frail and delicate with more spirit than body
but thanks to his intimacy with them and Martin has learned to swim
and run and play cricket and has never hurt himself by too much
reading

One evening as they were all sitting down to supper in the fifthform
room some one started a report that a fever had broken out at one of
the boardinghouses They say he added that Thompson is very ill
and that Dr Robertson has been sent for from Northampton

Then we shall all be sent home cried another Hurrah five weeks
extra holidays and no fifthform examination

I hope not said Tom therell be no Marylebone match then at the end
of the half

Some thought one thing some another many didnt believe the report
but the next day Tuesday Dr Robertson arrived and stayed all day
and had long conferences with the Doctor

On Wednesday morning after prayers the Doctor addressed the whole
school There were several cases of fever in different houses he said
but Dr Robertson after the most careful examination had assured him
that it was not infectious and that if proper care were taken
there could be no reason for stopping the schoolwork at present The
examinations were just coming on and it would be very unadvisable to
break up now However any boys who chose to do so were at liberty to
write home and if their parents wished it to leave at once He should
send the whole school home if the fever spread

The next day Arthur sickened but there was no other case Before the
end of the week thirty or forty boys had gone but the rest stayed on
There was a general wish to please the Doctor and a feeling that it was
cowardly to run away

On the Saturday Thompson died in the bright afternoon while the
cricketmatch was going on as usual on the bigside ground The Doctor
coming from his deathbed passed along the gravelwalk at the side
of the close but no one knew what had happened till the next day At
morning lecture it began to be rumoured and by afternoon chapel was
known generally and a feeling of seriousness and awe at the actual
presence of death among them came over the whole school In all the long
years of his ministry the Doctor perhaps never spoke words which sank
deeper than some of those in that days sermon

When I came yesterday from visiting all but the very deathbed of him
who has been taken from us and looked around upon all the familiar
objects and scenes within our own ground where your common amusements
were going on with your common cheerfulness and activity I felt there
was nothing painful in witnessing that it did not seem in any way
shocking or out of tune with those feelings which the sight of a dying
Christian must be supposed to awaken The unsuitableness in point of
natural feeling between scenes of mourning and scenes of liveliness did
not at all present itself But I did feel that if at that moment any of
those faults had been brought before me which sometimes occur amongst
us had I heard that any of you had been guilty of falsehood or of
drunkenness or of any other such sin had I heard from any quarter the
language of profaneness or of unkindness or of indecency had I heard
or seen any signs of that wretched folly which courts the laugh of
fools by affecting not to dread evil and not to care for good then the
unsuitableness of any of these things with the scene I had just quitted
would indeed have been most intensely painful And why Not because such
things would really have been worse than at any other time but because
at such a moment the eyes are opened really to know good and evil
because we then feel what it is so to live as that death becomes an
infinite blessing and what it is so to live also that it were good for
us if we had never been born

Tom had gone into chapel in sickening anxiety about Arthur but he came
out cheered and strengthened by those grand words and walked up alone
to their study And when he sat down and looked round and saw Arthurs
straw hat and cricketjacket hanging on their pegs and marked all his
little neat arrangements not one of which had been disturbed the tears
indeed rolled down his cheeks but they were calm and blessed tears and
he repeated to himself Yes Geordies eyes are opened he knows what
it is so to live as that death becomes an infinite blessing But do I O
God can I bear to lose him

The week passed mournfully away No more boys sickened but Arthur was
reported worse each day and his mother arrived early in the week Tom
made many appeals to be allowed to see him and several times tried to
get up to the sickroom but the housekeeper was always in the way and
at last spoke to the Doctor who kindly but peremptorily forbade him

Thompson was buried on the Tuesday and the burial service so soothing
and grand always but beyond all words solemn when read over a boys
grave to his companions brought him much comfort and many strange
new thoughts and longings He went back to his regular life and played
cricket and bathed as usual It seemed to him that this was the right
thing to do and the new thoughts and longings became more brave and
healthy for the effort The crisis came on Saturday the day week that
Thompson had died and during that long afternoon Tom sat in his study
reading his Bible and going every halfhour to the housekeepers room
expecting each time to hear that the gentle and brave little spirit
had gone home But God had work for Arthur to do The crisis passed
on Sunday evening he was declared out of danger on Monday he sent a
message to Tom that he was almost well had changed his room and was to
be allowed to see him the next day

It was evening when the housekeeper summoned him to the sickroom
Arthur was lying on the sofa by the open window through which the rays
of the western sun stole gently lighting up his white face and golden
hair Tom remembered a German picture of an angel which he knew often
had he thought how transparent and golden and spiritlike it was and
he shuddered to think how like it Arthur looked and felt a shock as if
his blood had all stopped short as he realized how near the other world
his friend must have been to look like that Never till that moment had
he felt how his little chum had twined himself round his heartstrings
and as he stole gently across the room and knelt down and put his arm
round Arthurs head on the pillow felt ashamed and halfangry at his
own red and brown face and the bounding sense of health and power which
filled every fibre of his body and made every movement of mere living a
joy to him He neednt have troubled himself it was this very strength
and power so different from his own which drew Arthur so to him

Arthur laid his thin white hand on which the blue veins stood out so
plainly on Toms great brown fist and smiled at him and then looked
out of the window again as if he couldnt bear to lose a moment of the
sunset into the tops of the great feathery elms round which the rooks
were circling and clanging returning in flocks from their evenings
foraging parties The elms rustled the sparrows in the ivy just outside
the window chirped and fluttered about quarrelling and making it up
again the rooks young and old talked in chorus and the merry shouts
of the boys and the sweet click of the cricketbats came up cheerily
from below

Dear George said Tom I am so glad to be let up to see you at last
Ive tried hard to come so often but they wouldnt let me before

Oh I know Tom Mary has told me every day about you and how she was
obliged to make the Doctor speak to you to keep you away Im very glad
you didnt get up for you might have caught it and you couldnt stand
being ill with all the matches going on And youre in the eleven too
I hear Im so glad

Yes aint it jolly said Tom proudly Im ninth too I made forty at
the last piematch and caught three fellows out So I was put in
above Jones and Tucker Tuckers so savage for he was head of the
twentytwo

Well I think you ought to be higher yet said Arthur who was as
jealous for the renown of Tom in games as Tom was for his as a scholar

Never mind I dont care about cricket or anything now youre getting
well Geordie and I shouldnt have hurt I know if theyd have let me
come up Nothing hurts me But youll get about now directly wont you
You wont believe how clean Ive kept the study All your things are
just as you left them and I feed the old magpie just when you used
though I have to come in from bigside for him the old rip He wont
look pleased all I can do and sticks his head first on one side and
then on the other and blinks at me before hell begin to eat till Im
half inclined to box his ears And whenever East comes in you should
see him hop off to the window dot and go one though Harry wouldnt
touch a feather of him now

Arthur laughed Old Gravey has a good memory he cant forget the
sieges of poor Martins den in old times He paused a moment and then
went on You cant think how often Ive been thinking of old Martin
since Ive been ill I suppose ones mind gets restless and likes to
wander off to strange unknown places I wonder what queer new pets the
old boy has got How he must be revelling in the thousand new birds
beasts and fishes

Tom felt a pang of jealousy but kicked it out in a moment Fancy him
on a South Sea island with the Cherokees or Patagonians or some
such wild niggers Toms ethnology and geography were faulty
but sufficient for his needs Theyll make the old Madman cock
medicineman and tattoo him all over Perhaps hes cutting about now
all blue and has a squaw and a wigwam Hell improve their boomerangs
and be able to throw them too without having old Thomas sent after him
by the Doctor to take them away

Arthur laughed at the remembrance of the boomerang story but then
looked grave again and said Hell convert all the island I know

Yes if he dont blow it up first

Do you remember Tom how you and East used to laugh at him and chaff
him because he said he was sure the rooks all had callingover or
prayers or something of the sort when the lockingup bell rang Well
I declare said Arthur looking up seriously into Toms laughing eyes
I do think he was right Since Ive been lying here Ive watched them
every night and do you know they really do come and perch all of
them just about lockingup time and then first theres a regular
chorus of caws and then they stop a bit and one old fellow or perhaps
two or three in different trees caw solos and then off they all go
again fluttering about and cawing anyhow till they roost

I wonder if the old blackies do talk said Tom looking up at them
How they must abuse me and East and pray for the Doctor for stopping
the slinging

There look look cried Arthur dont you see the old fellow without
a tail coming up Martin used to call him the clerk He cant steer
himself You never saw such fun as he is in a high wind when he cant
steer himself home and gets carried right past the trees and has to
bear up again and again before he can perch

The lockingup bell began to toll and the two boys were silent and
listened to it The sound soon carried Tom off to the river and the
woods and he began to go over in his mind the many occasions on which
he had heard that toll coming faintly down the breeze and had to pack
his rod in a hurry and make a run for it to get in before the gates
were shut He was roused with a start from his memories by Arthurs
voice gentle and weak from his late illness

Tom will you be angry if I talk to you very seriously

No dear old boy not I But aint you faint Arthur or ill What can
I get you Dont say anything to hurt yourself nowyou are very weak
let me come up again

No no I shant hurt myself Id sooner speak to you now if you dont
mind Ive asked Mary to tell the Doctor that you are with me so you
neednt go down to callingover and I maynt have another chance for
I shall most likely have to go home for change of air to get well and
maynt come back this half

Oh do you think you must go away before the end of the half Im
so sorry Its more than five weeks yet to the holidays and all the
fifthform examination and half the cricketmatches to come yet And
what shall I do all that time alone in our study Why Arthur it will
be more than twelve weeks before I see you again Oh hang it I cant
stand that Besides whos to keep me up to working at the examination
books I shall come out bottom of the form as sure as eggs is eggs

Tom was rattling on half in joke half in earnest for he wanted to
get Arthur out of his serious vein thinking it would do him harm but
Arthur broke in

Oh please Tom stop or youll drive all I had to say out of my head
And Im already horribly afraid Im going to make you angry

Dont gammon young un rejoined Tom the use of the old name dear to
him from old recollections made Arthur start and smile and feel quite
happy you know you aint afraid and youve never made me angry since
the first month we chummed together Now Im going to be quite sober for
a quarter of an hour which is more than I am once in a year so make
the most of it heave ahead and pitch into me right and left

Dear Tom I aint going to pitch into you said Arthur piteously and
it seems so cocky in me to be advising you whove been my backbone ever
since Ive been at Rugby and have made the school a paradise to me Ah
I see I shall never do it unless I go head over heels at once as
you said when you taught me to swim Tom I want you to give up using
vulgusbooks and cribs

Arthur sank back on to his pillow with a sigh as if the effort had been
great but the worst was now over and he looked straight at Tom who
was evidently taken aback He leant his elbows on his knees and stuck
his hands into his hair whistled a verse of Billy Taylor and then
was quite silent for another minute Not a shade crossed his face
but he was clearly puzzled At last he looked up and caught Arthurs
anxious look took his hand and said simply

Why young un

Because youre the honestest boy in Rugby and that aint honest

I dont see that

What were you sent to Rugby for

Well I dont know exactlynobody ever told me I suppose because all
boys are sent to a public school in England

But what do you think yourself What do you want to do here and to
carry away

Tom thought a minute I want to be A1 at cricket and football and all
the other games and to make my hands keep my head against any fellow
lout or gentleman I want to get into the sixth before I leave and to
please the Doctor and I want to carry away just as much Latin and Greek
as will take me through Oxford respectably There now young un I
never thought of it before but thats pretty much about my figure
Aint it all on the square What have you got to say to that

Why that you are pretty sure to do all that you want then

Well I hope so But youve forgot one thingwhat I want to leave
behind me I want to leave behind me said Tom speaking slow and
looking much moved the name of a fellow who never bullied a little
boy or turned his back on a big one

Arthur pressed his hand and after a moments silence went on You say
Tom you want to please the Doctor Now do you want to please him by
what he thinks you do or by what you really do

By what I really do of course

Does he think you use cribs and vulgusbooks

Tom felt at once that his flank was turned but he couldnt give in He
was at Winchester himself said he he knows all about it

Yes but does he think you use them Do you think he approves of it

You young villain said Tom shaking his fist at Arthur half vexed
and half pleased I never think about it Hang it there perhaps he
dont Well I suppose he dont

Arthur saw that he had got his point he knew his friend well and was
wise in silence as in speech He only said I would sooner have the
doctors good opinion of me as I really am than any mans in the world

After another minute Tom began again Look here young un How on
earth am I to get time to play the matches this half if I give up cribs
Were in the middle of that long crabbed chorus in the Agamemnon I can
only just make head or tail of it with the crib Then theres Pericless
speech coming on in Thucydides and The Birds to get up for the
examination besides the Tacitus Tom groaned at the thought of his
accumulated labours I say young un theres only five weeks or so
left to holidays Maynt I go on as usual for this half Ill tell the
Doctor about it some day or you may

Arthur looked out of the window The twilight had come on and all was
silent He repeated in a low voice In this thing the Lord pardon thy
servant that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship
there and he leaneth on my hand and I bow down myself in the house of
Rimmon when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon the Lord pardon
thy servant in this thing

Not a word more was said on the subject and the boys were again
silentone of those blessed short silences in which the resolves which
colour a life are so often taken

Tom was the first to break it Youve been very ill indeed havent
you Geordie said he with a mixture of awe and curiosity feeling as
if his friend had been in some strange place or scene of which he could
form no idea and full of the memory of his own thoughts during the last
week

Yes very Im sure the Doctor thought I was going to die He gave me
the Sacrament last Sunday and you cant think what he is when one is
ill He said such brave and tender and gentle things to me I felt
quite light and strong after it and never had any more fear My mother
brought our old medical man who attended me when I was a poor sickly
child He said my constitution was quite changed and that Im fit for
anything now If it hadnt I couldnt have stood three days of this
illness Thats all thanks to you and the games youve made me fond
of

More thanks to old Martin said Tom hes been your real friend

Nonsense Tom he never could have done for me what you have

Well I dont know I did little enough Did they tell youyou wont
mind hearing it now I knowthat poor Thompson died last week The
other three boys are getting quite round like you

Oh yes I heard of it

Then Tom who was quite full of it told Arthur of the burialservice
in the chapel and how it had impressed him and he believed all the
other boys And though the Doctor never said a word about it said he
and it was a halfholiday and matchday there wasnt a game played in
the close all the afternoon and the boys all went about as if it were
Sunday

Im very glad of it said Arthur But Tom Ive had such strange
thoughts about death lately Ive never told a soul of them not even my
mother Sometimes I think theyre wrong but do you know I dont think
in my heart I could be sorry at the death of any of my friends

Tom was taken quite aback What in the world is the young un after
now thought he Ive swallowed a good many of his crotchets but this
altogether beats me He cant be quite right in his head He didnt
want to say a word and shifted about uneasily in the dark however
Arthur seemed to be waiting for an answer so at last he said I dont
think I quite see what you mean Geordie Ones told so often to think
about death that Ive tried it on sometimes especially this last week
But we wont talk of it now Id better go Youre getting tired and I
shall do you harm

No no indeed I aint Tom You must stop till nine theres only
twenty minutes Ive settled you shall stop till nine And oh do let me
talk to youI must talk to you I see its just as I feared You think
Im half mad Dont you now

Well I did think it odd what you said Geordie as you ask me

Arthur paused a moment and then said quickly Ill tell you how it all
happened At first when I was sent to the sickroom and found I had
really got the fever I was terribly frightened I thought I should
die and I could not face it for a moment I dont think it was sheer
cowardice at first but I thought how hard it was to be taken away from
my mother and sisters and you all just as I was beginning to see my way
to many things and to feel that I might be a man and do a mans work
To die without having fought and worked and given ones life away
was too hard to bear I got terribly impatient and accused God of
injustice and strove to justify myself And the harder I strove the
deeper I sank Then the image of my dear father often came across me
but I turned from it Whenever it came a heavy numbing throb seemed to
take hold of my heart and say Deaddeaddead And I cried out The
living the living shall praise Thee O God the dead cannot praise
thee There is no work in the grave in the night no man can work But
I can work I can do great things I will do great things Why wilt thou
slay me And so I struggled and plunged deeper and deeper and went
down into a living black tomb I was alone there with no power to stir
or think alone with myself beyond the reach of all human fellowship
beyond Christs reach I thought in my nightmare You who are brave
and bright and strong can have no idea of that agony Pray to God you
never may Pray as for your life

Arthur stoppedfrom exhaustion Tom thought but what between his fear
lest Arthur should hurt himself his awe and his longing for him to go
on he couldnt ask or stir to help him

Presently he went on but quite calm and slow I dont know how long
I was in that statefor more than a day I know for I was quite
conscious and lived my outer life all the time and took my medicines
and spoke to my mother and heard what they said But I didnt take much
note of time I thought time was over for me and that that tomb was
what was beyond Well on last Sunday morning as I seemed to lie in
that tomb alone as I thought for ever and ever the black dead wall
was cleft in two and I was caught up and borne through into the light
by some great power some living mighty spirit Tom do you remember
the living creatures and the wheels in Ezekiel It was just like that
When they went I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of
great waters as the voice of the Almighty the voice of speech as the
noise of an host when they stood they let down their wings And
they went every one straight forward whither the spirit was to go they
went and they turned not when they went And we rushed through the
bright air which was full of myriads of living creatures and paused
on the brink of a great river And the power held me up and I knew that
that great river was the grave and death dwelt there but not the death
I had met in the black tomb That I felt was gone for ever For on the
other bank of the great river I saw men and women and children rising up
pure and bright and the tears were wiped from their eyes and they put
on glory and strength and all weariness and pain fell away And beyond
were a multitude which no man could number and they worked at some
great work and they who rose from the river went on and joined in the
work They all worked and each worked in a different way but all at
the same work And I saw there my father and the men in the old town
whom I knew when I was a childmany a hard stern man who never came
to church and whom they called atheist and infidel There they were
side by side with my father whom I had seen toil and die for them and
women and little children and the seal was on the foreheads of all And
I longed to see what the work was and could not so I tried to plunge
in the river for I thought I would join them but I could not Then I
looked about to see how they got into the river And this I could not
see but I saw myriads on this side and they too worked and I knew
that it was the same work and the same seal was on their foreheads And
though I saw that there was toil and anguish in the work of these and
that most that were working were blind and feeble yet I longed no more
to plunge into the river but more and more to know what the work was
And as I looked I saw my mother and my sisters and I saw the Doctor
and you Tom and hundreds more whom I knew and at last I saw myself
too and I was toiling and doing ever so little a piece of the great
work Then it all melted away and the power left me and as it left
me I thought I heard a voice say The vision is for an appointed time
though it tarry wait for it for in the end it shall speak and not lie
it shall surely come it shall not tarry It was early morning I know
thenit was so quiet and cool and my mother was fast asleep in the
chair by my bedside but it wasnt only a dream of mine I know it
wasnt a dream Then I fell into a deep sleep and only woke after
afternoon chapel and the Doctor came and gave me the Sacrament as I
told you I told him and my mother I should get wellI knew I should
but I couldnt tell them why Tom said Arthur gently after another
minute do you see why I could not grieve now to see my dearest friend
die It cant beit isntall fever or illness God would never have
let me see it so clear if it wasnt true I dont understand it all yet
it will take me my life and longer to do thatto find out what the work
is

When Arthur stopped there was a long pause Tom could not speak he was
almost afraid to breathe lest he should break the train of Arthurs
thoughts He longed to hear more and to ask questions In another
minute nine oclock struck and a gentle tap at the door called them
both back into the world again They did not answer however for a
moment and so the door opened and a lady came in carrying a candle

She went straight to the sofa and took hold of Arthurs hand and then
stooped down and kissed him

My dearest boy you feel a little feverish again Why didnt you have
lights Youve talked too much and excited yourself in the dark

Oh no mother you cant think how well I feel I shall start with
you tomorrow for Devonshire But mother heres my friendheres Tom
Brown You know him

Yes indeed Ive known him for years she said and held out her
hand to Tom who was now standing up behind the sofa This was Arthurs
mother tall and slight and fair with masses of golden hair drawn back
from the broad white forehead and the calm blue eye meeting his so
deep and openthe eye that he knew so well for it was his friends
over again and the lovely tender mouth that trembled while he
lookedshe stood there a woman of thirtyeight old enough to be his
mother and one whose face showed the lines which must be written on the
faces of good mens wives and widows but he thought he had never seen
anything so beautiful He couldnt help wondering if Arthurs sisters
were like her

Tom held her hand and looked on straight in her face he could neither
let it go nor speak

Now Tom said Arthur laughing where are your manners Youll stare
my mother out of countenance Tom dropped the little hand with a sigh
There sit down both of youHere dearest mother theres room
here And he made a place on the sofa for herTom you neednt go
Im sure you wont be called up at first lesson Tom felt that he
would risk being floored at every lesson for the rest of his natural
schoollife sooner than go so sat down And now said Arthur I have
realized one of the dearest wishes of my lifeto see you two together

And then he led away the talk to their home in Devonshire and the
red bright earth and the deep green combes and the peat streams like
cairngorm pebbles and the wild moor with its high cloudy tors for a
giant background to the picture till Tom got jealous and stood up for
the clear chalk streams and the emerald water meadows and great elms
and willows of the dear old royal county as he gloried to call it And
the mother sat on quiet and loving rejoicing in their life The quarter
to ten struck and the bell rang for bed before they had well begun
their talk as it seemed

Then Tom rose with a sigh to go

Shall I see you in the morning Geordie said he as he shook his
friends hand Never mind though youll be back next half And I
shant forget the house of Rimmon

Arthurs mother got up and walked with him to the door and there gave
him her hand again and again his eyes met that deep loving look which
was like a spell upon him Her voice trembled slightly as she said
Goodnight You are one who knows what our Father has promised to the
friend of the widow and the fatherless May He deal with you as you have
dealt with me and mine

Tom was quite upset he mumbled something about owing everything good in
him to Geordie looked in her face again pressed her hand to his lips
and rushed downstairs to his study where he sat till old Thomas came
kicking at the door to tell him his allowance would be stopped if he
didnt go off to bed It would have been stopped anyhow but that he
was a great favourite with the old gentleman who loved to come out in
the afternoons into the close to Toms wicket and bowl slow twisters to
him and talk of the glories of bygone Surrey heroes with whom he
had played former generations So Tom roused himself and took up
his candle to go to bed and then for the first time was aware of
a beautiful new fishingrod with old Etons mark on it and a
splendidlybound Bible which lay on his table on the titlepage
of which was writtenTOM BROWN from his affectionate and grateful
friends Frances Jane Arthur George Arthur

I leave you all to guess how he slept and what he dreamt of



CHAPTER VIIHARRY EASTS DILEMMAS AND DELIVERANCES

 The Holy Supper is kept indeed
 In whatso we share with anothers need
 Not that which we give but what we share
 For the gift without the giver is bare
 Who bestows himself with his alms feeds three
 Himself his hungering neighbour and Me
 LOWELL The Vision of Sir Launfal

The next morning after breakfast Tom East and Gower met as usual
to learn their second lesson together Tom had been considering how to
break his proposal of giving up the crib to the others and having found
no better way as indeed none better can ever be found by man or boy
told them simply what had happened how he had been to see Arthur who
had talked to him upon the subject and what he had said and for his
part he had made up his mind and wasnt going to use cribs any more
and not being quite sure of his ground took the high and pathetic tone
and was proceeding to say how that having learnt his lessons with
them for so many years it would grieve him much to put an end to the
arrangement and he hoped at any rate that if they wouldnt go on
with him they should still be just as good friends and respect one
anothers motives but

Here the other boys who had been listening with open eyes and ears
burst in

Stuff and nonsense cried Gower Here East get down the crib and
find the place

O Tommy Tommy said East proceeding to do as he was bidden that it
should ever have come to this I knew Arthurd be the ruin of you some
day and you of me And now the times come And he made a doleful
face

I dont know about ruin answered Tom I know that you and I would
have had the sack long ago if it hadnt been for him And you know it as
well as I

Well we were in a baddish way before he came I own but this new
crotchet of his is past a joke

Lets give it a trial Harry come You know how often he has been
right and we wrong

Now dont you two be jawing away about young Squaretoes struck in
Gower Hes no end of a sucking wiseacre I dare say but weve no time
to lose and Ive got the fives court at halfpast nine

I say Gower said Tom appealingly be a good fellow and lets try
if we cant get on without the crib

What in this chorus Why we shant get through ten lines

I say Tom cried East having hit on a new idea dont you remember
when we were in the upper fourth and old Momus caught me construing
off the leaf of a crib which Id torn out and put in my book and which
would float out on to the floor he sent me up to be flogged for it

Yes I remember it very well

Well the Doctor after hed flogged me told me himself that he didnt
flog me for using a translation but for taking it in to lesson and
using it there when I hadnt learnt a word before I came in He said
there was no harm in using a translation to get a clue to hard passages
if you tried all you could first to make them out without

Did he though said Tom then Arthur must be wrong

Of course he is said Gowerthe little prig Well only use the crib
when we cant construe without itGo ahead East

And on this agreement they startedTom satisfied with having made his
confession and not sorry to have a locus penitentiae and not to be
deprived altogether of the use of his old and faithful friend

The boys went on as usual each taking a sentence in turn and the crib
being handed to the one whose turn it was to construe Of course
Tom couldnt object to this as was it not simply lying there to be
appealed to in case the sentence should prove too hard altogether for
the construer But it must be owned that Gower and East did not make
very tremendous exertions to conquer their sentences before having
recourse to its help Tom however with the most heroic virtue and
gallantry rushed into his sentence searching in a highminded manner
for nominative and verb and turning over his dictionary frantically for
the first hard word that stopped him But in the meantime Gower who
was bent on getting to fives would peep quietly into the crib and then
suggest Dont you think this is the meaning I think you must take
it this way Brown And as Tom didnt see his way to not profiting by
these suggestions the lesson went on about as quickly as usual and
Gower was able to start for the fives court within five minutes of the
halfhour

When Tom and East were left face to face they looked at one another for
a minute Tom puzzled and East chokefull of fun and then burst into a
roar of laughter

Well Tom said East recovering himself I don t see any objection
to the new way Its about as good as the old one I think besides the
advantage it gives one of feeling virtuous and looking down on ones
neighbours

Tom shoved his hand into his back hair I aint so sure said he you
two fellows carried me off my legs I dont think we really tried one
sentence fairly Are you sure you remember what the Doctor said to you

Yes And Ill swear I couldnt make out one of my sentences todayno
nor ever could I really dont remember said East speaking slowly and
impressively to have come across one Latin or Greek sentence this half
that I could go and construe by the light of nature Whereby I am sure
Providence intended cribs to be used

The thing to find out said Tom meditatively is how long one ought
to grind at a sentence without looking at the crib Now I think if one
fairly looks out all the words one dont know and then cant hit it
thats enough

To be sure Tommy said East demurely but with a merry twinkle in his
eye Your new doctrine too old fellow added he when one comes to
think of it is a cutting at the root of all school morality Youll
take away mutual help brotherly love or in the vulgar tongue giving
construes which I hold to be one of our highest virtues For how can
you distinguish between getting a construe from another boy and using a
crib Hang it Tom if youre going to deprive all our schoolfellows
of the chance of exercising Christian benevolence and being good
Samaritans I shall cut the concern

I wish you wouldnt joke about it Harry its hard enough to see ones
waya precious sight harder than I thought last night But I suppose
theres a use and an abuse of both and onell get straight enough
somehow But you cant make out anyhow that one has a right to use old
vulgusbooks and copybooks

Hullo more heresy How fast a fellow goes downhill when he once gets
his head before his legs Listen to me Tom Not use old vulgusbooks
Why you Goth aint we to take the benefit of the wisdom and admire and
use the work of past generations Not use old copybooks Why you
might as well say we ought to pull down Westminster Abbey and put up a
gotomeeting shop with churchwarden windows or never read Shakespeare
but only Sheridan Knowles Think of all the work and labour that our
predecessors have bestowed on these very books and are we to make their
work of no value

I say Harry please dont chaff Im really serious

And then is it not our duty to consult the pleasure of others rather
than our own and above all that of our masters Fancy then the
difference to them in looking over a vulgus which has been carefully
touched and retouched by themselves and others and which must bring
them a sort of dreamy pleasure as if theyd met the thought
or expression of it somewhere or anotherbefore they were born
perhapsand that of cutting up and making pictureframes round all
your and my false quantities and other monstrosities Why Tom you
wouldnt be so cruel as never to let old Momus hum over the O genus
humanum again and then look up doubtingly through his spectacles and
end by smiling and giving three extra marks for itjust for old sakes
sake I suppose

Well said Tom getting up in something as like a huff as he was
capable of its deuced hard that when a fellows really trying to do
what he ought his best friendsll do nothing but chaff him and try to
put him down And he stuck his books under his arm and his hat on his
head preparatory to rushing out into the quadrangle to testify with
his own soul of the faithlessness of friendships

Now dont be an ass Tom said East catching hold of him you know
me well enough by this time my barks worse than my bite You cant
expect to ride your new crotchet without anybodys trying to stick a
nettle under his tail and make him kick you offespecially as we shall
all have to go on foot still But now sit down and lets go over it
again Ill be as serious as a judge

Then Tom sat himself down on the table and waxed eloquent about all the
righteousnesses and advantages of the new plan as was his wont whenever
he took up anything going into it as if his life depended upon it and
sparing no abuse which he could think of of the opposite method which
he denounced as ungentlemanly cowardly mean lying and no one knows
what besides Very cool of Tom as East thought but didnt say
seeing as how he only came out of Egypt himself last night at bedtime

Well Tom said he at last you see when you and I came to school
there were none of these sort of notions You may be rightI dare say
you are Only what one has always felt about the masters is that its
a fair trial of skill and last between us and themlike a match at
football or a battle Were natural enemies in schoolthats the fact
Weve got to learn so much Latin and Greek and do so many verses and
theyve got to see that we do it If we can slip the collar and do so
much less without getting caught thats one to us If they can get more
out of us or catch us shirking thats one to them Alls fair in war
but lying If I run my luck against theirs and go into school without
looking at my lessons and dont get called up why am I a snob or a
sneak I dont tell the master Ive learnt it Hes got to find out
whether I have or not Whats he paid for If he calls me up and I get
floored he makes me write it out in Greek and English Very good Hes
caught me and I dont grumble I grant you if I go and snivel to him
and tell him Ive really tried to learn it but found it so hard without
a translation or say Ive had a toothache or any humbug of that kind
Im a snob Thats my school morality its served me and you too Tom
for the matter of that these five years And its all clear and fair
no mistake about it We understand it and they understand it and I
dont know what were to come to with any other

Tom looked at him pleased and a little puzzled He had never heard
East speak his mind seriously before and couldnt help feeling how
completely he had hit his own theory and practice up to that time

Thank you old fellow said he Youre a good old brick to be
serious and not put out with me I said more than I meant I dare say
only you see I know Im right Whatever you and Gower and the rest do I
shall hold on I must And as its all new and an uphill game you see
one must hit hard and hold on tight at first

Very good said East hold on and hit away only dont hit under the
line

But I must bring you over Harry or I shant be comfortable Now Ill
allow all youve said Weve always been honourable enemies with the
masters We found a state of war when we came and went into it of
course Only dont you think things are altered a good deal I dont
feel as I used to the masters They seem to me to treat one quite
differently

Yes perhaps they do said East theres a new set you see mostly
who dont feel sure of themselves yet They dont want to fight till
they know the ground

I dont think its only that said Tom And then the Doctor he does
treat one so openly and like a gentleman and as if one was working
with him

Well so he does said East hes a splendid fellow and when I get
into the sixth I shall act accordingly Only you know he has nothing to
do with our lessons now except examining us I say though looking at
his watch its just the quarter Come along

As they walked out they got a message to say that Arthur was just
starting and would like to say goodbye So they went down to the
private entrance of the Schoolhouse and found an open carriage
with Arthur propped up with pillows in it looking already better Tom
thought

They jumped up on to the steps to shake hands with him and Tom mumbled
thanks for the presents he had found in his study and looked round
anxiously for Arthurs mother

East who had fallen back into his usual humour looked quaintly at
Arthur and said

So youve been at it again through that hotheaded convert of yours
there Hes been making our lives a burden to us all the morning about
using cribs I shall get floored to a certainty at second lesson if Im
called up

Arthur blushed and looked down Tom struck in

Oh its all right Hes converted already he always comes through the
mud after us grumbling and sputtering

The clock struck and they had to go off to school wishing Arthur a
pleasant holiday Tom lingering behind a moment to send his thanks and
love to Arthurs mother

Tom renewed the discussion after second lesson and succeeded so far as
to get East to promise to give the new plan a fair trial

Encouraged by his success in the evening when they were sitting alone
in the large study where East lived now almost vice Arthur on leave
after examining the new fishingrod which both pronounced to be the
genuine article play enough to throw a midge tied on a single
hair against the wind and strength enough to hold a grampus they
naturally began talking about Arthur Tom who was still bubbling over
with last nights scene and all the thoughts of the last week and
wanting to clinch and fix the whole in his own mind which he could
never do without first going through the process of belabouring somebody
else with it all suddenly rushed into the subject of Arthurs illness
and what he had said about death

East had given him the desired opening After a seriocomic grumble
that life wasnt worth having now they were tied to a young beggar
who was always raising his standard and that he East was like a
prophets donkey who was obliged to struggle on after the donkeyman
who went after the prophet that he had none of the pleasure of starting
the new crotchets and didnt half understand them but had to take the
kicks and carry the luggage as if he had all the fun he threw his legs
up on to the sofa and put his hands behind his head and said

Well after all hes the most wonderful little fellow I ever came
across There aint such a meek humble boy in the school Hanged if
I dont think now really Tom that he believes himself a much worse
fellow than you or I and that he dont think he has more influence in
the house than Dot Bowles who came last quarter and isnt ten yet But
he turns you and me round his little finger old boytheres no mistake
about that And East nodded at Tom sagaciously

Now or never thought Tom so shutting his eyes and hardening his
heart he went straight at it repeating all that Arthur had said as
near as he could remember it in the very words and all he had himself
thought The life seemed to ooze out of it as he went on and several
times he felt inclined to stop give it all up and change the subject
But somehow he was borne on he had a necessity upon him to speak it all
out and did so At the end he looked at East with some anxiety and was
delighted to see that that young gentleman was thoughtful and attentive
The fact is that in the stage of his inner life at which Tom had lately
arrived his intimacy with and friendship for East could not have lasted
if he had not made him aware of and a sharer in the thoughts that were
beginning to exercise him Nor indeed could the friendship have lasted
if East had shown no sympathy with these thoughts so that it was a
great relief to have unbosomed himself and to have found that his
friend could listen

Tom had always had a sort of instinct that Easts levity was only
skindeep and this instinct was a true one East had no want of
reverence for anything he felt to be real but his was one of those
natures that burst into what is generally called recklessness and
impiety the moment they feel that anything is being poured upon them for
their good which does not come home to their inborn sense of right or
which appeals to anything like selfinterest in them Daring and
honest by nature and outspoken to an extent which alarmed all
respectabilities with a constant fund of animal health and spirits
which he did not feel bound to curb in any way he had gained for
himself with the steady part of the school including as well those who
wished to appear steady as those who really were so the character of a
boy with whom it would be dangerous to be intimate while his own hatred
of everything cruel or underhand or false and his hearty respect for
what he would see to be good and true kept off the rest

Tom besides being very like East in many points of character had
largely developed in his composition the capacity for taking the weakest
side This is not putting it strongly enough it was a necessity with
him he couldnt help it any more than he could eating or drinking He
could never play on the strongest side with any heart at football or
cricket and was sure to make friends with any boy who was unpopular or
down on his luck

Now though East was not what is generally called unpopular Tom felt
more and more every day as their characters developed that he
stood alone and did not make friends among their contemporaries and
therefore sought him out Tom was himself much more popular for his
power of detecting humbug was much less acute and his instincts were
much more sociable He was at this period of his life too largely
given to taking people for what they gave themselves out to be but
his singleness of heart fearlessness and honesty were just what East
appreciated and thus the two had been drawn into great intimacy

This intimacy had not been interrupted by Toms guardianship of Arthur

East had often as has been said joined them in reading the Bible but
their discussions had almost always turned upon the characters of the
men and women of whom they read and not become personal to themselves
In fact the two had shrunk from personal religious discussion not
knowing how it might end and fearful of risking a friendship very dear
to both and which they felt somehow without quite knowing why
would never be the same but either tenfold stronger or sapped at its
foundation after such a communing together

What a bother all this explaining is I wish we could get on without
it But we cant However youll all find if you havent found it out
already that a time comes in every human friendship when you must go
down into the depths of yourself and lay bare what is there to your
friend and wait in fear for his answer A few moments may do it and
it may be most likely will be as you are English boys that you will
never do it but once But done it must be if the friendship is to be
worth the name You must find what is there at the very root and bottom
of one anothers hearts and if you are at one there nothing on earth
can or at least ought to sunder you

East had remained lying down until Tom finished speaking as if fearing
to interrupt him he now sat up at the table and leant his head on one
hand taking up a pencil with the other and working little holes with
it in the tablecover After a bit he looked up stopped the pencil
and said Thank you very much old fellow Theres no other boy in
the house would have done it for me but you or Arthur I can see well
enough he went on after a pause all the best big fellows look on me
with suspicion they think Im a devilmaycare reckless young scamp
So I ameleven hours out of twelve but not the twelfth Then all of
our contemporaries worth knowing follow suit of course were very good
friends at games and all that but not a soul of them but you and
Arthur ever tried to break through the crust and see whether there was
anything at the bottom of me and then the bad ones I wont stand and
they know that

Dont you think thats half fancy Harry

Not a bit of it said East bitterly pegging away with his pencil
I see it all plain enough Bless you you think everybodys as
straightforward and kindhearted as you are

Well but whats the reason of it There must be a reason You can play
all the games as well as any one and sing the best song and are the
best company in the house You fancy youre not liked Harry Its all
fancy

I only wish it was Tom I know I could be popular enough with all the
bad ones but that I wont have and the good ones wont have me

Why not persisted Tom you dont drink or swear or get out at
night you never bully or cheat at lessons If you only showed you
liked it youd have all the best fellows in the house running after
you

Not I said East Then with an effort he went on Ill tell you what
it is I never stop the Sacrament I can see from the Doctor downwards
how that tells against me

Yes Ive seen that said Tom and Ive been very sorry for it and
Arthur and I have talked about it Ive often thought of speaking to
you but its so hard to begin on such subjects Im very glad youve
opened it Now why dont you

Ive never been confirmed said East

Not been confirmed said Tom in astonishment I never thought of
that Why werent you confirmed with the rest of us nearly three years
ago I always thought youd been confirmed at home

No answered East sorrowfully you see this was how it happened Last
Confirmation was soon after Arthur came and you were so taken up with
him I hardly saw either of you Well when the Doctor sent round for us
about it I was living mostly with Greens set You know the sort They
all went in I dare say it was all right and they got good by it I
dont want to judge them Only all I could see of their reasons drove me
just the other way Twas because the Doctor liked it no boy got
on who didnt stay the Sacrament it was the correct thing in fact
like having a good hat to wear on Sundays I couldnt stand it I didnt
feel that I wanted to lead a different life I was very well content
as I was and I wasnt going to sham religious to curry favour with the
Doctor or any one else

East stopped speaking and pegged away more diligently than ever with
his pencil Tom was ready to cry He felt half sorry at first that he
had been confirmed himself He seemed to have deserted his earliest
friendto have left him by himself at his worst need for those long
years He got up and went and sat by East and put his arm over his
shoulder

Dear old boy he said how careless and selfish Ive been But why
didnt you come and talk to Arthur and me

I wish to Heaven I had said East but I was a fool Its too late
talking of it now

Why too late You want to be confirmed now dont you

I think so said East Ive thought about it a good deal only often
I fancy I must be changing because I see its to do me good herejust
what stopped me last time And then I go back again

Ill tell you now how twas with me said Tom warmly If it hadnt
been for Arthur I should have done just as you did I hope I should I
honour you for it But then he made it out just as if it was taking the
weak side before all the worldgoing in once for all against everything
thats strong and rich and proud and respectable a little band of
brothers against the whole world And the Doctor seemed to say so too
only he said a great deal more

Ah groaned East but there again thats just another of my
difficulties whenever I think about the matter I dont want to be one
of your saints one of your elect whatever the right phrase is My
sympathies are all the other waywith the many the poor devils who run
about the streets and dont go to church Dont stare Tom mind Im
telling you all thats in my heartas far as I know itbut its all a
muddle You must be gentle with me if you want to land me Now Ive seen
a deal of this sort of religion I was bred up in it and I cant stand
it If nineteentwentieths of the world are to be left to uncovenanted
mercies and that sort of thing which means in plain English to go to
hell and the other twentieth are to rejoice at it all why

Oh but Harry they aint they dont broke in Tom really shocked
Oh how I wish Arthur hadnt gone Im such a fool about these things
But its all you want too East it is indeed It cuts both ways
somehow being confirmed and taking the Sacrament It makes you feel on
the side of all the good and all the bad too of everybody in the world
Only theres some great dark strong power which is crushing you and
everybody else Thats what Christ conquered and weve got to fight
What a fool I am I cant explain If Arthur were only here

I begin to get a glimmering of what you mean said East

I say now said Tom eagerly do you remember how we both hated
Flashman

Of course I do said East I hate him still What then

Well when I came to take the Sacrament I had a great struggle about
that I tried to put him out of my head and when I couldnt do that I
tried to think of him as evilas something that the Lord who was loving
me hated and which I might hate too But it wouldnt do I broke down
I believe Christ Himself broke me down And when the Doctor gave me the
bread and wine and leant over me praying I prayed for poor Flashman
as if it had been you or Arthur

East buried his face in his hands on the table Tom could feel the table
tremble At last he looked up Thank you again Tom said he you
dont know what you may have done for me tonight I think I see now how
the right sort of sympathy with poor devils is got at

And youll stop the Sacrament next time wont you said Tom

Can I before Im confirmed

Go and ask the Doctor

I will

That very night after prayers East followed the Doctor and the old
verger bearing the candle upstairs Tom watched and saw the Doctor
turn round when he heard footsteps following him closer than usual and
say Hah East Do you want to speak to me my man

If you please sir And the private door closed and Tom went to his
study in a state of great trouble of mind

It was almost an hour before East came back Then he rushed in
breathless

Well its all right he shouted seizing Tom by the hand I feel as
if a ton weight were off my mind

Hurrah said Tom I knew it would be but tell us all about it

Well I just told him all about it You cant think how kind and gentle
he was the great grim man whom Ive feared more than anybody on earth
When I stuck he lifted me just as if Id been a little child And he
seemed to know all Id felt and to have gone through it all And I
burst out cryingmore than Ive done this five years and he sat down
by me and stroked my head and I went blundering on and told him
allmuch worse things than Ive told you And he wasnt shocked a bit
and didnt snub me or tell me I was a fool and it was all nothing but
pride or wickedness though I dare say it was And he didnt tell me
not to follow out my thoughts and he didnt give me any cutanddried
explanation But when Id done he just talked a bit I can hardly
remember what he said yet but it seemed to spread round me like
healing and strength and light and to bear me up and plant me on a
rock where I could hold my footing and fight for myself I dont know
what to do I feel so happy And its all owing to you dear old boy
And he seized Toms hand again

And youre to come to the Communion said Tom

Yes and to be confirmed in the holidays

Toms delight was as great as his friends But he hadnt yet had
out all his own talk and was bent on improving the occasion so he
proceeded to propound Arthurs theory about not being sorry for his
friends deaths which he had hitherto kept in the background and by
which he was much exercised for he didnt feel it honest to take what
pleased him and throw over the rest and was trying vigorously to
persuade himself that he should like all his best friends to die
offhand

But Easts powers of remaining serious were exhausted and in five
minutes he was saying the most ridiculous things he could think of till
Tom was almost getting angry again

Despite of himself however he couldnt help laughing and giving it up
when East appealed to him with Well Tom you aint going to punch my
head I hope because I insist upon being sorry when you got to earth

And so their talk finished for that time and they tried to learn first
lesson with very poor success as appeared next morning when they were
called up and narrowly escaped being floored which illluck however
did not sit heavily on either of their souls



CHAPTER VIIITOM BROWNS LAST MATCH

 Heaven grant the manlier heart that timely ere
 Youth fly with lifes real tempest would be coping
 The fruit of dreamy hoping
 Is waking blank despairCLOUGH Ambarvalia

The curtain now rises upon the last act of our little drama for
hardhearted publishers warn me that a single volume must of necessity
have an end Well well the pleasantest things must come to an end
I little thought last long vacation when I began these pages to help
while away some spare time at a wateringplace how vividly many an old
scene which had lain hid away for years in some dusty old corner of my
brain would come back again and stand before me as clear and bright as
if it had happened yesterday The book has been a most grateful task
to me and I only hope that all you my dear young friends who read it
friends assuredly you must be if you get as far as this will be half
as sorry to come to the last stage as I am

Not but what there has been a solemn and a sad side to it As the old
scenes became living and the actors in them became living too many
a grave in the Crimea and distant India as well as in the quiet
churchyards of our dear old country seemed to open and send forth their
dead and their voices and looks and ways were again in ones ears and
eyes as in the old Schooldays But this was not sad How should it be
if we believe as our Lord has taught us How should it be when one more
turn of the wheel and we shall be by their sides again learning from
them again perhaps as we did when we were new boys

Then there were others of the old faces so dear to us once who had
somehow or another just gone clean out of sight Are they dead or
living We know not but the thought of them brings no sadness with it
Wherever they are we can well believe they are doing Gods work and
getting His wages

But are there not some whom we still see sometimes in the streets
whose haunts and homes we know whom we could probably find almost any
day in the week if we were set to do it yet from whom we are really
farther than we are from the dead and from those who have gone out of
our ken Yes there are and must be such and therein lies the sadness
of old School memories Yet of these our old comrades from whom more
than time and space separate us there are some by whose sides we can
feel sure that we shall stand again when time shall be no more We may
think of one another now as dangerous fanatics or narrow bigots with
whom no truce is possible from whom we shall only sever more and more
to the end of our lives whom it would be our respective duties to
imprison or hang if we had the power We must go our way and they
theirs as long as flesh and spirit hold together but let our own Rugby
poet speak words of healing for this trial

 To veer how vain on onward strain
 Brave barks in light in darkness too
 Through winds and tides one compass guides
 To that and your own selves be true

 But O blithe breeze and O great seas
 Though neer that earliest parting past
 On your wide plain they join again
 Together lead them home at last

 One port methought alike they sought
 One purpose hold whereer they fare
 O bounding breeze O rushing seas
 At last at last unite them there 


  Clough Ambarvalia

This is not mere longing it is prophecy So over these too our old
friends who are friends no more we sorrow not as men without hope It
is only for those who seem to us to have lost compass and purpose and
to be driven helplessly on rocks and quicksands whose lives are spent
in the service of the world the flesh and the devil for self alone
and not for their fellowmen their country or their God that we must
mourn and pray without sure hope and without light trusting only that
He in whose hands they as well as we are who has died for them as well
as for us who sees all His creatures

 With larger other eyes than ours
 To make allowance for us all

will in His own way and at His own time lead them also home

Another two years have passed and it is again the end of the summer
halfyear at Rugby in fact the School has broken up The fifthform
examinations were over last week and upon them have followed the
speeches and the sixthform examinations for exhibitions and they too
are over now The boys have gone to all the winds of heaven except the
town boys and the eleven and the few enthusiasts besides who have asked
leave to stay in their houses to see the result of the cricket matches
For this year the Wellesburn return match and the Marylebone match are
played at Rugby to the great delight of the town and neighbourhood and
the sorrow of those aspiring young cricketers who have been reckoning
for the last three months on showing off at Lords ground

The Doctor started for the Lakes yesterday morning after an interview
with the captain of the eleven in the presence of Thomas at which he
arranged in what school the cricket dinners were to be and all other
matters necessary for the satisfactory carrying out of the festivities
and warned them as to keeping all spirituous liquors out of the close
and having the gates closed by nine oclock

The Wellesburn match was played out with great success yesterday the
School winning by three wickets and today the great event of the
cricketing year the Marylebone match is being played What a match it
has been The London eleven came down by an afternoon train yesterday
in time to see the end of the Wellesburn match and as soon as it was
over their leading men and umpire inspected the ground criticising it
rather unmercifully The captain of the School eleven and one or
two others who had played the Lords match before and knew old Mr
Aislabie and several of the Lords men accompanied them while the rest
of the eleven looked on from under the Three Trees with admiring eyes
and asked one another the names of the illustrious strangers and
recounted how many runs each of them had made in the late matches in
Bells Life They looked such hardbitten wiry whiskered fellows that
their young adversaries felt rather desponding as to the result of the
morrows match The ground was at last chosen and two men set to work
upon it to water and roll and then there being yet some halfhour of
daylight some one had suggested a dance on the turf The close was
half full of citizens and their families and the idea was hailed
with enthusiasm The cornopean player was still on the ground In five
minutes the eleven and half a dozen of the Wellesburn and Marylebone men
got partners somehow or another and a merry countrydance was going on
to which every one flocked and new couples joined in every minute till
there were a hundred of them going down the middle and up again and the
long line of school buildings looked gravely down on them every window
glowing with the last rays of the western sun and the rooks clanged
about in the tops of the old elms greatly excited and resolved on
having their countrydance too and the great flag flapped lazily in the
gentle western breeze Altogether it was a sight which would have made
glad the heart of our brave old founder Lawrence Sheriff if he were
half as good a fellow as I take him to have been It was a cheerful
sight to see But what made it so valuable in the sight of the captain
of the School eleven was that he there saw his young hands shaking
off their shyness and awe of the Lords men as they crossed hands and
capered about on the grass together for the strangers entered into
it all and threw away their cigars and danced and shouted like boys
while old Mr Aislabie stood by looking on in his white hat leaning on
a bat in benevolent enjoyment This hop will be worth thirty runs to
us tomorrow and will be the making of Raggles and Johnson thinks the
young leader as he revolves many things in his mind standing by the
side of Mr Aislabie whom he will not leave for a minute for he
feels that the character of the School for courtesy is resting on his
shoulders

But when a quarter to nine struck and he saw old Thomas beginning
to fidget about with the keys in his hand he thought of the Doctors
parting monition and stopped the cornopean at once notwithstanding the
loudvoiced remonstrances from all sides and the crowd scattered away
from the close the eleven all going into the Schoolhouse where supper
and beds were provided for them by the Doctors orders

Deep had been the consultations at supper as to the order of going in
who should bowl the first over whether it would be best to play steady
or freely and the youngest hands declared that they shouldnt be a
bit nervous and praised their opponents as the jolliest fellows in the
world except perhaps their old friends the Wellesburn men How far
a little goodnature from their elders will go with the right sort of
boys

The morning had dawned bright and warm to the intense relief of many
an anxious youngster up betimes to mark the signs of the weather The
eleven went down in a body before breakfast for a plunge in the cold
bath in a corner of the close The ground was in splendid order and
soon after ten oclock before spectators had arrived all was ready
and two of the Lords men took their places at the wicketsthe School
with the usual liberality of young hands having put their adversaries
in first Old Bailey stepped up to the wicket and called play and the
match has begun

Oh well bowled well bowled Johnson cries the captain catching
up the ball and sending it high above the rook trees while the third
Marylebone man walks away from the wicket and old Bailey gravely sets
up the middle stump again and puts the bails on

How many runs Away scamper three boys to the scoring table and are
back again in a minute amongst the rest of the eleven who are collected
together in a knot between wicket Only eighteen runs and three
wickets down Huzza for old Rugby sings out Jack Raggles the
longstop toughest and burliest of boys commonly called Swiper Jack
and forthwith stands on his head and brandishes his legs in the air
in triumph till the next boy catches hold of his heels and throws him
over on to his back

Steady there dont be such an ass Jack says the captain we
havent got the best wicket yet Ah look out now at coverpoint adds
he as he sees a longarmed bareheaded slashinglooking player coming
to the wicket And Jack mind your hits He steals more runs than any
man in England

And they all find that they have got their work to do now The
newcomers offhitting is tremendous and his running like a flash of
lightning He is never in his ground except when his wicket is down
Nothing in the whole game so trying to boys He has stolen three byes in
the first ten minutes and Jack Raggles is furious and begins throwing
over savagely to the farther wicket until he is sternly stopped by the
captain It is all that young gentlemen can do to keep his team steady
but he knows that everything depends on it and faces his work bravely
The score creeps up to fifty the boys begin to look blank and the
spectators who are now mustering strong are very silent The ball
flies off his bat to all parts of the field and he gives no rest and
no catches to any one But cricket is full of glorious chances and
the goddess who presides over it loves to bring down the most skilful
players Johnson the young bowler is getting wild and bowls a ball
almost wide to the off the batter steps out and cuts it beautifully to
where coverpoint is standing very deepin fact almost off the ground
The ball comes skimming and twisting along about three feet from the
ground he rushes at it and it sticks somehow or other in the fingers
of his left hand to the utter astonishment of himself and the whole
field Such a catch hasnt been made in the close for years and the
cheering is maddening Pretty cricket says the captain throwing
himself on the ground by the deserted wicket with a long breath He
feels that a crisis has passed

I wish I had space to describe the matchhow the captain stumped the
next man off a legshooter and bowled small cobs to old Mr Aislabie
who came in for the last wicket how the Lords men were out by
halfpast twelve oclock for ninetyeight runs how the captain of
the School eleven went in first to give his men pluck and scored
twentyfive in beautiful style how Rugby was only four behind in
the first innings what a glorious dinner they had in the fourthform
school and how the coverpoint hitter sang the most topping comic
songs and old Mr Aislabie made the best speeches that ever were heard
afterwards But I havent spacethats the fact and so you must fancy
it all and carry yourselves on to halfpast seven oclock when the
School are again in with five wickets down and only thirtytwo runs
to make to win The Marylebone men played carelessly in their second
innings but they are working like horses now to save the match

There is much healthy hearty happy life scattered up and down the
close but the group to which I beg to call your especial attention
is there on the slope of the island which looks towards the
cricketground It consists of three figures two are seated on a bench
and one on the ground at their feet The first a tall slight and
rather gaunt man with a bushy eyebrow and a dry humorous smile is
evidently a clergyman He is carelessly dressed and looks rather used
up which isnt much to be wondered at seeing that he has just finished
six weeks of examination work but there he basks and spreads himself
out in the evening sun bent on enjoying life though he doesnt quite
know what to do with his arms and legs Surely it is our friend the
young master whom we have had glimpses of before but his face has
gained a great deal since we last came across him

And by his side in white flannel shirt and trousers straw hat the
captains belt and the untanned yellow cricket shoes which all the
eleven wear sits a strapping figure near six feet high with ruddy
tanned face and whiskers curly brown hair and a laughing dancing eye
He is leaning forward with his elbows resting on his knees and dandling
his favourite bat with which he has made thirty or forty runs today
in his strong brown hands It is Tom Brown grown into a young man
nineteen years old a praepostor and captain of the eleven spending
his last day as a Rugby boy and let us hope as much wiser as he is
bigger since we last had the pleasure of coming across him

And at their feet on the warm dry ground similarly dressed sits
Arthur Turkish fashion with his bat across his knees He too is no
longer a boyless of a boy in fact than Tom if one may judge from
the thoughtfulness of his face which is somewhat paler too than one
could wish but his figure though slight is well knit and active and
all his old timidity has disappeared and is replaced by silent quaint
fun with which his face twinkles all over as he listens to the broken
talk between the other two in which he joins every now and then

All three are watching the game eagerly and joining in the cheering
which follows every good hit It is pleasing to see the easy friendly
footing which the pupils are on with their master perfectly respectful
yet with no reserve and nothing forced in their intercourse Tom has
clearly abandoned the old theory of natural enemies in this case at
any rate

But it is time to listen to what they are saying and see what we can
gather out of it

I dont object to your theory says the master and I allow you have
made a fair case for yourself But now in such books as Aristophanes
for instance youve been reading a play this half with the Doctor
havent you

Yes the Knights answered Tom

Well Im sure you would have enjoyed the wonderful humour of it twice
as much if you had taken more pains with your scholarship

Well sir I dont believe any boy in the form enjoyed the setsto
between Cleon and the Sausageseller more than I dideh Arthur said
Tom giving him a stir with his foot

Yes I must say he did said Arthur I think sir youve hit upon
the wrong book there

Not a bit of it said the master Why in those very passages of
arms how can you thoroughly appreciate them unless you are master of
the weapons and the weapons are the language which you Brown have
never half worked at and so as I say you must have lost all the
delicate shades of meaning which make the best part of the fun

Oh well played bravo Johnson shouted Arthur dropping his bat and
clapping furiously and Tom joined in with a Bravo Johnson which
might have been heard at the chapel

Eh what was it I didnt see inquired the master They only got one
run I thought

No but such a ball threequarters length and coming straight for his
leg bail Nothing but that turn of the wrist could have saved him and
he drew it away to leg for a safe oneBravo Johnson

How well they are bowling though said Arthur they dont mean to be
beat I can see

There now struck in the master you see thats just what I have been
preaching this halfhour The delicate play is the true thing I dont
understand cricket so I dont enjoy those fine draws which you tell me
are the best play though when you or Raggles hit a ball hard away for
six I am as delighted as any one Dont you see the analogy

Yes sir answered Tom looking up roguishly I see only the
question remains whether I should have got most good by understanding
Greek particles or cricket thoroughly Im such a thick I never should
have had time for both

I see you are an incorrigible said the master with a chuckle but
I refute you by an example Arthur there has taken in Greek and cricket
too

Yes but no thanks to him Greek came natural to him Why when he
first came I remember he used to read Herodotus for pleasure as I did
Don Quixote and couldnt have made a false concord if hed tried ever
so hard and then I looked after his cricket

Out Bailey has given him out Do you see Tom cries Arthur How
foolish of them to run so hard

Well it cant be helped he has played very well Whose turn is it to
go in

I dont know theyve got your list in the tent

Lets go and see said Tom rising but at this moment Jack Raggles
and two or three more came running to the island moat

O Brown maynt I go in next shouts the Swiper

Whose name is next on the list says the captain

Winters and then Arthurs answers the boy who carries it but
there are only twentysix runs to get and no time to lose I heard
Mr Aislabie say that the stumps must be drawn at a quarter past eight
exactly

Oh do let the Swiper go in chorus the boys so Tom yields against
his better judgment

I dare say now Ive lost the match by this nonsense he says as he
sits down again theyll be sure to get Jacks wicket in three or four
minutes however youll have the chance sir of seeing a hard hit or
two adds he smiling and turning to the master

Come none of your irony Brown answers the master Im beginning to
understand the game scientifically What a noble game it is too

Isnt it But its more than a game Its an institution said Tom

Yes said Arthurthe birthright of British boys old and young as
habeas corpus and trial by jury are of British men

The discipline and reliance on one another which it teaches is
so valuable I think went on the master it ought to be such an
unselfish game It merges the individual in the eleven he doesnt play
that he may win but that his side may

Thats very true said Tom and thats why football and cricket
now one comes to think of it are such much better games than fives or
hareandhounds or any others where the object is to come in first or
to win for oneself and not that ones side may win

And then the captain of the eleven said the master what a post is
his in our Schoolworld almost as hard as the Doctorsrequiring skill
and gentleness and firmness and I know not what other rare qualities

Which dont he may wish he may get said Tom laughing at any rate
he hasnt got them yet or he wouldnt have been such a flat tonight as
to let Jack Raggles go in out of his turn

Ah the Doctor never would have done that said Arthur demurely Tom
youve a great deal to learn yet in the art of ruling

Well I wish youd tell the Doctor so then and get him to let me stop
till Im twenty I dont want to leave Im sure

What a sight it is broke in the master the Doctor as a ruler
Perhaps ours is the only little corner of the British Empire which
is thoroughly wisely and strongly ruled just now Im more and more
thankful every day of my life that I came here to be under him

So am I Im sure said Tom and more and more sorry that Ive got to
leave

Every place and thing one sees here reminds one of some wise act of
his went on the master This island nowyou remember the time
Brown when it was laid out in small gardens and cultivated by
frostbitten fags in February and March

Of course I do said Tom didnt I hate spending two hours in the
afternoon grubbing in the tough dirt with the stump of a fives bat But
turfcart was good fun enough

I dare say it was but it was always leading to fights with the
townspeople and then the stealing flowers out of all the gardens in
Rugby for the Easter show was abominable

Well so it was said Tom looking down but we fags couldnt help
ourselves But what has that to do with the Doctors ruling

A great deal I think said the master what brought islandfagging
to an end

Why the Easter speeches were put off till midsummer said Tom and
the sixth had the gymnastic poles put up here

Well and who changed the time of the speeches and put the idea of
gymnastic poles into the heads of their worships the sixth form said
the master

The Doctor I suppose said Tom I never thought of that

Of course you didnt said the master or else fag as you were
you would have shouted with the whole school against putting down old
customs And thats the way that all the Doctors reforms have been
carried out when he has been left to himselfquietly and naturally
putting a good thing in the place of a bad and letting the bad die out
no wavering and no hurrythe best thing that could be done for the
time being and patience for the rest

Just Toms own way chimed in Arthur nudging Tom with his
elbowdriving a nail where it will go to which allusion Tom answered
by a sly kick

Exactly so said the master innocent of the allusion and byplay

Meantime Jack Raggles with his sleeves tucked up above his great brown
elbows scorning pads and gloves has presented himself at the wicket
and having run one for a forward drive of Johnsons is about to receive
his first ball There are only twentyfour runs to make and four
wickets to go downa winning match if they play decently steady The
ball is a very swift one and rises fast catching Jack on the outside
of the thigh and bounding away as if from indiarubber while they
run two for a legbye amidst great applause and shouts from Jacks many
admirers The next ball is a beautifullypitched ball for the outer
stump which the reckless and unfeeling Jack catches hold of and hits
right round to leg for five while the applause becomes deafening Only
seventeen runs to get with four wickets The game is all but ours

It is over now and Jack walks swaggering about his wicket with his bat
over his shoulder while Mr Aislabie holds a short parley with his
men Then the coverpoint hitter that cunning man goes on to bowl slow
twisters Jack waves his hand triumphantly towards the tent as much as
to say See if I dont finish it all off now in three hits

Alas my son Jack the enemy is too old for thee The first ball of the
over Jack steps out and meets swiping with all his force If he had
only allowed for the twist But he hasnt and so the ball goes spinning
up straight in the air as if it would never come down again Away runs
Jack shouting and trusting to the chapter of accidents but the bowler
runs steadily under it judging every spin and calling out I have
it catches it and playfully pitches it on to the back of the stalwart
Jack who is departing with a rueful countenance

I knew how it would be says Tom rising Come along the games
getting very serious

So they leave the island and go to the tent and after deep
consultation Arthur is sent in and goes off to the wicket with a last
exhortation from Tom to play steady and keep his bat straight To the
suggestions that Winter is the best bat left Tom only replies Arthur
is the steadiest and Johnson will make the runs if the wicket is only
kept up

I am surprised to see Arthur in the eleven said the master as they
stood together in front of the dense crowd which was now closing in
round the ground

Well Im not quite sure that he ought to be in for his play said
Tom but I couldnt help putting him in It will do him so much good
and you cant think what I owe him

The master smiled The clock strikes eight and the whole field becomes
fevered with excitement Arthur after two narrow escapes scores one
and Johnson gets the ball The bowling and fielding are superb and
Johnsons batting worthy the occasion He makes here a two and there a
one managing to keep the ball to himself and Arthur backs up and runs
perfectly Only eleven runs to make now and the crowd scarcely breathe
At last Arthur gets the ball again and actually drives it forward
for two and feels prouder than when he got the three best prizes at
hearing Toms shout of joy Well played well played young un

But the next ball is too much for the young hand and his bails fly
different ways Nine runs to make and two wickets to go down it is too
much for human nerves

Before Winter can get in the omnibus which is to take the Lords men
to the train pulls up at the side of the close and Mr Aislabie and Tom
consult and give out that the stumps will be drawn after the next over
And so ends the great match Winter and Johnson carry out their bats
and it being a one days match the Lords men are declared the
winners they having scored the most in the first innings

But such a defeat is a victory so think Tom and all the School eleven
as they accompany their conquerors to the omnibus and send them off
with three ringing cheers after Mr Aislabie has shaken hands all
round saying to Tom I must compliment you sir on your eleven and I
hope we shall have you for a member if you come up to town

As Tom and the rest of the eleven were turning back into the close and
everybody was beginning to cry out for another countrydance encouraged
by the success of the night before the young master who was just
leaving the close stopped him and asked him to come up to tea at
halfpast eight adding I wont keep you more than half an hour and
ask Arthur to come up too

Ill come up with you directly if youll let me said Tom for I
feel rather melancholy and not quite up to the countrydance and supper
with the rest

Do by all means said the master Ill wait here for you

So Tom went off to get his boots and things from the tent to tell
Arthur of the invitation and to speak to his second in command about
stopping the dancing and shutting up the close as soon as it grew dusk
Arthur promised to follow as soon as he had had a dance So Tom handed
his things over to the man in charge of the tent and walked quietly
away to the gate where the master was waiting and the two took their
way together up the Hillmorton road

Of course they found the masters house locked up and all the servants
away in the closeabout this time no doubt footing it away on the
grass with extreme delight to themselves and in utter oblivion of the
unfortunate bachelor their master whose one enjoyment in the shape
of meals was his dish of tea as our grandmothers called it in the
evening and the phrase was apt in his case for he always poured his
out into the saucer before drinking Great was the good mans horror at
finding himself shut out of his own house Had he been alone he
would have treated it as a matter of course and would have strolled
contentedly up and down his gravel walk until some one came home but he
was hurt at the stain on his character of host especially as the guest
was a pupil However the guest seemed to think it a great joke and
presently as they poked about round the house mounted a wall from
which he could reach a passage window The window as it turned out was
not bolted so in another minute Tom was in the house and down at the
front door which he opened from inside The master chuckled grimly at
this burglarious entry and insisted on leaving the halldoor and two
of the front windows open to frighten the truants on their return and
then the two set about foraging for tea in which operation the master
was much at fault having the faintest possible idea of where to find
anything and being moreover wondrously shortsighted but Tom by a
sort of instinct knew the right cupboards in the kitchen and pantry
and soon managed to place on the snuggery table better materials for a
meal than had appeared there probably during the reign of his tutor who
was then and there initiated amongst other things into the excellence
of that mysterious condiment a drippingcake The cake was newly baked
and all rich and flaky Tom had found it reposing in the cooks private
cupboard awaiting her return and as a warning to her they finished
it to the last crumb The kettle sang away merrily on the hob of the
snuggery for notwithstanding the time of year they lighted a fire
throwing both the windows wide open at the same time the heaps of books
and papers were pushed away to the other end of the table and the great
solitary engraving of Kings College Chapel over the mantelpiece looked
less stiff than usual as they settled themselves down in the twilight
to the serious drinking of tea

After some talk on the match and other indifferent subjects the
conversation came naturally back to Toms approaching departure over
which he began again to make his moan

Well we shall all miss you quite as much as you will miss us said
the master You are the Nestor of the School now are you not

Yes ever since East left answered Tom Bythebye have you heard
from him

Yes I had a letter in February just before he started for India to
join his regiment

He will make a capital officer

Ay wont he said Tom brightening No fellow could handle boys
better and I suppose soldiers are very like boys And hell never tell
them to go where he wont go himself No mistake about that A braver
fellow never walked

His year in the sixth will have taught him a good deal that will be
useful to him now

So it will said Tom staring into the fire Poor dear Harry he
went onhow well I remember the day we were put out of the twenty How
he rose to the situation and burnt his cigarcases and gave away his
pistols and pondered on the constitutional authority of the sixth and
his new duties to the Doctor and the fifth form and the fags Ay and
no fellow ever acted up to them better though he was always a peoples
manfor the fags and against constituted authorities He couldnt
help that you know Im sure the Doctor must have liked him said Tom
looking up inquiringly

The Doctor sees the good in every one and appreciates it said the
master dogmatically but I hope East will get a good colonel He wont
do if he cant respect those above him How long it took him even here
to learn the lesson of obeying

Well I wish I were alongside of him said Tom If I cant be at
Rugby I want to be at work in the world and not dawdling away three
years at Oxford

What do you mean by at work in the world said the master pausing
with his lips close to his saucerful of tea and peering at Tom over it

Well I mean real workones professionwhatever one will have really
to do and make ones living by I want to be doing some real good
feeling that I am not only at play in the world answered Tom rather
puzzled to find out himself what he really did mean

You are mixing up two very different things in your head I think
Brown said the master putting down the empty saucer and you ought
to get clear about them You talk of working to get your living and
doing some real good in the world in the same breath Now you may be
getting a very good living in a profession and yet doing no good at all
in the world but quite the contrary at the same time Keep the latter
before you as your one object and you will be right whether you make
a living or not but if you dwell on the other youll very likely drop
into mere moneymaking and let the world take care of itself for good
or evil Dont be in a hurry about finding your work in the world for
yourselfyou are not old enough to judge for yourself yet but just
look about you in the place you find yourself in and try to make things
a little better and honester there Youll find plenty to keep your hand
in at Oxford or wherever else you go And dont be led away to think
this part of the world important and that unimportant Every corner of
the world is important No man knows whether this part or that is most
so but every man may do some honest work in his own corner And then
the good man went on to talk wisely to Tom of the sort of work which
he might take up as an undergraduate and warned him of the prevalent
university sins and explained to him the many and great differences
between university and school life till the twilight changed into
darkness and they heard the truant servants stealing in by the back
entrance

I wonder where Arthur can be said Tom at last looking at his watch
why its nearly halfpast nine already

Oh he is comfortably at supper with the eleven forgetful of his
oldest friends said the master Nothing has given me greater
pleasure he went on than your friendship for him it has been the
making of you both

Of me at any rate answered Tom I should never have been here now
but for him It was the luckiest chance in the world that sent him to
Rugby and made him my chum

Why do you talk of lucky chances said the master I dont know that
there are any such things in the world at any rate there was neither
luck nor chance in that matter

Tom looked at him inquiringly and he went on Do you remember when the
Doctor lectured you and East at the end of one halfyear when you were
in the shell and had been getting into all sorts of scrapes

Yes well enough said Tom it was the halfyear before Arthur came

Exactly so answered the master Now I was with him a few minutes
afterwards and he was in great distress about you two And after some
talk we both agreed that you in particular wanted some object in the
School beyond games and mischief for it was quite clear that you never
would make the regular school work your first object And so the Doctor
at the beginning of the next halfyear looked out the best of the new
boys and separated you and East and put the young boy into your study
in the hope that when you had somebody to lean on you you would
begin to stand a little steadier yourself and get manliness and
thoughtfulness And I can assure you he has watched the experiment ever
since with great satisfaction Ah not one of you boys will ever know
the anxiety you have given him or the care with which he has watched
over every step in your school lives

Up to this time Tom had never given wholly in to or understood the
Doctor At first he had thoroughly feared him For some years as I have
tried to show he had learnt to regard him with love and respect and
to think him a very great and wise and good man But as regarded his own
position in the School of which he was no little proud Tom had no idea
of giving any one credit for it but himself and truth to tell was a
very selfconceited young gentleman on the subject He was wont to boast
that he had fought his own way fairly up the School and had never made
up to or been taken up by any big fellow or master and that it was
now quite a different place from what it was when he first came And
indeed though he didnt actually boast of it yet in his secret soul
he did to a great extent believe that the great reform in the School
had been owing quite as much to himself as to any one else Arthur
he acknowledged had done him good and taught him a good deal so had
other boys in different ways but they had not had the same means of
influence on the School in general And as for the Doctor why he was
a splendid master but every one knew that masters could do very little
out of school hours In short he felt on terms of equality with his
chief so far as the social state of the School was concerned and
thought that the Doctor would find it no easy matter to get on without
him Moreover his School Toryism was still strong and he looked still
with some jealousy on the Doctor as somewhat of a fanatic in the matter
of change and thought it very desirable for the School that he should
have some wise person such as himself to look sharply after vested
Schoolrights and see that nothing was done to the injury of the
republic without due protest

It was a new light to him to find that besides teaching the sixth and
governing and guiding the whole School editing classics and writing
histories the great headmaster had found time in those busy years
to watch over the career even of him Tom Brown and his particular
friends and no doubt of fifty other boys at the same time and all
this without taking the least credit to himself or seeming to know or
let any one else know that he ever thought particularly of any boy at
all

However the Doctors victory was complete from that moment over Tom
Brown at any rate He gave way at all points and the enemy marched
right over himcavalry infantry and artillery and the land transport
corps and the camp followers It had taken eight long years to do it
but now it was done thoroughly and there wasnt a corner of him left
which didnt believe in the Doctor Had he returned to School again and
the Doctor begun the halfyear by abolishing fagging and football and
the Saturday halfholiday or all or any of the most cherished School
institutions Tom would have supported him with the blindest faith And
so after a half confession of his previous shortcomings and sorrowful
adieus to his tutor from whom he received two beautifullybound volumes
of the Doctors sermons as a parting present he marched down to the
Schoolhouse a heroworshipper who would have satisfied the soul of
Thomas Carlyle himself

There he found the eleven at high jinks after supper Jack Raggles
shouting comic songs and performing feats of strength and was greeted
by a chorus of mingled remonstrance at his desertion and joy at his
reappearance And falling in with the humour of the evening he was soon
as great a boy as all the rest and at ten oclock was chaired round
the quadrangle on one of the hall benches borne aloft by the eleven
shouting in chorus For hes a jolly good fellow while old Thomas in
a melting mood and the other Schoolhouse servants stood looking on

And the next morning after breakfast he squared up all the cricketing
accounts went round to his tradesmen and other acquaintance and said
his hearty goodbyes and by twelve oclock was in the train and away
for London no longer a schoolboy and divided in his thoughts between
heroworship honest regrets over the long stage of his life which was
now slipping out of sight behind him and hopes and resolves for the
next stage upon which he was entering with all the confidence of a young
traveller



CHAPTER IXFINIS

 Strange friend past present and to be
 Loved deeplier darklier understood
 Behold I dream a dream of good
 And mingle all the world with theeTENNYSON

In the summer of 1842 our hero stopped once again at the wellknown
station and leaving his bag and fishingrod with a porter walked
slowly and sadly up towards the town It was now July He had rushed
away from Oxford the moment that term was over for a fishing ramble in
Scotland with two college friends and had been for three weeks living
on oatcake muttonhams and whisky in the wildest parts of Skye They
had descended one sultry evening on the little inn at Kyle Rhea ferry
and while Tom and another of the party put their tackle together
and began exploring the stream for a seatrout for supper the third
strolled into the house to arrange for their entertainment Presently he
came out in a loose blouse and slippers a short pipe in his mouth and
an old newspaper in his hand and threw himself on the heathery scrub
which met the shingle within easy hail of the fishermen There he lay
the picture of freeandeasy loafing handtomouth young England
improving his mind as he shouted to them by the perusal of the
fortnightold weekly paper soiled with the marks of toddyglasses and
tobaccoashes the legacy of the last traveller which he had hunted
out from the kitchen of the little hostelry and being a youth of
a communicative turn of mind began imparting the contents to the
fishermen as he went on

What a bother they are making about these wretched cornlaws Heres
three or four columns full of nothing but sliding scales and fixed
duties Hang this tobacco its always going out Ah heres something
bettera splendid match between Kent and England Brown Kent winning
by three wickets Felix fiftysix runs without a chance and not out

Tom intent on a fish which had risen at him twice answered only with a
grunt

Anything about the Goodwood called out the third man

Rory OMore drawn Butterfly colt amiss shouted the student

Just my luck grumbled the inquirer jerking his flies off the water
and throwing again with a heavy sullen splash and frightening Toms
fish

I say cant you throw lighter over there We aint fishing for
grampuses shouted Tom across the stream

Hullo Brown heres something for you called out the reading man
next moment Why your old master Arnold of Rugby is dead

Toms hand stopped halfway in his cast and his line and flies went all
tangling round and round his rod you might have knocked him over with a
feather Neither of his companions took any notice of him luckily and
with a violent effort he set to work mechanically to disentangle his
line He felt completely carried off his moral and intellectual legs as
if he had lost his standingpoint in the invisible world Besides which
the deep loving loyalty which he felt for his old leader made the shock
intensely painful It was the first great wrench of his life the first
gap which the angel Death had made in his circle and he felt numbed
and beaten down and spiritless Well well I believe it was good for
him and for many others in like case who had to learn by that loss
that the soul of man cannot stand or lean upon any human prop however
strong and wise and good but that He upon whom alone it can stand and
lean will knock away all such props in His own wise and merciful way
until there is no ground or stay left but Himself the Rock of Ages
upon whom alone a sure foundation for every soul of man is laid

As he wearily laboured at his line the thought struck him It may
be all falsea mere newspaper lie And he strode up to the recumbent
smoker

Let me look at the paper said he

Nothing else in it answered the other handing it up to him
listlessly Hullo Brown whats the matter old fellow Aint you
well

Where is it said Tom turning over the leaves his hands trembling
and his eyes swimming so that he could not read

What What are you looking for said his friend jumping up and
looking over his shoulder

Thatabout Arnold said Tom

Oh here said the other putting his finger on the paragraph Tom
read it over and over again There could be no mistake of identity
though the account was short enough

Thank you said he at last dropping the paper I shall go for a
walk Dont you and Herbert wait supper for me And away he strode
up over the moor at the back of the house to be alone and master his
grief if possible

His friend looked after him sympathizing and wondering and knocking
the ashes out of his pipe walked over to Herbert After a short parley
they walked together up to the house

Im afraid that confounded newspaper has spoiled Browns fun for this
trip

How odd that he should be so fond of his old master said Herbert Yet
they also were both publicschool men

The two however notwithstanding Toms prohibition waited supper
for him and had everything ready when he came back some half an hour
afterwards But he could not join in their cheerful talk and the party
was soon silent notwithstanding the efforts of all three One thing
only had Tom resolved and that was that he couldnt stay in Scotland
any longer he felt an irresistible longing to get to Rugby and then
home and soon broke it to the others who had too much tact to oppose

So by daylight the next morning he was marching through Rossshire
and in the evening hit the Caledonian Canal took the next steamer
and travelled as fast as boat and railway could carry him to the Rugby
station

As he walked up to the town he felt shy and afraid of being seen
and took the back streetswhy he didnt know but he followed his
instinct At the Schoolgates he made a dead pause there was not a soul
in the quadrangleall was lonely and silent and sad So with another
effort he strode through the quadrangle and into the Schoolhouse
offices

He found the little matron in her room in deep mourning shook her hand
tried to talk and moved nervously about She was evidently thinking of
the same subject as he but he couldnt begin talking

Where shall I find Thomas said he at last getting desperate

In the servants hall I think sir But wont you take anything said
the matron looking rather disappointed

No thank you said he and strode off again to find the old
verger who was sitting in his little den as of old puzzling over
hieroglyphics

He looked up through his spectacles as Tom seized his hand and wrung it

Ah youve heard all about it sir I see said he Tom nodded and
then sat down on the shoeboard while the old man told his tale and
wiped his spectacles and fairly flowed over with quaint homely honest
sorrow

By the time he had done Tom felt much better

Where is he buried Thomas said he at last

Under the altar in the chapel sir answered Thomas Youd like to
have the key I dare say

Thank you Thomasyes I should very much

And the old man fumbled among his bunch and then got up as though
he would go with him but after a few steps stopped short and said
Perhaps youd like to go by yourself sir

Tom nodded and the bunch of keys were handed to him with an injunction
to be sure and lock the door after him and bring them back before eight
oclock

He walked quickly through the quadrangle and out into the close The
longing which had been upon him and driven him thus far like the
gadfly in the Greek legends giving him no rest in mind or body seemed
all of a sudden not to be satisfied but to shrivel up and pall Why
should I go on Its no use he thought and threw himself at full
length on the turf and looked vaguely and listlessly at all the
wellknown objects There were a few of the town boys playing cricket
their wicket pitched on the best piece in the middle of the bigside
grounda sin about equal to sacrilege in the eyes of a captain of the
eleven He was very nearly getting up to go and send them off Pshaw
they wont remember me Theyve more right there than I he muttered
And the thought that his sceptre had departed and his mark was wearing
out came home to him for the first time and bitterly enough He was
lying on the very spot where the fights came offwhere he himself had
fought six years ago his first and last battle He conjured up the scene
till he could almost hear the shouts of the ring and Easts whisper in
his ear and looking across the close to the Doctors private door
half expected to see it open and the tall figure in cap and gown come
striding under the elmtrees towards him

No no that sight could never be seen again There was no flag flying
on the round tower the Schoolhouse windows were all shuttered up and
when the flag went up again and the shutters came down it would be
to welcome a stranger All that was left on earth of him whom he had
honoured was lying cold and still under the chapel floor He would go in
and see the place once more and then leave it once for all New men and
new methods might do for other people let those who would worship the
rising star he at least would be faithful to the sun which had
set And so he got up and walked to the chapel door and unlocked it
fancying himself the only mourner in all the broad land and feeding on
his own selfish sorrow

He passed through the vestibule and then paused for a moment to glance
over the empty benches His heart was still proud and high and he
walked up to the seat which he had last occupied as a sixthform boy
and sat himself down there to collect his thoughts

And truth to tell they needed collecting and setting in order not a
little The memories of eight years were all dancing through his brain
and carrying him about whither they would while beneath them all his
heart was throbbing with the dull sense of a loss that could never be
made up to him The rays of the evening sun came solemnly through the
painted windows above his head and fell in gorgeous colours on the
opposite wall and the perfect stillness soothed his spirit by little
and little And he turned to the pulpit and looked at it and then
leaning forward with his head on his hands groaned aloud If he could
only have seen the Doctor again for one five minuteshave told him all
that was in his heart what he owed to him how he loved and reverenced
him and would by Gods help follow his steps in life and deathhe
could have borne it all without a murmur But that he should have gone
away for ever without knowing it all was too much to bear But am I
sure that he does not know it all The thought made him start May he
not even now be near me in this very chapel If he be am I sorrowing
as he would have me sorrow as I should wish to have sorrowed when I
shall meet him again

He raised himself up and looked round and after a minute rose and
walked humbly down to the lowest bench and sat down on the very seat
which he had occupied on his first Sunday at Rugby And then the old
memories rushed back again but softened and subdued and soothing him
as he let himself be carried away by them And he looked up at the great
painted window above the altar and remembered how when a little boy
he used to try not to look through it at the elmtrees and the rooks
before the painted glass came and the subscription for the painted
glass and the letter he wrote home for money to give to it And there
down below was the very name of the boy who sat on his right hand on
that first day scratched rudely in the oak panelling

And then came the thought of all his old schoolfellows and form after
form of boys nobler and braver and purer than he rose up and seemed to
rebuke him Could he not think of them and what they had felt and were
feelingthey who had honoured and loved from the first the man whom he
had taken years to know and love Could he not think of those yet dearer
to him who was gone who bore his name and shared his blood and were
now without a husband or a father Then the grief which he began to
share with others became gentle and holy and he rose up once more and
walked up the steps to the altar and while the tears flowed freely down
his cheeks knelt down humbly and hopefully to lay down there his share
of a burden which had proved itself too heavy for him to bear in his own
strength

Here let us leave him Where better could we leave him than at the
altar before which he had first caught a glimpse of the glory of his
birthright and felt the drawing of the bond which links all living
souls together in one brotherhoodat the grave beneath the altar of him
who had opened his eyes to see that glory and softened his heart till
it could feel that bond

And let us not be hard on him if at that moment his soul is fuller of
the tomb and him who lies there than of the altar and Him of whom it
speaks Such stages have to be gone through I believe by all young and
brave souls who must win their way through heroworship to the worship
of Him who is the King and Lord of heroes For it is only through our
mysterious human relationshipsthrough the love and tenderness and
purity of mothers and sisters and wives through the strength and
courage and wisdom of fathers and brothers and teachersthat we can
come to the knowledge of Him in whom alone the love and the tenderness
and the purity and the strength and the courage and the wisdom of all
these dwell for ever and ever in perfect fullness
