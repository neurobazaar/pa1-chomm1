THE PINE AND THE ROSE


It was not long after sunrise and Stephen Waterman fresh from his dip
in the river had scrambled up the hillside from the hut in the
alderbushes where he had made his morning toilet

An early ablution of this sort was not the custom of the farmers along
the banks of the Saco but the Waterman house was hardly a stones throw
from the water and there was a clear deep swimminghole in the Willow
Cove that would have tempted the busiest man or the least cleanly in
York County Then too Stephen was a child of the river born reared
schooled on its very brink never happy unless he were on it or in it
or beside it or at least within sight or sound of it

The immensity of the sea had always silenced and overawed him left him
cold in feeling The river wooed him caressed him won his heart It
was just big enough to love It was full of charms and changes of
varying moods and sudden surprises Its voice stole in upon his ear with
a melody far sweeter and more subtle than the boom of the ocean Yet it
was not without strength and when it was swollen with the freshets of
the spring and brimming with the bounty of its sister streams it could
dash and roar boom and crash with the best of them

Stephen stood on the side porch drinking in the glory of the sunrise
with the Saco winding like a silver ribbon through the sweet loveliness
of the summer landscape

And the river rolled on toward the sea singing its morning song
creating and nourishing beauty at every step of its onward path Cradled
in the heart of a great mountainrange it pursued its gleaming way
here lying silent in glassy lakes there rushing into tinkling little
falls foaming great falls and thundering cataracts Scores of bridges
spanned its width but no steamers flurried its crystal depths Here and
there a rough little rowboat tethered to a willow rocked to and fro in
some quiet bend of the shore Here the silver gleam of a rising perch
chub or trout caught the eye there a pickerel lay rigid in the clear
water a fish carved in stone here eels coiled in the muddy bottom of
some pool and there under the deep shadows of the rocks lay fat
sleepy bass old and incredibly wise quite untempted by and wholly
superior to the rural fishermans worm

The river lapped the shores of peaceful meadows it flowed along banks
green with maple beech sycamore and birch it fell tempestuously over
dams and fought its way between rocky cliffs crowned with stately firs
It rolled past forests of pine and hemlock and spruce now gentle now
terrible for there is said to be an Indian curse upon the Saco
whereby with every great sun the child of a paleface shall be drawn
into its cruel depths Lashed into fury by the stony reefs that impeded
its progress the river looked now sapphire now gold now white now
leaden gray but always it was hurrying hurrying on its appointed way
to the sea

After feasting his eyes and filling his heart with a morning draught of
beauty Stephen went in from the porch and pausing at the stairway
called in stentorian tones Get up and eat your breakfast Rufus The
boys will be picking the side jams today and Im going down to work on
the logs If you come along bring your own pickpole and peavey Then
going to the kitchen pantry he collected from the various shelves a
pitcher of milk a loaf of bread half an applepie and a bowl of
blueberries and with the easy methods of a household unswayed by
feminine rule moved toward a seat under an appletree and took his
morning meal in great apparent content Having finished and washed his
dishes with much more thoroughness than is common to unsuperintended
man and having given Rufus the second call to breakfast with the vigor
and acrimony that usually marks that unpleasant performance he strode
to a high point on the riverbank and shading his eyes with his hand
gazed steadily down stream

Patches of green fodder and blossoming potatoes melted into soft fields
that had been lately mown and there were glimpses of tasseling corn
rising high to catch the sun Far far down on the opposite bank of the
river was the hint of a brown roof and the tip of a chimney that sent a
slender wisp of smoke into the clear air Beyond this and farther back
from the water the trees apparently hid a cluster of other chimneys
for thin spirals of smoke ascended here and there The little brown roof
could never have revealed itself to any but a lovers eye and that
discerned something even smaller something like a pinkish speck that
moved hither and thither on a piece of greensward that sloped to the
waterside

Shes up Stephen exclaimed under his breath his eyes shining his
lips smiling His voice had a note of hushed exaltation about it as if
she whoever she might be had in condescending to rise conferred a
priceless boon upon a waiting universe If she were indeed a up so
his tone implied then the day somewhat falsely heralded by the
sunrise had really begun and the human race might pursue its appointed
tasks inspired and uplifted by the consciousness of her existence It
might properly be grateful for the fact of her birth that she had grown
to womans estate and above all that in common with the sun the
lark the morningglory and other beautiful things of the early day
she was up and about her lovely cheery heartwarming business

Illustration SHES UP

The handful of chimneys and the smoke spirals rising here and there
among the trees on the riverbank belonged to what was known as the
Brier Neighborhood There were only a few houses in all scattered along
a side road leading from the river up to Liberty Centre There were no
great signs of thrift or prosperity but the Wiley cottage the only one
near the water was neat and well cared for and Nature had done her
best to conceal mans indolence poverty or neglect

Bushes of sweetbrier grew in fragrant little forests as tall as the
fences Clumps of wild roses sprang up at every turn and over all the
stone walls as well as on every heap of rocks by the wayside prickly
blackberry vines ran and clambered and clung yielding fruit and thorns
impartially to the neighborhood children

The pinkish speck that Stephen Waterman had spied from his side of the
river was Rose Wiley of the Brier Neighborhood on the Edgewood side As
there was another of her name on Brigadier Hill the Edgewood minister
called one of them the climbing Rose and the other the brier Rose or
sometimes Rose of the river She was well named the pinkish speck She
had not only some of the sweetest attributes of the wild rose but the
parallel might have been extended as far as the thorns for she had
wounded her scoreshearts be it understood not hands The wounding
was on the whole very innocently done and if fault could be imputed
anywhere it might rightly have been laid at the door of the kind powers
who had made her what she was since the smile that blesses a single
heart is always destined to break many more

She had not a single silk gown but she had what is far better a figure
to show off a cotton one Not a brooch nor a pair of earrings was
numbered among her possessions but any ordinary gems would have looked
rather dull and trivial when compelled to undergo comparison with her
bright eyes As to her hair the local milliner declared it impossible
for Rose Wiley to get an unbecoming hat that on one occasion being in
a frolicsome mood Rose had tried on all the headgear in the village
emporiumchildrens gingham Shakers mourning bonnets for aged
dames mens haying hats and visored capsand she proved superior to
every test looking as pretty as a pink in the best ones and simply
ravishing in the worst In fact she had been so fashioned and finished
by Nature that had she been set on a revolving pedestal in a
showwindow the bystanders would have exclaimed as each new charm came
into view Look at her waist See her shoulders And her neck and
chin And her hair While the children gazing with raptured
admiration would have shrieked in unison I choose her for mine

All this is as much as to say that Rose of the river was a beauty yet
it quite fails to explain nevertheless the secret of her power When
she looked her worst the spell was as potent as when she looked her
best Hidden away somewhere was a vital spark which warmed every one who
came in contact with it Her lovely little person was a trifle below
medium height and it might as well be confessed that her soul on the
morning when Stephen Waterman saw her hanging out the clothes on the
river bank was not large enough to be at all out of proportion but
when eyes and dimples lips and cheeks enslave the onlooker the soul
is seldom subjected to a close or critical scrutiny Besides Rose Wiley
was a nice girl neat as wax energetic merry amiable economical She
was a dutiful granddaughter to two of the most irritating old people in
the county she never patronized her pugnosed pastyfaced girl
friends she made wonderful pies and doughnuts and besides small
souls if they are of the right sort sometimes have a way of growing
to the discomfiture of cynics and the gratification of the angels

So on one bank of the river grew the brier rose a fragile thing
swaying on a slender stalk and looking at its pretty reflection in the
water and on the other a sturdy pine tree well rooted against wind and
storm And the sturdy pine yearned for the wild rose and the rose so
far as it knew yearned for nothing at all certainly not for rugged
pine trees standing tall and grim in rocky soil If in its present
stage of development it gravitated toward anything in particular it
would have been a welldressed white birch growing on an irreproachable
lawn

And the river now deep now shallow now smooth now tumultuous now
sparkling in sunshine now gloomy under clouds rolled on to the
engulfing sea It could not stop to concern itself with the petty
comedies and tragedies that were being enacted along its shores else it
would never have reached its destination Only last night under a full
moon there had been pairs of lovers leaning over the rails of all the
bridges along its course but that was a common sight like that of the
ardent couples sitting on its shady banks these summer days looking
only into each others eyes but exclaiming about the beauty of the
water Lovers would come and go sometimes reappearing with successive
installments of loves in a way wholly mysterious to the river Meantime
it had its own work to do and must be about it for the side jams were
to be broken and the boom let out at the Edgewood bridge




OLD KENNEBEC


It was just seven oclock that same morning when Rose Wiley smoothed the
last wrinkle from her dimity counterpane picked up a shred of cornhusk
from the spotless floor under the bed slapped a mosquito on the
windowsill removed all signs of murder with a moist towel and before
running down to breakfast cast a frowning look at her pincushion
Almira otherwise Mite Shapley had been in her room the afternoon
before and disturbed with her careless hand the pattern of Roses pins
They were kept religiously in the form of a Maltese cross and if while
she was extricating one from her clothing there had been an alarm of
fire Rose would have stuck the pin in its appointed place in the
design at the risk of losing her life

Entering the kitchen with her light step she brought the morning
sunshine with her The old people had already engaged in differences of
opinion but they commonly suspended open warfare in her presence There
were the usual last things to be done for breakfast offices that
belonged to her as her grandmothers assistant She took yesterdays
soda biscuits out of the steamer where they were warming and softening
brought an apple pie and a plate of seed cakes from the pantry settled
the coffee with a piece of dried fish skin and an egg shell and
transferred some fried potatoes from the spider to a covered dish

Did you remember the meat grandpa Were all out she said as she
began buttoning a stiff collar around his reluctant neck

Remember Land yes I wisht I ever could forgit anything The butcher
says hes bout tired o travelin over the country lookin for critters
to kill but if he finds anything hell be up along in the course of a
week He aint a real smart butcher Cyse Higgins aintLand Rose
dont button that dickey clean through my epperdummis I have to sport
starched collars in this life on account o you and your granmother
bein so chock full o style but I hope to the Lord I shant have to
wear em in another world

You wont his wife responded with the snap of a dish towel or if
you do theyll wilt with the heat

Rose smiled but the soft hand with which she tied the neckcloth about
the old mans withered neck pacified his spirit and he smiled knowingly
back at her as she took her seat at the breakfast table spread near the
open kitchen door She was a dazzling Rose and it is to be feared a
wasted one for there was no one present to observe her clean pink
calico and the still more subtle note struck in the green ribbon which
was tied round her throatthe ribbon that formed a sort of calyx out
of which sprang the flower of her face as fresh and radiant as if it
had bloomed that morning

Give me my coffee turrible quick said Mr Wiley I must be down the
bridge fore they start dogwarpin the side jam

I notice youre always due at the bridge on churnin days remarked
his spouse testily

Taint me as appints drivin dates at Edgewood replied the old man
The boysll hev a turrible job this year The logs air ricked up jest
like Roses jackstraws I never seeem so turrible ricked up in all my
experence an Lije Dennett don know no more bout pickin a jam than
Coopers cow Turrible sot in his ways too cant take a mite of
advice I was tellin him how to go to work on that bung thats formed
between the gret gray rock an the shorethe awfullest place to bung
that there is between this an Biddefordand says he Look here
Ive ben boss on this river for twelve year an Ill be doggoned if
Im goin to be taught my business by any man This aint no river
says I as youd know says I if youd ever lived on the Kennebec
Pity you hednt stayed on it says he I wish to the land I hed says
I An then I come away for my tongues so turrible spry an sarcustic
that I knew if I stopped any longer I should stir up strife Theres
some folks thatll set on addled aigs year in an year out as if there
want good fresh ones bein laid every day an Lije Dennetts one of
em when it comes to river drivin

Theres lots o folks as have made a good livin by mindin their own
business observed the still sententious Mrs Wiley as she speared a
sodabiscuit with her fork

Mindin your own business is a turrible selfish trade responded her
husband loftily If your neighbor is more ignorant than what you
areparticlarly if hes as ignorant as Coopers cowyoud ought
as a Kennebec man an a Christian to set him on the right track though
its always a turrible risky thing to do

Roses grandfather was called by the irreverent younger generation
sometimes Turrible Wiley and sometimes Old Kennebec because of the
frequency with which these words appeared in his conversation There
were not wanting those of late who dubbed him Uncle Ananias for reasons
too obvious to mention After a long indolent tolerably truthful and
useless life he had at seventyfive lost sight of the dividing line
between fact and fancy and drew on his imagination to such an extent
that he almost staggered himself when he began to indulge in
reminiscence He was a feature of the Edgewood drive being always
present during the five or six days that it was in progress sometimes
sitting on the riverbank sometimes leaning over the bridge sometimes
reclining against the buttend of a huge log but always chewing
tobacco and expectorating to incredible distances as he criticized and
damned impartially all the expedients in use at the particular moment

I want to stay down by the river this afternoon said Rose Ever so
many of the girls will be there and all my sewing is done up If
grandpa will leave the horse for me Ill take the drivers lunch to
them at noon and bring the dishes back in time to wash them before
supper

I suppose you can go if the rest do said her grandmother though
its an awful lazy way of spendin an afternoon When I was a girl there
was no such dawdlin goin on I can tell you Nobody thought o lookin
at the river in them days there wasnt time

But its such fun to watch the logs Rose exclaimed Next to dancing
the greatest fun in the world

Specially as all the young men in town will be there watchin too
was the grandmothers reply Eben Brooks an Richard Bean got home
yesterday with their doctors diplomas in their pockets Mrs Brooks
says Eben stood fortynine in a class o fiftyfive an seemed
considable proud of him an I guess it is the first time he ever stood
anywheres but at the foot I tell you when these fiftyfive new doctors
git scattered over the country therell be considable many folks
keepin house under ground Dick Beans goin to stop a spell with Rufe
an Steve Waterman Thatll make one more to play in the river

Rufus aint hardly got his workin legs on yit allowed Mr Wiley but
Steves all right Hes a turrible smart driver an turrible reckless
too Hell take all the chances there is though to a man thats lived
on the Kennebec there aint what can rightly be called any turrible
chances on the Saco

Hed better be tendin to his farm objected Mrs Wiley

Illustration HES A TURRIBLE SMART DRIVER

His hay is all in Rose spoke up quickly and he only helps on the
river when the farm work isnt pressing Besides though its all play
to him he earns his two dollars and a half a day

He dont keer about the two and a half said her grandfather He jest
cant keep away from the logs Theres some that cant When I first
moved here from Gardner where the climate never suited me

The climate of any place where you hev regular work never did an never
will suit you remarked the old mans wife but the interruption
received no comment such mistaken views of his character were too
frequent to make any impression

As I was sayin Rose he continued when we first moved here from
Gardner we lived neighbor to the Watermans Steve an Rufus was little
boys then always playin with a couple o wild cousins o theirn
considable older Steve would scare his mother pretty nigh to death
stealin away to the mill to ride on the carriage side o the log
that was bein sawed hitchin clean out over the river an then jerkin
back most into the jaws o the machinery

He never hed any common sense to spare even when he was a young one
remarked Mrs Wiley and I dont see as all the cademy education his
father throwed away on him has changed him much And with this
observation she rose from the table and went to the sink

Steve aint nobodys fool dissented the old man but hes kind o
daft about the river When he was little he was allers buildin dams in
the brook an sailin chips an runnin on the logs allers choppin
up stickins an raftin em together in the pond I callate Mis
Waterman died considable afore her time jest from fright lookin out
the winders and seein her boys slippin between the logs an gittin
their daily dousin She couldnt understand it an theres a heap o
things womenfolks never do an never can understandjest because they
air womenfolks

One o the things is men I spose interrupted Mrs Wiley

Men in general but more particlarly husbands assented Old Kennebec
howsomever theres another thing they dont an cant never take in
an thats sport Steve does river drivin as he would horseracin or
tigershootin or tightrope dancin an he always did from a boy
When he was about twelve or fifteen he used to help the riverdrivers
spring and fall reglar He couldnt do nothin but shin up an down
the rocks after hammers an hatchets an ropes but he was turrible
pleased with his job Stepanfetchit they used to call him them
daysStephanfetchit Waterman

Good name for him yet came in acid tones from the sink Hes still
steppin an fetchin only its Rose thats doin the drivin now

Im not driving anybody that I know of answered Rose with
heightened color but with no loss of her habitual selfcommand

Then when he graduated from errants went on the crafty old man who
knew that when breakfast ceased churning must begin Steve used to get
seventyfive cents a day helpin clear up the riverif you can call
this here silvry streamlet a river Hed pick off a log here an there
an send it afloat an dig out them that hed got ketched in the rocks
and tidy up the banks jest like spring housecleanin If hed hed any
kind of a boss an hed ben trained on the Kennebec hed a made a
turrible smart driver Steve would

Hell be drownded thats whatll become o him prophesied Mrs
Wiley specially if Rose encourages him in such silly foolishness as
ridin logs from his house down to ourn dark nights

Seein as how Steve built ye a nice pig pen last month pears to me
you might have a good word for him now an then mother remarked Old
Kennebec reaching for his second piece of pie

I want a mite deceived by that pig pen no moren I was by Jed
Towles hen coop nor Ivory Dunns wellcurb nor Pitt Packards
shedsteps If you hed ever kep up your buildins yourself Roses
beaux wouldnt hev to do their courtin with carpenters tools

Its the pigpen an the hencoop you want to keep your eye on mother
not the motives of them as made em Its turrible onsettlin to inspeck
folks motives too turrible close

Riding a log is no more to Steve than riding a horse so he says
interposed Rose to change the subject but I tell him that a horse
doesnt revolve under you and go sideways at the same time that it is
going forwards

Logridin aint no trick at all to a man of sperit said Mr Wiley
Theres a few places in the Kennebec where the waters too shaller to
let the logs float so we used to build a flume an the logs would whiz
down like arrers shot from a bow The boys used to collect by the side
o that there flume to see me ride a log down an Ive watched em drop
in a dead faint when I spun by the crowd but land you cant drownd
some folks not without you tie nailkags to their head an feet an
drop em in the falls I ve rid logs down the bilinest rapids o the
Kennebec an never lost my head I remember well the year o the gret
freshet I rid a log from

There there father thatll do said Mrs Wiley decisively Ill
put the cream in the churn an you jest work off some o your steam by
bringin the butter for us afore you start for the bridge It dont do
no good to brag afore your own womenfolks work goes considable
bettern stories at every place cept the loafers bench at the
tavern

And the baffled raconteur who had never done a piece of work cheerfully
in his life dragged himself reluctantly to the shed where before
long one could hear him moving the dasher up and down sedately to his
favorite churning tune of

 Broad is the road that leads to death
 And thousands walk together there
 But Wisdom shows a narrow path
 With here and there a traveler




THE EDGEWOOD DRIVE


Just where the bridge knits together the two little villages of Pleasant
River and Edgewood the glassy mirror of the Saco broadens suddenly
sweeping over the dam in a luminous torrent Gushes of pure amber mark
the middle of the dam with crystal and silver at the sides and from
the seething vortex beneath the golden cascade the white spray dashes up
in fountains In the crevices and hollows of the rocks the mad water
churns itself into snowy froth while the foamflecked torrent deep
strong and troubled to its heart sweeps majestically under the bridge
then dashes between wooded shores piled high with steep masses of rock
or torn and riven by great gorges

There had been much rain during the summer and the Saco was very high
so on the third day of the Edgewood drive there was considerable
excitement at the bridge and a goodly audience of villagers from both
sides of the river There were some who never came some who had no
fancy for the sight some to whom it was an old story some who were too
busy but there were many to whom it was the event of events a
neverending source of interest

Above the fall covering the placid surface of the river thousands of
logs lay quietly in boom until the turning out process on the last
day of the drive should release them and give them their chance of
display their brief moment of notoriety their opportunity of
interesting amusing exciting and exasperating the onlookers by their
antics

Heaps of logs had been cast up on the rocks below the dam where they
lay in hopeless confusion adding nothing however to the problem of
the moment for they too bided their time If they had possessed wisdom
discretion and caution they might have slipped gracefully over the
falls and steering clear of the hidden ledges about which it would
seem they must have heard whispers from the old pine trees along the
river have kept a straight course and reached their destination
without costing the Edgewood Lumber Company a small fortune Or if they
had inclined toward a jolly and adventurous career they could have
joined one of the various jams or bungs stimulated by the thought
that any one of them might be a keylog holding for a time the entire
mass in its despotic power But they had been stranded early in the
game and after lying high and dry for weeks would be picked off one
by one and sent downstream

In the tumultuous boil the foaming hubbub and flurry at the foot of the
falls one enormous peeled log wallowed up and down like a huge
rhinoceros greatly pleasing the children by its clumsy cavortings Some
conflict of opposing forces kept it ever in motion yet never set it
free Below the bridge were always the real battlegrounds the scenes
of the first and the fiercest conflicts A ragged ledge of rock
standing well above the yeasty torrent marked the middle of the river
Stephen had been stranded there once just at dusk on a stormy
afternoon in spring A jam had broken under the men and Stephen having
taken too great risks had been caught on the moving mass and leaping
from log to log his only chance for life had been to find a footing on
Gray Rock which was nearer than the shore

Rufus was ill at the time and Mrs Waterman so anxious and nervous that
processions of boys had to be sent up to the River Farm giving the
frightened mother the latest bulletins of her sons welfare Luckily
the river was narrow just at the Gray Rock and it was a quite possible
task though no easy one to lash two ladders together and make a narrow
bridge on which the drenched and shivering man could reach the shore
There were loud cheers when Stephen ran lightly across the slender
pathway that led to safetyran so fast that the ladders had scarce time
to bend beneath his weight He had certainly taken chances but when
did he not do that The loggers life is one of moving accidents by
flood and field and Stephen welcomed with wildqq exhilaration every
hazard that came in his path To him there was never a dull hour from
the moment that the first notch was cut in the tree for he sometimes
joined the boys in the lumber camp just for a frolic till the later one
when the hewn log reached its final destination He knew nothing of
tooling a fourinhand through narrow lanes or crowded
thoroughfaresnothing of guiding a horse over the hedges and through
the pitfalls of a stiff bit of hunting country his steed was the
rearing plunging kicking log and he rode it like a river god

Illustration HE HAD CERTAINLY TAKEN CHANCES

The crowd loves daring and so it welcomed Stephen with braves but it
knew as he knew that he was only doing his duty by the Company only
showing the Saco that man was master only keeping the old Waterman name
in good repute

Ye cant drownd some folks Old Kennebec had said as he stood in a
group on the shore not without you tie sandbags toem an drop em in
the Great Eddy Im the same kind I remember when I was stranded on
jest sech a rock in the Kennebec only they left me there all night for
dead an I had to swim the rapids when it come daylight

Were well acquainted with that rock and them rapids exclaimed one of
the riverdrivers to the delight of the company

Rose had reason to remember Stephens adventure for he had clambered
up the bank smiling and blushing under the hurrahs of the boys and
coming to the wagon where she sat waiting for her grandfather had
seized a moment to whisper Did you care whether I came across safe
Rose Say you did

Stephen recalled that question too on this August morning perhaps
because this was to be a redletter day and sometime when he had a
free momentsometime before supper when he and Rose were sitting
apart from the others watching the logshe intended again to ask her
to marry him This thought trembled in him stirring the deeps of his
heart like a great wave almost sweeping him off his feet when he held
it too close and let it have full sway It would be the fourth time that
he had asked Rose this question of all questions but there was no
perceptible difference in his excitement for there was always the
possible chance that she might change her mind and say yes if only for
variety Wanting a thing continuously unchangingly unceasingly year
after year he thoughtlonging to reach it as the river longed to
reach the seasuch wanting might in course of time mean having

Rose drove up to the bridge with the mens luncheon and the under boss
came up to take the baskets and boxes from the back of the wagon

Weve had a reglar tussle this mornin Rose he said The logs are
determined not to move Ike Billings thats the hansomest and
fluentest allround swearer on the Saco has tried his best on the side
jam Hes all out o cusswords and there haint a log budged Now stid
o dogwarpin this afternoon an lettin the oxen haul off all them
stubborn logs by main force were goin to ask you to set up on the
bank and smile at the jam Land she can do it says Ike a minute ago
When Rose starts smilin he says there aint a jam nor a bung in me
that dont melt like wax and jest float right off same as the logs do
when they get into quiet sunny water

Rose blushed and laughed and drove up the hill to Mite Shapleys where
she put up the horse and waited till the men had eaten their luncheon
The drivers slept and had breakfast and supper at the Billings house a
mile down river but for several years Mrs Wiley had furnished the noon
meal sending it down piping hot on the stroke of twelve The boys
always said that up or down the whole length of the Saco there was no
such cooking as the Wileys and much of this praise was earned by
Roses serving It was the old grandmother who burnished the tin plates
and dippers till they looked like silver for crotchety and
sharptongued as she wasshe never allowed Rose to spoil her hands with
soft soap and sand but it was Rose who planned and packed Rose who
hemmed squares of old white tablecloths and sheets to line the baskets
and keep things daintily separate Rose also whose tarts and cakes
were the pride and admiration of church sociables and sewing societies

Where could such smoking pots of beans be found A murmur of ecstatic
approval ran through the crowd when the covers were removed Pieces of
sweet homefed pork glistened like varnished mahogany on the top of the
beans and underneath were such deeps of fragrant juice as come only
from slow fires and long quiet hours in brick ovens Who else could
steam and bake such mealy leaves of brown bread brown as plumpudding
yet with no suspicion of sogginess Who such sodabiscuits big
feathery tasting of cream and hardly needing butter And greenapple
pies Could such candied lower crusts be found elsewhere or more
delectable filling Or such rich nutty doughnutsdoughnuts that had
spurned the hot fat which is the ruin of so many and risen from its
waves like goldenbrown Venuses

By the great seleckmen ejaculated Jed Towle as he swallowed his
fourth Id like to hev a wife two daughters and four sisters like
them Wileys and jest set still on the riverbank an hev em cook
victuals for me Id hev nothin to wish for then but a mouth as big as
the Sacos

And I wish this custard pie was the size o Bonnie Eagle Pond said
Ike Billings Id like to fall into the middle of it and eat my way
out

Look at that bunch o Chiny asters tied on t the bail o that
biscuitpail said Ivory Dunn Thats the girls doins you bet
womenfolks dont seem to make no boquets after they git married Lets
divide em up an wear em drivin this afternoon mebbe theyll ketch
the eye sot our rags wont show so bad Land its lucky my hundred
days is about up If I dont git home soon I shall be arrested for
goin without cloes I set upbout all night puttin these blue patches

BLASPHEMIOUS SWEARIN


Steve Watermans an awful nice feller exclaimed Ivory Dunn just then
Stephen had been looking intently across the river watching the
Shapleys side door from which Rose might issue at any moment and at
this point in the discussion he had lounged away from the group and
moving toward the bridge began to throw pebbles idly into the water

Hes an awful smart driver for one that dont foiler drivin the year
round continued Ivory and hes the awfullest cleanspoken
softspoken feller I ever see

Theres ben two black sheep in his family aready an Steve kind o
feels as if hed ought to be extry white remarked Jed Towle You
fellers that belonged to the old drive remember Pretty Quick Waterman
well enough Steves mother brought him up

Yes most of them remembered the Waterman twins Stephens cousins now
both deadSlow Waterman so moderate in his steps and actions that you
had to fix a landmark somewhere near him to see if he moved and Pretty
Quick who shone by comparison with his twin

Id kind o forgot that Pretty Quick Waterman was cousin to Steve
said the under boss he never worked with me much but he want cut
off the same piece o goods as the other Watermans Great hemlock but
he kep a cussin dictionary Pretty Quick did Whenever he heard any
new words he must a writ em down an then studied em all up in the
wintertime to use in the spring drive

Swearin s a habit that hed ought to be practiced with turrible
caution observed old Mr Wiley when the drivers had finished
luncheon and taken out their pipes Theres three kinds o
swearinplain swearin profane swearin an blasphemious swearin
Logs air jest like mules theres times when a man cant seem to rip up
a jam in good style thout a few words thats too strong for the infant
classes in Sundayschools but a man hednt ought to tempt Providence
When hes ridin a log near the falls at high water or cuttin the
keylog in a jam he aint in no place for blasphemious swearin jest a
little easy perlite damn is bout all he can resk if he dont want to
git drownded an hev his ghost walkin the riverbanks till kingdom
come

You an I Long was the only ones that seen Pretty Quick go want
we continued Old Kennebec glancing at Long Abe Dennett cousin to
Short Abe who lay on his back in the grass the smokewreaths rising
from his pipe and the steel spikes in his heavy calkedsole boots
shining in the sun

There was folks on the bridge Long answered but we was the only
ones near enough to see an hear It was so onexpected an so soon
over that them as was watchin upstream where the men was to work on
the falls wouldnt a hed time to see him go down But I did an
nobody aint heard me swear sence though its ten years ago I allers
said it was rum an bravadder that killed Pretty Quick Waterman that
day The boys hednt give him a dare that he hednt took up He seemed
like he was possessed an the logs was the same way they was fairly
wild leapin around in the maddest kind o water you ever see The
river was bilin high that spring it was an awful stubborn jam an
Pretty Quick hed ben workin on it sence dinner

He clumb up the bank moren once to have a pull at the bottle that was
hid in the bushes interpolated Mr Wiley

Like as not that was his failin Well most o the boys were on the
other side o the river workin above the bridge an the boss hed
called Pretty Quick to come off an leave the jam till mornin when
theyd get horses an dogwarp it off log by log But when the boss got
out o sight Pretty Quick jest stood right still swingin his axe an
blasphemin so t would freeze your blood vowin he wouldnt move till
the logs did if he stayed there till the crack o doom Jest then a
great ponderous log that hed ben churnin up an down in the falls for
a week got free an come blunderin an thunderin downriver Land it
was chockfull o water an looked bout as big as a church It come
straight along buttend foremost an struck that jam full force sot
every log in it shivered There was a crackthe crack o doom sure
enough for Pretty Quickan one o the logs lep right out an
struck him jest where he stood with his axe in the air blasphemin
The jam kind o melted an crumbled up an in a second Pretty Quick
was whirlin in the white water He never rizat least where we could
see himan we didnt find him for a week Thats the whole story an
I guess Steve takes it as a warnin Any way he aint no friend to rum
nor swearin Steve aint He knows Pretty Quicks ways shortened his
mothers life an you notice what a sharp lookout he keeps on Rufus

He needs it Ike Billings commented tersely

Some men seem to lose their wits when theyre workin on logs
observed Mr Wiley who had deeply resented Long Dennetts telling of a
story which he knew fully as well and could have told much better Now
natrally Ive seen things on the Kennebec 

Three cheers for the Saco Hats off boys shouted Jed Towle and his
directions were followed with a will

As I was sayin continued the old man peacefully Ive seen things
on the Kennebec that wouldnt happen on a small river an Ive ben in
turrible places an taken turrible resksresks that would a turned a
Saco River mans hair white but them is the times when my wits work the
quickest I remember once I was smokin my pipe when a jam broke under
me T was a small jam or what we call a small jam on the
Kennebeconly about three hundred thousand pine logs The first thing
I knowed I was shootin back an forth in the bilin foam hangin on
t the end of a log like a spider My hands was clasped round the log
and I never lost control o my pipe They said I smoked right along
jest as cool an placid as a pondlily

Whyd you quit drivin inquired Ivory

My strength want ekal to it Mr Wiley responded sadly I was all
skin bones an nerve The Compny wouldnt part with me altogether
so they give me a place in the office down on the wharves

That want so bad said Jed Towle why didnt you hang on to it
sos to keep in sight o the Kennebec

I found I couldnt be confined under cover My liver give all out my
appetite failed me an I want wuth a days wages Id learned
engineerin when I was a boy an I thought Id try runnin on the road
a spell but it didnt suit my constitution My kidneys aint turrible
strong an the doctors said Id have Brights disease if I didnt git
some kind o work where there want no vibrations

Hard to find Mr Wiley hard to find said Jed Towle

Youre right responded the old man feelingly Ive tried all kinds
o labor Some of em dont suit my liver some disagrees with my
stomach and the rest of em has vibrations so here I set high an
dry on the banks of life you might say like a stranded log

As this wellknown simile fell upon the ear there was a general stir in
the group for Turrible Wiley when rhetorical sometimes grew tearful
and this was a mood not to be encouraged

All right boss called Ike Billings winking to the boys well be
there in a jiffy for the luncheon hour had flown and the work of the
afternoon was waiting for them You make a chalkmark where you left
off Mr Wiley an well hear the rest tomorrer only dont you forgit
nothin Remembert was the Kennebec you was talkin about

I will indeed responded the old man As I was sayin when
interrupted I may be a stranded log but Im proud that the mark o the
Gardner Lumber Compny is on me sot when I git to my journeys end
theyll know where I belong and send me back to the Kennebec Before Im
sawed up Id like to forgit this triflin brook in the sight of a
goodsized river an rest my eyes on some fullgrown logs stead o
these little damn pipestems you boys are playin with




THE GAME OF JACKSTRAWS


There was a roar of laughter at the old mans boast but in a moment all
was activity The men ran hither and thither like ants gathering their
tools There were some oldfashioned pickpoles straight heavy levers
without any dog and there were modern pickpoles and peaveys for
every river has its favorite equipment in these things There was no
dynamite in those days to make the stubborn jams yield and the dogwarp
was in general use Horses or oxen sometimes a line of men stood on
the riverbank A long rope was attached by means of a steel spike to
one log after another and it was dragged from the tangled mass
Sometimes after unloading the top logs those at the bottom would rise
and make the task easier sometimes the work would go on for hours with
no perceptible progress and Mr Wiley would have opportunity to tell
the bystanders of a turrible jam on the Kennebec that had cost the
Lumber Company ten thousand dollars to break

There would be great arguments on shore among the villagers as well as
among the experts as to the particular log which might be a key to the
position The boss would study the problem from various standpoints and
the drivers themselves would pass from heated discussion into long
consultations

Theyre paid by the day Old Kennebec would philosophize to the
doctor an when theyre consultin they dont hev to be doggin which
is a turrible sight harder work

Rose had created a small sensation on one occasion by pointing out to
the under boss the keylog in a jam She was past mistress of the
pretty game of jackstraws much in vogue at that time The delicate
little lengths of polished wood or bone were shaken together and emptied
on the table Each jackstraw had one of its ends fashioned in the shape
of some sort of implementa rake hoe spade fork or mallet All the
pieces were intertwined by the shaking process and they lay as they
fell in a hopeless tangle The task consisted in taking a tiny
pickpole scarcely bigger than a match and with the bit of curved wire
on the end lifting off the jackstraws one by one without stirring the
pile or making it tremble When this occurred you gave place to your
opponent who relinquished his turn to you when ill fortune descended
upon him the game which was a kind of riverdriving and jampicking in
miniature being decided by the number of pieces captured and their
value No wonder that the under boss asked Roses advice as to the
keylog She had a fairys hand and her cunning at deciding the pieces
to be moved and her skill at extricating and lifting them from the
heap were looked upon in Edgewood as little less than supernatural It
was a favorite pastime and although a mans hand is ill adapted to it
being overlarge and heavy the game has obvious advantages for a lover
in bringing his head very close to that of his beloved adversary The
jackstraws have to be watched with a hawks eagerness since the
trembling can be discerned only by a keen eye but there were moments
when Stephen was willing to risk the loss of a battle if he could watch
Roses drooping eyelashes the delicate down on her pink cheek and the
feathery curls that broke away from her hair

He was looking at her now from a distance for she and Mite Shapley were
assisting Jed Towle to pile up the tin plates and tie the tin dippers
together Next she peered into one of the beanpots and seemed pleased
that there was still something in its depths then she gathered the
fragments neatly together in a basket and followed by her friend
clambered down the banks to a shady spot where the Boomshers otherwise
known as the Crambry family were lined up expectantly

It is not difficult to find a single fool in any community however
small but a family of fools is fortunately somewhat rarer Every
county however can boast of one foolfamily and York County is
always in the fashion with fools as with everything else The unique
muchquoted and undesirable Boomshers could not be claimed as
indigenous to the Saco valley for this branch was an offshoot of a
still larger tribe inhabiting a distant township Its beginnings were
shrouded in mystery There was a FrenchCanadian ancestor somewhere and
a Gipsy or Indian grandmother They had always intermarried from time
immemorial When one of the selectmen of their native place had been
asked why the Boomshers always married cousins and why the habit was
not discouraged he replied that he really didnt know he sposed they
felt it would be kind of odd to go right out and marry a stranger

Lest Boomsher seem an unusual surname it must be explained that the
actual name was French and could not be coped with by Edgewood or
Pleasant River being something quite as impossible to spell as to
pronounce As the family had lived for the last few years somewhere near
the Killick Cranberry Meadows they were calledand completely
described in the callingthe Crambry foolfamily A talented and much
traveled gentleman who once stayed over night at the Edgewood tavern
proclaimed it his opinion that Boomsher had been gradually corrupted
from Beaumarchais When he wrote the word on his visiting card and
showed it to Mr Wiley Old Kennebec had replied that in the judgment
of a man who had lived in large places and seen a turrible lot o life
such a name could never have been given either to a Christian or a
heathen familythat the way in which the letters was thrown together
into it and the way in which they was sounded when read out loud was
entirely agin reason It was true he said that Beaumarchais bein
such a fool name might a ben invented apurpose for a fool family
but he wouldnt hold even with callin em Boomsher Crambry was well
enough forem an a sight easier to speak

Stephen knew a good deal about the Crambrys for he passed their
socalled habitation in going to one of his woodlots It was only a
month before that he had found them all sitting outside their
brokendown fence surrounded by decrepit chairs sofas tables
bedsteads bits of carpet and stoves

Whats the matter he called out from his wagon There aint nothin
the matter said Alcestis Crambry Fathers dead an were dividin up
the furnerchure

Alcestis was the pride of the Crambrys and the list of his attainments
used often to be on his proud fathers lips It was he who was the
largest for his size in the family he who could tell his brothers
Paul and Arcadus by their looks he who knew a sour apple from a sweet
one the minute he bit it he who at the early age of ten was bright
enough to point to the cupboard and say Puddin dad

Alcestis had enjoyed in consequence of his unusual intellectual powers
some educational privileges and the Killick schoolmistress well
remembered his first day at the village seat of learning Reports of
what took place in this classic temple from day to day may have been
wafted to the dull ears of the boy who was not thought ready for school
until he had attained the ripe age of twelve It may even have been
that specific rumors of the signs symbols and hieroglyphics used in
educational institutions had reached him in the obscurity of his
cranberry meadows At all events when confronted by the alphabet chart
whose huge black capitals were intended to capture the wandering eyes of
the infant class Alcestis exhibited unusual almost unnatural
excitement

That is A my boy said the teacher genially as she pointed to the
first character on the chart

Good God is that A exclaimed Alcestis sitting down heavily on
the nearest bench And neither teacher nor scholars could discover
whether he was agreeably surprised or disappointed in the
letterwhether he had expected if he ever encountered it to find it
writhing in coils on the floor of a cage or whether it simply bore no
resemblance to the ideal already established in his mind

Mrs Wiley had once tried to make something of Mercy the oldest
daughter of the family but at the end of six weeks she announced that a
girl who couldnt tell whether the clock was going forrards or
backwards and who rubbed a pocket handkerchief as long as she did a
sheet would be no help in her household

The Crambrys had daily walked the five or six miles from their home to
the Edgewood bridge during the progress of the drive not only for the
social and intellectual advantages to be gained from the company
present but for the more solid compensation of a good meal They all
adored Rose partly because she gave them food and partly because she
was sparkling and pretty and wore pink dresses that caught their dull
eyes

The afternoon proved a lively one In the first place one of the
younger men slipped into the water between two logs part of a lot
chained together waiting to be let out of the boom The weight of the
mass higher up and the force of the current wedged him in rather
tightly and when he had been pried out he declared that he felt like
an apple after it had been squeezed in the cidermill so he drove home
and Rufus Waterman took his place

Two hours hard work followed this incident and at the end of that time
the bung that reached from the shore to Watermans Ledge the rock
where Pretty Quick met his fate was broken up and the logs that
composed it were started down river There remained now only the great
sidejam at Gray Rock This had been allowed to grow gathering logs as
they drifted past thus making higher water and a stronger current on
the other side of the rock and allowing an easier passage for the logs
at that point

All was excitement now for this particular piece of work accomplished
the boom above the falls would be turned out and the river would
once more be clear and clean at the Edgewood bridge

Small boys perching on the rocks with their heels hanging hands and
mouths full of red Astrakhan apples cheered their favorites to the
echo while the drivers shouted to one another and watched the signs and
signals of the boss who could communicate with them only in that way
so great was the roar of the water

The jam refused to yield to ordinary measures It was a difficult
problem for the rocky riverbed held many a snare and pitfall There
was a certain ledge under the water so artfully placed that every log
striking under its projecting edges would wedge itself firmly there
attracting others by its evil example

That galootboss ought to hev shoved his crew down to that jam this
mornin grumbled Old Kennebec to Alcestis Crambry who was always his
most loyal and attentive listener But he wouldnt take no advice not
if Pharaoh nor Boat nor Herod nor Nicodemus come right out o the Bible
an give it to him The logs air contrary today Sometimes theyll go
along as easy as an old shoe an other times theyll do nothin but
bung bung bung Theres a log nestlin down in the middle o that jam
that Ive ben watchin for a week Its a curous one to begin with
an then it has a mark on it that you can reconize it by Did ye ever
hear tell o George the Third King of England Alcestis or aint he
known over to the crambry medders Well once upon a time men used to go
through the forests over here an slash a mark on the trunks o the
biggest trees That was the royal sign as you might say an meant that
the tree was to be taken over to England to make masts an yardarms for
the Kings ships What made me think of it now is that the Kings mark
was an arrer an its an arrer thats on that there log Im showin ye
Well sir I seen it fust at Millikens Mills a Monday It was in
trouble then anits ben in trouble ever sence Thats allers the way
therell be one pesky crooked contrary consarned log that cant go
anywheres without gittin into difficulties You can yank it out an set
it afloat an before you hardly git your doggin iron off of it itll
be snarled up agin in some new place From the time its chopped down to
the day it gets to Saco it costs the Compny bout ten times its pesky
valler as lumber Now theyve sent over to Bensons for a team of
horses an I bate ye they cant git em I wish I was the boss on this
river Alcestis

I wish I was echoed the boy

Well your headfillin aint the right kind for a boss Alcestis an
youd better stick to dry land You set right down here while I go back
a piece an git the pipe out o my coat pocket I guess nothin aint
goin to happen for a few minutes

The surmise about the horses unlike most of Old Kennebecs proved to
be true Bensons pair had gone to Portland with a load of hay
accordingly the tackle was brought the rope was adjusted to a log and
five of the drivers standing on the riverbank attempted to drag it
from its intrenched position It refused to yield the fraction of an
inch Rufus and Stephen joined the five men and the augmented crew of
seven were putting all their strength on the rope when a cry went up
from the watchers on the bridge The dog had loosened suddenly and
the men were flung violently to the ground For a second they were
stunned both by the surprise and by the shock of the blow but in the
same moment the cry of the crowd swelled louder Alcestis Crambry had
stolen all unnoticed to the rope and had attempted to use his feeble
powers for the common good When then blow came he fell backward and
making no effort to control the situation slid over the bank and into
the water

Illustration IN A TWINKLING HE WAS IN THE WATER

The other Crambrys not realizing the danger laughed audibly but
there was no jeering from the bridge

Stephen had seen Alcestis slip and in the fraction of a moment had
taken off his boots and was coasting down the slippery rocks behind him
in a twinkling he was in the water almost as soon as the boy himself

Doggoned idjut exclaimed Old Kennebec tearfully Wuth the hull fool
family If I hednt a ben so old Id a jumped in myself for you
cant drownd a Wiley not without you tie nailkegs to their head an
feet an drop em in the falls

Alcestis who had neither brains courage nor experience had better
still the luck that follows the witless He was carried swiftly down
the current but only fifty feet away a long slender log wedged
between two low rocks on the shore jutted out over the water almost
touching its surface The boys clothes were admirably adapted to the
situation being full of enormous rents In some way the end of the log
caught in the rags of Alcestiss coat and held him just seconds enough
to enable Stephen to swim to him to seize him by the nape of the neck
to lift him on the log and thence to the shore It was a particularly
bad place for a landing and there was nothing to do but to lower ropes
and drag the drenched men to the high ground above

Alcestis came to his senses in ten or fifteen minutes and seemed as
bright as usual with a kind of added swagger at being the central
figure in a dramatic situation

I wonder you hednt stove your brains out when you landed so turrible
suddent on that rock at the foot of the bank said Mr Wiley to him

I should but I took good care to light on my head responded
Alcestis a cryptic remark which so puzzled Old Kennebec that he mused
over it for some hours




HEARTS AND OTHER HEARTS


Stephen had brought a change of clothes as he had a habit of being
ducked once at least during the day and since there was a halt in the
proceedings and no need of his services for an hour or two he found
Rose and walked with her to a secluded spot where they could watch the
logs and not be seen by the people

You frightened everybody almost to death jumping into the river
chided Rose

Stephen laughed They thought I was a fool to save a fool I suppose

Perhaps not as bad as that but it did seem reckless

I know and the boy no doubt would be better off dead but so should
I be if I could have let him die

Rose regarded this strange point of view for a moment and then silently
acquiesced in it She was constantly doing this and she often felt that
her mental horizon broadened in the act but she could not be sure that
Stephen grew any dearer to her because of his moral altitudes

Besides Stephen argued I happened to be nearest to the river and
it was my job

How do you always happen to be nearest to the people in trouble and
why is it always your job

If there are any rewards for good conduct being distributed Im right
in line with my hand stretched out Stephen replied with meaning in
his voice

Rose blushed under her flowery hat as he led the way to a bench under a
sycamore tree that overhung the water

She had almost convinced herself that she was as much in love with
Stephen Waterman as it was in her nature to be with anybody He was
handsome in his big way kind generous temperate well educated and
welltodo No fault could be found with his family for his mother had
been a teacher and his father though a farmer a college graduate
Stephen himself had had one year at Bowdoin but had been recalled as
the head of the house when his father died That was a severe blow but
his mothers death three years after was a grief never to be quite
forgotten Rose too was the child of a gently bred mother and all her
instincts were refined Yes Stephen in himself satisfied her in all the
larger wants of her nature but she had an unsatisfied hunger for the
worldthe world of Portland where her cousins lived or better
still the world of Boston of which she heard through Mrs Wealthy
Brooks whose nephew Claude often came to visit her in Edgewood Life on
a farm a mile and a half distant from postoffice and stores life in
the house with Rufus who was rumored to be somewhat wild and
unsteadythis prospect seemed a trifle dull and uneventful to the
trivial part of her though to the better part it was enough The better
part of her loved Stephen Waterman dimly feeling the richness of his
nature the tenderness of his affection the strength of his character
Rose was not destitute either of imagination or sentiment She did not
relish this constant weighing of Stephen in the balance he was too good
to be weighed and considered She longed to be carried out of herself on
a wave of rapturous assent but something seemed to hold her backsome
seed of discontent with the mans environment and circumstances some
germ of longing for a gayer brighter more varied life No amount of
selfsearching or argument could change the situation She always loved
Stephen more or less more when he was away from her because she never
approved his collars nor the set of his shirt bosom and as he
naturally wore these despised articles of apparel whenever he proposed
to her she was always lukewarm about marrying him and settling down on
the River Farm Still today she discovered in herself with positive
gratitude a warmer feeling for him than she had experienced before He
wore a new and becoming gray flannel shirt with the soft turnover
collar that belonged to it and a blue tie the color of his kind eyes
She knew that he had shaved his beard at her request not long ago and
that when she did not like the effect as much as she had hoped he had
meekly grown a mustache for her sake it did seem as if a man could
hardly do more to please an exacting ladylove

And she had admired him unreservedly when he pulled off his boots and
jumped into the river to save Alcestis Crambrys life without giving a
single thought to his own

And was there ever after all such a noble devoted unselfish fellow
or a better brother And would she not despise herself for rejecting him
simply because he was countrified and because she longed to see the
world of the fashionplates in the magazines

The logs are so like people she exclaimed as they sat down I could
name nearly every one of them for somebody in the village Look at Mite
Shapley that dancing little one slipping over the falls and skimming
along the top of the water keeping out of all the deep places and
never once touching the rocks

Stephen fell into her mood Theres Squire Anderson coming down
crosswise and bumping everything in reach You know hes always buying
lumber and logs without knowing what he is going to do with them They
just lie and rot by the roadside The boys always say that a toadstool
is the old Squires mark on a log

And that stout clumsy one is Short DennettWhat are you doing
Stephen

Only building a fence round this clump of harebells Stephen replied
Theyve just got well rooted and if the boys come skidding down the
bank with their spiked shoes the poor things will never hold up their
heads again Now theyre safeOh look Rose There come the minister
and his wife

A portly couple of peeled logs exactly matched in size came
ponderously over the falls together rose within a second of each other
joined again and swept under the bridge side by side

Andoh oh Dr and Mrs Cram just after them Isnt that funny
laughed Rose as a very long slender pair of pines swam down as close
to each other as if they had been glued in that position Rose thought
as she watched them who but Stephen would have cared what became of the
clump of delicate harebells How gentle such a man would be to a woman
How tender his touch would be if she were ill or in trouble

Several single logs followedcrooked ones stolid ones adventurous
ones feeble swimmers deep divers Some of them tried to start a small
jam on their own account others stranded themselves for good and all
as Rose and Stephen sat there side by side with little Dan Cupid for an
invisible third on the bench

There never was anything so like people Rose repeated leaning
forward excitedly And upon my word the minister and doctor couples
are still together I wonder if theyll get as far as the falls at
Union That would be an odd place to part wouldnt itUnion Stephen
saw his opportunity and seized it

Theres a reason Rose why two logs go down stream better than one
and get into less trouble They make a wider path create more force
and a better current Its the same way with men and women Oh Rose
there isnt a man in the world thats loved you as long or knows how to
love you any better than I do Youre just like a white birch sapling
and Im a great clumsy fir tree but if youll only trust yourself to
me Rose Ill take you safely down river

Stephens big hand closed on Roses little one she returned its pressure
softly and gave him the kiss that with her as with him meant a promise
for all the years to come The truth and passion in the man had broken
the girls bonds for the moment Her vision was clearer and realizing
the treasures of love and fidelity that were being offered her she
accepted them half unconscious that she was not returning them in kind
How is the belle of two villages to learn that she should thank Heaven
fasting for a good mans love

And Stephen He went home in the dusk not knowing whether his feet were
touching the solid earth or whether he was treading upon rainbows

Roses pink calico seemed to brush him as he walked in the path that was
wide enough only for one His solitude was peopled again when he fed the
cattle for Roses face smiled at him from the haymow and when he
strained the milk Rose held the pans

His nightly tasks over he went out and took his favorite seat under the
apple tree All was still save for the crickets ceaseless chirp the
soft thud of an August sweeting dropping in the grass and the
swishswash of the water against his boat tethered in the Willow Cove

He remembered when he first saw Rose for that must have been when he
began to love her though he was only fourteen and quite unconscious
that the first seed had been dropped in the rich soil of his boyish
heart

Illustration ROSE ILL TAKE YOU SAFELY

He was seated on the kerosene barrel in the Edgewood postoffice which
was also the general country store where newspapers letters molasses
nails salt codfish hairpins sugar liver pills canned goods beans
and ginghams dwelt in genial proximity When she entered just a little
pinkandwhite slip of a thing with a tin pail in her hand and a
sunbonnet falling off her wavy hair Stephen suddenly stopped swinging
his feet She gravely announced her wants reading them from a bit of
paper1 quart molasses 1 package ginger 1 lb cheese 2 pairs shoe
laces 1 card shirt buttons

While the storekeeper drew off the molasses she exchanged shy looks with
Stephen who clean welldressed and carefully mothered as he was
felt all at once uncouth and awkward rather as if he were some clumsy
lout pitchforked into the presence of a fairy queen He offered her the
little bunch of bachelors buttons he held in his hand augury of the
future had he known itand she accepted them with a smile She
dropped her memorandum he picked it up and she smiled again doing
still more fatal damage than in the first instance No words were
spoken but Rose even at ten had less need of them than most of her
sex for her dimples aided by dancing eyes length of lashes and curve
of lips quite took the place of conversation The dimples tempted
assented denied corroborated deplored protested sympathized while
the intoxicated beholder cudgeled his brain for words or deeds which
should provoke and evoke more and more dimples

The storekeeper hung the molasses pail over Roses right arm and tucked
the packages under her left and as he opened the mosquito netting door
to let her pass out she looked back at Stephen perched on the kerosene
barrel Just a little girl a little glance a little dimple and
Stephen was never quite the same again The years went on and the boy
became man yet no other image had ever troubled the deep placid waters
of his heart Now after many denials the hopes and longings of his
nature had been answered and Rose had promised to marry him He would
sacrifice his passion for logging and driving in the future and become
a staid farmer and man of affairs only giving himself a river holiday
now and then How still and peaceful it was under the trees and how
glad his mother would be to think that the old farm would wake from its
sleep and a womans light foot be heard in the sunny kitchen

Heaven was full of silent stars and there was a moonglade on the water
that stretched almost from him to Rose His heart embarked on that
golden pathway and sailed on it to the farther shore The river was free
of logs and under the light of the moon it shone like a silver mirror
The soft wind among the fir branches breathed Roses name the river
rippling against the shore sang Rose and as Stephen sat there
dreaming of the future his dreams too could have been voiced in one
word and that word Rose




THE LITTLE HOUSE


The autumn days flew past like shuttles in a loom The river reflected
the yellow foliage of the white birch and the scarlet of the maples The
wayside was bright with goldenrod with the red tassels of the sumac
with the purple frostflower and feathery clematis

If Rose was not as happy as Stephen she was quietly content and felt
that she had more to be grateful for than most girls for Stephen
surprised her with first one evidence and then another of thoughtful
generosity In his heart of hearts he felt that Rose was not wholly his
that she reserved withheld something and it was the subjugation of
this rebellious province that he sought He and Rose had agreed to wait
a year for their marriage in which time Roses cousin would finish
school and be ready to live with the old people meanwhile Stephen had
learned that his maiden aunt would be glad to come and keep house for
Rufus The work at the River Farm was too hard for a girl so he had
persuaded himself of late and the house was so far from the village
that Rose was sure to be lonely He owned a couple of acres between his
place and the Edgewood bridge and here one afternoon only a month
after their engagement he took Rose to see the foundations of a little
house he was building for her It was to be only a storyandahalf
cottage of six small rooms the two upper chambers to be finished off
later on Stephen had placed it well back from the road leaving space
in front for what was to be a most wonderful arrangement of flowerbeds
yet keeping a strip at the back on the riverbrink for a small
vegetable garden There had been a house there years beforeso many
years that the blackened ruins were entirely overgrown but a few elms
and an old appleorchard remained to shade the new dwelling and give
welcome to the coming inmates

Stephen had fifteen hundred dollars in bank he could turn his hand to
almost anything and his love was so deep that Roses plumbline had
never sounded bottom accordingly he was able with the help of two
steady workers to have the roof on before the first of November The
weather was clear and fine and by Thanksgiving clapboards shingles
two coats of brown paint and even the blinds had all been added This
exhibition of reckless energy on Stephens part did not wholly commend
itself to the neighborhood

Steves too turrible spry said Roses grandfather hell trip
himself up some o these times

You never will remarked his better half sagely

The resks in life come along fast enough without runnin to meet em
continued the old man Theres good dough in Rose but it aint moren
half riz Let somebody come along an drop in a little more yeast or
set the dish a little mite nearer the stove an youll see whatll
happen

Steves kept house for himself some time an I guess he knows more
about breadmakin than you do

There dont nobody know moren I do about nothin when my pipes
drawin real good an nobodys thornin me to go to work replied Mr
Wiley but nobodys willin to take the advice of a man thats seen the
world an lived in large places an the risin generation is in a
turrible hurry I don know how t is young folks air allers settin
the clock forrard an the old ones puttin it back

Did you ketch anything for dinner when you was out this mornin asked
his wife No I fished an fished till I was about ready to drop an
I did git a few shiners but land they want as big as the worms I was
ketchin em with so I pitched em back in the water an quit

During the progress of these remarks Mr Wiley opened the door under the
sink and from beneath a huge iron pot drew a round tray loaded with a
glass pitcher and half a dozen tumblers which he placed carefully on
the kitchen table

This is the last days option Ive got on this lemonadeset he said
an if Im gointo Biddeford tomorrer Ive got to make up my mind here
an now

With this observation he took off his shoes climbed in his stocking
feet to the vantage ground of a kitchen chair and lifted a stone china
pitcher from a corner of the highest cupboard shelf where it had been
hidden

This lemonades gittin kind o dusty he complained I callated to
hev a kind of a spree on it when I got through choosin Roses weddin
present but I guess the pigll he v to help me out

The old man filled one of the glasses from the pitcher pulled up the
kitchen shades to the top put both hands in his pockets and walked
solemnly round the table gazing at his offering from every possible
point of view

There had been three lemonade sets in the window of a Biddeford crockery
store when Mr Wiley chanced to pass by and he had brought home the
blue and green one on approval

To the casual eye it would have appeared as quite uniquely hideous until
the red and yellow or the purple and orange ones had been seen after
that no human being could have made a decision where each was so
unparalleled in its ugliness and Old Kennebecs confusion of mind would
have been perfectly understood by the connoisseur

How do you like it with the lemonade in mother he inquired eagerly
The thing that plagues me most is that the red an yaller one I hed
home last week lights up bettern this an I believe Ill settle on
that for as I was thinkin last night in bed lemonade is mostly an
evenin drink an Rose wont be usin the set much by daylight Root
beer looks the hansomest in this purple set but Rose loves lemonade
bettern beer so I guess Ill pack up this one an change it tomorrer
Mebbe when I get it out o sight an give the lemonade to the pig Ill
be easier in my mind

In the opinion of the community at large Stephens forehandedness in the
matter of preparations for his marriage was imprudence and his desire
for neatness and beauty flagrant extravagance The house itself was a
foolish idea it was thought but there were extenuating circumstances
for the maiden aunt really needed a home and Rufus was likely to marry
before long and take his wife to the River Farm It was to be hoped in
his case that he would avoid the snares of beauty and choose a good
stout girl who would bring the dairy back to what it was in Mrs
Watermans time

All winter long Stephen labored on the inside of the cottage mostly by
himself He learned all trades in succession Love being his only
master He had many odd days to spare from his farm work and if he had
not found days he would have taken nights Scarcely a nail was driven
without Roses advice and when the plastering was hard and dry the
wallpapers were the result of weeks of consultation

Among the quiet joys of life there is probably no other so deep so
sweet so full of trembling hope and delight as the building and making
of a homea home where two lives are to be merged in one and flow on
together a home full of mysterious and delicious possibilities hidden
in a future which is always rosecolored

Roses sweet little nature broadened under Stephens influence but she
had her moments of discontent and unrest always followed quickly by
remorse

At the Thanksgiving sociable some one had observed her turquoise
engagement ringsome one who said that such a hand was worthy of a
diamond that turquoises were a pretty color but that there was only
one stone for an engagement ring and that was a diamond At the
Christmas dance the same some one had said her waltzing would make her
all the rage in Boston She wondered if it were true and wondered
whether if she had not promised to marry Stephen some splendid being
from a city would have descended from his heights bearing diamonds in
his hand Not that she would have accepted them she only wondered
These disloyal thoughts came seldom and she put them resolutely away
devoting herself with all the greater assiduity to her muslin curtains
and ruffled pillowshams Stephen too had his momentary pangs There
were times when he could calm his doubts only by working on the little
house The mere sight of the beloved floors and walls and ceilings
comforted his heart and brought him good cheer

The winter was a cold one so bitterly cold that even the rapid water at
the Gray Rock was a mass of curdled yellow ice something that had only
occurred once or twice before within the memory of the oldest
inhabitant

It was also a very gay season for Pleasant River and Edgewood Never had
there been so many cardparties sleigh rides and tavern dances and
never such wonderful skating The river was one gleaming glittering
thoroughfare of ice from Millikens Mills to the dam at the Edgewood
bridge At sundown bonfires were built here and there on the mirror like
surface and all the young people from the neighboring villages gathered
on the ice while detachments of merry rosycheeked boys and girls
those who preferred coasting met at the top of Brigadier Hill from
which one could get a longer and more perilous slide than from any other
point in the township

Claude Merrill in his occasional visits from Boston was very much in
evidence at the Saturday evening ice parties He was not an artist at
the sport himself but he was especially proficient in the art of
strapping on a ladys skates and murmuringas he adjusted the last
buckleThe prettiest foot and ankle on the river It cannot be
denied that this compliment gave secret pleasure to the fair village
maidens who received it but it was a pleasure accompanied by electric
shocks of excitement A girls foot might perhaps be mentioned if a
fellow were daring enough but the line was rigidly drawn at the ankle
which was not a part of the human frame ever alluded to in the polite
society of Edgewood at that time

Rose in her red linseywoolsey dress and her squirrel furs and cap was
the life of every gathering and when Stephen took her hand and they
glided up stream alone together in the crowd he used to wish that they
might skate on and on up the crystal icepath of the river to the moon
itself whither it seemed to lead them




THE GARDEN OF EDEN


But the Saco all this time was meditating of its surprises The snapping
cold weather and the depth to which the water was frozen were aiding it
in its preparation for the greatest event of the season On a certain
gray Saturday in March after a week of mild temperature it began to
rain as if after months of snowing it really enjoyed a new form of
entertainment Sunday dawned with the very floodgates of heaven
opening so it seemed All day long the river was rising under its miles
of unbroken ice rising at the threatening rate of four inches an hour

Edgewood went to bed as usual that night for the bridge at that point
was set too high to be carried away by freshets but at other villages
whose bridges were in less secure position there was little sleep and
much anxiety

At midnight a cry was heard from the men watching at Millikens Mills
The great ice jam had parted from Rolfes Island and was swinging out
into the open pushing everything before it All the ablebodied men in
the village turned out of bed and with lanterns in hand began to clear
the stores and mills for it seemed that everything near the river banks
must go before that avalanche of ice

Stephen and Rufus were there helping to save the property of their
friends and neighbors Rose and Mite Shapley had stayed the night with a
friend and all three girls were shivering with fear and excitement as
they stood near the bridge watching the nevertobeforgotten sight It
is needless to say that the Crambry family was on hand for whatever
instincts they may have lacked the instinct for being on the spot when
anything was happening was present in them to the most remarkable
extent The town was supporting them in modest winter quarters somewhat
nearer than Killick to the centre of civilization and the first alarm
brought them promptly to the scene Mrs Crambry remarking at intervals
If Id known thered be so many out Id ought to have worn my bunnit
but I aint got no bunnit an if I had they say I aint got no head to
wear it on

By the time the jam neared the falls it had grown with its
accumulations until it was made up of tier after tier of huge ice
cakes piled side by side and one upon another with heaps of trees and
branches and drifting lumber holding them in place Some of the blocks
stood erect and towered like icebergs and these glittering in the
lights of the twinkling lanterns pushed solemnly forward cracking
crushing and cutting everything in their way When the great mass
neared the planing mill on the east shore the girls covered their eyes
expecting to hear the crash of the falling building but impelled by
the force of some mysterious current it shook itself ponderously and
then with one magnificent movement slid up the river bank tier
following tier in grand confusion This left a water way for the main
drift the ice broke in every direction and down down down from
Bonnie Eagle and Moderation swept the harvest of the winter freezing It
came thundering over the dam bringing boats farming implements posts
supports and every sort of floating lumber with it and cutting under
the flour mill tipped it cleverly over on its side and went crashing on
its way down river At Edgewood it pushed colossal blocks of ice up the
banks into the roadway piling them end upon end ten feet in air Then
tearing and rumbling and booming through the narrows it covered the
intervale at Pleasant Point and made a huge ice bridge below Union
Falls a bridge so solid that it stood there for days a sight for all
the neighboring villages

This exciting event would have forever set apart this winter from all
others in Stephens memory even had it not been also the winter when he
was building a house for his future wife But afterwards in looking
back on the wild night of the ice freshet Stephen remembered that
Roses manner was strained and cold and evasive and that when he had
seen her talking with Claude Merrill it had seemed to him that that
whippersnapper had looked at her as no honorable man in Edgewood ever
looked at an engaged girl He recalled his throb of gratitude that
Claude lived at a safe distance and his subsequent pang of remorse at
doubting for an instant Roses fidelity

So at length April came the Saco was still high turbid and angry and
the boys were waiting at Limington Falls for the Ossipee drive to
begin Stephen joined them there for he was restless and the river
called him as it did every spring Each stubborn log that he
encountered gave him new courage and power of overcoming The rush of
the water the noise and roar and dash the exposure and danger all
made the blood run in his veins like new wine When he came back to the
farm all the cobwebs had been blown from his brain and his first
interview with Rose was so intoxicating that he went immediately to
Portland and bought in a kind of secret penitence for his former
fears a pale pinkflowered wallpaper for the bedroom in the new home
It had once been voted down by the entire advisory committee Mrs Wiley
said pink was foolish and was always sure to fade and the border being
a mass of solid roses was five cents a yard virtually a prohibitive
price Mr Wiley said he should hate to hev a spell of sickness an lay
abed in a room where there was things growin all over the place He
thought roughplastered walls where you could lay an count the spots
where the roof leaked was the most entertainin in sickness Rose had
longed for the lovely pattern but had sided dutifully with the prudent
majority so that it was with a feeling of unauthorized and illegitimate
joy that Stephen papered the room at night a few strips at a time

On the third evening when he had removed all signs of his work he
lighted two kerosene lamps and two candles finding the effect under
this illumination almost too brilliant and beautiful for belief Rose
should never see it now he determined until the furniture was in
place They had already chosen the kitchen and bedroom things though
they would not be needed for some months but the rest was to wait until
summer when there would be the haymoney to spend

Stephen did not go back to the River Farm till one oclock that night
the pink bedroom held him in fetters too powerful to break It looked
like the garden of Eden he thought To be sure it was only fifteen
feet square Eden might have been a little larger possibly but
otherwise the pink bedroom had every advantage The pattern of roses
growing on a trellis was brighter than any flowerbed in June and the
borderwell if the border had been five dollars a foot Stephen would
not have grudged the money when he saw the twenty running yards of rosy
bloom rioting under the white ceiling

Before he blew out the last light he raised it high above his head and
took one fond final look Its the only place I ever saw he thought
that is pretty enough for her She will look just as if she was growing
here with all the other flowers and I shall always think of it as the
garden of Eden I wonder if I got the license and the ring and took her
by surprise whether shed be married in June instead of August I
could be all ready if I could only persuade her

At this moment Stephen touched the summit of happiness and it is a
curious coincidence that as he was dreaming in his garden of Eden the
serpent having just arrived at Edgewood was sleeping peacefully at the
house of Mrs Brooks

It was the serpents fourth visit that season and he explained to
inquiring friends that his former employer had sold the business and
that the new management while reorganizing had determined to enlarge
the premises the three clerks who had been retained having two weeks
vacation with half pay

It is extraordinary how frequently wise serpents are retained by the
management on half or even full salary while the services of the
harmless doves are dispensed with and they are set free to flutter
where they will




THE SERPENT


Rose Wiley had the brightest eyes in Edgewood It was impossible to look
at her without realizing that her physical sight was perfect What
mysterious species of blindness is it that descends now and then upon
human creatures and renders them incapable of judgment or
discrimination

Claude Merrill was a glove salesman in a Boston fancygoods store The
calling itself is undoubtedly respectable and it is quite conceivable
that a man can sell gloves and still be a man but Claude Merrill was a
manikin He inhabited a very narrow space behind a very short counter
but to him it seemed the earth and the fullness thereof

When irreproachably neat and even exquisite in dress he gave a
Napoleonic glance at his array of gloveboxes to see if the female
assistant had put them in proper order for the day when with that
wonderful eye for detail that had wafted him to his present height of
power he pounced upon the powdersprinklers and found them as he
expected empty when with masterly judgment he had made up and
ticketed a basket of misfits and odd sizes to attract the eyes of women
who were their human counterparts he felt himself bursting with the
pride and pomp of circumstance His cambric handkerchief adjusted in his
coat with the monogram corner well displayed a last touch to the
carefully trained lock on his forehead and he was ready for his
customers

Six did you say miss I should have thought five and three
quartersAttend to that gentleman Miss Dix please I am very busy

Sixandahalf gray suede Here they are an exquisite shade Shall I
try them on The right hand if you will Perhaps youd better remove
your elegant ring I shouldnt like to have anything catch in the
setting

Miss Dix Sixandahalf black glaceupper shelf third boxfor this
lady Shes in a hurry We shall see you often after this I hope
madam

No we dont keep silk or lisle gloves We have no call for them our
customers prefer kid

Oh but he was in his element was Claude Merrill though the glamour
that surrounded him in the minds of the Edgewood girls did not emanate
wholly from his finicky little person something of it was the glamour
that belonged to Bostonremote fashionable gay rich almost
inaccessible Boston which none could see without the expenditure of
five or six dollars in railway fare with the added extravagance of a
night in a hotel if one would explore it thoroughly and come home
possessed of all its illimitable treasures of wisdom and experience

When Claude came to Edgewood for a Sunday or to spend a vacation with
his aunt he brought with him something of the magic of a metropolis
Suddenly to Roses eye Stephen looked larger and clumsier his shoes
were not the proper sort his clothes were ordinary his neckties were
years behind the fashion Stephens dancing compared with Claudes was
as the deliberate motion of an ox to the hopping of a neat little robin
When Claude took a girls hand in the grand rightandleft it was as
if he were about to try on a delicate glove the manner in which he
held his lady in the polka or schottische made her seem a queen Mite
Shapley was so affected by it that when Rufus attempted to encircle her
for the mazurka she exclaimed Dont act as if you were spearing logs
Rufus

Of the two men Stephen had more to say but Claude said more He was
thought brilliant in conversation but what wonder when one considered
his advantages and his dazzling experiences He had customers who were
worth their thousands ladies whose fingers never touched dishwater
ladies who wouldnt buy a glove of anybody else if they went barehanded
to the grave He lived with his sister Maude Arthurlena in a house where
there were twentytwo other boarders who could be seated at meals all at
the same time so immense was the diningroom He ate his dinner at a
restaurant daily and expended twentyfive cents for it without
blenching He went to the theatre once a week and was often accompanied
by lady friends who were elegant dressers

In a moment of wrath Stephen had called him a counterjumper but it
was a libel So short and rough a means of exit from his place of power
was wholly beneath Claudes dignity It was with a Pardon me Miss
Dix that the noon hour having arrived he squeezed by that slave and
victim and raising the hinged board that separated his kingdom from
that of the ribbon department passed out of the store hat in hand
serene in the consciousness that though other clerks might nibble
luncheon from a brown paper bag he would speedily be indulging in an
expensive repast and Miss Dix knew it and it was a part of his almost
invincible attraction for her

It seemed flying in the face of Providence to decline the attentions of
such a gorgeous butterfly of fashion simply because one was engaged to
marry another man at some distant day

All Edgewood femininity united in saying that there never was such a
perfect gentleman as Claude Merrill and during the time when his
popularity was at its height Rose lost sight of the fact that Stephen
could have furnished the stuff for a dozen Claudes and have had enough
left for an ordinary man besides

April gave place to May and a veil hung between the loversan
intangible gossamerlike thing not to be seen with the naked eye but
oh so plainly to be felt Rose hid herself thankfully behind it while
Stephen had not courage to lift a corner She had twice been seen
driving with Claude Merrillthat Stephen knew but she had explained
that there were errands to be done that her grandfather had taken the
horse and that Mr Merrills escort had been both opportune and
convenient for these practical reasons Claude was everywhere present
the centre of attraction the observed of all observers He was
irresistible contagious almost epidemic Rose was now gay now silent
now affectionate now distant now coquettish in fine everything that
was capricious mysterious agitating incomprehensible

One morning Alcestis Crambry went to the postoffice for Stephen and
brought him back the newspapers and letters He had hung about the River
Farm so much that Stephen finally gave him bed and food in exchange for
numberless small errands Rufus was temporarily confined in a dark room
with some strange pain and trouble in his eyes and Alcestis proved of
use in many ways He had always been Roses slave and had often brought
messages and notes from the Brier Neighborhood so that when Stephen saw
a folded note among the papers his heart gave a throb of anticipation

The note was brief and when he had glanced through it he said This is
not mine Alcestis it belongs to Miss Rose Go straight back and give
it to her as you were told and another time keep your wits about you
or Ill send you back to Killick

Alcestis Crambrys ideas on all subjects were extremely vague Claude
Merrill had given him a letter for Rose but his notion was that
anything that belonged to her belonged to Stephen and the Waterman
place was much nearer than the Wileys particularly at dinnertime

When the boy had slouched away Stephen sat under the apple tree now a
mass of roseate bloom and buried his face in his hands

It was not precisely a loveletter that he had read nevertheless it
blackened the light of the sun for him Claude asked Rose to meet him
anywhere on the road to the station and to take a little walk as he was
leaving that afternoon and could not bear to say goodby to her in the
presence of her grandmother Under the circumstances he wrote deeply
underlining the words I cannot remain a moment longer in Edgewood
where I have been so happy and so miserable He did not refer to the
fact that the time limit on his returnticket expired that day for his
dramatic instinct told him that such sordid matters have no place in
heroics

Stephen sat motionless under the tree for an hour deciding on some plan
of action

He had work at the little house but he did not dare go there lest he
should see the face of dead Love looking from the windows of the pink
bedroom dead Love cold sad merciless His cheeks burned as he
thought of the marriage license and the gold ring hidden away upstairs
in the drawer of his shaving stand What a romantic fool he had been to
think he could hasten the glad day by a single moment What a piece of
boyish folly it had been and how it shamed him in his own eyes

When train time drew near he took his boat and paddled down stream If
for the Finland lovers reindeer there was but one path in all the
world and that the one that led to Her so it was for Stephens canoe
which had it been set free on the river by day or by night might have
floated straight to Rose

He landed at the usual place a bit of sandy shore near the Wiley house
and walked drearily up the bank through the woods Under the shade of
the pines the white stars of the hepatica glistened and the pale
anemones were coming into bloom Partridgeberries glowed red under
their glossy leaves and clumps of violets sweetened the air Squirrels
chattered woodpeckers tapped thrushes sang but Stephen was blind and
deaf to all the sweet harbingers of spring

Just then he heard voices realizing with a throb of delight that at
any rate Rose had not left home to meet Claude as he had asked her to
do Looking through the branches he saw the two standing together Mrs
Brookss horse with the offensive trunk in the back of the wagon being
hitched to a tree near by There was nothing in the tableau to stir
Stephen to fury but he read between the lines and suffered as he
readsuffered and determined to sacrifice himself if he must so that
Rose could have what she wanted this miserable apology for a man He
had never been the husband for Rose she must take her place in a larger
community worthy of her beauty and charm

Claude was talking and gesticulating ardently Roses head was bent and
the tears were rolling down her cheeks Suddenly Claude raised his hat
and with a passionate gesture of renunciation walked swiftly to the
wagon and looking back once drove off with the utmost speed of which
the Brookss horse was capableRose waving him a farewell with one
hand and wiping her eyes with the other




THE TURQUOISE RING


Stephen stood absolutely still in front of the opening in the trees and
as Rose turned she met him face to face She had never dreamed his eyes
could be so stern his mouth so hard and she gave a sob like a child

You seem to be in trouble Stephen said in a voice so cold she thought
it could not be his

I am not in trouble exactly Rose stammered concealing her
discomfiture as well as possible I am a little unhappy because I have
made some one else unhappy and now that you know it you will be
unhappy too and angry besides I suppose though youve seen everything
there was to see

There is no occasion for sorrow Stephen said I didnt mean to break
in on any interview I came over to give you back your freedom If you
ever cared enough for me to marry me the time has gone by I am willing
to own that I overpersuaded you but I am not the man to take a girl
against her inclinations so we will say goodby and end the thing here
and now I can only wishhere his smothered rage at fate almost choked
himthat when you were selecting another husband you had chosen a
whole man

Rose quivered with the scorn of his tone Size isnt everything she
blazed

Not in bodies perhaps but it counts for something in hearts and
brains and it is convenient to have a sense of honor thats at least as
big as a grain of mustardseed

Claude Merrill is not dishonorable Rose exclaimed impetuously or at
least he isnt as bad as you think he has never asked me to marry him

Then he probably was not quite ready to speak or perhaps you were not
quite ready to hear retorted Stephen bitterly but dont let us have
wordstherell be enough to regret without adding those I have seen
ever since New Years that you were not really happy or contented only
I wouldnt allow it to myself I kept hoping against hope that I was
mistaken There have been times when I would have married you willing
or unwilling but I didnt love you so well then and now that theres
another man in the case its different and Im strong enough to do the
right thing Follow your heart and be happy in a year or two I shall be
glad I had the grit to tell you so Goodby Rose

Rose pale with amazement summoned all her pride and drawing the
turquoise engagement ring from her finger handed it silently to
Stephen hiding her face as he flung it vehemently down the riverbank
His dull eyes followed it and half uncomprehendingly saw it settle and
glisten in a nest of brown pineneedles Then he put out his hand for a
last clasp and strode away without a word

Illustration HIDING HER FACE AS HE FLUNG IT DOWN THE RIVERBANK

Presently Rose heard first the scrape of his boat on the sand then the
soft sound of his paddles against the water then nothing but the
squirrels and the woodpeckers and the thrushes then not even
thesenothing but the beating of her own heart

She sat down heavily feeling as if she were wide awake for the first
time in many weeks How had things come to this pass with her

Claude Merrill had flattered her vanity and given her some moments of
restlessness and dissatisfaction with her lot but he had not until
today really touched her heart or tempted her even momentarily from
her allegiance to Stephen His eyes had always looked unspeakable
things his voice had seemed to breathe feelings that he had never dared
put in words but today he had really stirred her for although he had
still been vague it was easy to see that his love for her had passed
all bounds of discretion She remembered his impassioned farewells his
despair his doubt as to whether he could forget her by plunging into
the vortex of business or whether he had better end it all in the
river as so many other brokenhearted fellows had done She had been
touched by his misery even against her better judgment and she had
intended to confess it all to Stephen sometime telling him that she
should never again accept attentions from a stranger lest a tragedy
like this should happen twice in a lifetime

She had imagined that Stephen would be his largeminded greathearted
magnanimous self and beg her to forget this fascinating willothewisp
by resting in his deeper serener love She had meant to be contrite and
faithful praying nightly that poor Claude might live down his present
anguish of which she had been the innocent cause

Instead what had happened She had been put altogether in the wrong
Stephen had almost cast her off and that too without argument He had
given her her liberty before she had asked for it taking it for
granted without question that she desired to be rid of him Instead of
comforting her in her remorse or sympathizing with her for so nobly
refusing to shine in Claudes larger world of Boston Stephen had
assumed that she was disloyal in every particular

And pray how was she to cope with such a disagreeable and complicated
situation

It would not be long before the gossips rolled under their tongues the
delicious morsel of a broken engagement and sooner or later she must
brave the displeasure of her grandmother

And the little housethat was worse than anything Her tears flowed
faster as she thought of Stephens joy in it of his faithful labor of
the savings he had invested in it She hated and despised her self when
she thought of the house and for the first time in her life she
realized the limitations of her nature the poverty of her ideals

What should she do She had lost Stephen and ruined his life Now in
order that she need not blight a second career must she contrive to
return Claudes love To be sure she thought it seemed indecent to
marry any other man than Stephen when they had built a house together
and chosen wallpapers and a kitchen stove and diningroom chairs but
was it not the only way to evade the difficulties

Suppose that Stephen in a fit of pique should ask somebody else to
share the new cottage

As this dreadful possibility came into view Roses sobs actually
frightened the birds and the squirrels She paced back and forth under
the trees wondering how she could have been engaged to a man for eight
months and know so little about him as she seemed to know about Stephen
Waterman today Who would have believed he could be so autocratic so
severe so unapproachable Who could have foreseen that she Rose Wiley
would ever be given up to another manhanded over as coolly as if she
had been a bale of cotton She wanted to return Claude Merrills love
because it was the only way out of the tangle but at the moment she
almost hated him for making so much trouble for hurting Stephen for
abasing her in her own eyes and above all for giving her rustic lover
the chance of impersonating an injured emperor

It did not simplify the situation to have Mite Shapley come in during
the evening and run upstairs uninvited to sit on the toot of her bed
and chatter

Rose had closed her blinds and lay in the dark pleading a headache

Mite was in high feather She had met Claude Merrill going to the
station that afternoon He was much too early for the train which the
station agent reported to be behind time so he had asked her to take a
drive She didnt know how it happened for he looked at his watch every
now and then but anyway they got to laughing and carrying on and
when they came back to the station the train had gone Wasnt that the
greatest joke of the season What did Rose suppose they did next

Rose didnt know and didnt care her head ached too badly

Well they had driven to Wareham and Claude had hired a livery team
there and had been taken into Portland with his trunk and she had
brought Mrs Brookss horse back to Edgewood Wasnt that ridiculous
And hadnt she cut out Rose where she least expected

Rose was distinctly apathetic and Mite Shapley departed after a very
brief call leaving behind her an entirely new train of thought

If Claude Merrill were so loveblighted that he could only by the
greatest selfcontrol keep from flinging himself into the river how
could he conceal his sufferings so completely from Mite Shapleylittle
shallowpated scheming coquette

So that pretty Merrill feller has gone has he mother inquired Old
Kennebec that night as he took off his wet shoes and warmed his feet at
the kitchen oven Well it aint a mite too soon I allers distrust
that pinkanwhite rosyposy kind of a man One of the most turrible
things that ever happened in Gardner was brought about by jest sech a
feller Mothers hednt hardly ought to name their boy babies Claude
without they expect em to play the dickens with the girls I don know
nothin bout the fust Claude there aint none of em in the Bible
air they but whoever he was I bate ye he hed a deceivin tongue If it
hednt ben for me that Claude in Gardner would a run away with my
brothers fust wife an Ill tell ye jest how I contrived to put a

But Mrs Wiley being already somewhat familiar with the circumstances
had taken her candle and retired to her virtuous couch




ROSE SEES THE WORLD


Was this the world after all Rose asked herself and if so what was
amiss with it and where was the charm the bewilderment the
intoxication the glamour

She had been glad to come to Boston for the last two weeks in Edgewood
had proved intolerable She had always been a favorite heretofore from
the days when the boys fought for the privilege of dragging her sled up
the hills and filling her tiny mitten with peppermints down to the
year when she came home from the Wareham Female Seminary an
acknowledged belle and beauty Suddenly she had felt her popularity
dwindling There was no real change in the demeanor of her
acquaintances but there was a certain subtle difference of atmosphere
Everybody sympathized tacitly with Stephen and she did not wonder for
there were times when she secretly took his part against herself Only a
few candid friends had referred to the rupture openly in conversation
but these had been blunt in their disapproval

It seemed part of her ill fortune that just at this time Rufus should be
threatened with partial blindness and that Stephens heart already
sore should be torn with new anxieties She could hardly bear to see
the doctors carriage drive by day after day and hear night after night
that Rufus was unresigned melancholy half mad while Stephen as the
doctor said was brother mother and father in one as gentle as a
woman as firm as Gibraltar

These foes to her peace of mind all came from within but without was
the hourly reproach of her grandmother whose scorching tongue touched
every sensitive spot in the girls nature and burned it like fire

Finally a way of escape opened Mrs Wealthy Brooks who had always been
rheumatic grew suddenly worse She had heard of a magnetic physician
in Boston also of one who used electricity with wonderful effect and
she announced her intention of taking both treatments impartially and
alternately The neighbors were quite willing that Wealthy Ann Brooks
should spend the deceased Ezras money in any way she pleasedshe had
earned it goodness knows by living with him for twentyfive
yearsbut before the day for her departure arrived her right arm and
knee became so much more painful that it was impossible for her to
travel alone

At this juncture Rose was called upon to act as nurse and companion in a
friendly way She seized the opportunity hungrily as a way out of her
present trouble but knowing what Mrs Brookss temper was in time of
health she could see clearly what it was likely to prove when pain and
anguish wrung the brow

Rose had been in Boston now for some weeks and she was sitting in the
Joy Street boardinghouseJoy Street forsooth It was nearly bedtime
and she was looking out upon a huddle of roofs and back yards upon a
landscape filled with clotheslines ashbarrels and illfed cats
There were no sleek country tabbies with the memory in their eyes of
tasted cream nothing but cityborn citybred thin despairing cats of
the pavement cats no more forlorn than Rose herself

Illustration SHE HAD GONE WITH MAUDE TO CLAUDES STORE

She had seen Boston for she had accompanied Mrs Brooks in the
horsecars daily to the two different temples of healing where that lady
worshipped and offered sacrifices She had also gone with Maude
Arthurlena to Claude Merrills store to buy pair of gloves and had
overheard Miss Dix the fashionable ladyassistant before mentioned
say to Miss Brackett of the ribbon department that she thought Mr
Merrill must have worn his blinders that time he stayed so long in
Edgewood This bit of polished irony was unintelligible to Rose at
first but she mastered it after an hours reflection She wasnt
looking her best that day she knew the cotton dresses that seemed so
pretty at home were common and countrified here and her best black
cashmere looked cheap and shapeless beside Miss Dixs brilliantine Miss
Dixs figure was her strong point and her dressmaker was particularly
skillful in the arts of suggestion concealment and revelation Beauty
has its chosen backgrounds Rose in white dimity standing knee deep in
her blossoming brier bushes the river running at her feet dark pine
trees behind her graceful head sounded depths and touched heights of
harmony forever beyond the reach of the modish Miss Dix but she was
out of her element and suffered accordingly

Rose had gone to walk with Claude one evening when she first arrived He
had shown her the State House and the Park Street Church and sat with
her on one of the benches in the Common until nearly ten She knew that
Mrs Brooks had told her nephew of the broken engagement but he made no
reference to the matter save to congratulate her that she was rid of a
man who was so clumsy so dull and behind the times as Stephen
Waterman saying that he had always marveled she could engage herself to
anybody who could insult her by offering her a turquoise ring

Claude was very interesting that evening Rose thought but rather
gloomy and unlike his former self He referred to his grave
responsibilities to the frail health of Maude Arthurlena and to the
vicissitudes of business He vaguely intimated that his daily life in
the store was not so pleasant as it had been formerly that there were
those he would speak no more plainly who embarrassed him with
undesired attentions those who without the smallest shadow of right
vexed him with petty jealousies

Rose dared not ask questions on so delicate a topic but she remembered
in a flash Miss Dixs heavy eyebrows snapping eyes and high color
Claude seemed very happy that Rose had come to Boston though he was
surprised knowing what a trial his aunt must be now that she was so
helpless It was unfortunate also that Rose could not go on excursions
without leaving his aunt alone or he should have been glad to offer his
escort He pressed her hand when he left her at her door telling her
she could never realize what a comfort her friendship was to him could
never imagine how thankful he was that she had courageously freed
herself from ties that in time would have made her wretched His heart
was full he said of feelings he dared not utter but in the near
future when certain clouds had rolled by he would unlock its
treasures and thenbut no more tonight he could not trust himself

Rose felt as if she were assuming one of the characters in a mysterious
romance such as unfolded itself only in books or in Boston but
thrilling as it was it was nevertheless extremely unsatisfactory

Convinced that Claude Merrill was passionately in love with her one of
her reasons for coming to Boston had been to fall more deeply in love
with him and thus heal some at least of the wounds she had inflicted
It may have been a foolish idea but after three weeks it seemed still
worsea useless one for after several interviews she felt herself
drifting farther and farther from Claude and if he felt any burning
ambition to make her his own he certainly concealed it with admirable
art Given up with the most offensive magnanimity by Stephen and not
greatly desired by Claudethat seemed the present status of proud Rose
Wiley of the Brier Neighborhood

It was June she remembered as she leaned out of the open window at
least it was June in Edgewood and she supposed for conveniences sake
they called it June in Boston Not that it mattered much what the poor
city prisoners called it How beautiful the river would be at home with
the trees along the banks in full leaf How she hungered and thirsted
for the riverto see it sparkle in the sunlight to watch the
moonglade stretching from one bank to the other to hear the soft lap of
the water on the shore and the distant murmur of the falls at the
bridge And the Brier Neighborhood would be at its loveliest for the
wild roses were in blossom by now And the little house How sweet it
must look under the shade of the elms with the Saco rippling at the
back Was poor Rufus still lying in a darkened room and was Stephen
nursing himdisappointed Stephendear noble old Stephen




GOLD AND PINCHBECK


Just then Mrs Brooks groaned in the next room and called Rose who went
in to minister to her real needs or to condole with her fancied ones
whichever course of action appeared to be the more agreeable at the
moment

Mrs Brooks desired conversation it seemed or at least she desired an
audience for a monologue for she recognized no antiphonal obligations
on the part of her listeners The doctors were not doing her a speck of
good and she was just squandering money in a miserable boardinghouse
when she might be enjoying poor health in her own home and she didnt
believe her hens were receiving proper care and she had forgotten to
pull down the shades in the spare room and the sun would fade the
carpet out all white before she got back and she didnt believe Dr
Smiths magnetism was any more use than a cats foot nor Dr Robinsons
electricity any better than a bumblebees buzz and she had a great mind
to go home and try Dr Lord from Bonnie Eagle and there was a letter
for Rose on the bureau which had come before supper but the shiftless
lazy worthless landlady had forgotten to send it up till just now

The letter was from Mite Shapley but Rose could read only half of it to
Mrs Brookslittle beside the news that the Waterman barn the finest
barn in the whole township had been struck by lightning and burned to
the ground Stephen was away at the time having taken Rufus to
Portland where an operation on his eyes would shortly be performed at
the hospital and one of the neighbors was sleeping at the River Farm
and taking care of the cattle still the house might not have been
saved but for one of Alcestis Crambrys sudden bursts of common sense
which occurred now quite regularly He succeeded not only in getting the
horses out of the stalls but gave the alarm so promptly that the whole
neighborhood was soon on the scene of action Stephen was the only man
Mite reminded Rose who ever had any patience with or took any pains to
teach Alcestis but he never could have expected to be rewarded in this
practical way The barn was only partly insured and when she had met
Stephen at the station next day and condoled with him on his loss he
had said Oh well Mite a little more or less doesnt make much
difference just now

The rest wouldnt interest you Mrs Brooks said Rose precipitately
preparing to leave the room

Something about Claude I suppose ventured that astute lady I think
Mite kind of fancied him I dont believe he ever gave her any real
encouragement but hed make love to a pump Claude Merrill would and
so would his father before him How my sister Abby made out to land him
we never knew for they said hed proposed to every woman in the town of
Bingham not excepting the wooden Indian girl in front of the cigar
store and not one of em but our Abby ever got a chance to name the
day Abby was as set as the everlastin hills and if shed made up her
mind to have a man he couldnt wriggle away from her nohow in the world
It beats all how girls do run after these slickhaired sweettongued
Miss Nancy kind o fellers that aint but little good as beaux an
worth less than nothing as husbands

Rose scarcely noticed what Mrs Brooks said she was too anxious to read
the rest of Mite Shapleys letter in the quiet of her own room

 Stephen looks thin and pale so it ran on but he does not allow
 anybody to sympathize with him I think you ought to know something
 that I havent told you before for fear of hurting your feelings
 but if I were in your place Id like to hear everything and then
 youll know how to act when you come home Just after you left
 Stephen plowed up all the land in front of your new houseevery
 inch of it all up and down the road between the fence and the
 front doorstepand then he planted corn where you were going to
 have your flowerbeds

 He has closed all the blinds and hung a To Let sign on the large
 elm at the gate Stephen never was spiteful in his life but this
 looks a little like spite Perhaps he only wanted to save his
 selfrespect and let people know that everything between you was
 over forever Perhaps he thought it would stop talk once and for
 all But you wont mind you lucky girl staying nearly three months
 in Boston So Almira purled on in violet ink with shaded letters
 How I wish it had come my way though Im not good at rubbing
 rheumatic patients even when they are his aunt Is he as devoted as
 ever And when will it be How do you like the theatre Mother
 thinks you wont attend but by what he used to say I am sure
 church members in Boston always go to amusements

 Your loving friend
 Almira Shapley

 PS They say Rufuss doctors bills here and the operation and
 hospital expenses in Portland will mount up to five hundred
 dollars Of course Stephen will be dreadfully hampered by the loss
 of his barn and maybe he wants to let your house that was to be
 because he really needs money In that case the dooryard wont be
 very attractive to tenants with corn planted right up to the steps
 and no path left Its two feet tall now and by August just when
 you were intending to move in it will hide the front windows Not
 that youll care with a diamond on your engagement finger

The letter was more than flesh and blood could stand and Rose flung
herself on her bed to think and regret and repent and if possible to
sob herself to sleep

She knew now that she had never admired and respected Stephen so much as
at the moment when under the reproach of his eyes she had given him
back his ring When she left Edgewood and parted with him forever she
had really loved him better than when she had promised to marry him

Claude Merrill on his native Boston heath did not appear the romantic
inspiring figure he had once been in her eyes A week ago she distrusted
him tonight she despised him

What had happened to Rose was the dilation of her vision She saw
things under a wider sky and in a clearer light Above all her heart
was wrung with pity for StephenStephen with no comforting womans
hand to help him in his sore trouble Stephen bearing his losses alone
his burdens and anxieties alone his nursing and daily work alone Oh
how she felt herself needed Needed that was the magic word that
unlocked her better nature Darkness is the time for making roots and
establishing plants whether of the soil or of the soul and all at
once Rose had become a woman a little one perhaps but a whole
womanand a bit of an angel too with healing in her wings When and
how had this metamorphosis come about Last summer the fragile
brierrose had hung over the river and looked at its pretty reflection
in the placid surface of the water Its few buds and blossoms were so
lovely it sighed for nothing more The changes in the plant had been
wrought secretly and silently In some mysterious way as common to soul
as to plant life the roots had gathered in more nourishment from the
earth they had stored up strength and force and all at once there was
a marvelous fructifying of the plant hardiness of stalk new shoots
everywhere vigorous leafage and a shower of blossoms

But everything was awry Boston was a failure Claude was a weakling and
a flirt her turquoise ring was lying on the riverbank Stephen did not
love her any longer her flowerbeds were plowed up and planted in corn
and the cottage that Stephen had built and she had furnished that
beloved cottage was to let

She was in Boston but what did that amount to after all What was the
State House to a bleeding heart or the Old South Church to a pride
wounded like hers

At last she fell asleep but it was only by stopping her ears to the
noises of the city streets and making herself imagine the sound of the
river rippling under her bedroom windows at home The back yards of
Boston faded and in their place came the banks of the Saco strewn with
pine needles fragrant with wild flowers Then there was the bit of
sunny beach where Stephen moored his boat She could hear the sound of
his paddle Boston lovers came acourting in the horsecars but hers
had floated down stream to her just at dusk in a birchbark canoe or
sometimes in the moonlight on a couple of logs rafted together

But it was all over now and she could see only Stephens stern face as
he flung the despised turquoise ring down the river bank




A COUNTRY CHEVALIER


It was early in August when Mrs Wealthy Brooks announced her speedy
return from Boston to Edgewood

Its jest as well Rose is comin back said Mr Wiley to his wife I
never favored her goin to Boston where that rosyposy Claude feller is
When he was down here he was kep kind o tied up in a boxstall but
there hes caperin loose round the pastur

I should think Rose would be ashamed to come back after the way shes
carried on remarked Mrs Wiley but if she needed punishment I guess
shes got it bein compnykeeper to Wealthy Ann Brooks Bein a church
member in good an reglar standin I spose Wealthy Annll go to
heaven but I can only say that it would be a sight pleasanter place for
a good many if she didnt

Rose has ben foolish an flirty an wrongheaded allowed her
grandfather but it wont do no good to treat her like a hardened
criminile sames you did afore she went away She aint hardly got her
wisdom teeth cut in love affairs She aint broke the laws of the State
o Maine nor any o the ten commandments she aint disgraced the
family an theres a chance for her to reform seein as how she aint
twenty year old yet I was turrible wild an hotheaded myself afore you
ketched me an tamed me down

You aint so tame now as I wish you was Mrs Wiley replied testily

If you could smoke a clay pipe t would calm your nerves mother an
help you to git some philosophy inter you you need a little philosophy
turrible bad

I need patience considable more was Mrs Wileys withering retort

Thats the way with folks said Old Kennebec reflectively as he went
on peacefully puffing If you try to indoose em to take an intrest in
a brannew virtue they wont look at it but theyll run down a side
street an buy half a yard more o some turrible old shopworn trait o
character that theyve kep in stock all their lives an that
everybodys sick to death of There was a man in Gardner

But alas the experiences of the Gardiner man though told in the same
delightful fashion that had won Mrs Wileys heart many years before
now fell upon the empty air In these years of Old Kennebecs
anecdotage his pipe was his best listener and his truest confidant

Mr Wileys constant intercessions with his wife made Roses homecoming
somewhat easier and the sight of her own room and belongings soothed
her troubled spirit but the days went on and nothing happened to
change the situation She had lost a lover that was all and there were
plenty more to choose from or there always had been but the only one
she wanted was the one who made no sign She used to think that she
could twist Stephen around her little finger that she had only to
beckon to him and he would follow her to the ends of the earth Now fear
had entered her heart She no longer felt sure because she no longer
felt worthy of him and feeling both uncertainty and unworthiness her
lips were sealed and she was rendered incapable of making any bid for
forgiveness

So the little world of Pleasant River went on to all outward seeming
as it had ever gone On one side of the stream a girls heart was
longing and pining and sickening with hope deferred and growing
too with such astonishing rapidity that the very angels marveled And
on the other a mans whole vision of life an duty was widening and
deepening under the fructifying influence of his sorrow

The corn waved high and green in front of the vacant riverside cottage
but Stephen sent no word or message to Rose He had seen her once but
only from a distance She seemed paler and thinner he thoughtthe
result probably of her metropolitan gayeties He heard no rumor of any
engagement and he wondered if it were possible that her love for Claude
Merrill had not after all been returned in kind This seemed a wild
impossibility His mind refused to entertain the supposition that any
man on earth could resist falling in love with Rose or having fallen
in that he could ever contrive to climb out So he worked on at his
farm harder than ever and grew soberer and more careworn daily Rufus
had never seemed so near and dear to him as in these weeks when he had
lived under the shadow of threatened blindness The burning of the barn
and the strain upon their slender property brought the brothers
together shoulder to shoulder

If you lose your girl Steve said the boy and I lose my eyesight
and we both lose the barn why itll be us two against the world for a
spell

The To Let sign on the little house was an arrant piece of hypocrisy
Nothing but the direst extremity could have caused him to allow an alien
step on that sacred threshold The plowing up of the flowerbeds and
planting of the corn had served a double purpose It showed the too
curious public the finality of his break with Rose and her absolute
freedom it also prevented them from suspecting that he still entered
the place His visits were not many but he could not bear to let the
dust settle on the furniture that he and Rose had chosen together and
whenever he locked the door and went back to the River Farm he thought
of a verse in the Bible Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from
the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken

It was now Friday of the last week in August The river was full of
logs thousands upon thousands of them covering the surface of the water
from the bridge almost up to the Brier Neighborhood

The Edgewood drive was late owing to a long drought and low water but
it was to begin on the following Monday and Lije Dennett and his under
boss were looking over the situation and planning the campaign As they
leaned over the bridgerail they saw Mr Wiley driving down the river
road When he caught sight of them he hitched the old white horse at the
corner and walked toward them filling his pipe the while in his usual
leisurely manner

Were not busy this forenoon said Lije Dennett Spose we stand
right here and let Old Kennebec have his say out for once Weve never
heard the end of one of his stories an hes ben talkin for twenty
years

All right rejoined his companion with a broad grin at the idea Im
willin if you are but whos goin to tell our famlies the reason
weve deserted em I bate yer we shant budge till the crack o doom
The road commissionerll come along once a year and mend the bridge
under our feet but Old Kennebecll talk straight on till the day o
jedgment

Mr Wiley had one of the most enjoyable mornings of his life and felt
that after half a century of neglect his powers were at last appreciated
by his fellowcitizens

He proposed numerous strategic movements to be made upon the logs
whereby they would move more swiftly than usual He described several
successful drives on the Kennebec when the logs had melted down the
river almost by magic owing to his generalship and he paid a tribute
in passing to the docility of the boss who on that occasion had never
moved a single log without asking his advice

From this topic he proceeded genially to narrate the lifehistories of
the boss the under boss and several Indians belonging to the
crewhistories in which he himself played a gallant and conspicuous
part The conversation then drifted naturally to the exploits of
riverdrivers in general and Mr Wiley narrated the sorts of feats in
logriding pickpolethrowing and the shooting of rapids that he had
done in his youth These stories were such as had seldom been heard by
the ear of man and as they passed into circulation instantaneously we
are probably enjoying some of them to this day

They were still being told when a Crambry child appeared on the bridge
bearing a note for the old man

Upon reading it he moved off rapidly in the direction of the store
ejaculating

Bless my soul I clean forgot that saleratus and mothers settin at
the kitchen table with the bowl in her lap waitin for it Got so
intrested in your listnin I never thought o the time

The connubial discussion that followed this breach of discipline began
on the arrival of the saleratus and lasted through supper and Rose
went to bed almost immediately afterward for very dullness and apathy
Her life stretched out before her in the most aimless and monotonous
fashion She saw nothing but heartache in the future and that she
richly deserved it made it none the easier to bear

Feeling feverish and sleepless she slipped on her gray Shaker cloak and
stole quietly downstairs for a breath of air Her grandfather and
grandmother were talking on the piazza and good humor seemed to have
been restored

I was over to the tavern tonight she heard him say as she sat down
at a little distance I was over to the tavern tonight an a feller
from Gorham got to talkin an braggin bout what a stock o goods they
kep in the store over there An says I I bate ye dollars to
doughnuts that there haint a darn thing ye can ask for at Bill Pikes
store at Pleasant River that he cant go down cellar or up attic or
out in the barn chamber an git for ye Well sir he took me up an I
borrered the money of Joe Dennett who held the stakes an we went
right over to Bill Pikes with all the boys follerin on behind An the
Gorham man never let on what he was goin to ask for till the hull crowd
of us got inside the store Then says he as plite as a basket o
chips Mr Pike Id like to buy a pulpit if you can oblige me with
one

Bill scratched his head an I held my breath Then says he Pears to
me Id ought to hev a pulpit or two if I can jest remember where I keep
em I dont never callate to be out o pulpits but Im so plagued
for room I cant keep em in here with the grocries Jim thats his
new store boy you jest take a lantern an run out in the far corner o
the shed at the end o the hickory woodpile an see how many pulpits
weve got in stock Well Jim run out an when he come back he says
Weve got two Mr Pike Shall I bring one of em in

At that the boys all bust out laughin an hollerin an tauntin the
Gorham man an he paid up with a good will I tell ye

I dont approve of bettin said Mrs Wiley grimly but Ill try to
sanctify the money by usin it for a new washboiler

The fact is explained old Kennebec somewhat confused that the boys
made me spend every cent of it then an there

Rose heard her grandmothers caustic reply and then paid no further
attention until her keen ear caught the sound of Stephens name It was
a part of her unhappiness that since her broken engagement no one would
ever allude to him and she longed to hear him mentioned so that
perchance she could get some inkling of his movements

Illustration AS LONG AS STEPHEN WATERMANS ALIVE ROSE WILEY CAN HAVE
HIM

I met Stephen tonight for the first time in a week said Mr Wiley
He kind o keeps out o my way lately Hes goin to drive his span
into Portland tomorrow mornin and bring Rufus home from the hospital
Sunday afternoon The doctors think theyve made a success of their job
but Rufus has got to be bandaged up a spell longer Stephen is goin to
join the drive Monday mornin at the bridge here so Ill get the latest
news o the boy Land Ill be turrible glad if he gets out with his
eyesight if its only for Steves sake Hes a turrible good fellow
Steve is He said something tonight that made me set more store by him
than ever I told you I hednt heard an unkind word agin Rose sence
she come home from Boston an no more I hev till this evenin There
was two or three fellers talkin in the postoffice an they didnt
suspicion I was settin on the steps outside the screen door That Jim
Jenkins that Rose so everlastinly snubbed at the tavern dance spoke
up an says he This time last year Rose Wiley could a hed the
choice of any man on the river an now I bet ye she cant get nary
one

Steve was there jest goin out the door with some bags o coffee an
sugar under his arm

I guess youre mistaken about that he says speakin up jest like
lightnin so long as Stephen Watermans alive Rose Wiley can have
him for one and that everybodys welcome to know

He spoke right out loud an plain jest as if he was readin the
Declaration of Independence I expected the boys would everlastinly
poke fun at him but they never said a word I guess his eyes flashed
for he come out the screen door slammin it after him and stalked by
me as if he was too worked up to notice anything or anybody I didnt
foiler him for his long legs git over the ground too fast for me but
thinks I Mebbe Ill hev some use for my lemonadeset after all

I hope to the land you will responded Mrs Wiley for Im about sick
o movin it round when I sweep under my bed And I shall be glad if
Rose an Stephen do make it up for Wealthy Ann Brookss gossip is too
much for a Christian woman to stand




HOUSEBREAKING


Where was the pale Rose the faded Rose that crept noiselessly down
from her room wanting neither to speak nor to be spoken to Nobody ever
knew She vanished forever and in her place a thing of sparkles and
dimples flashed up the stairway and closed the door softly There was a
streak of moonshine lying across the bare floor and a merry ghost with
dressinggown held prettily away from bare feet danced a gay fandango
among the yellow moonbeams There were breathless flights to the open
window and kisses thrown in the direction of the River Farm There were
impressive declamations at the lookingglass where a radiant creature
pointed to her reflection and whispered Worthless little pig he
loves you after all

Then when quiet joy had taken the place of mad delight there was a
swoop down upon the floor an impetuous hiding of brimming eyes in the
white counterpane and a dozen impassioned promises to herself and to
something higher than herself to be a better girl

The mood lasted and deepened and still Rose did not move Her heart
was on its knees before Stephens faithful love his chivalry his
strength Her troubled spirit like a frail boat tossed about in the
rapids seemed entering a quiet harbor where there were protecting
shores and a still still evening star Her sails were all torn and
drooping but the harbor was in sight and the poor little
weatherbeaten craft could rest in peace

A period of grave reflection now ensuedunder the bedclothes where
one could think better Suddenly an inspiration seized heran
inspiration so original so delicious and above all so humble and
praiseworthy that it brought her head from her pillow and she sat bolt
upright clapping her hands like a child

The very thing she whispered to herself gleefully It will take
courage but Im sure of my ground after what he said before them all
and Ill do it Grandma in Biddeford buying church carpets Stephen in
Portlandwas ever such a chance

The same glowing Rose came downstairs two steps at a time next
morning bade her grandmother goodby with suspicious pleasure and sent
her grandfather away on an errand which with attendant conversation
would consume half the day Then bundles after bundles and baskets after
baskets were packed into the wagonbehind the seat beneath the seat
and finally under the laprobe She gave a dramatic flourish to the
whip drove across the bridge went through Pleasant River village and
up the leafy road to the little house stared the To Let sign
scornfully in the eye alighted and ran like a deer through the aisles
of waving corn past the kitchen windows to the back door

If he has kept the big key in the old place under the stone where we
both used to find it then he hasnt forgotten meor anything thought
Rose

The key was there and Rose lifted it with a sob of gratitude It was
but five minutes work to carry all the bundles from the wagon to the
back steps and another five to lead old Tom across the road into the
woods and tie him to a tree quite out of the sight of any passerby

When after running back she turned the key in the lock her heart gave
a leap almost of terror and she started at the sound of her own
footfall Through the open door the sunlight streamed into the dark
room She flew to tables and chairs and gave a rapid sweep of the hand
over their surfaces

He has been dusting hereand within a few days too she thought
triumphantly

The kitchen was perfection as she always knew it would be with one
door opening to the shaded road and the other looking on the river
windows too framing the appleorchard and the elms She had chosen the
furniture but how differently it looked now that it was actually in
place The tiny shed had piles of split wood with great boxes of
kindlings and shavings all in readiness for the bride who would do her
own cooking Who but Stephen would have made the very wood ready for a
womans homecoming and why had he done so much in May when they were
not to be married until August Then the door of the bedroom was
stealthily opened and here Rose sat down and cried for joy and shame
and hope and fear The very flowered paper she had refused as too
expensive How lovely it looked with the white chamber set She brought
in her simple wedding outfit of blankets bedlinen and counterpanes
and folded them softly in the closet and then for the rest of the
morning she went from room to room doing all that could remain
undiscovered even to laying a fire in the new kitchen stove

This was the plan Stephen must pass the house on his way from the River
Farm to the bridge where he was to join the riverdrivers on Monday
morning She would be out of bed by the earliest peep of dawn put on
Stephens favorite pink calico leave a note for her grandmother run
like a hare down her side of the river and up Stephens steal into the
house open blinds and windows light the fire and set the kettle
boiling Then with a sharp knife she would cut down two rows of corn
and thus make a green pathway from the front kitchen steps to the road
Next the false and insulting To Let sign would be forcibly tweaked
from the tree and thrown into the grass She would then lay the table in
the kitchen and make ready the nicest breakfast that two people ever
sat down to And oh would two people sit down to it or would one go
off in a rage and the other die of grief and disappointment

Then having done all she would wait and palpitate and palpitate and
wait until Stephen came Surely no propertyowner in the universe could
drive along a road observe his corn leveled to the earth his sign
removed his house open and smoke issuing from his chimney without
going in to surprise the rogue and villain who could be guilty of such
vandalism

And when he came in

Oh she had all day Sunday in which to forecast with mingled dread and
gladness and suspense that allimportant alldecisive first moment
All day Sunday to frame and unframe penitent speeches All day Sunday
Would it ever be Monday If so what would Tuesday bring Would the sun
rise on happy Mrs Stephen Waterman of Pleasant River or on miserable
Miss Rose Wiley of the Brier Neighborhood




THE DREAM ROOM


Long ago when Stephen was a boy of fourteen or fifteen he had gone
with his father to a distant town to spend the night After an early
breakfast next morning his father had driven off for a business
interview and left the boy to walk about during his absence He
wandered aimlessly along a quiet side street and threw himself down on
the grass outside a pretty garden to amuse himself as best he could

After a few minutes he heard voices and turning peeped through the
bars of the gate in idle boyish curiosity It was a small brown house
the kitchen door was open and a table spread with a white cloth was set
in the middle of the room There was a cradle in a far corner and a
man was seated at the table as though he might be waiting for his
breakfast

There is a kind of sentiment about the kitchen in New England a kind of
sentiment not provoked by other rooms Here the farmer drops in to spend
a few minutes when he comes back from the barn or field on an errand
Here in the great clean sweet comfortable place the busy housewife
lives sometimes rocking the cradle sometimes opening and shutting the
oven door sometimes stirring the pot darning stockings paring
vegetables or mixing goodies in a yellow bowl The children sit on the
steps stringing beans shelling peas or hulling berries the cat
sleeps on the floor near the woodbox and the visitor feels exiled if
he stays in sittingroom or parlor for here where the mother is always
busy is the heart of the farmhouse

There was an open back door to this kitchen a door framed in
morningglories and the woman or was she only girl standing at the
stove was prettyoh so pretty in Stephens eyes His boyish heart
went out to her on the instant She poured a cup of coffee and walked
with it to the table then an unexpected interesting thing
happenedsomething the boy ought not to have seen and never forgot
The man putting out his hand to take the cup looked up at the pretty
woman with a smile and she stooped and kissed him

Stephen was fifteen As he looked on the instant he became a man with
a mans hopes desires ambitions He looked eagerly hungrily and the
scene burned itself on the sensitive plate of his young heart so that
as he grew older he could take the picture out in the dark from time
to time and look at it again When he first met Rose he did not know
precisely what she was to mean to him but before long when he closed
his eyes and the old familiar picture swam into his field of vision
behold by some spiritual chemistry the pretty womans face had given
place to that of Rose

All such teasing visions had been sternly banished during this sorrowful
summer and it was a thoughtful sober Stephen who drove along the road
on this mellow August morning The dust was deep the goldenrod waved
its imperial plumes making the humble waysides gorgeous the river
chattered and sparkled till it met the logs at the Brier Neighorhood
and then lapsing into silence flowed steadily under them till it found
a vent for its spirits in the dashing and splashing of the falls

Haying was over logging was to begin that day then harvesting then
woodcutting then eternal successions of plowing sowing reaping
haying logging harvesting and so on to the endless end of his days
Here and there a red or a yellow branch painted only yesterday caught
his eye and made him shiver He was not ready for winter his heart
still craved the summer it had missed

Hello What was that Cornstalks prone on the earth Sign torn down and
lying flat in the grass Blinds open fire in the chimney

He leaped from the wagon and flinging the reins to Alcestis Crambry
said Stay right here out of sight and dont you move till I call
you and striding up the green pathway flung open the kitchen door

A forest of corn waving in the doorway at the back morningglories
clambering round and round the windowframes table with shining white
cloth kettle humming and steaming something bubbling in a pan on the
stove fire throwing out sweet little gleams of welcome through the open
damper All this was taken in with one incredulous rapturous twinkle of
an eye but something else too Rose of all roses Rose of the river
Rose of the world standing behind a chair her hand pressed against
her heart her lips parted her breath coming and going She was
glowing like a jewel glowing with the extraordinary brilliancy that
emotion gives to some women She used to be happy in a gay sparkling
way like the shallow part of the stream as it chatters over white
pebbles and bright sands Now it was a broad steady full happiness
like the deeps of the river under the sun

Dont speak Stephen till you hear what I have to say It takes a good
deal of courage for a girl to do as I am doing but I want to show how
sorry I am and its the only way She was trembling and the words
came faster and faster Ive been very wrong and foolish and made you
very unhappy but I havent done what you would have hated most I
havent been engaged to Claude Merrill he hasnt so much as asked me I
am here to beg you to forgive me to eat breakfast with me to drive me
to the ministers and marry me quickly quickly before anything
happens to prevent us and then to bring me home here to live all the
days of my life Oh Stephen dear honestly honestly you havent lost
anything in all this long miserable summer Ive suffered too and Im
better worth loving than I was Will you take me back

Rose had a tremendous power of provoking and holding love and Stephen
of loving His was too generous a nature for revilings and complaints
and reproaches

The shores of his heart were strewn with the wreckage of the troubled
summer but if the tide of love is high enough it washes such things
out of remembrance He just opened his arms and took Rose to his heart
faults and all with joy and gratitude and she was as happy as a child
who has escaped the scolding it richly deserved and who determines for
very thankfulness sake never to be naughty again

Illustration DONT SPEAK STEPHEN TILL YOU HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO SAY

You dont know what youve done for me Stephen she whispered with
her face hidden on his shoulder I was just a common little prickly
rosebush when you came along like a good gardener and grafted in
something better the something better was your love Stephen dear and
its made everything different The silly Rose you were engaged to long
ago has disappeared somewhere I hope you wont be able to find her
under the new leaves

She was all I wanted said Stephen

You thought she was the girl answered because you didnt see the
prickles but youd have felt them sometime The old Rose was a selfish
thing not good enough for you the new Rose is going to be your wife
and Rufuss sister and your mothers daughter all in one

Then such a breakfast was spread as Stephen in his sorry years of
bachelor existence had forgotten could exist but before he broke his
fast he ran out to the wagon and served the astonished Alcestis with his
wedding refreshments then and there bidding him drive back to the River
Farm and bring him a package that lay in the drawer of his
shavingstanda package placed there when hot youth and love and longing
had inspired him to hurry on the marriage day

Theres an envelope Alcestis he cried a long envelope way way
back in the corner and a small box on top of it Bring them both and
my wallet too and if you find them all and get them to me safely you
shall be bridesmaid and groomsman and best man and usher and maid of
honor at a wedding in less than an hour Off with you Drive straight
and use the whip on Dolly

When he reentered the kitchen flushed with joy and excitement Rose put
the various good things on the table and he almost tremblingly took his
seat fearing that contact with the solid wood might wake him from this
entrancing vision

Id like to put you in your chair like a queen and wait on you he
said with a soft boyish stammer but I am too dazed with happiness to
be of any use

Its my turn to wait upon you and IOh how I love to have you
dazed Rose answered Ill be at the table presently myself but we
have been housekeeping only three minutes and we have nothing but the
tin coffeepot this morning so Ill pour the coffee from the stove

She filled a cup with housewifely care and brought it to Stephens side
As she set it down and was turning she caught his looka look so full
of longing that no loving woman however busy could have resisted it
then she stooped and kissed him fondly fervently

Stephen put his arm about her and drawing her down to his knee rested
his head against her soft shoulder with a sigh of comfort like that of
a tired child He had waited for it ten years and at last the
dreamroom had come true
