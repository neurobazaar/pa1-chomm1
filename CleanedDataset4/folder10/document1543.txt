Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

A LOVERS COMPLAINT

by William Shakespeare




From off a hill whose concave womb reworded
A plaintful story from a sistering vale
My spirits to attend this double voice accorded
And down I laid to list the sadtund tale
Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale
Tearing of papers breaking rings atwain
Storming her world with sorrows wind and rain

Upon her head a platted hive of straw
Which fortified her visage from the sun
Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
The carcase of a beauty spent and done
Time had not scythed all that youth begun
Nor youth all quit but spite of Heavens fell rage
Some beauty peeped through lattice of seard age

Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne
Which on it had conceited characters
Laundring the silken figures in the brine
That seasond woe had pelleted in tears
And often reading what contents it bears
As often shrieking undistinguishd woe
In clamours of all size both high and low

Sometimes her levelld eyes their carriage ride
As they did battery to the spheres intend
Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
To th orbed earth sometimes they do extend
Their view right on anon their gazes lend
To every place at once and nowhere fixd
The mind and sight distractedly commixd

Her hair nor loose nor tied in formal plat
Proclaimd in her a careless hand of pride
For some untuckd descended her sheavd hat
Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside
Some in her threaden fillet still did bide
And true to bondage would not break from thence
Though slackly braided in loose negligence

A thousand favours from a maund she drew
Of amber crystal and of beaded jet
Which one by one she in a river threw
Upon whose weeping margent she was set
Like usury applying wet to wet
Or monarchs hands that lets not bounty fall
Where want cries some but where excess begs all

Of folded schedules had she many a one
Which she perusd sighd tore and gave the flood
Crackd many a ring of posied gold and bone
Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud
Found yet mo letters sadly pennd in blood
With sleided silk feat and affectedly
Enswathd and seald to curious secrecy

These often bathd she in her fluxive eyes
And often kissd and often gan to tear
Cried O false blood thou register of lies
What unapproved witness dost thou bear
Ink would have seemd more black and damned here
This said in top of rage the lines she rents
Big discontent so breaking their contents

A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh
Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew
Of court of city and had let go by
The swiftest hours observed as they flew
Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew
And privilegd by age desires to know
In brief the grounds and motives of her woe

So slides he down upon his grained bat
And comelydistant sits he by her side
When he again desires her being sat
Her grievance with his hearing to divide
If that from him there may be aught applied
Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
Tis promised in the charity of age

Father she says though in me you behold
The injury of many a blasting hour
Let it not tell your judgement I am old
Not age but sorrow over me hath power
I might as yet have been a spreading flower
Fresh to myself if I had selfapplied
Love to myself and to no love beside

But woe is me too early I attended
A youthful suit it was to gain my grace
Of one by natures outwards so commended
That maidens eyes stuck over all his face
Love lackd a dwelling and made him her place
And when in his fair parts she did abide
She was new lodgd and newly deified

His browny locks did hang in crooked curls
And every light occasion of the wind
Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls
Whats sweet to do to do will aptly find
Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind
For on his visage was in little drawn
What largeness thinks in paradise was sawn

Small show of man was yet upon his chin
His phoenix down began but to appear
Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
Whose bare outbraggd the web it seemed to wear
Yet showd his visage by that cost more dear
And nice affections wavering stood in doubt
If best were as it was or best without

His qualities were beauteous as his form
For maidentongued he was and thereof free
Yet if men movd him was he such a storm
As oft twixt May and April is to see
When winds breathe sweet unruly though they be
His rudeness so with his authorizd youth
Did livery falseness in a pride of truth

Well could he ride and often men would say
That horse his mettle from his rider takes
Proud of subjection noble by the sway
What rounds what bounds what course what stop he makes
And controversy hence a question takes
Whether the horse by him became his deed
Or he his manage by the welldoing steed

But quickly on this side the verdict went
His real habitude gave life and grace
To appertainings and to ornament
Accomplishd in himself not in his case
All aids themselves made fairer by their place
Came for additions yet their purposd trim
Piercd not his grace but were all gracd by him

So on the tip of his subduing tongue
All kind of arguments and question deep
All replication prompt and reason strong
For his advantage still did wake and sleep
To make the weeper laugh the laugher weep
He had the dialect and different skill
Catching all passions in his craft of will

That he did in the general bosom reign
Of young of old and sexes both enchanted
To dwell with him in thoughts or to remain
In personal duty following where he haunted
Consents bewitchd ere he desire have granted
And dialogued for him what he would say
Askd their own wills and made their wills obey

Many there were that did his picture get
To serve their eyes and in it put their mind
Like fools that in the imagination set
The goodly objects which abroad they find
Of lands and mansions theirs in thought assignd
And labouring in mo pleasures to bestow them
Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them

So many have that never touchd his hand
Sweetly supposd them mistress of his heart
My woeful self that did in freedom stand
And was my own feesimple not in part
What with his heart in youth and youth in art
Threw my affections in his charmed power
Reservd the stalk and gave him all my flower

Yet did I not as some my equals did
Demand of him nor being desired yielded
Finding myself in honour so forbid
With safest distance I mine honour shielded
Experience for me many bulwarks builded
Of proofs newbleeding which remaind the foil
Of this false jewel and his amorous spoil

But ah who ever shunnd by precedent
The destind ill she must herself assay
Or forced examples gainst her own content
To put the bypassd perils in her way
Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay
For when we rage advice is often seen
By blunting us to make our wills more keen

Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood
That we must curb it upon others proof
To be forbod the sweets that seems so good
For fear of harms that preach in our behoof
O appetite from judgement stand aloof
The one a palate hath that needs will taste
Though reason weep and cry It is thy last

For further I could say This mans untrue
And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling
Heard where his plants in others orchards grew
Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling
Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling
Thought characters and words merely but art
And bastards of his foul adulterate heart

And long upon these terms I held my city
Till thus he gan besiege me Gentle maid
Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity
And be not of my holy vows afraid
Thats to you sworn to none was ever said
For feasts of love I have been calld unto
Till now did neer invite nor never woo

All my offences that abroad you see
Are errors of the blood none of the mind
Love made them not with acture they may be
Where neither party is nor true nor kind
They sought their shame that so their shame did find
And so much less of shame in me remains
By how much of me their reproach contains

Among the many that mine eyes have seen
Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmd
Or my affection put to the smallest teen
Or any of my leisures ever charmd
Harm have I done to them but neer was harmed
Kept hearts in liveries but mine own was free
And reignd commanding in his monarchy

Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me
Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood
Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
Of grief and blushes aptly understood
In bloodless white and the encrimsond mood
Effects of terror and dear modesty
Encampd in hearts but fighting outwardly

And lo behold these talents of their hair
With twisted metal amorously empleachd
I have receivd from many a several fair
Their kind acceptance weepingly beseechd
With the annexions of fair gems enrichd
And deepbraind sonnets that did amplify
Each stones dear nature worth and quality

The diamond why twas beautiful and hard
Whereto his invisd properties did tend
The deepgreen emerald in whose fresh regard
Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend
The heavenhued sapphire and the opal blend
With objects manifold each several stone
With wit well blazond smild or made some moan

Lo all these trophies of affections hot
Of pensivd and subdued desires the tender
Nature hath chargd me that I hoard them not
But yield them up where I myself must render
That is to you my origin and ender
For these of force must your oblations be
Since I their altar you enpatron me

O then advance of yours that phraseless hand
Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise
Take all these similes to your own command
Hallowd with sighs that burning lungs did raise
What me your minister for you obeys
Works under you and to your audit comes
Their distract parcels in combined sums

Lo this device was sent me from a nun
Or sister sanctified of holiest note
Which late her noble suit in court did shun
Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote
For she was sought by spirits of richest coat
But kept cold distance and did thence remove
To spend her living in eternal love

But O my sweet what labour ist to leave
The thing we have not mastering what not strives
Paling the place which did no form receive
Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves
She that her fame so to herself contrives
The scars of battle scapeth by the flight
And makes her absence valiant not her might

O pardon me in that my boast is true
The accident which brought me to her eye
Upon the moment did her force subdue
And now she would the caged cloister fly
Religious love put out religions eye
Not to be tempted would she be immurd
And now to tempt all liberty procurd

How mighty then you are O hear me tell
The broken bosoms that to me belong
Have emptied all their fountains in my well
And mine I pour your ocean all among
I strong oer them and you oer me being strong
Must for your victory us all congest
As compound love to physic your cold breast

My parts had powr to charm a sacred nun
Who disciplind and dieted in grace
Believd her eyes when they t oassail begun
All vows and consecrations giving place
O most potential love vow bond nor space
In thee hath neither sting knot nor confine
For thou art all and all things else are thine

When thou impressest what are precepts worth
Of stale example When thou wilt inflame
How coldly those impediments stand forth
Of wealth of filial fear law kindred fame
Loves arms are peace gainst rule gainst sense gainst
shame
And sweetens in the suffering pangs it bears
The aloes of all forces shocks and fears

Now all these hearts that do on mine depend
Feeling it break with bleeding groans they pine
And supplicant their sighs to your extend
To leave the battery that you make gainst mine
Lending soft audience to my sweet design
And credent soul to that strongbonded oath
That shall prefer and undertake my troth

This said his watery eyes he did dismount
Whose sights till then were levelld on my face
Each cheek a river running from a fount
With brinish current downward flowd apace
O how the channel to the stream gave grace
Who glazd with crystal gate the glowing roses
That flame through water which their hue encloses

O father what a hell of witchcraft lies
In the small orb of one particular tear
But with the inundation of the eyes
What rocky heart to water will not wear
What breast so cold that is not warmed here
O cleft effect cold modesty hot wrath
Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath

For lo his passion but an art of craft
Even there resolvd my reason into tears
There my white stole of chastity I daffd
Shook off my sober guards and civil fears
Appear to him as he to me appears
All melting though our drops this difference bore
His poisond me and mine did him restore

In him a plenitude of subtle matter
Applied to cautels all strange forms receives
Of burning blushes or of weeping water
Or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves
In eithers aptness as it best deceives
To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes
Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows

That not a heart which in his level came
Could scape the hail of his allhurting aim
Showing fair nature is both kind and tame
And veild in them did win whom he would maim
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim
When he most burned in heartwishd luxury
He preachd pure maid and praisd cold chastity

Thus merely with the garment of a Grace
The naked and concealed fiend he coverd
That the unexperiencd gave the tempter place
Which like a cherubin above them hoverd
Who young and simple would not be so loverd
Ay me I fell and yet do question make
What I should do again for such a sake

O that infected moisture of his eye
O that false fire which in his cheek so glowd
O that forcd thunder from his heart did fly
O that sad breath his spongy lungs bestowd
O all that borrowd motion seeming owd
Would yet again betray the forebetrayd
And new pervert a reconciled maid
