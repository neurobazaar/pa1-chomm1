 THE AENEID

 by Virgil


 BOOK I

 Arms and the man I sing who forcd by fate
 And haughty Junos unrelenting hate
 Expelld and exild left the Trojan shore
 Long labors both by sea and land he bore
 And in the doubtful war before he won
 The Latian realm and built the destind town
 His banishd gods restord to rites divine
 And settled sure succession in his line
 From whence the race of Alban fathers come
 And the long glories of majestic Rome

 O Muse the causes and the crimes relate
 What goddess was provokd and whence her hate
 For what offense the Queen of Heavn began
 To persecute so brave so just a man
 Involvd his anxious life in endless cares
 Exposd to wants and hurried into wars
 Can heavnly minds such high resentment show
 Or exercise their spite in human woe

 Against the Tibers mouth but far away
 An ancient town was seated on the sea
 A Tyrian colony the people made
 Stout for the war and studious of their trade
 Carthage the name belovd by Juno more
 Than her own Argos or the Samian shore
 Here stood her chariot here if Heavn were kind
 The seat of awful empire she designd
 Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly
 Long cited by the people of the sky
 That times to come should see the Trojan race
 Her Carthage ruin and her towrs deface
 Nor thus confind the yoke of sovreign sway
 Should on the necks of all the nations lay
 She ponderd this and feard it was in fate
 Nor could forget the war she wagd of late
 For conquring Greece against the Trojan state
 Besides long causes working in her mind
 And secret seeds of envy lay behind
 Deep graven in her heart the doom remaind
 Of partial Paris and her form disdaind
 The grace bestowd on ravishd Ganymed
 Electras glories and her injurd bed
 Each was a cause alone and all combind
 To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind
 For this far distant from the Latian coast
 She drove the remnants of the Trojan host
 And sevn long years th unhappy wandring train
 Were tossd by storms and scatterd thro the main
 Such time such toil requird the Roman name
 Such length of labor for so vast a frame

 Now scarce the Trojan fleet with sails and oars
 Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores
 Entring with cheerful shouts the watry reign
 And plowing frothy furrows in the main
 When labring still with endless discontent
 The Queen of Heavn did thus her fury vent

 Then am I vanquishd must I yield said she
 And must the Trojans reign in Italy
 So Fate will have it and Jove adds his force
 Nor can my powr divert their happy course
 Could angry Pallas with revengeful spleen
 The Grecian navy burn and drown the men
 She for the fault of one offending foe
 The bolts of Jove himself presumd to throw
 With whirlwinds from beneath she tossd the ship
 And bare exposd the bosom of the deep
 Then as an eagle gripes the trembling game
 The wretch yet hissing with her fathers flame
 She strongly seizd and with a burning wound
 Transfixd and naked on a rock she bound
 But I who walk in awful state above
 The majesty of heavn the sister wife of Jove
 For length of years my fruitless force employ
 Against the thin remains of ruind Troy
 What nations now to Junos powr will pray
 Or offrings on my slighted altars lay

 Thus ragd the goddess and with fury fraught
 The restless regions of the storms she sought
 Where in a spacious cave of living stone
 The tyrant Aeolus from his airy throne
 With powr imperial curbs the struggling winds
 And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds
 This way and that th impatient captives tend
 And pressing for release the mountains rend
 High in his hall th undaunted monarch stands
 And shakes his scepter and their rage commands
 Which did he not their unresisted sway
 Would sweep the world before them in their way
 Earth air and seas thro empty space would roll
 And heavn would fly before the driving soul
 In fear of this the Father of the Gods
 Confind their fury to those dark abodes
 And lockd em safe within oppressd with mountain loads
 Imposd a king with arbitrary sway
 To loose their fetters or their force allay
 To whom the suppliant queen her prayrs addressd
 And thus the tenor of her suit expressd

 O Aeolus for to thee the King of Heavn
 The powr of tempests and of winds has givn
 Thy force alone their fury can restrain
 And smooth the waves or swell the troubled main
 A race of wandring slaves abhorrd by me
 With prosprous passage cut the Tuscan sea
 To fruitful Italy their course they steer
 And for their vanquishd gods design new temples there
 Raise all thy winds with night involve the skies
 Sink or disperse my fatal enemies
 Twice sevn the charming daughters of the main
 Around my person wait and bear my train
 Succeed my wish and second my design
 The fairest Deiopeia shall be thine
 And make thee father of a happy line

 To this the god T is yours O queen to will
 The work which duty binds me to fulfil
 These airy kingdoms and this wide command
 Are all the presents of your bounteous hand
 Yours is my sovreigns grace and as your guest
 I sit with gods at their celestial feast
 Raise tempests at your pleasure or subdue
 Dispose of empire which I hold from you

 He said and hurld against the mountain side
 His quivring spear and all the god applied
 The raging winds rush thro the hollow wound
 And dance aloft in air and skim along the ground
 Then settling on the sea the surges sweep
 Raise liquid mountains and disclose the deep
 South East and West with mixd confusion roar
 And roll the foaming billows to the shore
 The cables crack the sailors fearful cries
 Ascend and sable night involves the skies
 And heavn itself is ravishd from their eyes
 Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue
 Then flashing fires the transient light renew
 The face of things a frightful image bears
 And present death in various forms appears
 Struck with unusual fright the Trojan chief
 With lifted hands and eyes invokes relief
 And Thrice and four times happy those he cried
 That under Ilian walls before their parents died
 Tydides bravest of the Grecian train
 Why could not I by that strong arm be slain
 And lie by noble Hector on the plain
 Or great Sarpedon in those bloody fields
 Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields
 Of heroes whose dismemberd hands yet bear
 The dart aloft and clench the pointed spear

 Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails
 Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails
 And rent the sheets the raging billows rise
 And mount the tossing vessels to the skies
 Nor can the shivring oars sustain the blow
 The galley gives her side and turns her prow
 While those astern descending down the steep
 Thro gaping waves behold the boiling deep
 Three ships were hurried by the southern blast
 And on the secret shelves with fury cast
 Those hidden rocks th Ausonian sailors knew
 They calld them Altars when they rose in view
 And showd their spacious backs above the flood
 Three more fierce Eurus in his angry mood
 Dashd on the shallows of the moving sand
 And in mid ocean left them moord aland
 Orontes bark that bore the Lycian crew
 A horrid sight evn in the heros view
 From stem to stern by waves was overborne
 The trembling pilot from his rudder torn
 Was headlong hurld thrice round the ship was tossd
 Then bulgd at once and in the deep was lost
 And here and there above the waves were seen
 Arms pictures precious goods and floating men
 The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way
 And suckd thro loosend planks the rushing sea
 Ilioneus was her chief Alethes old
 Achates faithful Abas young and bold
 Endurd not less their ships with gaping seams
 Admit the deluge of the briny streams

 Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound
 Of raging billows breaking on the ground
 Displeasd and fearing for his watry reign
 He reard his awful head above the main
 Serene in majesty then rolld his eyes
 Around the space of earth and seas and skies
 He saw the Trojan fleet dispersd distressd
 By stormy winds and wintry heavn oppressd
 Full well the god his sisters envy knew
 And what her aims and what her arts pursue
 He summond Eurus and the western blast
 And first an angry glance on both he cast
 Then thus rebukd Audacious winds from whence
 This bold attempt this rebel insolence
 Is it for you to ravage seas and land
 Unauthorizd by my supreme command
 To raise such mountains on the troubled main
 Whom I but first t is fit the billows to restrain
 And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign
 Hence to your lord my royal mandate bear
 The realms of ocean and the fields of air
 Are mine not his By fatal lot to me
 The liquid empire fell and trident of the sea
 His powr to hollow caverns is confind
 There let him reign the jailer of the wind
 With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call
 And boast and bluster in his empty hall
 He spoke and while he spoke he smoothd the sea
 Dispelld the darkness and restord the day
 Cymothoe Triton and the seagreen train
 Of beauteous nymphs the daughters of the main
 Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands
 The god himself with ready trident stands
 And opes the deep and spreads the moving sands
 Then heaves them off the shoals Whereer he guides
 His finny coursers and in triumph rides
 The waves unruffle and the sea subsides
 As when in tumults rise th ignoble crowd
 Mad are their motions and their tongues are loud
 And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly
 And all the rustic arms that fury can supply
 If then some grave and pious man appear
 They hush their noise and lend a listning ear
 He soothes with sober words their angry mood
 And quenches their innate desire of blood
 So when the Father of the Flood appears
 And oer the seas his sovreign trident rears
 Their fury falls he skims the liquid plains
 High on his chariot and with loosend reins
 Majestic moves along and awful peace maintains
 The weary Trojans ply their shatterd oars
 To nearest land and make the Libyan shores

 Within a long recess there lies a bay
 An island shades it from the rolling sea
 And forms a port secure for ships to ride
 Broke by the jutting land on either side
 In double streams the briny waters glide
 Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene
 Appears above and groves for ever green
 A grot is formd beneath with mossy seats
 To rest the Nereids and exclude the heats
 Down thro the crannies of the living walls
 The crystal streams descend in murmring falls
 No haulsers need to bind the vessels here
 Nor bearded anchors for no storms they fear
 Sevn ships within this happy harbor meet
 The thin remainders of the scatterd fleet
 The Trojans worn with toils and spent with woes
 Leap on the welcome land and seek their wishd repose

 First good Achates with repeated strokes
 Of clashing flints their hidden fire provokes
 Short flame succeeds a bed of witherd leaves
 The dying sparkles in their fall receives
 Caught into life in fiery fumes they rise
 And fed with stronger food invade the skies
 The Trojans dropping wet or stand around
 The cheerful blaze or lie along the ground
 Some dry their corn infected with the brine
 Then grind with marbles and prepare to dine
 Aeneas climbs the mountains airy brow
 And takes a prospect of the seas below
 If Capys thence or Antheus he could spy
 Or see the streamers of Caicus fly
 No vessels were in view but on the plain
 Three beamy stags command a lordly train
 Of branching heads the more ignoble throng
 Attend their stately steps and slowly graze along
 He stood and while secure they fed below
 He took the quiver and the trusty bow
 Achates usd to bear the leaders first
 He laid along and then the vulgar piercd
 Nor ceasd his arrows till the shady plain
 Sevn mighty bodies with their blood distain
 For the sevn ships he made an equal share
 And to the port returnd triumphant from the war
 The jars of genrous wine Acestes gift
 When his Trinacrian shores the navy left
 He set abroach and for the feast prepard
 In equal portions with the venson shard
 Thus while he dealt it round the pious chief
 With cheerful words allayd the common grief
 Endure and conquer Jove will soon dispose
 To future good our past and present woes
 With me the rocks of Scylla you have tried
 Th inhuman Cyclops and his den defied
 What greater ills hereafter can you bear
 Resume your courage and dismiss your care
 An hour will come with pleasure to relate
 Your sorrows past as benefits of Fate
 Thro various hazards and events we move
 To Latium and the realms foredoomd by Jove
 Calld to the seat the promise of the skies
 Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise
 Endure the hardships of your present state
 Live and reserve yourselves for better fate

 These words he spoke but spoke not from his heart
 His outward smiles conceald his inward smart
 The jolly crew unmindful of the past
 The quarry share their plenteous dinner haste
 Some strip the skin some portion out the spoil
 The limbs yet trembling in the caldrons boil
 Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil
 Stretchd on the grassy turf at ease they dine
 Restore their strength with meat and cheer their souls with
 wine
 Their hunger thus appeasd their care attends
 The doubtful fortune of their absent friends
 Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess
 Whether to deem em dead or in distress
 Above the rest Aeneas mourns the fate
 Of brave Orontes and th uncertain state
 Of Gyas Lycus and of Amycus
 The day but not their sorrows ended thus

 When from aloft almighty Jove surveys
 Earth air and shores and navigable seas
 At length on Libyan realms he fixd his eyes
 Whom pondring thus on human miseries
 When Venus saw she with a lowly look
 Not free from tears her heavnly sire bespoke

 O King of Gods and Men whose awful hand
 Disperses thunder on the seas and land
 Disposing all with absolute command
 How could my pious son thy powr incense
 Or what alas is vanishd Troys offense
 Our hope of Italy not only lost
 On various seas by various tempests tossd
 But shut from evry shore and barrd from evry coast
 You promisd once a progeny divine
 Of Romans rising from the Trojan line
 In after times should hold the world in awe
 And to the land and ocean give the law
 How is your doom reversd which easd my care
 When Troy was ruind in that cruel war
 Then fates to fates I could oppose but now
 When Fortune still pursues her former blow
 What can I hope What worse can still succeed
 What end of labors has your will decreed
 Antenor from the midst of Grecian hosts
 Could pass secure and pierce th Illyrian coasts
 Where rolling down the steep Timavus raves
 And thro nine channels disembogues his waves
 At length he founded Paduas happy seat
 And gave his Trojans a secure retreat
 There fixd their arms and there renewd their name
 And there in quiet rules and crownd with fame
 But we descended from your sacred line
 Entitled to your heavn and rites divine
 Are banishd earth and for the wrath of one
 Removd from Latium and the promisd throne
 Are these our scepters these our due rewards
 And is it thus that Jove his plighted faith regards

 To whom the Father of th immortal race
 Smiling with that serene indulgent face
 With which he drives the clouds and clears the skies
 First gave a holy kiss then thus replies

 Daughter dismiss thy fears to thy desire
 The fates of thine are fixd and stand entire
 Thou shalt behold thy wishd Lavinian walls
 And ripe for heavn when fate Aeneas calls
 Then shalt thou bear him up sublime to me
 No councils have reversd my firm decree
 And lest new fears disturb thy happy state
 Know I have searchd the mystic rolls of Fate
 Thy son nor is th appointed season far
 In Italy shall wage successful war
 Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field
 And sovreign laws impose and cities build
 Till after evry foe subdued the sun
 Thrice thro the signs his annual race shall run
 This is his time prefixd Ascanius then
 Now calld Iulus shall begin his reign
 He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear
 Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer
 And with hard labor Alba Longa build
 The throne with his succession shall be filld
 Three hundred circuits more then shall be seen
 Ilia the fair a priestess and a queen
 Who full of Mars in time with kindly throes
 Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose
 The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain
 Then Romulus his grandsires throne shall gain
 Of martial towrs the founder shall become
 The people Romans call the city Rome
 To them no bounds of empire I assign
 Nor term of years to their immortal line
 Evn haughty Juno who with endless broils
 Earth seas and heavn and Jove himself turmoils
 At length atond her friendly powr shall join
 To cherish and advance the Trojan line
 The subject world shall Romes dominion own
 And prostrate shall adore the nation of the gown
 An age is ripening in revolving fate
 When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state
 And sweet revenge her conquring sons shall call
 To crush the people that conspird her fall
 Then Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise
 Whose empire ocean and whose fame the skies
 Alone shall bound whom fraught with eastern spoils
 Our heavn the just reward of human toils
 Securely shall repay with rites divine
 And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine
 Then dire debate and impious war shall cease
 And the stern age be softend into peace
 Then banishd Faith shall once again return
 And Vestal fires in hallowd temples burn
 And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain
 The righteous laws and fraud and force restrain
 Janus himself before his fane shall wait
 And keep the dreadful issues of his gate
 With bolts and iron bars within remains
 Imprisond Fury bound in brazen chains
 High on a trophy raisd of useless arms
 He sits and threats the world with vain alarms

 He said and sent Cyllenius with command
 To free the ports and ope the Punic land
 To Trojan guests lest ignorant of fate
 The queen might force them from her town and state
 Down from the steep of heavn Cyllenius flies
 And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies
 Soon on the Libyan shore descends the god
 Performs his message and displays his rod
 The surly murmurs of the people cease
 And as the fates requird they give the peace
 The queen herself suspends the rigid laws
 The Trojans pities and protects their cause

 Meantime in shades of night Aeneas lies
 Care seizd his soul and sleep forsook his eyes
 But when the sun restord the cheerful day
 He rose the coast and country to survey
 Anxious and eager to discover more
 It lookd a wild uncultivated shore
 But whether humankind or beasts alone
 Possessd the newfound region was unknown
 Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides
 Tall trees surround the mountains shady sides
 The bending brow above a safe retreat provides
 Armd with two pointed darts he leaves his friends
 And true Achates on his steps attends
 Lo in the deep recesses of the wood
 Before his eyes his goddess mother stood
 A huntress in her habit and her mien
 Her dress a maid her air confessd a queen
 Bare were her knees and knots her garments bind
 Loose was her hair and wantond in the wind
 Her hand sustaind a bow her quiver hung behind
 She seemd a virgin of the Spartan blood
 With such array Harpalyce bestrode
 Her Thracian courser and outstrippd the rapid flood
 Ho strangers have you lately seen she said
 One of my sisters like myself arrayd
 Who crossd the lawn or in the forest strayd
 A painted quiver at her back she bore
 Varied with spots a lynxs hide she wore
 And at full cry pursued the tusky boar

 Thus Venus thus her son replied again
 None of your sisters have we heard or seen
 O virgin or what other name you bear
 Above that style O more than mortal fair
 Your voice and mien celestial birth betray
 If as you seem the sister of the day
 Or one at least of chaste Dianas train
 Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain
 But tell a stranger long in tempests tossd
 What earth we tread and who commands the coast
 Then on your name shall wretched mortals call
 And offerd victims at your altars fall
 I dare not she replied assume the name
 Of goddess or celestial honors claim
 For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear
 And purple buskins oer their ankles wear
 Know gentle youth in Libyan lands you are
 A people rude in peace and rough in war
 The rising city which from far you see
 Is Carthage and a Tyrian colony
 Phoenician Dido rules the growing state
 Who fled from Tyre to shun her brothers hate
 Great were her wrongs her story full of fate
 Which I will sum in short Sichaeus known
 For wealth and brother to the Punic throne
 Possessd fair Didos bed and either heart
 At once was wounded with an equal dart
 Her father gave her yet a spotless maid
 Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter swayd
 One who condemnd divine and human laws
 Then strife ensued and cursed gold the cause
 The monarch blinded with desire of wealth
 With steel invades his brothers life by stealth
 Before the sacred altar made him bleed
 And long from her conceald the cruel deed
 Some tale some new pretense he daily coind
 To soothe his sister and delude her mind
 At length in dead of night the ghost appears
 Of her unhappy lord the specter stares
 And with erected eyes his bloody bosom bares
 The cruel altars and his fate he tells
 And the dire secret of his house reveals
 Then warns the widow with her household gods
 To seek a refuge in remote abodes
 Last to support her in so long a way
 He shows her where his hidden treasure lay
 Admonishd thus and seizd with mortal fright
 The queen provides companions of her flight
 They meet and all combine to leave the state
 Who hate the tyrant or who fear his hate
 They seize a fleet which ready riggd they find
 Nor is Pygmalions treasure left behind
 The vessels heavy laden put to sea
 With prosprous winds a woman leads the way
 I know not if by stress of weather drivn
 Or was their fatal course disposd by Heavn
 At last they landed where from far your eyes
 May view the turrets of new Carthage rise
 There bought a space of ground which Byrsa calld
 From the bulls hide they first inclosd and walld
 But whence are you what country claims your birth
 What seek you strangers on our Libyan earth

 To whom with sorrow streaming from his eyes
 And deeply sighing thus her son replies
 Could you with patience hear or I relate
 O nymph the tedious annals of our fate
 Thro such a train of woes if I should run
 The day would sooner than the tale be done
 From ancient Troy by force expelld we came
 If you by chance have heard the Trojan name
 On various seas by various tempests tossd
 At length we landed on your Libyan coast
 The good Aeneas am I calld a name
 While Fortune favord not unknown to fame
 My household gods companions of my woes
 With pious care I rescued from our foes
 To fruitful Italy my course was bent
 And from the King of Heavn is my descent
 With twice ten sail I crossd the Phrygian sea
 Fate and my mother goddess led my way
 Scarce sevn the thin remainders of my fleet
 From storms preservd within your harbor meet
 Myself distressd an exile and unknown
 Debarrd from Europe and from Asia thrown
 In Libyan desarts wander thus alone

 His tender parent could no longer bear
 But interposing sought to soothe his care
 Whoeer you are not unbelovd by Heavn
 Since on our friendly shore your ships are drivn
 Have courage to the gods permit the rest
 And to the queen expose your just request
 Now take this earnest of success for more
 Your scatterd fleet is joind upon the shore
 The winds are changd your friends from danger free
 Or I renounce my skill in augury
 Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move
 And stoop with closing pinions from above
 Whom late the bird of Jove had drivn along
 And thro the clouds pursued the scattring throng
 Now all united in a goodly team
 They skim the ground and seek the quiet stream
 As they with joy returning clap their wings
 And ride the circuit of the skies in rings
 Not otherwise your ships and evry friend
 Already hold the port or with swift sails descend
 No more advice is needful but pursue
 The path before you and the town in view

 Thus having said she turnd and made appear
 Her neck refulgent and disheveld hair
 Which flowing from her shoulders reachd the ground
 And widely spread ambrosial scents around
 In length of train descends her sweeping gown
 And by her graceful walk the Queen of Love is known
 The prince pursued the parting deity
 With words like these Ah whither do you fly
 Unkind and cruel to deceive your son
 In borrowd shapes and his embrace to shun
 Never to bless my sight but thus unknown
 And still to speak in accents not your own
 Against the goddess these complaints he made
 But took the path and her commands obeyd
 They march obscure for Venus kindly shrouds
 With mists their persons and involves in clouds
 That thus unseen their passage none might stay
 Or force to tell the causes of their way
 This part performd the goddess flies sublime
 To visit Paphos and her native clime
 Where garlands ever green and ever fair
 With vows are offerd and with solemn prayr
 A hundred altars in her temple smoke
 A thousand bleeding hearts her powr invoke

 They climb the next ascent and looking down
 Now at a nearer distance view the town
 The prince with wonder sees the stately towrs
 Which late were huts and shepherds homely bowrs
 The gates and streets and hears from evry part
 The noise and busy concourse of the mart
 The toiling Tyrians on each other call
 To ply their labor some extend the wall
 Some build the citadel the brawny throng
 Or dig or push unwieldly stones along
 Some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground
 Which first designd with ditches they surround
 Some laws ordain and some attend the choice
 Of holy senates and elect by voice
 Here some design a mole while others there
 Lay deep foundations for a theater
 From marble quarries mighty columns hew
 For ornaments of scenes and future view
 Such is their toil and such their busy pains
 As exercise the bees in flowry plains
 When winter past and summer scarce begun
 Invites them forth to labor in the sun
 Some lead their youth abroad while some condense
 Their liquid store and some in cells dispense
 Some at the gate stand ready to receive
 The golden burthen and their friends relieve
 All with united force combine to drive
 The lazy drones from the laborious hive
 With envy stung they view each others deeds
 The fragrant work with diligence proceeds
 Thrice happy you whose walls already rise
 Aeneas said and viewd with lifted eyes
 Their lofty towrs then entiring at the gate
 Conceald in clouds prodigious to relate
 He mixd unmarkd among the busy throng
 Borne by the tide and passd unseen along

 Full in the center of the town there stood
 Thick set with trees a venerable wood
 The Tyrians landing near this holy ground
 And digging here a prosprous omen found
 From under earth a coursers head they drew
 Their growth and future fortune to foreshew
 This fated sign their foundress Juno gave
 Of a soil fruitful and a people brave
 Sidonian Dido here with solemn state
 Did Junos temple build and consecrate
 Enrichd with gifts and with a golden shrine
 But more the goddess made the place divine
 On brazen steps the marble threshold rose
 And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose
 The rafters are with brazen covrings crownd
 The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound
 What first Aeneas this place beheld
 Revivd his courage and his fear expelld
 For while expecting there the queen he raisd
 His wondring eyes and round the temple gazd
 Admird the fortune of the rising town
 The striving artists and their arts renown
 He saw in order painted on the wall
 Whatever did unhappy Troy befall
 The wars that fame around the world had blown
 All to the life and evry leader known
 There Agamemnon Priam here he spies
 And fierce Achilles who both kings defies
 He stoppd and weeping said O friend evn here
 The monuments of Trojan woes appear
 Our known disasters fill evn foreign lands
 See there where old unhappy Priam stands
 Evn the mute walls relate the warriors fame
 And Trojan griefs the Tyrians pity claim
 He said his tears a ready passage find
 Devouring what he saw so well designd
 And with an empty picture fed his mind
 For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield
 And here the trembling Trojans quit the field
 Pursued by fierce Achilles thro the plain
 On his high chariot driving oer the slain
 The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew
 By their white sails betrayd to nightly view
 And wakeful Diomede whose cruel sword
 The sentries slew nor spard their slumbring lord
 Then took the fiery steeds ere yet the food
 Of Troy they taste or drink the Xanthian flood
 Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied
 Achilles and unequal combat tried
 Then where the boy disarmd with loosend reins
 Was by his horses hurried oer the plains
 Hung by the neck and hair and draggd around
 The hostile spear yet sticking in his wound
 With tracks of blood inscribd the dusty ground
 Meantime the Trojan dames oppressd with woe
 To Pallas fane in long procession go
 In hopes to reconcile their heavnly foe
 They weep they beat their breasts they rend their hair
 And rich embroiderd vests for presents bear
 But the stern goddess stands unmovd with prayr
 Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew
 The corpse of Hector whom in fight he slew
 Here Priam sues and there for sums of gold
 The lifeless body of his son is sold
 So sad an object and so well expressd
 Drew sighs and groans from the grievd heros breast
 To see the figure of his lifeless friend
 And his old sire his helpless hand extend
 Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train
 Mixd in the bloody battle on the plain
 And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew
 His pompous ensigns and his Indian crew
 Penthisilea there with haughty grace
 Leads to the wars an Amazonian race
 In their right hands a pointed dart they wield
 The left for ward sustains the lunar shield
 Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws
 Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes
 And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose

 Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes
 Fixd on the walls with wonder and surprise
 The beauteous Dido with a numrous train
 And pomp of guards ascends the sacred fane
 Such on Eurotas banks or Cynthus height
 Diana seems and so she charms the sight
 When in the dance the graceful goddess leads
 The choir of nymphs and overtops their heads
 Known by her quiver and her lofty mien
 She walks majestic and she looks their queen
 Latona sees her shine above the rest
 And feeds with secret joy her silent breast
 Such Dido was with such becoming state
 Amidst the crowd she walks serenely great
 Their labor to her future sway she speeds
 And passing with a gracious glance proceeds
 Then mounts the throne high placd before the shrine
 In crowds around the swarming people join
 She takes petitions and dispenses laws
 Hears and determines evry private cause
 Their tasks in equal portions she divides
 And where unequal there by lots decides
 Another way by chance Aeneas bends
 His eyes and unexpected sees his friends
 Antheus Sergestus grave Cloanthus strong
 And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng
 Whom late the tempest on the billows tossd
 And widely scatterd on another coast
 The prince unseen surprisd with wonder stands
 And longs with joyful haste to join their hands
 But doubtful of the wishd event he stays
 And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys
 Impatient till they told their present state
 And where they left their ships and what their fate
 And why they came and what was their request
 For these were sent commissiond by the rest
 To sue for leave to land their sickly men
 And gain admission to the gracious queen
 Entring with cries they filld the holy fane
 Then thus with lowly voice Ilioneus began

 O queen indulgd by favor of the gods
 To found an empire in these new abodes
 To build a town with statutes to restrain
 The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign
 We wretched Trojans tossd on evry shore
 From sea to sea thy clemency implore
 Forbid the fires our shipping to deface
 Receive th unhappy fugitives to grace
 And spare the remnant of a pious race
 We come not with design of wasteful prey
 To drive the country force the swains away
 Nor such our strength nor such is our desire
 The vanquishd dare not to such thoughts aspire
 A land there is Hesperia namd of old
 The soil is fruitful and the men are bold
 Th Oenotrians held it once by common fame
 Now calld Italia from the leaders name
 To that sweet region was our voyage bent
 When winds and evry warring element
 Disturbd our course and far from sight of land
 Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand
 The sea came on the South with mighty roar
 Dispersd and dashd the rest upon the rocky shore
 Those few you see escapd the Storm and fear
 Unless you interpose a shipwreck here
 What men what monsters what inhuman race
 What laws what barbrous customs of the place
 Shut up a desart shore to drowning men
 And drive us to the cruel seas again
 If our hard fortune no compassion draws
 Nor hospitable rights nor human laws
 The gods are just and will revenge our cause
 Aeneas was our prince a juster lord
 Or nobler warrior never drew a sword
 Observant of the right religious of his word
 If yet he lives and draws this vital air
 Nor we his friends of safety shall despair
 Nor you great queen these offices repent
 Which he will equal and perhaps augment
 We want not cities nor Sicilian coasts
 Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts
 Permit our ships a shelter on your shores
 Refitted from your woods with planks and oars
 That if our prince be safe we may renew
 Our destind course and Italy pursue
 But if O best of men the Fates ordain
 That thou art swallowd in the Libyan main
 And if our young Iulus be no more
 Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore
 That we to good Acestes may return
 And with our friends our common losses mourn
 Thus spoke Ilioneus the Trojan crew
 With cries and clamors his request renew

 The modest queen a while with downcast eyes
 Ponderd the speech then briefly thus replies
 Trojans dismiss your fears my cruel fate
 And doubts attending an unsettled state
 Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes
 Who has not heard the story of your woes
 The name and fortune of your native place
 The fame and valor of the Phrygian race
 We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense
 Nor so remote from Phoebus influence
 Whether to Latian shores your course is bent
 Or drivn by tempests from your first intent
 You seek the good Acestes government
 Your men shall be receivd your fleet repaird
 And sail with ships of convoy for your guard
 Or would you stay and join your friendly powrs
 To raise and to defend the Tyrian towrs
 My wealth my city and myself are yours
 And would to Heavn the Storm you felt would bring
 On Carthaginian coasts your wandring king
 My people shall by my command explore
 The ports and creeks of evry winding shore
 And towns and wilds and shady woods in quest
 Of so renownd and so desird a guest

 Raisd in his mind the Trojan hero stood
 And longd to break from out his ambient cloud
 Achates found it and thus urgd his way
 From whence O goddessborn this long delay
 What more can you desire your welcome sure
 Your fleet in safety and your friends secure
 One only wants and him we saw in vain
 Oppose the Storm and swallowd in the main
 Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid
 The rest agrees with what your mother said
 Scarce had he spoken when the cloud gave way
 The mists flew upward and dissolvd in day

 The Trojan chief appeard in open sight
 August in visage and serenely bright
 His mother goddess with her hands divine
 Had formd his curling locks and made his temples shine
 And givn his rolling eyes a sparkling grace
 And breathd a youthful vigor on his face
 Like polishd ivory beauteous to behold
 Or Parian marble when enchasd in gold
 Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke
 And thus with manly modesty he spoke

 He whom you seek am I by tempests tossd
 And savd from shipwreck on your Libyan coast
 Presenting gracious queen before your throne
 A prince that owes his life to you alone
 Fair majesty the refuge and redress
 Of those whom fate pursues and wants oppress
 You who your pious offices employ
 To save the relics of abandond Troy
 Receive the shipwreckd on your friendly shore
 With hospitable rites relieve the poor
 Associate in your town a wandring train
 And strangers in your palace entertain
 What thanks can wretched fugitives return
 Who scatterd thro the world in exile mourn
 The gods if gods to goodness are inclind
 If acts of mercy touch their heavnly mind
 And more than all the gods your genrous heart
 Conscious of worth requite its own desert
 In you this age is happy and this earth
 And parents more than mortal gave you birth
 While rolling rivers into seas shall run
 And round the space of heavn the radiant sun
 While trees the mountain tops with shades supply
 Your honor name and praise shall never die
 Whateer abode my fortune has assignd
 Your image shall be present in my mind
 Thus having said he turnd with pious haste
 And joyful his expecting friends embracd
 With his right hand Ilioneus was gracd
 Serestus with his left then to his breast
 Cloanthus and the noble Gyas pressd
 And so by turns descended to the rest

 The Tyrian queen stood fixd upon his face
 Pleasd with his motions ravishd with his grace
 Admird his fortunes more admird the man
 Then recollected stood and thus began
 What fate O goddessborn what angry powrs
 Have cast you shipwrackd on our barren shores
 Are you the great Aeneas known to fame
 Who from celestial seed your lineage claim

 The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore
 To famd Anchises on th Idaean shore
 It calls into my mind tho then a child
 When Teucer came from Salamis exild
 And sought my fathers aid to be restord
 My father Belus then with fire and sword
 Invaded Cyprus made the region bare
 And conquring finishd the successful war
 From him the Trojan siege I understood
 The Grecian chiefs and your illustrious blood
 Your foe himself the Dardan valor praisd
 And his own ancestry from Trojans raisd
 Enter my noble guest and you shall find
 If not a costly welcome yet a kind
 For I myself like you have been distressd
 Till Heavn afforded me this place of rest
 Like you an alien in a land unknown
 I learn to pity woes so like my own
 She said and to the palace led her guest
 Then offerd incense and proclaimd a feast
 Nor yet less careful for her absent friends
 Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends
 Besides a hundred boars a hundred lambs
 With bleating cries attend their milky dams
 And jars of genrous wine and spacious bowls
 She gives to cheer the sailors drooping souls
 Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls
 And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls
 On Tyrian carpets richly wrought they dine
 With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine
 And antique vases all of gold embossd
 The gold itself inferior to the cost
 Of curious work where on the sides were seen
 The fights and figures of illustrious men
 From their first founder to the present queen

 The good Aeneas paternal care
 Iulus absence could no longer bear
 Dispatchd Achates to the ships in haste
 To give a glad relation of the past
 And fraught with precious gifts to bring the boy
 Snatchd from the ruins of unhappy Troy
 A robe of tissue stiff with golden wire
 An upper vest once Helens rich attire
 From Argos by the famd adultress brought
 With golden flowrs and winding foliage wrought
 Her mother Ledas present when she came
 To ruin Troy and set the world on flame
 The scepter Priams eldest daughter bore
 Her orient necklace and the crown she wore
 Of double texture glorious to behold
 One order set with gems and one with gold
 Instructed thus the wise Achates goes
 And in his diligence his duty shows

 But Venus anxious for her sons affairs
 New counsels tries and new designs prepares
 That Cupid should assume the shape and face
 Of sweet Ascanius and the sprightly grace
 Should bring the presents in her nephews stead
 And in Elizas veins the gentle poison shed
 For much she feard the Tyrians doubletongued
 And knew the town to Junos care belongd
 These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke
 And thus alarmd to winged Love she spoke
 My son my strength whose mighty powr alone
 Controls the Thundrer on his awful throne
 To thee thy muchafflicted mother flies
 And on thy succor and thy faith relies
 Thou knowst my son how Joves revengeful wife
 By force and fraud attempts thy brothers life
 And often hast thou mournd with me his pains
 Him Dido now with blandishment detains
 But I suspect the town where Juno reigns
 For this t is needful to prevent her art
 And fire with love the proud Phoenicians heart
 A love so violent so strong so sure
 As neither age can change nor art can cure
 How this may be performd now take my mind
 Ascanius by his father is designd
 To come with presents laden from the port
 To gratify the queen and gain the court
 I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep
 And ravishd in Idalian bowrs to keep
 Or high Cythera that the sweet deceit
 May pass unseen and none prevent the cheat
 Take thou his form and shape I beg the grace
 But only for a nights revolving space
 Thyself a boy assume a boys dissembled face
 That when amidst the fervor of the feast
 The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast
 And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains
 Thou mayst infuse thy venom in her veins
 The God of Love obeys and sets aside
 His bow and quiver and his plumy pride
 He walks Iulus in his mothers sight
 And in the sweet resemblance takes delight

 The goddess then to young Ascanius flies
 And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes
 Lulld in her lap amidst a train of Loves
 She gently bears him to her blissful groves
 Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head
 And softly lays him on a flowry bed
 Cupid meantime assumd his form and face
 Follwing Achates with a shorter pace
 And brought the gifts The queen already sate
 Amidst the Trojan lords in shining state
 High on a golden bed her princely guest
 Was next her side in order sate the rest
 Then canisters with bread are heapd on high
 Th attendants water for their hands supply
 And having washd with silken towels dry
 Next fifty handmaids in long order bore
 The censers and with fumes the gods adore
 Then youths and virgins twice as many join
 To place the dishes and to serve the wine
 The Tyrian train admitted to the feast
 Approach and on the painted couches rest
 All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze
 But view the beauteous boy with more amaze
 His rosycolord cheeks his radiant eyes
 His motions voice and shape and all the gods disguise
 Nor pass unpraisd the vest and veil divine
 Which wandring foliage and rich flowrs entwine
 But far above the rest the royal dame
 Already doomd to loves disastrous flame
 With eyes insatiate and tumultuous joy
 Beholds the presents and admires the boy
 The guileful god about the hero long
 With childrens play and false embraces hung
 Then sought the queen she took him to her arms
 With greedy pleasure and devourd his charms
 Unhappy Dido little thought what guest
 How dire a god she drew so near her breast
 But he not mindless of his mothers prayr
 Works in the pliant bosom of the fair
 And molds her heart anew and blots her former care
 The dead is to the living love resignd
 And all Aeneas enters in her mind

 Now when the rage of hunger was appeasd
 The meat removd and evry guest was pleasd
 The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crownd
 And thro the palace cheerful cries resound
 From gilded roofs depending lamps display
 Nocturnal beams that emulate the day
 A golden bowl that shone with gems divine
 The queen commanded to be crownd with wine
 The bowl that Belus usd and all the Tyrian line
 Then silence thro the hall proclaimd she spoke
 O hospitable Jove we thus invoke
 With solemn rites thy sacred name and powr
 Bless to both nations this auspicious hour
 So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line
 In lasting concord from this day combine
 Thou Bacchus god of joys and friendly cheer
 And gracious Juno both be present here
 And you my lords of Tyre your vows address
 To Heavn with mine to ratify the peace
 The goblet then she took with nectar crownd
 Sprinkling the first libations on the ground
 And raisd it to her mouth with sober grace
 Then sipping offerd to the next in place
 T was Bitias whom she calld a thirsty soul
 He took challenge and embracd the bowl
 With pleasure swilld the gold nor ceasd to draw
 Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw
 The goblet goes around Iopas brought
 His golden lyre and sung what ancient Atlas taught
 The various labors of the wandring moon
 And whence proceed th eclipses of the sun
 Th original of men and beasts and whence
 The rains arise and fires their warmth dispense
 And fixd and erring stars dispose their influence
 What shakes the solid earth what cause delays
 The summer nights and shortens winter days
 With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song
 Those peals are echod by the Trojan throng
 Th unhappy queen with talk prolongd the night
 And drank large draughts of love with vast delight
 Of Priam much enquird of Hector more
 Then askd what arms the swarthy Memnon wore
 What troops he landed on the Trojan shore
 The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse
 And fierce Achilles with his matchless force
 At length as fate and her ill stars requird
 To hear the series of the war desird
 Relate at large my godlike guest she said
 The Grecian stratagems the town betrayd
 The fatal issue of so long a war
 Your flight your wandrings and your woes declare
 For since on evry sea on evry coast
 Your men have been distressd your navy tossd
 Sevn times the sun has either tropic viewd
 The winter banishd and the spring renewd




 BOOK II

 All were attentive to the godlike man
 When from his lofty couch he thus began
 Great queen what you command me to relate
 Renews the sad remembrance of our fate
 An empire from its old foundations rent
 And evry woe the Trojans underwent
 A peopled city made a desart place
 All that I saw and part of which I was
 Not evn the hardest of our foes could hear
 Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear
 And now the latter watch of wasting night
 And setting stars to kindly rest invite
 But since you take such intrest in our woe
 And Troys disastrous end desire to know
 I will restrain my tears and briefly tell
 What in our last and fatal night befell

 By destiny compelld and in despair
 The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war
 And by Minervas aid a fabric reard
 Which like a steed of monstrous height appeard
 The sides were plankd with pine they feignd it made
 For their return and this the vow they paid
 Thus they pretend but in the hollow side
 Selected numbers of their soldiers hide
 With inward arms the dire machine they load
 And iron bowels stuff the dark abode
 In sight of Troy lies Tenedos an isle
 While Fortune did on Priams empire smile
 Renownd for wealth but since a faithless bay
 Where ships exposd to wind and weather lay
 There was their fleet conceald We thought for Greece
 Their sails were hoisted and our fears release
 The Trojans coopd within their walls so long
 Unbar their gates and issue in a throng
 Like swarming bees and with delight survey
 The camp deserted where the Grecians lay
 The quarters of the sevral chiefs they showd
 Here Phoenix here Achilles made abode
 Here joind the battles there the navy rode
 Part on the pile their wondring eyes employ
 The pile by Pallas raisd to ruin Troy
 Thymoetes first t is doubtful whether hird
 Or so the Trojan destiny requird
 Movd that the ramparts might be broken down
 To lodge the monster fabric in the town
 But Capys and the rest of sounder mind
 The fatal present to the flames designed
 Or to the watry deep at least to bore
 The hollow sides and hidden frauds explore
 The giddy vulgar as their fancies guide
 With noise say nothing and in parts divide
 Laocoon followd by a numrous crowd
 Ran from the fort and cried from far aloud
 O wretched countrymen what fury reigns
 What more than madness has possessd your brains
 Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone
 And are Ulysses arts no better known
 This hollow fabric either must inclose
 Within its blind recess our secret foes
 Or t is an engine raisd above the town
 T oerlook the walls and then to batter down
 Somewhat is sure designd by fraud or force
 Trust not their presents nor admit the horse
 Thus having said against the steed he threw
 His forceful spear which hissing as flew
 Piercd thro the yielding planks of jointed wood
 And trembling in the hollow belly stood
 The sides transpiercd return a rattling sound
 And groans of Greeks inclosd come issuing thro the wound
 And had not Heavn the fall of Troy designd
 Or had not men been fated to be blind
 Enough was said and done tinspire a better mind
 Then had our lances piercd the treachrous wood
 And Ilian towrs and Priams empire stood
 Meantime with shouts the Trojan shepherds bring
 A captive Greek in bands before the king
 Taken to take who made himself their prey
 T impose on their belief and Troy betray
 Fixd on his aim and obstinately bent
 To die undaunted or to circumvent
 About the captive tides of Trojans flow
 All press to see and some insult the foe
 Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguisd
 Behold a nation in a man comprisd
 Trembling the miscreant stood unarmd and bound
 He stard and rolld his haggard eyes around
 Then said Alas what earth remains what sea
 Is open to receive unhappy me
 What fate a wretched fugitive attends
 Scornd by my foes abandond by my friends
 He said and sighd and cast a rueful eye
 Our pity kindles and our passions die
 We cheer youth to make his own defense
 And freely tell us what he was and whence
 What news he could impart we long to know
 And what to credit from a captive foe

 His fear at length dismissd he said Whateer
 My fate ordains my words shall be sincere
 I neither can nor dare my birth disclaim
 Greece is my country Sinon is my name
 Tho plungd by Fortunes powr in misery
 T is not in Fortunes powr to make me lie
 If any chance has hither brought the name
 Of Palamedes not unknown to fame
 Who sufferd from the malice of the times
 Accusd and sentencd for pretended crimes
 Because these fatal wars he would prevent
 Whose death the wretched Greeks too late lament
 Me then a boy my father poor and bare
 Of other means committed to his care
 His kinsman and companion in the war
 While Fortune favord while his arms support
 The cause and ruld the counsels of the court
 I made some figure there nor was my name
 Obscure nor I without my share of fame
 But when Ulysses with fallacious arts
 Had made impression in the peoples hearts
 And forgd a treason in my patrons name
 I speak of things too far divulgd by fame
 My kinsman fell Then I without support
 In private mournd his loss and left the court
 Mad as I was I could not bear his fate
 With silent grief but loudly blamd the state
 And cursd the direful author of my woes
 T was told again and hence my ruin rose
 I threatend if indulgent Heavn once more
 Would land me safely on my native shore
 His death with double vengeance to restore
 This movd the murderers hate and soon ensued
 Th effects of malice from a man so proud
 Ambiguous rumors thro the camp he spread
 And sought by treason my devoted head
 New crimes invented left unturnd no stone
 To make my guilt appear and hide his own
 Till Calchas was by force and threatning wrought
 But why why dwell I on that anxious thought
 If on my nation just revenge you seek
 And t is t appear a foe t appear a Greek
 Already you my name and country know
 Assuage your thirst of blood and strike the blow
 My death will both the kingly brothers please
 And set insatiate Ithacus at ease
 This fair unfinishd tale these broken starts
 Raisd expectations in our longing hearts
 Unknowing as we were in Grecian arts
 His former trembling once again renewd
 With acted fear the villain thus pursued

 Long had the Grecians tird with fruitless care
 And wearied with an unsuccessful war
 Resolvd to raise the siege and leave the town
 And had the gods permitted they had gone
 But oft the wintry seas and southern winds
 Withstood their passage home and changd their minds
 Portents and prodigies their souls amazd
 But most when this stupendous pile was raisd
 Then flaming meteors hung in air were seen
 And thunders rattled thro a sky serene
 Dismayd and fearful of some dire event
 Eurypylus t enquire their fate was sent
 He from the gods this dreadful answer brought

 O Grecians when the Trojan shores you sought
 Your passage with a virgins blood was bought
 So must your safe return be bought again
 And Grecian blood once more atone the main
 The spreading rumor round the people ran
 All feard and each believd himself the man
 Ulysses took th advantage of their fright
 Calld Calchas and producd in open sight
 Then bade him name the wretch ordaind by fate
 The public victim to redeem the state
 Already some presagd the dire event
 And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant
 For twice five days the good old seer withstood
 Th intended treason and was dumb to blood
 Till tird with endless clamors and pursuit
 Of Ithacus he stood no longer mute
 But as it was agreed pronouncd that I
 Was destind by the wrathful gods to die
 All praisd the sentence pleasd the storm should fall
 On one alone whose fury threatend all
 The dismal day was come the priests prepare
 Their leavend cakes and fillets for my hair
 I followd natures laws and must avow
 I broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow
 Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay
 Secure of safety when they saild away
 But now what further hopes for me remain
 To see my friends or native soil again
 My tender infants or my careful sire
 Whom they returning will to death require
 Will perpetrate on them their first design
 And take the forfeit of their heads for mine
 Which O if pity mortal minds can move
 If there be faith below or gods above
 If innocence and truth can claim desert
 Ye Trojans from an injurd wretch avert

 False tears true pity move the king commands
 To loose his fetters and unbind his hands
 Then adds these friendly words Dismiss thy fears
 Forget the Greeks be mine as thou wert theirs
 But truly tell was it for force or guile
 Or some religious end you raisd the pile
 Thus said the king He full of fraudful arts
 This wellinvented tale for truth imparts
 Ye lamps of heavn he said and lifted high
 His hands now free thou venerable sky
 Inviolable powrs adord with dread
 Ye fatal fillets that once bound this head
 Ye sacred altars from whose flames I fled
 Be all of you adjurd and grant I may
 Without a crime th ungrateful Greeks betray
 Reveal the secrets of the guilty state
 And justly punish whom I justly hate
 But you O king preserve the faith you gave
 If I to save myself your empire save
 The Grecian hopes and all th attempts they made
 Were only founded on Minervas aid
 But from the time when impious Diomede
 And false Ulysses that inventive head
 Her fatal image from the temple drew
 The sleeping guardians of the castle slew
 Her virgin statue with their bloody hands
 Polluted and profand her holy bands
 From thence the tide of fortune left their shore
 And ebbd much faster than it flowd before
 Their courage languishd as their hopes decayd
 And Pallas now averse refusd her aid
 Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare
 Her alterd mind and alienated care
 When first her fatal image touchd the ground
 She sternly cast her glaring eyes around
 That sparkled as they rolld and seemd to threat
 Her heavnly limbs distilld a briny sweat
 Thrice from the ground she leapd was seen to wield
 Her brandishd lance and shake her horrid shield
 Then Calchas bade our host for flight
 And hope no conquest from the tedious war
 Till first they saild for Greece with prayrs besought
 Her injurd powr and better omens brought
 And now their navy plows the watry main
 Yet soon expect it on your shores again
 With Pallas pleasd as Calchas did ordain
 But first to reconcile the blueeyd maid
 For her stoln statue and her towr betrayd
 Warnd by the seer to her offended name
 We raisd and dedicate this wondrous frame
 So lofty lest thro your forbidden gates
 It pass and intercept our better fates
 For once admitted there our hopes are lost
 And Troy may then a new Palladium boast
 For so religion and the gods ordain
 That if you violate with hands profane
 Minervas gift your town in flames shall burn
 Which omen O ye gods on Graecia turn
 But if it climb with your assisting hands
 The Trojan walls and in the city stands
 Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn
 And the reverse of fate on us return

 With such deceits he gaind their easy hearts
 Too prone to credit his perfidious arts
 What Diomede nor Thetis greater son
 A thousand ships nor ten years siege had done
 False tears and fawning words the city won

 A greater omen and of worse portent
 Did our unwary minds with fear torment
 Concurring to produce the dire event
 Laocoon Neptunes priest by lot that year
 With solemn pomp then sacrificd a steer
 When dreadful to behold from sea we spied
 Two serpents rankd abreast the seas divide
 And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide
 Their flaming crests above the waves they show
 Their bellies seem to burn the seas below
 Their speckled tails advance to steer their course
 And on the sounding shore the flying billows force
 And now the strand and now the plain they held
 Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were filld
 Their nimble tongues they brandishd as they came
 And lickd their hissing jaws that sputterd flame
 We fled amazd their destind way they take
 And to Laocoon and his children make
 And first around the tender boys they wind
 Then with their sharpend fangs their limbs and bodies grind
 The wretched father running to their aid
 With pious haste but vain they next invade
 Twice round his waist their winding volumes rolld
 And twice about his gasping throat they fold
 The priest thus doubly chokd their crests divide
 And towring oer his head in triumph ride
 With both his hands he labors at the knots
 His holy fillets the blue venom blots
 His roaring fills the flitting air around
 Thus when an ox receives a glancing wound
 He breaks his bands the fatal altar flies
 And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies
 Their tasks performd the serpents quit their prey
 And to the towr of Pallas make their way
 Couchd at her feet they lie protected there
 By her large buckler and protended spear
 Amazement seizes all the genral cry
 Proclaims Laocoon justly doomd to die
 Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood
 And dared to violate the sacred wood
 All vote t admit the steed that vows be paid
 And incense offerd to th offended maid
 A spacious breach is made the town lies bare
 Some hoistinglevers some the wheels prepare
 And fasten to the horses feet the rest
 With cables haul along th unwieldly beast
 Each on his fellow for assistance calls
 At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls
 Big with destruction Boys with chaplets crownd
 And choirs of virgins sing and dance around
 Thus raisd aloft and then descending down
 It enters oer our heads and threats the town
 O sacred city built by hands divine
 O valiant heroes of the Trojan line
 Four times he struck as oft the clashing sound
 Of arms was heard and inward groans rebound
 Yet mad with zeal and blinded with our fate
 We haul along the horse in solemn state
 Then place the dire portent within the towr
 Cassandra cried and cursd th unhappy hour
 Foretold our fate but by the gods decree
 All heard and none believd the prophecy
 With branches we the fanes adorn and waste
 In jollity the day ordaind to be the last
 Meantime the rapid heavns rolld down the light
 And on the shaded ocean rushd the night
 Our men secure nor guards nor sentries held
 But easy sleep their weary limbs compelld
 The Grecians had embarkd their naval powrs
 From Tenedos and sought our wellknown shores
 Safe under covert of the silent night
 And guided by th imperial galleys light
 When Sinon favord by the partial gods
 Unlockd the horse and opd his dark abodes
 Restord to vital air our hidden foes
 Who joyful from their long confinement rose
 Tysander bold and Sthenelus their guide
 And dire Ulysses down the cable slide
 Then Thoas Athamas and Pyrrhus haste
 Nor was the Podalirian hero last
 Nor injurd Menelaus nor the famd
 Epeus who the fatal engine framd
 A nameless crowd succeed their forces join
 T invade the town oppressd with sleep and wine
 Those few they find awake first meet their fate
 Then to their fellows they unbar the gate

 T was in the dead of night when sleep repairs
 Our bodies worn with toils our minds with cares
 When Hectors ghost before my sight appears
 A bloody shroud he seemd and bathd in tears
 Such as he was when by Pelides slain
 Thessalian coursers draggd him oer the plain
 Swoln were his feet as when the thongs were thrust
 Thro the bord holes his body black with dust
 Unlike that Hector who returnd from toils
 Of war triumphant in Aeacian spoils
 Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire
 And launchd against their navy Phrygian fire
 His hair and beard stood stiffend with his gore
 And all the wounds he for his country bore
 Now streamd afresh and with new purple ran
 I wept to see the visionary man
 And while my trance continued thus began
 O light of Trojans and support of Troy
 Thy fathers champion and thy countrys joy
 O long expected by thy friends from whence
 Art thou so late returnd for our defense
 Do we behold thee wearied as we are
 With length of labors and with toils of war
 After so many funrals of thy own
 Art thou restord to thy declining town
 But say what wounds are these What new disgrace
 Deforms the manly features of thy face

 To this the specter no reply did frame
 But answerd to the cause for which he came
 And groaning from the bottom of his breast
 This warning in these mournful words expressd
 O goddessborn escape by timely flight
 The flames and horrors of this fatal night
 The foes already have possessd the wall
 Troy nods from high and totters to her fall
 Enough is paid to Priams royal name
 More than enough to duty and to fame
 If by a mortal hand my fathers throne
 Could be defended t was by mine alone
 Now Troy to thee commends her future state
 And gives her gods companions of thy fate
 From their assistance walls expect
 Which wandring long at last thou shalt erect
 He said and brought me from their blest abodes
 The venerable statues of the gods
 With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir
 The wreaths and relics of th immortal fire

 Now peals of shouts come thundring from afar
 Cries threats and loud laments and mingled war
 The noise approaches tho our palace stood
 Aloof from streets encompassd with a wood
 Louder and yet more loud I hear th alarms
 Of human cries distinct and clashing arms
 Fear broke my slumbers I no longer stay
 But mount the terrace thence the town survey
 And hearken what the frightful sounds convey
 Thus when a flood of fire by wind is borne
 Crackling it rolls and mows the standing corn
 Or deluges descending on the plains
 Sweep oer the yellow year destroy the pains
 Of labring oxen and the peasants gains
 Unroot the forest oaks and bear away
 Flocks folds and trees and undistinguishd prey
 The shepherd climbs the cliff and sees from far
 The wasteful ravage of the watry war
 Then Hectors faith was manifestly cleard
 And Grecian frauds in open light appeard
 The palace of Deiphobus ascends
 In smoky flames and catches on his friends
 Ucalegon burns next the seas are bright
 With splendor not their own and shine with Trojan light
 New clamors and new clangors now arise
 The sound of trumpets mixd with fighting cries
 With frenzy seizd I run to meet th alarms
 Resolvd on death resolvd to die in arms
 But first to gather friends with them t oppose
 If fortune favord and repel the foes
 Spurrd by my courage by my country fird
 With sense of honor and revenge inspird

 Pantheus Apollos priest a sacred name
 Had scapd the Grecian swords and passd the flame
 With relics loaden to my doors he fled
 And by the hand his tender grandson led
 What hope O Pantheus whither can we run
 Where make a stand and what may yet be done
 Scarce had I said when Pantheus with a groan
 Troy is no more and Ilium was a town
 The fatal day th appointed hour is come
 When wrathful Joves irrevocable doom
 Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands
 The fire consumes the town the foe commands
 And armed hosts an unexpected force
 Break from the bowels of the fatal horse
 Within the gates proud Sinon throws about
 The flames and foes for entrance press without
 With thousand others whom I fear to name
 More than from Argos or Mycenae came
 To sevral posts their parties they divide
 Some block the narrow streets some scour the wide
 The bold they kill th unwary they surprise
 Who fights finds death and death finds him who flies
 The warders of the gate but scarce maintain
 Th unequal combat and resist in vain

 I heard and Heavn that wellborn souls inspires
 Prompts me thro lifted swords and rising fires
 To run where clashing arms and clamor calls
 And rush undaunted to defend the walls
 Ripheus and Iphitus by my side engage
 For valor one renownd and one for age
 Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew
 My motions and my mien and to my party drew
 With young Coroebus who by love was led
 To win renown and fair Cassandras bed
 And lately brought his troops to Priams aid
 Forewarnd in vain by the prophetic maid
 Whom when I saw resolvd in arms to fall
 And that one spirit animated all
 Brave souls said I but brave alas in vain
 Come finish what our cruel fates ordain
 You see the desprate state of our affairs
 And heavns protecting powrs are deaf to prayrs
 The passive gods behold the Greeks defile
 Their temples and abandon to the spoil
 Their own abodes we feeble few conspire
 To save a sinking town involvd in fire
 Then let us fall but fall amidst our foes
 Despair of life the means of living shows
 So bold a speech incouragd their desire
 Of death and added fuel to their fire

 As hungry wolves with raging appetite
 Scour thro the fields nor fear the stormy night
 Their whelps at home expect the promisd food
 And long to temper their dry chaps in blood
 So rushd we forth at once resolvd to die
 Resolvd in death the last extremes to try
 We leave the narrow lanes behind and dare
 Th unequal combat in the public square
 Night was our friend our leader was despair
 What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night
 What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright
 An ancient and imperial city falls
 The streets are filld with frequent funerals
 Houses and holy temples float in blood
 And hostile nations make a common flood
 Not only Trojans fall but in their turn
 The vanquishd triumph and the victors mourn
 Ours take new courage from despair and night
 Confusd the fortune is confusd the fight
 All parts resound with tumults plaints and fears
 And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears
 Androgeos fell among us with his band
 Who thought us Grecians newly come to land
 From whence said he my friends this long delay
 You loiter while the spoils are borne away
 Our ships are laden with the Trojan store
 And you like truants come too late ashore
 He said but soon corrected his mistake
 Found by the doubtful answers which we make
 Amazd he would have shunnd th unequal fight
 But we more numrous intercept his flight
 As when some peasant in a bushy brake
 Has with unwary footing pressd a snake
 He starts aside astonishd when he spies
 His rising crest blue neck and rolling eyes
 So from our arms surprisd Androgeos flies
 In vain for him and his we compassd round
 Possessd with fear unknowing of the ground
 And of their lives an easy conquest found
 Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smild
 Coroebus then with youthful hopes beguild
 Swoln with success and a daring mind
 This new invention fatally designd
 My friends said he since Fortune shows the way
 T is fit we should th auspicious guide obey
 For what has she these Grecian arms bestowd
 But their destruction and the Trojans good
 Then change we shields and their devices bear
 Let fraud supply the want of force in war
 They find us arms This said himself he dressd
 In dead Androgeos spoils his upper vest
 His painted buckler and his plumy crest
 Thus Ripheus Dymas all the Trojan train
 Lay down their own attire and strip the slain
 Mixd with the Greeks we go with ill presage
 Flatterd with hopes to glut our greedy rage
 Unknown assaulting whom we blindly meet
 And strew with Grecian carcasses the street
 Thus while their straggling parties we defeat
 Some to the shore and safer ships retreat
 And some oppressd with more ignoble fear
 Remount the hollow horse and pant in secret there

 But ah what use of valor can be made
 When heavns propitious powrs refuse their aid
 Behold the royal prophetess the fair
 Cassandra draggd by her disheveld hair
 Whom not Minervas shrine nor sacred bands
 In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands
 On heavn she cast her eyes she sighd she cried
 T was all she could her tender arms were tied
 So sad a sight Coroebus could not bear
 But fird with rage distracted with despair
 Amid the barbrous ravishers he flew
 Our leaders rash example we pursue
 But storms of stones from the proud temples height
 Pour down and on our batterd helms alight
 We from our friends receivd this fatal blow
 Who thought us Grecians as we seemd in show
 They aim at the mistaken crests from high
 And ours beneath the pondrous ruin lie
 Then movd with anger and disdain to see
 Their troops dispersd the royal virgin free
 The Grecians rally and their powrs unite
 With fury charge us and renew the fight
 The brother kings with Ajax join their force
 And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse

 Thus when the rival winds their quarrel try
 Contending for the kingdom of the sky
 South east and west on airy coursers borne
 The whirlwind gathers and the woods are torn
 Then Nereus strikes the deep the billows rise
 And mixd with ooze and sand pollute the skies
 The troops we squanderd first again appear
 From several quarters and enclose the rear
 They first observe and to the rest betray
 Our diffrent speech our borrowd arms survey
 Oppressd with odds we fall Coroebus first
 At Pallas altar by Peneleus piercd
 Then Ripheus followd in th unequal fight
 Just of his word observant of the right
 Heavn thought not so Dymas their fate attends
 With Hypanis mistaken by their friends
 Nor Pantheus thee thy miter nor the bands
 Of awful Phoebus savd from impious hands
 Ye Trojan flames your testimony bear
 What I performd and what I sufferd there
 No sword avoiding in the fatal strife
 Exposd to death and prodigal of life
 Witness ye heavens I live not by my fault
 I strove to have deservd the death I sought
 But when I could not fight and would have died
 Borne off to distance by the growing tide
 Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence
 With Pelias wounded and without defense
 New clamors from th invested palace ring
 We run to die or disengage the king
 So hot th assault so high the tumult rose
 While ours defend and while the Greeks oppose
 As all the Dardan and Argolic race
 Had been contracted in that narrow space
 Or as all Ilium else were void of fear
 And tumult war and slaughter only there
 Their targets in a tortoise cast the foes
 Secure advancing to the turrets rose
 Some mount the scaling ladders some more bold
 Swerve upwards and by posts and pillars hold
 Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th ascent
 While with their right they seize the battlement
 From their demolishd towrs the Trojans throw
 Huge heaps of stones that falling crush the foe
 And heavy beams and rafters from the sides
 Such arms their last necessity provides
 And gilded roofs come tumbling from on high
 The marks of state and ancient royalty
 The guards below fixd in the pass attend
 The charge undaunted and the gate defend
 Renewd in courage with recoverd breath
 A second time we ran to tempt our death
 To clear the palace from the foe succeed
 The weary living and revenge the dead

 A postern door yet unobservd and free
 Joind by the length of a blind gallery
 To the kings closet led a way well known
 To Hectors wife while Priam held the throne
 Thro which she brought Astyanax unseen
 To cheer his grandsire and his grandsires queen
 Thro this we pass and mount the towr from whence
 With unavailing arms the Trojans make defense
 From this the trembling king had oft descried
 The Grecian camp and saw their navy ride
 Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew
 Then wrenching with our hands th assault renew
 And where the rafters on the columns meet
 We push them headlong with our arms and feet
 The lightning flies not swifter than the fall
 Nor thunder louder than the ruind wall
 Down goes the top at once the Greeks beneath
 Are piecemeal torn or pounded into death
 Yet more succeed and more to death are sent
 We cease not from above nor they below relent
 Before the gate stood Pyrrhus threatning loud
 With glittring arms conspicuous in the crowd
 So shines renewd in youth the crested snake
 Who slept the winter in a thorny brake
 And casting off his slough when spring returns
 Now looks aloft and with new glory burns
 Restord with poisonous herbs his ardent sides
 Reflect the sun and raisd on spires he rides
 High oer the grass hissing he rolls along
 And brandishes by fits his forky tongue
 Proud Periphas and fierce Automedon
 His fathers charioteer together run
 To force the gate the Scyrian infantry
 Rush on in crowds and the barrd passage free
 Entring the court with shouts the skies they rend
 And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend
 Himself among the foremost deals his blows
 And with his ax repeated strokes bestows
 On the strong doors then all their shoulders ply
 Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly
 He hews apace the double bars at length
 Yield to his ax and unresisted strength
 A mighty breach is made the rooms conceald
 Appear and all the palace is reveald
 The halls of audience and of public state
 And where the lonely queen in secret sate
 Armd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen
 With not a door and scarce a space between
 The house is filld with loud laments and cries
 And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies
 The fearful matrons run from place to place
 And kiss the thresholds and the posts embrace
 The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies
 And all his father sparkles in his eyes
 Nor bars nor fighting guards his force sustain
 The bars are broken and the guards are slain
 In rush the Greeks and all the apartments fill
 Those few defendants whom they find they kill
 Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood
 Roars when he finds his rapid course withstood
 Bears down the dams with unresisted sway
 And sweeps the cattle and the cots away
 These eyes beheld him when he marchd between
 The brother kings I saw th unhappy queen
 The hundred wives and where old Priam stood
 To stain his hallowd altar with his brood
 The fifty nuptial beds such hopes had he
 So large a promise of a progeny
 The posts of plated gold and hung with spoils
 Fell the reward of the proud victors toils
 Whereer the raging fire had left a space
 The Grecians enter and possess the place

 Perhaps you may of Priams fate enquire
 He when he saw his regal town on fire
 His ruind palace and his entring foes
 On evry side inevitable woes
 In arms disusd invests his limbs decayd
 Like them with age a late and useless aid
 His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain
 Loaded not armd he creeps along with pain
 Despairing of success ambitious to be slain
 Uncoverd but by heavn there stood in view
 An altar near the hearth a laurel grew
 Dodderd with age whose boughs encompass round
 The household gods and shade the holy ground
 Here Hecuba with all her helpless train
 Of dames for shelter sought but sought in vain
 Drivn like a flock of doves along the sky
 Their images they hug and to their altars fly
 The Queen when she beheld her trembling lord
 And hanging by his side a heavy sword
 What rage she cried has seizd my husbands mind
 What arms are these and to what use designd
 These times want other aids Were Hector here
 Evn Hector now in vain like Priam would appear
 With us one common shelter thou shalt find
 Or in one common fate with us be joind
 She said and with a last salute embracd
 The poor old man and by the laurel placd
 Behold Polites one of Priams sons
 Pursued by Pyrrhus there for safety runs
 Thro swords and foes amazd and hurt he flies
 Thro empty courts and open galleries
 Him Pyrrhus urging with his lance pursues
 And often reaches and his thrusts renews
 The youth transfixd with lamentable cries
 Expires before his wretched parents eyes
 Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw
 The fear of death gave place to natures law
 And shaking more with anger than with age
 The gods said he requite thy brutal rage
 As sure they will barbarian sure they must
 If there be gods in heavn and gods be just
 Who takst in wrongs an insolent delight
 With a sons death t infect a fathers sight
 Not he whom thou and lying fame conspire
 To call thee his not he thy vaunted sire
 Thus usd my wretched age the gods he feard
 The laws of nature and of nations heard
 He cheerd my sorrows and for sums of gold
 The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold
 Pitied the woes a parent underwent
 And sent me back in safety from his tent

 This said his feeble hand a javelin threw
 Which fluttring seemd to loiter as it flew
 Just and but barely to the mark it held
 And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield

 Then Pyrrhus thus Go thou from me to fate
 And to my father my foul deeds relate
 Now die With that he draggd the trembling sire
 Sliddring thro clotterd blood and holy mire
 The mingled paste his murderd son had made
 Hauld from beneath the violated shade
 And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid
 His right hand held his bloody falchion bare
 His left he twisted in his hoary hair
 Then with a speeding thrust his heart he found
 The lukewarm blood came rushing thro the wound
 And sanguine streams distaind the sacred ground
 Thus Priam fell and shard one common fate
 With Troy in ashes and his ruind state
 He who the scepter of all Asia swayd
 Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obeyd
 On the bleak shore now lies th abandond king
 A headless carcass and a nameless thing

 Then not before I felt my cruddled blood
 Congeal with fear my hair with horror stood
 My fathers image filld my pious mind
 Lest equal years might equal fortune find
 Again I thought on my forsaken wife
 And trembled for my sons abandond life
 I lookd about but found myself alone
 Deserted at my need My friends were gone
 Some spent with toil some with despair oppressd
 Leapd headlong from the heights the flames consumd the rest
 Thus wandring in my way without a guide
 The graceless Helen in the porch I spied
 Of Vestas temple there she lurkd alone
 Muffled she sate and what she could unknown
 But by the flames that cast their blaze around
 That common bane of Greece and Troy I found
 For Ilium burnt she dreads the Trojan sword
 More dreads the vengeance of her injurd lord
 Evn by those gods who refugd her abhorrd
 Trembling with rage the strumpet I regard
 Resolvd to give her guilt the due reward
 Shall she triumphant sail before the wind
 And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind
 Shall she her kingdom and her friends review
 In state attended with a captive crew
 While unrevengd the good old Priam falls
 And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls
 For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood
 Were swelld with bodies and were drunk with blood
 T is true a soldier can small honor gain
 And boast no conquest from a woman slain
 Yet shall the fact not pass without applause
 Of vengeance taken in so just a cause
 The punishd crime shall set my soul at ease
 And murmring manes of my friends appease
 Thus while I rave a gleam of pleasing light
 Spread oer the place and shining heavnly bright
 My mother stood reveald before my sight
 Never so radiant did her eyes appear
 Not her own star confessd a light so clear
 Great in her charms as when on gods above
 She looks and breathes herself into their love
 She held my hand the destind blow to break
 Then from her rosy lips began to speak
 My son from whence this madness this neglect
 Of my commands and those whom I protect
 Why this unmanly rage Recall to mind
 Whom you forsake what pledges leave behind
 Look if your helpless father yet survive
 Or if Ascanius or Creusa live
 Around your house the greedy Grecians err
 And these had perishd in the nightly war
 But for my presence and protecting care
 Not Helens face nor Paris was in fault
 But by the gods was this destruction brought
 Now cast your eyes around while I dissolve
 The mists and films that mortal eyes involve
 Purge from your sight the dross and make you see
 The shape of each avenging deity
 Enlightend thus my just commands fulfil
 Nor fear obedience to your mothers will
 Where yon disorderd heap of ruin lies
 Stones rent from stones where clouds of dust arise
 Amid that smother Neptune holds his place
 Below the walls foundation drives his mace
 And heaves the building from the solid base
 Look where in arms imperial Juno stands
 Full in the Scaean gate with loud commands
 Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands
 See Pallas of her snaky buckler proud
 Bestrides the towr refulgent thro the cloud
 See Jove new courage to the foe supplies
 And arms against the town the partial deities
 Haste hence my son this fruitless labor end
 Haste where your trembling spouse and sire attend
 Haste and a mothers care your passage shall befriend
 She said and swiftly vanishd from my sight
 Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night
 I lookd I listend dreadful sounds I hear
 And the dire forms of hostile gods appear
 Troy sunk in flames I saw nor could prevent
 And Ilium from its old foundations rent
 Rent like a mountain ash which dard the winds
 And stood the sturdy strokes of labring hinds
 About the roots the cruel ax resounds
 The stumps are piercd with oftrepeated wounds
 The war is felt on high the nodding crown
 Now threats a fall and throws the leafy honors down
 To their united force it yields tho late
 And mourns with mortal groans th approaching fate
 The roots no more their upper load sustain
 But down she falls and spreads a ruin thro the plain

 Descending thence I scape thro foes and fire
 Before the goddess foes and flames retire
 Arrivd at home he for whose only sake
 Or most for his such toils I undertake
 The good Anchises whom by timely flight
 I purposd to secure on Idas height
 Refusd the journey resolute to die
 And add his funrals to the fate of Troy
 Rather than exile and old age sustain
 Go you whose blood runs warm in evry vein
 Had Heavn decreed that I should life enjoy
 Heavn had decreed to save unhappy Troy
 T is sure enough if not too much for one
 Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown
 Make haste to save the poor remaining crew
 And give this useless corpse a long adieu
 These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath
 At least the pitying foes will aid my death
 To take my spoils and leave my body bare
 As for my sepulcher let Heavn take care
 T is long since I for my celestial wife
 Loathd by the gods have draggd a lingring life
 Since evry hour and moment I expire
 Blasted from heavn by Joves avenging fire
 This oft repeated he stood fixd to die
 Myself my wife my son my family
 Intreat pray beg and raise a doleful cry
 What will he still persist on death resolve
 And in his ruin all his house involve
 He still persists his reasons to maintain
 Our prayrs our tears our loud laments are vain

 Urgd by despair again I go to try
 The fate of arms resolvd in fight to die
 What hope remains but what my death must give
 Can I without so dear a father live
 You term it prudence what I baseness call
 Could such a word from such a parent fall
 If Fortune please and so the gods ordain
 That nothing should of ruind Troy remain
 And you conspire with Fortune to be slain
 The way to death is wide th approaches near
 For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear
 Reeking with Priams blood the wretch who slew
 The son inhuman in the fathers view
 And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew
 O goddess mother give me back to Fate
 Your gift was undesird and came too late
 Did you for this unhappy me convey
 Thro foes and fires to see my house a prey
 Shall I my father wife and son behold
 Weltring in blood each others arms infold
 Haste gird my sword tho spent and overcome
 T is the last summons to receive our doom
 I hear thee Fate and I obey thy call
 Not unrevengd the foe shall see my fall
 Restore me to the yet unfinishd fight
 My death is wanting to conclude the night
 Armd once again my glittring sword I wield
 While th other hand sustains my weighty shield
 And forth I rush to seek th abandond field
 I went but sad Creusa stoppd my way
 And cross the threshold in my passage lay
 Embracd my knees and when I would have gone
 Shewd me my feeble sire and tender son
 If death be your design at least said she
 Take us along to share your destiny
 If any farther hopes in arms remain
 This place these pledges of your love maintain
 To whom do you expose your fathers life
 Your sons and mine your now forgotten wife
 While thus she fills the house with clamrous cries
 Our hearing is diverted by our eyes
 For while I held my son in the short space
 Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace
 Strange to relate from young Iulus head
 A lambent flame arose which gently spread
 Around his brows and on his temples fed
 Amazd with running water we prepare
 To quench the sacred fire and slake his hair
 But old Anchises versd in omens reard
 His hands to heavn and this request preferrd
 If any vows almighty Jove can bend
 Thy will if piety can prayrs commend
 Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleasd to send
 Scarce had he said when on our left we hear
 A peal of rattling thunder roll in air
 There shot a streaming lamp along the sky
 Which on the winged lightning seemd to fly
 From oer the roof the blaze began to move
 And trailing vanishd in th Idaean grove
 It swept a path in heavn and shone a guide
 Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died

 The good old man with suppliant hands implord
 The gods protection and their star adord
 Now now said he my son no more delay
 I yield I follow where Heavn shews the way
 Keep O my country gods our dwelling place
 And guard this relic of the Trojan race
 This tender child These omens are your own
 And you can yet restore the ruind town
 At least accomplish what your signs foreshow
 I stand resignd and am prepard to go

 He said The crackling flames appear on high
 And driving sparkles dance along the sky
 With Vulcans rage the rising winds conspire
 And near our palace roll the flood of fire
 Haste my dear father t is no time to wait
 And load my shoulders with a willing freight
 Whateer befalls your life shall be my care
 One death or one delivrance we will share
 My hand shall lead our little son and you
 My faithful consort shall our steps pursue
 Next you my servants heed my strict commands
 Without the walls a ruind temple stands
 To Ceres hallowd once a cypress nigh
 Shoots up her venerable head on high
 By long religion kept there bend your feet
 And in divided parties let us meet
 Our country gods the relics and the bands
 Hold you my father in your guiltless hands
 In me t is impious holy things to bear
 Red as I am with slaughter new from war
 Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt
 Of dire debate and blood in battle spilt
 Thus ordring all that prudence could provide
 I clothe my shoulders with a lions hide
 And yellow spoils then on my bending back
 The welcome load of my dear father take
 While on my better hand Ascanius hung
 And with unequal paces trippd along
 Creusa kept behind by choice we stray
 Thro evry dark and evry devious way
 I who so bold and dauntless just before
 The Grecian darts and shock of lances bore
 At evry shadow now am seizd with fear
 Not for myself but for the charge I bear
 Till near the ruind gate arrivd at last
 Secure and deeming all the danger past
 A frightful noise of trampling feet we hear
 My father looking thro the shades with fear
 Cried out Haste haste my son the foes are nigh
 Their swords and shining armor I descry
 Some hostile god for some unknown offense
 Had sure bereft my mind of better sense
 For while thro winding ways I took my flight
 And sought the shelter of the gloomy night
 Alas I lost Creusa hard to tell
 If by her fatal destiny she fell
 Or weary sate or wanderd with affright
 But she was lost for ever to my sight
 I knew not or reflected till I meet
 My friends at Ceres now deserted seat
 We met not one was wanting only she
 Deceivd her friends her son and wretched me

 What mad expressions did my tongue refuse
 Whom did I not of gods or men accuse
 This was the fatal blow that paind me more
 Than all I felt from ruind Troy before
 Stung with my loss and raving with despair
 Abandoning my now forgotten care
 Of counsel comfort and of hope bereft
 My sire my son my country gods I left
 In shining armor once again I sheathe
 My limbs not feeling wounds nor fearing death
 Then headlong to the burning walls I run
 And seek the danger I was forcd to shun
 I tread my former tracks thro night explore
 Each passage evry street I crossd before
 All things were full of horror and affright
 And dreadful evn the silence of the night
 Then to my fathers house I make repair
 With some small glimpse of hope to find her there
 Instead of her the cruel Greeks I met
 The house was filld with foes with flames beset
 Drivn on the wings of winds whole sheets of fire
 Thro air transported to the roofs aspire
 From thence to Priams palace I resort
 And search the citadel and desart court
 Then unobservd I pass by Junos church
 A guard of Grecians had possessd the porch
 There Phoenix and Ulysses watch prey
 And thither all the wealth of Troy convey
 The spoils which they from ransackd houses brought
 And golden bowls from burning altars caught
 The tables of the gods the purple vests
 The peoples treasure and the pomp of priests
 A rank of wretched youths with piniond hands
 And captive matrons in long order stands
 Then with ungovernd madness I proclaim
 Thro all the silent street Creusas name
 Creusa still I call at length she hears
 And sudden thro the shades of night appears
 Appears no more Creusa nor my wife
 But a pale specter larger than the life
 Aghast astonishd and struck dumb with fear
 I stood like bristles rose my stiffend hair
 Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief
 Nor tears nor cries can give the dead relief
 Desist my muchlovd lordt indulge your pain
 You bear no more than what the gods ordain
 My fates permit me not from hence to fly
 Nor he the great controller of the sky
 Long wandring ways for you the powrs decree
 On land hard labors and a length of sea
 Then after many painful years are past
 On Latiums happy shore you shall be cast
 Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds
 The flowry meadows and the feeding folds
 There end your toils and there your fates provide
 A quiet kingdom and a royal bride
 There fortune shall the Trojan line restore
 And you for lost Creusa weep no more
 Fear not that I shall watch with servile shame
 Th imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame
 Or stooping to the victors lust disgrace
 My goddess mother or my royal race
 And now farewell The parent of the gods
 Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes
 I trust our common issue to your care
 She said and gliding passd unseen in air
 I strove to speak but horror tied my tongue
 And thrice about her neck my arms I flung
 And thrice deceivd on vain embraces hung
 Light as an empty dream at break of day
 Or as a blast of wind she rushd away

 Thus having passd the night in fruitless pain
 I to my longing friends return again
 Amazd th augmented number to behold
 Of men and matrons mixd of young and old
 A wretched exild crew together brought
 With arms appointed and with treasure fraught
 Resolvd and willing under my command
 To run all hazards both of sea and land
 The Morn began from Ida to display
 Her rosy cheeks and Phosphor led the day
 Before the gates the Grecians took their post
 And all pretense of late relief was lost
 I yield to Fate unwillingly retire
 And loaded up the hill convey my sire




 BOOK III

 When Heavn had overturnd the Trojan state
 And Priams throne by too severe a fate
 When ruind Troy became the Grecians prey
 And Iliums lofty towrs in ashes lay
 Warnd by celestial omens we retreat
 To seek in foreign lands a happier seat
 Near old Antandros and at Idas foot
 The timber of the sacred groves we cut
 And build our fleet uncertain yet to find
 What place the gods for our repose assignd
 Friends daily flock and scarce the kindly spring
 Began to clothe the ground and birds to sing
 When old Anchises summond all to sea
 The crew my father and the Fates obey
 With sighs and tears I leave my native shore
 And empty fields where Ilium stood before
 My sire my son our less and greater gods
 All sail at once and cleave the briny floods

 Against our coast appears a spacious land
 Which once the fierce Lycurgus did command
 Thracia the name the people bold in war
 Vast are their fields and tillage is their care
 A hospitable realm while Fate was kind
 With Troy in friendship and religion joind
 I land with luckless omens then adore
 Their gods and draw a line along the shore
 I lay the deep foundations of a wall
 And Aenos namd from me the city call
 To Dionaean Venus vows are paid
 And all the powrs that rising labors aid
 A bull on Joves imperial altar laid
 Not far a rising hillock stood in view
 Sharp myrtles on the sides and cornels grew
 There while I went to crop the sylvan scenes
 And shade our altar with their leafy greens
 I pulld a plant with horror I relate
 A prodigy so strange and full of fate
 The rooted fibers rose and from the wound
 Black bloody drops distilld upon the ground
 Mute and amazd my hair with terror stood
 Fear shrunk my sinews and congeald my blood
 Mannd once again another plant I try
 That other gushd with the same sanguine dye
 Then fearing guilt for some offense unknown
 With prayrs and vows the Dryads I atone
 With all the sisters of the woods and most
 The God of Arms who rules the Thracian coast
 That they or he these omens would avert
 Release our fears and better signs impart
 Cleard as I thought and fully fixd at length
 To learn the cause I tugged with all my strength
 I bent my knees against the ground once more
 The violated myrtle ran with gore
 Scarce dare I tell the sequel from the womb
 Of wounded earth and caverns of the tomb
 A groan as of a troubled ghost renewd
 My fright and then these dreadful words ensued
 Why dost thou thus my buried body rend
 O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend
 Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood
 The tears distil not from the wounded wood
 But evry drop this living tree contains
 Is kindred blood and ran in Trojan veins
 O fly from this unhospitable shore
 Warnd by my fate for I am Polydore
 Here loads of lances in my blood embrued
 Again shoot upward by my blood renewd

 My faltring tongue and shivring limbs declare
 My horror and in bristles rose my hair
 When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent
 Old Priam fearful of the wars event
 This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent
 Loaded with gold he sent his darling far
 From noise and tumults and destructive war
 Committed to the faithless tyrants care
 Who when he saw the powr of Troy decline
 Forsook the weaker with the strong to join
 Broke evry bond of nature and of truth
 And murderd for his wealth the royal youth
 O sacred hunger of pernicious gold
 What bands of faith can impious lucre hold
 Now when my soul had shaken off her fears
 I call my father and the Trojan peers
 Relate the prodigies of Heavn require
 What he commands and their advice desire
 All vote to leave that execrable shore
 Polluted with the blood of Polydore
 But ere we sail his funral rites prepare
 Then to his ghost a tomb and altars rear
 In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round
 With baleful cypress and blue fillets crownd
 With eyes dejected and with hair unbound
 Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour
 And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore

 Now when the raging storms no longer reign
 But southern gales invite us to the main
 We launch our vessels with a prosprous wind
 And leave the cities and the shores behind

 An island in th Aegaean main appears
 Neptune and watry Doris claim it theirs
 It floated once till Phoebus fixd the sides
 To rooted earth and now it braves the tides
 Here borne by friendly winds we come ashore
 With needful ease our weary limbs restore
 And the Suns temple and his town adore

 Anius the priest and king with laurel crownd
 His hoary locks with purple fillets bound
 Who saw my sire the Delian shore ascend
 Came forth with eager haste to meet his friend
 Invites him to his palace and in sign
 Of ancient love their plighted hands they join
 Then to the temple of the god I went
 And thus before the shrine my vows present
 Give O Thymbraeus give a resting place
 To the sad relics of the Trojan race
 A seat secure a region of their own
 A lasting empire and a happier town
 Where shall we fix where shall our labors end
 Whom shall we follow and what fate attend
 Let not my prayrs a doubtful answer find
 But in clear auguries unveil thy mind
 Scarce had I said he shook the holy ground
 The laurels and the lofty hills around
 And from the tripos rushd a bellowing sound
 Prostrate we fell confessd the present god
 Who gave this answer from his dark abode
 Undaunted youths go seek that mother earth
 From which your ancestors derive their birth
 The soil that sent you forth her ancient race
 In her old bosom shall again embrace
 Thro the wide world th Aeneian house shall reign
 And childrens children shall the crown sustain
 Thus Phoebus did our future fates disclose
 A mighty tumult mixd with joy arose

 All are concernd to know what place the god
 Assignd and where determind our abode
 My father long revolving in his mind
 The race and lineage of the Trojan kind
 Thus answerd their demands Ye princes hear
 Your pleasing fortune and dispel your fear
 The fruitful isle of Crete well known to fame
 Sacred of old to Joves imperial name
 In the mid ocean lies with large command
 And on its plains a hundred cities stand
 Another Ida rises there and we
 From thence derive our Trojan ancestry
 From thence as t is divulgd by certain fame
 To the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came
 There fixd and there the seat of empire chose
 Ere Ilium and the Trojan towrs arose
 In humble vales they built their soft abodes
 Till Cybele the mother of the gods
 With tinkling cymbals charmd th Idaean woods
 She secret rites and ceremonies taught
 And to the yoke the savage lions brought
 Let us the land which Heavn appoints explore
 Appease the winds and seek the Gnossian shore
 If Jove assists the passage of our fleet
 The third propitious dawn discovers Crete
 Thus having said the sacrifices laid
 On smoking altars to the gods he paid
 A bull to Neptune an oblation due
 Another bull to bright Apollo slew
 A milkwhite ewe the western winds to please
 And one coalblack to calm the stormy seas
 Ere this a flying rumor had been spread
 That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled
 Expelld and exild that the coast was free
 From foreign or domestic enemy

 We leave the Delian ports and put to sea
 By Naxos famd for vintage make our way
 Then green Donysa pass and sail in sight
 Of Paros isle with marble quarries white
 We pass the scatterd isles of Cyclades
 That scarce distinguishd seem to stud the seas
 The shouts of sailors double near the shores
 They stretch their canvas and they ply their oars
 All hands aloft for Crete for Crete they cry
 And swiftly thro the foamy billows fly
 Full on the promisd land at length we bore
 With joy descending on the Cretan shore
 With eager haste a rising town I frame
 Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name
 The name itself was grateful I exhort
 To found their houses and erect a fort
 Our ships are hauld upon the yellow strand
 The youth begin to till the labord land
 And I myself new marriages promote
 Give laws and dwellings I divide by lot
 When rising vapors choke the wholesome air
 And blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year
 The trees devouring caterpillars burn
 Parchd was the grass and blighted was the corn
 Nor scape the beasts for Sirius from on high
 With pestilential heat infects the sky
 My men some fall the rest in fevers fry
 Again my father bids me seek the shore
 Of sacred Delos and the god implore
 To learn what end of woes we might expect
 And to what clime our weary course direct

 T was night when evry creature void of cares
 The common gift of balmy slumber shares
 The statues of my gods for such they seemd
 Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeemd
 Before me stood majestically bright
 Full in the beams of Phoebes entring light
 Then thus they spoke and easd my troubled mind
 What from the Delian god thou gost to find
 He tells thee here and sends us to relate
 Those powrs are we companions of thy fate
 Who from the burning town by thee were brought
 Thy fortune followd and thy safety wrought
 Thro seas and lands as we thy steps attend
 So shall our care thy glorious race befriend
 An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain
 A town that oer the conquerd world shall reign
 Thou mighty walls for mighty nations build
 Nor let thy weary mind to labors yield
 But change thy seat for not the Delian god
 Nor we have givn thee Crete for our abode
 A land there is Hesperia calld of old
 The soil is fruitful and the natives bold
 Th Oenotrians held it once by later fame
 Now calld Italia from the leaders name
 lasius there and Dardanus were born
 From thence we came and thither must return
 Rise and thy sire with these glad tidings greet
 Search Italy for Jove denies thee Crete

 Astonishd at their voices and their sight
 Nor were they dreams but visions of the night
 I saw I knew their faces and descried
 In perfect view their hair with fillets tied
 I started from my couch a clammy sweat
 On all my limbs and shivring body sate
 To heavn I lift my hands with pious haste
 And sacred incense in the flames I cast
 Thus to the gods their perfect honors done
 More cheerful to my good old sire I run
 And tell the pleasing news In little space
 He found his error of the double race
 Not as before he deemd derivd from Crete
 No more deluded by the doubtful seat
 Then said O son turmoild in Trojan fate
 Such things as these Cassandra did relate
 This day revives within my mind what she
 Foretold of Troy renewd in Italy
 And Latian lands but who could then have thought
 That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought
 Or who believd what mad Cassandra taught
 Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way

 He said and we with glad consent obey
 Forsake the seat and leaving few behind
 We spread our sails before the willing wind
 Now from the sight of land our galleys move
 With only seas around and skies above
 When oer our heads descends a burst of rain
 And night with sable clouds involves the main
 The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise
 The scatterd fleet is forcd to sevral ways
 The face of heavn is ravishd from our eyes
 And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies
 Cast from our course we wander in the dark
 No stars to guide no point of land to mark
 Evn Palinurus no distinction found
 Betwixt the night and day such darkness reignd around
 Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays
 Without distinction and three sunless days
 The fourth renews the light and from our shrouds
 We view a rising land like distant clouds
 The mountaintops confirm the pleasing sight
 And curling smoke ascending from their height
 The canvas falls their oars the sailors ply
 From the rude strokes the whirling waters fly
 At length I land upon the Strophades
 Safe from the danger of the stormy seas
 Those isles are compassd by th Ionian main
 The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign
 Forcd by the winged warriors to repair
 To their old homes and leave their costly fare
 Monsters more fierce offended Heavn neer sent
 From hells abyss for human punishment
 With virgin faces but with wombs obscene
 Foul paunches and with ordure still unclean
 With claws for hands and looks for ever lean

 We landed at the port and soon beheld
 Fat herds of oxen graze the flowry field
 And wanton goats without a keeper strayd
 With weapons we the welcome prey invade
 Then call the gods for partners of our feast
 And Jove himself the chief invited guest
 We spread the tables on the greensward ground
 We feed with hunger and the bowls go round
 When from the mountaintops with hideous cry
 And clattring wings the hungry Harpies fly
 They snatch the meat defiling all they find
 And parting leave a loathsome stench behind
 Close by a hollow rock again we sit
 New dress the dinner and the beds refit
 Secure from sight beneath a pleasing shade
 Where tufted trees a native arbor made
 Again the holy fires on altars burn
 And once again the ravnous birds return
 Or from the dark recesses where they lie
 Or from another quarter of the sky
 With filthy claws their odious meal repeat
 And mix their loathsome ordures with their meat
 I bid my friends for vengeance then prepare
 And with the hellish nation wage the war
 They as commanded for the fight provide
 And in the grass their glittring weapons hide
 Then when along the crooked shore we hear
 Their clattring wings and saw the foes appear
 Misenus sounds a charge we take th alarm
 And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm
 In this new kind of combat all employ
 Their utmost force the monsters to destroy
 In vain the fated skin is proof to wounds
 And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds
 At length rebuffd they leave their mangled prey
 And their stretchd pinions to the skies display
 Yet one remaind the messenger of Fate
 High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate
 And thus her dismal errand did relate
 What not contented with our oxen slain
 Dare you with Heavn an impious war maintain
 And drive the Harpies from their native reign
 Heed therefore what I say and keep in mind
 What Jove decrees what Phoebus has designd
 And I the Furies queen from both relate
 You seek th Italian shores foredoomd by fate
 Th Italian shores are granted you to find
 And a safe passage to the port assignd
 But know that ere your promisd walls you build
 My curses shall severely be fulfilld
 Fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed
 Reducd to grind the plates on which you feed
 She said and to the neighbring forest flew
 Our courage fails us and our fears renew
 Hopeless to win by war to prayrs we fall
 And on th offended Harpies humbly call
 And whether gods or birds obscene they were
 Our vows for pardon and for peace prefer
 But old Anchises offring sacrifice
 And lifting up to heavn his hands and eyes
 Adord the greater gods Avert said he
 These omens render vain this prophecy
 And from th impending curse a pious people free

 Thus having said he bids us put to sea
 We loose from shore our haulsers and obey
 And soon with swelling sails pursue the watry way
 Amidst our course Zacynthian woods appear
 And next by rocky Neritos we steer
 We fly from Ithacas detested shore
 And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore
 At length Leucates cloudy top appears
 And the Suns temple which the sailor fears
 Resolvd to breathe a while from labor past
 Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast
 And joyful to the little city haste
 Here safe beyond our hopes our vows we pay
 To Jove the guide and patron of our way
 The customs of our country we pursue
 And Trojan games on Actian shores renew
 Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil
 And exercise the wrastlers noble toil
 Pleasd to have saild so long before the wind
 And left so many Grecian towns behind
 The sun had now fulfilld his annual course
 And Boreas on the seas displayd his force
 I fixd upon the temples lofty door
 The brazen shield which vanquishd Abas bore
 The verse beneath my name and action speaks
 These arms Aeneas took from conquring Greeks
 Then I command to weigh the seamen ply
 Their sweeping oars the smoking billows fly
 The sight of high Phaeacia soon we lost
 And skimmd along Epirus rocky coast

 Then to Chaonias port our course we bend
 And landed to Buthrotus heights ascend
 Here wondrous things were loudly blazd fame
 How Helenus revivd the Trojan name
 And reignd in Greece that Priams captive son
 Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne
 And fair Andromache restord by fate
 Once more was happy in a Trojan mate
 I leave my galleys riding in the port
 And long to see the new Dardanian court
 By chance the mournful queen before the gate
 Then solemnizd her former husbands fate
 Green altars raisd of turf with gifts she crownd
 And sacred priests in order stand around
 And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound
 The grove itself resembles Idas wood
 And Simois seemd the welldissembled flood
 But when at nearer distance she beheld
 My shining armor and my Trojan shield
 Astonishd at the sight the vital heat
 Forsakes her limbs her veins no longer beat
 She faints she falls and scarce recovring strength
 Thus with a faltring tongue she speaks at length

 Are you alive O goddessborn she said
 Or if a ghost then where is Hectors shade
 At this she cast a loud and frightful cry
 With broken words I made this brief reply
 All of me that remains appears in sight
 I live if living be to loathe the light
 No phantom but I drag a wretched life
 My fate resembling that of Hectors wife
 What have you sufferd since you lost your lord
 By what strange blessing are you now restord
 Still are you Hectors or is Hector fled
 And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus bed
 With eyes dejected in a lowly tone
 After a modest pause she thus begun

 O only happy maid of Priams race
 Whom death deliverd from the foes embrace
 Commanded on Achilles tomb to die
 Not forcd like us to hard captivity
 Or in a haughty masters arms to lie
 In Grecian ships unhappy we were borne
 Endurd the victors lust sustaind the scorn
 Thus I submitted to the lawless pride
 Of Pyrrhus more a handmaid than a bride
 Cloyd with possession he forsook my bed
 And Helens lovely daughter sought to wed
 Then me to Trojan Helenus resignd
 And his two slaves in equal marriage joind
 Till young Orestes piercd with deep despair
 And longing to redeem the promisd fair
 Before Apollos altar slew the ravisher
 By Pyrrhus death the kingdom we regaind
 At least one half with Helenus remaind
 Our part from Chaon he Chaonia calls
 And names from Pergamus his rising walls
 But you what fates have landed on our coast
 What gods have sent you or what storms have tossd
 Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy
 Savd from the ruins of unhappy Troy
 O tell me how his mothers loss he bears
 What hopes are promisd from his blooming years
 How much of Hector in his face appears
 She spoke and mixd her speech with mournful cries
 And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes

 At length her lord descends upon the plain
 In pomp attended with a numrous train
 Receives his friends and to the city leads
 And tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds
 Proceeding on another Troy I see
 Or in less compass Troys epitome
 A rivlet by the name of Xanthus ran
 And I embrace the Scaean gate again
 My friends in porticoes were entertaind
 And feasts and pleasures thro the city reignd
 The tables filld the spacious hall around
 And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crownd
 Two days we passd in mirth till friendly gales
 Blown from the south supplied our swelling sails
 Then to the royal seer I thus began
 O thou who knowst beyond the reach of man
 The laws of heavn and what the stars decree
 Whom Phoebus taught unerring prophecy
 From his own tripod and his holy tree
 Skilld in the wingd inhabitants of air
 What auspices their notes and flights declare
 O say for all religious rites portend
 A happy voyage and a prosprous end
 And evry power and omen of the sky
 Direct my course for destind Italy
 But only dire Celaeno from the gods
 A dismal famine fatally forebodes
 O say what dangers I am first to shun
 What toils vanquish and what course to run

 The prophet first with sacrifice adores
 The greater gods their pardon then implores
 Unbinds the fillet from his holy head
 To Phoebus next my trembling steps he led
 Full of religious doubts and awful dread
 Then with his god possessd before the shrine
 These words proceeded from his mouth divine
 O goddessborn for Heavns appointed will
 With greater auspices of good than ill
 Foreshows thy voyage and thy course directs
 Thy fates conspire and Jove himself protects
 Of many things some few I shall explain
 Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main
 And how at length the promisd shore to gain
 The rest the fates from Helenus conceal
 And Junos angry powr forbids to tell
 First then that happy shore that seems so nigh
 Will far from your deluded wishes fly
 Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy
 For you must cruise along Sicilian shores
 And stem the currents with your struggling oars
 Then round th Italian coast your navy steer
 And after this to Circes island veer
 And last before your new foundations rise
 Must pass the Stygian lake and view the nether skies
 Now mark the signs of future ease and rest
 And bear them safely treasurd in thy breast
 When in the shady shelter of a wood
 And near the margin of a gentle flood
 Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground
 With thirty sucking young encompassd round
 The dam and offspring white as falling snow
 These on thy city shall their name bestow
 And there shall end thy labors and thy woe
 Nor let the threatend famine fright thy mind
 For Phoebus will assist and Fate the way will find
 Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent
 Which fronts from far th Epirian continent
 Those parts are all by Grecian foes possessd
 The salvage Locrians here the shores infest
 There fierce Idomeneus his city builds
 And guards with arms the Salentinian fields
 And on the mountains brow Petilia stands
 Which Philoctetes with his troops commands
 Evn when thy fleet is landed on the shore
 And priests with holy vows the gods adore
 Then with a purple veil involve your eyes
 Lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice
 These rites and customs to the rest commend
 That to your pious race they may descend

 When parted hence the wind that ready waits
 For Sicily shall bear you to the straits
 Where proud Pelorus opes a wider way
 Tack to the larboard and stand off to sea
 Veer starboard sea and land Th Italian shore
 And fair Sicilias coast were one before
 An earthquake causd the flaw the roaring tides
 The passage broke that land from land divides
 And where the lands retird the rushing ocean rides
 Distinguishd by the straits on either hand
 Now rising cities in long order stand
 And fruitful fields so much can time invade
 The moldring work that beauteous Nature made
 Far on the right her dogs foul Scylla hides
 Charybdis roaring on the left presides
 And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides
 Then spouts them from below with fury drivn
 The waves mount up and wash the face of heavn
 But Scylla from her den with open jaws
 The sinking vessel in her eddy draws
 Then dashes on the rocks A human face
 And virgin bosom hides her tails disgrace
 Her parts obscene below the waves descend
 With dogs inclosd and in a dolphin end
 T is safer then to bear aloof to sea
 And coast Pachynus tho with more delay
 Than once to view misshapen Scylla near
 And the loud yell of watry wolves to hear

 Besides if faith to Helenus be due
 And if prophetic Phoebus tell me true
 Do not this precept of your friend forget
 Which therefore more than once I must repeat
 Above the rest great Junos name adore
 Pay vows to Juno Junos aid implore
 Let gifts be to the mighty queen designd
 And mollify with prayrs her haughty mind
 Thus at the length your passage shall be free
 And you shall safe descend on Italy
 Arrivd at Cumae when you view the flood
 Of black Avernus and the sounding wood
 The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find
 Dark in a cave and on a rock reclind
 She sings the fates and in her frantic fits
 The notes and names inscribd to leafs commits
 What she commits to leafs in order laid
 Before the caverns entrance are displayd
 Unmovd they lie but if a blast of wind
 Without or vapors issue from behind
 The leafs are borne aloft in liquid air
 And she resumes no more her museful care
 Nor gathers from the rocks her scatterd verse
 Nor sets in order what the winds disperse
 Thus many not succeeding most upbraid
 The madness of the visionary maid
 And with loud curses leave the mystic shade

 Think it not loss of time a while to stay
 Tho thy companions chide thy long delay
 Tho summond to the seas tho pleasing gales
 Invite thy course and stretch thy swelling sails
 But beg the sacred priestess to relate
 With willing words and not to write thy fate
 The fierce Italian people she will show
 And all thy wars and all thy future woe
 And what thou mayst avoid and what must undergo
 She shall direct thy course instruct thy mind
 And teach thee how the happy shores to find
 This is what Heavn allows me to relate
 Now part in peace pursue thy better fate
 And raise by strength of arms the Trojan state

 This when the priest with friendly voice declard
 He gave me license and rich gifts prepard
 Bounteous of treasure he supplied my want
 With heavy gold and polishd elephant
 Then Dodonaean caldrons put on board
 And evry ship with sums of silver stord
 A trusty coat of mail to me he sent
 Thrice chaind with gold for use and ornament
 The helm of Pyrrhus added to the rest
 That flourishd with a plume and waving crest
 Nor was my sire forgotten nor my friends
 And large recruits he to my navy sends
 Men horses captains arms and warlike stores
 Supplies new pilots and new sweeping oars
 Meantime my sire commands to hoist our sails
 Lest we should lose the first auspicious gales

 The prophet blessd the parting crew and last
 With words like these his ancient friend embracd
 Old happy man the care of gods above
 Whom heavnly Venus honord with her love
 And twice preservd thy life when Troy was lost
 Behold from far the wishd Ausonian coast
 There land but take a larger compass round
 For that before is all forbidden ground
 The shore that Phoebus has designd for you
 At farther distance lies conceald from view
 Go happy hence and seek your new abodes
 Blest in a son and favord by the gods
 For I with useless words prolong your stay
 When southern gales have summond you away

 Nor less the queen our parting thence deplord
 Nor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord
 A noble present to my son she brought
 A robe with flowrs on golden tissue wrought
 A phrygian vest and loads with gifts beside
 Of precious texture and of Asian pride
 Accept she said these monuments of love
 Which in my youth with happier hands I wove
 Regard these trifles for the givers sake
 T is the last present Hectors wife can make
 Thou callst my lost Astyanax to mind
 In thee his features and his form I find
 His eyes so sparkled with a lively flame
 Such were his motions such was all his frame
 And ah had Heavn so pleasd his years had been the same

 With tears I took my last adieu and said
 Your fortune happy pair already made
 Leaves you no farther wish My diffrent state
 Avoiding one incurs another fate
 To you a quiet seat the gods allow
 You have no shores to search no seas to plow
 Nor fields of flying Italy to chase
 Deluding visions and a vain embrace
 You see another Simois and enjoy
 The labor of your hands another Troy
 With better auspice than her ancient towrs
 And less obnoxious to the Grecian powrs
 If eer the gods whom I with vows adore
 Conduct my steps to Tibers happy shore
 If ever I ascend the Latian throne
 And build a city I may call my own
 As both of us our birth from Troy derive
 So let our kindred lines in concord live
 And both in acts of equal friendship strive
 Our fortunes good or bad shall be the same
 The double Troy shall differ but in name
 That what we now begin may never end
 But long to late posterity descend

 Near the Ceraunian rocks our course we bore
 The shortest passage to th Italian shore
 Now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light
 And hills were hid in dusky shades of night
 We land and on the bosom Of the ground
 A safe retreat and a bare lodging found
 Close by the shore we lay the sailors keep
 Their watches and the rest securely sleep
 The night proceeding on with silent pace
 Stood in her noon and viewd with equal face
 Her steepy rise and her declining race
 Then wakeful Palinurus rose to spy
 The face of heavn and the nocturnal sky
 And listend evry breath of air to try
 Observes the stars and notes their sliding course
 The Pleiads Hyads and their watry force
 And both the Bears is careful to behold
 And bright Orion armd with burnishd gold
 Then when he saw no threatning tempest nigh
 But a sure promise of a settled sky
 He gave the sign to weigh we break our sleep
 Forsake the pleasing shore and plow the deep

 And now the rising morn with rosy light
 Adorns the skies and puts the stars to flight
 When we from far like bluish mists descry
 The hills and then the plains of Italy
 Achates first pronouncd the joyful sound
 Then Italy the cheerful crew rebound
 My sire Anchises crownd a cup with wine
 And offring thus implord the powrs divine
 Ye gods presiding over lands and seas
 And you who raging winds and waves appease
 Breathe on our swelling sails a prosprous wind
 And smooth our passage to the port assignd
 The gentle gales their flagging force renew
 And now the happy harbor is in view
 Minervas temple then salutes our sight
 Placd as a landmark on the mountains height
 We furl our sails and turn the prows to shore
 The curling waters round the galleys roar
 The land lies open to the raging east
 Then bending like a bow with rocks compressd
 Shuts out the storms the winds and waves complain
 And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain
 The port lies hid within on either side
 Two towring rocks the narrow mouth divide
 The temple which aloft we viewd before
 To distance flies and seems to shun the shore
 Scarce landed the first omens I beheld
 Were four white steeds that croppd the flowry field
 War war is threatend from this foreign ground
 My father cried where warlike steeds are found
 Yet since reclaimd to chariots they submit
 And bend to stubborn yokes and champ the bit
 Peace may succeed to war Our way we bend
 To Pallas and the sacred hill ascend
 There prostrate to the fierce virago pray
 Whose temple was the landmark of our way
 Each with a Phrygian mantle veild his head
 And all commands of Helenus obeyd
 And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid
 These dues performd we stretch our sails and stand
 To sea forsaking that suspected land

 From hence Tarentums bay appears in view
 For Hercules renownd if fame be true
 Just opposite Lacinian Juno stands
 Caulonian towrs and Scylacaean strands
 For shipwrecks feard Mount Aetna thence we spy
 Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky
 Far off we hear the waves with surly sound
 Invade the rocks the rocks their groans rebound
 The billows break upon the sounding strand
 And roll the rising tide impure with sand
 Then thus Anchises in experience old
 T is that Charybdis which the seer foretold
 And those the promisd rocks Bear off to sea
 With haste the frighted mariners obey
 First Palinurus to the larboard veerd
 Then all the fleet by his example steerd
 To heavn aloft on ridgy waves we ride
 Then down to hell descend when they divide
 And thrice our galleys knockd the stony ground
 And thrice the hollow rocks returnd the sound
 And thrice we saw the stars that stood with dews around
 The flagging winds forsook us with the sun
 And wearied on Cyclopian shores we run
 The port capacious and secure from wind
 Is to the foot of thundring Aetna joind
 By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high
 By turns hot embers from her entrails fly
 And flakes of mounting flames that lick the sky
 Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown
 And shiverd by the force come piecemeal down
 Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow
 Fed from the fiery springs that boil below
 Enceladus they say transfixd by Jove
 With blasted limbs came tumbling from above
 And where he fell th avenging father drew
 This flaming hill and on his body threw
 As often as he turns his weary sides
 He shakes the solid isle and smoke the heavens hides
 In shady woods we pass the tedious night
 Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright
 Of which no cause is offerd to the sight
 For not one star was kindled in the sky
 Nor could the moon her borrowd light supply
 For misty clouds involvd the firmament
 The stars were muffled and the moon was pent

 Scarce had the rising sun the day reveald
 Scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispelld
 When from the woods there bolts before our sight
 Somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite
 So thin so ghastly meager and so wan
 So bare of flesh he scarce resembled man
 This thing all tatterd seemd from far t implore
 Our pious aid and pointed to the shore
 We look behind then view his shaggy beard
 His clothes were taggd with thorns and filth his limbs
 besmeard
 The rest in mien in habit and in face
 Appeard a Greek and such indeed he was
 He cast on us from far a frightful view
 Whom soon for Trojans and for foes he knew
 Stood still and pausd then all at once began
 To stretch his limbs and trembled as he ran
 Soon as approachd upon his knees he falls
 And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls
 Now by the powrs above and what we share
 From Natures common gift this vital air
 O Trojans take me hence I beg no more
 But bear me far from this unhappy shore
 T is true I am a Greek and farther own
 Among your foes besiegd th imperial town
 For such demerits if my death be due
 No more for this abandond life I sue
 This only favor let my tears obtain
 To throw me headlong in the rapid main
 Since nothing more than death my crime demands
 I die content to die by human hands
 He said and on his knees my knees embracd
 I bade him boldly tell his fortune past
 His present state his lineage and his name
 Th occasion of his fears and whence he came
 The good Anchises raisd him with his hand
 Who thus encouragd answerd our demand
 From Ithaca my native soil I came
 To Troy and Achaemenides my name
 Me my poor father with Ulysses sent
 O had I stayd with poverty content
 But fearful for themselves my countrymen
 Left me forsaken in the Cyclops den
 The cave tho large was dark the dismal floor
 Was pavd with mangled limbs and putrid gore
 Our monstrous host of more than human size
 Erects his head and stares within the skies
 Bellowing his voice and horrid is his hue
 Ye gods remove this plague from mortal view
 The joints of slaughterd wretches are his food
 And for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood
 These eyes beheld when with his spacious hand
 He seizd two captives of our Grecian band
 Stretchd on his back he dashd against the stones
 Their broken bodies and their crackling bones
 With spouting blood the purple pavement swims
 While the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs

 Not unrevengd Ulysses bore their fate
 Nor thoughtless of his own unhappy state
 For gorgd with flesh and drunk with human wine
 While fast asleep the giant lay supine
 Snoring aloud and belching from his maw
 His indigested foam and morsels raw
 We pray we cast the lots and then surround
 The monstrous body stretchd along the ground
 Each as he could approach him lends a hand
 To bore his eyeball with a flaming brand
 Beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye
 For only one did the vast frame supply
 But that a globe so large his front it filld
 Like the suns disk or like a Grecian shield
 The stroke succeeds and down the pupil bends
 This vengeance followd for our slaughterd friends
 But haste unhappy wretches haste to fly
 Your cables cut and on your oars rely
 Such and so vast as Polypheme appears
 A hundred more this hated island bears
 Like him in caves they shut their woolly sheep
 Like him their herds on tops of mountains keep
 Like him with mighty strides they stalk from steep to steep
 And now three moons their sharpend horns renew
 Since thus in woods and wilds obscure from view
 I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright
 And in deserted caverns lodge by night
 Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see
 Of the huge Cyclops like a walking tree
 From far I hear his thundring voice resound
 And trampling feet that shake the solid ground
 Cornels and salvage berries of the wood
 And roots and herbs have been my meager food
 While all around my longing eyes I cast
 I saw your happy ships appear at last
 On those I fixd my hopes to these I run
 T is all I ask this cruel race to shun
 What other death you please yourselves bestow

 Scarce had he said when on the mountains brow
 We saw the giant shepherd stalk before
 His following flock and leading to the shore
 A monstrous bulk deformd deprivd of sight
 His staff a trunk of pine to guide his steps aright
 His pondrous whistle from his neck descends
 His woolly care their pensive lord attends
 This only solace his hard fortune sends
 Soon as he reachd the shore and touchd the waves
 From his bord eye the guttring blood he laves
 He gnashd his teeth and groand thro seas he strides
 And scarce the topmost billows touchd his sides

 Seizd with a sudden fear we run to sea
 The cables cut and silent haste away
 The welldeserving stranger entertain
 Then buckling to the work our oars divide the main
 The giant harkend to the dashing sound
 But when our vessels out of reach he found
 He strided onward and in vain essayd
 Th Ionian deep and durst no farther wade
 With that he roard aloud the dreadful cry
 Shakes earth and air and seas the billows fly
 Before the bellowing noise to distant Italy
 The neighring Aetna trembling all around
 The winding caverns echo to the sound
 His brother Cyclops hear the yelling roar
 And rushing down the mountains crowd the shore
 We saw their stern distorted looks from far
 And oneeyed glance that vainly threatend war
 A dreadful council with their heads on high
 The misty clouds about their foreheads fly
 Not yielding to the towring tree of Jove
 Or tallest cypress of Dianas grove
 New pangs of mortal fear our minds assail
 We tug at evry oar and hoist up evry sail
 And take th advantage of the friendly gale
 Forewarnd by Helenus we strive to shun
 Charybdis gulf nor dare to Scylla run
 An equal fate on either side appears
 We tacking to the left are free from fears
 For from Pelorus point the North arose
 And drove us back where swift Pantagias flows
 His rocky mouth we pass and make our way
 By Thapsus and Megaras winding bay
 This passage Achaemenides had shown
 Tracing the course which he before had run

 Right oer against Plemmyriums watry strand
 There lies an isle once calld th Ortygian land
 Alpheus as old fame reports has found
 From Greece a secret passage under ground
 By love to beauteous Arethusa led
 And mingling here they roll in the same sacred bed
 As Helenus enjoind we next adore
 Dianas name protectress of the shore
 With prosprous gales we pass the quiet sounds
 Of still Elorus and his fruitful bounds
 Then doubling Cape Pachynus we survey
 The rocky shore extended to the sea
 The town of Camarine from far we see
 And fenny lake undraind by fates decree
 In sight of the Geloan fields we pass
 And the large walls where mighty Gela was
 Then Agragas with lofty summits crownd
 Long for the race of warlike steeds renownd
 We passd Selinus and the palmy land
 And widely shun the Lilybaean strand
 Unsafe for secret rocks and moving sand
 At length on shore the weary fleet arrivd
 Which Drepanums unhappy port receivd
 Here after endless labors often tossd
 By raging storms and drivn on evry coast
 My dear dear father spent with age I lost
 Ease of my cares and solace of my pain
 Savd thro a thousand toils but savd in vain
 The prophet who my future woes reveald
 Yet this the greatest and the worst conceald
 And dire Celaeno whose foreboding skill
 Denouncd all else was silent of the ill
 This my last labor was Some friendly god
 From thence conveyd us to your blest abode

 Thus to the listning queen the royal guest
 His wandring course and all his toils expressd
 And here concluding he retird to rest




 BOOK IV

 But anxious cares already seizd the queen
 She fed within her veins a flame unseen
 The heros valor acts and birth inspire
 Her soul with love and fan the secret fire
 His words his looks imprinted in her heart
 Improve the passion and increase the smart
 Now when the purple morn had chasd away
 The dewy shadows and restord the day
 Her sister first with early care she sought
 And thus in mournful accents easd her thought

 My dearest Anna what new dreams affright
 My labring soul what visions of the night
 Disturb my quiet and distract my breast
 With strange ideas of our Trojan guest
 His worth his actions and majestic air
 A man descended from the gods declare
 Fear ever argues a degenerate kind
 His birth is well asserted by his mind
 Then what he sufferd when by Fate betrayd
 What brave attempts for falling Troy he made
 Such were his looks so gracefully he spoke
 That were I not resolvd against the yoke
 Of hapless marriage never to be curst
 With second love so fatal was my first
 To this one error I might yield again
 For since Sichaeus was untimely slain
 This only man is able to subvert
 The fixd foundations of my stubborn heart
 And to confess my frailty to my shame
 Somewhat I find within if not the same
 Too like the sparkles of my former flame
 But first let yawning earth a passage rend
 And let me thro the dark abyss descend
 First let avenging Jove with flames from high
 Drive down this body to the nether sky
 Condemnd with ghosts in endless night to lie
 Before I break the plighted faith I gave
 No he who had my vows shall ever have
 For whom I lovd on earth I worship in the grave

 She said the tears ran gushing from her eyes
 And stoppd her speech Her sister thus replies
 O dearer than the vital air I breathe
 Will you to grief your blooming years bequeath
 Condemnd to waste in woes your lonely life
 Without the joys of mother or of wife
 Think you these tears this pompous train of woe
 Are known or valued by the ghosts below
 I grant that while your sorrows yet were green
 It well became a woman and a queen
 The vows of Tyrian princes to neglect
 To scorn Hyarbas and his love reject
 With all the Libyan lords of mighty name
 But will you fight against a pleasing flame
 This little spot of land which Heavn bestows
 On evry side is hemmd with warlike foes
 Gaetulian cities here are spread around
 And fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound
 Here lies a barren waste of thirsty land
 And there the Syrtes raise the moving sand
 Barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore
 And from the sea Pygmalion threatens more
 Propitious Heavn and gracious Juno lead
 This wandring navy to your needful aid
 How will your empire spread your city rise
 From such a union and with such allies
 Implore the favor of the powrs above
 And leave the conduct of the rest to love
 Continue still your hospitable way
 And still invent occasions of their stay
 Till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat
 And planks and oars repair their shatterd fleet

 These words which from a friend and sister came
 With ease resolvd the scruples of her fame
 And added fury to the kindled flame
 Inspird with hope the project they pursue
 On evry altar sacrifice renew
 A chosen ewe of two years old they pay
 To Ceres Bacchus and the God of Day
 Preferring Junos powr for Juno ties
 The nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys
 The beauteous queen before her altar stands
 And holds the golden goblet in her hands
 A milkwhite heifer she with flowrs adorns
 And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns
 And while the priests with prayr the gods invoke
 She feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke
 With hourly care the sacrifice renews
 And anxiously the panting entrails views
 What priestly rites alas what pious art
 What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart
 A gentle fire she feeds within her veins
 Where the soft god secure in silence reigns

 Sick with desire and seeking him she loves
 From street to street the raving Dido roves
 So when the watchful shepherd from the blind
 Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind
 Distracted with her pain she flies the woods
 Bounds oer the lawn and seeks the silent floods
 With fruitless care for still the fatal dart
 Sticks in her side and rankles in her heart
 And now she leads the Trojan chief along
 The lofty walls amidst the busy throng
 Displays her Tyrian wealth and rising town
 Which love without his labor makes his own
 This pomp she shows to tempt her wandring guest
 Her faltring tongue forbids to speak the rest
 When day declines and feasts renew the night
 Still on his face she feeds her famishd sight
 She longs again to hear the prince relate
 His own adventures and the Trojan fate
 He tells it oer and oer but still in vain
 For still she begs to hear it once again
 The hearer on the speakers mouth depends
 And thus the tragic story never ends

 Then when they part when Phoebes paler light
 Withdraws and falling stars to sleep invite
 She last remains when evry guest is gone
 Sits on the bed he pressd and sighs alone
 Absent her absent hero sees and hears
 Or in her bosom young Ascanius bears
 And seeks the fathers image in the child
 If love by likeness might be so beguild

 Meantime the rising towrs are at a stand
 No labors exercise the youthful band
 Nor use of arts nor toils of arms they know
 The mole is left unfinishd to the foe
 The mounds the works the walls neglected lie
 Short of their promisd heighth that seemd to threat the sky

 But when imperial Juno from above
 Saw Dido fetterd in the chains of love
 Hot with the venom which her veins inflamd
 And by no sense of shame to be reclaimd
 With soothing words to Venus she begun
 High praises endless honors you have won
 And mighty trophies with your worthy son
 Two gods a silly woman have undone
 Nor am I ignorant you both suspect
 This rising city which my hands erect
 But shall celestial discord never cease
 T is better ended in a lasting peace
 You stand possessd of all your soul desird
 Poor Dido with consuming love is fird
 Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join
 So Dido shall be yours Aeneas mine
 One common kingdom one united line
 Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey
 And lofty Carthage for a dowr convey
 Then Venus who her hidden fraud descried
 Which would the scepter of the world misguide
 To Libyan shores thus artfully replied
 Who but a fool would wars with Juno choose
 And such alliance and such gifts refuse
 If Fortune with our joint desires comply
 The doubt is all from Jove and destiny
 Lest he forbid with absolute command
 To mix the people in one common land
 Or will the Trojan and the Tyrian line
 In lasting leagues and sure succession join
 But you the partner of his bed and throne
 May move his mind my wishes are your own

 Mine said imperial Juno be the care
 Time urges now to perfect this affair
 Attend my counsel and the secret share
 When next the Sun his rising light displays
 And gilds the world below with purple rays
 The queen Aeneas and the Tyrian court
 Shall to the shady woods for sylvan game resort
 There while the huntsmen pitch their toils around
 And cheerful horns from side to side resound
 A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain
 With hail and thunder and tempestuous rain
 The fearful train shall take their speedy flight
 Dispersd and all involvd in gloomy night
 One cave a grateful shelter shall afford
 To the fair princess and the Trojan lord
 I will myself the bridal bed prepare
 If you to bless the nuptials will be there
 So shall their loves be crownd with due delights
 And Hymen shall be present at the rites
 The Queen of Love consents and closely smiles
 At her vain project and discoverd wiles

 The rosy morn was risen from the main
 And horns and hounds awake the princely train
 They issue early thro the city gate
 Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait
 With nets and toils and darts beside the force
 Of Spartan dogs and swift Massylian horse
 The Tyrian peers and officers of state
 For the slow queen in antechambers wait
 Her lofty courser in the court below
 Who his majestic rider seems to know
 Proud of his purple trappings paws the ground
 And champs the golden bit and spreads the foam around
 The queen at length appears on either hand
 The brawny guards in martial order stand
 A flowrd simar with golden fringe she wore
 And at her back a golden quiver bore
 Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains
 A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains
 Then young Ascanius with a sprightly grace
 Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase
 But far above the rest in beauty shines
 The great Aeneas the troop he joins
 Like fair Apollo when he leaves the frost
 Of wintry Xanthus and the Lycian coast
 When to his native Delos he resorts
 Ordains the dances and renews the sports
 Where painted Scythians mixd with Cretan bands
 Before the joyful altars join their hands
 Himself on Cynthus walking sees below
 The merry madness of the sacred show
 Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose
 A golden fillet binds his awful brows
 His quiver sounds not less the prince is seen
 In manly presence or in lofty mien

 Now had they reachd the hills and stormd the seat
 Of salvage beasts in dens their last retreat
 The cry pursues the mountain goats they bound
 From rock to rock and keep the craggy ground
 Quite otherwise the stags a trembling train
 In herds unsingled scour the dusty plain
 And a long chase in open view maintain
 The glad Ascanius as his courser guides
 Spurs thro the vale and these and those outrides
 His horses flanks and sides are forcd to feel
 The clanking lash and goring of the steel
 Impatiently he views the feeble prey
 Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way
 And rather would the tusky boar attend
 Or see the tawny lion downward bend

 Meantime the gathring clouds obscure the skies
 From pole to pole the forky lightning flies
 The rattling thunders roll and Juno pours
 A wintry deluge down and sounding showrs
 The company dispersd to converts ride
 And seek the homely cots or mountains hollow side
 The rapid rains descending from the hills
 To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills
 The queen and prince as love or fortune guides
 One common cavern in her bosom hides
 Then first the trembling earth the signal gave
 And flashing fires enlighten all the cave
 Hell from below and Juno from above
 And howling nymphs were conscious of their love
 From this illomend hour in time arose
 Debate and death and all succeeding woes

 The queen whom sense of honor could not move
 No longer made a secret of her love
 But calld it marriage by that specious name
 To veil the crime and sanctify the shame

 The loud report thro Libyan cities goes
 Fame the great ill from small beginnings grows
 Swift from the first and evry moment brings
 New vigor to her flights new pinions to her wings
 Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size
 Her feet on earth her forehead in the skies
 Inragd against the gods revengeful Earth
 Producd her last of the Titanian birth
 Swift is her walk more swift her winged haste
 A monstrous phantom horrible and vast
 As many plumes as raise her lofty flight
 So many piercing eyes inlarge her sight
 Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong
 And evry mouth is furnishd with a tongue
 And round with listning ears the flying plague is hung
 She fills the peaceful universe with cries
 No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes
 By day from lofty towrs her head she shews
 And spreads thro trembling crowds disastrous news
 With court informers haunts and royal spies
 Things done relates not done she feigns and mingles truth with lies

 Talk is her business and her chief delight
 To tell of prodigies and cause affright
 She fills the peoples ears with Didos name
 Who lost to honor and the sense of shame
 Admits into her throne and nuptial bed
 A wandring guest who from his country fled
 Whole days with him she passes in delights
 And wastes in luxury long winter nights
 Forgetful of her fame and royal trust
 Dissolvd in ease abandond to her lust

 The goddess widely spreads the loud report
 And flies at length to King Hyarbas court
 When first possessd with this unwelcome news
 Whom did he not of men and gods accuse
 This prince from ravishd Garamantis born
 A hundred temples did with spoils adorn
 In Ammons honor his celestial sire
 A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire
 And thro his vast dominions priests ordaind
 Whose watchful care these holy rites maintaind
 The gates and columns were with garlands crownd
 And blood of victim beasts enrichd the ground

 He when he heard a fugitive could move
 The Tyrian princess who disdaind his love
 His breast with fury burnd his eyes with fire
 Mad with despair impatient with desire
 Then on the sacred altars pouring wine
 He thus with prayrs implord his sire divine
 Great Jove propitious to the Moorish race
 Who feast on painted beds with offrings grace
 Thy temples and adore thy powr divine
 With blood of victims and with sparkling wine
 Seest thou not this or do we fear in vain
 Thy boasted thunder and thy thoughtless reign
 Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance
 Thine are the bolts or the blind work of chance
 A wandring woman builds within our state
 A little town bought at an easy rate
 She pays me homage and my grants allow
 A narrow space of Libyan lands to plow
 Yet scorning me by passion blindly led
 Admits a banishd Trojan to her bed
 And now this other Paris with his train
 Of conquerd cowards must in Afric reign
 Whom what they are their looks and garb confess
 Their locks with oil perfumd their Lydian dress
 He takes the spoil enjoys the princely dame
 And I rejected I adore an empty name

 His vows in haughty terms he thus preferrd
 And held his altars horns The mighty Thundrer heard
 Then cast his eyes on Carthage where he found
 The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drownd
 Lost in their loves insensible of shame
 And both forgetful of their better fame
 He calls Cyllenius and the god attends
 By whom his menacing command he sends
 Go mount the western winds and cleave the sky
 Then with a swift descent to Carthage fly
 There find the Trojan chief who wastes his days
 In slothful riot and inglorious ease
 Nor minds the future city givn by fate
 To him this message from my mouth relate
 Not so fair Venus hopd when twice she won
 Thy life with prayrs nor promisd such a son
 Hers was a hero destind to command
 A martial race and rule the Latian land
 Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw
 And on the conquerd world impose the law
 If glory cannot move a mind so mean
 Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean
 Yet why should he defraud his son of fame
 And grudge the Romans their immortal name
 What are his vain designs what hopes he more
 From his long lingring on a hostile shore
 Regardless to redeem his honor lost
 And for his race to gain th Ausonian coast
 Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake
 With this command the slumbring warrior wake

 Hermes obeys with golden pinions binds
 His flying feet and mounts the western winds
 And whether oer the seas or earth he flies
 With rapid force they bear him down the skies
 But first he grasps within his awful hand
 The mark of sovreign powr his magic wand
 With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves
 With this he drives them down the Stygian waves
 With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight
 And eyes tho closd in death restores to light
 Thus armd the god begins his airy race
 And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space
 Now sees the tops of Atlas as he flies
 Whose brawny back supports the starry skies
 Atlas whose head with piny forests crownd
 Is beaten by the winds with foggy vapors bound
 Snows hide his shoulders from beneath his chin
 The founts of rolling streams their race begin
 A beard of ice on his large breast depends
 Here poisd upon his wings the god descends
 Then rested thus he from the towring height
 Plungd downward with precipitated flight
 Lights on the seas and skims along the flood
 As waterfowl who seek their fishy food
 Less and yet less to distant prospect show
 By turns they dance aloft and dive below
 Like these the steerage of his wings he plies
 And near the surface of the water flies
 Till having passd the seas and crossd the sands
 He closd his wings and stoopd on Libyan lands
 Where shepherds once were housd in homely sheds
 Now towrs within the clouds advance their heads
 Arriving there he found the Trojan prince
 New ramparts raising for the towns defense
 A purple scarf with gold embroiderd oer
 Queen Didos gift about his waist he wore
 A sword with glittring gems diversified
 For ornament not use hung idly by his side

 Then thus with winged words the god began
 Resuming his own shape Degenerate man
 Thou womans property what makst thou here
 These foreign walls and Tyrian towrs to rear
 Forgetful of thy own Allpowrful Jove
 Who sways the world below and heavn above
 Has sent me down with this severe command
 What means thy lingring in the Libyan land
 If glory cannot move a mind so mean
 Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean
 Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir
 The promisd crown let young Ascanius wear
 To whom th Ausonian scepter and the state
 Of Romes imperial name is owd by fate
 So spoke the god and speaking took his flight
 Involvd in clouds and vanishd out of sight

 The pious prince was seizd with sudden fear
 Mute was his tongue and upright stood his hair
 Revolving in his mind the stern command
 He longs to fly and loathes the charming land
 What should he say or how should he begin
 What course alas remains to steer between
 Th offended lover and the powrful queen
 This way and that he turns his anxious mind
 And all expedients tries and none can find
 Fixd on the deed but doubtful of the means
 After long thought to this advice he leans
 Three chiefs he calls commands them to repair
 The fleet and ship their men with silent care
 Some plausible pretense he bids them find
 To color what in secret he designd
 Himself meantime the softest hours would choose
 Before the lovesick lady heard the news
 And move her tender mind by slow degrees
 To suffer what the sovreign powr decrees
 Jove will inspire him when and what to say
 They hear with pleasure and with haste obey

 But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise
 What arts can blind a jealous womans eyes
 She was the first to find the secret fraud
 Before the fatal news was blazd abroad
 Love the first motions of the lover hears
 Quick to presage and evn in safety fears
 Nor impious Fame was wanting to report
 The ships repaird the Trojans thick resort
 And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court
 Frantic with fear impatient of the wound
 And impotent of mind she roves the city round
 Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear
 When from afar their nightly god they hear
 And howl about the hills and shake the wreathy spear
 At length she finds the dear perfidious man
 Prevents his formd excuse and thus began
 Base and ungrateful could you hope to fly
 And undiscoverd scape a lovers eye
 Nor could my kindness your compassion move
 Nor plighted vows nor dearer bands of love
 Or is the death of a despairing queen
 Not worth preventing tho too well foreseen
 Evn when the wintry winds command your stay
 You dare the tempests and defy the sea
 False as you are suppose you were not bound
 To lands unknown and foreign coasts to sound
 Were Troy restord and Priams happy reign
 Now durst you tempt for Troy the raging main
 See whom you fly am I the foe you shun
 Now by those holy vows so late begun
 By this right hand since I have nothing more
 To challenge but the faith you gave before
 I beg you by these tears too truly shed
 By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed
 If ever Dido when you most were kind
 Were pleasing in your eyes or touchd your mind
 By these my prayrs if prayrs may yet have place
 Pity the fortunes of a falling race
 For you I have provokd a tyrants hate
 Incensd the Libyan and the Tyrian state
 For you alone I suffer in my fame
 Bereft of honor and exposd to shame
 Whom have I now to trust ungrateful guest
 That only name remains of all the rest
 What have I left or whither can I fly
 Must I attend Pygmalions cruelty
 Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead
 A queen that proudly scornd his profferd bed
 Had you deferrd at least your hasty flight
 And left behind some pledge of our delight
 Some babe to bless the mothers mournful sight
 Some young Aeneas to supply your place
 Whose features might express his fathers face
 I should not then complain to live bereft
 Of all my husband or be wholly left

 Here pausd the queen Unmovd he holds his eyes
 By Joves command nor sufferd love to rise
 Tho heaving in his heart and thus at length replies
 Fair queen you never can enough repeat
 Your boundless favors or I own my debt
 Nor can my mind forget Elizas name
 While vital breath inspires this mortal frame
 This only let me speak in my defense
 I never hopd a secret flight from hence
 Much less pretended to the lawful claim
 Of sacred nuptials or a husbands name
 For if indulgent Heavn would leave me free
 And not submit my life to fates decree
 My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore
 Those relics to review their dust adore
 And Priams ruind palace to restore
 But now the Delphian oracle commands
 And fate invites me to the Latian lands
 That is the promisd place to which I steer
 And all my vows are terminated there
 If you a Tyrian and a stranger born
 With walls and towrs a Libyan town adorn
 Why may not we like you a foreign race
 Like you seek shelter in a foreign place
 As often as the night obscures the skies
 With humid shades or twinkling stars arise
 Anchises angry ghost in dreams appears
 Chides my delay and fills my soul with fears
 And young Ascanius justly may complain
 Of his defrauded and destind reign
 Evn now the herald of the gods appeard
 Waking I saw him and his message heard
 From Jove he came commissiond heavnly bright
 With radiant beams and manifest to sight
 The sender and the sent I both attest
 These walls he enterd and those words expressd
 Fair queen oppose not what the gods command
 Forcd by my fate I leave your happy land

 Thus while he spoke already she began
 With sparkling eyes to view the guilty man
 From head to foot surveyd his person oer
 Nor longer these outrageous threats forebore
 False as thou art and more than false forsworn
 Not sprung from noble blood nor goddessborn
 But hewn from hardend entrails of a rock
 And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck
 Why should I fawn what have I worse to fear
 Did he once look or lent a listning ear
 Sighd when I sobbd or shed one kindly tear
 All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind
 So foul that which is worse tis hard to find
 Of mans injustice why should I complain
 The gods and Jove himself behold in vain
 Triumphant treason yet no thunder flies
 Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes
 Faithless is earth and faithless are the skies
 Justice is fled and Truth is now no more
 I savd the shipwrackd exile on my shore
 With needful food his hungry Trojans fed
 I took the traitor to my throne and bed
 Fool that I was t is little to repeat
 The rest I stord and riggd his ruind fleet
 I rave I rave A gods command he pleads
 And makes Heavn accessary to his deeds
 Now Lycian lots and now the Delian god
 Now Hermes is employd from Joves abode
 To warn him hence as if the peaceful state
 Of heavnly powrs were touchd with human fate
 But go thy flight no longer I detain
 Go seek thy promisd kingdom thro the main
 Yet if the heavns will hear my pious vow
 The faithless waves not half so false as thou
 Or secret sands shall sepulchers afford
 To thy proud vessels and their perjurd lord
 Then shalt thou call on injurd Didos name
 Dido shall come in a black sulphry flame
 When death has once dissolvd her mortal frame
 Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep
 Her angry ghost arising from the deep
 Shall haunt thee waking and disturb thy sleep
 At least my shade thy punishment shall know
 And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below

 Abruptly here she stops then turns away
 Her loathing eyes and shuns the sight of day
 Amazd he stood revolving in his mind
 What speech to frame and what excuse to find
 Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led
 And softly laid her on her ivory bed

 But good Aeneas tho he much desird
 To give that pity which her grief requird
 Tho much he mournd and labord with his love
 Resolvd at length obeys the will of Jove
 Reviews his forces they with early care
 Unmoor their vessels and for sea prepare
 The fleet is soon afloat in all its pride
 And wellcalkd galleys in the harbor ride
 Then oaks for oars they felld or as they stood
 Of its green arms despoild the growing wood
 Studious of flight The beach is coverd oer
 With Trojan bands that blacken all the shore
 On evry side are seen descending down
 Thick swarms of soldiers loaden from the town
 Thus in battalia march embodied ants
 Fearful of winter and of future wants
 T invade the corn and to their cells convey
 The plunderd forage of their yellow prey
 The sable troops along the narrow tracks
 Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs
 Some set their shoulders to the pondrous grain
 Some guard the spoil some lash the lagging train
 All ply their sevral tasks and equal toil sustain

 What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore
 When from the towr she saw the coverd shore
 And heard the shouts of sailors from afar
 Mixd with the murmurs of the watry war
 Allpowrful Love what changes canst thou cause
 In human hearts subjected to thy laws
 Once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends
 To prayrs and mean submissions she descends
 No female arts or aids she left untried
 Nor counsels unexplord before she died
 Look Anna look the Trojans crowd to sea
 They spread their canvas and their anchors weigh
 The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind
 Invoke the sea gods and invite the wind
 Could I have thought this threatning blow so near
 My tender soul had been forewarnd to bear
 But do not you my last request deny
 With yon perfidious man your intrest try
 And bring me news if I must live or die
 You are his favrite you alone can find
 The dark recesses of his inmost mind
 In all his trusted secrets you have part
 And know the soft approaches to his heart
 Haste then and humbly seek my haughty foe
 Tell him I did not with the Grecians go
 Nor did my fleet against his friends employ
 Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy
 Nor movd with hands profane his fathers dust
 Why should he then reject a suit so just
 Whom does he shun and whither would he fly
 Can he this last this only prayr deny
 Let him at least his dangrous flight delay
 Wait better winds and hope a calmer sea
 The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more
 Let him pursue the promisd Latian shore
 A short delay is all I ask him now
 A pause of grief an interval from woe
 Till my soft soul be temperd to sustain
 Accustomd sorrows and inurd to pain
 If you in pity grant this one request
 My death shall glut the hatred of his breast
 This mournful message pious Anna bears
 And seconds with her own her sisters tears
 But all her arts are still employd in vain
 Again she comes and is refusd again
 His hardend heart nor prayrs nor threatnings move
 Fate and the god had stoppd his ears to love

 As when the winds their airy quarrel try
 Justling from evry quarter of the sky
 This way and that the mountain oak they bend
 His boughs they shatter and his branches rend
 With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground
 The hollow valleys echo to the sound
 Unmovd the royal plant their fury mocks
 Or shaken clings more closely to the rocks
 Far as he shoots his towring head on high
 So deep in earth his fixd foundations lie
 No less a storm the Trojan hero bears
 Thick messages and loud complaints he hears
 And bandied words still beating on his ears
 Sighs groans and tears proclaim his inward pains
 But the firm purpose of his heart remains

 The wretched queen pursued by cruel fate
 Begins at length the light of heavn to hate
 And loathes to live Then dire portents she sees
 To hasten on the death her soul decrees
 Strange to relate for when before the shrine
 She pours in sacrifice the purple wine
 The purple wine is turnd to putrid blood
 And the white offerd milk converts to mud
 This dire presage to her alone reveald
 From all and evn her sister she conceald
 A marble temple stood within the grove
 Sacred to death and to her murtherd love
 That honord chapel she had hung around
 With snowy fleeces and with garlands crownd
 Oft when she visited this lonely dome
 Strange voices issued from her husbands tomb
 She thought she heard him summon her away
 Invite her to his grave and chide her stay
 Hourly t is heard when with a boding note
 The solitary screech owl strains her throat
 And on a chimneys top or turrets height
 With songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night
 Besides old prophecies augment her fears
 And stern Aeneas in her dreams appears
 Disdainful as by day she seems alone
 To wander in her sleep thro ways unknown
 Guideless and dark or in a desart plain
 To seek her subjects and to seek in vain
 Like Pentheus when distracted with his fear
 He saw two suns and double Thebes appear
 Or mad Orestes when his mothers ghost
 Full in his face infernal torches tossd
 And shook her snaky locks he shuns the sight
 Flies oer the stage surprisd with mortal fright
 The Furies guard the door and intercept his flight

 Now sinking underneath a load of grief
 From death alone she seeks her last relief
 The time and means resolvd within her breast
 She to her mournful sister thus addressd
 Dissembling hope her cloudy front she clears
 And a false vigor in her eyes appears
 Rejoice she said Instructed from above
 My lover I shall gain or lose my love
 Nigh rising Atlas next the falling sun
 Long tracts of Ethiopian climates run
 There a Massylian priestess I have found
 Honord for age for magic arts renownd
 Th Hesperian temple was her trusted care
 T was she supplied the wakeful dragons fare
 She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep
 Reclaimd his rage and soothd him into sleep
 She watchd the golden fruit her charms unbind
 The chains of love or fix them on the mind
 She stops the torrents leaves the channel dry
 Repels the stars and backward bears the sky
 The yawning earth rebellows to her call
 Pale ghosts ascend and mountain ashes fall
 Witness ye gods and thou my better part
 How loth I am to try this impious art
 Within the secret court with silent care
 Erect a lofty pile exposd in air
 Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest
 Spoils arms and presents of my faithless guest
 Next under these the bridal bed be placd
 Where I my ruin in his arms embracd
 All relics of the wretch are doomd to fire
 For so the priestess and her charms require

 Thus far she said and farther speech forbears
 A mortal paleness in her face appears
 Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find
 The secret funral in these rites designd
 Nor thought so dire a rage possessd her mind
 Unknowing of a train conceald so well
 She feard no worse than when Sichaeus fell
 Therefore obeys The fatal pile they rear
 Within the secret court exposd in air
 The cloven holms and pines are heapd on high
 And garlands on the hollow spaces lie
 Sad cypress vervain yew compose the wreath
 And evry baleful green denoting death
 The queen determind to the fatal deed
 The spoils and sword he left in order spread
 And the mans image on the nuptial bed

 And now the sacred altars placd around
 The priestess enters with her hair unbound
 And thrice invokes the powrs below the ground
 Night Erebus and Chaos she proclaims
 And threefold Hecate with her hundred names
 And three Dianas next she sprinkles round
 With feignd Avernian drops the hallowd ground
 Culls hoary simples found by Phoebes light
 With brazen sickles reapd at noon of night
 Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl
 And cuts the forehead of a newborn foal
 Robbing the mothers love The destind queen
 Observes assisting at the rites obscene
 A leavend cake in her devoted hands
 She holds and next the highest altar stands
 One tender foot was shod her other bare
 Girt was her gatherd gown and loose her hair
 Thus dressd she summond with her dying breath
 The heavns and planets conscious of her death
 And evry powr if any rules above
 Who minds or who revenges injurd love

 T was dead of night when weary bodies close
 Their eyes in balmy sleep and soft repose
 The winds no longer whisper thro the woods
 Nor murmring tides disturb the gentle floods
 The stars in silent order movd around
 And Peace with downy wings was brooding on the ground
 The flocks and herds and partycolord fowl
 Which haunt the woods or swim the weedy pool
 Stretchd on the quiet earth securely lay
 Forgetting the past labors of the day
 All else of natures common gift partake
 Unhappy Dido was alone awake
 Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find
 Sleep fled her eyes as quiet fled her mind
 Despair and rage and love divide her heart
 Despair and rage had some but love the greater part

 Then thus she said within her secret mind
 What shall I do what succor can I find
 Become a suppliant to Hyarbas pride
 And take my turn to court and be denied
 Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go
 Forsake an empire and attend a foe
 Himself I refugd and his train relievd
 T is true but am I sure to be receivd
 Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place
 Laomedon still lives in all his race
 Then shall I seek alone the churlish crew
 Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue
 What force have I but those whom scarce before
 I drew reluctant from their native shore
 Will they again embark at my desire
 Once more sustain the seas and quit their second Tyre
 Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade
 And take the fortune thou thyself hast made
 Your pity sister first seducd my mind
 Or seconded too well what I designd
 These dearbought pleasures had I never known
 Had I continued free and still my own
 Avoiding love I had not found despair
 But shard with salvage beasts the common air
 Like them a lonely life I might have led
 Not mournd the living nor disturbd the dead
 These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast
 On board the Trojan found more easy rest
 Resolvd to sail in sleep he passd the night
 And orderd all things for his early flight

 To whom once more the winged god appears
 His former youthful mien and shape he wears
 And with this new alarm invades his ears
 Sleepst thou O goddessborn and canst thou drown
 Thy needful cares so near a hostile town
 Beset with foes nor hearst the western gales
 Invite thy passage and inspire thy sails
 She harbors in her heart a furious hate
 And thou shalt find the dire effects too late
 Fixd on revenge and obstinate to die
 Haste swiftly hence while thou hast powr to fly
 The sea with ships will soon be coverd oer
 And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore
 Prevent her rage while night obscures the skies
 And sail before the purple morn arise
 Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring
 Womans a various and a changeful thing
 Thus Hermes in the dream then took his flight
 Aloft in air unseen and mixd with night

 Twice warnd by the celestial messenger
 The pious prince arose with hasty fear
 Then rousd his drowsy train without delay
 Haste to your banks your crooked anchors weigh
 And spread your flying sails and stand to sea
 A god commands he stood before my sight
 And urgd us once again to speedy flight
 O sacred powr what powr soeer thou art
 To thy blest orders I resign my heart
 Lead thou the way protect thy Trojan bands
 And prosper the design thy will commands
 He said and drawing forth his flaming sword
 His thundring arm divides the manytwisted cord
 An emulating zeal inspires his train
 They run they snatch they rush into the main
 With headlong haste they leave the desert shores
 And brush the liquid seas with labring oars

 Aurora now had left her saffron bed
 And beams of early light the heavns oerspread
 When from a towr the queen with wakeful eyes
 Saw day point upward from the rosy skies
 She lookd to seaward but the sea was void
 And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried
 Stung with despite and furious with despair
 She struck her trembling breast and tore her hair
 And shall th ungrateful traitor go she said
 My land forsaken and my love betrayd
 Shall we not arm not rush from evry street
 To follow sink and burn his perjurd fleet
 Haste haul my galleys out pursue the foe
 Bring flaming brands set sail and swiftly row
 What have I said where am I Fury turns
 My brain and my distemperd bosom burns
 Then when I gave my person and my throne
 This hate this rage had been more timely shown
 See now the promisd faith the vaunted name
 The pious man who rushing thro the flame
 Preservd his gods and to the Phrygian shore
 The burthen of his feeble father bore
 I should have torn him piecemeal strowd in floods
 His scatterd limbs or left exposd in woods
 Destroyd his friends and son and from the fire
 Have set the reeking boy before the sire
 Events are doubtful which on battles wait
 Yet wheres the doubt to souls secure of fate
 My Tyrians at their injurd queens command
 Had tossd their fires amid the Trojan band
 At once extinguishd all the faithless name
 And I myself in vengeance of my shame
 Had falln upon the pile to mend the funral flame
 Thou Sun who viewst at once the world below
 Thou Juno guardian of the nuptial vow
 Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes
 Ye Furies fiends and violated gods
 All powrs invokd with Didos dying breath
 Attend her curses and avenge her death
 If so the Fates ordain Jove commands
 Th ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands
 Yet let a race untamd and haughty foes
 His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose
 Oppressd with numbers in th unequal field
 His men discouragd and himself expelld
 Let him for succor sue from place to place
 Torn from his subjects and his sons embrace
 First let him see his friends in battle slain
 And their untimely fate lament in vain
 And when at length the cruel war shall cease
 On hard conditions may he buy his peace
 Nor let him then enjoy supreme command
 But fall untimely by some hostile hand
 And lie unburied on the barren sand
 These are my prayrs and this my dying will
 And you my Tyrians evry curse fulfil
 Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim
 Against the prince the people and the name
 These grateful offrings on my grave bestow
 Nor league nor love the hostile nations know
 Now and from hence in evry future age
 When rage excites your arms and strength supplies the rage
 Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood
 With fire and sword pursue the perjurd brood
 Our arms our seas our shores opposd to theirs
 And the same hate descend on all our heirs

 This said within her anxious mind she weighs
 The means of cutting short her odious days
 Then to Sichaeus nurse she briefly said
 For when she left her country hers was dead
 Go Barce call my sister Let her care
 The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare
 The sheep and all th atoning offrings bring
 Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring
 With living drops then let her come and thou
 With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow
 Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove
 And end the cares of my disastrous love
 Then cast the Trojan image on the fire
 And as that burns my passions shall expire

 The nurse moves onward with officious care
 And all the speed her aged limbs can bear
 But furious Dido with dark thoughts involvd
 Shook at the mighty mischief she resolvd
 With livid spots distinguishd was her face
 Red were her rolling eyes and discomposd her pace
 Ghastly she gazd with pain she drew her breath
 And nature shiverd at approaching death

 Then swiftly to the fatal place she passd
 And mounts the funral pile with furious haste
 Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind
 Not for so dire an enterprise designd
 But when she viewd the garments loosely spread
 Which once he wore and saw the conscious bed
 She pausd and with a sigh the robes embracd
 Then on the couch her trembling body cast
 Repressd the ready tears and spoke her last
 Dear pledges of my love while Heavn so pleasd
 Receive a soul of mortal anguish easd
 My fatal course is finishd and I go
 A glorious name among the ghosts below
 A lofty city by my hands is raisd
 Pygmalion punishd and my lord appeasd
 What could my fortune have afforded more
 Had the false Trojan never touchd my shore
 Then kissd the couch and Must I die she said
 And unrevengd T is doubly to be dead
 Yet evn this death with pleasure I receive
 On any terms t is better than to live
 These flames from far may the false Trojan view
 These boding omens his base flight pursue

 She said and struck deep enterd in her side
 The piercing steel with reeking purple dyed
 Cloggd in the wound the cruel weapon stands
 The spouting blood came streaming on her hands
 Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke
 And with loud cries the sounding palace shook
 Distracted from the fatal sight they fled
 And thro the town the dismal rumor spread
 First from the frighted court the yell began
 Redoubled thence from house to house it ran
 The groans of men with shrieks laments and cries
 Of mixing women mount the vaulted skies
 Not less the clamor than if ancient Tyre
 Or the new Carthage set by foes on fire
 The rolling ruin with their lovd abodes
 Involvd the blazing temples of their gods

 Her sister hears and furious with despair
 She beats her breast and rends her yellow hair
 And calling on Elizas name aloud
 Runs breathless to the place and breaks the crowd
 Was all that pomp of woe for this prepard
 These fires this funral pile these altars reard
 Was all this train of plots contrivd said she
 All only to deceive unhappy me
 Which is the worst Didst thou in death pretend
 To scorn thy sister or delude thy friend
 Thy summond sister and thy friend had come
 One sword had servd us both one common tomb
 Was I to raise the pile the powrs invoke
 Not to be present at the fatal stroke
 At once thou hast destroyd thyself and me
 Thy town thy senate and thy colony
 Bring water bathe the wound while I in death
 Lay close my lips to hers and catch the flying breath
 This said she mounts the pile with eager haste
 And in her arms the gasping queen embracd
 Her temples chafd and her own garments tore
 To stanch the streaming blood and cleanse the gore
 Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head
 And fainting thrice fell grovling on the bed
 Thrice opd her heavy eyes and sought the light
 But having found it sickend at the sight
 And closd her lids at last in endless night

 Then Juno grieving that she should sustain
 A death so lingring and so full of pain
 Sent Iris down to free her from the strife
 Of labring nature and dissolve her life
 For since she died not doomd by Heavns decree
 Or her own crime but human casualty
 And rage of love that plungd her in despair
 The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair
 Which Proserpine and they can only know
 Nor made her sacred to the shades below
 Downward the various goddess took her flight
 And drew a thousand colors from the light
 Then stood above the dying lovers head
 And said I thus devote thee to the dead
 This offring to th infernal gods I bear
 Thus while she spoke she cut the fatal hair
 The struggling soul was loosd and life dissolvd in air




 BOOK V

 Meantime the Trojan cuts his watry way
 Fixd on his voyage thro the curling sea
 Then casting back his eyes with dire amaze
 Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze
 The cause unknown yet his presaging mind
 The fate of Dido from the fire divind
 He knew the stormy souls of womankind
 What secret springs their eager passions move
 How capable of death for injurd love
 Dire auguries from hence the Trojans draw
 Till neither fires nor shining shores they saw
 Now seas and skies their prospect only bound
 An empty space above a floating field around
 But soon the heavns with shadows were oerspread
 A swelling cloud hung hovring oer their head
 Livid it lookd the threatning of a storm
 Then night and horror oceans face deform
 The pilot Palinurus cried aloud
 What gusts of weather from that gathring cloud
 My thoughts presage Ere yet the tempest roars
 Stand to your tackle mates and stretch your oars
 Contract your swelling sails and luff to wind
 The frighted crew perform the task assignd
 Then to his fearless chief Not Heavn said he
 Tho Jove himself should promise Italy
 Can stem the torrent of this raging sea
 Mark how the shifting winds from west arise
 And what collected night involves the skies
 Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea
 Much less against the tempest force their way
 T is fate diverts our course and fate we must obey
 Not far from hence if I observd aright
 The southing of the stars and polar light
 Sicilia lies whose hospitable shores
 In safety we may reach with struggling oars
 Aeneas then replied Too sure I find
 We strive in vain against the seas and wind
 Now shift your sails what place can please me more
 Than what you promise the Sicilian shore
 Whose hallowd earth Anchises bones contains
 And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns
 The course resolvd before the western wind
 They scud amain and make the port assignd
 Meantime Acestes from a lofty stand
 Beheld the fleet descending on the land
 And not unmindful of his ancient race
 Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace
 And held the hero in a strict embrace
 Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore
 And either hand a pointed javlin bore
 His mother was a dame of Dardan blood
 His sire Crinisus a Sicilian flood
 He welcomes his returning friends ashore
 With plenteous country cates and homely store

 Now when the following morn had chasd away
 The flying stars and light restord the day
 Aeneas calld the Trojan troops around
 And thus bespoke them from a rising ground
 Offspring of heavn divine Dardanian race
 The sun revolving thro th ethereal space
 The shining circle of the year has filld
 Since first this isle my fathers ashes held
 And now the rising day renews the year
 A day for ever sad for ever dear
 This would I celebrate with annual games
 With gifts on altars pild and holy flames
 Tho banishd to Gaetulias barren sands
 Caught on the Grecian seas or hostile lands
 But since this happy storm our fleet has drivn
 Not as I deem without the will of Heavn
 Upon these friendly shores and flowry plains
 Which hide Anchises and his blest remains
 Let us with joy perform his honors due
 And pray for prosprous winds our voyage to renew
 Pray that in towns and temples of our own
 The name of great Anchises may be known
 And yearly games may spread the gods renown
 Our sports Acestes of the Trojan race
 With royal gifts ordaind is pleasd to grace
 Two steers on evry ship the king bestows
 His gods and ours shall share your equal vows
 Besides if nine days hence the rosy morn
 Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn
 That day with solemn sports I mean to grace
 Light galleys on the seas shall run a watry race
 Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend
 And others try the twanging bow to bend
 The strong with iron gauntlets armd shall stand
 Opposd in combat on the yellow sand
 Let all be present at the games prepard
 And joyful victors wait the just reward
 But now assist the rites with garlands crownd
 He said and first his brows with myrtle bound
 Then Helymus by his example led
 And old Acestes each adornd his head
 Thus young Ascanius with a sprightly grace
 His temples tied and all the Trojan race
 Aeneas then advancd amidst the train
 By thousands followd thro the flowry plain
 To great Anchises tomb which when he found
 He pourd to Bacchus on the hallowd ground
 Two bowls of sparkling wine of milk two more
 And two from offerd bulls of purple gore
 With roses then the sepulcher he strowd
 And thus his fathers ghost bespoke aloud
 Hail O ye holy manes hail again
 Paternal ashes now reviewd in vain
 The gods permitted not that you with me
 Should reach the promisd shores of Italy
 Or Tibers flood what flood soeer it be
 Scarce had he finishd when with speckled pride
 A serpent from the tomb began to glide
 His hugy bulk on sevn high volumes rolld
 Blue was his breadth of back but streakd with scaly gold
 Thus riding on his curls he seemd to pass
 A rolling fire along and singe the grass
 More various colors thro his body run
 Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun
 Betwixt the rising altars and around
 The sacred monster shot along the ground
 With harmless play amidst the bowls he passd
 And with his lolling tongue assayd the taste
 Thus fed with holy food the wondrous guest
 Within the hollow tomb retird to rest
 The pious prince surprisd at what he viewd
 The funral honors with more zeal renewd
 Doubtful if this places genius were
 Or guardian of his fathers sepulcher
 Five sheep according to the rites he slew
 As many swine and steers of sable hue
 New genrous wine he from the goblets pourd
 And calld his fathers ghost from hell restord
 The glad attendants in long order come
 Offring their gifts at great Anchises tomb
 Some add more oxen some divide the spoil
 Some place the chargers on the grassy soil
 Some blow the fires and offered entrails broil

 Now came the day desird The skies were bright
 With rosy luster of the rising light
 The bordring people rousd by sounding fame
 Of Trojan feasts and great Acestes name
 The crowded shore with acclamations fill
 Part to behold and part to prove their skill
 And first the gifts in public view they place
 Green laurel wreaths and palm the victors grace
 Within the circle arms and tripods lie
 Ingots of gold and silver heapd on high
 And vests embroiderd of the Tyrian dye
 The trumpets clangor then the feast proclaims
 And all prepare for their appointed games
 Four galleys first which equal rowers bear
 Advancing in the watry lists appear
 The speedy Dolphin that outstrips the wind
 Bore Mnestheus author of the Memmian kind
 Gyas the vast Chimaeras bulk commands
 Which rising like a towring city stands
 Three Trojans tug at evry labring oar
 Three banks in three degrees the sailors bore
 Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar
 Sergesthus who began the Sergian race
 In the great Centaur took the leading place
 Cloanthus on the seagreen Scylla stood
 From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood

 Far in the sea against the foaming shore
 There stands a rock the raging billows roar
 Above his head in storms but when t is clear
 Uncurl their ridgy backs and at his foot appear
 In peace below the gentle waters run
 The cormorants above lie basking in the sun
 On this the hero fixd an oak in sight
 The mark to guide the mariners aright
 To bear with this the seamen stretch their oars
 Then round the rock they steer and seek the former shores
 The lots decide their place Above the rest
 Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest
 The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs
 Their temples crown and shade their sweaty brows
 Besmeard with oil their naked shoulders shine
 All take their seats and wait the sounding sign
 They gripe their oars and evry panting breast
 Is raisd by turns with hope by turns with fear depressd
 The clangor of the trumpet gives the sign
 At once they start advancing in a line
 With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies
 Lashd with their oars the smoky billows rise
 Sparkles the briny main and the vexd ocean fries
 Exact in time with equal strokes they row
 At once the brushing oars and brazen prow
 Dash up the sandy waves and ope the depths below
 Not fiery coursers in a chariot race
 Invade the field with half so swift a pace
 Not the fierce driver with more fury lends
 The sounding lash and ere the stroke descends
 Low to the wheels his pliant body bends
 The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide
 And aid with eager shouts the favord side
 Cries murmurs clamors with a mixing sound
 From woods to woods from hills to hills rebound

 Amidst the loud applauses of the shore
 Gyas outstrippd the rest and sprung before
 Cloanthus better mannd pursued him fast
 But his oermasted galley checkd his haste
 The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine
 With equal oars advancing in a line
 And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead
 And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead
 Now board to board the rival vessels row
 The billows lave the skies and ocean groans below
 They reachd the mark Proud Gyas and his train
 In triumph rode the victors of the main
 But steering round he chargd his pilot stand
 More close to shore and skim along the sand
 Let others bear to sea Menoetes heard
 But secret shelves too cautiously he feard
 And fearing sought the deep and still aloof he steerd
 With louder cries the captain calld again
 Bear to the rocky shore and shun the main
 He spoke and speaking at his stern he saw
 The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw
 Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood
 And in a closer compass plowd the flood
 He passd the mark and wheeling got before
 Gyas blasphemd the gods devoutly swore
 Cried out for anger and his hair he tore
 Mindless of others lives so high was grown
 His rising rage and careless of his own
 The trembling dotard to the deck he drew
 Then hoisted up and overboard he threw
 This done he seizd the helm his fellows cheerd
 Turnd short upon the shelfs and madly steerd

 Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears
 Cloggd with his clothes and cumberd with his years
 Now dropping wet he climbs the cliff with pain
 The crowd that saw him fall and float again
 Shout from the distant shore and loudly laughd
 To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught
 The following Centaur and the Dolphins crew
 Their vanishd hopes of victory renew
 While Gyas lags they kindle in the race
 To reach the mark Sergesthus takes the place
 Mnestheus pursues and while around they wind
 Comes up not half his galleys length behind
 Then on the deck amidst his mates appeard
 And thus their drooping courage he cheerd
 My friends and Hectors followers heretofore
 Exert your vigor tug the labring oar
 Stretch to your strokes my still unconquerd crew
 Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew
 In this our common intrest let me find
 That strength of hand that courage of the mind
 As when you stemmd the strong Malean flood
 And oer the Syrtes broken billows rowd
 I seek not now the foremost palm to gain
 Tho yet but ah that haughty wish is vain
 Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain
 But to be last the lags of all the race
 Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace
 Now one and all they tug amain they row
 At the full stretch and shake the brazen prow
 The sea beneath em sinks their labring sides
 Are swelld and sweat runs guttring down in tides
 Chance aids their daring with unhopd success
 Sergesthus eager with his beak to press
 Betwixt the rival galley and the rock
 Shuts up th unwieldly Centaur in the lock
 The vessel struck and with the dreadful shock
 Her oars she shiverd and her head she broke
 The trembling rowers from their banks arise
 And anxious for themselves renounce the prize
 With iron poles they heave her off the shores
 And gather from the sea their floating oars
 The crew of Mnestheus with elated minds
 Urge their success and call the willing winds
 Then ply their oars and cut their liquid way
 In larger compass on the roomy sea
 As when the dove her rocky hold forsakes
 Rousd in a fright her sounding wings she shakes
 The cavern rings with clattring out she flies
 And leaves her callow care and cleaves the skies
 At first she flutters but at length she springs
 To smoother flight and shoots upon her wings
 So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea
 And flying with a force that force assists his way
 Sergesthus in the Centaur soon he passd
 Wedgd in the rocky shoals and sticking fast
 In vain the victor he with cries implores
 And practices to row with shatterd oars
 Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas and outflies
 The ship without a pilot yields the prize
 Unvanquishd Scylla now alone remains
 Her he pursues and all his vigor strains
 Shouts from the favring multitude arise
 Applauding Echo to the shouts replies
 Shouts wishes and applause run rattling thro the skies
 These clamors with disdain the Scylla heard
 Much grudgd the praise but more the robbd reward
 Resolvd to hold their own they mend their pace
 All obstinate to die or gain the race
 Raisd with success the Dolphin swiftly ran
 For they can conquer who believe they can
 Both urge their oars and fortune both supplies
 And both perhaps had shard an equal prize
 When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands
 And succor from the watry powrs demands
 Gods of the liquid realms on which I row
 If givn by you the laurel bind my brow
 Assist to make me guilty of my vow
 A snowwhite bull shall on your shore be slain
 His offerd entrails cast into the main
 And ruddy wine from golden goblets thrown
 Your grateful gift and my return shall own
 The choir of nymphs and Phorcus from below
 With virgin Panopea heard his vow
 And old Portunus with his breadth of hand
 Pushd on and sped the galley to the land
 Swift as a shaft or winged wind she flies
 And darting to the port obtains the prize

 The herald summons all and then proclaims
 Cloanthus conquror of the naval games
 The prince with laurel crowns the victors head
 And three fat steers are to his vessel led
 The ships reward with genrous wine beside
 And sums of silver which the crew divide
 The leaders are distinguishd from the rest
 The victor honord with a nobler vest
 Where gold and purple strive in equal rows
 And needlework its happy cost bestows
 There Ganymede is wrought with living art
 Chasing thro Idas groves the trembling hart
 Breathless he seems yet eager to pursue
 When from aloft descends in open view
 The bird of Jove and sousing on his prey
 With crooked talons bears the boy away
 In vain with lifted hands and gazing eyes
 His guards behold him soaring thro the skies
 And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries

 Mnestheus the second victor was declard
 And summond there the second prize he shard
 A coat of mail brave Demoleus bore
 More brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore
 In single combat on the Trojan shore
 This was ordaind for Mnestheus to possess
 In war for his defense for ornament in peace
 Rich was the gift and glorious to behold
 But yet so pondrous with its plates of gold
 That scarce two servants could the weight sustain
 Yet loaded thus Demoleus oer the plain
 Pursued and lightly seizd the Trojan train
 The third succeeding to the last reward
 Two goodly bowls of massy silver shard
 With figures prominent and richly wrought
 And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought

 Thus all rewarded by the heros hands
 Their conquring temples bound with purple bands
 And now Sergesthus clearing from the rock
 Brought back his galley shatterd with the shock
 Forlorn she lookd without an aiding oar
 And houted by the vulgar made to shore
 As when a snake surprisd upon the road
 Is crushd athwart her body by the load
 Of heavy wheels or with a mortal wound
 Her belly bruisd and trodden to the ground
 In vain with loosend curls she crawls along
 Yet fierce above she brandishes her tongue
 Glares with her eyes and bristles with her scales
 But groveling in the dust her parts unsound she trails
 So slowly to the port the Centaur tends
 But what she wants in oars with sails amends
 Yet for his galley savd the grateful prince
 Is pleasd th unhappy chief to recompense
 Pholoe the Cretan slave rewards his care
 Beauteous herself with lovely twins as fair

 From thence his way the Trojan hero bent
 Into the neighbring plain with mountains pent
 Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood
 Full in the midst of this fair valley stood
 A native theater which rising slow
 By just degrees oerlookd the ground below
 High on a sylvan throne the leader sate
 A numrous train attend in solemn state
 Here those that in the rapid course delight
 Desire of honor and the prize invite
 The rival runners without order stand
 The Trojans mixd with the Sicilian band
 First Nisus with Euryalus appears
 Euryalus a boy of blooming years
 With sprightly grace and equal beauty crownd
 Nisus for friendship to the youth renownd
 Diores next of Priams royal race
 Then Salius joined with Patron took their place
 But Patron in Arcadia had his birth
 And Salius his from Arcananian earth
 Then two Sicilian youths the names of these
 Swift Helymus and lovely Panopes
 Both jolly huntsmen both in forest bred
 And owning old Acestes for their head
 With sevral others of ignobler name
 Whom time has not deliverd oer to fame

 To these the hero thus his thoughts explaind
 In words which genral approbation gaind
 One common largess is for all designd
 The vanquishd and the victor shall be joind
 Two darts of polishd steel and Gnosian wood
 A silverstudded ax alike bestowd
 The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed
 The first of these obtains a stately steed
 Adornd with trappings and the next in fame
 The quiver of an Amazonian dame
 With featherd Thracian arrows well supplied
 A golden belt shall gird his manly side
 Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied
 The third this Grecian helmet shall content
 He said To their appointed base they went
 With beating hearts th expected sign receive
 And starting all at once the barrier leave
 Spread out as on the winged winds they flew
 And seizd the distant goal with greedy view
 Shot from the crowd swift Nisus all oerpassd
 Nor storms nor thunder equal half his haste
 The next but tho the next yet far disjoind
 Came Salius and Euryalus behind
 Then Helymus whom young Diores plied
 Step after step and almost side by side
 His shoulders pressing and in longer space
 Had won or left at least a dubious race

 Now spent the goal they almost reach at last
 When eager Nisus hapless in his haste
 Slippd first and slipping fell upon the plain
 Soakd with the blood of oxen newly slain
 The careless victor had not markd his way
 But treading where the treachrous puddle lay
 His heels flew up and on the grassy floor
 He fell besmeard with filth and holy gore
 Not mindless then Euryalus of thee
 Nor of the sacred bonds of amity
 He strove th immediate rivals hope to cross
 And caught the foot of Salius as he rose
 So Salius lay extended on the plain
 Euryalus springs out the prize to gain
 And leaves the crowd applauding peals attend
 The victor to the goal who vanquishd by his friend
 Next Helymus and then Diores came
 By two misfortunes made the third in fame

 But Salius enters and exclaiming loud
 For justice deafens and disturbs the crowd
 Urges his cause may in the court be heard
 And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferrd
 But favor for Euryalus appears
 His blooming beauty with his tender tears
 Had bribd the judges for the promisd prize
 Besides Diores fills the court with cries
 Who vainly reaches at the last reward
 If the first palm on Salius be conferrd
 Then thus the prince Let no disputes arise
 Where fortune placd it I award the prize
 But fortunes errors give me leave to mend
 At least to pity my deserving friend
 He said and from among the spoils he draws
 Pondrous with shaggy mane and golden paws
 A lions hide to Salius this he gives
 Nisus with envy sees the gift and grieves
 If such rewards to vanquishd men are due
 He said and falling is to rise by you
 What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim
 Who merited the first rewards and fame
 In falling both an equal fortune tried
 Would fortune for my fall so well provide
 With this he pointed to his face and showd
 His hand and all his habit smeard with blood
 Th indulgent father of the people smild
 And causd to be producd an ample shield
 Of wondrous art by Didymaon wrought
 Long since from Neptunes bars in triumph brought
 This givn to Nisus he divides the rest
 And equal justice in his gifts expressd

 The race thus ended and rewards bestowd
 Once more the prince bespeaks th attentive crowd
 If there he here whose dauntless courage dare
 In gauntletfight with limbs and body bare
 His opposite sustain in open view
 Stand forth the champion and the games renew
 Two prizes I propose and thus divide
 A bull with gilded horns and fillets tied
 Shall be the portion of the conquring chief
 A sword and helm shall cheer the losers grief

 Then haughty Dares in the lists appears
 Stalking he strides his head erected bears
 His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield
 And loud applauses echo thro the field
 Dares alone in combat usd to stand
 The match of mighty Paris hand to hand
 The same at Hectors funrals undertook
 Gigantic Butes of th Amycian stock
 And by the stroke of his resistless hand
 Stretchd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand
 Such Dares was and such he strode along
 And drew the wonder of the gazing throng
 His brawny back and ample breast he shows
 His lifted arms around his head he throws
 And deals in whistling air his empty blows
 His match is sought but thro the trembling band
 Not one dares answer to the proud demand
 Presuming of his force with sparkling eyes
 Already he devours the promisd prize
 He claims the bull with awless insolence
 And having seizd his horns accosts the prince
 If none my matchless valor dares oppose
 How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes
 Permit me chief permit without delay
 To lead this uncontended gift away
 The crowd assents and with redoubled cries
 For the proud challenger demands the prize

 Acestes fird with just disdain to see
 The palm usurpd without a victory
 Reproachd Entellus thus who sate beside
 And heard and saw unmovd the Trojans pride
 Once but in vain a champion of renown
 So tamely can you bear the ravishd crown
 A prize in triumph borne before your sight
 And shun for fear the danger of the fight
 Where is our Eryx now the boasted name
 The god who taught your thundring arm the game
 Where now your baffled honor Where the spoil
 That filld your house and fame that filld our isle
 Entellus thus My soul is still the same
 Unmovd with fear and movd with martial fame
 But my chill blood is curdled in my veins
 And scarce the shadow of a man remains
 O could I turn to that fair prime again
 That prime of which this boaster is so vain
 The brave who this decrepid age defies
 Should feel my force without the promisd prize

 He said and rising at the word he threw
 Two pondrous gauntlets down in open view
 Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield
 And sheathe his hands with in the listed field
 With fear and wonder seizd the crowd beholds
 The gloves of death with sevn distinguishd folds
 Of tough bull hides the space within is spread
 With iron or with loads of heavy lead
 Dares himself was daunted at the sight
 Renouncd his challenge and refusd to fight
 Astonishd at their weight the hero stands
 And poisd the pondrous engines in his hands
 What had your wonder said Entellus been
 Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen
 Or viewd the stern debate on this unhappy green
 These which I bear your brother Eryx bore
 Still markd with batterd brains and mingled gore
 With these he long sustaind th Herculean arm
 And these I wielded while my blood was warm
 This languishd frame while better spirits fed
 Ere age unstrung my nerves or time oersnowd my head
 But if the challenger these arms refuse
 And cannot wield their weight or dare not use
 If great Aeneas and Acestes join
 In his request these gauntlets I resign
 Let us with equal arms perform the fight
 And let him leave to fear since I resign my right

 This said Entellus for the strife prepares
 Strippd of his quilted coat his body bares
 Composd of mighty bones and brawn he stands
 A goodly towring object on the sands
 Then just Aeneas equal arms supplied
 Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied
 Both on the tiptoe stand at full extent
 Their arms aloft their bodies inly bent
 Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar
 With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war
 One on his youth and pliant limbs relies
 One on his sinews and his giant size
 The last is stiff with age his motion slow
 He heaves for breath he staggers to and fro
 And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow
 Yet equal in success they ward they strike
 Their ways are diffrent but their art alike
 Before behind the blows are dealt around
 Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound
 A storm of strokes well meant with fury flies
 And errs about their temples ears and eyes
 Nor always errs for oft the gauntlet draws
 A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws
 Heavy with age Entellus stands his ground
 But with his warping body wards the wound
 His hand and watchful eye keep even pace
 While Dares traverses and shifts his place
 And like a captain who beleaguers round
 Some strongbuilt castle on a rising ground
 Views all th approaches with observing eyes
 This and that other part in vain he tries
 And more on industry than force relies
 With hands on high Entellus threats the foe
 But Dares watchd the motion from below
 And slippd aside and shunnd the long descending blow
 Entellus wastes his forces on the wind
 And thus deluded of the stroke designd
 Headlong and heavy fell his ample breast
 And weighty limbs his ancient mother pressd
 So falls a hollow pine that long had stood
 On Idas height or Erymanthus wood
 Torn from the roots The diffring nations rise
 And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies
 Acestus runs with eager haste to raise
 The falln companion of his youthful days
 Dauntless he rose and to the fight returnd
 With shame his glowing cheeks his eyes with fury burnd
 Disdain and conscious virtue fird his breast
 And with redoubled force his foe he pressd
 He lays on load with either hand amain
 And headlong drives the Trojan oer the plain
 Nor stops nor stays nor rest nor breath allows
 But storms of strokes descend about his brows
 A rattling tempest and a hail of blows
 But now the prince who saw the wild increase
 Of wounds commands the combatants to cease
 And bounds Entellus wrath and bids the peace
 First to the Trojan spent with toil he came
 And soothd his sorrow for the sufferd shame
 What fury seizd my friend The gods said he
 To him propitious and averse to thee
 Have givn his arm superior force to thine
 T is madness to contend with strength divine
 The gauntlet fight thus ended from the shore
 His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore
 His mouth and nostrils pourd a purple flood
 And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood
 Faintly he staggerd thro the hissing throng
 And hung his head and traild his legs along
 The sword and casque are carried by his train
 But with his foe the palm and ox remain

 The champion then before Aeneas came
 Proud of his prize but prouder of his fame
 O goddessborn and you Dardanian host
 Mark with attention and forgive my boast
 Learn what I was by what remains and know
 From what impending fate you savd my foe
 Sternly he spoke and then confronts the bull
 And on his ample forehead aiming full
 The deadly stroke descending piercd the skull
 Down drops the beast nor needs a second wound
 But sprawls in pangs of death and spurns the ground
 Then thus In Dares stead I offer this
 Eryx accept a nobler sacrifice
 Take the last gift my witherd arms can yield
 Thy gauntlets I resign and here renounce the field

 This done Aeneas orders for the close
 The strife of archers with contending bows
 The mast Sergesthus shatterd galley bore
 With his own hands he raises on the shore
 A fluttring dove upon the top they tie
 The living mark at which their arrows fly
 The rival archers in a line advance
 Their turn of shooting to receive from chance
 A helmet holds their names the lots are drawn
 On the first scroll was read Hippocoon
 The people shout Upon the next was found
 Young Mnestheus late with naval honors crownd
 The third containd Eurytions noble name
 Thy brother Pandarus and next in fame
 Whom Pallas urgd the treaty to confound
 And send among the Greeks a featherd wound
 Acestes in the bottom last remaind
 Whom not his age from youthful sports restraind
 Soon all with vigor bend their trusty bows
 And from the quiver each his arrow chose
 Hippocoons was the first with forceful sway
 It flew and whizzing cut the liquid way
 Fixd in the mast the featherd weapon stands
 The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands
 And the tree trembled and the shouting cries
 Of the pleasd people rend the vaulted skies
 Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove
 With lifted eyes and took his aim above
 But made a glancing shot and missed the dove
 Yet missd so narrow that he cut the cord
 Which fastend by the foot the flitting bird
 The captive thus releasd away she flies
 And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies
 His bow already bent Eurytion stood
 And having first invokd his brother god
 His winged shaft with eager haste he sped
 The fatal message reachd her as she fled
 She leaves her life aloft she strikes the ground
 And renders back the weapon in the wound
 Acestes grudging at his lot remains
 Without a prize to gratify his pains
 Yet shooting upward sends his shaft to show
 An archers art and boast his twanging bow
 The featherd arrow gave a dire portent
 And latter augurs judge from this event
 Chafd by the speed it fird and as it flew
 A trail of following flames ascending drew
 Kindling they mount and mark the shiny way
 Across the skies as falling meteors play
 And vanish into wind or in a blaze decay
 The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare
 And trembling turn their wonder into prayr
 The Dardan prince put on a smiling face
 And straind Acestes with a close embrace
 Then honring him with gifts above the rest
 Turnd the bad omen nor his fears confessd
 The gods said he this miracle have wrought
 And orderd you the prize without the lot
 Accept this goblet rough with figurd gold
 Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old
 This pledge of ancient amity receive
 Which to my second sire I justly give
 He said and with the trumpets cheerful sound
 Proclaimd him victor and with laurelcrownd
 Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize
 Tho he transfixd the pigeon in the skies
 Who cut the line with second gifts was gracd
 The third was his whose arrow piercd the mast

 The chief before the games were wholly done
 Calld Periphantes tutor to his son
 And whisperd thus With speed Ascanius find
 And if his childish troop be ready joind
 On horseback let him grace his grandsires day
 And lead his equals armd in just array
 He said and calling out the cirque he clears
 The crowd withdrawn an open plain appears
 And now the noble youths of form divine
 Advance before their fathers in a line
 The riders grace the steeds the steeds with glory shine

 Thus marching on in military pride
 Shouts of applause resound from side to side
 Their casques adornd with laurel wreaths they wear
 Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear
 Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore
 Their chains of burnishd gold hung down before
 Three graceful troops they formd upon the green
 Three graceful leaders at their head were seen
 Twelve followd evry chief and left a space between
 The first young Priam led a lovely boy
 Whose grandsire was th unhappy king of Troy
 His race in after times was known to fame
 New honors adding to the Latian name
 And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became
 White were the fetlocks of his feet before
 And on his front a snowy star he bore
 Then beauteous Atys with Iulus bred
 Of equal age the second squadron led
 The last in order but the first in place
 First in the lovely features of his face
 Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed
 Queen Didos gift and of the Tyrian breed
 Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains
 With golden bits adornd and purple reins

 The pleasd spectators peals of shouts renew
 And all the parents in the children view
 Their make their motions and their sprightly grace
 And hopes and fears alternate in their face

 Th unfledgd commanders and their martial train
 First make the circuit of the sandy plain
 Around their sires and at th appointed sign
 Drawn up in beauteous order form a line
 The second signal sounds the troop divides
 In three distinguishd parts with three distinguishd guides
 Again they close and once again disjoin
 In troop to troop opposd and line to line
 They meet they wheel they throw their darts afar
 With harmless rage and welldissembled war
 Then in a round the mingled bodies run
 Flying they follow and pursuing shun
 Broken they break and rallying they renew
 In other forms the military shew
 At last in order undiscernd they join
 And march together in a friendly line
 And as the Cretan labyrinth of old
 With wandring ways and many a winding fold
 Involvd the weary feet without redress
 In a round error which denied recess
 So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play
 Turnd and returnd and still a diffrent way
 Thus dolphins in the deep each other chase
 In circles when they swim around the watry race
 This game these carousels Ascanius taught
 And building Alba to the Latins brought
 Shewd what he learnd the Latin sires impart
 To their succeeding sons the graceful art
 From these imperial Rome receivd the game
 Which Troy the youths the Trojan troop they name

 Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate
 But Fortune soon resumd her ancient hate
 For while they pay the dead his annual dues
 Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views
 And sends the goddess of the various bow
 To try new methods of revenge below
 Supplies the winds to wing her airy way
 Where in the port secure the navy lay
 Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends
 And undiscernd her fatal voyage ends
 She saw the gathring crowd and gliding thence
 The desart shore and fleet without defense
 The Trojan matrons on the sands alone
 With sighs and tears Anchises death bemoan
 Then turning to the sea their weeping eyes
 Their pity to themselves renews their cries
 Alas said one what oceans yet remain
 For us to sail what labors to sustain
 All take the word and with a genral groan
 Implore the gods for peace and places of their own

 The goddess great in mischief views their pains
 And in a womans form her heavnly limbs restrains
 In face and shape old Beroe she became
 Doryclus wife a venerable dame
 Once blest with riches and a mothers name
 Thus changd amidst the crying crowd she ran
 Mixd with the matrons and these words began
 O wretched we whom not the Grecian powr
 Nor flames destroyd in Troys unhappy hour
 O wretched we reservd by cruel fate
 Beyond the ruins of the sinking state
 Now sevn revolving years are wholly run
 Since this improsprous voyage we begun
 Since tossd from shores to shores from lands to lands
 Inhospitable rocks and barren sands
 Wandring in exile thro the stormy sea
 We search in vain for flying Italy
 Now cast by fortune on this kindred land
 What should our rest and rising walls withstand
 Or hinder here to fix our banishd band
 O country lost and gods redeemd in vain
 If still in endless exile we remain
 Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew
 Or streams of some dissembled Simois view
 Haste join with me th unhappy fleet consume
 Cassandra bids and I declare her doom
 In sleep I saw her she supplied my hands
 For this I more than dreamt with flaming brands
 With these said she these wandring ships destroy
 These are your fatal seats and this your Troy
 Time calls you now the precious hour employ
 Slack not the good presage while Heavn inspires
 Our minds to dare and gives the ready fires
 See Neptunes altars minister their brands
 The god is pleasd the god supplies our hands
 Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew
 And tossd in air amidst the galleys threw

 Wrappd in amaze the matrons wildly stare
 Then Pyrgo reverencd for her hoary hair
 Pyrgo the nurse of Priams numrous race
 No Beroe this tho she belies her face
 What terrors from her frowning front arise
 Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes
 What rays around her heavnly face are seen
 Mark her majestic voice and more than mortal mien
 Beroe but now I left whom pind with pain
 Her age and anguish from these rites detain
 She said The matrons seizd with new amaze
 Roll their malignant eyes and on the navy gaze
 They fear and hope and neither part obey
 They hope the fated land but fear the fatal way
 The goddess having done her task below
 Mounts up on equal wings and bends her painted bow
 Struck with the sight and seizd with rage divine
 The matrons prosecute their mad design
 They shriek aloud they snatch with impious hands
 The food of altars fires and flaming brands
 Green boughs and saplings mingled in their haste
 And smoking torches on the ships they cast
 The flame unstoppd at first more fury gains
 And Vulcan rides at large with loosend reins
 Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars
 And seizes in this way the banks and crackling oars
 Eumelus was the first the news to bear
 While yet they crowd the rural theater
 Then what they hear is witnessd by their eyes
 A storm of sparkles and of flames arise
 Ascanius took th alarm while yet he led
 His early warriors on his prancing steed
 And spurring on his equals soon oerpassd
 Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste
 Soon as the royal youth appeard in view
 He sent his voice before him as he flew
 What madness moves you matrons to destroy
 The last remainders of unhappy Troy
 Not hostile fleets but your own hopes you burn
 And on your friends your fatal fury turn
 Behold your own Ascanius While he said
 He drew his glittring helmet from his head
 In which the youths to sportful arms he led
 By this Aeneas and his train appear
 And now the women seizd with shame and fear
 Dispersd to woods and caverns take their flight
 Abhor their actions and avoid the light
 Their friends acknowledge and their error find
 And shake the goddess from their alterd mind

 Not so the raging fires their fury cease
 But lurking in the seams with seeming peace
 Work on their way amid the smoldring tow
 Sure in destruction but in motion slow
 The silent plague thro the green timber eats
 And vomits out a tardy flame by fits
 Down to the keels and upward to the sails
 The fire descends or mounts but still prevails
 Nor buckets pourd nor strength of human hand
 Can the victorious element withstand

 The pious hero rends his robe and throws
 To heavn his hands and with his hands his vows
 O Jove he cried if prayrs can yet have place
 If thou abhorrst not all the Dardan race
 If any spark of pity still remain
 If gods are gods and not invokd in vain
 Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train
 Yet from the flames our burning vessels free
 Or let thy fury fall alone on me
 At this devoted head thy thunder throw
 And send the willing sacrifice below

 Scarce had he said when southern storms arise
 From pole to pole the forky lightning flies
 Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain
 Heavn bellies downward and descends in rain
 Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent
 Which hissing thro the planks the flames prevent
 And stop the fiery pest Four ships alone
 Burn to the waist and for the fleet atone

 But doubtful thoughts the heros heart divide
 If he should still in Sicily reside
 Forgetful of his fates or tempt the main
 In hope the promisd Italy to gain
 Then Nautes old and wise to whom alone
 The will of Heavn by Pallas was foreshown
 Versd in portents experiencd and inspird
 To tell events and what the fates requird
 Thus while he stood to neither part inclind
 With cheerful words relievd his labring mind
 O goddessborn resignd in evry state
 With patience bear with prudence push your fate
 By suffring well our Fortune we subdue
 Fly when she frowns and when she calls pursue
 Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind
 To him disclose the secrets of your mind
 Trust in his hands your old and useless train
 Too numrous for the ships which yet remain
 The feeble old indulgent of their ease
 The dames who dread the dangers of the seas
 With all the dastard crew who dare not stand
 The shock of battle with your foes by land
 Here you may build a common town for all
 And from Acestes name Acesta call
 The reasons with his friends experience joind
 Encouragd much but more disturbd his mind

 T was dead of night when to his slumbring eyes
 His fathers shade descended from the skies
 And thus he spoke O more than vital breath
 Lovd while I livd and dear evn after death
 O son in various toils and troubles tossd
 The King of Heavn employs my careful ghost
 On his commands the god who savd from fire
 Your flaming fleet and heard your just desire
 The wholesome counsel of your friend receive
 And here the coward train and woman leave
 The chosen youth and those who nobly dare
 Transport to tempt the dangers of the war
 The stern Italians will their courage try
 Rough are their manners and their minds are high
 But first to Plutos palace you shall go
 And seek my shade among the blest below
 For not with impious ghosts my soul remains
 Nor suffers with the damnd perpetual pains
 But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains
 The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey
 And blood of offerd victims free the way
 There shall you know what realms the gods assign
 And learn the fates and fortunes of your line
 But now farewell I vanish with the night
 And feel the blast of heavns approaching light
 He said and mixd with shades and took his airy flight
 Whither so fast the filial duty cried
 And why ah why the wishd embrace denied

 He said and rose as holy zeal inspires
 He rakes hot embers and renews the fires
 His country gods and Vesta then adores
 With cakes and incense and their aid implores
 Next for his friends and royal host he sent
 Reveald his vision and the gods intent
 With his own purpose All without delay
 The will of Jove and his desires obey
 They list with women each degenerate name
 Who dares not hazard life for future fame
 These they cashier the brave remaining few
 Oars banks and cables half consumd renew
 The prince designs a city with the plow
 The lots their sevral tenements allow
 This part is namd from Ilium that from Troy
 And the new king ascends the throne with joy
 A chosen senate from the people draws
 Appoints the judges and ordains the laws
 Then on the top of Eryx they begin
 A rising temple to the Paphian queen
 Anchises last is honord as a god
 A priest is added annual gifts bestowd
 And groves are planted round his blest abode
 Nine days they pass in feasts their temples crownd
 And fumes of incense in the fanes abound
 Then from the south arose a gentle breeze
 That curld the smoothness of the glassy seas
 The rising winds a ruffling gale afford
 And call the merry mariners aboard

 Now loud laments along the shores resound
 Of parting friends in close embraces bound
 The trembling women the degenerate train
 Who shunnd the frightful dangers of the main
 Evn those desire to sail and take their share
 Of the rough passage and the promisd war
 Whom good Aeneas cheers and recommends
 To their new masters care his fearful friends
 On Eryxs altars three fat calves he lays
 A lamb newfallen to the stormy seas
 Then slips his haulsers and his anchors weighs
 High on the deck the godlike hero stands
 With olive crownd a charger in his hands
 Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine
 And pourd the sacrifice of purple wine
 Fresh gales arise with equal strokes they vie
 And brush the buxom seas and oer the billows fly

 Meantime the mother goddess full of fears
 To Neptune thus addressd with tender tears
 The pride of Joves imperious queen the rage
 The malice which no suffrings can assuage
 Compel me to these prayrs since neither fate
 Nor time nor pity can remove her hate
 Evn Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife
 Still vanquishd yet she still renews the strife
 As if t were little to consume the town
 Which awd the world and wore th imperial crown
 She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains
 And gnaws evn to the bones the last remains
 Let her the causes of her hatred tell
 But you can witness its effects too well
 You saw the storm she raisd on Libyan floods
 That mixd the mounting billows with the clouds
 When bribing Aeolus she shook the main
 And movd rebellion in your watry reign
 With fury she possessd the Dardan dames
 To burn their fleet with execrable flames
 And forcd Aeneas when his ships were lost
 To leave his follwers on a foreign coast
 For what remains your godhead I implore
 And trust my son to your protecting powr
 If neither Joves nor Fates decree withstand
 Secure his passage to the Latian land

 Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main
 What may not Venus hope from Neptunes reign
 My kingdom claims your birth my late defense
 Of your indangerd fleet may claim your confidence
 Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare
 How much your lovd Aeneas is my care
 Thee Xanthus and thee Simois I attest
 Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles pressd
 And drove before him headlong on the plain
 And dashd against the walls the trembling train
 When floods were filld with bodies of the slain
 When crimson Xanthus doubtful of his way
 Stood up on ridges to behold the sea
 New heaps came tumbling in and chokd his way
 When your Aeneas fought but fought with odds
 Of force unequal and unequal gods
 I spread a cloud before the victors sight
 Sustaind the vanquishd and securd his flight
 Evn then securd him when I sought with joy
 The vowd destruction of ungrateful Troy
 My wills the same fair goddess fear no more
 Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore
 Their lives are givn one destind head alone
 Shall perish and for multitudes atone
 Thus having armd with hopes her anxious mind
 His finny team Saturnian Neptune joind
 Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws
 And to the loosend reins permits the laws
 High on the waves his azure car he guides
 Its axles thunder and the sea subsides
 And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides
 The tempests fly before their fathers face
 Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace
 And monster whales before their master play
 And choirs of Tritons crowd the watry way
 The marshald powrs in equal troops divide
 To right and left the gods his better side
 Inclose and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride

 Now smiling hope with sweet vicissitude
 Within the heros mind his joys renewd
 He calls to raise the masts the sheets display
 The cheerful crew with diligence obey
 They scud before the wind and sail in open sea
 Ahead of all the master pilot steers
 And as he leads the following navy veers
 The steeds of Night had traveld half the sky
 The drowsy rowers on their benches lie
 When the soft God of Sleep with easy flight
 Descends and draws behind a trail of light
 Thou Palinurus art his destind prey
 To thee alone he takes his fatal way
 Dire dreams to thee and iron sleep he bears
 And lighting on thy prow the form of Phorbas wears
 Then thus the traitor god began his tale
 The winds my friend inspire a pleasing gale
 The ships without thy care securely sail
 Now steal an hour of sweet repose and I
 Will take the rudder and thy room supply
 To whom the yawning pilot half asleep
 Me dost thou bid to trust the treachrous deep
 The harlot smiles of her dissembling face
 And to her faith commit the Trojan race
 Shall I believe the Siren South again
 And oft betrayd not know the monster main
 He said his fastend hands the rudder keep
 And fixd on heavn his eyes repel invading sleep
 The god was wroth and at his temples threw
 A branch in Lethe dippd and drunk with Stygian dew
 The pilot vanquishd by the powr divine
 Soon closd his swimming eyes and lay supine
 Scarce were his limbs extended at their length
 The god insulting with superior strength
 Fell heavy on him plungd him in the sea
 And with the stern the rudder tore away
 Headlong he fell and struggling in the main
 Cried out for helping hands but cried in vain
 The victor daemon mounts obscure in air
 While the ship sails without the pilots care
 On Neptunes faith the floating fleet relies
 But what the man forsook the god supplies
 And oer the dangrous deep secure the navy flies
 Glides by the Sirens cliffs a shelfy coast
 Long infamous for ships and sailors lost
 And white with bones Th impetuous ocean roars
 And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores
 The watchful hero felt the knocks and found
 The tossing vessel saild on shoaly ground
 Sure of his pilots loss he takes himself
 The helm and steers aloof and shuns the shelf
 Inly he grievd and groaning from the breast
 Deplord his death and thus his pain expressd
 For faith reposd on seas and on the flattring sky
 Thy naked corpse is doomd on shores unknown to lie




 BOOK VI

 He said and wept then spread his sails before
 The winds and reachd at length the Cumaean shore
 Their anchors droppd his crew the vessels moor
 They turn their heads to sea their sterns to land
 And greet with greedy joy th Italian strand
 Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed
 Some gather sticks the kindled flames to feed
 Or search for hollow trees and fell the woods
 Or trace thro valleys the discoverd floods
 Thus while their sevral charges they fulfil
 The pious prince ascends the sacred hill
 Where Phoebus is adord and seeks the shade
 Which hides from sight his venerable maid
 Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode
 Thence full of fate returns and of the god
 Thro Trivias grove they walk and now behold
 And enter now the temple roofd with gold
 When Daedalus to fly the Cretan shore
 His heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore
 The first who saild in air t is sung by Fame
 To the Cumaean coast at length he came
 And here alighting built this costly frame
 Inscribd to Phoebus here he hung on high
 The steerage of his wings that cut the sky
 Then oer the lofty gate his art embossd
 Androgeos death and offrings to his ghost
 Sevn youths from Athens yearly sent to meet
 The fate appointed by revengeful Crete
 And next to those the dreadful urn was placd
 In which the destind names by lots were cast
 The mournful parents stand around in tears
 And rising Crete against their shore appears
 There too in living sculpture might be seen
 The mad affection of the Cretan queen
 Then how she cheats her bellowing lovers eye
 The rushing leap the doubtful progeny
 The lower part a beast a man above
 The monument of their polluted love
 Not far from thence he gravd the wondrous maze
 A thousand doors a thousand winding ways
 Here dwells the monster hid from human view
 Not to be found but by the faithful clew
 Till the kind artist movd with pious grief
 Lent to the loving maid this last relief
 And all those erring paths describd so well
 That Theseus conquerd and the monster fell
 Here hapless Icarus had found his part
 Had not the fathers grief restraind his art
 He twice assayd to cast his son in gold
 Twice from his hands he droppd the forming mold

 All this with wondring eyes Aeneas viewd
 Each varying object his delight renewd
 Eager to read the rest Achates came
 And by his side the mad divining dame
 The priestess of the god Deiphobe her name
 Time suffers not she said to feed your eyes
 With empty pleasures haste the sacrifice
 Sevn bullocks yet unyokd for Phoebus choose
 And for Diana sevn unspotted ewes
 This said the servants urge the sacred rites
 While to the temple she the prince invites
 A spacious cave within its farmost part
 Was hewd and fashiond by laborious art
 Thro the hills hollow sides before the place
 A hundred doors a hundred entries grace
 As many voices issue and the sound
 Of Sybils words as many times rebound
 Now to the mouth they come Aloud she cries
 This is the time enquire your destinies
 He comes behold the god Thus while she said
 And shivring at the sacred entry stayd
 Her color changd her face was not the same
 And hollow groans from her deep spirit came
 Her hair stood up convulsive rage possessd
 Her trembling limbs and heavd her labring breast
 Greater than humankind she seemd to look
 And with an accent more than mortal spoke
 Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll
 When all the god came rushing on her soul
 Swiftly she turnd and foaming as she spoke
 Why this delay she cried the powrs invoke
 Thy prayrs alone can open this abode
 Else vain are my demands and dumb the god

 She said no more The trembling Trojans hear
 Oerspread with a damp sweat and holy fear
 The prince himself with awful dread possessd
 His vows to great Apollo thus addressd
 Indulgent god propitious powr to Troy
 Swift to relieve unwilling to destroy
 Directed by whose hand the Dardan dart
 Piercd the proud Grecians only mortal part
 Thus far by fates decrees and thy commands
 Thro ambient seas and thro devouring sands
 Our exild crew has sought th Ausonian ground
 And now at length the flying coast is found
 Thus far the fate of Troy from place to place
 With fury has pursued her wandring race
 Here cease ye powrs and let your vengeance end
 Troy is no more and can no more offend
 And thou O sacred maid inspird to see
 Th event of things in dark futurity
 Give me what Heavn has promisd to my fate
 To conquer and command the Latian state
 To fix my wandring gods and find a place
 For the long exiles of the Trojan race
 Then shall my grateful hands a temple rear
 To the twin gods with vows and solemn prayr
 And annual rites and festivals and games
 Shall be performd to their auspicious names
 Nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land
 For there thy faithful oracles shall stand
 Preservd in shrines and evry sacred lay
 Which by thy mouth Apollo shall convey
 All shall be treasurd by a chosen train
 Of holy priests and ever shall remain
 But O commit not thy prophetic mind
 To flitting leaves the sport of evry wind
 Lest they disperse in air our empty fate
 Write not but what the powrs ordain relate

 Struggling in vain impatient of her load
 And labring underneath the pondrous god
 The more she strove to shake him from her breast
 With more and far superior force he pressd
 Commands his entrance and without control
 Usurps her organs and inspires her soul
 Now with a furious blast the hundred doors
 Ope of themselves a rushing whirlwind roars
 Within the cave and Sibyls voice restores
 Escapd the dangers of the watry reign
 Yet more and greater ills by land remain
 The coast so long desird nor doubt th event
 Thy troops shall reach but having reachd repent
 Wars horrid wars I view a field of blood
 And Tiber rolling with a purple flood
 Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there
 A new Achilles shall in arms appear
 And he too goddessborn Fierce Junos hate
 Added to hostile force shall urge thy fate
 To what strange nations shalt not thou resort
 Drivn to solicit aid at evry court
 The cause the same which Ilium once oppressd
 A foreign mistress and a foreign guest
 But thou secure of soul unbent with woes
 The more thy fortune frowns the more oppose
 The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown
 From whence thou least shalt hope a Grecian town

 Thus from the dark recess the Sibyl spoke
 And the resisting air the thunder broke
 The cave rebellowd and the temple shook
 Th ambiguous god who ruld her labring breast
 In these mysterious words his mind expressd
 Some truths reveald in terms involvd the rest
 At length her fury fell her foaming ceasd
 And ebbing in her soul the god decreasd
 Then thus the chief No terror to my view
 No frightful face of danger can be new
 Inurd to suffer and resolvd to dare
 The Fates without my powr shall be without my care
 This let me crave since near your grove the road
 To hell lies open and the dark abode
 Which Acheron surrounds th innavigable flood
 Conduct me thro the regions void of light
 And lead me longing to my fathers sight
 For him a thousand dangers I have sought
 And rushing where the thickest Grecians fought
 Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought
 He for my sake the raging ocean tried
 And wrath of Heavn my still auspicious guide
 And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied
 Oft since he breathd his last in dead of night
 His reverend image stood before my sight
 Enjoind to seek below his holy shade
 Conducted there by your unerring aid
 But you if pious minds by prayrs are won
 Oblige the father and protect the son
 Yours is the powr nor Proserpine in vain
 Has made you priestess of her nightly reign
 If Orpheus armd with his enchanting lyre
 The ruthless king with pity could inspire
 And from the shades below redeem his wife
 If Pollux offring his alternate life
 Could free his brother and can daily go
 By turns aloft by turns descend below
 Why name I Theseus or his greater friend
 Who trod the downward path and upward could ascend
 Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came
 My mother greater my descent the same
 So prayd the Trojan prince and while he prayd
 His hand upon the holy altar laid

 Then thus replied the prophetess divine
 O goddessborn of great Anchises line
 The gates of hell are open night and day
 Smooth the descent and easy is the way
 But to return and view the cheerful skies
 In this the task and mighty labor lies
 To few great Jupiter imparts this grace
 And those of shining worth and heavnly race
 Betwixt those regions and our upper light
 Deep forests and impenetrable night
 Possess the middle space th infernal bounds
 Cocytus with his sable waves surrounds
 But if so dire a love your soul invades
 As twice below to view the trembling shades
 If you so hard a toil will undertake
 As twice to pass th innavigable lake
 Receive my counsel In the neighbring grove
 There stands a tree the queen of Stygian Jove
 Claims it her own thick woods and gloomy night
 Conceal the happy plant from human sight
 One bough it bears but wondrous to behold
 The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold
 This from the vulgar branches must be torn
 And to fair Proserpine the present borne
 Ere leave be givn to tempt the nether skies
 The first thus rent a second will arise
 And the same metal the same room supplies
 Look round the wood with lifted eyes to see
 The lurking gold upon the fatal tree
 Then rend it off as holy rites command
 The willing metal will obey thy hand
 Following with ease if favord by thy fate
 Thou art foredoomd to view the Stygian state
 If not no labor can the tree constrain
 And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain
 Besides you know not while you here attend
 Th unworthy fate of your unhappy friend
 Breathless he lies and his unburied ghost
 Deprivd of funral rites pollutes your host
 Pay first his pious dues and for the dead
 Two sable sheep around his hearse be led
 Then living turfs upon his body lay
 This done securely take the destind way
 To find the regions destitute of day

 She said and held her peace Aeneas went
 Sad from the cave and full of discontent
 Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant
 Achates the companion of his breast
 Goes grieving by his side with equal cares oppressd
 Walking they talkd and fruitlessly divind
 What friend the priestess by those words designd
 But soon they found an object to deplore
 Misenus lay extended on the shore
 Son of the God of Winds none so renownd
 The warrior trumpet in the field to sound
 With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms
 And rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms
 He servd great Hector and was ever near
 Not with his trumpet only but his spear
 But by Pelides arms when Hector fell
 He chose Aeneas and he chose as well
 Swoln with applause and aiming still at more
 He now provokes the sea gods from the shore
 With envy Triton heard the martial sound
 And the bold champion for his challenge drownd
 Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand
 The gazing crowd around the body stand
 All weep but most Aeneas mourns his fate
 And hastens to perform the funeral state
 In altarwise a stately pile they rear
 The basis broad below and top advancd in air
 An ancient wood fit for the work designd
 The shady covert of the salvage kind
 The Trojans found the sounding ax is plied
 Firs pines and pitch trees and the towring pride
 Of forest ashes feel the fatal stroke
 And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak
 Huge trunks of trees felld from the steepy crown
 Of the bare mountains roll with ruin down
 Armd like the rest the Trojan prince appears
 And by his pious labor urges theirs

 Thus while he wrought revolving in his mind
 The ways to compass what his wish designd
 He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove
 And then with vows implord the Queen of Love
 O may thy powr propitious still to me
 Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree
 In this deep forest since the Sibyls breath
 Foretold alas too true Misenus death
 Scarce had he said when full before his sight
 Two doves descending from their airy flight
 Secure upon the grassy plain alight
 He knew his mothers birds and thus he prayd
 Be you my guides with your auspicious aid
 And lead my footsteps till the branch be found
 Whose glittring shadow gilds the sacred ground
 And thou great parent with celestial care
 In this distress be present to my prayr
 Thus having said he stoppd with watchful sight
 Observing still the motions of their flight
 What course they took what happy signs they shew
 They fed and fluttring by degrees withdrew
 Still farther from the place but still in view
 Hopping and flying thus they led him on
 To the slow lake whose baleful stench to shun
 They wingd their flight aloft then stooping low
 Perchd on the double tree that bears the golden bough
 Thro the green leafs the glittring shadows glow
 As on the sacred oak the wintry mistletoe
 Where the proud mother views her precious brood
 And happier branches which she never sowd
 Such was the glittring such the ruddy rind
 And dancing leaves that wantond in the wind
 He seizd the shining bough with griping hold
 And rent away with ease the lingring gold
 Then to the Sibyls palace bore the prize
 Meantime the Trojan troops with weeping eyes
 To dead Misenus pay his obsequies
 First from the ground a lofty pile they rear
 Of pitch trees oaks and pines and unctuous fir
 The fabrics front with cypress twigs they strew
 And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew
 The topmost part his glittring arms adorn
 Warm waters then in brazen caldrons borne
 Are pourd to wash his body joint by joint
 And fragrant oils the stiffend limbs anoint
 With groans and cries Misenus they deplore
 Then on a bier with purple coverd oer
 The breathless body thus bewaild they lay
 And fire the pile their faces turnd away
 Such reverend rites their fathers usd to pay
 Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw
 And fat of victims which his friends bestow
 These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour
 Then on the living coals red wine they pour
 And last the relics by themselves dispose
 Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose
 Old Corynaeus compassd thrice the crew
 And dippd an olive branch in holy dew
 Which thrice he sprinkled round and thrice aloud
 Invokd the dead and then dismissed the crowd
 But good Aeneas orderd on the shore
 A stately tomb whose top a trumpet bore
 A soldiers fauchion and a seamans oar
 Thus was his friend interrd and deathless fame
 Still to the lofty cape consigns his name
 These rites performd the prince without delay
 Hastes to the nether world his destind way
 Deep was the cave and downward as it went
 From the wide mouth a rocky rough descent
 And here th access a gloomy grove defends
 And there th unnavigable lake extends
 Oer whose unhappy waters void of light
 No bird presumes to steer his airy flight
 Such deadly stenches from the depths arise
 And steaming sulphur that infects the skies
 From hence the Grecian bards their legends make
 And give the name Avernus to the lake
 Four sable bullocks in the yoke untaught
 For sacrifice the pious hero brought
 The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns
 Then cuts the curling hair that first oblation burns
 Invoking Hecate hither to repair
 A powrful name in hell and upper air
 The sacred priests with ready knives bereave
 The beasts of life and in full bowls receive
 The streaming blood a lamb to Hell and Night
 The sable wool without a streak of white
 Aeneas offers and by fates decree
 A barren heifer Proserpine to thee
 With holocausts he Plutos altar fills
 Sevn brawny bulls with his own hand he kills
 Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours
 Which ointed thus the raging flame devours
 Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun
 Nor ended till the next returning sun
 Then earth began to bellow trees to dance
 And howling dogs in glimmring light advance
 Ere Hecate came Far hence be souls profane
 The Sibyl cried and from the grove abstain
 Now Trojan take the way thy fates afford
 Assume thy courage and unsheathe thy sword
 She said and passd along the gloomy space
 The prince pursued her steps with equal pace

 Ye realms yet unreveald to human sight
 Ye gods who rule the regions of the night
 Ye gliding ghosts permit me to relate
 The mystic wonders of your silent state

 Obscure they went thro dreary shades that led
 Along the waste dominions of the dead
 Thus wander travelers in woods by night
 By the moons doubtful and malignant light
 When Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies
 And the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes

 Just in the gate and in the jaws of hell
 Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell
 And pale Diseases and repining Age
 Want Fear and Famines unresisted rage
 Here Toils and Death and Deaths halfbrother Sleep
 Forms terrible to view their sentry keep
 With anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind
 Deep Frauds before and open Force behind
 The Furies iron beds and Strife that shakes
 Her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes
 Full in the midst of this infernal road
 An elm displays her dusky arms abroad
 The God of Sleep there hides his heavy head
 And empty dreams on evry leaf are spread
 Of various forms unnumberd specters more
 Centaurs and double shapes besiege the door
 Before the passage horrid Hydra stands
 And Briareus with all his hundred hands
 Gorgons Geryon with his triple frame
 And vain Chimaera vomits empty flame
 The chief unsheathd his shining steel prepard
 Tho seizd with sudden fear to force the guard
 Offring his brandishd weapon at their face
 Had not the Sibyl stoppd his eager pace
 And told him what those empty phantoms were
 Forms without bodies and impassive air
 Hence to deep Acheron they take their way
 Whose troubled eddies thick with ooze and clay
 Are whirld aloft and in Cocytus lost
 There Charon stands who rules the dreary coast
 A sordid god down from his hoary chin
 A length of beard descends uncombd unclean
 His eyes like hollow furnaces on fire
 A girdle foul with grease binds his obscene attire
 He spreads his canvas with his pole he steers
 The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears
 He lookd in years yet in his years were seen
 A youthful vigor and autumnal green
 An airy crowd came rushing where he stood
 Which filld the margin of the fatal flood
 Husbands and wives boys and unmarried maids
 And mighty heroes more majestic shades
 And youths intombd before their fathers eyes
 With hollow groans and shrieks and feeble cries
 Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods
 Or fowls by winter forcd forsake the floods
 And wing their hasty flight to happier lands
 Such and so thick the shivring army stands
 And press for passage with extended hands
 Now these now those the surly boatman bore
 The rest he drove to distance from the shore
 The hero who beheld with wondring eyes
 The tumult mixd with shrieks laments and cries
 Askd of his guide what the rude concourse meant
 Why to the shore the thronging people bent
 What forms of law among the ghosts were usd
 Why some were ferried oer and some refusd

 Son of Anchises offspring of the gods
 The Sibyl said you see the Stygian floods
 The sacred stream which heavns imperial state
 Attests in oaths and fears to violate
 The ghosts rejected are th unhappy crew
 Deprivd of sepulchers and funral due
 The boatman Charon those the buried host
 He ferries over to the farther coast
 Nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves
 With such whose bones are not composd in graves
 A hundred years they wander on the shore
 At length their penance done are wafted oer
 The Trojan chief his forward pace repressd
 Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast
 He saw his friends who whelmd beneath the waves
 Their funral honors claimd and askd their quiet graves
 The lost Leucaspis in the crowd he knew
 And the brave leader of the Lycian crew
 Whom on the Tyrrhene seas the tempests met
 The sailors masterd and the ship oerset

 Amidst the spirits Palinurus pressd
 Yet fresh from life a newadmitted guest
 Who while he steering viewd the stars and bore
 His course from Afric to the Latian shore
 Fell headlong down The Trojan fixd his view
 And scarcely thro the gloom the sullen shadow knew
 Then thus the prince What envious powr O friend
 Brought your lovd life to this disastrous end
 For Phoebus ever true in all he said
 Has in your fate alone my faith betrayd
 The god foretold you should not die before
 You reachd secure from seas th Italian shore
 Is this th unerring powr The ghost replied
 Nor Phoebus flatterd nor his answers lied
 Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep
 But while the stars and course of heavn I keep
 My wearied eyes were seizd with fatal sleep
 I fell and with my weight the helm constraind
 Was drawn along which yet my gripe retaind
 Now by the winds and raging waves I swear
 Your safety more than mine was then my care
 Lest of the guide bereft the rudder lost
 Your ship should run against the rocky coast
 Three blustring nights borne by the southern blast
 I floated and discoverd land at last
 High on a mounting wave my head I bore
 Forcing my strength and gathring to the shore
 Panting but past the danger now I seizd
 The craggy cliffs and my tird members easd
 While cumberd with my dropping clothes I lay
 The cruel nation covetous of prey
 Staind with my blood th unhospitable coast
 And now by winds and waves my lifeless limbs are tossd
 Which O avert by yon ethereal light
 Which I have lost for this eternal night
 Or if by dearer ties you may be won
 By your dead sire and by your living son
 Redeem from this reproach my wandring ghost
 Or with your navy seek the Velin coast
 And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose
 Or if a nearer way your mother shows
 Without whose aid you durst not undertake
 This frightful passage oer the Stygian lake
 Lend to this wretch your hand and waft him oer
 To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore
 Scarce had he said the prophetess began
 What hopes delude thee miserable man
 Thinkst thou thus unintombd to cross the floods
 To view the Furies and infernal gods
 And visit without leave the dark abodes
 Attend the term of long revolving years
 Fate and the dooming gods are deaf to tears
 This comfort of thy dire misfortune take
 The wrath of Heavn inflicted for thy sake
 With vengeance shall pursue th inhuman coast
 Till they propitiate thy offended ghost
 And raise a tomb with vows and solemn prayr
 And Palinurus name the place shall bear
 This calmd his cares soothd with his future fame
 And pleasd to hear his propagated name

 Now nearer to the Stygian lake they draw
 Whom from the shore the surly boatman saw
 Observd their passage thro the shady wood
 And markd their near approaches to the flood
 Then thus he calld aloud inflamd with wrath
 Mortal whateer who this forbidden path
 In arms presumst to tread I charge thee stand
 And tell thy name and busness in the land
 Know this the realm of night the Stygian shore
 My boat conveys no living bodies oer
 Nor was I pleasd great Theseus once to bear
 Who forcd a passage with his pointed spear
 Nor strong Alcides men of mighty fame
 And from th immortal gods their lineage came
 In fetters one the barking porter tied
 And took him trembling from his sovreigns side
 Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride
 To whom the Sibyl thus Compose thy mind
 Nor frauds are here contrivd nor force designd
 Still may the dog the wandring troops constrain
 Of airy ghosts and vex the guilty train
 And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain
 The Trojan chief whose lineage is from Jove
 Much famd for arms and more for filial love
 Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove
 If neither piety nor Heavns command
 Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand
 This fatal present shall prevail at least
 Then shewd the shining bough conceald within her vest
 No more was needful for the gloomy god
 Stood mute with awe to see the golden rod
 Admird the destind offring to his queen
 A venerable gift so rarely seen
 His fury thus appeasd he puts to land
 The ghosts forsake their seats at his command
 He clears the deck receives the mighty freight
 The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight
 Slowly she sails and scarcely stems the tides
 The pressing water pours within her sides
 His passengers at length are wafted oer
 Exposd in muddy weeds upon the miry shore

 No sooner landed in his den they found
 The triple porter of the Stygian sound
 Grim Cerberus who soon began to rear
 His crested snakes and armd his bristling hair
 The prudent Sibyl had before prepard
 A sop in honey steepd to charm the guard
 Which mixd with powrful drugs she cast before
 His greedy grinning jaws just opd to roar
 With three enormous mouths he gapes and straight
 With hunger pressd devours the pleasing bait
 Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave
 He reels and falling fills the spacious cave
 The keeper charmd the chief without delay
 Passd on and took th irremeable way
 Before the gates the cries of babes new born
 Whom fate had from their tender mothers torn
 Assault his ears then those whom form of laws
 Condemnd to die when traitors judgd their cause
 Nor want they lots nor judges to review
 The wrongful sentence and award a new
 Minos the strict inquisitor appears
 And lives and crimes with his assessors hears
 Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls
 Absolves the just and dooms the guilty souls
 The next in place and punishment are they
 Who prodigally throw their souls away
 Fools who repining at their wretched state
 And loathing anxious life subornd their fate
 With late repentance now they would retrieve
 The bodies they forsook and wish to live
 Their pains and poverty desire to bear
 To view the light of heavn and breathe the vital air
 But fate forbids the Stygian floods oppose
 And with circling streams the captive souls inclose

 Not far from thence the Mournful Fields appear
 So calld from lovers that inhabit there
 The souls whom that unhappy flame invades
 In secret solitude and myrtle shades
 Make endless moans and pining with desire
 Lament too late their unextinguishd fire
 Here Procris Eriphyle here he found
 Baring her breast yet bleeding with the wound
 Made by her son He saw Pasiphae there
 With Phaedras ghost a foul incestuous pair
 There Laodamia with Evadne moves
 Unhappy both but loyal in their loves
 Caeneus a woman once and once a man
 But ending in the sex she first began
 Not far from these Phoenician Dido stood
 Fresh from her wound her bosom bathd in blood
 Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew
 Obscure in shades and with a doubtful view
 Doubtful as he who sees thro dusky night
 Or thinks he sees the moons uncertain light
 With tears he first approachd the sullen shade
 And as his love inspird him thus he said
 Unhappy queen then is the common breath
 Of rumor true in your reported death
 And I alas the cause By Heavn I vow
 And all the powrs that rule the realms below
 Unwilling I forsook your friendly state
 Commanded by the gods and forcd by fate
 Those gods that fate whose unresisted might
 Have sent me to these regions void of light
 Thro the vast empire of eternal night
 Nor dard I to presume that pressd with grief
 My flight should urge you to this dire relief
 Stay stay your steps and listen to my vows
 T is the last interview that fate allows
 In vain he thus attempts her mind to move
 With tears and prayrs and laterepenting love
 Disdainfully she lookd then turning round
 But fixd her eyes unmovd upon the ground
 And what he says and swears regards no more
 Than the deaf rocks when the loud billows roar
 But whirld away to shun his hateful sight
 Hid in the forest and the shades of night
 Then sought Sichaeus thro the shady grove
 Who answerd all her cares and equald all her love

 Some pious tears the pitying hero paid
 And followd with his eyes the flitting shade
 Then took the forward way by fate ordaind
 And with his guide the farther fields attaind
 Where severd from the rest the warrior souls remaind
 Tydeus he met with Meleagers race
 The pride of armies and the soldiers grace
 And pale Adrastus with his ghastly face
 Of Trojan chiefs he viewd a numrous train
 All much lamented all in battle slain
 Glaucus and Medon high above the rest
 Antenors sons and Ceres sacred priest
 And proud Idaeus Priams charioteer
 Who shakes his empty reins and aims his airy spear
 The gladsome ghosts in circling troops attend
 And with unwearied eyes behold their friend
 Delight to hover near and long to know
 What busness brought him to the realms below
 But Argive chiefs and Agamemnons train
 When his refulgent arms flashd thro the shady plain
 Fled from his wellknown face with wonted fear
 As when his thundring sword and pointed spear
 Drove headlong to their ships and gleand the routed rear
 They raisd a feeble cry with trembling notes
 But the weak voice deceivd their gasping throats

 Here Priams son Deiphobus he found
 Whose face and limbs were one continued wound
 Dishonest with loppd arms the youth appears
 Spoild of his nose and shortend of his ears
 He scarcely knew him striving to disown
 His blotted form and blushing to be known
 And therefore first began O Teucers race
 Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface
 What heart could wish what hand inflict this dire disgrace
 Twas famd that in our last and fatal night
 Your single prowess long sustaind the fight
 Till tird not forcd a glorious fate you chose
 And fell upon a heap of slaughterd foes
 But in remembrance of so brave a deed
 A tomb and funral honors I decreed
 Thrice calld your manes on the Trojan plains
 The place your armor and your name retains
 Your body too I sought and had I found
 Designd for burial in your native ground

 The ghost replied Your piety has paid
 All needful rites to rest my wandring shade
 But cruel fate and my more cruel wife
 To Grecian swords betrayd my sleeping life
 These are the monuments of Helens love
 The shame I bear below the marks I bore above
 You know in what deluding joys we passd
 The night that was by Heavn decreed our last
 For when the fatal horse descending down
 Pregnant with arms oerwhelmd th unhappy town
 She feignd nocturnal orgies left my bed
 And mixd with Trojan dames the dances led
 Then waving high her torch the signal made
 Which rousd the Grecians from their ambuscade
 With watching overworn with cares oppressd
 Unhappy I had laid me down to rest
 And heavy sleep my weary limbs possessd
 Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid
 And from beneath my head my sword conveyd
 The door unlatchd and with repeated calls
 Invites her former lord within my walls
 Thus in her crime her confidence she placd
 And with new treasons would redeem the past
 What need I more Into the room they ran
 And meanly murtherd a defenseless man
 Ulysses basely born first led the way
 Avenging powrs with justice if I pray
 That fortune be their own another day
 But answer you and in your turn relate
 What brought you living to the Stygian state
 Drivn by the winds and errors of the sea
 Or did you Heavns superior doom obey
 Or tell what other chance conducts your way
 To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats
 Tumults and torments of th infernal seats

 While thus in talk the flying hours they pass
 The sun had finishd more than half his race
 And they perhaps in words and tears had spent
 The little time of stay which Heavn had lent
 But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay
 Night rushes down and headlong drives the day
 T is here in different paths the way divides
 The right to Plutos golden palace guides
 The left to that unhappy region tends
 Which to the depth of Tartarus descends
 The seat of night profound and punishd fiends
 Then thus Deiphobus O sacred maid
 Forbear to chide and be your will obeyd
 Lo to the secret shadows I retire
 To pay my penance till my years expire
 Proceed auspicious prince with glory crownd
 And born to better fates than I have found
 He said and while he said his steps he turnd
 To secret shadows and in silence mournd

 The hero looking on the left espied
 A lofty towr and strong on evry side
 With treble walls which Phlegethon surrounds
 Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds
 And pressd betwixt the rocks the bellowing noise resounds
 Wide is the fronting gate and raisd on high
 With adamantine columns threats the sky
 Vain is the force of man and Heavns as vain
 To crush the pillars which the pile sustain
 Sublime on these a towr of steel is reard
 And dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward
 Girt in her sanguine gown by night and day
 Observant of the souls that pass the downward way
 From hence are heard the groans of ghosts the pains
 Of sounding lashes and of dragging chains
 The Trojan stood astonishd at their cries
 And askd his guide from whence those yells arise
 And what the crimes and what the tortures were
 And loud laments that rent the liquid air

 She thus replied The chaste and holy race
 Are all forbidden this polluted place
 But Hecate when she gave to rule the woods
 Then led me trembling thro these dire abodes
 And taught the tortures of th avenging gods
 These are the realms of unrelenting fate
 And awful Rhadamanthus rules the state
 He hears and judges each committed crime
 Enquires into the manner place and time
 The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal
 Loth to confess unable to conceal
 From the first moment of his vital breath
 To his last hour of unrepenting death
 Straight oer the guilty ghost the Fury shakes
 The sounding whip and brandishes her snakes
 And the pale sinner with her sisters takes
 Then of itself unfolds th eternal door
 With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar
 You see before the gate what stalking ghost
 Commands the guard what sentries keep the post
 More formidable Hydra stands within
 Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin
 The gaping gulf low to the center lies
 And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies
 The rivals of the gods the Titan race
 Here singd with lightning roll within th unfathomd space
 Here lie th Alaean twins I saw them both
 Enormous bodies of gigantic growth
 Who dard in fight the Thundrer to defy
 Affect his heavn and force him from the sky
 Salmoneus suffring cruel pains I found
 For emulating Jove the rattling sound
 Of mimic thunder and the glittring blaze
 Of pointed lightnings and their forky rays
 Thro Elis and the Grecian towns he flew
 Th audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew
 He wavd a torch aloft and madly vain
 Sought godlike worship from a servile train
 Ambitious fool with horny hoofs to pass
 Oer hollow arches of resounding brass
 To rival thunder in its rapid course
 And imitate inimitable force
 But he the King of Heavn obscure on high
 Bard his red arm and launching from the sky
 His writhen bolt not shaking empty smoke
 Down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook
 There Tityus was to see who took his birth
 From heavn his nursing from the foodful earth
 Here his gigantic limbs with large embrace
 Infold nine acres of infernal space
 A ravnous vulture in his opend side
 Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried
 Still for the growing liver diggd his breast
 The growing liver still supplied the feast
 Still are his entrails fruitful to their pains
 Th immortal hunger lasts th immortal food remains
 Ixion and Perithous I could name
 And more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame
 High oer their heads a moldring rock is placd
 That promises a fall and shakes at evry blast
 They lie below on golden beds displayd
 And genial feasts with regal pomp are made
 The Queen of Furies by their sides is set
 And snatches from their mouths th untasted meat
 Which if they touch her hissing snakes she rears
 Tossing her torch and thundring in their ears
 Then they who brothers better claim disown
 Expel their parents and usurp the throne
 Defraud their clients and to lucre sold
 Sit brooding on unprofitable gold
 Who dare not give and evn refuse to lend
 To their poor kindred or a wanting friend
 Vast is the throng of these nor less the train
 Of lustful youths for foul adultry slain
 Hosts of deserters who their honor sold
 And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold
 All these within the dungeons depth remain
 Despairing pardon and expecting pain
 Ask not what pains nor farther seek to know
 Their process or the forms of law below
 Some roll a weighty stone some laid along
 And bound with burning wires on spokes of wheels are hung
 Unhappy Theseus doomd for ever there
 Is fixd by fate on his eternal chair
 And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries
 Could warning make the world more just or wise
 Learn righteousness and dread th avenging deities
 To tyrants others have their country sold
 Imposing foreign lords for foreign gold
 Some have old laws repeald new statutes made
 Not as the people pleasd but as they paid
 With incest some their daughters bed profand
 All dard the worst of ills and what they dard attaind
 Had I a hundred mouths a hundred tongues
 And throats of brass inspird with iron lungs
 I could not half those horrid crimes repeat
 Nor half the punishments those crimes have met
 But let us haste our voyage to pursue
 The walls of Plutos palace are in view
 The gate and iron arch above it stands
 On anvils labord by the Cyclops hands
 Before our farther way the Fates allow
 Here must we fix on high the golden bough

 She said and thro the gloomy shades they passd
 And chose the middle path Arrivd at last
 The prince with living water sprinkled oer
 His limbs and body then approachd the door
 Possessd the porch and on the front above
 He fixd the fatal bough requird by Plutos love
 These holy rites performd they took their way
 Where long extended plains of pleasure lay
 The verdant fields with those of heavn may vie
 With ether vested and a purple sky
 The blissful seats of happy souls below
 Stars of their own and their own suns they know
 Their airy limbs in sports they exercise
 And on the green contend the wrestlers prize
 Some in heroic verse divinely sing
 Others in artful measures led the ring
 The Thracian bard surrounded by the rest
 There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest
 His flying fingers and harmonious quill
 Strikes sevn distinguishd notes and sevn at once they fill
 Here found they Teucers old heroic race
 Born better times and happier years to grace
 Assaracus and Ilus here enjoy
 Perpetual fame with him who founded Troy
 The chief beheld their chariots from afar
 Their shining arms and coursers traind to war
 Their lances fixd in earth their steeds around
 Free from their harness graze the flowry ground
 The love of horses which they had alive
 And care of chariots after death survive
 Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain
 Some did the song and some the choir maintain
 Beneath a laurel shade where mighty Po
 Mounts up to woods above and hides his head below
 Here patriots live who for their countrys good
 In fighting fields were prodigal of blood
 Priests of unblemishd lives here make abode
 And poets worthy their inspiring god
 And searching wits of more mechanic parts
 Who gracd their age with newinvented arts
 Those who to worth their bounty did extend
 And those who knew that bounty to commend
 The heads of these with holy fillets bound
 And all their temples were with garlands crownd

 To these the Sibyl thus her speech addressd
 And first to him surrounded by the rest
 Towring his height and ample was his breast
 Say happy souls divine Musaeus say
 Where lives Anchises and where lies our way
 To find the hero for whose only sake
 We sought the dark abodes and crossd the bitter lake
 To this the sacred poet thus replied
 In no fixd place the happy souls reside
 In groves we live and lie on mossy beds
 By crystal streams that murmur thro the meads
 But pass yon easy hill and thence descend
 The path conducts you to your journeys end
 This said he led them up the mountains brow
 And shews them all the shining fields below
 They wind the hill and thro the blissful meadows go

 But old Anchises in a flowry vale
 Reviewd his musterd race and took the tale
 Those happy spirits which ordaind by fate
 For future beings and new bodies wait
 With studious thought observd th illustrious throng
 In natures order as they passd along
 Their names their fates their conduct and their care
 In peaceful senates and successful war
 He when Aeneas on the plain appears
 Meets him with open arms and falling tears
 Welcome he said the gods undoubted race
 O long expected to my dear embrace
 Once more t is givn me to behold your face
 The love and pious duty which you pay
 Have passd the perils of so hard a way
 T is true computing times I now believd
 The happy day approachd nor are my hopes deceivd
 What length of lands what oceans have you passd
 What storms sustaind and on what shores been cast
 How have I feard your fate but feard it most
 When love assaild you on the Libyan coast
 To this the filial duty thus replies
 Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes
 Appeard and often urgd this painful enterprise
 After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea
 My navy rides at anchor in the bay
 But reach your hand O parent shade nor shun
 The dear embraces of your longing son
 He said and falling tears his face bedew
 Then thrice around his neck his arms he threw
 And thrice the flitting shadow slippd away
 Like winds or empty dreams that fly the day

 Now in a secret vale the Trojan sees
 A seprate grove thro which a gentle breeze
 Plays with a passing breath and whispers thro the trees
 And just before the confines of the wood
 The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood
 About the boughs an airy nation flew
 Thick as the humming bees that hunt the golden dew
 In summers heat on tops of lilies feed
 And creep within their bells to suck the balmy seed
 The winged army roams the fields around
 The rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound
 Aeneas wondring stood then askd the cause
 Which to the stream the crowding people draws
 Then thus the sire The souls that throng the flood
 Are those to whom by fate are other bodies owd
 In Lethes lake they long oblivion taste
 Of future life secure forgetful of the past
 Long has my soul desird this time and place
 To set before your sight your glorious race
 That this presaging joy may fire your mind
 To seek the shores by destiny designd
 O father can it be that souls sublime
 Return to visit our terrestrial clime
 And that the genrous mind releasd by death
 Can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath

 Anchises then in order thus begun
 To clear those wonders to his godlike son
 Know first that heavn and earths compacted frame
 And flowing waters and the starry flame
 And both the radiant lights one common soul
 Inspires and feeds and animates the whole
 This active mind infusd thro all the space
 Unites and mingles with the mighty mass
 Hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain
 And birds of air and monsters of the main
 Th ethereal vigor is in all the same
 And every soul is filld with equal flame
 As much as earthy limbs and gross allay
 Of mortal members subject to decay
 Blunt not the beams of heavn and edge of day
 From this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts
 Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts
 And grief and joy nor can the groveling mind
 In the dark dungeon of the limbs confind
 Assert the native skies or own its heavnly kind
 Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains
 But longcontracted filth evn in the soul remains
 The relics of inveterate vice they wear
 And spots of sin obscene in evry face appear
 For this are various penances enjoind
 And some are hung to bleach upon the wind
 Some plungd in waters others purgd in fires
 Till all the dregs are draind and all the rust expires
 All have their manes and those manes bear
 The few so cleansd to these abodes repair
 And breathe in ample fields the soft Elysian air
 Then are they happy when by length of time
 The scurf is worn away of each committed crime
 No speck is left of their habitual stains
 But the pure ether of the soul remains
 But when a thousand rolling years are past
 So long their punishments and penance last
 Whole droves of minds are by the driving god
 Compelld to drink the deep Lethaean flood
 In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares
 Of their past labors and their irksome years
 That unremembring of its former pain
 The soul may suffer mortal flesh again

 Thus having said the father spirit leads
 The priestess and his son thro swarms of shades
 And takes a rising ground from thence to see
 The long procession of his progeny
 Survey pursued the sire this airy throng
 As offerd to thy view they pass along
 These are th Italian names which fate will join
 With ours and graff upon the Trojan line
 Observe the youth who first appears in sight
 And holds the nearest station to the light
 Already seems to snuff the vital air
 And leans just forward on a shining spear
 Silvius is he thy lastbegotten race
 But first in order sent to fill thy place
 An Alban name but mixd with Dardan blood
 Born in the covert of a shady wood
 Him fair Lavinia thy surviving wife
 Shall breed in groves to lead a solitary life
 In Alba he shall fix his royal seat
 And born a king a race of kings beget
 Then Procas honor of the Trojan name
 Capys and Numitor of endless fame
 A second Silvius after these appears
 Silvius Aeneas for thy name he bears
 For arms and justice equally renownd
 Who late restord in Alba shall be crownd
 How great they look how vigrously they wield
 Their weighty lances and sustain the shield
 But they who crownd with oaken wreaths appear
 Shall Gabian walls and strong Fidena rear
 Nomentum Bola with Pometia found
 And raise Collatian towrs on rocky ground
 All these shall then be towns of mighty fame
 Tho now they lie obscure and lands without a name
 See Romulus the great born to restore
 The crown that once his injurd grandsire wore
 This prince a priestess of your blood shall bear
 And like his sire in arms he shall appear
 Two rising crests his royal head adorn
 Born from a god himself to godhead born
 His sire already signs him for the skies
 And marks the seat amidst the deities
 Auspicious chief thy race in times to come
 Shall spread the conquests of imperial Rome
 Rome whose ascending towrs shall heavn invade
 Involving earth and ocean in her shade
 High as the Mother of the Gods in place
 And proud like her of an immortal race
 Then when in pomp she makes the Phrygian round
 With golden turrets on her temples crownd
 A hundred gods her sweeping train supply
 Her offspring all and all command the sky

 Now fix your sight and stand intent to see
 Your Roman race and Julian progeny
 The mighty Caesar waits his vital hour
 Impatient for the world and grasps his promisd powr
 But next behold the youth of form divine
 Ceasar himself exalted in his line
 Augustus promisd oft and long foretold
 Sent to the realm that Saturn ruld of old
 Born to restore a better age of gold
 Afric and India shall his powr obey
 He shall extend his propagated sway
 Beyond the solar year without the starry way
 Where Atlas turns the rolling heavns around
 And his broad shoulders with their lights are crownd
 At his foreseen approach already quake
 The Caspian kingdoms and Maeotian lake
 Their seers behold the tempest from afar
 And threatning oracles denounce the war
 Nile hears him knocking at his sevnfold gates
 And seeks his hidden spring and fears his nephews fates
 Nor Hercules more lands or labors knew
 Not tho the brazenfooted hind he slew
 Freed Erymanthus from the foaming boar
 And dippd his arrows in Lernaean gore
 Nor Bacchus turning from his Indian war
 By tigers drawn triumphant in his car
 From Nisus top descending on the plains
 With curling vines around his purple reins
 And doubt we yet thro dangers to pursue
 The paths of honor and a crown in view
 But whats the man who from afar appears
 His head with olive crownd his hand a censer bears
 His hoary beard and holy vestments bring
 His lost idea back I know the Roman king
 He shall to peaceful Rome new laws ordain
 Calld from his mean abode a scepter to sustain
 Him Tullus next in dignity succeeds
 An active prince and prone to martial deeds
 He shall his troops for fighting fields prepare
 Disusd to toils and triumphs of the war
 By dint of sword his crown he shall increase
 And scour his armor from the rust of peace
 Whom Ancus follows with a fawning air
 But vain within and proudly popular
 Next view the Tarquin kings th avenging sword
 Of Brutus justly drawn and Rome restord
 He first renews the rods and ax severe
 And gives the consuls royal robes to wear
 His sons who seek the tyrant to sustain
 And long for arbitrary lords again
 With ignominy scourgd in open sight
 He dooms to death deservd asserting public right
 Unhappy man to break the pious laws
 Of nature pleading in his childrens cause
 Howeer the doubtful fact is understood
 T is love of honor and his countrys good
 The consul not the father sheds the blood
 Behold Torquatus the same track pursue
 And next the two devoted Decii view
 The Drusian line Camillus loaded home
 With standards well redeemd and foreign foes oercome
 The pair you see in equal armor shine
 Now friends below in close embraces join
 But when they leave the shady realms of night
 And clothd in bodies breathe your upper light
 With mortal hate each other shall pursue
 What wars what wounds what slaughter shall ensue
 From Alpine heights the father first descends
 His daughters husband in the plain attends
 His daughters husband arms his eastern friends
 Embrace again my sons be foes no more
 Nor stain your country with her childrens gore
 And thou the first lay down thy lawless claim
 Thou of my blood who bearist the Julian name
 Another comes who shall in triumph ride
 And to the Capitol his chariot guide
 From conquerd Corinth rich with Grecian spoils
 And yet another famd for warlike toils
 On Argos shall impose the Roman laws
 And on the Greeks revenge the Trojan cause
 Shall drag in chains their Achillean race
 Shall vindicate his ancestors disgrace
 And Pallas for her violated place
 Great Cato there for gravity renownd
 And conquring Cossus goes with laurels crownd
 Who can omit the Gracchi who declare
 The Scipios worth those thunderbolts of war
 The double bane of Carthage Who can see
 Without esteem for virtuous poverty
 Severe Fabricius or can cease t admire
 The plowman consul in his coarse attire
 Tird as I am my praise the Fabii claim
 And thou great hero greatest of thy name
 Ordaind in war to save the sinking state
 And by delays to put a stop to fate
 Let others better mold the running mass
 Of metals and inform the breathing brass
 And soften into flesh a marble face
 Plead better at the bar describe the skies
 And when the stars descend and when they rise
 But Rome t is thine alone with awful sway
 To rule mankind and make the world obey
 Disposing peace and war by thy own majestic way
 To tame the proud the fetterd slave to free
 These are imperial arts and worthy thee

 He pausd and while with wondring eyes they viewd
 The passing spirits thus his speech renewd
 See great Marcellus how untird in toils
 He moves with manly grace how rich with regal spoils
 He when his country threatend with alarms
 Requires his courage and his conquring arms
 Shall more than once the Punic bands affright
 Shall kill the Gaulish king in single fight
 Then to the Capitol in triumph move
 And the third spoils shall grace Feretrian Jove
 Aeneas here beheld of form divine
 A godlike youth in glittring armor shine
 With great Marcellus keeping equal pace
 But gloomy were his eyes dejected was his face
 He saw and wondring askd his airy guide
 What and of whence was he who pressd the heros side
 His son or one of his illustrious name
 How like the former and almost the same
 Observe the crowds that compass him around
 All gaze and all admire and raise a shouting sound
 But hovring mists around his brows are spread
 And night with sable shades involves his head
 Seek not to know the ghost replied with tears
 The sorrows of thy sons in future years
 This youth the blissful vision of a day
 Shall just be shown on earth and snatchd away
 The gods too high had raisd the Roman state
 Were but their gifts as permanent as great
 What groans of men shall fill the Martian field
 How fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield
 What funral pomp shall floating Tiber see
 When rising from his bed he views the sad solemnity
 No youth shall equal hopes of glory give
 No youth afford so great a cause to grieve
 The Trojan honor and the Roman boast
 Admird when living and adord when lost
 Mirror of ancient faith in early youth
 Undaunted worth inviolable truth
 No foe unpunishd in the fighting field
 Shall dare thee foot to foot with sword and shield
 Much less in arms oppose thy matchless force
 When thy sharp spurs shall urge thy foaming horse
 Ah couldst thou break thro fates severe decree
 A new Marcellus shall arise in thee
 Full canisters of fragrant lilies bring
 Mixd with the purple roses of the spring
 Let me with funral flowrs his body strow
 This gift which parents to their children owe
 This unavailing gift at least I may bestow
 Thus having said he led the hero round
 The confines of the blest Elysian ground
 Which when Anchises to his son had shown
 And fird his mind to mount the promisd throne
 He tells the future wars ordaind by fate
 The strength and customs of the Latian state
 The prince and people and forearms his care
 With rules to push his fortune or to bear

 Two gates the silent house of Sleep adorn
 Of polishd ivory this that of transparent horn
 True visions thro transparent horn arise
 Thro polishd ivory pass deluding lies
 Of various things discoursing as he passd
 Anchises hither bends his steps at last
 Then thro the gate of ivry he dismissd
 His valiant offspring and divining guest
 Straight to the ships Aeneas his way
 Embarkd his men and skimmd along the sea
 Still coasting till he gaind Cajetas bay
 At length on oozy ground his galleys moor
 Their heads are turnd to sea their sterns to shore




 BOOK VII

 And thou O matron of immortal fame
 Here dying to the shore hast left thy name
 Cajeta still the place is calld from thee
 The nurse of great Aeneas infancy
 Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperias plains
 Thy name t is all a ghost can have remains

 Now when the prince her funral rites had paid
 He plowd the Tyrrhene seas with sails displayd
 From land a gentle breeze arose by night
 Serenely shone the stars the moon was bright
 And the sea trembled with her silver light
 Now near the shelves of Circes shores they run
 Circe the rich the daughter of the Sun
 A dangrous coast the goddess wastes her days
 In joyous songs the rocks resound her lays
 In spinning or the loom she spends the night
 And cedar brands supply her fathers light
 From hence were heard rebellowing to the main
 The roars of lions that refuse the chain
 The grunts of bristled boars and groans of bears
 And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors ears
 These from their caverns at the close of night
 Fill the sad isle with horror and affright
 Darkling they mourn their fate whom Circes powr
 That watchd the moon and planetary hour
 With words and wicked herbs from humankind
 Had alterd and in brutal shapes confind
 Which monsters lest the Trojans pious host
 Should bear or touch upon th inchanted coast
 Propitious Neptune steerd their course by night
 With rising gales that sped their happy flight
 Supplied with these they skim the sounding shore
 And hear the swelling surges vainly roar
 Now when the rosy morn began to rise
 And wavd her saffron streamer thro the skies
 When Thetis blushd in purple not her own
 And from her face the breathing winds were blown
 A sudden silence sate upon the sea
 And sweeping oars with struggling urge their way
 The Trojan from the main beheld a wood
 Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood
 Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course
 With whirlpools dimpled and with downward force
 That drove the sand along he took his way
 And rolld his yellow billows to the sea
 About him and above and round the wood
 The birds that haunt the borders of his flood
 That bathd within or basked upon his side
 To tuneful songs their narrow throats applied
 The captain gives command the joyful train
 Glide thro the gloomy shade and leave the main

 Now Erato thy poets mind inspire
 And fill his soul with thy celestial fire
 Relate what Latium was her ancient kings
 Declare the past and state of things
 When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought
 And how the rivals lovd and how they fought
 These are my theme and how the war began
 And how concluded by the godlike man
 For I shall sing of battles blood and rage
 Which princes and their people did engage
 And haughty souls that movd with mutual hate
 In fighting fields pursued and found their fate
 That rousd the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms
 And peaceful Italy involvd in arms
 A larger scene of action is displayd
 And rising hence a greater work is weighd

 Latinus old and mild had long possessd
 The Latin scepter and his people blest
 His father Faunus a Laurentian dame
 His mother fair Marica was her name
 But Faunus came from Picus Picus drew
 His birth from Saturn if records be true
 Thus King Latinus in the third degree
 Had Saturn author of his family
 But this old peaceful prince as Heavn decreed
 Was blest with no male issue to succeed
 His sons in blooming youth were snatchd by fate
 One only daughter heird the royal state
 Fird with her love and with ambition led
 The neighbring princes court her nuptial bed
 Among the crowd but far above the rest
 Young Turnus to the beauteous maid addressd
 Turnus for high descent and graceful mien
 Was first and favord by the Latian queen
 With him she strove to join Lavinias hand
 But dire portents the purposd match withstand

 Deep in the palace of long growth there stood
 A laurels trunk a venerable wood
 Where rites divine were paid whose holy hair
 Was kept and cut with superstitious care
 This plant Latinus when his town he walld
 Then found and from the tree Laurentum calld
 And last in honor of his new abode
 He vowd the laurel to the laurels god
 It happend once a boding prodigy
 A swarm of bees that cut the liquid sky
 Unknown from whence they took their airy flight
 Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight
 There with their clasping feet together clung
 And a long cluster from the laurel hung
 An ancient augur prophesied from hence
 Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince
 From the same parts of heavn his navy stands
 To the same parts on earth his army lands
 The town he conquers and the towr commands

 Yet more when fair Lavinia fed the fire
 Before the gods and stood beside her sire
 Strange to relate the flames involvd in smoke
 Of incense from the sacred altar broke
 Caught her disheveld hair and rich attire
 Her crown and jewels crackled in the fire
 From thence the fuming trail began to spread
 And lambent glories dancd about her head
 This new portent the seer with wonder views
 Then pausing thus his prophecy renews
 The nymph who scatters flaming fires around
 Shall shine with honor shall herself be crownd
 But causd by her irrevocable fate
 War shall the country waste and change the state

 Latinus frighted with this dire ostent
 For counsel to his father Faunus went
 And sought the shades renownd for prophecy
 Which near Albuneas sulphrous fountain lie
 To these the Latian and the Sabine land
 Fly when distressd and thence relief demand
 The priest on skins of offrings takes his ease
 And nightly visions in his slumber sees
 A swarm of thin aerial shapes appears
 And fluttring round his temples deafs his ears
 These he consults the future fates to know
 From powrs above and from the fiends below
 Here for the gods advice Latinus flies
 Offring a hundred sheep for sacrifice
 Their woolly fleeces as the rites requird
 He laid beneath him and to rest retird
 No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound
 When from above a more than mortal sound
 Invades his ears and thus the vision spoke
 Seek not my seed in Latian bands to yoke
 Our fair Lavinia nor the gods provoke
 A foreign son upon thy shore descends
 Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends
 His race in arms and arts of peace renownd
 Not Latium shall contain nor Europe bound
 T is theirs whateer the sun surveys around
 These answers in the silent night receivd
 The king himself divulgd the land believd
 The fame thro all the neighbring nations flew
 When now the Trojan navy was in view

 Beneath a shady tree the hero spread
 His table on the turf with cakes of bread
 And with his chiefs on forest fruits he fed
 They sate and not without the gods command
 Their homely fare dispatchd the hungry band
 Invade their trenchers next and soon devour
 To mend the scanty meal their cakes of flour
 Ascanius this observd and smiling said
 See we devour the plates on which we fed
 The speech had omen that the Trojan race
 Should find repose and this the time and place
 Aeneas took the word and thus replies
 Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes
 All hail O earth all hail my household gods
 Behold the destind place of your abodes
 For thus Anchises prophesied of old
 And this our fatal place of rest foretold
 When on a foreign shore instead of meat
 By famine forcd your trenchers you shall eat
 Then ease your weary Trojans will attend
 And the long labors of your voyage end
 Remember on that happy coast to build
 And with a trench inclose the fruitful field
 This was that famine this the fatal place
 Which ends the wandring of our exild race
 Then on tomorrows dawn your care employ
 To search the land and where the cities lie
 And what the men but give this day to joy
 Now pour to Jove and after Jove is blest
 Call great Anchises to the genial feast
 Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught
 Enjoy the present hour adjourn the future thought

 Thus having said the hero bound his brows
 With leafy branches then performd his vows
 Adoring first the genius of the place
 Then Earth the mother of the heavnly race
 The nymphs and native godheads yet unknown
 And Night and all the stars that gild her sable throne
 And ancient Cybel and Idaean Jove
 And last his sire below and mother queen above
 Then heavns high monarch thunderd thrice aloud
 And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud
 Soon thro the joyful camp a rumor flew
 The time was come their city to renew
 Then evry brow with cheerful green is crownd
 The feasts are doubled and the bowls go round

 When next the rosy morn disclosd the day
 The scouts to sevral parts divide their way
 To learn the natives names their towns explore
 The coasts and trendings of the crooked shore
 Here Tiber flows and here Numicus stands
 Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands
 The pious chief who sought by peaceful ways
 To found his empire and his town to raise
 A hundred youths from all his train selects
 And to the Latian court their course directs
 The spacious palace where their prince resides
 And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides
 They go commissiond to require a peace
 And carry presents to procure access
 Thus while they speed their pace the prince designs
 His newelected seat and draws the lines
 The Trojans round the place a rampire cast
 And palisades about the trenches placd

 Meantime the train proceeding on their way
 From far the town and lofty towrs survey
 At length approach the walls Without the gate
 They see the boys and Latian youth debate
 The martial prizes on the dusty plain
 Some drive the cars and some the coursers rein
 Some bend the stubborn bow for victory
 And some with darts their active sinews try
 A posting messenger dispatchd from hence
 Of this fair troop advisd their aged prince
 That foreign men of mighty stature came
 Uncouth their habit and unknown their name
 The king ordains their entrance and ascends
 His regal seat surrounded by his friends

 The palace built by Picus vast and proud
 Supported by a hundred pillars stood
 And round incompassd with a rising wood
 The pile oerlookd the town and drew the sight
 Surprisd at once with reverence and delight
 There kings receivd the marks of sovreign powr
 In state the monarchs marchd the lictors bore
 Their awful axes and the rods before
 Here the tribunal stood the house of prayr
 And here the sacred senators repair
 All at large tables in long order set
 A ram their offring and a ram their meat
 Above the portal carvd in cedar wood
 Placd in their ranks their godlike grandsires stood
 Old Saturn with his crooked scythe on high
 And Italus that led the colony
 And ancient Janus with his double face
 And bunch of keys the porter of the place
 There good Sabinus planter of the vines
 On a short pruning hook his head reclines
 And studiously surveys his genrous wines
 Then warlike kings who for their country fought
 And honorable wounds from battle brought
 Around the posts hung helmets darts and spears
 And captive chariots axes shields and bars
 And broken beaks of ships the trophies of their wars
 Above the rest as chief of all the band
 Was Picus placd a buckler in his hand
 His other wavd a long divining wand
 Girt in his Gabin gown the hero sate
 Yet could not with his art avoid his fate
 For Circe long had lovd the youth in vain
 Till love refusd converted to disdain
 Then mixing powrful herbs with magic art
 She changd his form who could not change his heart
 Constraind him in a bird and made him fly
 With partycolord plumes a chattring pie

 In this high temple on a chair of state
 The seat of audience old Latinus sate
 Then gave admission to the Trojan train
 And thus with pleasing accents he began
 Tell me ye Trojans for that name you own
 Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown
 Say what you seek and whither were you bound
 Were you by stress of weather cast aground
 Such dangers as on seas are often seen
 And oft befall to miserable men
 Or come your shipping in our ports to lay
 Spent and disabled in so long a way
 Say what you want the Latians you shall find
 Not forcd to goodness but by will inclind
 For since the time of Saturns holy reign
 His hospitable customs we retain
 I call to mind but time the tale has worn
 Th Arunci told that Dardanus tho born
 On Latian plains yet sought the Phrygian shore
 And Samothracia Samos calld before
 From Tuscan Coritum he claimd his birth
 But after when exempt from mortal earth
 From thence ascended to his kindred skies
 A god and as a god augments their sacrifice

 He said Ilioneus made this reply
 O king of Faunus royal family
 Nor wintry winds to Latium forcd our way
 Nor did the stars our wandring course betray
 Willing we sought your shores and hither bound
 The port so long desird at length we found
 From our sweet homes and ancient realms expelld
 Great as the greatest that the sun beheld
 The god began our line who rules above
 And as our race our king descends from Jove
 And hither are we come by his command
 To crave admission in your happy land
 How dire a tempest from Mycenae pourd
 Our plains our temples and our town devourd
 What was the waste of war what fierce alarms
 Shook Asias crown with European arms
 Evn such have heard if any such there be
 Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea
 And such as born beneath the burning sky
 And sultry sun betwixt the tropics lie
 From that dire deluge thro the watry waste
 Such length of years such various perils past
 At last escapd to Latium we repair
 To beg what you without your want may spare
 The common water and the common air
 Sheds which ourselves will build and mean abodes
 Fit to receive and serve our banishd gods
 Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace
 Nor length of time our gratitude efface
 Besides what endless honor you shall gain
 To save and shelter Troys unhappy train
 Now by my sovreign and his fate I swear
 Renownd for faith in peace for force in war
 Oft our alliance other lands desird
 And what we seek of you of us requird
 Despite not then that in our hands we bear
 These holy boughs sue with words of prayr
 Fate and the gods by their supreme command
 Have doomd our ships to seek the Latian land
 To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends
 Here Dardanus was born and hither tends
 Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force
 And where Numicus opes his holy source
 Besides our prince presents with his request
 Some small remains of what his sire possessd
 This golden charger snatchd from burning Troy
 Anchises did in sacrifice employ
 This royal robe and this tiara wore
 Old Priam and this golden scepter bore
 In full assemblies and in solemn games
 These purple vests were weavd by Dardan dames

 Thus while he spoke Latinus rolld around
 His eyes and fixd a while upon the ground
 Intent he seemd and anxious in his breast
 Not by the scepter movd or kingly vest
 But pondring future things of wondrous weight
 Succession empire and his daughters fate
 On these he musd within his thoughtful mind
 And then revolvd what Faunus had divind
 This was the foreign prince by fate decreed
 To share his scepter and Lavinias bed
 This was the race that sure portents foreshew
 To sway the world and land and sea subdue
 At length he raisd his cheerful head and spoke
 The powrs said he the powrs we both invoke
 To you and yours and mine propitious be
 And firm our purpose with their augury
 Have what you ask your presents I receive
 Land where and when you please with ample leave
 Partake and use my kingdom as your own
 All shall be yours while I command the crown
 And if my wishd alliance please your king
 Tell him he should not send the peace but bring
 Then let him not a friends embraces fear
 The peace is made when I behold him here
 Besides this answer tell my royal guest
 I add to his commands my own request
 One only daughter heirs my crown and state
 Whom not our oracles nor Heavn nor fate
 Nor frequent prodigies permit to join
 With any native of th Ausonian line
 A foreign soninlaw shall come from far
 Such is our doom a chief renownd in war
 Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name
 And thro the conquerd world diffuse our fame
 Himself to be the man the fates require
 I firmly judge and what I judge desire

 He said and then on each bestowd a steed
 Three hundred horses in high stables fed
 Stood ready shining all and smoothly dressd
 Of these he chose the fairest and the best
 To mount the Trojan troop At his command
 The steeds caparisond with purple stand
 With golden trappings glorious to behold
 And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold
 Then to his absent guest the king decreed
 A pair of coursers born of heavnly breed
 Who from their nostrils breathd ethereal fire
 Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire
 By substituting mares producd on earth
 Whose wombs conceivd a more than mortal birth
 These draw the chariot which Latinus sends
 And the rich present to the prince commends
 Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne
 To their expecting lord with peace return

 But jealous Juno from Pachynus height
 As she from Argos took her airy flight
 Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight
 She saw the Trojan and his joyful train
 Descend upon the shore desert the main
 Design a town and with unhopd success
 Th embassadors return with promisd peace
 Then piercd with pain she shook her haughty head
 Sighd from her inward soul and thus she said
 O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes
 O fates of Troy which Junos fates oppose
 Could they not fall unpitied on the plain
 But slain revive and taken scape again
 When execrable Troy in ashes lay
 Thro fires and swords and seas they forcd their way
 Then vanquishd Juno must in vain contend
 Her rage disarmd her empire at an end
 Breathless and tird is all my fury spent
 Or does my glutted spleen at length relent
 As if t were little from their town to chase
 I thro the seas pursued their exild race
 Ingagd the heavns opposd the stormy main
 But billows roard and tempests ragd in vain
 What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done
 When these they overpass and those they shun
 On Tibers shores they land secure of fate
 Triumphant oer the storms and Junos hate
 Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe
 And Jove himself gave way to Cynthias wrath
 Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon
 What great offense had either people done
 But I the consort of the Thunderer
 Have wagd a long and unsuccessful war
 With various arts and arms in vain have toild
 And by a mortal man at length am foild
 If native powr prevail not shall I doubt
 To seek for needful succor from without
 If Jove and Heavn my just desires deny
 Hell shall the powr of Heavn and Jove supply
 Grant that the Fates have firmd by their decree
 The Trojan race to reign in Italy
 At least I can defer the nuptial day
 And with protracted wars the peace delay
 With blood the dear alliance shall be bought
 And both the people near destruction brought
 So shall the soninlaw and father join
 With ruin war and waste of either line
 O fatal maid thy marriage is endowd
 With Phrygian Latian and Rutulian blood
 Bellona leads thee to thy lovers hand
 Another queen brings forth another brand
 To burn with foreign fires another land
 A second Paris diffring but in name
 Shall fire his country with a second flame

 Thus having said she sinks beneath the ground
 With furious haste and shoots the Stygian sound
 To rouse Alecto from th infernal seat
 Of her dire sisters and their dark retreat
 This Fury fit for her intent she chose
 One who delights in wars and human woes
 Evn Pluto hates his own misshapen race
 Her sister Furies fly her hideous face
 So frightful are the forms the monster takes
 So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes
 Her Juno finds and thus inflames her spite
 O virgin daughter of eternal Night
 Give me this once thy labor to sustain
 My right and execute my just disdain
 Let not the Trojans with a feignd pretense
 Of profferd peace delude the Latian prince
 Expel from Italy that odious name
 And let not Juno suffer in her fame
 T is thine to ruin realms oerturn a state
 Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate
 And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate
 Thy hand oer towns the funral torch displays
 And forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways
 Now shake out thy fruitful breast the seeds
 Of envy discord and of cruel deeds
 Confound the peace establishd and prepare
 Their souls to hatred and their hands to war

 Smeard as she was with black Gorgonian blood
 The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood
 And on her wicker wings sublime thro night
 She to the Latian palace took her flight
 There sought the queens apartment stood before
 The peaceful threshold and besiegd the door
 Restless Amata lay her swelling breast
 Fird with disdain for Turnus dispossessd
 And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest
 From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes
 Her darling plague the favrite of her snakes
 With her full force she threw the poisonous dart
 And fixd it deep within Amatas heart
 That thus envenomd she might kindle rage
 And sacrifice to strife her house husbands age
 Unseen unfelt the fiery serpent skims
 Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs
 His baleful breath inspiring as he glides
 Now like a chain around her neck he rides
 Now like a fillet to her head repairs
 And with his circling volumes folds her hairs
 At first the silent venom slid with ease
 And seizd her cooler senses by degrees
 Then ere th infected mass was fird too far
 In plaintive accents she began the war
 And thus bespoke her husband Shall she said
 A wandring prince enjoy Lavinias bed
 If nature plead not in a parents heart
 Pity my tears and pity her desert
 I know my dearest lord the time will come
 You in vain reverse your cruel doom
 The faithless pirate soon will set to sea
 And bear the royal virgin far away
 A guest like him a Trojan guest before
 In shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore
 And ravishd Helen from her husband bore
 Think on a kings inviolable word
 And think on Turnus her once plighted lord
 To this false foreigner you give your throne
 And wrong a friend a kinsman and a son
 Resume your ancient care and if the god
 Your sire and you resolve on foreign blood
 Know all are foreign in a larger sense
 Not born your subjects or derivd from hence
 Then if the line of Turnus you retrace
 He springs from Inachus of Argive race

 But when she saw her reasons idly spent
 And could not move him from his fixd intent
 She flew to rage for now the snake possessd
 Her vital parts and poisond all her breast
 She raves she runs with a distracted pace
 And fills with horrid howls the public place
 And as young striplings whip the top for sport
 On the smooth pavement of an empty court
 The wooden engine flies and whirls about
 Admird with clamors of the beardless rout
 They lash aloud each other they provoke
 And lend their little souls at evry stroke
 Thus fares the queen and thus her fury blows
 Amidst the crowd and kindles as she goes
 Nor yet content she strains her malice more
 And adds new ills to those contrivd before
 She flies the town and mixing with a throng
 Of madding matrons bears the bride along
 Wandring thro woods and wilds and devious ways
 And with these arts the Trojan match delays
 She feignd the rites of Bacchus cried aloud
 And to the buxom god the virgin vowd
 Evoe O Bacchus thus began the song
 And Evoe answerd all the female throng
 O virgin worthy thee alone she cried
 O worthy thee alone the crew replied
 For thee she feeds her hair she leads thy dance
 And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance
 Like fury seizd the rest the progress known
 All seek the mountains and forsake the town
 All clad in skins of beasts the javlin bear
 Give to the wanton winds their flowing hair
 And shrieks and shoutings rend the suffring air
 The queen herself inspird with rage divine
 Shook high above her head a flaming pine
 Then rolld her haggard eyes around the throng
 And sung in Turnus name the nuptial song
 Io ye Latian dames if any here
 Hold your unhappy queen Amata dear
 If there be here she said who dare maintain
 My right nor think the name of mother vain
 Unbind your fillets loose your flowing hair
 And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare

 Amatas breast the Fury thus invades
 And fires with rage amid the sylvan shades
 Then when she found her venom spread so far
 The royal house embroild in civil war
 Raisd on her dusky wings she cleaves the skies
 And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies
 His town as fame reports was built of old
 By Danae pregnant with almighty gold
 Who fled her fathers rage and with a train
 Of following Argives thro the stormy main
 Drivn by the southern blasts was fated here to reign
 T was Ardua once now Ardeas name it bears
 Once a fair city now consumd with years
 Here in his lofty palace Turnus lay
 Betwixt the confines of the night and day
 Secure in sleep The Fury laid aside
 Her looks and limbs and with new methods tried
 The foulness of th infernal form to hide
 Proppd on a staff she takes a trembling mien
 Her face is furrowd and her front obscene
 Deepdinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws
 Sunk are her eyes and toothless are her jaws
 Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound
 Her temples with an olive wreath are crownd
 Old Chalybe who kept the sacred fane
 Of Juno now she seemd and thus began
 Appearing in a dream to rouse the careless man
 Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain
 In fighting fields and conquer towns in vain
 Win for a Trojan head to wear the prize
 Usurp thy crown enjoy thy victories
 The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought
 The king transfers and foreign heirs are sought
 Go now deluded man and seek again
 New toils new dangers on the dusty plain
 Repel the Tuscan foes their city seize
 Protect the Latians in luxurious ease
 This dream allpowrful Juno sends I bear
 Her mighty mandates and her words you hear
 Haste arm your Ardeans issue to the plain
 With fate to friend assault the Trojan train
 Their thoughtless chiefs their painted ships that lie
 In Tibers mouth with fire and sword destroy
 The Latian king unless he shall submit
 Own his old promise and his new forget
 Let him in arms the powr of Turnus prove
 And learn to fear whom he disdains to love
 For such is Heavns command The youthful prince
 With scorn replied and made this bold defense
 You tell me mother what I knew before
 The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore
 I neither fear nor will provoke the war
 My fate is Junos most peculiar care
 But time has made you dote and vainly tell
 Of arms imagind in your lonely cell
 Go be the temple and the gods your care
 Permit to men the thought of peace and war

 These haughty words Alectos rage provoke
 And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke
 Her eyes grow stiffend and with sulphur burn
 Her hideous looks and hellish form return
 Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place
 And open all the furies of her face
 Then darting fire from her malignant eyes
 She cast him backward as he strove to rise
 And lingring sought to frame some new replies
 High on her head she rears two twisted snakes
 Her chains she rattles and her whip she shakes
 And churning bloody foam thus loudly speaks
 Behold whom time has made to dote and tell
 Of arms imagind in her lonely cell
 Behold the Fates infernal minister
 War death destruction in my hand I bear

 Thus having said her smoldring torch impressd
 With her full force she plungd into his breast
 Aghast he wakd and starting from his bed
 Cold sweat in clammy drops his limbs oerspread
 Arms arms he cries my sword and shield prepare
 He breathes defiance blood and mortal war
 So when with crackling flames a caldron fries
 The bubbling waters from the bottom rise
 Above the brims they force their fiery way
 Black vapors climb aloft and cloud the day

 The peace polluted thus a chosen band
 He first commissions to the Latian land
 In threatning embassy then raisd the rest
 To meet in arms th intruding Trojan guest
 To force the foes from the Lavinian shore
 And Italys indangerd peace restore
 Himself alone an equal match he boasts
 To fight the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts
 The gods invokd the Rutuli prepare
 Their arms and warn each other to the war
 His beauty these and those his blooming age
 The rest his house and his own fame ingage

 While Turnus urges thus his enterprise
 The Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies
 New frauds invents and takes a steepy stand
 Which overlooks the vale with wide command
 Where fair Ascanius and his youthful train
 With horns and hounds a hunting match ordain
 And pitch their toils around the shady plain
 The Fury fires the pack they snuff they vent
 And feed their hungry nostrils with the scent
 Twas of a wellgrown stag whose antlers rise
 High oer his front his beams invade the skies
 From this light cause th infernal maid prepares
 The country churls to mischief hate and wars

 The stately beast the two Tyrrhidae bred
 Snatchd from his dams and the tame youngling fed
 Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring
 Tyrrheus chief ranger to the Latian king
 Their sister Silvia cherishd with her care
 The little wanton and did wreaths prepare
 To hang his budding horns with ribbons tied
 His tender neck and combd his silken hide
 And bathed his body Patient of command
 In time he grew and growing usd to hand
 He waited at his masters board for food
 Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood
 Where grazing all the day at night he came
 To his known lodgings and his country dame

 This household beast that usd the woodland grounds
 Was viewd at first by the young heros hounds
 As down the stream he swam to seek retreat
 In the cool waters and to quench his heat
 Ascanius young and eager of his game
 Soon bent his bow uncertain in his aim
 But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides
 Which piercd his bowels thro his panting sides
 The bleeding creature issues from the floods
 Possessd with fear and seeks his known abodes
 His old familiar hearth and household gods
 He falls he fills the house with heavy groans
 Implores their pity and his pain bemoans
 Young Silvia beats her breast and cries aloud
 For succor from the clownish neighborhood
 The churls assemble for the fiend who lay
 In the close woody covert urgd their way
 One with a brand yet burning from the flame
 Armd with a knotty club another came
 Whateer they catch or find without their care
 Their fury makes an instrument of war
 Tyrrheus the foster father of the beast
 Then clenchd a hatchet in his horny fist
 But held his hand from the descending stroke
 And left his wedge within the cloven oak
 To whet their courage and their rage provoke
 And now the goddess exercisd in ill
 Who watchd an hour to work her impious will
 Ascends the roof and to her crooked horn
 Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne
 Adds all her breath the rocks and woods around
 And mountains tremble at th infernal sound
 The sacred lake of Trivia from afar
 The Veline fountains and sulphureous Nar
 Shake at the baleful blast the signal of the war
 Young mothers wildly stare with fear possessd
 And strain their helpless infants to their breast

 The clowns a boistrous rude ungovernd crew
 With furious haste to the loud summons flew
 The powrs of Troy then issuing on the plain
 With fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain
 Not theirs a raw and unexperiencd train
 But a firm body of embattled men
 At first while fortune favord neither side
 The fight with clubs and burning brands was tried
 But now both parties reinforcd the fields
 Are bright with flaming swords and brazen shields
 A shining harvest either host displays
 And shoots against the sun with equal rays
 Thus when a blackbrowd gust begins to rise
 White foam at first on the curld ocean fries
 Then roars the main the billows mount the skies
 Till by the fury of the storm full blown
 The muddy bottom oer the clouds is thrown
 First Almon falls old Tyrrheus eldest care
 Piercd with an arrow from the distant war
 Fixd in his throat the flying weapon stood
 And stoppd his breath and drank his vital blood
 Huge heaps of slain around the body rise
 Among the rest the rich Galesus lies
 A good old man while peace he preachd in vain
 Amidst the madness of th unruly train
 Five herds five bleating flocks his pastures filld
 His lands a hundred yoke of oxen tilld

 Thus while in equal scales their fortune stood
 The Fury bathd them in each others blood
 Then having fixd the fight exulting flies
 And bears fulfilld her promise to the skies
 To Juno thus she speaks Behold It is done
 The blood already drawn the war begun
 The discord is complete nor can they cease
 The dire debate nor you command the peace
 Now since the Latian and the Trojan brood
 Have tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood
 Speak and my powr shall add this office more
 The neighbing nations of th Ausonian shore
 Shall hear the dreadful rumor from afar
 Of armd invasion and embrace the war
 Then Juno thus The grateful work is done
 The seeds of discord sowd the war begun
 Frauds fears and fury have possessd the state
 And fixd the causes of a lasting hate
 A bloody Hymen shall th alliance join
 Betwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line
 But thou with speed to night and hell repair
 For not the gods nor angry Jove will bear
 Thy lawless wandring walks in upper air
 Leave what remains to me Saturnia said
 The sullen fiend her sounding wings displayd
 Unwilling left the light and sought the nether shade

 In midst of Italy well known to fame
 There lies a lake Amsanctus is the name
 Below the lofty mounts on either side
 Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide
 Full in the center of the sacred wood
 An arm arises of the Stygian flood
 Which breaking from beneath with bellowing sound
 Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around
 Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell
 And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell
 To this infernal lake the Fury flies
 Here hides her hated head and frees the labring skies

 Saturnian Juno now with double care
 Attends the fatal process of the war
 The clowns returnd from battle bear the slain
 Implore the gods and to their king complain
 The corps of Almon and the rest are shown
 Shrieks clamors murmurs fill the frighted town
 Ambitious Turnus in the press appears
 And aggravating crimes augments their fears
 Proclaims his private injuries aloud
 A solemn promise made and disavowd
 A foreign son is sought and a mixd mungril brood
 Then they whose mothers frantic with their fear
 In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear
 And lead his dances with disheveld hair
 Increase the clamor and the war demand
 Such was Amatas interest in the land
 Against the public sanctions of the peace
 Against all omens of their ill success
 With fates averse the rout in arms resort
 To force their monarch and insult the court
 But like a rock unmovd a rock that braves
 The raging tempest and the rising waves
 Proppd on himself he stands his solid sides
 Wash off the seaweeds and the sounding tides
 So stood the pious prince unmovd and long
 Sustaind the madness of the noisy throng
 But when he found that Junos powr prevaild
 And all the methods of cool counsel faild
 He calls the gods to witness their offense
 Disclaims the war asserts his innocence
 Hurried by fate he cries and borne before
 A furious wind we have the faithful shore
 O more than madmen you yourselves shall bear
 The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war
 Thou Turnus shalt atone it by thy fate
 And pray to Heavn for peace but pray too late
 For me my stormy voyage at an end
 I to the port of death securely tend
 The funral pomp which to your kings you pay
 Is all I want and all you take away
 He said no more but in his walls confind
 Shut out the woes which he too well divind
 Nor with the rising storm would vainly strive
 But left the helm and let the vessel drive

 A solemn custom was observd of old
 Which Latium held and now the Romans hold
 Their standard when in fighting fields they rear
 Against the fierce Hyrcanians or declare
 The Scythian Indian or Arabian war
 Or from the boasting Parthians would regain
 Their eagles lost in Carrhaes bloody plain
 Two gates of steel the name of Mars they bear
 And still are worshipd with religious fear
 Before his temple stand the dire abode
 And the feard issues of the furious god
 Are fencd with brazen bolts without the gates
 The wary guardian Janus doubly waits
 Then when the sacred senate votes the wars
 The Roman consul their decree declares
 And in his robes the sounding gates unbars
 The youth in military shouts arise
 And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies
 These rites of old by sovreign princes usd
 Were the kings office but the king refusd
 Deaf to their cries nor would the gates unbar
 Of sacred peace or loose th imprisond war
 But hid his head and safe from loud alarms
 Abhorrd the wicked ministry of arms
 Then heavns imperious queen shot down from high
 At her approach the brazen hinges fly
 The gates are forcd and evry falling bar
 And like a tempest issues out the war

 The peaceful cities of th Ausonian shore
 Lulld in their ease and undisturbd before
 Are all on fire and some with studious care
 Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare
 Some their soft limbs in painful marches try
 And war is all their wish and arms the genral cry
 Part scour the rusty shields with seam and part
 New grind the blunted ax and point the dart
 With joy they view the waving ensigns fly
 And hear the trumpets clangor pierce the sky
 Five cities forge their arms th Atinian powrs
 Antemnae Tibur with her lofty towrs
 Ardea the proud the Crustumerian town
 All these of old were places of renown
 Some hammer helmets for the fighting field
 Some twine young sallows to support the shield
 The croslet some and some the cuishes mold
 With silver plated and with ductile gold
 The rustic honors of the scythe and share
 Give place to swords and plumes the pride of war
 Old fauchions are new temperd in the fires
 The sounding trumpet evry soul inspires
 The word is givn with eager speed they lace
 The shining headpiece and the shield embrace
 The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied
 The trusty weapon sits on evry side

 And now the mighty labor is begun
 Ye Muses open all your Helicon
 Sing you the chiefs that swayd th Ausonian land
 Their arms and armies under their command
 What warriors in our ancient clime were bred
 What soldiers followd and what heroes led
 For well you know and can record alone
 What fame to future times conveys but darkly down
 Mezentius first appeard upon the plain
 Scorn sate upon his brows and sour disdain
 Defying earth and heavn Etruria lost
 He brings to Turnus aid his baffled host
 The charming Lausus full of youthful fire
 Rode in the rank and next his sullen sire
 To Turnus only second in the grace
 Of manly mien and features of the face
 A skilful horseman and a huntsman bred
 With fates averse a thousand men he led
 His sire unworthy of so brave a son
 Himself well worthy of a happier throne

 Next Aventinus drives his chariot round
 The Latian plains with palms and laurels crownd
 Proud of his steeds he smokes along the field
 His fathers hydra fills his ample shield
 A hundred serpents hiss about the brims
 The son of Hercules he justly seems
 By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs
 Of heavnly part and part of earthly blood
 A mortal woman mixing with a god
 For strong Alcides after he had slain
 The triple Geryon drove from conquerd Spain
 His captive herds and thence in triumph led
 On Tuscan Tibers flowry banks they fed
 Then on Mount Aventine the son of Jove
 The priestess Rhea found and forcd to love
 For arms his men long piles and javlins bore
 And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore
 Like Hercules himself his son appears
 In salvage pomp a lions hide he wears
 About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin
 The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin
 Thus like the god his father homely dressd
 He strides into the hall a horrid guest

 Then two twin brothers from fair Tibur came
 Which from their brother Tiburs took the name
 Fierce Coras and Catillus void of fear
 Armd Argive horse they led and in the front appear
 Like cloudborn Centaurs from the mountains height
 With rapid course descending to the fight
 They rush along the rattling woods give way
 The branches bend before their sweepy sway

 Nor was Praenestes founder wanting there
 Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber
 Found in the fire and fosterd in the plains
 A shepherd and a king at once he reigns
 And leads to Turnus aid his country swains
 His own Praeneste sends a chosen band
 With those who plow Saturnias Gabine land
 Besides the succor which cold Anien yields
 The rocks of Hernicus and dewy fields
 Anagnia fat and Father Amasene
 A numrous rout but all of naked men
 Nor arms they wear nor swords and bucklers wield
 Nor drive the chariot thro the dusty field
 But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead
 And spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head
 The left foot naked when they march to fight
 But in a bulls raw hide they sheathe the right
 Messapus next great Neptune was his sire
 Secure of steel and fated from the fire
 In pomp appears and with his ardor warms
 A heartless train unexercisd in arms
 The just Faliscans he to battle brings
 And those who live where Lake Ciminia springs
 And where Feronias grove and temple stands
 Who till Fescennian or Flavinian lands
 All these in order march and marching sing
 The warlike actions of their seaborn king
 Like a long team of snowy swans on high
 Which clap their wings and cleave the liquid sky
 When homeward from their watry pastures borne
 They sing and Asias lakes their notes return
 Not one who heard their music from afar
 Would think these troops an army traind to war
 But flocks of fowl that when the tempests roar
 With their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore

 Then Clausus came who led a numrous band
 Of troops embodied from the Sabine land
 And in himself alone an army brought
 T was he the noble Claudian race begot
 The Claudian race ordaind in times to come
 To share the greatness of imperial Rome
 He led the Cures forth of old renown
 Mutuscans from their olivebearing town
 And all th Eretian powrs besides a band
 That followd from Velinums dewy land
 And Amiternian troops of mighty fame
 And mountaineers that from Severus came
 And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica
 And those where yellow Tiber takes his way
 And where Himellas wanton waters play
 Casperia sends her arms with those that lie
 By Fabaris and fruitful Foruli
 The warlike aids of Horta next appear
 And the cold Nursians come to close the rear
 Mixd with the natives born of Latine blood
 Whom Allia washes with her fatal flood
 Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main
 When pale Orion sets in wintry rain
 Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise
 Or Lycian fields when Phoebus burns the skies
 Than stand these troops their bucklers ring around
 Their trampling turns the turf and shakes the solid ground

 High in his chariot then Halesus came
 A foe by birth to Troys unhappy name
 From Agamemnon born to Turnus aid
 A thousand men the youthful hero led
 Who till the Massic soil for wine renownd
 And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground
 And those who live by Sidicinian shores
 And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars
 Cales and Oscas old inhabitants
 And rough Saticulans inurd to wants
 Light demilances from afar they throw
 Fastend with leathern thongs to gall the foe
 Short crooked swords in closer fight they wear
 And on their warding arm light bucklers bear

 Nor Oebalus shalt thou be left unsung
 From nymph Semethis and old Telon sprung
 Who then in Teleboan Capri reignd
 But that short isle th ambitious youth disdaind
 And oer Campania stretchd his ample sway
 Where swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea
 Oer Batulum and where Abella sees
 From her high towrs the harvest of her trees
 And these as was the Teuton use of old
 Wield brazen swords and brazen bucklers hold
 Sling weighty stones when from afar they fight
 Their casques are cork a covering thick and light

 Next these in rank the warlike Ufens went
 And led the mountain troops that Nursia sent
 The rude Equicolae his rule obeyd
 Hunting their sport and plundring was their trade
 In arms they plowd to battle still prepard
 Their soil was barren and their hearts were hard

 Umbro the priest the proud Marrubians led
 By King Archippus sent to Turnus aid
 And peaceful olives crownd his hoary head
 His wand and holy words the vipers rage
 And venomd wounds of serpents could assuage
 He when he pleasd with powerful juice to steep
 Their temples shut their eyes in pleasing sleep
 But vain were Marsian herbs and magic art
 To cure the wound givn by the Dardan dart
 Yet his untimely fate th Angitian woods
 In sighs remurmurd to the Fucine floods

 The son of famd Hippolytus was there
 Famd as his sire and as his mother fair
 Whom in Egerian groves Aricia bore
 And nursd his youth along the marshy shore
 Where great Dianas peaceful altars flame
 In fruitful fields and Virbius was his name
 Hippolytus as old records have said
 Was by his stepdam sought to share her bed
 But when no female arts his mind could move
 She turnd to furious hate her impious love
 Torn by wild horses on the sandy shore
 Anothers crimes th unhappy hunter bore
 Glutting his fathers eyes with guiltless gore
 But chaste Diana who his death deplord
 With Aesculapian herbs his life restord
 Then Jove who saw from high with just disdain
 The dead inspird with vital breath again
 Struck to the center with his flaming dart
 Th unhappy founder of the godlike art
 But Trivia kept in secret shades alone
 Her care Hippolytus to fate unknown
 And calld him Virbius in th Egerian grove
 Where then he livd obscure but safe from Jove
 For this from Trivias temple and her wood
 Are coursers drivn who shed their masters blood
 Affrighted by the monsters of the flood
 His son the second Virbius yet retaind
 His fathers art and warrior steeds he reind

 Amid the troops and like the leading god
 High oer the rest in arms the graceful Turnus rode
 A triple of plumes his crest adornd
 On which with belching flames Chimaera burnd
 The more the kindled combat rises highr
 The more with fury burns the blazing fire
 Fair Io gracd his shield but Io now
 With horns exalted stands and seems to low
 A noble charge Her keeper by her side
 To watch her walks his hundred eyes applied
 And on the brims her sire the watry god
 Rolld from a silver urn his crystal flood
 A cloud of foot succeeds and fills the fields
 With swords and pointed spears and clattring shields
 Of Argives and of old Sicanian bands
 And those who plow the rich Rutulian lands
 Auruncan youth and those Sacrana yields
 And the proud Labicans with painted shields
 And those who near Numician streams reside
 And those whom Tibers holy forests hide
 Or Circes hills from the main land divide
 Where Ufens glides along the lowly lands
 Or the black water of Pomptina stands

 Last from the Volscians fair Camilla came
 And led her warlike troops a warrior dame
 Unbred to spinning in the loom unskilld
 She chose the nobler Pallas of the field
 Mixd with the first the fierce virago fought
 Sustaind the toils of arms the danger sought
 Outstrippd the winds in speed upon the plain
 Flew oer the fields nor hurt the bearded grain
 She swept the seas and as she skimmd along
 Her flying feet unbathd on billows hung
 Men boys and women stupid with surprise
 Whereer she passes fix their wondring eyes
 Longing they look and gaping at the sight
 Devour her oer and oer with vast delight
 Her purple habit sits with such a grace
 On her smooth shoulders and so suits her face
 Her head with ringlets of her hair is crownd
 And in a golden caul the curls are bound
 She shakes her myrtle javlin and behind
 Her Lycian quiver dances in the wind




 BOOK VIII

 When Turnus had assembled all his powrs
 His standard planted on Laurentums towrs
 When now the sprightly trumpet from afar
 Had givn the signal of approaching war
 Had rousd the neighing steeds to scour the fields
 While the fierce riders clatterd on their shields
 Trembling with rage the Latian youth prepare
 To join th allies and headlong rush to war
 Fierce Ufens and Messapus led the crowd
 With bold Mezentius who blasphemd aloud
 These thro the country took their wasteful course
 The fields to forage and to gather force
 Then Venulus to Diomede they send
 To beg his aid Ausonia to defend
 Declare the common danger and inform
 The Grecian leader of the growing storm
 Aeneas landed on the Latian coast
 With banishd gods and with a baffled host
 Yet now aspird to conquest of the state
 And claimd a title from the gods and fate
 What numrous nations in his quarrel came
 And how they spread his formidable name
 What he designd what mischief might arise
 If fortune favord his first enterprise
 Was left for him to weigh whose equal fears
 And common interest was involvd in theirs

 While Turnus and th allies thus urge the war
 The Trojan floating in a flood of care
 Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare
 This way and that he turns his anxious mind
 Thinks and rejects the counsels he designd
 Explores himself in vain in evry part
 And gives no rest to his distracted heart
 So when the sun by day or moon by night
 Strike on the polishd brass their trembling light
 The glittring species here and there divide
 And cast their dubious beams from side to side
 Now on the walls now on the pavement play
 And to the ceiling flash the glaring day

 T was night and weary nature lulld asleep
 The birds of air and fishes of the deep
 And beasts and mortal men The Trojan chief
 Was laid on Tibers banks oppressd with grief
 And found in silent slumber late relief
 Then thro the shadows of the poplar wood
 Arose the father of the Roman flood
 An azure robe was oer his body spread
 A wreath of shady reeds adornd his head
 Thus manifest to sight the god appeard
 And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheerd
 Undoubted offspring of ethereal race
 O long expected in this promisd place
 Who thro the foes hast borne thy banishd gods
 Restord them to their hearths and old abodes
 This is thy happy home the clime where fate
 Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state
 Fear not The war shall end in lasting peace
 And all the rage of haughty Juno cease
 And that this nightly vision may not seem
 Th effect of fancy or an idle dream
 A sow beneath an oak shall lie along
 All white herself and white her thirty young
 When thirty rolling years have run their race
 Thy son Ascanius on this empty space
 Shall build a royal town of lasting fame
 Which from this omen shall receive the name
 Time shall approve the truth For what remains
 And how with sure success to crown thy pains
 With patience next attend A banishd band
 Drivn with Evander from th Arcadian land
 Have planted here and placd on high their walls
 Their town the founder Pallanteum calls
 Derivd from Pallas his greatgrandsires name
 But the fierce Latians old possession claim
 With war infesting the new colony
 These make thy friends and on their aid rely
 To thy free passage I submit my streams
 Wake son of Venus from thy pleasing dreams
 And when the setting stars are lost in day
 To Junos powr thy just devotion pay
 With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease
 Her pride at length shall fall her fury cease
 When thou returnst victorious from the war
 Perform thy vows to me with grateful care
 The god am I whose yellow water flows
 Around these fields and fattens as it goes
 Tiber my name among the rolling floods
 Renownd on earth esteemd among the gods
 This is my certain seat In times to come
 My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome

 He said and plungd below While yet he spoke
 His dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook
 He rose and looking up beheld the skies
 With purple blushing and the day arise
 Then water in his hollow palm he took
 From Tibers flood and thus the powrs bespoke
 Laurentian nymphs by whom the streams are fed
 And Father Tiber in thy sacred bed
 Receive Aeneas and from danger keep
 Whatever fount whatever holy deep
 Conceals thy watry stores whereer they rise
 And bubbling from below salute the skies
 Thou king of horned floods whose plenteous urn
 Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn
 For this thy kind compassion of our woes
 Shalt share my morning song and evning vows
 But O be present to thy peoples aid
 And firm the gracious promise thou hast made
 Thus having said two galleys from his stores
 With care he chooses mans and fits with oars
 Now on the shore the fatal swine is found
 Wondrous to tell She lay along the ground
 Her wellfed offspring at her udders hung
 She white herself and white her thirty young
 Aeneas takes the mother and her brood
 And all on Junos altar are bestowd

 The follwing night and the succeeding day
 Propitious Tiber smoothd his watry way
 He rolld his river back and poisd he stood
 A gentle swelling and a peaceful flood
 The Trojans mount their ships they put from shore
 Borne on the waves and scarcely dip an oar
 Shouts from the land give omen to their course
 And the pitchd vessels glide with easy force
 The woods and waters wonder at the gleam
 Of shields and painted ships that stem the stream
 One summers night and one whole day they pass
 Betwixt the greenwood shades and cut the liquid glass
 The fiery sun had finishd half his race
 Lookd back and doubted in the middle space
 When they from far beheld the rising towrs
 The tops of sheds and shepherds lowly bowrs
 Thin as they stood which then of homely clay
 Now rise in marble from the Roman sway
 These cots Evanders kingdom mean and poor
 The Trojan saw and turnd his ships to shore
 T was on a solemn day th Arcadian states
 The king and prince without the city gates
 Then paid their offrings in a sacred grove
 To Hercules the warrior son of Jove
 Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies
 And fat of entrails on his altar fries

 But when they saw the ships that stemmd the flood
 And glitterd thro the covert of the wood
 They rose with fear and left th unfinishd feast
 Till dauntless Pallas reassurd the rest
 To pay the rites Himself without delay
 A javlin seizd and singly took his way
 Then gaind a rising ground and calld from far
 Resolve me strangers whence and what you are
 Your busness here and bring you peace or war
 High on the stern Aeneas his stand
 And held a branch of olive in his hand
 While thus he spoke The Phrygians arms you see
 Expelld from Troy provokd in Italy
 By Latian foes with war unjustly made
 At first affiancd and at last betrayd
 This message bear The Trojans and their chief
 Bring holy peace and beg the kings relief
 Struck with so great a name and all on fire
 The youth replies Whatever you require
 Your fame exacts Upon our shores descend
 A welcome guest and what you wish a friend
 He said and downward hasting to the strand
 Embracd the stranger prince and joind his hand

 Conducted to the grove Aeneas broke
 The silence first and thus the king bespoke
 Best of the Greeks to whom by fates command
 I bear these peaceful branches in my hand
 Undaunted I approach you tho I know
 Your birth is Grecian and your land my foe
 From Atreus tho your ancient lineage came
 And both the brother kings your kindred claim
 Yet my selfconscious worth your high renown
 Your virtue thro the neighbring nations blown
 Our fathers mingled blood Apollos voice
 Have led me hither less by need than choice
 Our founder Dardanus as fame has sung
 And Greeks acknowledge from Electra sprung
 Electra from the loins of Atlas came
 Atlas whose head sustains the starry frame
 Your sire is Mercury whom long before
 On cold Cyllenes top fair Maia bore
 Maia the fair on fame if we rely
 Was Atlas daughter who sustains the sky
 Thus from one common source our streams divide
 Ours is the Trojan yours th Arcadian side
 Raisd by these hopes I sent no news before
 Nor askd your leave nor did your faith implore
 But come without a pledge my own ambassador
 The same Rutulians who with arms pursue
 The Trojan race are equal foes to you
 Our host expelld what farther force can stay
 The victor troops from universal sway
 Then will they stretch their powr athwart the land
 And either sea from side to side command
 Receive our offerd faith and give us thine
 Ours is a genrous and experiencd line
 We want not hearts nor bodies for the war
 In council cautious and in fields we dare

 He said and while spoke with piercing eyes
 Evander viewd the man with vast surprise
 Pleasd with his action ravishd with his face
 Then answerd briefly with a royal grace
 O valiant leader of the Trojan line
 In whom the features of thy father shine
 How I recall Anchises how I see
 His motions mien and all my friend in thee
 Long tho it be t is fresh within my mind
 When Priam to his sisters court designd
 A welcome visit with a friendly stay
 And thro th Arcadian kingdom took his way
 Then past a boy the callow down began
 To shade my chin and call me first a man
 I saw the shining train with vast delight
 And Priams goodly person pleasd my sight
 But great Anchises far above the rest
 With awful wonder fird my youthful breast
 I longd to join in friendships holy bands
 Our mutual hearts and plight our mutual hands
 I first accosted him I sued I sought
 And with a loving force to Pheneus brought
 He gave me when at length constraind to go
 A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow
 A vest embroiderd glorious to behold
 And two rich bridles with their bits of gold
 Which my sons coursers in obedience hold
 The league you ask I offer as your right
 And when tomorrows sun reveals the light
 With swift supplies you shall be sent away
 Now celebrate with us this solemn day
 Whose holy rites admit no long delay
 Honor our annual feast and take your seat
 With friendly welcome at a homely treat
 Thus having said the bowls removd for fear
 The youths replacd and soon restord the cheer
 On sods of turf he set the soldiers round
 A maple throne raisd higher from the ground
 Receivd the Trojan chief and oer the bed
 A lions shaggy hide for ornament they spread
 The loaves were servd in canisters the wine
 In bowls the priest renewd the rites divine
 Broild entrails are their food and beefs continued chine

 But when the rage of hunger was repressd
 Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest
 These rites these altars and this feast O king
 From no vain fears or superstition spring
 Or blind devotion or from blinder chance
 Or heady zeal or brutal ignorance
 But savd from danger with a grateful sense
 The labors of a god we recompense
 See from afar yon rock that mates the sky
 About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie
 Such indigested ruin bleak and bare
 How desart now it stands exposd in air
 T was once a robbers den inclosd around
 With living stone and deep beneath the ground
 The monster Cacus more than half a beast
 This hold impervious to the sun possessd
 The pavement ever foul with human gore
 Heads and their mangled members hung the door
 Vulcan this plague begot and like his sire
 Black clouds he belchd and flakes of livid fire
 Time long expected easd us of our load
 And brought the needful presence of a god
 Th avenging force of Hercules from Spain
 Arrivd in triumph from Geryon slain
 Thrice livd the giant and thrice livd in vain
 His prize the lowing herds Alcides drove
 Near Tibers bank to graze the shady grove
 Allurd with hope of plunder and intent
 By force to rob by fraud to circumvent
 The brutal Cacus as by chance they strayd
 Four oxen thence and four fair kine conveyd
 And lest the printed footsteps might be seen
 He draggd em backwards to his rocky den
 The tracks averse a lying notice gave
 And led the searcher backward from the cave

 Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place
 To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass
 The beasts who missd their mates filld all around
 With bellowings and the rocks restord the sound
 One heifer who had heard her love complain
 Roard from the cave and made the project vain
 Alcides found the fraud with rage he shook
 And tossd about his head his knotted oak
 Swift as the winds or Scythian arrows flight
 He clomb with eager haste th aerial height
 Then first we saw the monster mend his pace
 Fear his eyes and paleness in his face
 Confessd the gods approach Trembling he springs
 As terror had increasd his feet with wings
 Nor stayd for stairs but down the depth he threw
 His body on his back the door he drew
 The door a rib of living rock with pains
 His father hewd it out and bound with iron chains
 He broke the heavy links the mountain closd
 And bars and levers to his foe opposd
 The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast
 The fierce avenger came with bounding haste
 Surveyd the mouth of the forbidden hold
 And here and there his raging eyes he rolld
 He gnashd his teeth and thrice he compassd round
 With winged speed the circuit of the ground
 Thrice at the caverns mouth he pulld in vain
 And panting thrice desisted from his pain
 A pointed flinty rock all bare and black
 Grew gibbous from behind the mountains back
 Owls ravens all ill omens of the night
 Here built their nests and hither wingd their flight
 The leaning head hung threatning oer the flood
 And nodded to the left The hero stood
 Adverse with planted feet and from the right
 Tuggd at the solid stone with all his might
 Thus heavd the fixd foundations of the rock
 Gave way heavn echod at the rattling shock
 Tumbling it chokd the flood on either side
 The banks leap backward and the streams divide
 The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread
 And trembling Tiber divd beneath his bed
 The court of Cacus stands reveald to sight
 The cavern glares with newadmitted light
 So the pent vapors with a rumbling sound
 Heave from below and rend the hollow ground
 A sounding flaw succeeds and from on high
 The gods with hate beheld the nether sky
 The ghosts repine at violated night
 And curse th invading sun and sicken at the sight
 The graceless monster caught in open day
 Inclosd and in despair to fly away
 Howls horrible from underneath and fills
 His hollow palace with unmanly yells
 The hero stands above and from afar
 Plies him with darts and stones and distant war
 He from his nostrils huge mouth expires
 Black clouds of smoke amidst his fathers fires
 Gathring with each repeated blast the night
 To make uncertain aim and erring sight
 The wrathful god then plunges from above
 And where in thickest waves the sparkles drove
 There lights and wades thro fumes and gropes his way
 Half singd half stifled till he grasps his prey
 The monster spewing fruitless flames he found
 He squeezd his throat he writhd his neck around
 And in a knot his crippled members bound
 Then from their sockets tore his burning eyes
 Rolld on a heap the breathless robber lies
 The doors unbarrd receive the rushing day
 And thoro lights disclose the ravishd prey
 The bulls redeemd breathe open air again
 Next by the feet they drag him from his den
 The wondring neighborhood with glad surprise
 Behold his shagged breast his giant size
 His mouth that flames no more and his extinguishd eyes
 From that auspicious day with rites divine
 We worship at the heros holy shrine
 Potitius first ordaind these annual vows
 As priests were added the Pinarian house
 Who raisd this altar in the sacred shade
 Where honors ever due for ever shall be paid
 For these deserts and this high virtue shown
 Ye warlike youths your heads with garlands crown
 Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood
 And with deep draughts invoke our common god

 This said a double wreath Evander twind
 And poplars black and white his temples bind
 Then brims his ample bowl With like design
 The rest invoke the gods with sprinkled wine
 Meantime the sun descended from the skies
 And the bright evening star began to rise
 And now the priests Potitius at their head
 In skins of beasts involvd the long procession led
 Held high the flaming tapers in their hands
 As custom had prescribd their holy bands
 Then with a second course the tables load
 And with full chargers offer to the god
 The Salii sing and cense his altars round
 With Saban smoke their heads with poplar bound
 One choir of old another of the young
 To dance and bear the burthen of the song
 The lay records the labors and the praise
 And all th immortal acts of Hercules
 First how the mighty babe when swathd in bands
 The serpents strangled with his infant hands
 Then as in years and matchless force he grew
 Th Oechalian walls and Trojan overthrew
 Besides a thousand hazards they relate
 Procurd by Junos and Eurystheus hate
 Thy hands unconquerd hero could subdue
 The cloudborn Centaurs and the monster crew
 Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood
 Nor he the roaring terror of the wood
 The triple porter of the Stygian seat
 With lolling tongue lay fawning at thy feet
 And seizd with fear forgot his mangled meat
 Th infernal waters trembled at thy sight
 Thee god no face of danger could affright
 Not huge Typhoeus nor th unnumberd snake
 Increasd with hissing heads in Lernas lake
 Hail Joves undoubted son an added grace
 To heavn and the great author of thy race
 Receive the grateful offrings which we pay
 And smile propitious on thy solemn day
 In numbers thus they sung above the rest
 The den and death of Cacus crown the feast
 The woods to hollow vales convey the sound
 The vales to hills and hills the notes rebound
 The rites performd the cheerful train retire

 Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire
 The Trojan passd the city to survey
 And pleasing talk beguild the tedious way
 The stranger cast around his curious eyes
 New objects viewing still with new surprise
 With greedy joy enquires of various things
 And acts and monuments of ancient kings
 Then thus the founder of the Roman towrs
 These woods were first the seat of sylvan powrs
 Of Nymphs and Fauns and salvage men who took
 Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak
 Nor laws they knew nor manners nor the care
 Of labring oxen or the shining share
 Nor arts of gain nor what they gaind to spare
 Their exercise the chase the running flood
 Supplied their thirst the trees supplied their food
 Then Saturn came who fled the powr of Jove
 Robbd of his realms and banishd from above
 The men dispersd on hills to towns he brought
 And laws ordaind and civil customs taught
 And Latium calld the land where safe he lay
 From his unduteous son and his usurping sway
 With his mild empire peace and plenty came
 And hence the golden times derivd their name
 A more degenerate and discolord age
 Succeeded this with avarice and rage
 Th Ausonians then and bold Sicanians came
 And Saturns empire often changd the name
 Then kings gigantic Tybris and the rest
 With arbitrary sway the land oppressd
 For Tibers flood was Albula before
 Till from the tyrants fate his name it bore
 I last arrivd drivn from my native home
 By fortunes powr and fates resistless doom
 Long tossd on seas I sought this happy land
 Warnd by my mother nymph and calld by Heavns command

 Thus walking on he spoke and shewd the gate
 Since calld Carmental by the Roman state
 Where stood an altar sacred to the name
 Of old Carmenta the prophetic dame
 Who to her son foretold th Aenean race
 Sublime in fame and Romes imperial place
 Then shews the forest which in after times
 Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes
 A sacred refuge made with this the shrine
 Where Pan below the rock had rites divine
 Then tells of Argus death his murderd guest
 Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest
 Thence to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads
 Now roofd with gold then thatchd with homely reeds
 A reverent fear such superstition reigns
 Among the rude evn then possessd the swains
 Some god they knew what god they could not tell
 Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell
 Th Arcadians thought him Jove and said they saw
 The mighty Thundrer with majestic awe
 Who took his shield and dealt his bolts around
 And scatterd tempests on the teeming ground
 Then saw two heaps of ruins once they stood
 Two stately towns on either side the flood
 Saturnias and Janiculas remains
 And either place the founders name retains
 Discoursing thus together they resort
 Where poor Evander kept his country court
 They viewd the ground of Romes litigious hall
 Once oxen lowd where now the lawyers bawl
 Then stooping thro the narrow gate they pressd
 When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest
 Mean as it is this palace and this door
 Receivd Alcides then a conqueror
 Dare to be poor accept our homely food
 Which feasted him and emulate a god
 Then underneath a lowly roof he led
 The weary prince and laid him on a bed
 The stuffing leaves with hides of bears oerspread
 Now Night had shed her silver dews around
 And with her sable wings embracd the ground
 When loves fair goddess anxious for her son
 New tumults rising and new wars begun
 Couchd with her husband in his golden bed
 With these alluring words invokes his aid
 And that her pleasing speech his mind may move
 Inspires each accent with the charms of love
 While cruel fate conspird with Grecian powrs
 To level with the ground the Trojan towrs
 I askd not aid th unhappy to restore
 Nor did the succor of thy skill implore
 Nor urgd the labors of my lord in vain
 A sinking empire longer to sustain
 Thomuch I owd to Priams house and more
 The dangers of Aeneas did deplore
 But now by Joves command and fates decree
 His race is doomd to reign in Italy
 With humble suit I beg thy needful art
 O still propitious powr that rules my heart
 A mother kneels a suppliant for her son
 By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won
 To forge impenetrable shields and grace
 With fated arms a less illustrious race
 Behold what haughty nations are combind
 Against the relics of the Phrygian kind
 With fire and sword my people to destroy
 And conquer Venus twice in conquring Troy
 She said and straight her arms of snowy hue
 About her unresolving husband threw
 Her soft embraces soon infuse desire
 His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire
 And all the godhead feels the wonted fire
 Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies
 Or forky lightnings flash along the skies
 The goddess proud of her successful wiles
 And conscious of her form in secret smiles

 Then thus the powr obnoxious to her charms
 Panting and half dissolving in her arms
 Why seek you reasons for a cause so just
 Or your own beauties or my love distrust
 Long since had you requird my helpful hand
 Th artificer and art you might command
 To labor arms for Troy nor Jove nor fate
 Confind their empire to so short a date
 And if you now desire new wars to wage
 My skill I promise and my pains engage
 Whatever melting metals can conspire
 Or breathing bellows or the forming fire
 Is freely yours your anxious fears remove
 And think no task is difficult to love
 Trembling he spoke and eager of her charms
 He snatchd the willing goddess to his arms
 Till in her lap infusd he lay possessd
 Of full desire and sunk to pleasing rest
 Now when the Night her middle race had rode
 And his first slumber had refreshd the god
 The time when early housewives leave the bed
 When living embers on the hearth they spread
 Supply the lamp and call the maids to rise
 With yawning mouths and with halfopend eyes
 They ply the distaff by the winking light
 And to their daily labor add the night
 Thus frugally they earn their childrens bread
 And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed
 Not less concernd nor at a later hour
 Rose from his downy couch the forging powr

 Sacred to Vulcans name an isle there lay
 Betwixt Sicilias coasts and Lipare
 Raisd high on smoking rocks and deep below
 In hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow
 The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal
 Loud strokes and hissings of tormented steel
 Are heard around the boiling waters roar
 And smoky flames thro fuming tunnels soar
 Hether the Father of the Fire by night
 Thro the brown air precipitates his flight
 On their eternal anvils here he found
 The brethren beating and the blows go round
 A load of pointless thunder now there lies
 Before their hands to ripen for the skies
 These darts for angry Jove they daily cast
 Consumd on mortals with prodigious waste
 Three rays of writhen rain of fire three more
 Of winged southern winds and cloudy store
 As many parts the dreadful mixture frame
 And fears are added and avenging flame
 Inferior ministers for Mars repair
 His broken axletrees and blunted war
 And send him forth again with furbishd arms
 To wake the lazy war with trumpets loud alarms
 The rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold
 The shield of Pallas and renew their gold
 Full on the crest the Gorgons head they place
 With eyes that roll in death and with distorted face

 My sons said Vulcan set your tasks aside
 Your strength and masterskill must now be tried
 Arms for a hero forge arms that require
 Your force your speed and all your forming fire
 He said They set their former work aside
 And their new toils with eager haste divide
 A flood of molten silver brass and gold
 And deadly steel in the large furnace rolld
 Of this their artful hands a shield prepare
 Alone sufficient to sustain the war
 Sevn orbs within a spacious round they close
 One stirs the fire and one the bellows blows
 The hissing steel is in the smithy drownd
 The grot with beaten anvils groans around
 By turns their arms advance in equal time
 By turns their hands descend and hammers chime
 They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs
 The fiery work proceeds with rustic songs

 While at the Lemnian gods command they urge
 Their labors thus and ply th Aeolian forge
 The cheerful morn salutes Evanders eyes
 And songs of chirping birds invite to rise
 He leaves his lowly bed his buskins meet
 Above his ankles sandals sheathe his feet
 He sets his trusty sword upon his side
 And oer his shoulder throws a panthers hide
 Two menial dogs before their master pressd
 Thus clad and guarded thus he seeks his kingly guest
 Mindful of promisd aid he mends his pace
 But meets Aeneas in the middle space
 Young Pallas did his fathers steps attend
 And true Achates waited on his friend
 They join their hands a secret seat they choose
 Th Arcadian first their former talk renews
 Undaunted prince I never can believe
 The Trojan empire lost while you survive
 Command th assistance of a faithful friend
 But feeble are the succors I can send
 Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds
 That other side the Latian state surrounds
 Insults our walls and wastes our fruitful grounds
 But mighty nations I prepare to join
 Their arms with yours and aid your just design
 You come as by your better genius sent
 And fortune seems to favor your intent
 Not far from hence there stands a hilly town
 Of ancient building and of high renown
 Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race
 Who gave the name of Caere to the place
 Once Agyllina calld It flourishd long
 In pride of wealth and warlike people strong
 Till cursd Mezentius in a fatal hour
 Assumd the crown with arbitrary powr
 What words can paint those execrable times
 The subjects suffrings and the tyrants crimes
 That blood those murthers O ye gods replace
 On his own head and on his impious race
 The living and the dead at his command
 Were coupled face to face and hand to hand
 Till chokd with stench in loathd embraces tied
 The lingring wretches pind away and died
 Thus plungd in ills and meditating more
 The peoples patience tird no longer bore
 The raging monster but with arms beset
 His house and vengeance and destruction threat
 They fire his palace while the flame ascends
 They force his guards and execute his friends
 He cleaves the crowd and favord by the night
 To Turnus friendly court directs his flight
 By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire
 With arms their king to punishment require
 Their numrous troops now musterd on the strand
 My counsel shall submit to your command
 Their navy swarms upon the coasts they cry
 To hoist their anchors but the gods deny
 An ancient augur skilld in future fate
 With these foreboding words restrains their hate
 Ye brave in arms ye Lydian blood the flowr
 Of Tuscan youth and choice of all their powr
 Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms
 To seek your tyrants death by lawful arms
 Know this no native of our land may lead
 This powrful people seek a foreign head
 Awd with these words in camps they still abide
 And wait with longing looks their promisd guide
 Tarchon the Tuscan chief to me has sent
 Their crown and evry regal ornament
 The people join their own with his desire
 And all my conduct as their king require
 But the chill blood that creeps within my veins
 And age and listless limbs unfit for pains
 And a soul conscious of its own decay
 Have forcd me to refuse imperial sway
 My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne
 And should but hes a Sabine mothers son
 And half a native but in you combine
 A manly vigor and a foreign line
 Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way
 Pursue the ready path to sovreign sway
 The staff of my declining days my son
 Shall make your good or ill success his own
 In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare
 And serve the hard apprenticeship of war
 Your matchless courage and your conduct view
 And early shall begin t admire and copy you
 Besides two hundred horse he shall command
 Tho few a warlike and wellchosen band
 These in my name are listed and my son
 As many more has added in his own

 Scarce had he said Achates and his guest
 With downcast eyes their silent grief expressd
 Who short of succors and in deep despair
 Shook at the dismal prospect of the war
 But his bright mother from a breaking cloud
 To cheer her issue thunderd thrice aloud
 Thrice forky lightning flashd along the sky
 And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high
 Then gazing up repeated peals they hear
 And in a heavn serene refulgent arms appear
 Reddning the skies and glittring all around
 The temperd metals clash and yield a silver sound
 The rest stood trembling struck with awe divine
 Aeneas only conscious to the sign
 Presagd th event and joyful viewd above
 Th accomplishd promise of the Queen of Love
 Then to th Arcadian king This prodigy
 Dismiss your fear belongs alone to me
 Heavn calls me to the war th expected sign
 Is givn of promisd aid and arms divine
 My goddess mother whose indulgent care
 Foresaw the dangers of the growing war
 This omen gave when bright Vulcanian arms
 Fated from force of steel by Stygian charms
 Suspended shone on high she then foreshowd
 Approaching fights and fields to float in blood
 Turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn
 And corps and swords and shields on Tiber borne
 Shall choke his flood now sound the loud alarms
 And Latian troops prepare your perjurd arms

 He said and rising from his homely throne
 The solemn rites of Hercules begun
 And on his altars wakd the sleeping fires
 Then cheerful to his household gods retires
 There offers chosen sheep Th Arcadian king
 And Trojan youth the same oblations bring
 Next of his men and ships he makes review
 Draws out the best and ablest of the crew
 Down with the falling stream the refuse run
 To raise with joyful news his drooping son
 Steeds are prepard to mount the Trojan band
 Who wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land
 A sprightly courser fairer than the rest
 The king himself presents his royal guest
 A lions hide his back and limbs infold
 Precious with studded work and paws of gold
 Fame thro the little city spreads aloud
 Th intended march amid the fearful crowd
 The matrons beat their breasts dissolve in tears
 And double their devotion in their fears
 The war at hand appears with more affright
 And rises evry moment to the sight

 Then old Evander with a close embrace
 Straind his departing friend and tears oerflow his face
 Would Heavn said he my strength and youth recall
 Such as I was beneath Praenestes wall
 Then when I made the foremost foes retire
 And set whole heaps of conquerd shields on fire
 When Herilus in single fight I slew
 Whom with three lives Feronia did endue
 And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore
 Till the last ebbing soul returnd no more
 Such if I stood renewd not these alarms
 Nor death should rend me from my Pallas arms
 Nor proud Mezentius thus unpunishd boast
 His rapes and murthers on the Tuscan coast
 Ye gods and mighty Jove in pity bring
 Relief and hear a father and a king
 If fate and you reserve these eyes to see
 My son return with peace and victory
 If the lovd boy shall bless his fathers sight
 If we shall meet again with more delight
 Then draw my life in length let me sustain
 In hopes of his embrace the worst of pain
 But if your hard decrees which O I dread
 Have doomd to death his undeserving head
 This O this very moment let me die
 While hopes and fears in equal balance lie
 While yet possessd of all his youthful charms
 I strain him close within these aged arms
 Before that fatal news my soul shall wound
 He said and swooning sunk upon the ground
 His servants bore him off and softly laid
 His languishd limbs upon his homely bed

 The horsemen march the gates are opend wide
 Aeneas at their head Achates by his side
 Next these the Trojan leaders rode along
 Last follows in the rear th Arcadian throng
 Young Pallas shone conspicuous oer the rest
 Gilded his arms embroiderd was his vest
 So from the seas exerts his radiant head
 The star by whom the lights of heavn are led
 Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews
 Dispels the darkness and the day renews
 The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd
 And follow with their eyes the dusty cloud
 Which winds disperse by fits and shew from far
 The blaze of arms and shields and shining war
 The troops drawn up in beautiful array
 Oer heathy plains pursue the ready way
 Repeated peals of shouts are heard around
 The neighing coursers answer to the sound
 And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground

 A greenwood shade for long religion known
 Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town
 Incompassd round with gloomy hills above
 Which add a holy horror to the grove
 The first inhabitants of Grecian blood
 That sacred forest to Silvanus vowd
 The guardian of their flocks and fields and pay
 Their due devotions on his annual day
 Not far from hence along the rivers side
 In tents secure the Tuscan troops abide
 By Tarchon led Now from a rising ground
 Aeneas cast his wondring eyes around
 And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight
 Stretchd on the spacious plain from left to right
 Thether his warlike train the Trojan led
 Refreshd his men and wearied horses fed

 Meantime the mother goddess crownd with charms
 Breaks thro the clouds and brings the fated arms
 Within a winding vale she finds her son
 On the cool rivers banks retird alone
 She shews her heavnly form without disguise
 And gives herself to his desiring eyes
 Behold she said performd in evry part
 My promise made and Vulcans labord art
 Now seek secure the Latian enemy
 And haughty Turnus to the field defy
 She said and having first her son embracd
 The radiant arms beneath an oak she placd
 Proud of the gift he rolld his greedy sight
 Around the work and gazd with vast delight
 He lifts he turns he poises and admires
 The crested helm that vomits radiant fires
 His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold
 One keen with temperd steel one stiff with gold
 Both ample flaming both and beamy bright
 So shines a cloud when edgd with adverse light
 He shakes the pointed spear and longs to try
 The plated cuishes on his manly thigh
 But most admires the shields mysterious mold
 And Roman triumphs rising on the gold
 For these embossd the heavnly smith had wrought
 Not in the rolls of future fate untaught
 The wars in order and the race divine
 Of warriors issuing from the Julian line
 The cave of Mars was dressd with mossy greens
 There by the wolf were laid the martial twins
 Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung
 The foster dam lolld out her fawning tongue
 They suckd secure while bending back her head
 She lickd their tender limbs and formd them as they fed
 Not far from thence new Rome appears with games
 Projected for the rape of Sabine dames
 The pit resounds with shrieks a war succeeds
 For breach of public faith and unexampled deeds
 Here for revenge the Sabine troops contend
 The Romans there with arms the prey defend
 Wearied with tedious war at length they cease
 And both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace
 The friendly chiefs before Joves altar stand
 Both armd with each a charger in his hand
 A fatted sow for sacrifice is led
 With imprecations on the perjurd head
 Near this the traitor Metius stretchd between
 Four fiery steeds is draggd along the green
 By Tullus doom the brambles drink his blood
 And his torn limbs are left the vultures food
 There Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings
 And would by force restore the banishd kings
 One tyrant for his fellowtyrant fights
 The Roman youth assert their native rights
 Before the town the Tuscan army lies
 To win by famine or by fraud surprise
 Their king halfthreatning halfdisdaining stood
 While Cocles broke the bridge and stemmd the flood
 The captive maids there tempt the raging tide
 Scapd from their chains with Cloelia for their guide
 High on a rock heroic Manlius stood
 To guard the temple and the temples god
 Then Rome was poor and there you might behold
 The palace thatchd with straw now roofd with gold
 The silver goose before the shining gate
 There flew and by her cackle savd the state
 She told the Gauls approach th approaching Gauls
 Obscure in night ascend and seize the walls
 The gold dissembled well their yellow hair
 And golden chains on their white necks they wear
 Gold are their vests long Alpine spears they wield
 And their left arm sustains a length of shield
 Hard by the leaping Salian priests advance
 And naked thro the streets the mad Luperci dance
 In caps of wool the targets droppd from heavn
 Here modest matrons in soft litters drivn
 To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear
 And odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear
 Far hence removd the Stygian seats are seen
 Pains of the damnd and punishd Catiline
 Hung on a rock the traitor and around
 The Furies hissing from the nether ground
 Apart from these the happy souls he draws
 And Catos holy ghost dispensing laws

 Betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea
 But foaming surges there in silver play
 The dancing dolphins with their tails divide
 The glittring waves and cut the precious tide
 Amid the main two mighty fleets engage
 Their brazen beaks opposd with equal rage
 Actium surveys the welldisputed prize
 Leucates watry plain with foamy billows fries
 Young Caesar on the stern in armor bright
 Here leads the Romans and their gods to fight
 His beamy temples shoot their flames afar
 And oer his head is hung the Julian star
 Agrippa seconds him with prosprous gales
 And with propitious gods his foes assails
 A naval crown that binds his manly brows
 The happy fortune of the fight foreshows
 Rangd on the line opposd Antonius brings
 Barbarian aids and troops of Eastern kings
 Th Arabians near and Bactrians from afar
 Of tongues discordant and a mingled war
 And rich in gaudy robes amidst the strife
 His ill fate follows him th Egyptian wife
 Moving they fight with oars and forky prows
 The froth is gatherd and the water glows
 It seems as if the Cyclades again
 Were rooted up and justled in the main
 Or floating mountains floating mountains meet
 Such is the fierce encounter of the fleet
 Fireballs are thrown and pointed javlins fly
 The fields of Neptune take a purple dye
 The queen herself amidst the loud alarms
 With cymbals tossd her fainting soldiers warms
 Fool as she was who had not yet divind
 Her cruel fate nor saw the snakes behind
 Her country gods the monsters of the sky
 Great Neptune Pallas and Loves Queen defy
 The dog Anubis barks but barks in vain
 Nor longer dares oppose th ethereal train
 Mars in the middle of the shining shield
 Is gravd and strides along the liquid field
 The Dirae souse from heavn with swift descent
 And Discord dyed in blood with garments rent
 Divides the prease her steps Bellona treads
 And shakes her iron rod above their heads
 This seen Apollo from his Actian height
 Pours down his arrows at whose winged flight
 The trembling Indians and Egyptians yield
 And soft Sabaeans quit the watry field
 The fatal mistress hoists her silken sails
 And shrinking from the fight invokes the gales
 Aghast she looks and heaves her breast for breath
 Panting and pale with fear of future death
 The god had figurd her as drivn along
 By winds and waves and scudding thro the throng
 Just opposite sad Nilus opens wide
 His arms and ample bosom to the tide
 And spreads his mantle oer the winding coast
 In which he wraps his queen and hides the flying host
 The victor to the gods his thanks expressd
 And Rome triumphant with his presence blessd
 Three hundred temples in the town he placd
 With spoils and altars evry temple gracd
 Three shining nights and three succeeding days
 The fields resound with shouts the streets with praise
 The domes with songs the theaters with plays
 All altars flame before each altar lies
 Drenchd in his gore the destind sacrifice
 Great Caesar sits sublime upon his throne
 Before Apollos porch of Parian stone
 Accepts the presents vowd for victory
 And hangs the monumental crowns on high
 Vast crowds of vanquishd nations march along
 Various in arms in habit and in tongue
 Here Mulciber assigns the proper place
 For Carians and th ungirt Numidian race
 Then ranks the Thracians in the second row
 With Scythians expert in the dart and bow
 And here the tamd Euphrates humbly glides
 And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides
 And proud Araxes whom no bridge could bind
 The Danes unconquerd offspring march behind
 And Morini the last of humankind

 These figures on the shield divinely wrought
 By Vulcan labord and by Venus brought
 With joy and wonder fill the heros thought
 Unknown the names he yet admires the grace
 And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race




 BOOK IX

 While these affairs in distant places passd
 The various Iris Juno sends with haste
 To find bold Turnus who with anxious thought
 The secret shade of his great grandsire sought
 Retird alone she found the daring man
 And opd her rosy lips and thus began
 What none of all the gods could grant thy vows
 That Turnus this auspicious day bestows
 Aeneas gone to seek th Arcadian prince
 Has left the Trojan camp without defense
 And short of succors there employs his pains
 In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains
 Now snatch an hour that favors thy designs
 Unite thy forces and attack their lines
 This said on equal wings she poisd her weight
 And formd a radiant rainbow in her flight

 The Daunian hero lifts his hands eyes
 And thus invokes the goddess as she flies
 Iris the grace of heavn what powr divine
 Has sent thee down thro dusky clouds to shine
 See they divide immortal day appears
 And glittring planets dancing in their spheres
 With joy these happy omens I obey
 And follow to the war the god that leads the way
 Thus having said as by the brook he stood
 He scoopd the water from the crystal flood
 Then with his hands the drops to heavn he throws
 And loads the powrs above with offerd vows

 Now march the bold confedrates thro the plain
 Well horsd well clad a rich and shining train
 Messapus leads the van and in the rear
 The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear
 In the main battle with his flaming crest
 The mighty Turnus towrs above the rest
 Silent they move majestically slow
 Like ebbing Nile or Ganges in his flow
 The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far
 And the dark menace of the distant war
 Caicus from the rampire saw it rise
 Blackning the fields and thickning thro the skies
 Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls
 What rolling clouds my friends approach the walls
 Arm arm and man the works prepare your spears
 And pointed darts the Latian host appears

 Thus warnd they shut their gates with shouts ascend
 The bulwarks and secure their foes attend
 For their wise genral with foreseeing care
 Had chargd them not to tempt the doubtful war
 Nor tho provokd in open fields advance
 But close within their lines attend their chance
 Unwilling yet they keep the strict command
 And sourly wait in arms the hostile band
 The fiery Turnus flew before the rest
 A piebald steed of Thracian strain he pressd
 His helm of massy gold and crimson was his crest
 With twenty horse to second his designs
 An unexpected foe he facd the lines
 Is there he said in arms who bravely dare
 His leaders honor and his danger share
 Then spurring on his brandishd dart he threw
 In sign of war applauding shouts ensue

 Amazd to find a dastard race that run
 Behind the rampires and the battle shun
 He rides around the camp with rolling eyes
 And stops at evry post and evry passage tries
 So roams the nightly wolf about the fold
 Wet with descending showrs and stiff with cold
 He howls for hunger and he grins for pain
 His gnashing teeth are exercisd in vain
 And impotent of anger finds no way
 In his distended paws to grasp the prey
 The mothers listen but the bleating lambs
 Securely swig the dug beneath the dams
 Thus ranges eager Turnus oer the plain
 Sharp with desire and furious with disdain
 Surveys each passage with a piercing sight
 To force his foes in equal field to fight
 Thus while he gazes round at length he spies
 Where fencd with strong redoubts their navy lies
 Close underneath the walls the washing tide
 Secures from all approach this weaker side
 He takes the wishd occasion fills his hand
 With ready fires and shakes a flaming brand
 Urgd by his presence evry soul is warmd
 And evry hand with kindled firs is armd
 From the fird pines the scattring sparkles fly
 Fat vapors mixd with flames involve the sky
 What powr O Muses could avert the flame
 Which threatend in the fleet the Trojan name
 Tell for the fact thro length of time obscure
 Is hard to faith yet shall the fame endure

 T is said that when the chief prepard his flight
 And felld his timber from Mount Idas height
 The grandam goddess then approachd her son
 And with a mothers majesty begun
 Grant me she said the sole request I bring
 Since conquerd heavn has ownd you for its king
 On Idas brows for ages past there stood
 With firs and maples filld a shady wood
 And on the summit rose a sacred grove
 Where I was worshipd with religious love
 Those woods that holy grove my long delight
 I gave the Trojan prince to speed his flight
 Now filld with fear on their behalf I come
 Let neither winds oerset nor waves intomb
 The floating forests of the sacred pine
 But let it be their safety to be mine
 Then thus replied her awful son who rolls
 The radiant stars and heavn and earth controls
 How dare you mother endless date demand
 For vessels molded by a mortal hand
 What then is fate Shall bold Aeneas ride
 Of safety certain on th uncertain tide
 Yet what I can I grant when wafted oer
 The chief is landed on the Latian shore
 Whatever ships escape the raging storms
 At my command shall change their fading forms
 To nymphs divine and plow the watry way
 Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea
 To seal his sacred vow by Styx he swore
 The lake of liquid pitch the dreary shore
 And Phlegethons innavigable flood
 And the black regions of his brother god
 He said and shook the skies with his imperial nod

 And now at length the numberd hours were come
 Prefixd by fates irrevocable doom
 When the great Mother of the Gods was free
 To save her ships and finish Joves decree
 First from the quarter of the morn there sprung
 A light that signd the heavns and shot along
 Then from a cloud fringd round with golden fires
 Were timbrels heard and Berecynthian choirs
 And last a voice with more than mortal sounds
 Both hosts in arms opposd with equal horror wounds
 O Trojan race your needless aid forbear
 And know my ships are my peculiar care
 With greater ease the bold Rutulian may
 With hissing brands attempt to burn the sea
 Than singe my sacred pines But you my charge
 Loosd from your crooked anchors launch at large
 Exalted each a nymph forsake the sand
 And swim the seas at Cybeles command
 No sooner had the goddess ceasd to speak
 When lo th obedient ships their haulsers break
 And strange to tell like dolphins in the main
 They plunge their prows and dive and spring again
 As many beauteous maids the billows sweep
 As rode before tall vessels on the deep

 The foes surprisd with wonder stood aghast
 Messapus curbd his fiery coursers haste
 Old Tiber roard and raising up his head
 Calld back his waters to their oozy bed
 Turnus alone undaunted bore the shock
 And with these words his trembling troops bespoke
 These monsters for the Trojans fate are meant
 And are by Jove for black presages sent
 He takes the cowards last relief away
 For fly they cannot and constraind to stay
 Must yield unfought a base inglorious prey
 The liquid half of all the globe is lost
 Heavn shuts the seas and we secure the coast
 Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground
 Which myriads of our martial men surround
 Their fates I fear not or vain oracles
 T was givn to Venus they should cross the seas
 And land secure upon the Latian plains
 Their promisd hour is passd and mine remains
 T is in the fate of Turnus to destroy
 With sword and fire the faithless race of Troy
 Shall such affronts as these alone inflame
 The Grecian brothers and the Grecian name
 My cause and theirs is one a fatal strife
 And final ruin for a ravishd wife
 Was t not enough that punishd for the crime
 They fell but will they fall a second time
 One would have thought they paid enough before
 To curse the costly sex and durst offend no more
 Can they securely trust their feeble wall
 A slight partition a thin interval
 Betwixt their fate and them when Troy tho built
 By hands divine yet perishd by their guilt
 Lend me for once my friends your valiant hands
 To force from out their lines these dastard bands
 Less than a thousand ships will end this war
 Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare
 Let all the Tuscans all th Arcadians join
 Nor these nor those shall frustrate my design
 Let them not fear the treasons of the night
 The robbd Palladium the pretended flight
 Our onset shall be made in open light
 No wooden engine shall their town betray
 Fires they shall have around but fires by day
 No Grecian babes before their camp appear
 Whom Hectors arms detaind to the tenth tardy year
 Now since the sun is rolling to the west
 Give we the silent night to needful rest
 Refresh your bodies and your arms prepare
 The morn shall end the small remains of war

 The post of honor to Messapus falls
 To keep the nightly guard to watch the walls
 To pitch the fires at distances around
 And close the Trojans in their scanty ground
 Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand
 And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command
 All clad in shining arms the works invest
 Each with a radiant helm and waving crest
 Stretchd at their length they press the grassy ground
 They laugh they sing the jolly bowls go round
 With lights and cheerful fires renew the day
 And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play

 The Trojans from above their foes beheld
 And with armd legions all the rampires filld
 Seizd with affright their gates they first explore
 Join works to works with bridges towr to towr
 Thus all things needful for defense abound
 Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round
 Commissiond by their absent prince to share
 The common danger and divide the care
 The soldiers draw their lots and as they fall
 By turns relieve each other on the wall

 Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance
 To watch the gate was warlike Nisus chance
 His father Hyrtacus of noble blood
 His mother was a huntress of the wood
 And sent him to the wars Well could he bear
 His lance in fight and dart the flying spear
 But better skilld unerring shafts to send
 Beside him stood Euryalus his friend
 Euryalus than whom the Trojan host
 No fairer face or sweeter air could boast
 Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun
 One was their care and their delight was one
 One common hazard in the war they shard
 And now were both by choice upon the guard

 Then Nisus thus Or do the gods inspire
 This warmth or make we gods of our desire
 A genrous ardor boils within my breast
 Eager of action enemy to rest
 This urges me to fight and fires my mind
 To leave a memorable name behind
 Thou seest the foe secure how faintly shine
 Their scatterd fires the most in sleep supine
 Along the ground an easy conquest lie
 The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply
 All hushd around Now hear what I revolve
 A thought unripe and scarcely yet resolve
 Our absent prince both camp and council mourn
 By message both would hasten his return
 If they confer what I demand on thee
 For fame is recompense enough for me
 Methinks beneath yon hill I have espied
 A way that safely will my passage guide

 Euryalus stood listning while he spoke
 With love of praise and noble envy struck
 Then to his ardent friend exposd his mind
 All this alone and leaving me behind
 Am I unworthy Nisus to be joind
 Thinkist thou I can my share of glory yield
 Or send thee unassisted to the field
 Not so my father taught my childhood arms
 Born in a siege and bred among alarms
 Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend
 Nor of the heavnborn hero I attend
 The thing calld life with ease I can disclaim
 And think it oversold to purchase fame

 Then Nisus thus Alas thy tender years
 Would minister new matter to my fears
 So may the gods who view this friendly strife
 Restore me to thy lovd embrace with life
 Condemnd to pay my vows as sure I trust
 This thy request is cruel and unjust
 But if some chance as many chances are
 And doubtful hazards in the deeds of war
 If one should reach my head there let it fall
 And spare thy life I would not perish all
 Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date
 Live thou to mourn thy loves unhappy fate
 To bear my mangled body from the foe
 Or buy it back and funral rites bestow
 Or if hard fortune shall those dues deny
 Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply
 O let not me the widows tears renew
 Nor let a mothers curse my name pursue
 Thy pious parent who for love of thee
 Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily
 Her age committing to the seas and wind
 When evry weary matron stayd behind
 To this Euryalus You plead in vain
 And but protract the cause you cannot gain
 No more delays but haste With that he wakes
 The nodding watch each to his office takes
 The guard relievd the genrous couple went
 To find the council at the royal tent

 All creatures else forgot their daily care
 And sleep the common gift of nature share
 Except the Trojan peers who wakeful sate
 In nightly council for th indangerd state
 They vote a message to their absent chief
 Shew their distress and beg a swift relief
 Amid the camp a silent seat they chose
 Remote from clamor and secure from foes
 On their left arms their ample shields they bear
 The right reclind upon the bending spear
 Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard
 And beg admission eager to be heard
 Th affair important not to be deferrd
 Ascanius bids em be conducted in
 Ordring the more experiencd to begin
 Then Nisus thus Ye fathers lend your ears
 Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years
 The foe securely drenchd in sleep and wine
 Neglect their watch the fires but thinly shine
 And where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies
 Covring the plain and curling to the skies
 Betwixt two paths which at the gate divide
 Close by the sea a passage we have spied
 Which will our way to great Aeneas guide
 Expect each hour to see him safe again
 Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain
 Snatch we the lucky minute while we may
 Nor can we be mistaken in the way
 For hunting in the vale we both have seen
 The rising turrets and the stream between
 And know the winding course with evry ford

 He ceasd and old Alethes took the word
 Our country gods in whom our trust we place
 Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race
 While we behold such dauntless worth appear
 In dawning youth and souls so void of fear
 Then into tears of joy the father broke
 Each in his longing arms by turns he took
 Panted and pausd and thus again he spoke
 Ye brave young men what equal gifts can we
 In recompense of such desert decree
 The greatest sure and best you can receive
 The gods and your own conscious worth will give
 The rest our grateful genral will bestow
 And young Ascanius till his manhood owe

 And I whose welfare in my father lies
 Ascanius adds by the great deities
 By my dear country by my household gods
 By hoary Vestas rites and dark abodes
 Adjure you both on you my fortune stands
 That and my faith I plight into your hands
 Make me but happy in his safe return
 Whose wanted presence I can only mourn
 Your common gift shall two large goblets be
 Of silver wrought with curious imagery
 And high embossd which when old Priam reignd
 My conquring sire at sackd Arisba gaind
 And more two tripods cast in antic mold
 With two great talents of the finest gold
 Beside a costly bowl ingravd with art
 Which Dido gave when first she gave her heart
 But if in conquerd Italy we reign
 When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain
 Thou sawst the courser by proud Turnus pressd
 That Nisus and his arms and nodding crest
 And shield from chance exempt shall be thy share
 Twelve labring slaves twelve handmaids young and fair
 All clad in rich attire and traind with care
 And last a Latian field with fruitful plains
 And a large portion of the kings domains
 But thou whose years are more to mine allied
 No fate my vowd affection shall divide
 From thee heroic youth Be wholly mine
 Take full possession all my soul is thine
 One faith one fame one fate shall both attend
 My lifes companion and my bosom friend
 My peace shall be committed to thy care
 And to thy conduct my concerns in war

 Then thus the young Euryalus replied
 Whatever fortune good or bad betide
 The same shall be my age as now my youth
 No time shall find me wanting to my truth
 This only from your goodness let me gain
 And this ungranted all rewards are vain
 Of Priams royal race my mother came
 And sure the best that ever bore the name
 Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold
 From me departing but oerspent and old
 My fate she followd Ignorant of this
 Whatever danger neither parting kiss
 Nor pious blessing taken her I leave
 And in this only act of all my life deceive
 By this right hand and conscious Night I swear
 My soul so sad a farewell could not bear
 Be you her comfort fill my vacant place
 Permit me to presume so great a grace
 Support her age forsaken and distressd
 That hope alone will fortify my breast
 Against the worst of fortunes and of fears
 He said The movd assistants melt in tears

 Then thus Ascanius wonderstruck to see
 That image of his filial piety
 So great beginnings in so green an age
 Exact the faith which I again ingage
 Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim
 Creusa had and only want the name
 Whateer event thy bold attempt shall have
 T is merit to have borne a son so brave
 Now by my head a sacred oath I swear
 My father usd it what returning here
 Crownd with success I for thyself prepare
 That if thou fail shall thy lovd mother share

 He said and weeping while he spoke the word
 From his broad belt he drew a shining sword
 Magnificent with gold Lycaon made
 And in an ivory scabbard sheathd the blade
 This was his gift Great Mnestheus gave his friend
 A lions hide his body to defend
 And good Alethes furnishd him beside
 With his own trusty helm of temper tried

 Thus armd they went The noble Trojans wait
 Their issuing forth and follow to the gate
 With prayers and vows Above the rest appears
 Ascanius manly far beyond his years
 And messages committed to their care
 Which all in winds were lost and flitting air

 The trenches first they passd then took their way
 Where their proud foes in pitchd pavilions lay
 To many fatal ere themselves were slain
 They found the careless host dispersd upon the plain
 Who gorgd and drunk with wine supinely snore
 Unharnessd chariots stand along the shore
 Amidst the wheels and reins the goblet by
 A medley of debauch and war they lie
 Observing Nisus shewd his friend the sight
 Behold a conquest gaind without a fight
 Occasion offers and I stand prepard
 There lies our way be thou upon the guard
 And look around while I securely go
 And hew a passage thro the sleeping foe
 Softly he spoke then striding took his way
 With his drawn sword where haughty Rhamnes lay
 His head raisd high on tapestry beneath
 And heaving from his breast he drew his breath
 A king and prophet by King Turnus lovd
 But fate by prescience cannot be removd
 Him and his sleeping slaves he slew then spies
 Where Remus with his rich retinue lies
 His armorbearer first and next he kills
 His charioteer intrenchd betwixt the wheels
 And his lovd horses last invades their lord
 Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword
 The gasping head flies off a purple flood
 Flows from the trunk that welters in the blood
 Which by the spurning heels dispersd around
 The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground
 Lamus the bold and Lamyrus the strong
 He slew and then Serranus fair and young
 From dice and wine the youth retird to rest
 And puffd the fumy god from out his breast
 Evn then he dreamt of drink and lucky play
 More lucky had it lasted till the day
 The famishd lion thus with hunger bold
 Oerleaps the fences of the nightly fold
 And tears the peaceful flocks with silent awe
 Trembling they lie and pant beneath his paw

 Nor with less rage Euryalus employs
 The wrathful sword or fewer foes destroys
 But on th ignoble crowd his fury flew
 He Fadus Hebesus and Rhoetus slew
 Oppressd with heavy sleep the former fell
 But Rhoetus wakeful and observing all
 Behind a spacious jar he slinkd for fear
 The fatal iron found and reachd him there
 For as he rose it piercd his naked side
 And reeking thence returnd in crimson dyed
 The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood
 The purple soul comes floating in the flood

 Now where Messapus quarterd they arrive
 The fires were fainting there and just alive
 The warriorhorses tied in order fed
 Nisus observd the discipline and said
 Our eager thirst of blood may both betray
 And see the scatterd streaks of dawning day
 Foe to nocturnal thefts No more my friend
 Here let our glutted execution end
 A lane thro slaughterd bodies we have made
 The bold Euryalus tho loth obeyd
 Of arms and arras and of plate they find
 A precious load but these they leave behind
 Yet fond of gaudy spoils the boy would stay
 To make the rich caparison his prey
 Which on the steed of conquerd Rhamnes lay
 Nor did his eyes less longingly behold
 The girdlebelt with nails of burnishd gold
 This present Caedicus the rich bestowd
 On Remulus when friendship first they vowd
 And absent joind in hospitable ties
 He dying to his heir bequeathd the prize
 Till by the conquring Ardean troops oppressd
 He fell and they the glorious gift possessd
 These glittring spoils now made the victors gain
 He to his body suits but suits in vain
 Messapus helm he finds among the rest
 And laces on and wears the waving crest
 Proud of their conquest prouder of their prey
 They leave the camp and take the ready way

 But far they had not passd before they spied
 Three hundred horse with Volscens for their guide
 The queen a legion to King Turnus sent
 But the swift horse the slower foot prevent
 And now advancing sought the leaders tent
 They saw the pair for thro the doubtful shade
 His shining helm Euryalus betrayd
 On which the moon with full reflection playd
 T is not for naught cried Volscens from the crowd
 These men go there then raisd his voice aloud
 Stand stand why thus in arms And whither bent
 From whence to whom and on what errand sent
 Silent they scud away and haste their flight
 To neighbring woods and trust themselves to night
 The speedy horse all passages belay
 And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way
 And watch each entrance of the winding wood
 Black was the forest thick with beech it stood
 Horrid with fern and intricate with thorn
 Few paths of human feet or tracks of beasts were worn
 The darkness of the shades his heavy prey
 And fear misled the younger from his way
 But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste
 And thoughtless of his friend the forest passd
 And Alban plains from Albas name so calld
 Where King Latinus then his oxen stalld
 Till turning at the length he stood his ground
 And missd his friend and cast his eyes around
 Ah wretch he cried where have I left behind
 Th unhappy youth where shall I hope to find
 Or what way take Again he ventures back
 And treads the mazes of his former track
 He winds the wood and listning hears the noise
 Of tramping coursers and the riders voice
 The sound approachd and suddenly he viewd
 The foes inclosing and his friend pursued
 Forelaid and taken while he strove in vain
 The shelter of the friendly shades to gain
 What should he next attempt what arms employ
 What fruitless force to free the captive boy
 Or desperate should he rush and lose his life
 With odds oppressd in such unequal strife

 Resolvd at length his pointed spear he shook
 And casting on the moon a mournful look
 Guardian of groves and goddess of the night
 Fair queen he said direct my dart aright
 If eer my pious father for my sake
 Did grateful offrings on thy altars make
 Or I increasd them with my sylvan toils
 And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils
 Give me to scatter these Then from his ear
 He poisd and aimd and launchd the trembling spear
 The deadly weapon hissing from the grove
 Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove
 Piercd his thin armor drank his vital blood
 And in his body left the broken wood
 He staggers round his eyeballs roll in death
 And with short sobs he gasps away his breath
 All stand amazd a second javlin flies
 With equal strength and quivers thro the skies
 This thro thy temples Tagus forcd the way
 And in the brainpan warmly buried lay
 Fierce Volscens foams with rage and gazing round
 Descried not him who gave the fatal wound
 Nor knew to fix revenge But thou he cries
 Shalt pay for both and at the prisner flies
 With his drawn sword Then struck with deep despair
 That cruel sight the lover could not bear
 But from his covert rushd in open view
 And sent his voice before him as he flew
 Me me he cried turn all your swords alone
 On me the fact confessd the fault my own
 He neither could nor durst the guiltless youth
 Ye moon and stars bear witness to the truth
 His only crime if friendship can offend
 Is too much love to his unhappy friend
 Too late he speaks the sword which fury guides
 Drivn with full force had piercd his tender sides
 Down fell the beauteous youth the yawning wound
 Gushd out a purple stream and staind the ground
 His snowy neck reclines upon his breast
 Like a fair flowr by the keen share oppressd
 Like a white poppy sinking on the plain
 Whose heavy head is overchargd with rain
 Despair and rage and vengeance justly vowd
 Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd
 Volscens he seeks on him alone he bends
 Borne back and bord by his surrounding friends
 Onward he pressd and kept him still in sight
 Then whirld aloft his sword with all his might
 Th unerring steel descended while he spoke
 Piered his wide mouth and thro his weazon broke
 Dying he slew and staggring on the plain
 With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain
 Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell
 Content in death to be revengd so well

 O happy friends for if my verse can give
 Immortal life your fame shall ever live
 Fixd as the Capitols foundation lies
 And spread whereer the Roman eagle flies

 The conquring party first divide the prey
 Then their slain leader to the camp convey
 With wonder as they went the troops were filld
 To see such numbers whom so few had killd
 Serranus Rhamnes and the rest they found
 Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround
 And the yet reeking blood oerflows the ground
 All knew the helmet which Messapus lost
 But mournd a purchase that so dear had cost
 Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithons bed
 And with the dawn of day the skies oerspread
 Nor long the sun his daily course withheld
 But added colors to the world reveald
 When early Turnus wakning with the light
 All clad in armor calls his troops to fight
 His martial men with fierce harangue he fird
 And his own ardor in their souls inspird
 This done to give new terror to his foes
 The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows
 Raisd high on pointed spears a ghastly sight
 Loud peals of shouts ensue and barbarous delight

 Meantime the Trojans run where danger calls
 They line their trenches and they man their walls
 In front extended to the left they stood
 Safe was the right surrounded by the flood
 But casting from their towrs a frightful view
 They saw the faces which too well they knew
 Tho then disguisd in death and smeard all oer
 With filth obscene and dropping putrid gore
 Soon hasty fame thro the sad city bears
 The mournful message to the mothers ears
 An icy cold benumbs her limbs she shakes
 Her cheeks the blood her hand the web forsakes
 She runs the rampires round amidst the war
 Nor fears the flying darts she rends her hair
 And fills with loud laments the liquid air
 Thus then my lovd Euryalus appears
 Thus looks the prop my declining years
 Wast on this face my famishd eyes I fed
 Ah how unlike the living is the dead
 And couldst thou leave me cruel thus alone
 Not one kind kiss from a departing son
 No look no last adieu before he went
 In an illboding hour to slaughter sent
 Cold on the ground and pressing foreign clay
 To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey
 Nor was I near to close his dying eyes
 To wash his wounds to weep his obsequies
 To call about his corpse his crying friends
 Or spread the mantle made for other ends
 On his dear body which I wove with care
 Nor did my daily pains or nightly labor spare
 Where shall I find his corpse what earth sustains
 His trunk dismemberd and his cold remains
 For this alas I left my needful ease
 Exposd my life to winds and winter seas
 If any pity touch Rutulian hearts
 Here empty all your quivers all your darts
 Or if they fail thou Jove conclude my woe
 And send me thunderstruck to shades below
 Her shrieks and clamors pierce the Trojans ears
 Unman their courage and augment their fears
 Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain
 Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain
 But Actor and Idaeus jointly sent
 To bear the madding mother to her tent

 And now the trumpets terribly from far
 With rattling clangor rouse the sleepy war
 The soldiers shouts succeed the brazen sounds
 And heavn from pole to pole the noise rebounds
 The Volscians bear their shields upon their head
 And rushing forward form a moving shed
 These fill the ditch those pull the bulwarks down
 Some raise the ladders others scale the town
 But where void spaces on the walls appear
 Or thin defense they pour their forces there
 With poles and missive weapons from afar
 The Trojans keep aloof the rising war
 Taught by their ten years siege defensive fight
 They roll down ribs of rocks an unresisted weight
 To break the penthouse with the pondrous blow
 Which yet the patient Volscians undergo
 But could not bear th unequal combat long
 For where the Trojans find the thickest throng
 The ruin falls their shatterd shields give way
 And their crushd heads become an easy prey
 They shrink for fear abated of their rage
 Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage
 Contented now to gall them from below
 With darts and slings and with the distant bow

 Elsewhere Mezentius terrible to view
 A blazing pine within the trenches threw
 But brave Messapus Neptunes warlike son
 Broke down the palisades the trenches won
 And loud for ladders calls to scale the town

 Calliope begin Ye sacred Nine
 Inspire your poet in his high design
 To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made
 What souls he sent below the Stygian shade
 What fame the soldiers with their captain share
 And the vast circuit of the fatal war
 For you in singing martial facts excel
 You best remember and alone can tell

 There stood a towr amazing to the sight
 Built up of beams and of stupendous height
 Art and the nature of the place conspird
 To furnish all the strength that war requird
 To level this the bold Italians join
 The wary Trojans obviate their design
 With weighty stones oerwhelm their troops below
 Shoot thro the loopholes and sharp javlins throw
 Turnus the chief tossd from his thundring hand
 Against the wooden walls a flaming brand
 It stuck the fiery plague the winds were high
 The planks were seasond and the timber dry
 Contagion caught the posts it spread along
 Scorchd and to distance drove the scatterd throng
 The Trojans fled the fire pursued amain
 Still gathring fast upon the trembling train
 Till crowding to the corners of the wall
 Down the defense and the defenders fall
 The mighty flaw makes heavn itself resound
 The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground
 The towr that followd on the fallen crew
 Whelmd oer their heads and buried whom it slew
 Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent
 All the same equal ruin underwent

 Young Lycus and Helenor only scape
 Savd how they know not from the steepy leap
 Helenor elder of the two by birth
 On one side royal one a son of earth
 Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare
 And sent her boasted bastard to the war
 A privilege which none but freemen share
 Slight were his arms a sword and silver shield
 No marks of honor chargd its empty field
 Light as he fell so light the youth arose
 And rising found himself amidst his foes
 Nor flight was left nor hopes to force his way
 Emboldend by despair he stood at bay
 And like a stag whom all the troop surrounds
 Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds
 Resolvd on death he dissipates his fears
 And bounds aloft against the pointed spears
 So dares the youth secure of death and throws
 His dying body on his thickest foes
 But Lycus swifter of his feet by far
 Runs doubles winds and turns amidst the war
 Springs to the walls and leaves his foes behind
 And snatches at the beam he first can find
 Looks up and leaps aloft at all the stretch
 In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach
 But Turnus followd hard his hunted prey
 His spear had almost reachd him in the way
 Short of his reins and scarce a span behind
 Fool said the chief tho fleeter than the wind
 Couldst thou presume to scape when I pursue
 He said and downward by the feet he drew
 The trembling dastard at the tug he falls
 Vast ruins come along rent from the smoking walls
 Thus on some silver swan or timrous hare
 Joves bird comes sousing down from upper air
 Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey
 Then out of sight she soars and wings her way
 So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb
 In vain lamented by the bleating dam

 Then rushing onward with a barbrous cry
 The troops of Turnus to the combat fly
 The ditch with fagots filld the daring foe
 Tossd firebrands to the steepy turrets throw

 Ilioneus as bold Lucetius came
 To force the gate and feed the kindling flame
 Rolld down the fragment of a rock so right
 It crushd him double underneath the weight
 Two more young Liger and Asylas slew
 To bend the bow young Liger better knew
 Asylas best the pointed javlin threw
 Brave Caeneus laid Ortygius on the plain
 The victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain
 By the same hand Clonius and Itys fall
 Sagar and Ida standing on the wall
 From Capys arms his fate Privernus found
 Hurt by Themilla firstbut slight the wound
 His shield thrown by to mitigate the smart
 He clappd his hand upon the wounded part
 The second shaft came swift and unespied
 And piercd his hand and naild it to his side
 Transfixd his breathing lungs and beating heart
 The soul came issuing out and hissd against the dart

 The son of Arcens shone amid the rest
 In glittring armor and a purple vest
 Fair was his face his eyes inspiring love
 Bred by his father in the Martian grove
 Where the fat altars of Palicus flame
 And send in arms to purchase early fame
 Him when he spied from far the Tuscan king
 Laid by the lance and took him to the sling
 Thrice whirld the thong around his head and threw
 The heated lead half melted as it flew
 It piercd his hollow temples and his brain
 The youth came tumbling down and spurnd the plain

 Then young Ascanius who before this day
 Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey
 First bent in martial strife the twanging bow
 And exercisd against a human foe
 With this bereft Numanus of his life
 Who Turnus younger sister took to wife
 Proud of his realm and of his royal bride
 Vaunting before his troops and lengthend with a stride
 In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied

 Twiceconquerd cowards now your shame is shown
 Coopd up a second time within your town
 Who dare not issue forth in open field
 But hold your walls before you for a shield
 Thus threat you war thus our alliance force
 What gods what madness hether steerd your course
 You shall not find the sons of Atreus here
 Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear
 Strong from the cradle of a sturdy brood
 We bear our newborn infants to the flood
 There bathd amid the stream our boys we hold
 With winter hardend and inurd to cold
 They wake before the day to range the wood
 Kill ere they eat nor taste unconquerd food
 No sports but what belong to war they know
 To break the stubborn colt to bend the bow
 Our youth of labor patient earn their bread
 Hardly they work with frugal diet fed
 From plows and harrows sent to seek renown
 They fight in fields and storm the shaken town
 No part of life from toils of war is free
 No change in age or diffrence in degree
 We plow and till in arms our oxen feel
 Instead of goads the spur and pointed steel
 Th inverted lance makes furrows in the plain
 Evn time that changes all yet changes us in vain
 The body not the mind nor can control
 Th immortal vigor or abate the soul
 Our helms defend the young disguise the gray
 We live by plunder and delight in prey
 Your vests embroiderd with rich purple shine
 In sloth you glory and in dances join
 Your vests have sweeping sleeves with female pride
 Your turbants underneath your chins are tied
 Go Phrygians to your Dindymus again
 Go less than women in the shapes of men
 Go mixd with eunuchs in the Mothers rites
 Where with unequal sound the flute invites
 Sing dance and howl by turns in Idas shade
 Resign the war to men who know the martial trade

 This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear
 With patience or a vowd revenge forbear
 At the full stretch of both his hands he drew
 And almost joind the horns of the tough yew
 But first before the throne of Jove he stood
 And thus with lifted hands invokd the god
 My first attempt great Jupiter succeed
 An annual offring in thy grove shall bleed
 A snowwhite steer before thy altar led
 Who like his mother bears aloft his head
 Butts with his threatning brows and bellowing stands
 And dares the fight and spurns the yellow sands

 Jove bowd the heavns and lent a gracious ear
 And thunderd on the left amidst the clear
 Sounded at once the bow and swiftly flies
 The featherd death and hisses thro the skies
 The steel thro both his temples forcd the way
 Extended on the ground Numanus lay
 Go now vain boaster and true valor scorn
 The Phrygians twice subdued yet make this third return
 Ascanius said no more The Trojans shake
 The heavns with shouting and new vigor take

 Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud
 To view the feats of arms and fighting crowd
 And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud
 Advance illustrious youth increase in fame
 And wide from east to west extend thy name
 Offspring of gods thyself and Rome shall owe
 To thee a race of demigods below
 This is the way to heavn the powrs divine
 From this beginning date the Julian line
 To thee to them and their victorious heirs
 The conquerd war is due and the vast world is theirs
 Troy is too narrow for thy name He said
 And plunging downward shot his radiant head
 Dispelld the breathing air that broke his flight
 Shorn of his beams a man to mortal sight
 Old Butes form he took Anchises squire
 Now left to rule Ascanius by his sire
 His wrinkled visage and his hoary hairs
 His mien his habit and his arms he wears
 And thus salutes the boy too forward for his years
 Suffice it thee thy fathers worthy son
 The warlike prize thou hast already won
 The god of archers gives thy youth a part
 Of his own praise nor envies equal art
 Now tempt the war no more He said and flew
 Obscure in air and vanishd from their view
 The Trojans by his arms their patron know
 And hear the twanging of his heavnly bow
 Then duteous force they use and Phoebus name
 To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame
 Undaunted they themselves no danger shun
 From wall to wall the shouts and clamors run
 They bend their bows they whirl their slings around
 Heaps of spent arrows fall and strew the ground
 And helms and shields and rattling arms resound
 The combat thickens like the storm that flies
 From westward when the showry Kids arise
 Or pattring hail comes pouring on the main
 When Jupiter descends in hardend rain
 Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound
 And with an armed winter strew the ground

 Pandrus and Bitias thunderbolts of war
 Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare
 On Idas top two youths of height and size
 Like firs that on their mother mountain rise
 Presuming on their force the gates unbar
 And of their own accord invite the war
 With fates averse against their kings command
 Armd on the right and on the left they stand
 And flank the passage shining steel they wear
 And waving crests above their heads appear
 Thus two tall oaks that Padus banks adorn
 Lift up to heavn their leafy heads unshorn
 And overpressd with natures heavy load
 Dance to the whistling winds and at each other nod
 In flows a tide of Latians when they see
 The gate set open and the passage free
 Bold Quercens with rash Tmarus rushing on
 Equicolus that in bright armor shone
 And Haemon first but soon repulsd they fly
 Or in the welldefended pass they die
 These with success are fird and those with rage
 And each on equal terms at length ingage
 Drawn from their lines and issuing on the plain
 The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain

 Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought
 When suddenly th unhopdfor news was brought
 The foes had left the fastness of their place
 Prevaild in fight and had his men in chase
 He quits th attack and to prevent their fate
 Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate
 The first he met Antiphates the brave
 But basebegotten on a Theban slave
 Sarpedons son he slew the deadly dart
 Found passage thro his breast and piercd his heart
 Fixd in the wound th Italian cornel stood
 Warmd in his lungs and in his vital blood
 Aphidnus next and Erymanthus dies
 And Meropes and the gigantic size
 Of Bitias threatning with his ardent eyes
 Not by the feeble dart he fell oppressd
 A dart were lost within that roomy breast
 But from a knotted lance large heavy strong
 Which roard like thunder as it whirld along
 Not two bull hides th impetuous force withhold
 Nor coat of double mail with scales of gold
 Down sunk the monster bulk and pressd the ground
 His arms and clattring shield on the vast body sound
 Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole
 Raisd on the seas the surges to control
 At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall
 Prone to the deep the stones disjointed fall
 Of the vast pile the scatterd ocean flies
 Black sands discolord froth and mingled mud arise
 The frighted billows roll and seek the shores
 Then trembles Prochyta then Ischia roars
 Typhoeus thrown beneath by Joves command
 Astonishd at the flaw that shakes the land
 Soon shifts his weary side and scarce awake
 With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back

 The warrior god the Latian troops inspird
 New strung their sinews and their courage fird
 But chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright
 Then black despair precipitates their flight

 When Pandarus beheld his brother killd
 The town with fear and wild confusion filld
 He turns the hinges of the heavy gate
 With both his hands and adds his shoulders to the weight
 Some happier friends within the walls inclosd
 The rest shut out to certain death exposd
 Fool as he was and frantic in his care
 T admit young Turnus and include the war
 He thrust amid the crowd securely bold
 Like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold
 Too late his blazing buckler they descry
 And sparkling fires that shot from either eye
 His mighty members and his ample breast
 His rattling armor and his crimson crest

 Far from that hated face the Trojans fly
 All but the fool who sought his destiny
 Mad Pandarus steps forth with vengeance vowd
 For Bitias death and threatens thus aloud
 These are not Ardeas walls nor this the town
 Amata proffers with Lavinias crown
 T is hostile earth you tread Of hope bereft
 No means of safe return by flight are left
 To whom with countnance calm and soul sedate
 Thus Turnus Then begin and try thy fate
 My message to the ghost of Priam bear
 Tell him a new Achilles sent thee there

 A lance of tough ground ash the Trojan threw
 Rough in the rind and knotted as it grew
 With his full force he whirld it first around
 But the soft yielding air receivd the wound
 Imperial Juno turnd the course before
 And fixd the wandring weapon in the door

 But hope not thou said Turnus when I strike
 To shun thy fate our force is not alike
 Nor thy steel temperd by the Lemnian god
 Then rising on his utmost stretch he stood
 And aimd from high the full descending blow
 Cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two
 Down sinks the giant with a thundring sound
 His pondrous limbs oppress the trembling ground
 Blood brains and foam gush from the gaping wound
 Scalp face and shoulders the keen steel divides
 And the shard visage hangs on equal sides
 The Trojans fly from their approaching fate
 And had the victor then securd the gate
 And to his troops without unclosd the bars
 One lucky day had ended all his wars
 But boiling youth and blind desire of blood
 Pushd on his fury to pursue the crowd
 Hamstringd behind unhappy Gyges died
 Then Phalaris is added to his side
 The pointed javlins from the dead he drew
 And their friends arms against their fellows threw
 Strong Halys stands in vain weak Phlegys flies
 Saturnia still at hand new force and fire supplies
 Then Halius Prytanis Alcander fall
 Ingagd against the foes who scald the wall
 But whom they feard without they found within
 At last tho late by Lynceus he was seen
 He calls new succors and assaults the prince
 But weak his force and vain is their defense
 Turnd to the right his sword the hero drew
 And at one blow the bold aggressor slew
 He joints the neck and with a stroke so strong
 The helm flies off and bears the head along
 Next him the huntsman Amycus he killd
 In darts invenomd and in poison skilld
 Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear
 And Creteus whom the Muses held so dear
 He fought with courage and he sung the fight
 Arms were his busness verses his delight

 The Trojan chiefs behold with rage and grief
 Their slaughterd friends and hasten their relief
 Bold Mnestheus rallies first the broken train
 Whom brave Seresthus and his troop sustain
 To save the living and revenge the dead
 Against one warriors arms all Troy they led
 O void of sense and courage Mnestheus cried
 Where can you hope your coward heads to hide
 Ah where beyond these rampires can you run
 One man and in your camp inclosd you shun
 Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast
 And pass unpunishd from a numrous host
 Forsaking honor and renouncing fame
 Your gods your country and your king you shame
 This just reproach their virtue does excite
 They stand they join they thicken to the fight

 Now Turnus doubts and yet disdains to yield
 But with slow paces measures back the field
 And inches to the walls where Tibers tide
 Washing the camp defends the weaker side
 The more he loses they advance the more
 And tread in evry step he trod before
 They shout they bear him back and whom by might
 They cannot conquer they oppress with weight

 As compassd with a wood of spears around
 The lordly lion still maintains his ground
 Grins horrible retires and turns again
 Threats his distended paws and shakes his mane
 He loses while in vain he presses on
 Nor will his courage let him dare to run
 So Turnus fares and unresolved of flight
 Moves tardy back and just recedes from fight
 Yet twice inragd the combat he renews
 Twice breaks and twice his broken foes pursues
 But now they swarm and with fresh troops supplied
 Come rolling on and rush from evry side
 Nor Juno who sustaind his arms before
 Dares with new strength suffice th exhausted store
 For Jove with sour commands sent Iris down
 To force th invader from the frighted town

 With labor spent no longer can he wield
 The heavy fanchion or sustain the shield
 Oerwhelmd with darts which from afar they fling
 The weapons round his hollow temples ring
 His golden helm gives way with stony blows
 Batterd and flat and beaten to his brows
 His crest is rashd away his ample shield
 Is falsified and round with javlins filld

 The foe now faint the Trojans overwhelm
 And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm
 Sick sweat succeeds he drops at evry pore
 With driving dust his cheeks are pasted oer
 Shorter and shorter evry gasp he takes
 And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes
 Plungd in the flood and made the waters fly
 The yellow god the welcome burthen bore
 And wipd the sweat and washd away the gore
 Then gently wafts him to the farther coast
 And sends him safe to cheer his anxious host




 BOOK X

 The gates of heavn unfold Jove summons all
 The gods to council in the common hall
 Sublimely seated he surveys from far
 The fields the camp the fortune of the war
 And all th inferior world From first to last
 The sovreign senate in degrees are placd

 Then thus th almighty sire began Ye gods
 Natives or denizens of blest abodes
 From whence these murmurs and this change of mind
 This backward fate from what was first designd
 Why this protracted war when my commands
 Pronouncd a peace and gave the Latian lands
 What fear or hope on either part divides
 Our heavns and arms our powers on diffrent sides
 A lawful time of war at length will come
 Nor need your haste anticipate the doom
 When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome
 Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains
 And like a flood come pouring on the plains
 Then is your time for faction and debate
 For partial favor and permitted hate
 Let now your immature dissension cease
 Sit quiet and compose your souls to peace

 Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge
 But lovely Venus thus replies at large
 O powr immense eternal energy
 For to what else protection can we fly
 Seest thou the proud Rutulians how they dare
 In fields unpunishd and insult my care
 How lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his train
 In shining arms triumphant on the plain
 Evn in their lines and trenches they contend
 And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend
 The town is filld with slaughter and oerfloats
 With a red deluge their increasing moats
 Aeneas ignorant and far from thence
 Has left a camp exposd without defense
 This endless outrage shall they still sustain
 Shall Troy renewd be forcd and fird again
 A second siege my banishd issue fears
 And a new Diomede in arms appears
 One more audacious mortal will be found
 And I thy daughter wait another wound
 Yet if with fates averse without thy leave
 The Latian lands my progeny receive
 Bear they the pains of violated law
 And thy protection from their aid withdraw
 But if the gods their sure success foretell
 If those of heavn consent with those of hell
 To promise Italy who dare debate
 The powr of Jove or fix another fate
 What should I tell of tempests on the main
 Of Aeolus usurping Neptunes reign
 Of Iris sent with Bacchanalian heat
 T inspire the matrons and destroy the fleet
 Now Juno to the Stygian sky descends
 Solicits hell for aid and arms the fiends
 That new example wanted yet above
 An act that well became the wife of Jove
 Alecto raisd by her with rage inflames
 The peaceful bosoms of the Latian dames
 Imperial sway no more exalts my mind
 Such hopes I had indeed while Heavn was kind
 Now let my happier foes possess my place
 Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race
 And conquer they whom you with conquest grace
 Since you can spare from all your wide command
 No spot of earth no hospitable land
 Which may my wandring fugitives receive
 Since haughty Juno will not give you leave
 Then father if I still may use that name
 By ruind Troy yet smoking from the flame
 I beg you let Ascanius by my care
 Be freed from danger and dismissd the war
 Inglorious let him live without a crown
 The father may be cast on coasts unknown
 Struggling with fate but let me save the son
 Mine is Cythera mine the Cyprian towrs
 In those recesses and those sacred bowrs
 Obscurely let him rest his right resign
 To promisd empire and his Julian line
 Then Carthage may th Ausonian towns destroy
 Nor fear the race of a rejected boy
 What profits it my son to scape the fire
 Armd with his gods and loaded with his sire
 To pass the perils of the seas and wind
 Evade the Greeks and leave the war behind
 To reach th Italian shores if after all
 Our second Pergamus is doomd to fall
 Much better had he curbd his high desires
 And hoverd oer his illextinguishd fires
 To Simois banks the fugitives restore
 And give them back to war and all the woes before

 Deep indignation swelld Saturnias heart
 And must I own she said my secret smart
 What with more decence were in silence kept
 And but for this unjust reproach had slept
 Did god or man your favrite son advise
 With war unhopd the Latians to surprise
 By fate you boast and by the gods decree
 He left his native land for Italy
 Confess the truth by mad Cassandra more
 Than Heavn inspird he sought a foreign shore
 Did I persuade to trust his second Troy
 To the raw conduct of a beardless boy
 With walls unfinishd which himself forsakes
 And thro the waves a wandring voyage takes
 When have I urgd him meanly to demand
 The Tuscan aid and arm a quiet land
 Did I or Iris give this mad advice
 Or made the fool himself the fatal choice
 You think it hard the Latians should destroy
 With swords your Trojans and with fires your Troy
 Hard and unjust indeed for men to draw
 Their native air nor take a foreign law
 That Turnus is permitted still to live
 To whom his birth a god and goddess give
 But yet is just and lawful for your line
 To drive their fields and force with fraud to join
 Realms not your own among your clans divide
 And from the bridegroom tear the promisd bride
 Petition while you public arms prepare
 Pretend a peace and yet provoke a war
 T was givn to you your darling son to shroud
 To draw the dastard from the fighting crowd
 And for a man obtend an empty cloud
 From flaming fleets you turnd the fire away
 And changd the ships to daughters of the sea
 But is my crime the Queen of Heavn offends
 If she presume to save her suffring friends
 Your son not knowing what his foes decree
 You say is absent absent let him be
 Yours is Cythera yours the Cyprian towrs
 The soft recesses and the sacred bowrs
 Why do you then these needless arms prepare
 And thus provoke a people prone to war
 Did I with fire the Trojan town deface
 Or hinder from return your exild race
 Was I the cause of mischief or the man
 Whose lawless lust the fatal war began
 Think on whose faith th adultrous youth relied
 Who promisd who procurd the Spartan bride
 When all th united states of Greece combind
 To purge the world of the perfidious kind
 Then was your time to fear the Trojan fate
 Your quarrels and complaints are now too late

 Thus Juno Murmurs rise with mixd applause
 Just as they favor or dislike the cause
 So winds when yet unfledgd in woods they lie
 In whispers first their tender voices try
 Then issue on the main with bellowing rage
 And storms to trembling mariners presage

 Then thus to both replied th imperial god
 Who shakes heavns axles with his awful nod
 When he begins the silent senate stand
 With revrence listning to the dread command
 The clouds dispel the winds their breath restrain
 And the hushd waves lie flatted on the main
 Celestials your attentive ears incline
 Since said the god the Trojans must not join
 In wishd alliance with the Latian line
 Since endless jarrings and immortal hate
 Tend but to discompose our happy state
 The war henceforward be resignd to fate
 Each to his proper fortune stand or fall
 Equal and unconcernd I look on all
 Rutulians Trojans are the same to me
 And both shall draw the lots their fates decree
 Let these assault if Fortune be their friend
 And if she favors those let those defend
 The Fates will find their way The Thundrer said
 And shook the sacred honors of his head
 Attesting Styx th inviolable flood
 And the black regions of his brother god
 Trembled the poles of heavn and earth confessd the nod
 This end the sessions had the senate rise
 And to his palace wait their sovreign thro the skies

 Meantime intent upon their siege the foes
 Within their walls the Trojan host inclose
 They wound they kill they watch at evry gate
 Renew the fires and urge their happy fate

 Th Aeneans wish in vain their wanted chief
 Hopeless of flight more hopeless of relief
 Thin on the towrs they stand and evn those few
 A feeble fainting and dejected crew
 Yet in the face of danger some there stood
 The two bold brothers of Sarpedons blood
 Asius and Acmon both th Assaraci
 Young Haemon and tho young resolvd to die
 With these were Clarus and Thymoetes joind
 Tibris and Castor both of Lycian kind
 From Acmons hands a rolling stone there came
 So large it half deservd a mountains name
 Strongsinewd was the youth and big of bone
 His brother Mnestheus could not more have done
 Or the great father of th intrepid son
 Some firebrands throw some flights of arrows send
 And some with darts and some with stones defend

 Amid the press appears the beauteous boy
 The care of Venus and the hope of Troy
 His lovely face unarmd his head was bare
 In ringlets oer his shoulders hung his hair
 His forehead circled with a diadem
 Distinguishd from the crowd he shines a gem
 Enchasd in gold or polishd ivry set
 Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet

 Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war
 Directing pointed arrows from afar
 And death with poison armd in Lydia born
 Where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn
 Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands
 And leaves a rich manure of golden sands
 There Capys author of the Capuan name
 And there was Mnestheus too increasd in fame
 Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame

 Thus mortal war was wagd on either side
 Meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide
 For anxious from Evander when he went
 He sought the Tyrrhene camp and Tarchons tent
 Exposd the cause of coming to the chief
 His name and country told and askd relief
 Proposd the terms his own small strength declard
 What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepard
 What Turnus bold and violent designd
 Then shewd the slippry state of humankind
 And fickle fortune warnd him to beware
 And to his wholesome counsel added prayr
 Tarchon without delay the treaty signs
 And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins

 They soon set sail nor now the fates withstand
 Their forces trusted with a foreign hand
 Aeneas leads upon his stern appear
 Two lions carvd which rising Ida bear
 Ida to wandring Trojans ever dear
 Under their grateful shade Aeneas sate
 Revolving wars events and various fate
 His left young Pallas kept fixd to his side
 And oft of winds enquird and of the tide
 Oft of the stars and of their watry way
 And what he sufferd both by land and sea

 Now sacred sisters open all your spring
 The Tuscan leaders and their army sing
 Which followd great Aeneas to the war
 Their arms their numbers and their names declare

 A thousand youths brave Massicus obey
 Borne in the Tiger thro the foaming sea
 From Asium brought and Cosa by his care
 For arms light quivers bows and shafts they bear
 Fierce Abas next his men bright armor wore
 His stern Apollos golden statue bore
 Six hundred Populonia sent along
 All skilld in martial exercise and strong
 Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins
 An isle renownd for steel and unexhausted mines
 Asylas on his prow the third appears
 Who heavn interprets and the wandring stars
 From offerd entrails prodigies expounds
 And peals of thunder with presaging sounds
 A thousand spears in warlike order stand
 Sent by the Pisans under his command

 Fair Astur follows in the watry field
 Proud of his managd horse and painted shield
 Gravisca noisome from the neighbring fen
 And his own Caere sent three hundred men
 With those which Minios fields and Pyrgi gave
 All bred in arms unanimous and brave

 Thou Muse the name of Cinyras renew
 And brave Cupavo followd but by few
 Whose helm confessd the lineage of the man
 And bore with wings displayd a silver swan
 Love was the fault of his famd ancestry
 Whose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly
 For Cycnus lovd unhappy Phaeton
 And sung his loss in poplar groves alone
 Beneath the sister shades to soothe his grief
 Heavn heard his song and hastend his relief
 And changd to snowy plumes his hoary hair
 And wingd his flight to chant aloft in air
 His son Cupavo brushd the briny flood
 Upon his stern a brawny Centaur stood
 Who heavd a rock and threatning still to throw
 With lifted hands alarmd the seas below
 They seemd to fear the formidable sight
 And rolld their billows on to speed his flight

 Ocnus was next who led his native train
 Of hardy warriors thro the watry plain
 The son of Manto by the Tuscan stream
 From whence the Mantuan town derives the name
 An ancient city but of mixd descent
 Three sevral tribes compose the government
 Four towns are under each but all obey
 The Mantuan laws and own the Tuscan sway

 Hate to Mezentius armd five hundred more
 Whom Mincius from his sire Benacus bore
 Mincius with wreaths of reeds his forehead coverd oer
 These grave Auletes leads a hundred sweep
 With stretching oars at once the glassy deep
 Him and his martial train the Triton bears
 High on his poop the seagreen god appears
 Frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound
 And at the blast the billows dance around
 A hairy man above the waist he shows
 A porpoise tail beneath his belly grows
 And ends a fish his breast the waves divides
 And froth and foam augment the murmring tides

 Full thirty ships transport the chosen train
 For Troys relief and scour the briny main

 Now was the world forsaken by the sun
 And Phoebe half her nightly race had run
 The careful chief who never closd his eyes
 Himself the rudder holds the sails supplies
 A choir of Nereids meet him on the flood
 Once his own galleys hewn from Idas wood
 But now as many nymphs the sea they sweep
 As rode before tall vessels on the deep
 They know him from afar and in a ring
 Inclose the ship that bore the Trojan king
 Cymodoce whose voice excelld the rest
 Above the waves advancd her snowy breast
 Her right hand stops the stern her left divides
 The curling ocean and corrects the tides
 She spoke for all the choir and thus began
 With pleasing words to warn th unknowing man
 Sleeps our lovd lord O goddessborn awake
 Spread evry sail pursue your watry track
 And haste your course Your navy once were we
 From Idas height descending to the sea
 Till Turnus as at anchor fixd we stood
 Presumd to violate our holy wood
 Then loosd from shore we fled his fires profane
 Unwillingly we broke our masters chain
 And since have sought you thro the Tuscan main
 The mighty Mother changd our forms to these
 And gave us life immortal in the seas
 But young Ascanius in his camp distressd
 By your insulting foes is hardly pressd
 Th Arcadian horsemen and Etrurian host
 Advance in order on the Latian coast
 To cut their way the Daunian chief designs
 Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines
 Thou when the rosy morn restores the light
 First arm thy soldiers for th ensuing fight
 Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield
 And bear aloft th impenetrable shield
 Tomorrows sun unless my skill be vain
 Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain
 Parting she spoke and with immortal force
 Pushd on the vessel in her watry course
 For well she knew the way Impelld behind
 The ship flew forward and outstrippd the wind
 The rest make up Unknowing of the cause
 The chief admires their speed and happy omens draws

 Then thus he prayd and fixd on heavn his eyes
 Hear thou great Mother of the deities
 With turrets crownd on Idas holy hill
 Fierce tigers reind and curbd obey thy will
 Firm thy own omens lead us on to fight
 And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right

 He said no more And now renewing day
 Had chasd the shadows of the night away
 He chargd the soldiers with preventing care
 Their flags to follow and their arms prepare
 Warnd of th ensuing fight and bade em hope the war
 Now his lofty poop he viewd below
 His camp incompassd and th inclosing foe
 His blazing shield imbracd he held on high
 The camp receive the sign and with loud shouts reply
 Hope arms their courage from their towrs they throw
 Their darts with double force and drive the foe
 Thus at the signal givn the cranes arise
 Before the stormy south and blacken all the skies

 King Turnus wonderd at the fight renewd
 Till looking back the Trojan fleet he viewd
 The seas with swelling canvas coverd oer
 And the swift ships descending on the shore
 The Latians saw from far with dazzled eyes
 The radiant crest that seemd in flames to rise
 And dart diffusive fires around the field
 And the keen glittring of the golden shield
 Thus threatning comets when by night they rise
 Shoot sanguine streams and sadden all the skies
 So Sirius flashing forth sinister lights
 Pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright

 Yet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent
 To man the shores and hinder their descent
 And thus awakes the courage of his friends
 What you so long have wishd kind Fortune sends
 In ardent arms to meet th invading foe
 You find and find him at advantage now
 Yours is the day you need but only dare
 Your swords will make you masters of the war
 Your sires your sons your houses and your lands
 And dearest wifes are all within your hands
 Be mindful of the race from whence you came
 And emulate in arms your fathers fame
 Now take the time while staggring yet they stand
 With feet unfirm and prepossess the strand
 Fortune befriends the bold Nor more he said
 But balancd whom to leave and whom to lead
 Then these elects the landing to prevent
 And those he leaves to keep the city pent

 Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore
 Some are by boats exposd by bridges more
 With labring oars they bear along the strand
 Where the tide languishes and leap aland
 Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes
 And where no ford he finds no water fries
 Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar
 But smoothly slide along and swell the shore
 That course he steerd and thus he gave command
 Here ply your oars and at all hazard land
 Force on the vessel that her keel may wound
 This hated soil and furrow hostile ground
 Let me securely land I ask no more
 Then sink my ships or shatter on the shore

 This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends
 They tug at evry oar and evry stretcher bends
 They run their ships aground the vessels knock
 Thus forcd ashore and tremble with the shock
 Tarchons alone was lost that stranded stood
 Stuck on a bank and beaten by the flood
 She breaks her back the loosend sides give way
 And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea
 Their broken oars and floating planks withstand
 Their passage while they labor to the land
 And ebbing tides bear back upon th uncertain sand

 Now Turnus leads his troops without delay
 Advancing to the margin of the sea
 The trumpets sound Aeneas first assaild
 The clowns newraisd and raw and soon prevaild
 Great Theron fell an omen of the fight
 Great Theron large of limbs of giant height
 He first in open field defied the prince
 But armor scald with gold was no defense
 Against the fated sword which opend wide
 His plated shield and piercd his naked side
 Next Lichas fell who not like others born
 Was from his wretched mother rippd and torn
 Sacred O Phoebus from his birth to thee
 For his beginning life from biting steel was free
 Not far from him was Gyas laid along
 Of monstrous bulk with Cisseus fierce and strong
 Vain bulk and strength for when the chief assaild
 Nor valor nor Herculean arms availd
 Nor their famd father wont in war to go
 With great Alcides while he toild below
 The noisy Pharos next receivd his death
 Aeneas writhd his dart and stoppd his bawling breath
 Then wretched Cydon had receivd his doom
 Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom
 And sought with lust obscene polluted joys
 The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys
 Had not his sevn bold brethren stoppd the course
 Of the fierce champions with united force
 Sevn darts were thrown at once and some rebound
 From his bright shield some on his helmet sound
 The rest had reachd him but his mothers care
 Prevented those and turnd aside in air

 The prince then calld Achates to supply
 The spears that knew the way to victory
 Those fatal weapons which inurd to blood
 In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood
 Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain
 Against our foes on this contended plain
 He said then seizd a mighty spear and threw
 Which wingd with fate thro Maeons buckler flew
 Piercd all the brazen plates and reachd his heart
 He staggerd with intolerable smart
 Alcanor saw and reachd but reachd in vain
 His helping hand his brother to sustain
 A second spear which kept the former course
 From the same hand and sent with equal force
 His right arm piercd and holding on bereft
 His use of both and piniond down his left
 Then Numitor from his dead brother drew
 Th illomend spear and at the Trojan threw
 Preventing fate directs the lance awry
 Which glancing only markd Achates thigh

 In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came
 And from afar at Dryops took his aim
 The spear flew hissing thro the middle space
 And piercd his throat directed at his face
 It stoppd at once the passage of his wind
 And the free soul to flitting air resignd
 His forehead was the first that struck the ground
 Lifeblood and life rushd mingled thro the wound
 He slew three brothers of the Borean race
 And three whom Ismarus their native place
 Had sent to war but all the sons of Thrace
 Halesus next the bold Aurunci leads
 The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds
 Conspicuous on his horse On either hand
 These fight to keep and those to win the land
 With mutual blood th Ausonian soil is dyed
 While on its borders each their claim decide
 As wintry winds contending in the sky
 With equal force of lungs their titles try
 They rage they roar the doubtful rack of heavn
 Stands without motion and the tide undrivn
 Each bent to conquer neither side to yield
 They long suspend the fortune of the field
 Both armies thus perform what courage can
 Foot set to foot and mingled man to man

 But in another part th Arcadian horse
 With ill success ingage the Latin force
 For where th impetuous torrent rushing down
 Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown
 They left their coursers and unusd to fight
 On foot were scatterd in a shameful flight
 Pallas who with disdain and grief had viewd
 His foes pursuing and his friends pursued
 Usd threatnings mixd with prayrs his last resource
 With these to move their minds with those to fire their force
 Which way companions whether would you run
 By you yourselves and mighty battles won
 By my great sire by his establishd name
 And early promise of my future fame
 By my youth emulous of equal right
 To share his honors shun ignoble flight
 Trust not your feet your hands must hew way
 Thro yon black body and that thick array
 T is thro that forward path that we must come
 There lies our way and that our passage home
 Nor powrs above nor destinies below
 Oppress our arms with equal strength we go
 With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe
 See on what foot we stand a scanty shore
 The sea behind our enemies before
 No passage left unless we swim the main
 Or forcing these the Trojan trenches gain
 This said he strode with eager haste along
 And bore amidst the thickest of the throng
 Lagus the first he met with fate to foe
 Had heavd a stone of mighty weight to throw
 Stooping the spear descended on his chine
 Just where the bone distinguished either loin
 It stuck so fast so deeply buried lay
 That scarce the victor forcd the steel away
 Hisbon came on but while he movd too slow
 To wishd revenge the prince prevents his blow
 For warding his at once at once he pressd
 And plungd the fatal weapon in his breast
 Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust
 Who staind his stepdams bed with impious lust
 And after him the Daucian twins were slain
 Laris and Thymbrus on the Latian plain
 So wondrous like in feature shape and size
 As causd an error in their parents eyes
 Grateful mistake but soon the sword decides
 The nice distinction and their fate divides
 For Thymbrus head was loppd and Laris hand
 Dismemberd sought its owner on the strand
 The trembling fingers yet the fauchion strain
 And threaten still th intended stroke in vain

 Now to renew the charge th Arcadians came
 Sight of such acts and sense of honest shame
 And grief with anger mixd their minds inflame
 Then with a casual blow was Rhoeteus slain
 Who chancd as Pallas threw to cross the plain
 The flying spear was after Ilus sent
 But Rhoeteus happend on a death unmeant
 From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled
 The lance athwart his body laid him dead
 Rolld from his chariot with a mortal wound
 And intercepted fate he spurnd the ground
 As when in summer welcome winds arise
 The watchful shepherd to the forest flies
 And fires the midmost plants contagion spreads
 And catching flames infect the neighbring heads
 Around the forest flies the furious blast
 And all the leafy nation sinks at last
 And Vulcan rides in triumph oer the waste
 The pastor pleasd with his dire victory
 Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky
 So Pallas troops their scatterd strength unite
 And pouring on their foes their prince delight

 Halesus came fierce with desire of blood
 But first collected in his arms he stood
 Advancing then he plied the spear so well
 Ladon Demodocus and Pheres fell
 Around his head he tossd his glittring brand
 And from Strymonius hewd his better hand
 Held up to guard his throat then hurld a stone
 At Thoas ample front and piercd the bone
 It struck beneath the space of either eye
 And blood and mingled brains together fly
 Deep skilld in future fates Halesus sire
 Did with the youth to lonely groves retire
 But when the fathers mortal race was run
 Dire destiny laid hold upon the son
 And hauld him to the war to find beneath
 Th Evandrian spear a memorable death
 Pallas th encounter seeks but ere he throws
 To Tuscan Tiber thus addressd his vows
 O sacred stream direct my flying dart
 And give to pass the proud Halesus heart
 His arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear
 Pleasd with the bribe the god receivd his prayr
 For while his shield protects a friend distressd
 The dart came driving on and piercd his breast

 But Lausus no small portion of the war
 Permits not panic fear to reign too far
 Causd by the death of so renownd a knight
 But by his own example cheers the fight
 Fierce Abas first he slew Abas the stay
 Of Trojan hopes and hindrance of the day
 The Phrygian troops escapd the Greeks in vain
 They and their mixd allies now load the plain
 To the rude shock of war both armies came
 Their leaders equal and their strength the same
 The rear so pressd the front they could not wield
 Their angry weapons to dispute the field
 Here Pallas urges on and Lausus there
 Of equal youth and beauty both appear
 But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air
 Their congress in the field great Jove withstands
 Both doomd to fall but fall by greater hands

 Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief
 Of Lausus danger urging swift relief
 With his drivn chariot he divides the crowd
 And making to his friends thus calls aloud
 Let none presume his needless aid to join
 Retire and clear the field the fight is mine
 To this right hand is Pallas only due
 O were his father here my just revenge to view
 From the forbidden space his men retird
 Pallas their awe and his stern words admird
 Surveyd him oer and oer with wondring sight
 Struck with his haughty mien and towring height
 Then to the king Your empty vaunts forbear
 Success I hope and fate I cannot fear
 Alive or dead I shall deserve a name
 Jove is impartial and to both the same
 He said and to the void advancd his pace
 Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face
 Then Turnus from his chariot leaping light
 Addressd himself on foot to single fight
 And as a lion when he spies from far
 A bull that seems to meditate the war
 Bending his neck and spurning back the sand
 Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand
 Imagine eager Turnus not more slow
 To rush from high on his unequal foe

 Young Pallas when he saw the chief advance
 Within due distance of his flying lance
 Prepares to charge him first resolvd to try
 If fortune would his want of force supply
 And thus to Heavn and Hercules addressd
 Alcides once on earth Evanders guest
 His son adjures you by those holy rites
 That hospitable board those genial nights
 Assist my great attempt to gain this prize
 And let proud Turnus view with dying eyes
 His ravishd spoils T was heard the vain request
 Alcides mournd and stifled sighs within his breast
 Then Jove to soothe his sorrow thus began
 Short bounds of life are set to mortal man
 T is virtues work alone to stretch the narrow span
 So many sons of gods in bloody fight
 Around the walls of Troy have lost the light
 My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe
 Nor I his mighty sire could ward the blow
 Evn Turnus shortly shall resign his breath
 And stands already on the verge of death
 This said the god permits the fatal fight
 But from the Latian fields averts his sight

 Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw
 And having thrown his shining fauchion drew
 The steel just grazd along the shoulder joint
 And markd it slightly with the glancing point
 Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew
 And poisd his pointed spear before he threw
 Then as the winged weapon whizzd along
 See now said he whose arm is better strung
 The spear kept on the fatal course unstayd
 By plates of irn which oer the shield were laid
 Thro folded brass and tough bull hides it passd
 His corslet piercd and reachd his heart at last
 In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood
 The soul comes issuing with the vital blood
 He falls his arms upon his body sound
 And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground

 Turnus bestrode the corpse Arcadians hear
 Said he my message to your master bear
 Such as the sire deservd the son I send
 It costs him dear to be the Phrygians friend
 The lifeless body tell him I bestow
 Unaskd to rest his wandring ghost below
 He said and trampled down with all the force
 Of his left foot and spurnd the wretched corse
 Then snatchd the shining belt with gold inlaid
 The belt Eurytions artful hands had made
 Where fifty fatal brides expressd to sight
 All in the compass of one mournful night
 Deprivd their bridegrooms of returning light

 In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore
 Those golden spoils and in a worse he wore
 O mortals blind in fate who never know
 To bear high fortune or endure the low
 The time shall come when Turnus but in vain
 Shall wish untouchd the trophies of the slain
 Shall wish the fatal belt were far away
 And curse the dire remembrance of the day

 The sad Arcadians from th unhappy field
 Bear back the breathless body on a shield
 O grace and grief of war at once restord
 With praises to thy sire at once deplord
 One day first sent thee to the fighting field
 Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle killd
 One day beheld thee dead and borne upon thy shield
 This dismal news not from uncertain fame
 But sad spectators to the hero came
 His friends upon the brink of ruin stand
 Unless relievd by his victorious hand
 He whirls his sword around without delay
 And hews thro adverse foes an ample way
 To find fierce Turnus of his conquest proud
 Evander Pallas all that friendship owd
 To large deserts are present to his eyes
 His plighted hand and hospitable ties

 Four sons of Sulmo four whom Ufens bred
 He took in fight and living victims led
 To please the ghost of Pallas and expire
 In sacrifice before his funral fire
 At Magus next he threw he stoopd below
 The flying spear and shunnd the promisd blow
 Then creeping claspd the heros knees and prayd
 By young Iulus by thy fathers shade
 O spare my life and send me back to see
 My longing sire and tender progeny
 A lofty house I have and wealth untold
 In silver ingots and in bars of gold
 All these and sums besides which see no day
 The ransom of this one poor life shall pay
 If I survive will Troy the less prevail
 A single souls too light to turn the scale
 He said The hero sternly thus replied
 Thy bars and ingots and the sums beside
 Leave for thy childrens lot Thy Turnus broke
 All rules of war by one relentless stroke
 When Pallas fell so deems nor deems alone
 My fathers shadow but my living son
 Thus having said of kind remorse bereft
 He seizd his helm and draggd him with his left
 Then with his right hand while his neck he wreathd
 Up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheathd

 Apollos priest Emonides was near
 His holy fillets on his front appear
 Glittring in arms he shone amidst the crowd
 Much of his god more of his purple proud
 Him the fierce Trojan followd thro the field
 The holy coward fell and forcd to yield
 The prince stood oer the priest and at one blow
 Sent him an offring to the shades below
 His arms Seresthus on his shoulders bears
 Designd a trophy to the God of Wars

 Vulcanian Caeculus renews the fight
 And Umbro born upon the mountains height
 The champion cheers his troops t encounter those
 And seeks revenge himself on other foes
 At Anxurs shield he drove and at the blow
 Both shield and arm to ground together go
 Anxur had boasted much of magic charms
 And thought he wore impenetrable arms
 So made by mutterd spells and from the spheres
 Had life securd in vain for length of years
 Then Tarquitus the field in triumph trod
 A nymph his mother his sire a god
 Exulting in bright arms he braves the prince
 With his protended lance he makes defense
 Bears back his feeble foe then pressing on
 Arrests his better hand and drags him down
 Stands oer the prostrate wretch and as he lay
 Vain tales inventing and prepard to pray
 Mows off his head the trunk a moment stood
 Then sunk and rolld along the sand in blood
 The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain
 Lie there proud man unpitied on the plain
 Lie there inglorious and without a tomb
 Far from thy mother and thy native home
 Exposed to savage beasts and birds of prey
 Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea

 On Lycas and Antaeus next he ran
 Two chiefs of Turnus and who led his van
 They fled for fear with these he chasd along
 Camers the yellowlockd and Numa strong
 Both great in arms and both were fair and young
 Camers was son to Volscens lately slain
 In wealth surpassing all the Latian train
 And in Amycla fixd his silent easy reign
 And as Aegaeon when with heavn he strove
 Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove
 Movd all his hundred hands provokd the war
 Defied the forky lightning from afar
 At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires
 And flash for flash returns and fires for fires
 In his right hand as many swords he wields
 And takes the thunder on as many shields
 With strength like his the Trojan hero stood
 And soon the fields with falling corps were strowd
 When once his fauchion found the taste of blood
 With fury scarce to be conceivd he flew
 Against Niphaeus whom four coursers drew
 They when they see the fiery chief advance
 And pushing at their chests his pointed lance
 Wheeld with so swift a motion mad with fear
 They threw their master headlong from the chair
 They stare they start nor stop their course before
 They bear the bounding chariot to the shore

 Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains
 With two white steeds but Liger holds the reins
 And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains
 Bold brethren both The former wavd in air
 His flaming sword Aeneas couchd his spear
 Unusd to threats and more unusd to fear
 Then Liger thus Thy confidence is vain
 To scape from hence as from the Trojan plain
 Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode
 Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode
 Nor Venus veil is here near Neptunes shield
 Thy fatal hour is come and this the field
 Thus Liger vainly vaunts the Trojan peer
 Returnd his answer with his flying spear
 As Lucagus to lash his horses bends
 Prone to the wheels and his left foot protends
 Prepard for fight the fatal dart arrives
 And thro the borders of his buckler drives
 Passd thro and piercd his groin the deadly wound
 Cast from his chariot rolld him on the ground
 Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite
 Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight
 Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat
 But you yourself forsake your empty seat
 He said and seizd at once the loosend rein
 For Liger lay already on the plain
 By the same shock then stretching out his hands
 The recreant thus his wretched life demands
 Now by thyself O more than mortal man
 By her and him from whom thy breath began
 Who formd thee thus divine I beg thee spare
 This forfeit life and hear thy suppliants prayr
 Thus much he spoke and more he would have said
 But the stern hero turnd aside his head
 And cut him short I hear another man
 You talkd not thus before the fight began
 Now take your turn and as a brother should
 Attend your brother to the Stygian flood
 Then thro his breast his fatal sword he sent
 And the soul issued at the gaping vent

 As storms the skies and torrents tear the ground
 Thus ragd the prince and scatterd deaths around
 At length Ascanius and the Trojan train
 Broke from the camp so long besiegd in vain

 Meantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man
 Held conference with his queen and thus began
 My sister goddess and wellpleasing wife
 Still think you Venus aid supports the strife
 Sustains her Trojans or themselves alone
 With inborn valor force their fortune on
 How fierce in fight with courage undecayd
 Judge if such warriors want immortal aid
 To whom the goddess with the charming eyes
 Soft in her tone submissively replies
 Why O my sovreign lord whose frown I fear
 And cannot unconcernd your anger bear
 Why urge you thus my grief when if I still
 As once I was were mistress of your will
 From your almighty powr your pleasing wife
 Might gain the grace of lengthning Turnus life
 Securely snatch him from the fatal fight
 And give him to his aged fathers sight
 Now let him perish since you hold it good
 And glut the Trojans with his pious blood
 Yet from our lineage he derives his name
 And in the fourth degree from god Pilumnus came
 Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine
 And offers daily incense at your shrine

 Then shortly thus the sovreign god replied
 Since in my powr and goodness you confide
 If for a little space a lengthend span
 You beg reprieve for this expiring man
 I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence
 From instant fate and can so far dispense
 But if some secret meaning lies beneath
 To save the shortlivd youth from destind death
 Or if a farther thought you entertain
 To change the fates you feed your hopes in vain
 To whom the goddess thus with weeping eyes
 And what if that request your tongue denies
 Your heart should grant and not a short reprieve
 But length of certain life to Turnus give
 Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth
 If my presaging soul divines with truth
 Which O I wish might err thro causeless fears
 And you for you have powr prolong his years

 Thus having said involvd in clouds she flies
 And drives a storm before her thro the skies
 Swift she descends alighting on the plain
 Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain
 Of air condensd a specter soon she made
 And what Aeneas was such seemd the shade
 Adornd with Dardan arms the phantom bore
 His head aloft a plumy crest he wore
 This hand appeard a shining sword to wield
 And that sustaind an imitated shield
 With manly mien he stalkd along the ground
 Nor wanted voice belied nor vaunting sound
 Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight
 Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night
 The specter seems the Daunian chief to dare
 And flourishes his empty sword in air
 At this advancing Turnus hurld his spear
 The phantom wheeld and seemd to fly for fear
 Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled
 And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed
 Whether O coward thus he calls aloud
 Nor found he spoke to wind and chasd a cloud
 Why thus forsake your bride Receive from me
 The fated land you sought so long by sea
 He said and brandishing at once his blade
 With eager pace pursued the flying shade
 By chance a ship was fastend to the shore
 Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore
 The plank was ready laid for safe ascent
 For shelter there the trembling shadow bent
 And skippt and skulkd and under hatches went
 Exulting Turnus with regardless haste
 Ascends the plank and to the galley passd
 Scarce had he reachd the prow Saturnias hand
 The haulsers cuts and shoots the ship from land
 With wind in poop the vessel plows the sea
 And measures back with speed her former way
 Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe
 And sends his slaughterd troops to shades below

 The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud
 And flew sublime and vanishd in a cloud
 Too late young Turnus the delusion found
 Far on the sea still making from the ground
 Then thankless for a life redeemd by shame
 With sense of honor stung and forfeit fame
 Fearful besides of what in fight had passd
 His hands and haggard eyes to heavn he cast
 O Jove he cried for what offense have
 Deservd to bear this endless infamy
 Whence am I forcd and whether am I borne
 How and with what reproach shall I return
 Shall ever I behold the Latian plain
 Or see Laurentums lofty towrs again
 What will they say of their deserting chief
 The war was mine I fly from their relief
 I led to slaughter and in slaughter leave
 And evn from hence their dying groans receive
 Here overmatchd in fight in heaps they lie
 There scatterd oer the fields ignobly fly
 Gape wide O earth and draw me down alive
 Or O ye pitying winds a wretch relieve
 On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive
 Or set me shipwrackd on some desart shore
 Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more
 Unknown to friends or foes or conscious Fame
 Lest she should follow and my flight proclaim

 Thus Turnus ravd and various fates revolvd
 The choice was doubtful but the death resolvd
 And now the sword and now the sea took place
 That to revenge and this to purge disgrace
 Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main
 By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain
 Thrice he the sword assayd and thrice the flood
 But Juno movd with pity both withstood
 And thrice repressd his rage strong gales supplied
 And pushd the vessel oer the swelling tide
 At length she lands him on his native shores
 And to his fathers longing arms restores

 Meantime by Joves impulse Mezentius armd
 Succeeding Turnus with his ardor warmd
 His fainting friends reproachd their shameful flight
 Repelld the victors and renewd the fight
 Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire
 Such is their hate and such their fierce desire
 Of wishd revenge on him and him alone
 All hands employd and all their darts are thrown
 He like a solid rock by seas inclosd
 To raging winds and roaring waves opposd
 From his proud summit looking down disdains
 Their empty menace and unmovd remains

 Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead
 Then Latagus and Palmus as he fled
 At Latagus a weighty stone he flung
 His face was flatted and his helmet rung
 But Palmus from behind receives his wound
 Hamstringd he falls and grovels on the ground
 His crest and armor from his body torn
 Thy shoulders Lausus and thy head adorn
 Evas and Mimas both of Troy he slew
 Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew
 Born on that fatal night when big with fire
 The queen producd young Paris to his sire
 But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain
 Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain

 And as a savage boar on mountains bred
 With forest mast and fattning marshes fed
 When once he sees himself in toils inclosd
 By huntsmen and their eager hounds opposd
 He whets his tusks and turns and dares the war
 Th invaders dart their javlins from afar
 All keep aloof and safely shout around
 But none presumes to give a nearer wound
 He frets and froths erects his bristled hide
 And shakes a grove of lances from his side
 Not otherwise the troops with hate inspird
 And just revenge against the tyrant fird
 Their darts with clamor at a distance drive
 And only keep the languishd war alive

 From Coritus came Acron to the fight
 Who left his spouse betrothd and unconsummate night
 Mezentius sees him thro the squadrons ride
 Proud of the purple favors of his bride
 Then as a hungry lion who beholds
 A gamesome goat who frisks about the folds
 Or beamy stag that grazes on the plain
 He runs he roars he shakes his rising mane
 He grins and opens wide his greedy jaws
 The prey lies panting underneath his paws
 He fills his famishd maw his mouth runs oer
 With unchewd morsels while he churns the gore
 So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes
 And first unhappy Acron overthrows
 Stretchd at his length he spurns the swarthy ground
 The lance besmeard with blood lies broken in the wound
 Then with disdain the haughty victor viewd
 Orodes flying nor the wretch pursued
 Nor thought the dastards back deservd a wound
 But running gaind th advantage of the ground
 Then turning short he met him face to face
 To give his victor the better grace
 Orodes falls in equal fight oppressd
 Mezentius fixd his foot upon his breast
 And rested lance and thus aloud he cries
 Lo here the champion of my rebels lies
 The fields around with Io Paean ring
 And peals of shouts applaud the conquring king
 At this the vanquishd with his dying breath
 Thus faintly spoke and prophesied in death
 Nor thou proud man unpunishd shalt remain
 Like death attends thee on this fatal plain
 Then sourly smiling thus the king replied
 For what belongs to me let Jove provide
 But die thou first whatever chance ensue
 He said and from the wound the weapon drew
 A hovring mist came swimming oer his sight
 And seald his eyes in everlasting night

 By Caedicus Alcathous was slain
 Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain
 Orses the strong to greater strength must yield
 He with Parthenius were by Rapo killd
 Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew
 Who from Lycaons blood his lineage drew
 But from his headstrong horse his fate he found
 Who threw his master as he made a bound
 The chief alighting stuck him to the ground
 Then Clonius hand to hand on foot assails
 The Trojan sinks and Neptunes son prevails
 Agis the Lycian stepping forth with pride
 To single fight the boldest foe defied
 Whom Tuscan Valerus by force oercame
 And not belied his mighty fathers fame
 Salius to death the great Antronius sent
 But the same fate the victor underwent
 Slain by Nealces hand wellskilld to throw
 The flying dart and draw the fardeceiving bow

 Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance
 By turns they quit their ground by turns advance
 Victors and vanquishd in the various field
 Nor wholly overcome nor wholly yield
 The gods from heavn survey the fatal strife
 And mourn the miseries of human life
 Above the rest two goddesses appear
 Concernd for each here Venus Juno there
 Amidst the crowd infernal Ate shakes
 Her scourge aloft and crest of hissing snakes

 Once more the proud Mezentius with disdain
 Brandishd his spear and rushd into the plain
 Where towring in the midmost rank she stood
 Like tall Orion stalking oer the flood
 When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves
 His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves
 Or like a mountain ash whose roots are spread
 Deep fixd in earth in clouds he hides his head

 The Trojan prince beheld him from afar
 And dauntless undertook the doubtful war
 Collected in his strength and like a rock
 Poisd on his base Mezentius stood the shock
 He stood and measuring first with careful eyes
 The space his spear could reach aloud he cries
 My strong right hand and sword assist my stroke
 Those only gods Mezentius will invoke
 His armor from the Trojan pirate torn
 By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn
 He said and with his utmost force he threw
 The massy spear which hissing as it flew
 Reachd the celestial shield that stoppd the course
 But glancing thence the yet unbroken force
 Took a new bent obliquely and betwixt
 The side and bowels famd Anthores fixd
 Anthores had from Argos traveld far
 Alcides friend and brother of the war
 Till tird with toils fair Italy he chose
 And in Evanders palace sought repose
 Now falling by anothers wound his eyes
 He cast to heavn on Argos thinks and dies

 The pious Trojan then his javlin sent
 The shield gave way thro treble plates it went
 Of solid brass of linen trebly rolld
 And three bull hides which round the buckler fold
 All these it passd resistless in the course
 Transpiercd his thigh and spent its dying force
 The gaping wound gushd out a crimson flood
 The Trojan glad with sight of hostile blood
 His faunchion drew to closer fight addressd
 And with new force his fainting foe oppressd

 His fathers peril Lausus viewd with grief
 He sighd he wept he ran to his relief
 And here heroic youth t is here I must
 To thy immortal memory be just
 And sing an act so noble and so new
 Posterity will scarce believe t is true
 Paind with his wound and useless for the fight
 The father sought to save himself by flight
 Incumberd slow he draggd the spear along
 Which piercd his thigh and in his buckler hung
 The pious youth resolvd on death below
 The lifted sword springs forth to face the foe
 Protects his parent and prevents the blow
 Shouts of applause ran ringing thro the field
 To see the son the vanquishd father shield
 All fird with genrous indignation strive
 And with a storm of darts to distance drive
 The Trojan chief who held at bay from far
 On his Vulcanian orb sustaind the war

 As when thick hail comes rattling in the wind
 The plowman passenger and labring hind
 For shelter to the neighbring covert fly
 Or housd or safe in hollow caverns lie
 But that oerblown when heavn above em smiles
 Return to travel and renew their toils
 Aeneas thus oerwhelmed on evry side
 The storm of darts undaunted did abide
 And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threatning cried
 Why wilt thou rush to certain death and rage
 In rash attempts beyond thy tender age
 Betrayd by pious love Nor thus forborne
 The youth desists but with insulting scorn
 Provokes the lingring prince whose patience tird
 Gave place and all his breast with fury fird
 For now the Fates prepard their sharpend shears
 And lifted high the flaming sword appears
 Which full descending with a frightful sway
 Thro shield and corslet forcd th impetuous way
 And buried deep in his fair bosom lay
 The purple streams thro the thin armor strove
 And drenchd th imbroiderd coat his mother wove
 And life at length forsook his heaving heart
 Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart

 But when with blood and paleness all oerspread
 The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead
 He grievd he wept the sight an image brought
 Of his own filial love a sadly pleasing thought
 Then stretchd his hand to hold him up and said
 Poor hapless youth what praises can be paid
 To love so great to such transcendent store
 Of early worth and sure presage of more
 Accept whateer Aeneas can afford
 Untouchd thy arms untaken be thy sword
 And all that pleasd thee living still remain
 Inviolate and sacred to the slain
 Thy body on thy parents I bestow
 To rest thy soul at least if shadows know
 Or have a sense of human things below
 There to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell
 T was by the great Aeneas hand I fell
 With this his distant friends he beckons near
 Provokes their duty and prevents their fear
 Himself assists to lift him from the ground
 With clotted locks and blood that welld from out the wound

 Meantime his father now no father stood
 And washd his wounds by Tibers yellow flood
 Oppressd with anguish panting and oerspent
 His fainting limbs against an oak he leant
 A bough his brazen helmet did sustain
 His heavier arms lay scatterd on the plain
 A chosen train of youth around him stand
 His drooping head was rested on his hand
 His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought
 And all on Lausus ran his restless thought
 Careful concernd his danger to prevent
 He much enquird and many a message sent
 To warn him from the field alas in vain
 Behold his mournful followers bear him slain
 Oer his broad shield still gushd the yawning wound
 And drew a bloody trail along the ground
 Far off he heard their cries far off divind
 The dire event with a foreboding mind
 With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head
 Then both his lifted hands to heavn he spread
 Last the dear corpse embracing thus he said
 What joys alas could this frail being give
 That I have been so covetous to live
 To see my son and such a son resign
 His life a ransom for preserving mine
 And am I then preservd and art thou lost
 How much too dear has that redemption cost
 T is now my bitter banishment I feel
 This is a wound too deep for time to heal
 My guilt thy growing virtues did defame
 My blackness blotted thy unblemishd name
 Chasd from a throne abandond and exild
 For foul misdeeds were punishments too mild
 I owd my people these and from their hate
 With less resentment could have borne my fate
 And yet I live and yet sustain the sight
 Of hated men and of more hated light
 But will not long With that he raisd from ground
 His fainting limbs that staggerd with his wound
 Yet with a mind resolvd and unappalld
 With pains or perils for his courser calld
 Wellmouthd wellmanagd whom himself did dress
 With daily care and mounted with success
 His aid in arms his ornament in peace

 Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke
 The steed seemd sensible while thus he spoke
 O Rhoebus we have livd too long for me
 If life and long were terms that could agree
 This day thou either shalt bring back the head
 And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead
 This day thou either shalt revenge my woe
 For murtherd Lausus on his cruel foe
 Or if inexorable fate deny
 Our conquest with thy conquerd master die
 For after such a lord I rest secure
 Thou wilt no foreign reins or Trojan load endure
 He said and straight th officious courser kneels
 To take his wonted weight His hands he fills
 With pointed javlins on his head he lacd
 His glittring helm which terribly was gracd
 With waving horsehair nodding from afar
 Then spurrd his thundring steed amidst the war
 Love anguish wrath and grief to madness wrought
 Despair and secret shame and conscious thought
 Of inborn worth his labring soul oppressd
 Rolld in his eyes and ragd within his breast
 Then loud he calld Aeneas thrice by name
 The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came
 Great Jove he said and the farshooting god
 Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good
 He spoke no more but hastend void of fear
 And threatend with his long protended spear

 To whom Mezentius thus Thy vaunts are vain
 My Lausus lies extended on the plain
 Hes lost thy conquest is already won
 The wretched sire is murtherd in the son
 Nor fate I fear but all the gods defy
 Forbear thy threats my busness is to die
 But first receive this parting legacy
 He said and straight a whirling dart he sent
 Another after and another went
 Round in a spacious ring he rides the field
 And vainly plies th impenetrable shield
 Thrice rode he round and thrice Aeneas wheeld
 Turnd as he turnd the golden orb withstood
 The strokes and bore about an iron wood
 Impatient of delay and weary grown
 Still to defend and to defend alone
 To wrench the darts which in his buckler light
 Urgd and oerlabord in unequal fight
 At length resolvd he throws with all his force
 Full at the temples of the warrior horse
 Just where the stroke was aimd th unerring spear
 Made way and stood transfixd thro either ear
 Seizd with unwonted pain surprisd with fright
 The wounded steed curvets and raisd upright
 Lights on his feet before his hoofs behind
 Spring up in air aloft and lash the wind
 Down comes the rider headlong from his height
 His horse came after with unwieldy weight
 And floundring forward pitching on his head
 His lords incumberd shoulder overlaid

 From either host the mingled shouts and cries
 Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies
 Aeneas hastning wavd his fatal sword
 High oer his head with this reproachful word
 Now where are now thy vaunts the fierce disdain
 Of proud Mezentius and the lofty strain

 Struggling and wildly staring on the skies
 With scarce recoverd sight he thus replies
 Why these insulting words this waste of breath
 To souls undaunted and secure of death
 T is no dishonor for the brave to die
 Nor came I here with hope victory
 Nor ask I life nor fought with that design
 As I had usd my fortune use thou thine
 My dying son contracted no such band
 The gift is hateful from his murdrers hand
 For this this only favor let me sue
 If pity can to conquerd foes be due
 Refuse it not but let my body have
 The last retreat of humankind a grave
 Too well I know th insulting peoples hate
 Protect me from their vengeance after fate
 This refuge for my poor remains provide
 And lay my muchlovd Lausus by my side
 He said and to the sword his throat applied
 The crimson stream distaind his arms around
 And the disdainful soul came rushing thro the wound




 BOOK XI

 Scarce had the rosy Morning raisd her head
 Above the waves and left her watry bed
 The pious chief whom double cares attend
 For his unburied soldiers and his friend
 Yet first to Heavn performd a victors vows
 He bard an ancient oak of all her boughs
 Then on a rising ground the trunk he placd
 Which with the spoils of his dead foe he gracd
 The coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn
 Now on a naked snag in triumph borne
 Was hung on high and glitterd from afar
 A trophy sacred to the God of War
 Above his arms fixd on the leafless wood
 Appeard his plumy crest besmeard with blood
 His brazen buckler on the left was seen
 Truncheons of shiverd lances hung between
 And on the right was placed his corslet bord
 And to the neck was tied his unavailing sword

 A crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man
 Who thus conspicuous in the midst began
 Our toils my friends are crownd with sure success
 The greater part performd achieve the less
 Now follow cheerful to the trembling town
 Press but an entrance and presume it won
 Fear is no more for fierce Mezentius lies
 As the first fruits of war a sacrifice
 Turnus shall fall extended on the plain
 And in this omen is already slain
 Prepard in arms pursue your happy chance
 That none unwarnd may plead his ignorance
 And I at Heavns appointed hour may find
 Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind
 Meantime the rites and funral pomps prepare
 Due to your dead companions of the war
 The last respect the living can bestow
 To shield their shadows from contempt below
 That conquerd earth be theirs for which they fought
 And which for us with their own blood they bought
 But first the corpse of our unhappy friend
 To the sad city of Evander send
 Who not inglorious in his ages bloom
 Was hurried hence by too severe a doom

 Thus weeping while he spoke he took his way
 Where new in death lamented Pallas lay
 Acoetes watchd the corpse whose youth deservd
 The fathers trust and now the son he servd
 With equal faith but less auspicious care
 Th attendants of the slain his sorrow share
 A troop of Trojans mixd with these appear
 And mourning matrons with disheveld hair
 Soon as the prince appears they raise a cry
 All beat their breasts and echoes rend the sky
 They rear his drooping forehead from the ground
 But when Aeneas viewd the grisly wound
 Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore
 And the fair flesh distaind with purple gore
 First melting into tears the pious man
 Deplord so sad a sight then thus began
 Unhappy youth when Fortune gave the rest
 Of my full wishes she refusd the best
 She came but brought not thee along to bless
 My longing eyes and share in my success
 She grudgd thy safe return the triumphs due
 To prosprous valor in the public view
 Not thus I promisd when thy father lent
 Thy needless succor with a sad consent
 Embracd me parting for th Etrurian land
 And sent me to possess a large command
 He warnd and from his own experience told
 Our foes were warlike disciplind and bold
 And now perhaps in hopes of thy return
 Rich odors on his loaded altars burn
 While we with vain officious pomp prepare
 To send him back his portion of the war
 A bloody breathless body which can owe
 No farther debt but to the powrs below
 The wretched father ere his race is run
 Shall view the funral honors of his son
 These are my triumphs of the Latian war
 Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care
 And yet unhappy sire thou shalt not see
 A son whose death disgracd his ancestry
 Thou shalt not blush old man however grievd
 Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receivd
 He died no death to make thee wish too late
 Thou hadst not livd to see his shameful fate
 But what a champion has th Ausonian coast
 And what a friend hast thou Ascanius lost

 Thus having mournd he gave the word around
 To raise the breathless body from the ground
 And chose a thousand horse the flowr of all
 His warlike troops to wait the funeral
 To bear him back and share Evanders grief
 A wellbecoming but a weak relief
 Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier
 Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear
 The body on this rural hearse is borne
 Strewd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn
 All pale he lies and looks a lovely flowr
 New croppd by virgin hands to dress the bowr
 Unfaded yet but yet unfed below
 No more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe
 Then two fair vests of wondrous work and cost
 Of purple woven and with gold embossd
 For ornament the Trojan hero brought
 Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought
 One vest arrayd the corpse and one they spread
 Oer his closd eyes and wrappd around his head
 That when the yellow hair in flame should fall
 The catching fire might burn the golden caul
 Besides the spoils of foes in battle slain
 When he descended on the Latian plain
 Arms trappings horses by the hearse are led
 In long array th achievements of the dead
 Then piniond with their hands behind appear
 Th unhappy captives marching in the rear
 Appointed offrings in the victors name
 To sprinkle with their blood the funral flame
 Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne
 Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn
 And fair inscriptions fixd and titles read
 Of Latian leaders conquerd by the dead

 Acoetes on his pupils corpse attends
 With feeble steps supported by his friends
 Pausing at evry pace in sorrow drownd
 Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground
 Where grovling while he lies in deep despair
 He beats his breast and rends his hoary hair
 The champions chariot next is seen to roll
 Besmeard with hostile blood and honorably foul
 To close the pomp Aethon the steed of state
 Is led the funrals of his lord to wait
 Strippd of his trappings with a sullen pace
 He walks and the big tears run rolling down his face
 The lance of Pallas and the crimson crest
 Are borne behind the victor seizd the rest
 The march begins the trumpets hoarsely sound
 The pikes and lances trail along the ground
 Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse
 To Pallantean towrs direct their course
 In long procession rankd the pious chief
 Stoppd in the rear and gave a vent to grief
 The public care he said which war attends
 Diverts our present woes at least suspends
 Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell
 Hail holy relics and a last farewell
 He said no more but inly thro he mournd
 Restrained his tears and to the camp returnd

 Now suppliants from Laurentum sent demand
 A truce with olive branches in their hand
 Obtest his clemency and from the plain
 Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain
 They plead that none those common rites deny
 To conquerd foes that in fair battle die
 All cause of hate was ended in their death
 Nor could he war with bodies void of breath
 A king they hopd would hear a kings request
 Whose son he once was calld and once his guest

 Their suit which was too just to be denied
 The hero grants and farther thus replied
 O Latian princes how severe a fate
 In causeless quarrels has involvd your state
 And armd against an unoffending man
 Who sought your friendship ere the war began
 You beg a truce which I would gladly give
 Not only for the slain but those who live
 I came not hither but by Heavns command
 And sent by fate to share the Latian land
 Nor wage I wars unjust your king denied
 My profferd friendship and my promisd bride
 Left me for Turnus Turnus then should try
 His cause in arms to conquer or to die
 My right and his are in dispute the slain
 Fell without fault our quarrel to maintain
 In equal arms let us alone contend
 And let him vanquish whom his fates befriend
 This is the way so tell him to possess
 The royal virgin and restore the peace
 Bear this message back with ample leave
 That your slain friends may funral rites receive

 Thus having said th embassadors amazd
 Stood mute a while and on each other gazd
 Drances their chief who harbord in his breast
 Long hate to Turnus as his foe professd
 Broke silence first and to the godlike man
 With graceful action bowing thus began
 Auspicious prince in arms a mighty name
 But yet whose actions far transcend your fame
 Would I your justice or your force express
 Thought can but equal and all words are less
 Your answer we shall thankfully relate
 And favors granted to the Latian state
 If wishd success our labor shall attend
 Think peace concluded and the king your friend
 Let Turnus leave the realm to your command
 And seek alliance in some other land
 Build you the city which your fates assign
 We shall be proud in the great work to join

 Thus Drances and his words so well persuade
 The rest impowerd that soon a truce is made
 Twelve days the term allowd and during those
 Latians and Trojans now no longer foes
 Mixd in the woods for funral piles prepare
 To fell the timber and forget the war
 Loud axes thro the groaning groves resound
 Oak mountain ash and poplar spread the ground
 First fall from high and some the trunks receive
 In loaden wains with wedges some they cleave

 And now the fatal news by Fame is blown
 Thro the short circuit of th Arcadian town
 Of Pallas slain by Fame which just before
 His triumphs on distended pinions bore
 Rushing from out the gate the people stand
 Each with a funral flambeau in his hand
 Wildly they stare distracted with amaze
 The fields are lightend with a fiery blaze
 That cast a sullen splendor on their friends
 The marching troop which their dead prince attends
 Both parties meet they raise a doleful cry
 The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply
 And their mixd mourning rends the vaulted sky
 The town is filld with tumult and with tears
 Till the loud clamors reach Evanders ears
 Forgetful of his state he runs along
 With a disorderd pace and cleaves the throng
 Falls on the corpse and groaning there he lies
 With silent grief that speaks but at his eyes
 Short sighs and sobs succeed till sorrow breaks
 A passage and at once he weeps and speaks

 O Pallas thou hast faild thy plighted word
 To fight with caution not to tempt the sword
 I warnd thee but in vain for well I knew
 What perils youthful ardor would pursue
 That boiling blood would carry thee too far
 Young as thou wert in dangers raw to war
 O curst essay of arms disastrous doom
 Prelude of bloody fields and fights to come
 Hard elements of unauspicious war
 Vain vows to Heavn and unavailing care
 Thrice happy thou dear partner of my bed
 Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled
 Praescious of ills and leaving me behind
 To drink the dregs of life by fate assignd
 Beyond the goal of nature I have gone
 My Pallas late set out but reachd too soon
 If for my league against th Ausonian state
 Amidst their weapons I had found my fate
 Deservd from them then I had been returnd
 A breathless victor and my son had mournd
 Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid
 Nor grudge th alliance I so gladly made
 T was not his fault my Pallas fell so young
 But my own crime for having livd too long
 Yet since the gods had destind him to die
 At least he led the way to victory
 First for his friends he won the fatal shore
 And sent whole herds of slaughterd foes before
 A death too great too glorious to deplore
 Nor will I add new honors to thy grave
 Content with those the Trojan hero gave
 That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends designd
 In which the Tuscan chiefs and army joind
 Great spoils and trophies gaind by thee they bear
 Then let thy own achievements be thy share
 Even thou O Turnus hadst a trophy stood
 Whose mighty trunk had better gracd the wood
 If Pallas had arrivd with equal length
 Of years to match thy bulk with equal strength
 But why unhappy man dost thou detain
 These troops to view the tears thou sheddst in vain
 Go friends this message to your lord relate
 Tell him that if I bear my bitter fate
 And after Pallas death live lingring on
 T is to behold his vengeance for my son
 I stay for Turnus whose devoted head
 Is owing to the living and the dead
 My son and I expect it from his hand
 T is all that he can give or we demand
 Joy is no more but I would gladly go
 To greet my Pallas with such news below

 The morn had now dispelld the shades of night
 Restoring toils when she restord the light
 The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command
 To raise the piles along the winding strand
 Their friends convey the dead funral fires
 Black smoldring smoke from the green wood expires
 The light of heavn is chokd and the new day retires
 Then thrice around the kindled piles they go
 For ancient custom had ordaind it so
 Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led
 And thrice with loud laments they hail the dead
 Tears trickling down their breasts bedew the ground
 And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound
 Amid the blaze their pious brethren throw
 The spoils in battle taken from the foe
 Helms bits embossd and swords of shining steel
 One casts a target one a chariot wheel
 Some to their fellows their own arms restore
 The fauchions which in luckless fight they bore
 Their bucklers piercd their darts bestowd in vain
 And shiverd lances gatherd from the plain
 Whole herds of offerd bulls about the fire
 And bristled boars and woolly sheep expire
 Around the piles a careful troop attends
 To watch the wasting flames and weep their burning friends
 Lingring along the shore till dewy night
 New decks the face of heavn with starry light

 The conquerd Latians with like pious care
 Piles without number for their dead prepare
 Part in the places where they fell are laid
 And part are to the neighbring fields conveyd
 The corps of kings and captains of renown
 Borne off in state are buried in the town
 The rest unhonord and without a name
 Are cast a common heap to feed the flame
 Trojans and Latians vie with like desires
 To make the field of battle shine with fires
 And the promiscuous blaze to heavn aspires

 Now had the morning thrice renewd the light
 And thrice dispelld the shadows of the night
 When those who round the wasted fires remain
 Perform the last sad office to the slain
 They rake the yet warm ashes from below
 These and the bones unburnd in earth bestow
 These relics with their country rites they grace
 And raise a mount of turf to mark the place

 But in the palace of the king appears
 A scene more solemn and a pomp of tears
 Maids matrons widows mix their common moans
 Orphans their sires and sires lament their sons
 All in that universal sorrow share
 And curse the cause of this unhappy war
 A broken league a bride unjustly sought
 A crown usurpd which with their blood is bought
 These are the crimes with which they load the name
 Of Turnus and on him alone exclaim
 Let him who lords it oer th Ausonian land
 Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand
 His is the gain our lot is but to serve
 T is just the sway he seeks he should deserve
 This Drances aggravates and adds with spite
 His foe expects and dares him to the fight
 Nor Turnus wants a party to support
 His cause and credit in the Latian court
 His former acts secure his present fame
 And the queen shades him with her mighty name

 While thus their factious minds with fury burn
 The legates from th Aetolian prince return
 Sad news they bring that after all the cost
 And care employd their embassy is lost
 That Diomedes refusd his aid in war
 Unmovd with presents and as deaf to prayr
 Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought
 Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought

 Latinus sunk in sorrow finds too late
 A foreign son is pointed out by fate
 And till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed
 The wrath of Heavn is hovring oer his head
 The gods he saw espousd the juster side
 When late their titles in the field were tried
 Witness the fresh laments and funral tears undried
 Thus full of anxious thought he summons all
 The Latian senate to the council hall
 The princes come commanded by their head
 And crowd the paths that to the palace lead
 Supreme in powr and reverencd for his years
 He takes the throne and in the midst appears
 Majestically sad he sits in state
 And bids his envoys their success relate

 When Venulus began the murmuring sound
 Was hushd and sacred silence reignd around
 We have said he performd your high command
 And passd with peril a long tract of land
 We reachd the place desird with wonder filld
 The Grecian tents and rising towrs beheld
 Great Diomede has compassd round with walls
 The city which Argyripa he calls
 From his own Argos namd We touchd with joy
 The royal hand that razd unhappy Troy
 When introducd our presents first we bring
 Then crave an instant audience from the king
 His leave obtaind our native soil we name
 And tell th important cause for which we came
 Attentively he heard us while we spoke
 Then with soft accents and a pleasing look
 Made this return Ausonian race of old
 Renownd for peace and for an age of gold
 What madness has your alterd minds possessd
 To change for war hereditary rest
 Solicit arms unknown and tempt the sword
 A needless ill your ancestors abhorrd
 We for myself I speak and all the name
 Of Grecians who to Troys destruction came
 Omitting those who were in battle slain
 Or borne by rolling Simois to the main
 Not one but sufferd and too dearly bought
 The prize of honor which in arms he sought
 Some doomd to death and some in exile drivn
 Outcasts abandond by the care of Heavn
 So worn so wretched so despisd a crew
 As evn old Priam might with pity view
 Witness the vessels by Minerva tossd
 In storms the vengeful Capharean coast
 Th Euboean rocks the prince whose brother led
 Our armies to revenge his injurd bed
 In Egypt lost Ulysses with his men
 Have seen Charybdis and the Cyclops den
 Why should I name Idomeneus in vain
 Restord to scepters and expelld again
 Or young Achilles by his rival slain
 Evn he the King of Men the foremost name
 Of all the Greeks and most renownd by fame
 The proud revenger of anothers wife
 Yet by his own adultress lost his life
 Fell at his threshold and the spoils of Troy
 The foul polluters of his bed enjoy
 The gods have envied me the sweets of life
 My much lovd country and my more lovd wife
 Banishd from both I mourn while in the sky
 Transformd to birds my lost companions fly
 Hovring about the coasts they make their moan
 And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own
 What squalid specters in the dead of night
 Break my short sleep and skim before my sight
 I might have promisd to myself those harms
 Mad as I was when I with mortal arms
 Presumd against immortal powrs to move
 And violate with wounds the Queen of Love
 Such arms this hand shall never more employ
 No hate remains with me to ruind Troy
 I war not with its dust nor am I glad
 To think of past events or good or bad
 Your presents I return whateer you bring
 To buy my friendship send the Trojan king
 We met in fight I know him to my cost
 With what a whirling force his lance he tossd
 Heavns what a spring was in his arm to throw
 How high he held his shield and rose at evry blow
 Had Troy producd two more his match in might
 They would have changd the fortune of the fight
 Th invasion of the Greeks had been returnd
 Our empire wasted and our cities burnd
 The long defense the Trojan people made
 The war protracted and the siege delayd
 Were due to Hectors and this heros hand
 Both brave alike and equal in command
 Aeneas not inferior in the field
 In pious reverence to the gods excelld
 Make peace ye Latians and avoid with care
 Th impending dangers of a fatal war
 He said no more but with this cold excuse
 Refusd th alliance and advisd a truce

 Thus Venulus concluded his report
 A jarring murmur filld the factious court
 As when a torrent rolls with rapid force
 And dashes oer the stones that stop the course
 The flood constraind within a scanty space
 Roars horrible along th uneasy race
 White foam in gathring eddies floats around
 The rocky shores rebellow to the sound

 The murmur ceasd then from his lofty throne
 The king invokd the gods and thus begun
 I wish ye Latins what we now debate
 Had been resolvd before it was too late
 Much better had it been for you and me
 Unforcd by this our last necessity
 To have been earlier wise than now to call
 A council when the foe surrounds the wall
 O citizens we wage unequal war
 With men not only Heavns peculiar care
 But Heavns own race unconquerd in the field
 Or conquerd yet unknowing how to yield
 What hopes you had in Diomedes lay down
 Our hopes must center on ourselves alone
 Yet those how feeble and indeed how vain
 You see too well nor need my words explain
 Vanquishd without resource laid flat by fate
 Factions within a foe without the gate
 Not but I grant that all performd their parts
 With manly force and with undaunted hearts
 With our united strength the war we wagd
 With equal numbers equal arms engagd
 You see th event Now hear what I propose
 To save our friends and satisfy our foes
 A tract of land the Latins have possessd
 Along the Tiber stretching to the west
 Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till
 And their mixd cattle graze the fruitful hill
 Those mountains filld with firs that lower land
 If you consent the Trojan shall command
 Calld into part of what is ours and there
 On terms agreed the common country share
 There letem build and settle if they please
 Unless they choose once more to cross the seas
 In search of seats remote from Italy
 And from unwelcome inmates set us free
 Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed
 Or twice as many more if more they need
 Materials are at hand a wellgrown wood
 Runs equal with the margin of the flood
 Let them the number and the form assign
 The care and cost of all the stores be mine
 To treat the peace a hundred senators
 Shall be commissiond hence with ample powrs
 With olive the presents they shall bear
 A purple robe a royal ivry chair
 And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear
 And sums of gold Among yourselves debate
 This great affair and save the sinking state

 Then Drances took the word who grudgd long since
 The rising glories of the Daunian prince
 Factious and rich bold at the council board
 But cautious in the field he shunnd the sword
 A close caballer and tonguevaliant lord
 Noble his mother was and near the throne
 But what his fathers parentage unknown
 He rose and took th advantage of the times
 To load young Turnus with invidious crimes
 Such truths O king said he your words contain
 As strike the sense and all replies are vain
 Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek
 What common needs require but fear to speak
 Let him give leave of speech that haughty man
 Whose pride this unauspicious war began
 For whose ambition let me dare to say
 Fear set apart tho death is in my way
 The plains of Latium run with blood around
 So many valiant heroes bite the ground
 Dejected grief in evry face appears
 A town in mourning and a land in tears
 While he th undoubted author of our harms
 The man who menaces the gods with arms
 Yet after all his boasts forsook the fight
 And sought his safety in ignoble flight
 Now best of kings since you propose to send
 Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend
 Add yet a greater at our joint request
 One which he values more than all the rest
 Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride
 With that alliance let the league be tied
 And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide
 Let insolence no longer awe the throne
 But with a fathers right bestow your own
 For this maligner of the general good
 If still we fear his force he must be wood
 His haughty godhead we with prayrs implore
 Your scepter to release and our just rights restore
 O cursed cause of all our ills must we
 Wage wars unjust and fall in fight for thee
 What right hast thou to rule the Latian state
 And send us out to meet our certain fate
 T is a destructive war from Turnus hand
 Our peace and public safety we demand
 Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain
 If not the peace without the pledge is vain
 Turnus I know you think me not your friend
 Nor will I much with your belief contend
 I beg your greatness not to give the law
 In others realms but beaten to withdraw
 Pity your own or pity our estate
 Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate
 Your interest is the war should never cease
 But we have felt enough to wish the peace
 A land exhausted to the last remains
 Depopulated towns and driven plains
 Yet if desire of fame and thirst of powr
 A beauteous princess with a crown in dowr
 So fire your mind in arms assert your right
 And meet your foe who dares you to the fight
 Mankind it seems is made for you alone
 We but the slaves who mount you to the throne
 A base ignoble crowd without a name
 Unwept unworthy of the funral flame
 By duty bound to forfeit each his life
 That Turnus may possess a royal wife
 Permit not mighty man so mean a crew
 Should share such triumphs and detain from you
 The post of honor your undoubted due
 Rather alone your matchless force employ
 To merit what alone you must enjoy

 These words so full of malice mixd with art
 Inflamd with rage the youthful heros heart
 Then groaning from the bottom of his breast
 He heavd for wind and thus his wrath expressd
 You Drances never want a stream of words
 Then when the public need requires our swords
 First in the council hall to steer the state
 And ever foremost in a tonguedebate
 While our strong walls secure us from the foe
 Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow
 But let the potent orator declaim
 And with the brand of coward blot my name
 Free leave is givn him when his fatal hand
 Has coverd with more corps the sanguine strand
 And high as mine his towring trophies stand
 If any doubt remains who dares the most
 Let us decide it at the Trojans cost
 And issue both abreast where honor calls
 Foes are not far to seek without the walls
 Unless his noisy tongue can only fight
 And feet were givn him but to speed his flight
 I beaten from the field I forcd away
 Who but so known a dastard dares to say
 Had he but evn beheld the fight his eyes
 Had witnessd for me what his tongue denies
 What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain
 And how the bloody Tiber swelld the main
 All saw but he th Arcadian troops retire
 In scatterd squadrons and their prince expire
 The giant brothers in their camp have found
 I was not forcd with ease to quit my ground
 Not such the Trojans tried me when inclosd
 I singly their united arms opposd
 First forcd an entrance thro their thick array
 Then glutted with their slaughter freed my way
 T is a destructive war So let it be
 But to the Phrygian pirate and to thee
 Meantime proceed to fill the peoples ears
 With false reports their minds with panic fears
 Extol the strength of a twiceconquerd race
 Our foes encourage and our friends debase
 Believe thy fables and the Trojan town
 Triumphant stands the Grecians are oerthrown
 Suppliant at Hectors feet Achilles lies
 And Diomede from fierce Aeneas flies
 Say rapid Aufidus with awful dread
 Runs backward from the sea and hides his head
 When the great Trojan on his bank appears
 For thats as true as thy dissembled fears
 Of my revenge Dismiss that vanity
 Thou Drances art below a death from me
 Let that vile soul in that vile body rest
 The lodging is well worthy of the guest

 Now royal father to the present state
 Of our affairs and of this high debate
 If in your arms thus early you diffide
 And think your fortune is already tried
 If one defeat has brought us down so low
 As never more in fields to meet the foe
 Then I conclude for peace t is time to treat
 And lie like vassals at the victors feet
 But O if any ancient blood remains
 One drop of all our fathers in our veins
 That man would I prefer before the rest
 Who dard his death with an undaunted breast
 Who comely fell by no dishonest wound
 To shun that sight and dying gnawd the ground
 But if we still have fresh recruits in store
 If our confederates can afford us more
 If the contended field we bravely fought
 And not a bloodless victory was bought
 Their losses equald ours and for their slain
 With equal fires they filld the shining plain
 Why thus unforcd should we so tamely yield
 And ere the trumpet sounds resign the field
 Good unexpected evils unforeseen
 Appear by turns as fortune shifts the scene
 Some raisd aloft come tumbling down amain
 Then fall so hard they bound and rise again
 If Diomede refuse his aid to lend
 The great Messapus yet remains our friend
 Tolumnius who foretells events is ours
 Th Italian chiefs and princes join their powrs
 Nor least in number nor in name the last
 Your own brave subjects have your cause embracd
 Above the rest the Volscian Amazon
 Contains an army in herself alone
 And heads a squadron terrible to sight
 With glittring shields in brazen armor bright
 Yet if the foe a single fight demand
 And I alone the public peace withstand
 If you consent he shall not be refusd
 Nor find a hand to victory unusd
 This new Achilles let him take the field
 With fated armor and Vulcanian shield
 For you my royal father and my fame
 I Turnus not the least of all my name
 Devote my soul He calls me hand to hand
 And I alone will answer his demand
 Drances shall rest secure and neither share
 The danger nor divide the prize of war

 While they debate nor these nor those will yield
 Aeneas draws his forces to the field
 And moves his camp The scouts with flying speed
 Return and thro the frighted city spread
 Th unpleasing news the Trojans are descried
 In battle marching by the river side
 And bending to the town They take th alarm
 Some tremble some are bold all in confusion arm
 Th impetuous youth press forward to the field
 They clash the sword and clatter on the shield
 The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry
 Old feeble men with fainter groans reply
 A jarring sound results and mingles in the sky
 Like that of swans remurmring to the floods
 Or birds of diffring kinds in hollow woods

 Turnus th occasion takes and cries aloud
 Talk on ye quaint haranguers of the crowd
 Declaim in praise of peace when danger calls
 And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls
 He said and turning short with speedy pace
 Casts back a scornful glance and quits the place
 Thou Volusus the Volscian troops command
 To mount and lead thyself our Ardean band
 Messapus and Catillus post your force
 Along the fields to charge the Trojan horse
 Some guard the passes others man the wall
 Drawn up in arms the rest attend my call

 They swarm from evry quarter of the town
 And with disorderd haste the rampires crown
 Good old Latinus when he saw too late
 The gathring storm just breaking on the state
 Dismissd the council till a fitter time
 And ownd his easy temper as his crime
 Who forcd against his reason had complied
 To break the treaty for the promisd bride

 Some help to sink new trenches others aid
 To ram the stones or raise the palisade
 Hoarse trumpets sound th alarm around the walls
 Runs a distracted crew whom their last labor calls
 A sad procession in the streets is seen
 Of matrons that attend the mother queen
 High in her chair she sits and at her side
 With downcast eyes appears the fatal bride
 They mount the cliff where Pallas temple stands
 Prayrs in their mouths and presents in their hands
 With censers first they fume the sacred shrine
 Then in this common supplication join
 O patroness of arms unspotted maid
 Propitious hear and lend thy Latins aid
 Break short the pirates lance pronounce his fate
 And lay the Phrygian low before the gate

 Now Turnus arms for fight His back and breast
 Welltemperd steel and scaly brass invest
 The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold
 Are mingled metal damaskd oer with gold
 His faithful fauchion sits upon his side
 Nor casque nor crest his manly features hide
 But bare to view amid surrounding friends
 With godlike grace he from the towr descends
 Exulting in his strength he seems to dare
 His absent rival and to promise war
 Freed from his keepers thus with broken reins
 The wanton courser prances oer the plains
 Or in the pride of youth oerleaps the mounds
 And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds
 Or seeks his watring in the wellknown flood
 To quench his thirst and cool his fiery blood
 He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain
 And oer his shoulder flows his waving mane
 He neighs he snorts he bears his head on high
 Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly

 Soon as the prince appears without the gate
 The Volscians with their virgin leader wait
 His last commands Then with a graceful mien
 Lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen
 Her squadron imitates and each descends
 Whose common suit Camilla thus commends
 If sense of honor if a soul secure
 Of inborn worth that can all tests endure
 Can promise aught or on itself rely
 Greatly to dare to conquer or to die
 Then I alone sustaind by these will meet
 The Tyrrhene troops and promise their defeat
 Ours be the danger ours the sole renown
 You genral stay behind and guard the town

 Turnus a while stood mute with glad surprise
 And on the fierce virago fixd his eyes
 Then thus returnd O grace of Italy
 With what becoming thanks can I reply
 Not only words lie labring in my breast
 But thought itself is by thy praise oppressd
 Yet rob me not of all but let me join
 My toils my hazard and my fame with thine
 The Trojan not in stratagem unskilld
 Sends his light horse before to scour the field
 Himself thro steep ascents and thorny brakes
 A larger compass to the city takes
 This news my scouts confirm and I prepare
 To foil his cunning and his force to dare
 With chosen foot his passage to forelay
 And place an ambush in the winding way
 Thou with thy Volscians face the Tuscan horse
 The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce
 With those of Tibur and the Latian band
 Subjected all to thy supreme command
 This said he warns Messapus to the war
 Then evry chief exhorts with equal care
 All thus encouragd his own troops he joins
 And hastes to prosecute his deep designs

 Inclosd with hills a winding valley lies
 By nature formd for fraud and fitted for surprise
 A narrow track by human steps untrode
 Leads thro perplexing thorns to this obscure abode
 High oer the vale a steepy mountain stands
 Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands
 The top is level an offensive seat
 Of war and from the war a safe retreat
 For on the right and left is room to press
 The foes at hand or from afar distress
 To drive em headlong downward and to pour
 On their descending backs a stony showr
 Thither young Turnus took the wellknown way
 Possessd the pass and in blind ambush lay

 Meantime Latonian Phoebe from the skies
 Beheld th approaching war with hateful eyes
 And calld the lightfoot Opis to her aid
 Her most belovd and evertrusty maid
 Then with a sigh began Camilla goes
 To meet her death amidst her fatal foes
 The nymphs I lovd of all my mortal train
 Invested with Dianas arms in vain
 Nor is my kindness for the virgin new
 T was born with her and with her years it grew
 Her father Metabus when forcd away
 From old Privernum for tyrannic sway
 Snatchd up and savd from his prevailing foes
 This tender babe companion of his woes
 Casmilla was her mother but he drownd
 One hissing letter in a softer sound
 And calld Camilla Thro the woods he flies
 Wrappd in his robe the royal infant lies
 His foes in sight he mends his weary pace
 With shout and clamors they pursue the chase
 The banks of Amasene at length he gains

 The raging flood his farther flight restrains
 Raisd oer the borders with unusual rains
 Prepard to plunge into the stream he fears
 Not for himself but for the charge he bears
 Anxious he stops a while and thinks in haste
 Then desprate in distress resolves at last
 A knotty lance of wellboild oak he bore
 The middle part with cork he coverd oer
 He closd the child within the hollow space
 With twigs of bending osier bound the case
 Then poisd the spear heavy with human weight
 And thus invokd my favor for the freight
 Accept great goddess of the woods he said
 Sent by her sire this dedicated maid
 Thro air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine
 And the first weapons that she knows are thine
 He said and with full force the spear he threw
 Above the sounding waves Camilla flew
 Then pressd by foes he stemmd the stormy tide
 And gaind by stress of arms the farther side
 His fastend spear he pulld from out the ground
 And victor of his vows his infant nymph unbound
 Nor after that in towns which walls inclose
 Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes
 But rough in open air he chose to lie
 Earth was his couch his covring was the sky
 On hills unshorn or in a desart den
 He shunnd the dire society of men
 A shepherds solitary life he led
 His daughter with the milk of mares he fed
 The dugs of bears and evry salvage beast
 He drew and thro her lips the liquor pressd
 The little Amazon could scarcely go
 He loads her with a quiver and a bow
 And that she might her staggring steps command
 He with a slender javlin fills her hand
 Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound
 Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground
 Instead of these a tigers hide oerspread
 Her back and shoulders fastend to her head
 The flying dart she first attempts to fling
 And round her tender temples tossd the sling
 Then as her strength with years increasd began
 To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan
 And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane
 The Tuscan matrons with each other vied
 To bless their rival sons with such a bride
 But she disdains their love to share with me
 The sylvan shades and vowd virginity
 And O I wish contented with my cares
 Of salvage spoils she had not sought the wars
 Then had she been of my celestial train
 And shunnd the fate that dooms her to be slain
 But since opposing Heavns decree she goes
 To find her death among forbidden foes
 Haste with these arms and take thy steepy flight
 Where with the gods averse the Latins fight
 This bow to thee this quiver I bequeath
 This chosen arrow to revenge her death
 By whateer hand Camilla shall be slain
 Or of the Trojan or Italian train
 Let him not pass unpunishd from the plain
 Then in a hollow cloud myself will aid
 To bear the breathless body of my maid
 Unspoild shall be her arms and unprofand
 Her holy limbs with any human hand
 And in a marble tomb laid in her native land

 She said The faithful nymph descends from high
 With rapid flight and cuts the sounding sky
 Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly

 By this the Trojan and the Tuscan horse
 Drawn up in squadrons with united force
 Approach the walls the sprightly coursers bound
 Press forward on their bits and shift their ground
 Shields arms and spears flash horribly from far
 And the fields glitter with a waving war
 Opposd to these come on with furious force
 Messapus Coras and the Latian horse
 These in the body placd on either hand
 Sustaind and closd by fair Camillas band
 Advancing in a line they couch their spears
 And less and less the middle space appears
 Thick smoke obscures the field and scarce are seen
 The neighing coursers and the shouting men
 In distance of their darts they stop their course
 Then man to man they rush and horse to horse
 The face of heavn their flying javlins hide
 And deaths unseen are dealt on either side
 Tyrrhenus and Aconteus void of fear
 By mettled coursers borne in full career
 Meet first opposd and with a mighty shock
 Their horses heads against each other knock
 Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast
 As with an engines force or lightnings blast
 He rolls along in blood and breathes his last
 The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright
 And sling their shields behind to save their backs in flight
 Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew
 Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue
 And urge their flight Asylas leads the chase
 Till seizd with shame they wheel about and face
 Receive their foes and raise a threatning cry
 The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly
 So swelling surges with a thundring roar
 Drivn on each others backs insult the shore
 Bound oer the rocks incroach upon the land
 And far upon the beach eject the sand
 Then backward with a swing they take their way
 Repulsd from upper ground and seek their mother sea
 With equal hurry quit th invaded shore
 And swallow back the sand and stones they spewd before

 Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field
 Twice by the Latins in their turn repelld
 Ashamd at length to the third charge they ran
 Both hosts resolvd and mingled man to man
 Now dying groans are heard the fields are strowd
 With falling bodies and are drunk with blood
 Arms horses men on heaps together lie
 Confusd the fight and more confusd the cry
 Orsilochus who durst not press too near
 Strong Remulus at distance drove his spear
 And stuck the steel beneath his horses ear
 The fiery steed impatient of the wound
 Curvets and springing upward with a bound
 His helpless lord cast backward on the ground
 Catillus piercd Iolas first then drew
 His reeking lance and at Herminius threw
 The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew
 His neck and throat unarmd his head was bare
 But shaded with a length of yellow hair
 Secure he fought exposd on evry part
 A spacious mark for swords and for the flying dart
 Across the shoulders came the featherd wound
 Transfixd he fell and doubled to the ground
 The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed
 And death with honor sought on either side

 Resistless thro the war Camilla rode
 In danger unappalld and pleasd with blood
 One side was bare for her exerted breast
 One shoulder with her painted quiver pressd
 Now from afar her fatal javlins play
 Now with her axs edge she hews her way
 Dianas arms upon her shoulder sound
 And when too closely pressd she quits the ground
 From her bent bow she sends a backward wound
 Her maids in martial pomp on either side
 Larina Tulla fierce Tarpeia ride
 Italians all in peace their queens delight
 In war the bold companions of the fight
 So marchd the Tracian Amazons of old
 When Thermodon with bloody billows rolld
 Such troops as these in shining arms were seen
 When Theseus met in fight their maiden queen
 Such to the field Penthisilea led
 From the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled
 With such returnd triumphant from the war
 Her maids with cries attend the lofty car
 They clash with manly force their moony shields
 With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields

 Who foremost and who last heroic maid
 On the cold earth were by thy courage laid
 Thy spear of mountain ash Eumenius first
 With fury drivn from side to side transpiercd
 A purple stream came spouting from the wound
 Bathd in his blood he lies and bites the ground
 Liris and Pegasus at once she slew
 The former as the slackend reins he drew
 Of his faint steed the latter as he stretchd
 His arm to prop his friend the javlin reachd
 By the same weapon sent from the same hand
 Both fall together and both spurn the sand
 Amastrus next is added to the slain
 The rest in rout she follows oer the plain
 Tereus Harpalycus Demophoon
 And Chromis at full speed her fury shun
 Of all her deadly darts not one she lost
 Each was attended with a Trojan ghost
 Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed
 Swift for the chase and of Apulian breed
 Him from afar she spied in arms unknown
 Oer his broad back an oxs hide was thrown
 His helm a wolf whose gaping jaws were spread
 A covring for his cheeks and grinnd around his head
 He clenchd within his hand an iron prong
 And towerd above the rest conspicuous in the throng
 Him soon she singled from the flying train
 And slew with ease then thus insults the slain
 Vain hunter didst thou think thro woods to chase
 The savage herd a vile and trembling race
 Here cease thy vaunts and own my victory
 A woman warrior was too strong for thee
 Yet if the ghosts demand the conqurors name
 Confessing great Camilla save thy shame
 Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew
 The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew
 But Butes breast to breast the spear descends
 Above the gorget where his helmet ends
 And oer the shield which his left side defends
 Orsilochus and she their courses ply
 He seems to follow and she seems to fly
 But in a narrower ring she makes the race
 And then he flies and she pursues the chase
 Gathring at length on her deluded foe
 She swings her ax and rises to the blow
 Full on the helm behind with such a sway
 The weapon falls the riven steel gives way
 He groans he roars he sues in vain for grace
 Brains mingled with his blood besmear his face

 Astonishd Aunus just arrives by chance
 To see his fall nor farther dares advance
 But fixing on the horrid maid his eye
 He stares and shakes and finds it vain to fly
 Yet like a true Ligurian born to cheat
 At least while fortune favord his deceit
 Cries out aloud What courage have you shown
 Who trust your coursers strength and not your own
 Forego the vantage of your horse alight
 And then on equal terms begin the fight
 It shall be seen weak woman what you can
 When foot to foot you combat with a man
 He said She glows with anger and disdain
 Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain
 And leaves her horse at large among her train
 With her drawn sword defies him to the field
 And marching lifts aloft her maiden shield
 The youth who thought his cunning did succeed
 Reins round his horse and urges all his speed
 Adds the remembrance of the spur and hides
 The goring rowels in his bleeding sides
 Vain fool and coward cries the lofty maid
 Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid
 On others practice thy Ligurian arts
 Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts
 Are lost on me nor shalt thou safe retire
 With vaunting lies to thy fallacious sire
 At this so fast her flying feet she sped
 That soon she straind beyond his horses head
 Then turning short at once she seizd the rein
 And laid the boaster grovling on the plain
 Not with more ease the falcon from above
 Trusses in middle air the trembling dove
 Then plumes the prey in her strong pounces bound
 The feathers foul with blood come tumbling to the ground

 Now mighty Jove from his superior height
 With his broad eye surveys th unequal fight
 He fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain
 And sends him to redeem th abandond plain
 Betwixt the broken ranks the Tuscan rides
 And these encourages and those he chides
 Recalls each leader by his name from flight
 Renews their ardor and restores the fight
 What panic fear has seizd your souls O shame
 O brand perpetual of th Etrurian name
 Cowards incurable a womans hand
 Drives breaks and scatters your ignoble band
 Now cast away the sword and quit the shield
 What use of weapons which you dare not wield
 Not thus you fly your female foes by night
 Nor shun the feast when the full bowls invite
 When to fat offrings the glad augur calls
 And the shrill hornpipe sounds to bacchanals
 These are your studied cares your lewd delight
 Swift to debauch but slow to manly fight
 Thus having said he spurs amid the foes
 Not managing the life he meant to lose
 The first he found he seizd with headlong haste
 In his strong gripe and claspd around the waist
 T was Venulus whom from his horse he tore
 And laid athwart his own in triumph bore
 Loud shouts ensue the Latins turn their eyes
 And view th unusual sight with vast surprise
 The fiery Tarchon flying oer the plains
 Pressd in his arms the pondrous prey sustains
 Then with his shortend spear explores around
 His jointed arms to fix a deadly wound
 Nor less the captive struggles for his life
 He writhes his body to prolong the strife
 And fencing for his naked throat exerts
 His utmost vigor and the point averts
 So stoops the yellow eagle from on high
 And bears a speckled serpent thro the sky
 Fastning his crooked talons on the prey
 The prisner hisses thro the liquid way
 Resists the royal hawk and tho oppressd
 She fights in volumes and erects her crest
 Turnd to her foe she stiffens evry scale
 And shoots her forky tongue and whisks her threatning tail
 Against the victor all defense is weak
 Th imperial bird still plies her with his beak
 He tears her bowels and her breast he gores
 Then claps his pinions and securely soars
 Thus thro the midst of circling enemies
 Strong Tarchon snatchd and bore away his prize
 The Tyrrhene troops that shrunk before now press
 The Latins and presume the like success

 Then Aruns doomd to death his arts assayd
 To murther unespied the Volscian maid
 This way and that his winding course he bends
 And wheresoer she turns her steps attends
 When she retires victorious from the chase
 He wheels about with care and shifts his place
 When rushing on she seeks her foes flight
 He keeps aloof but keeps her still in sight
 He threats and trembles trying evry way
 Unseen to kill and safely to betray
 Chloreus the priest of Cybele from far
 Glittring in Phrygian arms amidst the war
 Was by the virgin viewd The steed he pressd
 Was proud with trappings and his brawny chest
 With scales of gilded brass was coverd oer
 A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore
 With deadly wounds he galld the distant foe
 Gnossian his shafts and Lycian was his bow
 A golden helm his front and head surrounds
 A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds
 Gold weavd with linen on his thighs he wore
 With flowers of needlework distinguishd oer
 With golden buckles bound and gatherd up before
 Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes
 Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize
 Or that the temple might his trophies hold
 Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold
 Blind in her haste she chases him alone
 And seeks his life regardless of her own

 This lucky moment the sly traitor chose
 Then starting from his ambush up he rose
 And threw but first to Heavn addressd his vows
 O patron of Socrates high abodes
 Phoebus the ruling powr among the gods
 Whom first we serve whole woods of unctuous pine
 Are felld for thee and to thy glory shine
 By thee protected with our naked soles
 Thro flames unsingd we march and tread the kindled coals
 Give me propitious powr to wash away
 The stains of this dishonorable day
 Nor spoils nor triumph from the fact I claim
 But with my future actions trust my fame
 Let me by stealth this female plague oercome
 And from the field return inglorious home
 Apollo heard and granting half his prayr
 Shuffled in winds the rest and tossd in empty air
 He gives the death desird his safe return
 By southern tempests to the seas is borne

 Now when the javlin whizzd along the skies
 Both armies on Camilla turnd their eyes
 Directed by the sound Of either host
 Th unhappy virgin tho concernd the most
 Was only deaf so greedy was she bent
 On golden spoils and on her prey intent
 Till in her pap the winged weapon stood
 Infixd and deeply drunk the purple blood
 Her sad attendants hasten to sustain
 Their dying lady drooping on the plain
 Far from their sight the trembling Aruns flies
 With beating heart and fear confusd with joys
 Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow
 Or evn to bear the sight of his expiring foe
 As when the wolf has torn a bullocks hide
 At unawares or ranchd a shepherds side
 Conscious of his audacious deed he flies
 And claps his quivring tail between his thighs
 So speeding once the wretch no more attends
 But spurring forward herds among his friends

 She wrenchd the javlin with her dying hands
 But wedgd within her breast the weapon stands
 The wood she draws the steely point remains
 She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains
 A gathring mist oerclouds her cheerful eyes
 And from her cheeks the rosy color flies
 Then turns to her whom of her female train
 She trusted most and thus she speaks with pain
 Acca t is past he swims before my sight
 Inexorable Death and claims his right
 Bear my last words to Turnus fly with speed
 And bid him timely to my charge succeed
 Repel the Trojans and the town relieve
 Farewell and in this kiss my parting breath receive
 She said and sliding sunk upon the plain
 Dying her opend hand forsakes the rein
 Short and more short she pants by slow degrees
 Her mind the passage from her body frees
 She drops her sword she nods her plumy crest
 Her drooping head declining on her breast
 In the last sigh her struggling soul expires
 And murmring with disdain to Stygian sounds retires

 A shout that struck the golden stars ensued
 Despair and rage the languishd fight renewd
 The Trojan troops and Tuscans in a line
 Advance to charge the mixd Arcadians join

 But Cynthias maid high seated from afar
 Surveys the field and fortune of the war
 Unmovd a while till prostrate on the plain
 Weltring in blood she sees Camilla slain
 And round her corpse of friends and foes a fighting train
 Then from the bottom of her breast she drew
 A mournful sigh and these sad words ensue
 Too dear a fine ah much lamented maid
 For warring with the Trojans thou hast paid
 Nor aught availd in this unhappy strife
 Dianas sacred arms to save thy life
 Yet unrevengd thy goddess will not leave
 Her votrys death nor with vain sorrow grieve
 Branded the wretch and be his name abhorrd
 But after ages shall thy praise record
 Th inglorious coward soon shall press the plain
 Thus vows thy queen and thus the Fates ordain

 High oer the field there stood a hilly mound
 Sacred the place and spread with oaks around
 Where in a marble tomb Dercennus lay
 A king that once in Latium bore the sway
 The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight
 To mark the traitor Aruns from the height
 Him in refulgent arms she soon espied
 Swoln with success and loudly thus she cried
 Thy backward steps vain boaster are too late
 Turn like a man at length and meet thy fate
 Chargd with my message to Camilla go
 And say I sent thee to the shades below
 An honor undeservd from Cynthias bow

 She said and from her quiver chose with speed
 The winged shaft predestind for the deed
 Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied
 Till the far distant horns approachd on either side
 The bowstring touchd her breast so strong she drew
 Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew
 At once the twanging bow and sounding dart
 The traitor heard and felt the point within his heart
 Him beating with his heels in pangs of death
 His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath
 The conquring damsel with expanded wings
 The welcome message to her mistress brings

 Their leader lost the Volscians quit the field
 And unsustaind the chiefs of Turnus yield
 The frighted soldiers when their captains fly
 More on their speed than on their strength rely
 Confusd in flight they bear each other down
 And spur their horses headlong to the town
 Drivn by their foes and to their fears resignd
 Not once they turn but take their wounds behind
 These drop the shield and those the lance forego
 Or on their shoulders bear the slackend bow
 The hoofs of horses with a rattling sound
 Beat short and thick and shake the rotten ground
 Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky
 And oer the darkend walls and rampires fly
 The trembling matrons from their lofty stands
 Rend heavn with female shrieks and wring their hands
 All pressing on pursuers and pursued
 Are crushd in crowds a mingled multitude
 Some happy few escape the throng too late
 Rush on for entrance till they choke the gate
 Evn in the sight of home the wretched sire
 Looks on and sees his helpless son expire
 Then in a fright the folding gates they close
 But leave their friends excluded with their foes
 The vanquishd cry the victors loudly shout
 T is terror all within and slaughter all without
 Blind in their fear they bounce against the wall
 Or to the moats pursued precipitate their fall

 The Latian virgins valiant with despair
 Armd on the towrs the common danger share
 So much of zeal their countrys cause inspird
 So much Camillas great example fird
 Poles sharpend in the flames from high they throw
 With imitated darts to gall the foe
 Their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath
 And crowd each other to be first in death
 Meantime to Turnus ambushd in the shade
 With heavy tidings came th unhappy maid
 The Volscians overthrown Camilla killd
 The foes entirely masters of the field
 Like a resistless flood come rolling on
 The cry goes off the plain and thickens to the town

 Inflamd with rage for so the Furies fire
 The Daunians breast and so the Fates require
 He leaves the hilly pass the woods in vain
 Possessd and downward issues on the plain
 Scarce was he gone when to the straits now freed
 From secret foes the Trojan troops succeed
 Thro the black forest and the ferny brake
 Unknowingly secure their way they take
 From the rough mountains to the plain descend
 And there in order drawn their line extend
 Both armies now in open fields are seen
 Nor far the distance of the space between
 Both to the city bend Aeneas sees
 Thro smoking fields his hastning enemies
 And Turnus views the Trojans in array
 And hears th approaching horses proudly neigh
 Soon had their hosts in bloody battle joind
 But westward to the sea the sun declind
 Intrenchd before the town both armies lie
 While Night with sable wings involves the sky




 BOOK XII

 When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field
 Their armies broken and their courage quelld
 Himself become the mark of public spite
 His honor questiond for the promisd fight
 The more he was with vulgar hate oppressd
 The more his fury boild within his breast
 He rousd his vigor for the last debate
 And raisd his haughty soul to meet his fate

 As when the swains the Libyan lion chase
 He makes a sour retreat nor mends his pace
 But if the pointed javlin pierce his side
 The lordly beast returns with double pride
 He wrenches out the steel he roars for pain
 His sides he lashes and erects his mane
 So Turnus fares his eyeballs flash with fire
 Thro his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire

 Trembling with rage around the court he ran
 At length approachd the king and thus began
 No more excuses or delays I stand
 In arms prepard to combat hand to hand
 This base deserter of his native land
 The Trojan by his word is bound to take
 The same conditions which himself did make
 Renew the truce the solemn rites prepare
 And to my single virtue trust the war
 The Latians unconcernd shall see the fight
 This arm unaided shall assert your right
 Then if my prostrate body press the plain
 To him the crown and beauteous bride remain

 To whom the king sedately thus replied
 Brave youth the more your valor has been tried
 The more becomes it us with due respect
 To weigh the chance of war which you neglect
 You want not wealth or a successive throne
 Or cities which your arms have made your own
 My towns and treasures are at your command
 And stord with blooming beauties is my land
 Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees
 Unmarried fair of noble families
 Now let me speak and you with patience hear
 Things which perhaps may grate a lovers ear
 But sound advice proceeding from a heart
 Sincerely yours and free from fraudful art
 The gods by signs have manifestly shown
 No prince Italian born should heir my throne
 Oft have our augurs in prediction skilld
 And oft our priests foreign son reveald
 Yet won by worth that cannot be withstood
 Bribd by my kindness to my kindred blood
 Urgd by my wife who would not be denied
 I promisd my Lavinia for your bride
 Her from her plighted lord by force I took
 All ties of treaties and of honor broke
 On your account I wagd an impious war
 With what success t is needless to declare
 I and my subjects feel and you have had your share
 Twice vanquishd while in bloody fields we strive
 Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive
 The rolling flood runs warm with human gore
 The bones of Latians blanch the neighbring shore
 Why put I not an end to this debate
 Still unresolvd and still a slave to fate
 If Turnus death a lasting peace can give
 Why should I not procure it whilst you live
 Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray
 What would my kinsmen the Rutulians say
 And should you fall in fight which Heavn defend
 How curse the cause which hastend to his end
 The daughters lover and the fathers friend
 Weigh in your mind the various chance of war
 Pity your parents age and ease his care

 Such balmy words he pourd but all in vain
 The profferd medcine but provokd the pain
 The wrathful youth disdaining the relief
 With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief
 The care O best of fathers which you take
 For my concerns at my desire forsake
 Permit me not to languish out my days
 But make the best exchange of life for praise
 This arm this lance can well dispute the prize
 And the blood follows where the weapon flies
 His goddess mother is not near to shroud
 The flying coward with an empty cloud

 But now the queen who feard for Turnus life
 And loathd the hard conditions of the strife
 Held him by force and dying in his death
 In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath
 O Turnus I adjure thee by these tears
 And whateer price Amatas honor bears
 Within thy breast since thou art all my hope
 My sickly minds repose my sinking ages prop
 Since on the safety of thy life alone
 Depends Latinus and the Latian throne
 Refuse me not this one this only prayr
 To waive the combat and pursue the war
 Whatever chance attends this fatal strife
 Think it includes in thine Amatas life
 I cannot live a slave or see my throne
 Usurpd by strangers or a Trojan son

 At this a flood of tears Lavinia shed
 A crimson blush her beauteous face oerspread
 Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red
 The driving colors never at a stay
 Run here and there and flush and fade away
 Delightful change Thus Indian ivry shows
 Which with the bordring paint of purple glows
 Or lilies damaskd by the neighbring rose

 The lover gazd and burning with desire
 The more he lookd the more he fed the fire
 Revenge and jealous rage and secret spite
 Roll in his breast and rouse him to the fight
 Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes
 Firm to his first intent he thus replies
 O mother do not by your tears prepare
 Such boding omens and prejudge the war
 Resolvd on fight I am no longer free
 To shun my death if Heavn my death decree
 Then turning to the herald thus pursues
 Go greet the Trojan with ungrateful news
 Denounce from me that when tomorrows light
 Shall gild the heavns he need not urge the fight
 The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more
 Shall dye with mutual blood the Latian shore
 Our single swords the quarrel shall decide
 And to the victor be the beauteous bride

 He said and striding on with speedy pace
 He sought his coursers of the Thracian race
 At his approach they toss their heads on high
 And proudly neighing promise victory
 The sires of these Orythia sent from far
 To grace Pilumnus when he went to war
 The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white
 Nor northern winds in fleetness matchd their flight
 Officious grooms stand ready by his side
 And some with combs their flowing manes divide
 And others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride

 He sheathd his limbs in arms a temperd mass
 Of golden metal those and mountain brass
 Then to his head his glittring helm he tied
 And girt his faithful fauchion to his side
 In his Aetnaean forge the God of Fire
 That fauchion labord for the heros sire
 Immortal keenness on the blade bestowd
 And plungd it hissing in the Stygian flood
 Proppd on a pillar which the ceiling bore
 Was placd the lance Auruncan Actor wore
 Which with such force he brandishd in his hand
 The tough ash trembled like an osier wand
 Then cried O pondrous spoil of Actor slain
 And never yet by Turnus tossd in vain
 Fail not this day thy wonted force but go
 Sent by this hand to pierce the Trojan foe
 Give me to tear his corslet from his breast
 And from that eunuch head to rend the crest
 Draggd in the dust his frizzled hair to soil
 Hot from the vexing irn and smeard with fragrant oil

 Thus while he raves from his wide nostrils flies
 A fiery steam and sparkles from his eyes
 So fares the bull in his lovd females sight
 Proudly he bellows and preludes the fight
 He tries his goring horns against a tree
 And meditates his absent enemy
 He pushes at the winds he digs the strand
 With his black hoofs and spurns the yellow sand

 Nor less the Trojan in his Lemnian arms
 To future fight his manly courage warms
 He whets his fury and with joy prepares
 To terminate at once the lingring wars
 To cheer his chiefs and tender son relates
 What Heavn had promisd and expounds the fates
 Then to the Latian king he sends to cease
 The rage of arms and ratify the peace

 The morn ensuing from the mountains height
 Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light
 Th ethereal coursers bounding from the sea
 From out their flaming nostrils breathd the day
 When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard
 In friendly labor joind the list prepard
 Beneath the walls they measure out the space
 Then sacred altars rear on sods of grass
 Where with religious their common gods they place
 In purest white the priests their heads attire
 And living waters bear and holy fire
 And oer their linen hoods and shaded hair
 Long twisted wreaths of sacred veryain wear

 In order issuing from the town appears
 The Latin legion armd with pointed spears
 And from the fields advancing on a line
 The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join
 Their various arms afford a pleasing sight
 A peaceful train they seem in peace prepard for fight
 Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride
 Glittring with gold and vests in purple dyed
 Here Mnestheus author of the Memmian line
 And there Messapus born of seed divine
 The sign is givn and round the listed space
 Each man in order fills his proper place
 Reclining on their ample shields they stand
 And fix their pointed lances in the sand
 Now studious of the sight a numrous throng
 Of either sex promiscuous old and young
 Swarm the town by those who rest behind
 The gates and walls and houses tops are lind
 Meantime the Queen of Heavn beheld the sight
 With eyes unpleasd from Mount Albanos height
 Since calld Albano by succeeding fame
 But then an empty hill without a name
 She thence surveyd the field the Trojan powrs
 The Latian squadrons and Laurentine towrs
 Then thus the goddess of the skies bespoke
 With sighs and tears the goddess of the lake
 King Turnus sister once a lovely maid
 Ere to the lust of lawless Jove betrayd
 Compressd by force but by the grateful god
 Now made the Nais of the neighbring flood
 O nymph the pride of living lakes said she
 O most renownd and most belovd by me
 Long hast thou known nor need I to record
 The wanton sallies of my wandring lord
 Of evry Latian fair whom Jove misled
 To mount by stealth my violated bed
 To thee alone I grudgd not his embrace
 But gave a part of heavn and an unenvied place
 Now learn from me thy near approaching grief
 Nor think my wishes want to thy relief
 While fortune favord nor Heavns King denied
 To lend my succor to the Latian side
 I savd thy brother and the sinking state
 But now he struggles with unequal fate
 And goes with gods averse oermatchd in might
 To meet inevitable death in fight
 Nor must I break the truce nor can sustain the sight
 Thou if thou darst thy present aid supply
 It well becomes a sisters care to try

 At this the lovely nymph with grief oppressd
 Thrice tore her hair and beat her comely breast
 To whom Saturnia thus Thy tears are late
 Haste snatch him if he can be snatchd from fate
 New tumults kindle violate the truce
 Who knows what changeful fortune may produce
 T is not a crime t attempt what I decree
 Or if it were discharge the crime on me
 She said and sailing on the winged wind
 Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind

 And now pomp the peaceful kings appear
 Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear
 Twelve golden beams around his temples play
 To mark his lineage from the God of Day
 Two snowy coursers Turnus chariot yoke
 And in his hand two massy spears he shook
 Then issued from the camp in arms divine
 Aeneas author of the Roman line
 And by his side Ascanius took his place
 The second hope of Romes immortal race
 Adornd in white a revrend priest appears
 And offrings to the flaming altars bears
 A porket and a lamb that never sufferd shears
 Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes
 And strews the beasts designd for sacrifice
 With salt and meal with like officious care
 He marks their foreheads and he clips their hair
 Betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds
 With the same genrous juice the flame he feeds

 Aeneas then unsheathd his shining sword
 And thus with pious prayrs the gods adord
 Allseeing sun and thou Ausonian soil
 For which I have sustaind so long a toil
 Thou King of Heavn and thou the Queen of Air
 Propitious now and reconcild by prayr
 Thou God of War whose unresisted sway
 The labors and events of arms obey
 Ye living fountains and ye running floods
 All powrs of ocean all ethereal gods
 Hear and bear record if I fall in field
 Or recreant in the fight to Turnus yield
 My Trojans shall encrease Evanders town
 Ascanius shall renounce th Ausonian crown
 All claims all questions of debate shall cease
 Nor he nor they with force infringe the peace
 But if my juster arms prevail in fight
 As sure they shall if I divine aright
 My Trojans shall not oer th Italians reign
 Both equal both unconquerd shall remain
 Joind in their laws their lands and their abodes
 I ask but altars for my weary gods
 The care of those religious rites be mine
 The crown to King Latinus I resign
 His be the sovreign sway Nor will I share
 His powr in peace or his command in war
 For me my friends another town shall frame
 And bless the rising towrs with fair Lavinias name

 Thus he Then with erected eyes and hands
 The Latian king before his altar stands
 By the same heavn said he and earth and main
 And all the powrs that all the three contain
 By hell below and by that upper god
 Whose thunder signs the peace who seals it with his nod
 So let Latonas double offspring hear
 And doublefronted Janus what I swear
 I touch the sacred altars touch the flames
 And all those powrs attest and all their names
 Whatever chance befall on either side
 No term of time this union shall divide
 No force no fortune shall my vows unbind
 Or shake the steadfast tenor of my mind
 Not tho the circling seas should break their bound
 Oerflow the shores or sap the solid ground
 Not tho the lamps of heavn their spheres forsake
 Hurld down and hissing in the nether lake
 Evn as this royal scepter for he bore
 A scepter in his hand shall never more
 Shoot out in branches or renew the birth
 An orphan now cut from the mother earth
 By the keen ax dishonord of its hair
 And casd in brass for Latian kings to bear

 When thus in public view the peace was tied
 With solemn vows and sworn on either side
 All dues performd which holy rites require
 The victim beasts are slain before the fire
 The trembling entrails from their bodies torn
 And to the fattend flames in chargers borne

 Already the Rutulians deem their man
 Oermatchd in arms before the fight began
 First rising fears are whisperd thro the crowd
 Then gathring sound they murmur more aloud
 Now side to side they measure with their eyes
 The champions bulk their sinews and their size
 The nearer they approach the more is known
 Th apparent disadvantage of their own
 Turnus himself appears in public sight
 Conscious of fate desponding of the fight
 Slowly he moves and at his altar stands
 With eyes dejected and with trembling hands
 And while he mutters undistinguishd prayrs
 A livid deadness in his cheeks appears

 With anxious pleasure when Juturna viewd
 Th increasing fright of the mad multitude
 When their short sighs and thickning sobs she heard
 And found their ready minds for change prepard
 Dissembling her immortal form she took
 Camertus mien his habit and his look
 A chief of ancient blood in arms well known
 Was his great sire and he his greater son
 His shape assumd amid the ranks she ran
 And humoring their first motions thus began
 For shame Rutulians can you bear the sight
 Of one exposd for all in single fight
 Can we before the face of heavn confess
 Our courage colder or our numbers less
 View all the Trojan host th Arcadian band
 And Tuscan army count em as they stand
 Undaunted to the battle if we go
 Scarce evry second man will share a foe
 Turnus t is true in this unequal strife
 Shall lose with honor his devoted life
 Or change it rather for immortal fame
 Succeeding to the gods from whence he came
 But you a servile and inglorious band
 For foreign lords shall sow your native land
 Those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gaind
 Which have so long their lazy sons sustaind
 With words like these she carried her design
 A rising murmur runs along the line
 Then evn the city troops and Latians tird
 With tedious war seem with new souls inspird
 Their champions fate with pity they lament
 And of the league so lately sworn repent

 Nor fails the goddess to foment the rage
 With lying wonders and a false presage
 But adds a sign which present to their eyes
 Inspires new courage and a glad surprise
 For sudden in the fiery tracts above
 Appears in pomp th imperial bird of Jove
 A plump of fowl he spies that swim the lakes
 And oer their heads his sounding pinions shakes
 Then stooping on the fairest of the train
 In his strong talons trussd a silver swan
 Th Italians wonder at th unusual sight
 But while he lags and labors in his flight
 Behold the dastard fowl return anew
 And with united force the foe pursue
 Clamrous around the royal hawk they fly
 And thickning in a cloud oershade the sky
 They cuff they scratch they cross his airy course
 Nor can th incumberd bird sustain their force
 But vexd not vanquishd drops the pondrous prey
 And lightend of his burthen wings his way

 Th Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight
 Eager of action and demand the fight
 Then King Tolumnius versd in augurs arts
 Cries out and thus his boasted skill imparts
 At length t is granted what I long desird
 This this is what my frequent vows requird
 Ye gods I take your omen and obey
 Advance my friends and charge I lead the way
 These are the foreign foes whose impious band
 Like that rapacious bird infest our land
 But soon like him they shall be forcd to sea
 By strength united and forego the prey
 Your timely succor to your country bring
 Haste to the rescue and redeem your king

 He said and pressing onward thro the crew
 Poisd in his lifted arm his lance he threw
 The winged weapon whistling in the wind
 Came driving on nor missd the mark designd
 At once the cornel rattled in the skies
 At once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise
 Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood
 Born of Arcadian mixd with Tuscan blood
 Gylippus sons the fatal javlin flew
 Aimd at the midmost of the friendly crew
 A passage thro the jointed arms it found
 Just where the belt was to the body bound
 And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground
 Then fird with pious rage the genrous train
 Run madly forward to revenge the slain
 And some with eager haste their javlins throw
 And some with sword in hand assault the foe

 The wishd insult the Latine troops embrace
 And meet their ardor in the middle space
 The Trojans Tuscans and Arcadian line
 With equal courage obviate their design
 Peace leaves the violated fields and hate
 Both armies urges to their mutual fate
 With impious haste their altars are oerturnd
 The sacrifice halfbroild and halfunburnd
 Thick storms of steel from either army fly
 And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky
 Brands from the fire are missive weapons made
 With chargers bowls and all the priestly trade
 Latinus frighted hastens from the fray
 And bears his unregarded gods away
 These on their horses vault those yoke the car
 The rest with swords on high run headlong to the war

 Messapus eager to confound the peace
 Spurrd his hot courser thro the fighting prease
 At King Aulestes by his purple known
 A Tuscan prince and by his regal crown
 And with a shock encountring bore him down
 Backward he fell and as his fate designd
 The ruins of an altar were behind
 There pitching on his shoulders and his head
 Amid the scattring fires he lay supinely spread
 The beamy spear descending from above
 His cuirass piercd and thro his body drove
 Then with a scornful smile the victor cries
 The gods have found a fitter sacrifice
 Greedy of spoils th Italians strip the dead
 Of his rich armor and uncrown his head

 Priest Corynaeus armd his better hand
 From his own altar with a blazing brand
 And as Ebusus with a thundring pace
 Advancd to battle dashd it on his face
 His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires
 The crackling crop a noisome scent expires
 Following the blow he seizd his curling crown
 With his left hand his other cast him down
 The prostrate body with his knees he pressd
 And plungd his holy poniard in his breast

 While Podalirius with his sword pursued
 The shepherd Alsus thro the flying crowd
 Swiftly he turns and aims a deadly blow
 Full on the front of his unwary foe
 The broad ax enters with a crashing sound
 And cleaves the chin with one continued wound
 Warm blood and mingled brains besmear his arms around
 An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppressd
 And seald their heavy lids in endless rest

 But good Aeneas rushd amid the bands
 Bare was his head and naked were his hands
 In sign of truce then thus he cries aloud
 What sudden rage what new desire of blood
 Inflames your alterd minds O Trojans cease
 From impious arms nor violate the peace
 By human sanctions and by laws divine
 The terms are all agreed the war is mine
 Dismiss your fears and let the fight ensue
 This hand alone shall right the gods and you
 Our injurd altars and their broken vow
 To this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe

 Thus while he spoke unmindful of defense
 A winged arrow struck the pious prince
 But whether from some human hand it came
 Or hostile god is left unknown by fame
 No human hand or hostile god was found
 To boast the triumph of so base a wound

 When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain
 His chiefs dismayd his troops a fainting train
 Th unhopd event his heightend soul inspires
 At once his arms and coursers he requires
 Then with a leap his lofty chariot gains
 And with a ready hand assumes the reins
 He drives impetuous and whereer he goes
 He leaves behind a lane of slaughterd foes
 These his lance reaches over those he rolls
 His rapid car and crushes out their souls
 In vain the vanquishd fly the victor sends
 The dead mens weapons at their living friends
 Thus on the banks of Hebrus freezing flood
 The God of Battles in his angry mood
 Clashing his sword against his brazen shield
 Let loose the reins and scours along the field
 Before the wind his fiery coursers fly
 Groans the sad earth resounds the rattling sky
 Wrath Terror Treason Tumult and Despair
 Dire faces and deformd surround the car
 Friends of the god and followers of the war
 With fury not unlike nor less disdain
 Exulting Turnus flies along the plain
 His smoking horses at their utmost speed
 He lashes on and urges oer the dead
 Their fetlocks run with blood and when they bound
 The gore and gathring dust are dashd around
 Thamyris and Pholus masters of the war
 He killd at hand but Sthenelus afar
 From far the sons of Imbracus he slew
 Glaucus and Lades of the Lycian crew
 Both taught to fight on foot in battle joind
 Or mount the courser that outstrips the wind

 Meantime Eumedes vaunting in the field
 New fird the Trojans and their foes repelld
 This son of Dolon bore his grandsires name
 But emulated more his fathers fame
 His guileful father sent a nightly spy
 The Grecian camp and order to descry
 Hard enterprise and well he might require
 Achilles car and horses for his hire
 But met upon the scout th Aetolian prince
 In death bestowd a juster recompense
 Fierce Turnus viewd the Trojan from afar
 And launchd his javlin from his lofty car
 Then lightly leaping down pursued the blow
 And pressing with his foot his prostrate foe
 Wrenchd from his feeble hold the shining sword
 And plungd it in the bosom of its lord
 Possess said he the fruit of all thy pains
 And measure at thy length our Latian plains
 Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand
 Thus may they build their town and thus enjoy the land

 Then Dares Butes Sybaris he slew
 Whom oer his neck his floundring courser threw
 As when loud Boreas with his blustring train
 Stoops from above incumbent on the main
 Whereer he flies he drives the rack before
 And rolls the billows on th Aegaean shore
 So where resistless Turnus takes his course
 The scatterd squadrons bend before his force
 His crest of horses hair is blown behind
 By adverse air and rustles in the wind

 This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain
 And as the chariot rolld along the plain
 Light from the ground he leapt and seizd the rein
 Thus hung in air he still retaind his hold
 The coursers frighted and their course controlld
 The lance of Turnus reachd him as he hung
 And piercd his plated arms but passd along
 And only razd the skin He turnd and held
 Against his threatning foe his ample shield
 Then calld for aid but while he cried in vain
 The chariot bore him backward on the plain
 He lies reversd the victor king descends
 And strikes so justly where his helmet ends
 He lops the head The Latian fields are drunk
 With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk

 While he triumphs and while the Trojans yield
 The wounded prince is forcd to leave the field
 Strong Mnestheus and Achates often tried
 And young Ascanius weeping by his side
 Conduct him to his tent Scarce can he rear
 His limbs from earth supported on his spear
 Resolvd in mind regardless of the smart
 He tugs with both his hands and breaks the dart
 The steel remains No readier way he found
 To draw the weapon than t inlarge the wound
 Eager of fight impatient of delay
 He begs and his unwilling friends obey

 Iapis was at hand to prove his art
 Whose blooming youth so fird Apollos heart
 That for his love he profferd to bestow
 His tuneful harp and his unerring bow
 The pious youth more studious how to save
 His aged sire now sinking to the grave
 Preferrd the powr of plants and silent praise
 Of healing arts before Phoebean bays

 Proppd on his lance the pensive hero stood
 And heard and saw unmovd the mourning crowd
 The famd physician tucks his robes around
 With ready hands and hastens to the wound
 With gentle touches he performs his part
 This way and that soliciting the dart
 And exercises all his heavnly art
 All softning simples known of sovreign use
 He presses out and pours their noble juice
 These first infusd to lenify the pain
 He tugs with pincers but he tugs in vain
 Then to the patron of his art he prayd
 The patron of his art refusd his aid

 Meantime the war approaches to the tents
 Th alarm grows hotter and the noise augments
 The driving dust proclaims the danger near
 And first their friends and then their foes appear
 Their friends retreat their foes pursue the rear
 The camp is filld with terror and affright
 The hissing shafts within the trench alight
 An undistinguishd noise ascends the sky
 The shouts of those who kill and groans of those who die

 But now the goddess mother movd with grief
 And piercd with pity hastens her relief
 A branch of healing dittany she brought
 Which in the Cretan fields with care she sought
 Rough is the stern which woolly leafs surround
 The leafs with flowrs the flowrs with purple crownd
 Well known to wounded goats a sure relief
 To draw the pointed steel and ease the grief
 This Venus brings in clouds involvd and brews
 Th extracted liquor with ambrosian dews
 And odorous panacee Unseen she stands
 Tempring the mixture with her heavnly hands
 And pours it in a bowl already crownd
 With juice of medcnal herbs prepard to bathe the wound
 The leech unknowing of superior art
 Which aids the cure with this foments the part
 And in a moment ceasd the raging smart
 Stanchd is the blood and in the bottom stands
 The steel but scarcely touchd with tender hands
 Moves up and follows of its own accord
 And health and vigor are at once restord
 Iapis first perceivd the closing wound
 And first the footsteps of a god he found
 Arms arms he cries the sword and shield prepare
 And send the willing chief renewd to war
 This is no mortal work no cure of mine
 Nor arts effect but done by hands divine
 Some god our general to the battle sends
 Some god preserves his life for greater ends

 The hero arms in haste his hands infold
 His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold
 Inflamd to fight and rushing to the field
 That hand sustaining the celestial shield
 This gripes the lance and with such vigor shakes
 That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes
 Then with a close embrace he straind his son
 And kissing thro his helmet thus begun
 My son from my example learn the war
 In camps to suffer and in fields to dare
 But happier chance than mine attend thy care
 This day my hand thy tender age shall shield
 And crown with honors of the conquerd field
 Thou when thy riper years shall send thee forth
 To toils of war be mindful of my worth
 Assert thy birthright and in arms be known
 For Hectors nephew and Aeneas son
 He said and striding issued on the plain
 Anteus and Mnestheus and a numrous train
 Attend his steps the rest their weapons take
 And crowding to the field the camp forsake
 A cloud of blinding dust is raisd around
 Labors beneath their feet the trembling ground

 Now Turnus posted on a hill from far
 Beheld the progress of the moving war
 With him the Latins viewd the coverd plains
 And the chill blood ran backward in their veins
 Juturna saw th advancing troops appear
 And heard the hostile sound and fled for fear
 Aeneas leads and draws a sweeping train
 Closd in their ranks and pouring on the plain
 As when a whirlwind rushing to the shore
 From the mid ocean drives the waves before
 The painful hind with heavy heart foresees
 The flatted fields and slaughter of the trees
 With like impetuous rage the prince appears
 Before his doubled front nor less destruction bears
 And now both armies shock in open field
 Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus killd
 Archetius Ufens Epulon are slain
 All famd in arms and of the Latian train
 By Gyas Mnestheus and Achates hand
 The fatal augur falls by whose command
 The truce was broken and whose lance embrued
 With Trojan blood th unhappy fight renewd
 Loud shouts and clamors rend the liquid sky
 And oer the field the frighted Latins fly
 The prince disdains the dastards to pursue
 Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few
 Turnus alone amid the dusky plain
 He seeks and to the combat calls in vain
 Juturna heard and seizd with mortal fear
 Forcd from the beam her brothers charioteer
 Assumes his shape his armor and his mien
 And like Metiscus in his seat is seen

 As the black swallow near the palace plies
 Oer empty courts and under arches flies
 Now hawks aloft now skims along the flood
 To furnish her loquacious nest with food
 So drives the rapid goddess oer the plains
 The smoking horses run with loosend reins
 She steers a various course among the foes
 Now here now there her conquring brother shows
 Now with a straight now with a wheeling flight
 She turns and bends but shuns the single fight
 Aeneas fird with fury breaks the crowd
 And seeks his foe and calls by name aloud
 He runs within a narrower ring and tries
 To stop the chariot but the chariot flies
 If he but gain a glimpse Juturna fears
 And far away the Daunian hero bears

 What should he do Nor arts nor arms avail
 And various cares in vain his mind assail
 The great Messapus thundring thro the field
 In his left hand two pointed javlins held
 Encountring on the prince one dart he drew
 And with unerring aim and utmost vigor threw
 Aeneas saw it come and stooping low
 Beneath his buckler shunnd the threatning blow
 The weapon hissd above his head and tore
 The waving plume which on his helm he wore
 Forced by this hostile act and fird with spite
 That flying Turnus still declind the fight
 The Prince whose piety had long repelld
 His inborn ardor now invades the field
 Invokes the powrs of violated peace
 Their rites and injurd altars to redress
 Then to his rage abandoning the rein
 With blood and slaughterd bodies fills the plain

 What god can tell what numbers can display
 The various labors of that fatal day
 What chiefs and champions fell on either side
 In combat slain or by what deaths they died
 Whom Turnus whom the Trojan hero killd
 Who shard the fame and fortune of the field
 Jove couldst thou view and not avert thy sight
 Two jarring nations joind in cruel fight
 Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite

 Aeneas first Rutulian Sucro found
 Whose valor made the Trojans quit their ground
 Betwixt his ribs the javlin drove so just
 It reachd his heart nor needs a second thrust
 Now Turnus at two blows two brethren slew
 First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw
 Then leaping on the ground on foot assaild
 Diores and in equal fight prevaild
 Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place
 Their heads distilling gore his chariot grace

 Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw
 Whom without respite at one charge he slew
 Cethegus Tanais Tagus fell oppressd
 And sad Onythes added to the rest
 Of Theban blood whom Peridia bore

 Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore
 And from Apollos fane to battle sent
 Oerthrew nor Phoebus could their fate prevent
 Peaceful Menoetes after these he killd
 Who long had shunnd the dangers of the field
 On Lernas lake a silent life he led
 And with his nets and angle earnd his bread
 Nor pompous cares nor palaces he knew
 But wisely from th infectious world withdrew
 Poor was his house his fathers painful hand
 Dischargd his rent and plowd anothers land

 As flames among the lofty woods are thrown
 On diffrent sides and both by winds are blown
 The laurels crackle in the sputtring fire
 The frighted sylvans from their shades retire
 Or as two neighbring torrents fall from high
 Rapid they run the foamy waters fry
 They roll to sea with unresisted force
 And down the rocks precipitate their course
 Not with less rage the rival heroes take
 Their diffrent ways nor less destruction make
 With spears afar with swords at hand they strike
 And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike
 Like them their dauntless men maintain the field
 And hearts are piercd unknowing how to yield
 They blow for blow return and wound for wound
 And heaps of bodies raise the level ground

 Murranus boasting of his blood that springs
 From a long royal race of Latian kings
 Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown
 Crushd with the weight of an unwieldy stone
 Betwixt the wheels he fell the wheels that bore
 His living load his dying body tore
 His starting steeds to shun the glittring sword
 Paw down his trampled limbs forgetful of their lord

 Fierce Hyllus threatend high and face to face
 Affronted Turnus in the middle space
 The prince encounterd him in full career
 And at his temples aimd the deadly spear
 So fatally the flying weapon sped
 That thro his helm it piercd his head
 Nor Cisseus couldst thou scape from Turnus hand
 In vain the strongest of th Arcadian band
 Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford
 Availing aid against th Aenean sword
 Which to his naked heart pursued the course
 Nor could his plated shield sustain the force

 Iolas fell whom not the Grecian powrs
 Nor great subverter of the Trojan towrs
 Were doomd to kill while Heavn prolongd his date
 But who can pass the bounds prefixd by fate
 In high Lyrnessus and in Troy he held
 Two palaces and was from each expelld
 Of all the mighty man the last remains
 A little spot of foreign earth contains

 And now both hosts their broken troops unite
 In equal ranks and mix in mortal fight
 Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join
 The Trojan Tuscan and Arcadian line
 Seaborn Messapus with Atinas heads
 The Latin squadrons and to battle leads
 They strike they push they throng the scanty space
 Resolvd on death impatient of disgrace
 And where one falls another fills his place

 The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son
 To leave th unfinishd fight and storm the town
 For while he rolls his eyes around the plain
 In quest of Turnus whom he seeks in vain
 He views th unguarded city from afar
 In careless quiet and secure of war
 Occasion offers and excites his mind
 To dare beyond the task he first designd
 Resolvd he calls his chiefs they leave the fight
 Attended thus he takes a neighbring height
 The crowding troops about their genral stand
 All under arms and wait his high command
 Then thus the lofty prince Hear and obey
 Ye Trojan bands without the least delay
 Jove is with us and what I have decreed
 Requires our utmost vigor and our speed
 Your instant arms against the town prepare
 The source of mischief and the seat of war
 This day the Latian towrs that mate the sky
 Shall level with the plain in ashes lie
 The people shall be slaves unless in time
 They kneel for pardon and repent their crime
 Twice have our foes been vanquishd on the plain
 Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain
 Your force against the perjurd city bend
 There it began and there the war shall end
 The peace profand our rightful arms requires
 Cleanse the polluted place with purging fires

 He finishd and one soul inspiring all
 Formd in a wedge the foot approach the wall
 Without the town an unprovided train
 Of gaping gazing citizens are slain
 Some firebrands others scaling ladders bear
 And those they toss aloft and these they rear
 The flames now launchd the featherd arrows fly
 And clouds of missive arms obscure the sky
 Advancing to the front the hero stands
 And stretching out to heavn his pious hands
 Attests the gods asserts his innocence
 Upbraids with breach of faith th Ausonian prince
 Declares the royal honor doubly staind
 And twice the rites of holy peace profand

 Dissenting clamors in the town arise
 Each will be heard and all at once advise
 One part for peace and one for war contends
 Some would exclude their foes and some admit their friends
 The helpless king is hurried in the throng
 And whateer tide prevails is borne along
 Thus when the swain within a hollow rock
 Invades the bees with suffocating smoke
 They run around or labor on their wings
 Disusd to flight and shoot their sleepy stings
 To shun the bitter fumes in vain they try
 Black vapors issuing from the vent involve the sky

 But fate and envious fortune now prepare
 To plunge the Latins in the last despair
 The queen who saw the foes invade the town
 And brands on tops of burning houses thrown
 Cast round her eyes distracted with her fear
 No troops of Turnus in the field appear
 Once more she stares abroad but still in vain
 And then concludes the royal youth is slain
 Mad with her anguish impotent to bear
 The mighty grief she loathes the vital air
 She calls herself the cause of all this ill
 And owns the dire effects of her ungovernd will
 She raves against the gods she beats her breast
 She tears with both her hands her purple vest
 Then round a beam a running noose she tied
 And fastend by the neck obscenely died

 Soon as the fatal news by Fame was blown
 And to her dames and to her daughter known
 The sad Lavinia rends her yellow hair
 And rosy cheeks the rest her sorrow share
 With shrieks the palace rings and madness of despair
 The spreading rumor fills the public place
 Confusion fear distraction and disgrace
 And silent shame are seen in evry face
 Latinus tears his garments as he goes
 Both for his public and his private woes
 With filth his venerable beard besmears
 And sordid dust deforms his silver hairs
 And much he blames the softness of his mind
 Obnoxious to the charms of womankind
 And soon seducd to change what he so well designd
 To break the solemn league so long desird
 Nor finish what his fates and those of Troy requird

 Now Turnus rolls aloof oer empty plains
 And here and there some straggling foes he gleans
 His flying coursers please him less and less
 Ashamd of easy fight and cheap success
 Thus halfcontented anxious in his mind
 The distant cries come driving in the wind
 Shouts from the walls but shouts in murmurs drownd
 A jarring mixture and a boding sound
 Alas said he what mean these dismal cries
 What doleful clamors from the town arise
 Confusd he stops and backward pulls the reins
 She who the drivers office now sustains
 Replies Neglect my lord these new alarms
 Here fight and urge the fortune of your arms
 There want not others to defend the wall
 If by your rivals hand th Italians fall
 So shall your fatal sword his friends oppress
 In honor equal equal in success

 To this the prince O sister for I knew
 The peace infringd proceeded first from you
 I knew you when you mingled first in fight
 And now in vain you would deceive my sight
 Why goddess this unprofitable care
 Who sent you down from heavn involvd in air
 Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain
 And see your brother bleeding on the plain
 For to what powr can Turnus have recourse
 Or how resist his fates prevailing force
 These eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground
 Mighty the man and mighty was the wound
 I heard my dearest friend with dying breath
 My name invoking to revenge his death
 Brave Ufens fell with honor on the place
 To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace
 On earth supine a manly corpse he lies
 His vest and armor are the victors prize
 Then shall I see Laurentum in a flame
 Which only wanted to complete my shame
 How will the Latins hoot their champions flight
 How Drances will insult and point them to the sight
 Is death so hard to bear Ye gods below
 Since those above so small compassion show
 Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame
 Which not belies my great forefathers name

 He said and while he spoke with flying speed
 Came Sages urging on his foamy steed
 Fixd on his wounded face a shaft he bore
 And seeking Turnus sent his voice before
 Turnus on you on you alone depends
 Our last relief compassionate your friends
 Like lightning fierce Aeneas rolling on
 With arms invests with flames invades the town
 The brands are tossd on high the winds conspire
 To drive along the deluge of the fire
 All eyes are fixd on you your foes rejoice
 Evn the king staggers and suspends his choice
 Doubts to deliver or defend the town
 Whom to reject or whom to call his son
 The queen on whom your utmost hopes were placd
 Herself suborning death has breathd her last
 T is true Messapus fearless of his fate
 With fierce Atinas aid defends the gate
 On evry side surrounded by the foe
 The more they kill the greater numbers grow
 An iron harvest mounts and still remains to mow
 You far aloof from your forsaken bands
 Your rolling chariot drive oer empty sands

 Stupid he sate his eyes on earth declind
 And various cares revolving in his mind
 Rage boiling from the bottom of his breast
 And sorrow mixd with shame his soul oppressd
 And conscious worth lay labring in his thought
 And love by jealousy to madness wrought
 By slow degrees his reason drove away
 The mists of passion and resumd her sway
 Then rising on his car he turnd his look
 And saw the town involvd in fire and smoke
 A wooden towr with flames already blazd
 Which his own hands on beams and rafters raisd
 And bridges laid above to join the space
 And wheels below to roll from place to place
 Sister the Fates have vanquishd let us go
 The way which Heavn and my hard fortune show
 The fight is fixd nor shall the branded name
 Of a base coward blot your brothers fame
 Death is my choice but suffer me to try
 My force and vent my rage before I die
 He said and leaping down without delay
 Thro crowds of scatterd foes he freed his way
 Striding he passd impetuous as the wind
 And left the grieving goddess far behind
 As when a fragment from a mountain torn
 By raging tempests or by torrents borne
 Or sappd by time or loosend from the roots
 Prone thro the void the rocky ruin shoots
 Rolling from crag to crag from steep to steep
 Down sink at once the shepherds and their sheep
 Involvd alike they rush to nether ground
 Stunnd with the shock they fall and stunnd from earth rebound
 So Turnus hasting headlong to the town
 Shouldring and shoving bore the squadrons down
 Still pressing onward to the walls he drew
 Where shafts and spears and darts promiscuous flew
 And sanguine streams the slippry ground embrue
 First stretching out his arm in sign of peace
 He cries aloud to make the combat cease
 Rutulians hold and Latin troops retire
 The fight is mine and me the gods require
 T is just that I should vindicate alone
 The broken truce or for the breach atone
 This day shall free from wars th Ausonian state
 Or finish my misfortunes in my fate

 Both armies from their bloody work desist
 And bearing backward form a spacious list
 The Trojan hero who receivd from fame
 The welcome sound and heard the champions name
 Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls
 Greedy of war where greater glory calls
 He springs to fight exulting in his force
 His jointed armor rattles in the course
 Like Eryx or like Athos great he shows
 Or Father Apennine when white with snows
 His head divine obscure in clouds he hides
 And shakes the sounding forest on his sides
 The nations overawd surcease the fight
 Immovable their bodies fixd their sight
 Evn death stands still nor from above they throw
 Their darts nor drive their battringrams below
 In silent order either army stands
 And drop their swords unknowing from their hands
 Th Ausonian king beholds with wondring sight
 Two mighty champions matchd in single fight
 Born under climes remote and brought by fate
 With swords to try their titles to the state

 Now in closd field each other from afar
 They view and rushing on begin the war
 They launch their spears then hand to hand they meet
 The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet
 Their bucklers clash thick blows descend from high
 And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly
 Courage conspires with chance and both ingage
 With equal fortune yet and mutual rage
 As when two bulls for their fair female fight
 In Silas shades or on Taburnus height
 With horns adverse they meet the keeper flies
 Mute stands the herd the heifers roll their eyes
 And wait th event which victor they shall bear
 And who shall be the lord to rule the lusty year
 With rage of love the jealous rivals burn
 And push for push and wound for wound return
 Their dewlaps gord their sides are lavd in blood
 Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro the wood
 Such was the combat in the listed ground
 So clash their swords and so their shields resound

 Jove sets the beam in either scale he lays
 The champions fate and each exactly weighs
 On this side life and lucky chance ascends
 Loaded with death that other scale descends
 Raisd on the stretch young Turnus aims a blow
 Full on the helm of his unguarded foe
 Shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side
 As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide
 But all in pieces flies the traitor sword
 And in the middle stroke deserts his lord
 Now is but death or flight disarmd he flies
 When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies
 Fame says that Turnus when his steeds he joind
 Hurrying to war disorderd in his mind
 Snatchd the first weapon which his haste could find
 T was not the fated sword his father bore
 But that his charioteer Metiscus wore
 This while the Trojans fled the toughness held
 But vain against the great Vulcanian shield
 The mortaltemperd steel deceivd his hand
 The shiverd fragments shone amid the sand

 Surprisd with fear he fled along the field
 And now forthright and now in orbits wheeld
 For here the Trojan troops the list surround
 And there the pass is closd with pools and marshy ground
 Aeneas hastens tho with heavier pace
 His wound so newly knit retards the chase
 And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse
 Yet pressing foot by foot his foe pursues

 Thus when a fearful stag is closd around
 With crimson toils or in a river found
 High on the bank the deepmouthd hound appears
 Still opening following still whereer he steers
 The persecuted creature to and fro
 Turns here and there to scape his Umbrian foe
 Steep is th ascent and if he gains the land
 The purple death is pitchd along the strand
 His eager foe determind to the chase
 Stretchd at his length gains ground at evry pace
 Now to his beamy head he makes his way
 And now he holds or thinks he holds his prey
 Just at the pinch the stag springs out with fear
 He bites the wind and fills his sounding jaws with air
 The rocks the lakes the meadows ring with cries
 The mortal tumult mounts and thunders in the skies
 Thus flies the Daunian prince and flying blames
 His tardy troops and calling by their names
 Demands his trusty sword The Trojan threats
 The realm with ruin and their ancient seats
 To lay in ashes if they dare supply
 With arms or aid his vanquishd enemy
 Thus menacing he still pursues the course
 With vigor tho diminishd of his force
 Ten times already round the listed place
 One chief had fled and t other givn the chase
 No trivial prize is playd for on the life
 Or death of Turnus now depends the strife

 Within the space an olive tree had stood
 A sacred shade a venerable wood
 For vows to Faunus paid the Latins guardian god
 Here hung the vests and tablets were ingravd
 Of sinking mariners from shipwrack savd
 With heedless hands the Trojans felld the tree
 To make the ground inclosd for combat free
 Deep in the root whether by fate or chance
 Or erring haste the Trojan drove his lance
 Then stoopd and tuggd with force immense to free
 Th incumberd spear from the tenacious tree
 That whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain
 His flying weapon might from far attain

 Confusd with fear bereft of human aid
 Then Turnus to the gods and first to Faunus prayd
 O Faunus pity and thou Mother Earth
 Where I thy foster son receivd my birth
 Hold fast the steel If my religious hand
 Your plant has honord which your foes profand
 Propitious hear my pious prayr He said
 Nor with successless vows invokd their aid
 Th incumbent hero wrenchd and pulld and straind
 But still the stubborn earth the steel detaind
 Juturna took her time and while in vain
 He strove assumd Meticus form again
 And in that imitated shape restord
 To the despairing prince his Daunian sword
 The Queen of Love who with disdain and grief
 Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief
 T assert her offspring with a greater deed
 From the tough root the lingring weapon freed

 Once more erect the rival chiefs advance
 One trusts the sword and one the pointed lance
 And both resolvd alike to try their fatal chance

 Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke
 Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock
 What new arrest O Queen of Heavn is sent
 To stop the Fates now labring in th event
 What farther hopes are left thee to pursue
 Divine Aeneas and thou knowst it too
 Foredoomd to these celestial seats are due
 What more attempts for Turnus can be made
 That thus thou lingrest in this lonely shade
 Is it becoming of the due respect
 And awful honor of a god elect
 A wound unworthy of our state to feel
 Patient of human hands and earthly steel
 Or seems it just the sister should restore
 A second sword when one was lost before
 And arm a conquerd wretch against his conqueror
 For what without thy knowledge and avow
 Nay more thy dictate durst Juturna do
 At last in deference to my love forbear
 To lodge within thy soul this anxious care
 Reclind upon my breast thy grief unload
 Who should relieve the goddess but the god
 Now all things to their utmost issue tend
 Pushd by the Fates to their appointed
 While leave was givn thee and a lawful hour
 For vengeance wrath and unresisted powr
 Tossd on the seas thou couldst thy foes distress
 And drivn ashore with hostile arms oppress
 Deform the royal house and from the side
 Of the just bridegroom tear the plighted bride
 Now cease at my command The Thundrer said
 And with dejected eyes this answer Juno made
 Because your dread decree too well I knew
 From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew
 Else should you not behold me here alone
 Involvd in empty clouds my friends bemoan
 But girt with vengeful flames in open sight
 Engagd against my foes in mortal fight
 T is true Juturna mingled in the strife
 By my command to save her brothers life
 At least to try but by the Stygian lake
 The most religious oath the gods can take
 With this restriction not to bend the bow
 Or toss the spear or trembling dart to throw
 And now resignd to your superior might
 And tird with fruitless toils I loathe the fight
 This let me beg and this no fates withstand
 Both for myself and for your fathers land
 That when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace
 Which I since you ordain consent to bless
 The laws of either nation be the same
 But let the Latins still retain their name
 Speak the same language which they spoke before
 Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore
 Call them not Trojans perish the renown
 And name of Troy with that detested town
 Latium be Latium still let Alba reign
 And Romes immortal majesty remain

 Then thus the founder of mankind replies
 Unruffled was his front serene his eyes
 Can Saturns issue and heavns other heir
 Such endless anger in her bosom bear
 Be mistress and your full desires obtain
 But quench the choler you foment in vain
 From ancient blood th Ausonian people sprung
 Shall keep their name their habit and their tongue
 The Trojans to their customs shall be tied
 I will myself their common rites provide
 The natives shall command the foreigners subside
 All shall be Latium Troy without a name
 And her lost sons forget from whence they came
 From blood so mixd a pious race shall flow
 Equal to gods excelling all below
 No nation more respect to you shall pay
 Or greater offrings on your altars lay
 Juno consents well pleasd that her desires
 Had found success and from the cloud retires

 The peace thus made the Thundrer next prepares
 To force the watry goddess from the wars
 Deep in the dismal regions void of light
 Three daughters at a birth were born to Night
 These their brown mother brooding on her care
 Indued with windy wings to flit in air
 With serpents girt alike and crownd with hissing hair
 In heavn the Dirae calld and still at hand
 Before the throne of angry Jove they stand
 His ministers of wrath and ready still
 The minds of mortal men with fears to fill
 Wheneer the moody sire to wreak his hate
 On realms or towns deserving of their fate
 Hurls down diseases death and deadly care
 And terrifies the guilty world with war
 One sister plague if these from heavn he sent
 To fright Juturna with a dire portent
 The pest comes whirling down by far more slow
 Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow
 Or Cydon yew when traversing the skies
 And drenchd in poisnous juice the sure destruction flies
 With such a sudden and unseen a flight
 Shot thro the clouds the daughter of the night
 Soon as the field inclosd she had in view
 And from afar her destind quarry knew
 Contracted to the boding bird she turns
 Which haunts the ruind piles and hallowd urns
 And beats about the tombs with nightly wings
 Where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings
 Thus lessend in her form with frightful cries
 The Fury round unhappy Turnus flies
 Flaps on his shield and flutters oer his eyes

 A lazy chillness crept along his blood
 Chokd was his voice his hair with horror stood
 Juturna from afar beheld her fly
 And knew th ill omen by her screaming cry
 And stridor of her wings Amazd with fear
 Her beauteous breast she beat and rent her flowing hair

 Ah me she cries in this unequal strife
 What can thy sister more to save thy life
 Weak as I am can I alas contend
 In arms with that inexorable fiend
 Now now I quit the field forbear to fright
 My tender soul ye baleful birds of night
 The lashing of your wings I know too well
 The sounding flight and funral screams of hell
 These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove
 The worthy recompense of ravishd love
 Did he for this exempt my life from fate
 O hard conditions of immortal state
 Tho born to death not privilegd to die
 But forcd to bear imposd eternity
 Take back your envious bribes and let me go
 Companion to my brothers ghost below
 The joys are vanishd nothing now remains
 Of life immortal but immortal pains
 What earth will open her devouring womb
 To rest a weary goddess in the tomb
 She drew a length of sighs nor more she said
 But in her azure mantle wrappd her head
 Then plungd into her stream with deep despair
 And her last sobs came bubbling up in air

 Now stern Aeneas his weighty spear
 Against his foe and thus upbraids his fear
 What farther subterfuge can Turnus find
 What empty hopes are harbord in his mind
 T is not thy swiftness can secure thy flight
 Not with their feet but hands the valiant fight
 Vary thy shape in thousand forms and dare
 What skill and courage can attempt in war
 Wish for the wings of winds to mount the sky
 Or hid within the hollow earth to lie
 The champion shook his head and made this short reply
 No threats of thine my manly mind can move
 T is hostile heavn I dread and partial Jove
 He said no more but with a sigh repressd
 The mighty sorrow in his swelling breast

 Then as he rolld his troubled eyes around
 An antique stone he saw the common bound
 Of neighbring fields and barrier of the ground
 So vast that twelve strong men of modern days
 Th enormous weight from earth could hardly raise
 He heavd it at a lift and poisd on high
 Ran staggring on against his enemy
 But so disorderd that he scarcely knew
 His way or what unwieldly weight he threw
 His knocking knees are bent beneath the load
 And shivring cold congeals his vital blood
 The stone drops from his arms and falling short
 For want of vigor mocks his vain effort
 And as when heavy sleep has closd the sight
 The sickly fancy labors in the night
 We seem to run and destitute of force
 Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course
 In vain we heave for breath in vain we cry
 The nerves unbracd their usual strength deny
 And on the tongue the faltring accents die
 So Turnus fard whatever means he tried
 All force of arms and points of art employd
 The Fury flew athwart and made th endeavor void

 A thousand various thoughts his soul confound
 He stard about nor aid nor issue found
 His own men stop the pass and his own walls surround
 Once more he pauses and looks out again
 And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain
 Trembling he views the thundring chief advance
 And brandishing aloft the deadly lance
 Amazd he cowrs beneath his conquring foe
 Forgets to ward and waits the coming blow
 Astonishd while he stands and fixd with fear
 Aimd at his shield he sees th impending spear

 The hero measurd first with narrow view
 The destind mark and rising as he threw
 With its full swing the fatal weapon flew
 Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls
 Or stones from battringengines break the walls
 Swift as a whirlwind from an arm so strong
 The lance drove on and bore the death along
 Naught could his sevnfold shield the prince avail
 Nor aught beneath his arms the coat of mail
 It piercd thro all and with a grisly wound
 Transfixd his thigh and doubled him to ground
 With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky
 Woods hills and valleys to the voice reply

 Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid
 With eyes cast upward and with arms displayd
 And recreant thus to the proud victor prayd
 I know my death deservd nor hope to live
 Use what the gods and thy good fortune give
 Yet think O think if mercy may be shown
 Thou hadst a father once and hast a son
 Pity my sire now sinking to the grave
 And for Anchises sake old Daunus save
 Or if thy vowd revenge pursue my death
 Give to my friends my body void of breath
 The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life
 Thine is the conquest thine the royal wife
 Against a yielded man t is mean ignoble strife

 In deep suspense the Trojan seemd to stand
 And just prepard to strike repressd his hand
 He rolld his eyes and evry moment felt
 His manly soul with more compassion melt
 When casting down a casual glance he spied
 The golden belt that glitterd on his side
 The fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore
 From dying Pallas and in triumph wore
 Then rousd anew to wrath he loudly cries
 Flames while he spoke came flashing from his eyes
 Traitor dost thou dost thou to grace pretend
 Clad as thou art in trophies of my friend
 To his sad soul a grateful offring go
 T is Pallas Pallas gives this deadly blow
 He raisd his arm aloft and at the word
 Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword
 The streaming blood distaind his arms around
 And the disdainful soul came rushing thro the wound
