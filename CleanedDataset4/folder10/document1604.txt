THE EBBTIDE

A TRIO AND QUARTETTE


By Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyde Osbourne



 There is a tide in the affairs of men




Part I



Chapter 1 NIGHT ON THE BEACH

Throughout the island world of the Pacific scattered men of many
European races and from almost every grade of society carry activity and
disseminate disease Some prosper some vegetate Some have mounted the
steps of thrones and owned islands and navies Others again must marry
for a livelihood a strapping merry chocolatecoloured dame supports
them in sheer idleness and dressed like natives but still retaining
some foreign element of gait or attitude still perhaps with some relic
such as a single eyeglass of the officer and gentleman they sprawl
in palmleaf verandahs and entertain an island audience with memoirs of
the musichall And there are still others less pliable less capable
less fortunate perhaps less base who continue even in these isles of
plenty to lack bread

At the far end of the town of Papeete three such men were seated on the
beach under a purao tree

It was late Long ago the band had broken up and marched musically home
a motley troop of men and women merchant clerks and navy officers
dancing in its wake arms about waist and crowned with garlands Long
ago darkness and silence had gone from house to house about the tiny
pagan city Only the street lamps shone on making a glowworm halo in
the umbrageous alleys or drawing a tremulous image on the waters of the
port A sound of snoring ran among the piles of lumber by the Government
pier It was wafted ashore from the graceful clipperbottomed schooners
where they lay moored close in like dinghies and their crews were
stretched upon the deck under the open sky or huddled in a rude tent
amidst the disorder of merchandise

But the men under the purao had no thought of sleep The same
temperature in England would have passed without remark in summer but
it was bitter cold for the South Seas Inanimate nature knew it and the
bottle of cocoanut oil stood frozen in every birdcage house about
the island and the men knew it and shivered They wore flimsy cotton
clothes the same they had sweated in by day and run the gauntlet of the
tropic showers and to complete their evil case they had no breakfast
to mention less dinner and no supper at all

In the telling South Sea phrase these three men were ON THE BEACH
Common calamity had brought them acquainted as the three most miserable
Englishspeaking creatures in Tahiti and beyond their misery they knew
next to nothing of each other not even their true names For each had
made a long apprenticeship in going downward and each at some stage of
the descent had been shamed into the adoption of an alias And yet not
one of them had figured in a court of justice two were men of kindly
virtues and one as he sat and shivered under the purao had a tattered
Virgil in his pocket

Certainly if money could have been raised upon the book Robert Herrick
would long ago have sacrificed that last possession but the demand
for literature which is so marked a feature in some parts of the South
Seas extends not so far as the dead tongues and the Virgil which he
could not exchange against a meal had often consoled him in his hunger
He would study it as he lay with tightened belt on the floor of the
old calaboose seeking favourite passages and finding new ones only less
beautiful because they lacked the consecration of remembrance Or he
would pause on random country walks sit on the path side gazing over
the sea on the mountains of Eimeo and dip into the Aeneid seeking
sortes And if the oracle as is the way of oracles replied with no
very certain nor encouraging voice visions of England at least
would throng upon the exiles memory the busy schoolroom the green
playingfields holidays at home and the perennial roar of London and
the fireside and the white head of his father For it is the destiny of
those grave restrained and classic writers with whom we make enforced
and often painful acquaintanceship at school to pass into the blood and
become native in the memory so that a phrase of Virgil speaks not so
much of Mantua or Augustus but of English places and the students own
irrevocable youth

Robert Herrick was the son of an intelligent active and ambitious man
small partner in a considerable London house Hopes were conceived
of the boy he was sent to a good school gained there an Oxford
scholarship and proceeded in course to the Western University With all
his talent and taste and he had much of both Robert was deficient
in consistency and intellectual manhood wandered in bypaths of study
worked at music or at metaphysics when he should have been at Greek and
took at last a paltry degree Almost at the same time the London house
was disastrously wound up Mr Herrick must begin the world again as
a clerk in a strange office and Robert relinquish his ambitions and
accept with gratitude a career that he detested and despised He had
no head for figures no interest in affairs detested the constraint of
hours and despised the aims and the success of merchants To grow rich
was none of his ambitions rather to do well A worse or a more bold
young man would have refused the destiny perhaps tried his future with
his pen perhaps enlisted Robert more prudent possibly more timid
consented to embrace that way of life in which he could most readily
assist his family But he did so with a mind divided fled the
neighbourhood of former comrades and chose out of several positions
placed at his disposal a clerkship in New York

His career thenceforth was one of unbroken shame He did not drink
he was exactly honest he was never rude to his employers yet was
everywhere discharged Bringing no interest to his duties he brought
no attention his day was a tissue of things neglected and things done
amiss and from place to place and from town to town he carried the
character of one thoroughly incompetent No man can bear the word
applied to him without some flush of colour as indeed there is
none other that so emphatically slams in a mans face the door
of selfrespect And to Herrick who was conscious of talents and
acquirements who looked down upon those humble duties in which he was
found wanting the pain was the more exquisite Early in his fall he
had ceased to be able to make remittances shortly after having nothing
but failure to communicate he ceased writing home and about a year
before this tale begins turned suddenly upon the streets of San
Francisco by a vulgar and infuriated German Jew he had broken the last
bonds of selfrespect and upon a sudden Impulse changed his name and
invested his last dollar in a passage on the mail brigantine the City
of Papeete With what expectation he had trimmed his flight for the
South Seas Herrick perhaps scarcely knew Doubtless there were fortunes
to be made in pearl and copra doubtless others not more gifted than
himself had climbed in the island world to be queens consorts and
kings ministers But if Herrick had gone there with any manful purpose
he would have kept his fathers name the alias betrayed his moral
bankruptcy he had struck his flag he entertained no hope to reinstate
himself or help his straitened family and he came to the islands where
he knew the climate to be soft bread cheap and manners easy a skulker
from lifes battle and his own immediate duty Failure he had said was
his portion let it be a pleasant failure

It is fortunately not enough to say I will be base Herrick continued
in the islands his career of failure but in the new scene and under the
new name he suffered no less sharply than before A place was got it
was lost in the old style from the longsuffering of the keepers of
restaurants he fell to more open charity upon the wayside as time went
on good nature became weary and after a repulse or two Herrick became
shy There were women enough who would have supported a far worse and a
far uglier man Herrick never met or never knew them or if he did both
some manlier feeling would revolt and he preferred starvation Drenched
with rains broiling by day shivering by night a disused and ruinous
prison for a bedroom his diet begged or pilfered out of rubbish heaps
his associates two creatures equally outcast with himself he had
drained for months the cup of penitence He had known what it was to
be resigned what it was to break forth in a childish fury of rebellion
against fate and what it was to sink into the coma of despair The time
had changed him He told himself no longer tales of an easy and perhaps
agreeable declension he read his nature otherwise he had proved
himself incapable of rising and he now learned by experience that he
could not stoop to fall Something that was scarcely pride or strength
that was perhaps only refinement withheld him from capitulation but
he looked on upon his own misfortune with a growing rage and sometimes
wondered at his patience

It was now the fourth month completed and still there was no change
or sign of change The moon racing through a world of flying clouds
of every size and shape and density some black as ink stains some
delicate as lawn threw the marvel of her Southern brightness over the
same lovely and detested scene the island mountains crowned with the
perennial island cloud the embowered city studded with rare lamps the
masts in the harbour the smooth mirror of the lagoon and the mole of
the barrier reef on which the breakers whitened The moon shone too
with bullseye sweeps on his companions on the stalwart frame of the
American who called himself Brown and was known to be a master
mariner in some disgrace and on the dwarfish person the pale eyes
and toothless smile of a vulgar and badhearted cockney clerk Here was
society for Robert Herrick The Yankee skipper was a man at least he
had sterling qualities of tenderness and resolution he was one whose
hand you could take without a blush But there was no redeeming grace
about the other who called himself sometimes Hay and sometimes Tomkins
and laughed at the discrepancy who had been employed in every store in
Papeete for the creature was able in his way who had been discharged
from each in turn for he was wholly vile who had alienated all his old
employers so that they passed him in the street as if he were a dog and
all his old comrades so that they shunned him as they would a creditor

Not long before a ship from Peru had brought an influenza and it now
raged in the island and particularly in Papeete From all round the
purao arose and fell a dismal sound of men coughing and strangling
as they coughed The sick natives with the islanders impatience of a
touch of fever had crawled from their houses to be cool and squatting
on the shore or on the beached canoes painfully expected the new day
Even as the crowing of cocks goes about the country in the night from
farm to farm accesses of coughing arose and spread and died in
the distance and sprang up again Each miserable shiverer caught the
suggestion from his neighbour was torn for some minutes by that cruel
ecstasy and left spent and without voice or courage when it passed If
a man had pity to spend Papeete beach in that cold night and in that
infected season was a place to spend it on And of all the sufferers
perhaps the least deserving but surely the most pitiable was the
London clerk He was used to another life to houses beds nursing
and the dainties of the sickroom he lay there now in the cold open
exposed to the gusting of the wind and with an empty belly He was
besides infirm the disease shook him to the vitals and his companions
watched his endurance with surprise A profound commiseration filled
them and contended with and conquered their abhorrence The disgust
attendant on so ugly a sickness magnified this dislike at the same
time and with more than compensating strength shame for a sentiment so
inhuman bound them the more straitly to his service and even the evil
they knew of him swelled their solicitude for the thought of death is
always the least supportable when it draws near to the merely sensual
and selfish Sometimes they held him up sometimes with mistaken
helpfulness they beat him between the shoulders and when the poor
wretch lay back ghastly and spent after a paroxysm of coughing they
would sometimes peer into his face doubtfully exploring it for any
mark of life There is no one but has some virtue that of the clerk was
courage and he would make haste to reassure them in a pleasantry not
always decent

Im all right pals he gasped once this is the thing to strengthen
the muscles of the larynx

Well you take the cake cried the captain

O Im good plucked enough pursued the sufferer with a broken
utterance But it do seem bloomin hard to me that I should be the
only party down with this form of vice and the only one to do the funny
business I think one of you other parties might wake up Tell a fellow
something

The trouble is weve nothing to tell my son returned the captain

Ill tell you if you like what I was thinking said Herrick

Tell us anything said the clerk I only want to be reminded that I
aint dead

Herrick took up his parable lying on his face and speaking slowly and
scarce above his breath not like a man who has anything to say but
like one talking against time

Well I was thinking this he began I was thinking I lay on Papeete
beach one nightall moon and squalls and fellows coughingand I was
cold and hungry and down in the mouth and was about ninety years of
age and had spent two hundred and twenty of them on Papeete beach And
I was thinking I wished I had a ring to rub or had a fairy godmother
or could raise Beelzebub And I was trying to remember how you did it I
knew you made a ring of skulls for I had seen that in the Freischutz
and that you took off your coat and turned up your sleeves for I had
seen Formes do that when he was playing Kaspar and you could see by
the way he went about it it was a business he had studied and that you
ought to have something to kick up a smoke and a bad smell I dare say
a cigar might do and that you ought to say the Lords Prayer backwards
Well I wondered if I could do that it seemed rather a feat you see
And then I wondered if I would say it forward and I thought I did
Well no sooner had I got to WORLD WITHOUT END than I saw a man in a
pariu and with a mat under his arm come along the beach from the town
He was rather a hardfavoured old party and he limped and crippled and
all the time he kept coughing At first I didnt cotton to his looks
I thought and then I got sorry for the old soul because he coughed so
hard I remembered that we had some of that cough mixture the American
consul gave the captain for Hay It never did Hay a haporth of service
but I thought it might do the old gentlemans business for him and
stood up Yorana says I Yorana says he Look here I said
Ive got some firstrate stuff in a bottle itll fix your cough
savvy _Haere mai_ and Ill measure you a tablespoonful in the palm of my
hand for all our plate is at the bankers So I thought the old party
came up and the nearer he came the less I took to him But I had
passed my word you see

Wot is this bloomin drivel interrupted the clerk Its like the rot
there is in tracts

Its a story I used to tell them to the kids at home said Herrick
If it bores you Ill drop it

O cut along returned the sick man irritably Its better than
nothing

Well continued Herrick I had no sooner given him the cough mixture
than he seemed to straighten up and change and I saw he wasnt a
Tahitian after all but some kind of Arab and had a long beard on his
chin One good turn deserves another says he I am a magician out
of the Arabian Nights and this mat that I have under my arm is the
original carpet of Mohammed Ben Somebodyorother Say the word and you
can have a cruise upon the carpet You dont mean to say this is the
Travelling Carpet I cried You bet I do said he Youve been
to America since last I read the Arabian Nights said I a little
suspicious I should think so said he Been everywhere A man with a
carpet like this isnt going to moulder in a semidetached villa Well
that struck me as reasonable All right I said and do you mean to
tell me I can get on that carpet and go straight to London England I
said London England captain because he seemed to have been so long
in your part of the world In the crack of a whip said he I
figured up the time What is the difference between Papeete and London
captain

Taking Greenwich and Point Venus nine hours odd minutes and seconds
replied the mariner

Well thats about what I made it resumed Herrick about nine hours
Calling this three in the morning I made out I would drop into London
about noon and the idea tickled me immensely Theres only one
bother I said I havent a copper cent It would be a pity to go
to London and not buy the morning Standard O said he you dont
realise the conveniences of this carpet You see this pocket youve
only got to stick your hand in and you pull it out filled with
sovereigns

Doubleeagles wasnt iff inquired the captain

That was what it was cried Herrick I thought they seemed unusually
big and I remember now I had to go to the moneychangers at Charing
Cross and get English silver

O you went there said the clerk Wot did you do Bet you had a B
and S

Well you see it was just as the old boy saidlike the cut of a
whip said Herrick The one minute I was here on the beach at three in
the morning the next I was in front of the Golden Cross at midday
At first I was dazzled and covered my eyes and there didnt seem the
smallest change the roar of the Strand and the roar of the reef were
like the same hark to it now and you can hear the cabs and buses
rolling and the streets resound And then at last I could look about
and there was the old place and no mistake With the statues in
the square and St MartinsintheFields and the bobbies and the
sparrows and the hacks and I cant tell you what I felt like I felt
like crying I believe or dancing or jumping clean over the Nelson
Column I was like a fellow caught up out of Hell and flung down into
the dandiest part of Heaven Then I spotted for a hansom with a spanking
horse A shilling for yourself if youre there in twenty minutes
said I to the jarvey He went a good pace though of course it was a
trifle to the carpet and in nineteen minutes and a half I was at the
door

What door asked the captain

Oh a house I know of returned Herrick

But it was a publichouse cried the clerkonly these were not his
words And wy didnt you take the carpet there instead of trundling in
a growler

I didnt want to startle a quiet street said the narrator

Bad form And besides it was a hansom

Well and what did you do next inquired the captain

Oh I went in said Herrick

The old folks asked the captain

Thats about it said the other chewing a grass

Well I think you are about the poorest and at a yarn cried the
clerk Crikey its like Ministering Children I can tell you there
would be more beer and skittles about my little jaunt I would go and
have a B and S for luck Then I would get a big ulster with astrakhan
fur and take my cane and do the ladela down Piccadilly Then I would
go to a slapup restaurant and have green peas and a bottle of fizz
and a chump chopOh and I forgot Id ave some devilled whitebait
firstand green gooseberry tart and ot coffee and some of that form
of vice in big bottles with a sealBenedictinethats the bloomin
nyme Then Id drop into a theatre and pal on with some chappies
and do the dancing rooms and bars and that and wouldnt go ome
till morning till daylight doth appear And the next day Id have
watercresses am muffin and fresh butter wouldnt I just O my

The clerk was interrupted by a fresh attack of coughing

Well now Ill tell you what I would do said the captain I would
have none of your fancy rigs with the man driving from the mizzen
crosstrees but a plain foreandaft hack cab of the highest registered
tonnage First of all I would bring up at the market and get a turkey
and a suckingpig Then Id go to a wine merchants and get a dozen of
champagne and a dozen of some sweet wine rich and sticky and strong
something in the port or madeira line the best in the store Then Id
bear up for a toystore and lay out twenty dollars in assorted toys
for the piccaninnies and then to a confectioners and take in cakes and
pies and fancy bread and that stuff with the plums in it and then to
a newsagency and buy all the papers all the picture ones for the kids
and all the story papers for the old girl about the Earl discovering
himself to AnnaMariar and the escape of the Lady Maude from the private
madhouse and then Id tell the fellow to drive home

There ought to be some syrup for the kids suggested Herrick they
like syrup

Yes syrup for the kids red syrup at that said the captain And
those things they pull at and go pop and have measly poetry inside
And then I tell you wed have a thanksgiving day and Christmas tree
combined Great Scott but I would like to see the kids I guess they
would light right out of the house when they saw daddy driving up My
little Adar

The captain stopped sharply

Well keep it up said the clerk

The damned thing is I dont know if they aint starving cried the
captain

They cant be worse off than we are and thats one comfort returned
the clerk I defy the devil to make me worse off

It seemed as if the devil heard him The light of the moon had been
some time cut off and they had talked in darkness Now there was heard a
roar which drew impetuously nearer the face of the lagoon was seen to
whiten and before they had staggered to their feet a squall burst in
rain upon the outcasts The rage and volume of that avalanche one must
have lived in the tropics to conceive a man panted in its assault as
he might pant under a showerbath and the world seemed whelmed in night
and water

They fled groping for their usual shelterit might be almost called
their homein the old calaboose came drenched into its empty chambers
and lay down three sops of humanity on the cold coral floors and
presently when the squall was overpast the others could hear in the
darkness the chattering of the clerks teeth

I say you fellows he walled for Gods sake lie up and try to warm
me Im blymed if I dont think Ill die else

So the three crept together into one wet mass and lay until day came
shivering and dozing off and continually reawakened to wretchedness by
the coughing of the clerk



Chapter 2 MORNING ON THE BEACHTHE THREE LETTERS

The clouds were all fled the beauty of the tropic day was spread upon
Papeete and the wall of breaking seas upon the reef and the palms upon
the islet already trembled in the heat A French manofwar was going
out homeward bound she lay in the middle distance of the port an ant
heap for activity In the night a schooner had come in and now lay far
out hard by the passage and the yellow flag the emblem of pestilence
flew on her From up the coast a long procession of canoes headed
round the point and towards the market bright as a scarf with the
manycoloured clothing of the natives and the piles of fruit But not
even the beauty and the welcome warmth of the morning not even these
naval movements so interesting to sailors and to idlers could engage
the attention of the outcasts They were still cold at heart their
mouths sour from the want of steep their steps rambling from the
lack of food and they strung like lame geese along the beach in a
disheartened silence It was towards the town they moved towards the
town whence smoke arose where happier folk were breakfasting and as
they went their hungry eyes were upon all sides but they were only
scouting for a meal

A small and dingy schooner lay snug against the quay with which it was
connected by a plank On the forward deck under a spot of awning five
Kanakas who made up the crew were squatted round a basin of fried feis
and drinking coffee from tin mugs

Eight bells knock off for breakfast cried the captain with a
miserable heartiness Never tried this craft before positively my
first appearance guess Ill draw a bumper house

He came close up to where the plank rested on the grassy quay turned
his back upon the schooner and began to whistle that lively air The
Irish Washerwoman It caught the ears of the Kanaka seamen like a
preconcerted signal with one accord they looked up from their meal and
crowded to the ships side fei in hand and munching as they looked
Even as a poor brown Pyrenean bear dances in the streets of English
towns under his masters baton even so but with how much more
of spirit and precision the captain footed it in time to his own
whistling and his long morning shadow capered beyond him on the grass
The Kanakas smiled on the performance Herrick looked on heavyeyed
hunger for the moment conquering all sense of shame and a little
farther off but still hard by the clerk was torn by the seven devils
of the influenza

The captain stopped suddenly appeared to perceive his audience for the
first time and represented the part of a man surprised in his private
hour of pleasure

Hello said he

The Kanakas clapped hands and called upon him to go on

No SIR said the captain No eat no dance Savvy

Poor old man returned one of the crew Him no eat

Lord no said the captain Likeum too much eat No got

All right Me got said the sailor you tome here Plenty toffee
plenty fei Nutha man him tome too

I guess well drop right in observed the captain and he and his
companions hastened up the plank They were welcomed on board with the
shaking of hands place was made for them about the basin a sticky
demijohn of molasses was added to the feast in honour of company and
an accordion brought from the forecastle and significantly laid by the
performers side

Ariana said he lightly touching the instrument as he spoke and
he fell to on a long savoury fei made an end of it raised his mug of
coffee and nodded across at the spokesman of the crew Heres your
health old man youre a credit to the South Pacific said he

With the unsightly greed of hounds they glutted themselves with the hot
food and coffee and even the clerk revived and the colour deepened in
his eyes The kettle was drained the basin cleaned their entertainers
who had waited on their wants throughout with the pleased hospitality of
Polynesians made haste to bring forward a dessert of island tobacco and
rolls of pandanus leaf to serve as paper and presently all sat about
the dishes puffing like Indian Sachems

When a man as breakfast every day he dont know what it is observed
the clerk

The next point is dinner said Herrick and then with a passionate
utterance I wish to God I was a Kanaka

Theres one thing sure said the captain Im about desperate Id
rather hang than rot here much longer And with the word he took the
accordion and struck up Home sweet home

O drop that cried Herrick I cant stand that

No more can I said the captain Ive got to play something though
got to pay the shot my son And he struck up John Browns Body in
a fine sweet baritone Dandy Jim of Carolina came next Rorin the
Bold Swing low Sweet Chariot and The Beautiful Land followed
The captain was paying his shot with usury as he had done many a
time before many a meal had he bought with the same currency from the
melodiousminded natives always as now to their delight

He was in the middle of Fifteen Dollars in the Inside Pocket singing
with dogged energy for the task went sore against the grain when a
sensation was suddenly to be observed among the crew

Tapena Tom harry my said the spokesman pointing

And the three beachcombers following his indication saw the figure of
a man in pyjama trousers and a white jumper approaching briskly from the
town

Captain Tom is coming

Thats Tapena Tom is it said the captain pausing in his music I
dont seem to place the brute

Wed better cut said the clerk Es no good

Well said the musician deliberately one cant most generally always
tell Ill try it on I guess Music has charms to soothe the savage
Tapena boys We might strike it rich it might amount to iced punch in
the cabin

Hiced punch O my said the clerk Give him something ot captain
Way down the Swannee River try that

No sir Looks Scotch said the captain and he struck for his life
into Auld Lang Syne

Captain Tom continued to approach with the same businesslike alacrity
no change was to be perceived in his bearded face as he came swinging up
the plank he did not even turn his eyes on the performer

 We twa hae paidled in the burn
 Frae morning tide till dine

went the song

Captain Tom had a parcel under his arm which he laid on the house roof
and then turning suddenly to the strangers Here you he bellowed
be off out of that

The clerk and Herrick stood not on the order of their going but fled
incontinently by the plank The performer on the other hand flung down
the instrument and rose to his full height slowly

Whats that you say he said Ive half a mind to give you a lesson
in civility

You set up any more of your gab to me returned the Scotsman and
Ill show ye the wrong side of a jyle Ive heard tell of the three
of ye Yere not long for here I can tell ye that The Government has
their eyes upon ye They make short work of damned beachcombers Ill
say that for the French

You wait till I catch you off your ship cried the captain and
then turning to the crew Goodbye you fellows he said Youre
gentlemen anyway The worst nigger among you would look better upon a
quarterdeck than that filthy Scotchman

Captain Tom scorned to reply he watched with a hard smile the departure
of his guests and as soon as the last foot was off the plank turned to
the hands to work cargo

The beachcombers beat their inglorious retreat along the shore Herrick
first his face dark with blood his knees trembling under him with
the hysteria of rage Presently under the same purao where they had
shivered the night before he cast himself down and groaned aloud and
ground his face into the sand

Dont speak to me dont speak to me I cant stand it broke from
him

The other two stood over him perplexed

Wot cant he stand now said the clerk Asnt he ad a meal IM
lickin my lips

Herrick reared up his wild eyes and burning face I cant beg he
screamed and again threw himself prone

This things got to come to an end said the captain with an intake of
the breath

Looks like signs of an end dont it sneered the clerk

Hes not so far from it and dont you deceive yourself replied the
captain Well he added in a livelier voice you fellows hang on
here and Ill go and interview my representative

Whereupon he turned on his heel and set off at a swinging sailors walk
towards Papeete

It was some half hour later when he returned The clerk was dozing with
his back against the tree Herrick still lay where he had flung himself
nothing showed whether he slept or waked

See boys cried the captain with that artificial heartiness of his
which was at times so painful heres a new idea And he produced note
paper stamped envelopes and pencils three of each We can all write
home by the mail brigantine the consul says I can come over to his
place and ink up the addresses

Well thats a start too said the clerk I never thought of that

It was that yarning last night about going home that put me up to it
said the captain

Well and over said the clerk Ill ave a shy and he retired a
little distance to the shade of a canoe

The others remained under the purao Now they would write a word or two
now scribble it out now they would sit biting at the pencil end and
staring seaward now their eyes would rest on the clerk where he sat
propped on the canoe leering and coughing his pencil racing glibly on
the paper

I cant do it said Herrick suddenly I havent got the heart

See here said the captain speaking with unwonted gravity it may be
hard to write and to write lies at that and God knows it is but its
the square thing It dont cost anything to say youre well and happy
and sorry you cant make a remittance this mail and if you dont Ill
tell you what I think it isI think its about the highwater mark of
being a brute beast

Its easy to talk said Herrick You dont seem to have written much
yourself I notice

What do you bring in me for broke from the captain His voice was
indeed scarce raised above a whisper but emotion clanged in it What
do you know about me If you had commanded the finest barque that ever
sailed from Portland if you had been drunk in your berth when she
struck the breakers in Fourteen Island Group and hadnt had the wit to
stay there and drown but came on deck and given drunken orders and
lost six livesI could understand your talking then There he said
more quietly thats my yarn and now you know it Its a pretty one
for the father of a family Five men and a woman murdered Yes there
was a woman on board and hadnt no business to be either Guess I sent
her to Hell if there is such a place I never dared go home again and
the wife and the little ones went to England to her fathers place I
dont know whats come to them he added with a bitter shrug

Thank you captain said Herrick I never liked you better

They shook hands short and hard with eyes averted tenderness swelling
in their bosoms

Now boys to work again at lying said the captain

Ill give my father up returned Herrick with a writhen smile Ill
try my sweetheart instead for a change of evils

And here is what he wrote

Emma I have scratched out the beginning to my father for I think I
can write more easily to you This is my last farewell to all the last
you will ever hear or see of an unworthy friend and son I have failed
in life I am quite broken down and disgraced I pass under a false
name you will have to tell my father that with all your kindness It is
my own fault I know had I chosen that I might have done well and yet
I swear to you I tried to choose I could not bear that you should think
I did not try For I loved you all you must never doubt me in that
you least of all I have always unceasingly loved but what was my love
worth and what was I worth I had not the manhood of a common clerk
I could not work to earn you I have lost you now and for your sake I
could be glad of it When you first came to my fathers housedo you
remember those days I want you toyou saw the best of me then all
that was good in me Do you remember the day I took your hand and would
not let it goand the day on Battersea Bridge when we were looking at
a barge and I began to tell you one of my silly stories and broke off
to say I loved you That was the beginning and now here is the end
When you have read this letter you will go round and kiss them all
goodbye my father and mother and the children one by one and poor
uncle And tell them all to forget me and forget me yourself Turn
the key in the door let no thought of me return be done with the poor
ghost that pretended he was a man and stole your love Scorn of myself
grinds in me as I write I should tell you I am well and happy and want
for nothing I do not exactly make money or I should send a remittance
but I am well cared for have friends live in a beautiful place and
climate such as we have dreamed of together and no pity need be wasted
on me In such places you understand it is easy to live and live
well but often hard to make sixpence in money Explain this to my
father he will understand I have no more to say only linger going
out like an unwilling guest God in heaven bless you Think of me to
the last here on a bright beach the sky and sea immoderately blue
and the great breakers roaring outside on a barrier reef where a little
isle sits green with palms I am well and strong It is a more pleasant
way to die than if you were crowding about me on a sickbed And yet I
am dying This is my last kiss Forgive forget the unworthy

So far he had written his paper was all filled when there returned a
memory of evenings at the piano and that song the masterpiece of love
in which so many have found the expression of their dearest thoughts
Einst O wunder he added More was not required he knew that in his
loves heart the context would spring up escorted with fair images and
harmony of how all through life her name should tremble in his ears
her name be everywhere repeated in the sounds of nature and when death
came and he lay dissolved her memory lingered and thrilled among his
elements

 Once O wonder once from the ashes of my heart
 Arose a blossom

Herrick and the captain finished their letters about the same time each
was breathing deep and their eyes met and were averted as they closed
the envelopes

Sorry I write so big said the captain gruffly Came all of a rush
when it did come

Same here said Herrick I could have done with a ream when I got
started but its long enough for all the good I had to say

They were still at the addresses when the clerk strolled up smirking
and twirling his envelope like a man well pleased He looked over
Herricks shoulder

Hullo he said you aint writing ome

I am though said Herrick she lives with my father Oh I see what
you mean he added My real name is Herrick No more Haythey had
both used the same aliasno more Hay than yours I dare say

Clean bowled in the middle stump laughed the clerk My names Uish
if you want to know Everybody has a false nyme in the Pacific Lay you
five to three the captain as

So I have too replied the captain and Ive never told my own since
the day I tore the title page out of my Bowditch and flung the damned
thing into the sea But Ill tell it to you boys John Davis is my
name Im Davis of the Sea Ranger

Dooce you are said Hush And what was she a pirate or a slyver

She was the fastest barque out of Portland Maine replied the
captain and for the way I lost her I might as well have bored a hole
in her side with an auger

Oh you lost her did you said the clerk Ope she was insured

No answer being returned to this sally Huish still brimming over with
vanity and conversation struck into another subject

Ive a good mind to read you my letter said he Ive a good fist
with a pen when I choose and this is a prime lark She was a barmaid
I ran across in Northampton she was a spanking fine piece no end
of style and we cottoned at first sight like parties in the play I
suppose I spent the chynge of a fiver on that girl Well I appened to
remember her nyme so I wrote to her and told her ow I had got rich
and married a queen in the Hislands and lived in a blooming palace
Such a sight of crammers I must read you one bit about my opening the
nigger parliament in a cocked at Its really prime

The captain jumped to his feet Thats what you did with the paper that
I went and begged for you he roared

It was perhaps lucky for Huishit was surely in the end unfortunate for
allthat he was seized just then by one of his prostrating accesses of
cough his comrades would have else deserted him so bitter was their
resentment When the fit had passed the clerk reached out his hand
picked up the letter which had fallen to the earth and tore it into
fragments stamp and all

Does that satisfy you he asked sullenly

Well say no more about it replied Davis



Chapter 3 THE OLD CALABOOSEDESTINY AT THE DOOR

The old calaboose in which the waifs had so long harboured is a low
rectangular enclosure of building at the corner of a shady western
avenue and a little townward of the British consulate Within was
a grassy court littered with wreckage and the traces of vagrant
occupation Six or seven cells opened from the court the doors that
had once been locked on mutinous whalermen rotting before them in the
grass No mark remained of their old destination except the rusty bars
upon the windows

The floor of one of the cells had been a little cleared a bucket the
last remaining piece of furniture of the three caitiffs stood full of
water by the door a half cocoanut shell beside it for a drinking cup
and on some ragged ends of mat Huish sprawled asleep his mouth open
his face deathly The glow of the tropic afternoon the green of
sunbright foliage stared into that shady place through door and window
and Herrick pacing to and fro on the coral floor sometimes paused
and laved his face and neck with tepid water from the bucket His long
arrears of suffering the nights vigil the insults of the morning and
the harrowing business of the letter had strung him to that point when
pain is almost pleasure time shrinks to a mere point and death and
life appear indifferent To and fro he paced like a caged brute his
mind whirling through the universe of thought and memory his eyes as
he went skimming the legends on the wall The crumbling whitewash was
all full of them Tahitian names and French and English and rude
sketches of ships under sail and men at fisticuffs

It came to him of a sudden that he too must leave upon these walls the
memorial of his passage He paused before a clean space took the pencil
out and pondered Vanity so hard to dislodge awoke in him We call it
vanity at least perhaps unjustly Rather it was the bare sense of his
existence prompted him the sense of his life the one thing wonderful
to which he scarce clung with a finger From his jarred nerves there
came a strong sentiment of coming change whether good or ill he could
not say change he knew no morechange with inscrutable veiled face
approaching noiseless With the feeling came the vision of a concert
room the rich hues of instruments the silent audience and the loud
voice of the symphony Destiny knocking at the door he thought drew
a stave on the plaster and wrote in the famous phrase from the Fifth
Symphony So thought he they will know that I loved music and had
classical tastes They He I suppose the unknown kindred spirit that
shall come some day and read my memor querela Ha he shall have Latin
too And he added terque quaterque beati Queis ante ora patrum

He turned again to his uneasy pacing but now with an irrational and
supporting sense of duty done He had dug his grave that morning now he
had carved his epitaph the folds of the toga were composed why should
he delay the insignificant trifle that remained to do He paused and
looked long in the face of the sleeping Huish drinking disenchantment
and distaste of life He nauseated himself with that vile countenance
Could the thing continue What bound him now Had he no rightsonly
the obligation to go on without discharge or furlough bearing the
unbearable Ich trage unertragliches the quotation rose in his mind he
repeated the whole piece one of the most perfect of the most perfect of
poets and a phrase struck him like a blow Du stolzes Herz A hast
es ja gewolit Where was the pride of his heart And he raged against
himself as a man bites on a sore tooth in a heady sensuality of scorn
I have no pride I have no heart no manhood he thought or why
should I prolong a life more shameful than the gallows Or why should I
have fallen to it No pride no capacity no force Not even a bandit
and to be starving here with worse than bandittiwith this trivial
hellhound His rage against his comrade rose and flooded him and he
shook a trembling fist at the sleeper

A swift step was audible The captain appeared upon the threshold of the
cell panting and flushed and with a foolish face of happiness In his
arms he carried a loaf of bread and bottles of beer the pockets of his
coat were bulging with cigars

He rolled his treasures on the floor grasped Herrick by both hands and
crowed with laughter

Broach the beer he shouted Broach the beer and glory hallelujah

Beer repeated Huish struggling to his feet Beer it is cried
Davis Beer and plenty of it Any number of persons can use it like
Lyons toothtablet with perfect propriety and neatness Whos to
officiate

Leave me alone for that said the clerk He knocked the necks off with
a lump of coral and each drank in succession from the shell

Have a weed said Davis Its all in the bill

What is up asked Herrick

The captain fell suddenly grave Im coming to that said he I want
to speak with Herrick here You Hayor Huish or whatever your name
isyou take a weed and the other bottle and go and see how the wind is
down by the purao Ill call you when youre wanted

Hay Secrets That aint the ticket said Huish

Look here my son said the captain this is business and dont you
make any mistake about it If youre going to make trouble you can
have it your own way and stop right here Only get the thing right if
Herrick and I go we take the beer Savvy

Oh I dont want to shove my oar in returned Huish Ill cut right
enough Give me the swipes You can jaw till youre blue in the face for
what I care I dont think its the friendly touch thats all And he
shambled grumbling out of the cell into the staring sun

The captain watched him clear of the courtyard then turned to Herrick

What is it asked Herrick thickly

Ill tell you said Davis I want to consult you Its a chance weve
got Whats that he cried pointing to the music on the wall

What said the other Oh that Its music its a phrase of
Beethovens I was writing up It means Destiny knocking at the door

Does it said the captain rather low and he went near and studied
the inscription and this French he asked pointing to the Latin

O it just means I should have been luckier if I had died at horne
returned Herrick impatiently What is this business

Destiny knocking at the door repeated the captain and then looking
over his shoulder Well Mr Herrick thats about what it comes to he
added

What do you mean Explain yourself said Herrick

But the captain was again staring at the music About how long ago
since you wrote up this truck he asked

What does it matter exclaimed Herrick I dare say half an hour

My God its strange cried Davis Theres some men would call that
accidental not me That and he drew his thick finger under the
musicthats what I call Providence

You said we had a chance said Herrick

Yes SIR said the captain wheeling suddenly face to face with
his companion I did so If youre the man I take you for we have a
chance

I dont know what you take me for was the reply You can scarce take
me too low

Shake hands Mr Herrick said the captain I know you Youre a
gentleman and a man of spirit I didnt want to speak before that bummer
there youll see why But to you Ill rip it right out I got a ship

A ship cried Herrick What ship

That schooner we saw this morning off the passage

The schooner with the hospital flag

Thats the hooker said Davis Shes the Farallone hundred and
sixty tons register out of Frisco for Sydney in California champagne
Captain mate and one hand all died of the smallpox same as they had
round in the Paumotus I guess Captain and mate were the only white
men all the hands Kanakas seems a queer kind of outfit from a
Christian port Three of them left and a cook didnt know where they
were I cant think where they were either if you come to that
Wiseman must have been on the booze I guess to sail the course he did
However there HE was dead and here are the Kanakas as good as lost
They bummed around at sea like the babes in the wood and tumbled
endon upon Tahiti The consul here took charge He offered the berth to
Williams Williams had never had the smallpox and backed down That was
when I came in for the letter paper I thought there was something up
when the consul asked me to look in again but I never let on to you
fellows sos youd not be disappointed Consul tried MNeil scared of
smallpox He tried Capirati that Corsican and Leblue or whatever his
name is wouldnt lay a hand on it all too fond of their sweet lives
Last of all when there wasnt nobody else left to offer it to he
offers it to me Brown will you ship captain and take her to Sydney
says he Let me choose my own mate and another white hand says I
for I dont hold with this Kanaka crew racket give us all two months
advance to get our clothes and instruments out of pawn and Ill take
stock tonight fill up stores and get to sea tomorrow before dark
Thats what I said Thats good enough says the consul and you
can count yourself damned lucky Brown says he And he said it pretty
meaningfulappearing too However thats all one now Ill ship Huish
before the mastof course Ill let him berth aftand Ill ship you
mate at seventyfive dollars and two months advance

Me mate Why Im a landsman cried Herrick

Guess youve got to learn said the captain You dont fancy Im
going to skip and leave you rotting on the beach perhaps Im not that
sort old man And youre handy anyway Ive been shipmates with worse

God knows I cant refuse said Herrick God knows I thank you from my
heart

Thats all right said the captain But it aint all He turned
aside to light a cigar

What else is there asked the other with a pang of undefinable alarm

Im coming to that said Davis and then paused a little See here
he began holding out his cigar between his finger and thumb suppose
you figure up what thisll amount to You dont catch on Well we
get two months advance we cant get away from Papeeteour creditors
wouldnt let us gofor less itll take us along about two months
to get to Sydney and when we get there I just want to put it to you
squarely What the better are we

Were off the beach at least said Herrick

I guess theres a beach at Sydney returned the captain and Ill
tell you one thing Mr HerrickI dont mean to try No SIR Sydney
will never see me

Speak out plain said Herrick

Plain Dutch replied the captain Im going to own that schooner
Its nothing new its done every year in the Pacific Stephens stole a
schooner the other day didnt he Hayes and Pease stole vessels all
the time And its the making of the crowd of us See hereyou think of
that cargo Champagne why its like as if it was put up on purpose In
Peru well sell that liquor off at the pierhead and the schooner after
it if we can find a fool to buy her and then light out for the mines
If youll back me up I stake my life I carry it through

Captain said Herrick with a quailing voice dont do it

Im desperate returned Davis Ive got a chance I may never get
another Herrick say the word back me up I think weve starved
together long enough for that

I cant do it Im sorry I cant do it Ive not fallen as low as
that said Herrick deadly pale

What did you say this morning said Davis That you couldnt beg
Its the one thing or the other my son

Ah but this is the jail cried Herrick Dont tempt me Its the
jail

Did you hear what the skipper said on board that schooner pursued the
captain Well I tell you he talked straight The French have let us
alone for a long time It cant last longer theyve got their eye on
us and as sure as you live in three weeks youll be in jail whatever
you do I read it in the consuls face

You forget captain said the young man There is another way I can
die and to say truth I think I should have died three years ago

The captain folded his arms and looked the other in the face Yes
said he yes you can cut your throat thats a frozen fact much good
may it do you And where do I come in

The light of a strange excitement came in Herricks face Both of us
said he both of us together Its not possible you can enjoy this
business Come and he reached out a timid hand a few strokes in the
lagoonand rest

I tell you Herrick Im most tempted to answer you the way the man
does in the Bible and say Get thee behind me Satan said the
captain What you think I would go drown myself and I got children
starving Enjoy it No by God I do not enjoy it but its the row
Ive got to hoe and Ill hoe it till I drop right here I have three of
them you see two boys and the one girl Adar The trouble is that you
are not a parent yourself I tell you Herrick I love you the man
broke out I didnt take to you at first you were so anglified and
tony but I love you now its a man that loves you stands here and
wrestles with you I cant go to sea with the bummer alone its not
possible Go drown yourself and there goes my last chancethe last
chance of a poor miserable beast earning a crust to feed his family
I cant do nothing but sail ships and Ive no papers And here I get
a chance and you go back on me Ah youve no family and thats where
the trouble is

I have indeed said Herrick

Yes I know said the captain you think so But no mans got
a family till hes got children Its only the kids count Theres
something about the little shavers I cant talk of them And if
you thought a cent about this father that I hear you talk of or that
sweetheart you were writing to this morning you would feel like me You
would say What matters laws and God and that My folks are hard up
I belong to them Ill get them bread or by God Ill get them wealth
if I have to burn down London for it Thats what you would say And
Ill tell you more your heart is saying so this living minute I can
see it in your face Youre thinking Heres poor friendship for the man
Ive starved along of and as for the girl that I set up to be in love
with heres a mighty limp kind of a love that wont carry me as far
as most any man would go for a demijohn of whisky Theres not much
ROmance to that love anyway its not the kind they carry on about in
songbooks But whats the good of my carrying on talking when its all
in your inside as plain as print I put the question to you once for
all Are you going to desert me in my hour of needyou know if Ive
deserted youor will you give me your hand and try a fresh deal and
go home as like as not a millionaire Say no and God pity me Say
yes and Ill make the little ones pray for you every night on their
bended knees God bless Mr Herrick thats what theyll say one after
the other the old girl sitting there holding stakes at the foot of the
bed and the damned little innocents  He broke off I dont often
rip out about the kids he said but when I do theres something
fetches loose

Captain said Herrick faintly is there nothing else

Ill prophesy if you like said the captain with renewed vigour
Refuse this because you think yourself too honest and before a
months out youll be jailed for a sneakthief I give you the word
fair I can see it Herrick if you cant youre breaking down
Dont think if you refuse this chance that youll go on doing the
evangelical youre about through with your stock and before you know
where you are youll be right out on the other side No its either
this for you or else its Caledonia I bet you never were there and
saw those white shaved men in their dust clothes and straw hats
prowling around in gangs in the lamplight at Noumea they look like
wolves and they look like preachers and they look like the sick Hulsh
is a daisy to the best of them Well theres your company Theyre
waiting for you Herrick and you got to go and thats a prophecy

And as the man stood and shook through his great stature he seemed
indeed like one in whom the spirit of divination worked and might utter
oracles Herrick looked at him and looked away It seemed not decent to
spy upon such agitation and the young mans courage sank

You talk of going home he objected We could never do that

WE could said the other Captain Brown couldnt nor Mr Hay that
shipped mate with him couldnt But whats that to do with Captain Davis
or Mr Herrick you galoot

But Hayes had these wild islands where he used to call came the next
fainter objection

We have the wild islands of Peru retorted Davis They were wild
enough for Stephens no longer agone than just last year I guess
theyll be wild enough for us

And the crew

All Kanakas Come I see youre right old man I see youll stand by
And the captain once more offered his hand

Have it your own way then said Herrick Ill do it a strange thing
for my fathers son But Ill do it Ill stand by you man for good or
evil

God bless you cried the captain and stood silent Herrick he
added with a smile I believe Id have died in my tracks if youd
said No

And Herrick looking at the man half believed so also

And now well go break it to the bummer said Davis

I wonder how hell take it said Herrick

Him Jump at it was the reply



Chapter 4 THE YELLOW FLAG

The schooner Farallone lay well out in the jaws of the pass where the
terrified pilot had made haste to bring her to her moorings and escape
Seen from the beach through the thin line of shipping two objects stood
conspicuous to seaward the little isle on the one hand with its palms
and the guns and batteries raised forty years before in defence of Queen
Pomares capital the outcast Farallone upon the other banished to the
threshold of the port rolling there to her scuppers and flaunting the
plagueflag as she rolled A few sea birds screamed and cried about the
ship and within easy range a manofwar guard boat hung off and on and
glittered with the weapons of marines The exuberant daylight and the
blinding heaven of the tropics picked out and framed the pictures

A neat boat manned by natives in uniform and steered by the doctor
of the port put from shore towards three of the afternoon and pulled
smartly for the schooner The foresheets were heaped with sacks of
flour onions and potatoes perched among which was Huish dressed as
a foremast hand a heap of chests and cases impeded the action of the
oarsmen and in the stern by the left hand of the doctor sat Herrick
dressed in a fresh rig of slops his brown beard trimmed to a point a
pile of paper novels on his lap and nursing the while between his feet
a chronometer for which they had exchanged that of the Farallone long
since run down and the rate lost

They passed the guard boat exchanging hails with the boatswains
mate in charge and drew near at last to the forbidden ship Not a cat
stirred there was no speech of man and the sea being exceeding high
outside and the reef close to where the schooner lay the clamour of
the surf hung round her like the sound of battle

Ohe la goelette sang out the doctor with his best voice

Instantly from the house where they had been stowing away stores first
Davis and then the ragamuffin swarthy crew made their appearance

Hullo Hay that you said the captain leaning on the rail Tell the
old man to lay her alongside as if she was eggs Theres a hell of a
run of sea here and his boats brittle

The movement of the schooner was at that time more than usually violent
Now she heaved her side as high as a deep sea steamers and showed the
flashing of her copper now she swung swiftly toward the boat until her
scuppers gurgled

I hope you have sea legs observed the doctor You will require
them

Indeed to board the Farallone in that exposed position where she lay
was an affair of some dexterity The less precious goods were hoisted
roughly in the chronometer after repeated failures was passed gently
and successfully from hand to hand and there remained only the more
difficult business of embarking Huish Even that piece of dead weight
shipped AB at eighteen dollars and described by the captain to the
consul as an invaluable man was at last hauled on board without mishap
and the doctor with civil salutations took his leave

The three coadventurers looked at each other and Davis heaved a breath
of relief

Now lets get this chronometer fixed said he and led the way
into the house It was a fairly spacious place two staterooms and a
goodsized pantry opened from the main cabin the bulkheads were
painted white the floor laid with waxcloth No litter no sign of
life remained for the effects of the dead men had been disinfected and
conveyed on shore Only on the table in a saucer some sulphur burned
and the fumes set them coughing as they entered The captain peered into
the starboard stateroom where the bedclothes still lay tumbled in
the bunk the blanket flung back as they had flung it back from the
disfigured corpse before its burial

Now I told these niggers to tumble that truck overboard grumbled
Davis Guess they were afraid to lay hands on it Well theyve hosed
the place out thats as much as can be expected I suppose Huish lay
on to these blankets

See you blooming well far enough first said Huish drawing back

Whats that snapped the captain Ill tell you my young friend I
think you make a mistake Im captain here

Fat lot I care returned the clerk

That so said Davis Then youll berth forward with the niggers Walk
right out of this cabin

Oh I dessay said Huish See any green in my eye A larks a lark

Well now Ill explain this business and youll see once for all
just precisely how much lark there is to it said Davis Im captain
and Im going to be it One thing of three First you take my orders
here as cabin steward in which case you mess with us Or second you
refuse and I pack you forwardand you get as quick as the words said
Or third and last Ill signal that manofwar and send you ashore
under arrest for mutiny

And of course I wouldnt blow the gaff O no replied the jeering
Huish

And whos to believe you my son inquired the captain No sir
There aint no lark about my captainising Enough said Up with these
blankets

Huish was no fool he knew when he was beaten and he was no coward
either for he stepped to the bunk took the infected bedclothes
fairly in his arms and carried them out of the house without a check or
tremor

I was waiting for the chance said Davis to Herrick I neednt do the
same with you because you understand it for yourself

Are you going to berth here asked Herrick following the captain into
the stateroom where he began to adjust the chronometer in its place at
the bedhead

Not much replied he I guess Ill berth on deck I dont know as Im
afraid but Ive no immediate use for confluent smallpox

I dont know that Im afraid either said Herrick But the thought of
these two men sticks in my throat that captain and mate dying here one
opposite to the other Its grim I wonder what they said last

Wiseman and Wishart said the captain Probably mighty small
potatoes Thats a thing a fellow figures out for himself one way and
the real business goes quite another Perhaps Wiseman said Here old
man fetch up the gin Im feeling powerful rocky And perhaps Wishart
said Oh hell

Well thats grim enough said Herrick

And so it is said Davis There theres that chronometer fixed And
now its about time to up anchor and clear out

He lit a cigar and stepped on deck

Here you Whats YOUR name he cried to one of the hands a
leanflanked cleanbuilt fellow from some far western island and of a
darkness almost approaching to the African

Sally Day replied the man

Devil it is said the captain Didnt know we had ladies on board
Well Sally oblige me by hauling down that rag there Ill do the same
for you another time He watched the yellow bunting as it was eased
past the crosstrees and handed down on deck Youll float no more
on this ship he observed Muster the people aft Mr Hay he added
speaking unnecessarily loud Ive a word to say to them

It was with a singular sensation that Herrick prepared for the first
time to address a crew He thanked his stars indeed that they were
natives But even natives he reflected might be critics too quick
for such a novice as himself they might perceive some lapse from that
precise and cutanddry English which prevails on board a ship it was
even possible they understood no other and he racked his brain and
overhauled his reminiscences of sea romance for some appropriate words

Here men tumble aft he said Lively now All hands aft

They crowded in the alleyway like sheep

Here they are sir said Herrick

For some time the captain continued to face the stern then turned with
ferocious suddenness on the crew and seemed to enjoy their shrinking

Now he said twisting his cigar in his mouth and toying with the
spokes of the wheel Im Captain Brown I command this ship This is
Mr Hay first officer The other white man is cabin steward but hell
stand watch and do his trick My orders shall be obeyed smartly You
savvy smartly There shall be no growling about the kaikai which
will be above allowance Youll put a handle to the mates name and
tack on sir to every order I give you If youre smart and quick Ill
make this ship comfortable for all hands He took the cigar out of his
mouth If youre not he added in a roaring voice Ill make it a
floating hell Now Mr Hay well pick watches if you please

All right said Herrick

You will please use sir when you address me Mr Hay said the
captain Ill take the lady Step to starboard Sally And then he
whispered in Herricks ear take the old man

Ill take you there said Herrick

Whats your name said the captain Whats that you say Oh thats
no English Ill have none of your highway gibberish on my ship Well
call you old Uncle Ned because youve got no wool on the top of your
head just the place where the wool ought to grow Step to port Uncle
Dont you hear Mr Hay has picked you Then Ill take the white man
White Man step to starboard Now which of you two is the cook You
Then Mr Hay takes your friend in the blue dungaree Step to port
Dungaree There we know who we all are Dungaree Uncle Ned Sally Day
White Man and Cook All FFVs I guess And now Mr Hay well up
anchor if you please

For Heavens sake tell me some of the words whispered Herrick

An hour later the Farallone was under all plain sail the rudder hard
aport and the cheerfully clanking windlass had brought the anchor
home

All clear sir cried Herrick from the bow

The captain met her with the wheel as she bounded like a stag from
her repose trembling and bending to the puffs The guard boat gave a
parting hail the wake whitened and ran out the Farallone was under
weigh

Her berth had been close to the pass Even as she forged ahead Davis
slewed her for the channel between the pier ends of the reef the
breakers sounding and whitening to either hand Straight through the
narrow band of blue she shot to seaward and the captains heart
exulted as he felt her tremble underfoot and looking back over the
taffrail beheld the roofs of Papeete changing position on the shore and
the island mountains rearing higher in the wake

But they were not yet done with the shore and the horror of the yellow
flag About midway of the pass there was a cry and a scurry a man was
seen to leap upon the rail and throwing his arms over his head to
stoop and plunge into the sea

Steady as she goes the captain cried relinquishing the wheel to
Huish

The next moment he was forward in the midst of the Kanakas belaying pin
in hand

Anybody else for shore he cried and the savage trumpeting of his
voice no less than the ready weapon in his hand struck fear in all
Stupidly they stared after their escaped companion whose black head
was visible upon the water steering for the land And the schooner
meanwhile slipt like a racer through the pass and met the long sea of
the open ocean with a souse of spray

Fool that I was not to have a pistol ready exclaimed Davis Well
we go to sea shorthanded we cant help that You have a lame watch of
it Mr Hay

I dont see how we are to get along said Herrick

Got to said the captain No more Tahiti for me

Both turned instinctively and looked astern The fair island was
unfolding mountain top on mountain top Eimeo on the port board lifted
her splintered pinnacles and still the schooner raced to the open sea

Think cried the captain with a gesture yesterday morning I danced
for my breakfast like a poodle dog



Chapter 5 THE CARGO OF CHAMPAGNE

The ships head was laid to clear Eimeo to the north and the captain
sat down in the cabin with a chart a ruler and an epitome

East a half nothe said he raising his face from his labours Mr
Hay youll have to watch your dead reckoning I want every yard she
makes on every hairsbreadth of a course Im going to knock a hole
right straight through the Paumotus and thats always a near touch
Now if this South East Trade ever blew out of the SE which it dont
we might hope to lie within half a point of our course Say we lie
within a point of it Thatll just about weather Fakarava Yes sir
thats what weve got to do if we tack for it Brings us through this
slush of little islands in the cleanest place see And he showed
where his ruler intersected the widelying labyrinth of the Dangerous
Archipelago I wish it was night and I could put her about right now
were losing time and easting Well well do our best And if we dont
fetch Peru well bring up to Ecuador All one I guess Depreciated
dollars down and no questions asked A remarkable fine institootion
the South American don

Tahiti was already some way astern the Diadem rising from among broken
mountainsEimeo was already close aboard and stood black and strange
against the golden splendour of the westwhen the captain took his
departure from the two islands and the patent log was set

Some twenty minutes later Sally Day who was continually leaving
the wheel to peer in at the cabin clock announced in a shrill cry
Fobell and the cook was to be seen carrying the soup into the cabin

I guess Ill sit down and have a pick with you said Davis to Herrick
By the time Ive done itll be dark and well clap the hooker on the
wind for South America

In the cabin at one corner of the table immediately below the lamp and
on the lee side of a bottle of champagne sat Huish Whats this Where
did that come from asked the captain

Its fizz and it came from the afterold if you want to know said
Huish and drained his mug

Thisll never do exclaimed Davis the merchant seamans horror of
breaking into cargo showing incongruously forth on board that stolen
ship There was never any good came of games like that

You byby said Huish A fellow would think to ear him we were
on the square And look ere youve put this job up ansomely for me
avent you Im to go on deck and steer while you two sit and guzzle
and Im to go by nickname and got to call you sir and mister Well
you look here my bloke Ill have fizz ad lib or it wont wash I
tell you that And you know mighty well you aint got any manofwar to
signal now

Davis was staggered Id give fifty dollars this had never happened
he said weakly

Well it as appened you see returned Huish Try some its
devilish good

The Rubicon was crossed without another struggle The captain filled a
mug and drank

I wish it was beer he said with a sigh But theres no denying its
the genuine stuff and cheap at the money Now Huish you clear out and
take your wheel

The little wretch had gained a point and he was gay Ay ay sir
said he and left the others to their meal

Pea soup exclaimed the captain Blamed if I thought I should taste
pea soup again

Herrick sat inert and silent It was impossible after these months of
hopeless want to smell the rough highspiced sea victuals without
lust and his mouth watered with desire of the champagne It was no less
impossible to have assisted at the scene between Huish and the captain
and not to perceive with sudden bluntness the gulf where he had
fallen He was a thief among thieves He said it to himself He could
not touch the soup If he had moved at all it must have been to leave
the table throw himself overboard and drownan honest man

Here said the captain you look sick old man have a drop of this

The champagne creamed and bubbled in the mug its bright colour its
lively effervescence seized his eye It is too late to hesitate
he thought his hand took the mug instinctively he drank with
unquenchable pleasure and desire of more drained the vessel dry and
set it down with sparkling eyes

There is something in life after all he cried I had forgot what it
was like Yes even this is worth while Wine food dry clotheswhy
theyre worth dying worth hanging for Captain tell me one thing why
arent all the poor folk footpads

Give it up said the captain

They must be damned good cried Herrick Theres something here
beyond me Think of that calaboose Suppose we were sent suddenly back
He shuddered as though stung by a convulsion and buried his face in his
clutching hands

Here whats wrong with you cried the captain There was no reply
only Herricks shoulders heaved so that the table was shaken Take
some more of this Here drink this I order you to Dont start crying
when youre out of the wood

Im not crying said Herrick raising his face and showing his dry
eyes Its worse than crying Its the horror of that grave that weve
escaped from

Come now you tackle your soup thatll fix you said Davis kindly
I told you you were all broken up You couldnt have stood out another
week

Thats the dreadful part of it cried Herrick Another week and Id
have murdered someone for a dollar God and I know that And Im still
living Its some beastly dream

Quietly quietly Quietly does it my son Take your pea soup Food
thats what you want said Davis

The soup strengthened and quieted Herricks nerves another glass of
wine and a piece of pickled pork and fried banana completed what the
soup began and he was able once more to look the captain in the face

I didnt know I was so much run down he said

Well said Davis you were as steady as a rock all day now youve
had a little lunch youll be as steady as a rock again

Yeswas the reply Im steady enough now but Im a queer kind of a
first officer

Shucks cried the captain Youve only got to mind the ships course
and keep your slate to half a point A babby could do that let alone
a college graduate like you There aint nothing TO sailoring when you
come to look it in the face And now well go and put her about Bring
the slate well have to start our dead reckoning right away

The distance run since the departure was read off the log by the
binnacle light and entered on the slate

Ready about said the captain Give me the wheel White Man and you
stand by the mainsheet Boom tackle Mr Hay please and then you can
jump forward and attend head sails

Ay ay sir responded Herrick

All clear forward asked Davis

All clear sir

Hard alee cried the captain Haul in your slack as she comes he
called to Huish Haul in your slack put your back into it keep your
feet out of the coils A sudden blow sent Huish flat along the deck
and the captain was in his place Pick yourself up and keep the wheel
hard over he roared You wooden fool you wanted to get killed I
guess Draw the jib he cried a moment later and then to Huish Give
me the wheel again and see if you can coil that sheet

But Huish stood and looked at Davis with an evil countenance Do you
know you struck me said he

Do you know I saved your life returned the other not deigning to
look at him his eyes travelling instead between the compass and the
sails Where would you have been if that boom had swung out and
you bundled in the clack No SIR well have no more of you at the
mainsheet Seaport towns are full of mainsheetmen they hop upon one
leg my son whats left of them and the rest are dead Set your boom
tackle Mr Hay Struck you did I Lucky for you I did

Well said Huish slowly I daresay there may be somethink in that
Ope there is He turned his back elaborately on the captain and
entered the house where the speedy explosion of a champagne cork showed
he was attending to his comfort

Herrick came aft to the captain How is she doing now he asked

East and by nothe a half nothe said Davis Its about as good as I
expected

Whatll the hands think of it said Herrick

Oh they dont think They aint paid to says the captain

There was something wrong was there not between you and Herrick
paused

Thats a nasty little beast thats a biter replied the captain
shaking his head But so long as you and me hang in it dont matter

Herrick lay down in the weather alleyway the night was cloudless the
movement of the ship cradled him he was oppressed besides by the first
generous meal after so long a time of famine and he was recalled from
deep sleep by the voice of Davis singing out Eight bells

He rose stupidly and staggered aft where the captain gave him the
wheel

By the wind said the captain It comes a little puffy when you get
a heavy puff steal all you can to windward but keep her a good full

He stepped towards the house paused and hailed the forecastle

Got such a thing as a concertina forward said he Bully for you
Uncle Ned Fetch it aft will you

The schooner steered very easy and Herrick watching the moonwhitened
sails was overpowered by drowsiness A sharp report from the cabin
startled him a third bottle had been opened and Herrick remembered
the Sea Ranger and Fourteen Island Group Presently the notes of the
accordion sounded and then the captains voice

 O honey with our pockets full of money

 We will trip trip trip we will trip it on the quay

 And I will dance with Kate and Tom will dance with Sall

 When were all back from South Amerikee

So it went to its quaint air and the watch below lingered and listened
by the forward door and Uncle Ned was to be seen in the moonlight
nodding time and Herrick smiled at the wheel his anxieties a while
forgotten Song followed song another cork exploded there were voices
raised as though the pair in the cabin were in disagreement and
presently it seemed the breach was healed for it was now the voice of
Huish that struck up to the captains accompaniment


 Up in a balloon boys

 Up in a balloon

 All among the little stars

 And round about the moon


A wave of nausea overcame Herrick at the wheel He wondered why the air
the words which were yet written with a certain knack and the voice
and accent of the singer should all jar his spirit like a file on a
mans teeth He sickened at the thought of his two comrades drinking
away their reason upon stolen wine quarrelling and hiccupping and
waking up while the doors of the prison yawned for them in the near
future Shall I have sold my honour for nothing he thought and
a heat of rage and resolution glowed in his bosomrage against his
comradesresolution to carry through this business if it might be
carried pluck profit out of shame since the shame at least was now
inevitable and come home home from South Americahow did the song
gowith his pockets full of money


O honey with our pockets full of money

We will trip trip trip we will trip it on the quay

so the words ran in his head and the honey took on visible form the
quay rose before him and he knew it for the lamplit Embankment and
he saw the lights of Battersea bridge bestride the sullen river All
through the remainder of his trick he stood entranced reviewing the
past He had been always true to his love but not always sedulous
to recall her In the growing calamity of his life she had swum
more distant like the moon in mist The letter of farewell the
dishonourable hope that had surprised and corrupted him in his distress
the changed scene the sea the night and the musicall stirred him
to the roots of manhood I WILL win her he thought and ground his
teeth Fair or foul what matters if I win her

Fo bell matey I think um fo bellhe was suddenly recalled by
these words in the voice of Uncle Ned

Look in at the clock Uncle said he He would not look himself from
horror of the tipplers

Him past matey repeated the Hawaiian

So much the better for you Uncle he replied and he gave up the
wheel repeating the directions as he had received them

He took two steps forward and remembered his dead reckoning How has
she been heading he thought and he flushed from head to foot He had
not observed or had forgotten here was the old incompetence the slate
must be filled up by guess Never again he vowed to himself in silent
fury never again It shall be no fault of mine if this miscarry And
for the remainder of his watch he stood close by Uncle Ned and read
the face of the compass as perhaps he had never read a letter from his
sweetheart

All the time and spurring him to the more attention song loud talk
fleering laughter and the occasional popping of a cork reached his ears
from the interior of the house and when the port watch was relieved
at midnight Huish and the captain appeared upon the quarterdeck with
flushed faces and uneven steps the former laden with bottles the
latter with two tin mugs Herrick silently passed them by They hailed
him in thick voices he made no answer they cursed him for a churl
he paid no heed although his belly quivered with disgust and rage He
closedto the door of the house behind him and cast himself on a locker
in the cabinnot to sleep he thoughtrather to think and to despair
Yet he had scarce turned twice on his uneasy bed before a drunken voice
hailed him in the ear and he must go on deck again to stand the morning
watch

The first evening set the model for those that were to follow Two cases
of champagne scarce lasted the fourandtwenty hours and almost the
whole was drunk by Huish and the captain Huish seemed to thrive on the
excess he was never sober yet never wholly tipsy the food and the sea
air had soon healed him of his disease and he began to lay on flesh
But with Davis things went worse In the drooping unbuttoned figure
that sprawled all day upon the lockers tippling and reading novels
in the fool who made of the evening watch a public carouse on the
quarterdeck it would have been hard to recognise the vigorous seaman
of Papeete roads He kept himself reasonably well in hand till he had
taken the sun and yawned and blotted through his calculations but from
the moment he rolled up the chart his hours were passed in slavish
selfindulgence or in hoggish slumber Every other branch of his duty
was neglected except maintaining a stern discipline about the dinner
table Again and again Herrick would hear the cook called aft and see
him running with fresh tins or carrying away again a meal that had been
totally condemned And the more the captain became sunk in drunkenness
the more delicate his palate showed itself Once in the forenoon he
had a bosuns chair rigged over the rail stripped to his trousers
and went overboard with a pot of paint I dont like the way this
schooners painted said he and Ive taken a down upon her name But
he tired of it in half an hour and the schooner went on her way with
an incongruous patch of colour on the stern and the word Farallone part
obliterated and part looking through He refused to stand either the
middle or the morning watch It was fineweather sailing he said
and asked with a laugh Who ever heard of the old man standing watch
himself To the dead reckoning which Herrick still tried to keep he
would pay not the least attention nor afford the least assistance

What do we want of dead reckoning he asked We get the sun all
right dont we

We maynt get it always though objected Herrick And you told me
yourself you werent sure of the chronometer

Oh there aint no flies in the chronometer cried Davis

Oblige me so far captain said Herrick stiffly I am anxious to keep
this reckoning which is a part of my duty I do not know what to allow
for current nor how to allow for it I am too inexperienced and I beg
of you to help me

Never discourage zealous officer said the captain unrolling the
chart again for Herrick had taken him over his days work and while he
was still partly sober Here it is look for yourself anything from
west to west nothewest and anyways from five to twentyfive miles
Thats what the Amralty chart says I guess you dont expect to get on
ahead of your own Britishers

I am trying to do my duty Captain Brown said Herrick with a dark
flush and I have the honour to inform you that I dont enjoy being
trifled with

What in thunder do you want roared Davis Go and look at the blamed
wake If youre trying to do your duty why dont you go and do it I
guess its no business of mine to go and stick my head over the ships
rump I guess its yours And Ill tell you what it is my fine fellow
Ill trouble you not to come the dude over me Youre insolent thats
whats wrong with you Dont you crowd me Mr Herrick Esquire

Herrick tore up his papers threw them on the floor and left the cabin

Hes turned a bloomin swot aint he sneered Huish

He thinks himself too good for his company thats what ails Herrick
Esquire raged the captain He thinks I dont understand when he comes
the heavy swell Wont sit down with us wont he wont say a civil
word Ill serve the son of a gun as he deserves By God Huish Ill
show him whether hes too good for John Davis

Easy with the names cap said Huish who was always the more sober
Easy over the stones my boy

All right I will Youre a good sort Huish I didnt take to you at
first but I guess youre right enough Lets open another bottle
said the captain and that day perhaps because he was excited by the
quarrel he drank more recklessly and by four oclock was stretched
insensible upon the locker

Herrick and Huish supped alone one after the other opposite his
flushed and snorting body And if the sight killed Herricks hunger the
isolation weighed so heavily on the clerks spirit that he was scarce
risen from table ere he was currying favour with his former comrade

Herrick was at the wheel when he approached and Huish leaned
confidentially across the binnacle

I say old chappie he said you and me dont seem to be such pals
somehow

Herrick gave her a spoke or two in silence his eye as it skirted
from the needle to the luff of the foresail passed the man by without
speculation But Huish was really dull a thing he could support with
difficulty having no resources of his own The idea of a private talk
with Herrick at this stage of their relations held out particular
inducements to a person of his character Drink besides as it renders
some men hypersensitive made Huish callous And it would almost have
required a blow to make him quit his purpose

Pretty business aint it he continued Dyvis on the lush Must say
I thought you gave it im A1 today He didnt like it a bit took on
hawful after you were goneEre says I old on easy on the
lush I says Errick was right and you know it Give im a chanst
I saysUish sezee dont you gimme no more of your jaw or Ill
knock your bloomin eyes out Well wot can I do Errick But I tell
you I dont arf like it It looks to me like the Sea Rynger over
again

Still Herrick was silent

Do you hear me speak asked Huish sharply Youre pleasant aint
you

Stand away from that binnacle said Herrick

The clerk looked at him long and straight and black his figure seemed
to writhe like that of a snake about to strike then he turned on his
heel went back to the cabin and opened a bottle of champagne When
eight bells were cried he slept on the floor beside the captain on the
locker and of the whole starboard watch only Sally Day appeared upon
the summons The mate proposed to stand the watch with him and let
Uncle Ned lie down it would make twelve hours on deck and probably
sixteen but in this fairweather sailing he might safely sleep between
his tricks of wheel leaving orders to be called on any sign of squalls
So far he could trust the men between whom and himself a close relation
had sprung up With Uncle Ned he held long nocturnal conversations and
the old man told him his simple and hard story of exile suffering and
injustice among cruel whites The cook when he found Herrick messed
alone produced for him unexpected and sometimes unpalatable dainties
of which he forced himself to eat And one day when he was forward
he was surprised to feel a caressing hand run down his shoulder and to
hear the voice of Sally Day crooning in his ear You gootch man He
turned and choking down a sob shook hands with the negrito They were
kindly cheery childish souls Upon the Sunday each brought forth
his separate Biblefor they were all men of alien speech even to each
other and Sally Day communicated with his mates in English only each
read or made believe to read his chapter Uncle Ned with spectacles on
his nose and they would all join together in the singing of missionary
hymns It was thus a cutting reproof to compare the islanders and the
whites aboard the Farallone Shame ran in Herricks blood to remember
what employment he was on and to see these poor soulsand even Sally
Day the child of cannibals in all likelihood a cannibal himselfso
faithful to what they knew of good The fact that he was held in
grateful favour by these innocents served like blinders to his
conscience and there were times when he was inclined with Sally Day
to call himself a good man But the height of his favour was only now to
appear With one voice the crew protested ere Herrick knew what they
were doing the cook was aroused and came a willing volunteer all hands
clustered about their mate with expostulations and caresses and he was
bidden to lie down and take his customary rest without alarm

He tell you tlue said Uncle Ned You sleep Evely man hae he do all
light Evely man he like you too much

Herrick struggled and gave way choked upon some trivial words of
gratitude and walked to the side of the house against which he leaned
struggling with emotion

Uncle Ned presently followed him and begged him to lie down

Its no use Uncle Ned he replied I couldnt sleep Im knocked
over with all your goodness

Ah no call me Uncle Ned no mo cried the old man No my name My
name Taveeta allesame Taveeta King of Islael Wat for he call that
Hawaii I think no savvy nothingallesame Wiseamana

It was the first time the name of the late captain had been mentioned
and Herrick grasped the occasion The reader shall be spared Uncle Neds
unwieldy dialect and learn in less embarrassing English the sum of
what he now communicated The ship had scarce cleared the Golden Gates
before the captain and mate had entered on a career of drunkenness
which was scarcely interrupted by their malady and only closed by death
For days and weeks they had encountered neither land nor ship and
seeing themselves lost on the huge deep with their insane conductors
the natives had drunk deep of terror

At length they made a low island and went in and Wiseman and Wishart
landed in the boat

There was a great village a very fine village and plenty Kanakas in
that place but all mighty serious and from every here and there in
the back parts of the settlement Taveeta heard the sounds of island
lamentation I no savvy TALK that island said he I savvy hear
um CLY I think Hum too many people die here But upon Wiseman and
Wishart the significance of that barbaric keening was lost Full of
bread and drink they rollicked along unconcerned embraced the girls
who had scarce energy to repel them took up and joined with drunken
voices in the death wail and at last on what they took to be
an invitation entered under the roof of a house in which was a
considerable concourse of people sitting silent They stooped below the
eaves flushed and laughing within a minute they came forth again with
changed faces and silent tongues and as the press severed to make way
for them Taveeta was able to perceive in the deep shadow of the house
the sick man raising from his mat a head already defeatured by disease
The two tragic triflers fled without hesitation for their boat
screaming on Taveeta to make haste they came aboard with all speed
of oars raised anchor and crowded sail upon the ship with blows and
curses and were at sea againand again drunkbefore sunset A week
after and the last of the two had been committed to the deep Herrick
asked Taveeta where that island was and he replied that by what he
gathered of folks talk as they went up together from the beach he
supposed it must be one of the Paumotus This was in itself probable
enough for the Dangerous Archipelago had been swept that year from east
to west by devastating smallpox but Herrick thought it a strange course
to lie from Sydney Then he remembered the drink

Were they not surprised when they made the island he asked

Wiseamana he say dam what this was the reply

O thats it then said Herrick I dont believe they knew where they
were

I think so too said Uncle Ned I think no savvy This one mo
betta he added pointing to the house where the drunken captain
slumbered Takeasun alletime

The implied last touch completed Herricks picture of the life and death
of his two predecessors of their prolonged sordid sodden sensuality
as they sailed they knew not whither on their last cruise He held but
a twinkling and unsure belief in any future state the thought of one
of punishment he derided yet for him as for all there dwelt a horror
about the end of the brutish man Sickness fell upon him at the image
thus called up and when he compared it with the scene in which himself
was acting and considered the doom that seemed to brood upon the
schooner a horror that was almost superstitious fell upon him And
yet the strange thing was he did not falter He who had proved his
incapacity in so many fields being now falsely placed amid duties
which he did not understand without help and it might be said without
countenance had hitherto surpassed expectation and even the shameful
misconduct and shocking disclosures of that night seemed but to nerve
and strengthen him He had sold his honour he vowed it should not be in
vain it shall be no fault of mine if this miscarry he repeated And
in his heart he wondered at himself Living rage no doubt supported him
no doubt also the sense of the last cast of the ships burned of all
doors closed but one which is so strong a tonic to the merely weak and
so deadly a depressant to the merely cowardly

For some time the voyage went otherwise well They weathered Fakarava
with one board and the wind holding well to the southward and
blowing fresh they passed between Ranaka and Ratiu and ran some days
northeast by easthalfeast under the lee of Takume and Honden neither
of which they made In about 14 degrees South and between 134 and 135
degrees West it fell a dead calm with rather a heavy sea The captain
refused to take in sail the helm was lashed no watch was set and the
Farallone rolled and banged for three days according to observation in
almost the same place The fourth morning a little before day a breeze
sprang up and rapidly freshened The captain had drunk hard the night
before he was far from sober when he was roused and when he came on
deck for the first time at halfpast eight it was plain he had already
drunk deep again at breakfast Herrick avoided his eye and resigned the
deck with indignation to a man more than halfseas over

By the loud commands of the captain and the singing out of fellows at
the ropes he could judge from the house that sail was being crowded on
the ship relinquished his halfeaten breakfast and came on deck again
to find the main and the jib topsails set and both watches and the cook
turned out to hand the staysail The Farallone lay already far over
the sky was obscured with misty scud and from the windward an ominous
squall came flying up broadening and blackening as it rose

Fear thrilled in Herricks vitals He saw death hard by and if not
death sure ruin For if the Farallone lived through the coming squall
she must surely be dismasted With that their enterprise was at an end
and they themselves bound prisoners to the very evidence of their crime
The greatness of the peril and his own alarm sufficed to silence him
Pride wrath and shame raged without issue in his mind and he shut his
teeth and folded his arms close

The captain sat in the boat to windward bellowing orders and insults
his eyes glazed his face deeply congested a bottle set between his
knees a glass in his hand half empty His back was to the squall and
he was at first intent upon the setting of the sail When that was done
and the great trapezium of canvas had begun to draw and to trail the
leerail of the Farallone level with the foam he laughed out an empty
laugh drained his glass sprawled back among the lumber in the boat
and fetched out a crumpled novel

Herrick watched him and his indignation glowed red hot He glanced to
windward where the squall already whitened the near sea and heralded its
coming with a singular and dismal sound He glanced at the steersman
and saw him clinging to the spokes with a face of a sickly blue He saw
the crew were running to their stations without orders And it seemed
as if something broke in his brain and the passion of anger so long
restrained so long eaten in secret burst suddenly loose and shook him
like a sail He stepped across to the captain and smote his hand heavily
on the drunkards shoulder

You brute he said in a voice that tottered look behind you

Whas that cried Davis bounding in the boat and upsetting the
champagne

You lost the Sea Ranger because you were a drunken sot said Herrick
Now youre going to lose the Farallone Youre going to drown here the
same way as you drowned others and be damned And your daughter shall
walk the streets and your sons be thieves like their father

For the moment the words struck the captain white and foolish My
God he cried looking at Herrick as upon a ghost my God Herrick

Look behind you then reiterated the assailant

The wretched man already partly sobered did as he was told and in the
same breath of time leaped to his feet Down staysail he trumpeted
The hands were thrilling for the order and the great sail came with
a run and fell half overboard among the racing foam Jib
topsailhalyards Let the staysl be he said again

But before it was well uttered the squall shouted aloud and fell in
a solid mass of wind and rain commingled on the Farallone and she
stooped under the blow and lay like a thing dead From the mind of
Herrick reason fled he clung in the weather rigging exulting he was
done with life and he gloried in the release he gloried in the wild
noises of the wind and the choking onslaught of the rain he gloried to
die so and now amid this coil of the elements And meanwhile in the
waist up to his knees in waterso low the schooner laythe captain
was hacking at the foresheet with a pocket knife It was a question of
seconds for the Farallone drank deep of the encroaching seas But the
hand of the captain had the advance the foresail boom tore apart the
last strands of the sheet and crashed to leeward the Farallone leaped
up into the wind and righted and the peak and throat halyards which
had long been let go began to run at the same instant

For some ten minutes more she careered under the impulse of the squall
but the captain was now master of himself and of his ship and all
danger at an end And then sudden as a trick change upon the stage the
squall blew by the wind dropped into light airs the sun beamed forth
again upon the tattered schooner and the captain having secured the
foresail boom and set a couple of hands to the pump walked aft sober
a little pale and with the sodden end of a cigar still stuck between
his teeth even as the squall had found it Herrick followed him he
could scarce recall the violence of his late emotions but he felt
there was a scene to go through and he was anxious and even eager to go
through with it

The captain turning at the house end met him face to face and averted
his eyes Weve lost the two topsls and the staysl he gabbled
Good business we didnt lose any sticks I guess you think were all
the better without the kites

Thats not what Im thinking said Herrick in a voice strangely
quiet that yet echoed confusion in the captains mind

I know that he cried holding up his hand I know what youre
thinking No use to say it now Im sober

I have to say it though returned Herrick

Hold on Herrick youve said enough said Davis Youve said what I
would take from no man breathing but yourself only I know its true

I have to tell you Captain Brown pursued Herrick that I resign my
position as mate You can put me in irons or shoot me as you please I
will make no resistanceonly I decline in any way to help or to obey
you and I suggest you should put Mr Huish in my place He will make a
worthy first officer to your captain sir He smiled bowed and turned
to walk forward

Where are you going Herrick cried the captain detaining him by the
shoulder

To berth forward with the men sir replied Herrick with the same
hateful smile Ive been long enough aft here with yougentlemen

Youre wrong there said Davis Dont you be too quick with me there
aint nothing wrong but the drinkits the old story man Let me get
sober once and then youll see he pleaded

Excuse me I desire to see no more of you said Herrick

The captain groaned aloud You know what you said about my children
he broke out

By rote In case you wish me to say it you again asked Herrick

Dont cried the captain clapping his hands to his ears Dont make
me kill a man I care for Herrick if you see me put glass to my lips
again till were ashore I give you leave to put bullet through me
I beg you to do it Youre the only man aboard whose carcase is worth
losing do you think I dont know that do you think I ever went back on
you I always knew you were in the right of itdrunk or sober I knew
that What do you wantan oath Man youre clever enough to see that
this is sureenough earnest

Do you mean there shall be no more drinking asked Herrick neither
by you nor Huish that you wont go on stealing my profits and drinking
my champagne that I gave my honour for and that youll attend to your
duties and stand watch and watch and bear your proper share of the
ships work instead of leaving it all on the shoulders of a landsman
and making yourself the butt and scoff of native seamen Is that what
you mean If it is be so good as to say it categorically

You put these things in a way hard for a gentleman to swallow said
the captain You wouldnt have me say I was ashamed of myself Trust me
this once Ill do the square thing and theres my hand on it

Well Ill try it once said Herrick Fail me again

No more now interrupted Davis No more old man Enough said Youve
a riling tongue when your backs up Herrick Just be glad were friends
again the same as what I am and go tender on the raws Ill see as you
dont repent it Weve been mighty near death this daydont say whose
fault it waspretty near hell too I guess Were in a mighty bad
line of life us two and ought to go easy with each other

He was maundering yet it seemed as if he were maundering with some
design beating about the bush of some communication that he feared to
make or perhaps only talking against time in terror of what Herrick
might say next But Herrick had now spat his venom his was a kindly
nature and content with his triumph he had now begun to pity With
a few soothing words he sought to conclude the interview and proposed
that they should change their clothes

Not right yet said Davis Theres another thing I want to tell you
first You know what you said about my children I want to tell you why
it hit me so hard I kind of think youll feel bad about it too Its
about my little Adar You hadnt ought to have quite said thatbut of
course I know you didnt know Sheshes dead you see

Why Davis cried Herrick Youve told me a dozen times she was
alive Clear your head man This must be the drink

No SIR said Davis Shes dead Died of a bowel complaint That was
when I was away in the brig Oregon She lies in Portland Maine Adar
only daughter of Captain John Davis and Mariar his wife aged five
I had a doll for her on board I never took the paper offn that doll
Herrick it went down the way it was with the Sea Ranger that day I was
damned

The Captains eyes were fixed on the horizon he talked with an
extraordinary softness but a complete composure and Herrick looked upon
him with something that was almost terror

Dont think Im crazy neither resumed Davis Ive all the cold sense
that I know what to do with But I guess a man thats unhappys like a
child and this is a kind of a childs game of mine I never could act
up to the plaincut truth you see so I pretend And I warn you square
as soon as were through with this talk Ill start in again with
the pretending Only you see she cant walk no streets added the
captain couldnt even make out to live and get that doll

Herrick laid a tremulous hand upon the captains shoulder

Dont do that cried Davis recoiling from the touch Cant you see
Im all broken up the way it is Come along then come along old
man you can put your trust in me right through come along and get dry
clothes

They entered the cabin and there was Huish on his knees prising open a
case of champagne

Vast there cried the captain No more of that No more drinking on
this ship

Turned teetotal ave you inquired Hush Im agreeable About time
eh Bloomin nearly lost another ship I fancy He took out a bottle
and began calmly to burst the wire with the spike of a corkscrew

Do you hear me speak cried Davis

I suppose I do You speak loud enough said Huish The trouble is
that I dont care

Herrick plucked the captains sleeve Let him free now he said
Weve had all we want this morning

Let him have it then said the captain Its his last

By this time the wire was open the string was cut the head of glided
paper was torn away and Huish waited mug in hand expecting the usual
explosion It did not follow He eased the cork with his thumb still
there was no result At last he took the screw and drew it It came out
very easy and with scarce a sound

Illosaid Huish Eres a bad bottle

He poured some of the wine into the mug it was colourless and still He
smelt and tasted it

Wy wots this he said Its water

If the voice of trumpets had suddenly sounded about the ship in the
midst of the sea the three men in the house could scarcely have been
more stunned than by this incident The mug passed round each sipped
each smelt of it each stared at the bottle in its glory of gold paper
as Crusoe may have stared at the footprint and their minds were swift
to fix upon a common apprehension The difference between a bottle of
champagne and a bottle of water is not great between a shipload of one
or the other lay the whole scale from riches to ruin

A second bottle was broached There were two cases standing ready in a
stateroom these two were brought out broken open and tested Still
with the same result the contents were still colourless and tasteless
and dead as the rain in a beached fishingboat

Crikey said Huish

Here lets sample the hold said the captain mopping his brow with
a backhanded sweep and the three stalked out of the house grim and
heavyfooted

All hands were turned out two Kanakas were sent below another
stationed at a purchase and Davis axe in hand took his place beside
the coamings

Are you going to let the men know whispered Herrick

Damn the men said Davis Its beyond that Weve got to know
ourselves

Three cases were sent on deck and sampled in turn from each bottle
as the captain smashed it with the axe the champagne ran bubbling and
creaming

Go deeper cant you cried Davis to the Kanakas in the hold

The command gave the signal for a disastrous change Case after case
came up bottle after bottle was burst and bled mere water Deeper
yet and they came upon a layer where there was scarcely so much as
the intention to deceive where the cases were no longer branded the
bottles no longer wired or papered where the fraud was manifest and
stared them in the face

Heres about enough of this foolery said Davis Stow back the cases
in the hold Uncle and get the broken crockery overboard Come with
me he added to his coadventurers and led the way back into the
cabin



Chapter 6 THE PARTNERS

Each took a side of the fixed table it was the first time they had sat
down at it together but now all sense of incongruity all memory of
differences was quite swept away by the presence of the common ruin

Gentlemen said the captain after a pause and with very much the air
of a chairman opening a boardmeeting were sold

Huish broke out in laughter Well if this aint the ighest old rig
he cried And Dyvis ere who thought he had got up so bloomin early
in the mornin Weve stolen a cargo of spring water Oh my crikey
and he squirmed with mirth

The captain managed to screw out a phantom smile

Heres Old Man Destiny again said he to Herrick but this time I
guess hes kicked the door right in

Herrick only shook his head

O Lord its rich laughed Huish It would really be a scrumptious
lark if it ad appened to somebody else And wot are we to do next Oh
my eye with this bloomin schooner too

Thats the trouble said Davis Theres only one thing certain its
no use carting this old glass and ballast to Peru No SIR were in a
hole

O my and the merchand cried Huish the man that made this shipment
Hell get the news by the mail brigantine and hell think of course
were making straight for Sydney

Yes hell be a sick merchant said the captain One thing this
explains the Kanaka crew If youre going to lose a ship I would ask
no better myself than a Kanaka crew But theres one thing it dont
explain it dont explain why she came down Tahiti ways

Wy to lose her you byby said Huish

A lot you know said the captain Nobody wants to lose a schooner
they want to lose her ON HER COURSE you skeericks You seem to think
underwriters havent got enough sense to come in out of the rain

Well said Herrick I can tell you I am afraid why she came so
far to the eastward I had it of Uncle Ned It seems these two unhappy
devils Wiseman and Wishart were drunk on the champagne from the
beginningand died drunk at the end

The captain looked on the table

They lay in their two bunks or sat here in this damned house he
pursued with rising agitation filling their skins with the accursed
stuff till sickness took them As they sickened and the fever rose
they drank the more They lay here howling and groaning drunk and
dying all in one They didnt know where they were they didnt care
They didnt even take the sun it seems

Not take the sun cried the captain looking up Sacred Billy what a
crowd

Well it dont matter to Joe said Huish Wot are Wiseman and the
tother buffer to us

A good deal too says the captain Were their heirs I guess

It is a great inheritance said Herrick

Well I dont know about that returned Davis Appears to me as if it
might be worse Taint worth what the cargo would have been of course
at least not money down But Ill tell you what it appears to figure up
to Appears to me as if it amounted to about the bottom dollar of the
man in Frisco

Old on said Huish Give a fellow time ows this umpire

Well my sons pursued the captain who seemed to have recovered his
assurance Wiseman and Wishart were to be paid for casting away this
old schooner and its cargo Were going to cast away the schooner right
enough and Ill make it my private business to see that we get paid
What were W and W to get Thats moren I can tell But W and W went
into this business themselves they were on the crook Now WERE on
the square we only stumbled into it and that merchant has just got to
squeal and Im the man to see that he squeals good No sir theres
some stuffing to this Farallone racket after all

Go it cap cried Huish Yoicks Forrard Old ard Theres your
style for the money Blow me if I dont prefer this to the hother

I do not understand said Herrick I have to ask you to excuse me I
do not understand

Well now see here Herrick said Davis Im going to have a word
with you anyway upon a different matter and its good that Huish should
hear it too Were done with this boozing business and we ask your
pardon for it right here and now We have to thank you for all you did
for us while we were making hogs of ourselves youll find me turnto
all right in future and as for the wine which I grant we stole from
you Ill take stock and see you paid for it Thats good enough I
believe But what I want to point out to you is this The old game was
a risky game The new games as safe as running a Vienna Bakery We just
put this Farallone before the wind and run till were well to looard
of our port of departure and reasonably well up with some other place
where they have an American Consul Down goes the Farallone and
goodbye to her A day or so in the boat the consul packs us home
at Uncle Sams expense to Frisco and if that merchant dont put the
dollars down you come to me

But I thought began Herrick and then broke out oh lets get on to
Peru

Well if youre going to Peru for your health I wont say no
replied the captain But for what other blame shadow of a reason you
should want to go there gets me clear We dont want to go there with
this cargo I dont know as old bottles is a lively article anywheres
leastways Ill go my bottom cent it aint Peru It was always a doubt
if we could sell the schooner I never rightly hoped to and now Im
sure she aint worth a hill of beans whats wrong with her I dont
know I only know its something or she wouldnt be here with this
truck in her inside Then again if we lose her and land in Peru where
are we We cant declare the loss or how did we get to Peru In that
case the merchant cant touch the insurance most likely hell go bust
and dont you think you see the three of us on the beach of Callao

Theres no extradition there said Herrick

Well my son and we want to be extraded said the captain

Whats our point We want to have a consul extrade us as far as San
Francisco and that merchants office door My idea is that Samoa would
be found an eligible business centre Its dead before the wind the
States have a consul there and Frisco steamers call sos we could
skip right back and interview the merchant

Samoa said Herrick It will take us for ever to get there

Oh with a fair wind said the captain

No trouble about the log eh asked Huish

No SIR said Davis Light airs and baffling winds Squalls and
calms D R five miles No obs Pumps attended And fill in the
barometer and thermometer off of last years trip Never saw such a
voyage says you to the consul Thought I was going to run short
He stopped in mid career Say he began again and once more stopped
Beg your pardon Herrick he added with undisguised humility but did
you keep the run of the stores

Had I been told to do so it should have been done as the rest was
done to the best of my little ability said Herrick As it was the
cook helped himself to what he pleased

Davis looked at the table

I drew it rather fine you see he said at last The great thing was
to clear right out of Papeete before the consul could think better of
it Tell you what I guess Ill take stock

And he rose from table and disappeared with a lamp in the lazarette

Eres another screw loose observed Huish

My man said Herrick with a sudden gleam of animosity it is still
your watch on deck and surely your wheel also

You come the eavy swell dont you ducky said Huish

Stand away from that binnacle Surely your weel my man Yah

He lit a cigar ostentatiously and strolled into the waist with his
hands in his pockets

In a surprisingly short time the captain reappeared he did not look at
Herrick but called Huish back and sat down

Well he began Ive taken stockroughly He paused as if for
somebody to help him out and none doing so both gazing on him instead
with manifest anxiety he yet more heavily resumed Well it wont
fight We cant do it thats the bed rock Im as sorry as what you can
be and sorrier We cant look near Samoa I dont know as we could get
to Peru

Wotju mean asked Huish brutally

I cant most tell myself replied the captain I drew it fine I
said I did but whats been going on here gets me Appears as if the
devil had been around That cook must be the holiest kind of fraud Only
twelve days too Seems like craziness Ill own up square to one thing
I seem to have figured too fine upon the flour But the restmy land
Ill never understand it Theres been more waste on this twopenny
ship than what there is to an Atlantic Liner He stole a glance at his
companions nothing good was to be gleaned from their dark faces and he
had recourse to rage You wait till I interview that cook he roared
and smote the table with his fist Ill interview the son of a gun sos
hes never been spoken to before Ill put a bead upon the

You will not lay a finger on the man said Herrick The fault is
yours and you know it If you turn a savage loose in your storeroom
you know what to expect I will not allow the man to be molested

It is hard to say how Davis might have taken this defiance but he was
diverted to a fresh assailant

Well drawled Huish youre a plummy captain aint you Youre a
blooming captain Dont you set up any of your chat to me John Dyvis
I know you now you aint any more use than a bloomin dawl Oh you
dont know dont you Oh it gets you do it Oh I dessay Wy
we ent you owling for fresh tins every blessed day Ow often ave I
eard you send the ole bloomin dinner off and tell the man to chuck it
in the swill tub And breakfast Oh my crikey breakfast for ten and
you ollerin for more And now you cant most tell Blow me if it
aint enough to make a man write an insultin letter to Gawd You dror
it mild John Dyvis dont andle me Im dyngerous

Davis sat like one bemused it might even have been doubted if he heard
but the voice of the clerk rang about the cabin like that of a cormorant
among the ledges of the cliff

That will do Huish said Herrick

Oh so you tyke his part do you you stuckup sneerin snob Tyke it
then Come on the pair of you But as for John Dyvis let him look out
He struck me the first night aboard and I never took a blow yet but
wot I gave as good Let him knuckle down on his marrow bones and beg my
pardon Thats my last word

I stand by the Captain said Herrick That makes us two to one both
good men and the crew will all follow me I hope I shall die very soon
but I have not the least objection to killing you before I go I should
prefer it so I should do it with no more remorse than winking Take
caretake care you little cad

The animosity with which these words were uttered was so marked in
itself and so remarkable in the man who uttered them that Huish stared
and even the humiliated Davis reared up his head and gazed at his
defender As for Herrick the successive agitations and disappointments
of the day had left him wholly reckless he was conscious of a pleasant
glow an agreeable excitement his head seemed empty his eyeballs
burned as he turned them his throat was dry as a biscuit the least
dangerous man by nature except in so far as the weak are always
dangerous at that moment he was ready to slay or to be slain with equal
unconcern

Here at least was the gage thrown down and battle offered he who
should speak next would bring the matter to an issue there and then all
knew it to be so and hung back and for many seconds by the cabin clock
the trio sat motionless and silent

Then came an interruption welcome as the flowers in May

Land ho sang out a voice on deck Land a weatha bow

Land cried Davis springing to his feet Whats this There aint no
land here

And as men may run from the chamber of a murdered corpse the three ran
forth out of the house and left their quarrel behind them undecided

The sky shaded down at the sea level to the white of opals the sea
itself insolently inkily blue drew all about them the uncompromising
wheel of the horizon Search it as they pleased not even the practisect
eye of Captain Davis could descry the smallest interruption A few filmy
clouds were slowly melting overhead and about the schooner as around
the only point of interest a tropic bird white as a snowflake hung
and circled and displayed as it turned the long vermilion feather of
its tall Save the sea and the heaven that was all

Who sang out land asked Davis If theres any boy playing funny dog
with me Ill teach him skylarking

But Uncle Ned contentedly pointed to a part of the horizon where a
greenish filmy iridescence could be discerned floating like smoke on
the pale heavens

Davis applied his glass to it and then looked at the Kanaka Call that
land said he Well its more than I do

One time long ago said Uncle Ned I see Anaa allesame that four
five hours befo we come up Capena he say sun go down sun go up again
he say lagoon allesame milla

Allesame WHAT asked Davis

Milla sah said Uncle Ned

Oh ah mirror said Davis I see reflection from the lagoon Well
you know it is just possible though its strange I never heard of it
Here lets look at the chart

They went back to the cabin and found the position of the schooner well
to windward of the archipelago in the midst of a white field of paper

There you see for yourselves said Davis

And yet I dont know said Herrick I somehow think theres something
in it Ill tell you one thing too captain thats all right about the
reflection I heard it in Papeete

Fetch up that Findlay then said Davis Ill try it all ways An
island wouldnt come amiss the way were fixed

The bulky volume was handed up to him brokenbacked as is the way with
Findlay and he turned to the place and began to run over the text
muttering to himself and turning over the pages with a wetted finger

Hullo he exclaimed Hows this And he read aloud New Island
According to M Delille this island which from private interests would
remain unknown lies it is said in lat 12 degrees 49 10 S long
113 degrees 6 W In addition to the position above given Commander
Matthews HMS Scorpion states that an island exists in lat 12
degrees 0 S long 13 degrees 16 W This must be the same if such
an island exists which is very doubtful and totally disbelieved in by
South Sea traders

Golly said Huish

Its rather in the conditional mood said Herrick

Its anything you please cried Davis only there it is Thats our
place and dont you make any mistake

Which from private interests would remain unknown read Herrick
over his shoulder What may that mean

It should mean pearls said Davis A pearling island the government
dont know about That sounds like real estate Or suppose it dont mean
anything Suppose its just an island I guess we could fill up with
fish and cocoanuts and native stuff and carry out the Samoa scheme
hand over fist How long did he say it was before they raised Anaa Five
hours I think

Four or five said Herrick

Davis stepped to the door What breeze had you that time you made Anaa
Uncle Ned said he

Six or seven knots was the reply

Thirty or thirtyfive miles said Davis High time we were shortening
sail then If it is an island we dont want to be butting our head
against it in the dark and if it isnt an island we can get through it
just as well by daylight Ready about he roared

And the schooners head was laid for that elusive glimmer in the sky
which began already to pale in lustre and diminish in size as the stain
of breath vanishes from a window pane At the same time she was reefed
close down



Part II

THE QUARTETTE

Chapter 7 THE PEARLFISHER

About four in the morning as the captain and Herrick sat together on
the rail there arose from the midst of the night in front of them the
voice of breakers Each sprang to his feet and stared and listened The
sound was continuous like the passing of a train no rise or fall
could be distinguished minute by minute the ocean heaved with an equal
potency against the invisible isle and as time passed and Herrick
waited in vain for any vicissitude in the volume of that roaring a
sense of the eternal weighed upon his mind To the expert eye the isle
itself was to be inferred from a certain string of blots along the
starry heaven And the schooner was laid to and anxiously observed till
daylight

There was little or no morning bank A brightening came in the east
then a wash of some ineffable faint nameless hue between crimson and
silver and then coals of fire These glimmered a while on the sea line
and seemed to brighten and darken and spread out and still the night
and the stars reigned undisturbed it was as though a spark should
catch and glow and creep along the foot of some heavy and almost
incombustible wallhanging and the room itself be scarce menaced Yet
a little after and the whole east glowed with gold and scarlet and the
hollow of heaven was filled with the daylight

The islethe undiscovered the scarce believedinnow lay before them
and close aboard and Herrick thought that never in his dreams had he
beheld anything more strange and delicate The beach was excellently
white the continuous barrier of trees inimitably green the land
perhaps ten feet high the trees thirty more Every here and there as
the schooner coasted northward the wood was intermitted and he could
see clear over the inconsiderable strip of land as a man looks over a
wall to the lagoon withinand clear over that again to where the far
side of the atoll prolonged its pencilling of trees against the morning
sky He tortured himself to find analogies The isle was like the rim
of a great vessel sunken in the waters it was like the embankment of
an annular railway grown upon with wood so slender it seemed amidst the
outrageous breakers so frail and pretty he would scarce have wondered
to see it sink and disappear without a sound and the waves close
smoothly over its descent

Meanwhile the captain was in the forecrosstrees glass in hand his
eyes in every quarter spying for an entrance spying for signs of
tenancy But the isle continued to unfold itself in joints and to run
out in indeterminate capes and still there was neither house nor
man nor the smoke of fire Here a multitude of seabirds soared and
twinkled and fished in the blue waters and there and for miles
together the fringe of cocoapalm and pandanus extended desolate and
made desirable green bowers for nobody to visit and the silence of
death was only broken by the throbbing of the sea

The airs were very light their speed was small the heat intense The
decks were scorching underfoot the sun flamed overhead brazen out
of a brazen sky the pitch bubbled in the seams and the brains in the
brainpan And all the while the excitement of the three adventurers
glowed about their bones like a fever They whispered and nodded and
pointed and put mouth to ear with a singular instinct of secrecy
approaching that island underhand like eavesdroppers and thieves and
even Davis from the crosstrees gave his orders mostly by gestures The
hands shared in this mute strain like dogs without comprehending it
and through the roar of so many miles of breakers it was a silent ship
that approached an empty island

At last they drew near to the break in that interminable gangway A spur
of coral sand stood forth on the one hand on the other a high and thick
tuft of trees cut off the view between was the mouth of the huge laver
Twice a day the ocean crowded in that narrow entrance and was heaped
between these frail walls twice a day with the return of the ebb the
mighty surplusage of water must struggle to escape The hour in which
the Farallone came there was the hour of flood The sea turned as
with the instinct of the homing pigeon for the vast receptacle swept
eddying through the gates was transmuted as it did so into a wonder
of watery and silken hues and brimmed into the inland sea beyond The
schooner looked up closehauled and was caught and carried away by the
influx like a toy She skimmed she flew a momentary shadow touched her
decks from the shoreside trees the bottom of the channel showed up for
a moment and was in a moment gone the next she floated on the bosom of
the lagoon and below in the transparent chamber of waters a myriad
of manycoloured fishes were sporting a myriad paleflowers of coral
diversified the floor

Herrick stood transported In the gratified lust of his eye he forgot
the past and the present forgot that he was menaced by a prison on the
one hand and starvation on the other forgot that he was come to that
island desperately foraging clutching at expedients A drove of
fishes painted like the rainbow and billed like parrots hovered up in
the shadow of the schooner and passed clear of it and glinted in the
submarine sun They were beautiful like birds and their silent passage
impressed him like a strain of song

Meanwhile to the eye of Davis in the crosstrees the lagoon continued
to expand its empty waters and the long succession of the shoreside
trees to be paid out like fishing line off a reel And still there was
no mark of habitation The schooner immediately on entering had been
kept away to the norard where the water seemed to be the most deep and
she was now skimming past the tall grove of trees which stood on that
side of the channel and denied further view Of the whole of the low
shores of the island only this bight remained to be revealed And
suddenly the curtain was raised they began to open out a haven snugly
elbowed there and beheld with an astonishment beyond words the roofs
of men

The appearance thus instantaneously disclosed to those on the deck of
the Farallone was not that of a city rather of a substantial country
farm with its attendant hamlet a long line of sheds and storehouses
apart upon the one side a deepverandahed dwellinghouse on the
other perhaps a dozen native huts a building with a belfry and some
rude offer at architectural features that might be thought to mark it
out for a chapel on the beach in front some heavy boats drawn up and
a pile of timber running forth into the burning shallows of the
lagoon From a flagstaff at the pierhead the red ensign of England was
displayed Behind about and over the same tall grove of palms
which had masked the settlement in the beginning prolonged its root
of tumultuous green fans and turned and ruffled overhead and sang its
silver song all day in the wind The place had the indescribable but
unmistakable appearance of being in commission yet there breathed from
it a sense of desertion that was almost poignant no human figure was to
be observed going to and fro about the houses and there was no sound of
human industry or enjoyment Only on the top of the beach and hard by
the flagstaff a woman of exorbitant stature and as white as snow was to
be seen beckoning with uplifted arm The second glance identified her
as a piece of naval sculpture the figurehead of a ship that had long
hovered and plunged into so many running billows and was now brought
ashore to be the ensign and presiding genius of that empty town

The Farallone made a soldiers breeze of it the wind besides was
stronger inside than without under the lee of the land and the stolen
schooner opened out successive objects with the swiftness of a panorama
so that the adventurers stood speechless The flag spoke for itself it
was no frayed and weathered trophy that had beaten itself to pieces on
the post flying over desolation and to make assurance stronger there
was to be descried in the deep shade of the verandah a glitter of
crystal and the fluttering of white napery If the figurehead at the
pier end with its perpetual gesture and its leprous whiteness reigned
alone in that hamlet as it seemed to do it would not have reigned long
Mens hands had been busy mens feet stirring there within the circuit
of the clock The Farallones were sure of it their eyes dug in the deep
shadow of the palms for some one hiding if intensity of looking might
have prevailed they would have pierced the walls of houses and there
came to them in these pregnant seconds a sense of being watched and
played with and of a blow impending that was hardly bearable

The extreme point of palms they had just passed enclosed a creek which
was thus hidden up to the last moment from the eyes of those on board
and from this a boat put suddenly and briskly out and a voice hailed

Schooner ahoy it cried Stand in for the pier In two cables
lengths youll have twenty fathoms water and good holding ground

The boat was manned with a couple of brown oarsmen in scanty kilts of
blue The speaker who was steering wore white clothes the full dress
of the tropics a wide hat shaded his face but it could be seen that he
was of stalwart size and his voice sounded like a gentlemans So much
could be made out It was plain besides that the Farallone had been
descried some time before at sea and the inhabitants were prepared for
its reception

Mechanically the orders were obeyed and the ship berthed and the three
adventurers gathered aft beside the house and waited with galloping
pulses and a perfect vacancy of mind the coming of the stranger who
might mean so much to them They had no plan no story prepared there
was no time to make one they were caught redhanded and must stand
their chance Yet this anxiety was chequered with hope The island being
undeclared it was not possible the man could hold any office or be in a
position to demand their papers And beyond that if there was any truth
in Findlay as it now seemed there should be he was the representative
of the private reasons he must see their coming with a profound
disappointment and perhaps hope whispered he would be willing and
able to purchase their silence

The boat was by that time forging alongside and they were able at last
to see what manner of man they had to do with He was a huge fellow
six feet four in height and of a build proportionately strong but
his sinews seemed to be dissolved in a listlessness that was more than
languor It was only the eye that corrected this impression an eye
of an unusual mingled brilliancy and softness sombre as coal and
with lights that outshone the topaz an eye of unimpaired health and
virility an eye that bid you beware of the mans devastating anger
A complexion naturally dark had been tanned in the island to a hue
hardly distinguishable from that of a Tahitian only his manners and
movements and the living force that dwelt in him like fire in flint
betrayed the European He was dressed in white drill exquisitely made
his scarf and tie were of tendercoloured silks on the thwart beside
him there leaned a Winchester rifle

Is the doctor on board he cried as he came up Dr Symonds I mean
You never heard of him Nor yet of the Trinity Hall Ah

He did not look surprised seemed rather to affect it in politeness
but his eye rested on each of the three white men in succession with a
sudden weight of curiosity that was almost savage Ah THEN said he
there is some small mistake no doubt and I must ask you to what I am
indebted for this pleasure

He was by this time on the deck but he had the art to be quite
unapproachable the friendliest vulgarian three parts drunk would have
known better than take liberties and not one of the adventurers so much
as offered to shake hands

Well said Davis I suppose you may call it an accident We had heard
of your island and read that thing in the Directory about the PRIVATE
REASONS you see so when we saw the lagoon reflected in the sky we put
her head for it at once and so here we are

Ope we dont intrude said Huish

The stranger looked at Huish with an air of faint surprise and looked
pointedly away again It was hard to be more offensive in dumb show

It may suit me your coming here he said My own schooner is
overdue and I may put something in your way in the meantime Are you
open to a charter

Well I guess so said Davis it depends

My name is Attwater continued the stranger You I presume are the
captain

Yes sir I am the captain of this ship Captain Brown was the reply

Well see ere said Huish better begin fair Es skipper on deck
right enough but not below Below were all equal all got a lay in
the adventure when it comes to business Im as good as e and what I
say is lets go into the ouse and have a lush and talk it over among
pals Weve some prime fizz he said and winked

The presence of the gentleman lighted up like a candle the vulgarity of
the clerk and Herrick instinctively as one shields himself from pain
made haste to interrupt

My name is Hay said he since introductions are going We shall be
very glad if you will step inside

Attwater leaned to him swiftly University man said he

Yes Merton said Herrick and the next moment blushed scarlet at his
indiscretion

I am of the other lot said Attwater Trinity Hall Cambridge I
called my schooner after the old shop Well this is a queer place and
company for us to meet in Mr Hay he pursued with easy incivility to
the others But do you bear out  I beg this gentlemans pardon I
really did not catch his name

My name is Uish sir returned the clerk and blushed in turn

Ah said Attwater And then turning again to Herrick Do you bear out
Mr Whishs description of your vintage or was it only the unaffected
poetry of his own nature bubbling up

Herrick was embarrassed the silken brutality of their visitor made
him blush that he should be accepted as an equal and the others thus
pointedly ignored pleased him in spite of himself and then ran through
his veins in a recoil of anger

I dont know he said Its only California its good enough I
believe

Attwater seemed to make up his mind Well then Ill tell you what you
three gentlemen come ashore this evening and bring a basket of wine with
you Ill try and find the food he said And by the by here is a
question I should have asked you when I come on board have you had
smallpox

Personally no said Herrick But the schooner had it

Deaths from Attwater

Two said Herrick

Well it is a dreadful sickness said Attwater

Ad you any deaths asked Huish ere on the island

Twentynine said Attwater Twentynine deaths and thirtyone cases
out of thirtythree souls upon the islandThats a strange way to
calculate Mr Hay is it not Souls I never say it but it startles me

Oh so thats why everythings deserted said Huish

That is why Mr Whish said Attwater that is why the house is empty
and the graveyard full

Twentynine out of thirtythree exclaimed Herrick Why when it came
to buryingor did you bother burying

Scarcely said Attwater or there was one day at least when we gave
up There were five of the dead that morning and thirteen of the dying
and no one able to go about except the sexton and myself We held a
council of war took the empty bottles into the lagoon and buried
them He looked over his shoulder back at the bright water Well
so youll come to dinner then Shall we say halfpast six So good of
you

His voice in uttering these conventional phrases fell at once into
the false measure of society and Herrick unconsciously followed the
example

I am sure we shall be very glad he said At halfpast six Thank you
so very much

 For my voice has been tuned to the note of the gun

 That startles the deep when the combats begun

quoted Attwater with a smile which instantly gave way to an air
of funereal solemnity I shall particularly expect Mr Whish he
continued Mr Whish I trust you understand the invitation

I believe you my boy replied the genial Huish

That is right then and quite understood is it not said Attwater
Mr Whish and Captain Brown at sixthirty without faultand you Hay
at four sharp

And he called his boat

During all this talk a load of thought or anxiety had weighed upon the
captain There was no part for which nature had so liberally endowed
him as that of the genial ship captain But today he was silent and
abstracted Those who knew him could see that he hearkened close to
every syllable and seemed to ponder and try it in balances It
would have been hard to say what look there was cold attentive and
sinister as of a man maturing plans which still brooded over the
unconscious guest it was here it was there it was nowhere it was now
so little that Herrick chid himself for an idle fancy and anon it was
so gross and palpable that you could say every hair on the mans head
talked mischief

He woke up now as with a start You were talking of a charter said
he

Was I said Attwater Well lets talk of it no more at present

Your own schooner is overdue I understand continued the captain

You understand perfectly Captain Brown said Attwater thirtythree
days overdue at noon today

She comes and goes eh plies between here and hinted the captain

Exactly every four months three trips in the year said Attwater

You go in her ever asked Davis

No one stops here said Attwater one has plenty to attend to

Stop here do you cried Davis Say how long

How long O Lord said Attwater with perfect stern gravity But it
does not seem so he added with a smile

No I dare say not said Davis No I suppose not Not with all your
gods about you and in as snug a berth as this For it is a pretty snug
berth said he with a sweeping look

The spot as you are good enough to indicate is not entirely
intolerable was the reply

Shell I suppose said Davis

Yes there was shell said Attwater

This is a considerable big beast of a lagoon sir said the captain
Was there awas the fishingwould you call the fishing anyways GOOD

I dont know that I would call it anyways anything said Attwater if
you put it to me direct

There were pearls too said Davis

Pearls too said Attwater

Well I give out laughed Davis and his laughter rang cracked like a
false piece If youre not going to tell youre not going to tell and
theres an end to it

There can be no reason why I should affect the least degree of secrecy
about my island returned Attwater that came wholly to an end with
your arrival and I am sure at any rate that gentlemen like you and Mr
Whish I should have always been charmed to make perfectly at home The
point on which we are now differingif you can call it a differenceis
one of times and seasons I have some information which you think I
might impart and I think not Well well see tonight Byby Whish
He stepped into his boat and shoved off All understood then said
he The captain and Mr Whish at sixthirty and you Hay at four
precise You understand that Hay Mind I take no denial If youre not
there by the time named there will be no banquet no song no supper
Mr Whish

White birds whisked in the air above a shoal of particoloured fishes
in the scarce denser medium below between like Mahomets coffin the
boat drew away briskly on the surface and its shadow followed it over
the glittering floor of the lagoon Attwater looked steadily back
over his shoulders as he sat he did not once remove his eyes from the
Farallone and the group on her quarterdeck beside the house till
his boat ground upon the pier Thence with an agile pace he hurried
ashore and they saw his white clothes shining in the chequered dusk of
the grove until the house received him

The captain with a gesture and a speaking countenance called the
adventurers into the cabin

Well he said to Herrick when they were seated theres one good job
at least Hes taken to you in earnest

Why should that be a good job said Herrick

Oh youll see how it pans out presently returned Davis You go
ashore and stand in with him thats all Youll get lots of pointers
you can find out what he has and what the charter is and whos the
fourth manfor theres four of them and were only three

And suppose I do what next cried Herrick Answer me that

So I will Robert Herrick said the captain But first lets see all
clear I guess you know he said with an imperious solemnity I guess
you know the bottom is out of this Farallone speculation I guess you
know its RIGHT out and if this old island hadnt been turned up right
when it did I guess you know where you and I and Huish would have
been

Yes I know that said Herrick No matter whos to blame I know it
And what next

No matter whos to blame you know it right enough said the captain
and Im obliged to you for the reminder Now heres this Attwater what
do you think of him

I do not know said Herrick I am attracted and repelled He was
insufferably rude to you

And you Huish said the captain

Huish sat cleaning a favourite briar root he scarce looked up from that
engrossing task Dont ast me what I think of him he said Theres a
day comin I pray Gawd when I can tell it him myself

Huish means the same as what I do said Davis When that man came
stepping around and saying Look here Im Attwaterand you knew it
was so by GodI sized him right straight up Heres the real
article I said and I dont like it heres the real firstrate
copperbottomed aristocrat AW I DONT KNOW YE DO I GOD DAMN YE DID
GOD MAKE YE No that couldnt be nothing but genuine a man got to be
born to that and notice smart as champagne and hard as nails no kind
of a fool no SIR not a pound of him Well whats he here upon this
beastly island for I said HES not here collecting eggs Hes a palace
at home and powdered flunkies and if he dont stay there you bet he
knows the reason why Follow

O yes I ear you said Huish

Hes been doing good business here then continued the captain For
ten years hes been doing a great business Its pearl and shell of
course there couldnt be nothing else in such a place and no doubt
the shell goes off regularly by this Trinity Hall and the money for it
straight into the bank so thats no use to us But what else is there
Is there nothing else he would be likely to keep here Is there nothing
else he would be bound to keep here Yes sir the pearls First
because theyre too valuable to trust out of his hands Second because
pearls want a lot of handling and matching and the man who sells his
pearls as they come in one here one there instead of hanging back and
holding upwell that mans a fool and its not Attwater

Likely said Huish thats wat it is not proved but likely

Its proved said Davis bluntly

Suppose it was said Herrick Suppose that was all so and he had
these pearlsa ten years collection of themSuppose he had Theres
my question

The captain drummed with his thick hands on the board in front of him
he looked steadily in Herricks face and Herrick as steadily looked
upon the table and the pattering fingers there was a gentle oscillation
of the anchored ship and a big patch of sunlight travelled to and fro
between the one and the other

Hear me Herrick burst out suddenly

No you better hear me first said Davis Hear me and understand me
WEVE got no use for that fellow whatever you may have Hes your kind
hes not ours hes took to you and hes wiped his boots on me and
Huish Save him if you can

Save him repeated Herrick

Save him if youre able reiterated Davis with a blow of his
clenched fist Go ashore and talk him smooth and if you get him and
his pearls aboard Ill spare him If you dont theres going to be a
funeral Is that so Huish does that suit you

I aint a forgiving man said Huish but Im not the sort to spoil
business neither Bring the bloke on board and bring his pearls along
with him and you can have it your own way maroon him where you
likeIm agreeable

Well and if I cant cried Herrick while the sweat streamed upon his
face You talk to me as if I was God Almighty to do this and that But
if I cant

My son said the captain you better do your level best or youll
see sights

O yes said Huish O crikey yes He looked across at Herrick with
a toothless smile that was shocking in its savagery and his ear caught
apparently by the trivial expression he had used broke into a piece of
the chorus of a comic song which he must have heard twenty years before
in London meaningless gibberish that in that hour and place seemed
hateful as a blasphemy Hikey pikey crikey fikey chillingawallaba
dory

The captain suffered him to finish his face was unchanged

The way things are theres many a man that wouldnt let you go
ashore he resumed But Im not that kind I know youd never go back
on me Herrick Or if you choose togo and do it and be damned he
cried and rose abruptly from the table

He walked out of the house and as he reached the door turned and
called Huish suddenly and violently like the barking of a dog Huish
followed and Herrick remained alone in the cabin

Now see here whispered Davis I know that man If you open your
mouth to him again youll ruin all



Chapter 8 BETTER ACQUAINTANCE

The boat was gone again and already halfway to the Farallone before
Herrick turned and went unwillingly up the pier From the crown of
the beach the figurehead confronted him with what seemed irony
her helmeted head tossed back her formidable arm apparently hurling
something whether shell or missile in the direction of the anchored
schooner She seemed a defiant deity from the island coming forth to
its threshold with a rush as of one about to fly and perpetuated in
that dashing attitude Herrick looked up at her where she towered above
him head and shoulders with singular feelings of curiosity and romance
and suffered his mind to travel to and fro in her lifehistory So long
she had been the blind conductress of a ship among the waves so long
she had stood here idle in the violent sun that yet did not avail
to blister her and was even this the end of so many adventures he
wondered or was more behind And he could have found in his heart to
regret that she was not a goddess nor yet he a pagan that he might
have bowed down before her in that hour of difficulty

When he now went forward it was cool with the shadow of many wellgrown
palms draughts of the dying breeze swung them together overhead and on
all sides with a swiftness beyond dragonflies or swallows the spots
of sunshine flitted and hovered and returned Underfoot the sand was
fairly solid and quite level and Herricks steps fell there noiseless
as in newfallen snow It bore the marks of having been once weeded like
a garden alley at home but the pestilence had done its work and the
weeds were returning The buildings of the settlement showed here and
there through the stems of the colonnade fresh painted trim and dandy
and all silent as the grave Only here and there in the crypt there
was a rustle and scurry and some crowing of poultry and from behind the
house with the verandahs he saw smoke arise and heard the crackling of
a fire

The stone houses were nearest him upon his right The first was locked
in the second he could dimly perceive through a window a certain
accumulation of pearlshell piled in the far end the third which stood
gaping open on the afternoon seized on the mind of Herrick with its
multiplicity and disorder of romantic things Therein were cables
windlasses and blocks of every size and capacity cabin windows and
ladders rusty tanks a companion hutch a binnacle with its brass
mountings and its compass idly pointing in the confusion and dusk of
that shed to a forgotten pole ropes anchors harpoons a blubber
dipper of copper green with years a steering wheel a tool chest with
the vessels name upon the top the Asia a whole curiosityshop of sea
curios gross and solid heavy to lift ill to break bound with brass
and shod with iron Two wrecks at the least must have contributed to
this random heap of lumber and as Herrick looked upon it it seemed to
him as if the two ships companies were there on guard and he heard
the tread of feet and whisperings and saw with the tail of his eye the
commonplace ghosts of sailor men

This was not merely the work of an aroused imagination but had
something sensible to go upon sounds of a stealthy approach were no
doubt audible and while he still stood staring at the lumber the voice
of his host sounded suddenly and with even more than the customary
softness of enunciation from behind

Junk it said only old junk And does Mr Hay find a parable

I find at least a strong impression replied Herrick turning quickly
lest he might be able to catch on the face of the speaker some
commentary on the words

Attwater stood in the doorway which he almost wholly filled his hands
stretched above his head and grasping the architrave He smiled when
their eyes Met but the expression was inscrutable

Yes a powerful impression You are like me nothing so affecting as
ships said he The ruins of an empire would leave me frigid when a
bit of an old rail that an old shellback leaned on in the middle watch
would bring me up all standing But come lets see some more of the
island Its all sand and coral and palm trees but theres a kind of a
quaintness in the place

I find it heavenly said Herrick breathing deep with head bared in
the shadow

Ah thats because youre new from sea said Attwater I dare say
too you can appreciate what one calls it Its a lovely name It has
a flavour it has a colour it has a ring and fall to it its like its
authorits half Christian Remember your first view of the island and
how its only woods and water and suppose you had asked somebody for
the name and he had answerednemorosa Zacynthos

Jam medio apparet fluctu exclaimed Herrick Ye gods yes how good

If it gets upon the chart the skippers will make nice work of it
said Attwater But here come and see the divingshed

He opened a door and Herrick saw a large display of apparatus neatly
ordered pumps and pipes and the leaded boots and the huge snouted
helmets shining in rows along the wall ten complete outfits

The whole eastern half of my lagoon is shallow you must understand
said Attwater so we were able to get in the dress to great advantage
It paid beyond belief and was a queer sight when they were at it
and these marine monsterstapping the nearest of the helmetskept
appearing and reappearing in the midst of the lagoon Fond of parables
he asked abruptly

O yes said Herrick

Well I saw these machines come up dripping and go down again and come
up dripping and go down again and all the while the fellow inside as
dry as toast said Attwater and I thought we all wanted a dress to
go down into the world in and come up scatheless What do you think the
name was he inquired

Selfconceit said Herrick

Ah but I mean seriously said Attwater

Call it selfrespect then corrected Herrick with a laugh

And why not Grace Why not Gods Grace Hay asked Attwater Why
not the grace of your Maker and Redeemer He who died for you He
who upholds you He whom you daily crucify afresh There is nothing
herestriking on his bosomnothing theresmiting the walland
nothing therestampingnothing but Gods Grace We walk upon it we
breathe it we live and die by it it makes the nails and axles of the
universe and a puppy in pyjamas prefers selfconceit The huge dark
man stood over against Herrick by the line of the divers helmets and
seemed to swell and glow and the next moment the life had gone from
him I beg your pardon said he I see you dont believe in God

Not in your sense I am afraid said Herrick

I never argue with young atheists or habitual drunkards said Attwater
flippantly Let us go across the island to the outer beach

It was but a little way the greatest width of that island scarce
exceeding a furlong and they walked gently Herrick was like one in
a dream He had come there with a mind divided come prepared to study
that ambiguous and sneering mask drag out the essential man from
underneath and act accordingly decision being till then postponed
Iron cruelty an iron insensibility to the suffering of others the
uncompromising pursuit of his own interests cold culture manners
without humanity these he had looked for these he still thought he
saw But to find the whole machine thus glow with the reverberation of
religious zeal surprised him beyond words and he laboured in vain as
he walked to piece together into any kind of whole his odds and ends
of knowledgeto adjust again into any kind of focus with itself his
picture of the man beside him

What brought you here to the South Seas he asked presently

Many things said Attwater Youth curiosity romance the love of
the sea and it will surprise you to hear an interest in missions
That has a good deal declined which will surprise you less They go the
wrong way to work they are too parsonish too much of the old wife and
even the old apple wife CLOTHES CLOTHES are their idea but clothes
are not Christianity any more than they are the sun in heaven or could
take the place of it They think a parsonage with roses and church
bells and nice old women bobbing in the lanes are part and parcel
of religion But religion is a savage thing like the universe it
illuminates savage cold and bare but infinitely strong

And you found this island by an accident said Herrick

As you did said Attwater And since then I have had a business and
a colony and a mission of my own I was a man of the world before I was
a Christian Im a man of the world still and I made my mission pay
No good ever came of coddling A man has to stand up in Gods sight
and work up to his weight avoirdupois then Ill talk to him but not
before I gave these beggars what they wanted a judge in Israel the
bearer of the sword and scourge I was making a new people here and
behold the angel of the Lord smote them and they were not

With the very uttering of the words which were accompanied by a
gesture they came forth out of the porch of the palm wood by the margin
of the sea and full in front of the sun which was near setting Before
them the surf broke slowly All around with an air of imperfect wooden
things inspired with wicked activity the crabs trundled and scuttled
into holes On the right whither Attwater pointed and abruptly turned
was the cemetery of the island a field of broken stones from the
bigness of a childs hand to that of his head diversified by many
mounds of the same material and walled by a rude rectangular enclosure
Nothing grew there but a shrub or two with some white flowers nothing
but the number of the mounds and their disquieting shape indicated the
presence of the dead

 The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep

quoted Attwater as he entered by the open gateway into that unholy
close Coral to coral pebbles to pebbles he said this has been the
main scene of my activity in the South Pacific Some were good and some
bad and the majority of course and always null Here was a fellow
now that used to frisk like a dog if you had called him he came like
an arrow from a bow if you had not and he came unbidden you should
have seen the deprecating eye and the little intricate dancing
step Well his trouble is over now he has lain down with kings and
councillors the rest of his acts are they not written in the book
of the chronicles That fellow was from Penrhyn like all the Penrhyn
islanders he was ill to manage heady jealous violent the man with
the nose He lies here quiet enough And so they all lie

 And darkness was the burier of the dead

He stood in the strong glow of the sunset with bowed head his voice
sounded now sweet and now bitter with the varying sense

You loved these people cried Herrick strangely touched

I said Attwater Dear no Dont think me a philanthropist I dislike
men and hate women If I like the islands at all it is because you see
them here plucked of their lendings their dead birds and cocked hats
their petticoats and coloured hose Here was one I liked though and he
set his foot upon a mound He was a fine savage fellow he had a dark
soul yes I liked this one I am fanciful he added looking hard at
Herrick and I take fads I like you

Herrick turned swiftly and looked far away to where the clouds were
beginning to troop together and amass themselves round the obsequies of
day No one can like me he said

You are wrong there said the other as a man usually is about
himself You are attractive very attractive

It is not me said Herrick no one can like me If you knew how I
despised myselfand why His voice rang out in the quiet graveyard

I knew that you despised yourself said Attwater I saw the blood
come into your face today when you remembered Oxford And I could have
blushed for you myself to see a man a gentleman with these two vulgar
wolves

Herrick faced him with a thrill Wolves he repeated

I said wolves and vulgar wolves said Attwater Do you know that
today when I came on board I trembled

You concealed it well stammered Herrick

A habit of mine said Attwater But I was afraid for all that I was
afraid of the two wolves He raised his hand slowly And now Hay you
poor lost puppy what do you do with the two wolves

What do I do I dont do anything said Herrick There is nothing
wrong all is above board Captain Brown is a good soul he is a he
is The phantom voice of Davis called in his ear Theres going to
be a funeral and the sweat burst forth and streamed on his brow He
is a family man he resumed again swallowing he has children at
homeand a wife

And a very nice man said Attwater And so is Mr Whish no doubt

I wont go so far as that said Herrick I do not like Huish And
yet he has his merits too

And in short take them for all in all as good a ships company as
one would ask said Attwater

O yes said Herrick quite

So then we approach the other point of why you despise yourself said
Attwater

Do we not all despise ourselves cried Herrick Do not you

Oh I say I do But do I said Attwater One thing I know at least
I never gave a cry like yours Hay it came from a bad conscience Ah
man that poor diving dress of selfconceit is sadly tattered Today
now while the sun sets and here in this burying place of brown
innocents fall on your knees and cast your sins and sorrows on the
Redeemer Hay

Not Hay interrupted the other strangling Dont call me that I
mean For Gods sake cant you see Im on the rack

I see it I know it I put and keep you there my fingers are on the
screws said Attwater Please God I will bring a penitent this
night before His throne Come come to the mercyseat He waits to be
gracious manwaits to be gracious

He spread out his arms like a crucifix his face shone with the
brightness of a seraphs in his voice as it rose to the last word the
tears seemed ready

Herrick made a vigorous call upon himself Attwater he said you
push me beyond bearing What am I to do I do not believe It is living
truth to you to me upon my conscience only folklore I do not
believe there is any form of words under heaven by which I can lift the
burthen from my shoulders I must stagger on to the end with the pack of
my responsibility I cannot shift it do you suppose I would not if I
thought I could I cannotcannotcannotand let that suffice

The rapture was all gone from Artwaters countenance the dark apostle
had disappeared and in his place there stood an easy sneering
gentleman who took off his hat and bowed It was pertly done and the
blood burned in Herricks face

What do you mean by that he cried

Well shall we go back to the house said Attwater Our guests will
soon be due

Herrick stood his ground a moment with clenched fists and teeth and as
he so stood the fact of his errand there slowly swung clear in front of
him like the moon out of clouds He had come to lure that man on board
he was failing even if it could be said that he had tried he was sure
to fail now and knew it and knew it was better so And what was to be
next

With a groan he turned to follow his host who was standing with polite
smile and instantly and somewhat obsequiously led the way in the now
darkened colonnade of palms There they went in silence the earth
gave up richly of her perfume the air tasted warm and aromatic in the
nostrils and from a great way forward in the wood the brightness of
lights and fire marked out the house of Attwater

Herrick meanwhile resolved and resisted an immense temptation to go up
to touch him on the arm and breathe a word in his ear Beware they are
going to murder you There would be one life saved but what of the two
others The three lives went up and down before him like buckets in a
well or like the scales of balances It had come to a choice and one
that must be speedy For certain invaluable minutes the wheels of life
ran before him and he could still divert them with a touch to the one
side or the other still choose who was to live and who was to die He
considered the men Attwater intrigued puzzled dazzled enchanted and
revolted him alive he seemed but a doubtful good and the thought of
him lying dead was so unwelcome that it pursued him like a vision with
every circumstance of colour and sound Incessantly he had before him
the image of that great mass of man stricken down in varying attitudes
and with varying wounds fallen prone fallen supine fallen on his
side or clinging to a doorpost with the changing face and the relaxing
fingers of the deathagony He heard the click of the trigger the thud
of the ball the cry of the victim he saw the blood flow And this
building up of circumstance was like a consecration of the man till he
seemed to walk in sacrificial fillets Next he considered Davis with
his thickfingered coarsegrained oatbread commonness of nature his
indomitable valour and mirth in the old days of their starvation the
endearing blend of his faults and virtues the sudden shining forth of a
tenderness that lay too deep for tears his children Adar and her bowel
complaint and Adars doll No death could not be suffered to approach
that head even in fancy with a general heat and a bracing of his
muscles it was borne in on Herrick that Adars father would find in him
a son to the death And even Huish showed a little in that sacredness
by the tacit adoption of daily life they were become brothers there was
an implied bond of loyalty in their cohabitation of the ship and their
passed miseries to which Herrick must be a little true or wholly
dishonoured Horror of sudden death for horror of sudden death there
was here no hesitation possible it must be Attwater And no sooner was
the thought formed which was a sentence than his whole mind of man ran
in a panic to the other side and when he looked within himself he was
aware only of turbulence and inarticulate outcry

In all this there was no thought of Robert Herrick He had complied with
the ebbtide in mans affairs and the tide had carried him away he
heard already the roaring of the maelstrom that must hurry him under
And in his bedevilled and dishonoured soul there was no thought of self

For how long he walked silent by his companion Herrick had no guess
The clouds rolled suddenly away the orgasm was over he found himself
placid with the placidity of despair there returned to him the power of
commonplace speech and he heard with surprise his own voice say What
a lovely evening

Is it not said Attwater Yes the evenings here would be very
pleasant if one had anything to do By day of course one can shoot

You shoot asked Herrick

Yes I am what you would call a fine shot said Attwater It is
faith I believe my balls will go true if I were to miss once it would
spoil me for nine months

You never miss then said Herrick

Not unless I mean to said Attwater But to miss nicely is the art
There was an old king one knew in the western islands who used to empty
a Winchester all round a man and stir his hair or nick a rag out of his
clothes with every ball except the last and that went plump between the
eyes It was pretty practice

You could do that asked Herrick with a sudden chill

Oh I can do anything returned the other You do not understand
what must be must

They were now come near to the back part of the house One of the men
was engaged about the cooking fire which burned with the clear fierce
essential radiance of cocoanut shells A fragrance of strange meats was
in the air All round in the verandahs lamps were lighted so that
the place shone abroad in the dusk of the trees with many complicated
patterns of shadow

Come and wash your hands said Attwater and led the way into a clean
matted room with a cot bed a safe or shelf or two of books in a glazed
case and an iron washingstand Presently he cried in the native and
there appeared for a moment in the doorway a plump and pretty young
woman with a clean towel

Hullo cried Herrick who now saw for the first time the fourth
survivor of the pestilence and was startled by the recollection of the
captains orders

Yes said Attwater the whole colony lives about the house whats
left of it We are all afraid of devils if you please and Taniera and
she sleep in the front parlour and the other boy on the verandah

She is pretty said Herrick

Too pretty said Attwater That was why I had her married A man
never knows when he may be inclined to be a fool about women so when we
were left alone I had the pair of them to the chapel and performed the
ceremony She made a lot of fuss I do not take at all the romantic view
of marriage he explained

And that strikes you as a safeguard asked Herrick with amazement

Certainly I am a plain man and very literal WHOM GOD HATH JOINED
TOGETHER are the words I fancy So one married them and respects the
marriage said Attwater

Ah said Herrick

You see I may look to make an excellent marriage when I go home
began Attwater confidentially I am rich This safe alonelaying his
hand upon itwill be a moderate fortune when I have the time to place
the pearls upon the market Here are ten years accumulation from a
lagoon where I have had as many as ten divers going all day long and I
went further than people usually do in these waters for I rotted a lot
of shell and did splendidly Would you like to see them

This confirmation of the captains guess hit Herrick hard and he
contained himself with difficulty No thank you I think not said
he I do not care for pearls I am very indifferent to all these

Gewgaws suggested Attwater And yet I believe you ought to cast an
eye on my collection which is really unique and whichoh it is the
case with all of us and everything about ushangs by a hair Today
it groweth up and flourisheth tomorrow it is cut down and cast into the
oven Today it is here and together in this safe tomorrowtonightit
may be scattered Thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of
thee

I do not understand you said Herrick

Not said Attwater

You seem to speak in riddles said Herrick unsteadily I do not
understand what manner of man you are nor what you are driving at

Attwater stood with his hands upon his hips and his head bent forward
I am a fatalist he replied and just now if you insist on it
an experimentalist Talking of which by the bye who painted out the
schooners name he said with mocking softness because do you know
one thinks it should be done again It can still be partly read and
whatever is worth doing is surely worth doing well You think with
me That is so nice Well shall we step on the verandah I have a dry
sherry that I would like your opinion of

Herrick followed him forth to where under the light of the hanging
lamps the table shone with napery and crystal followed him as the
criminal goes with the hangman or the sheep with the butcher took the
sherry mechanically drank it and spoke mechanical words of praise The
object of his terror had become suddenly inverted till then he had seen
Attwater trussed and gagged a helpless victim and had longed to run in
and save him he saw him now tower up mysterious and menacing the angel
of the Lords wrath armed with knowledge and threatening judgment He
set down his glass again and was surprised to see it empty

You go always armed he said and the next moment could have plucked
his tongue out

Always said Attwater I have been through a mutiny here that was
one of my incidents of missionary life

And just then the sound of voices reached them and looking forth from
the verandah they saw Huish and the captain drawing near



Chapter 9 THE DINNER PARTY

They sat down to an island dinner remarkable for its variety and
excellence turtle soup and steak fish fowls a sucking pig a
cocoanut salad and sprouting cocoanut roasted for dessert Not a tin
had been opened and save for the oil and vinegar in the salad and some
green spears of onion which Attwater cultivated and plucked with his own
hand not even the condiments were European Sherry hock and claret
succeeded each other and the Farallone champagne brought up the rear
with the dessert

It was plain that like so many of the extremely religious in the
days before teetotalism Attwater had a dash of the epicure For such
characters it is softening to eat well doubly so to have designed and
had prepared an excellent meal for others and the manners of their host
were agreeably mollified in consequence

A cat of huge growth sat on his shoulders purring and occasionally
with a deft paw capturing a morsel in the air To a cat he might be
likened himself as he lolled at the head of his table dealing
out attentions and innuendoes and using the velvet and the claw
indifferently And both Huish and the captain fell progressively under
the charm of his hospitable freedom

Over the third guest the incidents of the dinner may be said to have
passed for long unheeded Herrick accepted all that was offered him ate
and drank without tasting and heard without comprehension His mind
was singly occupied in contemplating the horror of the circumstances in
which he sat What Attwater knew what the captain designed from which
side treachery was to be first expected these were the ground of his
thoughts There were times when he longed to throw down the table and
flee into the night And even that was debarred him to do anything
to say anything to move at all were only to precipitate the barbarous
tragedy and he sat spellbound eating with white lips Two of his
companions observed him narrowly Attwater with raking sidelong glances
that did not interrupt his talk the captain with a heavy and anxious
consideration

Well I must say this sherry is a really prime article said Huish
Ow much does it stand you in if its a fair question

A hundred and twelve shillings in London and the freight to
Valparaiso and on again said Attwater It strikes one as really not
a bad fluid

A undred and twelve murmured the clerk relishing the wine and the
figures in a common ecstasy O my

So glad you like it said Attwater Help yourself Mr Whish and keep
the bottle by you

My friends name is Huish and not Whish sit said the captain with a
flush

I beg your pardon I am sure Huish and not Whish certainly said
Attwater I was about to say that I have still eight dozen he added
fixing the captain with his eye

Eight dozen what said Davis

Sherry was the reply Eight dozen excellent sherry Why it seems
almost worth it in itself to a man fond of wine

The ambiguous words struck home to guilty consciences and Huish and the
captain sat up in their places and regarded him with a scare

Worth what said Davis

A hundred and twelve shillings replied Attwater

The captain breathed hard for a moment He reached out far and wide to
find any coherency in these remarks then with a great effort changed
the subject

I allow we are about the first white men upon this island sir said
he

Attwater followed him at once and with entire gravity to the new
ground Myself and Dr Symonds excepted I should say the only ones he
returned And yet who can tell In the course of the ages someone may
have lived here and we sometimes think that someone must The cocoa
palms grow all round the island which is scarce like natures planting
We found besides when we landed an unmistakable cairn upon the beach
use unknown but probably erected in the hope of gratifying some mumbo
jumbo whose very name is forgotten by some thickwitted gentry whose
very bones are lost Then the island witness the Directory has been
twice reported and since my tenancy we have had two wrecks both
derelict The rest is conjecture

Dr Symonds is your partner I guess said Davis

A dear fellow Symonds How he would regret it if he knew you had been
here said Attwater

Es on the Trinity All aint he asked Huish

And if you could tell me where the Trinity All was you would confer a
favour Mr Whish was the reply

I suppose she has a native crew said Davis

Since the secret has been kept ten years one would suppose she had
replied Attwater

Well now see ere said Huish You have everything about you in
no end style and no mistake but I tell you it wouldnt do for me Too
much of the old rustic bridge by the mill too retired by alf Give
me the sound of Bow Bells

You must not think it was always so replied Attwater This was once
a busy shore although now hark you can hear the solitude I find it
stimulating And talking of the sound of bells kindly follow a little
experiment of mine in silence There was a silver bell at his right
hand to call the servants he made them a sign to stand still struck
the bell with force and leaned eagerly forward The note rose clear and
strong it rang out clear and far into the night and over the deserted
island it died into the distance until there only lingered in the
porches of the ear a vibration that was sound no longer Empty houses
empty sea solitary beaches said Attwater And yet God hears the
bell And yet we sit in this verandah on a lighted stage with all heaven
for spectators And you call that solitude

There followed a bar of silence during which the captain sat
mesmerised

Then Attwater laughed softly These are the diversions of a lonely
man he resumed and possibly not in good taste One tells oneself
these little fairy tales for company If there SHOULD happen to be
anything in folklore Mr Hay But here comes the claret One does not
offer you Lafitte captain because I believe it is all sold to the
railroad dining cars in your great country but this BrineMouton is of
a good year and Mr Whish will give me news of it

Thats a queer idea of yours cried the captain bursting with a sigh
from the spell that had bound him So you mean to tell me now that
you sit here evenings and ring up well ring on the angels by
yourself

As a matter of historic fact and since you put it directly one does
not said Attwater Why ring a bell when there flows out from oneself
and everything about one a far more momentous silence the least beat of
my heart and the least thought in my mind echoing into eternity for ever
and for ever and for ever

O look ere said Huish turn down the lights at once and the Band
of Ope will oblige This aint a spiritual seance

No folklore about Mr WhishI beg your pardon captain Huish not
Whish of course said Attwater

As the boy was filling Huishs glass the bottle escaped from his hand
and was shattered and the wine spilt on the verandah floor Instant
grimness as of death appeared on the face of Attwater he smote the
bell imperiously and the two brown natives fell into the attitude
of attention and stood mute and trembling There was just a moment of
silence and hard looks then followed a few savage words in the native
and upon a gesture of dismissal the service proceeded as before

None of the party had as yet observed upon the excellent bearing of the
two men They were dark undersized and well set up stepped softly
waited deftly brought on the wines and dishes at a look and their eyes
attended studiously on their master

Where do you get your labour from anyway asked Davis

Ah where not answered Attwater

Not much of a soft job I suppose said the captain

If you will tell me where getting labour is said Attwater with a
shrug And of course in our case as we could name no destination
we had to go far and wide and do the best we could We have gone as far
west as the Kingsmills and as far south as Rapaiti Pity Symonds isnt
here He is full of yarns That was his part to collect them Then
began mine which was the educational

You mean to run them said Davis

Ay to run them said Attwater

Wait a bit said Davis Im out of my depth How was this Do you
mean to say you did it singlehanded


One did it singlehanded said Attwater because there was nobody to
help one

By God but you must be a holy terror cried the captain in a glow of
admiration

One does ones best said Attwater

Well now said Davis I have seen a lot of driving in my time and
been counted a good driver myself I fought my way third mate round
the Cape Horn with a push of packet rats that would have turned the
devil out of hell and shut the door on him and I tell you this racket
of Mr Attwaters takes the cake In a ship why there aint nothing to
it Youve got the law with you thats what does it But put me down on
this blame beach alone with nothing but a whip and a mouthful of bad
words and ask me to no SIR its not good enough I havent got the
sand for that cried Davis Its the law behind he added its the
law does it every time

The beak aint as black as hes sometimes pynted observed Huish
humorously

Well one got the law after a fashion said Attwater One had to be a
number of things It was sometimes rather a bore

I should smile said Davis Rather lively I should think

I dare say we mean the same thing said Attwater However one way
or another one got it knocked into their heads that they MUST work and
they DID until the Lord took them

Ope you made em jump said Huish

When it was necessary Mr Whish I made them jump said Attwater

You bet you did cried the captain He was a good deal flushed but
not so much with wine as admiration and his eyes drank in the huge
proportions of the other with delight You bet you did and you bet
that I can see you doing it By God youre a man and you can say I
said so

Too good of you Im sure said Attwater

Did youdid you ever have crime here asked Herrick breaking his
silence with a pungent voice

Yes said Attwater we did

And how did you handle that sir cried the eager captain

Well you see it was a queer case replied Attwater it was a case
that would have puzzled Solomon Shall I tell it you yes

The captain rapturously accepted

Well drawled Attwater here is what it was I dare say you know two
types of natives which may be called the obsequious and the sullen
Well one had them the types themselves detected in the fact and one
had them together Obsequiousness ran out of the first like wine out
of a bottle sullenness congested in the second Obsequiousness was all
smiles he ran to catch your eye he loved to gabble and he had about
a dozen words of beach English and an eighthofaninch veneer of
Christianity Sullens was industrious a big downlooking bee When
he was spoken to he answered with a black look and a shrug of one
shoulder but the thing would be done I dont give him to you for a
model of manners there was nothing showy about Sullens but he was
strong and steady and ungraciously obedient Now Sullens got into
trouble no matter how the regulations of the place were broken and
he was punished accordinglywithout effect So the next day and the
next and the day after till I began to be weary of the business and
Sullens I am afraid particularly so There came a day when he was in
fault again for theoh perhaps the thirtieth time and he rolled a
dull eye upon me with a spark in it and appeared to speak Now
the regulations of the place are formal upon one point we allow no
explanations none are received none allowed to be offered So one
stopped him instantly but made a note of the circumstance The next
day he was gone from the settlement There could be nothing more
annoying if the labour took to running away the fishery was wrecked
There are sixty miles of this island you see all in length like the
Queens Highway the idea of pursuit in such a place was a piece of
singleminded childishness which one did not entertain Two days later
I made a discovery it came in upon me with a flash that Sullens had
been unjustly punished from beginning to end and the real culprit
throughout had been Obsequiousness The native who talks like the woman
who hesitates is lost You set him talking and lying and he talks and
lies and watches your face to see if he has pleased you till at
last out comes the truth It came out of Obsequiousness in the regular
course I said nothing to him I dismissed him and late as it was for
it was already night set off to look for Sullens I had not far to go
about two hundred yards up the island the moon showed him to me He was
hanging in a cocoa palmIm not botanist enough to tell you howbut
its the way in nine cases out of ten these natives commit suicide
His tongue was out poor devil and the birds had got at him I spare
you details he was an ugly sight I gave the business six good hours of
thinking in this verandah My justice had been made a fool of I dont
suppose that I was ever angrier Next day I had the conch sounded and
all hands out before sunrise One took ones gun and led the way with
Obsequiousness He was very talkative the beggar supposed that all was
right now he had confessed in the old schoolboy phrase he was
plainly sucking up to me full of protestations of goodwill and
good behaviour to which one answered one really cant remember what
Presently the tree came in sight and the hanged man They all burst out
lamenting for their comrade in the island way and Obsequiousness was
the loudest of the mourners He was quite genuine a noxious creature
without any consciousness of guilt Well presentlyto make a long
story shortone told him to go up the tree He stared a bit looked at
one with a trouble in his eye and had rather a sickly smile but went
He was obedient to the last he had all the pretty virtues but the
truth was not in him So soon as he was up he looked down and there
was the rifle covering him and at that he gave a whimper like a dog
You could bear a pin drop no more keening now There they all crouched
upon the ground with bulging eyes there was he in the tree top the
colour of the lead and between was the dead man dancing a bit in the
air He was obedient to the last recited his crime recommended his
soul to God And then

Attwater paused and Herrick who had been listening attentively made a
convulsive movement which upset his glass

And then said the breathless captain

Shot said Attwater They came to ground together

Herrick sprang to his feet with a shriek and an insensate gesture

It was a murder he screamed A coldhearted bloodyminded
murder You monstrous being Murderer and hypocritemurderer and
hypocritemurderer and hypocrite he repeated and his tongue
stumbled among the words

The captain was by him in a moment Herrick he cried behave
yourself Here dont be a blame fool

Herrick struggled in his embrace like a frantic child and suddenly
bowing his face in his hands choked into a sob the first of many
which now convulsed his body silently and now jerked from him
indescribable and meaningless sounds

Your friend appears overexcited remarked Attwater sitting unmoved
but all alert at table

It must be the wine replied the captain He aint no drinking
man you see II think Ill take him away A walkll sober him up I
guess

He led him without resistance out of the verandah and into the night in
which they soon melted but still for some time as they drew away
his comfortable voice was to be heard soothing and remonstrating and
Herrick answering at intervals with the mechanical noises of hysteria

Es like a bloomin poultry yard observed Huish helping himself to
wine of which he spilled a good deal with gentlemanly ease A man
should learn to beyave at table he added

Rather bad form is it not said Attwater Well well we are left
teteatete A glass of wine with you Mr Whish



Chapter 10 THE OPEN DOOR

The captain and Herrick meanwhile turned their back upon the lights in
Attwaters verandah and took a direction towards the pier and the beach
of the lagoon

The isle at this hour with its smooth floor of sand the pillared roof
overhead and the prevalent illumination of the lamps wore an air of
unreality like a deserted theatre or a public garden at midnight A man
looked about him for the statues and tables Not the least air of wind
was stirring among the palms and the silence was emphasised by the
continuous clamour of the surf from the seashore as it might be of
traffic in the next street

Still talking still soothing him the captain hurried his patient on
brought him at last to the lagoonside and leading him down the beach
laved his head and face with the tepid water The paroxysm gradually
subsided the sobs became less convulsive and then ceased by an odd but
not quite unnatural conjunction the captains soothing current of
talk died away at the same time and by proportional steps and the
pair remained sunk in silence The lagoon broke at their feet in petty
wavelets and with a sound as delicate as a whisper stars of all
degrees looked down on their own images in that vast mirror and the
more angry colour of the Farallones riding lamp burned in the middle
distance For long they continued to gaze on the scene before them and
hearken anxiously to the rustle and tinkle of that miniature surf or
the more distant and loud reverberations from the outer coast For long
speech was denied them and when the words came at last they came to
both simultaneously Say Herrickthe captain was beginning

But Herrick turning swiftly towards his companion bent him down with
the eager cry Lets up anchor captain and to sea

Where to my son said the captain Up anchors easy saying But
where to

To sea responded Herrick The seas big enough To seaaway from
this dreadful island and that oh that sinister man

Oh well see about that said Davis You brace up and well see
about that Youre all run down thats whats wrong with you youre
all nerves like Jemimar youve got to brace up good and be yourself
again and then well talk

To sea reiterated Herrick to sea tonightnowthis moment

It cant be my son replied the captain firmly No ship of mine puts
to sea without provisions you can take that for settled

You dont seem to understand said Herrick The whole thing is over
I tell you There is nothing to do here when he knows all That man
there with the cat knows all cant you take it in

All what asked the captain visibly discomposed Why he received us
like a perfect gentleman and treated us real handsome until you began
with your fooleryand I must say I seen men shot for less and nobody
sorry What more do you expect anyway

Herrick rocked to and fro upon the sand shaking his head

Guying us he said he was guying usonly guying us its all were
good for

There was one queer thing to be sure admitted the captain with a
misgiving of the voice that about the sherry Damned if I caught on to
that Say Herrick you didnt give me away

Oh give you away repeated Herrick with weary querulous scorn What
was there to give away Were transparent weve got rascal branded
on us detected rascaldetected rascal Why before he came on board
there was the name painted out and he saw the whole thing He made sure
we would kill him there and then and stood guying you and Huish on the
chance He calls that being frightened Next he had me ashore a fine
time I had THE TWO WOLVES he calls you and HuishWHAT IS THE PUPPY
DOING WITH THE TWO WOLVES he asked He showed me his pearls he said
they might be dispersed before morning and ALL HUNG BY A HAIrand
smiled as he said it such a smile O its no use I tell you He knows
all he sees through all we only make him laugh with our pretenceshe
looks at us and laughs like God

There was a silence Davis stood with contorted brows gazing into the
night

The pearls he said suddenly He showed them to you he has them

No he didnt show them I forgot only the safe they were in said
Herrick But youll never get them

Ive two words to say to that said the captain

Do you think he would have been so easy at table unless he was
prepared cried Herrick The servants were both armed He was armed
himself he always is he told me You will never deceive his vigilance
Davis I know it Its all up all up Theres nothing for it theres
nothing to be done all gone life honour love Oh my God my God
why was I born

Another pause followed upon this outburst

The captain put his hands to his brow

Another thing he broke out Why did he tell you all this Seems like
madness to me

Herrick shook his head with gloomy iteration You wouldnt understand
if I were to tell you said he

I guess I can understand any blame thing that you can tell me said
the captain

Well then hes a fatalist said Herrick

Whats that a fatalist said Davis

Oh its a fellow that believes a lot of things said Herrick
believes that his bullets go true believes that all falls out as God
chooses do as you like to prevent it and all that

Why I guess I believe right so myself said Davis

You do said Herrick

You bet I do says Davis

Herrick shrugged his shoulders Well you must be a fool said he and
he leaned his head upon his knees

The captain stood biting his hands

Theres one thing sure he said at last I must get Huish out of
that HES not fit to hold his end up with a man like you describe

And he turned to go away The words had been quite simple not so the
tone and the other was quick to catch it

Davis he cried no Dont do it Spare ME and dont do itspare
yourself and leave it alonefor Gods sake for your childrens sake

His voice rose to a passionate shrillness another moment and he might
be overheard by their not distant victim But Davis turned on him with a
savage oath and gesture and the miserable young man rolled over on his
face on the sand and lay speechless and helpless

The captain meanwhile set out rapidly for Attwaters house As he went
he considered with himself eagerly his thoughts racing The man had
understood he had mocked them from the beginning he would teach him
to make a mockery of John Davis Herrick thought him a god give him a
second to aim in and the god was overthrown He chuckled as he felt the
butt of his revolver It should be done now as he went in From behind
It was difficult to get there From across the table No the captain
preferred to shoot standing so as you could be sure to get your hand
upon your gun The best would be to summon Huish and when Attwater
stood up and turnedah then would be the moment Wrapped in his ardent
prefiguration of events the captain posted towards the house with his
head down

Hands up Halt cried the voice of Attwater

And the captain before he knew what he was doing had obeyed The
surprise was complete and irremediable Coming on the top crest of his
murderous intentions he had walked straight into an ambuscade and now
stood with his hands impotently lifted staring at the verandah

The party was now broken up Attwater leaned on a post and kept Davis
covered with a Winchester One of the servants was hard by with a
second at the port arms leaning a little forward roundeyed with eager
expectancy In the open space at the head of the stair Huish was partly
supported by the other native his face wreathed in meaningless smiles
his mind seemingly sunk in the contemplation of an unlighted cigar

Well said Attwater you seem to me to be a very twopenny pirate

The captain uttered a sound in his throat for which we have no name
rage choked him

I am going to give you Mr Whishor the winesop that remains of him
continued Attwater He talks a great deal when he drinks Captain
Davis of the Sea Ranger But I have quite done with himand return the
article with thanks Now he cried sharply Another false movement
like that and your family will have to deplore the loss of an
invaluable parent keep strictly still Davis

Attwater said a word in the native his eye still undeviatingly fixed on
the captain and the servant thrust Huish smartly forward from the
brink of the stair With an extraordinary simultaneous dispersion of
his members that gentleman bounded forth into space struck the earth
ricocheted and brought up with his arms about a palm His mind was
quite a stranger to these events the expression of anguish that
deformed his countenance at the moment of the leap was probably
mechanical and he suffered these convulsions in silence clung to the
tree like an infant and seemed by his dips to suppose himself engaged
in the pastime of bobbing for apples A more finely sympathetic mind or
a more observant eye might have remarked a little in front of him on
the sand and still quite beyond reach the unlighted cigar

 There is your Whitechapel carrion said Attwater And now
you might very well ask me why I do not put a period to you at once as
you deserve I will tell you why Davis It is because I have nothing to
do with the Sea Ranger and the people you drowned or the Farallone and
the champagne that you stole That is your account with God He keeps
it and He will settle it when the clock strikes In my own case I have
nothing to go on but suspicion and I do not kill on suspicion not even
vermin like you But understand if ever I see any of you again it is
another matter and you shall eat a bullet And now take yourself off
March and as you value what you call your life keep your hands up as
you go

The captain remained as he was his hands up his mouth open mesmerised
with fury

March said Attwater Onetwothree

And Davis turned and passed slowly away But even as he went he was
meditating a prompt offensive return In the twinkling of an eye
he had leaped behind a tree and was crouching there pistol in hand
peering from either side of his place of ambush with bared teeth a
serpent already poised to strike And already he was too late Attwater
and his servants had disappeared and only the lamps shone on the
deserted table and the bright sand about the house and threw into the
night in all directions the strong and tall shadows of the palms

Davis ground his teeth Where were they gone the cowards to what hole
had they retreated beyond reach It was in vain he should try anything
he single and with a secondhand revolver against three persons
armed with Winchesters and who did not show an ear out of any of the
apertures of that lighted and silent house Some of them might have
already ducked below it from the rear and be drawing a bead upon him at
that moment from the lowbrowed crypt the receptacle of empty bottles
and broken crockery No there was nothing to be done but to bring away
if it were still possible his shattered and demoralised forces

Huish he said come along

S lose my ciga said Huish reaching vaguely forward

The captain let out a rasping oath Come right along here said he

S all righ Sleep here th AttyAttwa Go boar tmorr replied the
festive one

If you dont come and come now by the living God Ill shoot you
cried the captain

It is not to be supposed that the sense of these words in any way
penetrated to the mind of Hulsh rather that in a fresh attempt upon
the cigar he overbalanced himself and came flying erratically forward
a course which brought him within reach of Davis

Now you walk straight said the captain clutching him or Ill know
why not

S lose my ciga replied Huish

The captains contained fury blazed up for a moment He twisted Huish
round grasped him by the neck of the coat ran him in front of him to
the pier end and flung him savagely forward on his face

Look for your cigar then you swine said he and blew his boat call
till the pea in it ceased to rattle

An immediate activity responded on board the Farallone far away voices
and soon the sound of oars floated along the surface of the lagoon and
at the same time from nearer hand Herrick aroused himself and strolled
languidly up He bent over the insignificant figure of Huish where it
grovelled apparently insensible at the base of the figurehead

Dead he asked

No hes not dead said Davis

And Attwater asked Herrick

Now you just shut your head replied Davis You can do that I fancy
and by God Ill show you how Ill stand no more of your drivel

They waited accordingly in silence till the boat bumped on the furthest
piers then raised Huish head and heels carried him down the gangway
and flung him summarily in the bottom On the way out he was heard
murmuring of the loss of his cigar and after he had been handed up the
side like baggage and cast down in the alleyway to slumber his last
audible expression was Splenl fl Attwa This the expert construed
into Splendid fellow Attwater with so much innocence had this great
spirit issued from the adventures of the evening

The captain went and walked in the waist with brief irate turns
Herrick leaned his arms on the taffrail the crew had all turned in The
ship had a gentle cradling motion at times a block piped like a bird
On shore through the colonnade of palm stems Attwaters house was to
be seen shining steadily with many lamps And there was nothing else
visible whether in the heaven above or in the lagoon below but the
stars and their reflections It might have been minutes or it might have
been hours that Herrick leaned there looking in the glorified water
and drinking peace A bath of stars he was thinking when a hand was
laid at last on his shoulder

Herrick said the captain Ive been walking off my trouble

A sharp jar passed through the young man but he neither answered nor so
much as turned his head

I guess I spoke a little rough to you on shore pursued the captain
the fact is I was real mad but now its over and you and me have to
turn to and think

I will NOT think said Herrick

Here old man said Davis kindly this wont fight you know Youve
got to brace up and help me get things straight Youre not going back
on a friend Thats not like you Herrick

O yes it is said Herrick

Come come said the captain and paused as if quite at a loss Look
here he cried you have a glass of champagne I wont touch it so
thatll show you if Im in earnest But its just the pickmeup for
you itll put an edge on you at once

O you leave me alone said Herrick and turned away

The captain caught him by the sleeve and he shook him off and turned on
him for the moment like a demoniac

Go to hell in your own way he cried

And he turned away again this time unchecked and stepped forward to
where the boat rocked alongside and ground occasionally against the
schooner He looked about him A corner of the house was interposed
between the captain and himself all was well no eye must see him in
that last act He slid silently into the boat thence silently into
the starry water

Instinctively he swam a little it would be time enough to stop by and
by

The shock of the immersion brightened his mind immediately The events
of the ignoble day passed before him in a frieze of pictures and he
thanked whatever Gods there be for that open door of suicide In such
a little while he would be done with it the random business at an end
the prodigal son come home A very bright planet shone before him and
drew a trenchant wake along the water He took that for his line and
followed it That was the last earthly thing that he should look upon
that radiant speck which he had soon magnified into a City of Laputa
along whose terraces there walked men and women of awful and benignant
features who viewed him with distant commiseration These imaginary
spectators consoled him he told himself their talk one to another it
was of himself and his sad destiny

From such flights of fancy he was aroused by the growing coldness of
the water Why should he delay Here where he was now let him drop the
curtain let him seek the ineffable refuge let him lie down with all
races and generations of men in the house of sleep It was easy to say
easy to do To stop swimming there was no mystery in that if he could
do it Could he And he could not He knew it instantly He was aware
instantly of an opposition in his members unanimous and invincible
clinging to life with a single and fixed resolve finger by finger
sinew by sinew something that was at once he and not heat once within
and without himthe shutting of some miniature valve in his brain
which a single manly thought should suffice to openand the grasp of an
external fate ineluctable as gravity To any man there may come at times
a consciousness that there blows through all the articulations of his
body the wind of a spirit not wholly his that his mind rebels that
another girds him and carries him whither he would not It came now
to Herrick with the authority of a revelation There was no escape
possible The open door was closed in his recreant face He must go back
into the world and amongst men without illusion He must stagger on to
the end with the pack of his responsibility and his disgrace until
a cold a blow a merciful chance ball or the more merciful hangman
should dismiss him from his infamy There were men who could commit
suicide there were men who could not and he was one who could not

For perhaps a minute there raged in his mind the coil of this
discovery then cheerless certitude followed and with an incredible
simplicity of submission to ascertained fact he turned round and
struck out for shore There was a courage in this which he could not
appreciate the ignobility of his cowardice wholly occupying him A
strong current set against him like a wind in his face he contended
with it heavily wearily without enthusiasm but with substantial
advantage marking his progress the while without pleasure by the
outline of the trees Once he had a moment of hope He heard to the
southward of him towards the centre of the lagoon the wallowing of
some great fish doubtless a shark and paused for a little treading
water Might not this be the hangman he thought But the wallowing died
away mere silence succeeded and Herrick pushed on again for the shore
raging as he went at his own nature Ay he would wait for the shark
but if he had heard him coming His smile was tragic He could have
spat upon himself

About three in the morning chance and the set of the current and the
bias of his own righthanded body so decided it between them that he
came to shore upon the beach in front of Attwaters There he sat down
and looked forth into a world without any of the lights of hope The
poor diving dress of selfconceit was sadly tattered With the fairy
tale of suicide of a refuge always open to him he had hitherto
beguiled and supported himself in the trials of life and behold
that also was only a fairy tale that also was folklore With the
consequences of his acts he saw himself implacably confronted for the
duration of life stretched upon a cross and nailed there with the iron
bolts of his own cowardice He had no tears he told himself no stories
His disgust with himself was so complete that even the process of
apologetic mythology had ceased He was like a man cast down from a
pillar and every bone broken He lay there and admitted the facts and
did not attempt to rise

Dawn began to break over the far side of the atoll the sky brightened
the clouds became dyed with gorgeous colours the shadows of the night
lifted And suddenly Herrick was aware that the lagoon and the trees
wore again their daylight livery and he saw on board the Farallone
Davis extinguishing the lantern and smoke rising from the galley

Davis without doubt remarked and recognised the figure on the beach
or perhaps hesitated to recognise it for after he had gazed a long
while from under his hand he went into the house and fetched a glass
It was very powerful Herrick had often used it With an instinct of
shame he hid his face in his hands

And what brings you here Mr HerrickHay or Mr HayHerrick asked
the voice of Attwater Your back view from my present position is
remarkably fine and I would continue to present it We can get on very
nicely as we are and if you were to turn round do you know I think it
would be awkward

Herrick slowly rose to his feet his heart throbbed hard a hideous
excitement shook him but he was master of himself Slowly he turned
and faced Attwater and the muzzle of a pointed rifle Why could I not
do that last night he thought

Well why dont you fire he said aloud with a voice that trembled

Attwater slowly put his gun under his arm then his hands in his
pockets

What brings you here he repeated

I dont know said Herrick and then with a cry Can you do anything
with me

Are you armed said Attwater I ask for the forms sake

Armed No said Herrick O yes I am too And he flung upon the
beach a dripping pistol

You are wet said Attwater

Yes I am wet said Herrick Can you do anything with me

Attwater read his face attentively

It would depend a good deal upon what you are said he

What I am A coward said Herrick

There is very little to be done with that said Attwater And yet the
description hardly strikes one as exhaustive

Oh what does it matter cried Herrick Here I am I am broken
crockery I am a burst drum the whole of my life is gone to water I
have nothing left that I believe in except my living horror of myself
Why do I come to you I dont know you are cold cruel hateful and
I hate you or I think I hate you But you are an honest man an honest
gentleman I put myself helpless in your hands What must I do If I
cant do anything be merciful and put a bullet through me its only a
puppy with a broken leg

If I were you I would pick up that pistol come up to the house and
put on some dry clothes said Attwater

If you really mean it said Herrick You know theywethey  But
you know all

I know quite enough said Attwater Come up to the house

And the captain from the deck of the Farallone saw the two men pass
together under the shadow of the grove



Chapter 11 DAVID AND GOLIATH

Huish had bundled himself up from the glare of the dayhis face to the
house his knees retracted The frail bones in the thin tropical raiment
seemed scarce more considerable than a fowls and Davis sitting on the
rail with his arm about a stay contemplated him with gloom wondering
what manner of counsel that insignificant figure should contain For
since Herrick had thrown him off and deserted to the enemy Huish alone
of mankind remained to him to be a helper and oracle

He considered their position with a sinking heart The ship was a stolen
ship the stores either from initial carelessness or ill administration
during the voyage were insufficient to carry them to any port except
back to Papeete and there retribution waited in the shape of a
gendarme a judge with a queershaped hat and the horror of distant
Noumea Upon that side there was no glimmer of hope Here at the
island the dragon was roused Attwater with his men and his Winchesters
watched and patrolled the house let him who dare approach it What else
was then left but to sit there inactive pacing the decksuntil the
Trinity Hall arrived and they were cast into irons or until the food
came to an end and the pangs of famine succeeded For the Trinity
Hall Davis was prepared he would barricade the house and die there
defending it like a rat in a crevice But for the other The cruise of
the Farallone into which he had plunged only a fortnight before with
such golden expectations could this be the nightmare end of it The
ship rotting at anchor the crew stumbling and dying in the scuppers It
seemed as if any extreme of hazard were to be preferred to so grisly a
certainty as if it would be better to upanchor after all put to sea
at a venture and perhaps perish at the hands of cannibals on one of
the more obscure Paumotus His eye roved swiftly over sea and sky in
quest of any promise of wind but the fountains of the Trade were empty
Where it had run yesterday and for weeks before a roaring blue river
charioting clouds silence now reigned and the whole height of
the atmosphere stood balanced On the endless ribbon of island that
stretched out to either hand of him its array of golden and green and
silvery palms not the most volatile frond was to be seen stirring
they drooped to their stable images in the lagoon like things carved of
metal and already their long line began to reverberate heat There was
no escape possible that day none probable on the morrow And still the
stores were running out

Then came over Davis from deep down in the roots of his being or at
least from far back among his memories of childhood and innocence a
wave of superstition This run of ill luck was something beyond natural
the chances of the game were in themselves more various it seemed as
if the devil must serve the pieces The devil He heard again the clear
note of Attwaters bell ringing abroad into the night and dying away
How if God

Briskly he averted his mind Attwater that was the point Attwater
had food and a treasure of pearls escape made possible in the present
riches in the future They must come to grips with Attwater the man
must die A smoky heat went over his face as he recalled the impotent
figure he had made last night and the contemptuous speeches he must bear
in silence Rage shame and the love of life all pointed the one way
and only invention halted how to reach him had he strength enough was
there any help in that misbegotten packet of bones against the house

His eyes dwelled upon him with a strange avidity as though he would
read into his soul and presently the sleeper moved stirred uneasily
turned suddenly round and threw him a blinking look Davis maintained
the same dark stare and Huish looked away again and sat up

Lord Ive an eadache on me said he I believe I was a bit swipey
last night Weres that crybyby Errick

Gone said the captain

Ashore cried Huish Oh I say Id a gone too

Would you said the captain

Yes I would replied Huish I like Attwater Es all right we
got on like one oclock when you were gone And aint his sherry in it
rather Its like Spiers and Ponds Amontillado I wish I ad a drain of
it now He sighed

Well youll never get no more of itthats one thing said Davis
gravely

Ere wots wrong with you Dyvis Coppers ot Well look at me I
aint grumpy said Huish Im as plyful as a canarybird I am

Yes said Davis youre playful I own that and you were playful
last night I believe and a damned fine performance you made of it

Allo said Huish Ows this Wot performance

Well Ill tell you said the captain getting slowly off the rail

And he did at full length with every wounding epithet and absurd
detail repeated and emphasised he had his own vanity and Huishs upon
the grill and roasted them and as he spoke he inflicted and endured
agonies of humiliation It was a plain mans masterpiece of the
sardonic

What do you think of it said he when he had done and looked down at
Huish flushed and serious and yet jeering

Ill tell you wot it is was the reply you and me cut a pretty dicky
figure

Thats so said Davis a pretty measly figure by God And by God I
want to see that man at my knees

Ah said Huish Ow to get him there

Thats it cried Davis How to get hold of him Theyre four to two
though theres only one man among them to count and thats Attwater
Get a bead on Attwater and the others would cut and run and sing out
like frightened poultryand old man Herrick would come round with
his hat for a share of the pearls No SIR its how to get hold of
Attwater And we darent even go ashore he would shoot us in the boat
like dogs

Are you particular about having him dead or alive asked Huish

I want to see him dead said the captain

Ah well said Huish then I believe Ill do a bit of breakfast

And he turned into the house

The captain doggedly followed him

Whats this he asked Whats your idea anyway

Oh you let me alone will you said Huish opening a bottle of
champagne Youll ear my idea soon enough Wyte till I pour some
chain on my ot coppers He drank a glass off and affected to listen
Ark said he ear it fizz Like am fryin I declyre Ave a
glass do and look sociable

No said the captain with emphasis no I will not theres
business

You pys your money and you tykes your choice my little man returned
Huish Seems rather a shyme to me to spoil your breakfast for wots
really ancient istory

He finished three parts of a bottle of champagne and nibbled a corner
of biscuit with extreme deliberation the captain sitting opposite and
champing the bit like an impatient horse Then Huish leaned his arms on
the table and looked Davis in the face

Wen youre ready said he

Well now whats your idea said Davis with a sigh

Fair play said Huish Whats yours

The trouble is that Ive got none replied Davis and wandered for
some time in aimless discussion of the difficulties in their path and
useless explanations of his own fiasco

About done said Huish

Ill dry up right here replied Davis

Well then said Huish you give me your and across the table and
say Gawd strike me dead if I dont back you up

His voice was hardly raised yet it thrilled the hearer His face seemed
the epitome of cunning and the captain recoiled from it as from a blow

What for said he

Luck said Huish Substantial guarantee demanded

And he continued to hold out his hand

I dont see the good of any such tomfoolery said the other

I do though returned Huish Gimme your and and say the words then
youll ear my view of it Dont and you wont

The captain went through the required form breathing short and gazing
on the clerk with anguish What to fear he knew not yet he feared
slavishly what was to fall from the pale lips

Now if youll excuse me alf a second said Huish Ill go and fetch
the byby

The baby said Davis Whats that

Fragile With care This side up replied the clerk with a wink as he
disappeared

He returned smiling to himself and carrying in his hand a silk
handkerchief The long stupid wrinkles ran up Daviss brow as he saw
it What should it contain He could think of nothing more recondite
than a revolver

Huish resumed his seat

Now said he are you man enough to take charge of Errick and the
niggers Because Ill take care of Hattwater

How cried Davis You cant

Tut tut said the clerk You gimme time Wots the first point The
first point is that we cant get ashore and Ill make you a present of
that for a ard one But ow about a flag of truce Would that do the
trick dye think or would Attwater simply blyze awy at us in the
bloomin boat like dawgs

No said Davis I dont believe he would

No more do I said Huish I dont believe he would either and Im
sure I ope he wont So then you can call us ashore Next point is
to get near the managin direction And for that Im going to ave you
write a letter in wich you sy youre ashamed to meet his eye and
that the bearer Mr J L Uish is empowered to represent you Armed
with wich seeminly simple expedient Mr J L Uish will proceed to
business

He paused like one who had finished but still held Davis with his eye

How said Davis Why

Well you see youre big returned Huish e knows you ave a gun in
your pocket and anybody can see with alf an eye that you aint the
man to esitate about usin it So its no go with you and never was
youre out of the runnin Dyvis But he wont be afryde of me Im such
a little un Im unarmedno kid about thatand Ill hold my ands up
right enough He paused If I can manage to sneak up nearer to him as
we talk he resumed you look out and back me up smart If I dont we
go awy again and nothink to urt See

The captains face was contorted by the frenzied effort to comprehend

No I dont see he cried I cant see What do you mean

I mean to do for the Beast cried Huish in a burst of venomous
triumph Ill bring the ulkin bully to grass Hes ad his larks out
of me Im goin to ave my lark out of im and a good lark too

What is it said the captain almost in a whisper

Sure you want to know asked Huish

Davis rose and took a turn in the house

Yes I want to know he said at last with an effort

Wen youre backs at the wall you do the best you can dont you
began the clerk I sy that because I appen to know theres a
prejudice against it its considered vulgar awfly vulgar He
unrolled the handkerchief and showed a fourounce jar This eres
vitriol this is said he

The captain stared upon him with a whitening face

This is the stuff he pursued holding it up Thisll burn to the
bone youll see it smoke upon im like ell fire One drop upon is
bloomin heyesight and Ill trouble you for Attwater

No no by God exclaimed the captain

Now see ere ducky said Huish this is my bean feast I believe
Im goin up to that man singleanded I am Es about seven foot
high and Im five foot one Es a rifle in his and es on the
lookout e wasnt born yesterday This is Dyvid and Goliar I tell
you If Id ast you to walk up and face the music I could understand
But I dont I ony ast you to stand by and spifflicate the niggers
Itll all come in quite natural youll see else Fust thing you know
youll see him running round and owling like a good un

Dont said Davis Dont talk of it

Well you ARE a juggins exclaimed Huish What did you want You
wanted to kill him and tried to last night You wanted to kill the ole
lot of them and tried to and ere I show you ow and because theres
some medicine in a bottle you kick up this fuss

I suppose thats so said Davis It dont seem someways reasonable
only there it is

Its the happlication of science I suppose sneered Huish

I dont know what it is cried Davis pacing the floor its there
I draw the line at it I cant put a finger to no such piggishness Its
too damned hateful

And I suppose its all your fancy pynted it said Huish wen you
take a pistol and a bit o lead and copse a mans brains all over him
No accountin for tystes

Im not denying it said Davis Its something here inside of me
Its foolishness I dare say its dam foolishness I dont argue I just
draw the line Isnt there no other way

Look for yourself said Huish I aint wedded to this if you think I
am I aint ambitious I dont make a point of playin the lead I offer
to thats all and if you cant show me better by Gawd Im goin to

Then the risk cried Davis

If you ast me straight I should say it was a case of seven to one and
no takers said Huish But thats my lookout ducky and Im gyme
thats wot I am gyme all through

The captain looked at him Huish sat there preening his sinister
vanity glorying in his precedency in evil and the villainous courage
and readiness of the creature shone out of him like a candle from a
lantern Dismay and a kind of respect seized hold on Davis in his own
despite Until that moment he had seen the clerk always hanging
back always listless uninterested and openly grumbling at a word of
anything to do and now by the touch of an enchanters wand he beheld
him sitting girt and resolved and his face radiant He had raised the
devil he thought and asked who was to control him and his spirits
quailed

Look as long as you like Huish was going on You dont see any green
in my eye I aint afryde of Attwater I aint afryde of you and I
aint afryde of words You want to kill people thats wot YOU want but
you want to do it in kid gloves and it cant be done that wy Murder
aint genteel it aint easy it aint safe and it tykes a man to do
it Eres the man

Huish began the captain with energy and then stopped and remained
staring at him with corrugated brows

Well hout with it said Huish Ave you anythink else to put up Is
there any other chanst to try

The captain held his peace

There you are then said Huish with a shrug

Davis fell again to his pacing

Oh you may do sentrygo till youre blue in the mug you wont find
anythink else said Huish

There was a little silence the captain like a man launched on a swing
flying dizzily among extremes of conjecture and refusal

But see he said suddenly pausing Can you Can the thing be done
Itit cant be easy

If I get within twenty foot of im itll be done so you look out
said Huish and his tone of certainty was absolute

How can you know that broke from the captain in a choked cry You
beast I believe youve done it before

Oh thats private affyres returned Huish I aint a talking man

A shock of repulsion struck and shook the captain a scream rose almost
to his lips had he uttered it he might have cast himself at the same
moment on the body of Huish might have picked him up and flung him
down and wiped the cabin with him in a frenzy of cruelty that seemed
half moral But the moment passed and the abortive crisis left the man
weaker The stakes were so highthe pearls on the one handstarvation
and shame on the other Ten years of pearls The imagination of Davis
translated them into a new glorified existence for himself and his
family The seat of this new life must be in London there were deadly
reasons against Portland Maine and the pictures that came to him were
of English manners He saw his boys marching in the procession of a
school with gowns on an usher marshalling them and reading as he
walked in a great book He was installed in a villa semidetached
the name Rosemore on the gateposts In a chair on the gravel walk he
seemed to sit smoking a cigar a blue ribbon in his buttonhole victor
over himself and circumstances and the malignity of bankers He saw the
parlour with red curtains and shells on the mantelpieceand with the
fine inconsistency of visions mixed a grog at the mahogany table ere he
turned in With that the Farallone gave one of the aimless and nameless
movements which even in an anchored ship and even in the most profound
calm remind one of the mobility of fluids and he was back again under
the cover of the house the fierce daylight besieging it all round and
glaring in the chinks and the clerk in a rather airy attitude awaiting
his decision

He began to walk again He aspired after the realisation of these
dreams like a horse nickering for water the lust of them burned in his
inside And the only obstacle was Attwater who had insulted him from
the first He gave Herrick a full share of the pearls he insisted on
it Huish opposed him and he trod the opposition down and praised
himself exceedingly He was not going to use vitriol himself was he
Huishs keeper It was a pity he had asked but after all he saw the
boys again in the school procession with the gowns he had thought to be
so tony long since And at the same time the incomparable shame of
the last evening blazed up in his mind

Have it your own way he said hoarsely

Oh I knew you would walk up said Huish Now for the letter Theres
paper pens and ink Sit down and Ill dictyte

The captain took a seat and the pen looked a while helplessly at the
paper then at Huish The swing had gone the other way there was a blur
upon his eyes Its a dreadful business he said with a strong twitch
of his shoulders

Its rather a start no doubt said Huish Tyke a dip of ink Thats
it William John Hattwater Esq Sir he dictated

How do you know his name is William John asked Davis

Saw it on a packing case said Huish Got that

No said Davis But theres another thing What are we to write

O my golly cried the exasperated Huish Wot kind of man do YOU call
yourself IM goin to tell you wot to write thats my pitch if youll
just be so bloomin condescendin as to write it down WILLIAM JOHN
ATTWATER ESQ SIR he reiterated And the captain at last beginning
half mechanically to move his pen the dictation proceeded

It is with feelings of shyme and artfelt contrition that I approach you
after the yumiliatin events of last night Our Mr Errick has left
the ship and will have doubtless communicated to you the nature of our
opes Needless to sy these are no longer possible Fate as declyred
against us and we bow the ead Well awyre as I am of the just
suspicions with wich I am regarded I do not venture to solicit the
fyvour of an interview for myself but in order to put an end to a
situytion wich must be equally pyneful to all I ave deputed my friend
and partner Mr J L Huish to ly before you my proposals and wich
by their moderytion Will I trust be found to merit your attention
Mr J L Huish is entirely unarmed I swear to Gawd and will old is
ands over is ead from the moment he begins to approach you I am your
fytheful servant John Davis


Huish read the letter with the innocent joy of amateurs chuckled
gustfully to himself and reopened it more than once after it was
folded to repeat the pleasure Davis meanwhile sitting inert and
heavily frowning

Of a sudden he rose he seemed all abroad No he cried No it cant
be Its too much its damnation God would never forgive it

Well and oo wants Him to returned Huish shrill with fury You
were damned years ago for the Sea Rynger and said so yourself Well
then be damned for something else and old your tongue

The captain looked at him mistily No he pleaded no old man dont
do it

Ere now said Huish Ill give you my ultimytum Go or sty were you
are I dont mind Im goin to see that man and chuck this vitriol in
his eyes If you sty Ill go alone the niggers will likely knock me
on the ead and a fat lot youll be the better But theres one thing
sure Ill ear no more of your moonin mullygrubbin rot and tyke it
stryte

The captain took it with a blink and a gulp Memory with phantom
voices repeated in his cars something similar something he had once
said to Herrickyears ago it seemed

Now gimme over your pistol said Huish I ave to see all clear Six
shots and mind you dont wyste them

The captain like a man in a nightmare laid down his revolver on the
table and Huish wiped the cartridges and oiled the works

It was close on noon there was no breath of wind and the heat was
scarce bearable when the two men came on deck had the boat manned and
passed down one after another into the sternsheets A white shirt at
the end of an oar served as a flag of truce and the men by direction
and to give it the better chance to be observed pulled with extreme
slowness The isle shook before them like a place incandescent on
the face of the lagoon blinding copper suns no bigger than sixpences
danced and stabbed them in the eyeballs there went up from sand and
sea and even from the boat a glare of scathing brightness and as they
could only peer abroad from between closed lashes the excess of light
seemed to be changed into a sinister darkness comparable to that of a
thundercloud before it bursts

The captain had come upon this errand for any one of a dozen reasons
the last of which was desire for its success Superstition rules all
men semiignorant and gross natures like that of Davis it rules
utterly For murder he had been prepared but this horror of the
medicine in the bottle went beyond him and he seemed to himself to be
parting the last strands that united him to God The boat carried him
on to reprobation to damnation and he suffered himself to be carried
passively consenting silently bidding farewell to his better self
and his hopes Huish sat by his side in towering spirits that were not
wholly genuine Perhaps as brave a man as ever lived brave as a weasel
he must still reassure himself with the tones of his own voice he must
play his part to exaggeration he must outHerod Herod insult all
that was respectable and brave all that was formidable in a kind of
desperate wager with himself

Golly but its ot said he Cruel ot I call it Nice dy to get
your gruel in I sy you know it must feel awfly peculiar to get
bowled over on a dy like this Id rather ave it on a cowld and frosty
morning wouldnt you Singing Ere we go round the mulberry bush
on a cowld and frosty mornin Spoken Give you my word I avent
thought o that in ten year used to sing it at a hinfant school in
Ackney Ackney Wick it was Singing This is the way the tyler does
the tyler does Spoken Bloomin umbug Ow are you off now for the
notion of a future styte Do you cotton to the teafight views or the
old red ot boguey business

Oh dry up said the captain

No but I want to know said Huish Its within the spere of
practical politics for you and me my boy we may both be bowled over
one up tother down within the next ten minutes It would be rather a
lark now if you only skipped across came up smilin tother side
and a hangel met you with a B and S under his wing Ullo youd sy
come I tyke this kind

The captain groaned While Huish was thus airing and exercising his
bravado the man at his side was actually engaged in prayer Prayer
what for God knows But out of his inconsistent illogical and
agitated spirit a stream of supplication was poured forth inarticulate
as himself earnest as death and judgment

Thou Gawd seest me continued Huish I remember I had that written
in my Bible I remember the Bible too all about Abinadab and parties
Well Gawd apostrophising the meridian youre goin to see a rum
start presently I promise you that

The captain bounded

Ill have no blasphemy he cried no blasphemy in my boat

All right cap said Huish Anythink to oblige Any other topic you
would like to sudgest the rynegyge the lightnin rod Shykespeare or
the musical glasses Eres conversation on a tap Put a penny in the
slot and ullo ere they are he cried Now or never is e goin
to shoot

And the little man straightened himself into an alert and dashing
attitude and looked steadily at the enemy But the captain rose half up
in the boat with eyes protruding

Whats that he cried

Wots wot said Huish

Thoseblamed things said the captain

And indeed it was something strange Herrick and Attwater both armed
with Winchesters had appeared out of the grove behind the figurehead
and to either hand of them the sun glistened upon two metallic objects
locomotory like men and occupying in the economy of these creatures the
places of headsonly the heads were faceless To Davis between wind
and water his mythology appeared to have come alive and Tophet to be
vomiting demons But Huish was not mystified a moment

Divers elmets you ninny Cant you see he said

So they are said Davis with a gasp And why Oh I see its for
armour

Wot did I tell you said Huish Dyvid and Goliar all the wy and
back

The two natives for they it was that were equipped in this unusual
panoply of war spread out to right and left and at last lay down
in the shade on the extreme flank of the position Even now that the
mystery was explained Davis was hatefully preoccupied stared at the
flame on their crests and forgot and then remembered with a smile the
explanation

Attwater withdrew again into the grove and Herrick with his gun under
his arm came down the pier alone

About halfway down he halted and hailed the boat

What do you want he cried

Ill tell that to Mr Attwater replied Huish stepping briskly on the
ladder I dont tell it to you because you played the trucklin sneak
Heres a letter for him tyke it and give it and be anged to you

Davis is this all right said Herrick

Davis raised his chin glanced swiftly at Herrick and away again and
held his peace The glance was charged with some deep emotion but
whether of hatred or of fear it was beyond Herrick to divine

Well he said Ill give the letter He drew a score with his foot
on the boards of the gangway Till I bring the answer dont move a
step past this

And he returned to where Attwater leaned against a tree and gave him
the letter Attwater glanced it through

What does that mean he asked passing it to Herrick

Treachery

Oh I suppose so said Herrick

Well tell him to come on said Attwater One isnt a fatalist for
nothing Tell him to come on and to look out

Herrick returned to the figurehead Halfway down the pier the clerk
was waiting with Davis by his side

You are to come along Huish said Herrick He bids you look out no
tricks

Huish walked briskly up the pier and paused face to face with the young
man

Were is e said he and to Herricks surprise the lowbred
insignificant face before him flushed suddenly crimson and went white
again

Right forward said Herrick pointing Now your hands above your
head

The clerk turned away from him and towards the figurehead as though he
were about to address to it his devotions he was seen to heave a deep
breath and raised his arms In common with many men of his unhappy
physical endowments Huishs hands were disproportionately long and
broad and the palms in particular enormous a fourounce jar was
nothing in that capacious fist The next moment he was plodding steadily
forward on his mission

Herrick at first followed Then a noise in his rear startled him and he
turned about to find Davis already advanced as far as the figurehead
He came crouching and openmouthed as the mesmerised may follow the
mesmeriser all human considerations and even the care of his own life
swallowed up in one abominable and burning curiosity

Halt cried Herrick covering him with his rifle Davis what are you
doing man YOU are not to come

Davis instinctively paused and regarded him with a dreadful vacancy of
eye

Put your back to that figurehead do you hear me and stand fast
said Herrick

The captain fetched a breath stepped back against the figurehead and
instantly redirected his glances after Huish

There was a hollow place of the sand in that part and as it were
a glade among the cocoa palms in which the direct noonday sun blazed
intolerably At the far end in the shadow the tall figure of Attwater
was to be seen leaning on a tree towards him with his hands over his
head and his steps smothered in the sand the clerk painfully waded
The surrounding glare threw out and exaggerated the mans smallness it
seemed no less perilous an enterprise this that he was gone upon than
for a whelp to besiege a citadel

There Mr Whish That will do cried Attwater From that distance
and keeping your hands up like a good boy you can very well put me in
possession of the skippers views

The interval betwixt them was perhaps forty feet and Huish measured
it with his eye and breathed a curse He was already distressed with
labouring in the loose sand and his arms ached bitterly from their
unnatural position In the palm of his right hand the jar was ready
and his heart thrilled and his voice choked as he began to speak

Mr Hattwater said he I dont know if ever you ad a mother

I can set your mind at rest I had returned Attwater and
henceforth if I might venture to suggest it her name need not recur in
our communications I should perhaps tell you that I am not amenable to
the pathetic

I am sorry sir if I ave seemed to tresparse on your private
feelins said the clerk cringing and stealing a step At least sir
you will never pesuade me that you are not a perfec gentleman I
know a gentleman when I see him and as such I ave no esitation in
throwin myself on your merciful consideration It IS ard lines no
doubt its ard lines to have to hown yourself beat its ard lines to
ave to come and beg to you for charity

When if things had only gone right the whole place was as good as
your own suggested Attwater I can understand the feeling

You are judging me Mr Attwater said the clerk and God knows how
unjustly THOU GAWD SEEST ME was the tex I ad in my Bible wich my
father wrote it in with is own and upon the fly leaft

I am sorry I have to beg your pardon once more said Attwater but
do you know you seem to me to be a trifle nearer which is entirely
outside of our bargain And I would venture to suggest that you take
onetwothreesteps back and stay there

The devil at this staggering disappointment looked out of Huishs
face and Attwater was swift to suspect He frowned he stared on the
little man and considered Why should he be creeping nearer The next
moment his gun was at his shoulder

Kindly oblige me by opening your hands Open your hands widelet me
see the fingers spread you dogthrow down that thing youre holding
he roared his rage and certitude increasing together

And then at almost the same moment the indomitable Huish decided to
throw and Attwater pulled the trigger There was scarce the difference
of a second between the two resolves but it was in favour of the man
with the rifle and the jar had not yet left the clerks hand before
the ball shattered both For the twinkling of an eye the wretch was in
hells agonies bathed in liquid flames a screaming bedlamite and then
a second and more merciful bullet stretched him dead

The whole thing was come and gone in a breath Before Herrick could turn
about before Davis could complete his cry of horror the clerk lay in
the sand sprawling and convulsed

Attwater ran to the body he stooped and viewed it he put his finger in
the vitriol and his face whitened and hardened with anger

Davis had not yet moved he stood astonished with his back to the
figurehead his hands clutching it behind him his body inclined
forward from the waist

Attwater turned deliberately and covered him with his rifle

Davis he cried in a voice like a trumpet I give you sixty seconds
to make your peace with God

Davis looked and his mind awoke He did not dream of selfdefence he
did not reach for his pistol He drew himself up instead to face death
with a quivering nostril

I guess Ill not trouble the Old Man he said considering the job I
was on I guess its better business to just shut my face

Attwater fired there came a spasmodic movement of the victim and
immediately above the middle of his forehead a black hole marred the
whiteness of the figurehead A dreadful pause then again the report
and the solid sound and jar of the bullet in the wood and this time the
captain had felt the wind of it along his cheek A third shot and he
was bleeding from one ear and along the levelled rifle Attwater smiled
like a Red Indian

The cruel game of which he was the puppet was now clear to Davis three
times he had drunk of death and he must look to drink of it seven times
more before he was despatched He held up his hand

Steady he cried Ill take your sixty seconds

Good said Attwater

The captain shut his eyes tight like a child he held his hands up at
last with a tragic and ridiculous gesture

My God for Christs sake look after my two kids he said and then
after a pause and a falter for Christs sake Amen

And he opened his eyes and looked down the rifle with a quivering mouth

But dont keep fooling me long he pleaded

Thats all your prayer asked Attwater with a singular ring in his
voice

Guess so said Davis

So said Attwater resting the butt of his rifle on the ground is
that done Is your peace made with Heaven Because it is with me Go
and sin no more sinful father And remember that whatever you do to
others God shall visit it again a thousandfold upon your innocents

The wretched Davis came staggering forward from his place against the
figurehead fell upon his knees and waved his hands and fainted

When he came to himself again his head was on Attwaters arm and close
by stood one of the men in divers helmets holding a bucket of water
from which his late executioner now laved his face The memory of that
dreadful passage returned upon him in a clap again he saw Huish lying
dead again he seemed to himself to totter on the brink of an unplumbed
eternity With trembling hands he seized hold of the man whom he had
come to slay and his voice broke from him like that of a child among
the nightmares of fever O isnt there no mercy O what must I do to
be saved

Ah thought Attwater heres the true penitent



Chapter 12 TAILPIECE

On a very bright hot lusty strongly blowing noon a fortnight after
the events recorded and a month since the curtain rose upon this
episode a man might have been spied praying on the sand by the lagoon
beach A point of palm trees isolated him from the settlement and from
the place where he knelt the only work of mans hand that interrupted
the expanse was the schooner Farallone her berth quite changed and
rocking at anchor some two miles to windward in the midst of the lagoon
The noise of the Trade ran very boisterous in all parts of the island
the nearer palm trees crashed and whistled in the gusts those farther
off contributed a humming bass like the roar of cities and yet to any
man less absorbed there must have risen at times over this turmoil
of the winds the sharper note of the human voice from the settlement
There all was activity Attwater stripped to his trousers and lending
a strong hand of help was directing and encouraging five Kanakas from
his lively voice and their more lively efforts it was to be gathered
that some sudden and joyful emergency had set them in this bustle and
the Union Jack floated once more on its staff But the suppliant on the
beach unconscious of their voices prayed on with instancy and fervour
and the sound of his voice rose and fell again and his countenance
brightened and was deformed with changing moods of piety and terror

Before his closed eyes the skiff had been for some time tacking towards
the distant and deserted Farallone and presently the figure of Herrick
might have been observed to board her to pass for a while into the
house thence forward to the forecastle and at last to plunge into the
main hatch In all these quarters his visit was followed by a coil of
smoke and he had scarce entered his boat again and shoved off before
flames broke forth upon the schooner They burned gaily kerosene had
not been spared and the bellows of the Trade incited the conflagration
About half way on the return voyage when Herrick looked back he beheld
the Farallone wrapped to the topmasts in leaping arms of fire and
the voluminous smoke pursuing him along the face of the lagoon In one
hours time he computed the waters would have closed over the stolen
ship

It so chanced that as his boat flew before the wind with much vivacity
and his eyes were continually busy in the wake measuring the progress
of the flames he found himself embayed to the northward of the point
of palms and here became aware at the same time of the figure of Davis
immersed in his devotion An exclamation part of annoyance part of
amusement broke from him and he touched the helm and ran the prow
upon the beach not twenty feet from the unconscious devotee Taking the
painter in his hand he landed and drew near and stood over him And
still the voluble and incoherent stream of prayer continued unabated It
was not possible for him to overhear the suppliants petitions which he
listened to some while in a very mingled mood of humour and pity and
it was only when his own name began to occur and to be conjoined with
epithets that he at last laid his hand on the captains shoulder

Sorry to interrupt the exercise said he but I want you to look at
the Farallone

The captain scrambled to his feet and stood gasping and staring Mr
Herrick dont startle a man like that he said I dont seem someways
rightly myself since he broke off What did you say anyway O the
Farallone and he looked languidly out

Yes said Herrick There she burns and you may guess from that what
the news is

The Trinity Hall I guess said the captain

The same said Herrick sighted half an hour ago and coming up hand
over fist

Well it dont amount to a hill of beans said the captain with a
sigh

O come thats rank ingratitude cried Herrick

Well replied the captain meditatively you maynt just see the way
that I view it in but Id most rather stay here upon this island I
found peace here peace in believing Yes I guess this island is about
good enough for John Davis

I never heard such nonsense cried Herrick What with all turning
out in your favour the way it does the Farallone wiped out the crew
disposed of a sure thing for your wife and family and you yourself
Attwaters spoiled darling and pet penitent

Now Mr Herrick dont say that said the captain gently when you
know he dont make no difference between us But O why not be one of
us why not come to Jesus right away and lets meet in yon beautiful
land Thats just the one thing wanted just say Lord I believe help
thou mine unbelief And Hell fold you in His arms You see I know
Ive been a sinner myself
