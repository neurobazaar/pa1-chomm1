Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

ACT I

Scene I A Room of State in King Lears Palace

Enter Kent Gloster and Edmund

Kent
I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than
Cornwall

Glou
It did always seem so to us but now in the division of the
kingdom it appears not which of the Dukes he values most for
equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make
choice of eithers moiety

Kent
Is not this your son my lord

Glou
His breeding sir hath been at my charge I have so often
blushd to acknowledge him that now I am brazd tot

Kent
I cannot conceive you

Glou
Sir this young fellows mother could whereupon she grew
roundwombed and had indeed sir a son for her cradle ere she
had a husband for her bed Do you smell a fault

Kent
I cannot wish the fault undone the issue of it being so proper

Glou
But I have sir a son by order of law some year elder than
this who yet is no dearer in my account though this knave came
something saucily into the world before he was sent for yet was
his mother fair there was good sport at his making and the
whoreson must be acknowledgedDo you know this noble gentleman
Edmund

Edm
No my lord

Glou
My Lord of Kent remember him hereafter as my honourable friend

Edm
My services to your lordship

Kent
I must love you and sue to know you better

Edm
Sir I shall study deserving

Glou
He hath been out nine years and away he shall againThe king
is coming

Sennet within

Enter Lear Cornwall Albany Goneril Regan Cordelia and
Attendants

Lear
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy
Gloster

Glou
I shall my liege

Exeunt Gloster and Edmund

Lear
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose
Give me the map thereKnow that we have divided
In three our kingdom and tis our fast intent
To shake all cares and business from our age
Conferring them on younger strengths while we
Unburdend crawl toward deathOur son of Cornwall
And you our no less loving son of Albany
We have this hour a constant will to publish
Our daughters several dowers that future strife
May be prevented now The princes France and Burgundy
Great rivals in our youngest daughters love
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn
And here are to be answerdTell me my daughters
Since now we will divest us both of rule
Interest of territory cares of state
Which of you shall we say doth love us most
That we our largest bounty may extend
Where nature doth with merit challengeGoneril
Our eldestborn speak first

Gon
Sir I love you more than words can wield the matter
Dearer than eyesight space and liberty
Beyond what can be valud rich or rare
No less than life with grace health beauty honour
As much as child eer lovd or father found
A love that makes breath poor and speech unable
Beyond all manner of so much I love you

Cor
Aside What shall Cordelia speak Love and be silent

Lear
Of all these bounds even from this line to this
With shadowy forests and with champains richd
With plenteous rivers and wideskirted meads
We make thee lady to thine and Albanys issue
Be this perpetualWhat says our second daughter
Our dearest Regan wife to Cornwall Speak

Reg
Sir I am made of the selfsame metal that my sister is
And prize me at her worth In my true heart
I find she names my very deed of love
Only she comes too shortthat I profess
Myself an enemy to all other joys
Which the most precious square of sense possesses
And find I am alone felicitate
In your dear highness love

Cor
Aside Then poor Cordelia
And yet not so since I am sure my loves
More richer than my tongue

Lear
To thee and thine hereditary ever
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom
No less in space validity and pleasure
Than that conferrd on GonerilNow our joy
Although the last not least to whose young love
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Strive to be interessd what can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters Speak

Cor
Nothing my lord

Lear
Nothing

Cor
Nothing

Lear
Nothing can come of nothing speak again

Cor
Unhappy that I am I cannot heave
My heart into my mouth I love your majesty
According to my bond no more nor less

Lear
How how Cordelia mend your speech a little
Lest you may mar your fortunes

Cor
Good my lord
You have begot me bred me lovd me I
Return those duties back as are right fit
Obey you love you and most honour you
Why have my sisters husbands if they say
They love you all Haply when I shall wed
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
Half my love with him half my care and duty
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters
To love my father all

Lear
But goes thy heart with this

Cor
Ay good my lord

Lear
So young and so untender

Cor
So young my lord and true

Lear
Let it be sothy truth then be thy dower
For by the sacred radiance of the sun
The mysteries of Hecate and the night
By all the operation of the orbs
From whom we do exist and cease to be
Here I disclaim all my paternal care
Propinquity and property of blood
And as a stranger to my heart and me
Hold thee from this for ever The barbarous Scythian
Or he that makes his generation messes
To gorge his appetite shall to my bosom
Be as well neighbourd pitied and relievd
As thou my sometime daughter

Kent
Good my liege

Lear
Peace Kent
Come not between the dragon and his wrath
I lovd her most and thought to set my rest
On her kind nurseryHence and avoid my sightTo Cordelia
So be my grave my peace as here I give
Her fathers heart from herCall Francewho stirs
Call BurgundyCornwall and Albany
With my two daughters dowers digest this third
Let pride which she calls plainness marry her
I do invest you jointly in my power
Preeminence and all the large effects
That troop with majestyOurself by monthly course
With reservation of an hundred knights
By you to be sustaind shall our abode
Make with you by due turns Only we still retain
The name and all the additions to a king
The sway
Revenue execution of the rest
Beloved sons be yours which to confirm
This coronet part betwixt you
Giving the crown

Kent
Royal Lear
Whom I have ever honourd as my king
Lovd as my father as my master followd
As my great patron thought on in my prayers

Lear
The bow is bent and drawn make from the shaft

Kent
Let it fall rather though the fork invade
The region of my heart be Kent unmannerly
When Lear is mad What wouldst thou do old man
Thinkst thou that duty shall have dread to speak
When power to flattery bows To plainness honours bound
When majesty falls to folly Reverse thy state
And in thy best consideration check
This hideous rashness answer my life my judgment
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least
Nor are those emptyhearted whose low sound
Reverbs no hollowness

Lear
Kent on thy life no more

Kent
My life I never held but as a pawn
To wage against thine enemies nor fear to lose it
Thy safety being the motive

Lear
Out of my sight

Kent
See better Lear and let me still remain
The true blank of thine eye

Lear
Now by Apollo

Kent
Now by Apollo king
Thou swearst thy gods in vain

Lear
O vassal miscreant

Laying his hand on his sword

Alb and Corn
Dear sir forbear

Kent
Do
Kill thy physician and the fee bestow
Upon the foul disease Revoke thy gift
Or whilst I can vent clamour from my throat
Ill tell thee thou dost evil

Lear
Hear me recreant
On thine allegiance hear me
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow
Which we durst never yetand with straind pride
To come between our sentence and our power
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear
Our potency made good take thy reward
Five days we do allot thee for provision
To shield thee from diseases of the world
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
Upon our kingdom if on the tenth day following
Thy banishd trunk be found in our dominions
The moment is thy death Away by Jupiter
This shall not be revokd

Kent
Fare thee well king sith thus thou wilt appear
Freedom lives hence and banishment is here
To Cordelia The gods to their dear shelter take thee maid
That justly thinkst and hast most rightly said
To Regan and Goneril
And your large speeches may your deeds approve
That good effects may spring from words of love
Thus Kent O princes bids you all adieu
Hell shape his old course in a country new

Exit

Flourish Reenter Gloster with France Burgundy and
Attendants

Glou
Heres France and Burgundy my noble lord

Lear
My Lord of Burgundy
We first address toward you who with this king
Hath rivalld for our daughter what in the least
Will you require in present dower with her
Or cease your quest of love

Bur
Most royal majesty
I crave no more than hath your highness offerd
Nor will you tender less

Lear
Right noble Burgundy
When she was dear to us we did hold her so
But now her price is falln Sir there she stands
If aught within that little seeming substance
Or all of it with our displeasure piecd
And nothing more may fitly like your grace
Shes there and she is yours

Bur
I know no answer

Lear
Will you with those infirmities she owes
Unfriended newadopted to our hate
Dowerd with our curse and strangerd with our oath
Take her or leave her

Bur
Pardon me royal sir
Election makes not up on such conditions

Lear
Then leave her sir for by the power that made me
I tell you all her wealthTo France For you great king
I would not from your love make such a stray
To match you where I hate therefore beseech you
To avert your liking a more worthier way
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamd
Almost to acknowledge hers

France
This is most strange
That she who even but now was your best object
The argument of your praise balm of your age
Most best most dearest should in this trice of time
Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
So many folds of favour Sure her offence
Must be of such unnatural degree
That monsters it or your forevouchd affection
Falln into taint which to believe of her
Must be a faith that reason without miracle
Should never plant in me

Cor
I yet beseech your majesty
If for I want that glib and oily art
To speak and purpose not since what I well intend
Ill dot before I speakthat you make known
It is no vicious blot murder or foulness
No unchaste action or dishonourd step
That hath deprivd me of your grace and favour
But even for want of that for which I am richer
A stillsoliciting eye and such a tongue
As I am glad I have not though not to have it
Hath lost me in your liking

Lear
Better thou
Hadst not been born than not to have pleasd me better

France
Is it but thisa tardiness in nature
Which often leaves the history unspoke
That it intends to doMy lord of Burgundy
What say you to the lady Loves not love
When it is mingled with regards that stands
Aloof from the entire point Will you have her
She is herself a dowry

Bur
Royal king
Give but that portion which yourself proposd
And here I take Cordelia by the hand
Duchess of Burgundy

Lear
Nothing I have sworn I am firm

Bur
I am sorry then you have so lost a father
That you must lose a husband

Cor
Peace be with Burgundy
Since that respects of fortune are his love
I shall not be his wife

France
Fairest Cordelia that art most rich being poor
Most choice forsaken and most lovd despisd
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon
Be it lawful I take up whats cast away
Gods gods tis strange that from their coldst neglect
My love should kindle to inflamd respect
Thy dowerless daughter king thrown to my chance
Is queen of us of ours and our fair France
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
Can buy this unprizd precious maid of me
Bid them farewell Cordelia though unkind
Thou losest here a better where to find

Lear
Thou hast her France let her be thine for we
Have no such daughter nor shall ever see
That face of hers againTherefore be gone
Without our grace our love our benison
Come noble Burgundy

Flourish Exeunt Lear Burgundy Cornwall Albany Gloster
and Attendants

France
Bid farewell to your sisters

Cor
The jewels of our father with washd eyes
Cordelia leaves you I know you what you are
And like a sister am most loath to call
Your faults as they are namd Love well our father
To your professed bosoms I commit him
But yet alas stood I within his grace
I would prefer him to a better place
So farewell to you both

Reg
Prescribe not us our duties

Gon
Let your study
Be to content your lord who hath receivd you
At fortunes alms You have obedience scanted
And well are worth the want that you have wanted

Cor
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides
Who cover faults at last shame them derides
Well may you prosper

France
Come my fair Cordelia

Exeunt France and Cordelia

Gon
Sister it is not little I have to say of what most nearly
appertains to us both I think our father will hence tonight

Reg
Thats most certain and with you next month with us

Gon
You see how full of changes his age is the observation we
have made of it hath not been little he always loved our
sister most and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her
off appears too grossly

Reg
Tis the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever but slenderly
known himself

Gon
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then must
we look to receive from his age not alone the imperfections of
longingraffed condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness
that infirm and choleric years bring with them

Reg
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of
Kents banishment

Gon
There is further compliment of leavetaking between France and
him Pray you let us hit together if our father carry authority
with such dispositions as he bears this last surrender of his
will but offend us

Reg
We shall further think of it

Gon
We must do something and i th heat

Exeunt



Scene II A Hall in the Earl of Glosters Castle

Enter Edmund with a letter

Edm
Thou nature art my goddess to thy law
My services are bound Wherefore should I
Stand in the plague of custom and permit
The curiosity of nations to deprive me
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
Lag of a brother Why bastard wherefore base
When my dimensions are as well compact
My mind as generous and my shape as true
As honest madams issue Why brand they us
With base with baseness bastardy base base
Who in the lusty stealth of nature take
More composition and fierce quality
Than doth within a dull stale tired bed
Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops
Got tween asleep and wakeWell then
Legitimate Edgar I must have your land
Our fathers love is to the bastard Edmund
As to the legitimate fine wordlegitimate
Well my legitimate if this letter speed
And my invention thrive Edmund the base
Shall top the legitimate I grow I prosper
Now gods stand up for bastards

Enter Gloster

Glou
Kent banishd thus and France in choler parted
And the king gone tonight subscribd his powr
Confind to exhibition All this done
Upon the gadEdmund how now What news

Edm
So please your lordship none

Putting up the letter

Glou
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter

Edm
I know no news my lord

Glou
What paper were you reading

Edm
Nothing my lord

Glou
No What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your
pocket the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself
Lets see
Come if it be nothing I shall not need spectacles

Edm
I beseech you sir pardon me It is a letter from my brother
that I have not all oerread and for so much as I have perusd
I find it not fit for your oerlooking

Glou
Give me the letter sir

Edm
I shall offend either to detain or give it The contents as in
part I understand them are to blame

Glou
Lets see lets see

Edm
I hope for my brothers justification he wrote this but as an
essay or taste of my virtue

Glou
Reads This policy and reverence of age makes the world
bitter to the best of our times keeps our fortunes from us
till our oldness cannot relish them I begin to find an idle
and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways
not as it hath power but as it is suffered Come to me that
of this I may speak more If our father would sleep till I
waked him you should enjoy half his revenue for ever and live
the beloved of your brother
EDGAR
Hum ConspiracySleep till I waked himyou should enjoy half
his revenueMy son Edgar Had he a hand to write this a heart
and brain to breed it in When came this to you who brought it

Edm
It was not brought me my lord theres the cunning of it I
found it thrown in at the casement of my closet

Glou
You know the character to be your brothers

Edm
If the matter were good my lord I durst swear it were his but
in respect of that I would fain think it were not

Glou
It is his

Edm
It is his hand my lord but I hope his heart is not in the
contents

Glou
Hath he never before sounded you in this business

Edm
Never my lord but I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit
that sons at perfect age and fathers declined the father
should be as ward to the son and the son manage his revenue

Glou
O villain villainHis very opinion in the letter Abhorred
villainUnnatural detested brutish villain worse than
brutishGo sirrah seek him Ill apprehend him Abominable
villainWhere is he

Edm
I do not well know my lord If it shall please you to suspend
your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him
better testimony of his intent you should run a certain course
where if you violently proceed against him mistaking his
purpose it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake
in pieces the heart of his obedience I dare pawn down my life
for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
honour and to no other pretence of danger

Glou
Think you so

Edm
If your honour judge it meet I will place you where you shall
hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your
satisfaction
and that without any further delay than this very evening

Glou
He cannot be such a monster

Edm
Nor is not sure

Glou
To his father that so tenderly and entirely loves himHeaven
and earthEdmund seek him out wind me into him I pray you
frame the business after your own wisdom I would unstate myself
to be in a due resolution

Edm
I will seek him sir presently convey the business as I shall
find means and acquaint you withal

Glou
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us
though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus yet
nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects love cools
friendship falls off brothers divide in cities mutinies in
countries discord in palaces treason and the bond cracked
twixt son and father This villain of mine comes under the
prediction theres son against father the king falls from
bias of nature theres father against child We have seen the
best of our time machinations hollowness treachery and all
ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our gravesFind out
this villain Edmund it shall lose thee nothing do it
carefullyAnd the noble and truehearted Kent banished his
offence honestyTis strange

Exit

Edm
This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are
sick in fortuneoften the surfeit of our own behaviourwe
make guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and the stars as
if we were villains on necessity fools by heavenly compulsion
knaves thieves and treachers by spherical predominance
drunkards liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of
planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine
thrusting on an admirable evasion of whoremaster man to lay his
goatish disposition to the charge of a star My father compounded
with my mother under the dragons tail and my nativity was under
ursa major so that it follows I am rough and lecherousTut I
should have been that I am had the maidenliest star in the
firmament twinkled on my bastardizing

Enter Edgar

Pathe comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy my cue
is villainous melancholy with a sigh like Tom o BedlamO
these eclipses do portend these divisions fa sol la mi

Edg
How now brother Edmund what serious contemplation are you in

Edm
I am thinking brother of a prediction I read this other day
what should follow these eclipses

Edg
Do you busy yourself with that

Edm
I promise you the effects he writes of succeed unhappily as of
unnaturalness between the child and the parent death dearth
dissolutions of ancient amities divisions in state menaces and
maledictions against king and nobles needless diffidences
banishment of friends dissipation of cohorts nuptial breaches
and I know not what

Edg
How long have you been a sectary astronomical

Edm
Come come when saw you my father last

Edg
The night gone by

Edm
Spake you with him

Edg
Ay two hours together

Edm
Parted you in good terms Found you no displeasure in him by word
or countenance

Edg
None at all

Edm
Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him and at my
entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath
qualified the heat of his displeasure which at this instant so
rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would
scarcely allay

Edg
Some villain hath done me wrong

Edm
Thats my fear I pray you have a continent forbearance till the
speed of his rage goes slower and as I say retire with me to
my lodging from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord
speak pray you go theres my keyIf you do stir abroad go
armed

Edg
Armed brother

Edm
Brother I advise you to the best I am no honest man
if there be any good meaning toward you I have told you what I
have seen and heard but faintly nothing like the image and
horror of it pray you away

Edg
Shall I hear from you anon

Edm
I do serve you in this business

Exit Edgar

A credulous father and a brother noble
Whose nature is so far from doing harms
That he suspects none on whose foolish honesty
My practices ride easyI see the business
Let me if not by birth have lands by wit
All with mes meet that I can fashion fit

Enter Goneril and Oswald

Gon
Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool

Osw Ay madam

Gon
By day and night he wrongs me every hour
He flashes into one gross crime or other
That sets us all at odds Ill not endure it
His knights grow riotous and himself upbraids us
On every trifleWhen he returns from hunting
I will not speak with him say I am sick
If you come slack of former services
You shall do well the fault of it Ill answer

Osw
Hes coming madam I hear him

Horns within

Gon
Put on what weary negligence you please
You and your fellows Id have it come to question
If he distaste it let him to our sister
Whose mind and mine I know in that are one
Not to be overruled Idle old man
That still would manage those authorities
That he hath given awayNow by my life
Old fools are babes again and must be usd
With checks as flatterieswhen they are seen abusd
Remember what I have said

Osw
Very well madam

Gon
And let his knights have colder looks among you
What grows of it no matter advise your fellows so
I would breed from hence occasions and I shall
That I may speakIll write straight to my sister
To hold my very coursePrepare for dinner

well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also and
your daughter

Lear
Ha sayst thou so

Knight
I beseech you pardon me my lord if I be mistaken for my duty
cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged

Lear
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception I have perceived

own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of
unkindness I will look further intotBut wheres my fool I

the middle and gavst away both parts thou borest thine ass on
thy back oer the dirt thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown
when thou gavest thy golden one away If I speak like myself in

Fool
I have used it nuncle eer since thou madst thy daughters thy
mothers for when thou gavst them the rod and puttest down

 That such a king should play bopeep
 And go the fools among

Prythee nuncle keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to
lie I would fain learn to lie

Lear
An you lie sirrah well have you whipped

will hold my tongue So your face To Goneril bids me though
you say nothing Mum mum
 He that keeps nor crust nor crum
 Weary of all shall want some
Pointing to Lear Thats a shealed peascod

Gon
Not only sir this your alllicensd fool
But other of your insolent retinue
Do hourly carp and quarrel breaking forth
In rank and nottobeendured riots Sir
I had thought by making this well known unto you
To have found a safe redress but now grow fearful
By what yourself too late have spoke and done
That you protect this course and put it on
By your allowance which if you should the fault
Would not scape censure nor the redresses sleep
Which in the tender of a wholesome weal
Might in their working do you that offence
Which else were shame that then necessity
Will call discreet proceeding

Fool
For you know nuncle
 The hedgesparrow fed the cuckoo so long
 That it had it head bit off by it young
So out went the candle and we were left darkling

Lear
Are you our daughter

Gon
Come sir
I would you would make use of that good wisdom
Whereof I know you are fraught and put away
These dispositions that of late transform you
From what you rightly are

Fool
May not an ass know when the cart draws the horseWhoop Jug I
love thee

Lear
Doth any here know meThis is not Lear
Doth Lear walk thus speak thus Where are his eyes
Either his notion weakens his discernings
Are lethargiedHa waking Tis not so
Who is it that can tell me who I am

Fool
Lears shadow

Lear
I would learn that for by the marks of sovereignty
Knowledge and reason
I should be false persuaded I had daughters

Fool
Which they will make an obedient father

Lear
Your name fair gentlewoman

Gon
This admiration sir is much o the favour
Of other your new pranks I do beseech you
To understand my purposes aright
As you are old and reverend you should be wise
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires
Men so disorderd so deboshd and bold
That this our court infected with their manners
Shows like a riotous inn epicurism and lust
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
Than a gracd palace The shame itself doth speak
For instant remedy be then desird
By her that else will take the thing she begs
A little to disquantity your train
And the remainder that shall still depend
To be such men as may besort your age
Which know themselves and you

Lear
Darkness and devils
Saddle my horses call my train together
Degenerate bastard Ill not trouble thee
Yet have I left a daughter

Gon
You strike my people and your disorderd rabble
Make servants of their betters

Enter Albany

Lear
Woe that too late repents
To Albany O sir are you come
Is it your will Speak sirPrepare my horses
Ingratitude thou marblehearted fiend
More hideous when thou showst thee in a child
Than the seamonster

Alb
Pray sir be patient

Lear
to Goneril Detested kite thou liest
My train are men of choice and rarest parts
That all particulars of duty know
And in the most exact regard support
The worships of their nameO most small fault
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show
Which like an engine wrenchd my frame of nature
From the fixd place drew from my heart all love
And added to the gall O Lear Lear Lear
Beat at this gate that let thy folly in Striking his head
And thy dear judgment outGo go my people

Alb
My lord I am guiltless as I am ignorant
Of what hath movd you

Lear
It may be so my lord
Hear nature hear dear goddess hear
Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend
To make this creature fruitful
Into her womb convey sterility
Dry up in her the organs of increase
And from her derogate body never spring
A babe to honour her If she must teem
Create her child of spleen that it may live
And be a thwart disnaturd torment to her
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks
Turn all her mothers pains and benefits
To laughter and contempt that she may feel
How sharper than a serpents tooth it is
To have a thankless childAway away

Exit

Alb
Now gods that we adore whereof comes this

Gon
Never afflict yourself to know more of it
But let his disposition have that scope
That dotage gives it

Reenter Lear

Lear
What fifty of my followers at a clap
Within a fortnight

Alb
Whats the matter sir

Lear
Ill tell theeLife and deathTo Goneril I am ashamd
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus
That these hot tears which break from me perforce
Should make thee worth themBlasts and fogs upon thee
Th untented woundings of a fathers curse
Pierce every sense about theeOld fond eyes
Beweep this cause again Ill pluck you out
And cast you with the waters that you lose
To temper clay Ha
Let it be so I have another daughter
Who I am sure is kind and comfortable
When she shall hear this of thee with her nails
Shell flay thy wolvish visage Thou shalt find
That Ill resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever

Exeunt Lear Kent and Attendants

Gon
Do you mark that

Alb
I cannot be so partial Goneril
To the great love I bear you

Gon
Pray you contentWhat Oswald ho
To the Fool You sir more knave than fool after your master

Fool
Nuncle Lear nuncle Lear tarrytake the fool with thee
 A fox when one has caught her
 And such a daughter
 Should sure to the slaughter
 If my cap would buy a halter
 So the fool follows after

Exit

Gon
This man hath had good counselA hundred knights
Tis politic and safe to let him keep
At point a hundred knights yes that on every dream
Each buzz each fancy each complaint dislike
He may enguard his dotage with their powers
And hold our lives in mercyOswald I say

Alb
Well you may fear too far

Gon
Safer than trust too far
Let me still take away the harms I fear
Not fear still to be taken I know his heart
What he hath utterd I have writ my sister
If she sustain him and his hundred knights
When I have showd th unfitness

Reenter Oswald

How now Oswald
What have you writ that letter to my sister

Osw
Ay madam

Gon
Take you some company and away to horse
Inform her full of my particular fear
And thereto add such reasons of your own
As may compact it more Get you gone
And hasten your return

Exit Oswald

No no my lord
This milky gentleness and course of yours
Though I condemn it not yet under pardon
You are much more attaskd for want of wisdom
Than praisd for harmful mildness

Alb
How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell
Striving to better oft we mar whats well

Gon
Nay then

Alb
Well well the event

Glou
Where is the villain Edmund

Edm
Fled this way sir When by no means he could

Glou
Pursue him hoGo after

Exeunt Servants

By no means what

Edm
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship
But that I told him the revenging gods
Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend
Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
The child was bound to the fathersir in fine
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
To his unnatural purpose in fell motion
With his prepared sword he charges home
My unprovided body lancd mine arm
But when he saw my best alarumd spirits
Bold in the quarrels right rousd to the encounter
Or whether gasted by the noise I made
Full suddenly he fled

Glou
Let him fly far
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught
And founddispatchdThe noble duke my master
My worthy arch and patron comes tonight
By his authority I will proclaim it
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake
He that conceals him death

Edm
When I dissuaded him from his intent
And found him pight to do it with curst speech
I threatend to discover him he replied
Thou unpossessing bastard dost thou think
If I would stand against thee would the reposal
Of any trust virtue or worth in thee
Make thy words faithd No what I should deny
As this I would ay though thou didst produce
My very character Id turn it all
To thy suggestion plot and damned practice
And thou must make a dullard of the world
If they not thought the profits of my death
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
To make thee seek it

Glou
Strong and fastned villain
Would he deny his letterI never got him

Trumpets within

Hark the dukes trumpets I know not why he comes
All ports Ill bar the villain shall not scape
The duke must grant me that besides his picture
I will send far and near that all the kingdom
May have due note of him and of my land
Loyal and natural boy Ill work the means
To make thee capable

Enter Cornwall Regan and Attendants

Glou

Edm
Yes madam he was of that consort

Reg

Been well informd of them and with such cautions
That if they come to sojourn at my house
Ill not be there

Corn

Corn
Peace sirrah
You beastly knave know you no reverence

Kent
Yes sir but anger hath a privilege

Corn
Why art thou angry

Kent
That such a slave as this should wear a sword
Who wears no honesty Such smiling rogues as these
Like rats oft bite the holy cords atwain
Which are too intrinse t unloose smooth every passion
That in the natures of their lords rebel
Bring oil to fire snow to their colder moods
Renege affirm and turn their halcyon beaks
With every gale and vary of their masters
Knowing naught like dogs but following
A plague upon your epileptic visage
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool
Goose an I had you upon Sarum plain
Id drive ye cackling home to Camelot

Corn
What art thou mad old fellow

Glou
How fell you out
Say that

Kent
No contraries hold more antipathy
Than I and such a knave

Corn
Why dost thou call him knave What is his fault

Kent
His countenance likes me not

Corn
No more perchance does mine or his or hers

Kent
Sir tis my occupation to be plain
I have seen better faces in my time
Than stands on any shoulder that I see
Before me at this instant

Corn
This is some fellow
Who having been praisd for bluntness doth affect
A saucy roughness and constrains the garb
Quite from his nature he cannot flatter he
An honest mind and plainhe must speak truth
An they will take it so if not hes plain
These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
Than twenty sillyducking observants
That stretch their duties nicely

Kent
Sir in good faith in sincere verity
Under the allowance of your great aspect
Whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire
On flickering Phoebus front

Corn
What meanst by this

Kent
To go out of my dialect which you discommend so much I know
sir I am no flatterer he that beguiled you in a plain accent
was a plain knave which for my part I will not be though I
should win your displeasure to entreat me tot

Corn
What was the offence you gave him

Osw
I never gave him any
It pleasd the king his master very late
To strike at me upon his misconstruction
When he compact and flattering his displeasure
Trippd me behind being down insulted raild
And put upon him such a deal of man
That worthied him got praises of the king
For him attempting who was selfsubdud
And in the fleshment of this dread exploit
Drew on me here again

Kent
None of these rogues and cowards
But Ajax is their fool

Corn
Fetch forth the stocks
You stubborn ancient knave you reverent braggart
Well teach you

Kent
Sir I am too old to learn
Call not your stocks for me I serve the king
On whose employment I was sent to you

Against the grace and person of my master
Stocking his messenger

Reg
Till noon Till night my lord and all night too

Corn

Stocks brought out

Glou

His fault is much and the good king his master
Will check him fort your purposd low correction
Is such as basest and contemnedst wretches
For pilferings and most common trespasses
Are punishd with the king must take it ill
That he so slightly valud in his messenger
Should have him thus restraind

Corn

For following her affairsPut in his legs

Whose disposition all the world well knows

Give you good morrow

Glou
The dukes to blame in this twill be ill taken

Exit

Kent
Good king that must approve the common saw
Thou out of heavens benediction comst
To the warm sun
Approach thou beacon to this under globe
That by thy comfortable beams I may
Peruse this letterNothing almost sees miracles
But miseryI know tis from Cordelia
Who hath most fortunately been informd
Of my obscured course and shall find time
From this enormous stateseeking to give
Losses their remediesAll weary and oerwatchd
Take vantage heavy eyes not to behold
This shameful lodging
Fortune good night smile once more turn thy wheel

He sleeps



Scene III The open Country

Enter Edgar

Edg
I heard myself proclaimd
And by the happy hollow of a tree
Escapd the hunt No port is free no place
That guard and most unusual vigilance
Does not attend my taking While I may scape
I will preserve myself and am bethought
To take the basest and most poorest shape
That ever penury in contempt of man
Brought near to beast my face Ill grime with filth
Blanket my loins elf all my hair in knots
And with presented nakedness outface
The winds and persecutions of the sky
The country gives me proof and precedent
Of Bedlam beggars who with roaring voices
Strike in their numbd and mortified bare arms
Pins wooden pricks nails sprigs of rosemary
And with this horrible object from low farms
Poor pelting villages sheepcotes and mills
Sometime with lunatic bans sometime with prayers
Enforce their charityPoor Turlygod poor Tom
Thats something yetEdgar I nothing am

Exit



Scene IV Before Glosters Castle Kent in the stocks

Enter Lear Fool and Gentleman

Lear
Tis strange that they should so depart from home
And not send back my messenger

Gent
As I learnd
The night before there was no purpose in them
Of this remove

Kent
Hail to thee noble master

Lear
Ha
Makst thou this shame thy pastime

Kent
No my lord

Fool
Ha ha he wears cruel garters Horses are tied by the
head dogs and bears by the neck monkeys by the loins and
men by the legs when a man is overlusty at legs then he
wears wooden netherstocks

Lear
Whats he that hath so much thy place mistook
To set thee here

Kent
It is both he and she
Your son and daughter

Lear
No

Kent
Yes

Lear
No I say

Kent
I say yea

Lear
No no they would not

Kent
Yes they have

Lear
By Jupiter I swear no

Kent
By Juno I swear ay

Lear
They durst not dot
They would not could not dot tis worse than murder
To do upon respect such violent outrage
Resolve me with all modest haste which way
Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage
Coming from us

Kent
My lord when at their home
I did commend your highness letters to them
Ere I was risen from the place that showd
My duty kneeling came there a reeking post
Stewd in his haste half breathless panting forth
From Goneril his mistress salutations
Deliverd letters spite of intermission
Which presently they read on whose contents
They summond up their meiny straight took horse
Commanded me to follow and attend
The leisure of their answer gave me cold looks
And meeting here the other messenger
Whose welcome I perceivd had poisond mine
Being the very fellow which of late
Displayd so saucily against your highness
Having more man than wit about me drew
He raisd the house with loud and coward cries
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
The shame which here it suffers

Fool
Winters not gone yet if the wild geese fly that way
 Fathers that wear rags
 Do make their children blind
 But fathers that bear bags
 Shall see their children kind
 Fortune that arrant whore
 Neer turns the key to th poor
But for all this thou shalt have as many dolours for thy
daughters as thou canst tell in a year

Lear
O how this mother swells up toward my heart
Hysterica passiodown thou climbing sorrow
Thy elements belowWhere is this daughter

Kent
With the earl sir here within

Lear
Follow me not
Stay here

Exit

Gent
Made you no more offence but what you speak of

Kent
None
How chance the king comes with so small a number

Fool
An thou hadst been set i the stocks for that question
thou hadst well deserved it

Kent
Why fool

Fool
Well set thee to school to an ant to teach thee theres no
labouring in the winter All that follow their noses are led by
their eyes but blind men and theres not a nose among twenty
but can smell him thats stinking Let go thy hold when a great
wheel runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with following
it but the great one that goes up the hill let him draw thee
after
When a wise man gives thee better counsel give me mine again I
would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it
 That sir which serves and seeks for gain
 And follows but for form
 Will pack when it begins to rain
 And leave thee in the storm
 But I will tarry the fool will stay
 And let the wise man fly
 The knave turns fool that runs away
 The fool no knave perdy

Kent
Where learnd you this fool

Fool
Not i the stocks fool

Reenter Lear with Gloster

Lear
Deny to speak with me They are sick they are weary
They have travelld all the night Mere fetches
The images of revolt and flying off
Fetch me a better answer

Glou
My dear lord
You know the fiery quality of the duke
How unremovable and fixd he is
In his own course

Lear
Vengeance plague death confusion
Fiery What quality why Gloster Gloster
Id speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife

Glou
Well my good lord I have informd them so

Lear
Informd them Dost thou understand me man

Glou
Ay my good lord

Lear
The King would speak with Cornwall the dear father
Would with his daughter speak commands her service
Are they informd of thisMy breath and blood
Fiery the fiery dukeTell the hot duke that
No but not yet may be he is not well
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
Whereto our health is bound we are not ourselves
When nature being oppressd commands the mind
To suffer with the body Ill forbear
And am fallen out with my more headier will
To take the indisposd and sickly fit
For the sound manDeath on my state Wherefore
Looking on Kent
Should he sit here This act persuades me
That this remotion of the duke and her
Is practice only Give me my servant forth
Go tell the duke ands wife Id speak with them
Now presently bid them come forth and hear me
Or at their chamber door Ill beat the drum
Till it cry Sleep to death

Glou
I would have all well betwixt you

Exit

Lear
O me my heart my rising heartbut down

Fool
Cry to it nuncle as the cockney did to the eels when she
put em i the paste alive she knapped em o the coxcombs with
a stick and cried Down wantons down Twas her brother that
in pure kindness to his horse buttered his hay

Enter Cornwall Regan Gloster and Servants

Lear
Goodmorrow to you both

Corn
Hail to your grace

Kent is set at liberty

Reg
I am glad to see your highness

Lear
Regan I think you are I know what reason
I have to think so if thou shouldst not be glad
I would divorce me from thy mothers tomb
Sepulchring an adultressTo Kent O are you free
Some other time for thatBeloved Regan
Thy sisters naught O Regan she hath tied
Sharptoothd unkindness like a vulture here
Points to his heart
I can scarce speak to thee thoult not believe
With how depravd a qualityO Regan

Reg
I pray you sir take patience I have hope
You less know how to value her desert
Than she to scant her duty

Lear
Say how is that

Reg
I cannot think my sister in the least
Would fail her obligation if sir perchance
She have restraind the riots of your followers
Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end
As clears her from all blame

Lear
My curses on her

Reg
O sir you are old
Nature in you stands on the very verge
Of her confine you should be ruld and led
By some discretion that discerns your state
Better than you yourself Therefore I pray you
That to our sister you do make return
Say you have wrongd her sir

Lear
Ask her forgiveness
Do you but mark how this becomes the house
Dear daughter I confess that I am old
Kneeling
Age is unnecessary on my knees I beg
That youll vouchsafe me raiment bed and food

Reg
Good sir no more These are unsightly tricks
Return you to my sister

Lear
Rising Never Regan
She hath abated me of half my train
Lookd black upon me struck me with her tongue
Most serpentlike upon the very heart
All the stord vengeances of heaven fall
On her ingrateful top Strike her young bones
You taking airs with lameness

Corn
Fie sir fie

Lear
You nimble lightnings dart your blinding flames
Into her scornful eyes Infect her beauty
You fensuckd fogs drawn by the powerful sun
To fall and blast her pride

Reg
O the blest gods
So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on

Lear
No Regan thou shalt never have my curse
Thy tenderhefted nature shall not give
Thee oer to harshness her eyes are fierce but thine
Do comfort and not burn Tis not in thee
To grudge my pleasures to cut off my train
To bandy hasty words to scant my sizes
And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
Against my coming in thou better knowst
The offices of nature bond of childhood
Effects of courtesy dues of gratitude
Thy half o the kingdom hast thou not forgot
Wherein I thee endowd

Reg
Good sir to the purpose

Lear
Who put my man i the stocks

Tucket within

Corn
What trumpets that

Reg
I knowtmy sisters this approves her letter
That she would soon be here

Enter Oswald

Is your lady come

Lear
This is a slave whose easyborrowed pride
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows
Out varlet from my sight

Corn
What means your grace

Lear
Who stockd my servant Regan I have good hope
Thou didst not know ontWho comes here O heavens

Enter Goneril

If you do love old men if your sweet sway
Allow obedience if yourselves are old
Make it your cause send down and take my part
To Goneril Art not ashamd to look upon this beard
O Regan wilt thou take her by the hand

Gon
Why not by the hand sir How have I offended
Alls not offence that indiscretion finds
And dotage terms so

Lear
O sides you are too tough
Will you yet holdHow came my man i the stocks

Corn
I set him there sir but his own disorders
Deservd much less advancement

Lear
You did you

Reg
I pray you father being weak seem so
If till the expiration of your month
You will return and sojourn with my sister
Dismissing half your train come then to me
I am now from home and out of that provision
Which shall be needful for your entertainment

Lear
Return to her and fifty men dismissd
No rather I abjure all roofs and choose
To wage against the enmity o the air
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl
Necessitys sharp pinchReturn with her
Why the hotblooded France that dowerless took
Our youngest born I could as well be brought
To knee his throne and squirelike pension beg
To keep base life afootReturn with her
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
To this detested groom
Pointing to Oswald

Gon
At your choice sir

Lear
I prythee daughter do not make me mad
I will not trouble thee my child farewell
Well no more meet no more see one another
But yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter
Or rather a disease thats in my flesh
Which I must needs call mine thou art a boil
A plague sore an embossed carbuncle
In my corrupted blood But Ill not chide thee
Let shame come when it will I do not call it
I do not bid the thunderbearer shoot
Nor tell tales of thee to highjudging Jove
Mend when thou canst be better at thy leisure
I can be patient I can stay with Regan
I and my hundred knights

Reg
Not altogether so
I lookd not for you yet nor am provided
For your fit welcome Give ear sir to my sister
For those that mingle reason with your passion
Must be content to think you old and so
But she knows what she does

Lear
Is this well spoken

Reg
I dare avouch it sir what fifty followers
Is it not well What should you need of more
Yea or so many sith that both charge and danger
Speak gainst so great a number How in one house
Should many people under two commands
Hold amity Tis hard almost impossible

Gon
Why might not you my lord receive attendance
From those that she calls servants or from mine

Reg
Why not my lord If then they chancd to slack you
We could control them If you will come to me
For now I spy a dangerI entreat you
To bring but fiveandtwenty to no more
Will I give place or notice

Lear
I gave you all

Reg
And in good time you gave it

Lear
Made you my guardians my depositaries
But kept a reservation to be followd
With such a number What must I come to you
With fiveandtwenty Regan said you so

Reg
And speakt again my lord no more with me

Lear
Those wicked creatures yet do look wellfavourd
When others are more wicked not being the worst
Stands in some rank of praise
To Goneril Ill go with thee
Thy fifty yet doth double fiveandtwenty
And thou art twice her love

Gon
Hear me my lord
What need you fiveandtwenty ten or five
To follow in a house where twice so many
Have a command to tend you

Reg
What need one

Lear
O reason not the need our basest beggars
Are in the poorest thing superfluous
Allow not nature more than nature needs
Mans life is cheap as beasts thou art a lady
If only to go warm were gorgeous
Why nature needs not what thou gorgeous wearst
Which scarcely keeps thee warmBut for true need
You heavens give me that patience patience I need
You see me here you gods a poor old man
As full of grief as age wretched in both
If it be you that stirs these daughters hearts
Against their father fool me not so much
To bear it tamely touch me with noble anger
And let not womens weapons waterdrops
Stain my mans cheeksNo you unnatural hags
I will have such revenges on you both
That all the world shallI will do such things
What they are yet I know not but they shall be
The terrors of the earth You think Ill weep
No Ill not weep
I have full cause of weeping but this heart
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
Or ere Ill weepO fool I shall go mad

Exeunt Lear Gloster Kent and Fool Storm heard at a
distance

Corn
Let us withdraw twill be a storm

Reg
This house is little the old man and his people
Cannot be well bestowd

Gon

Reg
For his particular Ill receive him gladly
But not one follower

Gon
So am I purposd
Where is my lord of Gloster

Corn
Followed the old man forthhe is returnd

Reenter Gloster

Glou
The king is in high rage

Corn
Whither is he going

Glou
He calls to horse but will I know not whither

Corn
Tis best to give him way he leads himself

Gon
My lord entreat him by no means to stay

Glou
Alack the night comes on and the high winds
Do sorely ruffle for many miles about
Theres scarce a bush

Reg
O sir to wilful men
The injuries that they themselves procure
Must be their schoolmasters Shut up your doors
He is attended with a desperate train
And what they may incense him to being apt
To have his ear abusd wisdom bids fear

Corn
Shut up your doors my lord tis a wild night
My Regan counsels well come out o the storm

Exeunt



ACT III

Scene I A Heath

A storm with thunder and lightning Enter Kent and a Gentleman
meeting

Kent
Whos there besides foul weather

Gent
One minded like the weather most unquietly

Kent
I know you Wheres the king

Gent
Contending with the fretful elements
Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea
Or swell the curled waters bove the main
That things might change or cease tears his white hair
Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage
Catch in their fury and make nothing of
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn
The toandfroconflicting wind and rain
This night wherein the cubdrawn bear would couch
The lion and the bellypinched wolf
Keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs
And bids what will take all

Kent
But who is with him

Gent
None but the fool who labours to outjest
His heartstruck injuries

Kent
Sir I do know you
And dare upon the warrant of my note
Commend a dear thing to you There is division
Although as yet the face of it be coverd
With mutual cunning twixt Albany and Cornwall
Who haveas who have not that their great stars
Throne and set highservants who seem no less
Which are to France the spies and speculations
Intelligent of our state what hath been seen
Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
Against the old kind king or something deeper
Whereof perchance these are but furnishings
But true it is from France there comes a power
Into this scatterd kingdom who already
Wise in our negligence have secret feet
In some of our best ports and are at point
To show their open bannerNow to you
If on my credit you dare build so far
To make your speed to Dover you shall find
Some that will thank you making just report
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
The king hath cause to plain
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding
And from some knowledge and assurance offer
This office to you

Gent
I will talk further with you

Kent
No do not
For confirmation that I am much more
Than my out wall open this purse and take
What it contains If you shall see Cordelia
As fear not but you shallshow her this ring
And she will tell you who your fellow is
That yet you do not know Fie on this storm
I will go seek the king

Gent
Give me your hand have you no more to say

Kent
Few words but to effect more than all yet
That when we have found the kingin which your pain
That way Ill thishe that first lights on him
Holla the other

Exeunt severally



Scene II Another part of the heath Storm continues

Enter Lear and Fool

Lear
Blow winds and crack your cheeks rage blow
You cataracts and hurricanoes spout
Till you have drenchd our steeples drownd the cocks
You sulphurous and thoughtexecuting fires
Vaunt couriers to oakcleaving thunderbolts
Singe my white head And thou allshaking thunder
Strike flat the thick rotundity o the world
Crack natures moulds all germens spill at once
That make ingrateful man

Fool
O nuncle court holy water in a dry house is better than this
rain water out o door Good nuncle in and ask thy daughters
blessing heres a night pities nether wise men nor fools

Lear
Rumble thy bellyful Spit fire spout rain
Nor rain wind thunder fire are my daughters
I tax not you you elements with unkindness
I never gave you kingdom calld you children
You owe me no subscription then let fall
Your horrible pleasure here I stand your slave
A poor infirm weak and despisd old man
But yet I call you servile ministers
That will with two pernicious daughters join
Your highengenderd battles gainst a head
So old and white as this O O tis foul

Fool
He that has a house to put s head in has a good headpiece
 The codpiece that will house
 Before the head has any
 The head and he shall louse
 So beggars marry many
 The man that makes his toe
 What he his heart should make
 Shall of a corn cry woe
 And turn his sleep to wake
for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a
glass

Lear
No I will be the pattern of all patience
I will say nothing

Enter Kent


Kent
Whos there

Fool
Marry heres grace and a codpiece thats a wise man and a fool

Kent
Alas sir are you here Things that love night
Love not such nights as these the wrathful skies
Gallow the very wanderers of the dark
And make them keep their caves since I was man
Such sheets of fire such bursts of horrid thunder
Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never
Remember to have heard mans nature cannot carry
Th affliction nor the fear

Lear
Let the great gods
That keep this dreadful pother oer our heads
Find out their enemies now Tremble thou wretch
That hast within thee undivulged crimes
Unwhippd of justice hide thee thou bloody hand
Thou perjurd and thou simular man of virtue
That art incestuous caitiff to pieces shake
That under covert and convenient seeming
Hast practisd on mans life close pentup guilts
Rive your concealing continents and cry
These dreadful summoners graceI am a man
More sinnd against than sinning

Kent
Alack bareheaded
Gracious my lord hard by here is a hovel
Some friendship will it lend you gainst the tempest
Repose you there whilst I to this hard house
More harder than the stones whereof tis raisd
Which even but now demanding after you
Denied me to come inreturn and force
Their scanted courtesy

Lear
My wits begin to turn
Come on my boy how dost my boy art cold
I am cold myselfWhere is this straw my fellow
The art of our necessities is strange
That can make vile things precious Come your hovel
Poor fool and knave I have one part in my heart
Thats sorry yet for thee

Fool
Singing
 He that has and a little tiny wit
 With hey ho the wind and the rain
 Must make content with his fortunes fit
 For the rain it raineth every day

Lear
True boyCome bring us to this hovel

Exeunt Lear and Kent

Fool
This is a brave night to cool a courtezan
Ill speak a prophecy ere I go
 When priests are more in word than matter
 When brewers mar their malt with water
 When nobles are their tailors tutors
 No heretics burnd but wenches suitors
 When every case in law is right
 No squire in debt nor no poor knight
 When slanders do not live in tongues
 Nor cutpurses come not to throngs
 When usurers tell their gold i the field
 And bawds and whores do churches build
 Then shall the realm of Albion
 Come to great confusion
 Then comes the time who lives to seet
 That going shall be usd with feet
This prophecy Merlin shall make for I live before his time

Exit



Scene III A Room in Glosters Castle

Enter Gloster and Edmund

Glou
Alack alack Edmund I like not this unnatural dealing When I
desired their leave that I might pity him they took from me the
use of mine own house charged me on pain of perpetual displeasure
neither to speak of him entreat for him nor any way sustain him

Edm
Most savage and unnatural

Glou
Go to say you nothing There is division betwixt the dukes
and a worse matter than that I have received a letter this
nighttis dangerous to be spokenI have locked the letter in
my closet these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
home theres part of a power already footed we must incline to
the king I will seek him and privily relieve him go you and
maintain talk with the duke that my charity be not of him
perceived if he ask for me I am ill and gone to bed If I
die for it as no less is threatened me the king my old master
must be relieved There is some strange thing toward Edmund
pray you be careful

Exit

Edm
This courtesy forbid thee shall the duke
Instantly know and of that letter too
This seems a fair deserving and must draw me
That which my father losesno less than all
The younger rises when the old doth fall

Exit



Scene IV A part of the Heath with a Hovel Storm continues

For nature to endure

Kent
Good my lord enter here

Lear
Wilt break my heart

Kent
I had rather break mine own Good my lord enter

Lear
Thou thinkst tis much that this contentious storm
Invades us to the skin so tis to thee
But where the greater malady is fixd
The lesser is scarce felt Thoudst shun a bear
But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea
Thoudst meet the bear i the mouth When the minds free
The bodys delicate the tempest in my mind
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
Save what beats thereFilial ingratitude
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
For lifting food totBut I will punish home
No I will weep no moreIn such a night
To shut me outPour on I will endure
In such a night as this O Regan Goneril
Your old kind father whose frank heart gave all
O that way madness lies let me shun that
No more of that

Kent
Good my lord enter here

Lear
Prythee go in thyself seek thine own ease
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
On things would hurt me moreBut Ill go in
To the Fool In boy go firstYou houseless poverty
Nay get thee in Ill pray and then Ill sleep

Fool goes in

Poor naked wretches wheresoeer you are
That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides
Your loopd and windowd raggedness defend you
From seasons such as these O I have taen
Too little care of this Take physic pomp
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel
That thou mayst shake the superflux to them
And show the heavens more just

Edg
Within Fathom and half fathom and half Poor Tom

The Fool runs out from the hovel

Fool

Edg
Who gives anything to poor Tom whom the foul fiend hath led
through fire and through flame through ford and whirlpool oer
bog and quagmire that hath laid knives under his pillow and
halters in his pew set ratsbane by his porridge made him proud
of heart to ride on a bay trotting horse over fourinched
bridges to course his own shadow for a traitorBless thy five

Fool

Lear
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
Hang fated oer mens faults light on thy daughters

Kent
He hath no daughters sir

Lear
Death traitor nothing could have subdud nature
To such a lowness but his unkind daughters
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
Should have thus little mercy on their flesh
Judicious punishment twas this flesh begot
Those pelican daughters

Edg
Pillicock sat on Pillicockhill
Halloo halloo loo loo

Fool
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen

Edg
Take heed o th foul fiend obey thy parents keep thy word
justly swear not commit not with mans sworn spouse set not

Lear

Edg
A servingman proud in heart and mind that curled my hair
wore gloves in my cap served the lust of my mistress heart and
did the act of darkness with her swore as many oaths as I spake
words and broke them in the sweet face of heaven one that
slept in the contriving of lust and waked to do it wine loved
I deeply dice dearly and in woman outparamourd the Turk
false of heart light of ear bloody of hand hog in sloth fox
in stealth wolf in greediness dog in madness lion in prey
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray
thy poor heart to woman keep thy foot out of brothel thy hand
out of placket thy pen from lenders book and defy the foul
fiendStill through the hawthorn blows the cold wind says
suum mun nonny Dolphin my boy boy sessa let him trot by

Storm still continues

uncovered body this extremity of the skiesIs man no more than
this Consider him well Thou owest the worm no silk the beast

unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare forked
animal as thou artOff off you lendingsCome unbutton

Scene V A Room in Glosters Castle

Enter Cornwall and Edmund

Corn
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house

Edm
How my lord I may be censured that nature thus gives way to
loyalty something fears me to think of

Corn
I now perceive it was not altogether your brothers evil
disposition made him seek his death but a provoking merit set
awork by a reproveable badness in himself

Edm
How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just This
is the letter he spoke of which approves him an intelligent
party to the advantages of France O heavens that this treason
were notor not I the detector

Corn
Go with me to the duchess

Edm
If the matter of this paper be certain you have mighty business
in hand

Corn
True or false it hath made thee earl of Gloster Seek out
where thy father is that he may be ready for our apprehension

Edm
Aside If I find him comforting the king it will stuff his
suspicion more fullyI will persever in my course of loyalty
though the conflict be sore between that and my blood

Corn
I will lay trust upon thee and thou shalt find a dearer father
in my love

Theyll mar my counterfeiting

Lear

Tray Blanch and Sweetheart see they bark at me

Edg
Tom will throw his head at themAvaunt you curs
 Be thy mouth or black or white
 Tooth that poisons if it bite
 Mastiff greyhound mongrel grim
 Hound or spaniel brach or lym
 Or bobtail tike or trundletail

 For with throwing thus my head
 Dogs leap the hatch and all are fled

With thine and all that offer to defend him
Stand in assured loss take up take up
And follow me that will to some provision
Give thee quick conduct

This rest might yet have balmd thy broken sinews
Which if convenience will not allow
Stand in hard cureCome help to bear thy master
To the Fool Thou must not stay behind

Glou
Come come away

Exeunt Kent Gloster and the Fool bearing off Lear

Edg
When we our betters see bearing our woes
We scarcely think our miseries our foes
Who alone suffers suffers most i the mind
Leaving free things and happy shows behind
But then the mind much sufferance doth oerskip
When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship
How light and portable my pain seems now
When that which makes me bend makes the king bow
He childed as I fatheredTom away
Mark the high noises and thyself bewray
When false opinion whose wrong thought defiles thee
In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee
What will hap more tonight safe scape the king
Lurk lurk

ACT IV

Scene I The heath

Enter Edgar

Edg
Yet better thus and known to be contemnd
Than still contemnd and flatterd To be worst
The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune
Stands still in esperance lives not in fear
The lamentable change is from the best
The worst returns to laughter Welcome then
Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
Owes nothing to thy blastsBut who comes here

Enter Gloster led by an Old Man

My father poorly ledWorld world O world
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee
Life would not yield to age

Old Man
O my good lord
I have been your tenant and your fathers tenant
These fourscore years

Glou
Away get thee away good friend be gone
Thy comforts can do me no good at all
Thee they may hurt

Old Man
You cannot see your way

Glou
I have no way and therefore want no eyes
I stumbled when I saw full oft tis seen
Our means secure us and our mere defects
Prove our commoditiesO dear son Edgar
The food of thy abused fathers wrath
Might I but live to see thee in my touch
Id say I had eyes again

Old Man
How now Whos there

Edg
Aside O gods Who ist can say I am at the worst

Old Man

Aside And worse I may be yet The worst is not
So long as we can say This is the worst

Old Man
Fellow where goest

Glou
Is it a beggarman

Old Man
Madman and beggar too

Glou
He has some reason else he could not beg
I the last nights storm I such a fellow saw
Which made me think a man a worm my son
Came then into my mind and yet my mind
Was then scarce friends with him I have heard more since
As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods
They kill us for their sport

Edg
Aside How should this be
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow
Angering itself and othersBless thee master

Glou
Is that the naked fellow

Old Man
Ay my lord

Glou
Then prythee get thee gone if for my sake
Thou wilt oertake us hence a mile or twain

And bring some covering for this naked soul
Which Ill entreat to lead me

Old Man
Alack sir he is mad

Tis the times plague when madmen lead the blind
Do as I bid thee or rather do thy pleasure
Above the rest be gone

Glou
Here take this purse thou whom the heavens plagues
Have humbled to all strokes that I am wretched
Makes thee the happierheavens deal so still
Let the superfluous and lustdieted man
That slaves your ordinance that will not see
Because he does not feel feel your power quickly
So distribution should undo excess
And each man have enoughDost thou know Dover

Edg
Ay master

Glou
There is a cliff whose high and bending head
Looks fearfully in the confined deep
Bring me but to the very brim of it
And Ill repair the misery thou dost bear
With something rich about me from that place

Edg
Give me thy arm
Poor Tom shall lead thee

Scene II Before the Duke of Albanys Palace

Enter Goneril and Edmund Oswald meeting them

Gon
Welcome my lord I marvel our mild husband
Not met us on the wayNow wheres your master

Osw
Madam within but never man so changd
I told him of the army that was landed
He smild at it I told him you were coming
His answer was The worse Of Glosters treachery
And of the loyal service of his son
When I informd him then he calld me sot
And told me I had turnd the wrong side out
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him
What like offensive

Gon
To Edmund Then shall you go no further
It is the cowish terror of his spirit
That dares not undertake hell not feel wrongs
Which tie him to an answer Our wishes on the way
May prove effects Back Edmund to my brother
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers
I must change arms at home and give the distaff
Into my husbands hands This trusty servant
Shall pass between us ere long you are like to hear
If you dare venture in your own behalf
A mistresss command Giving a favour
Wear this spare speech
Decline your head this kiss if it durst speak
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air
Conceive and fare thee well

Edm
Yours in the ranks of death

Exit Edmund

Gon
My most dear Gloster
O the difference of man and man
To thee a womans services are due
My fool usurps my body

Osw
Madam here comes my lord

Exit

Enter Albany

Gon
I have been worth the whistle

Alb
O Goneril
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
Blows in your face I fear your disposition
That nature which contemns it origin
Cannot be bordered certain in itself
She that herself will sliver and disbranch
From her material sap perforce must wither
And come to deadly use

Gon
No more the text is foolish

Alb
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile
Filths savour but themselves What have you done
Tigers not daughters what have you performd
A father and a gracious aged man
Whose reverence even the headluggd bear would lick
Most barbarous most degenerate have you madded
Could my good brother suffer you to do it
A man a prince by him so benefited
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences
It will come
Humanity must perforce prey on itself
Like monsters of the deep

Gon
Milkliverd man
That bearst a cheek for blows a head for wrongs
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
Thine honour from thy suffering that not knowst
Fools do those villains pity who are punishd
Ere they have done their mischief Wheres thy drum
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land
With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats
Whiles thou a moral fool sittst still and criest
Alack why does he so

Alb
See thyself devil
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
So horrid as in woman

Gon
O vain fool

Alb
Thou changed and selfcoverd thing for shame
Bemonster not thy feature Weret my fitness
To let these hands obey my blood
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
Thy flesh and boneshoweer thou art a fiend
A womans shape doth shield thee

Gon
Marry your manhood now

Enter a Messenger

Alb
What news

Mess
O my good lord the Duke of Cornwalls dead
Slain by his servant going to put out
The other eye of Gloster

Alb
Glosters eyes

Mess
A servant that he bred thrilld with remorse
Opposd against the act bending his sword
To his great master who thereat enragd
Flew on him and amongst them felld him dead
But not without that harmful stroke which since
Hath pluckd him after

Alb
This shows you are above
You justicers that these our nether crimes
So speedily can vengeBut O poor Gloster
Lost he his other eye

Mess
Both both my lord
This letter madam craves a speedy answer
Tis from your sister

Gon
Aside One way I like this well
But being widow and my Gloster with her
May all the building in my fancy pluck
Upon my hateful life another way
The news is not so tartIll read and answer

Exit

Alb
Where was his son when they did take his eyes

Mess
Come with my lady hither

Alb
He is not here

Mess
No my good lord I met him back again

Alb
Knows he the wickedness

Mess
Ay my good lord Twas he informd against him
And quit the house on purpose that their punishment
Might have the freer course

Alb
Gloster I live
To thank thee for the love thou showdst the king
And to revenge thine eyesCome hither friend
Tell me what more thou knowst

Exeunt



Scene III The French camp near Dover

Enter Kent and a Gentleman

Kent
Why the king of France is so suddenly gone back know you the
reason

Gent
Something he left imperfect in the state which since his coming
forth is thought of which imports to the kingdom so much fear
and danger that his personal return was most required and
necessary

Kent
Who hath he left behind him general

Gent
The Mareschal of France Monsieur La Far

Kent
Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief

Gent
Ay sir she took them read them in my presence
And now and then an ample tear trilld down
Her delicate cheek it seemd she was a queen
Over her passion who most rebellike
Sought to be king oer her

Kent
O then it movd her

Gent
Not to a rage patience and sorrow strove
Who should express her goodliest You have seen
Sunshine and rain at once her smiles and tears
Were like a better day those happy smilets
That playd on her ripe lip seemd not to know
What guests were in her eyes which parted thence
As pearls from diamonds droppdIn brief sorrow
Would be a rarity most belovd if all
Could so become it

Kent
Made she no verbal question

Gent
Faith once or twice she heavd the name of father
Pantingly forth as if it pressd her heart
Cried Sisters sistersShame of ladies sisters
Kent father sisters What i the storm i the night
Let pity not be believdThere she shook
The holy water from her heavenly eyes
And clamour moistend then away she started
To deal with grief alone

Kent
It is the stars
The stars above us govern our conditions
Else one self mate and mate could not beget
Such different issues You spoke not with her since

Gent
No

Kent
Was this before the king returnd

Gent
No since

Kent
Well sir the poor distressed Lears i the town
Who sometime in his better tune remembers
What we are come about and by no means
Will yield to see his daughter

Gent
Why good sir

Kent
A sovereign shame so elbows him his own unkindness
That strippd her from his benediction turnd her
To foreign casualties gave her dear rights
To his doghearted daughtersthese things sting
His mind so venomously that burning shame
Detains him from Cordelia

Gent
Alack poor gentleman

Kent
Of Albanys and Cornwalls powers you heard not

Gent
Tis so they are afoot

Kent
Well sir Ill bring you to our master Lear
And leave you to attend him some dear cause
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile
When I am known aright you shall not grieve
Lending me this acquaintance I pray you go
Along with me

Exeunt



Scene IV The French camp A Tent

Enter Cordelia Physician and Soldiers

Cor
Alack tis he why he was met even now
As mad as the vexd sea singing aloud
Crownd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds
With harlocks hemlock nettles cuckooflowers
Darnel and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining cornA century send forth
Search every acre in the highgrown field
And bring him to our eye Exit an Officer
What can mans wisdom
In the restoring his bereaved sense
He that helps him take all my outward worth

Phys
There is means madam
Our foster nurse of nature is repose
The which he lacks that to provoke in him
Are many simples operative whose power
Will close the eye of anguish

Cor
All blessd secrets
All you unpublishd virtues of the earth
Spring with my tears be aidant and remediate
In the good mans distressSeek seek for him
Lest his ungovernd rage dissolve the life
That wants the means to lead it

Enter a Messenger

Mess
News madam
The British powers are marching hitherward

Cor
Tis known before our preparation stands
In expectation of themO dear father
It is thy business that I go about
Therefore great France
My mourning and important tears hath pitied
No blown ambition doth our arms incite
But love dear love and our agd fathers right
Soon may I hear and see him

Exeunt



Scene V A Room in Glosters Castle

Enter Regan and Oswald

Reg
But are my brothers powers set forth

Osw
Ay madam

Reg
Himself in person there

Osw
Madam with much ado
Your sister is the better soldier

Reg
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home

Osw
No madam

Reg
What might import my sisters letter to him

Osw
I know not lady

Reg
Faith he is posted hence on serious matter
It was great ignorance Glosters eyes being out
To let him live where he arrives he moves
All hearts against us Edmund I think is gone
In pity of his misery to despatch
His nighted life moreover to descry
The strength o the enemy

Osw
I must needs after him madam with my letter

Reg
Our troops set forth tomorrow stay with us
The ways are dangerous

Osw
I may not madam
My lady chargd my duty in this business

Reg
Why should she write to Edmund Might not you
Transport her purposes by word Belike
SomethingI know not whatIll love thee much
Let me unseal the letter

Osw
Madam I had rather

Reg
I know your lady does not love her husband
I am sure of that and at her late being here
She gave strange eyeliads and most speaking looks
To noble Edmund I know you are of her bosom

Osw
I madam

Reg
I speak in understanding you are I knowt
Therefore I do advise you take this note
My lord is dead Edmund and I have talkd
And more convenient is he for my hand
Than for your ladysYou may gather more
If you do find him pray you give him this
And when your mistress hears thus much from you
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her
So fare you well
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off

Osw
Would I could meet him madam I should show
What party I do follow

Reg
Fare thee well

Exeunt



Scene VI The country near Dover

Enter Gloster and Edgar dressed like a peasant

Glou
When shall I come to the top of that same hill

Edg
You do climb up it now look how we labour

Glou
Methinks the ground is even

Edg
Horrible steep
Hark do you hear the sea

Glou
No truly

Edg
Why then your other senses grow imperfect
By your eyes anguish

Glou
So may it be indeed
Methinks thy voice is alterd and thou speakst
In better phrase and matter than thou didst

Edg
You are much deceivd in nothing am I changd
But in my garments

Glou
Methinks youre better spoken

Edg
Come on sir heres the placestand stillHow fearful
And dizzy tis to cast ones eyes so low
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
Show scarce so gross as beetles half way down
Hangs one that gathers samphiredreadful trade
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head
The fishermen that walk upon the beach
Appear like mice and yond tall anchoring bark
Diminishd to her cock her cock a buoy
Almost too small for sight the murmuring surge
That on the unnumberd idle pebble chafes
Cannot be heard so highIll look no more
Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight
Topple down headlong

Glou
Set me where you stand

Edg
Give me your handyou are now within a foot
Of th extreme verge for all beneath the moon
Would I not leap upright

Glou
Let go my hand
Here friend s another purse in it a jewel
Well worth a poor mans taking fairies and gods
Prosper it with thee Go thou further off
Bid me farewell and let me hear thee going

Edg
Now fare ye well good sir

Seems to go

Glou
With all my heart

Edg
Aside Why I do trifle thus with his despair
Is done to cure it

Glou
O you mighty gods
This world I do renounce and in your sights
Shake patiently my great affliction off
If I could bear it longer and not fall
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills
My snuff and loathed part of nature should
Burn itself out If Edgar live O bless him
Now fellow fare thee well

Edg
Gone sirfarewell

Gloster leaps and falls along

And yet I know not how conceit may rob
The treasury of life when life itself
Yields to the theft had he been where he thought
By this had thought been pastAlive or dead
Ho you sir friend Hear you sirspeak
Thus might he pass indeedyet he revives
What are you sir

Glou
Away and let me die

Edg
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer feathers air
So many fathom down precipitating
Thoudst shiverd like an egg but thou dost breathe
Hast heavy substance bleedst not speakst art sound
Ten masts at each make not the altitude
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell
Thy life is a miracleSpeak yet again

Glou
But have I falln or no

Edg
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn
Look up aheightthe shrillgorgd lark so far
Cannot be seen or heard do but look up

Glou
Alack I have no eyes
Is wretchedness deprivd that benefit
To end itself by death Twas yet some comfort
When misery could beguile the tyrants rage
And frustrate his proud will

Edg
Give me your arm
UpsoHow ist Feel you your legs You stand

Glou
Too well too well

Edg
This is above all strangeness
Upon the crown o the cliff what thing was that
Which parted from you

Glou
A poor unfortunate beggar

Edg
As I stood here below methought his eyes
Were two full moons he had a thousand noses
Horns whelkd and wavd like the enridged sea
It was some fiend therefore thou happy father
Think that the clearest gods who make them honours
Of mens impossibility have preservd thee

Glou
I do remember now henceforth Ill bear
Affliction till it do cry out itself
Enough enough and die That thing you speak of
I took it for a man often twould say
The fiend the fiendhe led me to that place

Edg
Bear free and patient thoughtsBut who comes here

Enter Lear fantastically dressed up with flowers

The safer sense will neer accommodate
His master thus

Lear
No they cannot touch me for coining
I am the king himself

Edg
O thou sidepiercing sight

Lear
Nature s above art in that respectTheres your press money
That fellow handles his bow like a crowkeeper draw me a
clothiers yardLook look a mouse Peace peacethis piece
of toasted cheese will dot Theres my gauntlet Ill prove it

the clout i the clout hewghGive the word

Edg
Sweet marjoram

Lear
Pass

Glou
I know that voice

Lear
Ha Goneril with a white beardThey flattered me like a dog
and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were
there To say ay and no to everything I saidAy and no
too was no good divinity When the rain came to wet me once and
the wind to make me chatter when the thunder would not peace at
my bidding there I found em there I smelt em out Go to they
are not men o their words they told me I was everything tis a
lieI am not agueproof

Glou
The trick of that voice I do well remember
Ist not the king

Lear
Ay every inch a king
When I do stare see how the subject quakes
I pardon that mans lifeWhat was thy cause
Adultery
Thou shalt not die die for adultery No
The wren goes tot and the small gilded fly
Does lecher in my sight
Let copulation thrive for Glosters bastard son
Was kinder to his father than my daughters
Got tween the lawful sheets
Tot luxury pellmell for I lack soldiers
Behold yond simpering dame
Whose face between her forks presages snow
That minces virtue and does shake the head
To hear of pleasures name
The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes tot
With a more riotous appetite
Down from the waist they are centaurs
Though women all above
But to the girdle do the gods inherit
Beneath is all the fiends theres hell theres darkness
There is the sulphurous pit burning scalding stench
consumption fie fie fie pah pah
Give me an ounce of civet good apothecary to sweeten my
imagination theres money for thee

Glou
O let me kiss that hand

Lear
Let me wipe it first it smells of mortality

Glou
O ruind piece of nature This great world
Shall so wear out to naughtDost thou know me

Lear
I remember thine eyes well enough Dost thou squiny at me
No do thy worst blind Cupid Ill not loveRead thou this
challenge mark but the penning of it

Glou
Were all the letters suns I could not see one

Edg
I would not take this from reportit is
And my heart breaks at it

Lear

Glou
What with the case of eyes

Lear
O ho are you there with me No eyes in your head nor no money
in your purse Your eyes are in a heavy case your purse in a
light yet you see how this world goes

Glou
I see it feelingly

Lear
What art mad A man may see how the world goes with no eyes
Look with thine ears see how yond justice rails upon yond simple
thief Hark in thine ear change places and handydandy which
is the justice which is the thiefThou hast seen a farmers
dog bark at a beggar

Glou
Ay sir

Lear
And the creature run from the cur There thou mightst behold
the great image of authority a dogs obeyed in office
Thou rascal beadle hold thy bloody hand
Why dost thou lash that whore Strip thine own back
Thou hotly lustst to use her in that kind
For which thou whippst her The usurer hangs the cozener
Through tatterd clothes small vices do appear
Robes and furrd gowns hide all Plate sin with gold
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks
Arm it in rags a pygmys straw does pierce it
None does offend noneI say none Ill able em
Take that of me my friend who have the power
To seal the accusers lips Get thee glass eyes
And like a scurvy politician seem
To see the things thou dost notNow now now now
Pull off my boots harder harderso

Edg
O matter and impertinency mixd
Reason in madness

Lear
If thou wilt weep my fortunes take my eyes
I know thee well enough thy name is Gloster
Thou must be patient we came crying hither
Thou knowst the first time that we smell the air
We wawl and cryI will preach to thee mark

Glou
Alack alack the day

Lear
When we are born we cry that we are come
To this great stage of foolsThis a good block
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe
A troop of horse with felt Ill putt in proof
And when I have stoln upon these sonsinlaw
Then kill kill kill kill kill kill

Enter a Gentleman with Attendants

Gent
O here he is lay hand upon himSir
Your most dear daughter

Lear

The natural fool of fortuneUse me well
You shall have ransom Let me have surgeons
I am cut to the brains

Gent
You shall have anything

Lear
No seconds all myself
Why this would make a man a man of salt
To use his eyes for garden waterpots
Ay and for laying Autumns dust

Gent
Good sir

Lear
I will die bravely like a smug bridegroom What
I will be jovial come come I am a king
My masters know you that

Gent
You are a royal one and we obey you

Lear
Then theres life int Nay an you get it you shall get it

Am pregnant to good pity Give me your hand
Ill lead you to some biding

Glou
Hearty thanks
The bounty and the benison of heaven
To boot and boot

Enter Oswald

Osw
A proclaimd prize Most happy
That eyeless head of thine was first framd flesh
To raise my fortunesThou old unhappy traitor
Briefly thyself rememberthe sword is out
That must destroy thee

Glou

Edgar interposes

As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
As badness would desire

Glou
What is he dead

Edg
Sit you down father rest you
Lets see these pockets the letters that he speaks of
May be my friendsHes dead I am only sorry
He had no other deathsman Let us see
Leave gentle wax and manners blame us not

Reads Let our reciprocal vows be remembered You have many
opportunities to cut him off if your will want not time and
place will be fruitfully offered There is nothing done if he
return the conqueror then am I the prisoner and his bed my
gaol from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me and supply the
place for your labour
Your wife so I would say affectionate servant
Goneril
O indistinguishd space of womans will
A plot upon her virtuous husbands life
And the exchange my brotherHere in the sands
Thee Ill rake up the post unsanctified
Of murderous lechers and in the mature time
With this ungracious paper strike the sight
Of the deathpractisd duke for him tis well
That of thy death and business I can tell

Exit Edgar dragging out the body

Glou
The king is mad how stiff is my vile sense
That I stand up and have ingenious feeling
Of my huge sorrows Better I were distract
So should my thoughts be severd from my griefs
And woes by wrong imaginations lose
The knowledge of themselves

Edg
Give me your hand
A drum afar off
Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum
Come father Ill bestow you with a friend

Exeunt

Kent
To be acknowledgd madam is oerpaid
All my reports go with the modest truth
Nor more nor clippd but so

Cor
Be better suited
These weeds are memories of those worser hours
I prythee put them off

Kent
Pardon dear madam
Yet to be known shortens my made intent
My boon I make it that you know me not
Till time and I think meet

Cor
Then bet so my good lord To the Physician How does the

Cor
O my dear father Restoration hang
Thy medicine on my lips and let this kiss
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
Have in thy reverence made

Kent
Kind and dear princess

Cor
Had you not been their father these white flakes
Had challengd pity of them Was this a face
To be opposd against the warring winds
To stand against the deep dreadbolted thunder
In the most terrible and nimble stroke
Of quick cross lightning to watchpoor perdu
With this thin helm Mine enemys dog
Though he had bit me should have stood that night
Against my fire and wast thou fain poor father
To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn
In short and musty straw Alack alack
Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
Had not concluded allHe wakes speak to him

Doct
Madam do you tis fittest

Cor
How does my royal lord How fares your majesty

Lear
You do me wrong to take me out o the grave
Thou art a soul in bliss but I am bound
Upon a wheel of fire that mine own tears
Do scald like molten lead

Lear
You are a spirit I know when did you die

Cor
Still still far wide

Phys
Hes scarce awake let him alone awhile

Of my condition

Cor
O look upon me sir
And hold your hands in benediction oer me
No sir you must not kneel

Lear
Pray do not mock me
I am a very foolish fond old man
Fourscore and upward not an hour more nor less
And to deal plainly
I fear I am not in my perfect mind
Methinks I should know you and know this man
Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
What place this is and all the skill I have
Remembers not these garments nor I know not
Where I did lodge last night Do not laugh at me
For as I am a man I think this lady
To be my child Cordelia

Cor
And so I am I am

Lear
Be your tears wet yes faith I pray weep not
If you have poison for me I will drink it
I know you do not love me for your sisters

You have some cause they have not

Cor
No cause no cause

Lear
Am I in France

Kent
In your own kingdom sir

Lear
Do not abuse me

Phys
Be comforted good madam the great rage

Alb
Our very loving sister well bemet
Sir this I heardthe king is come to his daughter
With others whom the rigour of our state
Forcd to cry out Where I could not be honest

It toucheth us as France invades our land
Not bolds the king with others whom I fear
Most just and heavy causes make oppose

Edm
Sir you speak nobly

Reg
Why is this reasond

Gon
Combine together gainst the enemy

Before you fight the battle ope this letter

Edm
To both these sisters have I sworn my love
Each jealous of the other as the stung
Are of the adder Which of them shall I take
Both one or neither Neither can be enjoyd
If both remain alive to take the widow
Exasperates makes mad her sister Goneril
And hardly shall I carry out my side
Her husband being alive Now then well use
His countenance for the battle which being done
Let her who would be rid of him devise
His speedy taking off As for the mercy
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia
The battle done and they within our power
Shall never see his pardon for my state
Stands on me to defend not to debate

Scene III The British Camp near Dover

Enter in conquest with drum and colours Edmund Lear and
Cordelia prisoners Officers Soldiers c

Edm
Some officers take them away good guard
Until their greater pleasures first be known
That are to censure them

Cor
We are not the first
Who with best meaning have incurrd the worst
For thee oppressed king am I cast down
Myself could else outfrown false fortunes frown
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters

Lear
No no no no Come lets away to prison
We two alone will sing like birds i the cage
When thou dost ask me blessing Ill kneel down
And ask of thee forgiveness so well live
And pray and sing and tell old tales and laugh
At gilded butterflies and hear poor rogues
Talk of court news and well talk with them too
Who loses and who wins whos in whos out
And take upons the mystery of things
As if we were Gods spies and well wear out
In a walld prison packs and sects of great ones
That ebb and flow by the moon

Edm
Take them away

Lear
Upon such sacrifices my Cordelia
The gods themselves throw incense Have I caught thee
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven
And fire us hence like foxes Wipe thine eyes
The goodyears shall devour them flesh and fell
Ere they shall make us weep well see em starve first
Come

Exeunt Lear and Cordelia guarded

Edm
Come hither captain hark
Take thou this note giving a paper go follow them to prison
One step I have advancd thee if thou dost
As this instructs thee thou dost make thy way
To noble fortunes know thou thisthat men
Are as the time is to be tenderminded
Does not become a swordthy great employment
Will not bear question either say thoult dot
Or thrive by other means

Capt
Ill dot my lord

Edm
About it and write happy when thou hast done
MarkI say instantly and carry it so
As I have set it down

Capt
I cannot draw a cart nor eat dried oats
If it be mans work Ill dot

Exit

Flourish Enter Albany Goneril Regan Officers and
Attendants

Alb
Sir you have showd today your valiant strain
And fortune led you well you have the captives
Who were the opposites of this days strife
We do require them of you so to use them
As we shall find their merits and our safety
May equally determine

Edm
Sir I thought it fit
To send the old and miserable king
To some retention and appointed guard
Whose age has charms in it whose title more
To pluck the common bosom on his side
And turn our impressd lances in our eyes
Which do command them With him I sent the queen
My reason all the same and they are ready
Tomorrow or at further space to appear
Where you shall hold your session At this time
We sweat and bleed the friend hath lost his friend
And the best quarrels in the heat are cursd
By those that feel their sharpness
The question of Cordelia and her father
Requires a fitter place

Alb
Sir by your patience
I hold you but a subject of this war
Not as a brother

Reg
Thats as we list to grace him
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
Ere you had spoke so far He led our powers
Bore the commission of my place and person
The which immediacy may well stand up
And call itself your brother

Gon
Not so hot
In his own grace he doth exalt himself
More than in your addition

Reg
In my rights
By me invested he compeers the best

Gon
That were the most if he should husband you

Reg
Jesters do oft prove prophets

Gon
Holla holla
That eye that told you so lookd but asquint

Reg
Lady I am not well else I should answer
From a fullflowing stomachGeneral
Take thou my soldiers prisoners patrimony
Dispose of them of me the walls are thine
Witness the world that I create thee here
My lord and master

Gon
Mean you to enjoy him

Alb
The letalone lies not in your good will

Edm
Nor in thine lord

Alb
Halfblooded fellow yes

Reg
To Edmund Let the drum strike and prove my title thine

Alb
Stay yet hear reasonEdmund I arrest thee
On capital treason and in thine arrest
This gilded serpent pointing to GonerilFor your claim fair
sister
I bar it in the interest of my wife
Tis she is subcontracted to this lord
And I her husband contradict your bans
If you will marry make your loves to me
My lady is bespoke

Gon
An interlude

Alb
Thou art armd Glosterlet the trumpet sound
If none appear to prove upon thy person
Thy heinous manifest and many treasons
There is my pledge throwing down a glove Ill prove it on thy
heart
Ere I taste bread thou art in nothing less
Than I have here proclaimd thee

Reg
Sick O sick

Gon
Aside If not Ill neer trust medicine

Edm

Yet am I noble as the adversary

Alb
Which is that adversary

Edg
Whats he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloster

Edm
Himselfwhat sayst thou to him

Edg
Draw thy sword
That if my speech offend a noble heart
Thy arm may do thee justice here is mine
Behold it is the privilege of mine honours
My oath and my profession I protest
Maugre thy strength youth place and eminence
Despite thy victor sword and firenew fortune
Thy valour and thy heartthou art a traitor
False to thy gods thy brother and thy father
Conspirant gainst this high illustrious prince
And from the extremest upward of thy head
To the descent and dust beneath thy foot
A most toadspotted traitor Say thou No
This sword this arm and my best spirits are bent
To prove upon thy heart whereto I speak
Thou liest

Edm
In wisdom I should ask thy name
But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes
What safe and nicely I might well delay
By rule of knighthood I disdain and spurn
Back do I toss those treasons to thy head
With the hellhated lie oerwhelm thy heart
Whichfor they yet glance by and scarcely bruise
This sword of mine shall give them instant way
Where they shall rest for everTrumpets speak

Alarums They fight Edmund falls

Thou worse than any name read thine own evil

Edm
What you have chargd me with that have I done
And more much more the time will bring it out
Tis past and so am IBut what art thou
That hast this fortune on me If thourt noble
I do forgive thee

Edg
Lets exchange charity
I am no less in blood than thou art Edmund
If more the more thou hast wrongd me
My name is Edgar and thy fathers son
The gods are just and of our pleasant vices
Make instruments to plague us
The dark and vicious place where thee he got
Cost him his eyes

Edm
Thou hast spoken right tis true
The wheel is come full circle I am here

Alb
Methought thy very gait did prophesy
A royal noblenessI must embrace thee
Let sorrow split my heart if ever I
Did hate thee or thy father

Edg
Worthy prince I knowt

Alb
Where have you hid yourself
How have you known the miseries of your father

Edg
By nursing them my lordList a brief tale
And when tis told O that my heart would burst
The bloody proclamation to escape
That followd me so nearO our lives sweetness
That with the pain of death wed hourly die
Rather than die at oncetaught me to shift
Into a madmans rags to assume a semblance
That very dogs disdaind and in this habit
Met I my father with his bleeding rings
Their precious stones new lost became his guide
Led him beggd for him savd him from despair
NeverO faultreveald myself unto him
Until some half hour past when I was armd
Not sure though hoping of this good success
I askd his blessing and from first to last
Told him my pilgrimage but his flawd heart
Alack too weak the conflict to support
Twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief
Burst smilingly

Edm
This speech of yours hath movd me
And shall perchance do good but speak you on
You look as you had something more to say

Alb
If there be more more woeful hold it in
For I am almost ready to dissolve
Hearing of this

Edg
This would have seemd a period
To such as love not sorrow but another
To amplify too much would make much more
And top extremity
Whilst I was big in clamour came there a man
Who having seen me in my worst estate
Shunnd my abhorrd society but then finding
Who twas that so endurd with his strong arms
He fastened on my neck and bellowd out
As hed burst heaven threw him on my father
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
That ever ear receivd which in recounting
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
Began to crack twice then the trumpets sounded
And there I left him trancd

Alb
But who was this

Edg
Kent sir the banishd Kent who in disguise
Followd his enemy king and did him service
Improper for a slave

Enter a Gentleman hastily with a bloody knife

Gent
Help help O help

Edg
What kind of help

Alb
Speak man

Edg
What means that bloody knife

Gent
Tis hot it smokes
It came even from the heart ofO shes dead

Alb

By her is poisoned she hath confessd it

Edm

Now marry in an instant

Edg
Here comes Kent

Alb
Produce their bodies be they alive or dead
This judgement of the heavens that makes us tremble
Touches us not with pity Exit Gentleman

Enter Kent

O is this he
The time will not allow the compliment
That very manners urges

Kent
I am come
To bid my king and master aye good night
Is he not here

Alb
Great thing of us forgot
Speak Edmund wheres the king and wheres Cordelia

The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in

Seest thou this object Kent

Kent
Alack why thus

Edm
Yet Edmund was belovd
The one the other poisoned for my sake
And after slew herself

Alb
Even soCover their faces

Edm
I pant for lifesome good I mean to do
Despite of mine own nature Quickly send
Be brief in itto the castle for my writ
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia
Nay send in time

Alb
Run run O run

Edg
To who my lordWho has the office send
Thy token of reprieve

Edm
Well thought on take my sword
Give it the Captain

Alb
Haste thee for thy life

Exit Edgar

Edm

To hang Cordelia in the prison and
To lay the blame upon her own despair
That she fordid herself

Alb

I know when one is dead and when one lives
Shes dead as earthLend me a looking glass
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone
Why then she lives

Kent
Is this the promisd end

Edg
Or image of that horror

Alb
Fall and cease

Lear
This feather stirs she lives If it be so
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
That ever I have felt

Kent
O my good master Kneeling

Lear
Prythee away

Edg
Tis noble Kent your friend

Lear
A plague upon you murderers traitors all
I might have savd her now shes gone for ever
Cordelia Cordelia stay a little Ha
What ist thou saystHer voice was ever soft
Gentle and lowan excellent thing in woman
I killd the slave that was ahanging thee

Off
Tis true my lords he did

Lear
Did I not fellow
I have seen the day with my good biting falchion
I would have made them skip I am old now
And these same crosses spoil meWho are you
Mine eyes are not o the bestIll tell you straight

Kent
If fortune brag of two she lovd and hated
One of them we behold

Lear
This is a dull sight Are you not Kent

Kent
The same
Your servant KentWhere is your servant Caius

Lear
Hes a good fellow I can tell you that
Hell strike and quickly toohes dead and rotten

Kent
No my good lord I am the very man

Lear
Ill see that straight

Kent
That from your first of difference and decay
Have followd your sad steps

Lear
You are welcome hither

Kent
Nor no man elseAlls cheerless dark and deadly
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves
And desperately are dead

Lear
Ay so I think

Alb
He knows not what he says and vain is it
That we present us to him

Edg
Very bootless

Enter a Officer

Off
Edmund is dead my lord

Alb
Thats but a trifle here
You lords and noble friends know our intent
What comfort to this great decay may come
Shall be applied for us we will resign
During the life of this old majesty
To him our absolute powerto Edgar and Kent you to your
rights
With boot and such addition as your honours
Have more than meritedAll friends shall taste
The wages of their virtue and all foes
The cup of their deservingsO see see

Lear
And my poor fool is hangd No no no life
Why should a dog a horse a rat have life
And thou no breath at all Thoult come no more
Never never never never never
Pray you undo this buttonthank you sir
Do you see this Look on herlookher lips
Look there look there

He dies

Edg
He faintsMy lord my lord

Kent
Break heart I prythee break

Edg
Look up my lord

Kent
Vex not his ghost O let him pass he hates him
That would upon the rack of this rough world
Stretch him out longer

Edg
He is gone indeed

Kent
The wonder is he hath endurd so long
He but usurpd his life

Alb
Bear them from henceOur present business
Is general woeTo Kent and Edgar Friends of my soul you
twain
Rule in this realm and the gord state sustain

Kent
I have a journey sir shortly to go
My master calls meI must not say no

Alb
The weight of this sad time we must obey
Speak what we feel not what we ought to say
The oldest have borne most we that are young
Shall never see so much nor live so long

Exeunt with a dead march
