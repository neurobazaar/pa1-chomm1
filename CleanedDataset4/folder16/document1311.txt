Curtain

SCENE 2

Yesterday evening

Curtain rises on JOHN and MARY in
their suburban home

JOHN

I say dear Dont you think we ought to
plant an acacia

MARY

An acacia whats that John

JOHN

O its one of those trees that they have

MARY

But why John

JOHN

Well you see the house is called The Acacias
and it seems rather silly not to have at
least one

MARY

O I dont think that matters Lots of
places are called lots of things Everyone
does

JOHN

Yes but it might help the postman

MARY

O no it wouldnt dear He wouldnt
know an acacia if he saw it any more than I
should

JOHN

Quite right Mary youre always right
What a clever head youve got

MARY

Have I John Well plant an acacia if
you like Ill ask about it at the grocers

JOHN

You cant get one there

MARY

No but hes sure to know where it can be
got

JOHN

Where do they grow Mary

MARY

I dont know John but I am sure they do
somewhere

JOHN

Somehow I wish sometimes I almost wish
I could have gone abroad for a week or so to
places like where acacias grow naturally

MARY

O would you really John

JOHN

No not really But I just think of it
sometimes

MARY

Where would you have gone

JOHN

O I dont know The East or some such
place Ive often heard people speak of it
and somehow it seemed so

MARY

The East John Not the East I dont
think the East somehow is quite respectable

JOHN

O well its all right I never went and
never shall go now It doesnt matter

MARY the photographs catching her eye

O John I meant to tell you Such a dreadful
thing happened

JOHN

What Mary

MARY

Well Liza was dusting the photographs
and when she came to Janes she says she
hadnt really begun to dust it only looked at
it and it fell down and that bit of glass is
broken right out of it

JOHN

Ask her not to look at it so hard another
time

MARY

O what do you mean John

JOHN

Well thats how she broke it she said so
and as I know you believe in Liza

MARY

Well I cant think shed tell a lie John

JOHN

No of course not But she mustnt look
so hard another time

MARY

And its poor little Janes photograph
She will feel it so

JOHN

O thats all right well get it mended

MARY

Still its a dreadful thing to have happened

JOHN

Well get it mended and if Jane is unhappy
about it she can have Alices frame Alice
is too young to notice it

MARY

She isnt John Shed notice it quick

JOHN

Well George then

MARY looking at photo thoughtfully

Well perhaps George might give up his
frame

JOHN

Yes tell Liza to change it Why not make
her do it now

MARY

Not today John Not on a Sunday
She shall do it tomorrow by the time you get
back from the office

JOHN

All right It might have been worse

MARY

Its bad enough I wish it hadnt happened

JOHN

It might have been worse It might have
been Aunt Martha

MARY

Id sooner it had been her than poor little
Jane

JOHN

If it had been Aunt Marthas photograph
shed have walked in next day and seen it for
certain I know Aunt Martha Then thered
have been trouble

MARY

But John how could she have known

JOHN

I dont know but she would have its a
kind of devilish sense she has

MARY

John

JOHN

Whats the matter

MARY

John What a dreadful word you used
And on a Sunday too Really

JOHN

O Im sorry It slipped out somehow
Im very sorry

Enter LIZA

LIZA

Theres a gentleman to see you sir which
isnt properly speaking a gentleman at all
Not what I should call one that is like

MARY

Not a gentleman Good gracious Liza
Whatever do you mean

LIZA

Hes black

MARY

Black

JOHN reassuring

O yes that would be Ali A queer
old customer Mary perfectly harmless Our
firm gets hundreds of carpets through him
and then one day

MARY

But what is he doing here John

JOHN

Well one day he turned up in London
broke he said and wanted the firm to give
him a little cash Well old Briggs was for
giving him ten shillings But I said heres
a man thats helped us in making thousands
of pounds Lets give him fifty

MARY

Fifty pounds

JOHN

Yes it seems a lot but it seemed only fair
Ten shillings would have been an insult to
the old fellow and hed have taken it as such
You dont know what hed have done

MARY

Well he doesnt want more

JOHN

No I expect hes come to thank me He
seemed pretty keen on getting some cash
Badly broke you see Dont know what he was
doing in London Never can tell with these
fellows East is East and theres an end of it

MARY

How did he trace you here

JOHN

O got the address at the office Briggs
and Cater wont let theirs be known Not
got such a smart little house I expect

MARY

I dont like letting people in that you dont
know where they come from

JOHN

O he comes from the East

MARY

Yes II know But the East doesnt seem
quite to count somehow as the proper sort of
place to come from does it dear

JOHN

No

MARY

Its not like Sydenham or Bromley some
place you can put your finger on

JOHN

Perhaps just for once I dont think theres
any harm in him

MARY

Well just for once But we cant make a
practice of it And you dont want to be
thinking of business on a Sunday your only
day off

JOHN

O it isnt business you know He only
wants to say thank you

MARY

I hope he wont say it in some queer
Eastern way You dont know what these
people

JOHN

O no Show him up Liza

LIZA

As you like mum
Exit

MARY

And you gave him fifty pounds

JOHN

Well old Briggs agreed to it So I suppose
thats what he got Cater paid him

MARY

It seems a lot of money But I think as
the man is actually coming up the stairs
Im glad hes got something to be grateful
for

Enter ALI shown in by LIZA

ALI

Protector of the Just

JOHN

O eryes Good evening

ALI

My soul was parched and you bathed it
in rivers of gold

JOHN

O ah yes

ALI

Wherefore the name Briggs Cater and Beal
shall be magnified and called blessed

JOHN

Ha yes Very good of you

ALI advancing handing trinket

Protector of the Just my offering

JOHN

Your offering

ALI

Hush It is beyond price I am not
bidden to sell it I was in my extremity but
I was not bidden to sell it It is a token of
gratitude a gift as it came to me

JOHN

As it came to you


ALI

Yes it was given me

JOHN

I see Then you had given somebody what
you call rivers of gold

ALI

Not gold it was in Sahara

JOHN

O and what do you give in the Sahara
instead of gold

ALI

Water

JOHN

I see You got it for a glass of water like

ALI

Even so

JOHN

Andand what happened

MARY

I wouldnt take his only crystal dear
Its a nice little thing but to ALI but you
think a lot of it dont you

ALI

Even so

JOHN

But look here what does it do

ALI

Much

JOHN

Well what

ALI

He that taketh this crystal so in his hand
at night and wishes saying At a certain
hour let it be the hour comes and he will
go back eight ten even twelve years if he
will into the past and do a thing again or
act otherwise than he did The day passes
the ten years are accomplished once again he
is here once more but he is what he might
have become had he done that one thing
otherwise

MARY

John

JOHN

II dont understand

ALI

Tonight you wish All tomorrow you
live the last ten years a new way master a
new way how you please Tomorrow night
you are here what those years have made you

JOHN

By Jove

MARY

Have nothing to do with it John

JOHN

All right Mary Im not going to But
do you mean one could go back ten years


ALI

Even so


JOHN

Well it seems odd but Ill take your word
for it But look here you cant live ten years
in a day you know

ALI

My master has power over time

MARY

John dont have anything to do with him

JOHN

All right Mary But who is your master

ALI

He is carved of one piece of jade a god in
the greenest mountains The years are his
dreams This crystal is his treasure Guard
it safely for his power is in this more than
in all the peaks of his native hills See what
I give you master

JOHN

Well really its very good of you

MARY

Good night Mr Ali We are very much
obliged for your kind offer which we are so
sorry we cant avail ourselves of

JOHN

One moment Mary Do you mean that
I can go back ten years and live tilltill now
again and only be away a day

ALI

Start early and you will be here before
midnight

JOHN

Would eight oclock do

ALI

You could be back by eleven that evening

JOHN

I dont quite see how ten years could go
in a single day

ALI

They will go as dreams go

JOHN

Even so it seems rather unusual doesnt
it

ALI

Time is the slave of my master

MARY

John

JOHN

All right Mary In a lower voice Im
only trying to see what hell say

MARY

All right John only

ALI

Is there no step that you would wish
untrodden nor stride that you would make
where once you faltered

JOHN

I say why dont you use it yourself

ALI

I I am afraid of the past But you
Engleesh and the great firm of Briggs Cater
and Beal you are afraid of nothing

JOHN

Ha ha WellI wouldnt go quite as far
as that butwell give me the crystal

MARY

Dont take it John Dont take it

JOHN

Why Mary It wont hurt me

MARY

If it can do all thatif it can do all that

JOHN

Well

MARY

Why you might never have met me

JOHN

Never have met you I never thought of
that

MARY

Leave the past alone John

JOHN

All right Mary I neednt use it But I
want to hear about it its so odd its so
whatyoumightcall queer I dont think I
ever To ALI You mean if I work
hard for ten years which will only be all
tomorrow I may be Governor of the Bank
of England tomorrow night

ALI

Even so

MARY

O dont do it John

JOHN

But you saidIll be back here before
midnight tomorrow

ALI

It is so

JOHN

But the Governor of the Bank of England
would live in the City and hed have a much
bigger house anyway He wouldnt live in
Lewisham

ALI

The crystal will bring you to this house
when the hour is accomplished even
tomorrow night If you be the great banker
you will perhaps come to chastise one of your
slaves who will dwell in this house If you
be head of Briggs and Cater you will come to
give an edict to one of your firm Perchance
this street will be yours and you will come to
show your power unto it But you will come

JOHN

And if the house is not mine

MARY

John John Dont

ALI

Still you will come

JOHN

Shall I remember

ALI

No

JOHN

If I want to do anything different to what
I did how shall I remember when I get back
there

MARY

Dont Dont do anything different John

JOHN

All right

ALI

Choose just before the hour of the step
you desire to change Memory lingers a little
at first and fades away slowly

JOHN

Five minutes

ALI

Even ten

JOHN

Then I can change one thing After that I
forget

ALI

Even so One thing And the rest follows

JOHN

Well its very good of you to make me this
nice present Im sure

ALI

Sell it not Give it as I gave it if the heart
impels So shall it come back one day to the
hills that are brighter than grass made richer
by the gratitude of many men And my
master shall smile thereat and the vale shall
be glad

JOHN

Its very good of you Im sure

MARY

I dont like it John I dont like tampering
with whats gone

ALI

My masters power is in your hands
Farewell

Exit

JOHN

I say hes gone

MARY

O hes a dreadful man

JOHN

I never really meant to take it

MARY

O John I wish you hadnt

JOHN

Why Im not going to use it

MARY

Not going to use it John

JOHN

No no Not if you dont want me to

MARY

O Im so glad

JOHN

And besides I dont want things different
Ive got fond of this little house And Briggs
is a good old sort you know Caters a bit
of an ass but theres no harm in him In
fact Im contented Mary I wouldnt even
change Aunt Martha now

Points at frowning framed photograph
centrally hung

You remember when she first came and
you said Where shall we hang her I said
the cellar You said we couldnt So she had
to go there But I wouldnt change her now
I suppose there are old watchdogs like her in
every family I wouldnt change anything

MARY

O John wouldnt you really

JOHN

No Im contented Grim old soul I
wouldnt even change Aunt Martha

MARY

Im glad of that John I was frightened
I couldnt bear to tamper with the past
You dont know what it is its whats gone
But if it really isnt gone at all if it can be dug
up like that why you dont know what
mightnt happen I dont mind the future
but if the past can come back like that
O dont dont John Dont think of it
It isnt canny Theres the children John

JOHN

Yes yes thats all right Its only a little
ornament I wont use it And I tell you
Im content Happily Its no use to me

MARY

Im so glad youre content John Are you
really Is there nothing that youd have had
different I sometimes thought youd rather
that Jane had been a boy

JOHN

Not a bit of it Well I may have at the
time but Arthurs good enough for me

MARY

Im so glad And theres nothing you ever
regret at all

JOHN

Nothing And you Is there nothing you
regret Mary

MARY

Me Oh no I still think that sofa would
have been better green but you would have
it red

JOHN

Yes so I would No theres nothing I
regret

MARY

I dont suppose theres many men can say
that

JOHN

No I dont suppose they can Theyre
not all married to you I dont suppose
many of them can

MARY smiles

MARY

I should think that very few could say
that they regretted nothing very few
in the whole world

JOHN

Well I wont say nothing

MARY

What is it you regret John

JOHN

Well there is one thing

MARY

And what is that

JOHN

One thing has rankled a bit

MARY

Yes John

JOHN

O its nothing its nothing worth
mentioning But it rankled for years

MARY

What was it John

JOHN

O it seems silly to mention it It was
nothing

MARY

But what

JOHN

O well if you want to know it was once
when I missed a train I dont mind missing
a train but it was the way the porter pushed
me out of the way He pushed me by the
face I couldnt hit back because well you
know what lawyers make of it I might have
been ruined So it just rankled It was years
ago before we married

MARY

Pushed you by the face Good gracious

JOHN

Yes Id like to have caught that train in
spite of him I sometimes think of it still
Silly of me isnt it

MARY

What a brute of a man

JOHN

O I suppose he was doing his silly duty
But it rankled

MARY

Hed no right to do any such thing Hed
no right to touch you

JOHN

O well never mind

MARY

I should like to have been there
Id have

JOHN

O well it cant be helped now but Id
like to have caught it in sp
An idea seizes him

MARY

What is it

JOHN

Cant be helped I said Its the very thing
that can be helped

MARY

Can be helped John Whatever do you
mean

JOHN

I mean hed no right to stop me catching
that train Ive got the crystal and Ill
catch it yet

MARY

O John thats what you said you wouldnt
do

JOHN

No I said Id do nothing to alter the past
And I wont Im too content Mary But
this cant alter it This is nothing

MARY

What were you going to catch the train
for John

JOHN

For London I wasnt at the office then
It was a business appointment There was a
man who had promised to get me a job and
I was going up to

MARY

John it may alter your whole life

JOHN

Now do listen Mary do listen He never
turned up I got a letter from him apologising
to me before I posted mine to him It
turned out he never meant to help me mere
meaningless affabilities He never came to
London that day at all I should have taken
the next train back That cant affect the
future

MARY

Nno John Still I dont like it

JOHN

What difference could it make

MARY

Nnno

JOHN

Think how we met We met at ARCHIEs
wedding I take it one has to go to ones
brothers wedding It would take a pretty
big change to alter that And you were her
bridesmaid We were bound to meet And
having once met well there you are If wed
met by chance in a train or anything like
that well then I admit some little change
might alter it But when we met at ARCHIEs
wedding and you were her bridesmaid why
Mary its a cert Besides I believe in
predestination It was our fate we couldnt
have missed it

MARY

No I suppose not still

JOHN

Well what

MARY

I dont like it

JOHN

O Mary I have so longed to catch that
infernal train Just think of it annoyed on
and off for ten years by the eightfifteen

MARY

Id rather you didnt John

JOHN

But why

MARY

O John suppose theres a railway
accident You might be killed and we should
never meet

JOHN

There wasnt

MARY

There wasnt John What do you mean

JOHN

There wasnt an accident to the eightfifteen
It got safely to London just ten years ago

MARY

Why nor there was

JOHN

You see how groundless your fears are
I shall catch that train and all the rest will
happen the same as before Just think
Mary all those old days again I wish I
could take you with me But you soon will
be But just think of the old days coming
back again Hampton Court again and Kew
and Richmond Park again with all the May
And that bun you bought and the corked
gingerbeer and those birds singing and the
bus past Isleworth O Mary you wouldnt
grudge me that

MARY

Well well then all right John

JOHN

And you will remember there wasnt an
accident wont you

MARY resignedly sadly

O yes John And you wont try to get
rich or do anything silly will you

JOHN

No Mary I only want to catch that
train Im content with the rest The same
things must happen and they must lead me
the same way to you Mary Good night
now dear

MARY

Good night

JOHN

I shall stay here on the sofa holding the
crystal and thinking Then Ill have a
biscuit and start at seven

MARY

Thinking John What about

JOHN

Getting it clear in my mind what I want
to do That one thing and the rest the same
There must be no mistakes

MARY sadly

Good night John

JOHN

Have supper ready at eleven

MARY

Very well John
Exit

JOHN on the sofa after a moment or two

Ill catch that infernal train in spite of him

He takes the crystal and closes it up in
the palm of his left hand

I wish to go back ten years two weeks and
a day at at810 am tomorrow 810 am
tomorrow 810

Reenter MARY in doorway

his fifty pounds

JOHN

Yes Didnt he come to thank me for the
money

MARY

You are sure it wasnt ten shillings

JOHN

Cater paid him I didnt

MARY

Are you sure that Cater didnt give him

JOHN

Its the sort of silly thing Cater would have
done

MARY

O John

JOHN

Hmm

In a secondclass railway carriage

Time Same morning as Scene 1 Act I

Noise and a scene drawn past the
windows The scene showing a
momentary glimpse of fair English hills is
almost entirely placards GIVE HER
BOVRIL GIVE HER OXO
alternately for ever

Occupants JOHN BEAL a girl a man

All sit in stoical silence like the two
images near Luxor The man has the
window seat and therefore the right of
control over the window

MIRALDA CLEMENT

Would you mind having the window open

THE MAN IN THE CORNER shrugging his
shoulders in a shivery way

Ercertainly Meaning he does not mind
He opens the window

MIRALDA CLEMENT

Thank you so much

MAN IN THE CORNER

Not at all He does not mean to contradict
her Stoical silence again

MIRALDA CLEMENT

Would you mind having it shut now I
think it is rather cold

MAN IN THE CORNER

Certainly

He shuts it Silence again

MIRALDA CLEMENT

I think Id like the window open again now
for a bit It is rather stuffy isnt it

MAN IN THE CORNER

Well I think its very cold

MIRALDA CLEMENT

O do you But would you mind opening
it for me

MAN IN THE CORNER

Id much rather it was shut if you dont
mind

She sighs moves her hands slightly and
her pretty face expresses the resignation of
the Christian martyr in the presence of
lions This for the benefit of John

JOHN

Allow me madam

He leans across the windows rightful
owner a bigger man than he and opens his
window

MAN IN THE CORNER shrugs his shoulders
and quite sensibly turns to his paper

MIRALDA

O thank you so much

JOHN

Dont mention it

Silence again

VOICES OF PORTERS Off

Fan Kar Fan Kar

MAN IN THE CORNER gets out

MIRALDA

Could you tell me where this is

JOHN

Yes Elephant and Castle

MIRALDA

Thank you so much It was kind of you to
protect me from that horrid man He wanted
to suffocate me

JOHN

O very glad to assist you Im sure Very
glad

MIRALDA

I should have been afraid to have done it in
spite of him It was splendid of you

JOHN

O that was nothing

MIRALDA

O it was really

JOHN

Only too glad to help you in any little way

MIRALDA

It was so kind of you

JOHN

O not at all

Silence for a bit

MIRALDA

Ive nobody to help me

JOHN

Er er havent you really

MIRALDA

No nobody

JOHN

Id be very glad to help you in any little
way

MIRALDA

I wonder if you could advise me

JOHN

IId do my best

MIRALDA

You see I have nobody to advise me

JOHN

No of course not

MIRALDA

I live with my aunt and she doesnt
understand Ive no father or mother

JOHN

O er er really

MIRALDA

No And an uncle died and he left me a
hundred thousand pounds

JOHN

Really

MIRALDA

Yes He didnt like me I think he did it
out of contrariness as much as anything
He was always like that to me

JOHN

Was he Was he really

MIRALDA

Yes It was invested at twentyfive per
cent He never liked me Thought I was
tooI dont know what

JOHN

No

MIRALDA

That was five years ago and Ive never got
a penny of it

JOHN

Really But but thats not right

MIRALDA sadly

No

JOHN

Wheres it invested

MIRALDA

In Al Shaldomir

JOHN

Wheres that

MIRALDA

I dont quite know I never was good at
geography I never quite knew where Persia
ends

JOHN

And what kind of an investment was it

MIRALDA

Theres a pass in some mountains that they
can get camels over and a huge toll is levied
on everything that goes by that is the custom
of the tribe that lives there and I believe
the toll is regularly collected

JOHN

And who gets it

MIRALDA

The chief of the tribe He is called Ben
Hussein But my uncle lent him all this
money and the toll on the camels was what
they call the security They always carry
gold and turquoise you know

JOHN

Do they

MIRALDA

Yes they get it from the rivers

JOHN

I see

MIRALDA

It does seem a shame his not paying
doesnt it

JOHN

A shame I should think it is An awful
shame Why its a crying shame He ought
to go to prison

MIRALDA

Yes he ought But you see its so hard
to find him It isnt as if it was this side of
Persia Its being on the other side that is
such a pity If only it was in a country like

ACT II

SCENE

JOHNs tent in Al Shaldomir There
are two heaps of idols left and right lying
upon the ground inside the tent DAOUD
carries another idol in his arms JOHN
looks at its face

Six months have elapsed since the scene
in the secondclass railway carriage

JOHN BEAL

This god is holy

He points to the left heap DAOUD
carries it there and lays it on the heap

DAOUD

Yes great master

JOHN BEAL

You are in no wise to call me great master
Have not I said so I am not your master
I am helping you people I know better than
you what you ought to do because I am
English But thats all Im not your master
See

DAOUD

Yes great master

JOHN BEAL

O go and get some more idols Hurry

DAOUD

Great master I go
Exit

JOHN BEAL

I cant make these people out

DAOUD returning

I have three gods

JOHN BEAL looking at their faces pointing to
the two smaller idols first
These two are holy This one is unholy

DAOUD

Yes great master

JOHN BEAL

Put them on the heap

DAOUD does so two left one right

Get some more

DAOUD salaams Exit

Looking at right heap What awhat a
filthy people

Enter DAOUD with two idols

JOHN BEAL after scrutiny

This god is holy this is unholy

Enter ARCHIE BEAL wearing a Bowler
hat

Why ARCHIE this is splendid of you
Youve come Why thats splendid All
that way

ARCHIE BEAL

Yes Ive come Whatever are you doing

JOHN BEAL

ARCHIE its grand of you to come I never
ought to have asked it of you only

ARCHIE BEAL

O thats all right But what in the world
are you doing

JOHN BEAL

ARCHIE its splendid of you

ARCHIE BEAL

O cut it Thats all right But whats all
this

JOHN BEAL

O this Well well theyre the very oddest
people here Its a long story But I wanted
to tell you first how enormously grateful I
am to you for coming

ARCHIE BEAL

O thats all right But I want to know
what youre doing with all these genuine
antiques

JOHN BEAL

Well ARCHIE the fact of it is theyre a real
odd lot of people here Ive learnt their
language more or less but I dont think I quite
understand them yet A lot of them are
Mahommedans they worship Mahommed
you know Hes dead But a lot of them
worship these things and

ARCHIE BEAL

Well what have you got em all in here
for

JOHN BEAL

Yes thats just it I hate interfering with
them but well I simply had to You see
theres two sorts of idols here they offer
fruit and rats to some of them they lay them
on their hands or their laps

ARCHIE BEAL

Why do they offer them rats

JOHN BEAL

O I dont know They dont know either
Its the right thing to do out here its been
the right thing for hundreds of years nobody
exactly knows why Its like the bows we
have on evening shoes or anything else
But its all right

ARCHIE BEAL

Well what are you putting them in heaps
for

JOHN BEAL

Because theres the other kind the ones
with wide mouths and rust round them

ARCHIE BEAL

Rust Yes so there is What do they
do

JOHN BEAL

They offer blood to them ARCHIE They
pour it down their throats Sometimes they
kill people sometimes they only bleed them
It depends how much blood the idol wants

ARCHIE BEAL

How much blood it wants Good Lord
How do they know

JOHN BEAL

The priests tell them Sometimes they
fill them up to their neckstheyre all hollow
you know In spring its awful

ARCHIE BEAL

Why are they worse in spring

JOHN BEAL

I dont know The priests ask for more
blood then Much more They say it always
was so

ARCHIE BEAL

And youre stopping it

JOHN BEAL

Yes Im stopping these One must Im
letting them worship those Of course its
idolatry and all that kind of thing but I
dont like interfering short of actual murder

ARCHIE BEAL

And theyre obeying you

JOHN BEAL

M yyes I think so

ARCHIE BEAL

You must have got a great hold over them

JOHN BEAL

Well I dont know about that Its the
pass that counts

ARCHIE BEAL

The pass

JOHN BEAL

Yes that place you came over Its the
only way anyone can get here

ARCHIE BEAL

Yes I suppose it is But how does the pass
affect these idols

JOHN BEAL

It affects everything here If that pass
were closed no living man would ever enter
or leave or even hear of this country Its
absolutely cut off except for that one pass
Why ARCHIE it isnt even on the map

ARCHIE BEAL

Yes I know

JOHN BEAL

Well whoever owns that pass is everybody
No one else counts

ARCHIE BEAL

And who does own it

JOHN BEAL

Well its actually owned by a fellow called
Hussein but Miss Clements uncle a man
called Hinnard a kind of lonely explorer
seems to have come this way and I think he
understood what this pass is worth
Anyhow he lent Hussein a big sum of money and
got an acknowledgment from Hussein Old
Hinnard must have been a wonderfully
shrewd man For that acknowledgment is
no more legal than an IOU and Hussein
is simply a brigand

ARCHIE BEAL

Not very good security

JOHN BEAL

Well youre wrong there Hussein himself
respects that piece of parchment he signed
Theres the name of some god or other written
on it Hussein is frightened of Now you
see how things are That pass is as holy as
all the gods that there are in Al Shaldomir
Hussein possesses it But he owes an
enormous sum to Miss Miralda Clement and I am
here as her agent and youve come to help
me like a great sportsman

ARCHIE BEAL

O never mind that Well it all seems
pretty simple

JOHN BEAL

Well I dont know ARCHIE Hussein
admits the debt but

ARCHIE BEAL

But what

JOHN BEAL

I dont know what hell do

ARCHIE BEAL

Wants watching does he

JOHN BEAL

Yes And meanwhile I feel sort of
responsible for all these silly people
Somebodys got to look after them Daoud

DAOUD off

Great master

JOHN BEAL

Bring in some more gods

DAOUD

Yes great master

JOHN BEAL

I cant get them to stop calling me absurd
titles Theyre so infernally Oriental

Enter DAOUD

ARCHIE BEAL

Hes got two big ones this time

JOHN BEAL to ARCHIE

You see there is rust about their mouths
To DAOUD They are both unholy

He points to R heap and DAOUD
puts them there To DAOUD

Bring in some more

DAOUD

Great master there are no more gods in
Al Shaldomir

JOHN BEAL

It is well

DAOUD

What orders great master

JOHN BEAL

Listen At night you shall come and take
these gods away These shall be worshipped
again in their own place these you shall cast
into the great river and tell no man where you
cast them

DAOUD

Yes great master

JOHN BEAL

You will do this Daoud

DAOUD

Even so great master

JOHN BEAL

I am sorry to make you do it You are
sad that you have to do it Yet it must be
done

DAOUD

Yes I am sad great master

JOHN BEAL

But why are you sad Daoud

DAOUD

Great master in times you do not know
these gods were holy In times you have not
guessed In old centuries master perhaps
before the pass Men have prayed to them
sorrowed before them given offerings to
them The light of old hearths has shone on
them flames from old battles The shadow
of the mountains has fallen on them so
many times master so many times Dawn
and sunset have shone on them master like
firelight flickering dawn and sunset dawn
and sunset flicker flicker flicker for century
after century They have sat there watching
the dawns like old men by the fire They are
so old master so old And some day dawn
and sunset will die away and shine on the
world no more and they would have still
sat on in the cold And now they go
They are our history master they are our old
times Though they be bad times they are
our times master and now they go I am
sad master when the old gods go

JOHN BEAL

But they are bad gods Daoud

DAOUD

I am sad when the bad gods go

JOHN BEAL

They must go Daoud See there is no
one watching Take them now

DAOUD

Even so great master

He takes up the largest of the gods with
rust

Come Ahooomlah thou shalt not drink
Nideesh

JOHN BEAL

Was Nideesh to have been sacrificed

DAOUD

He was to have been drunk by Ahooomlah

JOHN BEAL

Nideesh Who is he

DAOUD

He is my son

Exit with Ahooomlah
JOHN BEAL almost gasps

ARCHIE BEAL who has been looking round
the tent

What has he been saying

JOHN BEAL

Theyretheyre a strange people I
cant make them out

ARCHIE BEAL

Is that the heap that oughtnt to be
worshipped

JOHN BEAL

Yes

ARCHIE BEAL

Well do you know Im going to chuck this
hat there It doesnt seem to me somehow to
be any more right here than those idols would
be at home Odd isnt it Here goes

He throws hat on right heap of idols JOHN
BEAL does not smile

Why whats the matter

JOHN BEAL

I dont like to see a decent Christian hat
among these filthy idols Theyve all got
rust on their mouths I dont like to see
it Archie its sort of like what they call
an omen I dont like it

ARCHIE BEAL

Do they keep malaria here

JOHN BEAL

I dont think so Why

ARCHIE BEAL

Then whats the matter Johnny Your nerves
are bad

JOHN BEAL

You dont know these people and Ive brought
you out here I feel kind of responsible
If Husseins lot turn nasty you dont
know what hed do with all those idols and
all

ARCHIE BEAL

Hell give em a drink you mean

JOHN BEAL

Dont ARCHIE Theres no saying And I
feel responsible for you

ARCHIE BEAL

Well they can have my hat It looks
silly somehow I dont know why What
are we going to do

JOHN BEAL

Well now that youve come we can go
ahead

ARCHIE BEAL

Righto What at

JOHN BEAL

Weve got to see Husseins accounts and
get everything clear in black and white and
see just what he owes to Miss Miralda
Clement

ARCHIE BEAL

But they dont keep accounts here

JOHN BEAL

How do you know

ARCHIE BEAL

Why of course they dont One can see
that

JOHN BEAL

But they must

ARCHIE BEAL

Well you havent changed a bit for your
six months here

JOHN BEAL

Havent changed

ARCHIE BEAL

No Just quietly thinking of business
Youll be a great business man Johnny

JOHN BEAL

But we must do business thats what I
came here for

ARCHIE BEAL

Youll never make these people do it

JOHN BEAL

Well what do you suggest

ARCHIE BEAL

Lets have a look at old Hussein

JOHN BEAL

Yes thats what I have been waiting for
Daoud

DAOUD off

Master Enters

JOHN BEAL

Go to the palace of the Lord of the pass
and beat on the outer door Say that I
desire to see him Pray him to come to my
tent

DAOUD bows and Exit

To ARCHIE Ive sent him to the palace
to ask Hussein to come

ARCHIE BEAL

Lives in a palace does he

JOHN BEAL

Yes its a palace its a wonderful place
Its bigger than the Mansion House much

ARCHIE BEAL

And youre going to teach him to keep
accounts

JOHN BEAL

Well I must I hate doing it It seems
almost like being rude to the Lord Mayor
But theres two things I cant standcheating
in business is one and murders another
Ive got to interfere You see if one happens
to know the right from wrong as we do weve
simply got to tell people who dont But
it isnt pleasant I almost wish Id never
come

ARCHIE BEAL

Why its the greatest sport in the world
Its splendid

JOHN BEAL

I dont see it that way To me those idols
are just horrid murder And this man owes
money to this girl with no one to look after
her and hes got to pay But I hate being
rude to a man in a place like the Mansion
House even if he is black Why good Lord
who am I It seems such cheek

ARCHIE BEAL

I say Johnny tell me about the lady Is
she pretty

JOHN BEAL

What Miss Miralda Yes

ARCHIE BEAL

But what I mean iswhats she like

JOHN BEAL

Oh I dont know Its very hard to say
Shes shes tall and shes fair and shes got
blue eyes

ARCHIE BEAL

Yes but I mean what kind of a person is
she How does she strike you

JOHN BEAL

Well shes pretty hard up until she gets
this money and she hasnt got any job thats
any good and no real prospects bar this
and nobody particular by birth and doesnt
know anybody who is and lives in the least
fashionable suburb and can only just afford
a secondclass fare and

ARCHIE BEAL

Yes yes go on

JOHN BEAL

And yet somehow she sort of seems like
alike a queen

ARCHIE BEAL

Lord above us And what kind of a queen

JOHN BEAL

O I dont know Well look here ARCHIE
its only my impression I dont know her
well yet Its only my impression I only
tell you in absolute confidence You wont
pass it on to anybody of course

ARCHIE BEAL

O no Go on

JOHN BEAL

Well I dont know only she seemed more
like well a kind of autocrat you know
whod stop at nothing Well no I dont
mean that only

ARCHIE BEAL

So youre not going to marry her

JOHN BEAL

Marry her Good Lord no Why youd
never dare ask her Shes not that sort I
tell you shes a sort of queen And Good
Lord shed be a queen if it wasnt for
Hussein or something very like one We cant
go marrying queens Anyhow not one like
her

ARCHIE BEAL

Why not one like her

JOHN BEAL

I tell youshes awell a kind of goddess
You couldnt ask her if she loved you It
would be such such

ARCHIE BEAL

Such what

JOHN BEAL

Such infernal cheek

ARCHIE BEAL

I see Well I see you arent in love with
her But it seems to me youll be seeing a
good deal of her some day if we pull this off
And then my boyo youll be going and
getting in love with her

JOHN BEAL

I tell you I darent Id as soon propose to
the Queen of Sheba

ARCHIE BEAL

Well Johnny Im going to protect you
from her all I can

JOHN BEAL

Protect me from her Why

ARCHIE BEAL

Why because theres lots of other girls
and it seems to me you might be happier with
some of them

JOHN BEAL

But you havent even seen her

ARCHIE BEAL

Nor I have Still if Im here to protect
you I somehow think I will And if Im not


JOHN BEAL

Well and what then

ARCHIE BEAL

What nonsense Im talking Fate does
everything I cant protect you

JOHN BEAL

Yes its nonsense all right ARCHIE but

HUSSEIN off

I am here

JOHN BEAL

Be seen

HUSSEIN enters He is not unlike
Bluebeard

JOHN BEAL pointing to ARCHIE
My brother

ARCHIE shakes hands with HUSSEIN
HUSSEIN looks at his hand when it is
over in a puzzled way JOHN BEAL and
Hussein then bow to each other

HUSSEIN

You desired my presence

JOHN BEAL

I am honoured

HUSSEIN

And I

JOHN BEAL

The white traveller whom we call Hinnard
lent you one thousand greater gold pieces
which in our money is one hundred thousand
pounds as you acknowledge Hussein
nods his head And every year you were to
pay him for this two hundred and fifty of your
greater gold piecesas you acknowledge also

HUSSEIN

Even so

JOHN BEAL

And this you have not yet had chance to
pay but owe it still

HUSSEIN

I do

JOHN BEAL

And now Hinnard is dead

HUSSEIN

Peace be with him

JOHN BEAL

His heiress is Miss Miralda Clement who
instructs me to be her agent What have you
to say

HUSSEIN

Peace be with Hinnard

JOHN BEAL

You acknowledge your debt to this lady
Miss Miralda Clement

HUSSEIN

I know her not

JOHN BEAL

You will not pay your debt

HUSSEIN

I will pay

JOHN BEAL

If you bring the gold to my tent my
brother will take it to Miss Clement

HUSSEIN

I do not pay to Miss Clement

JOHN BEAL

To whom do you pay

HUSSEIN

I pay to Hinnard

JOHN BEAL

Hinnard is dead

HUSSEIN

I pay to Hinnard

JOHN BEAL

How will you pay to Hinnard

HUSSEIN

If he be buried in the sea

JOHN BEAL

He is not buried at sea

HUSSEIN

If he be buried by any river I go to the god
of rivers

JOHN BEAL

He is buried on land near no river

HUSSEIN

Therefore I will go to a bronze god of
earth very holy having the soil in his care
and the things of earth I will take unto him
the greater pieces of gold due up to the year
when the white traveller died and will melt
them in fire at his feet by night on the
mountains saying O Lruruonn this is his
name take this by the way of earth to the
grave of Hinnard And so I shall be free
of my debt before all gods

JOHN BEAL

But not before me I am English And
we are greater than gods

ARCHIE BEAL

Whats that Johnny

JOHN BEAL

He wont pay but I told him were English
and that theyre greater than all his bronze
gods

ARCHIE BEAL

Thats right Johnny

HUSSEIN looks fiercely at ARCHIE
He sees ARCHIEs hat lying before a big
idol He points at the hat and looks in
the face of the idol

HUSSEIN to the idol
Drink Drink

He bows Exit

ARCHIE BEAL

Whats that hes saying

JOHN BEAL meditatively
O nothingnothing

ARCHIE BEAL

He wont pay oh

JOHN BEAL

No not to Miss Miralda

ARCHIE BEAL

Who to

JOHN BEAL

To one of his gods

ARCHIE BEAL

That wont do

JOHN BEAL

No

ARCHIE BEAL

Whatll we do

JOHN BEAL

I dont quite know It isnt as if we were in
England

ARCHIE BEAL

No it isnt

JOHN BEAL

If we were in England

ARCHIE BEAL

I know if we were in England you could
call a policeman I tell you what it is
Johnny

JOHN BEAL

Yes

ARCHIE BEAL

I tell you what you want to see more of
Miss Clement

JOHN BEAL

Why

ARCHIE BEAL

Why because at the present moment our
friend Hussein is a craftier fellow than you
and looks like getting the best of it

JOHN BEAL

How will seeing more of Miss Miralda help
us

ARCHIE BEAL

Why because you want to be a bit craftier
than Hussein and I fancy she might make
you

JOHN BEAL

She How

ARCHIE BEAL

Were mostly made what we are by some
woman or other We think its our own
cleverness but were wrong As things are
youre no match for Hussein but if you
altered

JOHN BEAL

Why ARCHIE where did you get all those
ideas from

ARCHIE BEAL

O I dont know

JOHN BEAL

You never used to talk like that

ARCHIE BEAL

O well

JOHN BEAL

You havent been getting in love ARCHIE
have you

ARCHIE BEAL

What are we to do about Hussein

JOHN BEAL

Its funny your mentioning Miss Miralda
I got a letter from her the same day I got
yours

ARCHIE BEAL

What does she say

JOHN BEAL

I couldnt make it out

ARCHIE BEAL

What were her words

JOHN BEAL

She said she was going into it closer She
underlined closer What could she mean by
that How could she get closer

ARCHIE BEAL

Well the same way as I did

JOHN BEAL

How do you mean I dont understand

ARCHIE BEAL

By coming here

JOHN BEAL

By coming here But she cant come here

ARCHIE BEAL

Why not

JOHN BEAL

Because its impossible Absolutely
impossible Whygood Lordshe couldnt
come here Why shed want a chaperon and
a house andandeverything Good Lord
she couldnt come here It would bewell
it would be impossibleit couldnt be done

ARCHIE BEAL

O all right Then I dont know what she
meant

JOHN BEAL

ARCHIE You dont really think shed come
here You dont really think it do you

ARCHIE BEAL

Well its the sort of thing that that sort of
girl might do but of course I cant say

JOHN BEAL

Good Lord ARCHIE That would be awful

ARCHIE BEAL

But why

JOHN BEAL

Why But what would I do Where
would she go Where would her chaperon
go The chaperon would be some elderly
lady Why it would kill her

ARCHIE BEAL

Well if it did youve never met her so you
neednt go into mourning for an elderly lady
that you dont know not yet anyway

JOHN BEAL

No of course not Youre laughing at me
ARCHIE But for the moment I took you
seriously Of course she wont come One
can go into a thing closely without doing it
absolutely literally But good Lord wouldnt
it be an awful situation if she did

ARCHIE BEAL

O I dont know

JOHN BEAL

All alone with me here No impossible
And the country isnt civilised

ARCHIE BEAL

Women arent civilised

JOHN BEAL

Women arent Good Lord ARCHIE
what an awful remark What do you mean

ARCHIE BEAL

Were tame theyre wild We like all the
dull things and the quiet things they like
all the romantic things and the dangerous
things

JOHN BEAL

Why ARCHIE its just the other way about

ARCHIE BEAL

O yes we do all the romantic things and
all the dangerous things But why

JOHN BEAL

Why Because we like them I suppose
I cant think of any other reason

ARCHIE BEAL

I hate danger Dont you

JOHN BEAL

Erwell yes I suppose I do really

ARCHIE BEAL

Of course you do We all do Its the
women that put us up to it Shes putting
you up to this And the more she puts you
up to the more likely is Hussein to get it in his
fat neck

JOHN BEAL

Butbut you dont mean youd hurt
Hussein Notnot badly I mean

ARCHIE BEAL

Were under her orders Johnny See what
she says

JOHN BEAL

You you dont really think shell come
here

ARCHIE BEAL

Of course I do and the best thing too
Its her show she ought to come

JOHN BEAL

But but you dont understand Shes
just a young girl A girl like Miss Miralda
couldnt come out here over the pass and
down these mountains shed never stand it
and as for the chaperon Youve
never met Miss Miralda

ARCHIE BEAL

No Johnny But the girl that was able to
get you to go from Bromley to this place can
look after herself

JOHN BEAL

I dont see what thats got to do with it
She was in trouble and I had to help her

ARCHIE BEAL

Yes and shell be in trouble all the way
here from Blackheath and everyone will have
to help her

JOHN BEAL

What beats me is how you can have the
very faintest inkling of what shes like
without ever having seen her and without my
having spoken of her to you for more than a
minute

ARCHIE BEAL

Well Johnny youre not a romantic bird
youre not a traveller by nature barring your
one trip to Eastbourne and it was I that took
you there And contrariwise as they say in
a book youve never read youre a
levelheaded business man and a hardworking
respectable stayathome You meet a girl
in a train and the next time I see you youre
in a place that isnt marked on the map and
telling it what gods it ought to worship and
what gods it ought to have agnosticism about
Well I say some girl

JOHN BEAL

Well I must say you make the most
extraordinary deductions but it was awfully good
of you to come and I ought to be grateful
and I am too Im awfully grateful and I
ought to let you talk all the rot you like Go
ahead You shall say what you like and do
what you like It isnt many brothers that
would do what youve done

ARCHIE BEAL

O thats nothing I like this country
Im glad I came And if I can help you with
Hussein why all the better

JOHN BEAL

Its an awful country Archie but weve
got to see this through

ARCHIE BEAL

Does she know all about Hussein

JOHN BEAL

Yes everything Ive written fully

OMAR Off

ARCHIE BEAL

situations impossible People would talk

it is But it isnt Its impossible It cant

JOHN BEAL

Hussein wont pay

MIRALDA

Lets see Hussein

JOHN BEAL

Im afraid hes rather hes rather a
savagelooking brigand

MIRALDA

Never mind

ARCHIE is quietly listening and smiling
sometimes

Enter DAOUD He goes up to the
unholy heap and takes away two large idols
one under each arm Exit

Whats that Mr Beal

JOHN BEAL

O that Im afraid its rather horrible
I told you it was an awful country They
pray to these idols here and some are all
right though of course its terribly
blasphemous but that heap well Im afraid well
that heap is very bad indeed

MIRALDA

What do they do

JOHN BEAL

They kill people

MIRALDA

Do they How

JOHN BEAL

Im afraid they pour their blood down those
horrible throats

MIRALDA

Do they How do you know

JOHN BEAL

Ive seen them do it and those mouths
are all rusty But its all right now It
wont happen any more

MIRALDA

Wont it Why not

JOHN BEAL

Well I

ARCHIE BEAL

Hes stopped them Miss Clement Theyre
all going to be thrown into the river

MIRALDA

Have you

JOHN BEAL

Well yes I had to So its all right now
They wont do it any more

MIRALDA

Hm

JOHN BEAL

What what is it I promise you thats all
right They wont do that any more

MIRALDA

Hm Ive never known anyone that tried
to govern a country or anything of that sort
but

JOHN BEAL

Of course Im just doing what I can to put
them right Id be very glad of your
advice Of course Im only here in
your name

MIRALDA

What I mean is that Id always thought
that the one thing you shouldnt do if you
dont mind my saying so

JOHN BEAL

No certainly

MIRALDA

Was to interfere in peoples
religious beliefs

JOHN BEAL

But but I dont think you quite
understand The priests knife these people in the
throat boys and girls and then acolytes
lift them up and the blood runs down Ive
seen them

MIRALDA

I think its best to leave religion to the
priests They understand that kind of thing

JOHN BEAL opens his mouth in horror
and looks at ARCHIE ARCHIE returns
the glance there is very nearly a twinkle in
ARCHIEs eyes

MIRALDA

Lets see Hussein

JOHN BEAL

What do you think Archie

ARCHIE BEAL

Poor fellow Wed better send for him

MIRALDA

Why do you say poor fellow

ARCHIE BEAL

Oh because hes so much in debt Its
awful to be in debt Id sooner almost
anything happened to me than to owe a lot of
money

MIRALDA

Your remark didnt sound very
complimentary

ARCHIE BEAL

O I only meant that Id hate to be in debt
And I should hate owing money to you
Because

MIRALDA

Why

ARCHIE BEAL

Because I should so awfully want to pay it

MIRALDA

I see

ARCHIE BEAL

Thats all I meant

MIRALDA

Does Hussein awfully want to pay it

ARCHIE BEAL

Well no But he hasnt seen you yet He
will then of course

Enter DAOUD He goes to the unholy
heap

JOHN BEAL

Daoud for the present these gods must
stay Ahooomlahs gone but the rest must
stay for the present

DAOUD

Even so great master

JOHN BEAL

Daoud go once more to the palace of the
Lord of the Pass and beat the outer door
Say that the great lady herself would see him
The great lady Miss Clement the white
travellers heiress

DAOUD

Yes master

JOHN BEAL

Hasten

Exit DAOUD

I have sent him for Hussein

MIRALDA

I dont know their language

JOHN BEAL

You will see him and Ill tell you what he
says

MIRALDA to ARCHIE

Have you been here long

ARCHIE BEAL

No I think he wrote to me by the same
mail as he wrote to you if they have mails
here I came at once

MIRALDA

So did I but you werent on the Empress
of Switzerland

ARCHIE BEAL

No I came round more by land

JOHN BEAL

You know I hardly like bringing Hussein
in here to see you Hes such ahes rather
a

MIRALDA

Whats the matter with him

JOHN BEAL

Well hes rather of the brigand type and
one doesnt know what hell do

MIRALDA

Well we must see him first and hear what
he has to say before we take any steps

JOHN BEAL

But what do you propose to do

MIRALDA

Why if he pays me everything he owes or
gives up the security

JOHN BEAL

The security is the pass

MIRALDA

Yes If he gives up that or pays

JOHN BEAL

You know hes practically king of the
whole country It seems rather cheek almost
my sending for him like this

MIRALDA

He must come

JOHN BEAL

But what are you going to do

MIRALDA

If he gives up the pass

JOHN BEAL

Why if he gives up the pass youd be
youd be a kind of queen of it all

MIRALDA

Well if he does that all right

JOHN BEAL

But what if he doesnt

MIRALDA

Why if he doesnt pay

HUSSEIN off

I am here

JOHN BEAL

Be seen

Enter HUSSEIN

HUSSEIN

Greeting once more

JOHN BEAL

Again greeting The great lady
Miss Clement is here

HUSSEIN and MIRALDA look at each
other

You will pay to Miss Clement and not to
your god of bronze On the word of an
Englishman your god of bronze shall not have
one gold piece that belongs to the great lady

HUSSEIN looking contemptuous

On the word of the Lord of the Pass I only
pay to Hinnard

He stands smiling while MIRALDA
regards him Exit

ARCHIE BEAL

Well

JOHN BEAL

He wont pay

ARCHIE BEAL

What are we to do now

JOHN BEAL to MIRALDA

Im afraid hes rather an ugly customer to
introduce you to like that Im sorry he came
now

MIRALDA

O I like him I think he looks splendid

ARCHIE BEAL

Well what are we to do

JOHN BEAL

Yes

ARCHIE BEAL

What do you say Miss Clement

JOHN BEAL

Yes what do you feel we ought to do

MIRALDA

Well perhaps I ought to leave all that to
you

ARCHIE BEAL

O no

JOHN BEAL

No its your money What do you think
we really ought to do

MIRALDA

Well of course I think you ought to kill
Hussein

JOHN BEAL and ARCHIE BEAL look
at each other a little startled

JOHN BEAL

But wouldnt thatwouldnt that
bemurder

MIRALDA

O yes according to the English law

JOHN BEAL

I see you meanyou mean were notbut

MIRALDA

I mean it wouldnt be murderby your
law unless you made it so

JOHN BEAL

By my law

MIRALDA

Yes if you can interfere with their religion
like this and none of them say a word
whyyou can make any laws you like

JOHN BEAL

But Hussein is king here he is Lord of the
Pass and thats everything here Im nobody

MIRALDA

O if you like to be nobody of course thats
different

ARCHIE BEAL

I think she means that if Hussein werent
there thered be only you Of course I dont
know Ive only just come

JOHN BEAL

But we cant kill Hussein

MIRALDA begins to cry

O Lord Good heavens Please Miss
Clement Im awfully sorry if Ive said

country I know Im really sorry you came

sorry

MIRALDA

MIRALDA to JOHN BEAL

I rely on you Mr Beal

JOHN BEAL

II but what can I You see

MIRALDA

I did think of bringing a rather nice aunt

No on the whole I didnt

JOHN BEAL

I say Archie what are we to do

ARCHIE BEAL

Heres Daoud

Enter DAOUD

ARCHIE BEAL

fans and wearing scimitars All stare at
them They begin to fan slightly

DAOUD

The watchers of the doorstep

JOHN BEAL

Idiot Daoud Fools Dolts Men may
not guard a ladys door

BAZZALOL and THOOTHOOBABA smile
ingratiatingly

We are not men

BAZZALOL bowing

Curtain

Six and a half years elapse


THE SONG OF THE IRIS MARSHES

When morn is bright on the mountains olden
 Till dawn is lost in the blaze of day
 When morn is bright and the marshes golden
Where shall the lost lights fade away
 And where my love shall we dream today

Dawn is fled to the marshy hollows
 Where ghosts of stars in the dimness stray
And the water is streaked with the flash of
swallows
 And all through summer the iris sway
 But where my love shall we dream today

When night is black in the iris marshes




ACT III

SCENE 1

Six and a half years later
Al Shaldomir
A room in the palace

MIRALDA reclines on a heap of cushions
JOHN beside her

Bazzalol and Thoothoobaba fan them

OMAR declaiming to a zither

Al Shaldomir Al Shaldomir
 The nightingales that guard thy ways
Cease not to give thee after God
 And after Paradise all praise
 Thou art the theme of all their lays
Al Shaldomir Al Shaldomir

MIRALDA

Go now Omar

OMAR

O lady I depart

MIRALDA languidly

John John I wish youd marry me

JOHN

Miralda youre thinking of those old
customs again that we left behind us seven years
ago Whats the good of it

MIRALDA

I had a fancy that I wished you would

JOHN

Whats the good of it You know you are
my beloved There are none of those
clergymen within hundreds of miles Whats the
good of it

MIRALDA

We could find one John

JOHN

O yes I suppose we could but

MIRALDA

Why wont you

JOHN

I told you why

MIRALDA

O yes that instinct that you must not
marry Thats not your reason John

JOHN

Yes it is

MIRALDA

Its a silly reason Its a crazy reason
Its no reason at all Theres some other
reason

JOHN

No there isnt But I feel that in my
bones I dont know why You know that
I love none else but you Besides were
never going back and it doesnt matter
This isnt Blackheath

MIRALDA

So I must live as your slave

JOHN

No no Miralda My dear you are not my
slave Did not the singer compare our love
to the desire of the nightingale for the
evening star All know that you are my queen

MIRALDA

They do not know at home

JOHN

Home Home How could they know
What have we in common with home Rows
and rows of little houses and if they hear a
nightingale there they write to the papers
Andand if they saw this theyd think they
were drunk Miralda dont be absurd
What has set you thinking of home

MIRALDA

I want to be crowned queen

JOHN

But I am not a king I am only Shereef

MIRALDA

You are allpowerful here John you can do
what you please if you wish to You dont
love me at all

JOHN

Miralda you know I love you Didnt
I kill Hussein for you

MIRALDA

Yes but you dont love me now

JOHN

And Husseins people killed ARCHIE That
was for you too I brought my brother out
here to help you He was engaged to be
married too

MIRALDA

But you dont love me now

JOHN

Yes I do I love you as the dawn loves
the iris marshes You know the song they
sing footnote poem just before Act III

MIRALDA

Then why wont you marry me

JOHN

I told you I told you I had a dream about
the future I forgot the dream but I know
I was not to marry I will not wrong the
future

MIRALDA

Dont be crazy

JOHN

I will have what fancies I please crazy or
sane Am I not Shereef of Shaldomir Who
dare stop me if I would be mad as Herod

MIRALDA

I will be crowned queen

JOHN

It is not my wish

MIRALDA

I will I will I will

JOHN

Drive me not to anger If I have you cast
into a well and take twenty of the fairest
daughters of Al Shaldomir in your place who
can gainsay me

MIRALDA

I will be crowned queen

JOHN

O do not be tiresome

MIRALDA

Was it not my money that brought you
here Was it not I who said Kill Hussein
What power could you have had had
Hussein lived What would you have been doing
now but for me

JOHN

I dont know Miralda

MIRALDA

Catching some silly train to the City
Working for some dull firm Living in some
small suburban house It is I I that brought
you from all that and you wont make me a
queen

JOHN

Is it not enough that you are my beloved
You know there is none other but you Is
it not enough Miralda

MIRALDA

It is not enough I will be queen

JOHN

Tchah Miralda I know you are a
wonderful woman the most wonderful in the
East how you ever came to be in the West
I dont know and a train of all places but
Miralda you must not have petty whims
they dont become you

MIRALDA

Is it a petty whim to wish to be a queen

JOHN

Yes when it is only the name you want
You are a queen You have all you wish for
Are you not my beloved And have I not
power here over all men Could I not close
the pass

MIRALDA

I want to be queen

JOHN

Ohh I will leave you I have more to do
than to sit and hear your whims When I
come back you will have some other whim
Miralda you have too many whims

He rises

MIRALDA

Will you be back soon

MIRALDA

When will you come back John

She is reclining looking fair fanning
slightly

JOHN

In half an hour

MIRALDA

In half an hour

JOHN

Yes

Exit

MIRALDA

Half an hour

Her fan is laid down She clutches
it with sudden resolve She goes to the
wall fanning herself slowly She leans
against it She fans herself now with
obvious deliberation Three times the
great fan goes pat against the window and
then again separately three times and
then she puts it against the window once
with a smile of ecstasy She has signalled
She returns to the cushions and reclines
with beautiful care fanning herself softly

Enter the Vizier HAFIZ EL ALCOLAHN

MIRANDA

HAFIZ

HAFIZ

Indeed before all my wives before all

Alcolahn

He drops a bag of gold
THOOTHOOBABA goes down and grabs at the gold

THOOTHOOBABA

Master I speak not Ohhh

Exit HAFIZ

MIRALDA arranges herself on the
cushions She looks idly at each Nubian The
Nubians put each a finger over his lips and
go on fanning with one hand

MIRALDA

A queen I shall look sweet as a queen

Enter JOHN She rises to greet him
caressingly

Enter DAOUD

Oh you have brought Daoud with you

JOHN

Why not

MIRALDA

You know that I dont like Daoud

JOHN

I wish to speak with him

MIRALDA looks straight at JOHN and
moves away in silence Exit L

JOHN

Daoud

DAOUD

Great master

JOHN

Daoud one day in spring in the cemetery
of those called Blessed beyond the citys
gates you swore to me by the graves of both
your parents

DAOUD

Great master even so I swore

JOHN

 to be true to me always

DAOUD

There is no Shereef but my master

JOHN

Daoud you have kept your word

DAOUD

I have sought to master

JOHN

You have helped me often Daoud warned
me and helped me often Through you I
knew those currents that run through the
deeps of the market in silence and all men
feel them but a ruler never You told me of
them and when I knewthen I could look
after myself Daoud They could do nothing
against me then Well now I hold this
people I hold them at last Daoud and now
well I can rest a little

DAOUD

Not in the East master

JOHN

Not in the East Daoud

DAOUD

No master

JOHN

Why What do you mean

DAOUD

In Western countries master whose tales
I have read in a wonderful book named the
Good Childs History of England in the
West a man hath power over a land and lo
the power is his and descends to his sons son
after him

JOHN

Well doesnt it in the East

DAOUD

Not if he does not watch master in the
night and the day and in the twilight
between the day and the night and in the dawn
between the night and the day

JOHN

I thought you had pretty long dynasties
in these parts and pretty lazy ones

DAOUD

Master he that was mightiest of those that
were kings in Babylon had a secret door
prepared in an inner chamber which led to a
little room the smallest in the palace whose
back door opened secretly to the river even
to great Euphrates where a small boat waited
all the days of his reign

JOHN

Did he really now Well he was taking no
chances Did he have to use it

DAOUD

No master Such boats are never used
Those that watch like that do not need to
seek them and the others they would never
be able to reach the river in time even though
the boat were there

JOHN

I shouldnt like to have to live like that
Why a river runs by the back of this palace
I suppose palaces usually are on rivers Im
glad I dont have to keep a boat there

DAOUD

No master

JOHN

Well what is it you are worrying about
Who is it you are afraid of

DAOUD

Hafiz el Alcolahn

JOHN

O Hafiz I have no fears of Hafiz Lately
I ordered my spies to watch him no longer
Why does he hate me

DAOUD

Because most excellent master you slew
Hussein

JOHN

Slew Hussein What is that to do with
him May I not slay whom I please

DAOUD

Even so master Even so But he was
Husseins enemy

JOHN

His enemy eh

DAOUD

For years he had dreamed of the joy of
killing Hussein

JOHN

Well he should have done it before I came
We dont hang over things and brood over
them for years where I come from If a
things to be done its done

DAOUD

Even so master Hafiz had laid his plans
for years He would have killed him and got
his substance and then when the hour drew
near you came and Hussein died swiftly
not as Hafiz would have had him die and
lo thou art the lord of the pass and Hafiz is
no more than a beetle that runs about in the
dirt

JOHN

Well so you fear Hafiz

DAOUD

Not for himself master Nay I fear not
Hafiz But master hast thou seen when the
thunder is coming but no rumble is heard
and the sky is scarce yet black how little
winds run in the grass and sigh and die and
the flower beckons a moment with its head
all the world full of whispers master all
saying nothing then the lightning master and
the anger of God and men say it came
without warning Simply I hear those things
coming master

JOHN

Well

DAOUD

Master it is all silent in the market Once
when the price of turquoises was high men
abused the Shereef When the merchant men
could not sell their pomegranates for silver
they abused the Shereef It is mens way
master mens way Now it is all silent in the
market It is like the grasses with the idle
winds that whisper and sigh and die away
like the flowers beckoning to nothing And
so master and so

JOHN

I see you fear some danger

DAOUD

I fear it master

JOHN

What danger Daoud

DAOUD

Master I know not

JOHN

From what quarter Daoud

DAOUD

O master O sole Lord of Al Shaldomir
named the elect from that quarter

JOHN

That quarter Why that is the gracious
ladys innermost chamber

DAOUD

From that quarter great master O Lord
of the Pass

JOHN

Daoud I have cast men into prison for
saying less than this Men have been flogged
on the feet for less than this

DAOUD

Slay me master but hear my words

JOHN

I will not slay you You are mistaken
Daoud You have made a great mistake
The thing is absurd Why the gracious lady
has scarcely seen Hafiz She knows nothing
of the talk of the market Who could tell
her No one comes here It is absurd Only
the other day she said to me But it
is absurd it is absurd Daoud Besides the
people would never rebel against me Do I
not govern them well

DAOUD

Even so master

JOHN

Why should they rebel then

DAOUD

They think of the old times master

JOHN

The old times Why their lives werent
safe The robbers came down from the
mountains and robbed the market whenever they
had a mind

DAOUD

Master men were content in the old times

JOHN

But were the merchants content

DAOUD

Those that loved merchandise were
content master Those that loved it not went
into the mountains

JOHN

But were they content when they were
robbed

DAOUD

They soon recovered their losses master
Their prices were unjust and they loved usury

JOHN

And were the people content with unjust
prices

DAOUD

Some were master as men have to be in
all countries The others went into the
mountains and robbed the merchants

JOHN

I see

DAOUD

But now master a man robs a merchant
and he is cast into prison Now a man is
slain in the market and his son his own son
master may not follow after the aggressor
and slay him and burn his house They are
illcontent master No man robs the
merchants no man slays them and the
merchants hearts are hardened and they oppress
all men

JOHN

I see They dont like good government

DAOUD

They sigh for the old times master

JOHN

I see I see In spite of all I have done for
them they want their old bad government
back again

DAOUD

It is the old way master

JOHN

Yes yes And so they would rebel Well
we must watch You have warned me once
again Daoud and I am grateful But you
are wrong Daoud about the gracious lady
You are mistaken It is impossible You are
mistaken Daoud I know it could not be

DAOUD

I am mistaken master Indeed I am
mistaken Yet watch Watch master

JOHN

Well I will watch

DAOUD

And master if ever I come to you bearing
oars then watch no longer master but follow
me through the banquet chamber and through
the room beyond it Move as the wild deer
move when there is danger without pausing
without wondering without turning round
for in that hour master in that hour

JOHN

Through the room beyond the banquet
chamber Daoud

DAOUD

Aye master following me

JOHN

But there is no door beyond Daoud

DAOUD

Master I have prepared a door

JOHN

A door Daoud

DAOUD

A door none wots of master

JOHN

Whither does it lead

DAOUD

To a room that you know not of a little
room you must stoop master

JOHN

O and then

DAOUD

To the river master

JOHN

The river But theres no boat there

DAOUD

Under the golden willow master

JOHN

A boat

DAOUD

Even so under the branches

JOHN

Is it come to that No Daoud all
this is unnecessary It cant come to that

DAOUD

If ever I come before you bearing two oars
in that hour master it is necessary

JOHN

But you will not come It will never come
to that

DAOUD

No master

JOHN

A wise man can stop things before they
get as far as that

DAOUD

They that were kings in Babylon were wise
men master

JOHN

Babylon But that was thousands of
years ago

DAOUD

Man changes not master

JOHN

Well Daoud I will trust you and if it
ever comes to that

Enter MIRALDA

MIRALDA

I thought Daoud was gone

DAOUD

Even now I go gracious lady

Exit DAOUD Rather strained silence
with JOHN and MIRALDA till he goes
She goes and retakes herself comfortable
on the cushions He is not entirely at ease

MIRALDA

You had a long talk with Daoud

JOHN

Yes he came and talked a good deal

MIRALDA

What about

JOHN

O just talk you know these Eastern
people

MIRALDA

I thought it was something you were
discussing with him

JOHN

O no

MIRALDA

Some important secret

JOHN

No not at all

MIRALDA

You often talk with Daoud

JOHN

Yes he is useful to me When he talks
sense I listen but today

MIRALDA

What did he come for today

JOHN

O nothing

MIRALDA

You have a secret with Daoud that you
will not share with me

JOHN

No I have not

MIRALDA

What was it he said

JOHN

He said there was a king in Babylon who

DAOUD slips into the room

MIRALDA

In Babylon What has that to do with
us

JOHN

Nothing I told you he was not talking
sense

MIRALDA

Well what did he say

JOHN

He said that in Babylon

DAOUD

Hist

JOHN

O well

MIRALDA glares but calms herself
and says nothing

Birds sing thy praises night and day
 The nightingale in every wood
Blackbirds in fields profound with may
Birds sing of thee by every way

Al Shaldomir Al Shaldomir
My heart is ringing with thee still
Though far away O fairy fields
My soul flies low by every hill
And misses not one daffodil

Al Shaldomir Al Shaldomir
O mother of my roving dreams
Blue is the night above thy spires
And blue by myriads of streams
Paradise through thy gateway gleams

MIRALDA

Why do you not wish to speak

JOHN

You desire me to speak

MIRALDA

No They all wonder why you do not
speak that is all

JOHN

I will speak They shall hear me

MIRALDA

O there is no need to

JOHN

There is a need He rises People of
Shaldomir behold I know your plottings
I know the murmurings that you murmur
against me When I sleep in my inner
chamber my ear is in the market while I sit at
meat I hear men whisper far hence and know
their innermost thoughts Hope not to
overcome me by your plans nor by any manner of
craftiness My gods are gods of brass none
have escaped them They cannot be
overthrown Of all men they favour my people
Their hands reach out to the uttermost ends
of the earth Take heed for my gods are
terrible I am the Shereef if any dare
withstand me I will call on my gods and they shall
crush him utterly They shall grind him into
the earth and trample him under as though
he had not been The uttermost parts have
feared the gods of the English They reach
out they destroy there is no escape from
them Be warned for I do not permit any
to stand against me The laws that I have
given you you shall keep there shall be no
other laws Whoso murmurs shall know my
wrath and the wrath of my gods Take heed
I speak not twice I spoke once to Hussein
Hussein heard not and Hussein is dead his
ears are closed for ever Hear O people

HAFIZ

O Shereef we murmur not against you

JOHN

I know thoughts and hear whispers I
need not instruction Hafiz

 HAFIZ

You exalt yourself over us as none did
aforetime

JOHN

Yes And I will exalt myself I have been
Shereef hitherto but now I will be king Al
Shaldomir is less than I desire I have ruled
too long over a little country I will be the
equal of Persia I will be king I proclaim it
The pass is mine the mountains shall be
mine also And he that rules the mountains
has mastery over all the plains beyond If
the men of the plains will not own it let them
make ready for my wrath will fall on them
in the hour when they think me afar on a
night when they think I dream I proclaim
myself king over

HAFIZ pulls out his flute and plays the
weird strange tune JOHN looks at him in
horrified anger

JOHN

The penalty is death Death is the
punishment for what you do Hafiz You have
dared while I spoke Hafiz your contempt is
death Go to Hussein I the king
