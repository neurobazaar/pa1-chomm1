DEDICATION

TO MY FATHER


I dedicate to you a work which is submitted to the public with a
diffidence and hesitation proportioned to the novelty of the effort
it represents For in this poem I have abandoned those forms of
verse with which I had most familiarized my thoughts and have
endeavored to follow a path on which I could discover no footprints
before me either to guide or to warn

There is a moment of profound discouragement which succeeds to
prolonged effort when the labor which has become a habit having
ceased we miss the sustaining sense of its companionship and
stand with a feeling of strangeness and embarrassment before the
abrupt and naked result As regards myself in the present
instance the force of all such sensations is increased by the
circumstances to which I have referred And in this moment of
discouragement and doubt my heart instinctively turns to you from
whom it has so often sought from whom it has never failed to
receive support

I do not inscribe to you this book because it contains anything
that is worthy of the beloved and honored name with which I thus
seek to associate it nor yet because I would avail myself of a
vulgar pretext to display in public an affection that is best
honored by the silence which it renders sacred

Feelings only such as those with which in days when there existed
for me no critic less gentle than yourself I brought to you my
childish manuscripts feelings only such as those which have in
later years associated with your heart all that has moved or
occupied my ownlead me once more to seek assurance from the
grasp of that hand which has hitherto been my guide and comfort
through the life I owe to you

And as in childhood when existence had no toil beyond the days
simple lesson no ambition beyond the neighboring approval of the
night I brought to you the mornings task for the evenings
sanction so now I bring to you this selfappointed taskwork of
maturer years less confident indeed of your approval but not less
confident of your love and anxious only to realize your presence
between myself and the public and to mingle with those severer
voices to whose final sentence I submit my work the beloved and
gracious accents of your own

 LETTER FROM THE COMTESSE DE NEVERS TO LORD ALFRED VARGRAVE


 I hear from Bigorre you are there I am told
 You are going to marry Miss Darcy Of old
 So long since you may have forgotten it now
 When we parted as friends soon mere strangers to grow
 Your last words recorded a pledgewhat you will
 A promisethe time is now come to fulfil
 The letters I ask you my lord to return
 I desire to receive from your hand You discern
 My reasons which therefore I need not explain
 The distance to Luchon is short I remain
 A month in these mountains Miss Darcy perchance
 Will forego one brief page from the summer romance
 Of her courtship and spare you one day from your place
 At her feet in the light of her fair English face
 I desire nothing more and trust you will feel
 I desire nothing much
 Your friend always
 LUCILE


 II


 Now in May Fair of coursein the fair month of May
 When life is abundant and busy and gay
 When the markets of London are noisy about
 Young ladies and strawberriesonly just out
 Fresh strawberries sold under all the houseeaves
 And young ladies on sale for the strawberryleaves
 When cards invitations and threecornered notes
 Fly about like white butterfliesgay little motes
 In the sunbeam of Fashion and even Blue Books
 Take a heavywingd flight and grow busy as rooks
 And the postman that Genius indifferent and stern
 Who shakes out evenhanded to all from his urn
 Those lots which so often decide if our day
 Shall be fretful and anxious or joyous and gay
 Brings each morning more letters of one sort or other
 Than Cadmus himself put together to bother
 The heads of HellenesI say in the season
 Of Fair May in May Fair there can be no reason
 Why when quietly munching your dry toast and butter
 Your nerves should be suddenly thrown in a flutter
 At the sight of a neat little letter addressd
 In a womans handwriting containing half guessd
 An odor of violets faint as the Spring
 And coquettishly seald with a small signetring
 But in Autumn the season of sombre reflection
 When a damp day at breakfast begins with dejection
 Far from London and Paris and ill at ones ease
 Away in the heart of the blue Pyrenees
 Where a call from the doctor a stroll to the bath
 A ride through the hills on a hack like a lath
 A cigar a French novel a tedious flirtation
 Are all a man finds for his days occupation
 The whole case believe me is totally changed
 And a letter may alter the plans we arranged
 Overnight for the slaughter of timea wild beast
 Which though classified yet by no naturalist
 Abounds in these mountains more hard to ensnare
 And more mischievous too than the Lynx or the Bear


 III


 I marvel less therefore that having already
 Torn open this note with a hand most unsteady
 Lord Alfred was startled
 The month is September
 Time morning the scene at Bigorre pray remember
 These facts gentle reader because I intend
 To fling all the unities by at the end
 He walkd to the window The morning was chill
 The brown woods were crispd in the cold on the hill
 The sole thing abroad in the streets was the wind
 And the straws on the gust like the thoughts in his mind
 Rose and eddied around and around as tho teasing
 Each other The prospect in truth was unpleasing
 And Lord Alfred whilst moodily gazing around it
 To himself more than once vexd in soul sighd
  Confound it


 IV


 What the thoughts were which led to this bad interjection
 Sir or madam I leave to your future detection
 For whatever they were they were burst in upon
 As the door was burst through by my lords Cousin John

 COUSIN JOHN

 A fool Alfred a fool a most motley fool

 LORD ALFRED

 Who

 JOHN

 The man who has anything better to do
 And yet so far forgets himself so far degrades
 His position as Man to this worst of all trades
 Which even a wellbroughtup ape were above
 To travel about with a woman in love
 Unless shes in love with himself

 ALFRED

 Indeed why
 Are you here then dear Jack

 JOHN

 Cant you guess it

 ALFRED

 Not I

 JOHN

 Because I HAVE nothing thats better to do
 I had rather be bored my dear Alfred by you
 On the whole I must own than be bored by myself
 That perverse imperturbable goldenhaird elf
 Your Willothewispthat has led you and me
 Such a dance through these hills

 ALFRED

 Who Matilda

 JOHN

 Yes she
 Of course who but she could contrive so to keep
 Ones eyes and ones feet too from falling asleep
 For even one halfhour of the long twentyfour

 ALFRED

 Whats the matter

 JOHN

 Why she isa matter the more
 I consider about it the more it demands
 An attention it does not deserve and expands
 Beyond the dimensions which evn crinoline
 When possessd by a fair face and saucy Eighteen
 Is entitled to take in this very small star
 Already too crowded as I think by far
 You read Malthus and Sadler

 ALFRED

 Of course

 JOHN

 To what use
 When you countenance calmly such monstrous abuse
 Of one mere human creatures legitimate space
 In this world Mars Apollo Virorum the case
 Wholly passes my patience

 ALFRED

 My own is worse tried

 JOHN

 Yours Alfred

 ALFRED

 Read this if you doubt and decide

 JOHN reading the letter

 I hear from Bigorre you are there I am told
 You are going to marry Miss Darcy Of old
 What is this

 ALFRED

 Read it on to the end and youll know

 JOHN continues reading

 When we parted your last words recorded a vow
 What you will
 Hang it this smells all over I swear
 Of adventurers and violets Was it your hair
 You promised a lock of

 ALFRED

 Read on Youll discern

 JOHN continues

 Those letters I ask you my lord to return
 Humph Letters the matter is worse than I guessd
 I have my misgivings

 ALFRED

 Well read out the rest
 And advise

 JOHN

 Eh Where was I
 continues
 Miss Darcy perchance
 Will forego one brief page from the summer romance
 Of her courtship
 Egad a romance for my part
 Id forego every page of and not break my heart

 ALFRED

 Continue

 JOHN reading

 And spare you one day from your place
 At her feet
 Pray forgive me the passing grimace
 I wish you had MY place
 reads
 I trust you will feel
 I desire nothing much Your friend  
 Bless me Lucile
 The Countess de Nevers

 ALFRED

 Yes

 JOHN

 What will you do

 ALFRED

 You ask me just what I would rather ask you

 JOHN

 You cant go

 ALFRED

 I must

 JOHN

 And Matilda

 ALFRED

 Oh that
 You must manage

 JOHN

 Must I I decline it though flat
 In an hour the horses will be at the door
 And Matilda is now in her habit Before
 I have finished my breakfast of course I receive
 A message for dear Cousin John I must leave
 At the jewellers the bracelet which YOU broke last night
 I must call for the music Dear Alfred is right
 The black shawl looks best WILL I change it Of course
 I can just stop in passing to order the horse
 Then Beau has the mumps or St Hubert knows what
 WILL I see the dogdoctor Hang Beau I will NOT

 ALFRED

 Tush tush this is serious

 JOHN

 It is

 ALFRED

 Very well
 You must think

 JOHN

 What excuse will you make tho

 ALFRED

 Oh tell
 Mrs Darcy that lend me your wits Jack The deuce
 Can you not stretch your genius to fit a friends use
 Excuses are clothes which when askd unawares
 Good Breeding to Naked Necessity spares
 You must have a whole wardrobe no doubt

 JOHN

 My dear fellow
 Matilda is jealous you know as Othello

 ALFRED

 You joke

 JOHN

 I am serious Why go to Luchon

 ALFRED

 Dont ask me I have not a choice my dear John
 Besides shall I own a strange sort of desire
 Before I extinguish forever the fire
 Of youth and romance in whose shadowy light
 Hope whisperd her first fairy tales to excite
 The last spark till it rise and fade far in that dawn
 Of my days where the twilights of life were first drawn
 By the rosy reluctant auroras of Love
 In short from the dead Past the gravestone to move
 Of the years long departed forever to take
 One last look one final farewell to awake
 The Heroic of youth from the Hades of joy
 And once more be though but for an hour Jacka boy

 JOHN

 You had better go hang yourself

 ALFRED

 No were it but
 To make sure that the Past from the Future is shut
 It were worth the step back Do you think we should live
 With the living so lightly and learn to survive
 That wild moment in which to the grave and its gloom
 We consignd our hearts best if the doors of the tomb
 Were not lockd with a key which Fate keeps for our sake
 If the dead could return or the corpses awake

 JOHN

 Nonsense

 ALFRED

 Not wholly The man who gets up
 A filld guest from the banquet and drains off his cup
 Sees the last lamp extinguishd with cheerfulness goes
 Well contented to bed and enjoys its repose
 But he who hath suppd at the tables of kings
 And yet starved in the sight of luxurious things
 Who hath watchd the wine flow by himself but half tasted
 Heard the music and yet missd the tune who hath wasted
 One part of lifes grand possibilitiesfriend
 That man will bear with him be sure to the end
 A blighted experience a rancor within
 You may call it a virtue I call it a sin

 JOHN

 I see you remember the cynical story
 Of that wicked old piece Experiencea hoary
 Lothario whom dying the priest by his bed
 Knowing well the unprincipled life he had led
 And observing with no small amount of surprise
 Resignation and calm in the old sinners eyes
 Askd if he had nothing that weighd on his mind
 Well no says Lothario I think not I find
 On reviewing my life which in most things was pleasant
 I never neglected when once it was present
 An occasion of pleasing myself On the whole
 I have naught to regret and so smiling his soul
 Took its flight from this world

 ALFRED

 Well Regret or Remorse
 Which is best

 JOHN

 Why Regret

 ALFRED

 No Remorse Jack of course
 For the one is related be sure to the other
 Regret is a spiteful old maid but her brother
 Remorse though a widower certainly yet
 HAS been wed to young Pleasure Dear Jack hang Regret

 JOHN

 Bref you mean then to go

 ALFRED

 Bref I do

 JOHN

 One word stay
 Are you really in love with Matilda

 ALFRED

 Love eh
 What a question Of course

 JOHN

 WERE you really in love
 With Madame de Nevers

 ALFRED

 What Lucile No by Jove
 Never REALLY

 JOHN

 Shes pretty

 ALFRED

 Decidedly so
 At least so she was some ten summers ago
 As soft and as sallow as Autumnwith hair
 Neither black nor yet brown but that tinge which the air
 Takes at eve in September when night lingers lone
 Through a vineyard from beams of a slowsetting sun
 Eyesthe wistful gazelles the fine foot of a fairy
 And a hand fit a fays wand to wavewhite and airy
 A voice soft and sweet as a tune that one knows
 Something in her there was set you thinking of those
 Strange backgrounds of Raphael that hectic and deep
 Brief twilight in which southern suns fall asleep

 JOHN

 Coquette

 ALFRED

 Not at all Twas her one fault Not she
 I had loved her the better had she less loved me
 The heart of a mans like that delicate weed
 Which requires to be trampled on boldly indeed
 Ere it give forth the fragrance you wish to extract
 Tis a simile trust me if not new exact

 JOHN

 Women change so

 ALFRED

 Of course

 JOHN

 And unless rumor errs
 I believe that last year the Comtesse de Nevers
 Was at Baden the rageheld an absolute court
 Of devoted adorers and really made sport
 Of her subjects


  O Shakespeare how couldst thou ask Whats in a name
 Tis the devils in it when a bard has to frame
 English rhymes for alliance with names that are French
 And in these rhymes of mine well I know that I trench
 All too far on that license which critics refuse
 With just right to accord to a wellbroughtup Muse
 Yet tho faulty the union in many a line
 Twixt my Britishborn verse and my French heroine
 Since however auspiciously wedded they be
 There is many a pair that yet cannot agree
 Your forgiveness for this pair the author invites
 Whom necessity not inclination unites


 ALFRED

 Indeed

 JOHN

 When she broke off with you
 Her engagement her heart did not break with it

 ALFRED

 Pooh
 Pray would you have had her dress always in black
 And shut herself up in a convent dear Jack
 Besides twas my fault the engagement was broken

 JOHN

 Most likely How was it

 ALFRED

 The tale is soon spoken
 She bored me I showd it She saw it What next
 She reproachd I retorted Of course she was vexd
 I was vexd that she was so She sulkd So did I
 If I askd her to sing she lookd ready to cry
 I was contrite submissive She softend I hardend
 At noon I was banishd At eve I was pardond
 She said I had no heart I said she had no reason
 I swore she talkd nonsense She sobbd I talkd treason
 In short my dear fellow twas time as you see
 Things should come to a crisis and finish Twas she
 By whom to that crisis the matter was brought
 She released me I lingerd I lingerd she thought
 With too sullen an aspect This gave me of course
 The occasion to fly in a rage mount my horse
 And declare myself uncomprehended And so
 We parted The rest of the story you know

 JOHN

 No indeed

 ALFRED

 Well we parted Of course we could not
 Continue to meet as before in one spot
 You conceive it was awkward Even Don Ferdinando
 Can do you remember no more than he can do
 I think that I acted exceedingly well
 Considering the time when this rupture befell
 For Paris was charming just then It deranged
 All my plans for the winter I askd to be changed
 Wrote for Naples then vacantobtaind itand so
 Joind my new post at once but scarce reachd it when lo
 My first news from Paris informs me Lucile
 Is ill and in danger Conceive what I feel
 I fly back I find her recoverd but yet
 Looking pale I am seized with a contrite regret
 I ask to renew the engagement

 JOHN

 And she

 ALFRED

 Reflects but declines We part swearing to be
 Friends ever friends only All that sort of thing
 We each keep our letters a portrait a ring
 With a pledge to return them whenever the one
 Or the other shall call for them back

 JOHN

 Pray go on

 ALFRED

 My story is finishd Of course I enjoin
 On Lucile all those thousand good maxims we coin
 To supply the grim deficit found in our days
 When love leaves them bankrupt I preach She obeys
 She goes out in the world takes to dancing once more
 A pleasure she rarely indulged in before
 I go back to my post and collect I must own
 Tis a taste I had never before my dear John
 Antiques and small Elzevirs Heigho now Jack
 You know all

 JOHN after a pause

 You are really resolved to go back

 ALFRED

 Eh where

 JOHN

 To that worst of all placesthe past
 You remember Lots wife

 ALFRED

 Twas a promise when last
 We parted My honor is pledged to it

 JOHN

 Well
 What is it you wish me to do

 ALFRED

 You must tell
 Matilda I meant to have calldto leave word
 To explainbut the time was so pressing

 JOHN

 My lord
 Your lordships obedient I really cant do

 ALFRED

 You wish then to break off my marriage

 JOHN

 No no
 But indeed I cant see why yourself you need take
 These letters

 ALFRED

 Not see would you have me then break
 A promise my honor is pledged to

 JOHN humming

 Off off
 And away said the stranger

 ALFRED

 Oh good oh you scoff

 JOHN

 At what my dear Alfred

 ALFRED

 At all things
 JOHN
 Indeed


 ALFRED

 Yes I see that your heart is as dry as a reed
 That the dew of your youth is rubbd off you I see
 You have no feeling left in you even for me
 At honor you jest you are cold as a stone
 To the warm voice of friendship Belief you have none
 You have lost faith in all things You carry a blight
 About with you everywhere Yes at the sight
 Of such callous indifference who could be calm
 I must leave you at once Jack or else the last balm
 That is left me in Gilead youll turn into gall
 Heartless cold unconcernd

 JOHN

 Have you done Is that all
 Well then listen to me I presume when you made
 up your mind to propose to Miss Darcy you weighd
 All the drawbacks against the equivalent gains
 Ere you finally settled the point What remains
 But to stick to your choice You want money tis here
 A settled position tis yours A career
 You secure it A wife young and pretty as rich
 Whom all men will envy you Why must you itch
 To be running away on the eve of all this
 To a woman whom never for once did you miss
 All these years since you left her Who knows what may hap
 This letterto MEis a palpable trap
 The woman has changed since you knew her Perchance
 She yet seeks to renew her youths broken romance
 When women begin to feel youth and their beauty
 Slip from them they count it a sort of a duty
 To let nothing else slip away unsecured
 Which these while they lasted might once have procured
 Luciles a coquette to the end of her fingers
 I will stake my last farthing Perhaps the wish lingers
 To recall the once reckless indifferent lover
 To the feet he has left let intrigue now recover
 What truth could not keep Twere a vengeance no doubt
 A triumphbut why must YOU bring it about
 You are risking the substance of all that you schemed
 To obtain and for what some mad dream you have dreamd

 ALFRED

 But theres nothing to risk You exaggerate Jack
 You mistake In three days at the most I am back

 JOHN

 Ay but how discontented unsettled upset
 Bearing with you a comfortless twinge of regret
 Preoccupied sulky and likely enough
 To make your betrothd break off all in a huff
 Three days do you say But in three days who knows
 What may happen I dont nor do you I suppose


 V


 Of all the good things in this good world around us
 The one most abundantly furnishd and found us
 And which for that reason we least care about
 And can best spare our friends is good counsel no doubt
 But advice when tis sought from a friend though civility
 May forbid to avow it means mere liability
 In the bill we already have drawn on Remorse
 Which we deem that a true friend is bound to indorse
 A mere lecture on debt from that friend is a bore
 Thus the better his cousins advice was the more
 Alfred Vargrave with angry resentment opposed it
 And having the worst of the contest he closed it
 With so firm a resolve his bad ground to maintain
 That sadly perceiving resistance was vain
 And argument fruitless the amiable Jack
 Came to terms and assisted his cousin to pack
 A slender valise the one small condescension
 Which his final remonstrance obtaind whose dimension
 Excluded large outfits and cursing his stars he
 Shook hands with his friend and returnd to Miss Darcy


 VI


 Lord Alfred when last to the window he turnd
 Ere he lockd up and quitted his chamber discernd
 Matilda ride by with her cheek beaming bright
 In what Virgil has calld Youths purpureal light
 I like the expression and cant find a better
 He sighd as he lookd at her Did he regret her
 In her habit and hat with her glad golden hair
 As airy and blithe as a blithe bird in air
 And her arch rosy lips and her eager blue eyes
 With her little impertinent look of surprise
 And her round youthful figure and fair neck below
 The dark drooping feather as radiant as snow
 I can only declare that if I had the chance
 Of passing three days in the exquisite glance
 Of those eyes or caressing the hand that now petted
 That fine English mare I should much have regretted
 Whatever might lose me one little halfhour
 Of a pastime so pleasant when once in my power
 For if one drop of milk from the bright Milky Way
 Could turn into a woman twould look I dare say
 Not more fresh than Matilda was looking that day


 VII


 But whatever the feeling that prompted the sigh
 With which Alfred Vargrave now watched her ride by
 I can only affirm that in watching her ride
 As he turned from the window he certainly sighd




CANTO II

 I


 LETTER FROM LORD ALFRED VARGRAVE TO THE COMTESSE DE NEVERS

 BIGORRE TUESDAY


 Your note Madam reachd me today at Bigorre
 And commands need I add my obedience Before
 The night I shall be at Luchonwhere a line
 If sent to Duvals the hotel where I dine
 Will find me awaiting your orders Receive
 My respects
 Yours sincerely
 A VARGRAVE
 I leave
 In an hour


 II


 In an hour from the time he wrote this
 Alfred Vargrave in tracking a mountain abyss
 Gave the rein to his steed and his thoughts and pursued
 In pursuing his course through the blue solitude
 The reflections that journey gave rise to
 And
 Because without some such precaution I fear
 You might fail to distinguish them each from the rest
 Of the world they belong to whose captives are drest
 As our convicts precisely the same one and all
 While the coat cut for Peter is passd on to Paul
 I resolve one by one when I pick from the mass
 The persons I want as before you they pass
 To label them broadly in plain black and white
 On the backs of them Therefore whilst yet hes in sight
 I first label my hero


 III


 The age is gone oer
 When a man may in all things be all We have more
 Painters poets musicians and artists no doubt
 Than the great Cinquecento gave birth to but out
 Of a million of mere dilettanti when when
 Will a new LEONARDO arise on our ken
 He is gone with the age which begat him Our own
 Is too vast and too complex for one man alone
 To embody its purpose and hold it shut close
 In the palm of his hand There were giants in those
 Irreclaimable days but in these days of ours
 In dividing the work we distribute the powers
 Yet a dwarf on a dead giants shoulders sees more
 Than the live giants eyesight availed to explore
 And in lifes lengthend alphabet what used to be
 To our sires X Y Z is to us A B C
 A Vanini is roasted alive for his pains
 But a Bacon comes after and picks up his brains
 A Bruno is angrily seized by the throttle
 And hunted about by thy ghost Aristotle
 Till a More or Lavater step into his place
 Then the world turns and makes an admiring grimace
 Once the men were so great and so few they appear
 Through a distant Olympian atmosphere
 Like vast Caryatids upholding the age
 Now the men are so many and small disengage
 One man from the million to mark him next moment
 The crowd sweeps him hurriedly out of your comment
 And since we seek vainly to praise in our songs
 Mid our fellows the size which to heroes belongs
 We take the whole age for a hero in want
 Of a better and still in its favor descant
 On the strength and the beauty which failing to find
 In any one man we ascribe to mankind


 IV


 Alfred Vargrave was one of those men who achieve
 So little because of the much they conceive
 With irresolute finger he knockd at each one
 Of the doorways of life and abided in none
 His course by each star that would cross it was set
 And whatever he did he was sure to regret
 That target discussd by the travellers of old
 Which to one appeard argent to one appeard gold
 To him ever lingering on Doubts dizzy margent
 Appeard in one moment both golden and argent
 The man who seeks one thing in life and but one
 May hope to achieve it before life be done
 But he who seeks all things wherever he goes
 Only reaps from the hopes which around him he sows
 A harvest of barren regrets And the worm
 That crawls on in the dust to the definite term
 Of its creeping existence and sees nothing more
 Than the path it pursues till its creeping be oer
 In its limited vision is happier far
 Than the HalfSage whose course fixd by no friendly star
 Is by each star distracted in turn and who knows
 Each will still be as distant wherever he goes


 V


 Both brilliant and brittle both bold and unstable
 Indecisive yet keen Alfred Vargrave seemd able
 To dazzle but not to illumine mankind
 A vigorous various versatile mind
 A character wavering fitful uncertain
 As the shadow that shakes oer a luminous curtain
 Vague flitting but on it forever impressing
 The shape of some substance at which you stand guessing
 When you said All is worthless and weak here behold
 Into sight on a sudden there seemd to unfold
 Great outlines of strenuous truth in the man
 When you said This is genius the outlines grew wan
 And his life though in all things so gifted and skilld
 Was at best but a promise which nothing fulfilld


 VI


 In the budding of youth ere wild winds can deflower
 The shut leaves of mans life round the germ of his power
 Yet folded his life had been earnest Alas
 In that life one occasion one moment there was
 When this earnestness might with the lifesap of youth
 Lusty fruitage have borne in his manhoods full growth
 But it found him too soon when his nature was still
 The delicate toy of too pliant a will
 The boisterous wind of the world to resist
 Or the frost of the worlds wintry wisdom
 He missd
 That occasion too rathe in its advent
 Since then
 He had made it a law in his commerce with men
 That intensity in him which only left sore
 The heart it disturbd to repel and ignore
 And thus as some Prince by his subjects deposed
 Whose strength he by seeking to crush it disclosed
 In resigning the power he lackd power to support
 Turns his back upon courts with a sneer at the court
 In his converse this man for selfcomfort appeald
 To a cynic denial of all he conceald
 In the instincts and feelings belied by his words
 Words however are things and the man who accords
 To his language the license to outrage his soul
 Is controlld by the words he disdains to control
 And therefore he seemd in the deeds of each day
 The light code proclaimd on his lips to obey
 And the slave of each whim followd wilfully aught
 That perchance foold the fancy or flatterd the thought
 Yet indeed deep within him the spirits of truth
 Vast vague aspirations the powers of his youth
 Lived and breathed and made moanstirrd themselvesstrove to start
 Into deedsthough deposed in that Hades his heart
 Like those antique Theogonies ruind and hurld
 Under clefts of the hills which convulsing the world
 Heaved in earthquake their heads the rent caverns above
 To trouble at times in the light court of Jove
 All its frivolous gods with an undefined awe
 Of wrongd rebel powers that ownd not their law
 For his sake I am fain to believe that if born
 To some lowlier rank from the worlds languid scorn
 Secured by the worlds stern resistance where strife
 Strife and toil and not pleasure gave purpose to life
 He possibly might have contrived to attain
 Not eminence only but worth So again
 Had he been of his own house the firstborn each gift
 Of a mind manygifted had gone to uplift
 A great name by a names greatest uses
 But there
 He stood isolated opposed as it were
 To lifes great realities part of no plan
 And if ever a nobler and happier man
 He might hope to become that alone could be when
 With all that is real in life and in men
 What was real in him should have been reconciled
 When each influence now from experience exiled
 Should have seized on his being combined with his nature
 And formd as by fusion a new human creature
 As when those airy elements viewless to sight
 The amalgam of which if our science be right
 The germ of this populous planet doth fold
 Unite in the glass of the chemist behold
 Where a void seemd before there a substance appears
 From the fusion of forces whence issued the spheres


 VII


 But the permanent cause why his life faild and missd
 The full value of life waswhere man should resist
 The world which mans genius is calld to command
 He gave way less from lack of the power to withstand
 Than from lack of the resolute will to retain
 Those strongholds of life which the world strives to gain
 Let this character go in the oldfashiond way
 With the moral thereof tightly tackd to it Say
 Let any man once show the world that he feels
 Afraid of its bark and twill fly at his heels
 Let him fearlessly face it twill leave him alone
 But twill fawn at his feet if he flings it a bone


 VIII


 The moon of September now half at the full
 Was unfolding from darkness and dreamland the lull
 Of the quiet blue air where the manyfaced hills
 Watchd wellpleased their fair slaves the light foamfooted rills
 Dance and sing down the steep marble stairs of their courts
 And gracefully fashion a thousand sweet sports
 Lord Alfred by this on his journeying far
 Was pensively puffing his Lopez cigar
 And brokenly humming an old opera strain
 And thinking perchance of those castles in Spain
 Which that long rocky barrier hid from his sight
 When suddenly out of the neighboring night
 A horseman emerged from a fold of the hill
 And so startled his steed that was winding at will
 Up the thin dizzy strip of a pathway which led
 Oer the mountainthe reins on its neck and its head
 Hanging lazily forwardthat but for a hand
 Light and ready yet firm in familiar command
 Both rider and horse might have been in a trice
 Hurld horribly over the grim precipice


 IX


 As soon as the moments alarm had subsided
 And the oath with which nothing can find unprovided
 A thoroughbred Englishman safely exploded
 Lord Alfred unbent as Apollo his bow did
 Now and then his erectness and looking not ruder
 Than such inroad would warrant surveyd the intruder
 Whose arrival so nearly cut short in his glory
 My hero and finished abruptly this story


 X


 The stranger a man of his own age or less
 Well mounted and simple though rich in his dress
 Wore his beard and mustache in the fashion of France
 His face which was pale gatherd force from the glance
 Of a pair of dark vivid and eloquent eyes
 With a gest of apology touchd with surprise
 He lifted his hat bowd and courteously made
 Some excuse in such wellcadenced French as betrayd
 At the first word he spoke the Parisian


 XI


 I swear
 I have wanderd about in the world everywhere
 From many strange mouths have heard many strange tongues
 Straind with many strange idioms my lips and my lungs
 Walkd in many a far land regretting my own
 In many a language groaned many a groan
 And have often had reason to curse those wild fellows
 Who built the high house at which Heaven turnd jealous
 Making human audacity stumble and stammer
 When seized by the throat in the hard gripe of Grammar
 But the language of languages dearest to me
 Is that in which once O ma toute cherie
 When together we bent oer your nosegay for hours
 You explaind what was silently said by the flowers
 And selecting the sweetest of all sent a flame
 Through my heart as in laughing you murmurd
 Je taime


 XII


 The Italians have voices like peacocks the Spanish
 Smell I fancy of garlic the Swedish and Danish
 Have something too Runic too rough and unshod in
 Their accents for mouths not descended from Odin
 German gives me a cold in the head sets me wheezing
 And coughing and Russian is nothing but sneezing
 But by Belus and Babel I never have heard
 And I never shall hear I well know it one word
 Of that delicate idiom of Paris without
 Feeling morally sure beyond question or doubt
 By the wild way in which my heart inwardly flutterd
 That my hearts native tongue to my heart had been utterd
 And wheneer I hear French spoken as I approve
 I feel myself quietly falling in love


 XIII


 Lord Alfred on hearing the stranger appeased
 By a something an accent a cadence which pleased
 His ear with that pledge of good breeding which tells
 At once of the world in whose fellowship dwells
 The speaker that owns it was glad to remark
 In the horseman a man one might meet after dark
 Without fear
 And thus not disagreeably impressd
 As it seemd with each other the two men abreast
 Rode on slowly a moment


 XIV


 STRANGER

 I see Sir you are
 A smoker Allow me

 ALFRED

 Pray take a cigar

 STRANGER

 Many thanks Such cigars are a luxury here
 Do you go to Luchon

 ALFRED

 Yes and you

 STRANGER

 Yes I fear
 Since our road is the same that our journey must be
 Somewhat closer than is our acquaintance You see
 How narrow the path is Im tempted to ask
 Your permission to finish no difficult task
 The cigar you have given me really a prize
 In your company

 ALFRED

 Charmd Sir to find your road lies
 In the way of my own inclinations Indeed
 The dream of your nation I find in this weed
 In the distant Savannahs a talisman grows
 That makes all men brothers that use it who knows
 That blaze which erewhile from the Boulevart outbroke
 It has ended where wisdom begins Sirin smoke
 Messieurs Lopez whatever your publicists write
 Have done more in their way human kind to unite
 Perchance than ten Prudhons

 STRANGER

 Yes Ah what a scene

 ALFRED

 Humph Nature is here too pretentious Her mien
 Is too haughty One likes to be coaxd not compelld
 To the notice such beauty resents if withheld
 She seems to be saying too plainly Admire me
 And I answer Yes madam I do but you tire me

 STRANGER

 That sunset just now though

 ALFRED

 A very old trick
 One would think that the sun by this time must be sick
 Of blushing at what by this time he must know
 Too well to be shocked bythis world

 STRANGER

 Ah tis so
 With us all Tis the sinner that best knew the world
 At Twenty whose lip is at sixty most curld
 With disdain of its follies You stay at Luchon

 ALFRED

 A day or two only

 STRANGER

 The season is done


 ALFRED

 Already

 STRANGER

 Twas shorter this year than the last
 Folly soon wears her shoes out She dances so fast
 We are all of us tired

 ALFRED

 You know the place well

 STRANGER

 I have been there two seasons

 ALFRED

 Pray who is the Belle
 Of the Baths at this moment

 STRANGER

 The same who has been
 The belle of all places in which she is seen
 The belle of all Paris last winter last spring
 The belle of all Baden

 ALFRED

 An uncommon thing

 STRANGER

 Sir an uncommon beauty I rather should say
 An uncommon character Truly each day
 One meets women whose beauty is equal to hers
 But none with the charm of Lucile de Nevers

 ALFRED

 Madame de Nevers

 STRANGER

 Do you know her

 ALFRED

 I know
 Or rather I knew hera long time ago
 I almost forget

 STRANGER

 What a wit what a grace
 In her language her movements what play in her face
 And yet what a sadness she seems to conceal

 ALFRED

 You speak like a lover

 STRANGER

 I speak as I feel
 But not like a lover What interests me so
 In Lucile at the same time forbids me I know
 To give to that interest whateer the sensation
 The name we men give to an hours admiration
 A nights passing passion an actresss eyes
 A dancing girls ankles a fine ladys sighs

 ALFRED

 Yes I quite comprehend But this sadnessthis shade
 Which you speak of it almost would make me afraid
 Your gay countrymen Sir less adroit must have grown
 Since when as a stripling at Paris I own
 I found in them terrible rivalsif yet
 They have all lackd the skill to console this regret
 If regret be the word I should use or fulfil
 This desire if desire be the word which seems still
 To endure unappeased For I take it for granted
 From all that you say that the will was not wanted


 XV


 The stranger replied not without irritation
 I have heard that an Englishmanone of your nation
 I presumeand if so I must beg you indeed
 To excuse the contempt which I

 ALFRED

 Pray Sir proceed
 With your tale My compatriot what was his crime

 STRANGER

 Oh nothing His folly was not so sublime
 As to merit that term If I blamed him just now
 It was not for the sin but the silliness

 ALFRED

 How

 STRANGER

 I own I hate Botany Still admit
 Although I myself have no passion for it
 And do not understand yet I cannot despise
 The cold man of science who walks with his eyes
 All alert through a garden of flowers and strips
 The lilies gold tongues and the roses red lips
 With a ruthless dissection since he I suppose
 Has some purpose beyond the mere mischief he does
 But the stupid and mischievous boy that uproots
 The exotics and tramples the tender young shoots
 For a boys brutal pastime and only because
 He knows no distinction twixt heartsease and haws
 One would wish for the sake of each nursling so nippd
 To catch the young rascal and have him well whippd

 ALFRED

 Some compatriot of mine do I then understand
 With a cold Northern heart and a rude English hand
 Has injured your Rosebud of France

 STRANGER

 Sir I know
 But little or nothing Yet some faces show
 The last act of a tragedy in their regard
 Though the first scenes be wanting it yet is not hard
 To divine more or less what the plot may have been
 And what sort of actors have passd oer the scene
 And whenever I gaze on the face of Lucile
 With its pensive and passionless languor I feel
 That some feeling hath burnt there burnt out and burnt up
 Health and hope So you feel when you gaze down the cup
 Of extinguishd volcanoes you judge of the fire
 Once there by the ravage you seethe desire
 By the apathy left in its wake and that sense
 Of a moral immovable mute impotence

 ALFRED

 Humph I see you have finished at last your cigar
 Can I offer another

 STRANGER

 No thank you We are
 Not two miles from Luchon

 ALFRED

 You know the road well

 STRANGER

 I have often been over it


 XVI


 Here a pause fell
 On their converse Still musingly on side by side
 In the moonlight the two men continued to ride
 Down the dim mountain pathway But each for the rest
 Of their journey although they still rode on abreast
 Continued to follow in silence the train
 Of the different feelings that haunted his brain
 And each as though roused from a deep revery
 Almost shouted descending the mountain to see
 Burst at once on the moonlight the silvery Baths
 The long limetree alley the dark gleaming paths
 With the lamps twinkling through themthe quaint wooden roofs
 The little white houses
 The clatter of hoofs
 And the music of wandering bands up the walls
 Of the steep hanging hill at remote intervals
 Reached them crossd by the sound of the clacking of whips
 And here and there faintly through serpentine slips
 Of verdant rosegardens deepsheltered with screens
 Of airy acacias and dark evergreens
 They could mark the white dresses and catch the light songs
 Of the lovely Parisians that wanderd in throngs
 Led by Laughter and Love through the old eventide
 Down the dreamhaunted valley or up the hillside


 XVII


 At length at the door of the inn lHERISSON
 Pray go there if ever you go to Luchon
 The two horsemen well pleased to have reached it alighted
 And exchanged their last greetings
 The Frenchman invited
 Lord Alfred to dinner Lord Alfred declined
 He had letters to write and felt tired So he dined
 In his own rooms that night
 With an unquiet eye
 He watched his companion depart nor knew why
 Beyond all accountable reason or measure
 He felt in his breast such a sovran displeasure
 The fellows good looking he murmurd at last
 And yet not a coxcomb Some ghost of the past
 Vexd him still
 If he love her he thought let him win her
 Then he turnd to the futureand orderd his dinner


 XVIII


 O hour of all hours the most blessd upon earth
 Blessed hour of our dinners
 The land of his birth
 The face of his first love the bills that he owes
 The twaddle of friends and the venom of foes
 The sermon he heard when to church he last went
 The money he borrowd the money he spent
 All of these things a man I believe may forget
 And not be the worse for forgetting but yet
 Never never oh never earths luckiest sinner
 Hath unpunishd forgotten the hour of his dinner
 Indigestion that conscience of every bad stomach
 Shall relentlessly gnaw and pursue him with some ache
 Or some pain and trouble remorseless his best ease
 As the Furies once troubled the sleep of Orestes


 XIX


 We may live without poetry music and art
 We may live without conscience and live without heart
 We may live without friends we may live without books
 But civilized man cannot live without cooks
 He may live without bookswhat is knowledge but grieving
 He may live without hopewhat is hope but deceiving
 He may live without lovewhat is passion but pining
 But where is the man that can live without dining


 XX


 Lord Alfred found waiting his coming a note
 From Lucile
 Your last letter has reachd me she wrote
 This evening alas I must go to the ball
 And shall not be at home till too late for your call
 But tomorrow at any rate sans faute at One
 You will find me at home and will find me alone
 Meanwhile let me thank you sincerely milord
 For the honor with which you adhere to your word
 Yes I thank you Lord Alfred Tomorrow then
 L

 XXI


 I find myself terribly puzzled to tell
 The feelings with which Alfred Vargrave flung down
 This note as he pourd out his wine I must own
 That I think he himself could have hardly explaind
 Those feelings exactly
 Yes yes as he draind
 The glass down he mutterd Jacks right after all
 The coquette
 Does milord mean to go to the ball
 Askd the waiter who lingerd
 Perhaps I dont know
 You may keep me a ticket in case I should go


 XXII


 Oh better no doubt is a dinner of herbs
 When seasond by love which no rancor disturbs
 And sweetend by all that is sweetest in life
 Than turbot bisque ortolans eaten in strife
 But if out of humor and hungry alone
 A man should sit down to a dinner each one
 Of the dishes of which the cook chooses to spoil
 With a horrible mixture of garlic and oil
 The chances are ten against one I must own
 He gets up as illtemperd as when he sat down
 And if any reader this fact to dispute is
 Disposed I say Allium edat cicutis
 Nocentius
 Over the fruit and the wine
 Undisturbd the wasp settled The evening was fine
 Lord Alfred his chair by the window had set
 And languidly lighted his small cigarette
 The window was open The warm air without
 Waved the flame of the candles The moths were about
 In the gloom he sat gloomy


 XXIII


 Gay sounds from below
 Floated up like faint echoes of joys long ago
 And night deepend apace through the dark avenues
 The lamps twinkled bright and by threes and by twos
 The idlers of Luchon were strolling at will
 As Lord Alfred could see from the cool windowsill
 Where his gaze as he languidly turnd it fell oer
 His late travelling companion now passing before
 The inn at the window of which he still sat
 In full toiletboots varnishd and snowy cravat
 Gayly smoothing and buttoning a yellow kid glove
 As he turned down the avenue
 Watching above
 From his window the stranger who stoppd as he walkd
 To mix with those groups and now nodded now talkd
 To the young Paris dandies Lord Alfred discernd
 By the way hats were lifted and glances were turnd
 That this unknown acquaintance now bound for the hall
 Was a person of rank or of fashion for all
 Whom he bowd to in passing or stopped with and chatterd
 Walkd on with a look which implied I feel flatterd


 XXIV


 His form was soon lost in the distance and gloom


 XXV


 Lord Alfred still sat by himself in his room
 He had finishd one after the other a dozen
 Or more cigarettes He had thought of his cousin
 He had thought of Matilda and thought of Lucile
 He had thought about many things thought a great deal
 Of himself of his past life his future his present
 He had thought of the moon neither full moon nor crescent
 Of the gay world so sad life so sweet and so sour
 He had thought too of glory and fortune and power
 Thought of love and the country and sympathy and
 A poets asylum in some distant land
 Thought of man in the abstract and woman no doubt
 In particular also he had thought much about
 His digestion his debts and his dinner and last
 He thought that the night would be stupidly passd
 If he thought any more of such matters at all
 So he rose and resolved to set out for the ball


 XXVI


 I believe ere he finishd his tardy toilet
 That Lord Alfred had spoild and flung by in a pet
 Half a dozen white neckcloths and lookd for the nonce
 Twenty times in the glass if he lookd in it once
 I believe that he split up in drawing them on
 Three pair of pale lavender gloves one by one
 And this is the reason no doubt that at last
 When he reachd the Casino although he walkd fast
 He heard as he hurriedly enterd the door
 The church clock strike Twelve


 XXVII


 The last waltz was just oer
 The chaperons and dancers were all in a flutter
 A crowd blockd the door and a buzz and a mutter
 Went about in the room as a young man whose face
 Lord Alfred had seen ere he enterd that place
 But a few hours ago through the perfumed and warm
 Flowery porch with a lady that leand on his arm
 Like a queen in a fable of old fairy days
 Left the ballroom


 XXVIII


 The hubbub of comment and praise
 Reachd Lord Alfred as just then he enterd
 Ma foi
 Said a Frenchman beside him That lucky Luvois
 Has obtained all the gifts of the gods rank and wealth
 And good looks and then such inexhaustible health
 He that hath shall have more and this truth I surmise
 Is the cause why tonight by the beautiful eyes
 Of la charmante Lucile more distinguishd than all
 He so gayly goes off with the belle of the ball
 Is it true asked a lady aggressively fat
 Who fierce as a female Leviathan sat
 By another that lookd like a needle all steel
 And tenuityLuvois will marry Lucile
 The needle seemd jerkd by a virulent twitch
 As though it were bent upon driving a stitch
 Through somebodys character
 Madam replied
 Interposing a young man who sat by their side
 And was languidly fanning his face with his hat
 I am ready to bet my new Tilbury that
 If Luvois has proposed the Comtesse has refused
 The fat and thin ladies were highly amused
 Refused what a young Duke not thirty my dear
 With at least half a million what is it a year
 That may be said a third yet I know some time since
 Castelmar was refused though as rich and a Prince
 But Luvois who was never before in his life
 In love with a woman who was not a wife
 Is now certainly serious


 XXIX


 The music once more
 Recommenced


 XXX


 Said Lord Alfred This ball is a bore
 And returnd to the inn somewhat worse than before


 XXXI


 There whilst musing he leand the dark valley above
 Through the warm land were wandring the spirits of love
 A soft breeze in the white window drapery stirrd
 In the blossomd acacia the lone cricket chirrd
 The scent of the roses fell faint oer the night
 And the moon on the mountain was dreaming in light
 Repose and yet rapture that pensive wild nature
 Impregnate with passion in each breathing feature
 A stones throw from thence through the large limetrees peepd
 In a garden of roses a white chalet steepd
 In the moonbeams The windows oped down to the lawn
 The casements were open the curtains were drawn
 Lights streamd from the inside and with them the sound
 Of music and song In the garden around
 A table with fruits wine tea ices there set
 Half a dozen young men and young women were met
 Light laughter and voices and music all streamd
 Through the quietleaved limes At the window there seemd
 For one moment the outline familiar and fair
 Of a white dress white neck and soft dusky hair
 Which Lord Alfred rememberd a moment or so
 It hoverd then passd into shadow and slow
 The soft notes from a tender piano upflung
 Floated forth and a voice unforgotten thus sung


 Hear a song that was born in the land of my birth
 The anchors are lifted the fair ship is free
 And the shout of the mariners floats in its mirth
 Twixt the light in the sky and the light on the sea

 And this ship is a world She is freighted with souls
 She is freighted with merchandise proudly she sails
 With the Labor that stores and the Will that controls
 The gold in the ingots the silk in the bales

 From the gardens of Pleasure where reddens the rose
 And the scent of the cedar is faint on the air
 Past the harbors of Traffic sublimely she goes
 Mans hopes oer the world of the waters to bear

 Where the cheer from the harbors of Traffic is heard
 Where the gardens of Pleasure fade fast on the sight
 Oer the rose oer the cedar there passes a bird
 Tis the Paradise Bird never known to alight

 And that bird bright and bold as a poets desire
 Roams her own native heavens the realms of her birth
 There she soars like a seraph she shines like a fire
 And her plumage hath never been sullied by earth

 And the mariners greet her theres song on each lip
 For that bird of good omen and joy in each eye
 And the ship and the bird and the bird and the ship
 Together go forth over ocean and sky

 Fast fast fades the land far the rosegardens flee
 And far fleet the harbors In regions unknown
 The ship is alone on a desert of sea
 And the bird in a desert of sky is alone

 In those regions unknown oer that desert of air
 Down that desert of waterstremendous in wrath
 The stormwind Euroclydon leaps from his lair
 And cleaves thro the waves of the ocean his path

 And the bird in the cloud and the ship on the wave
 Overtaken are beaten about by wild gales
 And the mariners all rush their cargo to save
 Of the gold in the ingots the silk in the bales

 Lo a wonder which never before hath been heard
 For it never before hath been given to sight
 On the ship bath descended the Paradise Bird
 The Paradise Bird never known to alight

 The bird which the mariners blessd when each lip
 Had a song for the omen that gladdend each eye
 The bright bird for shelter hath flown to the ship
 From the wrath on the sea and the wrath in the sky

 But the mariners heed not the bird any more
 They are felling the maststhey are cutting the sails
 Some are working some weeping and some wrangling oer
 Their gold in the ingots their silk in the bales

 Souls of men are on board wealth of man in the hold
 And the stormwind Euroclydon sweeps to his prey
 And who heeds the bird Save the silk and the gold
 And the bird from her shelter the gust sweeps away

 Poor Paradise Bird on her lone flight once more
 Back again in the wake of the wind she is driven
 To be whelmed in the storm or above it to soar
 And if rescued from ocean to vanish in heaven

 And the ship rides the waters and weathers the gales
 From the haven she nears the rejoicing is heard
 All hands are at work on the ingots the bales
 Save a child sitting lonely who missesthe bird




CANTO III

 I


 With stout iron shoes be my Pegasus shod
 For my road is a rough one flint stubble and clod
 Blue clay and black quagmire brambles no few
 And I gallop uphill now

 Theres terror thats true
 In that tale of a youth who one night at a revel
 Amidst music and mirth lured and wiled by some devil
 Followd ever one mask through the mad masquerade
 Till pursued to some chamber deserted tis said
 He unmasked with a kiss the strange lady and stood
 Face to face with a Thing not of flesh nor of blood
 In this Mask of the Passions calld Life theres no human
 Emotion though maskd or in man or in woman
 But when faced and unmaskd it will leave us at last
 Struck by some supernatural aspect aghast
 For truth is appalling and eldrich as seen
 By this worlds artificial lamplights and we screen
 From our sight the strange vision that troubles our life
 Alas why is Genius forever at strife
 With the world which despite the worlds self it ennobles
 Why is it that Genius perplexes and troubles
 And offends the effete life it comes to renew
 Tis the terror of truth tis that Genius is true


 II


 Lucile de Nevers if her riddle I read
 Was a woman of genius whose genius indeed
 With her life was at war Once but once in that life
 The chance had been hers to escape from this strife
 In herself finding peace in the life of another
 From the passionate wants she in hers failed to smother
 But the chance fell too soon when the crude restless power
 Which had been to her nature so fatal a dower
 Only wearied the man it yet haunted and thralld
 And that moment once lost had been never recalld
 Yet it left her heart sore and to shelter her heart
 From approach she then sought in that delicate art
 Of concealment those thousand adroit strategies
 Of feminine wit which repel while they please
 A weapon at once and a shield to conceal
 And defend all that women can earnestly feel
 Thus striving her instincts to hide and repress
 She felt frightend at times by her very success
 She pined for the hilltops the clouds and the stars
 Golden wires may annoy us as much as steel bars
 If they keep us behind prison windows impassiond
 Her heart rose and burst the light cage she had fashiond
 Out of glittering trifles around it

 Unknown
 To herself all her instincts without hesitation
 Embraced the idea of selfimmolation
 The strong spirit in her had her life been but blended
 With some mans whose heart had her own comprehended
 All its wealth at his feet would have lavishly thrown
 For him she had struggled and striven alone
 For him had aspired in him had transfused
 All the gladness and grace of her nature and used
 For him only the spells of its delicate power
 Like the ministering fairy that brings from her bower
 To some maze all the treasures whose use the fond elf
 More enrichd by her love disregards for herself
 But standing apart as she ever had done
 And her genius which needed a vent finding none
 In the broad fields of action thrown wide to mans power
 She unconsciously made it her bulwark and tower
 And built in it her refuge whence lightly she hurld
 Her contempt at the fashions and forms of the world

 And the permanent cause why she now missd and faild
 That firm hold upon life she so keenly assaild
 Was in all those diurnal occasions that place
 Saythe world and the woman opposed face to face
 Where the woman must yield she refusing to stir
 Offended the world which in turn wounded her

 As before in the oldfashiond manner I fit
 To this character also its moral to wit
 Saythe world is a nettle disturb it it stings
 Grasp it firmly it stings not On one of two things
 If you would not be stung it behoves you to settle
 Avoid it or crush it She crushd not the nettle
 For she could not nor would she avoid it she tried
 With the weak hand of woman to thrust it aside
 And it stung her A woman is too slight a thing
 To trample the world without feeling its sting


 III


 One lodges but simply at Luchon yet thanks
 To the season that changes forever the banks
 Of the blossoming mountains and shifts the light cloud
 Oer the valley and hushes or rouses the loud
 Wind that wails in the pines or creeps murmuring down
 The dark evergreen slopes to the slumbering town
 And the torrent that falls faintly heard from afar
 And the bluebells that purple the dapplegray scaur
 One sees with each month of the manyfaced year
 A thousand sweet changes of beauty appear
 The chalet where dwelt the Comtesse de Nevers
 Rested half up the base of a mountain of firs
 In a garden of roses reveald to the road
 Yet withdrawn from its noise twas a peaceful abode
 And the walls and the roofs with their gables like hoods
 Which the monks wear were built of sweet resinous woods
 The sunlight of noon as Lord Alfred ascended
 The steep garden paths every odor had blended
 Of the ardent carnations and faint heliotropes
 With the balms floated down from the dark wooded slopes
 A light breeze at the window was playing about
 And the white curtains floated now in and now out
 The house was all hushd when he rang at the door
 Which was opend to him in a moment or more
 By an old nodding negress whose sable head shined
 In the sun like a cocoanut polished in Ind
 Neath the snowy foulard which about it was wound


 IV


 Lord Alfred sprang forward at once with a bound
 He remembered the nurse of Lucile The old dame
 Whose teeth and whose eyes used to beam when he came
 With a boys eager step in the blithe days of yore
 To pass unannounced her young mistresss door
 The old woman had fondled Lucile on her knee
 When she left as an infant far over the sea
 In India the tomb of a mother unknown
 To pine a pale flowret in great Paris town
 She had soothd the childs sobs on her breast when she read
 The letter that told her her father was dead
 An astute shrewd adventurer who like Ulysses
 Had studied men cities laws wars the abysses
 Of statecraft with varying fortunes was he
 He had wanderd the world through by land and by sea
 And knew it in most of its phases Strong will
 Subtle tact and soft manners had given him skill
 To conciliate Fortune and courage to brave
 Her displeasure Thrice shipwreckd and cast by the wave
 On his own quick resources they rarely had faild
 His command often baffled he ever prevaild
 In his combat with fate today flatterd and fed
 By monarchs tomorrow in search of mere bread
 The offspring of times troublehaunted he came
 Of a family ruind yet noble in name
 He lost sight of his fortune at twenty in France
 And half statesman half soldier and wholly Freelance
 Had wanderd in search of it over the world
 Into India

 But scarce had the nomad unfurld
 His wandering tent at Mysore in the smile
 Of a Rajah whose court he controlld for a while
 And whose council he prompted and governd by stealth
 Scarce indeed had he wedded an Indian of wealth
 Who died giving birth to this daughter before
 He was borne to the tomb of his wife at Mysore
 His fortune which fell to his orphan perchance
 Had secured her a home with his sister in France
 A lone woman the last of the race left Lucile
 Neither felt nor affected the wish to conceal
 The halfEastern blood which appeard to bequeath
 Reveald now and then though but rarely beneath
 That outward repose that concealed it in her
 A something half wild to her strange character
 The nurse with the orphan awhile brokenhearted
 At the door of a convent in Paris had parted
 But later once more with her mistress she tarried
 When the girl by that grim maiden aunt had been married
 To a dreary old Count who had sullenly died
 With no claim on her tearsshe had wept as a bride
 Said Lord Alfred Your mistress expects me

 The crone
 Oped the drawingroom door and there left him alone


 V


 Oer the soft atmosphere of this temple of grace
 Rested silence and perfume No sound reachd the place
 In the white curtains waverd the delicate shade
 Of the heaving acacias through which the breeze playd
 Oer the smooth wooden floor polished dark as a glass
 Fragrant white Indian matting allowed you to pass
 In light olive baskets by window and door
 Some hung from the ceiling some crowding the floor
 Rich wild flowers pluckd by Lucile from the hill
 Seemd the room with their passionate presence to fill
 Blue aconite hid in white roses reposed
 The deep belladonna its vermeil disclosed
 And the frail saponaire and the tender bluebell
 And the purple valerianeach child of the fell
 And the solitude flourishd fed fair from the source
 Of waters the huntsman scarce heeds in his course
 Where the chamois and izard with delicate hoof
 Pause or flit through the pinnacled silence aloof


 VI


 Here you felt by the sense of its beauty reposed
 That you stood in a shrine of sweet thoughts Half unclosed
 In the light slept the flowers all was pure and at rest
 All peaceful all modest all seemd selfpossessd
 And aware of the silence No vestige nor trace
 Of a young womans coquetry troubled the place
 He stood by the window A cloud passd the sun
 A light breeze uplifted the leaves one by one
 Just then Lucile enterd the room undiscernd
 By Lord Alfred whose face to the window was turned
 In a strange revery
 The time was when Lucile
 In beholding that man could not help but reveal
 The rapture the fear which wrenchd out every nerve
 In the heart of the girl from the womans reserve
 And nowshe gazed at him calm smilingperchance
 Indifferent


 VII


 Indifferently turning his glance
 Alfred Vargrave encounterd that gaze unaware
 Oer a bodice snowwhite streamd her soft dusky hair
 A rosebud half blown in her hand in her eyes
 A halfpensive smile

 A sharp cry of surprise
 Escaped from his lips some unknown agitation
 An invincible trouble a strange palpitation
 Confused his ingenious and frivolous wit
 Overtook and entangled and paralyzed it
 That wit so complacent and docile that ever
 Lightly came at the call of the lightest endeavor
 Ready coind and availably current as gold
 Which secure of its value so fluently rolld
 In free circulation from hand on to hand
 For the usage of all at a moments command
 For once it rebelld it was mute and unstirrd
 And he looked at Lucile without speaking a word


 VIII


 Perhaps what so troubled him was that the face
 On whose features he gazed had no more than a trace
 Of the face his remembrance had imaged for years
 Yes the face he rememberd was faded with tears
 Grief had famishd the figure and dimmed the dark eyes
 And starved the pale lips too acquainted with sighs
 And that tender and gracious and fond coquetterie
 Of a woman who knows her least ribbon to be
 Something dear to the lips that so warmly caress
 Every sacred detail of her exquisite dress
 In the careless toilet of Lucilethen too sad
 To care aught to her changeable beauty to add
 Lord Alfred had never admired before
 Alas poor Lucile in those weak days of yore
 Had neglected herself never heeding or thinking
 While the blossom and bloom of her beauty were shrinking
 That sorrow can beautify only the heart
 Not the faceof a woman and can but impart
 Its endearment to one that has sufferd In truth
 Grief hath beauty for grief but gay youth loves gay youth


 IX


 The woman that now met unshrinking his gaze
 Seemd to bask in the silent but sumptuous haze
 Of that soft second summer more ripe than the first
 Which returns when the bud to the blossom hath burst
 In despite of the stormiest April Lucile
 Had acquired that matchless unconscious appeal
 To the homage which none but a churl would withhold
 That caressing and exquisite gracenever bold
 Ever presentwhich just a few women possess
 From a healthful repose undisturbd by the stress
 Of unquiet emotions her soft cheek had drawn
 A freshness as pure as the twilight of dawn
 Her figure though slight had revived everywhere
 The luxurious proportions of youth and her hair
 Once shorn as an offering to passionate love
 Now floated or rested redundant above
 Her airy pure forehead and throat gatherd loose
 Under which by one violet knot the profuse
 Milkwhite folds of a cool modest garment reposed
 Rippled faint by the breast they half hid half disclosed
 And her simple attire thus in all things reveald
 The fine art which so artfully all things conceald


 X


 Lord Alfred who never conceived that Lucile
 Could have lookd so enchanting felt tempted to kneel
 At her feet and her pardon with passion implore
 But the calm smile that met him sufficed to restore
 The pride and the bitterness needed to meet
 The occasion with dignity due and discreet


 XI


 Madamthus he began with a voice reassured
 You see that your latest command has secured
 My immediate obediencepresuming I may
 Consider my freedom restored from this day
 I had thought said Lucile with a smile gay yet sad
 That your freedom from me not a fetter has had
 Indeed in my chains have you rested till now
 I had not so flattered myself I avow
 For Heavens sake Madam Lord Alfred replied
 Do not jest has the moment no sadness he sighd
 Tis an ancient tradition she answerd a tale
 Often tolda position too sure to prevail
 In the end of all legends of love If we wrote
 When we first love foreseeing that hour yet remote
 Wherein of necessity each would recall
 From the other the poor foolish records of all
 Those emotions whose pain when recorded seemd bliss
 Should we write as we wrote But one thinks not of this
 At Twenty who does not at Twenty we write
 Believing eternal the frail vows we plight
 And we smile with a confident pity above
 The vulgar results of all poor human love
 For we deem with that vanity common to youth
 Because what we feel in our bosoms in truth
 Is novel to usthat tis novel to earth
 And will prove the exception in durance and worth
 To the great law to which all on earth must incline
 The error was noble the vanity fine
 Shall we blame it because we survive it ah no
 Twas the youth of our youth my lord is it not so


 XII


 Lord Alfred was mute He rememberd her yet
 A childthe weak sport of each moments regret
 Blindly yielding herself to the errors of life
 The deceptions of youth and borne down by the strife
 And the tumult of passion the tremulous toy
 Of each transient emotion of grief or of joy
 But to watch her pronounce the deathwarrant of all
 The illusions of lifelift unflinching the pall
 From the bier of the dead Pastthat woman so fair
 And so young yet her own selfsurvivor who there
 Traced her lifes epitaph with a finger so cold
 Twas a picture that paind his selflove to behold
 He himself knewnone betterthe things to be said
 Upon subjects like this Yet he bowd down his head
 And as thus with a trouble he could not command
 He paused crumpling the letters he held in his hand
 You know me enough she continued or what
 I would say is you yet recollect do you not
 Lord Alfred enough of my nature to know
 That these pledges of what was perhaps long ago
 A foolish affection I do not recall
 From those motives of prudence which actuate all
 Or most women when their love ceases Indeed
 If you have such a doubt to dispel it I need
 But remind you that ten years these letters have rested
 Unreclaimd in your hands A reproach seemd suggested
 By these words To meet it Lord Alfred lookd up
 His gaze had been fixd on a blue Sevres cup
 With a look of profound connoisseurshipa smile
 Of singular interest and care all this while
 He lookd up and lookd long in the face of Lucile
 To mark if that face by a sign would reveal
 At the thought of Miss Darcy the least jealous pain
 He lookd keenly and long yet he lookd there in vain
 You are generous Madam he murmurd at last
 And into his voice a light irony passd
 He had lookd for reproaches and fully arranged
 His forces But straightway the enemy changed
 The position


 XIII


 Come gayly Lucile interposed
 With a smile whose divinely deep sweetness disclosed
 Some depth in her nature he never had known
 While she tenderly laid her light hand on his own
 Do not think I abuse the occasion We gain
 Justice judgment with years or else years are in vain
 From me not a single reproach can you hear
 I have sinnd to myselfto the worldnay I fear
 To you chiefly The woman who loves should indeed
 Be the friend of the man that she loves She should heed
 Not her selfish and often mistaken desires
 But his interest whose fate her own interest inspires
 And rather than seek to allure for her sake
 His life down the turbulent fanciful wake
 Of impossible destinies use all her art
 That his place in the world find its place in her heart
 I alasI perceived not this truth till too late
 I tormented your youth I have darkend your fate
 Forgive me the ill I have done for the sake
 Of its long expiation


 XIV


 Lord Alfred awake
 Seemd to wander from dream on to dream In that seat
 Where he sat as a criminal ready to meet
 His accuser he found himself turnd by some change
 As surprising and all unexpected as strange
 To the judge from whose mercy indulgence was sought
 All the worlds foolish pride in that moment was naught
 He felt all his plausible theories posed
 And thrilld by the beauty of nature disclosed
 In the pathos of all he had witnessd his head
 He bowd and faint words selfreproachfully said
 As he lifted her hand to his lips Twas a hand
 White delicate dimpled warm languid and bland
 The hand of a woman is often in youth
 Somewhat rough somewhat red somewhat graceless in truth
 Does its beauty refine as its pulses grow calm
 Or as Sorrow has crossd the lifeline in the palm


 XV


 The more that he lookd that he listend the more
 He discoverd perfections unnoticed before
 Less salient than once less poetic perchance
 This woman who thus had survived the romance
 That had made him its hero and breathed him its sighs
 Seemd more charming a thousand times oer to his eyes
 Together they talkd of the years since when last
 They parted contrasting the present the past
 Yet no memory marrd their light converse Lucile
 Questiond much with the interest a sister might feel
 Of Lord Alfreds new lifeof Miss Darcyher face
 Her temper accomplishmentspausing to trace
 The advantage derived from a hymen so fit
 Of herself she recounted with humor and wit
 Her journeys her daily employments the lands
 She had seen and the books she had read and the hands
 She had shaken
 In all that she said there appeard
 An amiable irony Laughing she reard
 The temple of reason with ever a touch
 Of light scorn at her work reveald only so much
 As their gleams in the thyrsus that Bacchanals bear
 Through the blooms of a garland the point of a spear
 But above and beneath and beyond all of this
 To that soul whose experience had paralyzed bliss
 A benignant indulgence to all things resignd
 A justice a sweetness a meekness of mind
 Gave a luminous beauty as tender and faint
 And serene as the halo encircling a saint


 XVI


 Unobserved by Lord Alfred the time fleeted by
 To each novel sensation spontaneously
 He abandond himself with that ardor so strange
 Which belongs to a mind grown accustomd to change
 He sought with wellpractised and delicate art
 To surprise from Lucile the true state of her heart
 But his efforts were vain and the woman as ever
 More adroit than the man baffled every endeavor
 When he deemd he had touchd on some chord in her being
 At the touch it dissolved and was gone Ever fleeing
 As ever he near it advanced when he thought
 To have seized and proceeded to analyze aught
 Of the moral existence the absolute soul
 Light as vapor the phantom escaped his control


 XVII


 From the hall on a sudden a sharp ring was heard
 In the passage without a quick footstep there stirrd
 At the door knockd the negress and thrust in her head
 The Duke de Luvois had just enterd she said
 And insisted
 The Duke cried Lucile as she spoke
 The Dukes step approaching a light echo woke
 Say I do not receive till the evening Explain
 As she glanced at Lord Alfred she added again
 I have business of private importance
 There came
 Oer Lord Alfred at once at the sound of that name
 An invincible sense of vexation He turnd
 To Lucile and he fancied he faintly discernd
 On her face an indefinite look of confusion
 On his mind instantaneously flashd the conclusion
 That his presence had caused it
 He said with a sneer
 Which he could not repress Let not ME interfere
 With the claims on your time lady when you are free
 From more pleasant engagements allow me to see
 And to wait on you later
 The words were not said
 Ere he wishd to recall them He bitterly read
 The mistake he had made in Luciles flashing eye
 Inclining her head as in haughty reply
 More reproachful perchance than all utterd rebuke
 She said merely resuming her seat Tell the Duke
 He may enter
 And vexd with his own words and hers
 Alfred Vargrave bowd low to Lucile de Nevers
 Passd the casement and enterd the garden Before
 His shadow was fled the Duke stood at the door


 XVIII


 When left to his thoughts in the garden alone
 Alfred Vargrave stood strange to himself With dull tone
 Of importance through cities of rose and carnation
 Went the bee on his business from station to station
 The minute mirth of summer was shrill all around
 Its incessant small voices like stings seemd to sound
 On his sore angry sense He stood grieving the hot
 Solid sun with his shadow nor stirrd from the spot
 The last look of Lucile still bewilderd perplexd
 And reproachd him The Dukes visit goaded and vexd
 He had not yet given the letters Again
 He must visit Lucile He resolved to remain
 Where he was till the Duke went In short he would stay
 Were it only to know when the Duke went away
 But just as he formd this resolve he perceived
 Approaching towards him between the thickleaved
 And luxuriant laurels Lucile and the Duke
 Thus surprised his first thought was to seek for some nook
 Whence he might unobserved from the garden retreat
 They had not yet seen him The sound of their feet
 And their voices had warnd him in time They were walking
 Towards him The Duke a true Frenchman was talking
 With the action of Talma He saw at a glance
 That they barrd the sole path to the gateway No chance
 Of escape save in instant concealment Deepdippd
 In thick foliage an arbor stood near In he slippd
 Saved from sight as in front of that ambush they passd
 Still conversing Beneath a laburnum at last
 They paused and sat down on a bench in the shade
 So close that he could not but hear what they said


 XIX


 LUCILE

 Duke I scarcely conceive

 LUVOIS

 Ah forgive I desired
 So deeply to see you today You retired
 So early last night from the ball this whole week
 I have seen you pale silent preoccupied speak
 Speak Lucile and forgive me I know that I am
 A rash foolbut I love you I love you Madame
 More than language can say Do not deem O Lucile
 That the love I no longer have strength to conceal
 Is a passing caprice It is strange to my nature
 It has made me unknown to myself a new creature
 I implore you to sanction and save the new life
 Which I lay at your feet with this prayerBe my wife
 Stoop and raise me
 Lord Alfred could scarcely restrain
 The sudden acute pang of anger and pain
 With which he had heard this As though to some wind
 The leaves of the hushd windless laurels behind
 The two thus in converse were suddenly stirrd
 The sound half betrayed him They started He heard
 The low voice of Lucile but so faint was its tone
 That her answer escaped him
 Luvois hurried on
 As though in remonstrance with what had been spoken
 Nay I know it Lucile but your heart was not broken
 By the trial in which all its fibres were proved
 Love perchance you mistrust yet you need to be loved
 You mistake your own feelings I fear you mistake
 What so ill I interpret those feelings which make
 Words like these vague and feeble Whatever your heart
 May have sufferd of yore this can only impart
 A pity profound to the love which I feel
 Hush hush I know all Tell me nothing Lucile
 You know all Duke she said well then know that in truth
 I have learnd from the rude lesson taught to my youth
 From my own heart to shelter my life to mistrust
 The heart of another We are what we must
 And not what we would be I know that one hour
 Assures not another The will and the power
 Are diverse
 O madam he answerd you fence
 With a feeling you know to be true and intense
 Tis not MY life Lucile that I plead for alone
 If your nature I know tis no less for your own
 That nature will prey on itself it was made
 To influence others Consider he said
 That genius craves powerwhat scope for it here
 Gifts less noble to ME give command of that sphere
 In which genius IS power Such gifts you despise
 But you do not disdain what such gifts realize
 I offer you Lady a name not unknown
 A fortune which worthless without you is grown
 All my life at your feet I lay downat your feet
 A heart which for you and you only can beat

 LUCILE

 That heart Duke that lifeI respect both The name
 And position you offer and all that you claim
 In behalf of their nobler employment I feel
 To deserve what in turn I now ask you

 LUVOIS

 Lucile

 LUCILE

 I ask you to leave me

 LUVOIS

 You do not reject

 LUCILE

 I ask you to leave me the time to reflect

 LUVOIS

 You ask me

 LUCILE

 The time to reflect

 LUVOIS

 SayOne word
 May I hope
 The reply of Lucile was not heard
 By Lord Alfred for just then she rose and moved on
 The Duke bowd his lips oer her hand and was gone


 XX


 Not a sound save the birds in the bushes And when
 Alfred Vargrave reeld forth to the sunlight again
 He just saw the white robe of the woman recede
 As she entered the house
 Scarcely conscious indeed
 Of his steps he too followd and enterd


 XXI


 He enterd
 Unnoticed Lucile never stirrd so concentred
 And wholly absorbd in her thoughts she appeard
 Her back to the window was turnd As he neard
 The sofa her face from the glass was reflected
 Her dark eyes were fixd on the ground Pale dejected
 And lost in profound meditation she seemd
 Softly silently over her droopd shoulders streamd
 The afternoon sunlight The cry of alarm
 And surprise which escaped her as now on her arm
 Alfred Vargrave let fall a hand icily cold
 And clammy as death all too cruelly told
 How far he had been from her thoughts


 XXII


 All his cheek
 Was disturbd with the effort it cost him to speak
 It was not my fault I have heard all he said
 Now the lettersand farewell Lucile When you wed
 May
 The sentence broke short like a weapon that snaps
 When the weight of a man is upon it
 Perhaps
 Said Lucile her sole answer reveald in the flush
 Of quick color which up to her brow seemd to rush
 In reply to those few broken words this farewell
 Is our last Alfred Vargrave in life Who can tell
 Let us part without bitterness Here are your letters
 Be assured I retain you no more in my fetters
 She laughed as she said this a little sad laugh
 And stretched out her hand with the letters And half
 Wroth to feel his wrath rise and unable to trust
 His own powers of restraint in his bosom he thrust
 The packet she gave with a short angry sigh
 Bowd his head and departed without a reply


 XXIII


 And Lucile was alone And the men of the world
 Were gone back to the world And the worlds self was furld
 Far away from the heart of the woman Her hand
 Droopd and from it unloosed from their frail silken band
 Fell those early loveletters strewn scatterd and shed
 At her feetlifes lost blossoms Dejected her head
 On her bosom was bowd Her gaze vaguely strayd oer
 Those strewn records of passionate moments no more
 From each page to her sight leapt some words that belied
 The composure with which she that day had denied
 Every claim on her heart to those poor perishd years
 They avenged themselves now and she burst into tears

 LETTER FROM COUSIN JOHN TO COUSIN ALFRED

 BIGORRE THURSDAY
 Time up you rascal Come back or be hangd
 Matilda grows peevish Her mother harangued
 For a whole hour this morning about you The deuce
 What on earth can I say to younothings of use
 And the blame of the whole of your shocking behavior
 Falls on ME sir Come backdo you hearor I leave your
 Affairs and abjure you forever Come back
 To your anxious betrothd and perplexed
 COUSIN JACK


 II


 Alfred needed in truth no entreaties from John
 To increase his impatience to fly from Luchon
 All the place was now fraught with sensations of pain
 Which whilst in it he strove to escape from in vain
 A wild instinct warnd him to fly from a place
 Where he felt that some fatal event swift of pace
 Was approaching his life In despite his endeavor
 To think of Matilda her image forever
 Was effaced from his fancy by that of Lucile
 From the ground which he stood on he felt himself reel
 Scared alarmd by those feelings to which on the day
 Just before all his heart had so soon given way
 When he caught with a strange sense of fear for assistance
 And what was till then the great fact in existence
 Twas a phantom he graspd


 III


 Having sent for his guide
 He orderd his horse and determind to ride
 Back forthwith to Bigorre
 Then the guide who well knew
 Every haunt of those hills said the wild lake of Oo
 Lay a league from Luchon and suggested a track
 By the lake to Bigorre which transversing the back
 Of the mountain avoided a circuit between
 Two long valleys and thinking Perchance change of scene
 May create change of thought Alfred Vargrave agreed
 Mounted horse and set forth to Bigorre at full speed


 IV


 His guide rode beside him
 The king of the guides
 The gallant Bernard ever boldly he rides
 Ever gayly he sings For to him from of old
 The hills have confided their secrets and told
 Where the white partridge lies and the cock o the woods
 Where the izard flits fine through the cold solitudes
 Where the bear lurks perdu and the lynx on his prey
 At nightfall descends when the mountains are gray
 Where the sassafras blooms and the bluebell is born
 And the wild rhododendron first reddens at morn
 Where the source of the waters is fine as a thread
 How the storm on the wild Maladetta is spread
 Where the thunder is hoarded the snows lie asleep
 Whence the torrents are fed and the cataracts leap
 And familiarly known in the hamlets the vales
 Have whisperd to him all their thousand lovetales
 He has laughd with the girls he has leapd with the boys
 Ever blithe ever bold ever boon he enjoys
 An existence untroubled by envy or strife
 While he feeds on the dews and the juices of life
 And so lightly he sings and so gayly he rides
 For BERNARD LE SAUTEUR is the king of all guides


 V


 But Bernard found that day neither song not lovetale
 Nor adventure nor laughter nor legend avail
 To arouse from his deep and profound revery
 Him that silent beside him rode fast as could be


 VI


 Ascending the mountain they slackend their pace
 And the marvellous prospect each moment changed face
 The breezy and pure inspirations of morn
 Breathed about them The scarpd ravaged mountains all worn
 By the torrents whose course they watchd faintly meander
 Were alive with the diamonded shy salamander
 They paused oer the bosom of purple abysses
 And wound through a region of green wildernesses
 The waters went whirling above and around
 The forests hung heapd in their shadows profound
 Here the Larboust and there Aventin Castellon
 Which the Demon of Tempest descending upon
 Had wasted with fire and the peaceful Cazeaux
 They markd and far down in the sunshine below
 Half dippd in a valley of airiest blue
 The white happy homes of the valley of Oo
 Where the age is yet golden
 And high overhead
 The wrecks of the combat of Titans were spread
 Red granite and quartz in the alchemic sun
 Fused their splendors of crimson and crystal in one
 And deep in the moss gleamd the delicate shells
 And the dew lingerd fresh in the heavy harebells
 The large violet burnd the campanula blue
 And Autumns own flower the saffron peerd through
 The redberried brambles and thick sassafras
 And fragrant with thyme was the delicate grass
 And high up and higher and highest of all
 The secular phantom of snow
 Oer the wall
 Of a gray sunless glen gaping drowsy below
 That aerial spectre reveald in the glow
 Of the great golden dawn hovers faint on the eye
 And appears to grow in and grow out of the sky
 And plays with the fancy and baffles the sight
 Only reachd by the vast rosy ripple of light
 And the cool star of eve the Imperial Thing
 Half unreal like some mythological king
 That dominates all in a fable of old
 Takes command of a valley as fair to behold
 As aught in old fables and seen or unseen
 Dwells aloof over all in the vast and serene
 Sacred sky where the footsteps of spirits are furld
 Mid the clouds beyond which spreads the infinite world
 Of mans last aspirations unfathomd untrod
 Save by Even and Morn and the angels of God


 VII


 Meanwhile as they journeyd that serpentine road
 Now abruptly reversed unexpectedly showd
 A gay cavalcade some few feet in advance
 Alfred Vargraves heart beat for he saw at a glance
 The slight form of Lucile in the midst His next look
 Showd him joyously ambling beside her the Duke
 The rest of the troop which had thus caught his ken
 He knew not nor noticed them women and men
 They were laughing and talking together Soon after
 His sudden appearance suspended their laughter


 VIII


 You here I imagined you far on your way
 To Bigorre said Lucile What has caused you to stay
 I AM on my way to Bigorre he replied
 But since MY way would seem to be YOURS let me ride
 For one moment beside you And then with a stoop
 At her ear and forgive me


 IX


 By this time the troop
 Had regatherd its numbers
 Lucile was as pale
 As the cloud neath their feet on its way to the vale
 The Duke had observed it nor quitted her side
 For even one moment the whole of the ride
 Alfred smiled as he thought he is jealous of her
 And the thought of this jealousy added a spur
 To his firm resolution and effort to please
 He talkd much was witty and quite at his ease


 X


 After noontide the clouds which had traversed the east
 Half the day gatherd closer and rose and increased
 The air changed and chilld As though out of the ground
 There ran up the trees a confused hissing sound
 And the wind rose The guides sniffd like chamois the air
 And lookd at each other and halted and there
 Unbuckled the cloaks from the saddles The white
 Aspens rustled and turnd up their frail leaves in fright
 All announced the approach of the tempest
 Erelong
 Thick darkness descended the mountains among
 And a vivid vindictive and serpentine flash
 Gored the darkness and shore it across with a gash
 The rain fell in large heavy drops And anon
 Broke the thunder
 The horses took fright every one
 The Dukes in a moment was far out of sight
 The guides whoopd The band was obliged to alight
 And dispersed up the perilous pathway walkd blind
 To the darkness before from the darkness behind


 XI


 And the Storm is abroad in the mountains
 He fills
 The crouchd hollows and all the oracular hills
 With dread voices of power A roused million or more
 Of wild echoes reluctantly rise from their hoar
 Immemorial ambush and roll in the wake
 Of the cloud whose reflection leaves vivid the lake
 And the wind that wild robber for plunder descends
 From invisible lands oer those black mountain ends
 He howls as he hounds down his prey and his lash
 Tears the hair of the timorous wan mountainash
 That clings to the rocks with her garments all torn
 Like a woman in fear then he blows his hoarse horn
 And is off the fierce guide of destruction and terror
 Up the desolate heights mid an intricate error
 Of mountain and mist


 XII


 There is war in the skies
 Lo the blackwinged legions of tempest arise
 Oer those sharp splinterd rocks that are gleaming below
 In the soft light so fair and so fatal as though
 Some seraph burnd through them the thunderbolt searching
 Which the black cloud unbosomd just now Lo the lurching
 And shivering pinetrees like phantoms that seem
 To waver above in the dark and yon stream
 How it hurries and roars on its way to the white
 And paralyzed lake there appalld at the sight
 of the things seen in heaven


 XIII


 Through the darkness and awe
 That had gatherd around him Lord Alfred now saw
 Reveald in the fierce and evanishing glare
 Of the lightning that momently pulsed through the air
 A woman alone on a shelf of the hill
 With her cheek coldly proppd on her handand as still
 As the rock that she sat on which beetled above
 The black lake beneath her
 All terror all love
 Added speed to the instinct with which he rushd on
 For one moment the blue lightning swathed the whole stone
 In its lurid embrace like the sleek dazzling snake
 That encircles a sorceress charmd for her sake
 And lulld by her loveliness fawning it playd
 And caressingly twined round the feet and the head
 Of the woman who sat there undaunted and calm
 As the soul of that solitude listing the psalm
 Of the plangent and laboring tempests roll slow
 From the caldron of midnight and vapor below
 Next moment from bastion to bastion all round
 Of the siegecircled mountains there tumbled the sound
 Of the battering thunders indefinite peal
 And Lord Alfred had sprung to the feet of Lucile


 XIV


 She started Once more with its flickering wand
 The lightning approachd her In terror her hand
 Alfred Vargrave had seized within his and he felt
 The light fingers that coldly and lingeringly dwelt
 In the grasp of his own tremble faintly
 See see
 Where the whirlwind hath stricken and strangled yon tree
 She exclaimd like the passion that brings on its breath
 To the being it embraces destruction and death
 Alfred Vargrave the lightning is round you
 Lucile
 I hearI seenaught but yourself I can feel
 Nothing here but your presence My pride fights in vain
 With the truth that leaps from me We two meet again
 Neath yon terrible heaven that is watching above
 To avenge if I lie when I swear that I love
 And beneath yonder terrible heaven at your feet
 I humble my head and my heart I entreat
 Your pardon Lucile for the pastI implore
 For the future your mercyimplore it with more
 Of passion than prayer ever breathed By the power
 Which invisibly touches us both in this hour
 By the rights I have oer you Lucile I demand
 The rights said Lucile and drew from him her hand

 Yes the rights for what greater to man may belong
 Than the right to repair in the future the wrong
 To the past and the wrong I have done you of yore
 Hath bequeathd to me all the sad right to restore
 To retrieve to amend I who injured your life
 Urge the right to repair it Lucile Be my wife
 My guide my good angel my all upon earth
 And accept for the sake of what yet may give worth
 To my life its contrition


 XV


 He paused for there came
 Oer the cheek of Lucile a swift flush like the flame
 That illumined at moments the darkness oerhead
 With a voice faint and marrd by emotion she said
 And your pledge to another


 XVI


 Hush hush he exclaimd
 My honor will live where my love lives unshamed
 Twere poor honor indeed to another to give
 That life of which YOU keep the heart Could I live
 In the light of those young eyes suppressing a lie
 Alas no YOUR hand holds my whole destiny
 I can never recall what my lips have avowd
 In your love lies whatever can render me proud
 For the great crime of all my existence hath been
 To have known you in vain And the duty best seen
 And most hallowdthe duty most sacred and sweet
 Is that which hath led me Lucile to your feet
 O speak and restore me the blessing I lost
 When I lost youmy pearl of all pearls beyond cost
 And restore to your own life its youth and restore
 The vision the rapture the passion of yore
 Ere our brows had been dimmd in the dust of the world
 When our souls their white wings yet exulting unfurld
 For your eyes rest no more on the unquiet man
 The wild star of whose course its pale orbit outran
 Whom the formless indefinite future of youth
 With its lying allurements distracted In truth
 I have wearily wanderd the world and I feel
 That the least of your lovely regards O Lucile
 Is worth all the world can afford and the dream
 Which though followd forever forever doth seem
 As fleeting and distant and dim as of yore
 When it brooded in twilight at dawn on the shore
 Of lifes untraversed ocean I know the sole path
 To repose which my desolate destiny hath
 Is the path by whose course to your feet I return
 And who else O Lucile will so truly discern
 And so deeply revere all the passionate strength
 The sublimity in you as he whom at length
 These have saved from himself for the truth they reveal
 To his worship


 XVII


 She spoke not but Alfred could feel
 The light hand and arm that upon him reposed
 Thrill and tremble Those dark eyes of hers were half closed
 But under their languid mysterious fringe
 A passionate softness was beaming One tinge
 Of faint inward fire flushd transparently through
 The delicate pallid and pure olive hue
 Of the cheek half averted and droopd The rich bosom
 Heaved as when in the heart of a ruffled roseblossom
 A bee is imprisond and struggles


 XVIII


 Meanwhile
 The sun in his setting sent up the last smile
 Of his power to baffle the storm And behold
 Oer the mountains embattled his armies all gold
 Rose and rested while far up the dim airy crags
 Its artillery silenced its banners in rags
 The rear of the tempest its sullen retreat
 Drew off slowly receding in silence to meet
 The powers of the night which now gathering afar
 Had already sent forward one bright signal star
 The curls of her soft and luxuriant hair
 From the dark ridinghat which Lucile used to wear
 Had escaped and Lord Alfred now coverd with kisses
 The redolent warmth of those long falling tresses
 Neither he nor Lucile felt the rain which not yet
 Had ceased falling around them when splashd drenchd and wet
 The Duc de Luvois down the rough mountain course
 Approached them as fast as the road and his horse
 Which was limping would suffer The beast had just now
 Lost his footing and over the perilous brow
 Of the stormhaunted mountain his master had thrown
 But the Duke who was agile had leapd to a stone
 And the horse being bred to the instinct which fills
 The breast of the wild mountaineer in these hills
 Had scrambled again to his feet and now master
 And horse bore about them the signs of disaster
 As they heavily footed their way through the mist
 The horse with his shoulder the Duke with his wrist
 Bruised and bleeding


 XIX


 If ever your feet like my own
 O reader have traversed these mountains alone
 Have you felt your identity shrink and contract
 At the sound of the distant and dim cataract
 In the presence of natures immensities Say
 Have you hung oer the torrent bedewd with its spray
 And leaving the rockway contorted and rolld
 Like a huge couchant Typhon fold heaped over fold
 Trackd the summits from which every step that you tread
 Rolls the loose stones with thunder below to the bed
 Of invisible waters whose mistical sound
 Fills with awful suggestions the dizzy profound
 And laboring onwards at last through a break
 In the walls of the world burst at once on the lake
 If you have this description I might have withheld
 You remember how strangely your bosom has swelld
 At the vision reveald On the overworkd soil
 Of this planet enjoyment is sharpend by toil
 And one seems by the pain of ascending the height
 To have conquerd a claim of that wonderful sight


 XX


 Hail virginal daughter of cold Espingo
 Hail Naiad whose realm is the cloud and the snow
 For oer thee the angels have whitend their wings
 And the thirst of the seraphs is quenchd at thy springs
 What hand hath in heaven upheld thine expanse
 When the breath of creation first fashiond fair France
 Did the Spirit of Ill in his downthrow appalling
 Bruise the world and thus hollow thy basin while falling
 Ere the mammoth was born hath some monster unnamed
 The base of thy mountainous pedestal framed
 And later when Power to Beauty was wed
 Did some delicate fairy embroider thy bed
 With the fragile valerian and wild columbine


 XXI


 But thy secret thou keepest and I will keep mine
 For once gazing on thee it flashd on my soul
 All that secret I saw in a vision the whole
 Vast design of the ages what was and shall be
 Hands unseen raised the veil of a great mystery
 For one moment I saw and I heard and my heart
 Bore witness within me to infinite art
 In infinite power proving infinite love
 Caught the great choral chant markd the dread pageant move
 The divine Whence and Whither of life But O daughter
 Of Oo not more safe in the deep silent water
 Is thy secret than mine in my heart Even so
 What I then saw and heard the world never shall know


 XXII


 The dimness of eve oer the valleys had closed
 The rain had ceased falling the mountains reposed
 The stars had enkindled in luminous courses
 Their slowsliding lamps when remounting their horses
 The riders retraversed that mighty serration
 Of rockwork Thus left to its own desolation
 The lake from whose glimmering limits the last
 Transient pomp of the pageants of sunset had passd
 Drew into its bosom the darkness and only
 Admitted within it one imagea lonely
 And tremulous phantom of flickering light
 That followd the mystical moon through the night


 XXIII


 It was late when oer Luchon at last they descended
 To her chalet in silence Lord Alfred attended
 Lucile As they parted she whispered him low
 You have made to me Alfred an offer I know
 All the worth of believe me I cannot reply
 Without time for reflection Good nightnot good by
 Alas tis the very same answer you made
 To the Duc de Luvois but a day since he said
 No Alfred the very same no she replied
 Her voice shook If you love me obey me Abide
 My answer tomorrow

 Alas Cousin Jack
 You Cassandra in breeches and boots turn your back
 To the ruins of Troy Prophet seek not for glory
 Amongst thine own people
 I follow my story




CANTO V


 I


 Upforth again PegasusManys the slip
 Hath the proverb well said twixt the cup and the lip
 How blest should we be have I often conceived
 Had we really achieved what we nearly achieved
 We but catch at the skirts of the thing we would be
 And fall back on the lap of a false destiny
 So it will be so has been since this world began
 And the happiest noblest and best part of man
 Is the part which he never hath fully playd out
 For the first and last word in lifes volume is
 Doubt
 The face of the most fair to our vision allowd
 Is the face we encounter and lose in the crowd
 The thought that most thrills our existence is one
 Which before we can frame it in language is gone
 O Horace the rustic still rests by the river
 But the river flows on and flows past him forever
 Who can sit down and say What I will be I will
 Who stand up and affirm What I was I am still
 Who is that must not if questiond say
 What
 I would have remaind or become I am not
 We are ever behind or beyond or beside
 Our intrinsic existence Forever at hide
 And seek with our souls Not in Hades alone
 Doth Sisyphus roll ever frustrate the stone
 Do the Danaids ply ever vainly the sieve
 Tasks as futile does earth to its denizens give
 Yet theres none so unhappy but what he hath been
 Just about to be happy at some time I ween
 And none so beguiled and defrauded by chance
 But what once in his life some minute circumstance
 Would have fully sufficed to secure him the bliss
 Which missing it then he forever must miss
 And to most of us ere we go down to the grave
 Life relenting accords the good gift we would have
 But as though by some strange imperfection in fate
 The good gift when it comes comes a moment too late
 The Futures great veil our breath fitfully flaps
 And behind it broods ever the mighty Perhaps
 Yet theres many a slip twixt the cup and the lip
 But while oer the brim of lifes beaker I dip
 Though the cup may next moment be shatterd the wine
 Spilt one deep health Ill pledge and that health shall be thine
 O being of beauty and bliss seen and known
 In the deeps of my soul and possessd there alone
 My days know thee not and my lips name thee never
 Thy place in my poor life is vacant forever
 We have met we have parted No more is recorded
 In my annals on earth This alone was afforded
 To the man whom men know me or deem me to be
 But far down in the depth of my lifes mystery
 Like the siren that under the deep ocean dwells
 Whom the wind as it wails and the wave as it swells
 Cannot stir in the calm of her coralline halls
 Mid the worlds adamantine and dim pedestals
 At whose feet sit the sylphs and sea fairies for whom
 The almondine glimmers the soft samphires bloom
 Thou abidest and reignest forever O Queen
 Of that better world which thou swayest unseen
 My one perfect mistress my all things in all
 Thee by no vulgar name known to men do I call
 For the Seraphs have named thee to me in my sleep
 And that name is a secret I sacredly keep
 But wherever this nature of mine is most fair
 And its thoughts are the purestbelovd thou art there
 And whatever is noblest in aught that I do
 Is done to exalt and to worship thee too
 The world gave thee not to me no and the world
 Cannot take thee away from me now I have furld
 The wings of my spirit above thy bright head
 At thy feet are my souls immortalities spread
 Thou mightest have been to me much Thou art more
 And in silence I worship in darkness adore
 If life be not that which without us we find
 Chance accident merelybut rather the mind
 And the soul which within us surviveth these things
 If our real existence have truly its springs
 Less in that which we do than in that which we feel
 Not in vain do I worship not hopeless I kneel
 For then though I name thee not mistress or wife
 Thou art mineand mine onlyO life of my life
 And though manys the slip twixt the cup and the lip
 Yet while oer the brim of lifes beaker I dip
 While theres life on the lip while theres warmth in the wine
 One deep health Ill pledge and that health shall be thine


 II


 This world on whose peaceable breast we repose
 Unconvulsed by alarm once confused in the throes
 Of a tumult divine sea and land moist and dry
 And in fiery fusion commixd earth and sky
 Time coold it and calmd it and taught it to go
 The round of its orbit in peace long ago
 The wind changeth and whirleth continually
 All the rivers run down and run into the sea
 The wind whirleth about and is presently stilld
 All the rivers run down yet the sea is not filld
 The sun goeth forth from his chambers the sun
 Ariseth and lo he descendeth anon
 All returns to its place Use and Habit are powers
 Far stronger than Passion in this world of ours
 The great laws of life readjust their infraction
 And to every emotion appoint a reaction


 III


 Alfred Vargrave had time after leaving Lucile
 To review the rash step he had taken and feel
 What the world would have calld his erroneous position
 Thought obtruded its claim and enforced recognition
 Like a creditor who when the gloss is worn out
 On the coat which we once wore with pleasure no doubt
 Sends us in his account for the garment we bought
 Evry spendthrift to passion is debtor to thought


 IV


 He felt ill at ease with himself He could feel
 Little doubt what the answer would be from Lucile
 Her eyes when they partedher voice when they met
 Still enraptured his heart which they haunted And yet
 Though exulting he deemd himself loved where he loved
 Through his mind a vague selfaccusation there moved
 Oer his fancy when fancy was fairest would rise
 The infantine face of Matilda with eyes
 So sad so reproachful so cruelly kind
 That his heart faild within him In vain did he find
 A thousand just reasons for what he had done
 The vision that troubled him would not be gone
 In vain did he say to himself and with truth
 Matilda has beauty and fortune and youth
 And her heart is too young to have deeply involved
 All its hopes in the tie which must now be dissolved
 Twere a false sense of honor in me to suppress
 The sad truth which I owe it to her to confess
 And what reason have I to presume this poor life
 Of my own with its languid and frivolous strife
 And without what alone might endear it to her
 Were a boon all so precious indeed to confer
 Its withdrawal can wrong her
 It is not as though
 I were bound to some poor village maiden I know
 Unto whose simple heart mine were all upon earth
 Or to whose simple fortunes mine own could give worth
 Matilda in all the worlds gifts will not miss
 Aught that I could procure her Tis best as it is


 V


 In vain did he say to himself When I came
 To this fatal spot I had nothing to blame
 Or reproach myself for in the thoughts of my heart
 I could not foresee that its pulses would start
 Into such strange emotion on seeing once more
 A woman I left with indifference before
 I believed and with honest conviction believed
 In my love for Matilda I never conceived
 That another could shake it I deemd I had done
 With the wild heart of youth and looked hopefully on
 To the soberer manhood the worthier life
 Which I sought in the love that I vowd to my wife
 Poor child she shall learn the whole truth She shall know
 What I knew not myself but a few days ago
 The world will console herher pride will support
 Her youth will renew its emotions In short
 There is nothing in me that Matilda will miss
 When once we have parted Tis best as it is


 VI


 But in vain did he reason and argue Alas
 He yet felt unconvinced that TWAS best as it was
 Out of reach of all reason forever would rise
 That infantine face of Matilda with eyes
 So sad so reproachful so cruelly kind
 That they harrowd his heart and distracted his mind


 VII


 And then when he turned from these thoughts to Lucile
 Though his heart rose enraptured he could not but feel
 A vague sense of awe of her nature Behind
 All the beauty of heart and the graces of mind
 Which he saw and revered in her something unknown
 And unseen in that nature still troubled his own
 He felt that Lucile penetrated and prized
 Whatever was noblest and best though disguised
 In himself but he did not feel sure that he knew
 Or completely possessd what half hidden from view
 Remained lofty and lonely in HER
 Then her life
 So untamed and so free would she yield as a wife
 Independence long claimed as a woman Her name
 So linkd by the world with that spurious fame
 Which the beauty and wit of a woman assert
 In some measure alas to her own loss and hurt
 In the serious thoughts of a man This reflection
 Oer the love which he felt cast a shade of dejection
 From which he forever escaped to the thought
 Doubt could reach not I love her and all else is naught


 VIII


 His hand trembled strangely in breaking the seal
 Of the letter which reachd him at last from Lucile
 At the sight of the very first words that he read
 That letter droppd down from his hand like the dead
 Leaf in autumn that falling leaves naked and bare
 A desolate tree in a wide wintry air
 He passd his hand hurriedly over his eyes
 Bewilderd incredulous Angry surprise
 And dismay in one sharp moan broke from him Anon
 He picked up the page and read rapidly on


 IX


 THE COMTESSE DE NEVERS TO LORD ALFRED VARGRAVE

 No Alfred
 If over the present when last
 We two met rose the glamour and mist of the past
 It hath now rolled away and our two paths are plain
 And those two paths divide us
 That hand which again
 Mine one moment has claspd as the hand of a brother
 That hand and your honor are pledged to another
 Forgive Alfred Vargrave forgive me if yet
 For that moment now past I have made you forget
 What was due to yourself and that other one Yes
 Mine the fault and be mine the repentance Not less
 In now owning this fault Alfred let me own too
 I foresaw not the sorrow involved in it
 True
 That meeting which hath been so fatal I sought
 I alone But oh deem not it was with the thought
 Of your heart to regain or the past to rewaken
 No believe me it was with the firm and unshaken
 Conviction at least that our meeting would be
 Without peril to YOU although haply to me
 The salvation of all my existence
 I own
 When the rumor first reachd me which lightly made known
 To the world your engagement my heart and my mind
 Sufferd torture intense It was cruel to find
 That so much of the life of my life half unknown
 To myself had been silently settled on one
 Upon whom but to think it would soon be a crime
 Then I said to myself From the thraldom which time
 Hath not weakend there rests but one hope of escape
 That image which Fancy seems ever to shape
 From the solitude left round the ruins of yore
 Is a phantom The Being I loved is no more
 What I hear in the silence and see in the lone
 Void of life is the young hero born of my own
 Perishd youth and his image serene and sublime
 In my heart rests unconscious of change and of time
 Could I see it but once more as time and as change
 Have made it a thing unfamiliar and strange
 See indeed that the Being I loved in my youth
 Is no more and what rests now is only in truth
 The hard pupil of life and the world then oh then
 I should wake from a dream and my life be again
 Reconciled to the world and released from regret
 Take the lot fate accords to my choice
 So we met
 But the danger I did not foresee has occurrd
 The danger alas to yourself I have errd
 But happy for both that this error hath been
 Discoverd as soon as the danger was seen
 We meet Alfred Vargrave no more I indeed
 Shall be far from Luchon when this letter you read
 My course is decided my path I discern
 Doubt is over my future is fixd now
 Return
 O return to the young living love Whence alas
 If one moment you wanderd think only it was
 More deeply to bury the past love
 And oh
 Believe Alfred Vargrave that I where I go
 On my far distant pathway through life shall rejoice
 To treasure in memory all that your voice
 Has avowd to me all in which others have clothed
 To my fancy with beauty and worth your betrothed
 In the fair morning light in the orient dew
 Of that young life now yours can you fail to renew
 All the noble and pure aspirations the truth
 The freshness the faith of your own earnest youth
 Yes YOU will be happy I too in the bliss
 I foresee for you I shall be happy And this
 Proves me worthy your friendship And solet it prove
 That I cannotI do not respond to your love
 Yes indeed be convinced that I could not no no
 Never never have renderd you happy And so
 Rest assured that if false to the vows you have plighted
 You would have endured when the first brief excited
 Emotion was oer not alone the remorse
 Of honor but also to render it worse
 Disappointed affection
 Yes Alfred you start
 But think if the world was too much in your heart
 And too little in mine when we parted ten years
 Ere this last fatal meeting that time ay and tears
 Have but deepend the old demarcations which then
 Placed our natures asunder and we two again
 As we then were would still have been strangely at strife
 In that selfindependence which is to my life
 Its necessity now as it once was its pride
 Had our course through the world been henceforth side by side
 I should have revolted forever and shockd
 Your respect for the worlds plausibilities mockd
 Without meaning to do so and outraged all those
 Social creeds which you live by
 Oh do not suppose
 That I blame you Perhaps it is you that are right
 Best then all as it is
 Deem these words lifes Goodnight
 To the hope of a moment no more If there fell
 Any tear on this page twas a friends
 So farewell
 To the pastand to you Alfred Vargrave
 LUCILE


 X


 So ended that letter
 The room seemd to reel
 Round and round in the mist that was scorching his eyes
 With a fiery dew Grief resentment surprise
 Half chocked him each word he had read as it smote
 Down some hope rose and grasped like a hand at his throat
 To stifle and strangle him
 Gasping already
 For relief from himself with a footstep unsteady
 He passd from his chamber He felt both oppressd
 And excited The letter he thrust in his breast
 And in search of fresh air and of solitude passd
 The long limetrees of Luchon His footsteps at last
 Reachd a bare narrow heath by the skirts of a wood
 It was sombre and silent and suited his mood
 By a mineral spring long unused now unknown
 Stood a small ruind abbey He reachd it sat down
 On a fragment of stone mid the wild weed and thistle
 And read over again that perplexing epistle


 XI


 In rereading that letter there rolld from his mind
 The raw mist of resentment which first made him blind
 To the pathos breathd through it Tears rose in his eyes
 And a hope sweet and strange in his heart seemd to rise
 The truth which he saw not the first time he read
 That letter he now sawthat each word betrayd
 The love which the writer had sought to conceal
 His love was received not he could not but feel
 For one reason alonethat his love was not free
 True free yet he was not but could he not be
 Free erelong free as air to revoke that farewell
 And to sanction his own hopes he had but to tell
 The truth to Matilda and she were the first
 To release him he had but to wait at the worst
 Matildas relations would probably snatch
 Any pretext with pleasure to break off a match
 In which they had yielded alone at the whim
 Of their spoild child a languid approval to him
 She herself careless child was her love for him aught
 Save the first joyous fancy succeeding the thought
 She last gave to her doll was she able to feel
 Such a love as the love he divined in Lucile
 He would seek her obtain his release and oh then
 He had but to fly to Lucile and again
 Claim the love which his heart would be free to command
 But to press on Lucile any claim to her hand
 Or even to seek or to see her before
 He could say I am free free Lucile to implore
 That great blessing on life you alone can confer
 Twere dishonor in him twould be insult to her
 Thus still with the letter outspread on his knee
 He followd so fondly his own revery
 That he felt not the angry regard of a man
 Fixd upon him he saw not a face stern and wan
 Turnd towards him he heard not a footstep that passd
 And repassd the lone spot where he stood till at last
 A hoarse voice aroused him
 He lookd up and saw
 On the bare heath before him the Duc de Luvois


 XII


 With aggressive ironical tones and a look
 Of concentrated insolent challenge the Duke
 Addressd to Lord Alfred some sneering allusion
 To the doubtless sublime reveries his intrusion
 Had he feard interrupted Milord would do better
 He fancied however to fold up a letter
 The writing of which was too well known in fact
 His remark as he passd to have failed to attract


 XIII


 It was obvious to Alfred the Frenchman was bent
 Upon picking a quarrel and doubtless twas meant
 From HIM to provoke it by sneers such as these
 A moment sufficed his quick instinct to seize
 The position He felt that he could not expose
 His own name or Luciles or Matildas to those
 Idle tongues that would bring down upon him the ban
 Of the world if he now were to fight with this man
 And indeed when he lookd in the Dukes haggard face
 He was paind by the change there he could not but trace
 And he almost felt pity
 He therefore put by
 Each remark from the Duke with some careless reply
 And coldly but courteously waving away
 The illhumor the Duke seemd resolved to display
 Rose and turnd with a stern salutation aside


 XIV


 Then the Duke put himself in the path made one stride
 In advance raised a hand fixd upon him his eyes
 And said
 Hold Lord Alfred Away with disguise
 I will own that I sought you a moment ago
 To fix on you a quarrel I still can do so
 Upon any excuse I prefer to be frank
 I admit not a rival in fortune or rank
 To the hand of a woman whatever be hers
 Or her suitors I love the Comtesse de Nevers
 I believed ere you crossd me and still have the right
 To believe that she would have been mine To her sight
 You return and the woman is suddenly changed
 You step in between us her heart is estranged
 You who now are betrothed to another I know
 You whose name with Luciles nearly ten years ago
 Was coupled by ties which you broke you the man
 I reproachd on the day our acquaintance began
 You that left her so lightlyI cannot believe
 That you love as I love her nor can I conceive
 You indeed have the right so to love her
 Milord
 I will not thus tamely concede at your word
 What a few days ago I believed to be mine
 I shall yet persevere I shall yet be in fine
 A rival you dare not despise It is plain
 That to settle this contest there can but remain
 One wayneed I say what it is


 XV


 Not unmoved
 With regretful respect for the earnestness proved
 By the speech he had heard Alfred Vargrave replied
 In words which he trusted might yet turn aside
 The quarrel from which he felt bound to abstain
 And with stately urbanity strove to explain
 To the Duke that he too a fair rival at worst
 Had not been accepted


 XVI


 Accepted say first
 Are you free to have offerd
 Lord Alfred was mute


 XVII


 Ah you dare not reply cried the Duke Why dispute
 Why palter with me You are silent and why
 Because in your conscience you cannot deny
 Twas from vanity wanton and cruel withal
 And the wish an ascendancy lost to recall
 That you steppd in between me and her If milord
 You be really sincere I ask only one word
 Say at once you renounce her At once on my part
 I will ask your forgiveness with all truth of heart
 And there CAN be no quarrel between us Say on
 Lord Alfred grew galld and impatient This tone
 Roused a strong irritation he could not repress
 You have not the right sir he said and still less
 The power to make terms and conditions with me
 I refuse to reply


 XVIII


 As diviners may see
 Fates they cannot avert in some figure occult
 He foresaw in a moment each evil result
 Of the quarrel now imminent
 There face to face
 Mid the ruins and tombs of a longperishd race
 With for witness the stern Autumn Sky overhead
 And beneath them unnoticed the graves and the dead
 Those two men had met as it were on the ridge
 Of that perilous narrow invisible bridge
 Dividing the Past from the Future so small
 That if one should pass over the other must fall


 XIX


 On the ear at that moment the sound of a hoof
 Urged with speed sharply smote and from under the roof
 Of the forest in view where the skirts of it verged
 On the heath where they stood at full gallop emerged
 A horseman
 A guide he appeard by the sash
 Of red silk round the waist and the long leathern lash
 With a short wooden handle slung crosswise behind
 The short jacket the loose canvas trouser confined
 By the long boots the woollen capote and the rein
 A mere hempen cord on a curb
 Up the plain
 He wheeld his horse white with the foam on his flank
 Leapd the rivulet lightly turnd sharp from the bank
 And approaching the Duke raised his woollen capote
 Bowd low in the selle and deliverd a note


 XX


 The two stood astonishd The Duke with a gest
 Of apology turnd stretchd his hand and possessd
 Himself of the letter changed color and tore
 The page open and read
 Ere a moment was oer
 His whole aspect changed A light rose to his eyes
 And a smile to his lips While with startled surprise
 Lord Alfred yet watchd him he turnd on his heel
 And said gayly A pressing request from Lucile
 You are quite right Lord Alfred fair rivals at worst
 Our relative place may perchance be reversed
 You are not acceptednor free to propose
 I perchance am accepted already who knows
 I had warned you milord I should still persevere
 This letterbut stay you can read itlook here


 XXI


 It was now Alfreds turn to feel roused and enraged
 But Lucile to himself was not pledged or engaged
 By aught that could sanction resentment He said
 Not a word but turnd round took the letter and read

 THE COMTESSE DE NEVERS TO THE DUC DE LUVOIS


 SAINT SAVIOUR

 Your letter which followd me here makes me stay
 Till I see you again With no moments delay
 I entreat I conjure you by all that you feel
 Or profess to come to me directly
 LUCILE


 XXII


 Your letter He then had been writing to her
 Coldly shrugging his shoulders Lord Alfred said Sir
 Do not let me detain you
 The Duke smiled and bowd
 Placed the note in his bosom addressd half aloud
 A few words to the messenger Say your despatch
 Will be answerd ere nightfall then glanced at his watch
 And turnd back to the Baths


 XXIII


 Alfred Vargrave stood still
 Torn distracted in heart and divided in will
 He turnd to Luciles farewell letter to him
 And read over her words rising tears made them dim
 Doubt is over my future is fixd now they said
 My course is decided Her course what to wed
 With this insolent rival With that thought there shot
 Through his heart an acute jealous anguish But not
 Even thus could his clear worldly sense quite excuse
 Those strange words to the Duke She was free to refuse
 Himself free the Duke to accept it was true
 Even then though this eager and strange rendezvous
 How imprudent To some unfrequented lone inn
 And so late for the night was about to begin
 She companionless therehad she bidden that man
 A fear vague and formless and horrible ran
 Through his heart


 XXIV


 At that moment he lookd up and saw
 Riding fast through the forest the Duc de Luvois
 Who waved his hand to him and sped out of sight
 The day was descending He felt twould be night
 Ere that man reached Saint Saviour


 XXV


 He walkd on but not
 Back toward Luchon he walkd on but knew not in what
 Direction nor yet with what object indeed
 He was walking but still he walkd on without heed


 XXVI


 The day had been sullen but towards his decline
 The sun sent a stream of wild light up the pine
 Darkly denting the red light reveald at its back
 The old ruind abbey rose roofless and black
 The spring that yet oozed through the mosspaven floor
 Had suggested no doubt to the monks there of yore
 The sight of that refuge where back to its God
 How many a heart now at rest neath the sod
 Had borne from the world all the same wild unrest
 That now preyd on his own


 XXVII


 By the thoughts in his breast
 With varying impulse divided and torn
 He traversed the scant heath and reachd the forlorn
 Autumn woodland in which but a short while ago
 He had seen the Duke rapidly enter and so
 He too enterd The light waned around him and passd
 Into darkness The wrathful red Occident cast
 One glare of vindictive inquiry behind
 As the last light of day from the high wood declined
 And the great forest sighd its farewell to the beam
 And far off on the stillness the voice of the stream
 Fell faintly


 XXVIII


 O Nature how fair is thy face
 And how light is thy heart and how friendless thy grace
 Thou false mistress of man thou dost sport with him lightly
 In his hours of ease and enjoyment and brightly
 Dost thou smile to his smile to his joys thou inclinest
 But his sorrows thou knowest them not nor divinest
 While he woos thou art wanton thou lettest him love thee
 But thou art not his friend for his grief cannot move thee
 And at last when he sickens and dies what dost thou
 All as gay are thy garments as careless thy brow
 And thou laughest and toyest with any new comer
 Not a tear more for winter a smile less for summer
 Hast thou never an anguish to heave the heart under
 That fair breast of thine O thou feminine wonder
 For all thosethe young and the fair and the strong
 Who have loved thee and lived with thee gayly and long
 And who now on thy bosom lie dead and their deeds
 And their days are forgotten O hast thou no weeds
 And not one year of mourningone out of the many
 That deck thy new bridals forevernor any
 Regrets for thy lost loves conceald from the new
 O thou widow of earths generations Go to
 If the sea and the night wind know aught of these things
 They do not reveal it We are not thy kings




CANTO VI


 I


 The huntsman has ridden too far on the chase
 And eldrich and eerie and strange is the place
 The castle betokens a date long gone by
 He crosses the courtyard with curious eye
 He wanders from chamber to chamber and yet
 From strangeness to strangeness his footsteps are set
 And the whole place grows wilder and wilder and less
 Like aught seen before Each in obsolete dress
 Strange portraits regard him with looks of surprise
 Strange forms from the arras start forth to his eyes
 Strange epigraphs blazond burn out of the wall
 The spell of a wizard is over it all
 In her chamber enchanted the Princess is sleeping
 The sleep which for centuries she has been keeping
 If she smile in her sleep it must be to some lover
 Whose lost golden locks the long grasses now cover
 If she moan in her dream it must be to deplore
 Some grief which the world cares to hear of no more
 But how fair is her forehead how calm seems her cheek
 And how sweet must that voice be if once she would speak
 He looks and he loves her but knows he not he
 The clew to unravel this old mystery
 And he stoops to those shut lips The shapes on the wall
 The mute men in armor around him and all
 The weird figures frown as though striving to say
 Halt invade not the Past reckless child of Today
 And give not O madman the heart in thy breast
 To a phantom the soul of whose sense is possessd
 By an Age not thine own
 But unconscious is he
 And he heeds not the warning he cares not to see
 Aught but ONE form before him
 Rash wild words are oer
 And the vision is vanishd from sight evermore
 And the gray morning sees as it drearily moves
 Oer a land long deserted a madman that roves
 Through a ruin and seeks to recapture a dream
 Lost to life and its uses withdrawn from the scheme
 Of mans waking existence he wanders apart
 And this is an old fairytale of the heart
 It is told in all lands in a different tongue
 Told with tears by the old heard with smiles by the young
 And the tale to each heart unto which it is known
 Has a different sense It has puzzled my own


 II


 Eugene de Luvois was a man who in part
 From strong physical health and that vigor of heart
 Which physical health gives and partly perchance
 From a generous vanity native to France
 With the heart of a hunter whatever the quarry
 Pursued it too hotly impatient to tarry
 Or turn till he took it His trophies were trifles
 But trifler he was not When roseleaves it rifles
 No less than when oaktrees it ruins the wind
 Its pleasure pursues with impetuous mind
 Both Eugene de Luvois and Lord Alfred had been
 Men of pleasure but mens pleasant vices which seen
 Floating faint in the sunshine of Alfreds soft mood
 Seemd amiable foibles by Luvois pursued
 With impetuous passion seemed semiSatanic
 Half pleased you see brooks play with pebbles in panic
 You watch them whirld down by the torrent
 In truth
 To the sacred political creed of his youth
 The century which he was born to denied
 All realization Its generous pride
 To degenerate protest on all things was sunk
 Its principles each to a prejudice shrunk
 Down the path of a life that led nowhere he trod
 Where his whims were his guides and his will was his god
 And his pastime his purpose
 From boyhood possessd
 Of inherited wealth he had learned to invest
 Both his wealth and those passions wealth frees from the cage
 Which penury locks in each vice of an age
 All the virtues of which by the creed he revered
 Were to him illegitimate
 Thus he appeard
 To the world what the world chose to have him appear
 The frivolous tyrant of Fashion a mere
 Reformer in coats cards and carriages Still
 Twas the vigor of nature and tension of will
 That found for the first timeperhaps for the last
 In Lucile what they lacked yet to free from the Past
 Force and faith in the Future
 And so in his mind
 To the anguish of losing the woman was joind
 The terror of missing his lifes destination
 Which in her had its mystical representation


 III


 And truly the thought of it scaring him passd
 Oer his heart while he now through the twilight rode fast
 As a shade from the wing of some great bird obscene
 In a wide silent land may be suddenly seen
 Darkening over the sands where it startles and scares
 Some traveller strayd in the waste unawares
 So that thought more than once darkend over his heart
 For a moment and rapidly seemd to depart
 Fast and furious he rode through the thickets which rose
 Up the shaggy hillside and the quarrelling crows
 Clangd above him and clustering down the dim air
 Droppd into the dark woods By fits here and there
 Shepherd fires faintly gleamd from the valleys Oh how
 He envied the wings of each wild bird as now
 He urged the steed over the dizzy ascent
 Of the mountain Behind him a murmur was sent
 From the torrentbefore him a sound from the tracts
 Of the woodlands that waved oer the wild cataracts
 And the loose earth and loose stones rolld momently down
 From the hoofs of his steed to abysses unknown
 The red day had fallen beneath the black woods
 And the Powers of the night through the vast solitudes
 Walkd abroad and conversed with each other The trees
 Were in sound and in motion and mutterd like seas
 In Elfland The road through the forest was hollowd
 On he sped through the darkness as though he were followd
 Fast fast by the Erl King
 The wild wizardwork
 Of the forest at last opend sharp oer the fork
 Of a savage ravine and behind the black stems
 Of the last trees whose leaves in the light gleamd like gems
 Broke the broad moon above the voluminous
 Rockchaosthe Hecate of that Tartarus
 With his horse reeking white he at last reachd the door
 Of a small mountain inn on the brow of a hoar
 Craggy promontory oer a fissure as grim
 Through which ever roaring there leapd oer the limb
 Of the rent rock a torrent of water from sight
 Into pools that were feeding the roots of the night
 A balcony hung oer the water Above
 In a glimmering casement a shade seemd to move
 At the door the old negress was nodding her head
 As he reachd it My mistress awaits you she said
 And up the rude stairway of creeking pine rafter
 He followd her silent A few moments after
 His heart almost stunned him his head seemd to reel
 For a door closedLuvois was alone with Lucile


 IV


 In a gray travelling dress her dark hair unconfined
 Streaming oer it and tossed now and then by the wind
 From the lattice that waved the dull flame in a spire
 From a brass lamp before hera faint hectic fire
 On her cheek to her eyes lent the lustre of fever
 They seemd to have wept themselves wider than ever
 Those dark eyesso dark and so deep
 You relent
 And your plans have been changed by the letter I sent
 There his voice sank borne down by a strong inward strife

 LUCILE

 Your letter yes Duke For it threatend mans life
 Womans honor

 Luvois

 The last madam NOT

 LUCILE

 Both I glance
 At your own words blush son of the knighthood of France
 As I read them You say in this letter
 I know
 Why now you refuse me tis is it not so
 For the man who has trifled before wantonly
 And now trifles again with the heart you deny
 To myself But he shall not By mans last wild law
 I will seize on the right the right Duc de Luvois
 To avenge for you woman the past and to give
 To the future its freedom That man shalt not live
 To make you as wretched as you have made me

 LUVOIS

 Well madam in those words what words do you see
 That threatens the honor of woman

 LUCILE

 See what
 What word do you ask Every word would you not
 Had I taken your hand thus have felt that your name
 Was soild and dishonord by more than mere shame
 If the woman that bore it had first been the cause
 Of the crime which in these words is menaced You pause
 Womans honor you ask Is there sir no dishonor
 In the smile of a woman when men gazing on her
 Can shudder and say In that smile is a grave
 No you can have no cause Duke for no right you have
 In the contest you menace That contest but draws
 Every right into ruin By all human laws
 Of mans heart I forbid it by all sanctities
 Of mans social honor
 The Duke droopd his eyes
 I obey you he said but let woman beware
 How she plays fast and loose thus with human despair
 And the storm in mans heart Madam yours was the right
 When you saw that I hoped to extinguish hope quite
 But you should from the first have done this for I feel
 That you knew from the first that I loved you
 Lucile
 This sudden reproach seemd to startle
 She raised
 A slow wistful regard to his features and gazed
 On them silent awhile His own looks were downcast
 Through her heart whence its first wild alarm was now passd
 Pity crept and perhaps oer her conscience a tear
 Falling softly awoke it
 However severe
 Were they unjust these sudden upbraidings to her
 Had she lightly misconstrued this mans character
 Which had seemd even when most impassiond it seemd
 Too selfconscious to lose all in love Had she deemd
 That this airy gay insolent man of the world
 So proud of the place the world gave him held furld
 In his bosom no passion which once shaken wide
 Might tug till it snapped that erect lofty pride
 Were those elements in him which once roused to strife
 Overthrow a whole nature and change a whole life
 There are two kinds of strength One the strength of the river
 Which through continents pushes its pathway forever
 To fling its fond heart in the sea if it lose
 This the aim of its life it is lost to its use
 It goes mad is diffused into deluge and dies
 The other the strength of the sea which supplies
 Its deep life from mysterious sources and draws
 The rivers life into its own life by laws
 Which it heeds not The difference in each case is this
 The river is lost if the ocean it miss
 If the sea miss the river what matter The sea
 Is the sea still forever Its deep heart will be
 Selfsufficing unconscious of loss as of yore
 Its sources are infinite still to the shore
 With no diminution of pride it will say
 I am here I the sea stand aside and make way
 Was his love then the love of the river and she
 Had she taken that love for the love of the sea


 V


 At that thought from her aspect whatever had been
 Stern or haughty departed and humble in mien
 She approachd him and brokenly murmurd as though
 To herself more than him Was I wrong is it so
 Hear me Duke you must feel that whatever you deem
 Your right to reproach me in this your esteem
 I may claim on ONE groundI at least am sincere
 You say that to me from the first it was clear
 That you loved me But what if this knowledge were known
 At a moment in life when I felt most alone
 And least able to be so a moment in fact
 When I strove from one haunting regret to retract
 And emancipate life and once more to fulfil
 Womans destinies duties and hopes would you still
 So bitterly blame me Eugene de Luvois
 If I hoped to see all this or deemd that I saw
 For a moment the promise of this in the plighted
 Affection of one who in nature united
 So much that from others affection might claim
 If only affection were free Do you blame
 The hope of that moment I deemd my heart free
 From all saving sorrow I deemd that in me
 There was yet strength to mould it once more to my will
 To uplift it once more to my hope Do you still
 Blame me Duke that I did not then bid you refrain
 From hope alas I too then hoped

 LUVOIS

 Oh again
 Yet again say that thrice blessed word say Lucile
 That you then deignd to hope

 LUCILE

 Yes to hope I could feel
 And could give to you that without which all else given
 Were but to deceive and to injure you even
 A heart free from thoughts of another Say then
 Do you blame that one hope

 LUVOIS

 O Lucile
 Say again
 She resumed gazing down and with faltering tone
 Do you blame me that when I at last had to own
 To my heart that the hope it had cherishd was oer
 And forever I said to you then Hope no more
 I myself hoped no more
 With but illsuppressed wrath
 The Duke answerd What then he recrosses your path
 This man and you have but to see him despite
 Of his troth to another to take back that light
 Worthless heart to your own which he wrongd years ago
 Lucile faintly brokenly murmurd No no
 Tis not thatbut alasbut I cannot conceal
 That I have not forgotten the pastbut I feel
 That I cannot accept all these gifts on your part
 In return for what ah Duke what is it a heart
 Which is only a ruin
 With words warm and wild
 Though a ruin it be trust me yet to rebuild
 And restore it Luvois cried though ruind it be
 Since so dear is that ruin ah yield it to me
 He approachd her She shrank back The grief in her eyes
 Answerd No
 An emotion more fierce seemd to rise
 And to break into flame as though fired by the light
 Of that look in his heart He exclaimd Am I right
 You reject ME Accept HIM
 I have not done so
 She said firmly He hoarsely resumed Not yetno
 But can you with accents as firm promise me
 That you will not accept him
 Accept Is he free
 Free to offer she said
 You evade me Lucile
 He replied ah you will not avow what you feel
 He might make himself free Oh you blushturn away
 Dare you openly look in my face lady say
 While you deign to reply to one question from me
 I may hope not you tell me but tell me may he
 What silent I alter my question If quite
 Freed in faith from this troth might he hope then
 He might
 She said softly


 VI


 Those two whisperd words in his breast
 As he heard them in one maddening moment releast
 All thats evil and fierce in mans nature to crush
 And extinguish in man all thats good In the rush
 Of wild jealousy all the fierce passions that waste
 And darken and devastate intellect chased
 From its realm human reason The wild animal
 In the bosom of man was set free And of all
 Human passions the fiercest fierce jealousy fierce
 As the fire and more wild than the whirlwind to pierce
 And to rend rushd upon him fierce jealousy swelld
 By all passions bred from it and ever impelld
 To involve all things else in the anguish within it
 And on others inflict its own pangs
 At that minute
 What passd through his mind who shall say who may tell
 The dark thoughts of mans heart which the red glare of hell
 Can illumine alone
 He stared wildly around
 That lone place so lonely That silence no sound
 Reachd that room through the dark evening air save drear
 Drip and roar of the cataract ceaseless and near
 It was midnight all round on the weird silent weather
 Deep midnight in him They twoalone and together
 Himself and that woman defenceless before him
 The triumph and bliss of his rival flashd oer him
 The abyss of his own black despair seemd to ope
 At his feet with that awful exclusion of hope
 Which Dante read over the city of doom
 All the Tarquin passd into his soul in the gloom
 And uttering words he dared never recall
 Words of insult and menace he thunderd down all
 The brewd stormcloud within him its flashes scorchd blind
 His own senses His spirit was driven on the wind
 Of a reckless emotion beyond his control
 A torrent seemd loosend within him His soul
 Surged up from that caldron of passion that hissd
 And seethd in his heart


 VII


 He had thrown and had missd
 His last stake


 VIII


 For transfigured she rose from the place
 Where he rested oerawed a saints scorn on her face
 Such a dread vade retro was written in light
 On her forehead the fiend would himself at that sight
 Have sunk back abashd to perdition I know
 If Lucretia at Tarquin but once had looked so
 She had needed no dagger next morning
 She rose
 And swept to the door like that phantom the snows
 Feel at nightfall sweep oer them when daylight is gone
 And Caucasus is with the moon all alone
 There she paused and as though from immeasurable
 Insurpassable distance she murmurd
 Farewell
 We alas have mistaken each other Once more
 Illusion tonight in my lifetime is oer
 Duc de Luvois adieu
 From the heartbreaking gloom
 Of that vacant reproachful and desolate room
 He felt she was gonegone forever


 IX


 No word
 The sharpest that ever was edged like a sword
 Could have pierced to his heart with such keen accusation
 As the silence the sudden profound isolation
 In which he remaind
 O return I repent
 He exclaimed but no sound through the stillness was sent
 Save the roar of the water in answer to him
 And the beetle that sleeping yet hummd her nighthymn
 An indistinct anthem that troubled the air
 With a searching and wistful and questioning prayer
 Return sung the wandering insect The roar
 Of the waters replied Nevermore nevermore
 He walked to the window The spray on his brow
 Was flung cold from the whirlpools of water below
 The frail wooden balcony shook in the sound
 Of the torrent The mountains gloomd sullenly round
 A candle one ray from a closed casement flung
 Oer the dim balustrade all bewilderd he hung
 Vaguely watching the broken and shimmering blink
 Of the stars on the veering and vitreous brink
 Of that snakelike prone column of water and listing
 Aloof oer the languors of air the persisting
 Sharp horn of the gray gnat Before he relinquishd
 His unconscious employment that light was extinguishd
 Wheels at last from the inn door aroused him He ran
 Down the stairs reached the doorjust to see her depart
 Down the mountain the carriage was speeding


 X


 His heart
 Peald the knell of its last hope He rushd on but whither
 He knew noton into the dark cloudy weather
 The midnightthe mountainson over the shelf
 Of the precipiceon stillaway from himself
 Till exhausted he sank mid the dead leaves and moss
 At the mouth of the forest A glimmering cross
 Of gray stone stood for prayer by the woodside He sank
 Prayerless powerless down at its base mid the dank
 Weeds and grasses his face hid amongst them He knew
 That the night had divided his whole life in two
 Behind him a past that was over forever
 Before him a future devoid of endeavor
 And purpose He felt a remorse for the one
 Of the other a fear What remaind to be done
 Whither now should he turn Turn again as before
 To his old easy careless existence of yore
 He could not He felt that for better or worse
 A change had passd oer him an angry remorse
 Of his own frantic failure and error had marrd
 Such a refuge forever The future seemd barrd
 By the corpse of a dead hope oer which he must tread
 To attain it Lifes wilderness round him was spread
 What clew there to cling by
 He clung by a name
 To a dynasty fallen forever He came
 Of an old princely house true through change to the race
 And the sword of Saint Louisa faith twere disgrace
 To relinquish and folly to live for Nor less
 Was his ancient religion once potent to bless
 Or to ban and the crozier his ancestors kneeld
 To adore when they fought for the Cross in hard field
 With the Crescent become ere it reachd him tradition
 A mere faded badge of a social position
 A thing to retain and say nothing about
 Lest if used it should draw degradation from doubt
 Thus the first time he sought them the creeds of his youth
 Wholly faild the strong needs of his manhood in truth
 And beyond them what region of refuge what field
 For employment this civilized age did it yield
 In that civilized land or to thought or to action
 Blind deliriums bewilderd and endless distraction
 Not even a desert not even the cell
 Of a hermit to flee to wherein he might quell
 The wild devilinstincts which now unreprest
 Ran riot through that ruind world in his breast


 XI


 So he lay there like Lucifer fresh from the sight
 Of a heaven scaled and lost in the wide arms of night
 Oer the howling abysses of nothingness There
 As he lay Natures deep voice was teaching him prayer
 But what had he to pray to
 The winds in the woods
 The voices abroad oer those vast solitudes
 Were in commune all round with the invisible
 Power that walkd the dim world by Himself at that hour
 But their language he had not yet learndin despite
 Of the much he HAD learndor forgotten it quite
 With its once native accents Alas what had he
 To add to that deeptoned sublime symphony
 Of thanksgiving A fiery finger was still
 Scorching into his heart some dread sentence His will
 Like a wind that is put to no purpose was wild
 At its work of destruction within him The child
 Of an infidel age he had been his own god
 His own devil
 He sat on the damp mountain sod
 and stared sullenly up at the dark sky
 The clouds
 Had heapd themselves over the bare west in crowds
 Of misshapen incongruous potents A green
 Streak of dreary cold luminous ether between
 The base of their black barricades and the ridge
 Of the grim world gleamd ghastly as under some bridge
 Cyclopsized in a city of ruins oerthrown
 By sieges forgotten some river unknown
 And unnamed widens on into desolate lands
 While he gazed that cloudcity invisible hands
 Dismantled and rent and reveald through a loop
 In the breachd dark the blemishd and halfbroken hoop
 Of the moon which soon silently sank and anon
 The whole supernatural pageant was gone
 The wide night discomforted conscious of loss
 Darkend round him One object alonethat gray cross
 Glimmerd faint on the dark Gazing up he descried
 Through the void air its desolate arms outstretchd wide
 As though to embrace him
 He turnd from the sight
 Set his face to the darkness and fled


 XII


 When the light
 Of the dawn grayly flickerd and glared on the spent
 Wearied ends of the night like a hope that is sent
 To the need of some grief when its need is the sorest
 He was sullenly riding across the dark forest
 Toward Luchon
 Thus riding with eyes of defiance
 Set against the young day as disclaiming alliance
 With aught that the day brings to man he perceived
 Faintly suddenly fleetingly through the dampleaved
 Autumn branches that put forth gaunt arms on his way
 The face of a man pale and wistful and gray
 With the gray glare of morning Eugene de Luvois
 With the sense of a strange second sight when he saw
 That phantomlike face could at once recognize
 By the sole instinct now left to guide him the eyes
 Of his rival though fleeting the vision and dim
 With a stern sad inquiry fixd keenly on him
 And to meet it a lie leapd at once to his own
 A lie born of that lying darkness now grown
 Over all in his nature He answerd that gaze
 With a look which if ever a mans look conveys
 More intensely than words what a man means conveyd
 Beyond doubt in its smile an announcement which said
 I have triumphd The question your eyes would imply
 Comes too late Alfred Vargrave
 And so he rode by
 And rode on and rode gayly and rode out of sight
 Leaving that look behind him to rankle and bite


 XIII


 And it bit and it rankled


 XIV


 Lord Alfred scarce knowing
 Or choosing or heeding the way he was going
 By one wild hope impelld by one wild fear pursued
 And led by one instinct which seemd to exclude
 From his mind every human sensation save one
 The torture of doubthad strayd moodily on
 Down the highway deserted that evening in which
 With the Duke he had parted strayd on through rich
 Haze of sunset or into the gradual night
 Which darkend unnoticed the land from his sight
 Toward Saint Saviour nor did the changed aspect of all
 The wild scenery around him avail to recall
 To his senses their normal perceptions until
 As he stood on the black shaggy brow of the hill
 At the mouth of the forest the moon which had hung
 Two dark hours in a cloud slippd on fire from among
 The rent vapors and sunk oer the ridge of the world
 Then he lifted his eyes and saw round him unfurld
 In one moment of splendor the leagues of dark trees
 And the long rocky line of the wild Pyrenees
 And he knew by the milestone scored rough on the face
 Of the bare rock he was but two hours from the place
 Where Lucile and Luvois must have met This same track
 The Duke must have traversed perforce to get back
 To Luchon not yet then the Duke had returned
 He listend he lookd up the dark but discernd
 Not a trace not a sound of a horse by the way
 He knew that the night was approaching to day
 He resolved to proceed to Saint Saviour The morn
 Which at last through the forest broke chill and forlorn
 Reveald to him riding toward Luchon the Duke
 Twas then that the two men exchanged look for look


 XV


 And the Dukes rankled in him


 XVI


 He rushd on He tore
 His path through the thicket He reachd the inn door
 Roused the yet drowsing porter reluctant to rise
 And inquired for the Countess The man rubbd his eyes
 The Countess was gone And the Duke
 The man stared
 A sleepy inquiry
 With accents that scared
 The mans dull sense awake He the stranger he cried
 Who had been there that night
 The man grinnd and replied
 With a vacant intelligence He oh ay ay
 He went after the lady
 No further reply
 Could he give Alfred Vargrave demanded no more
 Flung a coin to the man and so turnd from the door
 What the Duke then the night in that lone inn had passd
 In that lone innwith her Was that look he had cast
 When they met in the forest that look which remaind
 On his mind with its terrible smile thus explaind


 XVII


 The day was half turnd to the evening before
 He reentered Luchon with a heart sick and sore
 In the midst of a light crowd of babblers his look
 By their voices attracted distinguished the Duke
 Gay insolent noisy with eyes sparkling bright
 With laughter shrill airy continuous
 Right
 Through the throng Alfred Vargrave with swift sombre stride
 Glided on The Duke noticed him turnd steppd aside
 And cordially grasping his hand whisperd low
 O how right have you been There can never beno
 Neverany more contest between us Milord
 Let us henceforth be friends
 Having utterd that word
 He turnd lightly round on his heel and again
 His gay laughter was heard echoed loud by that train
 Of his young imitators
 Lord Alfred stood still
 Rooted stunnd to the spot He felt weary and ill
 Out of heart with his own heart and sick to the soul
 With a dull stifling anguish he could not control
 Does he hear in a dream through the buzz of the crowd
 The Dukes blithe associates babbling aloud
 Some comment upon his gay humor that day
 He never was gayer what makes him so gay
 Tis no doubt say the flatterers flattering in tune
 Some vestal whose virtue no tongue dare impugn
 Has at last found a Marswho of course shall be nameless
 That vestal that yields to Mars ONLY is blameless
 Hark hears he a name which thus syllabled stirs
 All his heart into tumult Lucile de Nevers
 With the Dukes coupled gayly in some laughing light
 Free allusion Not so as might give him the right
 To turn fiercely round on the speaker but yet
 To a trite and irreverent compliment set


 XVIII


 Slowly slowly usurping that place in his soul
 Where the thought of Lucile was enshrined did there roll
 Back again back again on its smooth downward course
 Oer his nature with gatherd momentum and force
 THE WORLD


 XIX


 No he mutterd she cannot have sinnd
 True women there are selfnamed women of mind
 Who love rather libertyliberty yes
 To choose and to leavethan the legalized stress
 Of the lovingest marriage But sheis she so
 I will not believe it Lucile O no no
 Not Lucile
 But the world and ah what would it say
 O the look of that man and his laughter today
 The gossips light question the slanderous jest
 She is right no we could not be happy Tis best
 As it is I will write to herwrite O my heart
 And accept her farewell OUR farewell must we part
 Part thus thenforever Lucile Is it so
 Yes I feel it We could not be happy I know
 Twas a dream we must waken


 XX


 With head bowd as though
 By the weight of the hearts resignation and slow
 Moody footsteps he turned to his inn
 Drawn apart
 From the gate in the courtyard and ready to start
 Postboys mounted portmanteaus packed up and made fast
 A travellingcarriage unnoticed he passd
 He orderd his horse to be ready anon
 Sent and paid for the reckoning and slowly passd on
 And ascended the staircase and enterd his room
 It was twilight The chamber was dark in the gloom
 Of the evening He listlessly kindled a light
 On the mantelpiece there a large card caught his sight
 A large card a stout card wellprinted and plain
 Nothing flourishing flimsy affected or vain
 It gave a respectable look to the slab
 That it lay on The name was

 SIR RIDLEY MACNAB

 Full familiar to him was the name that he saw
 For twas that of his own future uncleinlaw
 Mrs Darcys rich brother the banker well known
 As wearing the longest philacteried gown
 Of all the rich Pharisees England can boast of
 A shrewd Puritan Scot whose sharp wits made the most of
 This world and the next having largely invested
 Not only where treasure is never molested
 By thieves moth or rust but on this earthly ball
 Where interest was high and security small
 Of mankind there was never a theory yet
 Not by some individual instance upset
 And so to that sorrowful verse of the Psalm
 Which declares that the wicked expand like the palm
 In a world where the righteous are stunted and pent
 A cheering exception did Ridley present
 Like the worthy of Uz Heaven prosperd his piety
 The leader of every religious society
 Christian knowledge he labord t though life to promote
 With personal profit and knew how to quote
 Both the Stocks and the Scripture with equal advantage
 To himself and admiring friends in this CantAge


 XXI


 Whilst over this card Alfred vacantly brooded
 A waiter his head through the doorway protruded
 Sir Ridley MacNab with Milord wishd to speak
 Alfred Vargrave could feel there were tears on his cheek
 He brushed them away with a gesture of pride
 He glanced at the glass when his own face he eyed
 He was scared by its pallor Inclining his head
 He with tones calm unshaken and silvery said
 Sir Ridley may enter
 In three minutes more
 That benign apparition appeared at the door
 Sir Ridley released for a while from the cares
 Of business and minded to breathe the pure airs
 Of the blue Pyrenees and enjoy his release
 In company there with his sister and niece
 Found himself now at Luchondistributing tracts
 Sowing seed by the way and collecting new facts
 For Exeter Hall he was starting that night
 For Bigorre he had heard to his cordial delight
 That Lord Alfred was there and himself setting out
 For the same destination impatient no doubt
 Here some commonplace compliments as to the marriage
 Through his speech trickled softly like honey his carriage
 Was ready A storm seemd to threaten the weather
 If his young friend agreed why not travel together
 With a footstep uncertain and restless a frown
 Of perplexity during this speech up and down
 Alfred Vargrave was striding but after a pause
 And a slight hesitation the which seemd to cause
 Some surprise to Sir Ridley he answerdMy dear
 Sir Ridley allow me a few moments here
 Half an hour at the mostto conclude an affair
 Of a nature so urgent as hardly to spare
 My presence which brought me indeed to this spot
 Before I accept your kind offer
 Why not
 Said Sir Ridley and smiled Alfred Vargrave before
 Sir Ridley observed it had passd through the door
 A few moments later with footsteps revealing
 Intense agitation of uncontrolld feeling
 He was rapidly pacing the garden below
 What passd through his mind then is more than I know
 But before one halfhour into darkness had fled
 In the courtyard he stood with Sir Ridley His tread
 Was firm and composed Not a sign on his face
 Betrayed there the least agitation The place
 You so kindly have offerd he said I accept
 And he stretchd out his hand The two travellers steppd
 Smiling into the carriage
 And thus out of sight
 They drove down the dark road and into the night


 XXII


 Sir Ridley was one of those wise men who so far
 As their power of saying it goes say with Zophar
 We no doubt are the people and wisdom shall die with us
 Though of wisdom like theirs there is no small supply with us
 Side by side in the carriage ensconced the two men
 Began to converse somewhat drowsily when
 Alfred suddenly thoughtHeres a man of ripe age
 At my side by his fellows reputed as sage
 Who looks happy and therefore who must have been wise
 Suppose I with caution reveal to his eyes
 Some few of the reasons which make me believe
 That I neither am happy nor wise twould relieve
 And enlighten perchance my own darkness and doubt
 For which purpose a feeler he softly put out
 It was snappd up at once
 What is truth jesting Pilate
 Askd and passd from the question at once with a smile at
 Its utter futility Had he addressd it
 To Ridley MacNab he at least had confessd it
 Admitted discussion and certainly no man
 Could more promptly have answerd the sceptical Roman
 Than Ridley Hear some street astronomer talk
 Grant him two or three hearers a morsel of chalk
 And forthwith on the pavement hell sketch you the scheme
 Of the heavens Then hear him enlarge on his theme
 Not afraid of La Place nor of Arago he
 Hell prove you the whole plan in plain A B C
 Heres your suncall him A Bs the moon it is clear
 How the rest of the alphabet brings up the rear
 Of the planets Now ask Arago ask La Place
 Your sages who speak with the heavens face to face
 Their science in plain A B C to accord
 To your pointblank inquiry my friends not a word
 Will you get for your pains from their sad lips Alas
 Not a drop from the bottle thats quite full will pass
 Tis the halfempty vessel that freest emits
 The water thats in it Tis thus with mens wits
 Or at least with their knowledge A mans capability
 Of imparting to others a truth with facility
 Is proportiond forever with painful exactness
 To the portable nature the vulgar compactness
 The minuteness in size or the lightness in weight
 Of the truth he imparts So small coins circulate
 More freely than large ones A beggar asks alms
 And we fling him a sixpence nor feel any qualms
 But if every street charity shook an investment
 Or each beggar to clothe we must strip off a vestment
 The length of the process would limit the act
 And therefore the truth thats summd up in a tract
 Is most lightly dispensed
 As for Alfred indeed
 On what spoonfuls of truth he was sufferd to feed
 By Sir Ridley I know not This only I know
 That the two men thus talking continued to go
 Onward somehow togetheron into the night
 The midnightin which they escape from our sight


 XXIII


 And meanwhile a world had been changed in its place
 And those glittering chains that oer blue balmy space
 Hang the blessing of darkness had drawn out of sight
 To solace unseen hemispheres the soft night
 And the dew of the dayspring benignly descended
 And the fair morn to all things new sanction extended
 In the smile of the East And the lark soaring on
 Lost in light shook the dawn with a song from the sun
 And the world laughd
 It wanted but two rosy hours
 From the noon when they passd through the thick passion flowers
 Of the little wild garden that dimpled before
 The small house where their carriage now stoppd at Bigorre
 And more fair than the flowers more fresh than the dew
 With her white morning robe flitting joyously through
 The dark shrubs with which the soft hillside was clothed
 Alfred Vargrave perceived where he paused his betrothed
 Matilda sprang to him at once with a face
 Of such sunny sweetness such gladness such grace
 And radiant confidence childlike delight
 That his whole heart upbraided itself at that sight
 And he murmurd or sighd O how could I have strayd
 From this sweet child or sufferd in aught to invade
 Her young claim on my life though it were for an hour
 The thought of another
 Look up my sweet flower
 He whisperd her softly my heart unto thee
 Is returnd as returns to the rose the wild bee
 And will wander no more laughed Matilda
 No more
 He repeated And low to himself Yes tis oer
 My course too is decided Lucile Was I blind
 To have dreamd that these clever Frenchwomen of mind
 Could satisfy simply a plain English heart
 Or sympathize with it


 XXIV


 And here the first part
 Of the drama is over The curtain falls furld
 On the actors within itthe Heart and the World
 Wood and wooer have playd with the riddle of life
 Have they solved it
 Appear answer Husband and Wife


 XXV


 Yet ere bidding farewell to Lucile de Nevers
 Hear her own hearts farewell in this letter of hers

 THE COMTESSE DE NEVERS TO A FRIEND IN INDIA

 Once more O my friend to your arms and your heart
 And the places of old never never to part
 Once more to the palm and the fountain Once more
 To the land of my birth and the deep skies of yore
 From the cities of Europe pursued by the fret
 Of their turmoil wherever my footsteps are set
 From the children that cry for the birth and behold
 There is no strength to bear themold Time is SO old
 From the worlds weary masters that come upon earth
 Sappd and mined by the fever they bear from their birth
 From the men of small stature mere parts of a crowd
 Born too late when the strength of the world hath been bowd
 Backback to the Orient from whose sunbright womb
 Sprang the giants which now are no more in the bloom
 And the beauty of times that are faded forever
 To the palms to the tombs to the still Sacred River
 Where I too the child of a day that is done
 First leaped into life and lookd up at the sun
 Back again back again to the hilltops of home
 I come O my friend my consoler I come
 Are the three intense stars that we watchd night by night
 Burning broad on the band of Orion as bright
 Are the large Indian moons as serene as of old
 When as children we gatherd the moonbeams for gold
 Do you yet recollect me my friend Do you still
 Remember the free games we playd on the hill
 Mid those huge stones upheavd where we recklessly trod
 Oer the old ruind fane of the old ruind god
 How he frownd while around him we carelessly playd
 That frown on my life ever after hath stayd
 Like the shade of a solemn experience upcast
 From some vague supernatural grief in the past
 For the poor god in pain more than anger he frownd
 To perceive that our youth though so fleeting had found
 In its transient and ignorant gladness the bliss
 Which his science divine seemd divinely to miss
 Alas you may haply remember me yet
 The free child whose glad childhood myself I forget
 I comea sad woman defrauded of rest
 I bear to you only a laboring breast
 My heart is a stormbeaten ark wildly hurld
 Oer the whirlpools of time with the wrecks of a world
 The dove from my bosom hath flown far away
 It is flown and returns not though many a day
 Have I watchd from the windows of life for its coming
 Friend I sigh for repose I am weary of roaming
 I know not what Ararat rises for me
 Far away oer the waves of the wandering sea
 I know not what rainbow may yet from far hills
 Lift the promise of hope the cessation of ills
 But a voice like the voice of my youth in my breast
 Wakes and whispers me onto the East to the East
 Shall I find the childs heart that I left there or find
 The lost youth I recall with its pure peace of mind
 Alas who shall number the drops of the rain
 Or give to the dead leaves their greenness again
 Who shall seal up the caverns the earthquake hath rent
 Who shall bring forth the winds that within them are pent
 To a voice who shall render an image or who
 From the heats of the noontide shall gather the dew
 I have burnd out within me the fuel of life
 Wherefore lingers the flame Rest is sweet after strife
 I would sleep for a while I am weary
 My friend
 I had meant in these lines to regather and send
 To our old home my lifes scatterd links But tis vain
 Each attempt seems to shatter the chaplet again
 Only fit now for fingers like mine to run oer
 Who return a recluse to those cloisters of yore
 Whence too far I have wanderd
 How many long years
 Does it seem to me now since the quick scorching tears
 While I wrote to you splashd out a girls premature
 Moans of pain at what women in silence endure
 To your eyes friend of mine and to your eyes alone
 That now longfaded page of my life hath been shown
 Which recorded my hearts birth and death as you know
 Many years sincehow many
 A few months ago
 I seemd reading it backward that page Why explain
 Whence or how The old dream of my life rose again
 The old superstition the idol of old
 It is over The leaf trodden down in the mould
 Is not to the forest more lost than to me
 That emotion I bury it here by the sea
 Which will bear me anon far away from the shore
 Of a land which my footsteps will visit no more
 And a hearts requiescat I write on that grave
 Hark the sigh of the wind and the sound of the wave
 Seem like voices of spirits that whisper me home
 I come O you whispering voices I come
 My friend ask me nothing
 Receive me alone
 As a Santon receives to his dwelling of stone
 In silence some pilgrim the midnight may bring
 It may be an angel that weary of wing
 Hath paused in his flight from some city of doom
 Or only a wayfarer strayd in the gloom
 This only I know that in Europe at least
 Lives the craft or the power that must master our East
 Wherefore strive where the gods must themselves yield at last
 Both they and their altars pass by with the Past
 The gods of the household Time thrust from the shelf
 And I seem as unreal and weird to myself
 As those idols of old
 Other times other men
 Other men other passions
 So be it yet again
 I turned to my birthplace the birthplace of morn
 And the light of those lands where the great sun is born
 Spread your arms O my friend on your breast let me feel
 The repose which hath fled from my own
 Your LUCILE

 Hail Muse But each Muse by this time has I know
 Been used up and Apollo has bent his own bow
 All too long so I leave unassaulted the portal
 Of Olympus and only invoke here a mortal

 Hail Murraynot Lindleybut Murray and Son
 Hail omniscient beneficent great TwoinOne
 In Albermarle Street may thy temple long stand
 Long enlightend and led by thine erudite hand
 May each novice in science nomadic unravel
 Statistical mazes of modernized travel
 May each innkeeper knave long thy judgment revere
 And the postboys of Europe regard thee with fear
 While they feel in the silence of baffled extortion
 That knowledge is power Long long like that portion
 Of the national soil which the Greek exile took
 In his baggage wherever he went may thy book
 Cheer each poor British pilgrim who trusts to thy wit
 Not to pay through his nose just for following it
 Mayst thou long O instructor preside oer his way
 And teach him alike what to praise and to pay
 Thee pursuing this pathway of song once again
 I invoke lest unskilld I should wander in vain
 To my call be propitious nor churlish refuse
 Thy great accents to lend to the lips of my Muse
 For I sing of the Naiads who dwell mid the stems
 Of the green lindentrees by the waters of Ems
 Yes thy spirit descends upon mine O John Murray
 And I startwith thy bookfor the Baths in a hurry


 II


 At Coblentz a bridge of boats crosses the Rhine
 And from thence the road winding by Ehrenbreitstein
 Passes over the frontier of Nassua
 N B
 No customhouse here since the Zollverein See
 Murray paragraph 30
 The route at each turn
 Here the lover of nature allows to discern
 In varying prospect a rich wooded dale
 The vine and acaciatree mostly prevail
 In the foliage observable here and moreover
 The soil is carbonic The road under cover
 Of the grapeclad and mountainous upland that hems
 Round this beautiful spot brings the traveller toEMS
 A Schnellpost from Frankfort arrives every day
 At the Kurhaus the old Ducal mansion you pay
 Eight florins for lodgings A Restaurateur
 Is attachd to the place but most travellers prefer
 Including indeed many persons of note
 To dine at the usualpriced table dhote
 Through the town runs the Lahn the steep green banks of which
 Two rows of white picturesque houses enrich
 And between the high road and the river is laid
 Out a sort of a garden calld THE Promenade
 Female visitors here who may make up their mind
 To ascend to the top of these mountains will find
 On the banks of the stream saddled all the day long
 Troops of donkeyssurefootedproverbially strong
 And the traveller at Ems may remark as he passes
 Here as elsewhere the women run after the asses


 III


 Mid the worlds weary denizens bound for these springs
 In the month when the merle on the maplebough sings
 Pursued to the place from dissimilar paths
 By a similar sickness there came to the Baths
 Four suffererseach stricken deep through the heart
 Or the head by the selfsame invisible dart
 Of the arrow that flieth unheard in the noon
 From the sickness that walketh unseen in the moon
 Through this great lazaretto of life wherein each
 Infects with his own sores the next within reach
 First of these were a young English husband and wife
 Grown weary ere half through the journey of life
 O Nature say where thou gray mother of earth
 Is the strength of thy youth that thy womb brings to birth
 Only old men today On the winds as of old
 Thy voice in its accent is joyous and bold
 Thy forests are green as of yore and thine oceans
 Yet move in the might of their ancient emotions
 But manthy last birth and thy bestis no more
 Lifes free lord that lookd up to the starlight of yore
 With the faith on the brow and the fire in the eyes
 The firm foot on the earth the high heart in the skies
 But a grayheaded infant defrauded of youth
 Born too late or too early
 The lady in truth
 Was young fair and gentle and never was given
 To more heavenly eyes the pure azure of heaven
 Never yet did the sun touch to ripples of gold
 Tresses brighter than those which her soft hand unrolld
 From her noble and innocent brow when she rose
 An Aurora at dawn from her balmy repose
 And into the mirror the bloom and the blush
 Of her beauty broke glowing like light in a gush
 From the sunrise in summer
 Love roaming shall meet
 But rarely a nature more sound or more sweet
 Eyes brighterbrows whitera figure more fair
 Or lovelier lengths of more radiant hair
 Than thine Lady Alfred And here I aver
 May those that have seen thee declare if I err
 That not all the oysters in Britain contain
 A pearl pure as thou art
 Let some one explain
 Who may know more than I of the intimate life
 Of the pearl with the oysterwhy yet in his wife
 In despite of her beautyand most when he felt
 His soul to the sense of her loveliness melt
 Lord Alfred missd something he sought for indeed
 The more that he missd it the greater the need
 Till it seemd to himself he could willingly spare
 All the charms that he found for the one charm not there


 IV


 For the blessings Life lends us it strictly demands
 The worth of their full usufruct at our hands
 And the value of all things exists not indeed
 In themselves but mans use of them feeding mans need
 Alfred Vargrave in wedding with beauty and youth
 Had embraced both Ambition and Wealth Yet in truth
 Unfulfilld the ambition and sterile the wealth
 In a life paralyzed by a moral illhealth
 Had remaind while the beauty and youth unredeemd
 From a vague disappointment at all things but seemd
 Day by day to reproach him in silence for all
 That lost youth in himself they had faild to recall
 No career had he followd no object obtaind
 In the world by those worldly advantages gaind
 From nuptials beyond which once seemd to appear
 Lit by love the broad path of a brilliant career
 All that glitterd and gleamd through the moonlight of youth
 With a glory so fair now that manhood in truth
 Graspd and gatherd it seemd like that false fairy gold
 Which leaves in the hand only moss leaves and mould


 V


 Fairy gold moss and leaves and the young Fairy Bride
 Lived there yet fairylands in the face at his side
 Say O friend if at evening thou ever hast watchd
 Some pale and impalpable vapor detachd
 From the dim and disconsolate earth rise and fall
 Oer the light of a sweet serene star until all
 The chilld splendor reluctantly waned in the deep
 Of its own native heaven Even so seemd to creep
 Oer that fair and ethereal face day by day
 While the radiant vermeil subsiding away
 Hid its light in the heart the faint gradual veil
 Of a sadness unconscious
 The lady grew pale
 As silent her lord grew and both as they eyed
 Each the other askance turnd and secretly sighd
 Ah wise friend what avails all experience can give
 True we know what life isbut alas do we live
 The grammar of life we have gotten by heart
 But lifes self we have made a dead languagean art
 Not a voice Could we speak it but once as twas spoken
 When the silence of passion the first time was broken
 Cuvier knew the world better than Adam no doubt
 But the last man at best was but learned about
 What the first without learning ENJOYED What art thou
 To the man of today O Leviathan now
 A science What wert thou to him that from ocean
 First beheld thee appear A surprisean emotion
 When life leaps in the veins when it beats in the heart
 When it thrills as it fills every animate part
 Where lurks it how works it We scarcely detect it
 But life goes the heart dies haste O leech and dissect it
 This accursed aesthetical ethical age
 Hath so fingerd lifes hornbook so blurrd every page
 That the old glad romance the gay chivalrous story
 With its fables of faery its legends of glory
 Is turnd to a tedious instruction not new
 To the children that read it insipidly through
 We know too much of Love ere we love We can trace
 Nothing new unexpected or strange in his face
 When we see it at last Tis the same little Cupid
 With the same dimpled cheek and the smile almost stupid
 We have seen in our pictures and stuck on our shelves
 And copied a hundred times over ourselves
 And wherever we turn and whatever we do
 Still that horrible sense of the deja connu


 VI


 Perchance twas the fault of the life that they led
 Perchance twas the fault of the novels they read
 Perchance twas a fault in themselves I am bound not
 To say this I knowthat these two creatures found not
 In each other some sign they expected to find
 Of a something unnamed in the heart or the mind
 And missing it each felt a right to complain
 Of a sadness which each found no word to explain
 Whatever it was the world noticed not it
 In the lighthearted beauty the lighthearted wit
 Still as once with the actors in Greece tis the case
 Each must speak to the crowd with a mask on his face
 Praise followd Matilda wherever she went
 She was flatterd Can flattery purchase content
 Yes While to its voice for a moment she listend
 The young cheek still bloomd and the soft eyes still glistend
 And her lord when like one of those light vivid things
 That glide down the gauzes of summer with wings
 Of rapturous radiance unconscious she moved
 Through that buzz of inferior creatures which proved
 Her beauty their envy one moment forgot
 Mid the many charms there the one charm that was not
 And when oer her beauty enraptured he bowd
 As they turnd to each other each flushd from the crowd
 And murmurd those praises which yet seemd more dear
 Than the praises of others had grown to her ear
 She too ceased awhile her own fate to regret
 Yes he loves me she sighd this is love thenand YET


 VII


 Ah that YET fatal word tis the moral of all
 Thought and felt seen or done in this world since the Fall
 It stands at the end of each sentence we learn
 It flits in the vista of all we discern
 It leads us forever and ever away
 To find in tomorrow what flies with today
 Twas the same little fatal and mystical word
 That now like a mirage led my lady and lord
 To the waters of Ems from the waters of Marah
 Drooping Pilgrims in Fashions blank arid Sahara


 VIII


 At the same time pursued by a spell much the same
 To these waters two other worn pilgrims there came
 One a man one a woman just now at the latter
 As the Reader I mean by and by to look at her
 And judge for himself I will not even glance


 IX


 Of the selfcrownd young kings of the Fashion in France
 Whose resplendent regalia so dazzled the sight
 Whose horse was so perfect whose boots were so bright
 Who so haild in the salon so markd in the Bois
 Who so welcomed by all as Eugene de Luvois
 Of all the smoothbrowd premature debauchees
 In that town of all towns where Debauchery sees
 On the forehead of youth her mark everywhere graven
 In Paris I meanwhere the streets are all paven
 By those two fiends whom Milton saw bridging the way
 From Hell to this planetwho haughty and gay
 The free rebel of life bound or led by no law
 Walkd that causeway as bold as Eugene de Luvois
 Yes he marchd through the great masquerade loud of tongue
 Bold of brow but the motley he maskd in it hung
 So loose traild so wide and appeard to impede
 So strangely at times the vexd effort at speed
 That a keen eye might guess it was madenot for him
 But some brawler more stalwart of stature and limb
 That it irkd him in truth you at times could divine
 For when low was the music and spilt was the wine
 He would clutch at the garment as though it oppressd
 And stifled some impulse that choked in his breast


 X


 What he the light sport of his frivolous ease
 Was he too a prey to a mortal disease
 My friend hear a parable ponder it well
 For a moral there is in the tale that I tell
 One evening I sat in the Palais Royal
 And there while I laughd at Grassot and Arnal
 My eye fell on the face of a man at my side
 Every time that he laughd I observed that he sighd
 As though vexd to be pleased I remarkd that he sat
 Ill at ease on his seat and kept twirling his hat
 In his hand with a look of unquiet abstraction
 I inquired the cause of his dissatisfaction
 Sir he said if what vexes me here you would know
 Learn that passing this way some few halfhours ago
 I walkd into the Francais to look at Rachel
 Sir that woman in Phedre is a miracleWell
 I askd for a box they were occupied all
 For a seat in the balcony all taken a stall
 Taken too the whole house was as full as could be
 Not a hole for a rat I had just time to see
 The lady I love teteatete with a friend
 In a box out of reach at the opposite end
 Then the crowd pushd me out What was left me to do
 I tried for the tragedy que voulezvous
 Every place for the tragedy bookd mon ami
 The farce was close by at the farce me voici
 The piece is a new one and Grassot plays well
 There is drollery too in that fellow Ravel
 And Hyacinths nose is superb yet I meant
 My evening elsewhere and not thus to have spent
 Fate orders these things by her will not by ours
 Sir mankind is the sport of invisible powers

 I once met the Duc de Luvois for a moment
 And I markd when his features I fixd in my comment
 Oer those features the same vague disquietude stray
 I had seen on the face of my friend at the play
 And I thought that he too very probably spent
 His evenings not wholly as first he had meant


 XI


 O source of the holiest joys we inherit
 O Sorrow thou solemn invisible spirit
 Ill fares it with man when through lifes desert sand
 Grown impatient too soon for the longpromised land
 He turns from the worship of thee as thou art
 An expressless and imageless truth in the heart
 And takes of the jewels of Egypt the pelf
 And the gold of the Godless to make to himself
 A gaudy idolatrous image of thee
 And then bows to the sound of the cymbal the knee
 The sorrows we make to ourselves are false gods
 Like the prophets of Baal our bosoms with rods
 We may smite we may gash at our hearts till they bleed
 But these idols are blind deaf and dumb to our need
 The land is athirst and cries out tis in vain
 The great blessing of Heaven descends not in rain


 XII


 It was night and the lamps were beginning to gleam
 Through the long lindentrees folded each in his dream
 From that building which looks like a temple and is
 The Temple ofHealth Nay but enter I wis
 That never the rosyhued deity knew
 One votary out of that sallowcheekd crew
 Of Courlanders Wallacs Greeks affable Russians
 Explosive Parisians potatofaced Prussians
 JewsHamburghers chieflypure patriotsSuabians
 Cappadocians and Elamites Cretes and Arabians
 And the dwellers in Pontus My muse will not weary
 More lines with the list of them cur fremuere
 What is it they murmur and mutter and hum
 Into what Pandemonium is Pentecost come
 Oh what is the name of the god at whose fane
 Every nation is mixd in so motley a train
 What weird Kabala lies on those tables outspread
 To what oracle turns with attention each head
 What holds these pale worshippers each so devout
 And what are those hierophants busied about


 XIII


 Here passes repasses and flits to and fro
 And rolls without ceasing the great Yes and No
 Round this altar alternate the weird Passions dance
 And the God worshippd here is the old God of Chance
 Through the wideopen doors of the distant saloon
 Flute hautboy and fiddle are squeaking in tune
 And an indistinct music forever is rolld
 That mixes and chimes with the chink of the gold
 From a vision that flits in a luminous haze
 Of figures forever eluding the gaze
 It fleets through the doorway it gleams on the glass
 And the weird words pursue itRouge Impair et Passe
 Like a sound borne in sleep through such dreams as encumber
 With haggard emotions the wild wicked slumber
 Of some witch when she seeks through a nightmare to grab at
 The hot hoof of the fiend on her way to the Sabbat


 XIV


 The Duc de Luvois and Lord Alfred had met
 Some few evenings ago for the season as yet
 Was but young in this selfsame Pavilion of Chance
 The idler from England the idler from France
 Shook hands each of course with much cordial pleasure
 An acquaintance at Ems is to most men a treasure
 And they both were too wellbred in aught to betray
 One discourteous remembrance of things passd away
 Twas a sight that was pleasant indeed to be seen
 These friends exchange greetingsthe men who had been
 Foes so nearly in days that were past
 This no doubt
 Is why on the night I am speaking about
 My Lord Alfred sat down by himself at roulette
 Without one suspicion his bosom to fret
 Although he had left with his pleasant French friend
 Matilda half vexd at the rooms farthest end


 XV


 Lord Alfred his combat with Fortune began
 With a few modest thalersaway they all ran
 The reserve followd fast in the rear As his purse
 Grew lighter his spirits grew sensibly worse
 One needs not a Bacon to find a cause for it
 Tis an old law in physicsNatura abhorret
 Vacuumand my lord as he watchd his last crown
 Tumble into the bank turnd away with a frown
 Which the brows of Napoleon himself might have deckd
 On that day of all days when an empire was wreckd
 On thy plain Waterloo and he witnessd the last
 Of his favorite Guard cut to pieces aghast
 Just then Alfred felt he could scarcely tell why
 Within him the sudden strange sense that some eye
 Had long been intently regarding him there
 That some gaze was upon him too searching to bear
 He rose and lookd up Was it fact Was it fable
 Was it dream Was it waking Across the green table
 That face with its features so fatally known
 Those eyes whose deep gaze answerd strangely his own
 What was it Some ghost from its grave come again
 Some cheat of a feverish fanciful brain
 Or was it herself with those deep eyes of hers
 And that face unforgottenLucile de Nevers


 XVI


 Ah well that pale woman a phantom might seem
 Who appeard to herself but the dream of a dream
 Neath those features so calm that fair forehead so hushd
 That pale cheek forever by passion unflushd
 There yawnd an insatiate void and there heaved
 A tumult of restless regrets unrelieved
 The brief noon of beauty was passing away
 And the chill of the twilight fell silent and gray
 Oer that deep selfperceived isolation of soul
 And now as all around her the dim evening stole
 With its weird desolations she inwardly grieved
 For the want of that tender assurance received
 From the warmth of a whisper the glance of an eye
 Which should say or should look Fear thou naughtI am by
 And thus through that lonely and selffixd existence
 Crept a vague sense of silence and horror and distance
 A strange sort of faintfooted fearlike a mouse
 That comes out when tis dark in some old ducal house
 Long deserted where no one the creature can scare
 And the forms on the arras are all that move there

 In Romein the Forumthere opend one night
 A gulf All the augurs turnd pale at the sight
 In this omen the anger of Heaven they read
 Men consulted the gods then the oracle said
 Ever open this gulf shall endure till at last
 That which Rome hath most precious within it be cast
 The Romans threw in it their corn and their stuff
 But the gulf yawnd as wide Rome seemd likely enough
 To be ruind ere this rent in her heart she could choke
 Then Curtius revering the oracle spoke
 O Quirites to this Heavens question is come
 What to Rome is most precious The manhood of Rome
 He plunged and the gulf closed
 The tale is not new
 But the moral applies many ways and is true
 How for hearts rent in twain shall the curse be destroyd
 Tis a warm human one that must fill up the void
 Through many a heart runs the rent in the fable
 But who to discover a Curtius is able


 XVII


 Back she came from her long hidingplace at the source
 Of the sunrise where fair in their fabulous course
 Run the rivers of Eden an exile again
 To the cities of Europethe scenes and the men
 And the life and the ways she had left still oppressd
 With the same hungry heart and unpeaceable breast
 The same to the same things The world she had quitted
 With a sigh with a sigh she reenterd Soon flitted
 Through the salons and clubs to the great satisfaction
 Of Paris the news of a novel attraction
 The enchanting Lucile the gay Countess once more
 To her old friend the World had reopend her door
 The World came and shook hands and was pleased and amused
 With what the World then went away and abused
 From the womans fair fame it in naught could detract
 Twas the womans free genius it vexd and attackd
 With a sneer at her freedom of action and speech
 But its light careless cavils in truth could not reach
 The lone heart they aimd at Her tears fell beyond
 The worlds limit to feel that the world could respond
 To that hearts deepest innermost yearning in naught
 Twas no longer this earths idle inmates she sought
 The wit of the woman sufficed to engage
 In the womans gay court the first men of the age
 Some had genius and all wealth of mind to confer
 On the world but that wealth was not lavishd for her
 For the genius of man though so human indeed
 When calld out to mans help by some great human need
 The right to a mans chance acquaintance refuses
 To use what it hoards for mankinds nobler uses
 Genius touches the world at but one point alone
 Of that spacious circumference never quite known
 To the world all the infinite number of lines
 That radiate thither a mere point combines
 But one onlysome central affection apart
 From the reach of the world in which Genius is Heart
 And love lifes fine centre includes heart and mind
 And therefore it was that Lucile sighd to find
 Men of genius appear one and all in her ken
 When they stoopd themselves to it as mere clever men
 Artists statesmen and they in whose works are unfurld
 Worlds newfashioned for man as mere men of the world
 And so as alone now she stood in the sight
 Of the sunset of youth with her face from the light
 And watchd her own shadow grow long at her feet
 As though stretchd out the shade of some OTHER to meet
 The woman felt homeless and childless in scorn
 She seemd mockd by the voices of children unborn
 And when from these sombre reflections away
 She turnd with a sigh to that gay world more gay
 For her presence within it she knew herself friendless
 That her path led from peace and that path appeard endless
 That even her beauty had been but a snare
 And her wit sharpend only the edge of despair


 XVIII


 With a face all transfigured and flushd by surprise
 Alfred turnd to Lucile With those deep searching eyes
 She lookd into his own Not a word that she said
 Not a look not a blush one emotion betrayd
 She seemd to smile through him at something beyond
 When she answerd his questions she seemd to respond
 To some voice in herself With no trouble descried
 To each troubled inquiry she calmly replied
 Not so he At the sight of that face back again
 To his mind came the ghost of a longstifled pain
 A rememberd resentment half checkd by a wild
 And relentful regret like a motherless child
 Softly seeking admittance with plaintive appeal
 To the heart which resisted its entrance
 Lucile
 And himself thus however with freedom allowd
 To old friends talking still side by side left the crowd
 By the crowd unobserved Not unnoticed however
 By the Duke and Matilda Matilda had never
 Seen her husbands new friend
 She had followd by chance
 Or by instinct the sudden halfmenacing glance
 Which the Duke when he witnessd their meeting had turnd
 On Lucile and Lord Alfred and scared she discernd
 On his feature the shade of a gloom so profound
 That she shudderd instinctively Deaf to the sound
 Of her voice to some startled inquiry of hers
 He replied not but murmurd Lucile de Nevers
 Once again then so be it In the mind of that man
 At that moment there shaped itself vaguely the plan
 Of a purpose malignant and dark such alone
 To his own secret heart but imperfectly shown
 As could spring from the cloudy fierce chaos of thought
 By which all his nature to tumult was wrought


 XIX


 So he thought they meet thus and reweave the old charm
 And she hangs on his voice and she leans on his arm
 And she heeds me not seeks me not recks not of me
 Oh what if I showd her that I too can be
 Loved by oneher own rivalmore fair and more young
 The serpent rose in him a serpent which stung
 Sought to sting
 Each unconscious indeed of the eye
 Fixd upon them Lucile and my lord saunterd by
 In converse which seemd to be earnest A smile
 Now and then seemd to show where their thoughts touchd Meanwhile
 The muse of this story convinced that they need her
 To the Duke and Matilda returns gentle Reader


 XX


 The Duke with that sort of aggressive false praise
 Which is meant a resentful remonstrance to raise
 From a listener as sometimes a judge just before
 He pulls down the black cap very gently goes oer
 The case for the prisoner and deals tenderly
 With the man he is minded to hang by and by
 Had referrd to Lucile and then stoppd to detect
 In the face of Matilda the growing effect
 Of the words he had droppd Theres no weapon that slays
 Its victim so surely if well aimd as praise
 Thus a pause on their converse had fallen and now
 Each was silent preoccupied thoughtful
 You know
 There are moments when silence prolongd and unbroken
 More expressive may be than all words ever spoken
 It is when the heart has an instinct of what
 In the heart of another is passing And that
 In the heart of Matilda what was it Whence came
 To her cheek on a sudden that tremulous flame
 What weighed down her head
 All your eye could discover
 Was the fact that Matilda was troubled Moreover
 That trouble the Dukes presence seemd to renew
 She however broke silence the first of the two
 The Duke was too prudent to shatter the spell
 Of a silence which suited his purpose so well
 She was plucking the leaves from a pale blush rose blossom
 Which had falln from the nosegay she wore in her bosom
 This poor flower she said seems it not out of place
 In this hot lamplit air with its fresh fragile grace
 She bent her head low as she spoke With a smile
 The Duke watchd her caressing the leaves all the while
 And continued on his side the silence He knew
 This would force his companion their talk to renew
 At the point that he wishd and Matilda divined
 The significant pause with new trouble of mind
 She lifted one moment her head but her look
 Encounterd the ardent regard of the Duke
 And droppd back on her flowret abashd Then still seeking
 The assurance she fancied she showd him by speaking
 She conceived herself safe in adopting again
 The theme she should most have avoided just then


 XXI


 Duke she said and she felt as she spoke her cheek burnd
 You know then this lady
 Too well he returnd

 MATILDA

 True you drew with emotion her portrait just now

 LUVOIS

 With emotion

 MATILDA

 Yes yes you described her I know
 As possessd of a charm all unrivalld

 LUVOIS

 Alas
 You mistook me completely You madam surpass
 This lady as moonlight does lamplight as youth
 Surpasses its best imitations as truth
 The fairest of falsehood surpasses as nature
 Surpasses arts masterpiece ay as the creature
 Fresh and pure in its native adornment surpasses
 All the charms got by heart at the worlds lookingglasses
 Yet you saidshe continued with some trepidation
 That you quite comprehended a slight hesitation
 Shook the sentence a passion so strong as

 LUVOIS

 True true
 But not in a man that had once lookd at you
 Nor can I conceive or excuse or
 Hush hush
 She broke in all more fair for one innocent blush
 Between man and woman these things differ so
 It may be that the world pardons how should I know
 In you what it visits on us or tis true
 It may be that we women are better than you

 LUVOIS

 Who denies it Yet madam once more you mistake
 The world in its judgment some difference may make
 Twixt the man and the woman so far as respects
 Its social enchantments but not as affects
 The one sentiment which it were easy to prove
 Is the sole law we look to the moment we love

 MATILDA

 That may be Yet I think I should be less severe
 Although so inexperienced in such things I fear
 I have learnd that the heart cannot always repress
 Or account for the feelings which sway it
 Yes yes
 That is too true indeed the Duke sighd
 And again
 For one moment in silence continued the twain


 XXII


 At length the Duke slowly as though he had needed
 All this time to repress his emotions proceeded
 And yet what avails then to woman the gift
 Of a beauty like yours if it cannot uplift
 Her heart from the reach of one doubt one despair
 One pang of wrongd love to which women less fair
 Are exposed when they love
 With a quick change of tone
 As though by resentment impelld he went on
 The name that you bear it is whisperd you took
 From love not convention Well lady that look
 So excited so keen on the face you must know
 Throughout all its expressionsthat rapturous glow
 Those eloquent featuressignificant eyes
 Which that pale woman sees yet betrays no surprise
 He pointed his hand as he spoke to the door
 Fixing with it Lucile and Lord Alfred before
 Have you ever once seen what just now you may view
 In that face so familiar no lady tis new
 Young lovely and loving no doubt as you are
 Are you loved


 XXIII


 He lookd at herpausedfelt if thus far
 The ground held yet The ardor with which he had spoken
 This close rapid question thus suddenly broken
 Inspired in Matilda a vague sense of fear
 As though some indefinite danger were near
 With composure however at once she replied
 Tis three years since the day when I first was a bride
 And my husband I never had cause to suspect
 Nor ever have stoopd sir such cause to detect
 Yet if in his looks or his acts I should see
 See or fancysome moments oblivion of me
 I trust that I too should forget itfor you
 Must have seen that my heart is my husbands
 The hue
 On her cheek with the effort wherewith to the Duke
 She had uttered this vague and halffrightened rebuke
 Was white as the rose in her hand The last word
 Seemd to die on her lip and could scarcely be heard
 There was silence again
 A great step had been made
 By the Duke in the words he that evening had said
 There half drownd by the music Matilda that night
 Had listendlong listendno doubt in despite
 Of herself to a voice she should never have heard
 And her heart by that voice had been troubled and stirrd
 And so having sufferd in silence his eye
 To fathom her own he resumed with a sigh


 XXIV


 Will you suffer me lady your thoughts to invade
 By disclosing my own The position he said
 In which we so strangely seem placed may excuse
 The frankness and force of the words which I use
 You say that your heart is your husbands You say
 That you love him You think so of course lady nay
 Such a love I admit were a merit no doubt
 But trust me no true love there can be without
 Its dread penaltyjealousy
 Well do not start
 Until noweither thanks to a singular art
 Of supreme selfcontrol you have held them all down
 Unreveald in your heartor you never have known
 Even one of those fierce irresistible pangs
 Which deep passion engenders that anguish which hangs
 On the heart like a nightmare by jealousy bred
 But if lady the love you describe in the bed
 Of a blissful security thus hath reposed
 Undisturbd with mild eyelids on happiness closed
 Were it not to expose to a peril unjust
 And most cruel that happy repose you so trust
 To meet to receive and indeed it may be
 For how long I know not continue to see
 A woman whose place rivals yours in the life
 And the heart which not only your title of wife
 But also forgive me your beauty alone
 Should have made wholly yoursYou who gave all your own
 Reflecttis the peace of existence you stake
 On the turn of a die And for whosefor his sake
 While you witness this woman the false point of view
 From which she must now be regarded by you
 Will exaggerate to you whatever they be
 The charms I admit she possesses To me
 They are trivial indeed yet to your eyes I fear
 And foresee they will true and intrinsic appear
 Selfunconscious and sweetly unable to guess
 How more lovely by far is the grace you possess
 You will wrong your own beauty The graces of art
 You will take for the natural charm of the heart
 Studied manners the brilliant and bold repartee
 Will too soon in that fatal comparison be
 To your fancy more fair than the sweet timid sense
 Which in shrinking betrays its own best eloquence
 O then lady then you will feel in your heart
 The poisonous pain of a fierce jealous dart
 While you see her yourself you no longer will see
 You will hear her and hear not yourselfyou will be
 Unhappy unhappy because you will deem
 Your own power less great than her power will seem
 And I shall not be by your side day by day
 In despite of your noble displeasure to say
 You are fairer than she as the star is more fair
 Than the diamond the brightest that beauty can wear


 XXV


 This appeal both by looks and by language increased
 The trouble Matilda felt grow in her breast
 Still she spoke with what calmness she could
 Sir the while
 I thank you she said with a faint scornful smile
 For your fervor in painting my fancied distress
 Allow me the right some surprise to express
 At the zeal you betray in disclosing to me
 The possible depth of my own misery
 That zeal would not startle you madam he said
 Could you read in my heart as myself I have read
 The peculiar interest which causes that zeal

 Matilda her terror no more could conceal
 Duke she answerd in accents short cold and severe
 As she rose from her seat I continue to hear
 But permit me to say I no more understand
 Forgive with a nervous appeal of the hand
 And a wellfeignd confusion of voice and of look
 Forgive oh forgive me at once cried the Duke
 I forgot that you know me so slightly Your leave
 I entreat from your anger those words to retrieve
 For one moment to speak of myselffor I think
 That you wrong me
 His voice as in pain seemd to sink
 And tears in his eyes as he lifted them glistend


 XXVI


 Matilda despite of herself sat and listend


 XXVII


 Beneath an exterior which seems and may be
 Worldly frivolous careless my heart hides in me
 He continued a sorrow which draws me to side
 With all things that suffer Nay laugh not he cried
 At so strange an avowal
 I seek at a ball
 For instancethe beauty admired by all
 No some plain insignificant creature who sits
 Scornd of course by the beauties and shunnd by the wits
 All the world is accustomd to wound or neglect
 Or oppress claims my heart and commands my respect
 No Quixote I do not affect to belong
 I admit to those charterd redressers of wrong
 But I seek to console where I can Tis a part
 Not brilliant I own yet its joys bring no smart
 These trite words from the tone which he gave them received
 An appearance of truth which might well be believed
 By a heart shrewder yet than Matildas
 And so
 He continued O lady alas could you know
 What injustice and wrong in this world I have seen
 How many a woman believed to have been
 Without a regret I have known turn aside
 To burst into heartbroken tears undescried
 On how many a lip have I witnessd the smile
 Which but hid what was breaking the poor heart the while
 Said Matilda Your life it would seem then must be
 One long act of devotion
 Perhaps so said he
 But at least that devotion small merit can boast
 For one day may yet comeif ONE day at the most
 When perceiving at last all the differencehow great
 Twixt the heart that neglects and the heart that can wait
 Twixt the natures that pity the natures that pain
 Some woman that else might have passd in disdain
 Or indifference by mein passing that day
 Might pause with a word or a smile to repay
 This devotionand then


 XXVIII


 To Matildas relief
 At that moment her husband approachd
 With some grief
 I must own that her welcome perchance was expressd
 The more eagerly just for one twinge in her breast
 Of a conscience disturbd and her smile not less warm
 Though she saw the Comtesse de Nevers on his arm
 The Duke turnd and adjusted his collar
 Thought he
 Good the gods fight my battle tonight I foresee
 That the family doctors the part I must play
 Very well but the patients my visits shall pay
 Lord Alfred presented Lucile to his wife
 And Matilda repressing with effort the strife
 Of emotions which made her voice shake murmurd low
 Some faint troubled greeting The Duke with a bow
 Which betokend a distant defiance replied
 To Luciles startled cry as surprised she descried
 Her former gay wooer Anon with the grace
 Of that kindness which seeks to win kindness her place
 She assumed by Matilda unconscious perchance
 Or resolved not to notice the halffrightend glance
 That followd that movement
 The Duke to his feet
 Arose and in silence relinquishd his seat
 One must own that the moment was awkward for all
 But nevertheless before long the strange thrall
 Of Luciles gracious tact was by every one felt
 And from each the reserve seemd reluctant to melt
 Thus conversing together the whole of the four
 Thro the crowd saunterd smiling


 XXIX


 Approaching the door
 Eugene de Luvois who had fallen behind
 By Lucile after some hesitation was joind
 With a gesture of gentle and kindly appeal
 Which appeard to imply without words Let us feel
 That the friendship between us in years that are fled
 Has survived one mad moment forgotten she said
 You remain Duke at Ems
 He turnd on her a look
 Of frigid resentful and sullen rebuke
 And then with a more than significant glance
 At Matilda maliciously answerd Perchance
 I have here an attraction And you he returnd
 Luciles eyes had followd his own and discernd
 The boast they implied
 He repeated And you
 And still watching Matilda she answerd I too
 And he thought as with that word she left him she sighd
 The next moment her place she resumed by the side
 Of Matilda and they soon shook hands at the gate
 Of the selfsame hotel


 XXX


 One depressd one elate
 The Duke and Lord Alfred again thro the glooms
 Of the thick linden alley returnd to the Rooms
 His cigar each had lighted a moment before
 At the inn as they turnd arminarm from the door
 Ems cigars do not cheer a mans spirits experto
 Me miserum quoties crede Roberto
 In silence awhile they walkd onward
 At last
 The Dukes thoughts to language half consciously passd

 LUVOIS

 Once more yet once more

 ALFRED

 What

 LUVOIS

 We meet her once more
 The woman for whom we two madmen of yore
 Laugh mon cher Alfred laugh were about to destroy
 Each other

 ALFRED

 It is not with laughter that I
 Raise the ghost of that once troubled time Say can you
 Recall it with coolness and quietude now

 LUVOIS

 Now yes I mon cher am a true Parisien
 Now the red revolution the tocsin and then
 The dance and the play I am now at the play

 ALFRED

 At the play are you now Then perchance I now may
 Presume Duke to ask you what ever until
 Such a moment I waited

 LUVOIS

 Oh ask what you will
 Franc jeu on the table my cards I spread out
 Ask

 ALFRED

 Duke you were called to a meeting no doubt
 You remember it yet with Lucile It was night
 When you went and before you returnd it was light
 We met you accosted me then with a brow
 Bright with triumph your words you remember them now
 Were Let us be friends

 LUVOIS

 Well

 ALFRED

 How then after that
 Can you and she meet as acquaintances

 LUVOIS

 What
 Did she not then herself the Comtesse de Nevers
 Solve your riddle tonight with those soft lips of hers

 ALFRED

 In our converse tonight we avoided the past
 But the question I ask should be answerd at last
 By you if you will if you will not by her

 LUVOIS

 Indeed but that question milord can it stir
 Such an interest in you if your passion be oer

 ALFRED

 Yes Esteem may remain although love be no more
 Lucile askd me this night to my wife understand
 To MY WIFE to present her I did so Her hand
 Has claspd that of Matilda We gentlemen owe
 Respect to the name that is ours and if so
 To the woman that bears it a twofold respect
 Answer Duc de Luvois Did Lucile then reject
 The proffer you made of your hand and your name
 Or did you on her love then relinquish a claim
 Urged before I ask bluntly this question because
 My title to do so is clear by the laws
 That all gentlemen honor Make only one sign
 That you know of Lucile de Nevers aught in fine
 For which if your own virgin sister were by
 From Lucile you would shield her acquaintance and I
 And Matilda leave Ems on the morrow


 XXXI


 The Duke
 Hesitated and paused He could tell by the look
 Of the man at his side that he meant what he said
 And there flashd in a moment these thoughts through his head
 Leave Ems would that suit me no that were again
 To mar all And besides if I do not explain
 She herself will et puis il a raison on est
 Gentilhomme avant tout He replied therefore
 Nay
 Madame de Nevers had rejected me I
 In those days I was mad and in some mad reply
 I threatened the life of the rival to whom
 That rejection was due I was led to presume
 She feard for his life and the letter which then
 She wrote me I showd you we met and again
 My hand was refused and my love was denied
 And the glance you mistook was the vizard which Pride
 Lends to Humiliation
 And so half in jest
 He went on in this best world tis all for the best
 You are wedded blessd Englishman wedded to one
 Whose past can be called into question by none
 And I fickle Frenchman can still laugh to feel
 I am lord of myself and the Mode and Lucile
 Still shines from her pedestal frigid and fair
 As yon German moon oer the lindentops there
 A Dian in marble that scorns any troth
 With the little love gods whom I thank for us both
 While she smiles from her lonely Olympus apart
 That her arrows are marble as well as her heart
 Stay at Ems Alfred Vargrave


 XXXII


 The Duke with a smile
 Turnd and enterd the Rooms which thus talking meanwhile
 They had reachd


 XXXIII


 Alfred Vargrave strode on overthrown
 Heart and mind in the darkness bewilderd alone
 And so to himself did he mutter and so
 Twas to rescue my life gentle spirit and oh
 For this did I doubt her a light worda look
 The mistake of a moment for this I forsook
 For this Pardon pardon Lucile O Lucile
 Thought and memory rang like a funeral peal
 Weary changes on one dirgelike note through his brain
 As he strayd down the darkness


 XXXIV


 Reentering again
 The Casino the Duke smiled He turned to roulette
 And sat down and playd fast and lost largely and yet
 He still smiled night deepend he playd his last number
 Went home and soon slept and still smild in his slumber


 XXXV


 In his desolate Maxims La Rochefoucauld wrote
 In the grief or mischance of a friend you may note
 There is something which always gives pleasure
 Alas
 That reflection fell short of the truth as it was
 La Rochefoucauld might have as truly set down
 No misfortune but what some one turns to his own
 Advantage its mischief no sorrow but of it
 There ever is somebody ready to profit
 No affliction without its stockjobbers who all
 Gamble speculate play on the rise and the fall
 Of another mans heart and make traffic in it
 Burn thy book O La Rochefoucauld
 Fool one mans wit
 All mens selfishness how should it fathom
 O sage
 Dost thou satirize Nature
 She laughs at thy page




CANTO II


 I


 COUSIN JOHN TO COUSIN ALFRED

 LONDON 18

 My dear Alfred
 Your last letters put me in pain
 This contempt of existence this listless disdain
 Of your own lifeits joys and its dutiesthe deuce
 Take my wits if they find for it half an excuse
 I wish that some Frenchman would shoot off your leg
 And compel you to stump through the world on a peg
 I wish that you had like myself mores the pity
 To sit seven hours on this cursed committee
 I wish that you knew sir how salt is the bread
 Of anotherwhat is it that Dante has said
 And the trouble of other mens stairs In a word
 I wish fate had some real affliction conferrd
 On your whimsical self that at least you had cause
 For neglecting lifes duties and damning its laws
 This pressure against all the purpose of life
 This selfebullition and ferment and strife
 Betokend I grant that it may be in truth
 The richness and strength of the new wine of youth
 But if when the wine should have mellowd with time
 Being bottled and binnd to a flavor sublime
 It retains the same acrid incongruous taste
 Why the sooner to throw it away that we haste
 The better I take it And this vice of snarling
 Selfloves little lapdog the overfed darling
 Of a hypochondriacal fancy appears
 To my thinking at least in a man of your years
 At the midnoon of manhood with plenty to do
 And every incentive for doing it too
 With the duties of life just sufficiently pressing
 For prayer and of joys more than most men for blessing
 With a pretty young wife and a pretty full purse
 Like poltroonery puerile truly or worse
 I wish I could get you at least to agree
 To take life as it is and consider with me
 If it be not all smiles that it is not all sneers
 It admits honest laughter and needs honest tears
 Do you think none have known but yourself all the pain
 Of hopes that retreat and regrets that remain
 And all the wide distance fate fixes no doubt
 Twixt the life thats within and the life thats without
 What one of us finds the world just as he likes
 Or gets what he wants when he wants it Or strikes
 Without missing the thing that he strikes at the first
 Or walks without stumbling Or quenches his thirst
 At one draught Bah I tell you I bachelor John
 Have had griefs of my own But what then I push on
 All the faster perchance that I yet feel the pain
 Of my last fall albeit I may stumble again
 God means every man to be happy be sure
 He sends us no sorrows that have not some cure
 Our duty down here is to do not to know
 Live as though life were earnest and life will be so
 Let each moment like Times last ambassador come
 It will wait to deliver its message and some
 Sort of answer it merits It is not the deed
 A man does but the way that he does it should plead
 For the mans compensation in doing it
 Here
 My next neighbors a man with twelve thousand a year
 Who deems that life has not a pastime more pleasant
 Than to follow a fox or to slaughter a pheasant
 Yet this fellow goes through a contested election
 Lives in London and sits like the soul of dejection
 All the day through upon a committee and late
 To the last every night through the dreary debate
 As though he were getting each speaker by heart
 Though amongst them he never presumes to take part
 One asks himself why without murmur or question
 He foregoes all his tastes and destroys his digestion
 For a labor of which the result seems so small
 The man is ambitious you say Not at all
 He has just sense enough to be fully aware
 That he never can hope to be Premier or share
 The renown of a Tullyor even to hold
 A subordinate office He is not so bold
 As to fancy the House for ten minutes would bear
 With patience his modest opinions to hear
 But he wants something
 What with twelve thousand a year
 What could Government give him would be half so dear
 To his heart as a walk with a dog and a gun
 Through his own pheasant woods or a capital run
 No but vanity fills out the emptiest brain
 The man would be more than his neighbor tis plain
 And the drudgery drearily gone through in town
 Is more than repaid by provincial renown
 Enough if some Marchioness lively and loose
 Shall have eyed him with passing complaisance the goose
 If the Fashion to him open one of its doors
 As proud as a sultan returns to his boors
 Wrong again if you think so
 For primo my friend
 Is the head of a family known from one end
 Of his shire to the other as the oldest and therefore
 He despises fine lords and fine ladies HE care for
 A peerage no truly Secondo he rarely
 Or never goes out dines at Bellamys sparely
 And abhors what you call the gay world
 Then I ask
 What inspires and consoles such a selfimposed task
 As the life of this manbut the sense of its duty
 And I swear that the eyes of the haughtiest beauty
 Have never inspired in my soul that intense
 Reverential and loving and absolute sense
 Of heartfelt admiration I feel for this man
 As I see him beside methere wearing the wan
 London daylight away on his humdrum committee
 So unconscious of all that awakens my pity
 And wonderand worship I might say
 To me
 There seems something nobler than genius to be
 In that dull patient labor no genius relieves
 That absence of all joy which yet never grieves
 The humility of it the grandeur withal
 The sublimity of it And yet should you call
 The mans own very slow apprehension to this
 He would ask with a stare what sublimity is
 His work is the duty to which he was born
 He accepts it without ostentation or scorn
 And this man is no uncommon type I thank Heaven
 Of this lands common men In all other lands even
 The types self is wanting Perchance tis the reason
 That Government oscillates ever twixt treason
 And tyranny elsewhere
 I wander away
 Too far though from what I was wishing to say
 You for instance read Plato You know that the soul
 Is immortal and put this in rhyme on the whole
 Very well with sublime illustration Mans heart
 Is a mystery doubtless You trace it in art
 The Greek Psychethats beautythe perfect ideal
 But then comes the imperfect perfectible real
 With its paind aspiration and strife In those pale
 Illdrawn virgins of Giotto you see it prevail
 You have studied all this Then the universe too
 Is not a mere house to be lived in for you
 Geology opens the mind So you know
 Something also of strata and fossils these show
 The bases of cosmical structure some mention
 Of the nebulous theory demands your attention
 And so on
 In short it is clear the interior
 Of your brain my dear Alfred is vastly superior
 In fibre and fulness and function and fire
 To that of my poor parliamentary squire
 But your life leaves upon me forgive me this heat
 Due to friendship the sense of a thing incomplete
 You fly high But what is it in truth you fly at
 My mind is not satisfied quite as to that
 An old illustrations as good as a new
 Provided the old illustration be true
 We are children Mere kites are the fancies we fly
 Though we marvel to see them ascending so high
 Things slight in themselveslongtaild toys and no more
 What is it that makes the kite steadily soar
 Through the realms where the cloud and the whirlwind have birth
 But the tie that attaches the kite to the earth
 I remember the lessons of childhood you see
 And the hornbook I learnd on my poor mothers knee
 In truth I suspect little else do we learn
 From this great book of life which so shrewdly we turn
 Saving how to apply with a good or bad grace
 What we learnd in the hornbook of childhood
 Your case
 Is exactly in point
 Fly your kite if you please
 Out of sight let it go where it will on the breeze
 But cut not the one thread by which it is bound
 Be it never so high to this poor human ground
 No man is the absolute lord of his life
 You my friend have a home and a sweet and dear wife
 If I often have sighd by my own silent fire
 With the sense of a sometimes recurring desire
 For a voice sweet and low or a face fond and fair
 Some dull winter evening to solace and share
 With the love which the world its good children allows
 To shake hands within short a legitimate spouse
 This thought has consoled me At least I have given
 For my own good behavior no hostage to heaven
 You have though Forget it not faith if you do
 I would rather break stones on a road than be you
 If any man wilfully injured or led
 That little girl wrong I would sit on his head
 Even though you yourself were the sinner
 And this
 Leads me back do not take it dear cousin amiss
 To the matter I meant to have mentiond at once
 But these thoughts put it out of my head for the nonce
 Of all the preposterous humbugs and shams
 Of all the old wolves ever taken for lambs
 The wolf best received by the flock he devours
 Is that uncleinlaw my dear Alfred of yours
 At least this has long been my unsettled conviction
 And I almost would venture at once the prediction
 That before very longbut no matter I trust
 For his sake and our own that I may be unjust
 But Heaven forgive me if cautious I am on
 The score of such men as with both God and Mammon
 Seem so shrewdly familiar
 Neglect not this warning
 There were rumors afloat in the City this morning
 Which I scarce like the sound of Who knows would he fleece
 At a pinch the old hypocrite even his own niece
 For the sake of Matilda I cannot importune
 Your attention too early If all your wifes fortune
 Is yet in the hands of that specious old sinner
 Who would dice with the devil and yet rise up winner
 I say lose no time get it out of the grab
 Of her trustee and uncle Sir Ridley McNab
 I trust those deposits at least are drawn out
 And safe at this moment from danger or doubt
 A wink is as good as a nod to the wise
 Verbum sap I admit nothing yet justifies
 My mistrust but I have in my own mind a notion
 That old Ridleys white waistcoat and airs of devotion
 Have long been the only ostensible capital
 On which he does business If so time must sap it all
 Sooner or later Look sharp Do not wait
 Draw at once In a fortnight it may be too late
 I admit I know nothing I can but suspect
 I give you my notions Form yours and reflect
 My love to Matilda Her mother looks well
 I saw her last week I have nothing to tell
 Worth your hearing We think that the Government here
 Will not last our next session Fitz Funk is a peer
 You will see by the Times There are symptoms which show
 That the ministers now are preparing to go
 And finish their feast of the loaves and the fishes
 It is evident that they are clearing the dishes
 And cramming their pockets with bonbons Your news
 Will be always acceptable Vere of the Blues
 Has bolted with Lady Selina And so
 You have met with that hotheaded Frenchman I know
 That the man is a sad mauvais sujet Take care
 Of Matilda I wish I could join you both there
 But before I am free you are sure to be gone
 Goodby my dear fellow Yours anxiously
 JOHN


 II


 This is just the advice I myself would have given
 To Lord Alfred had I been his cousin which Heaven
 Be praised I am not But it reachd him indeed
 In an unlucky hour and received little heed
 A halflanguid glance was the most that he lent at
 That time to these homilies Primum dementat
 Quem Deus vult perdere Alfred in fact
 Was behaving just then in a way to distract
 Jobs self had Job known him The more youd have thought
 The Dukes court to Matilda his eye would have caught
 The more did his aspect grow listless to hers
 And the more did it beam to Lucile de Nevers
 And Matilda the less she found love in the look
 Of her husband the less did she shrink from the Duke
 With each day that passd oer them they each heart from heart
 Woke to feel themselves further and further apart
 More and more of his time Alfred passd at the table
 Played high and lost more than to lose he was able
 He grew feverish querulous absent perverse
 And here I must mention what made matters worse
 That Lucile and the Duke at the selfsame hotel
 With the Vargraves resided It needs not to tell
 That they all saw too much of each other The weather
 Was so fine that it brought them each day all together
 In the garden to listen of course to the band
 The house was a sort of phalanstery and
 Lucile and Matilda were pleased to discover
 A mutual passion for music Moreover
 The Duke was an excellent tenor could sing
 Ange si pure in a way to bring down on the wing
 All the angels St Cicely playd to My lord
 Would also at times when he was not too bored
 Play Beethoven and Wagners new music not ill
 With some little things of his own showing skill
 For which reason as well as for some others too
 Their rooms were a pleasant enough rendezvous
 Did Lucile then encourage the heartless coquette
 All the mischief she could not but mark
 Patience yet

 III


 In that garden an arbor withdrawn from the sun
 By laburnum and lilac with blooms overrun
 Formd a vault of cool verdure which made when the heat
 Of the noontide hung heavy a gracious retreat
 And here with some friends of their own little world
 In the warm afternoons till the shadows uncurld
 From the feet of the lindens and crept through the grass
 Their blue hours would this gay little colony pass
 The men loved to smoke and the women to bring
 Undeterrd by tobacco their work there and sing
 Or converse till the dew fell and homeward the bee
 Floated heavy with honey Towards eve there was tea
 A luxury due to Matilda and ice
 Fruit and coffee Greek text omitted
 Such an evening it was while Matilda presided
 Oer the rustic arrangements thus daily provided
 With the Duke and a small German Prince with a thick head
 And an old Russian Countess both witty and wicked
 And two Austrian Colonelsthat Alfred who yet
 Was lounging alone with his last cigarette
 Saw Lucile de Nevers by herself pacing slow
 Neath the shade of the cool lindentrees to and fro
 And joining her cried Thank the good stars we meet
 I have so much to say to you
 Yes with her sweet
 Serene voice she replied to him Yes and I too
 Was wishing indeed to say somewhat to you
 She was paler just then than her wont was The sound
 Of her voice had within it a sadness profound
 You are ill he exclaimd
 No she hurriedly said
 No no
 You alarm me
 She droopd down her head
 If your thoughts have of late sought or cared to divine
 The purpose of what has been passing in mine
 My farewell can scarcely alarm you

 ALFRED

 Lucile
 Your farewell you go

 LUCILE

 Yes Lord Alfred

 ALFRED

 Reveal
 The cause of this sudden unkindness

 LUCILE

 Unkind

 ALFRED

 Yes what else is this parting

 LUCILE

 No no are you blind
 Look into your own heart and home Can you see
 No reason for this save unkindness in me
 Look into the eyes of your wifethose true eyes
 Too pure and too honest in aught to disguise
 The sweet soul shining through them

 ALFRED

 Lucile first and last
 Be the word if you will let me speak of the past
 I know now alas though I know it too late
 What passd at that meeting which settled my fate
 Nay nay interrupt me not yet let it be
 I but say what is due to yourselfdue to me
 And must say it
 He rushed incoherently on
 Describing how lately the truth he had known
 To explain how and whence he had wrongd her before
 All the complicate coil wound about him of yore
 All the hopes that had flown with the faith that was fled
 And then O Lucile what was left me he said
 When my life was defrauded of you but to take
 That life as twas left and endeavor to make
 Unobserved by another the void which remaind
 Unconceald to myself If I have not attaind
 I have striven One word of unkindness has never
 Passd my lips to Matilda Her least wish has ever
 Received my submission And if of a truth
 I have faild to renew what I felt in my youth
 I at least have been loyal to what I DO feel
 Respect duty honor affection Lucile
 I speak not of love now nor loves long regret
 I would not offend you nor dare I forget
 The ties that are round me But may there not be
 A friendship yet hallowd between you and me
 May we not be yet friendsfriends the dearest
 Alas
 She replied for one moment perchance did it pass
 Through my own heart that dream which forever hath brought
 To those who indulge it in innocent thought
 So fatal an evil awaking But no
 For in lives such as ours are the Dreamtree would grow
 On the borders of Hades beyond it what lies
 The wheel of Ixion alas and the cries
 Of the lost and tormented Departed for us
 Are the days when with innocence we could discuss
 Dreams like these Fled indeed are the dreams of my life
 Oh trust me the best friend you have is your wife
 And Iin that pure childs pure virtue I bow
 To the beauty of virtue I felt on my brow
 Not one blush when I first took her hand With no blush
 Shall I clasp it tonight when I leave you
 Hush hush
 I would say what I wishd to have said when you came
 Do not think that years leave us and find us the same
 The woman you knew long ago long ago
 Is no more You yourself have within you I know
 The germ of a joy in the years yet to be
 Whereby the past years will bear fruit As for me
 I go my own wayonward upward
 O yet
 Let me thank you for that which ennobled regret
 When it came as it beautified hope ere it fled
 The love I once felt for you True it is dead
 But it is not corrupted I too have at last
 Lived to learn that love is notsuch love as is past
 Such love as youth dreams of at leastthe sole part
 Of life which is able to fill up the heart
 Even that of a woman
 Between you and me
 Heaven fixes a gulf over which you must see
 That our guardian angels can bear us no more
 We each of us stand on an opposite shore
 Trust a womans opinion for once Women learn
 By an instinct men never attain to discern
 Each others true natures Matilda is fair
 Matilda is youngsee her now sitting there
 How tenderly fashiondoh is she not say
 To love and be loved


 IV


 He turnd sharply away
 Matilda is young and Matilda is fair
 Of all that you tell me pray deem me aware
 But Matildas a statue Matildas a child
 Matilda loves not
 Lucile quietly smiled
 As she answerd himYesterday all that you say
 Might be true it is false wholly false though today
 Howwhat mean you
 I mean that today she replied
 The statue with life has become vivified
 I mean that the child to a woman has grown
 And that woman is jealous
 What she with a tone
 Of ironical wonder he answerdwhat she
 She jealousMatildaof whom praynot me
 My lord you deceive yourself no one but you
 Is she jealous of Trust me And thank Heaven too
 That so lately this passion within her hath grown
 For who shall declare if for months she had known
 What for days she has known all too keenly I fear
 That knowledge perchance might have cost you more dear

 Explain explain madam he cried in surprise
 And terror and anger enkindled his eyes
 How blind are you men she replied Can you doubt
 That a woman young fair and neglected
 Speak out
 He gaspd with emotion Lucile you meanwhat
 Do you doubt her fidelity
 Certainly not
 Listen to me my friend What I wish to explain
 Is so hard to shape forth I could almost refrain
 From touching a subject so fragile However
 Bear with me awhile if I frankly endeavor
 To invade for one moment your innermost life
 Your honor Lord Alfred and that of your wife
 Are dear to memost dear And I am convinced
 That you rashly are risking that honor
 He winced
 And turnd pale as she spoke
 She had aimd at his heart
 And she saw by his sudden and terrified start
 That her aim had not missd
 Stay Lucile he exclaimd
 What in truth do you mean by these words vaguely framed
 To alarm me Matildamy wifedo you know

 I know that your wife is as spotless as snow
 But I know not how far your continued neglect
 Her nature as well as her heart might affect
 Till at last by degrees that serene atmosphere
 Of her unconscious purity faint and yet dear
 Like the indistinct golden and vaporous fleece
 Which surrounded and hid the celestials in Greece
 From the glances of men would disperse and depart
 At the sighs of a sick and delirious heart
 For jealousy is to a woman be sure
 A disease heald too oft by a criminal cure
 And the heart left too long to its ravage in time
 May find weakness in virtue reprisal in crime


 V


 Such thoughts could have never he falterd I know
 Reachd the heart of Matilda
 Matilda oh no
 But reflect when such thoughts do not come of themselves
 To the heart of a woman neglected like elves
 That seek lonely placesthere rarely is wanting
 Some voice at her side with an evil enchanting
 To conjure them to her
 O lady beware
 At this moment around me I search everywhere
 For a clew to your words
 You mistake them she said
 Half fearing indeed the effect they had made
 I was putting a mere hypothetical case
 With a long look of trouble he gazed in her face
 Woe to him he exclaimd woe to him that shall feel
 Such a hope for I swear if he did but reveal
 One glimpseit should be the last hope of his life
 The clenchd hand and bent eyebrow betokend the strife
 She had roused in his heart
 You forget she began
 That you menace yourself You yourself are the man
 That is guilty Alas must it ever be so
 Do we stand in our own light wherever we go
 And fight our own shadows forever O think
 The trial from which you the stronger ones shrink
 You ask woman the weaker one still to endure
 You bid her be true to the laws you abjure
 To abide by the ties you yourselves rend asunder
 With the force that has faild you and that too when under
 The assumption of rights which to her you refuse
 The immunity claimd for yourselves you abuse
 Where the contract exists it involves obligation
 To both husband and wife in an equal relation
 You unloose in asserting your own liberty
 A knot which unloosed leaves another as free
 Then O Alfred be juster at heart and thank Heaven
 That Heaven to your wife such a nature has given
 That you have not wherewith to reproach her albeit
 You have cause to reproach your own self could you see it


 VI


 In the silence that followd the last word she said
 In the heave of his chest and the droop of his head
 Poor Lucile markd her words had sufficed to impart
 A new germ of motion and life to that heart
 Of which he himself had so recently spoken
 As dead to emotionexhausted or broken
 New fears would awaken new hopes in his life
 In the husband indifferent no more to the wife
 She already as she had foreseen could discover
 That Matilda had gaind at her hands a new lover
 So after some moments of silence whose spell
 They both felt she extended her hand to him


 VII

 Well


 VIII


 Lucile he replied as that soft quiet hand
 In his own he claspd warmly I both understand
 And obey you
 Thank Heaven she murmurd
 O yet
 One word I beseech you I cannot forget
 He exclaimd we are parting for life You have shown
 My pathway to me but say what is your own
 The calmness with which until then she had spoken
 In a moment seemd strangely and suddenly broken
 She turnd from him nervously hurriedly
 Nay
 I know not she murmurd I follow the way
 Heaven leads me I cannot foresee to what end
 I know only that far far away it must tend
 From all places in which we have met or might meet
 Far awayonward upward
 A smile strange and sweet
 As the incense that rises from some sacred cup
 And mixes with music stole forth and breathed up
 Her whole face with those words
 Wheresoever it be
 May all gentlest angels attend you sighed he
 And bear my hearts blessing wherever you are
 And her hand with emotion he kissd


 IX


 From afar
 That kiss was alas by Matilda beheld
 With far other emotions her young bosom swelld
 And her young cheek with anger was crimsond
 The Duke
 Adroitly attracted towards it her look
 By a faint but significant smile


 X


 Much illconstrued
 Renownd Bishop Berkeley has fully for one strewd
 With arguments page upon page to teach folks
 That the world they inhabit is only a hoax
 But it surely is hard since we cant do without them
 That our senses should make us so oft wish to doubt them




CANTO III


 I


 When first the red savage calld Man strode a king
 Through the wilds of creationthe very first thing
 That his naked intelligence taught him to feel
 Was the shame of himself and the wish to conceal
 Was the first step in art From the apron which Eve
 In Eden sat down out of figleaves to weave
 To the furbelowd flounce and the broad crinoline
 Of my ladyyou all know of course whom I mean
 This art of concealment has greatly increasd
 A whole world lies cryptic in each human breast
 And that drama of passions as old as the hills
 Which the moral of all men in each man fulfils
 Is only reveald now and then to our eyes
 In the newspaperfiles and the courts of assize


 II


 In the group seen so lately in sunlight assembled
 Mid those walks over which the laburnumbough trembled
 And the deepbosomd lilac emparadising
 The haunts where the blackbird and thrush flit and sing
 The keenest eye could but have seen and seen only
 A circle of friends minded not to leave lonely
 The bird on the bough or the bee on the blossom
 Conversing at ease in the gardens green bosom
 Like those who when Florence was yet in her glories
 Cheated death and killd time with Boccaccian stories
 But at length the long twilight more deeply grew shaded
 And the fair night the rosy horizon invaded
 And the bee in the blossom the bird on the bough
 Through the shadowy garden were slumbering now
 The trees only oer every unvisited walk
 Began on a sudden to whisper and talk
 And as each little sprightly and garrulous leaf
 Woke up with an evident sense of relief
 They all seemd to be saying Once more were alone
 And thank Heaven those tiresome people are gone


 III


 Through the deep blue concave of the luminous air
 Large loving and languid the stars here and there
 Like the eyes of shy passionate women lookd down
 Oer the dim world whose sole tender light was their own
 When Matilda alone from her chamber descended
 And enterd the garden unseen unattended
 Her forehead was aching and parchd and her breast
 By a vague inexpressible sadness oppressd
 A sadness which led her she scarcely knew how
 And she scarcely knew why save indeed that just now
 The house out of which with a gasp she had fled
 Half stifled seemd ready to sink on her head
 Out into the night air the silence the bright
 Boundless starlight the cool isolation of night
 Her husband that day had lookd once in her face
 And pressd both her hands in a silent embrace
 And reproachfully noticed her recent dejection
 With a smile of kind wonder and tacit affection
 He of late so indifferent and listless at last
 Was he startled and awed by the change which had passd
 Oer the once radiant face of his young wife Whence came
 That long look of solicitous fondness the same
 Look and language of quiet affectionthe look
 And the language alas which so often she took
 For pure love in the simple repose of its purity
 Her own heart thus lulld to a fatal security
 Ha would he deceive her again by this kindness
 Had she been then O fool in her innocent blindness
 The sport of transparent illusion ah folly
 And that feeling so tranquil so happy so holy
 She had taken till then in the heart not alone
 Of her husband but also indeed in her own
 For true love nothing else after all did it prove
 But a friendship profanely familiar
 And love
 What was love then not calm not securescarcely kind
 But in one all intensest emotions combined
 Life and death pain and rapture
 Thus wandering astray
 Led by doubt through the darkness she wanderd away
 All silently crossing recrossing the night
 With faint meteoric miraculous light
 The swiftshooting stars through the infinite burnd
 And into the infinite ever returnd
 And silently oer the obscure and unknown
 In the heart of Matilda there darted and shone
 Thoughts enkindling like meteors the deeps to expire
 Leaving traces behind them of tremulous fire


 IV


 She enterd that arbor of lilacs in which
 The dark air with odors hung heavy and rich
 Like a soul that grows faint with desire
 Twas the place
 In which she so lately had sat face to face
 With her husbandand her the pale stranger detested
 Whose presence her heart like a plague had infested
 The whole spot with evil remembrance was haunted
 Through the darkness there rose on the heart which it daunted
 Each dreary detail of that desolate day
 So full and yet so incomplete Far away
 The acacias were muttering like mischievous elves
 The whole story over again to themselves
 Each wordand each word was a wound By degrees
 Her memory mingled its voice with the trees


 V


 Like the whisper Eve heard when she paused by the root
 Of the sad tree of knowledge and gazed on its fruit
 To the heart of Matilda the trees seemd to hiss
 Wild instructions revealing mans last right which is
 The right of reprisals
 An image uncertain
 And vague dimly shaped itself forth on the curtain
 Of the darkness around her It came and it went
 Through her senses a faint sense of peril it sent
 It passd and repassd her it went and it came
 Forever returning forever the same
 And forever more clearly defined till her eyes
 In that outline obscure could at last recognize
 The man to whose image the more and the more
 That her heart now aroused from its calm sleep of yore
 From her husband detachd itself slowly with pain
 Her thoughts had returnd and returnd to again
 As though by some secret indefinite law
 The vigilant FrenchmanEugene de Luvois


 VI


 A light sound behind her She trembled By some
 Nightwitchcraft her vision a fact had become
 On a sudden she felt without turning to view
 That a man was approaching behind her She knew
 By the fluttering pulse which she could not restrain
 And the quickbeating heart that this man was Eugene
 Her first instinct was flight but she felt her slight foot
 As heavy as though to the soil it had root
 And the Dukes voice retaind her like fear in a dream


 VII


 Ah lady in life there are meetings which seem
 Like a fate Dare I think like a sympathy too
 Yet what else can I bless for this vision of you
 Alone with my thoughts on this starlighted lawn
 By an instinct resistless I felt myself drawn
 To revisit the memories left in the place
 Where so lately this evening I lookd in your face
 And I findyou yourselfmy own dream
 Can there be
 In this world one thought common to you and to me
 If so I who deemd but a moment ago
 My heart uncompaniond save only by woe
 Should indeed be more blessd than I dare to believe
 Ah but ONE word but one from your lips to receive
 Interrupting him quickly she murmurd I sought
 Here a moment of solitude silence and thought
 Which I needed
 Lives solitude only for one
 Must its charm by my presence so soon be undone
 Ah cannot two share it What needs it for this
 The same thought in both heartsbe it sorrow or bliss
 If my heart be the reflex of yours ladyyou
 Are you not yet aloneeven though we be two

 For that said Matilda needs were you should read
 What I have in my heart
 Think you lady indeed
 You are yet of that age when a woman conceals
 In her heart so completely whatever she feels
 From the heart of the man whom it interests to know
 And find out what that feeling may be Ah not so
 Lady Alfred Forgive me that in it I look
 But I read in your heart as I read in a book

 Well Duke and what read you within it unless
 It be of a truth a profound weariness
 And some sadness
 No doubt To all facts there are laws
 The effect has its cause and I mount to the cause


 VIII


 Matilda shrank back for she suddenly found
 That a finger was pressd on the yet bleeding wound
 She herself had but that day perceived in her breast

 You are sad said the Duke and that finger yet pressd
 With a cruel persistence the wound it made bleed
 You are sad Lady Alfred because the first need
 Of a young and a beautiful woman is to be
 Beloved and to love You are sad for you see
 That you are not beloved as you deemd that you were
 You are sad for that knowledge hath left you aware
 That you have not yet loved though you thought that you had
 Yes yes you are sadbecause knowledge is sad

 He could not have read more profoundly her heart
 What gave you she cried with a terrified start
 Such strange power
 To read in your thoughts he exclaimd
 O ladya love deep profoundbe it blamed
 Or rejecteda love true intensesuch at least
 As you and you only could wake in my breast

 Hush hush I beseech you for pity she gaspd
 Snatching hurriedly from him the hand he had claspd
 In her effort instinctive to fly from the spot

 For pity he echoed for pity and what
 Is the pity you owe him his pity for you
 He the lord of a life fresh as newfallen dew
 The guardian and guide of a woman young fair
 And matchless whose happiness did he not swear
 To cherish through life he neglects herfor whom
 For a fairer than she No the rose in the bloom
 Of that beauty which even when hiddn can prevail
 To keep sleepless with song the aroused nightingale
 Is not fairer for even in the pure world of flowers
 Her symbol is not and this pure world of ours
 Has no second Matilda For whom Let that pass
 Tis not I tis not you that can name her alas
 And I dare not question or judge her But why
 Why cherish the cause of your own misery
 Why think of one lady who thinks not of you
 Why be bound by a chain which himself he breaks through
 And why since you have but to stretch forth your hand
 The love which you need and deserve to command
 Why shrink Why repel it
 O hush sir O hush
 Cried Matilda as though her whole heart were one blush
 Cease cease I conjure you to trouble my life
 Is not Alfred your friend and am I not his wife


 IX


 And have I not lady he answerd respected
 HIS rights as a friend till himself he neglected
 YOUR rights as a wife Do you think tis alone
 For three days I have loved you My love may have grown
 I admit day by day since I first felt your eyes
 In watching their tears and in sounding your sighs
 But O lady I loved you before I believed
 That your eyes ever wept or your heart ever grieved
 Then I deemd you were happyI deemd you possessd
 All the love you deservedand I hid in my breast
 My own love till this hourwhen I could not but feel
 Your grief gave me the right my own grief to reveal
 I knew years ago of the singular power
 Which Lucile oer your husband possessd Till the hour
 In which he revead it himself did Isay
 By a word or a look such a secret betray
 No no do me justice I never have spoken
 Of this poor heart of mine till all ties he had broken
 Which bound YOUR heart to him And nownow that his love
 For another hath left your own heart free to rove
 What is iteven nowthat I kneel to implore you
 Only this Lady Alfred to let me adore you
 Unblamed to have confidence in me to spend
 On me not one thought save to think me your friend
 Let me speak to youah let me speak to you still
 Hush to silence my words in your heart if you will
 I ask no response I ask only your leave
 To live yet in your life and to grieve when you grieve


 X


 Leave me leave me she gaspd with a voice thick and low
 From emotion For pitys sake Duke let me go
 I feel that to blame we should both of us be
 Did I linger
 To blame yes no doubt answerd he
 If the love of your husband in bringing you peace
 Had forbidden you hope But he signs your release
 By the hand of another One moment but one
 Who knows when alas I may see you alone
 As tonight I have seen you or when we may meet
 As tonight we have met when entranced at your feet
 As in this blessed hour I may ever avow
 The thoughts which are pining for utterance now
 Duke Duke she exclaimd for Heavens sake let me go
 It is late In the house they will miss me I know
 We must not be seen here together The night
 Is advancing I feel overwhelmd with affright
 It is time to return to my lord
 To your lord
 He repeated with lingering reproach on the word
 To your lord do you think he awaits you in truth
 Is he anxiously missing your presence forsooth
 Return to your lord his restraint to renew
 And hinder the glances which are not for you
 No no at this moment his looks seek the face
 Of another another is there in your place
 Another consoles him another receives
 The soft speech which from silence your absence relieves


 XI


 You mistake sir responded a voice calm severe
 And sad   You mistake sir that other is here
 Eugene and Matilda both started
 Lucile
 With a halfstifled scream as she felt herself reel
 From the place where she stood cried Matilda
 Ho oh
 What eavesdropping madam the Duke cried And so
 You were listening
 Say rather she said that I heard
 Without wishing to hear it that infamous word
 Heardand therefore reply
 Belle Comtesse said the Duke
 With concentrated wrath in the savage rebuke
 Which betrayd that he felt himself baffled you know
 That your place is not HERE
 Duke she answerd him slow
 My place is wherever my duty is clear
 And therefore my place at this moment is here
 O lady this morning my place was beside
 Your husband because as she said this she sighd
 I felt that from folly fast growing to crime
 The crime of selfblindnessHeaven yet spared me time
 To save for the love of an innocent wife
 All that such love deserved in the heart and the life
 Of the man to whose heart and whose life you alone
 Can with safety confide the pure trust of your own

 She turnd to Matilda and lightly laid on her
 Her soft quiet hand
 Tis O lady the honor
 Which that man has confided to you that in spite
 Of his friend I now trust I may yet save tonight
 Save for both of you lady for yours I revere
 Duc de Luvois what say youmy place is not here


 XII


 And so saying the hand of Matilda she caught
 Wound one arm round her waist unresisted and sought
 Gently softly to draw her away from the spot
 The Duke stood confounded and followd them not
 But not yet the house had they reachd when Lucile
 Her tender and delicate burden could feel
 Sink and falter beside her Oh then she knelt down
 Flung her arms round Matilda and pressd to her own
 The poor bosom beating against her
 The moon
 Bright breathless and buoyant and brimful of June
 Floated up from the hillside sloped over the vale
 And poised herself loose in midheaven with one pale
 Minute scintillescent and tremulous star
 Swinging under her globe like a wizardlit car
 Thus to each of those women revealing the face
 Of the other Each bore on her features the trace
 Of a vivid emotion A deep inward shame
 The cheek of Matilda had flooded with flame
 With her enthusiastic emotion Lucile
 Trembled visibly yet for she could not but feel
 That a heavenly hand was upon her that night
 And it touchd her pure brow to a heavenly light
 In the name of your husband dear lady she said
 In the name of your mother take heart Lift your head
 For those blushes are noble Alas do not trust
 To that maxim of virtue made ashes and dust
 That the fault of the husband can cancel the wifes
 Take heart and take refuge and strength in your lifes
 Pure silencethere kneel pray and hope weep and wait
 Saved Lucile sobbd Matilda but saved to what fate
 Tears prayers yes not hopes
 Hush the sweet voice replied
 Foold away by a fancy again to your side
 Must your husband return Doubt not this And return
 For the love you can give with the love that you yearn
 To receive lady What was it chilld you both now
 Not the absence of love but the ignorance how
 Love is nourishd by love Well henceforth you will prove
 Your heart worthy of lovesince it knows how to love


 XIII


 What gives you such power over me that I feel
 Thus drawn to obey you What are you Lucile
 Sighd Matilda and lifted her eyes to the face
 Of Lucile
 There passd suddenly through it the trace
 Of deep sadness and oer that fair forehead came down
 A shadow which yet was too sweet for a frown
 The pupil of sorrow perchance she replied
 Of sorrow Matilda exclaimd O confide
 To my heart your affliction In all you made known
 I should find some instruction no doubt for my own

 And I some consolation no doubt for the tears
 Of another have not flowd for me many years

 It was then that Matilda herself seized the hand
 Of Lucile in her own and uplifted her and
 Thus together they enterd the house


 XIV


 Twas the room
 Of Matilda
 The languid and delicate gloom
 Of a lamp of pure white alabaster aloft
 From the ceiling suspended around it slept soft
 The casement oped into the garden The pale
 Cool moonlight streamd through it One lone nightingale
 Sung aloof in the laurels And here side by side
 Hand in hand the two women sat down undescried
 Save by guardian angels
 As when sparkling yet
 From the rain that with drops that are jewels leaves wet
 The bright head it humbles a young rose inclines
 To some pale lily near it the fair vision shines
 As one flower with two faces in hushd tearful speech
 Like the showery whispers of flowers each to each
 Linkd and leaning together so loving so fair
 So united yet diverse the two women there
 Lookd indeed like two flowers upon one drooping stem
 In the soft light that tenderly rested on them
 All that soul said to soul in that chamber who knows
 All that heart gaind from heart
 Leave the lily the rose
 Undisturbd with their secret within them For who
 To the heart of the floweret can follow the dew
 A night full of stars Oer the silence unseen
 The footsteps of sentinel angels between
 The dark land and deep sky were moving You heard
 Passd from earth up to heaven the happy watchword
 Which brightend the stars as amongst them it fell
 From earths heart which it eased All is well all is well




CANTO IV


 I


 The Poets pour wine and when tis new all decry it
 But once let it be old every trifler must try it
 And Polonius who praises no wine thats not Massic
 Complains of my verse that my verse is not classic
 And Miss Tilburina who sings and not badly
 My earlier verses sighs Commonplace sadly

 As for you O Polonius you vex me but slightly
 But you Tilburina your eyes beam so brightly
 In despite of their languishing looks on my word
 That to see you look cross I can scarcely afford
 Yes the silliest woman that smiles on a bard
 Better far than Longinus himself can reward
 The appeal to her feelings of which she approves
 And the critics I most care to please are the Loves

 Alas friend what boots it a stone at his head
 And a brass on his breastwhen a man is once dead
 Ay were fame the sole guerdon poor guerdon were then
 Theirs who stripping life bare stand forth models for men
 The reformersa creed by posterity learnt
 A century after its author is burnt
 The poetsa laurel that hides the bald brow
 It hath blighted The paintersAsk Raphael now
 Which Madonnas authentic The statemansa name
 For parties to blacken or boys to declaim
 The soldiersthree lines on the cold Abbey pavement
 Were this all the life of the wise and the brave meant
 All it ends in thrice better Neaera it were
 Unregarded to sport with thine odorous hair
 Untroubled to lie at thy feet in the shade
 And be loved while the roses yet bloom overhead
 Than to sit by the lone hearth and think the long thought
 A severe sad blind schoolmaster envied for naught
 Save the name of John Milton For all men indeed
 Who in some choice edition may graciously read
 With fair illustration and erudite note
 The song which the poet in bitterness wrote
 Beat the poet and notably beat him in this
 The joy of the genius is theirs whilst they miss
 The grief of the man Tassos songnot his madness
 Dantes dreamsnot his waking to exile and sadness
 Miltons musicbut not Miltons blindness
 Yet rise
 My Milton and answer with those noble eyes
 Which the glory of heaven hath blinded to earth
 Saythe life in the living it savors of worth
 That the deed in the doing it reaches its aim
 That the fact has a value apart from the fame
 That a deeper delight in the mere labor pays
 Scorn of lesser delights and laborious days
 And Shakespeare though all Shakespeares writings were lost
 And his genius though never a trace of it crossed
 Posteritys path not the less would have dwelt
 In the isle with Miranda with Hamlet have felt
 All that Hamlet hath uttered and haply where pure
 On its deathbed wrongd Love lay have moand with the Moor


 II


 When Lord Alfred that night to the salon returnd
 He found it deserted The lamp dimly burnd
 As though half out of humor to find itself there
 Forced to light for no purpose a room that was bare
 He sat down by the window alone Never yet
 Did the heavens a lovelier evening beget
 Since Latonas bright childbed that bore the new moon
 The dark world lay still in a sort of sweet swoon
 Wide open to heaven and the stars on the stream
 Were trembling like eyes that are loved on the dream
 Of a lover and all things were glad and at rest
 Save the unquiet heart in his own troubled breast
 He endeavord to thinkan unwonted employment
 Which appeard to afford him no sort of enjoyment


 III


 Withdraw into yourself But if peace you seek there for
 Your reception beforehand be sure to prepare for
 Wrote the tutor of Nero who wrote be it said
 Better far than he actedbut peace to the dead
 He bled for his pupil what more could he do
 But Lord Alfred when into himself he withdrew
 Found all there in disorder For more than an hour
 He sat with his head droopd like some stubborn flower
 Beaten down by the rush of the rainwith such force
 Did the thick gushing thoughts hold upon him the course
 Of their sudden descent rapid rushing and dim
 From the cloud that had darkend the evening for him
 At one moment he roserose and opend the door
 And wistfully lookd down the dark corridor
 Toward the room of Matilda Anon with a sigh
 Of an incomplete purpose he crept quietly
 Back again to his place in a sort of submission
 To doubt and returnd to his former position
 That loose fall of the arms that dull droop of the face
 And the eye vaguely fixd on impalpable space
 The dream which till then had been lulling his life
 As once Circe the winds had seald thought and his wife
 And his home for a time he had quite like Ulysses
 Forgotten but now oer the troubled abysses
 Of the spirit within him aeolian forth leapt
 To their freedom newfound and resistlessly swept
 All his heart into tumult the thoughts which had been
 Long pent up in their mystic recesses unseen


 IV


 How long he thus sat there himself he knew not
 Till he started as though he were suddenly shot
 To the sound of a voice too familiar to doubt
 Which was making some noise in the passage without
 A sound English voice with a round English accent
 Which the scared German echoes resentfully back sent
 The complaint of a much disappointed cabdriver
 Mingled with it demanding some ultimate stiver
 Then the heavy and hurried approach of a boot
 Which reveald by its sound no diminutive foot
 And the door was flung suddenly open and on
 The threshold Lord Alfred by bachelor John
 Was seized in that sort of affectionate rage or
 Frenzy of hugs which some stout Ursa Major
 On some lean Ursa Minor would doubtless bestow
 With a warmth for which only starvation and snow
 Could render one grateful As soon as he could
 Lord Alfred contrived to escape nor be food
 Any more for those somewhat voracious embraces
 Then the two men sat down and scannd each others faces
 And Alfred could see that his cousin was taken
 With unwonted emotion The hand that had shaken
 His own trembled somewhat In truth he descried
 At a glance something wrong


 V


 Whats the matter he cried
 What have you to tell me

 JOHN

 What have you not heard

 ALFRED

 Heard what

 JOHN

 This sad business

 ALFRED

 I no not a word

 JOHN

 You received my last letter

 ALFRED

 I think so If not
 What then

 JOHN

 You have acted upon it

 ALFRED

 On what

 JOHN

 The advice that I gave you

 ALFRED

 Advicelet me see
 You ALWAYS are giving advice Jack to me
 About Parliament was it

 JOHN

 Hang Parliament no
 The Bank the Bank Alfred

 ALFRED

 What Bank

 JOHN

 Heavens I know
 You are carelessbut surely you have not forgotten
 Or neglected I warnd you the whole thing was rotten
 You have drawn those deposits at least

 ALFRED

 No I meant
 To have written today but the note shall be sent
 Tomorrow however

 JOHN

 Tomorrow too late
 Too late oh what devil bewitchd you to wait

 ALFRED

 Mercy save us you dont mean to say

 JOHN

 Yes I do

 ALFRED

 What Sir Ridley

 JOHN

 Smashd broken blown up bolted too

 ALFRED

 But his own niece In Heavens name Jack

 JOHN

 Oh I told you
 The old hypocritical scoundrel would

 ALFRED

 Hold you
 Surely cant mean we are ruind

 JOHN

 Sit down
 A fortnight ago a report about town
 Made me most apprehensive Alas and alas
 I at once wrote and warnd you Well now let that pass
 A run on the Bank about five days ago
 Confirmd my forebodings too terribly though
 I drove down to the city at once found the door
 Of the Bank close the Bank had stoppd payment at four
 Next morning the failure was known to be fraud
 Warrant out for McNab but McNab was abroad
 Gonewe cannot tell where I endeavord to get
 Information have learnd nothing certain as yet
 Not even the way that old Ridley was gone
 Or with those securities what he had done
 Or whether they had been already calld out
 If they are not their fate is I fear past a doubt
 Twenty families ruind they say what was left
 Unable to find any clew to the cleft
 The old fox ran to earth inbut join you as fast
 As I could my dear Alfred


 These events it is needless to say Mr Morse
 Took place when Bad News as yet travelld by horse
 Ere the world like a cockchafer buzzd on a wire
 Or Time was calcined by electrical fire
 Ere a cable went under the hoary Atlantic
 Or the word Telegram drove grammarians frantic


 VI


 He stoppd here aghast
 At the change in his cousin the hue of whose face
 Had grown livid and glassy his eyes fixd on space
 Courage courage said John bear the blow like a man
 And he caught the cold hand of Lord Alfred There ran
 Through that hand a quick tremor I bear it he said
 But Matilda the blow is to her And his head
 Seemd forced down as he said it

 JOHN

 Matilda Pooh pooh
 I half think I know the girl better than you
 She has courage enoughand to spare She cares less
 Than most women for luxury nonsense and dress

 ALFRED

 The fault has been mine

 JOHN

 Be it yours to repair it
 If you did not avert you may help her to bear t

 ALFRED

 I might have averted

 JOHN

 Perhaps so But now
 There is clearly no use in considering how
 Or whence came the mischief The mischief is here
 Broken shins are not mended by cryingthats clear
 One has but to rub them and get up again
 And push onand not think too much of the pain
 And at least it is much that you see that to her
 You owe too much to think of yourself You must stir
 And arouse yourself Alfred for her sake Who knows
 Something yet may be saved from this wreck I suppose
 We shall make him disgorge all he can at the least

 O Jack I have been a brute idiot a beast
 A fool I have sinnd and to HER I have sinnd
 I have been heedless blind inexcusably blind
 And now in a flash I see all things
 As though
 To shut out the vision he bowd his head low
 On his hands and the great tears in silence rolld on
 And fell momently heavily one after one
 John felt no desire to find instant relief
 For the trouble he witnessd
 He guessd in the grief
 Of his cousin the broken and heartfelt admission
 Of some error demanding a heartfelt contrition
 Some oblivion perchance which could plead less excuse
 To the heart of a man rearoused to the use
 Of the conscience God gave him than simply and merely
 The neglect for which now he was paying so dearly
 So he rose without speaking and paced up and down
 The long room much afflicted indeed in his own
 Cordial heart for Matilda
 Thus silently lost
 In his anxious reflections he crossd and recrossd
 The place where his cousin yet hopelessly hung
 Oer the table his fingers entwisted among
 The rich curls they were knotting and dragging and there
 That sound of all sounds the most painful to hear
 The sobs of a man Yet so far in his own
 Kindly thoughts was he plunged he already had grown
 Unconscious of Alfred
 And so for a space
 There was silence between them


 VII


 At last with sad face
 He stoppd short and bent on his cousin awhile
 A paind sort of wistful compassionate smile
 Approachd himstood oer himand suddenly laid
 One hand on his shoulder
 Where is she he said
 Alfred lifted his face all disfigured with tears
 And gazed vacantly at him like one that appears
 In some foreign language to hear himself greeted
 Unable to answer
 Where is she repeated
 His cousin
 He motioned his hand to the door
 There I think he replied Cousin John said no more
 And appeard to relapse to his own cogitations
 Of which not a gesture vouchsafed indications
 So again there was silence
 A timepiece at last
 Struck the twelve strokes of midnight
 Roused by them he cast
 A halflook to the dial then quietly threw
 His arm round the neck of his cousin and drew
 The hands down from his face
 It is time she should know
 What has happend he said let us go to her now
 Alfred started at once to his feet
 Drawn and wan
 Though his face he lookd more than his wont wasa man
 Strong for once in his weakness Uplifted filld through
 With a manly resolve
 If that axiom be true
 Of the Sum quia cogito I must opine
 That id sum quod cogitothat which in fine
 A man thinks and feels with his whole force of thought
 And feeling the man is himself
 He had fought
 With himself and rose up from his selfoverthrow
 The survivor of much which that strife had laid low
 At his feet as he rose at the name of his wife
 Lay in ruins the brilliant unrealized life
 Which though yet unfulfilld seemd till then in that name
 To be his had he claimd it The mans dream of fame
 And of power fell shatterd before him and only
 There rested the heart of the woman so lonely
 In all save the love he could give her The lord
 Of that heart he arose Blush not Muse to record
 That his first thought and last at that moment was not
 Of the power and fame that seemd lost to his lot
 But the love that was left to it not of the pelf
 He had cared for yet squanderd and not of himself
 But of her as he murmurd
 One moment dear jack
 We have grown up from boyhood together Our track
 Has been through the same meadows in childhood in youth
 Through the same silent gateways to manhood In truth
 There is none that can know me as you do and none
 To whom I more wish to believe myself known
 Speak the truth you are not wont to mince it I know
 Nor I shall I shirk it or shrink from it now
 In despite of a wanton behavior in spite
 Of vanity folly and pride Jack which might
 Have turnd from me many a heart strong and true
 As your own I have never turnd round and missd YOU
 From my side in one hour of affliction or doubt
 By my own blind and heedless selfwill brought about
 Tell me truth Do I owe this alone to the sake
 Of those old recollections of boyhood that make
 In your heart yet some clinging and crying appeal
 From a judgment more harsh which I cannot but feel
 Might have sentenced our friendship to death long ago
 Or is it I would I could deem it were so
 That not all overlaid by a listless exterior
 Your heart has divined in me something superior
 To that which I seem from my innermost nature
 Not wholly expelld by the worlds usurpature
 Some instinct of earnestness truth or desire
 For truth Some one spark of the souls native fire
 Moving under the ashes and cinders and dust
 Which life hath heapd oer it Some one fact to trust
 And to hope in Or by you alone am I deemd
 The mere frivolous fool I so often have seemd
 To my own self

 JOHN

 No Alfred you will I believe
 Be true at the last to what now makes you grieve
 For having belied your true nature so long
 Necessity is a stern teacher Be strong

 Do you think he resumed what I feel while I speak
 Is no more than a transient emotion as weak
 As these weak tears would seem to betoken it

 JOHN

 No

 ALFRED

 Thank you cousin your hand then And now I will go
 Alone Jack Trust to me


 VIII


 JOHN

 I do But tis late
 If she sleeps youll not wake her

 ALFRED

 No no it will wait
 Poor infant too surely this mission of sorrow
 If she sleeps I will not mar her dreams of tomorrow
 He opend the door and passd out
 Cousin John
 Watchd him wistful and left him to seek her alone


 IX


 His heart beat so loud when he knockd at her door
 He could hear no reply from within Yet once more
 He knockd lightly No answer The handle he tried
 The door opend he enterd the room undescried


 X


 No brighter than is that dim circlet of light
 Which enhaloes the moon when rains form on the night
 The pale lamp an indistinct radiance shed
 Round the chamber in which at her pure snowy bed
 Matilda was kneeling so wrapt in deep prayer
 That she knew not her husband stood watching her there
 With the lamplight the moonlight had mingled a faint
 And unearthly effulgence which seemd to acquaint
 The whole place with a sense of deep peace made secure
 By the presence of something angelic and pure
 And not purer some angel Grief carves oer the tomb
 Where Love lies than the lady that kneeld in that gloom
 She had put off her dress and she lookd to his eyes
 Like a young soul escaped from its earthly disguise
 Her fair neck and innocent shoulders were bare
 And over them rippled her soft golden hair
 Her simple and slender white bodice unlaced
 Confined not one curve of her delicate waist
 As the light that from water reflected forever
 Trembles up through the tremulous reeds of a river
 So the beam of her beauty went trembling in him
 Through the thoughts it suffused with a sense soft and dim
 Reproducing itself in the broken and bright
 Lapse and pulse of a million emotions
 That sight
 Bowd his heart bowd his knee Knowing scarce what he did
 To her side through the chamber he silently slid
 And knelt down beside herand prayd at her side


 XI


 Upstarting she then for the first time descried
 That her husband was near her suffused with the blush
 Which came oer her soft pallid cheek with a gush
 Where the tears sparkled yet
 As a young fawn uncouches
 Shy with fear from the fern where some hunter approaches
 She shrank back he caught her and circling his arm
 Round her waist on her brow pressd one kiss long and warm
 Then her fear changed in impulse and hiding her face
 On his breast she hung lockd in a clinging embrace
 With her soft arms wound heavily round him as though
 She feard if their clasp was relaxed he would go
 Her smooth naked shoulders uncared for convulsed
 By sob after sob while her bosom yet pulsed
 In its pressure on his as the effort within it
 Lived and died with each tender tumultuous minute
 O Alfred O Alfred forgive me she cried
 Forgive me
 Forgive you my poor child he sighd
 But I never have blamed you for aught that I know
 And I have not one thought that reproaches you now
 From her arms he unwound himself gently And so
 He forced her down softly beside him Below
 The canopy shading their couch they sat down
 And he said clasping firmly her hand in his own
 When a proud man Matilda has found out at length
 That he is but a child in the midst of his strength
 But a fool in his wisdom to whom can he own
 The weakness which thus to himself hath been shown
 From whom seek the strength which his need of is sore
 Although in his pride he might perish before
 He could plead for the one or the other avow
 Mid his intimate friends Wife of mine tell me now
 Do you join me in feeling in that darkend hour
 The sole friend that CAN have the right or the power
 To be at his side is the woman that shares
 His fate if he falter the woman that bears
 The name dear for HER sake and hallows the life
 She has mingled her own within short that mans wife
 Yes murmurd Matilda O yes
 Then he cried
 This chamber in which we two sit side by side
 And his arm as he spoke seemd more softly to press her
 Is now a confessionalyou my confessor
 I she falterd and timidly lifted her head
 Yes but first answer one other question he said
 When a woman once feels that she is not alone
 That the heart of another is warmd by her own
 That another feels with her whatever she feel
 And halves her existence in woe or in weal
 That a man for her sake will so long as he lives
 Live to put forth the strength which the thought of her gives
 Live to shield her from want and to share with her sorrow
 Live to solace the day and provide for the morrow
 Will that woman feel less than another O say
 The loss of what life sparing this takes away
 Will she feel feeling this when calamities come
 That they brighten the heart though they darken the home
 She turnd like a soft rainy heavn on him
 Eyes that smiled through fresh tears trustful tender and dim
 That woman she murmurd indeed were thrice blest
 Then courage true wife of my heart to his breast
 As he folded and gatherd her closely he cried
 For the refuge tonight in these arms opend wide
 To your heart can be never closed to it again
 And this room is for both an asylum For when
 I passd through that door at the door I left there
 A calamity sudden and heavy to bear
 One step from that threshold and daily I fear
 We must face it henceforth but it enters not here
 For that door shuts it out and admits here alone
 A heart which calamity leaves all your own
 She started Calamity Alfred to you
 To both my poor child but twill bring with it too
 The courage I trust to subdue it
 O speak
 Speak she falterd in tones timid anxious and weak
 O yet for a moment he said hear me on
 Matilda this morn we went forth in the sun
 Like those children of sunshine the bright summer flies
 That sport in the sunbeam and play through the skies
 While the skies smile and heed not each other at last
 When their sunbeam is gone and their sky overcast
 Who recks in what ruin they fold their wet wings
 So indeed the morn found uspoor frivolous things
 Now our sky is oercast and our sunbeam is set
 And the night brings its darkness around us Oh yet
 Have we weatherd no storm through those twelve cloudless hours
 Yes you too have wept
 While the world was yet ours
 While its sun was upon us its incense streamd to us
 And its myriad voices of joy seemd to woo us
 We strayd from each other too far it may be
 Nor wantonly wandering then did I see
 How deep was my need of thee dearest how great
 Was thy claim on my heart and thy share in my fate
 But Matilda an angel was near us meanwhile
 Watching oer us to warn and to rescue
 That smile
 Which you saw with suspicion that presence you eyed
 With resentment an angels they were at your side
 And at mine nor perchance is the day all so far
 When we both in our prayers when most heartfelt they are
 May murmur the name of that woman now gone
 From our sight evermore
 Here this evening alone
 I seek your forgiveness in opening my heart
 Unto yoursfrom this clasp be it never to part
 Matilda the fortune you brought me is gone
 But a prize richer far than that fortune has won
 It is yours to confer and I kneel for that prize
 Tis the heart of my wife With suffused happy eyes
 She sprang from her seat flung her arms wide apart
 And tenderly closing them round him his heart
 Claspd in one close embrace to her bosom and there
 Droopd her head on his shoulder and sobbd
 Not despair
 Not sorrow not even the sense of her loss
 Flowd in those happy tears so oblivious she was
 Of all save the sense of her own love Anon
 However his words rushd back to her All gone
 The fortune you brought me
 And eyes that were dim
 With soft tears she upraised but those tears were for HIM
 Gone my husband she said tell me all see I need
 To sober this rapture so selfish indeed
 Fuller sense of affliction
 Poor innocent child
 He kissd her fair forehead and mournfully smiled
 As he told her the tale he had heardsomething more
 The gain found in loss of what gain lost of yore
 Rest my heart and my brain and my right hand for you
 And with these my Matilda what may I not do
 And know not I knew not myself till this hour
 Which so sternly reveald it my natures full power
 And I too she murmurd I too am no more
 The mere infant at heart you have known me before
 I have sufferd since then I have learnd much in life
 O take with the faith I have pledged as a wife
 The heart I have learnd as a woman to feel
 For Ilove you my husband
 As though to conceal
 Less from him than herself what that motion expressd
 She droppd her bright head and hid all on his breast
 O lovely as woman beloved as wife
 Evening star of my heart light forever my life
 If from eyes fixd too long on this base earth thus far
 You have missd your due homage dear guardian star
 Believe that uplifting those eyes unto heaven
 There I see you and know you and bless the light given
 To lead me to lifes late achievement my own
 My blessing my treasure my all things in one


 XII


 How lovely she lookd in the lovely moonlight
 That streamd thro the pane from the blue balmy night
 How lovely she lookd in her own lovely youth
 As she clung to his side full of trust and of truth
 How lovely to HIM as he tenderly pressd
 Her young head on his bosom and sadly caressd
 The glittering tresses which now shaken loose
 Showerd gold in his hand as he smoothd them


 XIII


 O Muse
 Interpose not one pulse of thine own beating heart
 Twixt these two silent souls Theres a joy beyond art
 And beyond sound the music it makes in the breast


 XIV


 Here were lovers twice wed that were happy at least
 No music save such as the nightingales sung
 Breathd their bridals abroad and no cresset uphung
 Lit that festival hour save what soft light was given
 From the pure stars that peopled the deeppurple heaven
 He opend the casement he led her with him
 Hushd in heart to the terrace dippd cool in the dim
 Lustrous gloom of the shadowy laurels They heard
 Aloof the invisible rapturous bird
 With her wild note bewildering the woodlands they saw
 Not unheard afar off the hillrivulet draw
 His long ripple of moonkindled wavelets with cheer
 From the throat of the vale oer the dark sapphire sphere
 The mild multitudinous lights lay asleep
 Pastured free on the midnight and bright as the sheep
 Of Apollo in pastoral Thrace from unknown
 Hollow glooms freshend odors around them were blown
 Intermittingly then the moon droppd from their sight
 Immersed in the mountains and put out the light
 Which no longer they needed to read on the face
 Of each other lifes last revelation
 The place
 Slept sumptuous round them and Nature that never
 Sleeps but waking reposes with patient endeavor
 Continued about them unheeded unseen
 Her old quiet toil in the heart of the green
 Summer silence preparing new buds for new blossoms
 And stealing a finger of change oer the bosoms
 Of the unconscious woodlands and Time that halts not
 His forces how lovely soever the spot
 Where their march liesthe wary gray strategist Time
 With the armies of Life lay encampdGrief and Crime
 Love and Faith in the darkness unheeded maturing
 For his great war with man new surprises securing
 All outlets pursuing and pushing his foe
 To his last narrow refugethe grave


 XV


 Sweetly though
 Smiled the stars like new hopes out of heaven and sweetly
 Their hearts beat thanksgiving for all things completely
 Confiding in that yet untrodden existence
 Over which they were pausing Tomorrow resistance
 And struggle tonight Love his hallowd device
 Hung forth and proclaimd his serene armistice




CANTO V


 I


 When Lucile left Matilda she sat for long hours
 In her chamber fatigued by long overwrought powers
 Mid the signs of departure about to turn back
 To her old vacant life on her old homeless track
 She felt her heart falter within her She sat
 Like some poor player gazing dejectedly at
 The insignia of royalty worn for a night
 Exhausted fatigued with the dazzle and light
 And the effort of passionate feigning who thinks
 Of her own meagre rushlighted garret and shrinks
 From the chill of the change that awaits her


 II

 From these
 Oppressive and comfortless blank reveries
 Unable to sleep she descended the stair
 That led from her room to the garden
 The air
 With the chill of the dawn yet unrisn but at hand
 Strangely smote on her feverish forehead The land
 Lay in darkness and change like a world in its grave
 No sound save the voice of the long river wave
 And the crickets that sing all the night
 She stood still
 Vaguely watching the thin cloud that curld on the hill
 Emotions long pent in her breast were at stir
 And the deeps of the spirit were troubled in her
 Ah pale woman what with that heartbroken look
 Didst thou read then in natures weird heartbreaking book
 Have the wild rains of heaven a father and who
 Hath in pity begotten the drops of the dew
 Orion Arcturus who pilots them both
 What leads forth in his season the bright Mazaroth
 Hath the darkness a dwellingsave there in those eyes
 And what name hath that halfreveald hope in the skies
 Ay question and listen What answer
 The sound
 Of the long river wave through its stonetroubled bound
 And the crickets that sing all the night
 There are hours
 Which belong to unknown supernatural powers
 Whose sudden and solemn suggestions are all
 That to this race of wormsstinging creatures that crawl
 Lie and fear and die daily beneath their own stings
 Can excuse the blind boast of inherited wings
 When the soul on the impulse of anguish hath passd
 Beyond anguish and risen into rapture at last
 When she traverses nature and space till she stands
 In the Chamber of Fate where through tremulous hands
 Hum the threads from an oldfashiond distaff uncurld
 And those three blind old women sit spinning the world


 III


 The dark was blanchd wan overhead One green star
 Was slipping from sight in the pale void afar
 The spirits of change and of awe with faint breath
 Were shifting the midnight above and beneath
 The spirits of awe and of change were around
 And about and upon her
 A dull muffled sound
 And a hand on her hand like a ghostly surprise
 And she felt herself fixd by the hot hollow eyes
 Of the Frenchman before her those eyes seemed to burn
 And scorch out the darkness between them and turn
 Into fire as they fixd her He lookd like the shade
 Of a creature by fancy some solitude made
 And sent forth by the darkness to scare and oppress
 Some soul of a monk in a waste wilderness


 IV


 At last thenat last and aloneI and thou
 Lucile de Nevers have we met
 Hush I know
 Not for me was the tryst Never mindit is mine
 And whatever led hither those proud steps of thine
 They remove not until we have spoken My hour
 Is come and it holds me and thee in its power
 As the darkness holds both the horizons Tis well
 The timidest maiden that eer to the spell
 Of her first lovers vows listend hushd with delight
 When soft stars were brightly uphanging the night
 Never listend I swear more unquestioningly
 Than thy fate hath compelld thee to listen to me
 To the sound of his voice as though out of a dream
 She appeard with a start to awaken
 The stream
 When he ceased took the night with its moaning again
 Like the voices of spirits departing in pain
 Continue she answerd I listen to hear
 For a moment he did not reply
 Through the drear
 And dim light between them she saw that his face
 Was disturbd To and fro he continued to pace
 With his arms folded close and the low restless stride
 Of a panther in circles around her first wide
 Then narrower nearer and quicker At last
 He stood still and one long look upon her he cast
 Lucile dost thou dare to look into my face
 Is the sight so repugnant ha well canst thou trace
 One word of thy writing in this wicked scroll
 With thine own name scrawld through it defacing a soul
 In his face there was something so wrathful and wild
 That the sight of it scared her
 He saw it and smiled
 And then turnd him from her renewing again
 That short restless stride as though searching in vain
 For the point of some purpose within him
 Lucile
 You shudder to look in my face do you feel
 No reproach when you look in your own heart
 No Duke
 In my conscience I do not deserve your rebuke
 Not yours she replied
 No he mutterd again
 Gentle justice you first bid Life hope not and then
 To Despair you say Act not


 V


 He watchd her awhile
 With a chill sort of restless and suffering smile
 They stood by the wall of the garden The skies
 Dark sombre were troubled with vague prophecies
 Of the dawn yet far distant The moon had long set
 And all in a glimmering light pale and wet
 With the nightdews the white roses sullenly loomd
 Round about her She spoke not At length he resumed
 Wrecked creatures we are I and thouone and all
 Only able to injure each other and fall
 Soon or late in that void which ourselves we prepare
 For the souls that we boast of weak insects we are
 O heaven and what has become of them all
 Those instincts of Eden surviving the Fall
 That glorious faith in inherited things
 That sense in the soul of the length of her wings
 Gone all gone and the wail of the night wind sounds human
 Bewailing those once nightly visitants Woman
 Woman what hast thou done with my youth Give again
 Give me back the young heart that I gave thee in vain
 Duke she falterd
 Yes yes he went on I was not
 Always thus what I once was I have not forgot


 VI


 As the wind that heaps sand in a desert there stirrd
 Through his voice an emotion that swept every word
 Into one angry wail as with feverish change
 He continued his monologue fitful and strange
 Woe to him in whose nature once kindled the torch
 Of Passion burns downward to blacken and scorch
 But shame shame and sorrow O woman to thee
 Whose hand sowd the seed of destruction in me
 Whose lip taught the lesson of falsehood to mine
 Whose looks made me doubt lies that lookd so divine
 My soul by thy beauty was slain in its sleep
 And if tears I mistrust tis that thou too canst weep
 Well how utter soever it be one mistake
 In the love of a man what more change need it make
 In the steps of his soul through the course love began
 Than all other mistakes in the life of a man
 And I said to myself I am young yet too young
 To have wholly survived my own portion among
 The great needs of mans life or exhausted its joys
 What is broken one only of youths pleasant toys
 Shall I be the less welcome wherever I go
 For one passion survived No the roses will blow
 As of yore as of yore will the nightingales sing
 Not less sweetly for one blossom cancelld from Spring
 Hast thou loved O my heart to thy love yet remains
 All the wide lovingkindness of nature The plains
 And the hills with each summer their verdure renew
 Wouldst thou be as they are do thou then as they do
 Let the dead sleep in peace Would the living divine
 Where they slumber Let only new flowers be the sign

 Vain all vain For when laughing the wine I would quaff
 I rememberd too well all it cost me to laugh
 Through the revel it was but the old song I heard
 Through the crowd the old footsteps behind me they stirrd
 In the nightwind the starlight the murmurs of even
 In the ardors of earth and the languors of heaven
 I could trace nothing more nothing more through the spheres
 But the sound of old sobs and the track of old tears
 It was with me the night long in dreaming or waking
 It abided in loathing when daylight was breaking
 The burthen of the bitterness in me Behold
 All my days were become as a tale that is told
 And I said to my sight No good thing shalt thou see
 For the noonday is turned to darkness in me
 In the house of Oblivion my bed I have made
 And I said to the grave Lo my father and said
 To the worm Lo my sister The dust to the dust
 And one end to the wicked shall be with the just


 VII


 He ceased as a wind that wails out on the night
 And moans itself mute Through the indistinct light
 A voice clear and tender and pure with a tone
 Of ineffable pity replied to his own
 And say you and deem you that I wreckd your life
 Alas Duc de Luvois had I been your wife
 By a fraud of the heart which could yield you alone
 For the love in your nature a lie in my own
 Should I not in deceiving have injured you worse
 Yes I then should have merited justly your curse
 For I then should have wrongd you
 Wrongd ah is it so
 You could never have loved me
 Duke
 Never oh no
 He broke into a fierce angry laugh as he said
 Yet lady you knew that I loved you you led
 My love on to lay to its heart hour by hour
 All the pale cruel beautiful passionless power
 Shut up in that cold face of yours was this well
 But enough not on you would I vent the wild hell
 Which has grown in my heart Oh that man first and last
 He tramples in triumph my life he has cast
 His shadow twixt me and the sun let it pass
 My hate yet may find him
 She murmurd Alas
 These words at least spare me the pain of reply
 Enough Duc de Luvois farewell I shall try
 To forget every word I have heard every sight
 That has grieved and appalld me in this wretched night
 Which must witness our final farewell May you Duke
 Never know greater cause your own heart to rebuke
 Than mine thus to wrong and afflict you have had
 Adieu
 Stay Lucile stay he groaned I am mad
 Brutalized blind with pain I know not what I said
 I mean it not But he moand drooping his head
 Forgive me Ihave I so wrongd you Lucile
 I have I forgive me forgive me
 I feel
 Only sad very sad to the soul she said far
 Far too sad for resentment
 Yet stand as you are
 One moment he murmurd I think could I gaze
 Thus awhile on your face the old innocent days
 Would come back upon me and this scorching heart
 Free itself in hot tears Do not do not depart
 Thus Lucile stay one moment I know why you shrink
 Why you shudder I read in your face what you think
 Do not speak to me of it And yet if you will
 Whatever you say my own lips shall be still
 I lied And the truth now could justify nought
 There are battles it may be in which to have fought
 Is more shameful than simply to fail Yet Lucile
 Had you helpd me to bear what you forced me to feel
 Could I help you she murmurd but what can I say
 That your life will respond to My life he sighd Nay
 My life hath brought forth only evil and there
 The wild wind hath planted the wild weed yet ere
 You exclaim Fling the weed to the flames think again
 Why the field is so barren With all other men
 First love though it perish from life only goes
 Like the primrose that falls to make way for the rose
 For a man at least most men may love on through life
 Love in fame love in knowledge in work earth is rife
 With labor and therefor with love for a man
 If one love fails another succeeds and the plan
 Of mans life includes love in all objects But I
 All such loves from my life through its whole destiny
 Fate excluded The love that I gave you alas
 Was the sole love that life gave to me Let that pass
 It perishd and all perishd with it Ambition
 Wealth left nothing to add to my social condition
 Fame But fame in itself presupposes some great
 Field wherein to pursue and attain it The State
 I to cringe to an upstart The Camp I to draw
 From its sheath the old sword of the Dukes of Luvois
 To defend usurpation Books then Science Art
 But alas I was fashiond for action my heart
 Witherd thing though it be I should hardly compress
 Twixt the leaves of a treatise on Statics lifes stress
 Needs scope not contraction what rests to wear out
 At some dark northern court an existence no doubt
 In wretched and paltry intrigues for a cause
 As hopeless as is my own life By the laws
 Of a fate I can neither control nor dispute
 I am what I am


 VIII


 For a while she was mute
 Then she answerd We are our own fates Our own deeds
 Are our doomsmen Mans life was made not for mens creeds
 But mens actions And Duc de Luvois I might say
 That all life attests that the will makes the way
 Is the land of our birth less the land of our birth
 Or its claim the less strong or its cause the less worth
 Our upholding because the white lily no more
 Is as sacred as all that it bloomd for of yore
 Yet be that as it may be I cannot perchance
 Judge this matter I am but a woman and France
 Has for me simpler duties Large hope though Eugene
 De Luvois should be yours There is purpose in pain
 Otherwise it were devilish I trust in my soul
 That the great master hand which sweeps over the whole
 Of this deep harp of life if at moments it stretch
 To shrill tension some one wailing nerve means to fetch
 Its response the truest most stringent and smart
 Its pathos the purest from out the wrung heart
 Whose faculties flaccid it may be if less
 Sharply strung sharply smitten had faild to express
 Just the one note the great final harmony needs
 And what best proves theres life in a heartthat it bleeds
 Grant a cause to remove grant an end to attain
 Grant both to be just and what mercy in pain
 Cease the sin with the sorrow See morning begin
 Pain must burn itself out if not fueld by sin
 There is hope in yon hilltops and love in yon light
 Let hate and despondency die with the night

 He was moved by her words As some poor wretch confined
 In cells loud with meaningless laughter whose mind
 Wanders trackless amidst its own ruins may hear
 A voice heard long since silenced many a year
 And now mid mad ravings recaptured again
 Singing through the caged lattice a once wellknown strain
 Which brings back his boyhood upon it until
 The minds ruind crevices graciously fill
 With music and memory and as it were
 The longtroubled spirit grows slowly aware
 Of the mockery round it and shrinks from each thing
 It once soughtthe poor idiot who passd for a king
 Hard by with his squalid straw crown now confessd
 A madman more painfully mad than the rest
 So the sound of her voice as it there wanderd oer
 His echoing heart seemd in part to restore
 The forces of thought he recaptured the whole
 Of his life by the light which in passing her soul
 Reflected on his he appeard to awake
 From a dream and perceived he had dreamd a mistake
 His spirit was softend yet troubled in him
 He felt his lips falter his eyesight grow dim
 But he murmurd
 Lucile not for me that suns light
 Which revealsnot restoresthe wild havoc of night
 There are some creatures born for the night not the day
 Brokenhearted the nightingale hides in the spray
 And the owls moody mind in his own hollow tower
 Dwells muffled Be darkness henceforward my dower
 Light be sure in that darkness there dwells by which eyes
 Grown familiar with ruins may yet recognize
 Enough desolation


 IX


 The pride that claims here
 On earth to itself howsoever severe
 To itself it may be Gods dread office and right
 Of punishing sin is a sin in heavens sight
 And against heavens service
 Eugene de Luvois
 Leave the judgment to Him who alone knows the law
 Surely no man can be his own judge least of all
 His own doomsman
 Her words seemd to fall
 With a weight of tears in them
 He lookd up and saw
 That sad serene countenance mournful as law
 And tender as pity bowd oer him and heard
 In some thicket the matinal chirp of a bird


 X


 Vulgar natures alone suffer vainly
 Eugene
 She continued in life we have met once again
 And once more life parts us Yon dayspring for me
 Lifts the veil of a future in which it may be
 We shall meet nevermore Grant oh grant to me yet
 The belief that it is not in vain we have met
 I plead for the future A new horoscope
 I would cast will you read it I plead for a hope
 I plead for a memory yours yours alone
 To restore or to spare Let the hope be your own
 Be the memory mine
 Once of yore when for man
 Faith yet lived ere this age of the sluggard began
 Men aroused to the knowledge of evil fled far
 From the fading rosegardens of sense to the war
 With the Pagan the cave in the desert and sought
 Not repose but employment in action or thought
 Lifes strong earnest in all things oh think not of me
 But yourself for I plead for your own destiny
 I plead for your life with its duties undone
 With its claims unappeased and its trophies unwon
 And in pleading for lifes fair fulfilment I plead
 For all that you miss and for all that you need


 XI


 Through the calm crystal air faint and far as she spoke
 A clear chilly chime from a churchturret broke
 And the sound of her voice with the sound of the bell
 On his ear where he kneeld softly soothingly fell
 All within him was wild and confused as within
 A chamber deserted in some roadside inn
 Where passing wild travellers paused overnight
 To quaff and carouse in each socket each light
 Is extinct crashd the glasses and scrawld is the wall
 With wild ribald ballads serenely oer all
 For the first time perceived where the dawnlight creeps faint
 Through the wrecks of that orgy the face of a saint
 Seen through some broken frame appears noting meanwhile
 The ruin all round with a sorrowful smile
 And he gazed round The curtains of Darkness half drawn
 Oped behind her and pure as the pure light of dawn
 She stood bathed in morning and seemd to his eyes
 From their sight to be melting away in the skies
 That expanded around her


 XII


 There passd through his head
 A fancya vision That woman was dead
 He had loved long agoloved and lost dead to him
 Dead to all the life left him but there in the dim
 Dewy light of the dawn stood a spirit twas hers
 And he said to the soul of Lucile de Nevers
 O soul to its sources departing away
 Pray for mine if one soul for another may pray
 I to ask have no right thou to give hast no power
 One hope to my heart But in this parting hour
 I name not my heart and I speak not to thine
 Answer soul of Lucile to this dark soul of mine
 Does not soul owe to soul what to heart heart denies
 Hope when hope is salvation Behold in yon skies
 This wild night is passing away while I speak
 Lo above us the dayspring beginning to break
 Something wakens within me and warms to the beam
 Is it hope that awakens or do I but dream
 I know not It may be perchance the first spark
 Of a new light within me to solace the dark
 Unto which I return or perchance it may be
 The last spark of fires half extinguishd in me
 I know not Thou goest thy way I my own
 For good or for evil I know not Alone
 This I know we are parting I wishd to say more
 But no matter twill pass All between us is oer
 Forget the wild words of tonight Twas the pain
 For long years hoarded up that rushd from me again
 I was unjust forgive me Spare now to reprove
 Other words other deeds It was madness not love
 That you thwarted this night What is done is now done
 Death remains to avenge it or life to atone
 I was maddend delirious I saw you return
 To himnot to me and I felt my heart burn
 With a fierce thirst for vengeanceand thus let it pass
 Long thoughts these and so brief the moments alas
 Thou goest thy way and I mine I suppose
 Tis to meet nevermore Is it not so Who knows
 Or who heeds where the exile from Paradise flies
 Or what altars of his in the desert may rise
 Is it not so Lucile Well well Thus then we part
 Once again soul from soul as before heart from heart


 XIII


 And again clearer far than the chime of a bell
 That voice on his sense softly soothingly fell
 Our two paths must part us Eugene for my own
 Seems no more through that world in which henceforth alone
 You must work out as now I believe that you will
 The hope which you speak of That work I shall still
 If I live watch and welcome and bless far away
 Doubt not this But mistake not the thought if I say
 That the great moral combat between human life
 And each human soul must be single The strife
 None can share though by all its results may be known
 When the soul arms for battle she goes forth alone
 I say not indeed we shall meet nevermore
 For I know not But meet as we have met of yore
 I know that we cannot Perchance we may meet
 By the deathbed the tomb in the crowd in the street
 Or in solitude even but never again
 Shall we meet from henceforth as we have met Eugene
 For we know not the way we are going nor yet
 Where our two ways may meet or may cross Life hath set
 No landmarks before us But this this alone
 I will promise whatever your path or my own
 If for once in the conflict before you it chance
 That the Dragon prevail and with cleft shield and lance
 Lost or shatterd borne down by the stress of the war
 You falter and hesitate if from afar
 I still watching unknown to yourself it may be
 Oer the conflict to which I conjure you should see
 That my presence could rescue support you or guide
 In the hour of that need I shall be at your side
 To warn if you will or incite or control
 And again once again we shall meet soul to soul


 XIV


 The voice ceased
 He uplifted his eyes
 All alone
 He stood on the bare edge of dawn She was gone
 Like a star when up bay after bay of the night
 Ripples in wave on wave the broad ocean of light
 And at once in her place was the Sunrise It rose
 In its sumptuous splendor and solemn repose
 The supreme revelation of light Domes of gold
 Realms of rose in the Orient and breathless and bold
 While the great gates of heaven rolld back one by one
 The bright herald angel stood stern in the sun
 Thrice holy Eospheros Lights reign began
 In the heaven on the earth in the heart of the man
 The dawn on the mountains the dawn everywhere
 Light silence the fresh innovations of air
 O earth and O ether A butterfly breeze
 Floated up flutterd down and poised blithe on the trees
 Through the revelling woods oer the sharprippled stream
 Up the vale slow uncoiling itself out of dream
 Around the brown meadows adown the hillslope
 The spirits of morning were whispering HOPE


 XV


 He uplifted his eyes In the place where she stood
 But a moment before and where now rolld the flood
 Of the sunrise all golden he seemd to behold
 In the young light of sunrise an image unfold
 Of his own youthits ardorsits promise of fame
 Its ancestral ambition and France by the name
 Of his sires seemd to call him There hoverd in light
 That image aloft oer the shapeless and bright
 And Aurorean clouds which themselves seemd to be
 Brilliant fragments of that golden world wherein he
 Had once dwelt a native
 There rooted and bound
 To the earth stood the man gazing at it Around
 The rims of the sunrise it hoverd and shone
 Transcendent that type of a youth that was gone
 And heas the body may yearn for the soul
 So he yearnd to embody that image His whole
 Heart arose to regain it
 And is it too late
 No for Time is a fiction and limits not fate
 Thought alone is eternal Time thralls it in vain
 For the thought that springs upward and yearns to regain
 The true source of spirit there IS no TOO LATE
 As the stream to its first mountain levels elate
 In the fountain arises the spirit in him
 Arose to that image The image waned dim
 Into heaven and heavenward with it to melt
 As it melted in days broad expansion he felt
 With a thrill sweet and strange and intenseawed amazed
 Something soar and ascend in his soul as he gazed




CANTO VI


 I


 Man is born on a battlefield Round him to rend
 Or resist the dread Powers he displaces attend
 By the cradle which Nature amidst the stern shocks
 That have shatterd creation and shapen it rocks
 He leaps with a wail into being and lo
 His own mother fierce Nature herself is his foe
 Her whirlwinds are roused into wrath oer his head
 Neath his feet roll her earthquakes her solitudes spread
 To daunt him her forces dispute his command
 Her snows fall to freeze him her suns burn to brand
 Her seas yawn to engulf him her rocks rise to crush
 And the lion and leopard allied lurk to rush
 On their startled invader
 In lone Malabar
 Where the infinite forest spreads breathless and far
 Mid the cruel of eye and the stealthy of claw
 Striped and spotted destroyers he sees pale with awe
 On the menacing edge of a fiery sky
 Grim Doorga bluelimbd and redhanded go by
 And the first thing he worships is Terror
 Anon
 Still impelld by necessity hungrily on
 He conquers the realms of his own selfreliance
 And the last cry of fear wakes the first of defiance
 From the serpent he crushes its poisonous soul
 Smitten down in his path see the dead lion roll
 On toward Heaven the son of Alcmena strides high on
 The heads of the Hydra the spoils of the lion
 And man conquering terror is worshippd by man

 A camp has the world been since first it began
 From his tents sweeps the roving Arabian at peace
 A mere wandering shepherd that follows the fleece
 But warring his way through a worlds destinies
 Lo from Delhi from Bagdadt from Cordova rise
 Domes of empiry dowerd with science and art
 Schools libraries forums the palace the mart

 New realms to mans soul have been conquerd But those
 Forthwith they are peopled for man by new foes
 The stars keep their secrets the earth hides her own
 And bold must the man be that braves the Unknown
 Not a truth has to art or to science been given
 But brows have ached for it and souls toild and striven
 And many have striven and many have faild
 And many died slain by the truth they assaild
 But when Man hath tamed Nature asserted his place
 And dominion behold he is brought face to face
 With a new foehimself
 Nor may man on his shield
 Ever rest for his foe is ever afield
 Danger ever at hand till the armed Archangel
 Sound oer him the trump of earths final evangel


 II


 Silence straightway stern Muse the soft cymbals of pleasure
 Be all bronzen these numbers and martial the measure
 Breathe sonorously breathe oer the spirit in me
 One strain sad and stern of that deep Epopee
 Which thou from the fashionless cloud of far time
 Chantest lonely when Victory pale and sublime
 In the light of the aureole over her head
 Hears and heeds not the wound in her heart fresh and red
 Blown wide by the blare of the clarion unfold
 The shrill clanging curtains of war
 And behold
 A vision
 The antique Heraclean seats
 And the long Black Sea billow that once bore those fleets
 Which said to the winds Be ye too Genoese
 And the red angry sands of the chafed Cheronese
 And the two foes of man War and Winter allied
 Round the Armies of England and France side by side
 Enduring and dying Gaul and Briton abreast
 Where the towers of the North fret the skies of the East


 III


 Since that sunrise which rose through the calm linden stems
 Oer Lucile and Eugene in the garden of Ems
 Through twentyfive seasons encircling the sun
 This planet of ours on its pathway hath gone
 And the fates that I sing of have flowed with the fates
 Of a world in the red wake of war round the gates
 Of that doomd and heroical city in which
 Fire crowning the rampart blood bathing the ditch
 At bay fights the Russian as some hunted bear
 Whom the huntsmen have hemmd round at last in his lair


 IV


 A fangd arid plain sappd with underground fire
 Soakd with snow torn with shot mashd to one gory mire
 There Fates iron scale hangs in horrid suspense
 While those two famished ogresthe Siege the Defence
 Face to face through a vapor frore dismal and dun
 Glare scenting the breath of each other
 The one
 Doublebodied twoheadedby separate ways
 Winding serpentwise nearer the other each days
 Sullen toil adding size toconcentrated solid
 Indefatigablethe brassfronted embodied
 And audible Greek text omitted gone sombrely forth
 To the world from that Autocrat Will of the north


 V


 In the dawn of a moody October a pale
 Ghostly motionless vapor began to prevail
 Over city and camp like the garment of death
 Which is formed by the face it conceals
 Twas the breath
 War yet drowsily yawning began to suspire
 Wherethrough here and there flashd an eye of red fire
 And closed from some rampart beginning to bellow
 Hoarse challenge replied to anon through the yellow
 And sulphurous twilight till day reeld and rockd
 And roard into dark Then the midnight was mockd
 With fierce apparitions Ringd round by a rain
 Of red fire and of iron the murtherous plain
 Flared with fitful combustion where fitfully fell
 Afar off the fatal disgorged scharpenelle
 And fired the horizon and singed the coild gloom
 With wings of swift flame round that City of Doom


 VI


 So the dayso the night So by night so by day
 With stern patient pathos while time wears away
 In the trench flooded through in the wind where it wails
 In the snow where it falls in the fire where it hails
 Shot and shelllink by link out of hardship and pain
 Toil sickness endurance is forged the bronze chain
 Of those terrible siegelines
 No change to that toil
 Save the mines sudden leap from the treacherous soil
 Save the midnight attack save the groans of the maimd
 And Deaths daily obolus due whether claimd
 By man or by nature


 VII


 Time passes The dumb
 Bitter snowbound and sullen November is come
 And its snows have been bathed in the blood of the brave
 And many a young heart has glutted the grave
 And on Inkerman yet the wild bramble is gory
 And those bleak heights henceforth shall be famous in story


 VIII


 The moon swathed in storm has long set through the camp
 No sound save the sentinels slow sullen tramp
 The distant explosion the wild sleety wind
 That seems searching for something it never can find
 The midnight is turning the lamp is nigh spent
 And wounded and lone in a desolate tent
 Lies a young British soldier whose sword
 In this place
 However my Muse is compelld to retrace
 Her precipitous steps and revert to the past
 The shock which had suddenly shatterd at last
 Alfred Vargraves fantastical holiday nature
 Had sharply drawn forth to his full size and stature
 The real man conceald till that moment beneath
 All he yet had appeard From the gay broiderd sheath
 Which a man in his wrath flings aside even so
 Leaps the keen trenchant steel summond forth by a blow
 And thus loss of fortune gave value to life
 The wife gaind a husband the husband a wife
 In that home which though humbled and narrowd by fate
 Was enlarged and ennobled by love Low their state
 But large their possessions
 Sir Ridley forgiven
 By those he unwittingly brought nearer heaven
 By one fraudulent act than through all his sleek speech
 The hypocrite brought his own soul safe from reach
 Of the law died abroad
 Cousin John heart and hand
 Purse and person henceforth honest man took his stand
 By Matilda and Alfred guest guardian and friend
 Of the home he both shared and assured to the end
 With his large lively love Alfred Vargrave meanwhile
 Faced the worlds frown consoled by his wifes faithful smile
 Late in life he began life in earnest and still
 With the tranquil exertion of resolute will
 Through long and laborious and difficult days
 Out of manifold failure by wearisome ways
 Workd his way through the world till at last he began
 Reconciled to the work which mankind claims for man
 After years of unwitnessd unwearied endeavor
 Years impassiond yet patient to realize ever
 More clear on the broad stream of current opinion
 The reflex of powers in himselfthat dominion
 Which the life of one man if his life be a truth
 May assert oer the life of mankind Thus his youth
 In his manhood renewd fame and fortune he won
 Working only for home love and duty
 One son
 Matilda had borne him but scarce had the boy
 With all Eton yet fresh in his full hearts frank joy
 The darling of young soldier comrades just glanced
 Down the glad dawn of manhood at life when it chanced
 That a blight sharp and sudden was breathd oer the bloom
 Of his joyous and generous years and the gloom
 Of a grief premature on their fair promise fell
 No light cloud like those which for June to dispel
 Captious April engenders but deep as his own
 Deep nature Meanwhile ere I fully make known
 The cause of this sorrow I track the event
 When first a wild warnote through England was sent
 He transferring without either token or word
 To friend parent or comrade a yet virgin sword
 From a holiday troop to one bound for the war
 Had marchd forth with eyes that saw death in the star
 Whence others sought glory Thus fighting he fell
 On the red field of Inkerman found who can tell
 By what miracle breathing though shatterd and borne
 To the rear by his comrades pierced bleeding and torn
 Where for long days and nights with the wound in his side
 He lay dark


 IX


 But a wound deeper far undescried
 The young heart was rankling for there of a truth
 In the first earnest faith of a pure pensive youth
 A love large as life deep and changeless as death
 Lay ensheathd and that love ever fretting its sheath
 The frail scabbard of life pierced and wore through and through
 There are loves in mans life for which time can renew
 All that time may destroy Lives there are though in love
 Which cling to one faith and die with it nor move
 Though earthquakes may shatter the shrine
 Whence or how
 Love laid claim to this young life it matters not now


 X


 Oh is it a phantom a dream of the night
 A vision which fever hath fashiond to sight
 The wind wailing ever with motion uncertain
 Sways sighingly there the drenchd tents tattered curtain
 To and fro up and down
 But it is not the wind
 That is lifting it now and it is not the mind
 That hath moulded that vision
 A pale woman enters
 As wan as the lamps waning light which concenters
 Its dull glare upon her With eyes dim and dimmer
 There all in a slumberous and shadowy glimmer
 The sufferer sees that still form floating on
 And feels faintly aware that he is not alone
 She is flitting before him She pauses She stands
 By his bedside all silent She lays her white hands
 On the brow of the boy A light finger is pressing
 Softly softly the sore wounds the hot bloodstaind dressing
 Slips from them A comforting quietude steals
 Through the rackd weary frame and throughout it he feels
 The slow sense of a merciful mild neighborhood
 Something smooths the tossd pillow Beneath a gray hood
 Of rough serge two intense tender eyes are bent oer him
 And thrill through and through him The sweet form before him
 It is surely Deaths angel Lifes last vigil keeping
 A soft voice says Sleep
 And he sleeps he is sleeping


 XI


 He waked before dawn Still the vision is there
 Still that pale woman moves not A ministring care
 Meanwhile has been silently changing and cheering
 The aspect of all things around him
 Revering
 Some power unknown and benignant he blessd
 In silence the sense of salvation And rest
 Having loosend the minds tangled meshes he faintly
 Sighd Say what thou art blessed dream of a saintly
 And ministring spirit
 A whisper serene
 Slid softer than silence The Soeur Seraphine
 A poor Sister of Charity Shun to inquire
 Aught further young soldier The son of thy sire
 For the sake of that sire I reclaim from the grave
 Thou didst not shun death shun not life Tis more brave
 To live than to die Sleep
 He sleeps he is sleeping


 XII


 He wakend again when the dawn was just steeping
 The skies with chill splendor And there never flitting
 Never flitting that vision of mercy was sitting
 As the dawn to the darkness so life seemed returning
 Slowly feebly within him The nightlamp yet burning
 Made ghastly the glimmering daybreak
 He said
 If thou be of the living and not of the dead
 Sweet minister pour out yet further the healing
 Of that balmy voice if it may be revealing
 Thy mission of mercy whence art thou
 O son
 Of Matilda and Alfred it matters not One
 Who is not of the living nor yet of the dead
 To thee and to others alive yet she said
 So long as there liveth the poor gift in me
 Of this ministration to them and to thee
 Dead in all things beside A French Nun whose vocation
 Is now by this bedside A nun hath no nation
 Wherever man suffers or woman may soothe
 There her land there her kindred
 She bent down to smooth
 The hot pillow and added Yet more than another
 Is thy life dear to me For thy father thy mother
 I know themI know them
 Oh can it be you
 My dearest dear father my mother you knew
 You know them
 She bowed half averting her head
 In silence
 He brokenly timidly said
 Do they know I am thus
 Hush she smiled as she drew
 From her bosom two letters andcan it be true
 That beloved and familiar writing
 He burst
 Into tears My poor mothermy father the worst
 Will have reachd them
 No no she exclaimed with a smile
 They know you are living they know that meanwhile
 I am watching beside you Young soldier weep not
 But still on the nuns nursing bosom the hot
 Feverd brow of the boy weeping wildly is pressd
 There at last the young heart sobs itself into rest
 And he hears as it were between smiling and weeping
 The calm voice say Sleep
 And he sleeps he is sleeping


 XIII


 And day followd day And as wave followd wave
 With the tide day by day life reissuing drave
 Through that young hardy frame novel currents of health
 Yet some strange obstruction which lifes health by stealth
 Seemed to cherish impeded lifes progress And still
 A feebleness less of the frame than the will
 Clung about the sick manhid and harbord within
 The sad hollow eyes pinchd the cheek pale and thin
 And clothed the wan fingers with languor
 And there
 Day by day night by night unremitting in care
 Unwearied in watching so cheerful of mien
 And so gentle of hand sat the Soeur Seraphine


 XIV


 A strange woman truly not young yet her face
 Wan and worn as it was bore about it the trace
 Of a beauty which time could not ruin For the whole
 Quiet cheek youths lost bloom left transparent the soul
 Seemed to fill with its own light like some sunny fountain
 Everlastingly fed from far off in the mountain
 That pours in a garden deserted its streams
 And all the more lovely for loneliness seems
 So that watching that face you could scarce pause to guess
 The years which its calm careworn lines might express
 Feeling only what suffering with these must have past
 To have perfected there so much sweetness at last


 XV


 Thus one bronzen evening when day had put out
 His brief thrifty fires and the wind was about
 The nun watchful still by the boy on his own
 Laid a firm quiet hand and the deep tender tone
 Of her voice moved the silence
 She said I have heald
 These wounds of the body Why hast thou conceald
 Young soldier that yet open wound in the heart
 Wilt thou trust NO hand near it
 He winced with a start
 As of one that is suddenly touched on the spot
 From which every nerve derives suffering
 What
 Lies my heart then so bare he moaned bitterly
 Nay
 With compassionate accents she hastened to say
 Do you think that these eyes are with sorrow young man
 So all unfamiliar indeed as to scan
 Her features yet know them not
 Oh was it spoken
 Go ye forth heal the sick lift the low bind the broken
 Of the body alone Is our mission then done
 When we leave the bruised hearts if we bind the bruised bone
 Nay is not the mission of mercy twofold
 Whence twofold perchance are the powers that we hold
 To fulfil it of Heaven For Heaven doth still
 To us Sisters it may be who seek it send skill
 Won from long intercourse with affliction and art
 Helpd of Heaven to bind up the broken of heart
 Trust to me His two feeble hands in her own
 She drew gently Trust to me she said with soft tone
 I am not so dead in remembrance to all
 I have died to in this world but what I recall
 Enough of its sorrow enough of its trial
 To grieve for bothsave from both haply The dial
 Receives many shades and each points to the sun
 The shadows are many the sunlight is one
 Lifes sorrows still fluctuate Gods love does not
 And His love is unchanged when it changes our lot
 Looking up to this light which is common to all
 And down to these shadows on each side that fall
 In times silent circle so various for each
 Is it nothing to know that they never can reach
 So far but what light lies beyond them forever
 Trust to me Oh if in this hour I endeavor
 To trace the shade creeping across the young life
 Which in prayer till this hour I have watchd through its strife
 With the shadow of death tis with this faith alone
 That in tracing the shade I shall find out the sun
 Trust to me
 She paused he was weeping Small need
 Of added appeal or entreaty indeed
 Had those gentle accents to win from his pale
 And parchd trembling lips as it rose the brief tale
 Of a lifes early sorrow The story is old
 And in words few as may be shall straightway be told


 XVI


 A few years ago ere the fair form of Peace
 Was driven from Europe a young girlthe niece
 Of a French noble leaving an old Norman pile
 By the wild northern seas came to dwell for a while
 With a lady allied to her racean old dame
 Of a threefold legitimate virtue and name
 In the Faubourg Saint Germain
 Upon that fair child
 From childhood nor father nor mother had smiled
 One uncle their place in her life had supplied
 And their place in her heart she had grown at his side
 And under his rooftree and in his regard
 From childhood to girlhood
 This fair orphan ward
 Seemd the sole human creature that lived in the heart
 Of that stern rigid man or whose smile could impart
 One ray of response to the eyes which above
 Her fair infant forehead lookd down with a love
 That seemd almost stern so intense was its chill
 Lofty stillness like sunlight on some lonely hill
 Which is colder and stiller than sunlight elsewhere

 Grass grew in the courtyard the chambers were bare
 In that ancient mansion when first the stern tread
 Of its owner awakend their echoes long dead
 Bringing with him this infant the child of a brother
 Whom dying the hands of a desolate mother
 Had placed on his bosom Twas saidright or wrong
 That in the lone mansion left tenantless long
 To which as a stranger its lord now returnd
 In years yet recalld through loud midnights had burnd
 The light of wild orgies Be that false or true
 Slow and sad was the footstep which now wanderd through
 Those desolate chambers and calm and severe
 Was the life of their inmate
 Men now saw appear
 Every morn at the mass that firm sorrowful face
 Which seemd to lock up in a cold iron case
 Tears hardend to crystal Yet harsh if he were
 His severity seemd to be trebly severe
 In the rule of his own rigid life which at least
 Was benignant to others The poor parish priest
 Who lived on his largess his piety praised
 The peasant was fed and the chapel was raised
 And the cottage was built by his liberal hand
 Yet he seemd in the midst of his good deeds to stand
 A lone and unloved and unlovable man
 There appeard some inscrutable flaw in the plan
 Of his life that love faild to pass over
 That child
 Alone did not fear him nor shrink from him smiled
 To his frown and dispelld it
 The sweet sportive elf
 Seemd the type of some joy lost and missd in himself
 Ever welcome he sufferd her glad face to glide
 In on hours when to others his door was denied
 And many a time with a mute moody look
 He would watch her at prattle and play like a brook
 Whose babble disturbs not the quietest spot
 But soothes us because we need answer it not

 But few years had passd oer that childhood before
 A change came among them A letter which bore
 Sudden consequence with it one morning was placed
 In the hands of the lord of the chateau He paced
 To and fro in his chamber a whole night alone
 After reading that letter At dawn he was gone
 Weeks passd When he came back again he returnd
 With a tall ancient dame from whose lips the child learnd
 That they were of the same race and name With a face
 Sad and anxious to this witherd stock of the race
 He confided the orphan and left them alone
 In the old lonely house
 In a few days twas known
 To the angry surprise of half Paris that one
 Of the chiefs of that party which still clinging on
 To the banner that bears the white lilies of France
 Will fight neath no other nor yet for the chance
 Of restoring their own had renounced the watchword
 And the creed of his youth in unsheathing his sword
 For a Fatherland fatherd no more such is fate
 By legitimate parents
 And meanwhile elate
 And in no wise disturbed by what Paris might say
 The new soldier thus wrote to a friend far away
 To the life of inaction farewell After all
 Creeds the oldest may crumble and dynasties fall
 But the sole grand Legitimacy will endure
 In whatever makes death noble life strong and pure
 Freedom action the desert to breathe inthe lance
 Of the Arab to follow I go vive la France

 Few and rare were the meetings henceforth as years fled
 Twixt the child and the soldier The two women led
 Lone lives in the lone house Meanwhile the child grew
 Into girlhood and like a sunbeam sliding through
 Her green quiet years changed by gentle degrees
 To the loveliest vision of youth a youth sees
 In his loveliest fancies as pure as a pearl
 And as perfect a noble and innocent girl
 With eighteen sweet summers dissolved in the light
 Of her lovely and lovable eyes soft and bright
 Then her guardian wrote to the dame Let Constance
 Go with you to Paris I trust that in France
 I may be ere the close of the year I confide
 My lifes treasure to you Let her see at your side
 The world which we live in
 To Paris then came
 Constance to abide with that old stately dame
 In that old stately Faubourg
 The young Englishman
 Thus met her Twas there their acquaintance began
 There it closed That old miracle Loveatfirstsight
 Needs no explanations The heart reads aright
 Its destiny sometimes His love neither chidden
 Nor checkd the young soldier was graciously bidden
 An habitual guest to that house by the dame
 His own candid graces the worldhonord name
 Of his father in him not dishonord were both
 Fair titles to favor His love nothing loath
 The old lady observed was returnd by Constance
 And as the childs uncle his absence from France
 Yet prolongd she thus easing long selfgratulation
 Wrote to him a lengthend and moving narration
 Of the graces and gifts of the young English wooer
 His fathers fair fame the boys deference to her
 His love for Constanceunaffected sincere
 And the girls love for him read by her in those clear
 Limpid eyes then the pleasure with which she awaited
 Her cousins approval of all she had stated

 At length from that cousin an answer there came
 Brief stern such as stunnd and astonishd the dame

 Let Constance leave Paris with you on the day
 You receive this Until my return she may stay
 At her convent awhile If my niece wishes ever
 To behold me again understand she will never
 Wed that man
 You have broken faith with me Farewell
 No appeal from that sentence
 It needs not to tell
 The tears of Constance nor the grief of her lover
 The dream they had laid out their lives in was over
 Bravely strove the young soldier to look in the face
 Of a life where invisible hands seemed to trace
 Oer the threshold these words Hope no more

 Unreturnd
 Had his love been the strong manful heart would have spurnd
 That weakness which suffers a woman to lie
 At the roots of mans life like a canker and dry
 And wither the sap of lifes purpose But there
 Lay the bitterer part of the pain Could he dare
 To forget he was loved that he grieved not alone
 Recording a love that drew sorrow upon
 The woman he loved for himself dare he seek
 Surcease to that sorrow which thus held him weak
 Beat him down and destroyd him
 News reachd him indeed
 Through a comrade who brought him a letter to read
 From the dame who had care of Constance it was one
 To whom when at Paris the boy had been known
 A Frenchman and friend of the Faubourg which said
 That Constance although never a murmur betrayd
 What she sufferd in silence grew paler each day
 And seemd visibly drooping and dying away
 It was then he sought death


 XVII


 Thus the tale ends Twas told
 With such broken passionate words as unfold
 In glimpses alone a coild grief Through each pause
 Of its fitful recital in raw gusty flaws
 The rain shook the canvas unheeded aloof
 And unheeded the nightwind around the tentroof
 At intervals wirbled And when all was said
 The sick man exhausted droopd backward his head
 And fell into a feverish slumber
 Long while
 Sat the Soeur Seraphine in deep thought The still smile
 That was wont angelwise to inhabit her face
 And made it like heaven was fled from its place
 In her eyes on her lips and a deep sadness there
 Seemd to darken the lines of long sorrow and care
 As low to herself she sighd
 Hath it Eugene
 Been so long then the struggle and yet all in vain
 Nay not all in vain shall the world gain a man
 And yet Heaven lose a soul Have I done all I can
 Soul to soul did he say Soul to soul be it so
 And thensoul of mine whither whither


 XVIII


 Large slow
 Silent tears in those deep eyes ascended and fell
 HERE at least I have faild not she mused this is well
 She drew from her bosom two letters
 In one
 A mothers heart wild with alarm for her son
 Breathed bitterly forth its despairing appeal
 The pledge of a love owed to thee O Lucile
 The hope of a home saved by theeof a heart
 Which hath never since then thrice endeard as thou art
 Ceased to bless thee to pray for thee save save my son
 And if not the letter went brokenly on
 Heaven help us
 Then followd from Alfred a few
 Blotted heartbroken pages He mournfully drew
 With pathos the picture of that earnest youth
 So unlike his own how in beauty and truth
 He had nurtured that nature so simple and brave
 And how he had striven his sons youth to save
 From the errors so sadly redeemd in his own
 And so deeply repented how thus in that son
 In whose youth he had garnerd his age he had seemd
 To be blessd by a pledge that the past was redeemd
 And forgiven He bitterly went on to speak
 Of the boys baffled love in which fate seemd to break
 Unawares on his dreams with retributive pain
 And the ghosts of the past rose to scourge back again
 The hopes of the future To sue for consent
 Pride forbade and the hope his old foe might relent
 Experience rejected My life for the boys
 He exclaimd for I die with my son if he dies
 Lucile Heaven bless you for all you have done
 Save him save him Lucile save my son save my son


 XIX


 Ay murmurd the Soeur Seraphine heart to heart
 THERE at least I have faild not Fulfilld is my part
 Accomplishd my mission One act crowns the whole
 Do I linger Nay be it so then Soul to soul
 She knelt down and prayd Still the boy slumberd on
 Dawn broke The pale nun from the bedside was gone

 Meanwhile mid his aidesdecamp busily bent
 Oer the daily reports in his wellorderd tent
 There sits a French Generalbronzed by the sun
 And seard by the sands of Algeria One
 Who forth from the wars of the wild Kabylee
 Had strangely and rapidly risen to be
 The idol the darling the dream and the star
 Of the younger French chivalry daring in war
 And wary in council He enterd indeed
 Late in life and discarding his Bourbonite creed
 The Army of France and had risen in part
 From a singular aptitude proved for the art
 Of that wild desert warfare of ambush surprise
 And stratagem which to the French camp supplies
 Its subtlest intelligence partly from chance
 Partly too from a name and position which France
 Was proud to put forward but mainly in fact
 From the prudence to plan and the daring to act
 In frequent emergencies startlingly shown
 To the rank which he now heldintrepidly won
 With many a wound trenchd in many a scar
 From fierce Milianah and SidiSakhdar


 XXI


 All within and without that warm tent seems to bear
 Smiling token of provident order and care
 All about a wellfed wellclad soldiery stands
 In groups round the music of mirthbreathing bands
 In and out of the tent all day long to and fro
 The messengers come and the messengers go
 Upon missions of mercy or errands of toil
 To report how the sapper contends with the soil
 In the terrible trench how the sick man is faring
 In the hospital tent and combining comparing
 Constructing within moves the brain of one man
 Moving all
 He is bending his brow oer some plan
 For the hospital service wise skilful humane
 The officer standing behind him is fain
 To refer to the angel solicitous cares
 Of the Sisters of Charity one he declares
 To be known through the camp as a seraph of grace
 He has seen all have seen her indeed in each place
 Where suffering is seen silent activethe Soeur
 Soeur how do they call her
 Ay truly of her
 I have heard much the General musing replies
 And we owe her already unless rumor lies
 The lives of not few of our bravest You mean
 Ah how do they call her the SoeurSeraphine
 Is it not so I rarely forget names once heard

 Yes the Soeur Seraphine Her I meant
 On my word
 I have much wishd to see her I fancy I trace
 In some facts traced to her something more than the grace
 Of an angel I mean an acute human mind
 Ingenious constructive intelligent Find
 And if possible let her come to me We shall
 I think aid each other
 Oui mon General
 I believe she has lately obtained the permission
 To tend some sick man in the Second Division
 Of our Ally they say a relation
 Ay so
 A relation
 Tis said so
 The name do you know
 Non mon General
 While they spoke yet there went
 A murmur and stir round the door of the tent
 A Sister of Charity craves in a case
 Of urgent and serious importance the grace
 Of brief private speech with the General there
 Will the General speak with her
 Bid her declare
 Her mission
 She will not She craves to be seen
 And be heard
 Well her name then
 The Soeur Seraphine
 Clear the tent She may enter


 XXII


 The tent has been cleard
 The chieftain stroked moodily somewhat his beard
 A sable long silverd and pressd down his brow
 On his hand heavy veind All his countenance now
 Unwitnessd at once fell dejected and dreary
 As a curtain let fall by a hand thats grown weary
 Into puckers and folds From his lips unrepressd
 Steals th impatient sigh which reveals in mans breast
 A conflict conceald and experience at strife
 With itselfthe vexd hearts passing protest on life
 He turnd to his papers He heard the light tread
 Of a faint foot behind him and lifting his head
 Said Sit Holy Sister your worth is well known
 To the hearts of our soldiers nor less to my own
 I have much wishd to see you I owe you some thanks
 In the name of all those you have saved to our ranks
 I record them Sit Now then your mission
 The nun
 Paused silent The General eyed her anon
 More keenly His aspect grew troubled A change
 Darkend over his features He mutterd Strange strange
 Any face should so strongly remind me of HER
 Fool again the delirium the dream does it stir
 Does it move as of old Psha
 Sit Sister I wait
 Your answer my time halts but hurriedly State
 The cause why you seek me
 The cause ay the cause
 She vaguely repeated Then after a pause
 As one who awaked unawares would put back
 The sleep that forever returns in the track
 Of dreams which though scared and dispersed not the less
 Settle back to faint eyelids that yield neath their stress
 Like doves to a penthousea movement she made
 Less toward him than away from herself droopd her head
 And folded her hands on her bosom long spare
 Fatigued mournful hands Not a stream of stray hair
 Escaped the pale bands scarce more pale than the face
 Which they bound and lockd up in a rigid white case
 She fixd her eyes on him There crept a vague awe
 Oer his sense such as ghosts cast
 Eugene de Luvois
 The cause which recalls me again to your side
 Is a promise that rests unfulfilld she replied
 I come to fulfil it
 He sprang from the place
 Where he sat pressd his hand as in doubt oer his face
 And cautiously feeling each step oer the ground
 That he trod on as one who walks fearing the sound
 Of his footstep may startle and scare out of sight
 Some strange sleeping creature on which he would light
 Unawares crept towards her one heavy hand laid
 On her shoulder in silence bent oer her his head
 Searchd her face with a long look of troubled appeal
 Against doubt staggerd backward and murmurd Lucile
 Thus we meet then here thus
 Soul to soul ay
 Eugene
 As I pledged you my word that we should meet again
 Dead she murmurd long dead all that lived in our lives
 Thine and minesaving that which evn lifes self survives
 The soul Tis my soul seeks thine own What may reach
 From my life to thy life so wide each from each
 Save the soul to the soul To thy soul I would speak
 May I do so
 He said workd and white was his cheek
 As he raised it Speak to me
 Deep tender serene
 And sad was the gaze which the Soeur Seraphine
 Held on him She spoke


 XXIII


 As some minstrel may fling
 Preluding the music yet mute in each string
 A swift hand athwart the hushd heart of the whole
 Seeking which note most fitly must first move the soul
 And leaving untroubled the deep chords below
 Move pathetic in numbers remoteeven so
 The voice which was moving the heart of that man
 Far away from its yet voiceless purpose began
 Far away in the pathos remote of the past
 Until through her words rose before him at last
 Bright and dark in their beauty the hopes that were gone
 Unaccomplishd from life
 He was mute


 XXIV


 She went on
 And still further down the dim past did she lead
 Each yielding remembrance far far off to feed
 Mid the pastures of youth in the twilight of hope
 And the valleys of boyhood the freshflowerd slope
 Of lifes dawning land
 Tis the heart of a boy
 With its indistinct passionate prescience of joy
 The unproved desirethe unaimd aspiration
 The deep conscious life that forestalls consummation
 With ever a flitting delightone arms length
 In advance of the august inward impulse
 The strength
 Of the spirit which troubles the seed in the sand
 With the birth of the palmtree Let ages expand
 The glorious creature The ages lie shut
 Safe see in the seed at times signal to put
 Forth their beauty and power leaf by leaf layer on layer
 Till the palm strikes the sun and stands broad in blue air
 So the palm in the palmseed so slowlyso wrought
 Year by year unperceived hope on hope thought by thought
 Trace the growth of the man from its germ in the boy
 Ah but Nature that nurtures may also destroy
 Charm the wind and the sun lest some chance intervene
 While the leafs in the bud while the stems in the green
 A light bird bends the branch a light breeze breaks the bough
 Which if spared by the light breeze the light bird may grow
 To baffle the tempest and rock the high nest
 And take both the bird and the breeze to its breast
 Shall we save a whole forest in sparing one seed
 Save the man in the boy in the thought save the deed
 Let the whirlwind uproot the grown tree if it can
 Save the seed from the north wind So let the grown man
 Face our fate Spare the manseed in youth
 He was dumb
 She went one step further


 XXV


 Lo manhood is come
 And love the wild songbird hath flown to the tree
 And the whirlwind comes after Now prove we and see
 What shade from the leaf what support from the branch
 Spreads the leaf broad and fair holds the bough strong and staunch
 There he saw himselfdark as he stood on that night
 The last when they met and they parted a sight
 For heaven to mourn oer for hell to rejoice
 An ineffable tenderness troubled her voice
 It grew weak and a sigh broke it through
 Then he said
 Never looking at her never lifting his head
 As though at his feet there lay visibly hurld
 Those fragments It was not a love twas a world
 Twas a life that lay ruind Lucile


 XXVI


 She went on
 So be it Perish Babel arise Babylon
 From ruins like these rise the fanes that shall last
 And to build up the future heaven shatters the past
 Ay he moodily murmurd and who cares to scan
 The hearts perishd world if the world gains a man
 From the past to the present though late I appeal
 To the nun Seraphine from the woman Lucile


 XXVII


 Lucile the old namethe old self silenced long
 Heard once more felt once more
 As some soul to the throng
 Of invisible spirits admitted baptized
 By death to a new name and naturesurprised
 Mid the songs of the seraphs hears faintly and far
 Some voice from the earth left below a dim star
 Calling to her forlornly and saddning the psalms
 Of the angels and piercing the Paradise palms
 The name borne mid earthly beloveds on earth
 Sighd above some lone grave in the land of her birth
 So that one word Lucile stirrd the Soeur Seraphine
 For a moment Anon she resumed here serene
 And concentrated calm
 Let the Nun then retrace
 The life of the soldier she said with a face
 That glowd gladdening her words
 To the present I come
 Leave the Past
 There her voice rose and seemd as when some
 Pale Priestess proclaims from her temple the praise
 Of her hero whose brows she is crowning with bays
 Step by step did she follow his path from the place
 Where their two paths diverged Year by year did she trace
 Familiar with all his the soldiers existence
 Her words were of trial endurance resistance
 Of the leaguer around this besieged world of ours
 And the same sentinels that ascend the same towers
 And report the same foes the same fears the same strife
 Waged alike to the limits of each human life
 She went on to speak of the lone moody lord
 Shut up in his lone moody halls every word
 Held the weight of a tear she recorded the good
 He had patiently wrought through a whole neighborhood
 And the blessing that lived on the lips of the poor
 By the peasants hearthstone or the cottagers door
 There she paused and her accents seemd dippd in the hue
 Of his own sombre heart as the picture she drew
 Of the poor proud sad spirit rejecting loves wages
 Yet working loves work reading backwards lifes pages
 For penance and stubbornly many a time
 Both missing the moral and marring the rhyme
 Then she spoke of the soldier the mans work and fame
 The pride of a nation a worlds just acclaim
 Lifes inward approval


 XXVIII


 Her voice reachd his heart
 And sank lower She spoke of herself how apart
 And unseenfar awayshe had watchd year by year
 With how many a blessing how many a tear
 And how many a prayer every stage in the strife
 Guessd the thought in the deed traced the love in the life
 Blessd the man in the mans work
 THY work oh not mine
 Thine Lucile he exclaimd all the worth of it thine
 If worth there be in it
 Her answer conveyd
 His reward and her own joy that cannot be said
 Alone by the voice eyesfacespoke silently
 All the woman one grateful emotion
 And she
 A poor Sister of Charity hers a life spent
 In one silent effort for others
 She bent
 Her divine face above him and filld up his heart
 With the look that glowd from it
 Then slow with soft art
 Fixd her aim and moved to it


 XXIX


 He the soldier humane
 He the hero whose heart hid in glory the pain
 Of a youth disappointed whose life had made known
 The value of mans life that youth overthrown
 And retrieved had it left him no pity for youth
 In another his own life of strenuous truth
 Accomplishd in act had it taught him no care
 For the life of another oh no everywhere
 In the camp which she moved through she came face to face
 With some noble token some generous trace
 Of his active humanity
 Well he replied
 If it be so
 I come from the solemn bedside
 Of a man that is dying she said While we speak
 A life is in jeopardy
 Quick then you seek
 Aid or medicine or what
 Tis not needed she said
 Medicine yes for the mind Tis a heart that needs aid
 You Eugene de Luvois you and you only can
 Save the life of this man Will you save it
 What man
 How where can you ask
 She went rapidly on
 To her object in brief vivid words The young son
 Of Matilda and Alfredthe boy lying there
 Half a mile from that tent doorthe fathers despair
 The mothers deep anguishthe pride of the boy
 In the fatherthe fathers one hope and one joy
 In the sonthe son nowwounded dying She told
 Of the fathers stern struggle with life the boys bold
 Pure and beautiful nature the fair life before him
 If that life were but spared yet a word might restore him
 The boys broken love for the niece of Eugene
 Its pathos the girls love for him how half slain
 In his tent she had found him won from him the tale
 Sought to nurse back his life found her efforts still fail
 Beaten back by a love that was stronger than life
 Of how bravely till then he had stood in that strife
 Wherein England and France in their best blood at last
 Had bathed from remembrance the wounds of the past
 And shall nations be nobler than men Are not great
 Men the models of nations For what is a state
 But the manys confused imitation of one
 Shall he the fair hero of France on the son
 Of his ally seek vengeance destroying perchance
 An innocent lifehere when England and France
 Have forgiven the sins of their fathers of yore
 And baptized a new hope in their sons recent gore
 She went on to tell how the boy had clung still
 To life for the sake of lifes uses until
 From his weak hands the strong effort droppd stricken down
 By the news that the heart of Constance like his own
 Was breaking beneath
 But there Hold he exclaimd
 Interrupting Forbear his whole face was inflamed
 With the hearts swarthy thunder which yet while she spoke
 Had been gathering silentat last the storm broke
 In grief or in wrath
 Tis to him then he cried
 Checking suddenly short the tumultuous stride
 That I owe these late greetingsfor him you are here
 For his sake you seek mefor him it is clear
 You have deignd at the last to bethink you again
 Of this longforgotten existence
 Eugene
 Ha fool that I was he went on and just now
 While you spoke yet my heart was beginning to grow
 Almost boyish again almost sure of ONE friend
 Yet this was the meaning of allthis the end
 Be it so Theres a sort of slow justice admit
 In thisthat the word that mans finger hath writ
 In fire on my heart I return him at last
 Let him learn that wordNever
 Ah still to the past
 Must the present be vassal she said In the hour
 We last parted I urged you to put forth the power
 Which I felt to be yours in the conquest of life
 Yours the promise to strive mineto watch oer the strife
 I foresaw you would conquer you HAVE conquerd much
 Much indeed that is noble I hail it as such
 And am here to record and applaud it I saw
 Not the less in your nature Eugene de Luvois
 One perilone point where I feared you would fail
 To subdue that worst foe which a man can assail
 Himself and I promised that if I should see
 My champion once falter or bend the brave knee
 That moment would bring me again to his side
 That moment is come for that peril was pride
 And you falter I plead for yourself and another
 For that gentle child without father or mother
 To whom you are both I plead soldier of France
 For your own nobler natureand plead for Constance
 At the sound of that name he averted his head
 Constance Ay she enterd MY lone life he said
 When its sun was long set and hung over its night
 Her own starry childhood I have but that light
 In the midst of much darkness Who names me but she
 With titles of love And what rests there for me
 In the silence of age save the voice of that child
 The child of my own better life undefiled
 My creature carved out of my heart of hearts
 Say
 Said the Soeur Seraphineare you able to lay
 Your hand as a knight on your heart as a man
 And swear that whatever may happen you can
 Feel assured for the life you thus cherish
 How so
 He lookd up if the boy should die thus
 Yes I know
 What your look would imply this sleek stranger forsooth
 Because on his cheek was the red rose of youth
 The heart of my niece must break for it
 She cried
 Nay but hear me yet further
 With slow heavy stride
 Unheeding her words he was pacing the tent
 He was muttering low to himself as he went
 Ay these young things lie safe in our heart just so long
 As their wings are in growing and when these are strong
 They break it and farewell the bird flies
 The nun
 Laid her hand on the soldier and murmurd The sun
 Is descending life fleets while we talk thus oh yet
 Let this day upon one final victory set
 And complete a lifes conquest
 He said Understand
 If Constance wed the son of this man by whose hand
 My heart hath been robbd she is lost to my life
 Can her home be my home Can I claim in the wife
 Of that mans son the child of my age At her side
 Shall he stand on my hearth Shall I sue to the bride
 Of enough
 Ah and you immemorial halls
 Of my Norman forefathers whose shadow yet falls
 On my fancy and fuses hope memory past
 Presentall in one silence old trees to the blast
 Of the North Sea repeating the tale of old days
 Nevermore nevermore in the wild bosky ways
 Shall I hear through your umbrage ancestral the wind
 Prophesy as of yore when it shook the deep mind
 Of my boyhood with whispers from out the far years
 Of love fame the raptures life cools down with tears
 Henceforth shall the tread of a Vargrave alone
 Rouse your echoes
 O think not she said of the son
 Of the man whom unjustly you hate only think
 Of this young human creature that cries from the brink
 Of a grave to your mercy
 Recall your own words
 Words my memory mournfully ever records
 How with love may be wreckd a whole life then Eugene
 Look with me still those words in our ears once again
 At this young soldier sinking from life heredraggd down
 By the weight of the love in his heart no renown
 No fame comforts HIM nations shout not above
 The lone grave down to which he is bearing the love
 Which life has rejected Will YOU stand apart
 You with such a loves memory deep in your heart
 You the hero whose life hath perchance been led on
 Through the deeds it hath wrought to the fame it hath won
 By recalling the visions and dreams of a youth
 Such as lies at your door now who have but in truth
 To stretch forth a hand to speak only one word
 And by that word you rescue a life
 He was stirrd
 Still he sought to put from him the cup bowd his face
 on his hand and anon as though wishing to chase
 With one angry gesture his own thoughts aside
 He sprang up brushd past her and bitterly cried
 NoConstance wed a VargraveI cannot consent
 Then up rose the Soeur Seraphine
 The low tent
 In her sudden uprising seemd dwarfd by the height
 From which those imperial eyes pourd the light
 Of their deep silent sadness upon him
 No wonder
 He felt as it were his own stature shrink under
 The compulsion of that grave regard For between
 The Duc de Luvois and the Soeur Seraphine
 At that moment there rose all the height of one soul
 Oer another she lookd down on him from the whole
 Lonely length of a life There were sad nights and days
 There were long months and years in that heartsearching gaze
 And her voice when she spoke with sharp pathos thrilld through
 And transfixd him
 Eugene de Luvois but for you
 I might have been nownot this wandering nun
 But a mother a wifepleading not for the son
 Of another but blessing some child of my own
 Histhe mans that I once loved Hush that which is done
 I regret not I breathe no reproaches Thats best
 Which God sends Twas his will it is mine And the rest
 Of that riddle I will not look back to He reads
 In your heartHe that judges of all thoughts and deeds
 With eyes mine forestall not This only I say
 You have not the right read it you as you may
 To say I am the wrongd
 Have I wrongd theewrongd THEE
 He falterd Lucile ah Lucile
 Nay not me
 She murmurd but man The lone nun standing here
 Has no claim upon earth and is passd from the sphere
 Of earths wrongs and earths reparations But she
 The dead woman Lucile she whose grave is in me
 Demands from her grave reparation to man
 Reparation to God Heed O heed while you can
 This voice from the grave
 Hush he moand I obey
 The Soeur Seraphine There Lucile let this pay
 Every debt that is due to that grave Now lead on
 I follow you Soeur Seraphine To the son
 Of Lord Alfred Vargrave and then
 As he spoke
 He lifted the tentdoor and down the dun smoke
 Pointed out the dark bastions with batteries crownd
 Of the city beneath them
 Then THERE underground
 And valete et plaudite soon as may be
 Let the old tree go down to the earththe old tree
 With the worm at its heart Lay the axe to the root
 Who will miss the old stump so we save the young shoot
 A Vargrave this pays all Lead on In the seed
 Save the forest
 I follow forth forth where you lead


 XXX


 The day was declining a day sick and damp
 In a blank ghostly glare shone the bleak ghostly camp
 Of the English Alone in his dim spectral tent
 Himself the wan spectre of youth with eyes bent
 On the daylight departing the sick man was sitting
 Upon his low pallet These thoughts vaguely flitting
 Crossd the silence between him and death which seemd near
 Pain oerreaches itself so is balkd else how bear
 This intense and intolerable solitude
 With its eye on my heart and its hand on my blood
 Pulse by pulse Day goes down yet she comes not again
 Other suffering doubtless where hope is more plain
 Claims her elsewhere I die strange and scarcely feel sad
 Oh to think of Constance THUS and not to go mad
 But Death it would seem dulls the sense to his own
 Dull doings


 XXXI


 Between those sick eyes and the sun
 A shadow fell thwart


 XXXII


 Tis the pale nun once more
 But who stands at her side mute and dark in the door
 How oft had he watchd through the glory and gloom
 Of the battle with long longing looks that dim plume
 Which now one stray sunbeam upon it shook stoopd
 To where the tentcurtain dividing was loopd
 How that stern face had haunted and hoverd about
 The dreams it still scared through what fond fear and doubt
 Had the boy yearnd in heart to the hero Whats like
 A boys love for some famous man Oh to strike
 A wild path through the battle down striking perchance
 Some rash foeman too near the great soldier of France
 And so fall in his glorious regard Oft how oft
 Had his heart flashd this hope out whilst watching aloft
 The dim battle that plume dance and dartnever seen
 So near till this moment how eager to glean
 Every stray word droppd through the campbabble in praise
 Of his heroeach tale of old venturous days
 In the desert And now could he speak out his heart
 Face to face with that man ere he died


 XXXIII


 With a start
 The sick soldier sprang up the blood sprang up in him
 To his throat and oerthrew him he reeld back a dim
 Sanguine haze filld his eyes in his ears rose the din
 And rush as of cataracts loosend within
 Through which he saw faintly and heard the pale nun
 Looking larger than life where she stood in the sun
 Point to him and murmur Behold Then that plume
 Seemd to wave like a fire and fade off in the gloom
 Which momently put out the world


 XXXIV


 To his side
 Moved the man the boy dreaded yet loved Ah he sighd
 The smooth brow the fair Vargrave face and those eyes
 All the mothers The old things again
 Do not rise
 You suffer young man

 THE BOY

 Sir I die

 THE DUKE

 Not so young

 THE BOY

 So young yes and yet I have tangled among
 The frayd warp and woof of this brief life of mine
 Other lives than my own Could my death but untwine
 The vext skein but it will not Yes Duke youngso young
 And I knew you not yet I have done you a wrong
 Irreparable late too late to repair
 If I knew any means but I know none I swear
 If this broken fraction of time could extend
 Into infinite lives of atonement no end
 Would seem too remote for my grief could that be
 To include it Not too late however for me
 To entreat is it too late for you to forgive

 THE DUKE

 You wrongmy forgivenessexplain

 THE BOY

 Could I live
 Such a very few hours left to life yet I shrink
 I falter Yes Duke your forgiveness I think
 Should free my soul hence
 Ah you could not surmise
 That a boys beating heart burning thoughts longing eyes
 Were following you evermore heeded not
 While the battle was flowing between us nor what
 Eager dubious footsteps at nightfall oft went
 With the wind and the rain round and round your blind tent
 Persistent and wild as the wind and the rain
 Unnoticed as these weak as these and as vain
 Oh how obdurate then lookd your tent The waste air
 Grew stern at the gleam which said Off he is there
 I know not what merciful mystery now
 Brings you here whence the man whom you see lying low
 Other footsteps not those must soon bear to the grave
 But death is at hand and the few words I have
 Yet to speak I must speak them at once
 Duke I swear
 As I lie here Deaths angel too close not to hear
 That I meant not this wrong to you Duc de Luvois
 I loved your nieceloved why I LOVE her I saw
 And seeing how could I but love her I seemd
 Born to love her Alas were that all Had I dreamd
 Of this loves cruel consequence as it rests now
 Ever fearfully present before me I vow
 That the secret unknown had gone down to the tomb
 Into which I descend Oh why whilst there was room
 In life left for warning had no one the heart
 To warn me Had any one whisperd Depart
 To the hope the whole world seemd in league then to nurse
 Had any one hinted Beware of the curse
 Which is coming There was not a voice raised to tell
 Not a hand moved to warn from the blow ere it fell
 And then then the blow fell on BOTH This is why
 I implore you to pardon that great injury
 Wrought on her and through her wrought on you Heaven knows
 How unwittingly

 THE DUKE

 Ah and young soldier suppose
 That I came here to seek not grant pardon

 THE BOY

 Of whom

 THE DUKE

 Of yourself

 THE BOY

 Duke I bear in my heart to the tomb
 No boyish resentment not one lonely thought
 That honors you not In all this there is naught
 Tis for me to forgive
 Every glorious act
 Of your great life starts forward an eloquent fact
 To confirm in my boys heart its faith in your own
 And have I not hoarded to ponder upon
 A hundred great acts from your life Nay all these
 Were they so many lying and false witnesses
 Does there rest not ONE voice which was never untrue
 I believe in Constance Duke as she does in you
 In this great world around us wherever we turn
 Some grief irremediable we discern
 And yetthere sits God calm in Heaven above
 Do we trust one whit less in his justice or love
 I judge not

 THE DUKE

 Enough Hear at last then the truth
 Your father and Ifoes we were in our youth
 It matters not why Yet thus much understand
 The hope of my youth was signd out by his hand
 I was not of those whom the buffets of fate
 Tame and teach and my heart buried slain love in hate
 If your own frank young heart yet unconscious of all
 Which turns the hearts blood in its springtide to gall
 And unable to guess even aught that the furrow
 Across these gray brows hides of sin or of sorrow
 Comprehends not the evil and grief of my life
 Twill at least comprehend how intense was the strife
 Which is closed in this act of atonement whereby
 I seek in the son of my youths enemy
 The friend of my age Let the present release
 Here acquitted the past In the name of my niece
 Whom for my life in yours as a hostage I give
 Are you great enough boy to forgive meand live

 Whilst he spoke thus a doubtful tumultuous joy
 Chased its fleeting effects oer the face of the boy
 As when some stormy moon in a long cloud confined
 Struggles outward through shadows the varying wind
 Alternates and bursts selfsurprised from her prison
 So that slow joy grew clear in his face He had risen
 To answer the Duke but strength faild every limb
 A strange happy feebleness trembled through him
 With a faint cry of rapturous wonder he sank
 On the breast of the nun who stood near
 Yes boy thank
 This guardian angel the Duke said Iyou
 We owe all to her Crown her work Live be true
 To your young lifes fair promise and live for her sake
 Yes Duke I will live I MUST livelive to make
 My whole life the answer you claim the boy said
 For joy does not kill
 Back again the faint head
 Declined on the nuns gentle bosom She saw
 His lips quiver and motiond the Duke to withdraw
 And leave them a moment together
 He eyed
 Them both with a wistful regard turnd and sighd
 And lifted the tentdoor and passd from the tent


 XXXV


 Like a furnace the fervid intense occident
 From its hot seething levels a great glare struck up
 On the sick metal sky And as out of a cup
 Some witch watches boiling wild portents arise
 Monstrous clouds massd misshapen and tingd with strange dyes
 Hoverd over the red fume and changed to weird shapes
 As of snakes salamanders efts lizards storks apes
 Chimeras and hydras whilstever the same
 In the midst of all these creatures fused by his flame
 And changed by his influence changeless as when
 Ere he lit down to death generations of men
 Oer that crude and ungainly creation which there
 With wild shapes this cloudworld seemd to mimic in air
 The eye of Heavens alljudging witness he shone
 And shall shine on the ages we reach notthe sun



 XXXVI


 Nature posted her parable thus in the skies
 And the mans heart bore witness Lifes vapors arise
 And fall pass and change group themselves and revolve
 Round the great central life which is love these dissolve
 And resume themselves here assume beauty there terror
 And the phantasmagoria of infinite error
 And endless complexity lasts but a while
 Lifes self the immortal immutable smile
 Of God on the soul in the deep heart of Heaven
 Lives changeless unchanged and our morning and even
 Are earths alternations not Heavens


 XXXVII


 While he yet
 Watched the skies with this thought in his heart while he set
 Thus unconsciously all his life forth in his mind
 Summd it up searchd it out proved it vapor and wind
 And embraced the new life which that hour had reveald
 Loves life which earths life had defaced and conceald
 Lucile left the tent and stood by him
 Her tread
 Aroused him and turning towards her he said
 O Soeur Seraphine are you happy
 Eugene
 What is happier than to have hoped not in vain
 She answerdAnd you
 Yes
 You do not repent
 No
 Thank Heaven she murmurd He musingly bent
 His looks on the sunset and somewhat apart
 Where he stood sighd as though to his innermost heart
 O blessd are they amongst whom I was not
 Whose morning unclouded without stain or spot
 Predicts a pure evening who sunlike in light
 Have traversed unsullied the world and set bright
 But she in response Mark yon ship far away
 Asleep on the wave in the last light of day
 With all its hushd thunders shut up Would you know
 A thought which came to me a few days ago
 Whilst watching those ships When the great Ship of Life
 Surviving though shatterd the tumult and strife
 Of earths angry elementmasts broken short
 Decks drenchd bulwarks beatendrives safe into port
 When the Pilot of Galilee seen on the strand
 Stretches over the waters a welcoming hand
 When heeding no longer the seas baffled roar
 The mariner turns to his rest evermore
 What will then be the answer the helmsman must give
 Will it be Lo our logbook Thus once did we live
 In the zones of the South thus we traversed the seas
 Of the Orient there dwelt with the Hesperides
 Thence followd the west wind here eastward we turnd
 The stars faild us there just here land we discernd
 On our lee there the storm overtook us at last
 That day went the bowsprit the next day the mast
 There the mermen came round us and there we saw bask
 A siren The Captain of Port will he ask
 Any one of such questions I cannot think so
 But What is the last Bill of Health you can show
 NotHow fared the soul through the trials she passd
 ButWhat is the state of that soul at the last

 May it be so he sighd There the sun drops behold
 And indeed whilst he spoke all the purple and gold
 In the west had turnd ashen save one fading strip
 Of light that yet gleamd from the dark nether lip
 Of a long reef of cloud and oer sullen ravines
 And ridges the raw damps were hanging white screens
 Of melancholy mist
 Nunc dimittis she said
 O God of the living whilst yet mid the dead
 And the dying we stand here alive and thy days
 Returning admit space for prayer and for praise
 In both these confirm us
 The helmsman Eugene
 Needs the compass to steer by Pray always Again
 We two part each to work out Heavens will you I trust
 In the worlds ample witness and I as I must
 In secret and silence you love fame await
 Me sorrow and sickness We meet at one gate
 When alls over The ways they are many and wide
 And seldom are two ways the same Side by side
 May we stand at the same little door when alls done
 The ways they are many the end it is one
 He that knocketh shall enter who asks shall obtain
 And who seeketh he findeth Remember Eugene
 She turnd to depart
 Whither whither he said
 She stretchd forth her hand where already outspread
 On the darkend horizon remotely they saw
 The French campfires kindling
 See yonder vast host with its manifold heart
 Made as one mans by one hope The hope tis your part
 To aid towards achievement to save from reverse
 Mine through suffering to soothe and through sickness to nurse
 I go to my work you to yours


 XXXVIII


 Whilst she spoke
 On the wide wasting evening there distantly broke
 The low roll of musketry Straightway anon
 From the dim Flagstaff Battery bellowd a gun
 Our chasseurs are at it he mutterd
 She turnd
 Smiled and passd up the twilight
 He faintly discernd
 Her form now and then on the flat lurid sky
 Rise and sink and recede through the mists by and by
 The vapors closed round and he saw her no more


 XXXIX


 Nor shall we For her mission accomplishd is oer
 The mission of genius on earth To uplift
 Purify and confirm by its own gracious gift
 The world in despite of the worlds dull endeavor
 To degrade and drag down and oppose it forever
 The mission of genius to watch and to wait
 To renew to redeem and to regenerate
 The mission of woman on earth to give birth
 To the mercy of Heaven descending on earth
 The mission of woman permitted to bruise
 The head of the serpent and sweetly infuse
 Through the sorrow and sin of earths registerd curse
 The blessing which mitigates all born to nurse
 And to soothe and to solace to help and to heal
 The sick world that leans on her This was Lucile


 XL


 A power hid in pathos a fire veild in cloud
 Yet still burning outward a branch which though bowd
 By the bird in its passage springs upward again
 Through all symbols I search for her sweetnessin vain
 Judge her love by her life For our life is but love
 In act Pure was hers and the dear God above
 Who knows what His creatures have need of for life
 And whose love includes all loves through much patient strife
 Led her soul into peace Love though love may be given
 In vain is yet lovely Her own native heaven
 More clearly she mirrord as lifes troubled dream
 Wore away and love sighd into rest like a stream
 That breaks its heart over wild rocks toward the shore
 Of the great sea which hushes it up evermore
 With its little wild wailing No stream from its source
 Flows seaward how lonely soever its course
 But what some land is gladdend No star ever rose
 And set without influence somewhere Who knows
 What earth needs from earths lowest creature No life
 Can be pure in its purpose and strong in its strife
 And all life not be purer and stronger thereby
 The spirits of just men made perfect on high
 The army of martyrs who stand by the Throne
 And gaze into the face that makes glorious their own
 Know this surely at last Honest love honest sorrow
 Honest work for the day honest hope for the morrow
 Are these worth nothing more than the hand they make weary
 The heart they have saddend the life they leave dreary
 Hush the sevenhold heavens to the voice of the Spirit
 Echo He that oercometh shall all things inherit


 XLI


 The moon was in fire carried up through the fog
 The loud fortress barkd at her like a chained dog
 The horizon pulsed flame the air sound All without
 War and winter and twilight and terror and doubt
 All within light warmth calm
 In the twilight longwhile
 Eugene de Luvois with a deep thoughtful smile
 Lingerd looking and listening lone by the tent
 At last he withdrew and night closed as he went
