THE FROZEN DEEP

First SceneThe Ballroom



Chapter 1

The date is between twenty and thirty years ago The place is an English
seaport The time is night And the business of the moment isdancing

The Mayor and Corporation of the town are giving a grand ball in
celebration of the departure of an Arctic expedition from their port
The ships of the expedition are two in numberthe _Wanderer_ and the
_Seamew_ They are to sail in search of the Northwest Passage on the
next day with the morning tide

Honor to the Mayor and Corporation It is a brilliant ball The band is
complete The room is spacious The large conservatory opening out of it
is pleasantly lighted with Chinese lanterns and beautifully decorated
with shrubs and flowers All officers of the army and navy who are
present wear their uniforms in honor of the occasion Among the ladies
the display of dresses a subject which the men dont understand is
bewilderingand the average of beauty a subject which the men do
understand is the highest average attainable in all parts of the room

For the moment the dance which is in progress is a quadrille General
admiration selects two of the ladies who are dancing as its favorite
objects One is a dark beauty in the prime of womanhoodthe wife of
First Lieutenant Crayford of the _Wanderer_ The other is a young girl
pale and delicate dressed simply in white with no ornament on her head
but her own lovely brown hair This is Miss Clara Burnhaman orphan
She is Mrs Crayfords dearest friend and she is to stay with Mrs
Crayford during the lieutenants absence in the Arctic regions She
is now dancing with the lieutenant himself for partner and with Mrs
Crayford and Captain Helding commanding officer of the _Wanderer_ for
visavisin plain English for opposite couple

The conversation between Captain Helding and Mrs Crayford in one
of the intervals of the dance turns on Miss Burnham The captain is
greatly interested in Clara He admires her beauty but he thinks her
mannerfor a young girlstrangely serious and subdued Is she in
delicate health

Mrs Crayford shakes her head sighs mysteriously and answers

In _very_ delicate health Captain Helding

Consumptive

Not in the least

I am glad to hear that She is a charming creature Mrs Crayford She
interests me indescribably If I was only twenty years youngerperhaps
as I am not twenty years younger I had better not finish the sentence
Is it indiscreet my dear lady to inquire what _is_ the matter with
her

It might be indiscreet on the part of a stranger said Mrs Crayford
An old friend like you may make any inquiries I wish I could tell
you what is the matter with Clara It is a mystery to the doctors
themselves Some of the mischief is due in my humble opinion to the
manner in which she has been brought up

Ay ay A bad school I suppose

Very bad Captain Helding But not the sort of school which you have in
your mind at this moment Claras early years were spent in a lonely old
house in the Highlands of Scotland The ignorant people about her were
the people who did the mischief which I have just been speaking of
They filled her mind with the superstitions which are still respected as
truths in the wild Northespecially the superstition called the Second
Sight

God bless me cried the captain you dont mean to say she believes
in such stuff as that In these enlightened times too

Mrs Crayford looked at her partner with a satirical smile

In these enlightened times Captain Helding we only believe in dancing
tables and in messages sent from the other world by spirits who cant
spell By comparison with such superstitions as these even the Second
Sight has somethingin the shape of poetryto recommend it surely
Estimate for yourself she continued seriously the effect of
such surroundings as I have described on a delicate sensitive young
creaturea girl with a naturally imaginative temperament leading a
lonely neglected life Is it so very surprising that she should
catch the infection of the superstition about her And is it quite
incomprehensible that her nervous system should suffer accordingly at a
very critical period of her life

Not at all Mrs Crayfordnot at all maam as you put it Still it
is a little startling to a commonplace man like me to meet a young
lady at a ball who believes in the Second Sight Does she really profess
to see into the future Am I to understand that she positively falls
into a trance and sees people in distant countries and foretells
events to come That is the Second Sight is it not

That is the Second Sight captain And that is really and positively
what she does

The young lady who is dancing opposite to us

The young lady who is dancing opposite to us

The captain waited a littleletting the new flood of information which
had poured in on him settle itself steadily in his mind This process
accomplished the Arctic explorer proceeded resolutely on his way to
further discoveries

May I ask maam if you have ever seen her in a state of trance with
your own eyes he inquired

My sister and I both saw her in the trance little more than a month
since Mrs Crayford replied She had been nervous and irritable all
the morning and we took her out into the garden to breathe the fresh
air Suddenly without any reason for it the color left her face She
stood between us insensible to touch insensible to sound motionless
as stone and cold as death in a moment The first change we noticed
came after a lapse of some minutes Her hands began to move slowly as
if she was groping in the dark Words dropped one by one from her lips
in a lost vacant tone as if she was talking in her sleep Whether
what she said referred to past or future I cannot tell you She spoke of
persons in a foreign countryperfect strangers to my sister and to me
After a little interval she suddenly became silent A momentary color
appeared in her face and left it again Her eyes closedher feet
failed herand she sank insensible into our arms

Sank insensible into your arms repeated the captain absorbing his
new information Most extraordinary Andin this state of healthshe
goes out to parties and dances More extraordinary still

You are entirely mistaken said Mrs Crayford She is only here
tonight to please me and she is only dancing to please my husband
As a rule she shuns all society The doctor recommends change and
amusement for her She wont listen to him Except on rare occasions
like this she persists in remaining at home

Captain Helding brightened at the allusion to the doctor Something
practical might be got out of the doctor Scientific man Sure to see
this very obscure subject under a new light How does it strike the
doctor now said the captain Viewed simply as a Case maam how does
it strike the doctor

He will give no positive opinion Mrs Crayford answered He told
me that such cases as Claras were by no means unfamiliar to medical
practice We know he told me that certain disordered conditions of
the brain and the nervous system produce results quite as extraordinary
as any that you have describedand there our knowledge ends Neither my
science nor any mans science can clear up the mystery in this case
It is an especially difficult case to deal with because Miss Burnhams
early associations dispose her to attach a superstitious importance to
the maladythe hysterical malady as some doctors would call itfrom
which she suffers I can give you instructions for preserving her
general health and I can recommend you to try some change in her
lifeprovided you first relieve her mind of any secret anxieties that
may possibly be preying on it

The captain smiled selfapprovingly The doctor had justified his
anticipations The doctor had suggested a practical solution of the
difficulty

Ay ay At last we have hit the nail on the head Secret anxieties
Yes yes Plain enough now A disappointment in loveeh Mrs
Crayford

I dont know Captain Helding I am quite in the dark Claras
confidence in mein other matters unboundedis in this matter of her
supposed anxieties a confidence still withheld In all else we are
like sisters I sometimes fear there may indeed be some trouble
preying secretly on her mind I sometimes feel a little hurt at her
incomprehensible silence

Captain Helding was ready with his own practical remedy for this
difficulty

Encouragement is all she wants maam Take my word for it this
matter rests entirely with you Its all in a nutshell Encourage her to
confide in youand she _will_ confide

I am waiting to encourage her captain until she is left alone with
meafter you have all sailed for the Arctic seas In the meantime will
you consider what I have said to you as intended for your ear only And
will you forgive me if I own that the turn the subject has taken does
not tempt me to pursue it any further

The captain took the hint He instantly changed the subject choosing
on this occasion safe professional topics He spoke of ships that were
ordered on foreign service and finding that these as subjects failed
to interest Mrs Crayford he spoke next of ships that were ordered home
again This last experiment produced its effectan effect which the
captain had not bargained for

Do you know he began that the _Atalanta_ is expected back from the
West Coast of Africa every day Have you any acquaintances among the
officers of that ship

As it so happened he put those questions to Mrs Crayford while they
were engaged in one of the figures of the dance which brought them
within hearing of the opposite couple At the same momentto the
astonishment of her friends and admirersMiss Clara Burnham threw the
quadrille into confusion by making a mistake Everybody waited to see
her set the mistake right She made no attempt to set it rightshe
turned deadly pale and caught her partner by the arm

The heat she said faintly Take me awaytake me into the air

Lieutenant Crayford instantly led her out of the dance and took her
into the cool and empty conservatory at the end of the room As a
matter of course Captain Helding and Mrs Crayford left the quadrille
at the same time The captain saw his way to a joke

Is this the trance coming on he whispered If it is as commander
of the Arctic expedition I have a particular request to make Will
the Second Sight oblige me by seeing the shortest way to the Northwest
Passage before we leave England

Mrs Crayford declined to humor the joke If you will excuse my leaving
you she said quietly I will try and find out what is the matter with
Miss Burnham

At the entrance to the conservatory Mrs Crayford encountered her
husband The lieutenant was of middle age tall and comely A man with
a winning simplicity and gentleness in his manner and an irresistible
kindness in his brave blue eyes In one word a man whom everybody
lovedincluding his wife

Dont be alarmed said the lieutenant The heat has overcome
herthats all

Mrs Crayford shook her head and looked at her husband half
satirically half fondly

You dear old innocent she exclaimed that excuse may do for _you_
For my part I dont believe a word of it Go and get another partner
and leave Clara to me

She entered the conservatory and seated herself by Claras side



Chapter 2


Now my dear Mrs Crayford began what does this mean

Nothing

That wont do Clara Try again

The heat of the room

That wont do either Say that you choose to keep your own secrets
and I shall understand what you mean

Claras sad clear gray eyes looked up for the first time in Mrs
Crayfords face and suddenly became dimmed with tears

If I only dared tell you she murmured I hold so to your good
opinion of me Lucyand I am so afraid of losing it

Mrs Crayfords manner changed Her eyes rested gravely and anxiously on
Claras face

You know as well as I do that nothing can shake my affection for you
she said Do justice my child to your old friend There is nobody
here to listen to what we say Open your heart Clara I see you are in
trouble and I want to comfort you

Clara began to yield In other words she began to make conditions

Will you promise to keep what I tell you a secret from every living
creature she began

Mrs Crayford met that question by putting a question on her side

Does every living creature include my husband

Your husband more than anybody I love him I revere him He is so
noble he is so good If I told him what I am going to tell you he
would despise me Own it plainly Lucy if I am asking too much in
asking you to keep a secret from your husband

Nonsense child When you are married you will know that the easiest
of all secrets to keep is a secret from your husband I give you my
promise Now begin

Clara hesitated painfully

I dont know how to begin she exclaimed with a burst of despair
The words wont come to me

Then I must help you Do you feel ill tonight Do you feel as you felt
that day when you were with my sister and me in the garden

Oh no

You are not ill you are not really affected by the heatand yet you
turn as pale as ashes and you are obliged to leave the quadrille There
must be some reason for this

There is a reason Captain Helding

Captain Helding What in the name of wonder has the captain to do with
it

He told you something about the _Atalanta_ He said the _Atalanta_ was
expected back from Africa immediately

Well and what of that Is there anybody in whom you are interested
coming home in the ship

Somebody whom I am afraid of is coming home in the ship

Mrs Crayfords magnificent black eyes opened wide in amazement

My dear Clara do you really mean what you say

Wait a little Lucy and you shall judge for yourself We must go
backif I am to make you understand meto the year before we knew each
otherto the last year of my fathers life Did I ever tell you that my
father moved southward for the sake of his health to a house in Kent
that was lent to him by a friend

No my dear I dont remember ever hearing of the house in Kent Tell
me about it

There is nothing to tell except this the new house was near a fine
countryseat standing in its own park The owner of the place was
a gentleman named Wardour He too was one of my fathers Kentish
friends He had an only son

She paused and played nervously with her fan Mrs Crayford looked at
her attentively Claras eyes remained fixed on her fanClara said no
more What was the sons name asked Mrs Crayford quietly

Richard

Am I right Clara in suspecting that Mr Richard Wardour admired you

The question produced its intended effect The question helped Clara to
go on

I hardly knew at first she said whether he admired me or not
He was very strange in his waysheadstrong terribly headstrong and
passionate but generous and affectionate in spite of his faults of
temper Can you understand such a character

Such characters exist by thousands I have my faults of temper I begin
to like Richard already Go on

The days went by Lucy and the weeks went by We were thrown very
much together I began little by little to have some suspicion of the
truth

And Richard helped to confirm your suspicions of course

No He was notunhappily for mehe was not that sort of man He never
spoke of the feeling with which he regarded me It was I who saw it I
couldnt help seeing it I did all I could to show that I was willing to
be a sister to him and that I could never be anything else He did not
understand me or he would not I cant say which

Would not is the most likely my dear Go on

It might have been as you say There was a strange rough bashfulness
about him He confused and puzzled me He never spoke out He seemed
to treat me as if our future lives had been provided for while we were
children What could I do Lucy

Do You could have asked your father to end the difficulty for you

Impossible You forget what I have just told you My father was
suffering at that time under the illness which afterward caused his
death He was quite unfit to interfere

Was there no one else who could help you

No one

No lady in whom you could confide

I had acquaintances among the ladies in the neighborhood I had no
friends

What did you do then

Nothing I hesitated I put off coming to an explanation with him
unfortunately until it was too late

What do you mean by too late

You shall hear I ought to have told you that Richard Wardour is in the
navy

Indeed I am more interested in him than ever Well

One spring day Richard came to our house to take leave of us before he
joined his ship I thought he was gone and I went into the next room
It was my own sittingroom and it opened on to the garden

Yes

Richard must have been watching me He suddenly appeared in the garden
Without waiting for me to invite him he walked into the room I was a
little startled as well as surprised but I managed to hide it I said
What is it Mr Wardour He stepped close up to me he said in his
quick rough way Clara I am going to the African coast If I live
I shall come back promoted and we both know what will happen then
He kissed me I was half frightened half angry Before I could compose
myself to say a word he was out in the garden againhe was gone I
ought to have spoken I know It was not honorable not kind toward him
You cant reproach me for my want of courage and frankness more bitterly
than I reproach myself

My dear child I dont reproach you I only think you might have
written to him

I did write

Plainly

Yes I told him in so many words that he was deceiving himself and
that I could never marry him

Plain enough in all conscience Having said that surely you are not
to blame What are you fretting about now

Suppose my letter has never reached him

Why should you suppose anything of the sort

What I wrote required an answer Lucy_asked_ for an answer The
answer has never come What is the plain conclusion My letter has never
reached him And the _Atalanta_ is expected back Richard Wardour is
returning to EnglandRichard Wardour will claim me as his wife You
wondered just now if I really meant what I said Do you doubt it still

Mrs Crayford leaned back absently in her chair For the first time
since the conversation had begun she let a question pass without making
a reply The truth is Mrs Crayford was thinking

She saw Claras position plainly she understood the disturbing effect
of it on the mind of a young girl Still making all allowances
she felt quite at a loss so far to account for Claras excessive
agitation Her quick observing faculty had just detected that Claras
face showed no signs of relief now that she had unburdened herself
of her secret There was something clearly under the surface
heresomething of importance that still remained to be discovered A
shrewd doubt crossed Mrs Crayfords mind and inspired the next words
which she addressed to her young friend

My dear she said abruptly have you told me all

Clara started as if the question terrified her Feeling sure that she
now had the clew in her hand Mrs Crayford deliberately repeated her
question in another form of words Instead of answering Clara suddenly
looked up At the same moment a faint flush of color appeared in her
face for the first time

Looking up instinctively on her side Mrs Crayford became aware of the
presence in the conservatory of a young gentleman who was claiming
Clara as his partner in the coming waltz Mrs Crayford fell into
thinking once more Had this young gentleman she asked herself
anything to do with the untold end of the story Was this the true
secret of Clara Burnhams terror at the impending return of Richard
Wardour Mrs Crayford decided on putting her doubts to the test

A friend of yours my dear she asked innocently Suppose you
introduce us to each other

Clara confusedly introduced the young gentleman

Mr Francis Aldersley Lucy Mr Aldersley belongs to the Arctic
expedition

Attached to the expedition Mrs Crayford repeated I am attached
to the expedition tooin my way I had better introduce myself Mr
Aldersley as Clara seems to have forgotten to do it for me I am Mrs
Crayford My husband is Lieutenant Crayford of the _Wanderer_ Do you
belong to that ship

I have not the honor Mrs Crayford I belong to the _Seamew_

Mrs Crayfords superb eyes looked shrewdly backward and forward between
Clara and Francis Aldersley and saw the untold sequel to Claras story
The young officer was a bright handsome gentlemanlike lad Just the
person to seriously complicate the difficulty with Richard Wardour
There was no time for making any further inquiries The band had begun
the prelude to the waltz and Francis Aldersley was waiting for his
partner With a word of apology to the young man Mrs Crayford drew
Clara aside for a moment and spoke to her in a whisper

One word my dear before you return to the ballroom It may sound
conceited after the little you have told me but I think I understand
your position _now_ better than you do yourself Do you want to hear my
opinion

I am longing to hear it Lucy I want your opinion I want your
advice

You shall have both in the plainest and fewest words First my
opinion You have no choice but to come to an explanation with Mr
Wardour as soon as he returns Second my advice If you wish to make
the explanation easy to both sides take care that you make it in the
character of a free woman

She laid a strong emphasis on the last three words and looked pointedly
at Francis Aldersley as she pronounced them I wont keep you from your
partner any longer Clara she resumed and led the way back to the
ballroom



Chapter 3


The burden on Claras mind weighs on it more heavily than ever after
what Mrs Crayford has said to her She is too unhappy to feel the
inspiriting influence of the dance After a turn round the room she
complains of fatigue Mr Francis Aldersley looks at the conservatory
still as invitingly cool and empty as ever leads her back to it
and places her on a seat among the shrubs She triesvery feeblyto
dismiss him

Dont let me keep you from dancing Mr Aldersley

He seats himself by her side and feasts his eyes on the lovely downcast
face that dares not turn toward him He whispers to her

Call me Frank

She longs to call him Frankshe loves him with all her heart But Mrs
Crayfords warning words are still in her mind She never opens her
lips Her lover moves a little closer and asks another favor Men are
all alike on these occasions Silence invariably encourages them to try
again

Clara have you forgotten what I said at the concert yesterday May I
say it again

No

We sail tomorrow for the Arctic seas I may not return for years
Dont send me away without hope Think of the long lonely time in the
dark North Make it a happy time for _me_

Though he speaks with the fervor of a man he is little more than a lad
he is only twenty years old and he is going to risk his young life on
the frozen deep Clara pities him as she never pitied any human creature
before He gently takes her hand She tries to release it

What not even that little favor on the last night

Her faithful heart takes his part in spite of her Her hand remains in
his and feels its soft persuasive pressure She is a lost woman It is
only a question of time now

Clara do you love me

There is a pause She shrinks from looking at himshe trembles with
strange contradictory sensations of pleasure and pain His arm steals
round her he repeats his question in a whisper his lips almost touch
her little rosy ear as he says it again

Do you love me

She closes her eyes faintlyshe hears nothing but those wordsfeels
nothing but his arm round herforgets Mrs Crayfords warningforgets
Richard Wardour himselfturns suddenly with a loving womans desperate
disregard of everything but her lovenestles her head on his bosom and
answers him in that way at last

He lifts the beautiful drooping headtheir lips meet in their first
kissthey are both in heaven it is Clara who brings them back to earth
again with a startit is Clara who says Oh what have I doneas
usual when it is too late

Frank answers the question

You have made me happy my angel Now when I come back I come back to
make you my wife

She shudders She remembers Richard Wardour again at those words

Mind she says nobody is to know we are engaged till I permit you to
mention it Remember that

He promises to remember it His arm tries to wind round her once
more No She is mistress of herself she can positively dismiss him
nowafter she has let him kiss her

Go she says I want to see Mrs Crayford Find her Say I am here
waiting to speak to her Go at once Frankfor my sake

There is no alternative but to obey her His eyes drink a last draught
of her beauty He hurries away on his errandthe happiest man in the
room Five minutes since she was only his partner in the dance He has
spokenand she has pledged herself to be his partner for life



Chapter 4


It was not easy to find Mrs Crayford in the crowd Searching here and
searching there Frank became conscious of a stranger who appeared
to be looking for somebody on his side He was a dark heavybrowed
stronglybuilt man dressed in a shabby old naval officers uniform
His mannerstrikingly resolute and selfcontainedwas unmistakably
the manner of a gentleman He wound his way slowly through the crowd
stopping to look at every lady whom he passed and then looking
away again with a frown Little by little he approached the
conservatoryentered it after a moments reflectiondetected the
glimmer of a white dress in the distance through the shrubs and
flowersadvanced to get a nearer view of the ladyand burst into
Claras presence with a cry of delight

She sprang to her feet She stood before him speechless motionless
struck to stone All her life was in her eyesthe eyes which told her
she was looking at Richard Wardour

He was the first to speak

I am sorry I startled you my darling I forgot everything but the
happiness of seeing you again We only reached our moorings two hours
since I was some time inquiring after you and some time getting my
ticket when they told me you were at the ball Wish me joy Clara I am
promoted I have come back to make you my wife

A momentary change passed over the blank terror of her face Her color
rose faintly her lips moved She abruptly put a question to him

Did you get my letter

He started A letter from you I never received it

The momentary animation died out of her face again She drew back from
him and dropped into a chair He advanced toward her astonished and
alarmed She shrank in the chairshrank as if she was frightened of
him

Clara you have not even shaken hands with me What does it mean

He paused waiting and watching her She made no reply A flash of the
quick temper in him leaped up in his eyes He repeated his last words in
louder and sterner tones

What does it mean

She replied this time His tone had hurt herhis tone had roused her
sinking courage

It means Mr Wardour that you have been mistaken from the first

How have I been mistaken

You have been under a wrong impression and you have given me no
opportunity of setting you right

In what way have I been wrong

You have been too hasty and too confident about yourself and about me
You have entirely misunderstood me I am grieved to distress you
but for your sake I must speak plainly I am your friend always Mr
Wardour I can never be your wife

He mechanically repeated the last words He seemed to doubt whether he
had heard her aright

You can never be my wife

Never

Why

There was no answer She was incapable of telling him a falsehood She
was ashamed to tell him the truth

He stooped over her and suddenly possessed himself of her hand Holding
her hand firmly he stooped a little lower searching for the signs
which might answer him in her face His own face darkened slowly while
he looked He was beginning to suspect her and he acknowledged it in
his next words

Something has changed you toward me Clara Somebody has influenced you
against me Is ityou force me to ask the questionis it some other
man

You have no right to ask me that

He went on without noticing what she had said to him

Has that other man come between you and me I speak plainly on my side
Speak plainly on yours

I _have_ spoken I have nothing more to say

There was a pause She saw the warning light which told of the fire
within him growing brighter and brighter in his eyes She felt his
grasp strengthening on her hand He appealed to her for the last time

Reflect he said reflect before it is too late Your silence will
not serve you If you persist in not answering me I shall take your
silence as a confession Do you hear me

I hear you

Clara Burnham I am not to be trifled with Clara Burnham I insist on
the truth Are you false to me

She resented that searching question with a womans keen sense of the
insult that is implied in doubting her to her face

Mr Wardour you forget yourself when you call me to account in that
way I never encouraged you I never gave you promise or pledge

He passionately interrupted her before she could say more

You have engaged yourself in my absence Your words own it your looks
own it You have engaged yourself to another man

If I _have_ engaged myself what right have you to complain of it she
answered firmly What right have you to control my actions

The next words died away on her lips He suddenly dropped her hand A
marked change appeared in the expression of his eyesa change which
told her of the terrible passions that she had let loose in him She
read dimly read something in his face which made her tremblenot for
herself but for Frank

Little by little the dark color faded out of his face His deep voice
dropped suddenly to a low and quiet tone as he spoke the parting words

Say no more Miss Burnhamyou have said enough I am answered I am
dismissed He paused and stepping close up to her laid his hand on
her arm

The time may come he said when I shall forgive you But the man who
has robbed me of you shall rue the day when you and he first met

He turned and left her

A few minutes later Mrs Crayford entering the conservatory was met
by one of the attendants at the ball The man stopped as if he wished to
speak to her

What do you want she asked

I beg your pardon maam Do you happen to have a smellingbottle about
you There is a young lady in the conservatory who is taken faint




Between the ScenesThe Landing Stage



Chapter 5


The morning of the next daythe morning on which the ships were to
sailcame bright and breezy Mrs Crayford having arranged to follow
her husband to the waterside and see the last of him before he
embarked entered Claras room on her way out of the house anxious
to hear how her young friend passed the night To her astonishment she
found Clara had risen and was dressed like herself to go out

What does this mean my dear After what you suffered last nightafter
the shock of seeing that manwhy dont you take my advice and rest in
your bed

I cant rest I have not slept all night Have you been out yet

No

Have you seen or heard anything of Richard Wardour

What an extraordinary question

Answer my question Dont trifle with me

Compose yourself Clara I have neither seen nor heard anything of
Richard Wardour Take my word for it he is far enough away by this
time

No He is here He is near us All night long the presentiment has
pursued meFrank and Richard Wardour will meet

My dear child what are you thinking of They are total strangers to
each other

Something will happen to bring them together I feel it I know it
They will meetthere will be a mortal quarrel between themand I shall
be to blame Oh Lucy why didnt I take your advice Why was I
mad enough to let Frank know that I loved him Are you going to the
landingstage I am all readyI must go with you

You must not think of it Clara There will be crowding and confusion
at the waterside You are not strong enough to bear it WaitI wont
be long awaywait till I come back

I must and will go with you Crowd _He_ will be among the crowd
Confusion In that confusion _he_ will find his way to Frank Dont ask
me to wait I shall go mad if I wait I shall not know a moments ease
until I have seen Frank with my own eyes safe in the boat which takes
him to his ship You have got your bonnet on what are we stopping here
for Come or I shall go without you Look at the clock we have not a
moment to lose

It was useless to contend with her Mrs Crayford yielded The two women
left the house together

The landingstage as Mrs Crayford had predicted was thronged with
spectators Not only the relatives and friends of the Arctic voyagers
but strangers as well had assembled in large numbers to see the ships
sail Claras eyes wandered affrightedly hither and thither among the
strange faces in the crowd searching for the one face that she dreaded
to see and not finding it So completely were her nerves unstrung that
she started with a cry of alarm on suddenly hearing Franks voice behind
her

The _Seamew_s boats are waiting he said I must go darling How
pale you are looking Clara Are you ill

She never answered She questioned him with wild eyes and trembling
lips

Has anything happened to you Frank anything out of the common

Frank laughed at the strange question

Anything out of the common he repeated Nothing that I know
of except sailing for the Arctic seas Thats out of the common I
supposeisnt it

Has anybody spoken to you since last night Has any stranger followed
you in the street

Frank turned in blank amazement to Mrs Crayford

What on earth does she mean

Mrs Crayfords lively invention supplied her with an answer on the spur
of the moment

Do you believe in dreams Frank Of course you dont Clara has been
dreaming about you and Clara is foolish enough to believe in dreams
Thats allits not worth talking about Hark they are calling you
Say goodby or you will be too late for the boat

Frank took Claras hand Long afterwardin the dark Arctic days in the
dreary Arctic nightshe remembered how coldly and how passively that
hand lay in his

Courage Clara he said gayly A sailors sweetheart must accustom
herself to partings The time will soon pass Goodby my darling
Goodby my wife

He kissed the cold hand he looked his lastfor many a long year
perhapsat the pale and beautiful face How she loves me he
thought How the parting distresses her He still held her hand he
would have lingered longer if Mrs Crayford had not wisely waived all
ceremony and pushed him away

The two ladies followed him at a safe distance through the crowd and
saw him step into the boat The oars struck the water Frank waved his
cap to Clara In a moment more a vessel at anchor hid the boat from
view They had seen the last of him on his way to the Frozen Deep

No Richard Wardour in the boat said Mrs Crayford No Richard
Wardour on the shore Let this be a lesson to you my dear Never be
foolish enough to believe in presentiments again

Claras eyes still wandered suspiciously to and fro among the crowd

Are you not satisfied yet asked Mrs Crayford

No Clara answered I am not satisfied yet

What still looking for him This is really too absurd Here is my
husband coming I shall tell him to call a cab and send you home

Clara drew back a few steps

I wont be in the way Lucy while you are taking leave of your good
husband she said I will wait here

Wait here What for

For something which I may yet see or for something which I may still
hear

Richard Wardour

Richard Wardour

Mrs Crayford turned to her husband without another word Claras
infatuation was beyond the reach of remonstrance

The boats of the _Wanderer_ took the place at the landingstage vacated
by the boats of the _Seamew_ A burst of cheering among the outer ranks
of the crowd announced the arrival of the commander of the expedition
on the scene Captain Helding appeared looking right and left for his
first lieutenant Finding Crayford with his wife the captain made his
apologies for interfering with his best grace

Give him up to his professional duties for one minute Mrs Crayford
and you shall have him back again for half an hour The Arctic
expedition is to blame my dear ladynot the captainfor parting man
and wife In Crayfords place I should have left it to the bachelors to
find the Northwest Passage and have stopped at home with you

Excusing himself in those bluntly complimentary terms Captain Helding
drew the lieutenant aside a few steps accidentally taking a direction
that led the two officers close to the place at which Clara was
standing Both the captain and the lieutenant were too completely
absorbed in their professional business to notice her Neither the one
nor the other had the faintest suspicion that she could and did hear
every word of the talk that passed between them

You received my note this morning the captain began

Certainly Captain Helding or I should have been on board the ship
before this

I am going on board myself at once the captain proceeded but I must
ask you to keep your boat waiting for half an hour more You will be all
the longer with your wife you know I thought of that Crayford

I am much obliged to you Captain Helding I suppose there is some
other reason for inverting the customary order of things and keeping
the lieutenant on shore after the captain is on board

Quite true there _is_ another reason I want you to wait for a
volunteer who has just joined us

A volunteer

Yes He has his outfit to get in a hurry and he may be half an hour
late

Its rather a sudden appointment isnt it

No doubt Very sudden

Andpardon meits rather a long time as we are situated to keep
the ships waiting for one man

Quite true again But a man who is worth having is worth waiting for
This man is worth having this man is worth his weight in gold to such
an expedition as ours Seasoned to all climates and all fatiguesa
strong fellow a brave fellow a clever fellowin short an excellent
officer I know him well or I should never have taken him The country
gets plenty of work out of my new volunteer Crayford He only returned
yesterday from foreign service

He only returned yesterday from foreign service And he volunteers this
morning to join the Arctic expedition You astonish me

I dare say I do You cant be more astonished than I was when he
presented himself at my hotel and told me what he wanted Why my good
fellow you have just got home I said Are you weary of your freedom
after only a few hours experience of it His answer rather startled
me He said I am weary of my life sir I have come home and found
a trouble to welcome me which goes near to break my heart If I dont
take refuge in absence and hard work I am a lost man Will you give me
a refuge Thats what he said Crayford word for word

Did you ask him to explain himself further

Not I I knew his value and I took the poor devil on the spot without
pestering him with any more questions No need to ask him to explain
himself The facts speak for themselves in these cases The old story
my good friend Theres a woman at the bottom of it of course


Mrs Crayford waiting for the return of her husband as patiently as she
could was startled by feeling a hand suddenly laid on her shoulder
She looked round and confronted Clara Her first feeling of surprise
changed instantly to alarm Clara was trembling from head to foot

What is the matter What has frightened you my dear

Lucy I _have_ heard of him

Richard Wardour again

Remember what I told you I have heard every word of the conversation
between Captain Helding and your husband A man came to the captain this
morning and volunteered to join the _Wanderer_ The captain has taken
him The man is Richard Wardour

You dont mean it Are you sure Did you hear Captain Helding mention
his name

No

Then how do you know its Richard Wardour

Dont ask me I am as certain of it as that I am standing here They
are going away together Lucyaway to the eternal ice and snow My
foreboding has come true The two will meetthe man who is to marry me
and the man whose heart I have broken

Your foreboding has _not_ come true Clara The men have not met
herethe men are not likely to meet elsewhere They are appointed
to separate ships Frank belongs to the _Seamew_ and Wardour to the
_Wanderer_ See Captain Helding has done My husband is coming this
way Let me make sure Let me speak to him

Lieutenant Crayford returned to his wife She spoke to him instantly

William you have got a new volunteer who joins the _Wanderer_

What you have been listening to the captain and me

I want to know his name

How in the world did you manage to hear what we said to each other

His name has the captain given you his name

Dont excite yourself my dear Look you are positively alarming Miss
Burnham The new volunteer is a perfect stranger to us There is his
namelast on the ships list

Mrs Crayford snatched the list out of her husbands hand and read the
name

RICHARD WARDOUR




Second SceneThe Hut of the _Seamew_



Chapter 6


Goodby to England Goodby to inhabited and civilized regions of the
earth

Two years have passed since the voyagers sailed from their native
shores The enterprise has failedthe Arctic expedition is lost and
icelocked in the Polar wastes The good ships _Wanderer_ and _Seamew_
entombed in ice will never ride the buoyant waters more Stripped of
their lighter timbers both vessels have been used for the construction
of huts erected on the nearest land

The largest of the two buildings which now shelter the lost men is
occupied by the surviving officers and crew of the _Seamew_ On one
side of the principal room are the sleeping berths and the fireplace
The other side discloses a broad doorway closed by a canvas screen
which serves as a means of communication with an inner apartment
devoted to the superior officers A hammock is slung to the rough
raftered roof of the main room as an extra bed A man completely
hidden by his bedclothes is sleeping in the hammock By the fireside
there is a second mansupposed to be on the watchfast asleep poor
wretch at the present moment Behind the sleeper stands an old cask
which serves for a table The objects at present on the table are a
pestle and mortar and a saucepanful of the dry bones of animalsin
plain words the dinner for the day By way of ornament to the dull
brown walls icicles appear in the crevices of the timber gleaming at
intervals in the red firelight No wind whistles outside the lonely
dwellingno cry of bird or beast is heard Indoors and outofdoors
the awful silence of the Polar desert reigns for the moment
undisturbed



Chapter 7


The first sound that broke the silence came from the inner apartment An
officer lifted the canvas screen in the hut of the _Seamew_ and entered
the main room Cold and privation had badly thinned the ranks The
commander of the shipCaptain Ebsworthwas dangerously ill The first
lieutenant was dead An officer of the _Wanderer_ filled their places
for the time with Captain Heldings permission The officer so employed
wasLieutenant Crayford

He approached the man at the fireside and awakened him

Jump up Bateson Its your turn to be relieved

The relief appeared rising from a heap of old sails at the back of the
hut Bateson vanished yawning to his bed Lieutenant Crayford walked
backward and forward briskly trying what exercise would do toward
warming his blood

The pestle and mortar on the cask attracted his attention He stopped
and looked up at the man in the hammock

I must rouse the cook he said to himself with a smile That fellow
little thinks how useful he is in keeping up my spirits The most
inveterate croaker and grumbler in the worldand yet according to his
own account the only cheerful man in the whole ships company John
Want John Want Rouse up there

A head rose slowly out of the bedclothes covered with a red nightcap
A melancholy nose rested itself on the edge of the hammock A voice
worthy of the nose expressed its opinion of the Arctic climate in
these words

Lord Lord heres all my breath on my blanket Icicles if you please
sir all round my mouth and all over my blanket Every time I have
snored Ive frozen something When a man gets the cold into him to that
extent that he ices his own bed it cant last much longer Never mind
_I_ dont grumble

Crayford tapped the saucepan of bones impatiently John Want lowered
himself to the floorgrumbling all the wayby a rope attached to the
rafters at his bed head Instead of approaching his superior officer
and his saucepan he hobbled shivering to the fireplace and held his
chin as close as he possibly could over the fire Crayford looked after
him

Halloo what are you doing there

Thawing my beard sir

Come here directly and set to work on these bones

John Want remained immovably attached to the fireplace holding
something else over the fire Crayford began to lose his temper

What the devil are you about now

Thawing my watch sir Its been under my pillow all night and the
cold has stopped it Cheerful wholesome bracing sort of climate to
live in isnt it sir Never mind _I_ dont grumble

No we all know that Look here Are these bones pounded small enough

John Want suddenly approached the lieutenant and looked at him with an
appearance of the deepest interest

Youll excuse me sir he said how very hollow your voice sounds
this morning

Never mind my voice The bones the bones

Yes sirthe bones Theyll take a trifle more pounding Ill do my
best with them sir for your sake

What do you mean

John Want shook his head and looked at Crayford with a dreary smile

I dont think I shall have the honor of making much more bone soup for
you sir Do you think yourself youll last long sir I dont saving
your presence I think about another week or ten days will do for us
all Never mind _I_ dont grumble

He poured the bones into the mortar and began to pound themunder
protest At the same moment a sailor appeared entering from the inner
hut

A message from Captain Ebsworth sir

Well

The captain is worse than ever with his freezing pains sir He wants
to see you immediately

I will go at once Rouse the doctor

Answering in those terms Crayford returned to the inner hut followed
by the sailor John Want shook his head again and smiled more drearily
than ever

Rouse the doctor he repeated Suppose the doctor should be frozen
He hadnt a haporth of warmth in him last night and his voice sounded
like a whisper in a speakingtrumpet Will the bones do now Yes the
bones will do now Into the saucepan with you cried John Want suiting
the action to the word and flavor the hot water if you can When I
remember that I was once an apprentice at a pastrycookswhen I think
of the gallons of turtlesoup that this hand has stirred up in a jolly
hot kitchenand when I find myself mixing bones and hot water for
soup and turning into ice as fast as I can if I wasnt of a cheerful
disposition I should feel inclined to grumble John Want John Want
whatever had you done with your natural senses when you made up your
mind to go to sea

A new voice hailed the cook speaking from one of the bedplaces in the
side of the hut It was the voice of Francis Aldersley

Whos that croaking over the fire

Croaking repeated John Want with the air of a man who considered
himself the object of a gratuitous insult Croaking You dont find
your own voice at all altered for the worsedo you Mr Frank I dont
give _him_ John proceeded speaking confidentially to himself more
than six hours to last Hes one of your grumblers

What are you doing there asked Frank

Im making bone soup sir and wondering why I ever went to sea

Well and why did you go to sea

Im not certain Mr Frank Sometimes I think it was natural
perversity sometimes I think it was false pride at getting over
seasickness sometimes I think it was reading Robinson Crusoe and
books warning of me _not_ to go to sea

Frank laughed Youre an odd fellow What do you mean by false pride
at getting over seasickness Did you get over seasickness in some new
way

John Wants dismal face brightened in spite of himself Frank had
recalled to the cooks memory one of the noteworthy passages in the
cooks life

Thats it sir he said If ever a man cured seasickness in a
new way yet I am that manI got over it Mr Frank by dint of hard
eating I was a passenger on board a packetboat sir when first I saw
blue water A nasty lopp of a sea came on at dinnertime and I began
to feel queer the moment the soup was put on the table Sick says
the captain Rather sir says I Will you try my cure says the
captain Certainly sir says I Is your heart in your mouth yet
says the captain Not quite sir says I Mockturtle soup says
the captain and helps me I swallow a couple of spoonfuls and turn as
white as a sheet The captain cocks his eye at me Go on deck sir
says he get rid of the soup and then come back to the cabin I got
rid of the soup and came back to the cabin Cods headandshoulders
says the captain and helps me I cant stand it sir says I You
must says the captain because its the cure I crammed down a
mouthful and turned paler than ever Go on deck says the captain
Get rid of the cods head and come back to the cabin Off I go and
back I come Boiled leg of mutton and trimmings says the captain and
helps me No fat sir says I Fats the cure says the captain and
makes me eat it Leans the cure says the captain and makes me eat
it Steady says the captain Sick says I Go on deck says the
captain get rid of the boiled leg of mutton and trimmings and come
back to the cabin Off I go staggeringback I come more dead than
alive Deviled kidneys says the captain I shut my eyes and got em
down Cures beginning says the captain Muttonchop and pickles
I shut my eyes and got _them_ down Broiled ham and cayenne pepper
says the captain Glass of stout and cranberry tart Want to go on deck
again No sir says I Cures done says the captain Never
you give in to your stomach and your stomach will end in giving in to
you

Having stated the moral purpose of his story in those unanswerable
words John Want took himself and his saucepan into the kitchen
A moment later Crayford returned to the hut and astonished Frank
Aldersley by an unexpected question

Have you anything in your berth Frank that you set a value on

Nothing that I set the smallest value onwhen I am out of it he
replied What does your question mean

We are almost as short of fuel as we are of provisions Crayford
proceeded Your berth will make good firing I have directed Bateson to
be here in ten minutes with his ax

Very attentive and considerate on your part said Frank What is
to become of me if you please when Bateson has chopped my bed into
firewood

Cant you guess

I suppose the cold has stupefied me The riddle is beyond my reading
Suppose you give me a hint

Certainly There will be beds to spare soonthere is to be a change at
last in our wretched lives here Do you see it now

Franks eyes sparkled He sprang out of his berth and waved his fur cap
in triumph

See it he exclaimed of course I do The exploring party is to start
at last Do I go with the expedition

It is not very long since you were in the doctors hands Frank said
Crayford kindly I doubt if you are strong enough yet to make one of
the exploring party

Strong enough or not returned Frank any risk is better than pining
and perishing here Put me down Crayford among those who volunteer to
go

Volunteers will not be accepted in this case said Crayford Captain
Helding and Captain Ebsworth see serious objections as we are situated
to that method of proceeding

Do they mean to keep the appointments in their own hands asked Frank
I for one object to that

Wait a little said Crayford You were playing backgammon the other
day with one of the officers Does the board belong to him or to you

It belongs to me I have got it in my locker here What do you want
with it

I want the dice and the box for casting lots The captains have
arrangedmost wisely as I thinkthat Chance shall decide among us who
goes with the expedition and who stays behind in the huts The officers
and crew of the _Wanderer_ will be here in a few minutes to cast the
lots Neither you nor any one can object to that way of deciding among
us Officers and men alike take their chance together Nobody can
grumble

I am quite satisfied said Frank But I know of one man among the
officers who is sure to make objections

Who is the man

You know him well enough too The Bear of the Expeditions Richard
Wardour

Frank Frank you have a bad habit of letting your tongue run away with
you Dont repeat that stupid nickname when you talk of my good friend
Richard Wardour

Your good friend Crayford your liking for that man amazes me

Crayford laid his hand kindly on Franks shoulder Of all the officers
of the _Seamew_ Crayfords favorite was Frank

Why should it amaze you he asked What opportunities have you had of
judging You and Wardour have always belonged to different ships I have
never seen you in Wardours society for five minutes together How can
_you_ form a fair estimate of his character

I take the general estimate of his character Frank answered He
has got his nickname because he is the most unpopular man in his ship
Nobody likes himthere must be some reason for that

There is only one reason for it Crayford rejoined Nobody
understands Richard Wardour I am not talking at random Remember
I sailed from England with him in the _Wanderer_ and I was only
transferred to the _Seamew_ long after we were locked up in the ice I
was Richard Wardours companion on board ship for months and I learned
there to do him justice Under all his outward defects I tell you
there beats a great and generous heart Suspend your opinion my lad
until you know my friend as well as I do No more of this now Give me
the dice and the box

Frank opened his locker At the same moment the silence of the
snowy waste outside was broken by a shouting of voices hailing the
hut_Seamew_ ahoy



Chapter 8


The sailor on watch opened the outer door There plodding over the
ghastly white snow were the officers of the _Wanderer_ approaching the
hut There scattered under the merciless black sky were the crew with
the dogs and the sledges waiting the word which was to start them on
their perilous and doubtful journey

Captain Helding of the _Wanderer_ accompanied by his officers entered
the hut in high spirits at the prospect of a change Behind them
lounging in slowly by himself was a dark sullen heavybrowed man He
neither spoke nor offered his hand to anybody he was the one person
present who seemed to be perfectly indifferent to the fate in store for
him This was the man whom his brother officers had nicknamed the Bear
of the Expedition In other wordsRichard Wardour

Crayford advanced to welcome Captain Helding Frank remembering the
friendly reproof which he had just received passed over the other
officers of the _Wanderer_ and made a special effort to be civil to
Crayfords friend

Goodmorning Mr Wardour he said We may congratulate each other on
the chance of leaving this horrible place

_You_ may think it horrible Wardour retorted I like it

Like it Good Heavens why

Because there are no women here

Frank turned to his brother officers without making any further
advances in the direction of Richard Wardour The Bear of the Expedition
was more unapproachable than ever

In the meantime the hut had become thronged by the ablebodied officers
and men of the two ships Captain Helding standing in the midst of
them with Crayford by his side proceeded to explain the purpose of the
contemplated expedition to the audience which surrounded him

He began in these words

Brother officers and men of the _Wanderer_ and _Seamew_ it is my
duty to tell you very briefly the reasons which have decided Captain
Ebsworth and myself on dispatching an exploring party in search of help
Without recalling all the hardships we have suffered for the last two
yearsthe destruction first of one of our ships then of the other
the death of some of our bravest and best companions the vain battles
we have been fighting with the ice and snow and boundless desolation of
these inhospitable regionswithout dwelling on these things it is
my duty to remind you that this the last place in which we have taken
refuge is far beyond the track of any previous expedition and that
consequently our chance of being discovered by any rescuing parties that
may be sent to look after us is to say the least of it a chance of the
most uncertain kind You all agree with me gentlemen so far

The officers with the exception of Wardour who stood apart in sullen
silence all agreed so far

The captain went on

It is therefore urgently necessary that we should make another and
probably a last effort to extricate ourselves The winter is not far
off game is getting scarcer and scarcer our stock of provisions is
running low and the sickespecially I am sorry to say the sick in
the _Wanderer_s hutare increasing in number day by day We must look
to our own lives and to the lives of those who are dependent on us and
we have no time to lose

The officers echoed the words cheerfully

Right right No time to lose

Captain Helding resumed

The plan proposed is that a detachment of the ablebodied officers and
men among us should set forth this very day and make another effort to
reach the nearest inhabited settlements from which help and provisions
may be dispatched to those who remain here The new direction to be
taken and the various precautions to be adopted are all drawn out
ready The only question now before us is Who is to stop here and who
is to undertake the journey

The officers answered the question with one accordVolunteers

The men echoed their officers Ay ay volunteers

Wardour still preserved his sullen silence Crayford noticed him
standing apart from the rest and appealed to him personally

Do you say nothing he asked

Nothing Wardour answered Go or stay its all one to me

I hope you dont really mean that said Crayford

I do

I am sorry to hear it Wardour

Captain Helding answered the general suggestion in favor of volunteering
by a question which instantly checked the rising enthusiasm of the
meeting

Well he said suppose we say volunteers Who volunteers to stop in
the huts

There was a dead silence The officers and men looked at each other
confusedly The captain continued

You see we cant settle it by volunteering You all want to go Every
man among us who has the use of his limbs naturally wants to go But
what is to become of those who have not got the use of their limbs Some
of us must stay here and take care of the sick

Everybody admitted that this was true

So we get back again said the captain to the old questionWho
among the ablebodied is to go and who is to stay Captain Ebsworth
says and I say let chance decide it Here are dice The numbers run
as high as twelvedouble sixes All who throw under six stay all who
throw over six go Officers of the _Wanderer_ and the _Seamew_ do you
agree to that way of meeting the difficulty

All the officers agreed with the one exception of Wardour who still
kept silence

Men of the _Wanderer_ and _Seamew_ your officers agree to cast lots
Do you agree too

The men agreed without a dissentient voice Crayford handed the box and
the dice to Captain Helding

You throw first sir Under six Stay Over six Go

Captain Helding cast the dice the top of the cask serving for a table
He threw seven

Go said Crayford I congratulate you sir Now for my own chance
He cast the dice in his turn Three Stay Ah well well if I can do
my duty and be of use to others what does it matter whether I go or
stay Wardour you are next in the absence of your first lieutenant

Wardour prepared to cast without shaking the dice

Shake the box man cried Crayford Give yourself a chance of luck

Wardour persisted in letting the dice fall out carelessly just as they
lay in the box

Not I he muttered to himself Ive done with luck Saying those
words he threw down the empty box and seated himself on the nearest
chest without looking to see how the dice had fallen

Crayford examined them Six he exclaimed There you have a second
chance in spite of yourself You are neither under nor overyou throw
again

Bah growled the Bear Its not worth the trouble of getting up for
Somebody else throw for me He suddenly looked at Frank You you have
got what the women call a lucky face

Frank appealed to Crayford Shall I

Yes if he wishes it said Crayford

Frank cast the dice Two He stays Wardour I am sorry I have thrown
against you

Go or stay reiterated Wardour its all one to me You will be
luckier young one when you cast for yourself

Frank cast for himself

Eight Hurrah I go

What did I tell you said Wardour The chance was yours You have
thriven on my ill luck

He rose as he spoke to leave the hut Crayford stopped him

Have you anything particular to do Richard

What has anybody to do here

Wait a little then I want to speak to you when this business is
over

Are you going to give me any more good advice

Dont look at me in that sour way Richard I am going to ask you a
question about something which concerns yourself

Wardour yielded without a word more He returned to his chest and
cynically composed himself to slumber The casting of the lots went
on rapidly among the officers and men In another halfhour chance had
decided the question of Go or Stay for all alike The men left the
hut The officers entered the inner apartment for a last conference with
the bedridden captain of the _Seamew_ Wardour and Crayford were left
together alone



Chapter 9


Crayford touched his friend on the shoulder to rouse him Wardour looked
up impatiently with a frown

I was just asleep he said Why do you wake me

Look round you Richard We are alone

Welland what of that

I wish to speak to you privately and this is my opportunity You have
disappointed and surprised me today Why did you say it was all one to
you whether you went or stayed Why are you the only man among us who
seems to be perfectly indifferent whether we are rescued or not

Can a man always give a reason for what is strange in his manner or his
words Wardour retorted

He can try said Crayford quietlywhen his friend asks him

Wardours manner softened

Thats true he said I _will_ try Do you remember the first night
at sea when we sailed from England in the _Wanderer_

As well as if it was yesterday

A calm still night the other went on thoughtfully No clouds no
stars Nothing in the sky but the broad moon and hardly a ripple to
break the path of light she made in the quiet water Mine was the middle
watch that night You came on deck and found me alone

He stopped Crayford took his hand and finished the sentence for him

Aloneand in tears

The last I shall ever shed Wardour added bitterly

Dont say that There are times when a man is to be pitied indeed if
he can shed no tears Go on Richard

Wardour proceededstill following the old recollections still
preserving his gentler tones

I should have quarreled with any other man who had surprised me at that
moment he said There was something I suppose in your voice when
you asked my pardon for disturbing me that softened my heart I told
you I had met with a disappointment which had broken me for life There
was no need to explain further The only hopeless wretchedness in this
world is the wretchedness that women cause

And the only unalloyed happiness said Crayford the happiness that
women bring

That may be your experience of them Wardour answered mine is
different All the devotion the patience the humility the worship
that there is in man I laid at the feet of a woman She accepted
the offering as women doaccepted it easily gracefully
unfeelinglyaccepted it as a matter of course I left England to win
a high place in my profession before I dared to win _her_ I braved
danger and faced death I staked my life in the fever swamps of Africa
to gain the promotion that I only desired for her sakeand gained it I
came back to give her all and to ask nothing in return but to rest my
weary heart in the sunshine of her smile And her own lipsthe lips I
had kissed at partingtold me that another man had robbed me of her I
spoke but few words when I heard that confession and left her forever
The time may come I told her when I shall forgive _you_ But the
man who has robbed me of you shall rue the day when you and he first
met Dont ask me who he was I have yet to discover him The treachery
had been kept secret nobody could tell me where to find him nobody
could tell me who he was What did it matter When I had lived out the
first agony I could rely on myselfI could be patient and bide my
time

Your time What time

The time when I and that man shall meet face to face I knew it then I
know it nowit was written on my heart then it is written on my heart
nowwe two shall meet and know each other With that conviction strong
within me I volunteered for this service as I would have volunteered
for anything that set work and hardship and danger like ramparts
between my misery and me With that conviction strong within me still I
tell you it is no matter whether I stay here with the sick or go hence
with the strong I shall live till I have met that man There is a day
of reckoning appointed between us Here in the freezing cold or away in
the deadly heat in battle or in shipwreck in the face of starvation
under the shadow of pestilenceI though hundreds are falling round me
I shall live live for the coming of one day live for the meeting with
one man

He stopped trembling body and soul under the hold that his own
terrible superstition had fastened on him Crayford drew back in silent
horror Wardour noticed the actionhe resented ithe appealed in
defense of his one cherished conviction to Crayfords own experience of
him

Look at me he cried Look how I have lived and thriven with
the heartache gnawing at me at home and the winds of the icy north
whistling round me here I am the strongest man among you Why I have
fought through hardships that have laid the bestseasoned men of all our
party on their backs Why What have _I_ done that my life should throb
as bravely through every vein in my body at this minute and in this
deadly place as ever it did in the wholesome breezes of home What am
I preserved for I tell you again for the coming of one dayfor the
meeting with one man

He paused once more This time Crayford spoke

Richard he said since we first met I have believed in your better
nature against all outward appearance I have believed in you firmly
truly as your brother might You are putting that belief to a hard
test If your enemy had told me that you had ever talked as you talk
now that you had ever looked as you look now I would have turned my
back on him as the utterer of a vile calumny against a just a brave an
upright man Oh my friend my friend if ever I have deserved well of
you put away these thoughts from your heart Face me again with the
stainless look of a man who has trampled under his feet the bloody
superstitions of revenge and knows them no more Never never let the
time come when I cannot offer you my hand as I offer it now to the man
I can still admireto the brother I can still love

The heart that no other voice could touch felt that appeal The fierce
eyes the hard voice softened under Crayfords influence Richard
Wardours head sank on his breast

You are kinder to me than I deserve he said Be kinder still and
forget what I have been talking about No no more about me I am not
worth it Well change the subject and never go back to it again Lets
do something Work Crayfordthats the true elixir of our life Work
that stretches the muscles and sets the blood aglowing Work that
tires the body and rests the mind Is there nothing in hand that I can
do Nothing to cut nothing to carry

The door opened as he put the question Batesonappointed to chop
Franks bedplace into firingappeared punctually with his ax Wardour
without a word of warning snatched the ax out of the mans hand

What was this wanted for he asked

To cut up Mr Aldersleys berth there into firing sir

Ill do it for you Ill have it down in no time He turned to
Crayford You neednt be afraid about me old friend I am going to do
the right thing I am going to tire my body and rest my mind

The evil spirit in him was plainly subduedfor the time at least
Crayford took his hand in silence and then followed by Bateson left
him to his work



Chapter 10


Ax in hand Wardour approached Franks bedplace

If I could only cut the thoughts out of me he said to himself as I
am going to cut the billets out of this wood He attacked the bedplace
with the ax like a man who well knew the use of his instrument Oh
me he thought sadly if I had only been born a carpenter instead
of a gentleman A good ax Master BatesonI wonder where you got it
Something like a grip my man on this handle Poor Crayford his words
stick in my throat A fine fellow a noble fellow No use thinking no
use regretting what is said is said Work work work

Plank after plank fell out on the floor He laughed over the easy task
of destruction Aha young Aldersley It doesnt take much to demolish
your bedplace Ill have it down I would have the whole hut down if
they would only give me the chance of chopping at it

A long strip of wood fell to his axlong enough to require cutting
in two He turned it and stooped over it Something caught his
eyeletters carved in the wood He looked closer The letters were very
faintly and badly cut He could only make out the first three of them
and even of those he was not quite certain They looked like C L Aif
they looked like anything He threw down the strip of wood irritably

Dn the fellow whoever he is who cut this Why should he carve
_that_ name of all the names in the world

He paused consideringthen determined to go on again with his
selfimposed labor He was ashamed of his own outburst He looked
eagerly for the ax Work work Nothing for it but work He found the
ax and went on again

He cut out another plank

He stopped and looked at it suspiciously

There was carving again on this plank The letters F and A appeared
on it

He put down the ax There were vague misgivings in him which he was not
able to realize The state of his own mind was fast becoming a puzzle to
him

More carving he said to himself Thats the way these young idlers
employ their long hours F A Those must be _his_ initialsFrank
Aldersley Who carved the letters on the other plank Frank Aldersley
too

He turned the piece of wood in his hand nearer to the light and looked
lower down it More carving again lower down Under the initials F A
were two more lettersC B

C B he repeated to himself His sweet hearts initials I suppose
Of courseat his agehis sweethearts initials

He paused once more A spasm of inner pain showed the shadow of its
mysterious passage outwardly on his face

_Her_ cipher is C B he said in low broken tones C BClara
Burnham

He waited with the plank in his hand repeating the name over and over
again as if it was a question he was putting to himself

Clara Burnham Clara Burnham

He dropped the plank and turned deadly pale in a moment His eyes
wandered furtively backward and forward between the strip of wood on the
floor and the halfdemolished berth Oh God what has come to me now
he said to himself in a whisper He snatched up the ax with a strange
crysomething between rage and terror He triedfiercely desperately
triedto go on with his work No strong as he was he could not use
the ax His hands were helpless they trembled incessantly He went to
the fire he held his hands over it They still trembled incessantly
they infected the rest of him He shuddered all over He knew fear His
own thoughts terrified him

Crayford he cried out Crayford come here and lets go hunting

No friendly voice answered him No friendly face showed itself at the
door

An interval passed and there came over him another change He recovered
his selfpossession almost as suddenly as he had lost it A smilea
horrid deforming unnatural smilespread slowly stealthily
devilishly over his face He left the fire he put the ax away softly in
a corner he sat down in his old place deliberately selfabandoned to a
frenzy of vindictive joy He had found the man There at the end of
the worldthere at the last fight of the Arctic voyagers against
starvation and death he had found the man

The minutes passed

He became conscious on a sudden of a freezing stream of air pouring
into the room

He turned and saw Crayford opening the door of the hut A man was
behind him Wardour rose eagerly and looked over Crayfords shoulder

Was itcould it bethe man who had carved the letters on the plank
Yes Frank Aldersley



Chapter 11


Still at work Crayford exclaimed looking at the halfdemolished
bedplace Give yourself a little rest Richard The exploring party
is ready to start If you wish to take leave of your brother officers
before they go you have no time to lose

He checked himself there looking Wardour full in the face

Good Heavens he cried how pale you are Has anything happened

Franksearching in his locker for articles of clothing which he might
require on the journeylooked round He was startled as Crayford had
been startled by the sudden change in Wardour since they had last seen
him

Are you ill he asked I hear you have been doing Batesons work for
him Have you hurt yourself

Wardour suddenly moved his head so as to hide his face from both
Crayford and Frank He took out his handkerchief and wound it clumsily
round his left hand

Yes he said I hurt myself with the ax Its nothing Never mind
Pain always has a curious effect on me I tell you its nothing Dont
notice it

He turned his face toward them again as suddenly as he had turned it
away He advanced a few steps and addressed himself with an uneasy
familiarity to Frank

I didnt answer you civilly when you spoke to me some little time
since I mean when I first came in here along with the rest of them I
apologize Shake hands How are you Ready for the march

Frank met the oddly abrupt advance which had been made to him with
perfect good humor

I am glad to be friends with you Mr Wardour I wish I was as well
seasoned to fatigue as you are

Wardour burst into a hard joyless unnatural laugh

Not strong eh You dont look it The dice had better have sent me
away and kept you here I never felt in better condition in my life
He paused and added with his eye on Frank and with a strong emphasis on
the words We men of Kent are made of tough material

Frank advanced a step on his side with a new interest in Richard
Wardour

You come from Kent he said

Yes From East Kent He waited a little once more and looked hard at
Frank Do you know that part of the country he asked

I ought to know something about East Kent Frank answered Some dear
friends of mine once lived there

Friends of yours Wardour repeated One of the county families I
suppose

As he put the question he abruptly looked over his shoulder He was
standing between Crayford and Frank Crayford taking no part in the
conversation had been watching him and listening to him more and more
attentively as that conversation went on Within the last moment or
two Wardour had become instinctively conscious of this He resented
Crayfords conduct with needless irritability

Why are you staring at me he asked

Why are you looking unlike yourself Crayford answered quietly

Wardour made no reply He renewed the conversation with Frank

One of the county families he resumed The Winterbys of Yew Grange
I dare say

No said Frank but friends of the Witherbys very likely The
Burnhams

Desperately as he struggled to maintain it Wardours selfcontrol
failed him He started violently The clumsilywound handkerchief fell
off his hand Still looking at him attentively Crayford picked it up

There is your handkerchief Richard he said Strange

What is strange

You told us you had hurt yourself with the ax

Well

There is no blood on your handkerchief

Wardour snatched the handkerchief out of Crayfords hand and
turning away approached the outer door of the hut No blood on the
handkerchief he said to himself There may be a stain or two when
Crayford sees it again He stopped within a few paces of the door
and spoke to Crayford You recommended me to take leave of my brother
officers before it was too late he said I am going to follow your
advice

The door was opened from the outer side as he laid his hand on the lock

One of the quartermasters of the _Wanderer_ entered the hut

Is Captain Helding here sir he asked addressing himself to Wardour

Wardour pointed to Crayford

The lieutenant will tell you he said

Crayford advanced and questioned the quartermaster What do you want
with Captain Helding he asked

I have a report to make sir There has been an accident on the ice

To one of your men

No sir To one of our officers

Wardour on the point of going out paused when the quartermaster made
that reply For a moment he considered with himself Then he walked
slowly back to the part of the room in which Frank was standing
Crayford directing the quartermaster pointed to the arched door way in
the side of the hut

I am sorry to hear of the accident he said You will find Captain
Helding in that room

For the second time with singular persistency Wardour renewed the
conversation with Frank

So you knew the Burnhams he said What became of Clara when her
father died

Franks face flushed angrily on the instant

Clara he repeated What authorizes you to speak of Miss Burnham in
that familiar manner

Wardour seized the opportunity of quarreling with him

What right have you to ask he retorted coarsely

Franks blood was up He forgot his promise to Clara to keep their
engagement secrethe forgot everything but the unbridled insolence of
Wardours language and manner

A right which I insist on your respecting he answered The right of
being engaged to marry her

Crayfords steady eyes were still on the watch and Wardour felt them
on him A little more and Crayford might openly interfere Even Wardour
recognized for once the necessity of controlling his temper cost him
what it might He made his apologies with overstrained politeness to
Frank

Impossible to dispute such a right as yours he said Perhaps
you will excuse me when you know that I am one of Miss Burnhams old
friends My father and her father were neighbors We have always met
like brother and sister

Frank generously stopped the apology there

Say no more he interposed I was in the wrongI lost my temper
Pray forgive me

Wardour looked at him with a strange reluctant interest while he was
speaking Wardour asked an extraordinary question when he had done

Is she very fond of you

Frank burst out laughing

My dear fellow he said come to our wedding and judge for
yourself

Come to your wedding As he repeated the words Wardour stole one
glance at Frank which Frank employed in buckling his knapsack failed
to see Crayford noticed it and Crayfords blood ran cold Comparing
the words which Wardour had spoken to him while they were alone together
with the words that had just passed in his presence he could draw but
one conclusion The woman whom Wardour had loved and lost wasClara
Burnham The man who had robbed him of her was Frank Aldersley And
Wardour had discovered it in the interval since they had last met
Thank God thought Crayford the dice have parted them Frank goes
with the expedition and Wardour stays behind with me

The reflection had barely occurred to himFranks thoughtless
invitation to Wardour had just passed his lipswhen the canvas screen
over the doorway was drawn aside Captain Helding and the officers who
were to leave with the exploring party returned to the main room on
their way out Seeing Crayford Captain Helding stopped to speak to him

I have a casualty to report said the captain which diminishes
our numbers by one My second lieutenant who was to have joined
the exploring party has had a fall on the ice Judging by what the
quartermaster tells me I am afraid the poor fellow has broken his leg

I will supply his place cried a voice at the other end of the hut

Everybody looked round The man who had spoken was Richard Wardour

Crayford instantly interferedso vehemently as to astonish all who knew
him

No he said Not you Richard not you

Why not Wardour asked sternly

Why not indeed added Captain Helding Wardour is the very man to be
useful on a long march He is in perfect health and he is the best shot
among us I was on the point of proposing him myself

Crayford failed to show his customary respect for his superior officer
He openly disputed the captains conclusion

Wardour has no right to volunteer he rejoined It has been settled
Captain Helding that chance shall decide who is to go and who is to
stay

And chance _has_ decided it cried Wardour Do you think we are going
to cast the dice again and give an officer of the _Seamew_ a chance of
replacing an officer of the _Wanderer_ There is a vacancy in our party
not in yours and we claim the right of filling it as we please I
volunteer and my captain backs me Whose authority is to keep me here
after that

Gently Wardour said Captain Helding A man who is in the right can
afford to speak with moderation He turned to Crayford You must admit
yourself he continued that Wardour is right this time The missing
man belongs to my command and in common justice one of my officers
ought to supply his place

It was impossible to dispute the matter further The dullest man present
could see that the captains reply was unanswerable In sheer despair
Crayford took Franks arm and led him aside a few steps The last chance
left of parting the two men was the chance of appealing to Frank

My dear boy he began I want to say one friendly word to you on the
subject of your health I have already if you remember expressed my
doubts whether you are strong enough to make one of an exploring party
I feel those doubts more strongly than ever at this moment Will you
take the advice of a friend who wishes you well

Wardour had followed Crayford Wardour roughly interposed before Frank
could reply

Let him alone

Crayford paid no heed to the interruption He was too earnestly bent on
withdrawing Frank from the expedition to notice anything that was said
or done by the persons about him

Dont pray dont risk hardships which you are unfit to bear he went
on entreatingly Your place can be easily filled Change your mind
Frank Stay here with me

Again Wardour interfered Again he called out Leave him alone more
roughly than ever Still deaf and blind to every consideration but one
Crayford pressed his entreaties on Frank

You owned yourself just now that you were not well seasoned to
fatigue he persisted You feel you _must_ feel how weak that last
illness has left you You know I am sure you know how unfit you are to
brave exposure to cold and long marches over the snow

Irritated beyond endurance by Crayfords obstinacy seeing or thinking
he saw signs of yielding in Franks face Wardour so far forgot himself
as to seize Crayford by the arm and attempt to drag him away from Frank
Crayford turned and looked at him

Richard he said very quietly you are not yourself I pity you
Drop your hand

Wardour relaxed his hold with something of the sullen submission of
a wild animal to its keeper The momentary silence which followed gave
Frank an opportunity of speaking at last

I am gratefully sensible Crayford he began of the interest which
you take in me

And you will follow my advice Crayford interposed eagerly

My mind is made up old friend Frank answered firmly and sadly
Forgive me for disappointing you I am appointed to the expedition
With the expedition I go He moved nearer to Wardour In his innocence
of all suspicion he clapped Wardour heartily on the shoulder When
I feel the fatigue said poor simple Frank you will help me
comradewont you Come along

Wardour snatched his gun out of the hands of the sailor who was carrying
it for him His dark face became suddenly irradiated with a terrible
joy

Come he cried Over the snow and over the ice Come where no human
footsteps have ever trodden and where no human trace is ever left

Blindly instinctively Crayford made an effort to part them His
brother officers standing near pulled him back They looked at each
other anxiously The merciless cold striking its victims in various
ways had struck in some instances at their reason first Everybody
loved Crayford Was he too going on the dark way that others had
taken before him They forced him to seat himself on one of the lockers
Steady old fellow they said kindlysteady Crayford yielded
writhing inwardly under the sense of his own helplessness What in Gods
name could he do Could he denounce Wardour to Captain Helding on bare
suspicionwithout so much as the shadow of a proof to justify what he
said The captain would decline to insult one of his officers by even
mentioning the monstrous accusation to him The captain would conclude
as others had already concluded that Crayfords mind was giving way
under stress of cold and privation No hopeliterally no hope now
but in the numbers of the expedition Officers and men they all liked
Frank As long as they could stir hand or foot they would help him on
the waythey would see that no harm came to him

The word of command was given the door was thrown open the hut emptied
rapidly Over the merciless white snowunder the merciless black
skythe exploring party began to move The sick and helpless men
whose last hope of rescue centered in their departing messmates cheered
faintly Some few whose days were numbered sobbed and cried like women
Franks voice faltered as he turned back at the door to say his last
words to the friend who had been a father to him

God bless you Crayford

Crayford broke away from the officers near him and hurrying forward
seized Frank by both hands Crayford held him as if he would never let
him go

God preserve you Frank I would give all I have in the world to be
with you Goodby Goodby

Frank waved his handdashed away the tears that were gathering in his
eyesand hurried out Crayford called after him the last the only
warning that he could give

While you can stand keep with the main body Frank

Wardour waiting till the lastWardour following Frank through the
snowdriftstopped stepped back and answered Crayford at the door

While he can stand he keeps with Me




Third SceneThe Iceberg



Chapter 12


Alone alone on the Frozen Deep

The Arctic sun is rising dimly in the dreary sky The beams of the cold
northern moon mingling strangely with the dawning light clothe the
snowy plains in hues of livid gray An icefield on the far horizon is
moving slowly southward in the spectral light Nearer a stream of
open water rolls its slow black waves past the edges of the ice Nearer
still following the drift an iceberg rears its crags and pinnacles
to the sky here glittering in the moonbeams there looming dim and
ghostlike in the ashy light

Midway on the long sweep of the lower slope of the iceberg what objects
rise and break the desolate monotony of the scene In this awful
solitude can signs appear which tell of human Life Yes The black
outline of a boat just shows itself hauled up on the berg In an
icecavern behind the boat the last red embers of a dying fire flicker
from time to time over the figures of two men One is seated resting
his back against the side of the cavern The other lies prostrate with
his head on his comrades knee The first of these men is awake and
thinking The second reclines with his still white face turned up to
the skysleeping or dead Days and days since these two have fallen
behind on the march of the expedition of relief Days and days since
these two have been given up by their weary and failing companions as
doomed and lost He who sits thinking is Richard Wardour He who lies
sleeping or dead is Frank Aldersley

The iceberg drifts slowly over the black water through the ashy light
Minute by minute the dying fire sinks Minute by minute the deathly cold
creeps nearer and nearer to the lost men

Richard Wardour rouses himself from his thoughtslooks at the still
white face beneath himand places his hand on Franks heart It still
beats feebly Give him his share of the food and fuel still stored in
the boat and Frank may live through it Leave him neglected where he
lies and his death is a question of hoursperhaps minutes who knows

Richard Wardour lifts the sleepers head and rests it against the cavern
side He goes to the boat and returns with a billet of wood He
stoops to place the wood on the fireand stops Frank is dreaming
and murmuring in his dream A womans name passes his lips Frank is in
England againat the ballwhispering to Clara the confession of his
love

Over Richard Wardours face there passes the shadow of a deadly thought
He rises from the fire he takes the wood back to the boat His iron
strength is shaken but it still holds out They are drifting nearer and
nearer to the open sea He can launch the boat without help he can take
the food and the fuel with him The sleeper on the iceberg is the man
who has robbed him of Clarawho has wrecked the hope and the happiness
of his life Leave the man in his sleep and let him die

So the tempter whispers Richard Wardour tries his strength on the boat
It moves he has got it under control He stops and looks round Beyond
him is the open sea Beneath him is the man who has robbed him of Clara
The shadow of the deadly thought grows and darkens over his face He
waits with his hands on the boatwaits and thinks

The iceberg drifts slowlyover the black water through the ashy light
Minute by minute the dying fire sinks Minute by minute the deathly
cold creeps nearer to the sleeping man And still Richard Wardour
waitswaits and thinks




Fourth SceneThe Garden



Chapter 13


The spring has come The air of the April night just lifts the leaves
of the sleeping flowers The moon is queen in the cloudless and starless
sky The stillness of the midnight hour is abroad over land and over
sea

In a villa on the westward shore of the Isle of Wight the glass doors
which lead from the drawingroom to the garden are yet open The shaded
lamp yet burns on the table A lady sits by the lamp reading From time
to time she looks out into the garden and sees the whiterobed figure
of a young girl pacing slowly to and fro in the soft brightness of the
moonlight on the lawn Sorrow and suspense have set their mark on the
lady Not rivals only but friends who formerly admired her agree
now that she looks worn and aged The more merciful judgment of others
remarks with equal truth that her eyes her hair her simple grace
and grandeur of movement have lost but little of their olden charms The
truth lies as usual between the two extremes In spite of sorrow and
suffering Mrs Crayford is the beautiful Mrs Crayford still

The delicious silence of the hour is softly disturbed by the voice of
the younger lady in the garden

Go to the piano Lucy It is a night for music Play something that is
worthy of the night

Mrs Crayford looks round at the clock on the mantelpiece

My dear Clara it is past twelve Remember what the doctor told you
You ought to have been in bed an hour ago

Half an hour Lucygive me half an hour more Look at the moonlight
on the sea Is it possible to go to bed on such a night as this Play
something Lucysomething spiritual and divine

Earnestly pleading with her friend Clara advances toward the window
She too has suffered under the wasting influences of suspense Her face
has lost its youthful freshness no delicate flush of color rises on
it when she speaks The soft gray eyes which won Franks heart in the
bygone time are sadly altered now In repose they have a dimmed and
wearied look In action they are wild and restless like eyes suddenly
wakened from startling dreams Robed in whiteher soft brown hair
hanging loosely over her shouldersthere is something weird and
ghostlike in the girl as she moves nearer and nearer to the window in
the full light of the moonpleading for music that shall be worthy of
the mystery and the beauty of the night

Will you come in here if I play to you Mrs Crayford asks It is a
risk my love to be out so long in the night air

No no I like it Playwhile I am out here looking at the sea It
quiets me it comforts me it does me good

She glides back ghostlike over the lawn Mrs Crayford rises and
puts down the volume that she has been reading It is a record of
explorations in the Arctic seas The time has gone by when the two
lonely women could take an interest in subjects not connected with their
own anxieties Now when hope is fast failing themnow when their last
news of the _Wanderer_ and the _Seamew_ is news that is more than two
years oldthey can read of nothing they can think of nothing but
dangers and discoveries losses and rescues in the terrible Polar seas

Unwillingly Mrs Crayford puts her book aside and opens the
pianoMozarts Air in A with Variations lies open on the
instrument One after another she plays the lovely melodies so simply
so purely beautiful of that unpretending and unrivaled work At the
close of the ninth Variation Claras favorite she pauses and turns
toward the garden

Shall I stop there she asks

There is no answer Has Clara wandered away out of hearing of the music
that she lovesthe music that harmonizes so subtly with the tender
beauty of the night Mrs Crayford rises and advances to the window

No there is the white figure standing alone on the slope of the
lawnthe head turned away from the house the face looking out over
the calm sea whose gently rippling waters end in the dim line on the
horizon which is the line of the Hampshire coast

Mrs Crayford advances as far as the path before the window and calls
to her

Clara

Again there is no answer The white figure still stands immovably in its
place

With signs of distress in her face but with no appearance of alarm
Mrs Crayford returns to the room Her own sad experience tells her what
has happened She summons the servants and directs them to wait in the
drawingroom until she calls to them This done she returns to the
garden and approaches the mysterious figure on the lawn

Dead to the outer world as if she lay already in her graveinsensible
to touch insensible to sound motionless as stone cold as stoneClara
stands on the moonlit lawn facing the seaward view Mrs Crayford waits
at her side patiently watching for the change which she knows is to
come Catalepsy as some call ithysteria as others saythis
alone is certain the same interval always passes the same change
always appears

It comes now Not a change in her eyes they still remain wide open
fixed and glassy The first movement is a movement of her hands They
rise slowly from her side and waver in the air like the hands of a
person groping in the dark Another interval and the movement spreads
to her lips they part and tremble A few minutes more and words begin
to drop one by one from those parted lipswords spoken in a lost
vacant tone as if she is talking in her sleep

Mrs Crayford looks back at the house Sad experience makes her
suspicious of the servants curiosity Sad experience has long since
warned her that the servants are not to be trusted within hearing of
the wild words which Clara speaks in the trance Has any one of them
ventured into the garden No They are out of hearing at the window
waiting for the signal which tells them that their help is needed

Turning toward Clara once more Mrs Crayford hears the vacantly uttered
words falling faster and faster from her lips

Frank Frank Frank Dont drop behinddont trust Richard Wardour
While you can stand keep with the other men Frank

The farewell warning of Crayford in the solitudes of the Frozen Deep
repeated by Clara in the garden of her English home

A moment of silence follows and in that moment the vision has
changed She sees him on the iceberg now at the mercy of the bitterest
enemy he has on earth She sees him driftingover the black water
through the ashy light

Wake Frank wake and defend yourself Richard Wardour knows that
I love youRichard Wardours vengeance will take your life Wake
Frankwake You are drifting to your death A low groan of horror
bursts from her sinister and terrible to hear Drifting drifting
she whispers to herselfdrifting to his death

Her glassy eyes suddenly softenthen close A long shudder runs through
her A faint flush shows itself on the deadly pallor of her face and
fades again Her limbs fail her She sinks into Mrs Crayfords arms

The servants answering the call for help carry her into the house
They lay her insensible on her bed After half an hour or more her eyes
open againthis time with the light of life in themopen and rest
languidly on the friend sitting by the bedside

I have had a dreadful dream she murmurs faintly Am I ill Lucy I
feel so weak

Even as she says the words sleep gentle natural sleep takes her
suddenly as it takes young children weary with their play Though it
is all over now though no further watching is required Mrs Crayford
still keeps her place by the bedside too anxious and too wakeful to
retire to her own room

On other occasions she is accustomed to dismiss from her mind the words
which drop from Clara in the trance This time the effort to dismiss
them is beyond her power The words haunt her Vainly she recalls to
memory all that the doctors have said to her in speaking of Clara in
the state of trance What she vaguely dreads for the lost man whom she
loves is mingled in her mind with what she is constantly reading of
trials dangers and escapes in the Arctic seas The most startling
things that she may say or do are all attributable to this cause and
may all be explained in this way So the doctors have spoken and thus
far Mrs Crayford has shared their view It is only tonight that the
girls words ring in her ear with a strange prophetic sound in them
It is only tonight that she asks herself Is Clara present in the
spirit with our loved and lost ones in the lonely North Can mortal
vision see the dead and living in the solitudes of the Frozen Deep



Chapter 14


The night had passed

Far and near the garden view looked its gayest and brightest in the
light of the noonday sun The cheering sounds which tell of life and
action were audible all round the villa From the garden of the nearest
house rose the voices of children at play Along the road at the back
sounded the roll of wheels as carts and carriages passed at intervals
Out on the blue sea the distant splash of the paddles the distant
thump of the engines told from time to time of the passage of steamers
entering or leaving the strait between the island and the mainland In
the trees the birds sang gayly among the rustling leaves In the house
the womenservants were laughing over some jest or story that cheered
them at their work It was a lively and pleasant timea bright
enjoyable day

The two ladies were out together resting on a garden seat after a walk
round the grounds

They exchanged a few trivial words relating to the beauty of the day
and then said no more Possessing the same consciousness of what she had
seen in the trance which persons in general possess of what they
have seen in a dreambelieving in the vision as a supernatural
revelationClaras worst forebodings were now to her mind realized
as truths Her last faint hope of ever seeing Frank again was now at an
end Intimate experience of her told Mrs Crayford what was passing in
Claras mind and warned her that the attempt to reason and remonstrate
would be little better than a voluntary waste of words and time The
disposition which she had herself felt on the previous night to attach
a superstitious importance to the words that Clara had spoken in the
trance had vanished with the return of the morning Rest and reflection
had quieted her mind and had restored the composing influence of
her sober sense Sympathizing with Clara in all besides she had no
sympathy as they sat together in the pleasant sunshine with Claras
gloomy despair of the future She who could still hope had nothing to
say to the sad companion who had done with hope So the quiet minutes
succeeded each other and the two friends sat side by side in silence

An hour passed and the gatebell of the villa rang

They both startedthey both knew the ring It was the hour when
the postman brought their newspapers from London In past days what
hundreds on hundreds of times they had torn off the cover which inclosed
the newspaper and looked at the same column with the same weary
mingling of hope and despair There todayas it was yesterday as it
would be if they lived tomorrowthere was the servant with Lucys
newspaper and Claras newspaper in his hand

Would both of them do again today what both had done so often in the
days that were gone

No Mrs Crayford removed the cover from her newspaper as usual Clara
laid _her_ newspaper aside unopened on the garden seat

In silence Mrs Crayford looked where she always looked at the column
devoted to the Latest Intelligence from foreign parts The instant her
eye fell on the page she started with a loud cry of joy The newspaper
fell from her trembling hand She caught Clara in her arms Oh my
darling my darling news of them at last

Without answering without the slightest change in look or manner Clara
took the newspaper from the ground and read the top line in the column
printed in capital letters

THE ARCTIC EXPEDITION

She waited and looked at Mrs Crayford

Can you bear to hear it Lucy she asked if I read it aloud

Mrs Crayford was too agitated to answer in words She signed
impatiently to Clara to go on

Clara read the news which followed the heading in capital letters Thus
it ran

The following intelligence from St Johns Newfoundland has reached
us for publication The whalingvessel _Blythewood_ is reported to
have met with the surviving officers and men of the Expedition in Davis
Strait Many are stated to be dead and some are supposed to be missing
The list of the saved as collected by the people of the whaler is not
vouched for as being absolutely correct the circumstances having been
adverse to investigation The vessel was pressed for time and the
members of the Expedition all more or less suffering from exhaustion
were not in a position to give the necessary assistance to inquiry
Further particulars may be looked for by the next mail

The list of the survivors followed beginning with the officers in the
order of their rank They both read the list together The first name
was Captain Helding the second was Lieutenant Crayford

There the wifes joy overpowered her After a pause she put her arm
around Claras waist and spoke to her

Oh my love she murmured are you as happy as I am Is Franks
name there too The tears are in my eyes Read for meI cant read for
myself

The answer came in still sad tones

I have read as far as your husbands name I have no need to read
further

Mrs Crayford dashed the tears from her eyessteadied herselfand
looked at the newspaper

On the list of the survivors the search was vain Franks name was not
among them On a second list headed Dead or Missing the first two
names that appeared were

FRANCIS ALDERSLEY RICHARD WARDOUR

In speechless distress and dismay Mrs Crayford looked at Clara Had
she force enough in her feeble health to sustain the shock that
had fallen on her Yes she bore it with a strange unnatural
resignationshe looked she spoke with the sad selfpossession of
despair

I was prepared for it she said I saw them in the spirit last night
Richard Wardour has discovered the truth and Frank has paid the penalty
with his lifeand I I alone am to blame She shuddered and put her
hand on her heart We shall not be long parted Lucy I shall go to
him He will not return to me

Those words were spoken with a calm certainty of conviction that was
terrible to hear I have no more to say she added after a moment
and rose to return to the house Mrs Crayford caught her by the hand
and forced her to take her seat again

Dont look at me dont speak to me in that horrible manner she
exclaimed Clara it is unworthy of a reasonable being it is doubting
the mercy of God to say what you have just said Look at the newspaper
again See They tell you plainly that their information is not to be
depended onthey warn you to wait for further particulars The very
words at the top of the list show how little they knew of the truth
Dead _or_ Missing On their own showing it is quite as likely that
Frank is missing as that Frank is dead For all you know the next mail
may bring a letter from him Are you listening to me

Yes

Can you deny what I say

No

Yes No Is that the way to answer me when I am so distressed and
so anxious about you

I am sorry I spoke as I did Lucy We look at some subjects in very
different ways I dont dispute dear that yours is the reasonable
view

You dont dispute retorted Mrs Crayford warmly No you do what
is worseyou believe in your own opinion you persist in your own
conclusionwith the newspaper before you Do you or do you not
believe the newspaper

I believe in what I saw last night

In what you saw last night You an educated woman a clever woman
believing in a vision of your own fancya mere dream I wonder you are
not ashamed to acknowledge it

Call it a dream if you like Lucy I have had other dreams at other
timesand I have known them to be fulfilled

Yes said Mrs Crayford For once in a way they may have been
fulfilled by chanceand you notice it and remember it and pin your
faith on it Come Clara be honestWhat about the occasions when the
chance has been against you and your dreams have not been fulfilled
You superstitious people are all alike You conveniently forget when
your dreams and your presentiments prove false For my sake dear if
not for your own she continued in gentler and tenderer tones try
to be more reasonable and more hopeful Dont lose your trust in the
future and your trust in God God who has saved my husband can save
Frank While there is doubt there is hope Dont embitter my happiness
Clara Try to think as I thinkif it is only to show that you love me

She put her arm round the girls neck and kissed her Clara returned
the kiss Clara answered sadly and submissively

I do love you Lucy I _will_ try

Having answered in those terms she sighed to herself and said no more
It would have been plain only too plain to far less observant eyes
than Mrs Crayfords that no salutary impression had been produced on
her She had ceased to defend her own way of thinking she spoke of
it no morebut there was the terrible conviction of Franks death at
Wardours hands rooted as firmly as ever in her mind Discouraged and
distressed Mrs Crayford left her and walked back toward the house



Chapter 15


At the drawingroom window of the villa there appeared a polite little
man with bright intelligent eyes and cheerful sociable manners Neatly
dressed in professional black he stood selfproclaimed a prosperous
country doctorsuccessful and popular in a wide circle of patients and
friends As Mrs Crayford approached him he stepped out briskly to
meet her on the lawn with both hands extended in courteous and cordial
greeting

My dear madam accept my heartfelt congratulations cried the doctor
I have seen the good news in the paper and I could hardly feel more
rejoiced than I do now if I had the honor of knowing Lieutenant Crayford
personally We mean to celebrate the occasion at home I said to my
wife before I came out A bottle of the old Madeira at dinner today
mindto drink the lieutenants health God bless him And how is our
interesting patient The news is not altogether what we could wish so
far as she is concerned I felt a little anxious to tell you the truth
about the effect of it and I have paid my visit today before my usual
time Not that I take a gloomy view of the news myself No There is
clearly a doubt about the correctness of the information so far as
Mr Aldersley is concernedand that is a point a great point in Mr
Aldersleys favor I give him the benefit of the doubt as the lawyers
say Does Miss Burnham give him the benefit of the doubt too I hardly
dare hope it I confess

Miss Burnham has grieved and alarmed me Mrs Crayford answered I
was just thinking of sending for you when we met here

With those introductory words she told the doctor exactly what had
happened repeating not only the conversation of that morning between
Clara and herself but also the words which had fallen from Clara in
the trance of the past night

The doctor listened attentively Little by little its easy smiling
composure vanished from his face as Mrs Crayford went on and left him
completely transformed into a grave and thoughtful man

Let us go and look at her he said

He seated himself by Claras side and carefully studied her face with
his hand on her pulse There was no sympathy here between the dreamy
mystical temperament of the patient and the downright practical
character of the doctor Clara secretly disliked her medical attendant
She submitted impatiently to the close investigation of which he made
her the object He questioned herand she answered irritably Advancing
a step further the doctor was not easily discouraged he adverted to
the news of the Expedition and took up the tone of remonstrance which
had been already adopted by Mrs Crayford Clara declined to discuss the
question She rose with formal politeness and requested permission to
return to the house The doctor attempted no further resistance By all
means Miss Burnham he answered resignedlyhaving first cast a look
at Mrs Crayford which said plainly Stay here with me Clara bowed
her acknowledgments in cold silence and left them together The
doctors bright eyes followed the girls wasted yet still graceful
figure as it slowly receded from view with an expression of grave
anxiety which Mrs Crayford noticed with grave misgiving on her side
He said nothing until Clara had disappeared under the veranda which ran
round the gardenside of the house

I think you told me he began that Miss Burnham has neither father
nor mother living

Yes Miss Burnham is an orphan

Has she any near relatives

No You may speak to me as her guardian and her friend Are you alarmed
about her

I am seriously alarmed It is only two days since I called here last
and I see a marked change in her for the worsephysically and morally
a change for the worse Dont needlessly alarm yourself The case is
not I trust entirely beyond the reach of remedy The great hope for
us is the hope that Mr Aldersley may still be living In that event
I should feel no misgivings about the future Her marriage would make a
healthy and a happy woman of her But as things are I own I dread that
settled conviction in her mind that Mr Aldersley is dead and that her
own death is soon to follow In her present state of health this
idea haunting her as it certainly will night and day will have its
influence on her body as well as on her mind Unless we can check the
mischief her last reserves of strength will give way If you wish for
other advice by all means send for it You have my opinion

I am quite satisfied with your opinion Mrs Crayford replied For
Gods sake tell me what can we do

We can try a complete change said the doctor We can remove her at
once from this place

She will refuse to leave it Mrs Crayford rejoined I have more than
once proposed a change to herand she always says No

The doctor paused for a moment like a man collecting his thoughts

I heard something on my way here he proceeded which suggests to my
mind a method of meeting the difficulty that you have just mentioned
Unless I am entirely mistaken Miss Burnham will not say No to the
change that I have in view for her

What is it asked Mrs Crayford eagerly

Pardon me if I ask you a question on my part before I reply said
the doctor Are you fortunate enough to possess any interest at the
Admiralty

Certainly My father is in the Secretarys office and two of the Lords
of the Admiralty are friends of his

Excellent Now I can speak out plainly with little fear of
disappointing you After what I have said you will agree with me that
the only change in Miss Burnhams life which will be of any use to her
is a change that will alter the present tone of her mind on the subject
of Mr Aldersley Place her in a position to discovernot by reference
to her own distempered fancies and visions but by reference to actual
evidence and actual factwhether Mr Aldersley is or is not a living
man and there will be an end of the hysterical delusions which now
threaten to fatally undermine her health Even taking matters at their
worsteven assuming that Mr Aldersley has died in the Arctic seasit
will be less injurious to her to discover this positively than to leave
her mind to feed on its own morbid superstitions and speculations for
weeks and weeks together while the next news from the Expedition is on
its way to England In one word I want you to be in a position before
the week is out to put Miss Burnhams present conviction to a practical
test Suppose you could say to her We differ my dear about Mr
Francis Aldersley You declare without the shadow of a reason for it
that he is certainly dead and worse still that he has died by the
act of one of his brother officers I assert on the authority of the
newspaper that nothing of the sort has happened and that the chances
are all in favor of his being still a living man What do you say to
crossing the Atlantic and deciding which of us is rightyou or I
Do you think Miss Burnham will say No to that Mrs Crayford If I know
anything of human nature she will seize the opportunity as a means of
converting you to a belief in the Second Sight

Good Heavens doctor do you mean to tell me that we are to go to sea
and meet the Arctic Expedition on its way home

Admirably guessed Mrs Crayford That is exactly what I mean

But how is it to be done

I will tell you immediately I mentioneddidnt Ithat I had heard
something on my road to this house

Yes

Well I met an old friend at my own gate who walked with me a part of
the way here Last night my friend dined with the admiral at Portsmouth
Among the guests there was a member of the Ministry who had brought the
news about the Expedition with him from London This gentleman told the
company there was very little doubt that the Admiralty would immediately
send out a steamvessel to meet the rescued men on the shores of
America and bring them home Wait a little Mrs Crayford Nobody
knows as yet under what rules and regulations the vessel will sail
Under somewhat similar circumstances privileged people have been
received as passengers or rather as guests in her majestys shipsand
what has been conceded on former occasions may by bare possibility be
conceded now I can say no more If you are not afraid of the voyage for
yourself I am not afraid of it nay I am all in favor of it on medical
grounds for my patient What do you say Will you write to your father
and ask him to try what his interest will do with his friends at the
Admiralty

Mrs Crayford rose excitedly to her feet

Write she exclaimed I will do better than write The journey to
London is no great matterand my housekeeper here is to be trusted
to take care of Clara in my absence I will see my father tonight He
shall make good use of his interest at the Admiraltyyou may rely on
that Oh my dear doctor what a prospect it is My husband Clara
What a discovery you have madewhat a treasure you are How can I thank
you

Compose yourself my dear madam Dont make too sure of success We
may consider Miss Burnhams objections as disposed of beforehand But
suppose the Lords of the Admiralty say No

In that case I shall be in London doctor and I shall go to them
myself Lords are only men and men are not in the habit of saying No to
me

So they parted



In a week from that day her majestys ship _Amazon_ sailed for North
America Certain privileged persons specially interested in the Arctic
voyagers were permitted to occupy the empty staterooms on board
On the list of these favored guests of the ship were the names of two
ladiesMrs Crayford and Miss Burnham




Fifth SceneThe BoatHouse



Chapter 16


Once more the open seathe sea whose waters break on the shores of
Newfoundland An English steamship lies at anchor in the offing The
vessel is plainly visible through the open doorway of a large boathouse
on the shoreone of the buildings attached to a fishingstation on the
coast of the island

The only person in the boathouse at this moment is a man in the dress
of a sailor He is seated on a chest with a piece of cord in his hand
looking out idly at the sea On the rough carpenters table near him
lies a strange object to be left in such a placea womans veil

What is the vessel lying at anchor in the offing

The vessel is the _Amazon_dispatched from England to receive the
surviving officers and men of the Arctic Expedition The meeting has
been successfully effected on the shores of North America three days
since But the homeward voyage has been delayed by a storm which has
driven the ship out of her course Taking advantage on the third day
of the first returning calm the commander of the _Amazon_ has anchored
off the coast of Newfoundland and has sent ashore to increase his
supplies of water before he sails for England The weary passengers have
landed for a few hours to refresh themselves after the discomforts of
the tempest Among them are the two ladies The veil left on the table
in the boathouse is Claras veil

And who is the man sitting on the chest with the cord in his hand
looking out idly at the sea The man is the only cheerful person in the
ships company In other wordsJohn Want

Still reposing on the chest our friend who never grumbles is
surprised by the sudden appearance of a sailor at the boathouse door

Look sharp with your work there John Want says the sailor
Lieutenant Crayford is just coming in to look after you

With this warning the messenger disappears again John Want rises with
a groan turns the chest up on one end and begins to fasten the cord
round it The ships cook is not a man to look back on his rescue with
the feeling of unmitigated satisfaction which animates his companions
in trouble On the contrary he is ungratefully disposed to regret the
North Pole

If I had only knownthus runs the train of thought in the mind of
John Wantif I had only known before I was rescued that I was to be
brought to this place I believe I should have preferred staying at the
North Pole I was very happy keeping up everybodys spirits at the
North Pole Taking one thing with another I think I must have been very
comfortable at the North Poleif I had only known it Another man in
my place might be inclined to say that this Newfoundland boathouse was
rather a sloppy slimy draughty fishy sort of a habitation to take
shelter in Another man might object to perpetual Newfoundland fogs
perpetual Newfoundland codfish and perpetual Newfoundland dogs We
had some very nice bears at the North Pole Never mind its all one to
me_I_ dont grumble

Have you done cording that box

This time the voice is a voice of authoritythe man at the doorway is
Lieutenant Crayford himself John Want answers his officer in his own
cheerful way

Ive done it as well as I can sirbut the damp of this place is
beginning to tell upon our very ropes I say nothing about our lungsI
only say our ropes

Crayford answers sharply He seems to have lost his former relish for
the humor of John Want

Pooh To look at your wry face one would think that our rescue from
the Arctic regions was a downright misfortune You deserve to be sent
back again

I could be just as cheerful as ever sir if I _was_ sent back again
I hope Im thankful but I dont like to hear the North Pole run down
in such a fishy place as this It was very clean and snowy at the
North Poleand its very damp and sandy here Do you never miss your
bonesoup sir _I_ do It mightnt have been strong but it was very
hot and the cold seemed to give it a kind of a meaty flavor as it went
down Was it you that was acoughing so long last night sir I dont
presume to say anything against the air of these latitudes but I should
be glad to know it wasnt you that was acoughing so hollow Would you
be so obliging as just to feel the state of these ropes with the ends of
your fingers sir You can dry them afterward on the back of my jacket

You ought to have a stick laid on the back of your jacket Take that
box down to the boat directly You croaking vagabond You would have
grumbled in the Garden of Eden

The philosopher of the Expedition was not a man to be silenced by
referring him to the Garden of Eden Paradise itself was not perfect to
John Want

I hope I could be cheerful anywhere sir said the ships cook But
you mark my wordsthere must have been a deal of troublesome work with
the flowerbeds in the Garden of Eden

Having entered that unanswerable protest John Want shouldered the box
and drifted drearily out of the boathouse

Left by himself Crayford looked at his watch and called to a sailor
outside

Where are the ladies he asked

Mrs Crayford is coming this way sir She was just behind you when you
came in

Is Miss Burnham with her

No sir Miss Burnham is down on the beach with the passengers I heard
the young lady asking after you sir

Asking after me Crayford considered with himself as he repeated the
words He added in lower and graver tones You had better tell Miss
Burnham you have seen me here

The man made his salute and went out Crayford took a turn in the
boathouse

Rescued from death in the Arctic wastes and reunited to a beautiful
wife the lieutenant looked nevertheless unaccountably anxious and
depressed What could he be thinking of He was thinking of Clara

On the first day when the rescued men were received on board the
_Amazon_ Clara had embarrassed and distressed not Crayford only but
the other officers of the Expedition as well by the manner in which she
questioned them on the subject of Francis Aldersley and Richard Wardour
She had shown no signs of dismay or despair when she heard that no news
had been received of the two missing men She had even smiled sadly to
herself when Crayford out of compassionate regard for her declared
that he and his comrades had not given up the hope of seeing Frank and
Wardour yet It was only when the lieutenant had expressed himself in
those terms and when it was hoped that the painful subject had been
dismissedthat Clara had startled every one present by announcing that
she had something still to say in relation to Frank and Wardour which
had not been said yet Though she spoke guardedly her next words
revealed suspicions of foul play lurking in her mindexactly reflecting
similar suspicions lurking in Crayfords mindwhich so distressed
the lieutenant and so surprised his comrades as to render them quite
incapable of answering her The warnings of the storm which shortly
afterward broke over the vessel were then visible in sea and sky
Crayford made them his excuse for abruptly leaving the cabin in which
the conversation had taken place His brother officers profiting by his
example pleaded their duties on deck and followed him out

On the next day and the next the tempest still ragedand the
passengers were not able to leave their staterooms But now when the
weather had moderated and the ship had anchorednow when officers
and passengers alike were on shore with leisure time at their
disposalClara had opportunities of returning to the subject of the
lost men and of asking questions in relation to them which would make
it impossible for Crayford to plead an excuse for not answering her How
was he to meet those questions How could he still keep her in ignorance
of the truth

These were the reflections which now troubled Crayford and which
presented him after his rescue in the strangely inappropriate
character of a depressed and anxious man His brother officers as
he well knew looked to him to take the chief responsibility If he
declined to accept it he would instantly confirm the horrible suspicion
in Claras mind The emergency must be met but how to meet itat once
honorably and mercifullywas more than Crayford could tell He
was still lost in his own gloomy thoughts when his wife entered the
boathouse Turning to look at her he saw his own perturbations and
anxieties plainly reflected in Mrs Crayfords face

Have you seen anything of Clara he asked Is she still on the
beach

She is following me to this place Mrs Crayford replied I have been
speaking to her this morning She is just as resolute as ever to insist
on your telling her of the circumstances under which Frank is missing
As things are you have no alternative but to answer her

Help me to answer her Lucy Tell me before she comes in how this
dreadful suspicion first took possession of her All she could possibly
have known when we left England was that the two men were appointed to
separate ships What could have led her to suspect that they had come
together

She was firmly persuaded William that they _would_ come together when
the Expedition left England And she had read in books of Arctic travel
of men left behind by their comrades on the march and of men adrift on
icebergs With her mind full of these images and forebodings she saw
Frank and Wardour or dreamed of them in one of her attacks of trance
I was by her side I heard what she said at the time She warned Frank
that Wardour had discovered the truth She called out to him While you
can stand keep with the other men Frank

Good God cried Crayford I warned him myself almost in those very
words the last time I saw him

Dont acknowledge it William Keep her in ignorance of what you
have just told me She will not take it for what it isa startling
coincidence and nothing more She will accept it as positive
confirmation of the faith the miserable superstitious faith that is in
her So long as you dont actually know that Frank is dead and that he
has died by Wardours hand deny what she saysmislead her for her own
sakedispute all her conclusions as I dispute them Help me to raise
her to the better and nobler belief in the mercy of God She stopped
and looked round nervously at the doorway Hush she whispered Do as
I have told you Clara is here



Chapter 17


Clara stopped at the doorway looking backward and forward distrustfully
between the husband and wife Entering the boathouse and approaching
Crayford she took his arm and led him away a few steps from the place
in which Mrs Crayford was standing

There is no storm now and there are no duties to be done on board the
ship she said with the faint sad smile which it wrung Crayfords
heart to see You are Lucys husband and you have an interest in me
for Lucys sake Dont shrink on that account from giving me pain I
can bear pain Friend and brother will you believe that I have courage
enough to hear the worst Will you promise not to deceive me about
Frank

The gentle resignation in her voice the sad pleading in her look shook
Crayfords selfpossession at the outset He answered her in the worst
possible manner he answered evasively

My dear Clara he said what have I done that you should suspect me
of deceiving you

She looked him searchingly in the face then glanced with renewed
distrust at Mrs Crayford There was a moment of silence Before any of
the three could speak again they were interrupted by the appearance of
one of Crayfords brother officers followed by two sailors carrying a
hamper between them Crayford instantly dropped Claras arm and seized
the welcome opportunity of speaking of other things

Any instructions from the ship Steventon he asked approaching the
officer

Verbal instructions only Steventon replied The ship will sail with
the floodtide We shall fire a gun to collect the people and send
another boat ashore In the meantime here are some refreshments for the
passengers The ship is in a state of confusion the ladies will eat
their luncheon more comfortably here

Hearing this Mrs Crayford took _her_ opportunity of silencing Clara
next

Come my dear she said Let us lay the cloth before the gentlemen
come in

Clara was too seriously bent on attaining the object which she had
in view to be silenced in that way I will help you directly she
answeredthen crossed the room and addressed herself to the officer
whose name was Steventon

Can you spare me a few minutes she asked I have something to say to
you

I am entirely at your service Miss Burnham

Answering in those words Steventon dismissed the two sailors Mrs
Crayford looked anxiously at her husband Crayford whispered to her
Dont be alarmed about Steventon I have cautioned him his discretion
is to be depended on

Clara beckoned to Crayford to return to her

I will not keep you long she said I will promise not to distress
Mr Steventon Young as I am you shall both find that I am capable
of selfcontrol I wont ask you to go back to the story of your past
sufferings I only want to be sure that I am right about one thingI
mean about what happened at the time when the exploring party was
dispatched in search of help As I understand it you cast lots among
yourselves who was to go with the party and who was to remain behind
Frank cast the lot to go She paused shuddering And Richard
Wardour she went on cast the lot to remain behind On your honor as
officers and gentlemen is this the truth

On my honor Crayford answered it is the truth

On my honor Steventon repeated it is the truth

She looked at them carefully considering her next words before she
spoke again

You both drew the lot to stay in the huts she said addressing
Crayford and Steventon And you are both here Richard Wardour drew the
lot to stay and Richard Wardour is not here How does his name come to
be with Franks on the list of the missing

The question was a dangerous one to answer Steventon left it to
Crayford to reply Once again he answered evasively

It doesnt follow my dear he said that the two men were missing
together because their names happen to come together on the list

Clara instantly drew the inevitable conclusion from that illconsidered
reply

Frank is missing from the party of relief she said Am I to
understand that Wardour is missing from the huts

Both Crayford and Steventon hesitated Mrs Crayford cast one indignant
look at them and told the necessary lie without a moments hesitation

Yes she said Wardour is missing from the huts

Quickly as she had spoken she had still spoken too late Clara had
noticed the momentary hesitation on the part of the two officers She
turned to Steventon

I trust to your honor she said quietly Am I right or wrong in
believing that Mrs Crayford is mistaken

She had addressed herself to the right man of the two Steventon had
no wife present to exercise authority over him Steventon put on his
honor and fairly forced to say something owned the truth Wardour had
replaced an officer whom accident had disabled from accompanying the
party of relief and Wardour and Frank were missing together

Clara looked at Mrs Crayford

You hear she said It is you who are mistaken not I What you
call Accident what I call Fate brought Richard Wardour and Frank
together as members of the same Expedition after all Without waiting
for a reply she again turned to Steventon and surprised him by
changing the painful subject of the conversation of her own accord

Have you been in the Highlands of Scotland she asked

I have never been in the Highlands the lieutenant replied

Have you ever read in books about the Highlands of such a thing as
The Second Sight

Yes

Do you believe in the Second Sight

Steventon politely declined to commit himself to a direct reply

I dont know what I might have done if I had ever been in the
Highlands he said As it is I have had no opportunities of giving
the subject any serious consideration

I wont put your credulity to the test Clara proceeded I wont ask
you to believe anything more extraordinary than that I had a strange
dream in England not very long since My dream showed me what you have
just acknowledgedand more than that How did the two missing men come
to be parted from their companions Were they lost by pure accident or
were they deliberately left behind on the march

Crayford made a last vain effort to check her inquiries at the point
which they had now reached

Neither Steventon nor I were members of the party of relief he said
How are we to answer you

Your brother officers who _were_ members of the party must have told
you what happened Clara rejoined I only ask you and Mr Steventon to
tell me what they told you

Mrs Crayford interposed again with a practical suggestion this time

The luncheon is not unpacked yet she said Come Clara this is our
business and the time is passing

The luncheon can wait a few minutes longer Clara answered Bear with
my obstinacy she went on laying her hand caressingly on Crayfords
shoulder Tell me how those two came to be separated from the rest You
have always been the kindest of friendsdont begin to be cruel to me
now

The tone in which she made her entreaty to Crayford went straight to
the sailors heart He gave up the hopeless struggle he let her see a
glimpse of the truth

On the third day out he said Franks strength failed him He fell
behind the rest from fatigue

Surely they waited for him

It was a serious risk to wait for him my child Their lives and the
lives of the men they had left in the huts depended in that dreadful
climate on their pushing on But Frank was a favorite They waited half
a day to give Frank the chance of recovering his strength

There he stopped There the imprudence into which his fondness for Clara
had led him showed itself plainly and closed his lips

It was too late to take refuge in silence Clara was determined on
hearing more

She questioned Steventon next

Did Frank go on again after the halfdays rest she asked

He tried to go on

And failed

Yes

What did the men do when he failed Did they turn cowards Did they
desert Frank

She had purposely used language which might irritate Steventon into
answering her plainly He was a young manhe fell into the snare that
she had set for him

Not one among them was a coward Miss Burnham he replied warmly
You are speaking cruelly and unjustly of as brave a set of fellows as
ever lived The strongest man among them set the example he volunteered
to stay by Frank and to bring him on in the track of the exploring
party

There Steventon stoppedconscious on his side that he had said too
much Would she ask him who this volunteer was No She went straight on
to the most embarrassing question that she had put yetreferring to the
volunteer as if Steventon had already mentioned his name

What made Richard Wardour so ready to risk his life for Franks sake
she said to Crayford Did he do it out of friendship for Frank Surely
you can tell me that Carry your memory back to the days when you were
all living in the huts Were Frank and Wardour friends at that time Did
you never hear any angry words pass between them

There Mrs Crayford saw her opportunity of giving her husband a timely
hint

My dear child she said how can you expect him to remember that
There must have been plenty of quarrels among the men all shut up
together and all weary of each others company no doubt

Plenty of quarrels Crayford repeated and every one of them made up
again

And every one of them made up again Mrs Crayford reiterated in her
turn There a plainer answer than that you cant wish to have Now are
you satisfied Mr Steventon come and lend a hand as you say at sea
with the hamperClara wont help me William dont stand there doing
nothing This hamper holds a great deal we must have a division of
labor Your division shall be laying the tablecloth Dont handle it
in that clumsy way You unfold a tablecloth as if you were unfurling
a sail Put the knives on the right and the forks on the left and the
napkin and the bread between them Clara if you are not hungry in this
fine air you ought to be Come and do your duty come and have some
lunch

She looked up as she spoke Clara appeared to have yielded at last to
the conspiracy to keep her in the dark She had returned slowly to the
boathouse doorway and she was standing alone on the threshold looking
out Approaching her to lead her to the luncheontable Mrs Crayford
could hear that she was speaking softly to herself She was repeating
the farewell words which Richard Wardour had spoken to her at the ball

A time may come when I shall forgive _you_ But the man who has robbed
me of you shall rue the day when you and he first met Oh Frank
Frank does Richard still live with your blood on his conscience and
my image in his heart

Her lips suddenly closed She started and drew back from the doorway
trembling violently Mrs Crayford looked out at the quiet seaward view

Anything there that frightens you my dear she asked I can see
nothing except the boats drawn up on the beach

_I_ can see nothing either Lucy

And yet you are trembling as if there was something dreadful in the
view from this door

There _is_ something dreadful I feel it though I see nothing I feel
it nearer and nearer in the empty air darker and darker in the sunny
light I dont know what it is Take me away No Not out on the beach
I cant pass the door Somewhere else somewhere else

Mrs Crayford looked round her and noticed a second door at the inner
end of the boathouse She spoke to her husband

See where that door leads to William

Crayford opened the door It led into a desolate inclosure half garden
half yard Some nets stretched on poles were hanging up to dry No other
objects were visiblenot a living creature appeared in the place It
doesnt look very inviting my dear said Mrs Crayford I am at your
service however What do you say

She offered her arm to Clara as she spoke Clara refused it She took
Crayfords arm and clung to him

Im frightened dreadfully frightened she said to him faintly You
keep with mea woman is no protection I want to be with you She
looked round again at the boathouse doorway Oh she whispered Im
cold all overIm frozen with fear of this place Come into the yard
Come into the yard

Leave her to me said Crayford to his wife I will call you if she
doesnt get better in the open air

He took her out at once and closed the yard door behind them

Mr Steventon do you understand this asked Mrs Crayford What can
she possibly be frightened of

She put the question still looking mechanically at the door by which
her husband and Clara had gone out Receiving no reply she glanced
round at Steventon He was standing on the opposite side of the
luncheontable with his eyes fixed attentively on the view from the
main doorway of the boathouse Mrs Crayford looked where Steventon was
looking This time there was something visible She saw the shadow of a
human figure projected on the stretch of smooth yellow sand in front of
the boathouse

In a moment more the figure appeared A man came slowly into view and
stopped on the threshold of the door



Chapter 18


The man was a sinister and terrible object to look at His eyes glared
like the eyes of a wild animal his head was bare his long gray hair
was torn and tangled his miserable garments hung about him in rags He
stood in the doorway a speechless figure of misery and want staring at
the wellspread table like a hungry dog

Steventon spoke to him

Who are you

He answered in a hoarse hollow voice

A starving man

He advanced a few steps slowly and painfully as if he were sinking
under fatigue

Throw me some bones from the table he said Give me my share along
with the dogs

There was madness as well as hunger in his eyes while he spoke those
words Steventon placed Mrs Crayford behind him so that he might be
easily able to protect her in case of need and beckoned to two sailors
who were passing the door of the boathouse at the time

Give the man some bread and meat he said and wait near him

The outcast seized on the bread and meat with lean longnailed hands
that looked like claws After his first mouthful of the food he
stopped considered vacantly with himself and broke the bread and meat
into two portions One portion he put into an old canvas wallet that
hung over his shoulder the other he devoured voraciously Steventon
questioned him

Where do you come from

From the sea

Wrecked

Yes

Steventon turned to Mrs Crayford

There may be some truth in the poor wretchs story he said I heard
something of a strange boat having been cast on the beach thirty or
forty miles higher up the coast When were you wrecked my man

The starving creature looked up from his food and made an effort to
collect his thoughtsto exert his memory It was not to be done He
gave up the attempt in despair His language when he spoke was as wild
as his looks

I cant tell you he said I cant get the wash of the sea out of my
ears I cant get the shining stars all night and the burning sun all
day out of my brain When was I wrecked When was I first adrift in the
boat When did I get the tiller in my hand and fight against hunger and
sleep When did the gnawing in my breast and the burning in my head
first begin I have lost all reckoning of it I cant think I cant
sleep I cant get the wash of the sea out of my ears What are you
baiting me with questions for Let me eat

Even the sailors pitied him The sailors asked leave of their officer to
add a little drink to his meal

Weve got a drop of grog with us sir in a bottle May we give it to
him

Certainly

He took the bottle fiercely as he had taken the food drank a little
stopped and considered with himself again He held up the bottle to the
light and marking how much liquor it contained carefully drank half
of it only This done he put the bottle in his wallet along with the
food

Are you saving it up for another time said Steventon

Im saving it up the man answered Never mind what for Thats my
secret

He looked round the boathouse as he made that reply and noticed Mrs
Crayford for the first time

A woman among you he said Is she English Is she young Let me look
closer at her

He advanced a few steps toward the table

Dont be afraid Mrs Crayford said Steventon

I am not afraid Mrs Crayford replied He frightened me at firsthe
interests me now Let him speak to me if he wishes it

He never spoke He stood in dead silence looking long and anxiously at
the beautiful Englishwoman

Well said Steventon

He shook his head sadly and drew back again with a heavy sigh

No he said to himself thats not _her_ face No not found yet

Mrs Crayfords interest was strongly excited She ventured to speak to
him

Who is it you want to find she asked Your wife

He shook his head again

Who then What is she like

He answered that question in words His hoarse hollow voice softened
little by little into sorrowful and gentle tones

Young he said with a fair sad facewith kind tender eyeswith a
soft clear voice Young and loving and merciful I keep her face in
my mind though I can keep nothing else I must wander wander
wanderrestless sleepless homelesstill I find _her_ Over the ice
and over the snow tossing on the sea tramping over the land awake all
night awake all day wander wander wander till I find _her_

He waved his hand with a gesture of farewell and turned wearily to go
out

At the same moment Crayford opened the yard door

I think you had better come to Clara he began and checked himself
noticing the stranger Who is that

The shipwrecked man hearing another voice in the room looked round
slowly over his shoulder Struck by his appearance Crayford advanced
a little nearer to him Mrs Crayford spoke to her husband as he passed
her

Its only a poor mad creature William she whisperedshipwrecked
and starving

Mad Crayford repeated approaching nearer and nearer to the man Am
_I_ in my right senses He suddenly sprang on the outcast and seized
him by the throat Richard Wardour he cried in a voice of fury
Alivealive to answer for Frank

The man struggled Crayford held him

Where is Frank he said You villain where is Frank

The man resisted no longer He repeated vacantly

Villain and where is Frank

As the name escaped his lips Clara appeared at the open yard door and
hurried into the room

I heard Richards name she said I heard Franks name What does it
mean

At the sound of her voice the outcast renewed the struggle to free
himself with a sudden frenzy of strength which Crayford was not able to
resist He broke away before the sailors could come to their officers
assistance Halfway down the length of the room he and Clara met one
another face to face A new light sparkled in the poor wretchs eyes a
cry of recognition burst from his lips He flung one hand up wildly in
the air Found he shouted and rushed out to the beach before any of
the men present could stop him

Mrs Crayford put her arms round Clara and held her up She had not made
a movement she had not spoken a word The sight of Wardours face had
petrified her

The minutes passed and there rose a sudden burst of cheering from the
sailors on the beach near the spot where the fishermens boats were
drawn up Every man left his work Every man waved his cap in the air
The passengers near at hand caught the infection of enthusiasm and
joined the crew A moment more and Richard Wardour appeared again in
the doorway carrying a man in his arms He staggered breathless with
the effort that he was making to the place where Clara stood held up
in Mrs Crayfords arms

Saved Clara he cried Saved for _you_

He released the man and placed him in Claras arms

Frank footsore and wearybut livingsaved saved for _her_

Now Clara cried Mrs Crayford which of us is right I who believed
in the mercy of God or you who believed in a dream

She never answered she clung to Frank in speechless ecstasy She never
even looked at the man who had preserved him in the first absorbing joy
of seeing Frank alive Step by step slower and slower Richard Wardour
drew back and left them by themselves

I may rest now he said faintly I may sleep at last The task is
done The struggle is over

His last reserves of strength had been given to Frank He stoppedhe
staggeredhis hands waved feebly in search of support But for one
faithful friend he would have fallen Crayford caught him Crayford laid
his old comrade gently on some sails strewn in a corner and pillowed
Wardours weary head on his own bosom The tears streamed over his face
Richard dear Richard he said Rememberand forgive me

Richard neither heeded nor heard him His dim eyes still looked across
the room at Clara and Frank

I have made _her_ happy he murmured I may lay down my weary head
now on the mother earth that hushes all her children to rest at last
Sink heart sink sink to rest Oh look at them he said to Crayford
with a burst of grief They have forgotten _me_ already

It was true The interest was all with the two lovers Frank was young
and handsome and popular Officers passengers and sailors they all
crowded round Frank They all forgot the martyred man who had saved
himthe man who was dying in Crayfords arms

Crayford tried once more to attract his attentionto win his
recognition while there was yet time Richard speak to me Speak to
your old friend

He look round he vacantly repeated Crayfords last word

Friend he said My eyes are dim friendmy mind is dull I have
lost all memories but the memory of _her_ Dead thoughtsall dead
thoughts but that one And yet you look at me kindly Why has your face
gone down with the wreck of all the rest

He paused his face changed his thoughts drifted back from present to
past he looked at Crayford vacantly lost in the terrible remembrances
that were rising in him as the shadows rise with the coming night

Hark ye friend he whispered Never let Frank know it There was a
time when the fiend within me hungered for his life I had my hands on
the boat I heard the voice of the Tempter speaking to me Launch it
and leave him to die I waited with my hands on the boat and my eyes on
the place where he slept Leave him leave him the voice whispered
Love him the lads voice answered moaning and murmuring in his
sleep Love him Clara for helping _me_ I heard the morning wind
come up in the silence over the great deep Far and near I heard the
groaning of the floating ice floating floating to the clear water and
the balmy air And the wicked Voice floated away with itaway away
away forever Love him love him Clara for helping _me_ No wind
could float that away Love him Clara

His voice sank into silence his head dropped on Crayfords breast
Frank saw it Frank struggled up on his bleeding feet and parted the
friendly throng round him Frank had not forgotten the man who had saved
him

Let me go to him he cried I must and will go to him Clara come
with me

Clara and Steventon supported him between them He fell on his knees at
Wardours side he put his hand on Wardours bosom

Richard

The weary eyes opened again The sinking voice was heard feebly once
more

Ah poor Frank I didnt forget you Frank when I came here to beg
I remembered you lying down outside in the shadow of the boats I saved
you your share of the food and drink Too weak to get at it now A
little rest Frank I shall soon be strong enough to carry you down to
the ship

The end was near They all saw it now The men reverently uncovered
their heads in the presence of Death In an agony of despair Frank
appealed to the friends round him

Get something to strengthen him for Gods sake Oh men men I should
never have been here but for him He has given all his strength to my
weakness and now see how strong I am and how weak _he_ is Clara I
held by his arm all over the ice and snow _He_ kept watch when I was
senseless in the open boat _His_ hand dragged me out of the waves when
we were wrecked Speak to him Clara speak to him His voice failed
him and his head dropped on Wardours breast

She spoke as well as her tears would let her

Richard have you forgotten me

He rallied at the sound of that beloved voice He looked up at her as
she knelt at his head

Forgotten you Still looking at her he lifted his hand with an
effort and laid it on Frank Should I have been strong enough to save
him if I could have forgotten you He waited a moment and turned his
face feebly toward Crayford Stay he said Someone was here and
spoke to me A faint light of recognition glimmered in his eyes Ah
Crayford I recollect now Dear Crayford come nearer My mind clears
but my eyes grow dim You will remember me kindly for Franks sake Poor
Frank why does he hide his face Is he crying Nearer ClaraI want to
look my last at _you_ My sister Clara Kiss me sister kiss me before
I die

She stooped and kissed his forehead A faint smile trembled on his
lips It passed away and stillness possessed the facethe stillness of
Death

Crayfords voice was heard in the silence

The loss is ours he said The gain is his He has won the greatest
of all conqueststhe conquest of himself And he has died in the moment
of victory Not one of us here but may live to envy _his_ glorious
death

The distant report of a gun came from the ship in the offing and
signaled the return to England and to home
