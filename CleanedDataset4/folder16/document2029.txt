CHAPTER I

THE TOUCH OF A CHILD

I have given my word of honormy sacred oathnot to betray what I
have discovered here

At these words from the prisoner a shout arose in which oaths and
mocking laughter mingled like the growling and snapping of
hungermaddened wolves

Then if I must die Gledware cried his voice in its shrill
excitement dominating the ferocious insults of the ruffians dont
kill the childyou see she is asleepand shes so youngonly five
Even if she were awake she wouldnt know how to tell about this cabin
For Gods sake dont kill the little girl

Since the seizure of Gledware the child had been lying on the rude
table in the midst of a greasy pack of cardscards that had been
thrown down at the sound of his galloping horse The table supported
also much of the booty captured from the wagontrain while on the
dirt floor beside it were prizes of the freebooting expedition too
large to find restingplace on the boards Nor was this all Mingled
with stolen garments cans and boxes of provisions purses and bags of
gold were the Indian disguises in which the highwaymen from NoMans
Land had descended on the prairieschooners on their tedious journey
from Abilene Kansas toward the Southwest

In the midst of this confusion of disguises booty and playingcards
surrounded by cruel and sensual faces the child slept soundly her
lips slightly parted her cheeks delicately flushed her face eloquent
in its appeal of helplessness innocence and beauty One of the band
a tall broadshouldered man of middleage with an immense quantity of
whiskers perhaps worn as a visible sign of inward wildness was
despite his hardened nature moved to remonstrance Under cover of
lurid oaths and outrageous obscenity he advanced his opinion that the
kid neednt be shot just because her father was a sneakjug spy

Shut up roared a tremendous voice not directly to the intercessor
or to the prisoner but to all present Evidently it was a voice of
authority for comparative silence followed the command The speaker
stepped forward thrust his fingers through his intensely red shock of
hair and continued with one leg thrust forward

You know I am something of an orator or I guess you wouldnt of made
me your leader Now as long as Im your leader Im going to lead
but I aint never unreasonable and when talk is needed Im copious
enough I am called Red Kimball and my brother yonder he is knowed
as Kansas Kimball What else is knowed of us is this that we
wasnt never wont to turn loose a spy when once ketched Here is a man
who says he is Henry Gledwarethough God knows if thats so he comes
galloping up to the door just as we are in the midst of a game I
stakes all my share of the spoils on the game and Brick Willock is in
a fair way to win it that I admit but in comes this here spy

The prisoner in a frenzied voice disclaimed any purpose of spying That
morning he had driven the last wagon of the train containing his
invalid wife and his stepdaughterfor the child lying on the table was
his wifes daughter At the alarm that the first wagon had been
attacked by Indians he had turned about his horses and driven
furiously over the prairie he knew not whither All that day he had
fled seeing no one hearing no pursuing horsebeat At night his
wife unable in her weak condition to sustain the terrible jolting
had expired Taking nothing from the wagon but his saddle he had
mounted one of the horses with the child before him and had continued
his flight the terrific wind at his back Unaware that the wind had
changed he had traversed horseback much of the distance traveled
during the day and at about two in the morningthat is to say about
all hour agoseeing a light he had ridden straight toward it to find
shelter from the storm

The prisoner narrated all this in nervous haste though he had already
given every particular time and again His form as well as his voice
trembled with undisguised terror and indeed the red and cruel eyes
fastened contemptuously on him might have caused a much braver man than
Gledware to shudder visibly

Well pard said the leader of the band waiting until he had
finished you cant never claim that you aint been given your say
for I do admire free speech I want to address you reasonable and
make this plain and simple as only a man that has been alleged to be
something of an orator can accomplish My men and me has had our
conference and its decided that both of you has got to be shot and
immediate The reasons is none but what a sensible man must admit and
such I take you to be I am sorry this has happened and so is my men
and we wish you well Its a hard saying pard but whatever your
intentions a spy you have proved For what do you find on busting
open our door Here we sit playing with our booty for stakes and our
Indian togs lying all about You couldnt help knowing that we was the
Indians that gutted them wagons and put up the fight that left every
man and woman dead on the field except that there last wagon you are
telling us about You might wish you didnt know the same but once
knowed we aint going to let you loose As to that wagon you claim to
have stole away from under our very noses

A skeptical laugh burst from the listeners

Gledware eagerly declared that if he had the remotest idea in what
direction it had been left he would be glad to lead them to the spot
He could describe it and its contents

You see pard Red Kimball interposed you are everlasting losing
sight of the point This here is 1880 which I may say is a recent
date Time was when a fellow could live in Cimarron and come and go
free and no questions askedand none answered But civilization is
apressing us hard and these days is not our fathers days We are
pretty independent even yet in old Cimarron but busybodies has got
together trying to make it a regular United States territory and they
aint going to stand for a real outandout band of highwaymen such as
used to levy on stagecoaches and wagontrains without exciting no more
remarks than the buffaloes You may be sorry times is changed so am
I but if times IS fresh we might as well look em in the face Us
fellows has been operating for some years but whatever we do is blamed
on the Indians That there is a secret that would ruin our business
if it got out Tomorrow a gang of white men will be depredating in
the Washita country to get revenge for todays massacre and me and my
men couldnt join in the fun with easy consciences if we knowed you was
somewheres loose to tell your story

Again Gledware protested that he would never betray the band

Oh cut this short interposed Kansas Kimball with an oath
Daylight will catch us and nothing done if we listen to that
whitelivered spy We dont believe in that wagon he talks about and
as for this kid he brought her along just to save his bacon

No as God lives cried Gledware Cant you see she is dead for
sleep She was terrified out of her wits all day and Ive ridden with
her all night Dont kill her men He turned impassioned eyes on
the leader Look at herso youngso unsuspectingyou cant have
the heart to murder a child like that in cold blood

Right you are exclaimed the man with the ferocious whiskershe who
had been spoken of as Brick Willock Youll have to go pard but Im
against killing infants

The leader darted an angry glance at the man who but for the untoward
arrival of Gledware would have won from him his share of the booty
But his voice was smooth and pleasant as he resumed Yes pard the
kid must die We couldnt do nothing with her and if we left her on
some doorstep shes sure old enough and she looks full sharp enough
to tell sufficient to trammel us good and plenty If we sets her loose
in the prairie shed starve to death if not foundand if found it
would settle our case And as Kansas says this debate must close or
daylight will catch us

Brick Willock with terrible oaths again expressed himself as strongly
opposed to this decision

Well Brick said Red with a sneer do YOU want to take the kid and
raise her yourself Weve either got to do away with her or keep her
hid Do YOU want to be her nurse and keep with her in some cave or
other while we go foraging

Willock muttered deep in his throat while his companions laughed
disdainfully

Weve had enough of this Red declared his voice suddenly grown hard
and cold Kansas take the prisoner Brick Willock as youre so fond
of the kid you can carry HER He opened the door and a rush of wind
extinguished the candle There was silence while it was being
relighted The flickering light reddening to a steady glow revealed
no mercy on the scowling countenances about the table and no shadow of
presentiment on that of the still unconscious child

Red went outside and waited till his brother had drawn forth the
quivering man and Brick Willock had carried out the girl Then he
looked back into the room You fellows can stay in here he said
authoritatively What weve got to do aint any easier with a lot of
men standing about looking on

The man who had relighted the candle and who crouched to shield it
with a hairy hand from the gust nodded approval His friends were
already gathering together the cards to lose in the excitement of
gambling consciousness of what was about to be done Red closed the
door on the scene and turned to face the light

The wind came in furious gusts with brief intervals of calm There
were no clouds however and the moon which had risen not long before
made the prairie almost as light as if morning had dawned As far as
the eye could reach in any direction nothing was to be seen but the
level ground the unflecked sky the cabin and the little group near
the tethered ponies

Gledware had already been stationed with his face toward the moon and
Kansas Kimball was calmly examining his pistol Between them and the
horses Brick Willock had come to a halt the little girl still
sleeping in his powerful arms Reds eagle eye noted that she had
unconsciously slipped an arm about the highwaymans neck as if by some
instinct she would cling the closer to the only one in the band of ten
who had spoken for her life

Red scowled heavily He had not forgiven Willock for beating him at
cards still less for his persistent opposition to his wishes and he
now resolved that it should be Willocks hand to deal the fatal blow
He had been troubled before tonight by insubordination on the part of
this man of bristling whiskers this knave whose voice was ever for
mercy if mercy were possible Why should Willock have joined men who
were without scruple and without shame As the leader stared at him
sullenly he reflected that it was just such natures that fail at the
last extremity of hardihood that desert comrades in crime that turn
states evidence YesWillock would deal the blow even if Red found
it necessary to call all his men from the cabin to enforce the order

The captains fears were not groundless He would have been much more
alarmed could he have known the wonderful thoughts that surged through
Willocks brain and the wonderful emotions that thrilled his heart at
the warm confiding pressure of the arm about his neck



CHAPTER II

BRICK MAKES A MOVE

As Kansas Kimball raised his weapon to fire the man before him uttered
a cry of terror and began to entreat for his life In the full light
of the dazzling moon his face showed all the pallor all the
contortions of a coward who though believing himself lost has not the
resolution to mask his fear He poured forth incoherent promises of
secrecy ejaculations of despair and frenzied assurances of innocence

Hold on Kansas interposed Red Theres not a one of the bunch
believes that story about the last wagon getting away and the dying
wife We know this Gledware is a spy whatever he says and that he
brought the kid along for protection He knew if we got back to
NoMans Land we couldnt be touched not being under no jurisdiction
and he wanted to find us with our paint and feathers off Hes a
sneaking dog and a bullets too good for him Butwith an
oathblessed if he dont hate to die worse than any man ever I saw I
dont mind to spare him a few minutes if hes agreeable I put it to
himwould he rather the kid be put out of the way first and him
afterwards or does he want the first call

For Gods sake put it off as long as you will quavered the
prisoner I swear Im no spy I swear

This is unpleasant the captain of the highwaymen interposed Just
you say another word and Ill put daylight into you with my own hand
Stand there and keep mum and Ill give you a little breathing space

Kansas not without a sigh of relief lowered his weapon and looked
questioningly at his brother The shadow of the log cabin was upon
him making more sinister his uncouth attire and his lean vindictive
face under the huge Mexican hat Gledware not daring to move kept
his eyes fixed on that deep gloom out of which at any moment might
spurt forth the red flash of death From within the cabin came loud
oaths inspired by cards or drink as if the inmates would drown any
calls for mercy or sounds of execution that might be abroad in the
night

Now Brick Willock the leader spoke grimly take your turn first
That kids got to die and you are to do the trick and do it without
any foolishness

I cant Willock declared doggedly

Oh yes yes you can Brick You see we cant tend to no infant
class and I aint hardhearted enough to leave a fiveyearold girl to
die of hunger on the prairie nor do I mean to take her to no town or
stagestation as a card for to be tracked by Oh yes you can Brick
and nows the time

Red exclaimed Willock desperately I tell you fair and I tell you
foul that this little one lives as long as I do

And what do you aim to do with her eh Brick

Willock made no reply He had formed no plans for his future or for
that of the child but his left arm closed more tightly about her

Now Brick said Red slowly this aint the first time you have
proved yourself no man for our business and I call Kansas to witness
youve brought this on yourself

Without finishing his sentence Red swiftly raised his arm and fired
pointblank at Willocks head as it was defined above the sleeping form
Though famed as an orator Red understood very well that at times
action is everything and there is death in long speaking He was noted
as a man who never missed his mark and in the Cimarron country which
belonged to no state and therefore to no court extensive and deadly
had been his practise without fear of retribution

Now however his bullet had gone astray The few words to which he
had treated himself as an introduction to the intended deed had proved
his undoing They had been enough to warn Willock of what was coming
and just before Kansas had been called on to witness that is an
instant before Red fired Willock had sent a bullet through the
threatening wrist The two detonations were almost simultaneous and
Reds roar of pain as he dropped his weapon rang out as an
accompaniment to the crash of firearms

The next instant Willock with a second shot from his sixshooter
stretched Kansas on the ground then rushing forward with reversed
weapon he brought the butt down on Reds head with such force as to
deprive him of consciousness So swift and deadly were his movements
so wild his appearance as with long locks streaming in the wind and
huge black whiskers hiding all but glittering eyes aquiline nose and a
brief space of tough red skinso much more like a demon than a man it
was no wonder that the child awakened by the firing screamed with
terror at finding her head pressed to his bosom

Come Willock called breathlessly to the prisoner who still stood
with his back to the moon as if horror at what he had just witnessed
rendered him as helpless as he had been from sheer terror Still
holding the screaming child he darted to the ponies that were tied to
the projecting logs of the cabin and hastily unfastened two of the
fleetest

Henry Gledware awakened as from a trance bounded to his side Willock
helped him to mount then placed the child the saddle in front of him

Ride he urged hoarsely ride for your life They aint no other
chance for you and the kid and they aint no other chance for me

He leaped upon the second pony

Which way faltered Gledware settling in the saddle and grasping the
bridle but without the others practised ease

Follow the moonIll ride against the windmore chance for one of us
if we aint together Start when I do for when they hear the horses
theyll be out of that door like so many devils turned loose on us
Ride pardner ride and save the kid for Gods sake Nowoff we go

He gave Gledwares pony a vicious cut with his lariat and drove the
spurs into his own broncho The thunder of hoofs as they plunged in
different directions caused a sudden commotion within the isolated
cabin The door was flung open and in the light that streamed forth
Willock looking back saw dark forms rush out gather about the
prostrate forms of the two brothers move here and there in indecision
then by a common impulse burst into a swinging run for the horses

As for Gledware he never once turned his face Urging on his horse at
utmost speed and clasping the child to his breast he raced toward the
light The shadow of horse man and child at first long and black
lessened to a mere speck then vanished with the rider beyond the
circle of the level world



CHAPTER III

FLIGHT

Brick Willock galloping toward the Southeast frequently looked back
He saw the desperadoes leap upon their horses wheel about in short
circles that brought the animals upright then spring forward in
pursuit He heard the shouting which though far away sounded the
unmistakable accent of ungovernable fury In the glaring moonlight he
distinguished plainly the cloud of dust and sand raised by the horses
which the wind lifted in white shapes against the deep blue of the sky
And looking beyond his pursuers toward the rude cabin where the
highwaymen had so long held their rendezvous he knew because no
animate forms appeared against the horizon that the Kimball brothers
lay where he had stretched themone senseless from the crashing blow
on his head the other lifeless from the bullet in his breast

The little girl and her stepfather had vanished from the smooth open
page of the Texas Panhandleand Brick Willock rejoiced with a joy new
to him that these escaped prisoners had not been pursued It was
himself that the band meant to subject to their savage vengeance and
himself alone The murder of the child was abhorrent to their hearts
which had not attained the hardened insensibility of their leaders
conscience and they were willing for the supposed spy to escape since
it spared them the embarrassment of disposing of the little girl

But Brick Willock had been one of them and he had killed their leader
and their leaders brother or at least had brought them to the verge
of death If Red Kimball revived he would doubtless right his own
wrongs should Willock live to be punished In the meantime it was
for them to treat with the traitorthis giant of a Texan
hugewhiskered slow of speech who had ever been first to throw
himself into the thick of danger but who had always hung back from
deeds of cruelty He had plundered coaches and wagontrains with them
he had fought with them against strong bodies of emigrants he had
killed and burnedin the eyes of the world his deeds made him one of
them and his aspect marked him as the most dangerous of the band But
they had always felt the differenceand now they meant to kill him not
only because he had overpowered their leader but because of this
difference

As their bullets pursued him Willock lay along the body of the
broncho feeling his steed very small and himself very largeand yet
despite the rain of lead his pleasure over the escape of the child
warmed his heart The sand was plowed up by his side from the
peppering of bulletsbut he seemed to feel that innocent unconscious
arm about his great neck the yells of rage were in his ears but he
heard the soft breathing of the little one fast asleep in the midst of
her dangers

He had selected for himself and for Gledware ponies that had often
been run against each other and which no others of all Red Kimballs
corral could surpass in speed Gledware and the child were on the pony
that Kimball had once staked against the swiftest animal the Indians
could produceand Willock rode the pride of the Indian band which had
almost won the prize The ponies had been staked on the issue of that
encounterand the highwaymen had retained by right of craft and
force what the government would not permit its wards to barter or sell

The race was long but always unequal The ruffians who had dashed from
the scene of the cabin almost in an even line scattered and straggled
unevenly now only two were able to send bullets whistling about
Willocks head now only one found it possible to cover the distance
At last even he fell out of range The Indian pony apparently
tireless shot on like an arrow driven into the teeth of the wind
sending up behind a cloud of dust that stretched backward toward the
baffled pursuers a long wavering ribbon like a clew left to guide the
band into the mysterious depths of the Great American Desert

When the last of the pursuers found further effort useless he checked
his horse Willock now sat erect on the bronchos bare back lightly
clasping the halter Looking behind he saw seven horsemen in varying
degrees of remoteness motionless doubtless fixing their wolfish eyes
on his fleeing form As long as he could distinguish these specks
against the sky they remained stationary To his excited imagination
they represented a living wall drawn up between him and the abode of
men Should he ever venture back to that world he fancied those seven
avengers would be waiting to receive him with taunts and drawn weapons

And his conscience told him that the taunts would be merited for he
had turned traitor he had failed in the only virtue on which his
fellow criminals prided themselves Yes he was a traitor and by the
only justice he acknowledged he deserved to die But the child who
had lain so trustingly upon his wild bosom who had clung to him as to
a fathershe was safe An unwonted smile crept under the bristling
beard of the fugitive as he urged the pony forward in unrelaxing
speed Should he seek refuge among civilized communities his crimes
would hang over his headif not discovered the fear of discovery
would be his day and night To venture into his old haunts in
NoMans Land would be to expose his back to the assassins knife or
his breast to ambushed murderers He dared not seek asylum among the
Indians for while bands of white men were safe enough in the
Territory single white men were at the mercy of the moments
capriceand certainly if found astride that Indian pony which the
agent had ordered restored to its owner his life would not be worth a
thought

These were desperate reflections and the future seemed framed in
solitude yet Brick Willock rode on with that odd smile about the grim
lips The smile was unlike himbut the whole affair was such an
experience as had never entered his most daring fancy Never before in
his life had he held a child in his arms still less had he felt the
sweet embrace of peaceful slumber To another man it might have meant
nothing but to this great rough fellow the very sight of whom had
often struck terror to the heart that experience seemed worth all the
privations he foresaw

The sun had risen when the pony after a few tottering steps suddenly
sank to earth Willock unfastened the halter from its neck tied it
with the lariat about his waist and without pause set out afoot If
the pony died from the terrible strain of that unremitting flight
doubtless the roving Indians of the plains would find it and try to
follow his trail if it survived he would be safer if not found near
it In either case swift flight was still imperative and the
shifting sand beaten out of shape by the constant wind promised not
to retain his footprints

Though stiff from long riding the change of motion soon brought
renewed vigor Willock had grown thirsty and as the sun rose higher
and beat down on him from an unclouded sky his eyes searched the
plains eagerly for some shelter that promised water He did not look
in vain Against the horizon rose the low blue shapes of the Wichita
Mountains looking at first like flat sheets of cardboard cut out by a
careless hand and set upright in the sand

As he toiled toward this refuge not a living form appeared to dispute
his sovereignty of the desert world His feet sank deep in the sand
then trod lightly over vast stretches of short sunburned mesquit then
again traversed hot shifting reaches of naked sand The mountains
seemed to recede as he advanced and at times stifling dust and
relentless heat threatened to overpower him With dogged determination
he told himself that he might be forced to drop from utter exhaustion
but it would not be yetnot yetone more mile or at least another
halfmile So he advanced growing weaker breathing with more
difficulty but still muttering Not yetnot just yet

The mountains had begun to spread apart There were long ranges and
short Here and there a form that had seemed an integral part of some
range defined itself as distinct from all others lying like an island
of rock in a sea of unbroken desert Willock was approaching the
Wichita Mountains from their southwestern extremity As far as he could
see in one direction the grotesque forms stretched in isolated chains
or single groups but in the other the end was reached and beyond lay
the unbroken waste of the Panhandle

Swaying on his great legs as with the weakness of an infant he was now
very near the end of the system A wall of granite sparsely dotted
with green rose above him to a height of about three hundred and fifty
feet The length of this range was perhaps six miles its thickness a
mile Concealed among these ridges he might be safe but it was no
longer possible for him to stand erect to climb the difficult ledges
would be impossible

He sank to the ground his eyes red and dimmed For some time he
remained there inert staring his brain refusing to work If yonder
stood a white object between him and the mountain a curious white
something with wheels might it not be a covered wagon No it was a
mirage But was it possible for a mirage to deceive him into the fancy
that a wagon stood only a few hundred feet away Perhaps it was really
a wagon He stared stupidly not moving There were no dreamhorses to
this ghostwagon There was no sign of life If captured by the
Indians it would not have been left intact But how came a wagon into
this barren world

He stared up at the sun as if to assure himself that he was awake then
laughed hoarsely foolishly The wagon did not melt away He could
crawl that far though in stretching forth his arm he might grasp but
empty air He began to crawl forward but the wagon did not move As
it grew plainer in all its details a new strength came to him He
strove to rise and after several efforts succeeded He staggered
forward till his hands grasped one of the wheels The contact cleared
his brain as by a magic touch It was no dream

Supporting himself by the sideboard he drew himself around to the
front the only opening of the canvas room He looked within A first
look told him that the wagon was fitted up for a long journey and that
its contents had not been disturbed by bandits or Indians The second
look distinguished two objects that excluded from attention all others
Upon a mattress at the rear of the wagon lay a woman her face covered
by a cloth and near the front seat stood a keg of water It was
impossible to note the rigid form of the woman and the position of the
arms and hands without perceiving that she was dead

The man recognized this truth but it made only a dim impression that
keg of water meant lifeand life was a thousandfold more to him than
death He drew himself upon the seat snatched at the tin cup beside
the keg and drew out the clothcovered corncob that stopped the flow
Having slaked his thirst there was mingled with his sense of ineffable
content an overwhelming desire for sleep He dropped on the second
mattress on which bedclothes were carelessly strewn his head found
the empty pillow that lay indented as it had been left by some vanished
sleeper As his eyelids closed he fell sound asleep But for the
rising and falling of his powerful breast he was as motionless as the
body of the woman

Without the afternoon sun slowly sank behind the mountains casting
long shadows over the plains the wind swirled the sand in tireless
eddies sometimes lifting it high in great sheets forming sudden
dunes coyotes prowled among the foothills and out on the open levels
squatting with eyes fixed on the wagon uttering sharp quick barks of
interrogation A herd of deer lifted their horns against the horizon
then suddenly bounded away racing like shadows toward the lowlands of
Red River On the domelike summit of Mount Welsh a mile away a
mountainlion showed his sinuous form against the sky seven hundred
feet in air And from the mountainside near at hand stared from among
the thick greenery of a cedar the face of an Indian whose black hair
was adorned by a single red feather

Within the wagon unconscious of all in strange fellowship lay the
living and the dead



CHAPTER IV

AN UNWONTED PRAYER

When Willock started up from the mattress in the covered wagon the sun
had set Every object however was clearly defined in the first glow
of the long August twilight and it needed but a glance to recall the
events that had brought him to seek shelter and slumber beside the dead
woman He sat up suddenly staring from under his long black hair as
it fell about his eyes Accustomed as he was to deeds of violence even
to the sight of men weltering in their lifes blood he was strangely
moved by that rigid form with the thin arms folded over the breast by
that white cloth concealing face and hair A long keen examination of
the prairie assured him that no human being was between him and the
horizon He turned again toward the woman He felt an overpowering
desire to look on her face

For years there had been no women in his world but the abandoned
creatures who sought shelter in the resorts of Beer City in NoMans
Landthese and the squaws of the reservations and occasionally a
white terrified face among the wagontrains As a boy before running
away from home in the Middle West he had known a different order of
beings and some instinct told him that this woman belonged to the
class of his childhoods association There was imperative need of his
hurrying to the mountain lest at any moment a roving band of Indians
discover the abandoned wagon besides this he was very hungry since
his rest and the wagon was stocked with provisions nevertheless to
look on the face of the dead was his absorbing desire

But it was not easy for him to yield to his curiosity despite his life
of crime Something about the majestic repose of that form seemed to
add awe to the mystery of sex and he crouched staring at the cloth
which no breath stirred save the breath of evening

He believed now the story that Henry Gledware had reiterated in
accents of abject terror Surely this was the last wagon in that
train which Red Kimball had attacked the morning before Impossible as
it had seemed to the highwaymen Gledware must have been warned of the
attack in time to turn about and lash his horses out of danger of
discovery At this spot Gledware had cut loose the horses mounted one
with his stepdaughter leaving the other to go at will This then
was the mother of that child whose arm had lain in warm confidence
about his neck On hands and knees Willock crept to the other mattress
and lifted the margin of the large white cloth

His hand moved stealthily slowly Catching sight of something that
faintly gleamed at the collar of the dress he hesitated his
determination to examine the countenance was as firm as ever but his
impulse to put it off as long as possible was even stronger He bent
down to look closer at the ornament it was a round breastpin of onyx
and pearl set in a heavy rim of gold The warm wind tempered by
approaching night to a grateful balminess stirred the cloth between
his fingers He stared as if lost in profound meditation That pin
resembled one his mother used to wear and somehow the soothing touch
of the wind reminded him of her hand on his forehead He might have
gone back home if she had not died long ago Now in spite of the
many years that had passed over her grave the memory of her came as
strong as sweet as instinct with the fullness of life as if he were
suddenly wafted back into boyhood

He did not lift the cloth after all but having replaced it gently he
searched the wagon for a spade It was found in the box fastened to the
end of the wagon and with the spade in the gathering darkness he dug
a grave near the mountainside Between the strokes of the blade he sent
searching glances over the prairie and along the sloping ridges of the
overlooking range but there were no witnesses of his work save the
coyotes that prowled like gray shadows across the sands When the
grave was ready he carried thither in his giants arms the body of the
woman on the mattress and laid it thus to rest When the sand was
smoothed over the place he carried thither quantities of heavy stones
and broken blocks of granite to preserve the body from wild beasts

It was dark when the heap of stones had been arranged in the form of a
low pyramid but though he had not tasted food for twentyfour hours
he lingered beside the grave his head bent as if still struggling with
those unwonted memories of the long ago At last as if forced by a
mysterious power against which he could no longer resist he sank upon
his knees

O God he prayed aloud take care of the little girl

He waited but no more words would comeno other thought He rose
feeling strangely elated as if some great good fortune had suddenly
come into his possession It had been like this when the sleeping
child lay in his arms he could almost feel her little cheek against
his bosom and hear the soft music of her breathing

He went back to the wagon and sat on the tongue still oblivious to any
possible danger of surprise He spoke aloud for company

She wouldnt have wanted me to look at hershe couldnt have looked
natural Glad I didnt Great Scott but that was a firstrate
prayer Wouldnt have thought after thirty years I could have done so
well And it was all there everything was in them words If she knew
what I was doing she couldnt have asked nothing more for I reckon
she wouldnt expect a man like ME to ask no favors for that
whitelivered cowardly secondhusband of hers I put in all my plea for
the little girl Dinged if I understand how I come to be so
intelligent and handy at whats all new business to me I just says
O God take care of the little girljust them words He rose with
an air of great content and went around to the front in search of
provisions Presently he spoke aloud

And as I aint asked nothing for myself since I run off from home I
guess God wont mind putting the little girl on my expenseaccount



CHAPTER V

A NEW ROBINSON CRUSOE

It came over him with disconcerting suddenness that he had lost a great
deal of time and that every moment spent in the covered wagon was
fraught with imminent danger It was not in his mind that the hand of
highwaymen might discover his hidingplace Knowing them as he did he
was sure they would not come so far from their haunts or from the Sante
Fe train in pursuit of him But the Indians roamed the Panhandle as
much at home there as in their reservationsand here they were much
more dangerous Had no savage eye discerned that wagon during the
brilliant August day Might it be that even while he slept at the feet
of the dead woman a feathered head had slipped under the canvas side
a red face had bent over him

It was a disquieting fancy Willock told himself that had such been
the case his scalplock would not still adorn his own person for all
that he was eager to be gone Instead of eating in the wagon he
wrapped up some food in a breadcloth placed this with a few other
articles in a tarpaulinamong them powder and shotand having
lifted the keg of water to one shoulder and the ropebound tarpaulin
to the other he left the wagon with a loaded gun in his hand

Twilight had faded to starlight and the mountain range stood blackly
defined against the glittering stars It was easy to find his way for
on the level sands there were no impediments and when the mountain was
reached a low divide offered him easy passage up the ascent For the
most part the slopes were gradual and in steeper places ledges of
granite somewhat like giant stairs assisted him to the highest ridge
From this vantagepoint he could see the level plain stretching away on
the farther side he could count the ridges running parallel to the one
on which he had paused and note the troughs between which never
descended to the level ground to deserve the name of valleys Looking
down upon this tortured mass of granite he seemed gazing over a
petrified sea that in the fury of a storm had been caught at the
highest dashing of its waves and fixed in threatening motion which
throughout the ages would remain as calm and secure as the level waste
that stretched from the abrupt walls in every direction

On that first ridge he paused but a moment lest his figure be outlined
against the night for the keen gaze of some hidden foe Steadying the
keg with one hand and holding his gun alert he descended into the
first trough and climbed to the next ridge meaning to traverse the
mile of broken surface thus setting a granite wall between him and the
telltale wagon The second ridge was not so high as the outer wall
and he paused here feeling more secure The ground was fairly level
for perhaps fifty yards before its descent to the next rolling
depression where the shadows lay in unrelieved gloom On the crest
about him the dim light defined broken boulders and great blocks of
granite in grotesque forms some suggesting fantastic monsters others
in sharpcut or rounded forms seemingly dressed by Cyclopean chisels

The fugitive was not interested in the dimly defined shapes about him
his attention had been attracted by a crevice in the smooth rock ledge
at his feet This ledge barren of vegetation and as level as a slab
of rough marble showed a long black line like a crack in a stone
pavement At the mans feet the crevice was perhaps two feet wide but
as it stretched toward the west it narrowed gradually and disappeared
under a mass of disorganized stones as a mere slit in the surface

Presently he set the keg and the tarpaulinball on the ground not to
rest his shoulders but in order to sink on his knees beside the
crevice He put his face down over it listening peering but making
no discovery Then he unwound the lariat from about his waist tied it
to the rope that had been a halter and having fastened a stone to one
end lowered it into the black space The length of the lariat slipped
through his fingers and the rope was following when suddenly the rock
found lodgment at the bottom On making this discovery he drew up the
lariat opened the cloth containing the food and began to eat rapidly
and with evident excitement He did not fail to watch on all sides as
he enjoyed his long delayed meal and while he ate and thus watched he
thought rapidly When the first cravings of appetite were partly
satisfied he left his bakers bread and bacon on a stone tied up the
rest of the food in its cloth rolled this in the tarpaulin and
lowered it by means of the lariat into the crevice Then having tied
the end of the rope to the gunbarrel he placed the gun across the
crevice and swung himself down into the gloom

The walls of the crevice were so close together that he was able to
steady his knees against them but as he neared the bottom they widened
perceptibly His first act on setting foot to the stone flooring was
to open the tarpaulin draw forth a candle and a box of matches and
strike a light The chamber of granite in which he stood was indeed
narrow but full of interest and romance The floor was about the same
width in all its length wide enough for Willock tall as he was to
stretch across the passage It extended perhaps a hundred feet into
the heart of the rock showing the same smooth walls on either side
The ceiling however was varied as the outward examination had
promised Overhead the stars were seen at ease through the two feet of
space at the top but as he carried his candle forward this opening
decreased to be succeeded presently by a roof at first of jumbled
stones crushed together by outward weight then of a smooth red surface
extending to the end

The floor was the same everywhere save at its extremities At the
point of Willocks descent it dipped away in a narrow line that would
not have admitted a mans body At the other end where he now stood
it suddenly gave way to empty space It came to an end so abruptly
that there was no means of discovering how deep was the narrow abyss
beyond Possibly it descended a sheer three hundred feet the depth of
the ridge at that place On the smooth floor which melted to
nothingness with such sinister and startling suddenness the
candlelight revealed the skeleton of a man lying at the margin of the
unknown depths Mingled with the bones that had fallen apart with the
passing of centuries was a drawn sword of blackened hilt and rusted
bladea sword of old Spanish makeand in the dust of a rotted purse
lay a small heap of gold coins of strange design

Well pard said Brick Willock grimly you come here first and much
obliged to you Youve told me two things that once in here no
getting outunless you bring along your ladder and whats better
still nobody has been here since you come or that wouldnt be my
money And now having told me all you got to say my cavalier I guess
wed better part He raked the bones into a heap and dashed them
into the black gulf He did not hear them when they struck bottom and
the sinister silence gave him an odd thrill He shook his head If I
ever roll out of bed here he said me and you will spend the rest of
the time together pardner

He did not linger for idle speculation but drew himself up his
dangling rope and in a short time was once more outside the place of
refuge Always on the lookout for possible watchers he snatched up
his bread and meat and ate as he hastened over the outer ridge and
down the rugged side toward the wagon Here he filled a box with
canned provisions and a side of bacon and on top of this he secured a
sack of flour It made a heavy burden but his long sleep had restored
him to his wonted strength and he could not be sure but this trip to
the wagon would be his last With some difficulty he hoisted the box
to his herculean shoulder and grasping a spade and an ax in his
disengaged hand toiled upward to his asylum

When the crevice in the mountaintop was reached he threw the contents
of the box down into the tarpaulin which he had spread out to receive
it and having broken up the box with the ax cast the boards down that
they might fall to one side of the provisions This done he returned
to the wagon from above invisible but which when he stood on the
plain loomed dim and shapeless against the night

There were great stores of comforts and even some luxuries in the
wagon and it was hard for him to decide what to take next evidently
Henry Gledware and his wife had expected to live in their wagon after
reaching their destination for there was a stove under the seat and a
stovepipe fastened to one side of the wagon

If the Indians dont catch me at this business said Willock looking
at the stove Ill get you too He believed it could be lowered
between the stone lips of his cavemouth for it was the smallest stove
he had ever seen surely less than two feet in width Ill get you
in said the plunderer decidedly or something will be broke

For the present however he took objects more appropriate to summer
the mattress upon which he had passed the afternoon a bucket in which
he packed boxes of matches a quantity of candles soap and the like
This bucket he put in the middle of the mattress and flanked it with
towels and pillows between which were inserted plates cups and
saucers Ill just take em all he muttered groping for more
dishes I might have company

The mattress once doubled over its illassorted contents he was
obliged to rope both ends before he could carry it in safety This
load heavier than the last he succeeded in getting to the crevice
and as he poised it over the brink a few yards from where the tarpaulin
lay he apostrophized it withBreak if you want to pieces is good
enough for your Uncle Brick

When he left the wagon with his next burden he was obliged to bend low
under buckets tools cans and larger objects As he moved slowly to
preserve equilibrium he began to chuckle Reckon if the Injuns saw
me now he said aloud theyd take me for an elephant with the
circuslady riding my back At the crevice he flung in all that
would pass the narrow opening intact and smashed up what was too
large that their fragments might also be hidden

Pshaw grunted Willock as he started back toward the wagon mopping
his brow on his shirtsleeve Robinson Crusoe wasnt in it Wonder
why he done all that complaining when he had a nice easy sea to wash
him and his plunder ashore

He was beginning to feel the weariness of the morning return and the
load that cleaned out the wagonbed left him so exhausted that he fell
down on the ground beside the crevice having thrown in his booty
Here with his gull at his side and a pistol in his hand he fell fast
asleep

He lay there like a man of stone until some inner consciousness began
beating at the door of his senses warning him that in no great time
the moon would rise He started up in a state of dazed bewilderment
staring at the solemn stars the vague outlines of giant rocks about
him and the limitless sea of darkness that flowed away from the
mountaintop indicating but not defining the surrounding prairie

Get up from here Willock commanded himself He obeyed rather
stiffly but when he was on his feet ax in hand he made the trip to
the wagon nimbly enough As he drew near he saw gray shadows slipping
awaythey were wolves He shouted at them disdainfully and without
pause began removing the canvas from over the wagon When that was
done his terrific blows resolved the wagonbed to separated boards
somewhat splintered but practically intact By means of the wrench he
removed the wheels and separated the parts of the wagonframe Always
when he had obtained enough for a load he made that toilsome journey
to his retreat He took the four wheels at one time rolling them one
by one lifting them singly from ledge to ledge

The last of his work was made easier because the darkness had begun to
lift Suddenly a glow appeared at the rim of the world to be
followed as it seemed almost immediately by the dazzling edge of an
immense silver shield The moon rolled over the desert waste and
rested like a solid wheel of fire on the sand Instantly for miles and
miles there was not a shadow on the earth The level shafts of light
bathed with grotesque luminous distinction the countless prairiedogs
which squatting before the mouths of their retreats barked at the
quick betrayal Coyotes as if taken by surprise swung swiftly toward
remote mountain fastnesses their backs to the light

When Willock made his last and slowest trip to the ridge his feet
dragging like lead there was nothing to show that a covered wagon had
stood at the edge of the prairie the splinters of the final demolition
had already mingled indistinguishably with the winddriven sand
Arrived at the second ridge which was still in darkness he took pains
that no telltale sign should be left on the smooth expanse of granite
to indicate the near presence of a man Swinging to the lariat that was
now tied to a short plank he lowered himself into the midst of the
debris with which that part of his floor was strewn Poised on top of
the heap of boards that had formed the sides of the wagon he pushed
upward with a longer plank and dislodged the one from which the rope
dangled It fell at his feet

Provided with nails a hammer and plenty of lumber it would not be
difficult to construct a ladder for egress At present he was too
tired to provide for the future He left the spoils just as they had
fallen except for the old wagontongue and a board or two with which
he built a barricade against the unknown depths at the farthest margin
of the floor Then drawing the mattress to one side and clearing it
of its contents he fell upon it with a sigh of comfort and was again
plunged into slumberslumber prolonged far into the following day



CHAPTER VI

A MYSTERIOUS GUEST

When he awoke a bar of sunshine which at first he mistook for an
outcropping of Spanish gold glowed against the granite wall of his
mountaintop retreat He rose in leisurely fashionhenceforth there
would be plenty of time years of it running to waste with useless
days After eating and partaking sparingly of the brackish water of
the keg he nailed together two long sideboards of the dismembered
wagon and having secured these end to end he fastened in parallel
strips to the surface short sticks as steps to his ladder This
finished he made a ropeladder The ladder of boards was for use in
leaving the cave the ropeladder which he meant to hide under some
boulder near the crevice could be used in making the descent

The formless mass of inchoate debris the result of his toilsome
journeys of the night before was left as it had fallenthere would be
time enough to sort all that a hundred times At present he would
venture forth with the sole object of examining his surroundings
This suits me exactly he muttered with a goodhumored chuckle
just doing one thing at a time and being everlasting slow about doing
that

Fastening the ropeladder about his waist he scaled the boards and on
reaching the top cast them down First he looked all about but no
living creature was in sight This is just to my hand he said
aloud seeking a suitable hidingplace for the ropeladder I always
did despise company

Stowing away the ropeladder in a secure fissure between two giant
blocks of granite each the size of a large twostory house he crossed
to the first ridge and looked out over the prairie to triumph over
the vacant spot where the covered wagon had stood fifteen hours before
No telling what a man can do he exclaimed admiringly that is to
say if his name is Brick Willock

His eyes wandered to the mound of stones built over the womans grave
His prayer recurred to his mind Well God he said looking up at
the cloudless sky I guess youre doing it After this expression of
faith he turned about and set forth to traverse the mountain range
Passing the ridge which he already looked upon as home he crossed
other ridges of varying height and at the end of a mile reached the
southern limit of the mountain Like the northern side the southern
elevation was nearly four hundred feet as if the granite sea had
dashed upward in fiercest waves in a last futile attempt to inundate
the plain The southern wall was precipitous and Willock looking
down the cedarstudded declivity could gaze directly on the verdant
levels that came to the very foot

He stood at the center of an enormous horseshoe formed on the southwest
by the range curving farther toward the south and on his left hand by
the same range sweeping in a quartercircle toward the southeast The
mouth of this granite halfcircle was opened to the south at least a
quartermile in width but on his left a jutting spur almost at right
angles to the main range and some hundreds of yards closer to his
position shot across the space within the horseshoe bend in such
fashion that an observer standing on the plain would have half his
view of the inner concave expanse shut off except that part of the
high north wall that towered above the spur

Nor was this all Behind the perpendicular arm or spur that ran out
into the sea of mesquit rose a low hill that was itself in the nature
of an inner spur although since it failed to reach the mountain it
might be regarded as a long flat island surrounded by the calm green
tide This innermost arm or island was so near the mountain that
the entrance to it opened into a curved inner world of green was
narrow and strongly protected The cove thus formed presented a level
floor of ten or twelve acres and it was directly down into this cove
that Willock gazed It looked so peaceful and secure and its openness
to the sunshine was so alluring that Willock resolved to descend the
steep wall To do so at that point was impractical but the ridge was
unequal and not far to the right sank to a low divide while to the
left a deep gully thickly set with cedars elms scruboaks and thorn
trees invited him with its steep but not difficult channel to the
ground

Heres a choice observed Willock as he turned toward the divide
guess Ill go by the front and save the back stairs for an
emergency The gully was his back stairs He was beginning to feel
himself rich in architectural possibilities When he reached the plain
he was outside of a line of hummocks that effectually hid the cove from
sight more effectually because of a dense grove of pecans that stood
on either side of the grassgrown dunes Instead of crossing the
barrier he started due south for the outer prairie and when at last
he stood midway between the wide jaws of the mountain horseshoe he
turned and looked intently toward the cove

It was invisible and his highest hopes were realized From this
extended mouth he could clearly see where the first spur shot out into
the sand and beyond that he could see how at a distance the sheer
wall of granite rose to the sky but there was nothing to suggest that
behind that scarred arm another projection parallel to it might be
discovered He walked toward the spur always watching for a possible
glimpse of the cove When he stood on the inner side his spirits rose
higher The long flat island that he had discerned from the
mountaintop was here not to be defined because on account of its
lowness and of the abrupt wall beyond it was mingled indistinguishably
with the perspective of the range Concealment was made easier from the
fact that the ground of the cove was lower than all the surrounding
land

Willock now advanced on the cove and found himself presently in a snug
retreat that would have filled with delight the heart of the most
desperate highwayman or the most timid settler On the north was of
course the towering mountainwall broken by the gully in the
protection of whose trees one might creep up or down without detection
On the east the same mountainwall curved in high protection In
front was the wide irregular island low indeed but happily high
enough to shut out a view of the outside world At the end of this
barricade there was a gap no wider than a wagonroad along the side
of which ran the dry channel of a mountain streamthe continuation of
the gully that cut the mountainwall from top to basebut even this
gap was high enough to prevent observation from the plain

No horsemen could enter the cove save by means of that low trench cut
as by the hand of man in the granite hill and as Indian horsemen were
the only enemies to be dreaded his watchfulness need be concentrated
only on that one point Nothing like variety observed Willock
cheerfully

This will do capital for my summer home Im going to live like a
lordwhile Im living

He examined the ground and found that it was rich and could be
penetrated easily even to the very foot of the mountain Ill just
get my spade he remarked as I aint got nothing else to do In
deliberate slowness he returned up the divide and got the spade from
his retreat then brought it to the cove Selecting a spot near the
channel of the driedup torrent he began to dig relieved to find that
he did not strike rock

I guess he said stopping to lean on his spade as he stared at the
mountain the earth just got too full of granite and biled over but
was keerful to spew it upwards sos to save as much ground as it
could while relieving its feelings

Presently the earth on his blade began to cling from dampness When I
digs a well he remarked boastingly what I want is water and thats
what I gets As soon as its deep enough Ill wall her up with rocks
and take the longest drink that man ever pulled off that is to say
when it was nothing but common water They aint nothing about water
to incite you to keep swallowing when you have enough Of a sudden you
just naturally leggo and could drown in it without wanting another
drop Thats because its nature Art is different I reckon a nice
clean drinkingjoint and a fullstocked bar is about the highest art
that can stimulate a man But in nature you know when youve got
enough

After further digging he added And I got about enough of THIS I mean
the mountains and the plains and the sand and the wind and the cave and
the cove he wiped away the dripping sweat and looked at the sun
Yes and of you too He dropped the spade and sat down on the heap
of dirt Oh Lord but Im lonesome I got plenty to say but nobody
to listen at me

He clasped his great hands about his knee and stared sullenly at the
surrounding ramparts of red and brown granite dully noting the
fantastic layers the huge round stones that for ages had been about to
roll down into the valley but had never started and others cut in odd
shapes placed one upon another in columns along the perpendicular wall
The sun beat on the long matted hair of his bared head but the
ceaseless wind brought relief from its pelting rays He however was
conscious neither of the heat nor of the refreshing touch

At last he rose slowly to his towering legs and picked up the spade
Youre a fool Brick Willock he said harshly Aint you got that
well to dig And then cant you go for your kaig and bring it here
and carry it back full of fresh water Dinged if there aint enough
doings in your world to furnish out a daily newspaper He began to
dig adding in an altered tone And Brick HE saysNothing aint
come to the worst as long as youre living says Brick

He was proud of the well when it was completed the water was cold and
soft as it oozed up through clean sand and the walls of mudmortised
rocks promised permanency One did not have to penetrate far into the
bottomlands of that cove to find water which for unnumbered years had
rushed down the mountainside in time of rainstorms to lie a vast
underground reservoir for the coming of man Willock could reach the
surface of the well by lying on his stomach and scooping with his long
arm He duly carried out his program and when the keg was filled with
fresh water it was time for dinner

After a cold luncheon of sliced boiled ham and bakers bread he
returned to the cove where he idled away the afternoon under the shade
of tall cedar trees whose branches came down to the ground forming
impenetrable pyramids of green

Stretched out on the short buffalograss he watched the white flecks
follow one another across the sky he observed the shadows lengthening
from the base of the western arm of the horseshoe till they threatened
to swallow up him and his bright speck of world he looked languidly
after the flights of birds and grinned as he saw the hawks dart into
round holes in the granite wall not much larger than their
bodiesthose mysterious holes perforating the precipice seemingly
bored there by a giant auger

Go to bed pards he called to the hawks I reckon its time for
me too He got upthe sun had disappeared behind the mountain He
stretched himself lifting his arms high above his head and slowly
drawing his fists to his shoulder his elbows luxuriously crooked
One thing I got he observed is room plenty Well he started
toward the divide for his upward climb Ive lived a reasonable long
life I am fortyfive but I do think that since I laid down under that
tree I have thought of everything I ever done or said since I was a
kid Guess Ill save the future for another afternoonand after that
the Lord knows what Im going to do with my brain its that busy

The next day he began assorting the contents of his granite home
moving to the task with conscientious slowness stopping a dozen times
to make excursions into the outside world By diligent economy of his
working moments he succeeded in covering almost two weeks in the labor
of putting his house into order His bedroom was next to the barricade
that separated the long stone excavation from the bottomless abyss
Divided from the bedroom by an imaginary line was the storeroom of
provisions The cans and boxes were arranged along the floor with
methodical exactitude Different varieties of fruit and preserves were
interspersed in such fashion that none was repeated until every variety
had been passed

I begins with this can of peaches said Willock laying his finger
upon the beginning of the rowthen comes apples pears plums then
peaches apples pears plums then peaches apples pears plums then
peachesblest if I dont feel myself getting sick of em already
And now my meats bacon ham My breadstuffs loaves crackers My
fillers sardines more sardines more sardines likewise canned
tomatoes Let me seeis it too much to say that I eats a can of
preserves in two days Maybe three That is till I sickens I
begins with peachday This is Monday Say Thursday begins my
appledays I judge I can worm myself down through the list by this
time next month One thing I am sot on not to save nothing if I can
bring my stomach to carry the burden with a willing hand Ill eat
mild and calm but steadfast Brick Willock he says Better starve
all at once when theres nothing left than starve a little every
day says Brick When its a matter of agony says he take the
short cut

In arranging his retreat he had left undisturbed the wagontongue
since removing it from the end of the floor for a more secure
barricade it had stood with several of the sideboards against the
wall as if Brick meditated using them for a special purpose Such was
indeed his plan and it added some zest to his present employment to
think of what he meant to do next this was nothing less than to make a
dugout in the cove

To this enterprise he was prompted not only by a desire to vary his
monotonous days but to insure safety from possible foes Should a
skulking savage or what would be worse a stray member of the robber
band catch sight of him among the hills the spy would spread the news
among his fellows A relentless search would be instituted and even
if Willock succeeded in escaping the band would not rest till it had
discovered his hidingplace If they came on the dugout their search
would terminate and his home in the crevice would escape
investigation but if there was no dugout to satisfy curiosity the
crevice would most probably be explored

Two homes aint too many for a character like me nohow remarked
Brick as he set the wagontongue and long boards on end to be drawn up
through the crevice Cold weather will be coming on in due timesay
three or four monthsand whats that to me a mere handful of time
Well I dont never expect to make a fire in my cave Ill set my smoke
out in the open where it can be traced without danger to my pantry
shelves

He was even slower about building the dugout than he had been in
arranging the miscellaneous objects in the cavern on top of the
mountain Transporting the timbers across a mile of ridges and granite
troughs was no light work and when his tools and material were in the
cove the digging of the dugout was protracted because of the closeness
of water to the surface At last he succeeded in excavating the cellar
at a spot within a few yards of the mountain without penetrating
moistened sand He leveled down the walls till he had a chamber about
twelve feet square Over this he placed the wagontongue converting
it into the ridgepole which he set upon forks cut from the nearby
cedars Having trimmed branches of the trees in the grove he laid
them as close together as possible slanting from the ridgepole to the
ground and over these laid the bushy cedar branches This substantial
roof he next covered with dirt heaping it up till no glimpse of wood
was visible tinder the hardpacked dome The end of the dugout was
closed up in the same way except for a hole near the top fitted closely
to the stovepipe and packed with mud

Of the sideboards he fashioned a rude frame then a door to stand in
it fitted into grooves that it might be pushed and held into place
without hinges Of course I got to take down my door every time I
comes in or out remarked Willock regarding his structure with much
complacency but theys nothing else to do and I got to be occupied

When he had transported the stove to the cove he set it up with a
tingle of expectant pleasure It was to be his day of housewarming
not because the weather had grown cold but that he might celebrate

This here he said is to be a redletter day a day plumb up in X
Y and Z I got to take my gun and forage for some game then Ill
dress my fresh meat and have a cooking Ill bring over some grub to
keep it company Lets seethis is plumday aint it He stood
meditating stroking his wild whiskers with a grimy hand Oh Lord
yes I believe it IS plumday Well they aint nothing the way you
would have made it yourself says Brick not even though its you as
made it This here is plumday and that there can of plums will
shore be opened And having my first fire gives me a chance to open up
my sack of flour wont I hold carnival What I feels sorry about
myself is knowing how Im going to feel after Ive et all them
victuals I believe Ill take a bath too in that pool over yonder in
the grove Aint I ever going to use that there soap But I dont
say as I will Dont seem wuth while They aint nobody to see me
and I feels clean insides As I takes it you do your washing for them
as neighbors with you If I had a neighborjust a dog a little
yaller dogor some chickens to crow and cackle

He broke off to lean despondently on his gun He remained thus
motionless for a long time his earthstained garments unkempt hair
hard dark hands and gloomy eye marking him as the only object in the
bright sunshine standing forth unresponsive to natures smile

He started into life with a shrug of his powerful shoulders Its
just like you Brick to spoil a festibulday with your low idees Why
dont you keep them idees for a rainy day Just lay up them regrets
and hankerings for the first rainy day and then be of a piece with the
heavens and earth If you cant stay cheerful while the suns
shining says Brick Gods wasting a mighty nice big sun on YOU

Thus admonishing himself and striving desperately for contentment he
strode forth from the only exit of the cove and skirted the southern
wall of the range looking for game It was late in the afternoon when
he returned with the best portions of a deer swung over his shoulder
By this time he was desperately hungry and the prospect of the first
venison since his exile stirred his pulses and gave to the bright
scene a cheerful beauty it had not before worn to his homesick heart
He trudged up to the narrow door of the dugout which was closed just
as he had left it and having carried a noble haunch of venison to the
pool to be washed he descended the dirt steps and set the door to one
side Without at first understanding why he became instantly aware
that some one had been there during his absence

Of course as soon as his eyes could penetrate the semigloom
sufficiently to distinguish small objects he saw the proof but even
before that the air seemed tingling with some strange personality He
stood like a statue gazing fixedly His alert eyes always on guard
had assured him that the cove was desertedthere was no use to look
behind him Whoever had been there must have scaled the mountain and
had either crossed to the plain on the north or was hiding behind the
rocks What held his eyes to the stove was a heap of tobacco and a
clay pipe beside it Among the stores removed from the wagon tobacco
had been found in generous quantity but during the month now elapsed
bad been sadly reduced Willock however was not pleased to find the
new supply on the contrary his emotions were confused and alarmed
Had the tobacco been ten times as much it could not have solaced him
for the knowledge that the dugout had been visited

After a few minutes of immobility he entered placed the meat on a
box and departed softly closing the door behind him Casting
apprehensive glances along the mountainside he stole toward it and
made his way up the gully completely hidden by the straggling line of
trees and underbrush till he stood on the summit He approached each
ridge with extreme caution as if about to storm the barricade of an
enemy thus he traveled over the range without coming on the traces of
his mysterious visitor Not pausing at the crevice he went on to the
outer northern ridge of the range and lying flat among some high
rocks looked down

He counted seventeen men near the spot from which he had removed the
wagon Fifteen were on horseback and two riderless horses explained
the presence of the two on foot All of them had drawn up in a circle
about the heap of stones that covered the womans burialplace Of the
seventeen sixteen were Indians painted and adorned for the warpath
The remaining man he who stood at the heap of stones beside the chief
was a white man and at the first glance Willock recognized him he
was the dead womans husband Henry Gledware

Bricks mind was perplexed with vain questionings Was it Gledware who
had visited his dugout or the Indians Did the pipe and tobacco
indicate a peaceoffering What was the relationship between Gledware
and these Indians Was he their prisoner and were they about to burn
him upon the heap of stones He did not seem alarmed Had he made
friends with the chief by promising to conduct him to the deserted
wagon If so what would they think in regard to the wagons
disappearance Had the dugout persuaded them that there was no other
retreat in the mountains

While Brick watched in agitated suspense several Indians leaped to the
ground at a signal from the chief and advanced toward the white man
The chief turned his back upon the company and started toward the
mountain his face turned toward Bricks place of observation He began
climbing upward the red feather in his hair gleaming against the green
of the cedars Brick had but to remain where he was to reach forth
his hand presently and seize the warriorbut in that case those on
the plain would come swarming up the ascent for vengeance

Brick darted from his post swept like a dipping swallow across the
ravine and snatching up the ropeladder from its nook under the
boulder scurried down into the granite chamber Having removed the
ladder he crept to the extremity of the excavation and with his back
against the wall and his gun held in readiness awaited the coming of
the chief After the lapse of many minutes he grew reassured the
Indian thinking the dugout his only home had passed the crevice
without the slightest suspicion

However lest in thrusting forth his head he call attention to his
home in the rock he kept in retreat the rest of that day nor did he
venture forth that night After all the housewarming did not take
place The stove remained cold the tobacco and pipe upon it were
undisturbed and the evening meal consisted notably of plums



CHAPTER VII

RED FEATHER

One bright warm afternoon in October two years later Brick Willock sat
smoking his pipe before the open door of his dugout taking advantage
of the mountainshadow that had just reached that spot In repose he
always sat when in the cove with his face toward the natural roadway
leading over the flat hillisland into the farther reach of the
horseshoe It was thus he hoped to prevent surprise from inimical
horsemen and it was thus that on this particular afternoon he
detected a shadow creeping over the reddishbrown stone passage before
its producing cause rode suddenly against the background of the blue
sky

At first glimpse of that shadow of a feathered head Willock flung
himself down the dirt steps leading to the open door now lying flat
he directed the barrel of his gun over the edge of the level ground
covering an approaching horseman As only one Indian came into view
and as this Indian was armed in a manner as astounding as it was
irresistible Willock rose to his height of sixfootthree lowered his
weapon and advanced to meet him

When he was near the Indianthe same chief from whom Willock had fled
on the day of his intended housewarmingthis Indian sprang lightly to
the ground and lifted from the horse that defense which he had borne
in front of him on penetrating the cove it was the child for whose
sake Willock had separated himself from his kind

At first Willock thought he was dreaming one of those dreams that had
solaced his halfwaking hours for he had often imagined how it would
be if that child were in the mountains to bear him company But however
doubtful he might he regarding her he took no chances about the
Indian but kept his alert gaze fixed on him to forestall any design of
treachery

The Indian made a sign to the little girl to remain with the horse
then he glided forward holding somewhat ostentatiously a filled pipe
in his extended hand He had evidently come to knit his soul to that
of his white brother while the smoke from their pipes mingled on the
quiet air forming a frail and uncertain monument to the spirit of
peace

Was it you that left a pipe and tobacco on my stove two years ago
Willock asked abruptly

Yes You got it We will smoke He seated himself gravely on the
ground

Willock went into the cabin and brought out the clay pipe They
smoked Willock cast covert glances toward the girl She stood slim
and straight her face rigid her eyes fixed on the horse whose halter
she held Her limbs were bare and a blanket that descended to her
knees seemed her only garment The face of the sleeping child of five
was the same however as this of the sevenyearold maid except that
it had grown more beautiful the wealth of glowing brown hair made
amends for all poverty of attire

Willock was wonderfully moved so much so that his manner was harsh
his voice gruff in the extreme What are you going to do with that
girl he demanded

You take her inquired the chief passively

YesI take her

Good The Indian smoked serenely

Whered you find her

Not been lost Her safe all time Sometime in one villagehere
then there two threemove her about Safe all time I never
forget There she is You take her

I said so didnt I Wheres her daddy

The Indian said nothing only smoked his eyes fixed on space

Willock raised his voice Must I ask HER where he is

Her not know Her not seen him one two year She say him dead

Oh hes dead is he

Him safe too He looked at the sun Long trail before me Then I
leave her I go now

Not much you dont go Not THIS minute Where is that girls daddy

No answer

If hes safe why hasnt she been with him all this time

Me big chief

Oh yes I judge you are But thats nothing to me Im big chief
too I own this corner of the universeand I want to know about that
girls daddy

Him great man

Wellgo ahead tell the rest of it

Him settle among my tribe him never leave our country Big country
fat country very rich Him change nameeverything him one of us
Marry my daughter THAT girl not his daughterdaughter of dead woman
Keep her away from him all time so him never see white man white
woman white child forget white people be good Indian The girl make
him think of dead woman When a man marry again not good to remember
dead woman Him think girl dead but no care no worry no sad SHE
never his daughterdead womans daughter All his path is white no
more blue Him very glad every daymy daughter his wife She keep
scalpknife from his head My braves capturethey dance about fire
she say No She marry him Their path is white the sky over them
is white

He rose straight as an arrow and turned his grim face toward the
horse

I see And you dont want to tell me where he is because you want
him to forget he is a white man

Him always live with my people him marry my daughter

Tell me this is he far away

Very far Many days You never find him You stay here keep girl
and me and my people your friends You come after himnot your
friends

Why bless your heart I never want to see that man again your
daughter is welcome to him but Im afraid shes got a bad bargain
This girls just as Id have herunencumbered Im AWFUL glad you
come pardner Whenever you happen to be down in this part of Texas
drop in and make us a visit

With every passing moment Willock was realizing more keenly what this
amazing sequel to the past meant to him He would not only have
company in his dreary solitude but of all company the very one he
yearned for to comfort his heart Give us your paw old manshake
You bet Ill take her

He strode forward and addressed the girl Are you willing to stay
with me little one

She shrank back from the wild figure During his two years of hiding
in the mountains Willock had cared nothing for his personal
appearance His garments on disintegrating had been replaced by
skins thus giving an aspect of assorted colors and materials rather
remarkable Only when driven by necessity had he ventured on long
journeys to the nearest foodstation carrying the skins obtained by
trapping and bringing back fresh stores of provisions and tobacco on
the pony purchased by the Spanish gold

Willock was greatly disconcerted by her attitude He said regretfully
I guess Ive been so much with myself that I aint noticed my outside
as a man ought Wont you make your home with me child He held out
his rough hand appealingly

She retreated farther saying with disapproval Much hair

Willock laid his hand on his breast returning Much heart

Him white said the Indian swinging himself upon his horse Him
save your life Sometime me come visit come eat come stay with you

As he wheeled about she held out her arms toward him crying wildly
Dont go Dont leave me Him much hair

The Indian dashed away without turning his head

Good lord honey exclaimed Willock at his wits ends dont cry
I cant do nothing if you CRY Wont you come look at your new home
He waved eagerly toward the dugout

Hole in the ground cried the girl desperately I want my tepee Am
I a prairiedog

No honey you aint You and me is both white and we ought to live
together it aint right for you to live with red people that kills and
burns your own kith and kin

She looked at him repellently through her streaming tears Big hair
she cried Big hair

And must I cut it off Ill make my head as smooth as yonder
baldheaded mountainpeak if itll keep you from crying Course you
aint seen nobody with whiskers amongst them Indians but THEY aint
your people Your people is white they are like me they grows hair
But Ill shave and paint myself red and hunt for feathers if thats
what you want

Her sobbing grew less violent Despite his ferocious aspect no fear
could remain in her heart at sight of that distressed countenance at
sound of those conciliatory tones Willock observing that the tempest
was abating continued in his most appealing manner

Im going to do whatever you say honey and youre going to be the
queen of the cove Aint you never been lonesome amongst all them red
devils Aint you missed your poor mammy as died crossing the plains
It was me that buried her Aint you never knowed how it felt to want
to lay your head on somebodys shoulder and slip your little arms about
his neck and go to sleep like an angel whatever was happening around
I guess SO Well thats me too Here Ive been for two long year
never seeing nothing but wild animals or prowling savages till the last
few months when a settler comes to them mountains seven mile to the
southwest Looked like Id die sometimes just having myself to
entertain

You lonesome too said the girl looking up incredulously She drew
a step nearer a wistful light in her dark eyes

The man stretched out his arms and dropped them to his side heavily
Like that he criedjust emptiness

I stay she said simply All time want my own people all time
Red Feather say some day take me to white peoplewant to go all time
But Red Feather never tell me BIG HAIR Didnt know what it was I
was looking fornever thought it would be something like you

But you aint afraid now are you little one

She shook her head and drawing nearer seated herself on the ground
before the dugout You LOOK Big Hair she explained sedately but
your speech is talk of weak squaw

Somewhat disconcerted by these words Willock sat down opposite her
and resumed his pipe as if to assert his sex I seem weak to you he
explained because I love you child and want to make friends with
you But let me meet a big manwell youd see then He looked so
ferocious as he uttered these words that she started up like a
frightened quail grasping her blanket about her

No no honey he cooed abjectly I wouldnt hurt a fly Me I was
always a byword amongst my pards Theyd say There goes Brick
Willock what never harmed nobody When they kept me in at school I
never clumb out the window and it was me got all the prize cards at
Sundayschool How comes it honey that you aint forgot to talk like
civilized beings

Red Feather him always put me with squaw that know Englishthat been
to school on the reservation Never let me learn talk like the
Indians Him always say some day take me to my own people But never
said BIG HAIR

Did he tell you your mother died two years ago

Yesfather him dead too Both died in the plains Father was shot
by robbers Mother was left in big wagonyou bury her near this
mountain

Oh ho So your father was killed at the same time your mother was
eh

Yes

Wellall right And now you got nobody but me to look after youbut
you dont need no more as long as Im able to be up and about nothing
is going to hurt you Just you tell me what you want and itll be
did

Want to be ALL like white people want to be just like mother

Well Ill teach you as fur up as Ive been myself Your style of
talk aint correct but it was the best Red Feather could do by you
Him and you lay down your words like steppingstones for your thoughts
to step over but just listen at me how smooth and finetextured my
language is with no breaks or crevices from the beginning of my
periods to where my voice steps down to start on a lower ledge Thats
the way white people talks not that they got more to say than Injuns
but they fills in and embodies everything like filling up cabinwalls
with mud Ill take you by the hand right from where Red Feather left
you and carry you up the heights

She examined him dubiously You know how

I aint no bellwether in the paths of learning honey but Red
Feather is some miles behind me Whats your name

Lahoma

Born that way or Injunized

Father before he died him all time want to go settle in the Oklahoma
countrysettle on a claim with mother They go there two
timesthreebut soldiers all time make them go back to Kansas So me
I was born and they named me Oklahomabut all time they call me
Lahoma That I must be called Lahoma because that father and mother
all time call me Lahoma that my name She inquired anxiously You
call me Lahoma She leaned forward hands upon knees in breathless
anxiety

You bet your life I will Lahoma

Then me stay all time with youall time And you teach me talk
right and dress right and be like mother and my white people You
teach me all that

Thats the program Im going to civilize youthat means to make you
like white folks Its going to take time but the mountains is full
of time

You civilize me right now You begin today She started up and
stood erect with arms folded evidently waiting for treatment

The process will be going on all the while youre associating with me
honey That chief Red Featherhe has a daughter hasnt he

No him say no girl no boy She spoke with confidence

I see And your fathers dead too eh Evidently Red Feather had
thoroughly convinced her of the truth of these pretenses

Bothmother father Nobody but me She knelt down at his side
her face troubled If I had just one

Can you remember either of them

Oh yes yesand Red Feather him talk about them talk talk always
say me be white with the white people some day This is the day You
make me like mother was You civilize mebegin She regarded him
with dignified attention her little hands locked about her blanket
where it lay folded below her knees The cloud had vanished from her
face and her eyes sparkled with expectancy

I aint got the tools yet honey Theys no breaking up and enriching
land that aint never bore nothing but buffalograss without I have
picks and spades and plows and harrers I got to get my tools to
begin

She stiffened herself You neednt be afraid Ill cry I WANT you to
hurt me if that the way

It aint like a pain in the stomach Lahoma All I gets for you will
be some books Them is the tools Im going to operate with

Books What are books

Books Willock rubbed his bushy head in desperation Books Why
they is just thoughts that somebody has ketched and put in a cage where
they cant get away You go and look at them thoughts somebody capable
has give rise to and when you finds them as has never ranged in your
own brain you captures em puts your brand on em and serves em out
in your own herd You see Lahoma what you think in your own brain
aint of no service for YOU dont know nothing If you want to be
civilized you got to lasso other peoples thoughtspeople as has went
to and fro and has learned lifeand you got to dehorn them ideas and
tame em

Lahoma examined him with new interest Are YOU civilized Her
countenance fell

Not to no wide extent but I can ford tolerble deep streams that
would drown you honey Just put confidence in me and when I get over
my head Ill holler for help I judge I can put five good years work
on you without exhausting my stores I can read amongst the small
words pretty peartthe young calves so to sayand lots of them big
steers in three or four syllablesI can sort o guess at their
roadbrands from the company Ive saw em traveling with in times
past And I can write my own name and yours too I reckonLahoma
Gledwareyes Im tolerble well versed on a capital Gyou just
make a gap with a flying tail to it

My name NOT Lahoma Gledware she interposed in some severity My
name Lahoma Willock Beautiful namelovely like flowerWillock
call me Lahoma Willocklike song of little stream Gledware
hardrough

Brick Willock stared at her in amazement Whered you get that from

My name Lahoma WillockRed Feather tell me

He smoked in silence puffing rapidly ThenMy name is Brick
Willock How came you to be named Lahoma Willock

Lahoma suggested thoughtfullyAll white people named Willock

Theres a few Willock shook his head with less agreeable names
But after all Im glad you have my name Yesthe more I think on it
the more pleased I get I reckon were sort of kinfolks anyhow Well
honey this is enough talk about being civilized now lets make the
first move on the way You want to see your mothers grave and lay
some of these wild flowers on it Thats a part of being civilized
caring for graves is Its just savages as forgets the past and
consequently never learns nothing Come along Them moccasins will do
famous until I can get you shoes from the settlements Its seventy
mile to Vernon Texas and none too easy miles But I got a pony the
first time I ventured to Doans store and itll carry you if I have
to walk at your side Well make a festibul march of that journey and
lay in clothes as a girl should wear and books to last through the
winter

Willock rose and explained that they must cross the mountain As they
traversed it he reminded her that she had not gathered any of the
flowers that were scattered under sheltering boulders

Why asked Lahoma showing that her neglect to do so was intentional

Well honey dont you love and honor that mother that bore so much
pain and trouble for you traveling with you in her arms to the
Oklahoma country trying to make a home for you up there in the
wilderness and at last dying from the hardships of the plains Aint
she worth a few flowers

She dead She not see flowers not smell flowers not know

Willock said nothing but the next time they came to a clump of
blossoms he made a nosegay Lahoma watched him with a face as calm and
unemotional as that of Red Feather himself She held her back with
the erect grace and moved her limbs with the swift ease of those among
whom she had passed the last two years In delightful harmony with
this air of wildness was the rich and delicate beauty of her
sunbrowned face and the golden glow of her silken brown hair
Willocks heart yearned toward her as only the heart of one destined to
profound loneliness can yearn toward the exquisite grace and
unconscious charm of a child but to the degree that he felt this
attraction he held himself firmly aloof knowing that wild animals are
frightened when kindness beams without its veil

What you do with that She pointed at the flowers in his rough hand

Im going to put em on your mothers grave

She not know Not see not smell She dead mother dead

Lahoma do you know anything about God

YesGreat Spirit God make my path white

Well I want God to know that somebody remembers your mother Its
God that smells the flowers on the graves of the dead

They walked on Pretty soon Lahoma began looking about for flowers
but they had reached the last barren ledge and no more came in sight

Take these Lahoma

No Couldnt fool God They began the last descent Willock
suddenly discovered that tears were slipping down the girls face He
said nothing he did not fear now for he thought the tears promised a
brighter dawning

Suddenly Lahoma cried joyfully Oh look Brick look And she
darted toward the spot at the foot of a tall cedar where purple and
white blossoms showed in profusion She gathered an armful and they
went down to the plain

Her heads toward the west he said as they stood beside the pile of
stones Lahoma placed the flowers at the Western margin of the
pyramid Willock laid his at the foot of the grave The sun had set
and the warmth of the heated sand was tempered by a fragrant breeze
Though late in October he felt as if spring were just dawning He
took Lahomas hand and his heart throbbed to find that she showed no
disposition to draw away

He looked up with a great sigh of thanksgiving Well God he said
softly here she isYou sure done it



CHAPTER VIII

GETTING CIVILIZED

During the two years passed by Brick Willock in dreary solitude
conditions about him had changed The hardships of pioneer life which
fifty years ago had obtained in the Middle States yet prevailed in
1882 in the tract of land claimed by Texas under the name of Greer
County but the dangers of pioneer life were greatly lessened As
Lahoma made the acquaintance of the mountainrange and explored the
plain extending beyond the natural horseshoe Willock believed she ran
little danger from Indians He himself had ceased to preserve his
unrelaxing watchfulness after all it had been the highwaymen rather
than the red men whom he had most fearedand after two years it did
not seem likely that such volatile men would pre serve the feeling of
vengeance

With the wisdom derived from his experience with wild natures he
carefully abstained from any attempt to force Lahomas friendship
hence it was not long before he obtained it without reserve As she
walked beside him grave and alert she no longer thought of his bushy
beard and prodigious mop of harsh hair and the daily exhibition of his
strength caused him to grow handsome in her eyes because most of those
feats were performed for her comfort or pleasure In the meantime he
talked incessantly and to his admiration he presently found her
manner of speech wonderfully like his own both fluent and
ungrammatical

He knew nothing of grammar to be sure but there were times when his
mistakes echoed from her lips struck upon his ear and though he
might not always know how to correct them he was prompt to suggest
changes testing each as a natural musician judges music by ear
Dissatisfied with his own standards he was all the more impatient to
depart on the expedition after mental tools despite the dangers that
might beset the journey

His first task prompted by the coming of Lahoma had been to partition
off the half of the dugout containing the stove for the childs private
chamber Cedar posts set in the ground and plastered with mud higher
than his head left a space between the top and the apex of the ceiling
that the temperature might be equalized in both rooms Thus far
however they did not stay in the dugout except long enough to eat and
sleep for the autumn had continued delightful and the cove seemed to
the child her home of which the dugout was a sort of cellar
Concerning the stone retreat in the crevice she knew nothing Willock
did not know why he kept the secret since he trusted Lahoma with all
his treasures but the unreasoning reticence of the man of great
loneliness still rested on him Some day he would tellbut not just
yet

Lahoma he said one day theres a settler over yonder in the
mountains across the south plain Howd you like to pay him a visit

I dont want anybody but you said Lahoma promptly

Willock stood on one leg rubbing the other meditatively with his
delighted foot Not the quiver of a muscle however revealed the fact
that her words had flooded his heart with sunshine Well honey
thats in reason But Ive got to take you with me after books and
winter supplies and I dont like the idea of traveling alone It come
to me that I might get Mr Settler to go too Time was not so long
ago when Injun bands was coming and going and although old Greer is
beginning to be sprinkled up with settlers here and there I cant get
over the feel of the old times They aint no sensation as sticks by a
man when hes come to be wedged in between fortyfive and fifty as the
feel of the old times

Well said Lahoma earnestly I wish youd leave me here when you go
after them books I dont want to be with no strangers I want to just
squat right here and bear myself company

Thats in reason But honey while you might be safe enough whilst
bearing the same I would be plumb crazy worrying about you I might
not have good cause for worrying but worryingit aint no bird that
spreads its wings and goes north when cold weather comes
worryingits independent of causes and seasons

If you have got to be stayed with to keep you from worrying they
aint nothing more to be said

Just so That there old settler I have crossed a few words with him
and I believe he would do noble to travel with Hes as gruff and
growly as a grizzly bear if you say a word to him and if hell just
turn all that temper hes vented on me on to any strangers we may run
up against on the trail hell do invaluable

Ill go catch up the pony said Lahoma briefly for I see the thing
is to be did This will be the first visit I ever made in my life when
I wasnt drug by the Injuns

You mustnt say drug honey unless specifying medicines and herbs
I aint saying you didnt get it from me and knowing you do get from
me all I got is what makes me hone for them books You must say
dragged The Injuns DRAGGED you from one village to another He
paused meditatively muttering the word to himself while Lahoma ran
away to catch the pony When she came back leading it by the mane he
said Ive been aweighing that word Lahoma and it dont seem to me
that dragged sounds proper It dont seem no sort of word to use in
a parlor What do you think DRAGGED How does that strike you

I dont like the sound of it neither said Lahoma shaking her head
I think DRUG is softer It kinder melts in the ear and DRAGGED
sticks

Well dont use neither one till I can find out Presently he was
swinging along across the plain toward the southwestern range while the
girl kept close beside him on the pony Their talk was incessant
voicing the soul of good comradeship and but for the difference
between heavy bass and fluty soprano a listener might have supposed
himself overhearing a conversation between two Brick Willocks

There was nothing about the second range of the Wichita Mountains to
distinguish it from the one farthest toward the northeast except a
precipice at its extremity rising a sheer three or four hundred feet
above the level plain Beyond this lofty termination the mountain
curved inward leaving a wide grassy cove open toward the south and
within this halfcircle was the settlers dugout

The unprotected aspect of that little home was in itself an eloquent
commentary on the wonderful changes that had come about during the last
seventeen years The oval tract of one million five hundred thousand
acres lying between Red River and its fork named Greer County and
claimed by Texas was in miniature a reproduction of the early history
of America Until 1860 it had not even borne a name and since then it
had possessed no settled abodes Here bands of Indians of various
tribes had come and gone at will and here the Indians of the Plains
after horrible deeds of depredation massacre and reprisal had found
shelter among its mountains The country lay at the southwest corner
of Indian Territory for which the Indians had exchanged their lands in
other parts of the United States on the guarantee that the government
would forever secure to them and their heirs the country so exchanged
with them

At the close of the Civil War the unhappy Indians long continued in a
state of smoldering animosity or warlike activity tribe against
tribe band against band they had inherited the rancor and bitterness
of the White Mans war with neither the fruits of victory nor the
dignity that attends honorable defeat The reservations that belonged
originally to the Cherokee Choctaw Chickasaw Seminole and Creek
tribes were reduced in area to make room for new tribes from Kansas
Colorado and other states and the Indian wars resulted For a time
the scalpknife was crimsoned the stake was charred bands stole in
single file over mountains and among halfdried streams troups of the
regular army were assaulted by invisible foes and forts were
threatened Youths who read romances of a hundred years ago dealing
with the sudden warcry the flaming cabin the stealthy approach of
swarming savages need have traveled only a few hundred miles to
witness on the open page of life what seemed to them in their
longsettled states fables of a dead past

But though the Indian wars in the Territory had been bloody and
vindictive they had not been protracted as in the old days Around
the country of the red man was drawn closer and more securely day by
day the girdle of civilization Within its constricting grasp the
spirit of savagery if not crushed was at least subdued Tribes naked
but for their blankets unadorned save by the tattoo found themselves
pressed close to other tribes which already civilized had
relinquished the chase for agricultural pursuits Primeval men
breathing this quickened atmosphere of modernity either grew more
sophisticated or perished like wild flowers brought too near the heat
It is true the plains were still unoccupied but they had been
capturedfor the railroad had come and the buffalo had vanished

Brick Willock and the man he had come to see were very good types of
the first settlers of the new countryone a highwayman hiding from
his kind the other a trapper by occupation trying to keep ahead of
the pursuing waves of immigration It was the first time Lahoma had
seen Bill Atkins and as she caught sight of him before his dugout her
eyes brightened with interest He was a tall lank man of about
sixtyfive with a huge gray mustache and bushy hair of irongray but
without a beard The mustache gave him an effect of exceeding
fierceness and the deeply wrinkled forehead and square chin added
their testimony to his ungracious disposition

But Lahoma was not afraid of coyotes catamounts or mountainlions and
she was not afraid of Bill Atkins Her eyes brightened at the
discovery that he held in his hand that which Willock had described to
her as a book

Does he read she asked Willock breathlessly Does he read
Brick

Willock surveyed the seated figure gravely He reads he responded

The man looked up saw Willock and bent over his bookdiscovered
Lahoma on the pony and looked up again unwillingly but definitely
You never told me you had a little girl he remarked gruffly

You never asked me said Willock Get down Lahoma and make
yourself at home

The man shut his book What are you going to do

Going to visit you Turn the pony loose Lahoma he wont go far

Havent you got all that north range to yourself Bill Atkins asked
begrudgingly

Yap Howre you making it Atkins

Why as long as Im let alone Im making it all right Its being
let alone that I cant ever accomplish When I was a boy I began my
travels to keep out where I could breathe and Ive been crowded out of
Missouri and Kansas and Colorado and Wyoming and California and now
Ive come to the American Desert thinking I could die in peace but oh
no not ME I no sooner get settled and made my turf dugout than here
comes a stranger

Name of Brick Willock if youve forgot interpolated Willock
genially Ill just light my pipe as I reckon theres no objections
Lahoma dont care and you can breathe all right if you keep with the
wind from you

The man turned his back upon Willock opened his book and read

Lahoma approached the block of wood that supported him while Willock
calmly stretched himself out on the grass Is that a book she
asked by way of opening up the conversation

The man gripped it tighter and moved his lips busily As she remained
at his knee he presently said Oh no its a handorgan

Lahoma smiled pityingly Are you afraid of me Atkins

The man looked up with open mouth Not exactly kid There was
something in her face that made him lose interest in his book He kept
looking at her

Then why dont you tell the truth WE wont hurt you

The man opened his mouth and closed it Then he said Its a book

Did you ever read it before

This is the third time Ive read it

Seems as it hasnt accomplished no good on you as you still tell
lies

The man rose abruptly and laid the book on the seat His manner was
quite as discouraging as it had been from the start

Honey interposed Willock that aint to say a lie not a real lie

IS it a handorgan Lahoma demanded sternly

In a manner of speaking honey it is a handorgan in the sense of
shutting you off from asking questions You learn to distinguish the
sauces of speech as you gets older Out in the big world people dont
say this or that according as it is they steeps their words in a sauce
as suits the digestion Dont be so quick to call LIES till you
learns the flavor of a fellows meaning not by his words but by the
sauce he steeps em in

Dont get mad at me said Lahoma to the trapper I dont know
nothing never having captured and branded the thoughts that is caged
up in books But I want to be civilized and I am investigating
according

The trapper somewhat conciliated reseated himself He regarded the
girl with greater interest not without a certain approval How comes
it that you arent civilized living with such a knowing specimen as
your own father

My fathers dead Brick is my cousin but I not knowing nothing of
him till he saved my life two years ago and after that me with the
Indians and him all alone Would you like to hear about it

I wouldnt bother him honey with all that long story interposed
Willock suddenly grown restive

Yes tell me said the trapper moving over that she might find room
on the block of wood beside him

Lahoma seated herself eagerly and looking up into the others face
which softened more and more under her fearless gaze she said

We was crossing the plainsfather mother and me in a big wagon And
men dressed up like Indians they come whooping and shooting and
father turns around and drives with all his mightdrives clear to
yonder mountain And mother dies being that sick before and the
jolting too much for her So father takes me on his horse and rides
all night and I all asleep Well those same men dressed like
Indians they was in a cabin way up north and had put their wigs and
feathers off and was gambling over what they stole from the other
wagons So father he sees the light from the window and rides up with
me And they takes him for a spy and says they in a voice awful
fierce just this wayKILL EM BOTH

The trapper gave a start at the explosiveness of her tone

Lahoma shouted again as harshly as she could Kill em both says
they Then she turned to Willock Did I put them words in the
correct sauce Brick

You done noble honey

Lahoma resumed Now it was in a manner of happening that Brick he
was riding around to have a look at the country and when he rides up
to the cabin why right outside there was me and father and two of
the robbers about to kill us What are you devils up to says Brick
You go to hell says the leading man thats where were going to
send this spy and his little girl says he you go to hell and maybe
youll meet em there he says And with that he ups and shoots at
Brick the bullet lifting his hat right off his head and scaring the
horse out from under him so he falls right there at the feet of them
two robbermen on his back Brick he never harmed nobody before in
his life but what was he to do He might of let them kill him but
that would of left father and me in their grip so he just grabs the
gun out of the leading mans hand as he hadnt ever carried a gun in
his life his own self and he shot both them robbers him still laying
there on his back

No honey I got up about that time

Brick you told me you was still laying there on your back just as you
fell

Did I honey well I reckon I was then for when I told you about
it it was more recent

Its awful interesting the trapper remarked dryly

Yes aint it Lahoma glowed Then father jumped on one horse with
me and Brick put out on another and when I woke up the Indians were
all everywhere but Brick come here and lived all alone and nearly died
because he didnt have me to comfort him So the Indians took me and
they killed father and for two years I was moved from village to
village till Red Feather brought me to Brick And then we found out we
are cousins and he is going to civilize me Brick he remembers about a
cousin of his Cousin Martha Willock her sister went driving out to
the Oklahoma country with her husband and little girl and wasnt never
heard of I am the little girl all right and Brick hes my second
cousin And wasnt it lucky Brick was riding around that night
looking at the country when they was about to put daylight into me

Id think remarked the trapper that hed take you back to your
Cousin Martha for menfolks like him and me arent placed to take care
of womenfolks

Yes but he got a letter saying my Cousin Martha and all her family is
done been swept away by a flood of the Mississippi River and him and
me is all they is left of the Willockses so we got to stick together
Besides you see he killed them two robbers and the rest of the gang
is laying for him Brick he feels so dreadful he never having so much
as put a scratch to a mans face before for he wouldnt never fight as
a boy his conscience wouldnt rest if he was in civilization Hed go
right up to the first policeman he met and say I done the deed
Carry me to the pen hed say and then what would become of me

He might get another letter from your Cousin Martha to help him out of
the scrape

Lahoma stared at him unable to grasp the significance of these foolish
words and Brick seeking a diversion explained his purpose of taking
Lahoma to the settlements after supplies and proffered his petition
that Bill Atkins accompany them

Lahoma has never forgotten that expedition to the settlements Along
the Chisholm Trail marched Brick Willock and Bill Atkins one full of
genial philosophy responsive to every sight and sound along the way
the other taciturn and uncompanionable a being present in the flesh
but seemingly absent in the spirit Behind them rode the girl with
unceasing interest in the broad hardbeaten trailthe only mark in
that wilderness to tell them that others had passed that way The men
walked with deliberate but wellmeasured step preserving a pace that
carried them mile after mile seemingly with little weariness Three
times on the journey great herds of cattle were encountered on their
way toward Kansas and many were the looks of curiosity cast on the
little girl sitting as straight as an Indian on her pony

She was glad when a swinging cloud of dust announced the coming of
thousands of steers attended by cowboys for it meant a glimpse into
an unknown world and the bellowing of cattle the shouting of men and
the cracking of whips stirred her blood But she was glad too when
the stream of life had flowed past and she was left alone with Brick
and Bill for then the neverending conversation with the former was
resumed picked up at the point where it had been dropped or drawn
forward from raveled bits of unfinished discourse of the day before
and though Bill Atkins said almost nothing and always looked straight
ahead he was in a way spice in the feast of her enjoyment

When they stopped for their meals they drew aside from the trail if
possible near some spring or riverbed in which pools of water
lingered but such stoppingplaces were far apart in the desert
country At night there was a cheerful bonfire followed by zestful
talk as they lay on the ground before falling asleep in their
tarpaulinstalk eagerly monopolized by Brick and Lahoma and to which
Atkins seemed in a manner to listen perhaps warming his heart at the
light of their comradeship even as they warmed their hands in the early
morning at the breakfast fire Atkins had brought with him one of his
books and at the noon hours rest and at evening beside the bonfire
he kept his nose buried in its pages

Lahoma did not think life would have been too long to devote to such
pilgrimages In the settlements she was bewildered but never
satiated with novelties and on the way back everything she had seen
was discussed expounded and classified between her and her cousin
Sometimes her questions drove Brick up against a stone wall and then
Bill Atkins would raise his voice and in three or four words put the
matter in its true light

Bill hes saw more of life than me Brick conceded admiringly He
has come and went amongst all sorts of people but my specialty has in
the main been low

Yes Ive seen more of life Atkins agreed thats why I try so hard
to keep away from it

The more I see the more I want to see cried Lahoma eagerly

Yes honey Brick explained thats because youre a WOMAN

Once more back in the cove Lahoma dreamed new dreams peopling the
grassy solitude with the figures she had encountered on her travels
likening the rocks to various houses that had caught her fancy She
turned with absorbed interest to the primer and elementary arithmetic
with which Brick had supplied himself as the first tools for his mental
kit

The journey hack home had been far easier than the descent into Texas
because both Willock and Atkins had supplied themselves with
poniesanimals that sold ridiculously cheap at the outlying posts of
the settlements Brick Willock brought back with him something else to
add cheerfulness and usefulness to approaching winter This was a
square windowsash set with four small panes of good glass It was
hard work to place this window in Lahomas side of the dugout but it
was work thoroughly enjoyed Lahomas room was on the west and from
noon to sundown the advantage of the window was a source of
neverending delight

Good thing weve got our window Brick would say as they sat on the
low rude bench before the little stove and the furious wind of January
howled overhead Or when the wintry sky was leaden and all Bricks
side of the partition was as dark as the hole of a prairiedog he
would visit Lahoma and gloat over the dim gray light stealing through
the small panes That windows no bad idea he would chuckle
stooping his great bulk cautiously as he seated himself as if to
lighten his weight by doubling in upon himself

Good thing Ive got my window Lahoma would say as the snow lay thick
on the plains and in broken lines all over the mountain and the
cutting blast made the fire jump with sudden fright She would hold
her book close to the dirt square in which the frame was planted and
spell out words she had never heard used such as lad lass
sport and the like mysteries This window is going to civilize me
Brick

It did not lessen their relish in the subject that they had discussed
it already a hundred times It was the same way with the handmade
bench with the trench that carried water from their door during sudden
downpours and with the selfcongratulation over owning two ponies to
keep each other company

Theys one thing about us Lahoma which it aint according to the big
outside world and yet I hope it wont never be changed We are mighty
glad weve got what weve got And to be glad of what youve got is a
sure way to multiply your property Every time you brag on that
window it shines like two windows to me

Spring came late that year and in the early days of March Brick rode
over to the cove behind the precipice after Bill Atkins I want you
to come over to my place he begged and answer some of Lahomas
questions Being closeted with her in that there dugout all winter
she has pumped me as dry as a bone

Perhaps Bill Atkins had had his fill of solitude during that cold
winteror perhaps he was hungry for another hour of the little girls
company Nothing however showed his satisfaction as he entered her
chamber Here I am he announced seating himself on the bench
This was his only greeting

Is it drug or dragged demanded Lahoma

Dragged

Why dont God send me a little girl to play with after me asking for
one every night all winter

Dont understand Gods business replied Atkins briefly

I puts it this way Brick spoke up Gods done sent one little girl
and it aint right to crowd Him too far

Will I be all they is of me as long as I live

Nobody wont never come to live in these plains Brick declared
unless its trappers and characters like us But well stay by you
wont we Bill Atkins

Atkins looked exceedingly gruff and shook his head as if he had his
doubts about it Youll have to be taken to the States he declared

But what would become of Brick

Well honey said Brick you want to take your place with people in
the big world dont you

Oh YES cried Lahoma starting up and stretching her arm toward the
window In the big worldyes Thats the place for methats where
I want to live But what will become of you

Well Brick answered slowly the rock pile tother side the
mountain is good enough for me Your mother sleeps under it

Oh Brick She caught his arm You wouldnt die if I went away
would you

Why you see honey they wouldnt be nothing left to go on Id just
sort of stop you knowbut it wouldnt matterout there in the big
world people dont remember very long and when youre grown you
wouldnt know thered ever been a cove with a dugout in it and a
window in the wall and a Brick Willock to carry in the wood for the
fire

Ill always rememberand I wont go without you He COULD go with
me couldnt he Bill

I suspicion he has his reasons for not Atkins observed gravely

I has and I shall never go back to the States

Then whats the use civilizing me demanded Lahoma mournfully

I want you to enjoy yourself And when Im old and nocount youd
need somebody to take care of youand youd go fullequipped and ready
to stand up to any civilized person that tried to run a bluff on you

But oh I want to GOI want to go out THEREwhere there aint no
plains and alkali and buffalograsswhere theys pavements and
policemen and people in beautiful clothes I dont mean NOW I mean
when I have got civilized She drew herself up proudly I wouldnt
go till I was civilized till I was like them She turned impulsively
to Brick But youve got to go with me when I go Im going to stay
with you till Im fit to go and then youre going to stay with me the
rest of my life

Am I fit to go with her Brick appealed to Bill Atkins

You aint Bill replied

I aint fit Brick declared firmly Im agoing to fitten you but
its too late to work on me and besides if they WAS time enough it
aint to the grain of my nature I knows all I wants to know which if
little or much is enough for me And I wouldnt be fit to go with you
out into the big world and cut a figger in it which couldnt be no
figger but a figger naught And Atkins who knows more than me he says
the same

The tears were in Lahomas eyes She looked from one to the other her
little face deeply troubled Suddenly she grabbed up her books and
started toward the stove Then this here civilizing is going to
stop she declared

Lahoma Brick cried in dismay

Yes it isunless you promise to stay with me when I go to live in
the big world

Honey Ill promise you this When you are ready to live out there
Ill sure go with you and stay with youif you want me when the time
comes

Lahoma seized his hand and jumped up and down in delight

Its a safe promise remarked Bill Atkins dryly



CHAPTER IX

A YOUNG MANS FANCY

One evening in May a tall lithe figure crept the southern base of the
mountain range following its curves with cautious feet as if fearful
of discovery It was a young man of twentyone or two bronzed free
of movement agile of step His face was firm handsome and open
although at present a wish to escape observation caused the hazel eyes
to dart here and there restlessly while the mouth tightened in an
aspect of sternness This air of wild resolution was heightened by the
cowboys ordinary garments and the cowboys indispensable belt
wellstocked with weapons

On reaching the spur that formed the western jaw of the horseshoe he
crept on hands and knees but satisfied by searching glances that the
inner expanse was deserted he half rose and stole shadowlike along
the granite wall until he had reached the hillisland that concealed
the cove Again falling on hands and knees he drew himself slowly up
among the huge flat rocks that covered the hill in all directions In
a brief time he had traversed it and a view of the cove was suddenly
unrolled below A few yards from Brick Willocks dugout now stood a
neat log cabin and not far from the door of this cabin was a girl of
about fifteen seated on the grass

She had been reading but her book had slipped to her feet With hands
clasped about her knee and head tilted back she was watching the lazy
white clouds that stretched like wisps of scattered cotton across the
blue field of the sky At first the young man was startled by the
impression that she had discovered his presence and was scrutinizing
his position but a second glance reassured him and he stretched
himself where a block of granite and below it a cedar tree
effectually protected him from discovery Thus hidden he stared at
the girl unblinkingly

He was like a thirsty traveler drinking at a cool well unexpectedly
discovered in a desert country For two years he had led the life of
the cowboy exiled from his kind going with the boys from lower Texas
to Kansas along the Chisholm Trail overseeing great herds of cattle
caring for them day and night scarcely ever under a roof even that of
a dugout Through rain and storm the ground had been his bed and
many a blistering summer day a pony captured wild from the plains and
broken to stand like a dog had been his only shade During these two
years of hard life reckless companions and exacting duties he had
easily slipped into the grooves of speech and thought common to his
fellows Only his face his unconscious movements and accents
distinguished him from the other boys of Old Man Walkerthe boss of
the GBar Outfit On no other condition but that of apparent
assimilation could he have retained his place with Walkers ranchmen
and in his efforts to remove as quickly as possible the reproach of
tenderfoot it was not his fault that he had retained the features of a
different world or that a certain air not of the desert was always
breaking through the crust under which he would have kept his real self
out of sight He himself was the least conscious that this was so

For two years he had seen no one like the girl of the cove
nonethough he had seen women and girls of the settlements often
enoughwho even suggested her kind Her dress indeed was plain
enough and obviously chosen in cheerful ignorance of forms and
conventions though the color a delicate pink was all he could have
wished After all the clothes revealed nothing except absence from
city shops and city standards

That was wonderful hair its brown tresses gleaming though untouched by
the sun as if in it were enmeshed innumerable particles of light It
seemed to glow from its very fineness its silkinessthe kind of hair
one is prompted to touch to feel if it is really that way The face
was more wonderful because it told many things that can not be
expressed in mere hairlanguage There was the seal of innocence on
the lips the proof of fearlessness in the eyes the touch of thought
on the brow the sign of purpose about the resolute little chin The
slender brown hands spoke of life in the open air and the glow of the
cheeks told of burning suns Her form her attitude spoke not only of
instinctive grace but of a certain wildness in admirable harmony with
the surrounding scene Somehow the ruggedness of the mountains and
the desolate solitudes of the plains were reflected from her face

The young man gazed as if his thirst would never be appeased The
flavor of nights about the campfire and other nights spent in driving
sleet also days when the first flowers come and the wide beds of the
desert rivers are swollen with overbrimming floods the cruel exposure
of winter the thrilling balminess of early springall spoke to him
again from that motionless figure He recalled companions of his
boyhood and youth but they were not akin to this child of the desert
mountains Still more alien were those of the saloon stations the
haunts at the outskirts of civilization It seemed to him that in this
young girl who bad the look and poise of a woman he had found what
hitherto he had vainly sought in the wildernessthe beauty and the
charm of it refined and separated from its sordidness and its
uncouthnessin a word from all that was base and ugly It was for
this that he had left his home in the East Here was typified that
loveliness of the unbroken wilderness without its profanity its
drunkenness its obscenity its terrible hardships

At last he tore himself away retraced his steps as cautiously as he
had conic and flung himself upon the pony left waiting at a sheltered
nook far from the cove As he sped over the plains toward the distant
herd it came to him suddenly in a way not before experienced that it
was May that the air was balmy and fragrant and that the land softly
lighted in the clear twilight was singularly beautiful He seemed
breathing the roses back homewhich recalled another face but not for
long The last time he had seen that eastern face the dew had lain on
the early morning roseshow could a face so different make him think
of them But imagination is sometimes a bold robber and now it did
not hesitate to steal those memories of sweet scents to encloud the
picture of the mountaingirl

The GBar headquarters was on the western bank of what was then known
as Red River but was really the North Fork of Red River Old Man
Walker who was scarcely past middle age had built his corral on the
margin of the plain which extended to that point in an unbroken level
from a great distance and which having reached that point dropped
without warning a sheer precipice to an extensive lake The lake was
fed by springs issuing from the bluffs not far beyond it and not much
lower was the bed of the river wide very red and almost dry Beyond
the river rose the bold hills of the Kiowa country a white line
chiseled across the face of each as if Time had entertained some
thought of their destruction but finding each a huge block of living
rock had passed on to torture and shift and alter the bed of the river

The young man reached the corral after a ride of twelve or thirteen
miles most of the distance through a country of difficult sand He
galloped up to the rude enclosure surrounded by a cloud of dust
through which his keen gray eyes discovered Mizzoo on the eve of
leaving camp Mizzoo was one of the men whose duty it was to ride the
line all nightthe line that the young man had guarded all dayto
keep Walkers cattle from drifting

Come on Mizz called the young man as the other swung upon his
broncho Im going back with you

The lean leatherskinned sandymustached cattleman uttered words not
meet for print but expressive of hearty pleasure Aint you had
enough of it Bill he added Id think youd want to lay up for
tomorrows work

Oh I aint sleepy the young man declared as they rode away side by
side I couldnt close an eye tonightand I want to talk

The cattleman chuckled enjoyingly It was lonely and monotonous work
riding back and forth through the darkness keeping a sharp lookout for
wolves or Indians driving straggling cattle back to the herd in
brief doing the picket duty of the plains

Mizzoo was so called from his habit of attributing his most emphatic
aphorisms to his aunt Miss Sue of Missouria lady held by his
companions to be a purely fictitious character a convenient Mrs
Harris to give weight to sayings worn smooth from centuries of use

Of all the boys of the ranch Mizzoo found Wilfred Compton most
companionable When off duty they were usually to be found near each
other whether awake or asleep and when Mizzoo on entering some
village at the edge of the desert sought relaxation from a life of
routine by shooting through the windows and spurring his pony into the
saloons it was the young man commonly known as Bill who lingered
behind to advance money for damages to the windows or who kept close
to the drunken ranger in order to repair the damages Mizzoo had done to
his own soul and body

Ill talk my head off Mizzoo declared if thatll keep you on the
move with me for its one thing meeting a ghost in the desert all
alone and quite another when theres a pair of us Yes I know you
dont believe nothing I say about that spirit and I only hope well
come on it tonight It aint been a week since I see something
creeping along behind me whilst I was riding the line a little thing
as swift as a jackrabbit and as sly as a coyotesomething with long
arms and short legs and the face of an Injun

Of course it WAS an Indian returned the young man carelessly He is
hanging about here to steal some of our horses I dont want you to
talk about your ghost Ive heard of him a thousand times

Bill the more you talk about a ghost the more impressive he gets I
tell you that wasnt no live Injun Didnt I blaze away at him with my
sixshooter and empty all my barrels for nothing No sir its the
same spirit that haunts the trail from Vernon Texas to Coffeyville
Ive shot at that red devil this side of Fort Sill and at Skeleton
Spring and at Bull Foot Spring and a mile from Doans storealways
at night for it never rises except at night as befits a good ghost
I reckon Ill waste cartridges on that spook as long as I hit the
trail but I dont never expect to draw blood Others has saw him
too but me more especial I reckon Im the biggest sinner of the
GBar and has to be plagued most frequent with visitations to make me a
better man when I get to be old

Hes a knowing old ghost if hes found you out Mizzoo but if you
want my company tonight youll drop the Indian What I want you to
talk about is that little girl you met on the trail down in Texas
seven years ago

Mizzoo burst out in a hearty laugh I reckon it suits you better to
take her as a little kid he cried his tall form shaking
convulsively Ill never forget how you looked Bill when we tried
to run a bluff on her daddy last month

The other did not answer with a smile Apparently the reminiscence
pleased him less than it did the older man He spurred his horse
impatiently and it plunged forward through the drifted banks of white
sand

Mizzoo hastened to overtake him still chuckling Old Man Walker
never knowed what a proposition he was handing us when he ordered us to
drive the old mountainlion out of his lair Looks like the six of us
ought to have done the trick Them other fellows looked as wild as
bears and you was just like a United States soldier marching on a
Mexican strongholt not stopping at nothing and it aint for me to say
how brave _I_ done Pity you and me was at the tailend of the
attacking party Fust thing we knowed them other four galoots was
falling backwards agetting out of that trap of a cove and the bullets
was whizzing about our ears

He broke off to shout with laughter And it was all done by one old
settler and his gal them standing out open and free with their
breechloaders and us hiking out for camp like whipped curs

The young man was impatient but he compelled himself to speak calmly
As I never got around the spur of the mountain before you fellows were
in full retreat I object to being classed with the whipped curs and
youll bear that in mind Mizzoo You saw the girl all right didnt
you

You bet I did and as soon as I see her I knowed it was the same Id
came across on the trail seven year ago Id have knowed it from her
daddy of course but there wasnt no mistaking HER Her daddy give it
to us plain that if he ever catched one of us inside his cove hed kill
us like so many coyotes and I reckon he would Well hes got as much
right to his claim as anybody elsethis land dont belong to nobody
and there hes been asquatting considerable longer than weve laid out
this ranch He was in the right of it but what I admire was his being
able to hold his rights Lots of folks has rights but they aint man
enough to hold em And if von could have seen that gal her eyes like
two big burning suns and her mouth closed like a steeltrap and her
hand as steady on that trigger as the mountain rock behind her Lord
Bill what a trembly knockkneed meaching sort of a husband shes
agoing to fashion to her hand one of these days But PRETTY None
more so And agoing all to waste out here in the desert

They rode on for some time in silence save for the intermittent
chuckling of the cattleman as visions of his companions pale faces and
scurrying forms rose before his mind

And now about that child seven years ago the young man said when
the last hoarse sound of mirth had died away

Why yes me and the boys was bringing about two thousand head up to
Abiline when we come on to this same pardner and another man walking
the trail with a little gal coming behind em on her pony And it was
this same gal I reckon she was seven or eight year old then Well
sir I just thought as I looked at her that I never seen a prettier
sight in this world and I reckon I aint for when I looked at the same
gal the other day the gun she was holding up to her eye sort of
dazzled me so I couldnt take stock of all her good points But seeing
that little gal out there in the plains it was like hearing an
oldfashioned hymn at the country meetinghouse and knowing a big
basket dinner was to follow I cant express it more deep than that
We went into camp that evening and all of us got pretty soft and
mellow what from the unusualness of the meeting and we asked the old
codger if we could all come over to his camp and shake hands with the
galhed drawed back from us about a mile he was that skeered to be
sociable So after considerable haggling and jawing he said we could
and here we come just about sundown all of us looking sheepish enough
to be carved for mutton but everlasting determined to take that gal by
the paw

Well said the young man who had often heard this story but had
never been treated to the sequel what happened then Mizzoo You
always stop at the same place Didnt you shake hands with her

The other ruminated in deep silence for some time then rejoined I
dont know how it isa fellow can talk about the worst devilment in
creation with a free rein and no words hot enough to blister his
tongue but let him run up against something simple like that and the
bottom of his lungs seems to fall out I guess they aint no more to
be told That was all there was to it though I might add that the
next day we come along by old Whisky Simeons joint that sets out on
the sandhills you know and we put spurs to our bronks and went
whooping by with old Whisky Sim astaring and ahollering after us
like he thought we was crazy I dont know as I had missed a drunk
before for five year when the materials was readyfound for its
making And I aint never forgot the little kid with the brown hair
and the eyes that seen to your bottom layer like a waterwitch
apenetrating the ground with a glance seeing through dirt and clay
and rocks to what water they is

Mizzoo relapsed into meditative silence and the young man in sympathy
with his mood kept at his side no longer asking questions Darkness
came on and the hour grew late but few words were exchanged as they
rode the weary miles that marked the limit of the range There were
the usual incidents of such work each bringing its customary comments
The midnight luncheon beside a small fire over which the coffee
steamed roused something like cheerful conversation which however
flickered and flared uncertainly like the bonfire On the whole the
young man was unwontedly reserved and the other perceiving it fell
back contentedly on his own resourcespleasant memories and rank
tobacco

Guess Ill leave you now remarked the young man when the fire had
died away

Yes better turn in for youre most uncommon dull you know Mizzoo
replied frankly Twould be just about as much company for me if
youd hike out and leave me your picture to carry along

Instead of taking the direction toward the river the young man set out
at a gallop for the distant mountain range which in the gloom seemed
not far away After an hours hard riding he reached it His
impatience bad made that hour seem almost interminable yet it had not
been long enough to furnish him with any clear reason for having come
If as Mizzoo had declared he needed sleep he would surely not think
of finding it near the cove from which his companions had been warned
under penalty of death If drawn by longing for another glimpse of the
girl of the cove he could not expect to see her an hour or two after
midnight Yet here he was attracted and still urged on by impulses
he did not attempt to resist



CHAPTER X

THE FLAG OF TRUCE

Earliest dawn found the young man seated composedly upon one of the
flattened outcroppings of the bill of stone that lay like an island
between the outer plain and the sheltered cove As yet there was no
sign of life within the coveboth the dugout and the cabin of cedar
logs were as silent and as void of movement as the rocks behind them
The young man watched first one then the other as tireless and
vigilant as if he had not been awake for twentyfour hours

It was the dugout that first started from its nights repose Before
the sun showed itself over the rim of the prairie long before its rays
darted over the distant mountaincrest the door was thrown away from
the casing and a great uncouth man strong as a giant and wild of
aspect as a savage strode forth gun in hand his eyes sweeping the
landscape in quick flashing glances Almost instantly he discovered
the figure perched on the granite block overlooking his retreat He
raised his gun to his shoulder

The young man fell sidewise behind the rocks and a bullet clipped the
edge of his barricade Remaining supine he fastened his handkerchief
to the end of his whip and waved it above the rampart Having thus
manifested his peaceful intent he rose still holding the flag of
truce above his head and remained motionless Brick Willock stared at
him for a moment in hostile indecision then strode forward At the
same time an old man thin tall and whitehaired issued from the
dugout evidently attracted by the gunshot and soon after the cabin
door opened and the girl of the cove looked out inquiringly

In the meantime the young man slowly descended the hill to the oval
valley while Willock hurried forward to meet him

Dont you come no futher Willock commanded threatening with his
gun Keep your hands above your head until I can ship your cargo

Obediently he stood while the great whiskered fellow took the weapons
from his belt and dived into his hip pockets

Thatll do Nowwhat do you want

Its hard to put it into a few words the other complained Id
like to have a little talk with you

You are one of them fellows that come here to run us out of the
country aint you I dont remember seeing you but I guess you
belong to the bunch over on Red River Well you see were still here
meaning to stay Are your pards outside there waiting for a message

Nobody knows Im here or thought of coming Let me put that affair
in its true light The boys are all under our boss and when he lays
down the law it isnt for us to argue with himwe carry out orders

Unless theres a Brick Willock involved in them orders returned the
man with a grim smile

But its our duty to TRY to carry out the orders whether we like em
or not So you wont hold that against methat little scrimmage of
last month especially as you came out best man

I used to have a boss myself Willock spoke uncompromisingly But
when he give me certain orders one particular night that I recollect
I knocked him on the head and put out for other parts You must of
thought yourself in PRETTY business coming over here to take away the
land and all on it thats belonged to me for nine years and nobody
never having tried to prize me out of it except some trifling Injuns
and horsethieves Aint they NO honesty in the world Hasnt no man
his property rights I guess your boss knowed this wasnt HIS land
didnt he Whats going to become of this country when man isnt
satisfied with what is hisn Well now youve had a little talk with
me and hoping youve enjoyed it you can just mosey along Ill send
your weapons after you by a messenger

The young man cast a despairing glance toward the girl who stood like a
statue in her doorway gravely listening The man with the bushy white
hair had drawn near but evidently with no thought of interfering

Willock the voice came so eager so impetuous that the words were
somewhat incoherent Ive GOT to talk to your daughterhold on dont
shoot LISTENthats what Ive come for to see her andand meet her
and hear her voice I cant help it can I Its been two long years
since I left home back East and in all these two years Ive never
seen anything like your little girl andand what harm can it do I
say Have pity on a fellow and do him the biggest favor he could
enjoy on this earth when it wont cost you a penny or a turn of your
hand Look herehold on dont turn away Im just so lonesome so
homesick so dead KILLED by all these sandhills and alkali beds and
nothing to talk to from one years end to the next but men and
cattle

Willock glared at him in silence fingering the trigger thoughtfully

There Ive sat on that hill he continued since two oclock last
night waiting for daylight so I could ask you to help a miserable
wretch thats just starving to death for the sound of a girls voice
and the sight of a girls smile Isnt this square waiting for you
and telling you the whole truth I never saw her but once and that
was from this same hill She didnt know I was watching it was
yesterday Maybe all Im saying sounds just crazy to you and I reckon
I am out of my senses but until I saw her I didnt know how heartsick
I was of the whole business

It IS kinder lonesome remarked the other gruffly He lowered his
gun and leaned on it irresolutely Youve sure touched me in the
right spot son for I knows all you mean and more that you aint even
ever dreampt of But you see we dont know nothing about your name
your character if youve got one nor what you really intends I like
your looks and the way you talk fine just fine but Ive saw bobcats
that was mighty sleek and handsome when they didnt know I was nigh

My name in Wilfred Compton II have a letter or two in my pocket
that I got a long time ago theyd tell something about me but Id
rather not show em as theyre private

From your gal I reckon asked Willock more mildly

Yes he answered gloomily

Carried em as long as a year

Nearly two years

Mean to still lug em around

Of course Im going to keep em

Well I dont deny THATS pretty favorable Now look here son Ive
been halfcrazy from lonesomeness and I dont believe Ive got the
heart to send you away That gal of oursshes just a kid you
understand Now you wouldnt be taking up no idea that she was what
youd classify as a young lady or anything like that eh

Of course notshes fifteen or sixteen I should think Upon my
honor Willock any thought of sentiment or romance is a thousand miles
from my mind

Yes just so But such thoughts travels powerful fast dont take em
long to lap over a thousand mile

But its because she IS a young girl fresh and unartificial as the
mountain breezes that I want to be with her for a little whileyes
get to know her if I may

Willock turned to the taciturn old man standing a little behind him
Bill Atkins what do you say

I say fire him and do it quick was the instant rejoinder
accompanied by threatening twitchings of the huge white mustache

Willock was not convinced Son if you sets here till we have had our
breakfast and has held a caucus over you Ill bring you the verdict
in about an hour If you dont like that theys nothing to do but put
out for your ranch

I go on duty at seven replied the young man composedly but I have
a friend riding the line thatll stay with it till I come So Ill
wait for your caucus

That friendone of them devils I shot at the other day

Wilfred Compton smiled with sudden sunniness Yes

Somewhere beneath the immense whiskers an answering smile slipped like
a breeze stirring the irongray hair I kinder believe in you son
Nobody cant gainsay that youve played the man in this matter Now
just one thing more You must swear here before me with Bill Atkins
for an unwilling witness that should we let you make the acquaintance
of our little gal and should you get to be friends you two that the
very fust minute it comes to you that she aint no little gal but is
in the way of being food for loveBill Atkins air I making myself
plain

You aint returned the old man sourly Youre too complicated for
ordinary use

Then YOU tell him what I mean

The old man glared at Wilfred fiercely If we decide to grant your
request young man swear on your honor that the second you find
yourself thinking of our little girl as a WOMAN to be wooed and won
youll put out and never stop till youre so far away youll be clear
out of her world And not one word to her not so much as one hint
mind you as to the reason of your going itll just be goodby and
farewell

You see Willock interpolated she is nothing a little gal and we
dont want no foolish ideas to the contrary You takes her for what
she is nothing took from nor added to In course shell be growed up
some day I reckon though may the good Lord take a good long time
finishing up the work Hes begun so noble When shes growed up when
shes a woman it aint for us to say how you come and how you go take
from or add to But while shes a kid it is different according

You have my word of honor to all these conditions Wilfred cried
lightly As a child of the mountains I ask for her acquaintance If I
should ever feel differently about her Ill go away and stay away
until shes a woman Surely thats enough to promise

There aint too much to promise when it comes to the peace and
happiness of our little girl retorted the old man but I cant think
of any more for you to take oath to

Me nuther Bill agreed Willock Seems to me the young man is bound
as firm as humans can do the binding Now you sit right here son
dont come a step nigher the house and well go to breakfast and
later youll know whether or not all this promising has been idle waste
of time

But I can see how itll turn out growled Atkins for she is always
alooking for something new something out of the big world that she
dont know nothing about

Never mind Bill dont give up so quick Willock reproached him as
they turned away Shes been having a good look at him all this time
and it may be she have took a distaste to him already



CHAPTER XI

THE HALFOPENED BUD

The two men went into the cabin An hour later they reappeared
accompanied by the girl Wilfred was still seated obediently on the
rock but at sight of them he rose with a gay laugh and advanced

Come over here in the shade Willock called as he strode toward a
grassy bank that sloped up to a line of three cedar trees of
interlocked branches Come over here and know her This is our gal

Lahoma looked at the young man with grave interest taking note of his
garments and movements as she might have examined the skin and actions
of some unknown animal Bill Atkins also watched him but with
suspicious eye as if anticipating a sudden spring on his ward

Set down said Willock sinking on the grass The last man up is
the biggest fool in Texas

Lahoma and Wilfred instantly dropped as if shot at the same time
breaking into unexpected laughter that caused Willocks beard to quiver
sympathetically Bill Atkins sour and unresponsive stood as stiffly
erect as possible aided no little in this obstinate attitude by the
natural unelasticity of age

The young man exclaimed boyishly still smiling at the girl Were
friends already because weve laughed together

Yes cried Lahoma and Brick is in it too Thats best of all

_I_ aint in it cried Bill Atkins so fiercely that the young man was
somewhat discomposed

Now Bill exclaimed the girl reprovingly you sit right down by my
side and do this thing right She explained to the young man Bill
Atkins has been higher up than Brick and he knows forms and
ceremonies but he despises to act up to what he knows Sit right
down Bill and make the move There was something so unusual in the
attitude of the blooming young girl toward the weatherbeaten
forbiddinglooking man something so authoritative and at the same time
so protecting at once the air of a superior who commands and who
shelters from the tyranny of othersthat Wilfred was both amused and
touched

Yes Bill said Willock make the move Make em know each other

This is Miss Lahoma Willock growled Bill and thiswaving at the
young man disparaginglySAYS he is Wilfred Compton Know each other

Im glad to know you Lahoma declared frankly Its mighty lucky
you came this way for you see I just live here in the cove and never
touch the big world I believe you know a thousand things about the
world that we aint never dreamed of

That we have never dreamed of corrected Bill Atkins

That we have never dreamed of resumed Lahoma meekly and thats
what I would like to hear about I expect to go out in the big world
and be a part of it when I am older when I know how to protect
myself Brick says Im just a little girl now if I do look so big
Im only fifteen but when I am of age Im going out into the big
world so thats why Im glad to know you to use you like a kind of
dictionary Are you coming back here again

I hope so he exclaimed fervently

And so do I In my cabin I have a long list of things written down in
my tablet that Id like to know about questions that come to me as I
sit looking over the hill into the sky things Brick doesnt know and
not even Bill Atkins You going to tell me them there things

Bill interposed Will you kindly tell me those things

Will you kindly tell me those things Lahoma put the revised
question as calmly as if she had not suffered correction

You see how it is son Willock remarked regretfully Lahoma keeps
pretty close to me and Im always aleading her along the wrong
trails not having laid out an extensive education when I was planning
the grounds I calculated to live in When I got anything to say I
just follows the easiest way knowing Ill get to the end of it if I
talk constant People in the big world aint no more natural in
talking than in anything else They builds up fences and arbitrary
walls and is careful to stay right in the middle of the beaten path
and Im all time keeping Bill busy at putting up the bars after me so
Lahoma will go straight

So thats why Im glad to know you Lahoma said gravely But why
did you want to know ME She fastened on him her luminous brown eyes
with red lips parted awaiting the clearing up of this mystery

Wilfred preserved a solemn countenance Ive been awfully lonesome
Lahoma the last two years because up to that time Id lived in a
city with friends all about town and no end of gay timesand these
last two years Ive been in the terrible desert You are the first
girl Ive seen that reminded me of home when I saw you and knew you
were my kind the way you held yourself and the smile in your eyes

Bill interposed Dont you forget that binding young man

Of course not But I dont know how to tell just what it means to me
to be with herwith all of you I meanbut her especially
becausewell I had so many friends among the girls back home
andand Its no use trying to explain if youve known the horrible
lonesomeness of the plains you already understand and if you dont

I know what you mean Willock remarked with a reminiscent sigh

Let it not be put in words Bill persisted If a thing cant be
expressed words only mislead I never knew any good to come of
talking about smiles in eyes Theres nothing to it but misleading
words

Go on Lahoma said Willock encouragingly were both staying with
you to see that you come out of this with flying colors Just go
ahead

I want to ask you all about yourself remarked Lahoma thoughtfully
because I can see from your face and the way you talk that youre a
real sample of the big world If I tell you all about myself will you
do the same

Wilfred promised and Lahoma entered on the history of her childhood
Wilfred looked and listened joyously conscious of the unusual scene
alive to the subtle charm of her fearless eyes her unreserved
confidences the melting harmony of her musical tones To be sure she
was only a child but he saw already the promise of the woman The
petals as yet were closed but the faint sweet fragrance was already
astir He found too that in her nature was already developed
something not akin to youth something impersonal having nothing to do
with ones number of yearslike the breath of experience or the
ancient freshness of a new day It was born of the mountains and
nourished in the solitude of the plains

How different the girls of fifteen or sixteen such as he had known in
the city or in sophisticated villages in the East Lahoma had not been
so engrossed by trivial activities of exacting days that she had lacked
time for thought Her housekeeping cares were few and devoid of
routine leaving most of the hours of each day for reading for
daydreaming for absorbed meditation Somehow the dreams seemed to
linger in her voice to hover upon her brow to form a part of her
and the longings of those dreams were halfveiled in her eyes looking
out shyly as if afraid of wounding her guardians by full revelation
She wanted to meet life to take a place in the worldbut what would
then become of Willock and Bill

Bill used to live seven miles away at the mountain with the
precipice she went on after she had told about the wonderful window
But it was too far off When he got to know me it tired him walking
this far twice a day morning and nightdidnt it Bill So at last
Brick and Bill decided to cut some cedars from the mountain and make me
a cabinthey took the dugout to sleep in There are two rooms in the
cabin one the kitchen where we eatand the other my parlor where I
sleep Some time you shall visit me in the cabin if Brick and Bill
are willing They made it for me so I couldnt ask anybody in unless
they said so

We arent far enough along observed Bill to be shut up together
under a roof

Id like to have you visit my parlor Lahoma said somewhat wistfully
Id like to show you all my booksthey were Bills when we first met
him but since then hes given me everything hes got havent you old
Bill Lahoma leaned over and patted the unyielding shoulder

Bill stared moodily at the top of the mountain as if in a gloomy
trance but Wilfred fancied he moved that honored shoulder a trifle
nearer the girl

She resumed her face glowing with sudden rapture There are six
bookshalf a dozen Maybe youve heard of some of them Bills read
em over lots of times He begins with the first on the shelf and when
hes through the row he just takes em up all over again I like to
read parts of themthe interesting parts This is the way they stand
on the shelf The Children of the Abbeythats Bills favorite The
Scottish Chiefs David Copperfield The Talisman The Prairie The Last
of the Mohicans

I like The Children of the Abbey best too observed Brick Willock
thoughtfully Lahoma shes read em all to me thats the way we get
through the winter months Theys something softening and enriching
about that there Children of the Abbey and Scottish Chiefs has got
some mighty high work in it too I tells Lahoma that I guess them two
books is just about as near the real thing out in the big world as you
can get David Copperfield is sort of slow Ive went with people that
knowed a powerful sight more than them characters in David I used to
drift about with a bunch of fellows that Uriah Heep couldnt have stood
up against for five minutes The Talisman is noble doings too but not
uptodate As for The Prairie and The Last of the Mohicans them is
dissatisfying booksthey make you think being as you lives in just
such quarters interesting things might happen most any minuteand
they never does

Why Brick Lahoma reproached him THIS has happened she nodded
at Wilfred Compton Dont you call that interesting

Thats the way _I_ discusses them books returned Willock with
manifest satisfaction I wasnt never no man to be overawed by no
book which however high and by whoever wrote aint no more like life
than a shadow in a pool Try to grab that shadow and where is it
Just to go out after game and climb the mountains all day and come home
of an evening to sit down to a plate of bacon and eggs and another of
the same with coffee smoking on the little stove and Lahoma urging on
the feastthats more of real living than youd get out of a big
library Aint it Bill

Now WE want to talk Brick interposed Lahomadont we Wilfred

So your cabin was built Wilfred prompted her and the men took the
dugout

Yesand then oh the most wonderful thing happened a family
settled in the arm of the mountain at the west enda family that had a
woman and a baby in ita sureenough woman with a sweet face and of a
high grade though worked down pretty level what from hardshipsand a
baby that laughed just laughed whenever he saw me coming in the
dugoutand I was over there every day And thats how I got to be
like a woman and know how to dress and how to meet strangers without
being scared and preside at table and use language like this Other
settlers began coming into Greer but they were far away and Brick and
Bill dont like folks so they stayed shut up pretty close But for
three years I had the mother and her baby to show me how to be a woman
Then came the soldiers Brick thinks a big cattleking stood in with
Congress and he got the soldiers sent here to drive out all the
settlers because they were beginning to farm the land instead of
letting it grow wild for the cattle Anyway all the settlers were
driven out of the countryand its been four years since I lost my
only friends in the worldexcept Brick and Bill What makes me and
Brick and Bill mad is that the soldiers didnt have any right to drive
out the settlers because Texas claims this country and so does the
United States but its never been settled

But they didnt drive YOU out Wilfred remarked inquiringly

You see Brick explained simply we didnt want to go

It nearly broke Mrs Featherbys heart to have to leave Lahoma
added for theyd got a good stand of wheat and I think she liked me
most as well as I liked her But Mr Featherby came from Ohio and he
had respect to the government so when the soldiers said Go he
pulled up stakes

We aint got no respect to nothing Brick explained that stands in
the way of doing what were a mind to The soldiers come to force us
out but they changed their minds I reckon they knew they hadnt no
morality on their side Sure thing they knowed they had but very
little safety whilst occupying their position None was left but us
in this country till you cattlemen come monopolizing Heaven and earth
Knowing we got just as much right to this cove as Uncle Sam himself we
expect to stay here at anchor till Lahoma steams out into the big world
with sails spread She expects to tug us along behind herbut I dont
know Im afraid wed draw heavy Until that time comes however we
lows to lay to in this harbor We feels sheltered Nothing aint
more sheltering than knowing you have a moral right and a dependable
gun

So thats about all Lahoma went on These past four years weve
just been to ourselves with a long journey once a year to the
settlements and all the time I had those sweet thoughts to dream over
about the little family that used to live in the west mountain And
Ive tried to do like Mrs Featherby used to do and be like she was
and if I can make as fine a woman I neednt ask any more Shed been
to Europe too and shed taught school in New England Bill Atkins is
higher up than BrickBill used to know Kit Carson and all those famous
pioneers and hes been most everywhereexcept in settled places
When a boy he saw Sam Houston and ate with him and he has heard David
Crockett with his own earshas heard him say Be sure youre right
then go ahead thats how far BILL has been But it sort of hurt
Bricks neck and even Bills to look up high enough to see where Mrs
Featherby had risen She was like youright out of the big world
She came out here because the family was awful poor Is that why you
left the big world

Wilfred shook his head Im poor enough he said but it wasnt
that It was a girl

Brick Willock explained Hes got a sweetheart hes been carrying her
letters for about two years Hes done spoke for Lahoma staked out
as a fellow might say and squatted on

Lahoma looked at him in breathless interest A girl out in the big
world Completely civilized I reckon Was she as old as I am

Why honey Brick exclaimed uneasily YOU aint got no age at all
to speak of What are you but a mere child This young man is talking
about them as has got up to be old enough to think of
sweetheartingsomething respectable in YEARS

And how old does a sweetheart have to be demanded Lahoma with some
displeasure I feel old enough for anything and Wilfred doesnt look
any older than the knight standing guard in THE TALISMAN Besides
look at David Copperfield and Little Emly

That was childs work retorted Brick

I was afraid of this growled Bill Atkins restlessly

Wilfred laughed out Dont worry My eastern girl is at least
nineteen years old and so thoroughly civilized that she thinks this
part of the world is still overrun with Indians and buffaloes She
wouldnt live out here for a fortune and she wouldnt marry a man back
East without onethats why Im here I didnt have the fortune

Does she LOVE you Wilfred Her voice was so soft her eyes were so
big that Bill uttered a smothered groan and even Brick sat up

She did the last time I saw hercant say how she feels now thats
been about two years ago He spoke lightly but gazing into the
wonderful depths of Lahomas eyes he felt a queer sensation like a
lost heartbeat

Did she send you here as a kind of test

Oh no she told me goodby and we parted forever Both of us were
pooryou cant live in the city if youre poor you can BE poor
there but not LIVE By this time shes found some one with property
I dare sayshes tremendously handsome and accomplished and has a
very distinguishedlooking mother and they have friends in
societyshell make it all right no doubt His voice was
matteroffact even to indifference but for all that he seemed to be
deeply inhaling Lahomas freshness of morningrose sparkling with dew

Does it pierce your heart to think of her marrying somebody else Her
voice was sweet with the dreampassion of a young girl

When I left home I flung myself into the life of a cowpuncher and
did all I could to keep from thinking So my hearts rather callous by
this time I dont seem to mind like I thought I would if I should sit
down to think about it Thats what Ive avoided like the
plaguesitting down to think about it But I believe I could sit down
and think about it now pretty calmly

Then thats what Id do Lahoma cried Id just face it She isnt
worthy of you if shed rather have a fortune than the man she loves
Id just sit down and face it

I will He had never before thought it could be easy It seemed
very easy now

Maybe I could help you Lahoma suggested earnestly When Mrs
Featherby lived near I asked her all about such cases and got her
advice and experience Change of scene and time are the greatest
remedies Youve had both Then you must tell yourself that she isnt
worthy And then youll remind yourself that there are OTHER girls in
the world Then you keep your mind occupiedthat is a great thing
If you come to the cove to visit us we will try to occupy your
mindwont we Brickand Bill

Bill looked at Wilfred glumly Its too occupied now Im afraid

Bill this is agrowing on you Brick expostulated I like the
young chap first rate Hes open and free Bill you are hampering
at times I would go to my dugout if I was you and cool my head

Your headll be hot enough growled Bill when this has gone too
far

Lahoma opened her eyes wide What do you mean she demanded
sincerely perplexed

Bill cried Brick warningly youre agoing to start up a fire where
they aint even been no kindling laid

Wilfred rose hastily I should like dearly to come and come often
he exclaimed but I couldnt force myself where Im not wanted

In that case remarked Bill inflexibly youre seeing me for the
last time and may look your fill

Wilfred smiled at him tolerantly and turned to Willock I ought to go
to my work Brick I wont try to explain what this hour has meant to
me for I believe you understand Im like a man crossing the desert
who finds a spring and gets enough water to last him till the next
oasis

He held out his hand to Lahoma who had risen swiftly at these signs of
departure God bless you little girl he said cheerily A mans
fortunate who finds such oases along his deserttrail

It was not Bills gruffness but Lahomas charm that warned him to flee
lest he break his promise to her guardians

But you cant go yet cried Lahoma not taking his hand there are
a thousand things I want to do with you that Ive never had a chance to
do with anybody elsestrolling for instance Come and strollIll
show you about the cove Brick and Bill dont know anything about
strolling as they do in pictures Hold out your arm with a crook in it
and Ill slip my hand just inside where youll hold it soft and warm
like a bird in its nest Isnt his noble And I holds backexcuse
meI HOLD back my skirts with my other hand and this is the way we
stroll like an engraving out of the history of Louis the Fourteenths
court Do oh do Her bright eyes glowed into his like beckoning
stars

We stroll he gravely announced responding to the pressure of her
fingers but at the same time feeling somewhat guilty as Bill rolled
his eyes fearfully at Brick

When they were a few yards from the trees Lahoma whispered Make for
the other side of Turtle Hill I want to feel grown up when I do my
strolling but Im nothing but a little barefooted kid when Brick and
Bill are looking at me

Hidden by the shoulder of the granite hill island she stopped withdrew
her hand and stood very straight as she said with breathless
eagerness Answer me quick Wilfred aint I old enough to be a
sweetheart

Oh Lahoma he protested warmly please dont think of it Dont be
anybodys untiluntil I say the word You couldnt understand such
matters dear you wouldnt know thethe proper time Ill tell you
when the time comes

She looked at him keenly Am I to wait for a time or for a person
I wish youd never met that girl back East I think youd have filled
the bill for me because having always lived here in the mountains
Ive not learned to be particular Not but what Ive seen lots of
trappers and squatters in my day but I never wanted to stroll with
them I dont see why that eastern girl ever turned you loose from her
trap I think a mans a very wonderful thing especially a young
mandont you Wilfred

Not half so wonderful as you Lahoma His voice vibrated with sudden
intensity Theres your wonderful hair like light shining through a
brown veil  and your eyes where your soul keeps her lights flashing
when all the rest of you is in twilight  and your hands and feet
four faithful little guides to the wonderful treasures that belong only
to maidenhood  and your mouth changing with your thoughtsan
adorable little thermometer showing how high the smiles have risen in
your heart a mouth so pure and sweet

Hey shouted Bill Atkins as he and Brick came around the angle of
the hill Hi there You may call that strolling but if so its
because you dont know its true name if you ask ME

Wilfred came to himself with a sharp indrawing of his breath Yes he
stammered somewhat dizzily Yes II must be going now

She held his hand beseechingly But youll come again wont you
When I hold your hand its like grabbing at a bit of the big world

No Lahoma Im not coming again His look was long and steady
showing sudden purpose which concealed regret beneath a frank smile of
liking

She still held his hand her brown eyes large with entreaty You WILL
come again Wilfred You must come again Dont mind Bill Ill have
a talk with him after youre gone Ill send him over to the ranch
after you Just say youll come again if I send for you

Of course hell come honey said Brick melted by the tears that
sounded in her voice He wont get huffy over a foolish old codger
like Bill Atkins Of course hell come again and tell you about
streetcars and lampposts Let him go to his work now hes been up
all night just to get a word with you Let him gohell come back
tomorrow I know

Wilfred turned to Brick and looked into his eyes as he slowly released
Lahomas hand

Oh said Brick considerably disconcerted No I reckon he wont
come back honeyyes I guess hell be busy the rest of the summer
Well son put er thereshake I like you fine just fine and as
you cant come here to see us no more being so busy andand otherwise
elsewhere boundIm kinder sorry to see you go

Partings said Bill somewhat mollified are painful but necessary
else there wouldnt be any occasion for dentists chairs

Thats so Brick agreed You called Lahoma an oasis And what is
an oasis Something you come up to and go away from and thats the
end of the story You dont settle down and live at a spring just
because it give you a drink when you was thirsty A man goes on his
way rejoicing and Wilfred according

Lahoma walked up to Wilfred with steady eyes Are you coming back to
see me she asked gravely

No Lahoma At least not for a long long time I dont believe its
good for me to forget the life Ive chosen even for a happy hour
When I left the city it was to drop out of the worldnobody knows
what became of me not even my brother Youve brought everything
back and that isnt good for my peace of mind and sogoodbye

Tall and straight he stood like a soldier whose duty it is to face
defeat and standing thus he fastened his eyes upon her face as if to
stamp those features in a last long look upon his heart

Goodby said Lahoma this time she did not hold out her hand Her
face was composed her voice quiet If in her eyes there was the look
of one who has been rebuffed her pride was too great to permit a show
of pain

Wilfred hesitated But what was to be done Solitude and homesickness
had perhaps distorted his vision at any rate he had succumbed to the
folly against which he had been warned He could not accept Lahoma as
a mere child and though during the scene he had repeatedly reminded
himself that she was only fifteen her face her voice her form her
manner of thought refused the limits of childhood Therefore he went
away outwardly wellcontent with his morning but inwardly full of
wrath that his heart had refused the guidance of his mind

And she had been so simple so eager to meet him on an equal plane
even clinging to him as to the only hope in her narrow world that might
draw her out into deeper currents of knowledge

Ive always been a fool he muttered savagely as he sought his
horse I was a fool about Annabeland now Im too big a fool to
enjoy what fortune has fairly flung in my path Presently he began to
laughit was all so ridiculous beating a retreat because he could not
regard a fifteenyearold girl as a little child He drew several
timeworn letters from his pocket and tore them into small bits that
fluttered away like snowflakes on the wind He had no longer a
sentimental interest in them at all events



CHAPTER XII

THE BIG WORLD

He did not come again Lahoma used to go to the hillisland which she
called Turtle Hill because the big flattened rocks looked like turtles
that had crawled up out of the cove to sun themselves among these
turtles she would lie watching the open mouth of the mountain
horseshoe in the vain hope that Wilfred would appear from around the
granite wall Occasionally she descended to the plain and scanned the
level world but it was pleasanter to watch from the cove because one
never knew while in that retreat who might be coming along the range
On the plain there were no illusions

Lahoma courted illusions And when she knew that Wilfred Compton had
severed connections with Old Man Walker she merely exchanged one hope
one dream for another The opportunity to learn about the big world
was withdrawn but the anticipation of one day meeting Wilfred again
was as strong as ever She made no secret of this expectation

Bill Atkins sought to dismiss it effectually You dont know about
the big world Lahoma he declared if you think people meet up with
each other after theyve once lost touch If all this part of America
was blotted out of existence people in the East wouldnt miss any ink
out of the inkbottle

Lahoma tossed her head Maybe the world IS big she conceded But
if Wilfred isnt big enough to make himself seen in it when I go
alooking I dont care whether I meet him again or not When Im in
the big world I expect to deal only with big people

I saw no bigness about HIM Bill cried slightingly

If he isnt big enough to make himself seen Lahoma serenely
returned I wont never

You wont ever Bill corrected

I wont ever have to wear specs for strained eyes Lahoma concluded
smiling at Bill as if she knew why he was as he was and willingly took
him so because he couldnt help himself

It was Brick who heard about Wilfreds adventures on leaving the Red
River ranch and as all three sat outside the cabin in the dusk of
evening he retailed them as gathered from a recent trip to the corral
That was a strange story unfolded to Lahomas ears a story rich with
the romance of the great West wild in its primitive strivings and
thrilling in its realizations of countless hopes The narrative lost
nothing in the telling for Brick Willock understood the people and the
instincts that moved them and though Wilfred Compton might differ from
all in his motives and plans he shared with all the same hardships
the same spur to ambition

It was now ten years since the discovery had been made that in the
western part of Indian Territory were fourteen million acres that had
never been assigned to the red man and which therefore were public
land subject to homestead settlement As long as the western
immigrants could choose among the rich prairielands of Iowa Nebraska
Minnesota Dakota and Kansasand the choice was open to all following
the agreement of the plains tribes to retire to reservationsit was
not strange that the unassigned lands of Indian Territory should have
escaped notice surrounded as they were by the Cherokee Strip the
Osage and Creek countries the Chickasaw Nation the Wichita Cado
Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes

But other public lands were now scarce or less inviting and as far
back as 1879 when Lahoma was five years old colonies had formed in
Kansas City in Topeka and in Texas to move upon the Oklahoma country
The United States troops had dispersed the boomers but in the
following year the indefatigable Payne succeeded in leading a colony
into the very heart of the coveted land It was in order to escape
arrestfor again the United States cavalry had descended on
settlersthat several wagons among them that of Gledwares had
driven hastily toward the Panhandle to come to grief at the hands of
ruffians from NoMans Land

As Brick Willock told of Paynes other attempts to colonize the
Oklahoma country of his arrests of his attempts to bring his various
cases to the trial she felt that Willock was in a way dealing with
her personal history for had she not been named Lahoma in honor of
that country which her stepfather had seen only to loose Time and
again the colonists swarmed over the border finding their way through
Indian villages and along desolate trails to the land that belonged to
the public but was enjoyed only by the great cattlemen as many times
they were driven from their newlyclaimed homes by federal troops not
without severity and their leaders were imprisoned

But at last April the twentysecond 1889 had been appointed as the
day on which the Oklahoma country was to be opened up to settlement
and it was to meet this event that Wilfred Compton had left Greer
County He was a unit in that immense throng that waited impatiently
for the hour of noona countless host stretching along the north on
the boundary of the Cherokee Strip on the south at the edge of the
Cherokee Nation on the east along the Kickapoo and Pottawatomie
reservations and on the west blackening the extremity of the Cheyenne
and Arapaho countries He was one of those who at the discharge of
the carbines of the patrolling cavalrymen joined in the deafening
shout raised by men of all conditions and from almost every state in
the Uniona shout as of triumph over the fulfillment of a tenyears
dream And leaning forward on his pony he was one of the army of
conquest that burst upon the desert on foot on horseback and in
vehicles of every description in the mad rush for homes in a land that
had never known the incense of the hearth or the civilizing touch of
the plow

At noon a wilderness at night a land of tents and on the morrow a
settled country of furrowed fields Pioneer work is awful quick
nowadays grumbled Bill Atkins as Brick concluded It wasnt so in
my time Up there in the Oklahoma country fifty years have been
squeezed into a weeks timeits like a magician making a seed grow
and sprout and blossom right before the audience Lucky I came to
Greer County TexasI dont guess ITLL ever be anything but sand and
a blow

Its a great story Brick declared with enthusiasm I reckon its
the greatest story that America can put out in the pioneering line
There they had everything in twentyfour hours that used to wear out
our ancestors Injuns unbroken land no sign of life for hundreds of
milesand just a turn of the hand and cities is acoming up out of the
ground and saloons and churches is rubbing shoulders and theres talk
of getting out newspapers What do you think of it honey

Lahoma was sitting in grave silence her hands clasped in her lap She
turned slowly and looked at Willock Brick Im disappointed

Which asked Willock somewhat taken aback Where

In himin Wilfred

As how so

Going into that wildernesslife instead of taking his place in the
world

Well honey if he hadnt come to THIS wilderness youd never of saw
him

Yesbut he wasnt settled and now hes settled in it Is that the
way to be a man Theres all those other people to do the thing hes
doing Then whats the use of him

Aint we in the same box

Yes and thats why I mean to get out of it some day But its
different with him Hes chosen his box and gone in and shut the lid
on himself Im disappointed in him Ive been thinking him a real
man I guess Im still to see what Im looking for added Lahoma
shaking her head

Well let it go at that muttered Bill who was anxious to turn
Lahomas mind from thoughts of Wilfred Well just go ahead and look
for new prospects

Not till I make a remark said Willock laying aside his pipe
Honey do yon know what I mean by a vision It calls for a big vision
to take in a big person and you aint got it Maybe it wasnt meant
for women or at least a girl of fifteen to see further than her own
foottracks so no blame laid and nobody judged according If you
dont see nothing in that army of settlers going into a raw land and
falling to work to make it bloom like the rose asetting out to live
in solitude for years that in due time the world may be richer by a
great territory why you aint got a big vision Ive got it for I
was born in the West and Ive lived all my life peaceable and calm
right out here or hereabouts Youve got to breathe western air to get
the big vision Youve got to see towns rise out of the turf over
night and bust into cities before the harvestfields is ripe to know
what can be did when men is free not hampered by setandbound rules
as holds em down to the ways of their fathers Back East folks is
straining themselves to make over and improve and polish up what they
found readytohandbut here out West we creates It takes a big
vision to see the bigness of the West and you cant get no true idee
by squinting at the subject

Lahoma did not reply and Bill feared that under the conviction of her
friends eloquence she had begun to idealize the efforts of Wilfred
Compton He need not have been afraid To her imagination big
people were not living in dugouts or tents far from civilization
big people were going to the opera every night and riding in
splendid carriages along imposing boulevards every day Brick and Bill
had contrived to live as well as they desired from profits on skins
obtained in the mountains and the small tract of ground they had
cultivated in a desultory manner had done little beyond supplying
themselves with vegetables and the horses with some extra feed She
had no great opinion of agriculture and though she had taken part in
planting and hoeing with a pleasurable zest she had never entertained
herself with the thought that she was engaged in a great work As to
dugouts they had no place in her dreams of the future Since Wilfred
had chosen to handicap himself with the same limitations that bound
her even the thought of him was to be banished from her world
banished absolutely

Her daydreams did not cease but became more dreamy more unreal
since the hero of her fancies for whom she now had no fleshandblood
prototype was suggested only by her moods and her books As the
sunclear days of maidenhood melted imperceptibly into summer glow and
winter spaces the memory of Wilfreds face and voice sometimes
surprised her at unexpected turns of solitary musings But the face
grew less defined the voice lost its distinctive tone as the years
passed uninterruptedly by

I reckon it aint right said Brick Willock to Bill Atkins as they
went one morning to examine their traps before Lahoma was astir to
keep our little gal to ourselves as were doing Youre getting old
Bill awful old

Well damn it growled Bill I guess I dont have to be told

You aint very long for this world Bill not in the ordinary course
of nature And when Ive laid you to rest under the rockpile Lahoma
aint going to find the variety in me that she now has in the two of
us Besides which Im in the fifties myself and them is halves of
hundreds

Yes Bill growled and give Lahoma time shell die too Nothing
but the mountainll be left to look out on the plains Lord Brick who
do you reckonll be living in that cove when we three are dead and
gone

Guess Ill be worrying about something else then

Do you reckon pursued Bill in an unwonted tone of mellowness that
those who come to live in our dugout will ever imagine what happy hours
weve passed there just sitting around quiet and enjoying ourselves
and one another

They wouldnt imagine YOU was enjoying of yourself not if they was
feeding their eyes on you every day But Im awful bothered about
Lahoma I tell you it aint right to keep her shut up as in a cage
Cant you see shes pining for high society such as I aint got it in
me to supply and you are too cussed obstinate to display

I guess thats so Bill drew himself stiffly up by the tree
abovethey were ascending the wooded gully that extended from base to
mountaintop

Well whats the hurry Shes only seventeen years old

Yes she was only seventeen years old two years ago but shes
nineteen now

Bill Atkins sank upon a rock at the foot of a bristling cedar
Nineteen Who LAHOMA Then whereve I been all the time

Youve been atraveling along at a pretty fast clip toward your last
days thats where youve been Just look at yourself Aint you
always careful in making your steps as if scared of breaking something
And now youre out of breath

It was knocked out by the thought of her being so oldbut I guess
youre right Well I wouldnt call her life cagedup The settlers
have been moving in pretty steadily and she has friends amongst all
the families where theres womenfolks She has her own pony and is
gone more than suits me and although theres no young man disposable
we aint fretting about that nor her neither

I used to think she might be foolish about Wilfred Comptonbut
Lahoma she aint foolish about nothing Nevertheless Bill it aint
right Settlers is settlers and what she yearns for is the big world
I would long since of took her out to see it but dassnt from a
liability to be catched up for divers deeds that was unlawfully charged
to me in times past You could have guided her along the city trails
but was too cussed obstinate

Shes your cousin retorted Bill and it wasnt for me to act her
guardian Besides did you want to lose her You couldnt take Lahoma
where shed be seen and known and expect to get her back again Maybe
it isnt exactly fair to keep her boarded upbut the times are
changing all that and sorry am I to see it Do you know Brick I
once thought you and me and Lahoma could just live here in the cove
till time was no more reading our books and smoking our pipes and
taking peaceful morning trips like thisto see whether wed caught a
coyote in our traps or a bobcat or a skunk

Yes thats all right for us but Lahoma aint smoking no pipe nor is
her interest in skunks such as ours

Just sobut see how Greer County is getting settled upthats whats
going to save us Brickcivilization is coming to Lahoma she wont
have to go out gunning after it

Of course Ive thought of that I aint got your grammar but my mind
dont have to wait to let in an idea after its put its clothes on
Maybe they comes in nothing but a nightshirt but I aint ever knowed
YOU to think of nothing yet that I hadnt entertained in some fashion
Of course civilization is acreeping up to the mountain and I reckon
by the time Lahoma is my age itll be playing an organ in church But
shes at the age that calls for quick workshes got the rest of her
life to settle down in Most all of a persons life is spent in
settling and its befitting to lay in the foundation aforetime Look
at that dear girl in The Children of the Abbey all them lovepassages
and the tears she shedsshe was being a young woman What would that
noble book of been had that lovely creature been shut up in a cove till
nineteen year of age Is Lahoma going to have a chance like that
amongst these settlers Will she ever hear that high talk that makes
your flesh sort of creep with pride in your race when you read it
aloud

Do you want Lahoma to have a lover Brick Willock

Bill if he is fit I say she ought to have a chance

And where are you going to find the man

Im going to help Lahoma find him Im like you Bill I hates that
lover like a snake this minute though I aint no idea who where or
what he is or may be I hates himbut I aint going to stand in
Lahomas way No sir I low to meet civilization halfway There it
islook

Willock stood erect and pointed toward the plain where perhaps twenty
tents had been pitched within the last two weeks Bill gave an
unwilling glance shrugged his shoulders disdainfully and resumed
progress up the difficult defile

Willock continued Two weeks ago there wasnt nothing there but
naked sand Now theres three saloons a hardware store a grocery a
bankall of em under canvasand the makings of a regular town Right
out there in the broiling sun Carloads of lumber and machinery is on
its way and the stagecoach will be putting off mail there before
long Thats how civilization is aseeking out our little gal But I
means to meet it halfway

Oh come on dont say anything more about itwhen I look at those
tents I cant breathe freely What do you gamble ona skunk or a
coyote in the traps

Taint them tents thats seeping your breath its pure unalloyed
age Yes sir I means to meet civilization halfway Ive already
been prospecting Theres a party over there in Tent City thats come
on from Chicago just from the lust of seeing pioneerlife at first
hand people that havent no idee of buying or settlingits a picnic
to them Theyre camping out watching life developand whats
lifeanddeath earnestness to others is just amusement to them That
theres a test of people highup Real folks in the big world dont do
nothing it takes all their time just being folks You and me could bag
a dozen polecats whilst a fine lady was making her fingernails ready
for the day And these Chicago people is that kind

Do you think theyll make friends with Lahoma just to suit you The
kind of people youre talking about are more afraid of getting to know
strangers than they are of being set on by wildcats

Theyll make friends with Lahoma all right and invite her home with
em Thats the way I low to set her out in the big world Lahoma
dont know my plans and neither do they but I was never a man to make
my plans knowed when I was going to hold up people Of course IM
speaking in a figger but in a figger I may say Ive held up several
in my day

THEY wont invite Lahoma to Chicago not if they are the right sort

They will invite Lahoma to Chicago retorted Willock firmly and
they are the right sort Wait and see and when you have saw render
due honor to your Uncle Brick



CHAPTER XIII

A SUREENOUGH MAN

Pardner I sure am glad to see youput er there again How are you
feeling anyhow Look mighty tough and wiry I do say Here Bill
Willock raised his voice to a powerful shout Bill come and see
whats blowed in with the tumbleweed and ticklegrass A sureenough
man thats what I call him and me to fight if any disputes made to
the title according

The tall bronzed man who was leading his horse along the road entering
the mountain horseshoe smiled with a touch of gravity in the light of
his gray eyes Willock found his chin more resolute his glance more
assured and penetrating while his step firm and alert told of
dauntless purpose He was no longer the wandering cowboy content with
a bed on the ground wherever chance might find him at night but a
mature man who had taken root in the soil of his own acres Only
twentyfive or six his features were still touched with the last
lingering mobility of youth but the set of his mouth and the gleam of
his eyes hinted at years of battle against storms droughts and
loneliness He was already a veteran of the prairie despite his youth

Everything looks very natural murmured Wilfred Compton gazing about
on the seamed walls of granite in whose crevices the bright cedars
mocked at winters threatening hand

Yes mountains is lots more natural than humans They just sets there
serene and indifferent not caring whether you likes their looks or not
and they let er blow and let er snow its all one to them I reckon
when weve been dead so long that nobody could raise a dispute as to
whether wed ever lived or not that there same boulder what they calls
Rocking Stone will still be amaking up its mind whether to roll down
into the valley or stay where it was born Wilfred if you knowed how
glad I am to see you again youd be sort of scared I reckon thinking
youd fell amongst cannibals Wonder where that aged trapper is He
shouted more lustily and a bristling white head suddenly appeared on
the summit of Turtle Hill

Great Scott yelled Bill Atkins glaring down upon the approaching
figure if it aint Wilfred Compton again Come on come on I was
never as glad to see anybody in all my life

The young man looked at Willock somewhat dubiously Hes very much
altered then since I met him last Im afraid he has a gun hidden up
there among the rocks

Oh nux nux retorted Willock Hes aspeaking fair Come along

As they ascended the winding road Wilfred vividly recalled the day
when from the same elevation he had watched Lahoma buried in her
daydreams A sudden turn brought the cove into view Lahoma was not
to be seen but there was the cabin the dugout and the three cedar
trees in whose shade he had made the discovery that he could not regard
Lahoma as a little girl It seemed that the cabin door trembledwas
Lahomas hand upon the latch And when she opened the door what
expression would flash upon that face he remembered so well Would she
be as glad as Willock and Bill Atkins when she recognized him Even
one half as glad

He sighed deeplyit was not to be expected She had known him only an
hour since then many settlers had invaded the country about the
Granite Mountains a city had sprung up not far awayother towns were
peeping through the sand and blooming from canvas to wood and brick
The air tingled with the electric currents of new life and intense
competition

Did Lahoma marry he asked abruptly as all three descended to the
lower level of the cove

She never did yet replied Bill dryly Young man Im powerful
glad to see you Its rather chilly out here Ill take your horse
and well gather in the dugout and talk over whats happened since we
last met Brick dont you begin on anything interesting till I come

You give me that horse retorted Brick Youre too aged a man to be
messing with horses Youll get a fall one of these days thatll lay
you flat Youll never knit them bones together if you do you aint
vital enough

Bill clung grimly to the bridle muttering something that showed no
lack of vitality in his vocabulary

He wont let me take no care of him complained Brick as he
conducted Wilfred to the dugout

Wilfred cast a longing glance toward the cabin and again he thought
Lahomas parlor door quivered He even stopped in the path but
Willock went on unconscious and he was obliged to follow

Its a strange thing remarked Brick as he descended the hard dirt
steps how Lahoma has acted on me I mean living with her these past
twelve years and all the rest of the world shut out except Bill
Could I of been told before I saved little Lahoma from the highwaymen
that Id ever worry over an old coon like Bill Atkins as to whether he
broke his neck or not Id a laughed for Id a had to But it
sure does gall me to have him exposing himself as he does I never
wanted Bill to come here but he just come like a stray cat First
thing I knowed he was apurring at the firesidewell not exactly
apurring nuther but sort of mewing and looking ready to scratch
He just took up with us and now its like always being scared to close
a door for fear of catching his tail in the jambIm talking in a
figger Come in pardthis used to be Lahomas boudoir before we
built that cabin for her See the carpet Dont tell ME youre
awalking on it and not noticing See that little stove I brung it
clear across the mountains from a deserted wagon when I was young
Two legs is gone and its squatbellied and smokes if the wind gives
it a chance but I wouldnt trade it for a new one Set on this bench
I recollect as well as if it us yesterday Lahoma asetting there with
her legs untouching of the floor learning A and B and asking
thousands of questions and getting herself civilized I couldnt do a
finished job but Bill took her by the hand later then a Mrs
Featherby what moved over in the west mountain added stores from New
England and travels in Europe When the settlers come she gleaned all
they knowed always arising and alooking out for new country Thats
a wonderful girl he added with conviction

When Bill came they sat about the stove the light from the famous
window bringing out with clear distinctness Bricks huge form and
bristling beard Bills thin figure surmounted by its shock of white
hair and Wilfreds handsome grave face and splendidly developed
physique It was so warm below the ground that the fire in the stove
was maintained at the lowest state possible but when the western light
quickly vanished from the window the glowing coals gave homely cheer
to the crude room

In answer to their questioner Wilfred told of his experiences on his
quartersection how he had broken the prairie land put in his crops
watched them wither away in the terrible dry months roughed it through
the winters tried again fought through another drought staked all on
the next springs planting raised a halfcrop paid off his chattel
mortgage tried againsucceeded

Ive stayed right with it he said gravely looking from one to the
other as they smoked in silence their eyes on his animated face Of
course they required me to stay on the land only during certain
months every year But I stayed with it all the time and I studied
it and when I failed as I did year after year I failed each time in
a different way because I learned my lesson And when Id walled off
the cause of each failure one by one seemed like there opened before
me a broad clear way that led right into the goal Id been seeking from
the first day Then I closed out all my deals and looked and saw that
everything was trim and ready for winterand got my horse and started
for Greer County

And glad we are cried Bill Atkins I hope you can stay a long
time

That depends  Lahoma is well I suppose

The picture of healthwhen she left Brick declared admiringly and
the prettiest little gal this side of the angels When the early
sunlight peeps over the mountain and laughs at the cove thats sulking
from thinking its about to be left out in the days doingsthats
like Lahomas smile And when you get down sick as I done once from
causes incidental to being made of flesh and blood and she come and
laid her hand on my burning forehead her touch always made me think of
an angels wing somehow although I aint never set up to be
religious and I think of such things as little as may beexcept when
Bill draws me to the subject from seeing him so puny at times

Lahomas not here Wilfred asked anxiously

Not now nor for some time answered Brick

I wish interposed Bill glumly that when youre going to talk about
me Brick youd begin with Bill and not be dragging me in at the
tailend of what concerns other people I reckon Wilfred you just
traveled here to take a look at the country where you used to herd
cattle

That wasnt my reason Principally I wanted to see Lahoma and
incidentally my brother

Your brother HE aint in these parts is he

No ruefully but I expected him to be When I left home to turn
cowpuncher I didnt tell anybody where Id gone but just before I
left for Oklahoma to turn farmer I wrote to my brother And about a
month ago seeing things clearing up before me I asked him to meet me
here at Tent Cityhes interested in new towns hes employed by a
rich man to plant hardwarestores and I thought he might find an
opening here He came on and was here several weeks with a party of
sightseers from Chicago but he left with them about a week ago

Willock sat suddenly erect Couldnt have been that Sellimer crowd I
reckon from Chicago

YesMrs Sellimer and her daughter and some of their friends

Willock whistled loudly And that upanddown looking chap in the
gold noseglasses was your brother

Never thought of that Bill exclaimed although he had your namehe
looked so different But now that youve laid aside your cowboy
rigging I guess you could sit in his class down at the bottom of it

Willock was uneasy I was told he observed and I took the trouble
to get datty on the subject that them Sellimersthe mother and
daughter and the herd they drift withis of the highest pedigree
Chicago can produce It sort of jolts me to find out that anybody we
know is kin to the bunch

Wilfred laughed without bitterness Dont let my kinship to brother
Edgerton disturb your ideal Were so different that we parted without
saying goodby and although I had the weakness to imagine we might
patch up old differences if we could meet here in the desert I suppose
wed have fallen out in a day or twowere so unlike And as to Miss
SellimerAnnabel Sellimershe is the girl whose letters I was
carrying about with me when I first saw you She refused me because I
was as poor as herself so you see the whole bunch is out of my class

Thats good Willocks face cleared up Mind you I aint saying
that as for me and Bill wed wouldnt rather sit with you in a dugout
than with them in a palace on Lake Michigan But its all a matter of
getting Lahoma out into the big world and you gave me a terrible jolt
scaring me that after all wed made a mistake and they was just of
your plain everyday cloth

Wilfred moved uneasily Has Lahoma made their acquaintance then

It looks like it dont it

What looks like it Wilfred asked with sudden sharpness

Why her going off with em to spend the winter in high life

Thats why I was so glad to see you Bill explained her being gone
and us so lonesome Thats why Id like to have you stay with us a
long timeuntil she comes back if it suits you

But I thought But I came here to see Lahoma cried Wilfred
unable to conceal his disappointment I thought as I came up the road
that I saw her halfopening the cabindoor

That was Red Feather taking a peep at you Hes the Indian that
brought Lahoma to Willock as a child He comes about once a year to
see us but this time he was a little too late for Lahoma Yes shes
gone Easttheyre all putting up in Kansas City just now on their way
to Chicago

Son said Willock puffing steadily at his pipe why did you want to
see Lahoma

Wellyou know she was just a child when I was here before but shes
hovered before my mind a good dealIve been too busy to seek the
acquaintance of strangersjust want to keep the few I know He blew a
rueful breath You cant think how all my aircastles have fallen
about my ears I wanted to see Lahoma Yes I wanted to see how shed
turned out I have a good farm now not very far from Oklahoma City
and Well being alone there year after year a fellow gets to
imagining a great many things He stopped abruptly

Thats so Willock agreed sympathetically I aint asaying that if
Lahomad been like me and Bill she mightnt of liked farming with you
firstclass But she was born as an associate of high men and women
not cows and chickens Its the big world for her and thats where
shes gone Shes with real folks Be Mr Edgerton Compton your
brother or be he not you cant imagine him setting down with us
sociable in this dugout Youre right about his being different And
the fact that Miss Sellimer turned you down is encouraging too It
shows you couldnt run in her course you didnt have the speed I
guess we aint made no mistake after ail

There was silence broken presently by BillIm glad youve come
sure

Presently the door opened and the Indian chief glided into the
apartment with a grunt of salutation He spread his blanket in a
corner and sat down turning a stolid face to the fire

Dont pay no attention to him remarked Willock as if speaking of
some wild animal He comes and goes and isnt troublesome if you
feeds and sleeps him and dont try to lay your hand on him

Bill Atkins rose But _I_ always light up when he comes he
remarked reaching stiffly for a lantern which in due time glimmered
from the partition wall Are you hungry Wilfred We never feed till
late it gives us something to sleep on I lie awake pretty constantly
all night anyhow and when I eat late my stomach sorter keeps me
company

Wilfred declared that he was not in the least hungry

Im afraid youre disappointed son observed Willock filling his
pipe anew

Wilfred turned to him with a frank smile Brickits just awful
Its what comes from depending on something youve no right to consider
a sure thing I never thought of this cove without Lahoma in it
didnt seem like it could be so empty How did she get acquainted
with Annabeland with my brother

It come about son I see at once that the bunch of em was from the
big world I come home and told Bill Thems the people to tow Lahoma
out into life says I So they invited her to spend the winter with
them the Sellimers did and show her city doings

Yesbut how did it come about

Nothing more natural I goes over to their tent and I tells them of
the curiosities and good points of these mountains and gets em to
come on a sort of picnic to explore So here they comes and they gets
scattered what with Bill and Lahoma and me taking different waysthey
liked Lahoma first time they see her as a matter of course And so
that Miss Sellimer she gets separated from all the rest and I shows
her a dandy hidingplace where nobody couldnt find her and I shows
her what a good joke it would be to pretend to be lost So I leaves
her there to go to tell her crowd she dares em to find her Are you
listening

Of course

Well while she was setting there waiting to be searched for of a
sudden a great big Injun in a blanket and feathers and red paint jumps
down beside her and grabs her and picks her up and about as quick as
she knew anything she was gagged and bound and being bore along
through the air I reckon it was a terrible moment for her Now there
is a crevice in the top of the mountain that nobody dont never
explore because its just a crack in the rock that aint to be climbed
out of without a ladder So the Injun carries her there and lets her
down with a rope that it seems he must of had handy somewheres and he
puts out and there she is in a holler in the mountain not able to
move or cry out no more than if shed been captured by a regular
highwayman

Wilfred stared at Willock in complete bewilderment Willock chuckled

There was a terrible time remarked Bill

Dark was acoming on before the party got plumb scared Willock
continued but they brushed and combed that mountain looking for the
poor lost lady and as I tells em shes ahiding apurpose they think
it a pore sort of joke till midnight catches em mighty serious
Torches is carried here and there and everywhere but no use You
would think that the next day the crowd would naturally look down in
that crevice but thats because Ive posted you up on where she is
Theres lots of other crevices and no reason as they can see why Miss
Sellimer should take the trouble to worm herself down into any of
emand as nobody saw that Injun how could they suspicion foul play
It must of been AWFUL for pore Miss Sellimer all bound and gagged in
that horrible way but it takes heroic treatment to get some curesand
so Lahoma went with em to spend the winter

But the Indian

Neednt think about HIM no more son we got no more use for THAT
Injun Well on the next day Lahoma is looking everywhere being
urged on by me and lo and behold when she comes to that
crevicelooked like she couldnt be induced to go there of her own
will but it was brung about finallywhat does she see but a tomahawk
lying right at the edge what must have been dropped there recent or
the crowd would have saw it the day before It come to her that Miss
Sellimer is a prisoner down below She looks but its too dark to see
nothing Not telling nobody for fear of starting up false hopes she
gets a light and lowers itand there is that miserable young woman
bound and gagged and her pretty dress all tore Lahoma jumps to her
feet to raise the cry when she discovers a ladder under a boulder
which the Injun must have put there meaning to descend to his victim
when the coast was clear Down she skins and frees Miss Sellimer
whos half dead poor young lady Lahoma comes up the ladder and meets
me and I carries her out just like a featherWell cant you imagine
the rest I reckon if Miss Sellimer lives a thousand years shell
never forget the awfulness of that big Injun and the angel sweetness of
the little gal that saved her Why if Lahoma had asked for the rings
off her fingers she could have had em diamonds and all

Wilfred rose and went to stare at the darkness from the small square
window Not a word was spoken for some time At last the silence was
broken by the Indian UGH grunted Red Feather

Just so remarked Wilfred with exceeding dryness

What are you thinking Wilfred demanded Brick Willock

Id have thought Lahoma would recognize the ladder

So she done but couldnt the Injun have stole my ladder and carried
it to that boulder Just as soon as Miss Sellimer was well enough to
travel NOTHING couldnt hold her in these parts and thats why your
brother had to leave before seeing youhes setting to Miss Sellimer
and if Lahoma dont git him away from her I reckon hes a goner

Bill Atkins spoke vaguely It wasnt none of my doings

Wilfred looked steadily at Willock What about your whiskers

Oh as to them it was like old times you takes a cloth and cuts it
outpainted redPsha What are we talking of Bill lets show him
her letterwhat do you say

I reckon it wouldnt hurt Bill conceded

Howd you like it Wilfred We cant produce our little gal to keep
you company but her letter would sort of be like hearing her talk
wouldnt it And if you stay with us a spell well let you read em
as they come

Wilfred perceived that Willock was anxious to get his mind off the
harrowing adventure of the crevice and as he was eager to hear the
letter and as Brick and Bill were anxious to hear it again nothing
more was said about the big Injun

Wholl read it asked Bill as he drew the precious letter from the
strong box behind the stove

Let Wilfred do the deed Willock suggested It travels slow in my
company and though Bill reads er correct he does considerable
droning I expect if Wilfred reads it with unction itll sound like a
new document

Wilfred drew the only stool in the room up beside the lantern and Bill
and Brick disposed themselves on the bench each holding his pipe on
his knee as if fearful of losing a word Red Feather his beady eyes
fastened on the young mans face sat gracefully erect apparently
alert to all that was going on The lantern reddened the strong
cleancut face of the young man and touched the upturned pages to the
whiteness of snow A sudden wind had sprung up and the flaring blaze
from the open stovedoor touched to vivid distinctness the giant the
old man and the Indian Brick closed the stovedoor and the sudden
gloom brought out in mellow effect Wilfreds animated face the dull
yellow wall against which his sturdy shoulder rested and the letter in
his hand



CHAPTER XIV

WRITING HOME

Dear Brick and Bill

I dont know what to tell first Its all so strange and grandthe
people are just people but the things are wonderful The people want
it to be so they act and think according to the things around them
They pride themselves on these things and on being amongst them and I
am trying to learn to do that too When I lived in the coveit seems
a long long time agomy thoughts were always away from dirtfloors
and cookstoves and cedar logs and washpans But the people in the
big world keep their minds tied right up to such thingsonly the
things are finerthey are marble floors and magnificent restaurants
and houses on what they call the best streets At meals there are
all kinds of little spoons and forks and they think to use a wrong one
is something dreadful that is why I say the forks and spoons seem more
important than THEY are but they want it to be so

They have certain ways of doing everything and just certain times for
doing them and if you do a wrong thing at a right time or a right
thing at a wrong time it shows you are from the West At first I
couldnt say a word or turn around without showing that I was from
the West But although Ive been from home only a few days Im
getting so that nobody can tell that Im more important than the
furniture around me Im trying to be just like the one Im with and
I dont believe an outsider can tell that I have any more sense than
the rest of them

Miss Sellimer is so nice to me I told her right at the start that I
didnt know anything about the big world and she teaches me
everything Id be more comfortable if she could forget about my
saving her life but she never can and is so grateful it makes me feel
that Im enjoying all this on false pretenses for you know my finding
her was only an accident Her mother is very pleasant to memuch more
so than to her Bill you know how you speak to your horse sometimes
when it acts contrary Thats the way Miss Sellimer speaks to her
mother at times However they dont seem very well acquainted with
each other Of course if theyd lived together in a cove for years
theyd have learned to tell each other their thoughts and plans but
out in the big world there isnt time for anything except to dress and
go

Im learning to dress I used to think a girl could do that to please
herself but no the dresses are a thousand times more important than
the people inside them It wouldnt matter how wise you are if your
dress is wrong nor would it matter how foolish if your dress is like
everybody elses A person could be independent and do as she pleased
but she wouldnt be in society And nobody would believe she was
independent they would just think she didnt know any better or was
poor Because they dont know anything about being independent they
want to be governed by their things A poor person isnt cut off from
society because he hasnt money but because he doesnt know how to
deal with high things not having practised amongst them It isnt
because society people have lots of money that they stick together but
because all of them know what to do with the little forks and spoons

It is like the dearest jolliest kind of game to me to be with these
people and say just what they say and like what they like and act as
they actand thats the difference between me and them its not a
game to them its deadly earnest They think theyre LIVING

Do you think I could play at this so long that one day Id imagine I
was doing what God had expected of me when he sent me to you Brick
Could I stay out in the big world until Id think of the cove as a
cramped little pocket in the wilderness with two pennies jingling at
the bottom of it named Brick and Bill If I thought there was any
danger of that Id start home in the morning

We are in a Kansas City hotel where all the feathers are in ladies
hats and bonnets instead of in the gentlemens hair To get to our
rooms you go to a dark little door and push something that makes a bell
ring and then you step into a dugout on pulleys that shoots up in the
air so quick it makes you feel a part of you has fallen out and got
lost The dugout doesnt slow up for the third story it just stops
THAT QUICKthey call it an elevator and it certainly does elevate
You step out in a dim trail where there are dusky kinds of lights
although it may be the middle of the day and you follow the trail over
a narrow yellow desert turn to your right and keep going till you
reach a door with your number on it When you are in your room you
see the things that are considered more important than the people

Theres an entire room set apart for the sole purpose of bathingand
the room with the bed in it is separate from the sittingroom You can
go in one and stay a while and go in another and stay a while and
then go in the thirdand you have a different feeling for each room
that youre in Id rather see everything at once as I can in my
cabin And that bed If my little bed at home could be brought here
and set up beside this hotel wonder the very walls would cry out
I wish I could sleep in my little bed tonight and hear the wind
howling over the mountain

The diningroom is the finest thing I ever saw I doubt if the kings
and queens of old times ever ate in richer surroundings There are rows
of immense mirrors along the wall and gold bordersand then the
tables I wonder what would happen if anybody should spread newspapers
on one of these wonderful tables and use them for a tablecloth At
home we can just reach out and take what we want off the stove and
help our plates without rising Its so different here After youve
worried over crooked lists of things to eat that youve never heard of
and have hurried to select so the waiter wont have to lose any time
the waiter goes away And when he puts something before you you dont
know what to call it because its been so long youve forgotten its
name on that awful pasteboard But theres something pleasant when
youve finished in just getting up and walking away not caring who
cleans up the dishes

Ive been to the operahouse but it wasnt an opera it was a play
That houseI wish you could see itthe inside I mean for outside
it looks like it needs washing The chairswell if you sent that
stool of ours to a university you couldnt train it up to look anything
like those operachairs And the dressesthe diamonds Everything
was perfectly lovely except what we had come to see and my party
thought it was too funny for anything but it wasnt funny to me The
story they acted was all about a young couple fooling their parents and
getting married without father and mother knowing and a baby brought
in at the last that nobody would claim though it was said to be
somebodys that shouldnt have had onethe audience just screamed with
laughter over that I thought they never would quiet down Out in The
big world babies and old fathers and mothers seem to be jokes The
star of the evening was a married actress with Miss before her name
You could hear every word she spoke but the others didnt seem to try
to make themselves plainI guess thats why they arent stars too

Ive lived more during the last week than I had the previous
fiftyone We must have been to everything there is except a church
Yesterday was Sunday and I asked Mrs Sellimer about it but she said
people didnt go to church any more

Maybe you wonder why I dont tell you about our crowd but I guess
its because I feel as if they didnt matter I wouldnt say that to
anybody in the world but to you Brick and Bill and if I hadnt
promised to write you every single thing I wouldnt even tell you
because they are so good to me It sounds untrue to them doesnt it
But you wont tell anybody because youve nobody to tell And
besides they could be different in a minute if they wanted to be it
isnt as if they were helpless

Miss Sellimer is witty and talented and from the way she treats me I
know she has a tender heart And her mother is a perfect wonder of a
manager and never makes mistakes except such as happen to be the fad
of the hour And Mr Edgerton Compton could be splendid for he seems
to know everything and when we travel with him or go to the parks and
all that people do just as he says as if he were a prince he has a
magnificent way of showering money on porters and waiters and cabmen
that is dazzling and he holds himself perfectly WITHOUT TRYING and
dresses so that you are glad youre with him in a crowd he knows what
to do ALL the time about EVERYTHING But there he stops I mean he
isnt trying to do anything that matters Neither are any of the rest

What they are working at now is all they expect to work at as long as
they liveand it takes awfully hard work to keep up with their set
They call it keeping in the swim and let me tell you what it reminds
me ofa strong young steer out in a tank using all the strength he
has just to keep on top of the water instead of swimming to shore and
going somewhere Society people dont go anywhere they use all their
energy staying right where they are and if one of them loses grip and
goes underGOODNESS

I know what Mrs Sellimer has set her heart on because she has
already begun instructing me in her ideals She wants her daughter to
marry a rich man and Mr Edgerton Compton isnt rich he only looks
like he is Mrs Sellimer feels that shes terribly poor herself
its the kind of poverty that has all it wants to eat and wear but
hasnt as many horses and servants as it wants Its just as hard on
her as it would be on you if the bacon gave out and you couldnt go for
more Annabelthats Miss Sellimerlikes Mr Compton very very
much but she feels like her mother about marrying a rich man and I
dont think he has much chance One trouble is that he thinks he must
marry a rich girl so they just go on loving each other and looking
about for chances

I feel like I oughtnt to be wasting my time telling about my friends
when there are all these wonderful lights and carpets and decorations
and conveniences so much more interesting Whenever you want hot
water instead of bringing a bucketful from the spring and building a
fire and sitting down to watch it simmer you just turn a handle and
out it comes smoking and whenever you want icewater you touch a
button and give a boy ten cents

The funny thing to me is that Annabel and Mr Compton both think they
HAVE to marry somebody rich or not marry at all They really dont
know they COULD marry each other because imagining they would be
unable to keep the wolf from the door Thats because they cant
imagine themselves living behind anything but a door on one of the
best streets We know dont we Brick and Bill that it takes
mighty little to keep the coyote from the dugout And theres
something else we know that these people havent dreampt ofthat
theres happiness and love in many and many a dugout I dont know
whats behind the doors on the best streets

We are not going straight on to Chicago A gentleman has invited the
Sellimers which of course includes me to a houseparty in the country
not far from Kansas City He is a very rich man of middle age so they
tell me a widower who is interested in our sex and particularly in
Annabel Sellimer Mr Edgerton Compton isnt invited You see hes a
sort of rivala poor rival This middleaged man has known the
Sellimers a long time and he has been trying to win Annabel for a year
or two If it hadnt been for Mr Compton shed have married HIS HOUSE
before now I gather The house is said to be immense in a splendid
estate near the river I am all excitement when I think of going there
for ten days There are to be fifty guests and the other fortynine
are invited as a means of getting Annabel under his roof Wont I feel
like a little girl in an old English novel The best of it is that
nobody will bother MEIm too poor to be looked at a second time I
mean what THEY call poor Sometimes I laugh when Im alone for I
feel like Im a gold mine filled with rich ore that nobody has
discovered Remember the fools gold we used to see among the granite
mountains I think the gold that lies on the surface must always be
fools gold The name of the countryhouse we are to visit is the same
as that of the man who owns it

Wilfred Compton held the letter closer to the light

Brick Willock spoke impatiently No use to stare at that there
wordwe couldnt make it out I guess she got it wrong first then
wrote it over Just go ahead

Bill suggested I think the first letter is an S

Wilfred scrutinized the name closely

Besides said Willock we knows none of them high people the name
wouldnt be nothing to usand her next letter will likely have it
moren once

Wilfred resumed the letter I must tell you goodby now for
Annabels maid has come to help me dress for dinner and it takes
longer than it did to do up the washing at the cove and is more
tiresome But I like it I like these fine soft beautiful things
I like the big world and I would like to live in it forever and ever
if you could bring the dugout and be near enough for me to run in any
time of the day I wish I could run in this minute and tell you the
thousands and thousands of things Ill never have time to write

Your loving adoring halfhomesick halfbewildered somewhat dizzy
little girl

Lahoma

P S Nobody has been able to tell from word or look of mine that I
have ever been surprised at a single thing I have heard or seen You
may be quite sure of that


I bet you cried Willock admiringly NOW what do you think of it

She wont be there long remarked Bill waving his arm till she
finds out what I learned long agothat theres nothing to it If you
want to cultivate a liking for a dugout just live a while in the open

I dont know as to that Willock said I sorter doubts if Lahoma
will ever care for dugouts again except as she stays on the outside of
em and gets to romancing A mouthful of real icecream spoils your
taste everlasting for frozen starch and raw eggs

Lahoma is a real person declared Bill and a dugout is grounded and
bedded in a real thingthis very solid and very real old earth if you
ask to know what I mean

Lord _I_ knows what you mean retorted Willock Youve lived in a
hole in the ground most of your life and are pretty near ripe to be
laid away in another one smaller I grant you but dark and deep
according Well never get Lahoma back the same as when we let her
flutter forth hunting a green twig over the face of the waters She
may bring back the first few leaves she finds but a times going to
come He broke off abruptly his eyes wide and troubled as if
already viewing the dismal prospect

Maybe I AM old Bill grudgingly conceded but I dont set up to be
no Noahs ark

Oh cried Willock his sudden sense of future loss causing him to
speak with unwonted irony maybe youre just a Shem or Ham or that
other kind of Fat Whats the matter Wilfred Cant you let go of
that letter

Ive made out the name of that widower whos paying court to my old
sweetheart he said but its one I never heard of before thats why
it looked so strangeits Gledware

Willock uttered a sharp exclamation Let me see it He started up
abruptly and bent over the page

What of it asked Bill in surprise Willock had uttered words to
which the dugout was unaccustomed

Thats what it is Willock growled its Gledware His face had
grown strangely dark and forbidding and Wilfred who had never
imagined it could be altered by such an expression handed him the
letter with a sense of uneasiness

What of it reiterated Bill Suppose it IS Gledware who is HE

Do you know such a man Wilfred demanded

Out with it cried Bill growing wrathful as the other glowered at
the fire Whats come over you Look here Brick Willock Lahoma is
your cousin but I claim my share in that little girl and I ask you
sharp and flat

Oh you go to cried Willock fiercely All of you

Wilfred said lightly Red Feather has already gone there perhaps

Eh Willock wheeled about as if roused to fresh uneasiness The
Indian chief had glided from the room as silent and as unobtrusive as
a shadow

Willock sank on the bench beside Bill Atkins and said harshly Wheres
my pipe

Dont you ask ME where your pipe is snapped Bill Yonder it is in
the comer where you dropped it

Willock picked it up and slowly recovered himself You see he
observed apologetically I need Lahoma about to keep me tame I was
wondering the other day if I could swear if I wanted to I guess I
could And if put to it I guess I could take up my old life and not
be very awkward about it eitherI used to be a taxcollector and of
course got rubbed up against many people that didnt want to pay That
there Gledwarewell maybe it isnt this one Lahoma writes about but
the one I knew is just about middle age and hes a widower all right
or the next thing to itI didnt like Gledware That was all I hate
for Lahoma to be throwed with anybody of the namebut I guess its all
right Lahoma aint going to let nobody get on her offside when the
winds blowing

Bill inquired anxiously Did that Gledware you knew live near Kansas
City

He lived over in Indian Territory last time I heard of him But he
was a roving devilhe might be anywhere Onlyhe wasnt rich why
he didnt have nothing on earth except a littleyes except a little

Then he cant be the owner of a big estate remarked Wilfred with
relief

I dont know that Folks goes into the Territory and somehow they
contrives to come out loaded down But I hope to the Almighty its a
different Gledware

Lahoma can hold her own Bill remarked confidently You just wait
till her next letter comes and see if she aint flying her colors as
gallant as when she sailed out of the cove

Wilfred reflected that his invitation to remain had been sincere there
was nothing to hurry him back to the Oklahoma countryhe would at
least stay until the next letter came His interest in Lahoma was of
course vague and dreamy founded rather on the fancies of a
thousandandonenights than upon the actual interview of a brief hour
But the remarkable change that had taken possession of Willock at the
mention of Gledwares name had impressed the young man profoundly In
that moment all the geniality and kindliness of the huge fellow had
vanished and the great whiskered face had looked so wild and
dangerous the giant fists had doubled so threateningly that long
after the brow smoothed and the muscles relaxed it was impossible to
forget the ferocious picture

Thats what Ill do Wilfred declared settling back in his seat
Ill wait until that next letter comes



CHAPTER XV

THE DAY OF FENCES

While waiting for Lahomas letter Wilfred Compton spent his days in
ceaseless activity his evenings in dreamy musings Over on the North
Fork of Red Riverwhich was still regarded as Red River proper and
therefore the dividing line between Texas and Indian Territoryhe
renewed his acquaintance with the boys of Old Man Walkers ranch
Henry Woodson the cowpuncher still known as Mizzoo was one of the
old gang who greeted Wilfred with extravagant joy which shaded away to
easy and picturesque melancholy in lamenting the passing of the good
old days

These is the days of fences complained Mizzoo as Wilfred in answer
to his invitation rode forth with him to view the changes Time was
our cattle was bounded on the south by nothing but the south wind and
on the north by nothing but the north wind but these unmitigated
settlers has spiled the cattle business Im looking for the old man
to sell out and quit Why look at all the little towns that has
sprung up so confusing and handy that you dont know which to choose to
liquor up They comes like a thief in the night and in the morning
theyre equipped to rob you I cant keep no change by meIve asked
the old man to hold back my wages till the end of the year But Im
calculating to make something out of these very misfortunes You know
I always was sort of thriftyyes as they GOT to be a settled county
round us itll needs call for a sheriff and if all signs dont fail
Ill get the job this week Then therell be no more riding of the
line for old Mizzoo

Wilfred rode with him to Mangum and other villages with names and
without and he tingled to the spirit of the bounding West There
might be only a few dugouts some dingy tents and a building or so of
undressed pine but each hamlet felt in itself the possibilities of a
city and had its spaces in the glaring sands or the dead sagebrush
which it called the Square and Main Street and possibly the park
The air quivered with expectations of a railroad maybe two or three
and each cluster of hovels expected to find itself in a short time
constituted the countyseat with a gleaming steel road at its back
door

This spirit of optimism was but a reflection of the miraculous growth
of the new country of which Greer County though owned by Texas felt
itself in a sense an integral part Eight years before Indian
Territory was the huntingground of the Indian and whosoever attempted
to settle within its limits was driven forth by the soldiers It was
then a land of dim twilight full of mystery and wildness with vast
stretches of thirsty plains and bleak mountains around which the
storms unbroken by forests shrieked in the straight winds of many
days or whined the threat of the deadly tornado And suddenly it
became a land of high noon garish and crude but wideawake and
striving with all the tireless energy of young blood

Scarcely had the Oklahoma country been taken possession of before the
settlers began agitating the question of an organized territory and
too impatient to wait for Congress to act held their own convention at
Guthrie and divided the land into counties Congress made them wait
five monthsan age in the new countrybefore approving the Organic
Act The district which a short time before had been the Unassigned
Lands became the counties of Logan Oklahoma Cleveland Canadian
Kingfisher and Payne To these was added Beaver County which in Brick
Willocks day had been called NoMans Land and which the
lawabiding citizens uniting against bandits and highwaymen had
sought to organize as Cimmaron Territory

Then came the rivalry between Guthrie and Oklahoma City for the
capital adding picturesqueness to territorial history and offering
incitement to many a small village to make itself the countyseat of
its county The growth of the new country advanced by leaps and
bounds In 1891 the 868414 acres of the surplus lands of the Iowa
Sac Fox and the PottawatomieShawnee reservations formed the new
counties of Lincoln and Pottawatomie and increased the extent of some
of the old ones The next year 3500562 acres belonging to the
Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians were taken to increase several of the
older counties and to from the new ones of honest old American
namesBlame Custer Washita Dewey Roger Mills Beckham and Ellis
In the year following the Cherokee strip was opened for a settlement
together with the surplus lands of the Pawnee and Tonhawa5698140
acres besides increasing other counties this land furnished forth the
new counties of Alfalfa Garfield Grant Harper Major Woods
Woodward Pawnee Kay and Noble At the time of Wilfreds visit to
Brick Willock the winter of 18945 the opening of the Kickapoo
reservation was already a near certainty while the vast extent of
Greer County itself so long in dispute between Texas and the United
States would in all likelihood be added to the swelling territory of
Oklahoma

The territory so young but so dauntless was already agitating the
question of statehoodnot only so but of single statehood meaning
thereby the prospective engulfment and assimilation of Indian
Territory that all the land from Texas to Kansas Missouri and
Arkansas might be called by the one nameOklahoma a name to stand
forever as a symbol of the marvelously swift and permanent growth of a
white people in spite of its Choctaw significanceRed People

Although Wilfred had stayed close to his farm near Oklahoma City he
had kept alive to the rush and swing of the western life and now that
he had leisure to ride with Mizzoo among the bustling camps and view
the giant strides made from day to day by the smallest towns he was
more than ever filled with the exultation of one who takes part in
worldmovements He began to view the hurrying crowds that overran the
sidewalks with a sense of close kinshipthese people came from all
points of the Union but they were his people A year ago six months
ago they might have been New Yorkers Californians Oregonians but
now all were westerners like himself and though they believed
themselves Texans the name made as little difference as that between
Red River and Prairie Dog Forkin spirit they were Oklahomans

If Wilfred had not been a simple visitor he would have had no time for
thought but now he could look on the life of which he had for a few
years been a part and study it as related to the future It was as if
his boyhood and youth had not been passed in Chicagothe West had
blotted out the past as it ever does with relentless handand every
thoughtchannel led toward the light of the future Lahomas letter had
revived the picture of other days of another existence without
rousing one wish to return

The only desire it had stirred in his breast was that of seeing Lahoma
again of taking her by the hand to lead her not back to the old
civilization but to the new As he lay awake at night in the log
cabin that had been Lahomas his brain for a long time every night was
busy with thoughts of that new civilization and he was stirred with
ambition to take part so that when single statehood or double
statehood was achieved he would be a recognized factor in its
transformation from a looselybound territory

He began to think too of moving his residence to Oklahoma City where
he would be closer to men of affairsgreat men of great enterprises
His farm of course would be managed under his superintendenceunless
Oklahoma City should be generous enough to spread out and surround it
and lap it up townlot after townlot till not a red clod was
left And if a girl like Lahomafor surely she had not
changedif she little Lahoma And the longing grew on him to see
Annabel Sellimer and Lahoma together that he might study the girl he
had once loved with the girl he might love tomorrow He almost made up
his mind to take a brief trip to Chicago on quitting the cove perhaps
there would be something in Lahomas next letter to force a decision

Two weeks passed but Wilfred did not consider the time lost there
were letters almost daily by coach from Lahoma telling of her
adventures in the great worldthe houseparty had been delayed on
account of Mrs Sellimers illness but was to take place
immediatelyso said the last letter before the arrival of the news
that changed the course of events at the cove As yet Lahoma had not
met Mr Gledware but the fame of his riches and his luxurious home had
both increased her curiosity to see him and her conviction that Mr
Edgerton Compton stood no chance with Annabel She had discovered
too that Edgerton Compton was a brother of the Wilfred Compton who had
visited them one day in the coveWilfred read the letter with great
attention but there was no further reference to himself

Brick Willock rode over to Mangum nearly every afternoon to hear from
Lahoma but it happened that on the day of the great news neither he
nor Bill had returned from a certain hunting expedition in time for the
stage so Wilfred went for the mail There was only one letter
addressed to Mr B Willock and it seemed strangely thin The young
man wondered during all his tenmile returntrip if Lahoma had fallen
ill and after reaching the log cabin he kept looking at the slim
missive and turning it over with vague uneasiness

Brick and Bill had ridden far and it was dusk before they reached home
with a deer slung over one of the horses

Theyre getting scarcer every year complained Bill as he climbed
stiffly to the ground I guess theyll finally go the way of the
buffalo

Get a letter asked Brick hurrying forward Huh THAT it She is
sure getting fashionable I reckon when shes plumb civilized she
wont write nothing

He took the long white envelope and squinted at it inquisitively

Well why dont you open er snapped Bill Afraid youll spring a
trap and get caught

Aint much here replied Brick slowly and Im making it last

Huh Nothing is alasting when it hasnt been begun retorted Bill
crossly See what the little girl says

Im afraid shes sick observed Wilfred eying the envelope with
something like Bills irritable impatience

Brick tore it open and found within another envelope the inner one of
yellow Its a telegraph he said uneasily Lahoma had telegraphed
to the end of the wire and at Chickasha they puts it in the white
wrapper and sends it on Do you see

I dont see anything yet snapped Bill Rip er open

Brick looked at Bill Atkins Better set down Bill he remarked If
theys any kind of shock in this YOU aint got no nerve to stand it
He broke open the yellow envelope and stared at the message As he did
so the hand clutching the telegram hardened to a giant fist while his
brow wrinkled and his eyes grew dark and menacing Wilfred was
reminded of the sinister expression displayed at the first mention by
Lahoma of Gledwares name and he experienced once more that surprised
feeling of not being nearly so well acquainted with him as he had
supposed

After a dead silence Willock handed the telegram to Bill who wrinkled
his brow over it a minute or two before handing it to Wilfred The
young man read it hastily then turned to Bill His face wore a
decidedly puzzled look

I dont understand he said

Neither do I returned Bill rather blankly I guess if there is to
be any setting down its Brick that needs a chair

The telegram was as follows


The second you get this hide for your life Red Kimball says he can
prove everything Will explain in letter

Lahoma


Dont say nothing to me for a spell growled Brick thrusting his
hands deep into his pockets Ive got to think mighty quick He
strode toward the dugout leaving Wilfred and Bill staring at each
other speechless

In a short time Willock reappeared bringing from the dugout his
favorite gun Come along he bade them briefly When he had
ascended the rounded swell of Turtle Hill he stretched himself between
two wide flat rocks and lay with his face and gun directed toward the
opening of the cove

Now Bill he said sharply if you will just set facing me with your
eye on the north wall so you can tell if anybody tries to sneak over
the mountaintop Ill make matters clear Wilfred you can go or
stay free as air only IF you stay I cant promise but you may see a
man killedme or Red Kimball I dont know which though naturally I
has my preference he added his harsh voice suddenly changing to the
accent of comradeship As to Bill he aint got no choice He come
and put up with me and Lahoma when nobody didnt want him and now in
time of danger I low to get all the help out of him thats there in
spite of a begrudging disposition and the ravages of time

What I want to know is this Bill interrupted Who and what is this
Red Kimball And if you have to hide from him why aint you doing it

I puts it this way Bill that the telegram traveled faster than old
Red could so no need to hide till tonight though when you deals with
Red it behooves you to have your gun ready against chances You want
to know about Red Kimball But I think Id best wait till Lahomas
letter comes so my story can tally with hers I got my reasons for not
wanting to tell all about Red Kimball which I reckon he wouldnt be
grateful for but thats for him to say So I lows to tell only as
much as I has to tell that depending on what Lahoma has picked up
according

I suppose youve met him face to face growled Bill

They dont seem to be no harm in that question Bill but you never
knows where a first question is leading you If I refuses to answer
what seems fair and square no suspicions is roused when I refuses to
answer what might sound dark and shady So I banks myself against my
general resolution to say nothing beyond Lahomas word

Her word says he can prove everything What is everything

Thats what well learn from her letter Well just watch him do his
proving

And her word says to hide this minute

I dont do my hiding in daylight but when its good and dark Im
going to put out I would tell you the hidingplace for I trusts you
bothbut if you knowed where it was and if officers of the law come
to you for information youd be in a box I know you wouldnt give me
up but neither would you swear to a lie Not knowing where I hides
your consciences are as free as mine that hasnt never been bridled

Wilfred asked But when Lahoma writes how will you get her letter

You or Bill will go for the mail If a letter comes youll take it
to that crevice into which Miss Sellimer was drug by that big Injun
and youll wait in there till I comes not opening that letter till I
am with you Well read it together down in the hollow where poor
Miss Sellimers life was saved by Lahoma then you two will go back to
the cove and leave me to sneak away to my hidingplace which may be
near and may be far When you get a letter bring your ladder and the
lantern and be sure nobody is watching youbecause if you let Red
Kimball or any of his gang follow you to that hidingplace youd have
to see a man killedand such as that aint no sight for eyes as
civilized as Wilfreds or as old as Bills



CHAPTER XVI

THE ONYX PIN

When the next letter came from Lahoma Wilfred Compton and Bill Atkins
hurried to the crevice in the mountaintop according to agreement It
was a cloudless afternoon but at the farther end of the retreat the
light of the lantern was necessary for its perusal Brick Willock who
was there before them read the letter in silence before handing it to
the young man to read aloud

Its just addressed to me this time he remarked grimly in
explanation of his proprietary act they aint no foolishness of Dear
Brick and Bill But I treats you as friends should be treated and
lays before you everything Lahoma has found out For Brick Willock he
says Friends is better friends when they dont know all about each
other says he and I tells you only what Lahoma has been told
according

Wilfred took the letter tingling with excitement The strained
watching and waiting for the sudden appearance of an unknown Red
Kimball had made his bed in the cabin as sleepless as had been Bills
pallet in the dugout They squatted about the lantern that rested on
the stone floor Willock always with eyes directed toward the narrow
slit in the ceiling that they might not be taken by surprise

The long natural corridor was bare except for the old Spanish sword
hanging upon the wall A stout cedar post firmly fixed in the
extremity of the walls formed a rude barricade against the abyss of
unknown depth that yawned a few yards away from where they sat This
railing and the sword were the only evidences of mans possession save
for the ladder that would presently be carried back to the cove No
inquiries were made as to how Brick came and went where he found food
and a bed or how he happened to be present at the precise moment of
the arrival of the bearers of news

Dear Brick Lahoma began By this time you have hidden where nobody
can find you for youve got my telegram and you know I wouldnt have
sent it if it hadnt been necessary You believe in me and as you
would sayhow Id love to hear youyou act according Well and I
believe in you Brick and you neednt imagine as long as you live that
anybody could make me think you anything but what I know you to be the
kindest most tenderhearted most thoughtful man that ever lived Get
that fixed in your mind so when I tell what they say about you you
wont care knowing Im with you and will believe in you till death

Im going to skip everything except the part about you for this
letter goes by next mail Theres ever and ever so many other things
Id love to tell you and I dont see how I can wait but Im going to
find out for wait I must Maybe I ought to begin with Mr Gledware so
youll know more about him when I begin on the main news

We are at his house now and the houseparty is in full swing Mr
Gledware is pressing his suit to Annabel with all his might and her
mother is helping him Nothing stands in the wayfor she wants to
marry himexcept her love for Mr Edgerton Compton She told me all
about her old romance with Wilfredyou remember him I guess She got
to liking Edgerton after Wilfred went away because he looked so much
like Wilfred Maybe he does but he isnt the same kind of man Mr
Edgerton has spent all his money on fixing up the outside of the house
but Wilfred has spent his on the furnishings Well If Annabel could
change her heart from one brother to the other just because Edgerton
reminded her of Wilfred I guess she wont have a very hard time making
another transfer especially as Mr Gledware is traveling her way
When I love anybody my love is the part of me that comes alive
whenever that person is present or is mentioned So how could I slide
it from one man to another any more than the man himself could change
to another man And thats the way I love you Brick and not all the
wealth or fame or good looks in the world and you have neither could
get my heart away from YOU

Or from Bill

The first time I met Mr Gledware he acted in a curious way Of
course I was introduced as Miss Willock and he started at the name
and at sight of metwo separate little movements just as plain as
anything Then he said he had heard the name Willock in unusual
surroundings and that my face reminded him of somebody who was dead
That was all there was to it then But afterward he heard Annabel
call me Lahoma and his face turned perfectly white

The first chance he had after that he sat down to talk to me in a
corner where we wouldnt be overhead and he asked me questions So of
course I told about father and mother taking me across the prairie to
the Oklahoma country and how mother died and father was killed and I
was with the Indians a while and then was taken to live with my cousin
Brick He listened with his head down never meeting my eye and when
I had finished all he said was Did you ever bear my name before

And I said I never had Then he asked if I thought I had ever seen
him for he thought he could remember having seem ME somewhere And I
said I wasnt sure I had met so many people and there was something
familiar about him Then he said he guessed we hadnt ever met unless
accidentally on the trail somewhere as he had once been down in
Texasand that was all

I dont like Mr Gledwares eye because it always looks away from you
He would be considered a handsome man by anybody not particular about
eyes Afterward I heard about his trip to Texas Annabel and her
mother were talking about Mr Gledwares past It seems that once Mr
Gledware and his first wife I say his FIRST because I look upon
Annabel as certain to be the second joined the Oklahoma boomers and
they were attacked by Indians just as MY father and mother were and
they had with them his wifes little girl for he had married a widow
just as MY father had my stepfather and there was a terrible battle
And Mr Gledware oh he was SO brave He killed ten Indians after the
rest of his party including his wife and daughter had been slain and
he broke through the attacking party and escaped on a horsethe only
one that got away

He doesnt look THAT brave Later I asked him if it could be
possible that he was with the wagontrain we were in but he said there
wasnt any Mr or Mrs Willock in his party and no little girl named
Lahoma Willock But hes been through what my father went through and
it made me feel kinder to him somehow

But his eye is bad Maybe it got in the habit of shifting about
looking for Indians in the sagebrush Sometimes he seems still to be
looking for Indians Well I see wheres hes right there and Im
going to tell you why which brings me to the biggest news yet

Now Ive come to the day when I sent you the telegram and why I sent
it so be prepared There was to be a big picnic today near a town
called Independence and as it happened I didnt feel like going so
begged offlet me tell you why I began a novel last night full of
bright conversation the pages all broken up in little scraps of print
that hurry you along as if building steps for you to run downit was
ever and ever more interesting than real people can be It was a story
about a houseparty and the writer just made them talk to suit himself
and not to suit their dulness as a real houseparty must you know So
I stayed to finish that book Oh of course if I had had a lover to be
with But thats something Ill never have I suppose but I dont
complain Brick for youve given me everything else I ever wanted

The reason I would like to have a lover is as follows So I would
understand the experience of being regarded that way It would be like
plowing up the sagebrush to plant kafircorn and millomaize because
until such time there is bound to be a part of my nature unworked

Now there is a nook in Mr Gledwares library a sort of alcove where
you have a window all to yourself but are shut off from the rest of the
room and that is where I was when two men came in softly and closed
and locked the door behind them I couldnt see them but just as I was
starting up to find out what it meant one of themit was Mr
Gledware which surprised me greatly as he had gone with the rest to
the picnicspoke your name Brick As soon as I beard that name and
particularly on account of the way he spoke it I determined to lay
low and scout out the trouble So I just drew up as small as possible
in my chair as you would slip along through the high grass if Indians
were near and I listened Maybe if I had finished my civilization I
would have been obliged to let them know I was there but fortunately
I havent reached the limit yet

The other man I soon found was Red Kimball they had about finished
their conversation before coming into the room so the first part was
lost Mr Gledware had come for his checkbook and the check was for
Red Kimball Red Kimball used to be the leader of a band of highwaymen
up in Cimarron when it was NoMans Land it was his hand that
attacked the wagontrain when Mr Gledware acted the heroonly as
they were disguised as Indians Mr Gledware didnt know they were such
till later He came on them afterward without their disguises and
they would have killed him if YOU Brick hadnt knocked down Red and
shot his brother So as I listened I found out that Mr Gledware
wasnt the hero he claimed to be but was THE MAN YOU SAVED and he is
MY STEPFATHER and I was carried away BY HIM and taken FROM HIM by the
Indians but he wasnt killed at all And my name I suppose is Lahoma
GLEDWARE at least not as Red Feather had taught me Lahoma WILLOCK
And I am NO kin to you at all Brick you just took me in and cared
for me because you ARE Brick Willock the dearest tenderest friend a
little girl ever hadand these lines are crooked because there are
tearsbecause you are not my cousin

Id rather be kin to you than married to a prince

Red Kimball says you were one of his gang of highwaymen but I know it
ISNT TRUE so you dont have to say A WORD But he is determined to
be revenged on you for killing his brother And the reason hes waited
this long is because he didnt know where you weregood reason isnt
it Tell you how he found outit all comes from my getting civilized
Hes a porter at our Kansas City hotel So when he heard the men
talking about how I had once been kidnaped by the Indians and wrote
nearly every day to my cousin Brick Willock which they thought an odd
namehe guessed the rest

It makes my blood turn cold to think that all the time we were living
quietly and happily in the cove that awful Red Kimball was hunting for
you meaning to have your lifeand in a way that Im ashamed to write
but must so youll know everything He means to have you arrested and
tried for his brothers murderand he says HE CAN HANG YOU

And Mr Gledware is his witness Thats why Red has come after him
Youll think it strange that after his gang were about to kill Mr
Gledware in the prairie that he should come to ask him to act as
witness against another man Thats what Mr Gledware told him But
Red Kimball answered that it was all a bluffthey had never dreamed of
shooting him or his little girl

When NoMans Land was added to Oklahoma a pardon was offered to Red
Kimball and all his gang if they would come in and lay down their arms
and swear to keep the peaceyou see most of their crimes had been
committed where no courts could touch them Well all the gang came
in But what do you think That terrible Red Kimball swears that YOU
WERE ONE OF HIS GANG and that as you didnt come in and surrender
yourself THE PARDON DOESNT APPLY TO YOU It was all I could do to
keep from stepping right out and telling him you were one of the most
peaceable and harmless of men and that you just HAPPENED to be riding
about when you saw Mr Gledwares danger and just HAD to shoot Kansas
Kimball to save me and my stepfather You a highwayman indeed I
could laugh at that if it didnt make me too mad when I think about it

Then Mr Gledware talked He said maybe it was a bluff against him
that standing him up against the moon to be shot at but it wasnt one
he was apt to forget and he could never be on any kind of terms with
Red besides he said if Brick Willock hadnt saved his life hed
always thought so so wouldnt witness against him though he had no
doubt he belonged to Reds gang But that was nothing to HIM And he
couldnt understand how Red could have the face to come to him about
ANYTHING but was willing to pay a sum to keep all the past hushed up
as he didnt want any complications from being claimed as a
stepfather by Lahoma The past was over he said and Lahoma had a
home of her own and he was satisfied to be free of herand he would
pay Red something to keep the past buried

Then Red spoke pretty ugly saying it wasnt the past he was anxious
to have buried but Brick Willock And he said that Mr Gledware was a
witness to the murder whether he wanted to be or not and Red was
willing to confess to everything in order to have Brick hanged

Then Mr Gledware in a cold unmoved voice said he must go back to
the picnic and Mr Kimball could do as he pleased

But that wasnt the end Do you know says Mr Kimball that Red
Feather is in town laying for you he says Mr Gledware gave a
dreadful kind of low scream such as turned me sick to hear It
reminded me of the cry of a coyote I heard once caught in the trap
that saw Bill coming with his knife The room was as still as death
for a little while I guess they were looking at each other

At last Red says pretty slow and calm Would you like to have that
Indian out of the way Mr Gledware didnt answer at least not
anything I could hear but his eyes must have spoken for him for Red
went on after a while Its a go then is it Well thatll take
timebut in a few daysmaybe in a few hoursIll deal with the
chief And I want your word that after thats accomplished youll go
with me to Greer County and stay on the job till Brick Willock swings

There was a longer silence than before It lasted so long and the
room was so still that after a while I almost imagined that they were
gone or that I had just waked up from a dreadful dream My nerves all
clashed in the strangest waylike the shivering of morning ice on a
poolwhen Mr Gledwares voice jarred on my ears He said How will I
know

Well says Red Kimball roughly how WOULD you know

There was another of those awful silences Then Mr Gledware said
When you bring me a pin that he always carries about him Ill know
that Red Feather will never trouble me again

Kimball spoke rougher than before You mean itll show you that hes
a dead un huh

I mean what I said Mr Gledware snapped as if just rousing himself
from a kind of stupor

Well what kind of pin That was Kimballs question

Then Mr Gledware described the pin He said it was a smoothfaced
goldrimmed pin of onyx set with pearls And Kimball said boastingly
that he would produce that pin as he was a living man And Mr
Gledware told him if he did hed go to witness against Brick Willock
So both left the room and pretty soon from the window I saw them
going away on horseback in opposite directions

I mustnt hold back this letter to add any more it must get off by
the mail thats nearly due The moment I learn anything new Ill write
again Of course I know youre no more a highwayman than myself but
since its true that you did shoot Reds brother and since he
evidently died of the wound I suppose Red could cause you a great deal
of trouble You could swear that if you hadnt killed Kansas Kimball
he would have killed my stepfather and that they had ordered you to
kill me in my sleep The trouble is that Mr Gledware seems to be in
terror about Red Feather and if Kimball gets him rid of the Indian
Im not sure that Mr Gledware would tell the whole truth It might be
the word of those two against yours Its certain that if they tried
you and failed to convict Kimball would try a knife or a gun as the
next best way of getting even

My poor dear Brick it seems that theres long trouble before you hut
the consciousness of innocence will uphold you and just as soon as I
do all I can at this end of the trail by acting as your faithful
scout Ill come out in the open in my war clothes with my belt
welllined with weapons and well defy the world In the
meantimebetter keep hid Goodby Think of me when the wild winds
blow

Your little girl

Lahoma

PS Tell Bill he can still claim his share

PPS Got Bills note of a few lines read it with the greatest joy
in the world and guessed at the news He says Wilfred Compton is
there What for

CHAPTER XVII

BRICK MAKES A STAND

As soon as Wilfred had finished the letter not without a wry smile
over the query concerning himself Bill Atkins exclaimed

THEN Ho And so shes no more kin to you Brick than to me and
her names no more Willock than Atkinsand being but a stepdaughter to
old Sneak neither is it Gledware Yet you have everlastingly had your
own say about Lahoma from claiming to be a cousin I want you to know
from this on that I claim as big a share in Lahoma as anybody else on
this green and living earth

Wilfred looked up expecting Brick to consent to this on the ground
that in all likelihood Bills claim would last but a few years anyway
It seemed too good an opening for Brick to lose but instead of
refreshing himself with his customary gibe the huge fellow sat dark
and glowering his eyes staring upward at the crevice in the rock roof
the lanternlight showing his forehead deeply rutted in a threatening
scowl

Another point needs clearing up Bill said sharply What about Red
Kimballs charge DID you belong to his gang ARE you a highwayman

Brick waved impatiently toward the letter that still gleamed in the
young mans hand We goes on documentry evidence he said I
takes a bold and open stand on the general plea of Not guilty to
nothing Thats technical and its arbitrary Should you be asked
had I ever expressed an opinion as to being a highwayman or a
lowwayman you can report me as saying Not guilty according

Brick interposed Wilfred returning him the letter youre making a
mistake not to trust us with the whole truth If you wait for Lahomas
letters and only admit what she discovers Bill and I cant form any
plan of protecting you While her information is coming bit by bit
the man who wants you hanged is liable to show up

Let im come growled Brick He cant get no closer to me than Ill
be to him Im not going to air my past history What Lahoma finds
out I admits frank and open otherwise I stands firm as not guilty
being on safe ground technical and arbitrary

But if Red Kimball brings the sheriffits only a matter of
timeyour plea of not guilty wont save you from arrest And hell
have any number of rascals to prove what he pleases whether its the
truth or not If Gledware comes as a witness his position will give
him great influence against youand the fact that hed testify after
youd saved his life would make a pretty hard hit with the jury

Jury nothing retorted Brick This case aint never going to a
jury Such things is settled man to man in these parts

But as surely as the sheriff serves his writ youll be landed in
jail And I happen to know the sheriff hes a man that couldnt be
turned from his dutygood friend of mine too

Is eh Then youd better advise with him for his good

Think of Lahoma If you killed a manwhether the sheriff or this
Red KimballLahoma could never feel toward you as she does today

And how would she feel toward me if I was hanged uh I guess shed
druther I laid my man low than that I swung high Willock started up
impatiently Were wasting words he said roughly There is but
the two alternatives Im one of em and Red Kimball is the other
Its simply a question of which gets which I tries to make it plain
for theres no going back Now are you with me or not If not Ill
fight it out along as I always done in times past and goneand
bedinged to em Im sorry my young days was as they was and for
Lahomas sake Id cut off this right arm he held it out
rigidlyif thatd change the past But the pastand bedinged TO
itcant be changed Its there right over your shoulder out of
reach This mountain might as well say I dont like being a big
chunk of granite where all the rest of the country is a smooth prairie
Im sorry I erupted and I guess Ill go back into the heart of the
earth where I come from A mountain thats erupted is erupted till
kingdom come and a man thats did a deed has did it till the stars
fall But you CAN imagine this mountain saying with some sense too
Now since I HAS erupted Ill do my best to cover my nakedness with
pretty cedars for to stay green in season and out of season and Ill
embroider myself with flowers and grasses and send little
mountainstreams down to make soft water in peoples wells so they
wont alltime be fretting because I takes up so much of good
plowingland says the mountain I may not be a mountain but Ive
got a good top to me which reasons against the future and forgets the
past I know Red Kimballand now that hes learned where I live one
of us is too many considering the hard times I mean to keep hiding
not to be took by surprise but I lows to come forth one of these days
and walk about free and disposed all danger having been removed

What about the law demanded Bill Do you think ITS going to let
you walk about free and disposed after youve removed Red Kimball

I hopes the law and me can get on peaceable together returned the
other grimly Ive never had nothing to do with it and I hopes to be
let alone

Wilfred spoke with sudden decision Brick Im with you to the end
and so is Bill I have nothing to do with your purposes or plans
except to offer the best advice I knowyouve rejected it but Im
with you just the same It strikes me I can help you by going to
Kansas Cityfor you need only Bill in the covehe can bring you
Lahomas letters Ill hurry to Lahoma and if she decides to come
back as Im sure she will very soonwell shell need a protector
Ill bring her home She asks in her letter what Im here for
Wouldnt that be a good answer

Brick Willock laid his hand on the others shoulder and stared into his
face with troubled eyes Gradually his countenance cleared and
something of his old geniality returned A firstclass answer son
I believe youll do it He grasped Wilfreds hand These are
troublous times and its good to feel a hand like this thats steady
and true Now I aint going to drag you into nothing that could hurt
you nor Bill or make you feel sore over past days I dont need
nobody to lean onbut Lahoma does and if Red Kimball pops it to me
before I get a chance to keel him over you two must look out for her

Ill look out for her myself singlehanded said Bill gruffly

I know you would old tap as long as you lasts said Willock with an
unwonted note of gentleness Bill was so embarrassed by the tone that
he cringed awkwardly After a pause Willock suggested that Wilfred
wait for one more letter from Lahoma provided it come within the next
twentyfour hours then start up the trail for Chickasha and board the
train for Kansas She might write something that needed instant
work he explained If so Id like to have you here Im looking
for developments in her next letter

Strange to me muttered Bill about Red Feather and that sneaking
Gledware Wonder how came the Indian with a pin on him that Gledware
knew of

Willocks face was twisted into a sardonic grin Guess I could
explain that all rightbut I says nothing beyond Lahomas word I
banks on documentry proofs and otherwise stands technical and
arbitrary

Hitherto Wilfred as guest of honor had been offered the cabin as his
sleepingquarters and he had accepted it because of the countless
reminders of Lahomas fresh and innocent life but this night he
shared the dugout with Bill from a sense of impending danger Until a
late hour they sat over the glowing coals discussing their present
situation and offering conjectures about Willocks younger days There
could hardly have been a stronger contrast between the emaciated old
man of the huge white mustache thin reddish cheeks and shock of white
hair and the broadshouldered handsome and erect young manor the
stern and gloomy countenance of the former and the expressive eyes and
flexible lips of Wilfred Yet they seemed unconscious of any chasm of
age or disposition as they spoke in low tones not without frequent
glances toward the barricaded door and the heavily curtained window

The wind made strange noises overhead and at times one could be almost
certain there was the stamping of a mans foot upon the earthen roof
The distant cry of a wild beast and the nearer yelping of hungry
wolves mingled with the whistling of the wind Sometimes Wilfred rose
and passing noiselessly to the window raised the curtain with a quick
gesture to stare out on a dark and stormy night and once in doing so
he surprised a pair of red eyes under bristling gray hair which seemed
to glow hot as molten lead as the fire from the open stove caught them
unaware

If my arms were tied remarked Bill Id rather trust myself to that
coyote than to Red Kimball I hate to think of Brick out yonder on the
mountain all alone and no fire to warm him afraid to smoke his pipe
I reckon Well this kind of thing cant last long thats plain

It was Wilfreds conviction that this kind of thing could not
indeed last long which kept him awake half through the night and
yet when the morning sunlight flooded the cove it seemed impossible
that deeds of violence could be committed in so peaceful a world In
that delusion however he could not long remain Lahomas next letter
came confirmatory of his worst fears

Just read it aloud Wilfred said Brick as all gathered about the
lantern in the retreat at the mountaintop Were all one now and
Ive got no secrets from youat least none thats knowed to Lahoma
And if the case seems immediate I reckon youll prove game son

Wilfred nodded briefly My horse is ready saddled he said as he
opened the letter addressed to Willock As soon as Ive read Yours
truly Ill be ready to jump into the saddle so I say goodby now



CHAPTER XVIII

LIFE ON ONE CONDITION

Dear Brick and Bill

I put Bill in because I am sure that by this time he has been told
what was in my last letter and I know hes true blue I have been so
excited since finding out that Red Kimball is determined on revenge
and that Mr Gledware may be a witness for him that I cant think
about anything but the danger at the cove I feel that I ought to be
there to lend a hand what will you do without me if that horrible
highwayman comes slipping around Turtle Hill or creeps down the north
mountain in the dead of night And I would be on my way there now if
I didnt hope to find out more about their plans

They have come back from the picnic and I am on the watch feeling
sure Red Kimball will come again to have another talk with Mr
Gledware But he hasnt come yet and everything is quiet and
peaceable as if things were going along as things always do and always
willit makes me dreadfully nervous So as it seemed that nothing
was going to happen I decided to stir up something myself When
theres no news why not make some of your own I made some

This is the same day I overheard that plot in the library but it is
night When it was good and dark Annabel came up to my room where I
was watching the road from my window and she sat down and began
talking about the picnic and what a fine time she had had with a good
deal about going to Europe She was all flushed and running over with
talk and after a while it came clear that shes just been engaged to
Mr Gledware

It seemed to me it would be like fighting behind bushes to tell her
what I thought of Mr Gledware while under his roof and at his expense
so I opened up matters by talking about Wilfred Compton I told her how
faithful and true Wilfred has been to her all these years carrying her
letters next to his heart and dreaming of her night and day and how
he came to see me once because it had been two years since hed seen
a sureenough girl and how I tried to interest him as hard as I could
but he never wanted to come back because his heart belonged to Annabel

After a while she began to cry but it wasnt over Wilfred it was
over Edgerton When Wilfred went away to be a cowboy she lost interest
and sympathy in him because she doesnt understand cowboys they are
not in her imagination But his brother Edgerton has always been a
city man in nice clothes with pleasing manners and if he had money
But whats the use talking Seems like thats the worst waste of time
there can be and the most aggravating to say if soandso had money I
Because if he hasnt got it somebody else has and if you think
moneys more than the man there you are And Mr Gledware has it Hes
not the man but he has the money

Then I expressed myself You know what I think So does Annabel
now Thats how I made me some news when there wasnt any The news
is that Annabel will never forgive me and as Im here solely as her
guest my guestingtime will be briefjust long enough to find out
what Mr Gledware decides to do I oughtnt to have told Annabel that
she was mercenary or that Mr Gledware was as hard as a stone and as
old as M Im not sure how to spell him but you remember the
oldest man Yes I know I oughtnt If a woman can marry a man when
she doesnt love him it wont change her purpose to know what YOU
think about it because her own feelings are the biggest things that
could stand in the way

But I told her anyway Seemed like everything in me turned to words
and poured out without my having to keep it going I just stood there
and watched myself say things You see Annabel is so dainty and
pretty and naturally so sweetand Mr Gledwarewell he ISNT The
more I thought of that and the better I remembered poor Wilfred pining
away for her in the desert and not coming back to see me because he
couldnt get HER out of his brain and how she changed from him to his
brother and from Mr Edgerton to Mr Gledware I was ashamed of her
and sorry for her and angry with her

I wish I hadnt said anything But I felt glorious at the time just
like a storm sweeping across the prairie purifying the air and not
caring whether the earth wants to be purified or not I did wrong
because I came to the big world to study people of culture and
refinement not to quarrel with them You must have money you MUST
have money you MUST have money if youre civilized I dont care if
I AM a little storm Yes of course I know a storm isnt a civilized
thing Well I know what Im going to doIm going to come back and
blow the rest of my life right there in the cove with my Brick and my
Bill

So thats my news that Im dissatisfied with the big world It isnt
like Id have made it thats the truth Now Ill lay this letter
aside to cool I mean IT and ME too and Ill not send it until
something about Red Kimball happens so youll be posted on what really
matters After all people that marry for money arent important they
dont belong to big affairsbut theres something worth discussing in
a plot to commit murder That MEANS something as Brick would say
its vital These people about me kind gentle correctall their
waking thoughts are devoted to little thingsfashionable trifles that
last no longer than the hour in which theyre bornjust timekillers
I enjoy these pleasing trifles but my eyes are opened and I know they
ARE trifles These peoples eyes are not opened Why Because they
havent lived in the West neighboring with real things like alkali
plains and sandstorms and granite mountains

My but it would open their eyes if one of their dearest friends was
in danger of getting himself hanged Something permanent in THAT

LATER This is midnight I expect to leave as soon as I possibly
can but probably this letter will get away first so heres something
new to put your mind on its rather dreadful when you give it a calm
thought But my thoughts are not calm Far from it Oh how excited I
was But I guess THEY didnt know it It all happened about an hour
ago and you can see that my hand is still a little shaky

There was a bright moonlight but you neednt be afraid Im going to
talk about THAT this isnt any tale about moons I was sitting at my
window because I couldnt sleep not that I expected to see anything
unusual Theres a big summerhouse at the far end of the lawn all
covered with vines and theres a walk between dense shrubbery leading
to it from the house I guess thats why I didnt see anybody go to
that summerhouse The first thing I DID see was Red Kimball come out
and slip through a little sidegate and hurry along the country road
As soon as I saw him I guessed that he and Mr Gledware had been
conspiring in the summerhouse What a chance I had missed to act the
good scout

But it seemed no use to go down after Red Kimball had left If Mr
Gledware was still in the summerhouse I knew he was alone and if
hed returned to the house all was over for the night I was
wondering what new plot they had formed and how I was to find out
about it when my eye was caught by a movement in the hedge that runs
down to the sidegate The movement was as slight as possible but as
there wasnt ANY breeze it made me shiver a little for I knew
somebody was skulking there I watched and pretty soon something
passed through the gate light and quick and stealthy like the shadow
of a cloud Only there wasnt any cloud and in the flash of
moonlight I saw it was our old friendRed Feather

Almost as soon as I recognized him he had disappeared behind a large
lilacbush but I had seen what he held in the hand behind his backit
was a long unsheathed knife The lilacbush stood close to the
summerhouse He fell flat to the ground and though I couldnt see
him after that I knew he was wriggling his way around the bush You
would have been ashamed of me for a minute or two for I kept sitting
beside the window as if I had been turned to a statue of ice I felt
just that cold too

But maybe I didnt stay there as long as it seemed First thing I
knew I was running downstairs as lightly and swiftly as I could and
out through the door at the end of the side hall that had been left
wide openand I was at the summerhouse door like a flash There was a
wide path of moonlight across the concrete floor and right in that
glare was a sight never to be forgottenRed Feather about to stab Mr
Gledware to the heart He held Mr Gledware by the throat with one
hand and his other hand held the knife up for the blow Mr Gledware
lay on his back and Red Feather had one knee pressed upon his breast
In the light Mr Gledwares face was purple and dreadfully distorted
but the Indian looked about as usualjust serious and unchangeable

When I reached the doorway I blotted out most of the moonlight and I
drew back so Red Feather could see who I was He looked up and let go
of Mr Gledwares throat but didnt move otherwise RED FEATHER I
said GIVE ME THAT KNIFE

Mr Gledware recognizing my voice tried to entreat me to save him
but he was halfstrangled and only made sounds that turned me faint
to know that the man my mother had married was such a coward

Red Feather told me that if I came any nearer or if I cried for help
he would murder that man and escape but that if I would step into the
shadow and listen hed give his reason for doing it before it was
done So I went across the room from him to save time hoping I could
persuade him to change his mind I stood in the shadow and in a low
voice I reminded him of his kindness to me and of our kindness to
him and I begged for Mr Gledwares life

Red Feather asked me if I knew Mr Gledware was my stepfather yet
hadnt acknowledged it to me I said yes He asked me if I didnt
know Mr Gledware had kept still about it because he didnt want the
trouble and expense of taking care of me I said of course I had
thought of that He asked if I knew he had deserted my mothers dead
body in the desert to save his miserable life I said I knew that but
he had taken me with him and he had tried to save me and I was going
to save him

Red Feather shook his head No he said I could not save him for he
would be dead in two or three minutesand then he bent over Mr
Gledware who all this time was afraid to move or to make a sound I
hurried to remind him that he hadnt told me his reason for wanting to
kill the man

Then Red Feather said that when that man rode with me among the
Indians Red Feathers daughter had taken a fancy to him and Mr
Gledware had married her and I had been kept away from him so hed
forget me and not turn his thoughts toward his own people and they had
taught me that my name was Willock because they were going to take me
to you Brick Isnt it wonderful That day you found the deserted
wagon and buried my mother Red Feather was watching you from the
mountain and he wouldnt kill you because you made that grave and knelt
down to talk to the Great Spirit Afterward when he rode home and
found that his daughter and Mr Gledware were to be married he made up
his mind that if you succeeded in keeping hidden from Red Kimball and
his band you would be the one to take care of me And when two years
had passed and you were still safe he brought me to you What a glad
day that was

When Red Feathers daughter wanted Mr Gledwares life saved it was
so And Red Feather gave them a great stretch of land and Mr
Gledware got to be important in the tribe he made himself one of them
and they thought him greater than their own chief At the end of a few
years there was the great agitation over the boomers coming to the
Oklahoma country and much talk of the land being thrown open The
Indians didnt want it done and they joined together to send some one
to Washington to address congress on the subject Mr Gledware was
such an orator that they thought him irresistible so they selected
him and for his fee they collected over fifty thousand dollars
Think of it

Of course he didnt go near Washington It was the time of Kansas
Citys great boom He went there and bought up city lots and sold out
at the right time and thats why hes rich today In the meantime
the Indians didnt know what had become of him and Red Feathers
daughter died from shame over her desertionjust pined away and hid
herself from her people till she was starved to death Thats why Red
Feather meant to kill Mr Gledware

When he had finished Red Feather bent over Mr Gledware and said to
him Me speak all true Tell Lahomame speak all true

And the man whispered feebly It is all truedont kill me for
Gods sake dont kill mesave me Lahoma MY CHILD

I begged him not to kill the man Red Feather said to me You hear
how he treat my daughter You my friend Lahoma You know all that
and yet you tell me not kill him

I say not kill him

Then you hate my daughter

My mother could marry him Red Feather and I can beg for his life

He shook his head No Lahoma he die he leave my daughter to die
and this hand do to him what he do to her

I never felt so helpless so horribly weak and useless There I was
only a few yards away and the man was my stepfather and his enemy was
our friend And not far away stood the mans big house filled with
guestsamong them strong men who could have overpowered dozens of
Indians But what could I do

Then I had a thought Let him live Red Feather I said but strip
him of all his illgotten property Turn him loose in the world
without a penny itll be punishment enough You cant bring back your
daughter by killing him but you can make him give up all he has in
return for stealing the money from your tribe

I dont know why I thought of that and I dont know why it made
instant appeal to Red Feathers mind I saw at once that he was going
to consent All he said was Talk to him But I knew what he meant

So I crossed the room and looked down at the man Mr Gledware I
said are you willing to give up all your possessions in order to save
your life

Oh yes he gasped A thousand times yes God bless you Lahoma

You will deed all your property away from you And surrender all
that you own money bonds stocks and so forth

My God yes yes he wailed Save meonly save me Lahoma

I looked at Red Feather Shall he make it all over to you

Red Feather shook his head Me not want his money Let him give all
to Red Flower the daughter him not see since he stole our money and
desert his wife

Yes yes yes moaned Mr Gledware Ill give everything to
herIll make over everything to her in the morning so help me
Godif you spare my life she shall have everything

All this time Red Feather had never moved his knee from the mans
breast Now he rose and pointed toward the East The morning will
come he said solemnly If you keep your wordwell If you try
fool Red Featherif you keep back one piece of money one clod of
earth He wheeled about so suddenly with his drawn knife that I
thought he was plunging it into the mans heart It shot down like
lightning but stopped short just before the edge of the blade touched
the miserable coward

Mr Gledware sobbed and gasped and choked swearing that he would keep
his word and assuring us that if he broke it death would be too good
for him But what he will do when he thinks himself safethats
another thing I know his life is as secure as mine if he is true to
his promise But if he breaks itwell we know Red Feather Do you
think Mr Gledware will keep his word Or will he wait to see whether
or not Red Kimball rids him of the Indian I believe hell be afraid to
wait But as soon as hes calm it will be like death for him to give
up all he owns That will mean giving up Annabel too

It hasnt been an hour since I came back to my room When Red Feather
slipped away the only thing I asked Mr Gledware was my mothers
maiden name and the place where her people lived Im going to leave
here in the morning Im coming back where theres room enough to turn
around in and air enough to breathe where men speak the truth because
they dont care whos who and shoot quick and straight when they have
to Im coming back where moneys mighty scarce and loves as free and
boundless as Heaven where good books are few and true hearts are many
Yes Im coming back to the West and if the winds dont blow all the
sand away under the sand I expect to be buried But I want to live
until Im buried People have made the big world as it iswell they
are welcome to it but God has made the cove as it is and its for Me
and Brick and Bill

Good night

Lahoma

Just the three of us just Me and Brick and Bill ONETWOTHREE
Theres oceans of room out in the big world for everything and
everybody But in the cove theres room just for

Me

And Brick

And Bill



CHAPTER XIX

LIKE LOVERS

On reaching Chickasha Wilfred Compton telegraphed to Kansas City
asking his brother if Lahoma was still at Mr Gledwares house in the
country In the course of a few hours the reply came that she had
already started home to Greer County Texas After reading the
message Wilfred haunted the station not willing to let even the most
unpromising freight train escape observation

Everything that came down the track on this last reach of the railroad
into Southwest Oklahoma was crowded with people cattle household
furniture stores of hardware groceries drygoodsall that man
requires for his physical wellbeing The town itself was swarming
with eager jostling throngs bound for many diverse points and friends
of a day shouted hearty goodbys or exchanged goodnatured badinage
as they separated to meet no more

Men on horseback leading heavily laden packhorses covered wagons from
which peeped women and children halfreclining upon bedding their eyes
filled with grave wonder at a world so unlike their homes in the East
or Northpyramids of undressed lumber fastened somehow upon four
wheels and surmounted in precarious fashion by sprawling men whose
faces and garments suggested Broadway New York and Leadville
ColoradoWilfred gazed upon the unending panorama In those corded
tents he saw the pioneer family already in possession of the new land
in the stacks of pine boards he beheld houses already sending up the
smoke of peace and prosperity from their chimneys and in the men and
women who streamed by their faces alight with hope their bodies ready
for the grapple with drought flood cyclone famine he saw the
guaranty of a young and dominant state

Strangers greeted one another with easy comradeship Sometimes it was
just Hello neighborand if a warning were shouted across the
street to one endangered by the current of swelling life it might be
Look out there brother The sense of kinship tingled in the air
opening mens hearts and supplying aid to weaker brethren Those who
gathered along the track awaiting the arrival of the trains had already
the air of oldtimers eager to extend the hospitality of a wellloved
land

In such a crowd Wilfred was standing when he first caught sight of
Lahoma among those descending to the jostling platform He had not
known how she would look and certainly she was much changed from the
girl of fifteen but he made his way to her side without the slightest
hesitation

Lahoma

She turned sharply with a certain ease of movement suggesting fearless
freedom Her eyes looked straight into the young mans with
penetrating keenness which instantly softened to pleasure Why I how
glad I am to see you she cried giving him her hand as they withdrew
from the rush But how did you know me

How did YOU know he returned pleased and thrilled by her glowing
brown hair her eloquent eyes her warmtinted cheeks her form as
erect as of yore but not so thinas pleased and thrilled as if all
these belonged to him How did you know ME he repeated looking and
looking as if he would never be able to believe that she had turned
out so much better than he had ever dreamed she would

Oh said Lahoma when I looked into your face I saw myself as a
girl sitting under the cedar trees in the cove with Brick and Bill

Just you three demanded Wilfred wistfullyalso smilingly

Oho exclaimed Lahoma showing her perfect little teeth as if about
to bite in a way that filled him with fearful joy and so they showed
you that letter

JUST you three repeated Wilfred Just room enough in the cove for
youand Brickand Bill

Listen to me Wilfred and I will do the talking

Well

She lowered her voice to a whisper Lean your head closer

Wilfred put down his head Is this close enough he whispered
feeling exalted Men women and children circled about them the air
vibrated with the shock of trunks and mail bags hurled upon the
platform

No said Lahoma rising on tiptoe

Wilfred took off his hat and got under hers

She whispered in his ear Red Kimball came on this trainthere he
ishe hasnt seen me yetwas in another coach

Well Go on talking LahomaId get closer if I could

SHH He knows me for he was a porter in our hotel When he sees
us hell know Ive come home to warn Brick SHH Then hell try to
keep me from doing it Looksome of his gang are speaking to
himtheyve been waiting here to meet himtheyll go with him I
expect Well all be in the stagecoach together

What do you want me to do to em Lahoma

I want you to pretend that you dont know meand they mustnt find
out your name is Compton or theyll think Mr Edgerton got word to you
to join me here Be a stranger till were safe in the cove

All right Goodbybut suppose I hadnt come

Oh I could have done without you said Lahoma Or I think I could

You could never have done without me Wilfred declared decidedly

I can right NOW She drew away Ill get into the stage dont
follow too soon

There were three stagecoaches drawn up at a short distance from the
platform and Lahoma went swiftly to the one bound for her part of the
country She was the first to enter she was seated quietly in a
corner when the two long seats that faced each other began filling up
The last to come were four men one tall slender redfaced and
redhaired two others of dark and lowering faces who looked upon the
former as their leader and the last Wilfred Compton who had
unobtrusively joined himself to this remnant of Red Kimballs gang

The stage which was built after the manner of the oldfashioned
omnibus afforded no opportunity of moving to and fro in the selection
of seats hence when Red Kimball discovered Lahomas identitythe
exact moment of the discovery was marked by his violent startshe was
safeguarded from his approach by her proximity to a very large woman
flanked by a thin spinster These were two sisters going to the
evenings station where the coach would stop for supper and Lahoma
discussed with them their plans and hopes with bright cheerfulness and
ready friendship

Wilfred watched Red Kimball as he glared in that direction and guessed
his thoughts Although Kimball knew Lahoma he was not sure that she
knew him and though he was convinced at once that she was on a mission
of warning that might be true without her knowing that he had left
Kansas City Red Kimball was burning to find out if he were a stranger
to her but at the same time fearful of disclosing himself He
muttered to his companions hoarsely careful that Wilfred whom he
regarded askance should overhear nothing that he said

The situation was such as could not very well continue during the days
it would take the coach to reach Mangum but although Wilfred was
conscious of the strain he felt excitedly happy Very little of his
attention was given to Kimball and a great deal to Lahoma She was
talking to the sisters about the baby of the one and the chickens of
the other offering advice on both subjects from the experience of a
certain Mrs Featherby whom she had known as a child

Mrs Featherby was a very wonderful woman Lahoma announced with
conviction and the first woman I ever knew And when her baby was
teething The very large lady listened with great attention

She told me this when I was a small girl Wilfred presently heard
Lahoma saying And I treasured it in my mind I stored myself with
her experience about everything there is It came to me then that if
she moved away from Headquarters Mountainthats my mountainmaybe no
other woman would ever come there to live so I stored myself because
I was determined to learn the business of being a woman

The large woman gazed upon her admiringly I guess you learned all
right

They had not gone five miles before the large woman and her younger
sister were in love with Lahomabut it hadnt taken Wilfred five
miles As he listened to her bright suggestions and noted her living
eyes her impulsive gesturesfor she could not talk without making
little movements with her handsand her flexible sympathetic voice he
saw her moving about a wellordered household It was on his farm
of course and the house was hisand she was his Lahoma

Red Kimball watched her with the same sidewise attention but his face
was brooding his halfveiled eyes were red and threatening What would
happen in the nighttime as the stage pursued its lonely way across the
bleak prairie Since Red Kimball meant to appeal to the law in his
revenge against Brick there was no danger of his transgressing it
openly But in the darkness with two unscrupulous companions under his
command he would most probably execute some scheme to prevent Lahoma
from reaching her destination

The evening shadows were stretching far toward the east from the few
trees that marked the dried bed of a stream when the coach stopped
among a collection of hovels and tents As the horses were led away
the passengers dismounted and both Wilfred and Red Kimball hurriedly
drew close to Lahoma

Lahoma however appeared unaware of their presence The sisters had
been met by the husband of the older and as they gathered about the
big wagon Lahoma was urged to go home with them to supper

Were only a little ways out she was told and well sure get you
back before the stage leavesthe victuals at the station aint fit to
eat

A very little insistence induced Lahoma to comply and both the young
man and the former highwayman saw her go with disappointment Kimball
and his friends went into the Dining Hall to gulp down a hasty meal
and Wilfred entered with them He remained only a moment however
just long enough to purchase a number of sandwiches which he stored
away as if meaning to eat them in the coach

As soon as he was in the single street with the door closed behind him
he darted toward the stage barn and by means of a handsome deposit
obtained two horses Springing upon one he rode rapidly from the
settlement leading the other and in a short time came in sight of a
cabin which with its outhouses was the only building in all the wide
expanse From its appearance he knew it to be the one described to
Lahoma and he galloped up to the door with the certainty of finding
her within The big wagon had been unhitched and the horses were
fastened to its wheels eating from the bed

The family was about to sit down to supper the first to discover
Wilfred as he flitted past the single window in the side of the cabin
was Lahoma Before he could knock on the door she had opened it

Oh Wilfred she reproached him theyll miss you and know youve
come to consult with me about warning Brick

Quick Lahoma said Wilfred as if she had not spoken you can ride
a horse I suppose He smiled but his eyes were sparkling with
impatience

In a flash Lahomas face was glowing with enthusiasm She looked back
into the room and cried Goodby Then Wilfred swung her to the back
of the led horse Well beat em cried Lahoma as he sprang upon
his horse Fast as you pleaseIve never been left behind yet

The young man noted with sudden relief that she was dressed for the
hardships of the prairie It came to him with a sense of wonder that
he had not noticed that before perhaps from never having seen her in
fashionable attire As they galloped from the cabin from whose door
looked astonished faces Lahoma answered his thought

Up there she said nodding her head toward the East I dressed for
peoplebut out here for wind and sand

Looking back she saw the family running out of the cottage waving
handkerchiefs and bonnets as in the mad joy of congratulation

They think were running away together shouted Wilfred with
exultation The hurry of their flight the certainty of pursuit the
prospect of dangers from man and nature thrilled his blood fixed his
jaw illumined his eye All life seemed suddenly a flight across a
level world whose cloud of yellow dust enveloped only himself and
Lahoma They think were running away together Look at them
Lahoma How happy they are at the idea

They dont know theres nobody to object if we dont returned
Lahoma gaily as she urged on her steed Come along Wilfred she
taunted as his horse fell a neck behind hers what are you staying
back THERE for Tired If we get into the trail before that coach
starts well have to put on all speed

Doing my best he called but I made a bad bargain when I got this
beast This is his best lick and it doesnt promise to last long
However it was the only one left at the barn

Lahoma slightly checked her animal Thats a good thing anywayif
theres none left those horrible men cant follow

Wilfred did not answer He was sure the stage would be driven in
pursuit at breakneck speed and from the breathing of his horse he
feared it could not long endure the contest To be sure Red Kimball
and his men had no lawful excuse to offer the stagedriver for an
attempt to stop them but three men who had once been desperate
highwaymen might not look for lawful excuses on a dark night in a
dreary desert Besides Kimball might with some show of reason argue
that since he was bent on the legitimate object of having a writ served
on Brick Willock he would be justified in preventing Brick from being
warned out of the country

They galloped on in silence Lahoma slightly holding back Night
rapidly drew on



CHAPTER XX

TOGETHER

Before them the trail beaten and rutted stretched interminably
losing itself in the darkness before it slipped over the rounded margin
of the world As darkness increased the trail seemed to waver before
their eyes like a gray scarf that the wind stirs on the ground On
either side of it the nature of the country varied with strange
abruptness now an unbroken stretch of dead sagebrush showing like
isolated tufts in a gigantic clothesbrushsuddenly a wilderness of
white sand shifting as the wind roseagain broken rocks sown
broadcast Before final darkness came the trail itself was
varicolored sometimes white with alkali sometimes skirting low hills
whose sides showed a deep blue streaked with crimson

But now all was black sand alkali gypsumbeds for the night had
fallen

In their wide detour they had endeavored to escape detection from the
stagestation but sheltered by no appreciable inequalities of land
and denied the refuge that even a small grove might have furnished
they had as it were been held up to view on the prairie and though
so far away their horses had been as distinctly outlined as two ants
scurrying across a white page

Wilfred reflected If Kimball when he came out of that restaurant
happened to look in this direction he must have seen us and the first
inquiry at the barn would inform him whore on the horses But he
said nothing until from the rear came the sound longdreaded
telling though far away of bounding horses and groaning wheels

Lahoma

YesI hear them

My horse is about used up Well have to sidetrail or theyll ride
us down

I could go on Lahoma answered as she drew bard on the bit but I
wouldnt like to leave you here by yourself

You couldnt travel that distance by yourself And good as your horse
is it wouldnt last But thank you for thinking of me he added
smiling in the darkness as he dismounted Let me lead your horse as
well as my own

No said Lahoma if leading is to be done Ill do my part She
leaped lightly to the ground and seized her bridle Side by side they
slowly ventured from the trail into the invisible country on the left
They found themselves treading short dead mesquit that did not greatly
obstruct their progress

Keep going Wilfred said when she paused for breath It wouldnt
do for our horses to whinny for those fellows would hear them if it
was thundering Give me your hand

Here it is Lahoma felt about in the darkness My but Im glad
Ive got you Wilfred Oh how they are dashing along Listen how the
man is lashing his whip over those four horses Wish we could see
emmust be grand tearing along at that rate

The stage was rapidly coming up abreast of them and Wilfred felt her
grasp tighten There was a flash of lights a glimpse of the drivers
face as of creased leather as he raised his whip above his headthen
noise and cloud of dust passed on and the lights became trailing sparks
that in a minute or two the wind seemed to blow out

My poor Brick Lahoma wailed Do you think hell take good enough
care of himself from what I wrote in my letters But no he doesnt
think Red Kimball is coming yet for I didnt know it till after Id
written Hes with Bill now waiting for another letter Or for a
telegram

No no Lahoma Wilfred tried to sooth her He has been hiding for
days Why should he come out just at the wrong time You wrote that
youd not send any more messages Brick will be on the lookout for
Kimball He is sure to be watching out for him

I know Brick Lahoma protested seemingly all at once overcome by the
fatigues of her journey and the hopelessness of the situation I was
afraid he wouldnt agree to hide at all and just as soon as you came
away and there wasnt any more prospects of letters hed get
lonesome and tire of staying away from home Hes in that cove this
minute and hell be there when Red Kimball takes the sheriff after
him Her voice quivered with distress

Dont be afraid Lahoma urged Wilfred slipping his arm protectingly
about her Dont grieveIm sure Brick is in a safe place

Well IM not in danger said Lahoma withdrawing from his
involuntary embrace Dont take ME for Brick Maybe youre
rightbut no Im sure he wouldnt be willing to stay out in the
mountains week after weekand during these cold nights For it is
cold right now We must hurry on Wilfred

Theres one comfort said Wilfred as they retraced their way toward
the trail Mr Gledware wont appear as a witness against Brick
Well get him cleared easy enough

But Mr Gledware WILL appear against him and hell swear anything
that Red Kimball wants

I thought he agreed to do that only on condition that a certain pin

YES But Red Kimball brought him that pin just before I left

Brought him the pin that the Indian had

Yes the pearl and onyx pin And Mr Gledware seemed to consider it
so important that I know Red Feather would never have given it up while
he had life

Then

Lahoma shuddered YES You see NOW what a fiend Red Kimball is And
you know NOW what a hold he has over Mr Gledwarecan make him
testify in such a way as to ruin my poor Brick If Brick knew this
hed understand how important it is to flee for his life and never
never let himself be taken But he thinks nobody could get the better
of Red Feather You see if he just dreamed what has happened hed
KNOW Mr Gledware can convict him

We must reach Brick Willock before Red Kimball gets his warrant
exclaimed Wilfred desperately

Yes we must we must Lahoma was growing slightly hysterical I
wont mind any hardship any dangerbut what are we to do You wont
let me ride on aloneand you wouldnt be willing to leave me here and
take the good horse yourself

Youre quite right about that returned the young man promptly We
can only mount again and go as fast as my miserable beast can travel
hoping for some chance to come our way We have the advantage of not
being in the stage where Kimball could keep an eye on us

I ought to be more thankful for that than I am Lahoma sighed They
mounted but as they rode forward Wilfreds horse lagged more and more

Its slow sailing Wilfred remarked but it will give us a chance to
talk By the way do you feel ready for supper From his overcoat
pocket he drew forth the sandwiches

It seemed to Lahoma to show an unfeeling heart to experience hunger at
such a time and to find the ham sandwiches good but it was none the
less true that they were good and the mustard with which the ham was
plastered added a tang of hope and returned a defiant answer to the
cold inquiry of the north wind

After they had eaten and the remaining sandwiches had been carefully
stowed away in Wilfreds capacious pocket they pressed forward with
renewed energy on the part of all save Wilfreds horse By dint of
constant urging it was kept going faster than a walk though it was
obsessed by a consuming desire to lie down In order to keep Lahomas
mind from dwelling on their difficulties and on Bricks peril the
young man maintained conversation at high pressure ably seconded by
his companion who was anxious to show herself undaunted

Wilfred chose as the topic to engage Lahomas mind the future of
Oklahoma Territory The theme filled him with enthusiasm such as no
longsettled commonwealth is able to inspire and though Lahoma
considered herself a Texan she was able to enter into his spirit from
having always lived at the margin of the new country Wilfred dwelt on
the day when Oklahoma would no longer be represented in congress by a
delegate without the right to vote but would take its place as a state
whose constitution should be something new and inspiring in the history
of civil documents

Wilfred meant to have a part in the framing of that constitution and as
he outlined some of his theories of government Lahoma listened with
quick sympathy and appreciation A new feeling for him something like
admiration something like pride stirred within her Here was a man
who meant to do things things eminently worth a mans time and
strength and yet for all his high purposes there was no look no
tone to indicate that he held himself at a higher valuation than those
for whom he meant to labor As in time of stress the strongest man is
given the heaviest burden so he seemed to take to himself a leading
part in the future of his country that all who dwelt within its borders
might find it a freer a richer a better country because of him

Youll call me ambitious said Wilfred glowing Well I am Youll
accuse me of wanting power So I do

Her eyes flashed And Im ambitious for you she cried Go ahead
and get power Take the earth Dont stop till you reach the
seathats the spirit of the West But how did you ever think of
these things

During my long winters on my quartersection nobody in sightjust
the prairie and me Nothing else to think about except the country
thats newborn So I studied out a good many things just thinking
about Oklahoma andand

Lahoma said softly I KNEW there was SOMETHING ELSE you thought about

Yes exclaimed Wilfred thrilled Yesthere WAS something else

A little girl I guess murmured Lahoma gently with a touch of
compassion in her tone

Youve guessed it Lahomayes the dearest little girl in the world

I wish she could have cared for youTHAT waylike your voice
sounds murmured Lahoma

Maybe she can Wilfreds voice grew firmer Yesshe MUST

Have you found a goldmine

What are you talking about Lahoma What has a goldmine to do with
it

Because nothing else goes returned Lahoma decisively You might
get single statehood for Oklahoma and write the constitution yourself
and be elected governorbut youd look just the same to Annabel
unless you had a goldmine

Wilfred gave a jerk at his bridle Whos talking about Annabel he
cried rather sharply He had forgotten that there was an Annabel

Everybody is returned Lahoma somewhat sharply on her own account
everybody is or ought to be

_I_ am not retorted Wilfred springing to the ground just in
timefor his horse on being checked had promptly lain down

Then thats what you get remarked Lahoma severely staring down at
the dark blur on the trail which her imagination correctly interpreted
as the horse stretched out on its side



CHAPTER XXI

THE NORTHER

The wind increased in fury Fortunately it was at their back Wilfred
pressed forward on foot leading Lahomas horse and partly on account
of their unequal position partly because of awkward reserve no more
was said for a long time She bent forward to shelter her face from
the stinging blast while he trod firmly and methodically on and on
braced slightly backward against the wind which was like a hand
pushing him forward

The voice of the wind filled the night It whistled and shrieked in
minor keys dying away at brief intervals to come again with a rush and
roar It penetrated him to the bone for he had compelled her to wrap
herself in his overcoat and when the first stinging grains of fiercely
driven sleet pelted his cheek he smothered a cry of dismay over her
exposed situation

It could not be far past midnight The prospect of a snowstorm in the
bleak lands of the Kiowa appalled him but even while facing that
possibility his mind was busy with Lahomas attitude toward himself
Evidently it had never occurred to her that Annabel had vanished from
his fancy years ago now that she knew she was displeasedmost
unreasonably so he thought Lahoma did not approve of Annabelwhy
should she want him to remain passively under her yoke Unconsciously
his form stiffened in protest as he trudged forward The wind so far
from showing signs of abatement slightly increased no longer with
intervals of pause The sleet changed rapidly first to snow then to
rainthen hail snow and rain alternated or descended simultaneously
always driven with cruel force by the relentless wind

At last Lahoma shouted Its a regular norther Howre you getting
along Wilfred

Despite their discomfort his heart leaped at this unexpected note of
comradeship Had she already forgiven him for not loving Annabel
Oh Lahoma he cried with sudden tenderness what will become of
you

She returned gravely What will become of Brick Northers are bad
but not so bad as some menRed Kimball for instance A terrific
blast shook the halffrozen overcoat about her shoulders as if to
snatch it away Dont you wish the Indians built their villages
closer to the trail Ugh Hadnt we better burrow a stormcellar in
the sand I feel awfully high up in the air

Poor Lahoma

Believe Ill walk with you Wilfred Im turning to a ladyicicle

Do I know it would warm you upa little His teeth showed an
inclination to chatter ComeIll help you down Can you find my
arm

At that moment the horse gave a violent lunge then came to a
standstill quivering and snorting with fright Wilfreds groping arm
found the saddle empty

I didnt have to climb down announced her uncertain voice from a
distance It came seemingly from the level of the plain

Youve fallenyou are hurt he exclaimed but he could not go to her
because the horse refused to budge from the spot and he dared not
loosen his hold

Well Im a little warmer anyway Her voice approached slowly
That was quick exercise I didnt know I was going to do it till I was
down Lit on my feet anyhow Why dont you come to meet me

This miserable beast wont move a foot Come and hold him Lahoma
while I examine in front to find out whats scared him

All right Where are you Can you find my hand

Cant I retorted Wilfred clasping it in a tight grasp

Gracious how wet we are she panted and blown about And frozen

And scolded he added plaintively

But Wilfred it never entered my mind that I was the little girl
Would I have brought up the subject if Id known the truth I never
would Thats why I felt you took advantage  a man ought to bring
up that subject himself even if I AM a girl out West and

But Lahoma

And not another word do I want you to say about it EVER At least
tonight PLEASE Wilfred So I can think about it Ill hold the
horseyou go on and find out whats the matter

Besides you saidyou KNOW you said when we were
strollingthatthat I didnt understand such matters And that youd
tell me when it was TIME

Its time now Lahoma time for you to be somebodys sweetheartand
you saidyou KNOW you said when we were strollingthat Id fill the
bill for you

But I brought up the subject myself and I mean to close it right
short off for its a mans subject Oh how trembly this horse is

But Lahoma

Well what is it

I just wanted to say your name He started away It sounds good to
me

Yes it stands for Oklahoma

It stands for much more than that he called

Yes she persisted in misunderstanding him something big and grand

Not so big he cried now at some distance but what theres room
for more than Brick and Bill in the cove

If she answered the wind drowned her words With extended arms he
groped along the trail with exceeding caution Suddenly his foot
touched an object which on examination proved to be a human body a
gaping wound in its breast

Found anything called Lahoma her voice shivering

He rose quickly and almost stumbled over another object It was a
second body stiffened in death

Ill be there in a minute he called his voice grave and steady
After a brief pause he addedIve found one of the horsesits dead

Oh oh she exclaimed Theyve driven it to death

Wilfred had found a bullet hole behind its ear but he said nothing

Suddenly the horse held by Lahoma gave a plunge broke away and went
galloping back over the trail they had traversed pursued by Lahomas
cry of dismay I couldnt hold him she gasped He lifted me clear
off the ground

Wilfred was also dismayed but he preserved an accent of calm as he
felt his way toward her uttering encouragement for which their
condition offered no foundation But his forced cheerfulness suddenly
changed to real congratulation when his extended hand struck against an
upright wheel

Lahoma heres the stagecoach Its standing just as we saw it last
except for the horses

The stagecoach she marveled coming toward him Oh Wilfred I
see now whats happened One of the horses dropped dead and Red
Kimball and his men jumped on the other three But I wonder what
became of the driver

Get inside he ordered Thank God weve found SOMETHING that we
can get inside of Thatll shelter us till morning anyway and then
we can determine whats to be done

Once in the coach they were safe from the wind which howled above and
around them rattling the small windows and making the springs creak
There was no help for the discomfort of soaking garments but Wilfred
lighted a reserve lantern and placed it in a corner while thick
leather cushions and stageblankets offered some prospect of rest

As no plans could be formed until morning revealed their real plight
they agreed that all conversation should be foregone in order to
recuperate from the hardships of the day for the trials of tomorrow
Lahoma soon fell asleep after her exhausting journey of a day and half
a night since leaving the train at Chickasha

For hours Wilfred sat opposite staring at her worn face pathetic in
its youthful roundness from which the bloom had vanished wondering at
her grace beauty helplessness and perfect faith in him That faith
revealed in every line of the form lying along the seat and spoke from
the unconscious face from which the brown hair was outspread to dry

How oddly her voice had sounded how strange had been its accent when
she said It never entered my mind that _I_ was the little girl Had
she been sorry for the thought to come Did she think less of him
because he had not remained true to Annabel Would it not have been
far better to wait until reaching their destination before hinting of
love Even while perplexed over these problems and while charmed by
that appealing face with the softly parted lips by the figure that
stirred in the rhythm of slumber other thoughts other objects weighed
upon himthe two dead men the dead horse just outside One of those
men might be Red Kimball other bodies might lie there which he had
failed to discover Had the stage been attacked by Indians or by
white desperadoes who found shelter in the Kiowa country In either
case might not the enemy be hovering about the trail possibly waiting
to descend on the coach

Armed and watchful Wilfred waited through the hours When no longer
able to bear the uncertainty he crept from the stage with the lantern
and examined the recent scene of a furious struggle There were only
two slainthe driver and one of Red Kimballs companions Either
Kimball and his other comrade had escaped or had been captured If
any of the attacking party had fallen the bodies had been borne away
Bloodstains indicated that more than two had been shot From that
ghastly sight it was a relief to find himself once more enclosed by the
coach walls with Lahoma so peacefully sleeping

Once he fell into a doze from which he was startled by the impression
that soft noises not of wind or rain were creeping over the earth
He sat erect with the confused fancy that wolves were slinking among
the wheels were glaring up at the windows were dragging away the
corpses The sudden movement of his hand as it grasped his pistol
awoke Lahoma

She opened her eyes wide but did not lift her cheek from the arm that
lay along the cushion There you are she said just as I was
dreaming

He pretended not to be uneasy but his ears strained to catch the
meaning of those mysterious movements of the night Her voice cut
across the vague murmur of the open plain

You only came once

Although her eyes were wide she was apparently but halfawake not a
muscle moved as she looked into his face I thought she murmured
it was on account of Annabel

I went away because I loved you he answered softly I promised
Brick Id go if I felt myself caringand nobody could help caring for
you Thats why I left the country Just as soon as we laughed
togetherit happened Thats why I didnt come again

Yes sighed Lahoma as if it was not so hard to understand now

And thats why Ive come back he added Because Ive kept on
loving you

Yes she sighed again She closed her eyes and seemed to fall
asleep Perhaps it was a sort of knowing sleep that lost most of the
world but clung tenaciously to a few ideas The noises of the night
died away Presently he heard her murmur as a little smile crept about
the parted lips The coves pretty big  theres more room than I
thought

When she was wide awake daylight had slipped through the windows Oh
Wilfred she exclaimed sitting suddenly erect and putting her hands
to her head mechanically Isare we all right

All right said the young man cheerily Theres a good deal of snow
on the ground but it was blown off the trail for the most part Some
friends have provided us with the means of going forward

But I dont understand

Well finish the sandwiches and melt some snow for water and then
mount Looksee those two Indian ponies fastened to the tongue of the
stage Theyll carry us to the next station like the wind

She stared from the window bewildered

I dont know any more about them than you he answered her thoughts
But there they are and here we are He said nothing about the bodies
evidently carried away by those who had brought the ponies Its all
a mysterya mystery of the plains I havent unraveled the very first
thread ofit Whats the use The western way is to take what comes
isnt it whether northers or ponies Theres a much bigger mystery
than all that filling my mind

What is that

You

She bent over the sandwich with heightened color Poor Brick she
murmured as if to divert his thoughts But his sympathy just then was
not for Brick

Lahoma you said that this is a subject a man should bring up

She looked at him brightly still flushing Well

Im bringing it up Lahoma

But we must be planning to save Brick from arrest

Im hoping well get home in timenote that I say HOME Lahoma I
refer to the cove Im hoping well reach home in time to forestall
Red Kimball Weve lost a great deal of time but Brick doubtless is
safely hiding And when we get to the journeys endLahoma do you
know what naturally comes at the journeys end

A marriage

I thought that was what you meant

Will you marry me at the journeys end

Lahoma turned very red and laid down the sandwich Then she laughed
Then she started up Lets get on the ponies she cried



CHAPTER XXII

JOURNEYS END

The snow that morning lay in drifts from five to eight inches across
the trail and to the height of several feet up against those rock
walls raising as on vast artificial tables the higher stretches of
the Kiowa country But by noon the plain was scarcely streaked with
white and when the sun set there was nothing to suggest that a
snowflake had ever fallen in that sandstrewn world The interminable
reaches broken only by the level uplands marked from the plain by
their perpendicular walls and the Wichita Mountains as faint and
unsubstantial to the eye as curved images of smoke against the
skythese dreary monotonies and remotenesses naturally oppress the
traveler with a sense of his insignificance The vast silences too of
brooding treeless wastes sunbaked riverbeds shadowless brown
squares standing for miles at a brief height above the shadowless brown
floor of the plainsilences amidst which only the wind finds a
voicethese too insist drearily on the nothingness of man

But Wilfred and Lahoma were not thus affected The somethingness of
man had never to them been so thrillingly evident They saw and heard
that which was not except for those having eyes and ears to
apprehendroses in the sand birdsong in the desert And when the
rude cabins and hasty tents of the last stagestation in Greer County
showed dark and white against the horizon of a springlike morning
Wilfred cried exultantly

The end of the journey

And Lahoma suddenly showing in her cheeks all the roses that had
opened in her dreams repeated gaily yet a little brokenly

The end of the journey

The end of the journey meant a wedding The plains blossom with
endless flowergardens and the mountains sing together when the end of
the journey means a wedding

Leaving Lahoma at the small new hotel from whose boards the sun began
boiling out resin as soon as it was well aloft Wilfred hurried after a
fresh horse to carry him at once to the cove ten miles away Warning
must be given to Brick Willock first of all Lahoma even had a wild
hope that Brick might devise some means whereby he could attend the
wedding without danger of arrest but to Wilfred this seemed impossible

He had gone but a few steps from the hotel when he came face to face
with the sheriff of Greer County Cutting short his old friends
outburst of pleasure

Look here Mizzoo said Wilfred drawing him aside from the curious
throng on the sidewalk have you got a warrant against Brick Willock

Mizzoo tapped his breast Here he said know where he is

Wilfred sighed with relief At any rate YOU dont he cried

Norat him Wherere you going Bill

I want a horse

No use riding over to the cove remarked his friend with a grin
That is unless you want to call on some friends of minedeputies
theyre living in the dugout just laying for Brick to show himself

But MIZZOO expostulated Wilfred why are you taking so much
trouble against my best friend The warrant ought to be enough and if
you cant get a chance to serve it on him thats not your fault Your
deputies havent any right in that cove and Im going to smoke em
out

Mizzoo chewed with a deprecatory shake of his head See here old
tap he murmured dont you say nothing about being Brick Willocks
friend The whole country is roused against him Heard of them three
bodies

Wilfred explained that he had just come to town

Well good lord then the pleasure Im going to have in telling you
something you dont know and something thats full of meat Lets go
wheres we can sit downthis aint no standing news The lank
redfaced sheriff started across the street without looking to see if
he were followed

He did not stop till he was in his room at the hotel Now he said
locking the door sit down Yes you BET I got a warrant against
Brick Willock It was sworn out by a fellow named Jeremiah
Kimballyou know him as Red The forms regular charges weighty
Brick Willock was once a member of Red Kimballs gang hes the only
one that didnt come in to get his amnesty See Well he killed Reds
brothershot im Gledwares coming on to witness to it Willock
will claim he done the deed to save Gledwares lifehis and his little
gals But Gledware will show it was otherwise Red told me all about
it Bricks a murderer and worst of all hes a murderer without an
amnestythats the only difference between him and Red Well old
tap I took my oath to do my duty You know what that signifies

But theres no truth in all this rot Brick HAD to shoot Kansas
Kimball

Well let him show that in court My business is to take him alive
That aint all thats just the preface Listen If youll believe
me the stage that Red and his pards was incoming here to swear out
the warrant they wasthat there stage was set on by this friend of
yoursyes Brick has gathered together some of his old pards and is a
highwaymanwhy he shot one of Reds witnesses and he shot the
driver

I know something about that holdup cried Wilfred scornfully It
must have been done by Indians

Red SAW Brick amongst the gang He RECOGNIZED him Well Red and his
other pard gets on horses they cuts loose and comes like lightning
and gets here and tells the storyand maybe you think this community
aint arearing and acharging and asniffing for blood Thered be
more excitement against Brick Willock if there was more community but
such as they is is concentrated

Mizzoo listen to reason Dont you understand that Red wants
revenge and has misrepresented this Indian attack to tally with his
other lies

I wouldnt say nothing against Red old tap It aint gentlemanly to
call dead folk liars

Dead folk echoed Wilfred starting up

I KNOWED you didnt understand that Reds off the trail forever
Mizzoo rejoined gently I knowed you wouldnt be accusing him so
rancid had you been posted on his funeral

Wilfred felt a great relief then a great wonder

Hes dead I dont say hes better off I dont know but I guess the
world is I dont like to censure them thats departed Brick Willock
is still with us and him the county cant say enough against His
life wouldnt be worth two bits if anybody laid eyes on im Consider
his highhanded doings Wasnt it enough in the past to kill Reds
brother but what he must needs collect his pals stop the stagecoach
shoot two men trying to get Red and one of em the innocent driver
You say yes But hold on that aint all he done No sir The very
next day after Red swore out that warrantand it was yesterday if you
ask MEwhat is saw when we men of Mangum comes out of our doors
Three corpses lying on the sidewalk side by side You say what
corpses Wait Im coming to that One was that driver one was the
pard that got shot with the driver The other was Red Kimball his own
self

I knew the bodies had been carried away from the trail exclaimed
Wilfred in perplexity He related his discoveries of the stormy night

But you didnt know they had been brung to town all this distance to
be laid beside Red You didnt know Red had been stabbed so he could
be added too You didnt know the three of them had been left on the
street to rile up every man with blood in his veins Why Wilfred its
an insult to the whole state of Texas Such highhanded doings aint
to be bore If Brick Willock dont want to be tried in court is that
an excuse for killing off all that might witness against him It might
of been ONCE But were determined to have a county of lawabiding
citizens Such free living has got to be nipped in the bud or well
have another NoMans Land Were determined to live under the laws
This is civilization The cattle business is dead land is getting
tied up by titledeeds the deers gone and theres nothing left but
civilization And I am theeras sheriff of Greer County I am aI
am the angel of civilization you may say

Mizzoo started up too excited to notice Wilfreds suddenly distorted
face It was no time to display a sense of the ludicrous the young
man hotly burst into passionate argument and reasonable hypothesis

Weve got civilization Mizzoo declared doggedly and we aim to hold
on to her you bet Theres going to be no such doings as three
corpses stretched out on the sidewalk for breakfast not while Im at
the helm Howd that look if wrote up for the New York papers That
aint allremember that ghost I used to worry my life out over trying
to meet up with on the trail Him or her or it that haunted every
step of the way from Abilene to the Gulf of Mexico Its a flitting
that ghost is Well I dont claim that no ghost is in my
jurisdiction Bricks flesh and blood theres bone to him As my
aunt Miss Sue of Missouri used to say hes some MAN

Waving aside Mizzoos ghost Wilfred elaborated his theory of an Indian
attack described Bricks peaceable disposition his gentleness to
Lahomathen dwelt on the friendship between himself and Brick and the
relations between himself and Bricks ward

It all comes to this Mizzoo declared if you could make me think
Willock a harmless lamb and as innocent it wouldnt change conditions
This neighborhood calls for his life andd take it if in reach and my
warrant calls for his arrest All I can promise is to get him if
possible behind the bars before the mob gets him in a rope As my
aunt whom I have ofttimes quoted my aunt Miss Sue of Missouri a
woman of elegant sensethats the word she used to say with the
bark on it

Wilfred permitted himself the pleasure of taunting Mizzoo with the very
evident truth that before Willock was hanged or imprisoned he must
first be caught

Mizzoo grinned goodnaturedly Yap Well weve got a clew locked up
in jail right now that could tell us something I judge and will tell
us something before set free its name is Bill Atkins Hes a wise old
coon but as sour as a boiled owlnothing as yet to be negotiated
with him than if he was a bobcat catched in a trap Were hoping
timell mellow himtime and the prospect of being took out and swung
from the nearest limbspeaking literary not by nature as you know
trees is as scarce about here as Brick Willock himself

Wilfred insisted on an immediate visit to Bill Brick declared he
wouldnt tell Bill his hidingplace he said for he didnt want to
get him into trouble Hell tell me if he knows anythingand if he
doesnt its an outrage to shut him up old as he is and as rheumatic
as hes old

On the way to the rudely improvised prison Mizzoo defended himself
He wasnt too old and rheumatic to fight like a wildcatwhy he had
to be lifted up bodily and carried into his cell Not a word can we
get out of him or a bite of grub into him I believe that old
codgers just too obstinate to die

When they reached the prison door the crowd gathered about them eager
for news watching Mizzoo unfasten the door as if he were unlocking the
secret to Willocks whereabouts There were loud imprecations on the
head of the murderer and fierce prophecies as to what would happen to
Bill if he preserved his incriminating silence It seemed but a moment
before hurrying forms from many directions packed themselves into a
mass before the jail

The cells were in the basement The only entrance to the building was
by means of a flight of six steps leading to an unroofed platform
before the door of the story proper Mizzoo and Wilfred standing on
this platform were lifted above the heads of perhaps a hundred men who
watched eagerly the dangling bunch of keys Mizzoo had stationed three
deputies at the foot of the steps to keep back the mob for if the
excited men once rushed into the jail nothing could check their course
The deputies tall broadshouldered fellows pushed back the
threatening tide always with goodnatured protestswords half
bantering half appealing repulsive thrusts of the arms rough but
inflicting no hurt So peaceful a minute before had been the Square
it was difficult to comprehend the sudden spirit of danger

Mizzoo whispered to Wilfred Wed better get in as quick as possible

The words were lost in the increasing roar of voices He spoke again

When I swing open the door that bunch will try to make a run for it
You jump inside and Ill be after you like a shot Well lock
ourselves in

Hey Mizzoo shouted a voice from the crowd bring out that old
cuss Drag him to the platform we want to hear what hes got to say

Say Mr Sheriff Tell him if he wont come to us well go to him
Weve got to know where Brick Willocks hiding and thats all about
it

Sure growled a third What kind of a town is this anyway A
refuge for highwaymen and murderers

A struggle took place at the foot of the stairs not so goodnaturedly
as heretofore A reasoning voice was heard Just let me say a word
to the boys

Yes called others lets hear HIM

There was a surging forward and a man was lifted literally over the
heads of the three deputies he reached the platform breathless
disheveled but triumphant It was the survivor of Red Kimballs band

Mizzoo mistaking his coming for a general rush had hastily relocked
the door and he and Wilfred defended themselves with drawn revolvers

I aint up here to do no harm called the exhighwayman I aint
got the spirit for warfare My chief is killed my pards is dead Even
that innocent stagedriver what knew nothing of us is killed in the
attack that Brick Willock made on us in the dark and behind our backs
Howre you going to grow when the whole world knows you aint nothing
but a den of snakes You may claim its all Brick Willock I say if
hes bigger than the town if he murders and stabs and you cant help
it then the town aint as good as him My lifes in danger I dont
know if Ill draw another breath What kind of a reputation is that for
you to send abroad Theres a man in this jail can tell you where
Willocks hiding Good day

The speaker was down the steps in two leaps and the deputies drew
aside to let him pass out Civic pride above all civic ambition had
been touched to the quick A hoarse roar followed the speech and
cries for Bill grew frantic Mizzoo afraid to unlock the door stared
at Wilfred in perplexity

I told you they had civilization on the brain he muttered The old
times are past I daresnt make a move toward that lock

Drop the keys behind youIll get em Wilfred murmured Step a
little forward Say something to em

Aint got nothing to say growled Mizzoo glaring at the mob These
boys are in the right of it thats how I feelcuss that obstinate old
bobcat its his own fault if they string him up

Here they come Wilfred exclaimed

Steady now old Mizzooweve whipped packs of wolves before
todaycoyotes crazy with hungerbig gray loafers in the rockseh
Mizzoo He shouted to the deputies who had been pushed against the
railing Give it to em boys

But the deputies did not fire and the mob though chafing with mad
impatience did not advance It was a single figure that swept up the
steps unobstructed aided indeed by the mass of packed men in the
streeta figure slight and erect tingling with the necessity of
action to which every vein and muscle responded tingling so vitally
so electrically that the crowd also tingled not understanding but
none the less thrilled

Lahoma Wilfred was at her side You here

Yes Im here she returned breathlessly her face flaming with
excitement Im going to talk to these peoplelet me have that
She took the revolver from his unresisting hand uncocked it and
slipped it into her bosom Then she faced the mob and held up her
empty hand



CHAPTER XXIII

FACING THE MOB

It was the first time Lahoma had ever faced an audience larger than
that composed of Brick and Bill and Willock for in the city she had
been content to play an unobtrusive part listening to others
commenting inwardly Speech was now but a mode of action and in her
effort to turn the sentiment of the mob she sought not for words but
emotions Bills life was at stake What could she say to make them
Bills friends After her uplifted hand had brought tense silence she
stood at a loss her eyes big with the appeal her tongue refused to
utter

The mob was awed by that light in her eyes by the crimson in her
cheeks by her beauty freshness and grace They would not proceed to
violence while she stood there facing them Her power she recognized
but she understood it was that of physical presence When she was gone
her influence would depart They knew Brick and Bill had sheltered her
from her tenderest years they admired her fidelity Whatever she
might say to try to move their hearts would come from a sense of
gratitude and would be received in tolerant silence The more guilty
the highwayman the more commendable her loyalty But it would not
change their purpose as if waiting for a storm to pass they stood
stolid and closemouthed slightly bent forward unresisting but
unmoved

Im a western girl Lahoma said at last and ever since Brick
Willock gave me a home when I had none Ive lived right over yonder at
the foot of the mountains I was there when the cattlemen came before
the Indians had given up this country and I was here when the first
settlers moved in and when the soldiers drove them out I was living
in the cove with Brick Willock when people came up from Texas and
planted miles and miles of wheat and I used to play with the rusty
plows and machinery they left scattered aboutafter the three years
drought had starved them back to their homes Then Old Man Walker came
to Red River sent his cowboys to drive us out of the cove and your
sheriff led the bunch And it was Brick and myself that stood them off
with our guns our backs to the wall and our powder dry and we never
saw Mizzoo in our cove again So you see I ought to be able to talk
to western men in a way they can appreciate and if theres anybody
here thats not a western manhe couldnt understand our style
anyhowhed better go where hes needed for out West you need only
western menlike Brick Willock for instance

At reference to the wellknown incident of Mizzoos attempt to drive
Willock from the cove there was a sudden wave of laughter none the
less hearty because Mizzoos face had flushed and his mouth had opened
sheepishly But at the recurrence of Willocks name the crowd grew
serious They felt the justice of her claim that out West only western
men were needed they excused her for thinking Brick a model type but
let any one else hold him up before them as a model

Lahomas manner changed it grew deeper and more forceful

Men I want to talk to you about this casewill you be the jury
Consider what kind of man swore out that warrant against Brickthe
leader of a band of highwaymen And whos his chief witness You
dont know Mr Gledware I do Youve heard hes a rich and
influential citizen in the East Thats true But Im going to tell
you something to show what he ISand what Brick Willock is just one
thing thats all Ill say about the character of either As to Red
Kimball you dont have to be told Im not going to talk about the
general features of the caseas to whether Brick was ever a highwayman
or not as to whether he killed Reds brother to save me and my
stepfather or did it in cold blood as to whether he held up the stage
or not These things youve discussed youve formed opinions about
them I want to tell you something you havent heard Will you
listen

At first no one spoke Then from the crowd came a measured impartial
voice We got lots of time

She was not discouraged by the intimation in the tone that all her
speaking was in vain Several in the crowd looked reproachfully at him
who had responded feeling that Lahoma deserved more consideration but
in the main the men nodded grim approval They had plenty of
timebut at the end of it Bill would either tell all he knew or

Lahoma plunged into the midst of her narrative

One evening Brick came on a deserted movers wagon hed traveled all
day with nothing to eat or drink and he got into the wagon to escape
the blistering sun In there he found a dead woman stretched on her
pallet He had a great curiosity to see her face so he began lifting
the cloth that covered her He saw a pearl and onyx pin at her throat
It looked like one his mother used to wear So he dropped the cloth and
never looked at her face She had died the evening before and he knew
she wouldnt have wanted any one to see her THEN And he dug a grave
in the sand though she was nothing to him and buried hernever
seeing her faceand covered the spot with a great pyramid of stones
and prayed for her little girlI was her little girlthe Indians had
carried me away Youll say that was a little thing that anybody would
have buried the poor helpless body Maybe so But about not looking
at her facewell I dont know it WAS a little thing of course but
somehow it just seems to show that Brick Willock wasnt littlehad
something great in his soul you know Seems to show that he couldnt
have been a common murderer Its something youll have to feel for
yourselves nobody could explain it so youd see if you dont
understand already

The men stared at her somewhat bewildered saying nothing In some
breasts a sense of something delicate not to be defined was stirred

One day Lahoma resumed Brick saw a white man with some Indians
standing near that grave He couldnt imagine what they meant to do
so he hid thinking them after him Years afterward Red Feather
explained why they came that evening to the pile of stones The white
man was Mr Gledware After Red Kimballs gang captured the
wagontrain Mr Gledware escaped married Red Feathers daughter and
lived with the Indians hed married immediately to save his life and
the tribe suspected he meant to leave Indian Territory at the first
chance Mr Gledware great coward was terrified night and day lest
the suspicions of the Indians might finally cost him his life

It wasnt ten days after the massacre of the emigrants till he decided
to give a proof of good faith Too great a coward to try to get away
and caring too much for his wifes rich lands to want to leave he
told about the pearl and onyx pinhe said he wanted to give it to Red
Flower A pretty good Indian Red Feather wastrue friend of mine HE
wouldnt rob graves But he said hed take Mr Gledware to the place
and if he got that pin theyd all know he meant to live amongst them
forever THATS why the band was standing there when Brick Willock
looked from the mountaintop Mr Gledware dug up the body after the
Indians had rolled away the stonesthe body of his wifemy
motherthe body whose face Brick Willock wouldnt look at in its
helplessness of death Mr Gledware is the principal witness against
Brick If you dont feel what kind of man he is from what Ive said
nobody could explain it to you

From several of the intent listeners burst involuntary denunciations of
Gledware while on the faces of others showed a momentary gleam of
horror

Red Kimballs confederate spoke loudly harshly But who killed Red
Kimball and his pard and the stagedriver if it wasnt Brick Willock

I think it was Red Feathers band Im witness to the fact that
Kimball agreed to bring Mr Gledware the pearl and onyx pin on
condition that Mr Gledware appear against Brick After Mr Gledware
deserted Red Flower or rather after her death Red Feather carried
that pin about him Mr Gledware knew hed never give it up alive He
was always afraid the Indian would find himand at last he did find
him But Red Kimball got the pincould that mean anything except that
Kimball discovered the Indians hidingplace and killed him But for
that Id think it Red Feather who attacked the stage and killed Red
Kimball As it is I believe it must have been his friends

Now youve said something cried Mizzoo Boys dont you think its
a reasonable explanation

Some of them did evidently for the grim resolution on their faces
softened others however were unconvinced

A stern voice was raised Let Brick Willock come do his own
explaining Bill Atkins knows where hes hiding outand we got to
know Weve started in to be a lawabiding county and that there
warrant against Willock has got the right of way

Youve no warrant against Bill cried Wilfred stepping to the edge
of the platform therefore youve violated the law in locking him up

Thats so exclaimed Red Kimballs former comrade Well turn im
loose thats what we askLET him goopen the jail door

Hes locked up for his own safety shouted Mizzoo You fellows
agree to leave him alone and Ill turn him out quick enough You talk
about the lawwhat you want to do to Bill aint overly lawful I take
it

If he gives up his secret we aint going to handle him rough was the
quick retort

Lahoma found that the softening influence she had exerted was already
fast dissipating They bore with her merely because of her youth and
sex She cried out desperately

Is there nothing I can say to move your hearts Has my story of that
pearl and onyx pin been lost on you Couldnt you understand after
all Are you western men and yet unable to feel the worth of a
western man like Brick How he clothed me and sheltered me when the
man who should have supported the child left in his care neglected
her How he taught me and was always tender and gentlenever a
cross worda man like THAT And you think he could kill I dont
know whether Bill was told his hidingplace or not But if _I_ knew
it do you think Id tell And if Bill betrayed himbut Bill
wouldnt do it Thank God Ive been raised with real MEN men that
know how to stand by each other and be true to the death You want
Bill to turn traitor I say what kind of men are YOU

She turned to Wilfred blinded by hot tears Oh say something to
them she gasped clinging to his arm

Go on murmured Wilfred I couldnt reach em and you made a point
that time Go ondont give em a chance to think

But I cantIve said all I had to say

Dont stop dear for Gods sakethe case is desperate Youll have
to do itfor Bill

And that isnt all Lahoma called in a broken pathetic voice as she
turned her pale face upon the curious crowd That isnt all You know
Brick and Bill have been all I hadall in this world You know they
couldnt have been sweeter to me if theyd been the nearest of
kinthey were more like women than men somehow when they spoke to me
and sat with me in the dugoutand I guess I know a little about a
mothers love because Ive always had Brick and Bill But one day
somebody else came to the cove andand this somebody else
wellhethis somebody else wants to marry metoday This was the end
of our journey she went on blindly andand it is our weddingday
I thought there must be SOME way to get Brick to the wedding but you
see how it is Andand well have to marry without him But Bills
herein that jailbecause he wouldnt betray his friend And I
couldnt marry without either Brick or Bill could I

She took her quivering hand from Wilfreds sturdy arm and moving to
the top of the steps held out her trembling arms appealingly

MEN Give me Bill

The crowd was with her now No doubt of that All fierceness gone
tears here and there broad grins to hide deep emotion open
admiration touched with tenderness in the eyes that took in her shy
flowerlike beauty

You shall have Bill shouted the spokesman of the crowd And other
voices cried Give her Bill Give her Bill

Bring him out continued the spokesman in stentorian tones Well
not ask him a question Fellows clear a path for em

A broad lane was formed through the throng of smiling men whom the
sudden unexpected light of love had softened magically

While Mizzoo hastened to Bills cell some one exclaimed Invite us
too Make it a town wedding

And another started the shout Hurrah for Lahoma

Lahoma who had taken refuge behind Wilfreds protection wept and
laughed in a rosy glow of triumphant joy

Mizzoo presently reappeared leaving the door wide open He walked to
the stairs the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes deepcut with
appreciation of the situation Fellows he called he says you
carried him in there and dinged if you wont have to carry him out
for not a step will he take

At this unexpected development a burst of laughter swelled into a
roar After that mighty merriment Bill was as safe as a babe Twenty
volunteers pressed forward to carry the weddingguest from his cell
And when the old man slowly but proudly followed Wilfred and Lahoma to
the hotel where certain preparations were to be madeparticularly as
touching Bills personal appearancethe town of Mangum began gathering
at the newlyerected church whither they had been invited

When the four friendsfor Mizzoo joined themdrove up to the church
door in the only carriage available Bill descended stiffly his eyes
gleaming fiercely from under snowy locks as if daring any one to ask
him a question about Brick But nobody did



CHAPTER XXIV

MINE ENEMY

The general suspicion that Bill Atkins knew more about Brick Willock
than he had revealed was not without foundation though the extent of
his knowledge was more limited than the town supposed Bill had
carried to his friendhidden in the crevice in the mountaintopthe
news of Red Kimballs death since then they had not seen each other

Skulking along wooded gullies by day creeping down into the cove at
night Willock had unconsciously reverted to the habits of thought and
action belonging to the time of his outlawry He was again in spirit
a highwayman though his hostility was directed only against those
seeking to bring him to justice The softening influence of the years
spent with Lahoma was no longer apparent in his shifting bloodshot
eyes his crouching shoulders his furtive hand ever ready to snatch
the weapon from concealment This sinister aspect of wildness
intensified by straggling whiskers and uncombed locks gave to his
giant form a kinship to the huge grotesquely shaped rocks among which
he had made his den

He heard of Red Kimballs death with bitter disappointment He had
hoped to encounter his former chief to grapple with him to hurl him
perhaps from the precipice overlooking Bills former home If in his
fall Kimball with arms wound about his waist had dragged him down to
the same death what matter Though his enemy was now no more the
sheriff held the warrant for his arrestas if the dead man could still
strike a mortal blow The sheriff might be overcomehe was but a man
That piece of paper calling for his arrestan arrest that would mean
at best years in the penitentiaryhad behind it the whole state of
Texas

To Willocks feverish imagination the warrant became personified a
mysterious force not to be destroyed by material means it was not
only paper but spirit And it had come between him and Lahoma it had
shut him off from the possibility of a peaceful old age The cove was
no longer home but a hidingplace

He did not question the justice of this sequel to his earlier life No
doubt deeds of long ago never punished demanded a sacrifice He hated
the agents of this justice not so much because they threatened his
liberty his life as because they stepped in between himself and
Lahoma Always a man of expedients he now sought some way of
frustrating justice and naturally his plans took the color of
violence Denied the savage joy of killing Red Kimballand he would
have killed him with as little compunction as if he had been a
wolfhis thoughts turned toward Gledware

Gledware was the only witness of the deed for which the warrant
demanded his arrest Willock wished many of his other deeds had been
prompted by impulses as generous as those which had led to Kansas
Kimballs death Perhaps it was the irony of justice that he should be
threatened by the one act of bloodshed which had saved Lahomas life
If he must be hanged or imprisoned because he had not like the rest of
the band given himself up for official pardon it was as well to
suffer from one deed as from another But it would be better still as
in the past to escape all consequences Without Gledware they could
prove nothing

Would Gledware testify now that Red Kimball who had bought his
testimony with the death of the Indian no longer lived to exact
payment Willock felt sure he would In the first place Gledware had
placed himself on record as a witness hence could hardly retreat in
the second place he would doubtless be anxious to rid himself of the
danger of ever meeting Willock whom his conscience must have caused
him to hate with the hatred of the man who wrongs his benefactor

Willock transferred all his rage against the dead enemy to the living
He reminded himself how Gledware had caused the death of Red Feather
not in the heat of fury or in blind terror but in coldblooded
bargaining He meditated on Gledwares attitude toward Lahoma he
thought nothing good of him he magnified the evil That scene at the
grave of his wifeand Red Feathers account of how he had dug up the
body for a mere pin of pearl and onyx Ought such a creature to
live to condemn him to bring sorrow on the stepdaughter he had basely
refused to acknowledge

To wait for the coming of the witness would be to lose an opportunity
that might never recur Willock would go to him In doing so he
would not only take Gledware by surprise but would leave the only
neighborhood in which search would be made for himself Thus it came
about that while the environs of the cove were being minutely examined
Brick riding his fastest pony was on the way to Kansas City

He reached Kansas City without unusual incident where he was accepted
naturally as a product of the West Had his appearance been twice as
uncouth twice as wild it would have accorded all the better with
western superstitions that prevailed in this city fast forgetting that
it had been a western outpost At the hotel whose situation he knew
from Lahomas letters he learned that Gledware was neither there nor
at his home in the country The countryhouse was closed up and in
fact there was a rumor that it was sold or was about to be sold One
of the porters happened to know that Gledware had gone for a weeks
diversion down in the Ozarks There were a lake a clubhouse a
dancinghall as yet unopened The season was too early for the usual
crowd at Ozark Lodge but the warm wave that nearly always came at this
time of year had prompted a sudden outing party which might last no
longer than the warm wave

Willock took the first train south and rode with the car window upthe
outside breath was the breath of balmy summer though the trees stood
bleak and leafless against the sky Two days ago snow had fallenbut
the birds did not remember it Seven hours brought him to a lonely
wagontrail called Ozark Lodge because after winding among hills
several miles it at last reached the clubhouse of that name overlooking
the lake He left the train in the dusk of evening and walked briskly
away the only moving figure in the wilderness

His pace did not slacken till a gleam as of fallen sky cupped in
nightfringe warned him that the clubhouse must be near A turn of a
hill brought it into view the windows not yet aglow Nearer at hand
was the boathouse seemingly deserted But as Willock now grown
wary crept forward among the postoaks and blackjacks well screened
from observation by chinkapin masses of gray interlocked network he
discovered two figures near the platform edging the lake Neither was
the one he sought but from their being therethey were Edgerton
Compton and Annabelhe knew Gledware could not be far away

No Annabel was saying decisively and yet with an accent of regret
No Edgerton I cant

But our last boatride he urged Dont refuse me the last ridea
ride to think about all my life Im going away tomorrow at noon as I
promised But early in the morning

I have promised HIM she said with lingering sadness in her voice
So I must go with him He has already engaged the boatman Hell be
here at seven waiting for me So you see

Annabel I shall be here at seven also he exclaimed impetuously

But why I must go with him Edgerton You see that

Then I shall row alone

Why would you add to my unhappiness she pleaded

I shall be here at seven he returned grimly while you and he take
your morning boatride I shall row alone

She turned from him with a sigh and he followed her dejectedly up the
path toward the clubhouse

She had lost some of the fresh beauty which she had brought to the
cove and her step was no longer elastic but this Willock did not
notice He gave little heed to their tones their gestures their
looks in which love sought a thin disguise wherein it might show itself
unnamed He had seized on the vital fact that in the morning Annabel
and Gledware would push off from the boathouse steps presumably
alone and it would be early morning Perhaps Gledware would come
first to the boathouse there to wait for Annabel In that case he
would not ride with Annabel The lake was deepdeep as Willocks hate

Willock passed the night in the woods sometimes walking against time
among the hills sometimes seated on the ground brooding The night
was without breath without coolness Occasionally he climbed a
rounded elevation from which the clubhouse was discernible No lights
twinkled among the barren trees All in that wilderness seemed asleep
save himself The myriad insects that sing through the spring and
summer months had not yet found their voices there was no trill of
frogs not even the hooting of an owlno sound but his own breathing

At break of dawn he crept into the boathouse like a shadow
barefooted bareheadedthe clubhouse was not yet awake He looked
about the barnlike room for a hidingplace Walls floor ceiling were
bare Near the door opening on the lake was a rustic bench impossible
as a refuge Only in one corner where empty boxes and a disused skiff
formed a barricade could he hope for concealment He glided thither
and on the floor between the dusty wall of broad boards and the jumbled
partition he found a man stretched on his back

At first he thought he had surprised a sleeper but as the figure did
not move he decided it must be a corpse He would have fled but for
his need of this corner He bent downthe man was bound hand and
foot In the mouth a gag was fastened Neck and ankles were tied to
spikes in the wall

Willock swiftly surveyed the lake and the sloping hill leading down
from the clubhouse Nobody was near As he stared at the landscape
the front door of the clubhouse opened He darted hack to the corner
Pardner he said I got to ask your hospitality for a spell and if
you move so as to attract attention I got to fix you better I didnt
do this here pardner but you shore look like some of my handiwork in
days past and gone Ill share this corner with you for a while and
if you dont give me away to them thats coming I promise to set you
free Thats fair I guess A man aint all bad says Brick as
unties the knots that other men has tied says he Just lay still and
comfortable and well see whats coming

Presently there were footsteps in the path and to Willocks intense
disappointment Gledware and Annabel came in together They were in
the midst of a conversation and at the first few words he found it
related to Lahoma The boatman who had promised to bring the skiff for
them at sevenit developed that Gledware had no intention of doing the
rowinghad not yet come They sat down on the rustic bench their
voices distinctly audible in all parts of the small building

Her closest living relative Gledware said is a greataunt living
in Boston As soon as I found out who she wasId always supposed her
living among Indians and that it would be impossible to find herbut
as soon as I learned the truth without saying anything to HER I wrote
to her greataunt Ive never been in a position to take care of
LahomaI felt that I ought to place her with her own family I got an
answerabout what you would expect Theyd give her a homeI told
them what a respectable girl she isfairly creditable
appearanceintelligent enough But they couldnt stand those
people she lives withcriminals you know Annabel
highwaymenmurderers Imagine Brick Willock in a Boston
drawingroom But you couldnt

No Annabel agreed Poor Lahoma And I know shed never give him
up

Thats itshes immovable Shed insist on taking him along But he
belongs to another agea different country He couldnt understand
He thinks when youve anything against a man the proper move is to
kill im Hes just like an Indiana wild beast Wouldnt know what
we meant if we talked about civilization His religion is the knife
Wellyou see if he were out of the way Lahoma would have her chance

But couldnt he be arrested

Thats my only hope If he were hanged or locked up for a certain
number of years Lahomad go East But as long as hes at large
shell wait for him to turn up Shell stay right there in the cove
till she dies of old age if hes free to visit her at odd moments
Its her idea of fidelity and its true that he did take her in when
she needed somebody Theres a move on foot now to arrest him for an
old crimea murder I witnessed the deedIll testify if called on
Lahoma will hate me for thatbut itll be the greatest favor I could
possibly do her She knows I mean to appear against him and she
thinks me a brute But if I can convict Willock itll place Lahoma in
a family of wealth and refinement

He broke off with Wonder why that old deaf boatman doesnt come He
walked impatiently to the head of the steps and stared out over the
lake Somebody out there now he exclaimed Ohits Edgerton
rowing about

He returned to the bench but did not sit down Annabel he said
abruptly you promised me to name the day this morning

Yes she responded very faintly

And I am sure dear he added in a deep resonant voice that in time
you will come to care for me as I care for you nowyou the only woman
I have ever loved I understand about Edgerton but you see you
couldnt marry himin fact he couldnt marry anybody for years he
has nothing And these earlier attachments that we think the
biggest things in our liveswell they just dwindle Annabel they
dwindle as we get the true perspective I know your happiness depends
upon me and it rejoices me to know it I can give you all you
wantall you can dream ofand Im manoftheworld enough to
understand that happiness depends just on thatgetting what you want

Annabel started up abruptly I think I heard the boat scraping
outside

Yes hes there Come dear and before the ride is ended you must
name the day

DONT she exclaimed sharply He

Hes as deaf as a post my dear Gledware murmured gently Thats
why I selected him I knew wed want to talkI knew youd name the
day

He helped her down the rattling boards

Brick Willock rose softly and stole toward the opening his eyes filled
with a strange light They no longer glared with the bloodlust of a
wild beast but showed gloomy and perplexed the words spoken
concerning himself had sunk deep

The boatman sat with his back to Gledware and Annabel He wore a long
dingy coat of light gray and a huge battered straw hat whose wide brim
hid his hair and almost eclipsed his face Willock careful not to
show himself stared at the skiff as it shot out from the landing his
brow wrinkled in anxious thought He felt strange and dizzy and at
first fancied it was because of the resolution that had taken
possession of himthe resolution to return to Greer County and give
himself up This purpose as unreasoning as his plan to kill Gledware
grew as fixed in his mind as half an hour before his other plan had
been

To go voluntarily to the sheriff unresistingly to hold out his wrists
for the handcuffsthat would indeed mark a new era in his life A
wild Indian wouldnt do that he mused nor a wild beast I guess I
understand after all And if thats the way to make Lahoma happy

No wonder he felt queer but his lightheadedness did not rise as a
matter of fact entirely from subjective stormthreatenings There was
something about that boatmannow when he tilted up his head slightly
and the hat failed to concealwas it possible

My God whispered Willock its Red Feather

And Gledware with eyes only for Annabel finding nothing beyond her
but a long gray coat a big straw hat and two rowing armsdid not
suspect the truth

In a flash Willock comprehended all The Indian had dropped the pin
in Kimballs path and Kimball finding it had carried it to Gledware
as if Red Feather were dead The Indian had led his braves against the
stagecoachKimball had fallen under his knife Yonder man in the
corner bound and gagged was doubtless the old deaf boatman engaged by
Gledware Red Feather had taken his place that he might row Gledware
far out on the lake

But Annabel was in the boat If the Indian

Far away toward the east Edgerton Compton was rowing not near enough
to intervene in case the Indian attempted violence but better able
than himself to lend assistance if the boat were overturned Willock
could in truth do nothing except shout a warning and this he
forebore lest it hasten the impending catastrophe He remained
therefore halfhidden crouching at the doorway his eyes glued to the
rapidly gliding boat with its three figures clearcut against the
first faint sunglow



CHAPTER XXV

GLEDWARES POSSESSIONS

Red Feathers mind was not constituted to entertain more than one
leading thought at a time Ever since the desertion and death of his
daughter revenge had been his dominant passion It was in order to
find Gledware that he had haunted the trail during the years of
lahomas youth always hoping to discover him in the new
countrygliding behind herds of cattle listening to scraps of talks
among the cattlemen earning from Mizzoo the uneasy designation the
ghost

Thanks to the reading aloud of Lahomas letter he had learned of
Gledwares presence in the city which he had known years before as
Westport Landing He went thither unbewildered by its marvelous
changes undistracted by its tumultuous flood of lifefor his mind was
full of his mission he could see only the blood following the blade of
his knife heard nothing but a groan a deathrattle

Gledwares presence in the boat this morning had been made possible
only by the interposition of Lahoma but for the Indians deepseated
affection for her whom he regarded as a child the man now smiling into
Annabels pale face would long ago have found his final restingplace
It was due to the Indians singleness of thought that Lahomas plan had
struck him as good Gledware stripped of all his possessions
slinking as a beggar from door to door no roof no bed but sky and
earththat is what Red Feather had meant

He had believed Gledware glad of the respite That he should accept
the alternative seemed reasonable There was a choice only between
death and povertyand Gledware wished to live so desperatelyso
basely The chief cared little for life still he would
unhesitatingly have preferred the most meager existence to a knife in
his heart how much more then this craven white man But the plan
had failed because Gledware did not believe death was the other
alternative Never in the remotest way had it occurred to the avenger
that Gledware could be spared should he prove false to his oath Red
Feather was less a man with passions than a cold relentless fate This
fate would surely overcome the helpless wretch should he cling to his
riches

As Red Feather skimmed the water with long sweeps of his oars never
looking back the voices of his passengers came to his ears without
meaning He was thinking of the last few days and how this mornings
ride was their fitting sequel The early sunbeams were full on him as
he tilted back his head but they showed no emotion on his face
hardset and dully red in the clear radiance

Crouching near the summerhouse at Gledwares place he had overheard
Red Kimball boast to bring Gledware the pearl and onyx pin Then had
shot through his darkened mind the suspicion that Gledware meant to
escape the one condition on which his life was to be spared With
simple cunning he had left the pin where the outlaw must find it his
own death would be taken for grantedwhat then

What then This ride in the boat Gledware had made his choice he
had clung to his possessionsand now Death held the oars He was
scarcely past middle age He might have lived so long he who so loved
to live But no he had chosen to be richand to die

When Red Feather brought his mind back to the present Gledware was
describing to Annabel a ranch in California for which he had traded the
house near Independence He would take her far away he would build a
house thus and thusroom so terraces here marble pillars

Annabel listened gravely silently her face all the paler for the
sunlight flashing over it for the mimic sun on the waves glancing up
into her pensive eyes Somehow the sunshine the ripple of the water
seemed to form no part of her life belonged rather to Edgerton
Compton rowing in solitude against the sky Those naked trees bare
brown hills and ledges of huge stones seemed her worldboundaries kin
to her claiming her But there was California  and the splendid
house to be built

The Indian was listening now but as he heard projected details
glowingly presented no change came in his grim deeplined face He
simply knew it was not to belet the fool plan He found himself
wondering dully why he no longer hated Gledware with that vindictive
fury that gloats over the deathgrip lingers in fiendish leisure over
the lifted scalp He scarcely remembered the wrong done his daughter
it was almost as if he had banished the cause of his revenge as if
vengeance itself had become a simple stroke of destiny Gledware had
chosen his possession and the Indian was Fates answer

Beautiful one he heard Gledware say speaking in an altered tone
all that is in the futurebut see what I have brought you this is
for today Its yours dearlet me see it around your neck with the
sun full upon it

Red Feather turned his head curiously

Gledware held outstretched a magnificent diamond necklace which shot
forth dazzling rays as it swung from his eager fingers

Annabel uttered a smothered cry of delight as the iridescence filled
her eyes She looked across the water toward the pagodashaped
clubhouse where her mother stood faintly defined as a speck of white
against the green wallshingles of the piazza It seemed that it
needed this glance to steady her nerves Edgerton was forgotten She
reached out her hand And then perplexed at the necklace being
suddenly withdrawn she looked up She caught a glimpse of Gledwares
face and her blood turned cold

That face was frozen in horror At the turning of the boatmans head
he had instantly recognized under the hugebrimmed hat the face of his
enemy as if brought back from the grave

There was a moments tense silence filled with mystery for her with
indescribable agony for him with simple waiting for the Indian
Annabel turned to discover the cause of Gledwares terror but she saw
no malice no threat in the boatmans eyes

Gledware ceased breathing then his form quivered with a sudden inrush
of breath as of a man emerging from diving His eyes rolled in his
head as he turned about scanning the shore glaring at Edgertons
distant boat Why had he come unarmed How could he have put faith in
Red Kimballs assurances He tortured his brain for some gleam of hope

This is all I have he shrieked as if the Indians foot was already
upon his neck This is all I have He flung the necklace into the
water It was a lie about the California ranchits a lie about all
my propertyIve got nothing Annabel I sold the last bit to get you
the necklace but I shouldnt have done that Now its gone I have
nothing

The Indian rose slowly The oars slipped down and floated away in the
flashing stream of the suns rays

Annabel realizing that the Indian despite his impassive countenance
threatened some horrible catastrophe started up with a scream
Edgerton had already turned toward them alarmed at sound of Gledwares
terror He bent to the oars comprehending only that Annabel was in
danger

Edgerton she shrieked blindly Edgerton Edgerton Edgerton

Gledware crouched at her feet crying beseechingly I swear I have
nothingnothing I sold everythinggave it awayleft itnothing in
all the world Im willing to beg to starveI dont want to own
anythingI only want to liveto live My God TO LIVE

Red Feather did not utter a word But with the stealthy lightness and
litheness of a panther he stepped over the seat and moved toward
Gledware

Then Gledware pushed to the last extremity despairing of the
interposition of some miraculous chance was forced back upon himself
With the vision of an inherent coward he saw all chances against him
but with the desperation of a maddened soul he threw himself upon the
defensive

Red Feather had not expected to see him offer resistance This show of
clenched teeth and doubled fists suddenly enraged him and the old lust
of vengeance flamed from his eyes Hat and disguising coat were cast
aside For a moment his form rigid and erect gleamed like a statue
of copper cut in stern relentless lines and the single crimson feather
in his raven locks matched in gold the silver brightness of his
upraised blade

The next moment his form shot forward his arm gripped Gledware about
the neck despite furious resistance and both men fell into the water

The violent shock given to the boat sent Annabel to her knees
Clutching the side she gazed with horrified eyes at the water in her
wake The men had disappeared but in the glowing white path cut
across the lake by the sun appeared a dull red streak that thinned
away to faint purple and dim pink She watched the sinister
discoloration with fascinated eyes What was taking place beneath the
smooth tide Or was it all over Had Red Feather found a rock to
which he could cling while he drowned himself with his victim Or had
their bodies been caught in the tangled branches of a submerged forest
tree It was one of the mysteries of the Ozarks never to be solved

She was still kneeling still staring with frightened eyes still
wondering when Edgerton Compton rowed up beside her

He said he had nothing she stammered as he helped her to rise He
said he had nothing How true it is Edgerton gently lifted her
to his skiff then stepped in beside her He too was watching the
water for the possible emergence of a ghastly face

Annabel began trembling as with the ague Edgerton He said it
was all a lieabout his propertyand so it was Everything is a lie
exceptthis

She clung to him



CHAPTER XXVI

JUST A HABIT

When Bill Atkins with an air of impenetrable mystery invited Wilfred
Compton to a ride that might keep him from his bride several days the
young man guessed that Willock had been found Lahoma divining as
much urged Wilfred to hasten assured him that she enjoyed the
publicity and stirring life of the Mangum hotel and expressed
confidence that should she need a friend Mizzoo would help her through
any difficulty So Wilfred rode away with Bill and Willock was not
mentioned

Bill was evidently in deep trouble and when Wilfred and he had let
themselves down into the stone corridor whose only entrance was a
crevice in the mountaintop he understood the old trappers deep
despondencyBrick Willock was there and Brick declared his intention
of giving himself up He announced his purpose before greetings had
subsided Bill called him an old fool used unpruned language
scolded rather than argued Wilfred on the other hand delayed
events by requesting full particulars of the last few weeks

Hes told me all hes been up to Bill objected theres no call to
travel over that ground again What I brought you here for Wilfred
is to show him how foolish hed be to let himself be taken when hes
free as the wind

I tells my tale declared Brick and them as has heard it once can
take it or leave it He was discursive circumstantial and it was a
long time before he led them in fancy to the door of the boathouse and
showed them Red Feather and Gledware disappearing forever beneath the
surface of the lake

There I waited he said expecting first one head then the other to
come to light but nothing happened Seemed like I couldnt move But
Edgerton he began rowing towards me with Annabel she happy despite
herself and when I see it wouldnt do to tarry no longer I cuts loose
the old deaf boatman and unstops his mouth Well sir he lets out a
yell that would adone credit to a bobcat fighting in the traps I had
to run for it fellows from the clubhouse took after me thinking Id
been murdering somebodyI skinned them Ozark hills and I skinned
myself But Brick he says When you turns loose a bobcat expect
scratches says he

Dont tell about how you hid in the hills waiting for a night train
Bill pleaded

I tells it all Brick was inflexible You are here Im here and
its a safe place We may never be so put again

A safe place Bill snarled Yes it IS a safe place But youve
lost your nerve WAS a time when youd have stood out creation in a
hole like this But youve turned to salt you have a regular Bible
charactergiving up to the law letting them clap you in jail getting
yourself hanged very likely And all because youve lost your nerve
See here Brick stand em out Ill steady you through thick and
thin Ill bring you grub and water

YOU couldnt do nothing Brick returned contemptuously youre too
old As for that I aint come to the pass of needing being waited on
I guess It aint dangers that subdues me its principles Look
here

He walked to the crossbar that was set in the walls to guard the floor
from the unknown abyss I found out they was a hole in the rock just
about five feet under the floor I can take this rope and tie one end
to the post and let myself down to that little room where theres grub
enough to last a long siege where theres bedding and common luxuries
as tobacco and the like I aint been smoked out into the open I
goes free and disposed and my hands held up according

When he had finished the last morsel of his story and had warmed some
of it over for another taste there came an ominous silence broken at
last by the querulous voice of Bill arguing against surrender

Willock waited in patience till his friend had exhausted himself I
aint saying nothing he explained to Wilfred because he aint
pervious to reason and it does him good to get that out of his system

Let me make a suggestion exclaimed Wilfred suddenly

Willock looked at him suspiciously If it aint counter to my plans

It isnt Its this Suppose we drop the subject till tomorrowit
wont hurt any of us to sleep on it and I know ID enjoy another night
with you as in the old days

Im willing to sleep on it out of friendship Willock conceded
unwillingly though Id rest easier on a bed in the jail There never
was no bird more crazy to get into a cage than I am to be shut up But
as to the old days they aint none left Them deputies is in the
dugout theyre in the cabin I built for Lahoma they think they owns
our cove Well theys no place left for me life wouldnt be nothing
crouching and slinking up here in the rocks Life wouldnt be nothing
to me without Lahoma Id have a pretty chance for happiness now
wouldnt I sitting up somewheres with Bill Atkins I aint saying I
mightnt get out of this country and find a safe spot where I could
live free and disposed with an old renegade like HIM that nobody aint
after and aint acaring whether hes above ground or in kingdom come
But I couldnt be with Lahoma Im under ban

If you were on my farm near Oklahoma City Wilfred suggested and
Lahoma and I lived in the city you could often see her Up there
nobodyd molest you nobodyd know you Thats what Ive been
planning You could look after the farm and Bill could go back and
forth As soon as the news comes that Red Feather killed Gledware
itll be taken for granted that he killed Red Kimball and attacked the
stage Youll be cleared of all that and nobody will want you
arrested

Willock rose Are we going to sleep on this or shall I answer you
now he demanded fixedly

Wilfred hastily asked for time

They passed the night in the mountaintop but Willock had spoken
truly there were no old days The one subject forbidden was the only
subject in their minds All attempts at reminiscence at irrelevant
anecdotes were mere pretense The fact that Wilfred and Lahoma were
now married seemed to banish events of a month ago as if they were
years and years in the past

They partook of breakfast in the gray dawn of the new day eating by
lanternlight And when the light had been extinguished Willock like
a wild animal brought to bay squared his shoulders against the wall
and said Weve slept on it Say all you got to say Dont leave
out nothing because you might be sorry afterwards Speak together or
one at a time its all the same to me And when youre done and say
youre done Ill do my talking according

And when they were done and said they were done he straightened
himself and said

When Red Kimballs band give themselves to the law that done nothing
to them there might of been a man one of em that never come in out
of the rain I aint saying I am that man for I stands by the records
and the proofs and the showings of man and man technical and
arbitrary But in due time the governor of Texas he says that that
manwhoever he may bewas no longer to be excused on the grounds that
he done his operating in NoMans Land and his residing in the state of
Texas And he said that there man would be held responsible for all
the deeds done by Red Kimballs band That word has been handed down
Now whether Im that man or just thought to be that man makes little
difference Im a fugitive on the face of the earth without an ark of
safetyreferring to my cove Thats ME

Now look at LAHOMA She has folks not meaning you Wilfred but
Boston kin that stands high A woman aint nothing without family out
in the world Youre going to be a great man some day if I dont miss
my guess a great man in Oklahoma government and laws Lahomas going
to be proud of you Youll take a hand in politics youll be elected
to something high If I lived near at hand Id alltime be hiding
and having her aconniving at something that would hurt your reputation
if found out and that would kill me because I couldnt breathe under
such a load And if away from her wellIm too old now to live
without Lahoma Shesshes just a habit of mine

So you puts me in jail They does what they likes with me hangs me
or gives me time but the point as I see it is this Ill be disposed
of Ill be given a rank you may say and classified Lahoma wont be
hampered Shes young young people takes things hard but they dont
take em long In due time them Boston kinfolks will be inviting her
and will be visiting her and youll be in congress like enoughif
you wasnt a western man Id say you might be president And
everybody will honor you and feast youand as to Brick Willock hell
simply be forgot

Which is eminent and proper Wilfred I belongs to the pastIM a
kind of wild creature such as has to die out when civilization rolls
high and shes rolling high in these parts and its for me and Bill
to join the Indians and buffaloes and fade away Trappers is out of
date so is highwaymen I judge

I dont know as I makes myself clear or well put but if youll catch
up the ponies I guess your sheriff can handle my meaning

Without much difficulty Wilfred effected another compromise They
waited till night before leaving the retreat The reason accepted for
this delay was that in the daytime the deputies would stop them and
Willock wanted to give himself up to the chief in command When it was
dark they slipped down the gully whose matted trees though stripped of
leaves offered additional shelter In the cove they saw the light
streaming from the window of the dugoutthat famous window that had
given Lahoma her first outlook upon learning As the beams caught his
eye a sigh heaved the great bulk of the former master of the cove but
he said nothing

In oppressive silence they skirted Turtle Hill and emerged from the
horseshoe bend finding in a sheltered nook the three ponies that
Wilfred had provided at nightfall He had hoped to the last that
Willock could be prevailed on to alter his decision and even while
riding away toward Mangum he argued and coaxed But it was in vain
and as they clattered up to the hotel veranda Willock was searching
the crowd for a glimpse of the sheriff

The street was unusually full for that time of night some topic of
engrossing interest seemed to engage all minds until Willocks figure
was recognized then indeed he held the center of attention Men
gathered eagerly curiously but without the hostility they would have
displayed had not a message regarding Red Feather reached the town
Brick was still an outlaw to be sure but whatever crimes he had
committed were unknown hence unable to react on the imagination The
surviving friend of Red Kimball giving up his efforts against Willock
on the liberation of Bill had left the country harmless without his
leader

Conversation which had been loud and excited eager calls from street
corners that had punctuated the manytongued argument and exposition
dimmed to silence There was a forward movement of the men not a rush
but a vibratory swell of the human tide pushing toward the steps of
the hotel The two riderless horses danced sidewiseBrick Willock had
jumped upon the unpainted floor of the veranda and Wilfred had sprung
lightly to his side

Ill just keep on my horse muttered Bill resting one leg stiffly
over the pommel I cant get up as I used to and I expect to stay
with ye Brick to the jail door

Willock did not turn his shaggy head to answer He had seen the
sheriff at the other end of the piazza and he made straight for him
not even condescending to a grin when the other mistaking his
intentions whipped out his revolver

Put it up pard Brick said gruffly When you come to me in the
cove a few years ago I give you a warm welcome but now I aint
acoming to you Im acoming to the Law Wheres that there warrant

The crowd that had been listening to the sheriffs discourse before the
arrival of the highwayman scattered at sight of the drawn weaponall
except Lahoma

Brick she cried oh Brick Brick

There was something in her voice he could not understand but he dared
not turn to examine her face he could not trust himself if he once
looked at her

Get out your warrant he cried savagely and get it out quick if you
want ME His great breast heaved with the conflict of powerful
emotions

Im sure sorry to see you old man Mizzoo declared We know Red
Feather done what we was charging up against you But I guess theres
no other course open to me As my aunt used to say Miss Sue of
Missouri I got a dutydo it I must He thrust his hairy hand
into his bosom and drew forth the fateful paper

Lahoma laughed Read it Mizzoo read it aloudread all of it she
cried gleefully

Wilfred looked at her bewildered The crowd stared also knowing her
love for Brick therefore dazed at the sound of mirthful music Brick
turned his head at last he looked also not reproachfully but with a
question in his hard stern eyes

Mizzoo turned red Well yes Ill read it he said defiantly
Sure I guess as sheriff of Greer County Ill make shift to get
through with it alive

He began to read slowly doggedly Brick without movement save for
that heaving of his bosom facing him with a mingling on his face of
supreme defiance for the reader and superstitious awe for the legal
instrument

Thats all Mizzoo at last announced Youll have to come with me
Willock

Hold on came voices from the crowd During the reading they had
been watching Lahoma and her expression promised more than fruitless
laughter Hold on Mizzoo Lahomas got something up her sleeve

Lahoma spoke clearly that her voice might carry to the confines of the
crowd Mizzoo I think you read in that warrant county of Greer
state of Texas Didnt you

Thats what I done Heres the words

But you see returned Lahoma that warrants no good

Mizzoo stared at her a moment then exclaimed violently By
Propriety forbade the completion of his phrase

The crowd instantly caught her meaning a shout rose shrill
tumultuous broken with laughter She had reminded them of the subject
which a short time ago had engaged all minds

Its no good cried Lahoma triumphantly She took it from Mizzoos
lax fingers and deliberately tore it from top to bottom

I guess Im agetting old sure enough said Bill This is beyond
me

Wilfred looked at Lahoma questioningly Brick stupefied by violence
done that sacred instrument of civilization stood rooted to the spot

Mizzoo was grinning now You see he explained word come today
that the Supreme Court has at last turned in its decision Prairie Dog
Fork is now Red River and Red River is only the North Fork of Red
Riverand that means that Greer County dont belong to Texas and
never did belong to her but is a part of Oklahoma

And youll never have an Oklahoma writ served on you cried Lahoma
not while Im living And youll go with us to our farm and live with
us you and Bill and

Lahoma had expected to be very calm and logical for she knew she had
all the advantage on her side But when she saw the change in Bricks
eyes she forgot her rights she forgot all that watching crowd she
forgot even Wilfredand with a spring she was in Bricks arms sobbing
for joy

He tried to say something about her Boston kin but he could not
express the thought coherently for giant as he was he was sobbing
too

If theres ever a meeting she said between tears and laughter the
East will have to come to the West

Those Boston folks cried Bill with a sudden upheaval of unwonted
humor can simply go tobeans Im agetting down he added
cautiously lowering himself from his pony I guess Im in this too

Youre in it growled Brick but youre on the outskirts Dont
come no nearer He stroked the head that rested on his breast his
great hand moving with exceeding gentleness He gazed over her brown
glory at the sympathetic crowd

Fellows he cried just look what Ive raised

Boys exclaimed Mizzoo what do you say Lets give three cheers
for Lahoma

Wilfreds voice cut across the last word proud and happy Make it
Lahoma of Oklahoma
