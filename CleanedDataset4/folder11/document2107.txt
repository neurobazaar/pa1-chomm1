Chapter I  ENGLAND SENDS THE EXCELLENCY HOTHAM TO BERLIN

Things therefore are got to a deadlock at Berlin rebellious
Womankind peremptorily refuse Weissenfels and take to a bed of
sickness inexpugnable there for the moment Baireuth is but a weak
middle term and there are disagreements on it Answer from England
affirmative or even negative we have yet none Promptly affirmative
that might still avail and be an honorable outcome Perhaps better
pause till that arrive and declare itselfFriedrich Wilhelm knows
nothing of the Villa mission of the urgencies that have been used in
England but in present circumstances he can pause for their answer




MAJESTY AND CROWNPRINCE WITH HIM MAKE A RUN TO DRESDEN

To outward appearance Friedrich Wilhelm having written that message to
Baireuth seems easier in mind quiet with the Queen though dangerous
for exploding if Wilhelmina and the Prince come in view Wilhelmina
mostly squats Prince who has to be in view gets slaps and strokes
daily JOURNELLEMENT says the Princessor almost daily For the
rest it is evident enough Weissenfels if not got passed through the
Female Parliament is thrown out on the second reading and so is at
least finished Ought we not to make a run to Dresden therefore
and apprise the Polish Majesty Short run to Dresden is appointed
for February 18th Fassmann p 404 and the PrinceRoyal perhaps
suspected of meditating something and safer in his Fathers company
than elsewhere is to go Wilhelmina had taken leave of him night of
the 17th in her Majestys Apartment and was in the act of undressing
for bed whenjudge of a young Princesss terror and surprise

There stept into the anteroom visible in the halflight there a
most handsome little Cavalier dressed not succinctly as Colonel of the
Potsdam Giants but in magnificent French styleI gave a shriek not
knowing who it was and hid myself behind a screen Madam de Sonsfeld
my Governess not less frightened than myself ran out to see what
audacious person at such undue hour it could be But she returned
next moment accompanying the Cavalier who was laughing heartily and
whom I recognized for my Brother His dress so altered him he seemed a
different person He was in the best humor possible

I am come to bid you farewell once more my dear Sister said he
and as I know the friendship you have for me I will not keep you
ignorant of my designs I go and do not come back I cannot endure
the usage I suffer my patience is driven to an end It is a favorable
opportunity for flinging off that odious yoke I will glide out of
Dresden and get across to England where I do not doubt I shall work
out your deliverance too when I am got thither So I beg you calm
yourself We shall soon meet again in places where joy shall succeed our
tears and where we shall have the happiness to see ourselves in peace
and free from these persecutions Wilhelmina i 205

Wilhelmina stood stupefied in silence for some momentsargued long
with her Brother finally got him to renounce those wild plans or at
least postpone them and give her his word that he would attempt nothing
on the present occasion This small Dresden Excursion of February 1730
passed accordingly without accident It was but the prelude to a much
grander Visit now agreed upon between the neighboring Majesties For
there is a grand thing in the wind Something truly sublime of the
scenicmilitary kind which has not yet got a name but shall soon have
a worldwide oneCamp of Muhlberg Camp of Radewitz or however to
be namedwhich his Polish Majesty will hold in those Saxon parts in a
month or two A thing that will astonish all the world we may hope and
where the King and Prince of Prussia are to attend as chief guests

It was during this brief absence in February or directly after
Friedrich Wilhelm had returned that Queen Sophie had that fit of real
sickness we spoke of Scarcely was his Majesty got home when the Queen
rather ambiguous in her sicknesses of late fell really and dangerously
ill so that Friedrich Wilhelm at last recognizing it for real came
hurrying in from Potsdam wept loud and abundantly poor man declared
in private He would not survive his Feekin and for her sake
solemnly pardoned Wilhelmina and even Fritztill the symptoms mended
Wilhelmina i 306




HOW VILLA WAS RECEIVED IN ENGLAND

Meanwhile Dr Villa in England has sped not ill Villas eloquence of
truth the GrumkowReichenbach Correspondence in St Mary Axe these
two things produce their effect These on the one hand and then on the
other certain questionable aspects of Fleury after that fine Soissons
Catastrophe to the Kaiser and certain interior quarrels in the English
Ministry partly grounded thereonOn the whole why should not we
detach Friedrioh Wilhelm from the Kaiser if we could and comply with a
Royal Sister think they at St Jamess

Political men take some interest in the question Why neglect your
Prince of Wales grumbles the Public It is a solid Protestant match
eligible for Prince Fred and usWhy bother with the Kaiser and his
German puddles asks Walpole Once detach Prussia from him the
Kaiser will perhaps sit still and leave the world and us free of
his Pragmatics and his Sanctions and ApanagesQuit of him German
puddles answers Townshend dubitativelywho has gained favor at
headquarters by going deeply into said puddles and is not so ardent for
the Prussian Match and indeed is gradually getting into quarrel with
Walpole and Queen Caroline Coxe i 332339 These things are all
favorable to Dr Villa

In fact there is one of those political tempests dreadful to the
teapot were it not experienced in them going on in England at this
timewhat we call a Change of Ministrydaily crisis laboring towards
fulfilment or brewing itself ripe Townshend and Walpole have had how
many weeks ago Coxe does not tell us that meeting in Colonel Selwyns
which ended in their clutching at swords nay almost at coatcollars
Ib p 335 honorable Brothersinlaw but the good Sister who used
to reconcile them is now dead Their quarrels growing for some years
past are coming to a head When the firm used to be Townshend and
Walpole all was well when it had to become Walpole and Townshend all
was not well said Walpole afterwards

Things had already gone so far that Townshend brought Chesterfield over
from the Hague last Autumna Baron de Montesquieu with the ESPRIT DE
LOIS in his head sailed with Lord Chesterfield on that occasion and
is now in England for two yearsbut Chesterfield could not be made
Secretary industrious Duke of Newcastle stuck so close by that office
and by the skirts of Walpole Chesterfield and Townshend VERSUS Walpole
Colonel Stanhope Harrington and the Pelhams the Prussian Match is
a card in that game and Dr Villas eloquence of truth is not lost on
Queen Caroline who in a private way manages as always to rule pretty
supreme in it

There lies in the StatePaper Office Close by Despatch Prussian
London 8th February os 17291730 without date or signature a
loose detached bit of writing in scholastic style but brief and to the
purpose which is evidently the Memorial of Villa but as it teaches us
nothing that we do not already know it need not be inserted here
The man we can perceive farther continued useful in those Official
quarters answering questions about Prussia helping in the StMaryAxe
decipherings and in other small ways for some time longer after which
he vanishes again from all recordwhether to teach English farther
or live on some modicum of pension granted no man knows Poor old Dove
let out upon the Deluge in serge gown he did bring back a bit of olive
so to speakhad the presage but held as it did in Noahs case

In a word the English Sovereignties and Ministries have determined
that an Envoy Extraordinary one Hotham they think of with the due
solemnity be sent straightway to Berlin to treat of those interesting
matters and officially put the question there Whom Dubourgay is
instructed to announce to his Prussian Majesty with salutation
from this Court As Dubourgay does straightway with a great deal of
pleasure Despatches London 8th February Berlin 2d March 1780 How
welcome to his Majesty we need not say

And indeed after such an announcement 1st March 1730 the day of
it they fell into cheerful dialogue and the Brigadier had some frank
conversation with his Majesty about the Arbitration Commission then
sitting at Brunswick and European affairs in general Conversation
which is carefully preserved for us in the Brigadiers Despatch of the
morrow It never was intrinsically of much moment and is now fallen
very obsolete and altogether of none but as a glance at firsthand
into the dim old thoughts of Friedrich Wilhelm the reader may take it
with him

The King said next That though we made little noise yet he knew well
our designwas to kindle a fire in other parts of Lower Germany To
which I answered That if his Majesty would give me favorable hearing
I could easily persuade him of the peaceable intentions of our Allies
Well says he the Emperor will abandon the Netherlands and who will
be master of them I see the day when you will make France so powerful
that it will be difficult to bring them to reason againDUBOURGAY
If the Emperor abandoned the Netherlands they would be governed by
their own Magistrate and defended by their own Militia As to the
French we are too well persuaded of the benefit of our Allies to
Upon which the King of Prussia said It appeared plainly we had a mind
to dispose as we pleased of Kingdoms and provinces in Italy so
that probably our next thought would be to do the same in
GermanyDUBOURGAY The allotments made in favor of Don Carlos have
been made with the consent of the Emperor and the whole Empire We could
not suffer a longer interruption of our commerce with Spain for the
sake of the small difference between the Treaty of Seville and the
Quadruple Alliance in regard to the Garrisonto the introducing
of Spanish Garrisons at once into Parma and Piacenza which was the
special thunderbolt of the late Soissons Catastrophe or Treaty of
SevilleWell then says his Prussian Majesty you must allow
then there IS an infraction of the Quadruple Alliance and that the
Emperor will make war I hope not said I but if so a TenYears
War in conjunction with the Allies of Seville never would be so bad as
the interruption of our Commerce with Old and New Spain for one year

The King of Prussias notion about our DISPOSING OF PROVINCES IN
GERMANY adds Dubourgay is I believe an insinuation of Seckendorf
who I doubt not has made him believe we intended to do so with respect
to Berg and Julich

Very probablybut Hotham is getting under way hopeful to spoil that
game Prussian Majesty we see is not insensible to so much honor and
brightens into hopefulness and fine humor in consequence What
radiancy spread over the Queens side of the House we need not say
The TobaccoParliament is like to have a hard taskFriedrich Wilhelm
privately is well inclined to have his Daughter married with such
outlooks if it can be done The marriage of the CrownPrince into
such a family would also be very welcome onlyonlyThere are
considerations on that side There are reasons still more there are
whims feelings of the mind towards an unloved HeirApparent upon these
latter chiefly lie the hopes of Seckendorf and the TobaccoParliament

What the TobaccoParliaments specific insinuations and deliberations
were in this alarming interim no Hansard gives us a hint Faint and
timid they needed at first to be such unfavorable winds having
risen blowing off at a sad rate the smoke of that abstruse
InstitutionJARNIBLEU snuffles the Feldzeugmeister to himself
But SI DEUS EST NOBISCUM as Grumkow exclaims once to his beautiful
Reichenbach or NOSTI as he calls him in their slang or cipher language
If God is with us who can prevail against us For the Grumkow can
quote Scripture nay solaces himself with it which is a feat beyond
what the Devil is competent to




EXCELLENCY HOTHAM ARRIVES IN BERLIN

The Special Envoy to be sent to Berlin on this interesting occasion is
a dignified Yorkshire Baronet Sir Charles Hotham Colonel of the
HorseGrenadiers he has some post at Court too and is still in his
best years His Wife is Chesterfields Sister he is withal a kind
of soldier as we seea man of many sabretashes at least and
acquainted with CavalryDrill as well as the practices of Goldsticks
his Father was a General Officer in the Peterborough Spanish Wars These
are his eligibilities recommending him at Berlin and to Official
men at home Family is old enough Hothams of Scarborough in the East
Riding old as WILHELMUS BASTARDUS and subsists to our own day This
Sir Charles is lineal Son of the Hothams who lost their heads in the
Civil War and he is so to speak lineal UNCLE of the Lords Hotham that
now are For the rest a handsome figure prompt in French and much the
gentleman So far has Villa sped

Hotham got to Berlin on Sunday 2d April 1730 He had lingered a
little waiting to gather up some skirts of that ReichenbachGrumkow
Correspondence and have them ready to show in the proper Quarter For
that is one of the chief arrows in his quiver But here he is at last
and on Monday he is introduced at Charlottenburg to the Prussian
Majesty and finds an abundant welcome to himself and his preliminaries
Marriage into that fine high Country MAGNIFIKE LAND will be welcome
to my Daughter I believe as flowers in May to me also how can it be
other than welcomeFarther instructions you say Yes surely and
terms honorable on both sides Only say nothing of it I had rather
tell the girl myself Ranke i 284 To that frank purport spoke his
Majestyand invites the Excellency Hotham to stay dinner

Great dinner at Charlottenburg accordingly Monday 3d April 1730
the two English Excellencies Hotham and Dubourgay then General Borck
Knyphausen Grumkow Seckendorf and otherswhere says Hotham
giving Despatch about it we all got immoderately drunk Of which
dinner there is sordid narrative from Grumkow to his NOSTI to his
Reichenbach in cant speech still visible through St Mary Axe were
it worth much attention from us Passages of wit loaded with allusion
flew round the table A German ducat is change for an English
halfguinea and the like sprightly things Nay at one time Hothams
back being turned they openly drinkhis Majesty in a state of
exhilaration having blabbed the secretTo the health of Wilhelmina
Princess of Wales Upon which the whole Palace of Charlottenburg
now bursts into tripudiation the very valets cutting capers making
somersetsand rushing off with the news to Berlin Observable only
that Hotham and Dubourgay sat silent in the tripudiation with faces
diplomatically grave Several points to be settled first no hallooing
till we are out of the wood

News came to Berlin Schloss doubtless at full gallop which would
only take a quarter of an hour This is Wilhelminas experience of
it Afternoon of Monday 3d of April 1730 in the Schloss of
Berlintowards sunset some ornamental seam in ones hand

I was sitting quiet in my Apartment busy with work and some one
reading to me when the Queens Ladies rushed in with a torrent of
domestics in the rear who all bawled out putting one knee to the
ground They were come to salute the Princess of Wales I fairly
believed these poor people had lost their wits they would not cease
overwhelming me with noise and tumult their joy was so great they knew
not what they did When the farce had lasted some time they at last
told mewhat our readers know What the demure Wilhelmina professes
she cared next to nothing about I was so little moved by it that I
answered going on with my work Is that all Which greatly surprised
them A while afterwards my Sisters and several Ladies came also to
congratulate me I was much loved and I felt more delighted at the
proofs each gave me of that than at what occasioned them In the evening
I went to the Queens you may readily conceive her joy On my first
entrance she called me her dear Princess of Wales and addressed
Madam de Sonsfeld as Milady This latter took the liberty of hinting
to her that it would be better to keep quiet that the King having
yet given no notice of this business might be provoked at such
demonstration and that the least trifle could still ruin all her hopes
The Countess Finkenstein joining her remonstrances to Sonsfelds the
Queen though with regret promised to moderate herself Wilhelmina
i 215

This is the effulgent flamingpoint of the longagitated English Match
which we have so often caught in a bitterly smoking condition The King
indeed spoke nothing of it to us on his return to Berlin in a day
or two says Wilhelmina which we thought strange But everybody
considered it certain nothing but the details left to settle Hotham
had daily conferences with the King Every post brought letters from
the Prince of Wales of which Wilhelmina saw severalthis for one
specimen general purport of the whole I conjure you my dear Hotham
get these negotiations finished I am madly in love AMOUREUX COMME UN
FOU and my impatience is unequalled Ib i 218 Wilhelmina thought
these sentiments very romantic on the part of Prince Fred who had
never seen me knew me only by reputeand answered his romances and
him with tiffs of laughter in a prettily fleecing manner

Effulgent flamepointwhich was of very brief duration indeed and
which sank soon into bitterer smoke than ever down almost to the
choking state There are now six weeks of Diplomatic History at
the Court of Berlin which end far otherwise than they began Weeks
wellnigh indecipherable so distracted are they by blackart and
abstruse activities above ground and below and so distractedly recorded
for us of which if it be humanly possible we must try to convey some
faint notion to mankind




Chapter II  LANGUAGE OF BIRDS EXCELLENCY HOTHAM PROVES UNAVAILING

Already next morning after that grand Dinner at Charlottenburg
Friedrich Wilhelm awakening with his due headache thought and was
heard saying He had gone too far Those gloomy looks of Hotham and
Dubourgay on the occasion they are a sad memento that our joyance was
premature The English mean the DoubleMarriage and Friedrich
Wilhelm is not ready and never fairly was for more than the Single
Wilhelmina Princess of Wales yes with all my heart but Friedrich to
an English PrincessHm naand in a day more Instruction to his
Ministers 5th April cited by Ranke i 285 n plainly No And
there it finally rests or if rocked about always settles there again

And why NoTruly as regarded CrownPrince Friedrichs marriage the
question had its real difficulties and then still more it had its
imaginary and the subterranean activities were busy The witnesses
contemporaneous and other assign three reasons or considerations and
quasireasons which the TobaccoParliament and Friedrich Wilhelms
lively fancy could insist upon it till they became irrefragable

FIRST his rooted discontent with the CrownPrince some even say his
jealousy of the CrownPrinces talents render it unpleasant to think of
promoting him in any way SECOND natural German loyalty enlivened by
the hope of Julich and Berg attaching Friedrich Wilhelm to the Kaisers
side of things repels him with a kind of horror from the AntiKaiser or
FrenchEnglish side Marry my Daughter if you like I shall be glad to
salute her as Princess of Wales but no union in your TreatyofSeville
operations in politics go you your own road if that is it while I
go mine no tying of us by Double or other Marriages to go one road
THIRD the magnificence of those English Regardless of expense
insinuates the TobaccoParliament they will send their grand Princess
hither with no end of money brought up in grandeur to look down on the
like of us She can dazzle she can purchase in the end may there not
be a CrownPrince Party capable of extinguishing your Majesty here
in your own Court and making Prussia a bit of England all eyes being
turned to such sumptuous Princess and her CrownPrinceHeirApparent
or Rising Sun as we may call him

These really are three weighty almost dreadful considerations to a
poetictempered King and Smoking Parliament Out of which there is no
refuge except indeed this plain fourth one No hurry about Fritzs
marriage Friedrich Wilhelm to Reichenbach 13th May infra he is
but eighteen gone evidently too young for housekeeping Thirty is a
good time for marrying There is thank God no lack of royal lineage
I have two other Princesand another just at hand if I knew it

To all which there is to be added that everrecurring invincible
gravitation towards the Kaiser and also towards Julich and Berg by
means of himwell acted on by the TobaccoParliament for the space of
those six weeks During which accordingly almost from the first day
after that Hotham Dinner of April 3d the answer of the royal mind with
superficial fluctuations always is Wilhelmina at once if you choose
likely enough we might agree about CrownPrince Friedrich too if once
all were settled but of the DoubleMarriage at this present time HORE
NIT Ranke i 285 n I will have nothing to say And as the English
answer steadily Both or nonemeaning indeed to draw Prussia away
from the Kaisers leadingstrings and out of his present enchanted
condition under the two BlackArtists he has about him the Negotiation
sinks again into a mere smoking and extinct or plainly extinguishing
state

The GrumkowNOSTI Cipher Correspondence might be reckoned as another
efficient cause though in fact it was only a big concomitant symptom
much depended on by both parties and much disappointing both In the
way of persuading or perverting Friedrich Wilhelms judgment about
England this deeplaid piece of machinery does not seem to have done
much if anything and Hotham who with the English Court had calculated
on it on their detection of it as the grand means of blowing Grumkow
out of the field produced a far opposite result on trying as we shall
see That was a bit of heavy ordnance which disappointed everybody
Seized by the enemy before it could do any mischief enemy turned it
round on the inventor fired it off on the inventor andit exploded
through the touchhole singeing some peoples whiskers nothing more




A PEEP INTO THE NOSTIGRUMKOW CORRESPONDENCE CAUGHT UP IN ST MARY AXE

Would the reader wish to look into this NostiGrumkow Correspondence at
all I advise him not Good part of it still lies in the PaperOffice
here Prussian Despatches vols xl xli in a fragmentary state so
much of it as they had caught up and tried to make use offar too
much likely to be published by the Prussian Dryasdust in coming
time but a more sordid mass of eavesdroppings kitchenashes and
floorsweepings collected and interchanged by a pair of treacherous
Flunkies big bullying Flunky and little trembling cringing one Grumkow
and Reichenbach was never got together out of a gentlemans household
To no idlest reader armed even with barnacles and holding mouth and
nose can the stirringup of such a dustbin be long tolerable But
the amazing problem was this Editors doomed to spell the Event into
clearness if he could and put dates physiognomy and outline to it by
help of such FlunkySanscritThat NostiGrumkow Correspondence as we
now have it in the PaperOfficeinterpretable only by acres of British
Despatches by incondite dateless helpless Prussian Books printed
Blotches of Human Stupor as Smelfungus calls them how gladly would
one return them all to St Mary Axe there to lie through Eternity It
is like holding dialogue with a rookery asking your way perhaps in
flight for life as was partly my own case by colloquy with successive
or even simultaneous Rookeries Reader have you tried such a thing An
adventure never to be spoken of again when once DONE

Wilhelmina pretends to give quotations Wilhelmina i 233235 from
this subterranean GrumkowReichenbach Correspondence but hers are only
extracts from some description or remembrance hardly one word is close
to the original though here and there some outline or shadow of a real
passage is traceable What fractional elements capable of gaining some
vestige of meaning when laid together in their cosmic order I could
pick from the circumambient immensity not cosmic are here for the
readers behoof Let him skip if like myself he is weary for
the substance of the story is elsewhere given Or perhaps he has the
curiosity to know the speech of birds With abridgment by occasional
change of phrase above all by immense omissionhere in specimen is
something like what the Rookery says to poor Friedrich Wilhelm and us
through St Mary Axe and the Copyists in the Foreign Office Friedrich
Wilhelm reads it Hotham gives him reading of it some weeks hence we
not till generations afterwards I abridge to the utmostwill mark
in single commas what is not Abridgment but exact Translationwith
rigorous attention to dates and my best fidelity to any meaning there
may be


TO NOSTI the socalled Excellenz Reichenbach IN LONDON

Gumkow from Berlin LOQUITUR Reichenbach listening with both his ears
words caught up in St Mary Axe

BERLIN 3d MARCH 1730 The time has now come when Reichenbach must
play his game Let him write that the heads of the Opposition who play
Austria as a card in Parliament are in consternation Walpole having
hinted to them that he was about to make friends with the King of
Prussia that by means of certain ministers at Berlin and by other
subterranean channels AUTRES SOUTERRAINS his Prussian Majesty had
been brought to a disposition of that kind Knyphausen Borck and
others will be much obliged to Reichenbach for so writing That
Reichenbach knows they intend sending a Minister to Berlin but is
certain enough as perhaps they are his Prussian Majesty will not let
himself be lured or caught in the trap but that the very rumor of its
being possible for him to change from Austria would be an infinite
gain to the English Ministrysalvation of them in fact in the
Parliamentary cockpit That they had already given out in the way of
rumor How sure they were of the Court of Berlin whenever it came to the
point That Reichenbach had tried to learn from 73 An Indecipherable
what the real result from Berlin was and did not think it much though
the Walpole people all hanging so perilously upon Prussia for their
existence affected a great gayety and indeed felt what a gain it was
even to have renewed the Negotiation with his Prussian Majesty Here
is a King likely to get himself illuminated at firsthand upon English
affairs by Ministers lying abroad for him and lying at home

And so the King concludes Grumkow will think Reichenbach is a witch
SORVIER to be so well informed about all that and will redouble the
good opinion he has of Reichenbach And so if Reichenbach second my
ideas we will pack Borck and Knyphausen about their business and will
do the King faithful servicehaving some of us our private 500
pounds a year from Austria for doing it The King perceives only too
well that the Queens sickness is but sham MOMERIE judge of the
effect that has I am yours entirely TOUT A VOUS I wait in great
impatience to hear your news upon all this for I inform you accurately
how the land lies here so that it only depends upon yourself to shine
and to pass for a miracle of just insightSORCIER or witch at
guessing mysteries Grumkow calls it again He continues in another
Missive

BERLIN 7th MARCH Let us give the original for a line or two Queen
Sophie will soon rise from her bed of sickness were this marriage done
_La Mere du PrinceRoyal affecte toujours detre bien mal mais des que
laffaire entre le Prince de Galles et la PrincesseRoyale sera faite
on la verra bientot sur pied_ It will behoove that Reichenbach
signify to the PrinceRoyals Father that all this affair has been
concocted at Berlin with Borck and by 71 An Indecipherable with
Knyphausen and 103 An Indecipherable That they never lose sight of
an alliance with the English Princess and the Prince of Prussia and
flatter themselves the PrinceRoyal of Prussia will accompany the
PrincessRoyal Wilhelmina on HER marriage there In a word that
all turns on this latter point marriage of the PRINCERoyal as well
and that Villa has given so favorable a description of this Prince
that the English Princess will have him at what price soever Nosti can
also allege the affair of 100whom we at last decipher to be LORD
HARRINGTON once Colonel Stanhope of Soissons of the Madrid Embassy
of the descent on Vigo a distinguished new Lord with whom Newcastle
hopes to shove out TownshendLord Harrington and the division
among the Ministersgreat question Shall the firm be Townshend
and Walpole or Walpole and Townshend just going on brewing towards
decision in which the Prussian DoubleMarriage is really a kind of
card and may by Nosti be represented as a trump card

The whole Town of Berlin said This Villa was dismissed by order of the
King for he taught the eldest Princess English but I see well it
was Borck 107 An Indecipherable Knyphausen and Dubourgay that
despatched him to give a true picture of the situation here And if
Nosti has written to his Majesty to the same effect as he does to his
Friend Despatch to Majesty has not yet come under Friends eye on
the Queen of Englands views about the PrinceRoyal of Prussia it will
answer marvellously CELA VIENT A MERVEILLE I have apprised Seckendorf
of all that Nosti writes to me For the rest Nosti may perfectly
assure himself that the King never will abandon Reichenbach and if the
PrinceRoyal sudden Fate interfering had the reins in his handin
that case Seckendorf promises to Reichenbach on the part of the
Kaiser all or more than all he can lose by the accession of the Prince
Monsieur Reichenbach may depend upon that Prussian Despatches vol

who transmits it to Hothams Secretary at Berlin with great hopes from
it Letter unsigned adds Villa POINT SIGNEE First was transmitted

firm and not let his enemies deceive him If Grumkow and Seckendorf
have opportunity they may tell his Prussian Majesty that the whole
design of this Court is to render his Country a Province dependent on
England When once the PrincessRoyal of England shall be wedded to the
PrinceRoyal of Prussia the English by that means will form such a
party at Berlin that they will altogether tie his Prussian Majestys

TO HIS PRUSSIAN MAJESTY from Excellenz Reichenbach

 PS I had closed this Letter when a person of confidence came
in the fact being my Grumkows Missive of instructions came in or
figuratively speaking my Grumkow himself and undertook to give me
in a few days a thorough insight into the intrigues which are concealed
under the sending of this new Minister Hotham to Berlin which and
how they have been concocted he says it will astonish me to hear Of
all this I shall immediately inform your Majesty in a letter of my own
hand being ever eager to serve your Majesty alone

Hotham is now fairly gone weeks ago concluded to be now in Berlinto
the horror of both rooks Here is a croak from NOSTI


TO THE HERR GRUMKOW AT BERLIN

LONDON APRIL 1730  Hotham is no such conjurer as they fancy in
Berlinsingular enough how these English are given to undervalue
the Germans whilst we in Germany overvalue them _avons une idee
trop vaste_ they _trap petite_ There is for instance Lord
Chesterfield passes here for a fairenough kind of man BON HOMME
and is a favorite with the King not with Walpole or the Queen if
Nosti knew it but nobody thinks him such a prodigy as you all do in
Germanywhich latter bit of Germanism is an undoubted fact curious
enough to the English and to the Germans that now read in extinct
Books

Hotham as we said got to Berlin on the 2d of April From Berlin comes
thereupon at great length sordid description by Grumkow of that
initiatory Hotham Dinner April Third with fearful details of the
blazing favor Hotham is in Which his Majesty when Hotham hands it to
him in due time will read with painful interest as Reichenbach now
doesbut which to us is all mere puddle omissible in this place

To which sad Strophe there straightway follows due Antistrophe
Reichenbach croaking responsiveand we are to note the rooks always
speak in the third person and by ambiguous periphrasis never once say
I or You unless forced by this Editor for brevitys sake to do
it Reichenbach from his perch thus hoarsely chants

TO THE HERR GRUMKOW AT BERLIN

LONDON 11th APRIL Reichenbach EST COUPDEFOUDREis struck by

to write much today It requires another head than mine to veer round so
often _changer si souvent de systame_ In fine _Nosti est au bout de
son latin_ is at his wits end poor devil Both Majesties have spoken
openly of the favorable news from Berlin funds rose in consequence
New Minister Walpole come to the top of the Firm Townshend soon to
withdraw impatient of the bottom is allpowerful now O TEMPORA O
MORES I receive universal congratulations and have to smile in a
ghastly manner The King and Queen despise me I put myself in their
way last Levee bowing to the ground but they did not even condescend
to look _Notre grand petitmaitre_ little George the Olympian Jove
of these parts passed on as if I had not been there Chesterfield
they say is to go in great pomp as Ambassador Extraordinary and

but now Im MEEserable

LONDON 14th APRIL Slave Reichenbaoh cannot any longer write secret
Letters to his Prussian Majesty according to the old strain of your
prescribing but must stand by his vacant Official Despatches the scene
being entirely changed he also must change his manner of writingpoor
knave He will have to inform his Majesty however by and by though
it is not safe at presentfor exampleThat his Britannic Majesty
is becoming from day to day more hated by all the world and that the
Prince of Wales is no longer liked by the Public as at first because
he begins to give himself airs and takes altogether the manners of
his Britannic Majesty that is to say of a puppy PETITMAITRE let my
Amiable Grumkow be aware of that

Yes let him be aware of that to his comfortand still more and all
readers along with him of what follows

Reichenbach likewise with great confidence informs the Greatest
Confidant he has in the world same amiable Glumkow that he has
discovered within this day or two a tremendous fact known to our
readers some time ago That the PrinceRoyal of Prussia has given his
written assurances to the Queen here Never to many anybody in the
world except the Princess Amelia of England happen what will Prussian
Majesty will read this with a terrible interest Much nearer to him than
it is to us In consideration of which Promise the Queen of England
is understood falsely to have answered that they should at present
ask only the PrincessRoyal of Prussia for their Prince of Wales and
let the DoubleMarriage BE seemingly as his Prussian Majesty wishes
it Monsieur de Reichenbaoh did not speak of this to his Prussian
Majesty feeling it too dangerous just now

Lord Townshend is still at his place in the country Rainham in
Norfolk but it is said he will soon come to Town having heard the
great news that they had already got his Prussian Majesty by the nose
Reichenbach forgets if he already told Grumkow that the rumor runs
Lord Chesterfield in quality of Ambassador to Berlin is to bring
the Princess Wilhelmina over hitheryou did already poor confused
wretch unusually bewildered and under frightful eclipse at present

Continues after four days

APRIL 18th  Lord Stratford to me an unknown Lordship and heads
of Opposition would like to ascertain what Hothams offer to the King of
Prussia IS

Truly yes they mean to ask in Parliament as poor gamblers in that
Cockpit are wont And why did not you make the offer sooner then
Friendship with his Prussian Majesty last year would have saved the
whole of that large Waterspout about the Meadows of Clamei Nay need
we a few months ago have spent such loads of gold subsidizing those
Hessians and Danes against him The treasures of this Country go
a strange road Mr Speaker What is the use of our industries and
riches Heavens yes what But we continue to excerpt and interpret

Reichenbach has said nothing of this to his Prussian Majesty
Reichenbach has not too dangerous in own present downpressed
statethough amazingly exact always in news and attached to his
Prussian Majesty as mortal seldom was Need he fear their new Hotham
then Does not fear Hotham not he him being a man so careful of truth
in his news Dare not however now send any intelligence about the
Royal Family here Prussian Majesty having ordered him not to write
gossip like a spiteful woman What is he to do Instruct him O my
Amiable

Know for the rest and be aware of it O Amiable that Queen Caroline
here is of opinion The Amiable Grumkow should be conciliated and that
Queen Sophie and Hotham are understood to have been trying it Do not
abandon me O Amiable nay I know you will not you and Seckendorf
never though I am a poor man

Have found out a curious story HISTOIRE FORT CRIEUSEabout one of
Prince Freds amourettes Story which this Editor in the name of the
whole human species will totally suppress and sweep into the cesspool
to herald Reichenbach thither Except only that this corollary by the
Duchess of Kendal may be appended to the thing

Duchess of Kendal Hoppole EMERITA now gone to devotion whom we
know piously turns up her eyes at such doings thinks the Princess
Wilhelmina will have a bad life of it with Fred and that she will need
the wisdom of Solomon to get on here Not a good bargain this Prince
Fred and his Sister A dissolute fellow he not liked by the Public I
should hope Then as to Princess Amelia she who was always haughty
begins to give herself airs upon the PrinceRoyal of Prussia she is
as illtempered as her Father and still more given to backbiting PLUS
RAILLEUSE and will greatly displease the Potsdam Majesty

These are cheering thoughts But what is to become of Nosti Faithful
to his Grumkow to his Seckendorfto his pair of sheepstealers poor
dog But if trouble riseoh at least do not hang me ye incomparable
pair




THE HOTHAM DESPATCHES

Slave Nostis terrors could he see behind the scenes are without
foundation the tremendous Hotham Negotiation all ablaze at that
Charlottenburg Dinner is sunk low enough into the smoking state
threatening to go out altogether Smoke there may still be perceptible
vestiges of smoke which indeed for a long time fitfully continued
but at the time while Nosti quaking in every joint of him writes
these terrors Hotham perceives that his errand is vain that
properly there has as good as extinction supervened April 3d was the
flamepoint which lasted in its brightness only for a few days or
hours April is not gone or half gone when flaming has quite ceased
and the use of bellows never so judicious is becoming desperate and
long before the end of May no red is to be seen in the affair at all
and the very bellows are laid down

Hereare the epochs riddled out of such a mass of extinct rubbish as
human nature seldom had to deal withhere are certain extracts in a
greatly condensed state from the authentic voluminous Hotham Despatches
and Responseswhich may conveniently interrupt the Nosti Babblement at
this point


TO MY LORD TOWNSHEND AT LONDON

Excellency Hotham LOQUITUR in a greatly condensed form

BERLIN 12th APRIL 1730  Of one or two noteworthy points I have to
apprise your Lordship So soon as his Majesty was sober he found that
he had gone too far at that grand dinner of Monday 3d and was in very
bad humor in consequence CrownPrince has written from Potsdam to his
Sister No doubt I am left here lest the English wind get at me _de
peur que le vent anglais ne me touchat_ Saw King at Parade who was a
little vague is giving matters his consideration Majesty has said to
Borck and Knyphausen If they want the DoubleMarriage and to detach
me from the Kaiser let them propose something about Julich and Berg
Sits the wind in that quarter King has said since to one Marschall
a PrivateSecretary who is in our interest I hate my Son and my
Son hates me we are best asunderlet them make him STATTHALTER
Viceregent of Hanover with his Princess Commission might be
made out in the Princess Amelias name proper conditions tied and so
onKnyphausen suggests it could be done Knyphausen is true to us but
he stands alone not alone but cannot much help does not even stir in
the NOSTI or STMARYAXE Affair as yet

Prince Friedrich to be STATTHALTER in Hanover with his English Princess
That would save the expense of an Establishment for him at home That
has been suggested by the Knyphausen or English party and no doubt
it looked flattering to his Prussian Majesty for moments This may be
called Epoch first after that grand Charlottenburg Dinner

Then as to the NOSTI Affair in which Knyphausen does not stir as
yetthe fact is it was only put into Knyphausens hands the day
before YESTERDAY as we soon discover and Knyphausen is not so sure
about it as some are That Hotham Despatch is of Wednesday 12th April
And not till yesterday could Guy Dickens report performance of the
other important thing Captain Guy Dickens a brisk handy military man
Secretary to Dubourgay this good while past Has duly received from
Headquarters the successive NOSTIGRUMKOW documents caught up in St
Mary Axe has now delivered them to Knyphausen to be laid before his
Prussian Majesty in a good hour and would fain Tuesday April 11th
hope some result from this step Not for almost a month does Hotham
himself say anything of it to the Prussian Majesty good hour for
Knyphausen not having come But now in regard to that Hanover
Statthaltership hear Townshendcondensed but not nearly so much
so my Lord being a succinct man who sticks always creditably to the
point


TO THE EXCELLENCY HOTHAM AT BERLIN from Lord Townshend

LONDON 27th APRIL Yes you shall have the Hanover Viceregency We
will set up the CrownPrince Friedrich in Hanover as desired but will
give the Commission to our own Princess that being more convenient for
several reasons CrownPrince furthermore must promise to come over to
England when we require him ITEM may repay us our expenses hereafter
As to MarriagePortions we will give none with our Princess nor ask
any with theirs Both marriages or none Ann so enough

Alas nothing came of this Prussian Majesty in spite of thrift
perceiving that for several reasons it would not do Meanwhile
Grumkow we learn from a secret source NOSTI supra 18th April p
185 infra p 101 has been considerably courted by Botham and her
Prussian Majesty Queen Caroline having signified from England That
they ought to gain that knavewhat price did he charge for himself
But this also proves quite unavailing never came to PRICING And
sohear Hotham once more


TO LORD TOWNSHEND AT LONDON from Excellency Hotham

BERLIN 18th APRIL  Grumkow is a thorn in my side one would like
to do him some service in return Cannot you stop an ORIGINAL Letter
of his we have only deciphered Copies as yet to that Reichenbach
or NOSTI strong enough to break his backThey will try Hotham
continues in next Despatch

BERLIN 22d APRIL Dined with the King again CrownPrince was present
dreadfully dejectedat which one cannot help being moved there is
something so engaging in the Prince and everybody says so much good of
him Hear Hotham Who again three days after says of our Fritz
If I am not much mistaken this young Prince will one day make a very
considerable figure Wish we could manage the Marriage but this
Grumkow thisCannot they contrive to send an ORIGINAL strong enough

Alas from the same secret source we learn within a week that
Grumkows back is very strong the TobaccoParliament in full blast
again and Seckendorfs Couriers galloping to Vienna with the best news
Nay his Majesty looks expressly sour upon Hotham or does not look at
all will not even speak when he sees himfor a reason we shall
hear NOSTI infra 29th April p 191 can it be thought that any
liberality in use of the bellows or other fireimplements will now avail
with his Majesty


SECOND AND LAST PEEP INTO THE NOSTIGRUMKOW CORRESPONDENCE CAUGHT UP IN
ST MARY AXE

But at this point let our Two Rooks recommence a little Nosti on the
18th we left quaking in every joint of himand good news was almost
at the door had afflicted Nosti known it Grumkows strain suppressed
by us here all this while is in general almost ever since the blaze
of that Hotham Dinner went off into repentant headache Pshaw dont
fear Nay after a fortnight or so it is again Steady we are
all right TobaccoParliament and the Royal Imagination making such
progress This is still but the third week since that grand Dinner at
Charlottenburg


TO THE EXCELLENZ REICHENBACH AT LONDON from Grumkow

BERLIN 22d APRIL King wants to get rid of the Princess Wilhelmina
who is grown lean ugly with pimples on her face _qui est devenue
maigre laide couperosee_ This is one of the sentences Wilhelmina
has got hold of Wilhelmina i 234dog will nobody horsewhip that
lie out of himjudge what a treat that will be to a Prince of Wales
who has his amourettes All is right Nosti is it not

BERLIN 25th APRIL King declared to Seckendorf yesterday again He
might write to the Kaiser That while he lived nothing should ever
part his Majesty from the Kaiser and his Cause that the French dare
not attack Luxembourg as is threatened and if they do Upon which
Seckendorf despatched a Courier to Vienna

As to Hotham he explains himself upon nothingstalks about with his
nose in the air as if there were nothing farther to be explained I
spoke yesterday of the Single Match Wilhelmina and Prince of Wales
King answered even of the Single Match Devil fly away with itor a
still coarser phrase

Meanwhile the Queen though at the end of her eighth month is cheery
as a fish in water Wilhelmina has this too in a disfigured state i
233 and always forms grand project of totally ruining Seckendorf by
Knyphausens and other help Hotham yesterday glancing at Nosti no
doubt said to the SIEUR DE POTSDAM cant phrase for the King That
great Princes were very unlucky to have ministers that durst not show
themselves in good society for the result was they sent nothing but
false news and rumors picked up in coffeehouses

Coffeehouses answers Reichenbach by and by Reichenbach is in
English society of the first distinction and receives visits from Lords
and Dukes This all the world knowsto be nothing like the case as
Townshend too has occasionally mentioned

At any rate continues Grumkow the Queens Husband said aside to
Nostis Friend I see he is glancing at Reichenbach but he wont
make much of that cynically speaking _ne fera que de leau claire_
Hotham is by no means a man of brilliant mind and his manners are
rough but Ginkel the Dutchman is cleverer PLUS SOUPLE and much
better liked by Nostis Master

ANTISTROPHE soon follows London Raven is himself againNosti
LOQUITUR

LONDON 25th APRIL  King has written to me I AM to report to him
any talk there may be in the Court here about his Majesty My Amiable
and his Seckendorf need they ask if Nosti will and in a way to give
them pleasure

STROPHE allegro by the Berlin Raven or Rook who has not yet heard the
aboveGrumkow LOQUITUR

BERLIN 29th APRIL  Wrong not to write entertaining news of the
English Court as heretofore King likes it

What you say of the PrinceRoyal of Prussias writing to the Queen of
England is very curious and you did well to say nothing of it to the
Father the thing being of extreme delicacy and the proof difficult
But it seems likely And I insinuated something of it to his Majesty
the day before yesterday 27th April 1730 therefore One momentary
glance of Hansard into the TobaccoParliament as of a thing I had
learned from a spy such my pretence O Nostispy who is the
intimate friend of Knyphausen and plays traitor you may fancy that it
struck terribly Yes And his Majesty has looked sour upon Hotham ever
since and passed above an hour in colloquy with Seckendorf and me in
sight both of English Hotham and Dutch Ginkel without speaking to them

It was true enough what Nosti heard of the Queens fair speeches and
Hothams to the Friend of Nosti But it is all ended the Queens
weeks ago being in vain Hotham too after some civilities seems now
indifferent ENFIN Afin he always writes it copying the indistinct
gurgle of his own horsedialectAFIN FILOUTERIE TOUT PURE whole of
it thimblerig on their part

Admirable story that of Prince Freds amourette sent to the cesspool
by us herald of Reichenbach thither let his Majesty know it by
all means What the Duchess of Kendal lean tall female in expensive
brocades with gilt prayerbooks visible in the body to Nosti at that
time what the Duchess of Kendal says to you is perfectly just and as
the Princess Wilhelmina is very illlooking LAIDEhow dare you say
so dog I believe she will have a bad life of it the Prince of Wales
being accustomed to daintier meats Yes truly she will as the Duchess
says need to be wiser than Solomon to conciliate the humors down
there LA BAS with the genius of his Prussian Majesty and QueenAs
for your Princess Amelia depend upon it while the Commandant of
Potsdam lives she will never get hold of the PrinceRoyal though he is
so furiously taken with the Britannic Majesties

Continues in answer to a Nosti Caw Caw which we omit

BERLIN 2d MAYWish you had not told the King so positively that
the English say it shall be Double Match or none Hotham said to
the Swedish Ambassador Reichenbach walking in the dark would give
himself a fine knock on the nose _aurait un furieux pied de nez_
when or IF the thing was done quite otherwise Have a caution what
you write

Pooh pooh Hotham must have said if not when Swede is quite
astrayAnd indeed we will here leave off and shut down this magazine
of rubbish right glad to wash ourselves wholly from it in three
waters forevermore Possibly enough the Prussian Dryasdust will
one day print it IN EXTENSO and with that lucidity of comment and
arrangement which is peculiar to him exasperated readers will then see
whether I have used them ILL or not according to the opportunity there
wasHere at any rate my reader shall he free of it Indeed he may
perceive the negotiation was by this time come to a safe point the
NostiGrumkows triumphant and the interest of the matter mainly out
Farther transient anxieties this amiable couple hadtraceable in that
last short croak from Grumkowlest the English might consent to that
of the SingleMarriage in the mean time which the English never did
or meant to do For example this other screech of Nosti which shall
be his final lastscreech

LONDON 12th MAYLord Townshend alarmingly hinted to me Better have
done with your GrumkowandSeckendorf speculations the illintentioned
are perfectly sure to be found out at the end of the account and their
tools will get ruined along with them Nosti endeavored to talk big in
reply but he shakes in his shoes nevertheless and with a heart full of
distraction exclaims now Save yourselves save meIf Hotham speak of
the SingleMarriage only it is certain the PrinceRoyal must mean to
run away and so make it a Double one in time

Yes indeed But these were transient terrors The day is our own my
Grumkow yes our own my Nostiand so our Colloquy of Rookeries shall
be suppressible henceforth




HIS MAJESTY GETS SIGHT OF THE STMARYAXE DOCUMENTS BUT NOTHING
FOLLOWS FROM IT

We have only to add what Hotham reports Berlin May 6th That he
has had an interview with his Majesty and spoken of the StMaryAxe
affair Knyphausen having found a moment to lay it before his Majesty
So that the above Excerpts from St Mary Axe all but the last
twothe above and many more suppressed by usare in his Majestys
hands and he is busy studying them will it is likely produce them in
an amazed TobaccoParliament one of these evenings

What the emotions of the royal breast were during the perusal of this
extraordinary dialogue of birds which has come to him through St Mary
Axe Manifold probably manifold questionable but not tragical or
not immediately so Certainly it is definable as the paltriest babble
no treason visible in it nor constructive treason but it painfully
indicates were his Majesty candid That his Majesty is subject to spies
in his own House nay that certain parties do seem to fancy they have
got his Majesty by the nose and are piping tunes with an eye to his
dancing thereto This is a painful thought which I believe does much
agitate his Majesty now and afterwardsA painful thought or suspicion
rising sometimes in that temperament of his to the pitch of the
horrible I believe it occasionally ever henceforth keeps haunting the
highly poetic temperament of his Majesty nor ever quits him again at
all stalking always now and then through the vacant chambers of his
mind in what we may call the nightseason or time of solitude and
hypochondriacal reflectionthough in busy times again in daylight
so to speak he impatiently casts it from him Poor Majesty

But figure Grumkow figure the TobaccoParliament when Majesty laid
these Papers on the Table A HANSARD of that night would be worth
reading There is thunderous note of interrogation on his Majestys
facewhat a glimmer in the hard puckery eyes of Feldzeugmeister
Seckendorf JARNIBLEU No doubt an excessively astonished
Parliament Nothing but brass of face will now serve the principal
Honorable Gentleman there but in that happily he is not wanting

Of course Grumkow denies the Letters pointblank Mere forgeries these
of the English Court plotting to ruin your Majestys faithful servant
and bring in other servants they will like better May have written
to Reichenbach nay indeed has this or that trifling thing but those
Copyists in St Mary Axe decipheringgarbling manufacturing till
they make a romance of italas your Majesty Nay at any rate
what are the Letters Grumkow can plead that they are the foolishest
insignificant rubbish of Courtgossip not tending any bad road if they
have a tendency That they are adapted to the nature of the beast and
of the situationthis he will carefully abstain from remarking

We have no HANSARD of this Session all is conjecture and tobaccosmoke
What we know is not the least effect except an internal trouble was
produced on the royal mind by the StMaryAxe Discovery Some Question
there might well be inarticulately as yet of Grumkows fidelity at
least of his discretion seeds of suspicion as to Grumkow which may
sprout up by and by resolution to keep ones eye on Grumkow But the
first practical fruit of the matter is fierce jealousy that the
English and their clique do really wish to interfere in our ministerial
appointments so that for the present Grumkow is firmer in his place
than ever And privately we need not doubt the matter continues
painful to his Majesty

One thing is certain precisely a week after his Majestymuch
fluctuating in mind evidently for the Document has been changed three
or four times within fortyeight hourspresents his final answer
to Hotham Which runs to this effect outrageous as Hotham defines
it

1 For Hanover and your great liberality on that score much obliged
but upon reconsideration think it will not do 2 Marriage FIRST Prince
of Wales to WilhelminaConsent with pleasure 3 Marriage SECOND
CrownPrince Friedrich with your Ameliafor that also we are extremely
wishful and trust it will one day take effect but first these
SevilleTreaty matters and differences between the Kaiser and allied
English and French will require to be pulled straight that done we
will treat about the terms of Marriage SECOND One indispensable will
beThat the English guarantee our Succession in Julich and Berg
Hothams Despatch 18th May 1730

Outrageous indeedCrownPrince sends along with this a loving
message by Hotham of earnestly deprecating tenor to the Britannic
Majesty begs his Britannic Majesty not to reject the Kings Proposals
whatever they may bethis for poor Sister Wilhelminas sake For
though he the CrownPrince was determined to lose his life sooner
than marry anybody but the Princess Amelia yet if this Negotiation were
broken off his Father would go to extremities to force him and his poor
Sister into other engagementsWhich alas what can it avail with
the Britannic Majesty in regard to such outrageous Propositions from
the Prussian

Britannic Majestys Ministry as always answers by return of
CourierMAY 22d Both Marriages or none Seville has no concern with
both more than with one DITTO Julich and Bergof which latter
indeed we know nothingnor ASIDE TO HOTHAM mean to know Despatch
Whitehall 11th May 22d by NS Whereby Hotham perceives that it
is as good to throw away the bellows and consider the matter extinct
Hotham makes ready for an Excursion into Saxony to a thing called
CAMP OF RADEWITZ or ENCAMPMENT OF RADEWITZ a Military Spectacle of
neverimagined magnificence to be given by August the Strong there
whither all the world is crowdingand considers any Business he had at
Berlin to be as good as done

Evidently Friedrich Wilhelm has not been much wrought upon by the
StMaryAxe Documents One week they have been revolving in the royal
mind part of a week in the Smoking Parliament we know not what
day they were laid on the table there but it must have been a grand
occurrence within those wallsand this already May 13th is the
result arrived at Propositions changed three or four times within
fortyeight hours and definable at last as outrageous which
induce Hotham to lay down the bellows and prepare to go his ways Our
StMaryAxe discovery seems to have no effect at all

One other public result there is from it and as yet one only
Reichenbach from certain causes thereto moving Us _aus gewissen Uns
dazu bewegenden Grunden_ gets a formal Letter of Recall Ostensible
Letter dated Berlin 13th May and signed Friedrich Wilhelm which the
English may read for their comfort Only that along with this of the
same date and signature intended for Reichenbachs comfort the same
Leather Bag brings a Private Letter which Dickens or another has
contrived to get sight of and copy apprising Reichenbach That
unostensibly his proceedings are approved of that he is to continue
at his post till further orders all the same and keep watch on these
Marriages about which there is such debating in the world _wovon in
der Welt so viel debattirt wird_ things being still in the same
state as half a year ago That is to say I am ready for my Daughters
Marriage with the Prince of Wales but for my Son he is too young yet
_und hat es damit keine Eile weil ich Gottlob noch zwei Sohne hab_
nor is there any haste as I have thank God two other sonsand a
third coming if I knew itbesides one indispensable condition will
be that the English guarantee Julich and Berg which perhaps they are
not in the least hurry for either

What does the English Court think of that Dated Berlin 13th May it
is the same day when his Majestys matured Proposals changed thrice
or oftener within the fortyeight hours were handed to Hotham for
transmission to his Court An interesting Leather Bag this Ordinary
from Berlin Reichenbach we observe will get his share of it some ten
days after that alarming rebuke from Townshend and it will relieve the
poor wretch from his worst terrors Go on with your eavesdroppings as
before you alarmed wretchThere does one Degenfeld by and by a
man of better quality and on special haste as we shall see come and
supersede poor Nosti and send him homethere they give Nosti some
exiguous Pension with hint to disappear forevermore Which he does
leaving only these StMaryAxe Documents for his Lifemark in the
History of Mankind

What the English Answer to his Majestys Proposals of Berlin May 13th
was we have already seendated London 22d May probably few hours
after the Courier arrived Hotham well anticipating what it would
be had already as we phrased it laid down the bellows left the
Negotiation as essentially extinctand was preparing for the Camp
at Radewitz Britannic Majesty being anxious to hear what Friedrioh
Wilhelm and August the Strong have on hand there

The King of Prussias unsteadiness and want of resolution writes
Hotham Berlin 20th May will hinder him from being either very
useful to his friends or very formidable to his enemies And from
the same place just about quitting it for Radewitz he writes again
exactly a week after Berlin 27th May to enclose Copy of a
remarkable Letter remarkable to us alsobut which he knows and
we cannot influence the English Answer now close at hand Here is
the copied Letter copied in Guy Dickenss hand from which we
translateand also will give the original French in this instance for
behoof of the curious


TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE CHEVALIER HOTHAM

POTSDAM End of May 1730

MONSIEURJe crois que cest de la derniere importance que je vous
ecrive et je suis assez triste davoir des chases a vous dire que je
devrois cacher a toute la terre mais il faut franchir ce mauvais pas
la et vous comptant de mes amis je me resouds plus facilement a vous
le dire Cest que je suis traite dune maniere inouie du Roi et que
je sais qua present ils se trament de terribles choses contre moi
touchant certaines Lettres que jai ecrites lhiver passe dont je crois
que vous serez informe Enfin pour vous parler franchement la vraie
raison que le Roi a de ne vouloir point donner les mains a ce Mariage
est quil me veut toujours tenir sur un bas pied et me faire enrager
toute sa vie quand lenvie lui en prend ainsi il ne laccordera
jamais Si lon consent de votre cote que cette Princesse soit aussi
traitee ainsi vous pouvez comprendre aisement que je serai fort triste
de rendre malheureuse une personne que jestime et de rester toujours
dans le meme etat ou je suis Pour moi done je crois quil vaudroit
mieux finir le Mariage de ma Soeur ainsi auparavant et ne point
demander au Roi seulement des assurances sur mon sujet dautant plus
que sa parole ny fait rien suffit que je reitere les promesses que
jai deja fait au Roi mon Oncle de ne prendre jamais dautre epouse que
sa seconde fille la Princess Amelie Je suis une personne de parole qui
pourra faire reussir ce que javance pourvu que lon se fie a moi Je
vous le promets et a present vous pouvez en avertir votre Cour et je
saurai tenir ma promesse Je suis toujours tout a vous

FREDERIC

StatePaper Office Prussian Despatches vol xli enclosed in Sir
Charles Hothams Despatch Berlin 27th16th May 1730

MonsieurI believe it is of the last importance that I should write
to you and I am very sad to have things to say which I ought to conceal
from all the earth But one must take that bad leap and reckoning you
among my friends I the more easily resolve to open myself to you

The case is this I am treated in an unheardof manner by the King
and I know there are terrible things in preparation against me touching
certain letters which I wrote last winter of which I believe you are
informed In a word to speak frankly to you the real secret reason why
the King will not consent to this Marriage is That he wishes to keep
me on a low footing constantly and to have the power of driving me mad
whenever the whim takes him throughout his life thus he never will
give his consent If it were possible that you on your side could
consent that your Princess too should be exposed to such treatment
you may well comprehend that I should be very sad to bring misery on a
Person whom I esteem and to remain always in the same state as now

For my own part therefore I believe it would be better to conclude my
Sisters Marriage in the first place and not even to ask from the King
any assurances in regard to mine the rather as his word has nothing to
do with it it is enough that I here reiterate the promises which I have
already made to the King my Uncle Never to take another wife than his
second Daughter the Princess Amelia I am a person of my word and shall
be able to bring about what I set forth provided there is trust put in
me I promise it you and now you may give your Court notice of it and
I shall manage to keep my promise I remain yours always

The CrownPrince for Wilhelminas sake and everybodys is extremely
anxious they should agree to the Single Marriage in the interim but
the English Courtperhaps for no deep reason perhaps chiefly because
little George had the whim of standing grandly immovable upon his first
offernever would hear of that Which was an angry thought to the
CrownPrince in after times as we sometimes notice

Here to the like effect is another Fragment from his Royal Highness
copied in the Dickens hand and enclosed in the same Despatch from
Hothamgiving us a glance into the inner workshop of his Royal
Highness and his hidden assiduities and endeavorings at that time

 Vous pouvez croire que je ferai tout ce que je peux pour faire
reussir mon plan mais lon nen remarquera rien em dehorsque lon
men laisse agir en suite je ferai bien moi seul reussir le reste Je
finis la par vous assurer encore Monsieur que je suis tout a vous


FREDERIC PRINCE R

 You may believe I will exert all my resources to succeed in my
plan but there will be no outward sign visibleleave me to act in
this way I will myself successfully bring it through I end by again
assuring you Monsieur that I am yours alwaysWhich again produces
no effect the English Answer being steadily Both Marriages or none

And this then is what the Hotham mission is come to Good Dubourgay
is home recalled about a month ago for the sake of his health
Townshends polite Despatch to him Whitehall 21st April 1730good
old gentleman never to be heard of in Diplomatic History more
Dubourgay went in the first days of May and the month is not out when
Hotham is off to the Camp of Radewitz leaving his Negotiation as it
were extinct To the visible regret of the Berlin public generally
to the grievous disappointment of Queen Sophie of the CrownPrince and
some othersnot to speak of Wilhelminas feelings which are unknown
to us

Regretful Berlin Wilhelmina and Mamma among the others had by
accident in these dejected circumstances a strange Sign from the
Heavens provided them one nightif we may be permitted to notice it
here Monday 29th Mayand poor Queen Sophie we observe withal is
in the hands of the MONTHLY NURSE since Tuesday last Prince Ferdinand
her last child Father of him whose fate lay at Jenz seventysix years
afterwards born 23d May 1730




ST PETERS CHURCH IN BERLIN HAS AN ACCIDENT

Monday 29th May 1730 Friedrich Wilhelm and the CrownPrince and Party
were at Potsdam so far on their way towards Radewitz All is peaceable
at Potsdam that night but it was a night of wild phenomena at Berlin
or rather of one wild phenomenon the Burning of the SANCTPETERS
KIRCHE which held the whole City awake and in terror for its life
Dim Fassmann becomes unusually luminous on this affair probably an
eyewitness to it poor old soul and enables us to fish up one old
Night of Berlin City and its vanished populations into clear view again
if we like

For two years back Berlin had been diligently building a nonplusultra
of Steeples to that fine Church of St Peters Highest Steeple of them
all one of the Steeples of the World in a mannerand Berlin was now
near ending it Tower or shaft has been complete some time interior
fittings going on and is just about to get its ultimate apex a
CrownRoyal set on it by way of finis For his Majesty the great
AEdile was much concerned in the thing and had given materials
multifarious helps Three incomparable Bells especially were his gift
melodious old Bells of distinguished tone bigger than the Great Bell
of Erfurt than Tom of Lincolnor as brief popular rumor has it
the biggest Bells in the World at least of such a TONE These Bells
are hung silent but ready in their upper chamber of the Tower and
the gigantic Crown or apex is to go on then will the basketwork of
scaffolding be peeled away and the Steeple stretch high and grand
into the air for ages it is hoped

Far otherwise On Monday evening between eight and nine there gathered
thunder over Berlin wild tumult of the elements thunderbolt thrice
in swift succession struck the unfinished Steeple in the hood of
which men thereupon noticed a light as of a star or sparkle of the
sun and straightway in spite of the raintorrents there burst out
blazes of flame Blazes unquenchable grand yet perilous to behold The
firedrums beat the alarmbells clanged and ceased not all Berlin
struggling there all night in vain Such volumes of smoke the
heavens were black as if you had hung them with mortcloth such roaring
cataracts of flame you could have picked up a copper doit at the
distance of 800 yardsHissss what hissing far aloft is that
That is the incomparable big Bells melting There they vanish their
fine tones never to be tried more and ooze through the redhot ruin
Hushshsht the last sound heard from them And the stem for holding
that immense Crownroyalit is a bar and bars of iron weighing
sixteen hundredweight down it comes thundering crashing through the
belly of St Peters the fall of it like an earthquake all round And
still the firedrums beat and from all surviving Steeples of Berlin
goes the clangor of alarm none but the very young children can have
slept that night says our vigilant old friend

Wind was awake too kindling the neighboring streetsstorming towards
the PowderMagazine where labor innumerable Artillerymen busy with
hides from the tanpits with stabledung and other material speed
to them we will say Forty dwellinghouses went but not
the PowderMagazine not Berlin utterly so to speak by the
PowderMagazine On the morrow St Peters and neighborhood lay black
but still inwardly burning not for three days more could the ruins be
completely quenched

That was the news for Friedrich Wilhelm before sunrise on the point
of his departure for Muhlberg and King Augusts scenic exhibitions
HMbut we must go all the same We will rebuild it said heAnd
truly he did so And the polite King August sorry to hear of the
Peterskirche gave him excellent sandstone from the quarries of Pirna
says Fassmann great blocks came boating down the Elbe from that
notable Saxon Switzerland Country notable to readers here in time
coming and are to be found as ashlar in the modern St Peters at
Berlin a fact which the reader till Pirna be better known to him may
remember if he likes Fassmann pp 406409

And now let us to Radewitz without delay




Chapter III  CAMP OF RADEWITZ

The Camp of Muhlberg called more properly the Camp of Radewitz towards
which Friedrich Wilhelm with English Hotham and many dignitaries are
now gone was one of the sublimest scenic military exhibitions in the
history of the world leaving all manner of imitation tournaments
modern tintournaments out of sight and perhaps equalling the Field
of the Cloth of Gold or Barbarossas Mainz Tournament in ancient times
It lasted for a month regardless of expenseJune month of the year
1730and from far and wide the idle of mankind ran by the thousand
to see it Shall the thing be abolished utterlyas perhaps were
proper had not our CrownPrince been there with eyes very open to it
and yet with thoughts very shutor shall some flying trace of the big
Zero be given Riddling or screening certain cartloads of heavy
old German printed rubbish Chiefly the terrible compilation called
_HeldenStaats und LebensGeschichte des c Friedrichs des Andern_
History Heroical Political and Biographical of Friedrich the Second
Frankfurt and Leipzig 17591760 vol i first HALF pp 171210 There
are ten thick and thin halfvolumes and perhaps more One of the most
hideous imbroglios ever published under the name of Bookwithout
vestige of Index and on paper that has no margin and cannot stand
inkyet with many curious articles stuffed blindly into the awful
belly of it like jewels into a ragsack or into TEN ragsacks all in
one with far more authenticity than you could expect in such case Let
us call it for brevity _HeldenGeschichte_ in future references
to omit the Hotham Despatches we obtained the following shovelful
of authentic particulars perhaps not quite insupportable to existing
mankind

The exact size of the Camp of Radewitz I nowhere find measured but
to judge on the map At p 214 it must have covered with its
appendages some ten or twelve square miles of ground All on the Elbe
right bank of the Elbe Town of Muhlberg chief Town of the District
lying some ten miles northwest then not much beyond it Torgau and
then famed Wittenberg all on the northwest farther down the River and
on the other side Meissen with its Potteries not far to the southeast
of you up the River on the Dresden hand Nay perhaps many of
my readers have seen the place and not known in their touring
expeditions which are now blinder than ever and done by steam without
even eyesight not to say intelligence Precisely where the railway
from Leipzig to Dresden crosses the Elbethere if you happen to
have daylight is a flat rather clayey country dirtygreenish as if
depastured partly by geese with a big full River Elbe sweeping through
it banks barish for a mile or two River itself swift sleek and of
flintcolor not unpleasant to behold thus far on its journey from the
Bohemian GiantMountains seaward precisely there when you have
crossed the Bridge is the southmost corner of August the Strongs
Encampmentvanished now like the last flock of geese that soiled and
nibbled these localitiesand without knowing it you are actually
upon memorable ground

Actually we may well say apart from August and his fooleries For
here also it was on the ground now under your eye that Kurfurst Johann
Friedrich the Magnanimous having been surprised the day before at
public worship in the abovementioned Town of Muhlberg and completely
beaten by Kaiser Karl the Fifth and his Spaniards and Duke of Alba
did on Monday 25th April 1547 ride forth as Prisoner to meet the said
Kaiser and had the worst reception from him poor man Take pity on
me O God This is what it is come to the magnanimous beaten Kurfurst
was heard murmuring as he rode At sight of the Kaiser he dismounted
pulled off his ironplated gloves knelt and was for humbly taking the
Kaisers hand to kiss it Kaiser would not Kaiser looked thunderous
tornado on him with hands rigidly in the vertical direction The
magnanimous Kurfurst arose therefore doffed his hat Greatmightiest
GROSSMACHTIGSTER allgracious Kaiser I am your Majestys prisoner
said he confining himself to the historical I AM Kaiser now
then answered the sullen Tornado with a black brow and hanging
underjawI request my imprisonment may be princelike said the
poor Prince It shall be as your deserts have beenI am in your
power you will do your pleasure on me answered the otherand was
led away to hard durance and peril of life for five years to come
his Cousin Moritz having expertly jockeyed his Electoral dignities
and territories from him in the interim De Wette _Kursgefasste

Expert Cousin Moritz in virtue of which same Moritz or rather perhaps
in VICE of him August the Strong is even now Elector of Saxony Papist
PseudoPapist Apostate King of Poland and Nonplusultra of gluttonous
Royal Flunkies doomed to do these fooleries on Gods Earth for a time
For the sins of the fathers are visited upon the childrenin ways
little dreamt of by the flunky judgmentto the sixth generation and
farther Truly enough this is memorable ground little as King August
thinks of it little as the idle tourists think or the depasturing
geese who happen to be there

The ten square miles have been industriously prepared for many months
past shaved swept by the best engineer science every village of
it thoroughly cleaned at least the villages all let lodgings at a
Californian rate in one village Moritz by name Map at page 214 is
the slaughterhouse killing oxen night and day and the bakehouee with
160 mealy bakers who never rest in another village Strohme is the
playhouse of the region in another Glaubitz the postoffice nothing
could excel the arrangements much superior I should judge to those
for the Siege of Troy and other worldgreat enterprises Worthy really
of admiration had the business not been zero Foreign Courts European
Diplomacy at large wondered much what cunning scheme lay hidden here
No scheme at all nor purpose on the part of poor August only that of
amusing himself and astonishing the flunkies of Creationregardless
of expense Three temporary Bridges three besides the regular ferry of
the country cross the Elbe for the high officers dames damosels and
lordships of degree and thousandfold spectators lodge on both sides
of the Elbe three Bridges one of pontoons one of woodrafts one of
barrels immensely long made for the occasion The whole Saxon Army
30000 horse and foot with their artillery all in beautiful brandnew
uniforms and equipments lies beautifully encamped in tents and wooden
huts near by Zeithayn its rear to the Elbe this is the ARMEE LAGER
Camp of the Army in our old Rubbish Books Northward of whichwith
the Heath of Gorisch still well beyond and bluish to you in
the farther Northrises on favorable ground a high Pavilion
elaborately built elaborately painted and gilded with balcony stages
round it from which the whole ground and everything done in it is
surveyable to spectators of rank

Eastward again or from the Pavilion southeastward at the right flank
of the Army where again rises a kind of Height hard by Radewitz
favorable for surveythere built of sublime silk tents or solid
wellpainted carpentry the general color of which is bright green
with gilt knobs and gilt gratings all about is the HAUPTLAGER
Headquarters Main LAGER Heart of all the LAGERS where his Prussian
Majesty and his Polish ditto with their respective suites are lodged
Kinglike wholly in extensive green palaces ready gilt and furnished
such drawingrooms such bedrooms with floors of dyed wickerwork
the gilt mirrors pictures musical clocks not even the fine
bathingtubs for his Prussian Majesty have been forgotten Never did man
or flunky see the like Such immense successful apparatus without and
within no end of military valetaille chiefly janizaries in Turk
costume improvised flowergardens even and walks of yellow sandthe
whole Hill of Radewitz made into a flowergarden in that way Nay in
the Army LAGER too many of the Captains have made little improvised
flowergardens in that Camp of theirs up and down For other Captains
not of a poetical turn there are billiards coffeehouses and plenty
of excellent beer and other liquor But the mountains of cavalry hay
that stand guarded by patrols in the rearward places and the granaries
of cavalry oats are not to be told Eastward from their open porticos
and precincts with imitation janizaries pacing silent lower down
the Two Majesties oversee the Army at discretion can survey all
thingseven while dining which they do daily like very kings Fritz
is lodged there has a magnificent bed poor young fellow he alone now
makes the business of any meaning to us He is curious enough to see the
phenomena military and other but oppressed with black care My Amelia
is not here and the tyrant Father istyrannous with his rattan ye

We could insist much on the notable people that were there for the
Lists of them are given Many high Lordships some of whom will meet

that middleaged heavy gentleman Prince of AnhaltZerbst Prussian
Commandant of Stettin Not over rich would not even be rich if he came
to be reigning Duke as he will do attentive at his post in those
parts ever since the SiegeofStralsund time has done his orders
fortified Stettin to perfection solid heavy taciturn manof whom
there is nothing notable but this only That last year his Wife brought
him a little Daughter Catharine the name of her His Wife is a foolish
restless dame highborn and penniless let her nurse well this little
Catharine little Catharine will become abundantly distinguished in a
thirty years hence Empress of all the Russias that little girl the
Fates have so appointed it mocking the prophecies of men Here too is
our poor unmentionable Duke of Mecklenburg poor soul he has left his
quarrels with the Ritterschaft for a week or two and is here breathing
the air of the Elbe Heaths His wild Russian Wife wild Peters niece
and more we are relieved to know is dead for her ways and Peters have
been very strange To this unmentionable Duke of Mecklenburg she has
left one Daughter a Princess ElizabethCatherine who will be called
Princess ANNE one day whose fortunes in the world may turn out to be
tragical Potential heiress of all the Russias that little Elizabeth or
Anne Heiress by her wily aunt Anne of CourlandAnne with the swollen
cheek whom Moritz capable of many things and of being MARECHAL DE
SAXE by and by could not manage to fall in love with there and who
has now just quitted Courland and become Czarina Peter II her
Cousingerman died January 1730 Mannsteins _Russia_if Aunt Anne
with the big cheek should die childless as is likely this little Niece

In the train of King August are likewise splendors of a sort if we had
time for them Dukes of SachsenGotha Dukes of Meiningen most of the
Dukes that put Sachsen to their nameSachsenWeimar for one who is
Grandfather of Goethes Friend if not otherwise distinguished

CrownPrinceand though plainlooking and not of the sweetest temper
is a very high Lady indeed Niece of the present Kaiser Karl Daughter
of the late Kaiser Joseph of blessed memoryfor which reason August
never yet will sign the Pragmatic Sanction his CrownPrince having
hereby rights of his own in opposition thereto She is young to her
is Tiefenau northward on the edge of the Gorisch Heath probably the
choicest mansion in these circuits given up also she is Lady of
the Bucentaur frigate equal to Cleopatras galley in a manner and
commands so to speak by land and water Supreme Lady she of this
sublime worldfoolery regardless of expense so has the gallantry of
August ordered it Our Friedrich and she will meet again on occasions
not like thisWhat the other Princesses and Countesses present
on this occasion were to CrownPrince Friedrich except a general
flowerbed of human natureask not nor even whether the Orzelska was
so much as here The Orzelska will be married some two months
hence 10th August 1730 Sir T Robinson Despatch from Dresden in
StatePaper Office to a HolsteinBeck not to Holstein PLATE but
to his Brother the unfortunate Saxon MajorGeneral a man surely not of
nice tastes in regard to marriageand I would recommend him to keep
his light Wife at home on such occasions They parted as we said in
a year or two mutually indignant and the Orzelska went to Avignon
to Venice and elsewhither and settled into Catholic devotion in
cheap countries of agreeable climate See Pollnitz  _Memoirs_ c
whoever is curious about her

CrownPrince Friedrich doubtless looking at this flowerbed of human
nature and the reward of happy daring paid by Beauty has vivid images
of Princess Amelia and her Viceregency of Hanover bright Princess and
Viceregency divided from him by bottomless gulfs which need such a
swim as that of Leander across the material Hellespont was but a trifle
toIn which of the villages Hotham and Dickens lodged I did not learn
or inquire nor are their copious Despatches chronicling these sublime
phenomena from day to day for behoof of St Jamess other than entirely
inane to us at this time But one thing we do learn from them
Our CrownPrince escaping the paternal vigilance was secretly in
consultation with Dickens or with Hotham through Dickens and this in
the most tragic humor on his side In such effulgences of luxury and
scenic grandeur how sad an attendant is Black Carenay foul misusage
not to be borne by human nature Accurate Professor Ranke has read
somewheredoes not comfortably say where nor comfortably give the
least datethis passage or what authorizes him to write it In that
PleasureCamp of Muhlberg where the eyes of so many strangers were
directed to him the CrownPrince was treated like a disobedient boy
and one time even with strokes KORPERLICH MISSHANDELT to make him
feel he was only considered as such The enraged King who never weighed
the consequences of his words added mockery to his manual outrage He
said Had I been treated so by my Father I would have blown my brains
out but this fellow has no honor he takes all that comes Ranke
_Neun Bucher Preussischer Geschichte_ Berlin 1847 i 297 EINMAL
KORPERLICH MISSHANDELT why did not the Professor give us time
occasion circumstances and name of some eyewitness For the fact
which stands reported in the like fashion in all manner of Histories
we shall otherwise find to be abundantly certain and it produced
conspicuous definite results It is as it were the one fact still
worth human remembrance in this expensive Radewitz and its fooleries
and is itself left in that vague inert stateirremediable at present

Beaten like a slave while lodged while figuring about like a royal
highness in this sumptuous manner It appears clearly the poor Prince
did hereupon in spite of his word given to Wilhelmina make up his
mind to run Ingenious Ranke forgetting again to date knows from the
Archives that Friedrich went shortly afterwards to call on Graf von
Hoym one day Speaking to Graf von Hoym who is Saxon FirstMinister
and Factotum of the arrangements here he took occasion cursorily to
ask Could not a glimpse of Leipzig among all these fine things be
had Order for horses to or at Leipzig for a couple of officers
Lieutenant Keith and selfquietly without fuss of passes and the
like Herr GrafThe Herr Graf glances into it with eyes which have a
twinkle in them SCHWERLICH Royal Highness They are very strict about
passes Do not try it Royal Highness Ranke ib Forster i 365 and
more especially iii 4 Seckendorfs Narrative there And Friedrich
did desist in that direction poor youth but tried it the more in
others Very busy in deep secrecy corresponding with Lieutenant Katte
at Berlin consulting tragically with Captain Guy Dickens hereWhether
any hint or whisper came to the Prussian Majesty from Graf von
Hoym Lieutenant Keith was shortly after sent to Wesel to mind his
soldiering there far down the Rhine Country in the Garrison of Wesel
Wilhelmina told us lately supra p 149 Keith HAD been sent to
Wesel but she has misdated as usual better there than colleaguing
with a Fritz and suggesting to him idle truancies or worse

With Katte at Berlin the desperate Prince has concocted another scheme
of Flight this Hoym one being impossible scheme executable by Katte
and him were this Radewitz once over And as for his consultations
with Guy Dickens the result of them is Captain Dickens on the 16th of
June with eyes brisk enough and lips well shut sets out from
Radewitz express for London This is what I read as abstract of HOTHAMS
DESPATCH 16th June 1730 which Dickens is to deliver with all caution
at St Jamess CrownPrince has communicated to Dickens his plan of
escape could no longer bear the outrages of his Father Is to attend
his Father to Anspath shortly JOURNEY TO THE REICH of which we shall
hear anon and they are to take a turn to Stuttgard which latter
is not very far from Strasburg on the French side of the Rhine To
Strasburg he will make his escape stay six weeks or a couple of months
that his Mother be not suspected and will then proceed to England
Hopes England will take such measures as to save his Sister from ruin
These are his fixed resolutions what will England do in such abstruse
caseCaptain Dickens speeds silently with his Despatch will find Lord
Harrington not Townshend any more Resigned 15th May 1730 Despatch
to Hotham as farewell of that date will copiously open his lips to
Harrington on matters Prussian A brisk military man in the prime of
his years who might do as Prussian Envoy himself if nothing great were
going on Harringtons final response will take some deliberating

Hotham meanwhile resumes his report as we too must do of the Scenic
Exhibitionsand we can well fancy is getting weary of it wishing to
be home rather as his business here seems ended Preceding Despatch
of 16th June One day he mentions a rumor inane high rumors being
prevalent in such a place rumor circulated here to which I do not
give the slightest credit that the PrinceRoyal of Prussia is to have
one of the Archduchesses perhaps Maria Theresa herself Which might
indeed have saved immensities of trouble to the whole world as well
as to the Pair in question and have made a very different History for
Germany and the rest of us Fancy it But for many reasons change of
religion had there been no other it was an impossible notion May
be thinks Hotham that the Court of Vienna throws out this bait to
continue the Kings delusionor a snuffle from Seckendorf without
the Court may have given it currency in so inane an element as
Radewitz

Of the terrific ShamBattles conducted by Weissenfels on one side and
Wackerbarth on the other of the charges of cavalry play of artillery
threatening to end in a very doomsday round the Pavilion and the Ladies
and the Royalties assembled on the balconies there who always go to
dinner safe when victory has declared itself I shall say nothing Nor
of that supreme attack on the intrenchments blowingup of the very
Bridges cavalry posted in the woods host doing its very uttermost
against host with unheardof expenditure of gunpowder and learned
manoeuvre in which the Fleet of shallops on the Elbe rigged mostly
in silk took part and the Bucentaur with all its cannon Words fail
on such occasions I will mention only that assiduous King August had
arranged everything like the King of PlayhouseManagers was seen
early in the morning driving his own curricle all about in vigilant
supervision and inspection crossed the Tubbridge or perhaps the
Floatbridge not yet blown up in a WURSTWAGEN giving himself what
proved well founded the assurance of success for this great dayand
finally that on the morrow there occurred an illumination and display
of fireworks the like of which is probably still a desideratum

For the Bucentaur and Fleet were all hung with colored lamplets
Headquarters HAUPTLAGER and ArmyLAGER ditto ditto gleaming upwards
with their golden light into the silver of the Summer Twilightand
all this is still nothing to the scene there is across the Elbe on our
southeast corner You behold that Palace of the Genii wings turrets
mainbody battlements it is a gigantic wooden frame on which two
hundred carpenters have been busy for above six months ever since
Christmas last Two hundred carpenters and how many painters I cannot
say but they have smeared six thousand yards of linen canvas which
is now nailed up hung with lamps begirt with fireworks no end of
rocketserpents catherinewheels with cannon and fieldmusic near and
far to correspondand is now evening of the 24th June 1730 shining
to men and gods Pinnacles turrets tablatures tipt with various fires

interpret delicate allusions Every letter bigger than a man it may be
read almost at Wittenberg I should think flaming as PICA written on
the sky from the steepletops there THUS SUPPORTED IT WILL STAND
and pious mortals murmur Hope so I am sureand the cannons fire
almost without ceasing and the fieldmusic guided by telegraphs
bursts over all the scene at due moments and the Catherinewheels fly
hissing and the Bucentaur and silk Brigantines glide about like living
flambeausand in fact you must fancy such a sight King August
tired to the bone and seeing all successful retired about midnight
Friedrich Wilhelm stood till the finale Saxon CrownPrince and he
in a window of the highest house in Promnitz our young Fritz and the
Margraf of Anspach they also in a neighboring window 24th25th June
_HeldenGeschichte_ above spoken of i 200 stood till the finale
two in the morning when the very Sun was not far from rising

Or is not the ultimate closing day perhaps still notabler a day of
universal eating Debauchee King August had a touch of genuine human
goodhumor in him poor devil and had the best of stomachs Eighty
oxen fat as Christmas were slain and roasted subsidiary viands I do
not count that all the world might have one good dinner The soldiers
divided into proper sections had cut trenches raised flat mounds laid
planks and so by trenching and planking had made at once table
and seat wood well secured on turf At the end of every table rose
a triglyph two strong wooden posts with lintel on the lintel stood
spiked the oxs head oxs hide hanging beneath it as drapery and on
the two sides of the two posts hung free the four roasted quarters
of said ox from which the common man joyfully helped himself Three
measures of beer he had and two of winewhich unless the measures
were miraculously small we may take to be abundance Thus they in two
long rows 30000 of them by the tale dine joyfully SUB DIO The two
Majesties and two CrownPrinces rode through the ranks as dinner went
on King of Prussia forever and caps into the airat length they
retire to their own HAUPTQUARTIER where themselves dining they can
still see the soldiers dine or at least drink their three measures and
two Dine yea dine abundantly let all mortals have one good dinner

Royal dinner is not yet done when a new miracle appears on the field
the largest Cake ever baked by the Sons of Adam Drawn into the
Headquarter about an hour ago on a wooden frame with tent over it by
a team of eight horses tent curtaining it guarded by Cadets now the
tent is struck and offsaw mortals ever the like It is fourteen ells
KLEINE ELLEN long by six broad and at the centre half an ell thick
Baked by machinery how otherwise could peel or roller act on such a
Cake There are five thousand eggs in it thirtysix bushels Berlin
measure of sound flour one tun of milk one tun of yeast one ditto
of butter crackers gingerbreadnuts for fillet or trimming run all
round Plainly the Prince of Cakes A Carpenter with gigantic knife
handle of it resting on his shoulderHead of the Board of Works
giving word of commandenters the Cake by incision cuts it up by
plan by successive signal from the Board of Works What high person
would not keep for himself to say nothing of eating some fraction
of such a Nonpareil There is cut and come again for all Carpenter
advances by main trench and by side trenches steadily to word of
command

I mention as another trait of the poor devil of an August full of
goodhumor after all That he and his Royalties and big Lordships having
dined he gave the still groaning table with all its dishes to
be scrambled for by the janizaries Janizaries ImitationTurk
valetaille who speedily made clearancemany a bit of precious Meissen
porcelain going far down in society by that means

Royal dinner done the Colonel and Officers of every regiment ranked
in high order with weapons drawn preceded by their respective bands of
music came marching up the Hill to pay their particular respects to
the Majesty of Prussia Majesty of Prussia promised them his favor
everlasting as requested drank a glass of wine to each party steady
your Majesty who all responded by glasses of wine and threw the
glasses aloft with shouts Sixty pieces of artillery speaking the while
and the bands of music breathing their sweetesttill it was done and
his Majesty still steady on his feet He could stand a great deal of
wine

And now Well the Cake is not done many cubic yards of cake
are still left and the very corporals can do no more let the Army
scramble Army whipt it away in no time And now alas nowthe time
IS come for parting It is ended all things end Not for about an hour
could the HERRSCHAFTEN Lordships and minor Sovereignties fairly tear
themselves away under wailing music and with the due emotion

The Prussian Royalties and select few took boat down the River on the
morrow towards Lichtenburg HuntingPalace for one days slaughtering
of game They slaughtered there about one thousand living creatures
all driven into heaps for themsix hundred of red game of the stag
species four hundred black or of the boar ditto They left all
these creatures dead dined immensely then did go sorrowfully sated
CrownPrince Friedrich in his own carriage in the rear Papa in his
preceding by a few minutes all the wood horns or French horns wailing
sad adieuand hurried towards Berlin through the ambrosial night

And so it is all ended And August the Strongwhat shall we say of
August History must admit that he attains the maximum in several
things Maximum of physical strength can break horseshoes nay
halfcrowns with finger and thumb Maximum of sumptuosity really a
polite creature no man of his means so regardless of expense Maximum
of Bastards three hundred and fiftyfour of them probably no mortal
ever exceeded that quantity Lastly he has baked the biggest Bannock
on record Cake with 5000 eggs in it and a tun of butter These things
History must concede to him Poor devil he was full of goodhumor too
and had the best of stomachs His amputated greattoe does not mend
out upon it the world itself is all so amputated and not like mending
August the Strong dilapidated at fiftythree is fast verging towards a
less expensive country and in three years hence will be lodged gratis
and need no cook or flunky of either sex

This Camp of Radewitz says Smelfungus one of my Antecessors
finishing his long narrative of it this Camp is Nothing and after all
this expense of King Augusts and mine it flies away like a dream But
alas were the Congresses of Cambrai and Soissons was the lifelong
diplomacy of Kaiser Karl or the History of torpid moribund Europe in
those days much of a Something The Pragmatic Sanction with all its
protocolling has fled like the temporary Playhouse of King August
erected there in the village of Strohme Much talk noise and imaginary
interest about both but both literally have become zero WERE always
zero As well talk about the one as the otherThen why not SILENCE
about both my Friend Smelfnngus He answers That truly is the thing
to be aimed atand if we had once got our own out of both let both
be consumed with fire and remain a handful of inarticulate black ashes
forevermore Heavens will I of all men object

Smelfungus says elsewhere

The moral to be derived perhaps the chief moral visible at present
from all this Section of melancholy History is Modern Diplomacy is
nothing mind well your own affairs leave those of your neighbors well
alone The Pragmatic Sanction breaking Fritzs Friedrich Wilhelms
Sophies Wilhelminas English Amelias and I know not how many private
hearts and distracting with vain terrors and hopes the general soul of
Europe for fiveandtwenty years fell at once into dust and vapor
and went wholly towards limbo on the stormwinds doing nothing for
or against any mortal Friedrich Wilhelms 80000 welldrilled troops
remained very actual with their firelocks and iron ramrods and did
a thing or two there being a Captain over them Friedrich Wilhelms
Directorium welldrilled Prussian Downing Street every man steady
at his duty and no wind to be wasted where silence was better did
likewise very authentically remainand still remains Nothing of
genuine and human that Friedrich Wilhelm did but remained and remains an
inheritance not the smallest item of IT lost or losableand the rude

Chapter IV  EXCELLENCY HOTHAM QUITS BERLIN IN HASTE

While the Camp at Radewitz is dissolving itself in this manner in the
last days of June Captain Guy Dickens the oracles at Windsor having
given him their response as to Prince Friedrichs wild project is
getting under way for Berlin againwhither also Hotham has returned
to wait for Dickenss arrival and directly thereupon come home Dickens
is henceforth to do the British Diplomacy here any Diplomacy there can
well be Dickens once installed Hotham will right gladly wash his
hands of this Negotiation which he considers to be as good as dead for
a longish while past First however he has one unexpected adventure
to go through in Berlin of most unexpected celebrity in the world this
once succinctly set forth History will dismiss him to the shades of
private life

Guy Dickens arriving we can guess about the 8th or 9th of July brings
two important Documents with him to Berlin FIRST the English Response
in the shape of Instructions to himself which may be ostensible in
the proper quarter in regard to the CrownPrinces project of flight
into England Response which is no other than might have been expected
in the circumstances Britannic Majesty sorry extremely for the
CrownPrinces situation ready to do anything in reason to alleviate
it Better wait however Prussian Majesty will surely perhaps relent a
little then also the affairs of Europe are in a ticklish state Better
wait As to that of taking temporary refuge in France Britannic Majesty
thinks that will require a mature deliberation MURE DELIBERATION Not
even time now for inquiry of the French Court how they would take it
which his Britannic Majesty thinks an indispensable preliminaryand
so terminates The meaning we perceive is in sum Hm you wont
surely Dont at least Dont yet But Dryasdust and any readers who
have patience can here take the Original Paper which is written
in French or French of Stratford at the Bow probably that the
CrownPrince if needful might himself read it one of these days

Monsieur Guy Dickens pourrait donner au Prince les assurances les plus
fortes de la compassion que le Roi a du triste etat ou il se trouve
et du desir sincere de Sa Majeste de concourir par tout ce qui dependra
delle a len tirer M Guy Dickens pourrait lui communiquer en meme
terns les Instructions donnees a Monsieur Hotham _our Answer to the
Outrageous propositions which amounts to nothing and may be spared
the reader_ et lui marquer quon avait lieu desperer que Sa Majeste
Prussienne ne refuserait pas au moins de sexpliquer un peu plus en
detail quelle na fait jusquici Quen attendant les suites que cette
negociation pourrait avoir Sa Majeste etait davis que le Prince
ferait bien de differer un peu lexecution de son dessein connu Que
la situation ou les affaires de lEurope se trouvaient dans ce moment
critique ne paraissait pas propre a lexecution dun dessein de cette
nature Que pour ce qui est de lintention ou le Prince a temoigne
etre de se retirer en France Sa Majeste croit quelle demande une mure
deliberation et que le peu de tems qui reste ne promet pas meme quon
puisse sinformer de ce que la Cour de France pourrait penser ladessus
dont Sa Majeste trouvait cependant absolument necessaire de lassurer
avant de pouvoir conseiller a un Prince qui lui est si cher de se
retirer en ce pays la Prussian Despatches vol xii No date or
signature bound up along with Harringtons Despatch Windsor 20th
June 1st July 1730on the morrow of which day we may fancy Captain
Dickens took the road for Berlin againwhere we auspiciously see him
on Monday 10th July probably a night or two after his arrival This
is Document FIRST of no concernment to Hotham at this stage but only
to us and our CrownPrince Document SECOND would at one time have much
interested Hotham it is no other than a Grumkow Original seized at
St Mary Axe such as Hotham once solicited strong enough to break
Grumkows back Hotham now scarcely hopes it will be strong enough
No matter he presents it as bidden On introducing Dickens as
successor Monday 10th July he puts the Document into his Prussian
Majestys hand andthe result was most unexpected Here is Hothams
Despatch to Lord Harrington which it will be our briefest method to
give with some minimum of needful explanation intercalated here and
there


TO THE LORD HARRINGTON from Sir Charles Hotham

BERLIN 30th June 11th July 1730

MY LORDThough the conduct of his Prussian Majesty has been such for
some time past that one ought to be surprised at nothing he doesit
is nevertheless with great concern that I now have to acquaint your
Lordship with an extravagancy of his which happened yesterday Monday
10th July 1730

The King of Prussia had appointed me to be with him about noon with
Captain Guy Dickens who has just returned from England on what secret
message your Lordship knowsWe both attended his Prussian
Majesty and I presented Captain Guy Dickens to him who delivered his
credentials after which the King talked to us a quarter of an hour
about indifferent matters Seeing him in a very good humor I took that
opportunity of telling him That as General Grumkow had denied his
having held a Secret Correspondence with Reichenbach or having written
the Letters I had some time ago delivered to his Majesty I was now
ordered by the King my Master to put into his hands an Original Letter
of General GrumkowWhere is that Original Letter ask some minute
readers Minute readers the IPSISSIMUM CORPUS of it is lost to mankind
Official Copy of it lies safe here in the StatePaper Office Prussian
Despatches volume xli without date of its own but near a Despatch
dated 20th June 1730 has adjoined to it an Autograph jotting by
George Second to the effect Yes send it and also some preliminary
scribbles by Newcastle to the like purport No date of its own we
say though by internal evidence and light of FASSMANN p 404 it
is conclusively datable Berlin 20th May if anybody cared to date it
The Letter mentions lightly that pretended discovery the StMaryAxe
one laid on the table of TobaccoParliament 6th May or soon after
innocent trifles all _I_ wrote hope you burnt them nevertheless
according to promise yours to me I did burn as they came and will defy
the Devil to produce brags of his Majestys fine spiritsand is
Jotting and all as insignificant a Letter as any other portion of the
Rookery Colloquy though its fate was a little more distinguished
Prussian Dryasdust is expected to give it in FACSIMILE one
daysurely no British UnderSecretary will exercise an unwise
discretion and forbid him that small pleasurewhich was an
undeniable proof of all the rest and could not but convince his
Prussian Majesty of the truth of themWell

He took the Letter from me cast his eye upon it and seeing it to
be Grumkows hand said to me with all the anger imaginable fancy the
thunderburst _Messieurs jai eu assez de ces choses la_ threw
the Letter upon the ground and immediately turning his back went out of
the room and shut the door upon usprobably with a slam And
that is the naked truth concerning this celebrated Intercepted Letter
Majesty answered explosivelyhis poor heart being in a burdened and
grieved condition not unlike growing a haunted oneI have had enough
of that stuff before pitched the new specimen away and stormily
whirled out with a slam of the door That he stamped with his foot is
guessable That he lifted his foot as if to kick the Honorable English
Excellency Wilhelmina i 228 which the English Excellency never
could have stood but must have died on the spotof this though
several Books have copied it from Wilhelmina there is no vestige of
evidence and the case is bad enough without this

Your Lordship will easily imagine that Captain Guy Dickens and I were
not a little astonished at this most extraordinary behavior I took up
the Letter he had thrown upon the floor IPSISSIMUM CORPUS of it lost
to mankind last seen going into Hothams pocket in this manner and
returning home immediately wrote one to his Prussian Majesty of which
a copy is here enclosedLet us read that essential Piece sound
substance in very stiff indifferent French of Stratfordwhich may as
well be made English at once


TO HIS MAJESTY THE KING OF PRUSSIA

SIREIt is with the liveliest grief that I find myself under the
necessityafter what has passed today at the audience I had of your
Majesty where I neither did nor said anything in regard to that Letter
of Monsieur Grumkows or to putting it into your Majestys hands that
was not by my Masters orderit is I say Sire with the liveliest
grief that I am obliged to inform your Majesty of the necessity there
lies on me to despatch a Courier to London to apprise the King my Master
of an incident so surprising as the one that has just happened For
which reason I beg SUPPLIE your Majesty will be pleased to cause the
necessary Orders for Posthorses to be furnished me not only for the
said Courier but also for myselfsince after what has just happened
it is not proper for me to prolong my stay here _faire un plus long
sejour ici_

I have the honor to be your Majestys c c c

CHARLES HOTHAM


About two hours afterwards General Borck came to me and told me He
was in the utmost affliction for what had happened and beseeched me to
have a little patience and that he hoped means would be found to make
up the matter to me Afterwards he communicated to me by word of
mouth the Answer the King of Prussia had given to the last Orders I had
received by Captain Guy DickensOrders Come home immediately to
which the Answer is conceivable

I told him that after the treatment I had received at noon and the
affront put upon the King my Masters character I could no longer
receive nor charge myself with anything that came from his Prussian
Majesty That as to what related to me personally it was very easily
made up but having done nothing but in obedience to the King my
Masters orders it belonged to him only to judge what satisfaction was
due for the indignity offered to his character Wherefore I did not look
upon myself as authorized to listen to any expedients till I knew his
Majestys pleasure upon the matter

In the evening General Borck wrote a Letter to Captain Guy Dickens
and two to me the Copies of which are enclosedfear not reader The
purport of them was to desire That I would take no farther notice of
what had happened and that the King of Prussia desired I would come and
dine with him next dayEngaged otherwise your Majesty next day The
Answer to these Letters I also enclose to your Lordshipreader not
to be troubled with it I excused myself from dining with the King of
Prussia not thinking myself at liberty to appear any more at Court till
I received his Majestys my own Kings commands and told General
Borck that I looked upon myself as indispensably obliged to acquaint the
King my Master with everything that had passed it being to no purpose
to think of concealing it since the thing was already become public
and would soon be known in all the Courts of Europe

This my Lord is the true state of this unaccountable accident You
will see by General Borcks Letter that the King of Prussia being now
returned to his senses is himself convinced of the extravagancy of this
proceeding and was very desirous of having it concealedwhich was
impossible for the whole Town knew it an hour after it had happened

As to my own part I am not a little concerned at this unfortunate
incident As it was impossible to foresee this fit of madness in the
King of Prussia there was no guarding against it and after it had
happened I thought I could do no less than resent it in the manner I
have donewithout prostituting the character with which the King has
been pleased to honor me I hope however this affair will be attended
with no ill consequences for the King of Prussia himself is at present
so ashamed of his behavior that he says He will order Count Degenfeld
Graf von Degenfeld going at a leisurely pace to remove NOSTI from his
perch among you Supra p 197 to hasten his journey to England with
orders to endeavor to make up the affair immediately

As I had already received the Kings Orders by Captain Guy Dickens To
return home forthwith I thought after what had happened the sooner I
left this place the better and the rather because it might be proper I
should make a report of it to his Majesty I shall therefore set out
a few hours after this Messenger and will make all the expedition
possible

The King of Prussia sets out for Anspach on Saturday next11th
July is Tuesday Saturday next will be 15th July which proves correct
Fassmann p 410 I am with the utmost respect My Lord Your
Lordships most obedient and most humble servant

StatePaper Office Prussian Despatches vol xli No sooner was the
door slammed to than his Majesty began to repent At sight of the demand
for Posthorses he repented bitterly sent Borck to ask Hotham to
dinner with what success we have seen Sent Borck to negotiate to
correspond to consult with Dickens to do his utmost in pacifying
Hotham All which Correspondence exists but is not worth giving
Borcks remonstrances are in rugged soldierlike style full of
earnestness and friendliness Do not wreck upon trifles a noble
interest we have in common King is jealous about foreign interference

on my own score it were soon settled or is already settled but with
the King my Masterno expedient but posthorses The Diplomatist world

other friendly Ministers how busy All day this day and the next
they spent in comings and goings Wilhelmina i 229 230 advising
Hotham to relent Hotham could not relent The CrownPrince himself
writes urged by a message from his Mother CrownPrince sends Katte off
from Potsdam with this Billet Ib i 230 if this be a correct copy
to translate from


TO HIS EXCELLENCY MONSIEUR THE CHEVALIER HOTHAM

POTSDAM 11th July 1730

MONSIEURHaving learned by M de Leuvener the Danish Minister
a judicious wellaffected man what the King my Fathers ultimate
intentions are I cannot doubt but you will yield to his desires Think
Monsieur that my happiness and my Sisters depend on the resolution
you shall take and that your answer will mean the union or the disunion
forever of the two Houses I flatter myself that it will be favorable
and that you will yield to my entreaties I never shall forget such a
service but recognize it all my life by the most perfect esteem with
which I now am TOUT A VOUS

FREDERIC


This Billet Katte delivers but to this also Hotham remains inexorable
polite hopeful even No harm will come Degenfeld will go I
myself will help when at home but for the present no resource but
posthorses Which they at last yield him the very posthorses ready to
weep

And so Hotham spirited judicious English gentleman rolls off
homewards Wednesday 12th Dickens a few hours after his
Courierand retires honorably into the shades of private life steady
there thenceforth He has not been successful in Berlin surely his
Negotiation is now OUT in all manner of senses Long ago to use our
former ignoble figure he had laid down the bellows though there was
still smoke traceable but now by this Grumkow Letter he has as
it were struck the POKER through the business and that dangerous
manoeuvre not proving successful has been fatal and final Queen
Sophie and certain others may still flatter themselves but it is
evident the Negotiation is at last complete What may lie in flight
to England and rash desperate measures which Queen Sophie trembles
to think of we do not know but by regular negotiation this thing can
never be

It is darkly apprehended the CrownPrince still meditates Flight the
maternal heart and Wilhelminas are grieved to see Lieutenant Katte
so much in his confidencecould wish him a wiser councillor in such
predicaments and emergencies Katte is greatly flattered by the Princes
confidence even brags of it in society with his foolish loose tongue
Poor youth he is of dissolute ways has plenty of it unwise intellect
little of the wise kind and is still under the years of discretion
Towards Wilhelmina there is traceable in him somethingsomething as
of almost loving a bright particular star or of thriceprivately
worshipping it for his own behoof And Wilhelmina during the late
Radewitz time when Mamma gave four Apartments or Royal Soirees
weekly was severe upon him and inaccessible in these Court Soirees A
rash young fool carries a loose tonguestill worse has a Miniature
recognizable as Wilhelmina and would not give it up either for the
Queens Majesty or meThousand and thousand pardons High Ladies
both my loose tongue shall be locked but these two Miniatures the
Prince and Princess Royal I copied them from two the Prince had lent
me and has got back ask me not for thesenever oh I cannot
everUpon which Wilhelmina had to take a high attitude and pass
him speechless in the Soirees The foolish fellowand yet one is not
heartily angry either only reserved in the Soirees and anxious about
ones Brother in such hands

Friedrich Wilhelm repents much that Hotham explosion is heard saying
that he will not again treat in person with any Envoy from foreign
parts being of too hot temper but will leave his Ministers to do it
Dickenss Despatch Berlin 22d July ns 1730 To Queen Sophie he
says coldly Wilhelminas marriage then is off an end to IT Abbess
of Herford good Protestant refuge for unprovided Females of Quality
which is in our gift let her be Abbess thereand writes to the then
extant Abbess to make Wilhelmina Coadjutress or HeirApparent to that
ChiefNunship Nay what is still more mortifying my Brother says On
the whole I had better had not I The cruel Brother but indeed the
desperatefor things are mounting to a pitch in this Household

Queen Sophies thoughtsthey are not yet of surrender that they
will never be while a breath of life is left to Queen Sophie and her
Project we may fancy Queen Sophies mood Nor can his Majesty be in a
sweet temper his vexations lately have been many First England is now
off not offandon as formerly that comfortable possibility hanging
always in ones thoughts is fairly gone and now we have nothing but
the Kaiser to depend on for Julich and Berg and the other elements
of our salvation in this world Then the StMaryAxe discoveries
harassing shadows of suspicion that will rise from them and the
unseemly Hotham catastrophe and ones own blame in it Womankind and
Household still virtually rebellious and all things going awry Majesty
is in the worst humorbullies and outrages his poor CrownPrince
almost worse than ever There have been rattanshowers hideous to think
of descending this very week Guy Dickenss Despatch 18th July 1730
on the fine head and far into the high heart of a Royal Young Man who
cannot in the name of manhood endure and must not in the name of
sonhood resist and vainly calls to all the gods to teach him WHAT he
shall do in this intolerable inextricable state of matters

Fate and these two BlackArtists have driven Friedrich Wilhelm nearly
mad and he in turn is driving everybody so He more than suspects
Friedrich of an intention to fly which is horrible to Friedrich
Wilhelm and yet he bullies him occasionally as a spiritless wretch
for bearing such treatment Cannot you renounce the HeirApparentship
then your little Brother is a fine youth Give it up and go
unmolested to thein fact to the Devil Cannot youIf your
Majesty against the honor of my Mother declare that I am not your
eldest son Yes so not otherwise ever modestly but steadily
persists the young man whenever this expedient is proposed to himas
perhaps it already sometimes is Whereat the desperate Father can only
snort indignantly futile A case growing nearly desperate Desperate
yes on all hands unless one had the high mast above alluded to with
two pulleys and ropes and could see a certain Pair of Scoundrels mount
rapidly thither what hope is there for anybody A violent crisis does
not last however that is one certainty in it Either these agonistic
human beings young and old will all die all go to Bedlam with their
intolerable woes or else something of explosive nature will take place
among them The maddest boil unless it kill you with its torments does
at length burst and become an abscess

Of course Captain Dickens the instant Hotham was gone hastened privily
to see the CrownPrince saw Katte and him at the Gate of the Potsdam
Palace at midnight Wilhelmina Ranke i 301 or in some other less
romantic wayread him the Windsor Paper of INSTRUCTIONS known to us
and preached from that text No definite countenance from England the
reverse rather your Highness seeshow can there be Give it up your
Highness at least delay itCrownPrince does not give it up a whit
whether he delays it we shall see

A busy week for the CrownPrince and Katte this of the Hotham
Catastrophe who have many consultations the Journey to Anspach being
on Saturday next CrownPrince has given him in keeping a writingcase
with private letters 1000 ducats of money money raised by loan by
picking jewels off some miniatures of honor and the like sore methods
Katte has his very coat a gray topcoat or travelling roquelaure in
keepingand their schemes are many Off we must and will be by some
opportunity Could not Katte get a Recruiting Furlough leave to go
into the REICH on that score and join one there Lieutenant Keith is at
Wesel ready always ready Into France into Holland England If the
English would notthere is war to be in Italy say all the Newspapers
why not a campaign as Volunteers in Italy till we saw how matters went
Anything and all things are preferable to ignominy like this No dog
could endure it




Chapter V  JOURNEY TO THE REICH

On Saturday the 15th July 1730 early in the morning as his wont was
Friedrich Wilhelm with a small train of official military persons
rolled off from Potsdam towards Leipzig on that same journey of
his towards Anspach and the Reich To Anspach to see our poor young
daughter lately married there therefrom we can have a run into the
Reich according to circumstances In this wide route there lie many
Courts and scenes which it might behoove us to look into Courts
needing to be encouraged to stand for the Kaisers rights against those
English French and intrusive Foreigners of the Seville Treaty We may
hope at least to ease our own heavy mind and have the chaff somewhat
blown out of it by this rushing through the open atmosphereSuch so
far as I can gather were Friedrich Wilhelms objects in this Journey
which turned out to be a more celebrated one than he expected The
authentic records of it are slight the rumors about it have been many
Forster iii 111 contains Seckendorfs Narrative as sent to Vienna
Preuss iv 470 a Prussian RELATIO EX ACTIS these are the only
two ORIGINAL pieces which I have seen Excerpts of others correct
doubtless but not in a very distinct condition occur in Ranke i
294340 After painful sifting through mountains of dust and ashes for
a poor cinder of a fact here and there our duty is to tell the English
reader one good time what certainties or available cinders have
anywhere turned up CrownPrince Friedrich it has been decided after
some consultation shall go with his Majesty Better he go with us
to be under our own eyes lest he run away or do other mischief Old
General Buddenbrock old Colonel Waldau and LieutenantColonel Rochow
travel in the same carriage with the Prince are to keep a strict
watch over him one of them at least to be always by him Old General
Buddenbrock a grim but human old military gentleman who has been in
all manner of wars he fought at Steenkirk even and in the Siege of
Namur under Dutch William stood through Malplaquet and much else
under Marlborough did the Siege of Stralsund too and descent on Rugen
there which was not his first acquaintance with Karl of Sweden and
is a favorite old friend of Friedrich Wilhelms A good old gentleman
though very strict now hard on sixty He is chief of the Three

Old Waldau not younger though still only Colonel of Horse likewise
celebrates the Malplaquet anniversary a Pomeranian man and silent
smoker in the Tabagie well seen by the master there To these two
elderly authorities LieutenantColonel Rochow still only about forty
and probably sharper of eye is adjoined as active partner I conclude
the Prince and Buddenbrock ride face forward Buddenbrock can tell him
about so many things if he is conversable about Dutch William about
Charles XII whose Polish fights he witnessed as an envoy from
Berlin long ago A Colonel Krocher I find is general manager of the
Journeyand it does not escape notice that Friedrich probably out of
youthful curiosity seems always very anxious to know to the uttermost
settled point where our future stages are to be His Royal Highness
laid in a fair stock of District Maps especially of the Rhine
Countries at Leipzig too Forster iii 2 and is assiduous in
studying themevidently very desirous to know the face of Germany the
Rhine Countries in particular

Potsdam Wittenberg Leipzig the wheels rush rapidly on stage
succeeding stage and early in the afternoon we are at Leipzignever
looking out at Luthers vestiges or Karl Vs or thinking about
Luther which thou and I good English reader would surely have done
in crossing Wittenberg and the birthplace of Protestantism At Leipzig
we were thinking to have dined At the Peters Gate therewhere at
least fresh horses are and a topographic CrownPrince can send hastily
to buy mapsa General Hopfgarten Commandant of the Town is out with
the military honors he has as we privately know an excellent dinner
ready in the Pleissenburg Fortress yonder Fassmann p 410but he
compliments to a dreadful extent Harangues and compliments in no end
of florid inflated tautologic ornamental balderdash repeating and again
repeating What a neverimagined honor it is in particular saying three
times over How the Majesty of Saxony King August had he known would
have wished for wings to fly hither and bowing to the very ground as
if in the Polish manner he wished to clasp your feet said Friedrich
Wilhelm afterwards I can fancy Friedrich Wilhelm somewhat startled
How at the first mention of this idea of big August with his lame
foot taking wing and coming like a gigantic partridge with lame foot
and cockedhat Friedrich Wilhelm grinned How at the second mention
and Polish threat of your feet Friedrich Wilhelm who hates all
lies and cares not for salutations in the marketplace jerks himself
impatiently and saves his feet At the third mention clear it is
Friedrich Wilhelm utters the word ANSPANNEN Horsesand in very
truth takes to the road again hungry indeed but still angrier leaving
Hopfgarten bent into the shape of a parabola and his grand dinner
cooling futile in what tragic humor we can imagine Ib p 411 Why
has no Prussian Painter done that scene Let another Chodowiecki when
another comes try whether he cannot

Friedrich Wilhelm regretted the dinner regretted to hurt the good mans
feelings but could stand it no longer He rushes off for Meuselwitz
where Seckendorf with at least silence and some cold collation instead
of dinner is awaiting him Twenty miles off is Meuselwitz up the
flat valley of the Pleisse River towards Altenburg through a region
memorable were we not so hungry Famed fights have had their arena
here Lutzen the top of its churchsteeple visible on your right it is
there where the great Gustavus fell two hundred years ago on that wide
champaign a kind of Bullring of the Nations how many fights have
been and will be Altenburg one does not see tonight happy were we
but at Meuselwitz a few miles nearer and had seen what dinner the old
Feldzeugmeister has

Dinner enough we need not doubt The old Feldzeugmeister has a big line
Schloss at Meuselwitz his by unexpected inheritance with uncommonly
fine gardens with a good old Wife moreover blithe though
childlessand he is capable of lighting more than one candle when
a King comes to visit him Doubtless the man hurls his thrift into
abeyance and blazes out with conspicuous splendor on this occasion A
beautiful Castle indeed this Meuselwitz of his the towers of Altenburg
visible in the distance Altenburg where Kunz von Kauffungen stole the
two little Princes centuries agowhere we do not mean to pause
at this time On the morrow morningunless they chose to stay over
Sunday which I cannot affirm or denySeckendorf also has made his
packages and joins himself to Friedrich Wilhelms august travelling
party Doing here a portion of the long space length of the Terrestrial
Equator in all which he is fated to accomplish in the way of riding
with that Monarch

From Meuselwitz through Altenburg Gera Saalfeld to Coburg is our
next days journey Up one fork of the Leipzig Pleisse then across the
Leipzig Elster these streams now dwindling to brooks leading us up
to the watershed or central Hillcountries between the Mayn and Saale
Rivers where the same shower will run partly on this hand northward
by the Elster Pleisse or other labyrinthic course into the Saale into
the Elbe and partly on the other hand will flow southward into
the Mayn and so after endless windings in the Fir Mountains
FICHTELGEBIRGE get by Frankfurt into the Rhine at Mainz Mayn takes
the south end of your shower Saale takes the northor farther east
yonder shower will roll down into the same grand Elbe River by the
Mulde over which the Old Dessauer is minded to build a new stone
bridge Wallenstein and others as well as Time have ruined many
bridges there That is the line of the primeval mountains and their
everflowing raincourses in those parts

At Gera dim old Towndoes not your Royal Highness well know the
Gera Bond GERAISCHE VERTRAG Duhan did not forget to inform you of
that It is the cornerstone of the House of Brandenburgs advancement
in the world Here by your august ancestors the Law of Primogeniture
was settled and much rubbish was annihilated in the House of
Brandenburg Eldest Son always to inherit the Electorate unbroken
after Anspach and Baireuth no more apanages upon any cause or pretext
whatsoever and these themselves to lapse irrevocable to the main or
Electoral House should they ever fall vacant again Fine fruit of the
decisive sense that was in the Hohenzollerns of their fine talent for
annihilating rubbishwhich feat if a man can do it and keep doing
it will more than most others accelerate his course in this world It
was in this dim old Town of Gera in the Year 1598 by him that had the
twentythree children that the GERA BOND was brought to parchment
But indeed it was intrinsically only a renewal more solemnly
sanctioned of Albert Achilless HAUS ORDNUNG HouseOrder done in
1478 above a century earlier

But see we are under way again His Prussian Majesty rushes forward
without pause will stop nowhere except where business demands
no Majesty of his day travels at such a speed Orlamunde an hour
henceyour Royal Highness has heard of Orlamunde and its famed Counts
of a thousand years back when Kaiser Redbeard was in the world and the
Junior Hohenzollern tired of hawking came down from the Hills to him
Orlamunde OrlaMOUTH is not far off on our right and this itself is
the Orla this pleasant streamlet we are now quitting which has borne
us company for some time this too will get into the Saale and be at
Magdeburg quite beyond the Dessauers Bridge early tomorrow Ha here
at last is Saalfeld Town and Schloss and the incipient Saal itself
his Serene Highness SaalfeldCoburgs little REZIDENZprobably his
Majesty will call on him in passing I have no doubt he does and
transacts the civilities needful

Christian Ernst whose Schloss this is a gentleman of his Majestys age
born 1683 married an amiable FRAULEIN not of quality whom indeed the
Kaiser has ennobled he lives hereI think courting the shade rather
and rules conjointly with his younger Brother or HalfBrother Franz
Josias who resides at Coburg Dukes of SaalfeldCoburg such is their
style and in good part their possession though it is well known to
this travelling party and the world there has been a Lawsuit about
Coburg this halfcentury and more and though somewhere about 200

perhaps encourage Christian Ernst to stand by a Kaisers Majesty
against these French insolences and the native German Spanish English
derelictions of dutywe are left to the vaguest guess of fancy And
must get on to Coburg for the night

At Coburg in its snug valley under the FESTUNG or Hill Castlewhere
Martin Luther sat solitary during the Diet of Augsburg Diet known to
us our old friend Margraf George of Anspach hypothetically laying his
head on the block there and the great Kaiser Karl V practically
burning daylight with pitiable spilling of wax in the CORPUSCHRISTI
procession there Antea vol v p 197where Martin Luther sat
solitary and wrote that celebrated Letter about 16 Crows holding THEIR
Parliament all round and how the pillars of the world were never seen
by anybody and yet the world is held up in these dumb continents of
spaceat Coburg we will not doubt his Majesty found Franz Josias
at home and illuminated to receive him Franz Josias a hearty man of
thirtyfive he too will stand by the Kaiser in these coming storms
With a weak contingent truly perhaps some score or two of fighters but
many a little makes a mickleremark however two points of a merely
genealogical nature First that Franz Josias has or rather is going
to have a Younger Son Friedrich Josias 17371815 who in some sixty
years hence will become dreadfully celebrated in the streets of Paris
as Austrian Coburg The Austrian Coburg of RobesPierre and Company
An immeasurable terror and portentnot much harm in him either when
he actually comes with nothing but the Duke of York and Dunkirk for
accompanimentto those revolutionary French of 17921794 This is
point FIRST Point SECOND is perhaps still more interesting this
namely That Franz Josias has an Eldest Son boy of six when Friedrich
Wilhelm makes his visita GRANDSONS GRANDSON of whom is at this
day Prince of Wales among the English People and to me a subject of
intense reflection now and then

From Coburg Friedrich Wilhelm after pause again unknown rushed on to
Bamberg new scenes and ever new opening on the eyes of our young Hero
and his Papa The course is down the valley of the Itz one of the many
little valleys in the big slope of the Rodach for the waters are now
turned and all streams and brooks are gurgling incessantly towards
the Mayn Towards Frankfurt Mainz and the Rhinefar enough from the
Saale Mulde or the Old Dessauers Bridge today towards Rotterdam and
the uttermost Dutch swamps today Near upon Bamberg we cross the
Mayn itself Red Mayn and White conjoined coming from Culmbach and
Baireuthmark that your Highness A country of pleasant hills and
vines and in an hour hence through thick fir woodseach side of your
road horribly decked with gibbeted thieves swinging aloft Pollnitz
_Memoirs and Letters_ English Translation London 1745 i 209 Let
me say again this is a different Book from the MEMOIRS of Pollnitz
and a still different from the MEMOIREN or Memoirs of Brandenburg BY
Pollnitz such the excellence of nomenclature in that old foolyou
arrive at Bamberg chief of Bishoprics the venerable town whose
Bishop famous in old times is like an Archbishop and gets his
pallium direct from the Popemuch good may it do him Is
bound however to give up his Territory if the Kaiser elected is
landlessfar enough from likely now And so you are at last fairly in
the Mayn Valley River Mayn itself a little step to northlong course
and many wide windings between you and Mainz or Frankfurt not to speak
of Rotterdam and the ultimate Dutch swamps

At Bamberg why should a Prussian Majesty linger except for picturesque
or for mere baiting purposes At Bamberg are certain fat Catholic
Canons in indolent opulent circumstances and a couple of sublime
Palaces without any Bishop in them at present Nor indeed does one much
want Papist Bishops wherever they get their pallium of them as well
keep to windward thinks his Majesty And indeed there is no Bishop
here The present Bishop of Bambergone of those Von Schonborns
Counts sometimes Cardinals common in that fat Officeis a Kaisers
Minister of State lives at Vienna enveloped in red tape as well as
red hat and stockings and needs no exhortation in the Kaisers favor
Let us yoke again and goFir woods all round and dead malefactors
blackening in the wind this latter point I know of the then Bamberg
and have explanation of it Namely that the PrinceBishop though a
humane Catholic is obliged to act so His small Domain borders on some
six or seven bigger sovereignties and being Ecclesiastical is made
a cesspool to the neighboring scoundrelism which state of things this
Prince Bishop has said shall cease Young Friedrich may look therefore
and old Friedrich Wilhelm and Suite and make of it what they can

Bamberg through Erlangen to Nurnberg so runs the way At Erlangen
there loiters now recruiting a certain Rittmeister von Katte cousin
to our Potsdam Lieutenant and confidant to him this transit of the
Majesty and CrownPrince must be an event like few in that stagnant
place French Refugees are in Erlangen busy building new straight
streets no University as yetnay a high Dowager of Baireuth is in it
somewhat exuberant Lady friend Weissenfelss Sister on whom Friedrich
Wilhelm must call in passing This high Widow of Baireuth is not Mother
of the present HeirApparent there who will wed our Wilhelmina one
dayah no his Mother was DIVORCED for weighty reasonsHubner t
181 and his Father yet lives in the single state a comparatively
prosperous gentleman these four years last past Successor since
four years past of this Ladys Husband who was his Cousingerman
Dreadfully poor before that the present Margraf of Baireuth as we once
explained but now things are looking up with him again some jingle
of money heard in the coffers of the man and his eldest Prince a fine
young fellow only apt to stammer a little when agitated is at present
doing the return part of the Grand Tourcoming home by Geneva they
say

Rittmeister von Katte I doubt not witnesses this transit of the
incognito Majesty this call upon the exuberant Dowager but can have
little to say to it he I hope he is getting tall recruits here in
the Reich that will be the useful point for him He is our Lieutenant
Kattes Cousin an elder and wiser man than the Lieutenant A
Reichsgrafs and Fieldmarshals nephew he ought to get advanced in his
professionand can hope to do so when he has deserved it not sooner
at all in that thricefortunate Country Let the Rittmeister here keep
himself well apart from what is NOT his business and look out for tall
men

Bamberg is halfwayhouse between Coburg and Nurnberg whole distance of
Coburg and Nurnbergsay a hundred and odd milesis only a fair days
driving for a rapid King And at Nurnberg surely we must lodge for a
night and portion of a day if not for more On the morrow it is but
a thirtyfive miles drive to Anspach pleasant in the summer evening
after all the sights in this old Nurnberg city of the Noricans
NORICORUM BURGUN Trading Staple of the German world in old days
Toyshop of the German world in these new Albert Durers and Hans
Sachs Citymortals infinitely indifferent to Friedrich Wilhelm But
is it not the seedground of the Hohenzollerns this Nurnberg memorable
above cities to a Prussian Majesty Yes there in that old white Castle
now very peaceable they dwelt considerably liable to bickerings and
mutinous heats and needed all their skill and strength to keep
matters straight It is now upon seven hundred years since the Cadet of
Hohenzollern gave his hawk the slip patted his dog for the last time
and came down from the RoughAlp countries hitherward And found favor
not unmerited I fancy with the great Kaiser Redbeard and the fair
Heiress of the Vohburgs and in fact with the Earth and with the
Heavens in some degree A loyal clever and gallant kind of young
fellow if your Majesty will think Much has grown and waned since that
time but the Hohenzollerns ever since are on the waxing handunless
this accursed Treaty of Seville and these English Matches put a stop to
them

Alas it is not likely Friedrich Wilhelm in the hurry and grating whirl
of things had many poetic thoughts in him or pious aurora memories
from the Past Ages instead of grumbly dusty provocations from the
presenthis feeling haste mainly and need of getting through The
very CrownPrince I should guess was as good as indifferent to this
antique Cadet of the Hohenzollerns and looked on Nurnberg and the old
white Castle with little but ENNUI the Princess of England and black
cares on her beautiful account and his own possess him too exclusively
But in truth we do not even know what day they arrived or departed
much less what they did or felt in that old City We know only that the
pleasant little town of Anspach with its huge unfinished SCHLOSS
lay fiveandthirty miles away and that thither was the next and
quasifinal bit of driving Southwestward thirtyfive miles through
fine summer hills and dales climbing always gently on the southward
hand still drained by the Mayn River by the Regnitz and other
tributaries of the Maynhalfway is Heilsbronn Not Heilbronn
the wellknown much larger Town in Wurtemberg 80 or 100 miles to
westward Both names which are applied to still other places signify
HEALTHWELL or even HOLYWELLthese two words HEALTHY and HOLY what
is very remarkable being the same in old Teutonic speech with its
old Monastery where the bones of our Hohenzollern Forefathers rest
and Albert Achilless skull with no sutures visible On the gloomy
Churchwalls their memorials are still legible as for the Monastery
itself Margraf George tour memorable Reformation friend abolished
thatpurged the monks away and put Schoolmasters in their stead
who were long of good renown in those parts but have since gone to
Erlangen so to speak The July sunset streaming over those old spires
of Heilsbronn might awaken thoughts in a Prussian Majesty were he not
in such haste

At Anspach what a thricehospitable youthfully joyful welcome from
the young married couple there Margravine Frederika is still not quite
sixteen beautiful as Day and rather foolish fancy her joy at sight
of Papas Majesty and Brother Fritz and how she dances about and
perhaps bakes pastries of the finest Anspach flour Ah DID you send
me Berlin sausages then you untrue Papa Well I will bake for you
wont ISarah herself not more loyally whom we read of in GENESIS
that time the Angels entered HER tent in a hungry condition

Anspach as we hint has an unfinished Palace of a size that might
better beseem Paris or London Palace begun by former Margraves left
off once and again for want of cash stands there as a sad monument
of several thingsthe young family living meanwhile in some solid
comfortable wing or adjacent edifice of natural dimensions They are
so young as we say and not too wise By and by they had a son and
then a second son which latter came to manhood to old age and made
some noise in the foolish parts of the Newspaperswinding up
finally at Hammersmith as we often explainand was the last of the
AnspachBaireuth Margraves I have heard farther that Frederika did
not want for temper as the Hohenzollerns seldom do that her Husband
likewise had his own stock of it rather scant of wisdom withal and
that their life was not quite symphonious alwaysespecially cash being
short The Dowager Margravine Margrafs Mother had governed with great
prudence during her Sons long minority I think she is now since the
marriage gone to reside at her WITTWENSITZ DowagerSeat of Feuchtwang
twenty miles southwest of us but may have come up to welcome the
Majesties into these parts Very beautiful I hear still almost young
and charming though there is a mortal malady upon her which she knows
of Pollnitz _Memoirs and Letters_ i 209 date 29th September
1729needs WATCHING before believing Here are certain Seckendorfs
too this is the Feldzeugmeisters native countryand there are
resources for a Royal TravellingParty How long the Royal Party
stayed at Anspach I do not know nor what they did thereexcept that
CrownPrince Friedrich is said to have privately asked the young
Margraf to lend him a pair of ridinghorses and say nothing of it
who suspecting something wrong was obliged to make protestations and
refuse

As to the CrownPrince there is no doubt but here at last things are
actually coming to a crisis with him To say truth it has been the
young mans fixed purpose ever since he entered on this Journey nay
was ever since that ignominy in the Camp of Radewitz to run awayand
indeed all this while he has measures going on with Katte at Berlin of
the nowornever sort Rash young creatures elder of them hardly above
fiveandtwenty yet not good at contriving measures But what then
Human nature cannot stand this always and it is time there were an end
of deliberating Can we ever have such a chance againWhat I find of
certain concerning Friedrich while at Anspach is That there comes by
way of Erlangen guided forward from that place by the Rittmeister von
Katte a certain messenger and message which proved of deep importance
to his Royal Highness The messenger was Lieutenant Kattes servant who
has come express from Berlin hither He inquired on the road as he was
bidden at Erlangen of Masters Cousin the experienced Rittmeister
Where his Royal Highness at present was that he might deliver a Letter
to him The Masters Cousin who answered naturally At Anspach knew
nothing and naturally could get to know nothing of what the message
in this Letter was But he judged from crossquestionings added to dim
whispering rumors he had heard that it was questionable probably in
an extreme degree Wherefore along with his Cousin the Lieutenants
messenger to Anspach the Rittmeister forwarded a Note of his own to
LieutenantColonel Rochow of this purport As a friend I warn you
have a watchful eye on your high chargeand for his own share
determined to let nothing escape him in his corner of the matter This
note to Rochow and the Berlin Letter for the CrownPrince reach Anspach
by the same hand Lieutenant Kattes express conscious of nothing
delivering them both Rochow and the Rittmeister though the poor Prince
does not know it are broad awake to all movements he and the rash
Lieutenant may make

Lieutenant Katte in this Letter now arrived complains That he never
yet can get recruiting furlough whether it be by accident or that
Rochow has given my Colonel a hint no furlough yet to be had will
at worst come without furlough and in spite of all men and things
whenever wanted OnlyWesel still if I might advise This is the
substance of Kattes message by express Date must be the end of July
1730 but neither Date nor Letter is now anywhere producible except
from Hearsay

Deeply pondering these things what shall the poor Prince do From
Canstatt close by Stuttgard a Town on our homeward routefrom
Canstatt where Katte was to appear in disguise had the furlough been
got one might have slipt away across the Hills It is but eighty miles
to Strasburg through the Kniebiss Pass where the Murg the Kinzig and
the intricate winding mountain streams and valleys start Rhineward
a labyrinthic rockandforest country where pursuit or tracking were
impossible Near by Strasburg is Count Rothenburgs Chateau good
Rothenburg long Minister in Berlinwho saw those PROFOSSEN or
ScavengerExecutioners in French Costume long since and was always good
to memight not that be a method Lieutenant Keith indeed is in Wesel
waiting only a signal Suppose he went to the Hague and took soundings
there what welcome we should have No not till we have actually run
beware of making noiseThe poor Prince is in unutterable perplexity
can only answer Katte by that Messenger of his to the effect date and
Letter burnt like the former Doubt is on every hand doubtand yet
CERTAINTY Will write again before undertaking anything

And there is no question he did write again more than once letters by
the post which his faithful Lieutenant Katte in Berlin received one
of which however stuck on the road and this oneby some industry of
postmasters spirited into vigilance as is likeliest though others say
by mere misaddressing by want of BERLIN on the addressfell into
the hands of vigilant RITTMEISTER Katte at Erlangen Who grew pale in
reading it and had to resolve on a painful thing This was I suppose
among the last Letters of the series and must have been dated as I
guess about the 29th of July 1730 but they are now all burnt huddled
rapidly into annihilation and one cannot say

Certain it is that the Royal TravellingParty left Anspach in a
few days to go southward still by the OEttingen Country towards
Augsburg Fassmann p 410 Feuchtwang WET Wang not Durrwang or DRY
Wang is the first stage here lives the Dowager Margravine of Anspach
here the Prince does some inconceivably small fault lets a knife which
he is handing to or from the Serene Lady fall Ranke i 304 from
a Letter the Prince had written to Katte who as she is weak may
suffer by the jingle for which Friedrich Wilhelm bursts out on him like
the Irish Rebellionto the silent despair of the poor Prince The poor
Prince meditates desperate resolutions but has to keep them strictly to
himself

Doubtless the Buddenbrock Trio good old military gentlemen would
endeavor to speak comfort to him when they were on the road again
Here is Nordlingen your Highness where Bernhard of Weimar for his
overhaste got so beaten in the ThirtyYears War would not wait till
the Swedes were rightly gathered what general if he have reinforcement
at hand would not wait for it The waters now you observe run all
into the Wornitz into the Donau it is a famed warcountry this known
to me well in my young EugeneMarlborough daysHm Ha yes For
the Prince is preoccupied with black cares and thinks Blenheim and the
Schellenberg businesses befell long since and were perhaps simple to
what he has now on hand That Feuchtwang scene it would appear has
brought him to a resolution There is a young page Keith of the party
Lieutenant Keith of Wesels Brother of this page Keith who is often
busy about horses he cautiously makes question What help may be in
him A willing mind traceable in this poor lad but his terrors great

To Donauworth from Anspach through Feuchtwang and Nordlingen is some
seventy or eighty miles At Donauworth one surely ought to lodge and
see the Schellenberg on the morrow nay drive to the Field of Hochstadt
Blenheim BLINDHEIM which is but a few miles farther up the River
Buddenbrock was there and AnhaltDessau for their very sake were
there nothing farther one surely ought to go Such was the probability
a visit to Blenheim field in passing And surely somewhere in those
heartrending masses of Historical Rubbish I did at last find express
evanescent mention of the factbut cannot now say wherethe exact
record or conceivable image of which would have been a perceptible
pleasure to us Alas in those dim dreary Books all whirling dismal
round ones soul like vortices of dim Brandenburg sand how should
anything human be searched out and mentioned to us and a thousand
things nothuman be searched out and eternally suppressed from us for
the sake of that I please myself figuring young Friedrich looking at
the vestiges of Marlborough even in a preoccupied uncertain manner
Your Majesty too this is the very Schellenberg or JINGLEHILL this
Hill we are now skirting on highways on swift wheels which overhangs
Donauworth our restingplace this hot July evening Yes your Majesty
here was a feat of storming donepang pangsuch a noise as never
jingled on that Hill before like Doomsday come and a herohead to rule
the Doomsday and turn it to heroic marching music A very pretty
feat of war your Majesty His Majesty well knows it feat of his
Marlboroughs doing famed everywhere for the twentysix years last
past and will go to see the Schellenberg and its Lines The great Duke
is dead four years sank sadly eclipsed under tears of dotage of his
own and under human stupidity of other mens But Buddenbrock is still
living AnhaltDessau and others of us are still alive a little while

Hochstadt itselfBlenheim as the English call it meaning BLINDHEIM
the other village on the Fieldis but a short way up the River well
worth such a detour By what way they drove to the field of honor and
back from it I do not know But there northward towards the heights
is the little wood where AnhaltDessau stood at bay like a Molossian
dog of consummate military knowledge and saved the fight in Eugenes
quarter of it That is visible enough and worth looking at Visible
enough the rolling Donau Marlboroughs place the narrow ground the
bordering Hills all green at this seasonand down old Buddenbrocks
cheek end Anhalts there would roll an iron tear or two Augsburg is
but some thirty miles off once we are across the Donauby the Bridge
of Donauworth or the Ferry of Hochstadtswift travellers in a long
day the last of July are soon enough at Augsburg

As for Friedrich haunted and whipt onwards by that scene at Feuchtwang
he is inwardly very busy during this latter part of the route Probably
there is some progress towards gaining Page Keith Lieutenant Keith of
Wesels Brother some hope that Page Keith at the right moment can
be gained the Lieutenant at Wesel is kept duly advised To Lieutenant
Katte at Berlin Friedrich now writes I should judge from Donauworth or
Augsburg That he has had a scene at Feuchtwang that he can stand it
no longer That Canstatt being given up as Katte cannot be there to go
across the Kniebiss with us we will endure till we are near enough
the Rhine Once in the Rhineland in some quiet Town there handy for
Speyer for French Landausay Sinzheim last stage hitherward of
Heidelberg but this we do not writethere might it not be Be
somewhere it shall and must You Katte the instant you hear that
we are off speed you towards the Hague ask for M le Comte
dAlberville you will know that gentleman WHEN you see him Keith
our Wesel friend will have taken the preliminary soundingsand I
tell you Count dAlberville or news of him will be there Bring the
greatcoat with you and the other things especially the 1000 gold
ducats Count dAlberville at the Hague if all have gone rightnay if
anything go wrong cannot he once across the Rhine take refuge in the
convents in those Catholic regions Nobody under the scapulary will
suspect such a heretic as him Speed silence vigilance And so adieu
A letter of such purport Friedrich did write which Letter moreover
the Lieutenant Katte received it was not this it was another that
stuck upon the road and fell into the Rittmeisters hand This is the
young Princes ultimate fixed project brought to birth by that slight
accident of dropping the knife at Feuchtwang Ranke i 304 and
hanging heavy on his mind during this Augsburg drive At Augsburg
furthermore he bought in all privacy red cloth of quantity to make
a topcoat red the gray being unattainable in Kattes hands in all
privacy though the watchful Rochow had full knowledge of it all the
same




Chapter VI  JOURNEY HOMEWARDS FROM THE REICH CATASTROPHE ON JOURNEY
HOMEWARDS

The travelling Majesty of Prussia went diligently up and down
investigating ancient Augsburg saw I doubt not the FUGGEREI or
ancient Hospice of the Fuggerswho were once Weavers in those parts
and are now Princes and were known to entertain Charles V with
fires of cinnamon nay with transient flames of Bankbills on one
old occasion Saw all the Fuggeries I doubt not the ancient
LutherandMelanchthon relics DietHalls and notabilities of this
renowned Free Townperhaps remembered Margraf George and loudvoiced
Kurfurst Joachim with the Bottlenose our DIRECT Ancestor though
mistaken in opinion on some points who were once so audible there

One passing phenomenon we expressly know he saw a human not a
historically important one Driving through the streets from place to
place his Majesty came athwart some questionable quaint procession
ribbony perhaps musical Majesty questioned it A wedding procession
your MajestyWill the Bride step out then and let us see how she
is dressed VOM HERZEN GERN will have the honor Bride stept out
with blusheshandsome we will hope Majesty surveyed her on the
streets of Augsburg having a human heart in him and says Fassmann as
if with insidious insinuation is said to have made her a present She
went her way fulfilled her destiny in an anonymous manner Friedrich
Wilhelm loudly named in the world did the like and their two orbits
never intersected againSome fortyfive miles south of Augsburg up
the Wertach River more properly up the Mindel River lies Mindelheim
once a name known in England and in Prussia once the Duke of
Marlboroughs Principality given him by a grateful Kaiser Joseph
taken from him by a necessitous Kaiser Karl Josephs Brother that now
is I know not if his Majesty remembers that transaction now while in
these localities but know well if he does he must think it a shabby
one

On the same day 1st August 1730 we quit Augsburg set out
fairly homewards again The route bends westward this time towards
FrankfurtonMayn there yachts are to be ready and mere sailing
thenceforth gallantly down the Rhinestreamsuch a yachtvoyage in
the summer weather with no Tourists yet infesting itto end happily
we will hope at Wesel in the review of regiments and other business
First stage first pause is to be at Ludwigsburg and the wicked old
Duke of Wurtembergs thither first from Augsburg We cross the Donau at
Dillingen at Gunzberg or I know not where and by tomorrows sunset
being rapid travellers find ourselves at Ludwigsburgclear through
Canstatt Stuttgard and certainly no Katte waiting there Safe across
the intermediate uplands here are we fairly in the Neckar Country in
the Basin of the Rhine again and old Duke Eberhard Ludwig of Wurtemberg
bidding us kindly welcome poor old bewildered creature who has become
the talk of Germany in those times Will English readers consent to a
momentary glance into his affairs and him Strange things are going on
at Lndwigsburg nay the origin of Ludwigsburg and that the Duke should
be there and not at Stuttgard is itself strange Let us take this
Excerpt headed LUDWIGSBURG in 1730 and then hasten on

LUDWIGSBURG IN 1730

Duke Eberhard Ludwig now an elderly gentleman of fiftyfour has
distinguished himself in his long reign not by political obliquities
and obstinacies though those also were not wanting but by
matrimonial and amatory which have rendered him conspicuous to his
fellowscreatures and still keep him mentionable in History briefly
and for a sad reason Duke Eberhard Ludwig was duly wedded to an
irreproachable Princess of BadenDurlach Johanna Elizabeth upwards
of thirty years ago and he duly produced one Son in consequence
with other good results to himself and her But in course of time Duke
Eberhard Ludwig took to consorting with bad creatures took in fact
to swashing about at random in the pool of amatory iniquity as if there
had been no law known or of the least validity in that matter

Perceiving which a certain young fellow Gravenitz by name who had
come to him from the Mecklenbnrg regions by way of pushing fortune and
had got some pageship or the like here in Wurtemberg recollected that
he had a young Sister at home pretty and artful who perhaps might do a
stroke of work here He sends for the young Sister very pretty indeed
and a gentlewoman by birth though penniless He borrows clothes for her
by onerous contract with the haberdashers it is said being poor to
a degree he easily gets her introduced to the Ducal Soirees bids
herShe knows what to do Right well she knows what catches with her
piquant face the dull eye of Eberhard Ludwig kindles Eberhard Ludwig
and will not for something quench him Not she at all How can SHE your
Serene Highness ask her not A virtuous young lady she and come of
a stainless FamilyIn brief she hooks she of all the fishes in the
pool this lumber of a Duke enchants him keeps him hooked and has
made such a pennyworth of him for the last twenty years and more as
Germany cannot match Michaelis iii 440 Her brother Gravenitz the
page has become Count Gravenitz the prime minister or chief of the
Governing Cabal she Countess Gravenitz and Autocrat of Wurtemberg
Loaded with wealth with socalled honors she and hers there go they
flaunting skyhigh none else admitted to more than the liberty of
breathing in silence in this Duchythe poor Duke Eberhard Ludwig
making no complaint obedient as a child to the bidding of his
Gravenitz He is become a mere enchanted simulacrum of a Duke bewitched
under worse than Thessalian spells without faculty of willing except
as she wills his People and he the plaything of this Circe or Hecate
that has got hold of him So it has lasted for above twenty years
Gravenitz has become the wonder of Germany and requires on these
bad grounds a slight mention in Human History for some time to
come Certainly it is by the Gravenitz alone that Eberhard Ludwig is
remembered and yet down since Ulrich with the Thumb Ulricus POLLEX
right thumb bigger than left died AD 1265 Michaelis iii 262
which of those serene abstruse Beutelsbachers always an abstruse
obstinate set has so fixed himself in your memory

Most persons in Wurtemberg for quiets sake have complied with the
Gravenitz though not without protest and sometimes spoken protest
Thus the Right Reverend Osiander let us name Osiander Head of the
Church in Wurtemberg flatly refused to have her name inserted in the
Public Prayers Is not she already prayed for said Osiander Do we
not say DELIVER US FROM EVIL said the indignant Protestant man And
there is one other person that never will comply with her the lawful
Wife of Eberhard Ludwig Serene Lady she has had a sad existence of it
the voice of her wrongs audible to little purpose this long while in
Heaven and on Earth But it is not in the power of reward or punishment
to bend her female will in the essential point Divorce your Highness
When _I_ am found guilty yes Till then never your Highness never
never in steady CRESCENDO toneso that his Highness is glad to
escape again and drop the subject On which the Serene Lady again falls
silent Gravenitz in fact hopes always to be wedded with the right
nay were it only with the left hand and this Serene Lady stands like
a fateful monument irremovably in the way The Serene Lady steadily
inhabits her own wing of the Ducal House would not exchange it for
the Palace of Aladdin looks out there upon the grand equipages high
doings impure splendors of her Duke and his Gravenitz with a cleareyed
silence which seems to say more eloquently than words MENE MENE YOU
are weighed In the land of Wurtemberg or under the Sun is no reward
or punishment that can abate this silence Speak of divorce the
answer is as above leave divorce lying there is silence looking forth
cleareyed from that particular wing of the Palace on things which the
gods permit for a time

Cleareyed silence which as there was no abating of it grew at last
intolerable to the two sinners Let us remove said the Gravenitz
since her Serene Highness will not build a new charming Palacesay
at our Hunting Seat among those pleasant Hills in the Waiblingen
regionand take the Court out thither And they have done so in
these late bad years taking out with them by degrees all the Courtier
Gentry all the RATHS Government Boards public businesses and
building new houses for them there From 1727 to 1730 was this
latter removal A huntinglodge of Eberhard Ludwigs building
and named by him LUGWIGSBURG stood here since 1705 nucleus of the
subsequent palace with its Pheasantries its Favoritas c c The
place had originally been monastic Busching _Erdbeschreibung_ vi
1519 Founding in fact a second Capital for Wurtemberg with what
distress sulky misery and disarrangement to Stuttgard and the old
Capital readers can fancy There it stands that Ludwigsburg the
second Capital of Wurtemberg some ten or twenty miles from Stuttgard
the first a lasting memorial of Circe Gravenitz and her Ludwig Has
not she by her incantations made the stone houses dance out hither
It remains to this day a pleasant town and occasional residence of
sovereignty WAIBLINGEN within an hours ride has got memorability
on other groundswhat reader has not heard of GHIBELLINES meaning
Waiblingens And in another hour up the River you will come to
Beutelsbach itself where Ulrich with the Thumb had his abode better
luck to him and generated this Lover of the Gravenitz and much other
nonsense loud now and then for the last four centuries in the world

There is something of abstruse in all these Beutelsbachers from Ulrich
with the Thumb downwards a mute ennui an inexorable obstinacy a
certain streak of natural gloom which no illumination can abolish
Veracity of all kinds is great in them sullen passive courage plenty
of it active courage rarer articulate intellect defective hence a
strange stiff perversity of conduct visible among them often marring
what wisdom they haveit is the royal stamp of Fate put upon these
men What are called fateful or fated men such as are often seen on the
top places of the world making an indifferent figure there Something
of this I doubt not is concerned in Eberhard Ludwigs fascination and
we shall see other instances farther down in this History

But so for twenty years the absurd Duke transformed into a mere
Porcus by his Circe in that scandalous miraculous manner has lived and
so he still lives And his Serene Wife equally obstinate is living at
Stuttgard happily out of his sight now One Son a weakly man who had
one heir but has now none is her only comfort His Wife is a Prussian
Margravine Friedrich Wilhelms HALFAUNT and cultivates Calvinism in
the Lutheran Country this Husband of hers he too has an abstruse life
not likely to last We need not doubt the Fates are busy and the
evil demons with those poor fellowbeings Nay it is said the Circe is
becoming much of a Hecate now if the bewitched Duke could see it She
is getting haggard beyond the power of rouge her mind any mind she
has more and more filled with spleen malice and the dregs of pride
run sour A disgusting creature testifies one ExOfficial gentleman
once a Hofrath under her but obliged to run for life and invoke free
press in his defence _Apologie de Monsieur Forstner de Breitembourg

LAVEMENT A SES TROUSSES Good Heavens

But here is the august Prussian TravellingParty shove aside your
bewitchments and bewilderments hang a decent screen over many things
Poor Eberhard Ludwig who is infinitely the gentleman bestirs himself
a good deal to welcome old royal friends nor do we hear that the
least thing went awry during this transit of the royalties Field of
Blenheim says your Majesty Ah meFor Eberhard Ludwig knows that
ground stood the WorldBattle there and so much has come and gone
since then Ah me indeed

Friedrich Wilhelm and he have met before this and have much to tell one
another Treaty of Seville by no means their only topic Nay the flood
of cordiality went at length so far that at last Friedrich Wilhelm the
conscientious King came upon the most intimate topics Gravenitz the
Word of God scandal to the Protestant Religion no likely heir to your
Dukedom clear peril to your own soul Is not her Serene Highness an
unexceptionable Lady heroic under sore woes and your wedded Wife above
allMNA and might bring Heirs too only forty come OctoberAh
Duke ah Friend AVISEZ LA FIN Eberhard Ludwig consider the end of
it all we are growing old fellows now The Duke I conceive who was
rather a fat little man blushed blue then red and various colors
at length settling into steady pale as it were indicating anthracitic
whiteheat it is certain he said at length with emphasis I will
And he did so by and by Friedrich Wilhelm sent a messenger to
Stuttgard to do his reverence to the high injured Lady there perhaps to
show her afar off some ray of hope if she could endure Eberhard Ludwig
raised to a whiteheat perceives that in fact he is heartily tired
of this CirceHecate that in fact she has long been an intolerable
nightmare to him could he but have known it

And his Royal Highness the CrownPrince all this while Well yes
his Royal Highness has got a Court Tailor at Ludwigsburg and in all
privacy seen well by Rochow has had the Augsburg red cloth cut into
a fine upper wrappage over coat or roquelaure for himself intending to
use the same before long Thus they severally the Father and the Son
these are their known acts at Ludwigsburg That the Father persuaded
Eberhard Ludwig of the Gravenitz enormity and that the Son got his red
topcoat ready On Thursday 3d of August late in the afternoon as I
perceive they well entertained depart towards Mannheim KurPfalz
Elector Palatine old Karl Philip of the Pfalzs place hope to be
there on the morrow some time if all go well Gloomy much enlightened
Eberhard takes leave of them with abstruse but grateful feelings will
stand by the Kaiser and dismiss that Gravenitz nightmare by the first
opportunity

As accordingly he did Next Summer going on a visit northward
specially to Berlin There for some three weeks till 9th June 1731
with a suite of above fifty persons Fassmann pp 421 422 he left
order that the Gravenitz was to be got out of his sight safe stowed
away before his return Which by the proper officers military certain
of them was accomplishedby fixed bayonets at last and not without
futile demur on the part of the Gravenitz Poor Eberhard Ludwig he
published in the pulpits That he was now minded to lead a better
lifehad time now been left him Same year 1731 November being
come gloomy Eberhard Ludwig lost not unexpectedly his one Sonthe
one Grandson was gone long since The serene steadfast Duchess now had
her Duke again what was left of him but he was fallen into the sere
and yellow leaf in two years more he died childless 31st October
1733 Michaelis iii 441 and his Cousin Karl Alexander an Austrian
Feldmarschall of repute succeeded in Wurtemberg With whom we may
transiently meet in time coming with whom and perhaps less pleasantly
with certain of his children for they continue to this daywith the
old abstruse element still too traceable in them

Old Karl Philip Kurfurst of the Pfalz towards whom Friedrich Wilhelm
is now driving with intent to be there tomorrow evening is not quite
a stranger to readers here and to Friedrich Wilhelm he is much the
reverse perhaps too much This is he who ran away with poor Prince
Sobieskis Bride from Berlin at starting in life who fell upon his own
poor Protestant Heidelbergers and their Church of the Holy Ghost being
himself Papist ever since that slap on the face to his ancestor and
who has been in many quarrels with Friedrich Wilhelm and others A
high expensive sovereign gentleman this old Karl Philip not I should
suppose the pleasantest of men to lodge with One apprehends he
cannot be peculiarly well disposed to Friedrich Wilhelm after that sad
Heidelberg passage of fence twelve or eleven years ago Not to
mention the inextricable JulichandBerg business which is a standing
controversy between them

Poor old Kurfurst he is now within a year of seventy He has had
crosses and losses terrible campaignings against the Turk in old
times and always such a stock of quarrels at home as must have
been still worse to bear A life of perpetual arguing squabbling and
battlingones neighbors being such an unreasonable set Brabbles
about Heidelberg Catechism and Church of the Holy Ghost so that
foreign Kings interfered shaking their whips upon us Then brabbles
about boundaries about inheritances and detached properties very
manyclearly mine were the neighbors reasonable In fact this
sovereign old gentleman has been in the Kaisers courts or even on the
edge of fight oftener than most other men and it is as if that
first adventure of the Sobieski wedding turned topsyturvy had been
symbolical of much that followed in his life

We remember that unpleasant Heidelberg affair how hopeful it once
looked fact DONE Church of the Holy Ghost fairly ours your CORPUS
EVANGELICORUM fallen quasidead and nothing now for it but protocolling
by diplomatists pleading in the Diets by men in bombazine never like
ending at allwhen Friedrich Wilhelm did suddenly end it suddenly
locked up his own Catholic establishments and revenues and quietly
inexorable put the key in his pocket as it were drew his own whip
with a Will you whip MY Jewand we had to cower out of the affair
Kaiser himself ordering us in a most humiliated manner Readers can
judge whether KurPfalz was likely to have a kindly note of Friedrich
Wilhelm in that corner of his memory The poor man felt so disgusted
with Heidelberg he quitted it soon after He would not go to Dusseldorf
in the BergandJulich quarter as his Forefathers used to do but set
up his abode at Mannheim where he still is Friedrich Wilhelm who
was far from meaning harm or insolence in that Heidelberg affair hopes
there is no grudge remaining But so stand the facts it is towards
Mannheim not towards Heidelberg that we are now travellingFor the
rest this scheme of reprisals or whipping your Jew if you whip mine
answered so well Friedrich Wilhelm has used it or threatened to use
as the real method ever since where needful and has saved thereby
much bombazine eloquence and confusion to mankind on several
occasions

But the worst between these two High Gentlemen is that JulichandBerg
controversy which is a sore still running and beyond reach of probable
surgery Old Karl Philip has no male Heir and is like to be what he
indeed proved the last of the NEUBERG Electors Palatine What trouble
there rose with the first of them about that sad business and how the
then Brandenburger much wrought upon smote the then Neuburger across
the very face and drove him into Catholicism we have not forgotten
how can we everIt is one hundred and sixteen years since that
afterdinner scene and O Heavens what bickering and brabbling
and confused negotiation there has been lawyers pens going
almost continually ever since shadowing out the mutual darkness of
sovereignties and from time to time the military implements brandishing
themselves though loath generally to draw blood For a hundred and
sixteen yearsbut the Final Bargain lying on parchment in the
archives of both parties and always acknowledged as final was to
this effect You serene Neuburg keep what you have got we
serene Brandenburg the like Cleve with detached pertinents ours
JulichandBerg mainly yours And let us live in perpetual amity on that
footing And note only furthermore when our Line fails the whole of
these fine Duchies shall be yours if your Line fail ours That was
the plain bargain done solemnly in 1624 and again more solemnly and
brought to parchment with signature in 1666 as Friedrich Wilhelm
knows too well And now the very case is about to occur this old
man childless at seventy is the last of the Neuburgs May not one
reasonably pretend that a bargain should be kept

Tush answers old Karl Philip always Bargain And will not hear
reason against himself on the subject not even when the Kaiser asks
himas the Kaiser really did after that Wusterhausen Treaty but
could get only negatives Karl Philip has no romantic ideas of justice
or of old parchments tying up a man Karl Philip had one Daughter by
that dear Radzivil Princess Sobieskis stolen Bride and he never by
the dear Radzivil or her dear successor See Buchholz i 61 n had
any son or other daughter that lived to wed One Daughter we say
a firstborn extremely precious to him Her he married to the young
fortunate Sulzbach Cousin Karl Joseph HeirApparent of Sulzbach who
by all laws was to succeed in the Pfalz as wellKarl Philip thinking
furthermore He and she please Heaven shall hold fast by Dusseldorf
too and that fine JulichandBerg Territory which is mine Bargains
Such was and is the old mans inflexible notion Alas this one
Daughter died lately and her Husband lately She in 1728 he in 1729
their eldest Daughter was born 1721 Hubner t 140 Michaelis ii 101
123 again leaving only Daughters will not this change the notion
Not a whitthough Friedrich Wilhelm may have fondly hoped it by
possibility might Not a whit Karl Philip cherishes his little
Granddaughter now a child of nine as he did her Mother and her
Mothers Mother hopes one day to see her wedded as he did to a new
HeirApparent of the Pfalz and Sulzbach and for her behoof will hold
fast by Berg and Julich and part with no square inch of it for any
parchment

What is Friedrich Wilhelm to do Seek justice for himself by his 80000
men and the iron ramrods Apparently he will not get it otherwise He is
loath to begin that terrible game If indeed Europe do take fire as
is likely at Seville or elsewhereBut in the meanwhile how happy if
negotiation would but serve Alas and if the Kaiser England Holland
and the others could be brought to guarantee meas indeed they
should to avoid a CASUS BELLI and some of them have said they will
Friedrich Wilhelm tried this JulichandBerg Problem by the pacific
method all his life strenuously and without effect Result perhaps
was coming nevertheless at the distance of another hundred yearsOne
thing I know whatever rectitude and patience whatever courage
perseverance or other human virtue he has put into this or another
matter is not lost not it nor any fraction of it to Friedrich Wilhelm
and his sons sons but will well avail him and them if not soon then
later if not in Berg and Julich then in some other quarter of the
Universe which is a wide Entity and a longlived Courage your
Majesty

So stand matters as Friedrich Wilhelm journeys towards Mannheim human
politeness will have to cloak well and keep well down a good many
prickly points in the visit ahead Alas poor Friedrich Wilhelm has got
other matter to think of by the time we arrive in Mannheim




CATASTROPHE ON JOURNEY HOMEWARDS

The Royal Party quitting Ludwigsburgon Thursday 3d August 1730
some hours after dinner as I calculate ithad but a rather short
journey before them journey to a place called Sinzheim some fifty or
sixty miles a long way short of Heidelberg the Kings purpose being
to lodge in that dilapidated silent Town of Sinzheim and leave both
Heidelberg and Mannheim with their civic noises for the next
days work Sinzheim such was the program as the Prince and others
understood it but by some accident or on better calculation it was
otherwise decided in the royal mind not at Sinzheim intricate decayed
old Town shall we lodge tonight but five or six miles short of it in
the naturally silent Village of Steinfurth where good clean empty Barns
are to be found Which latter is a favorite method of his Majesty fond
always of free air and the absence of fuss Shakedowns a temporary
cooking apparatus plenty of tobacco and a tub to wash in this is
what man requires and this without difficulty can be got His Majestys
tastes are simple simple and yet good and human Here is a small Royal
Order which I read once and ever since rememberthough the reference
is now blown away and lost in those unindexed Sibylline Farragos the
terror of human naturelet us copy it from memory till some deliverer
arise with finger on page Probably in Rodenbecks _Beitrage_but
long sad searching there and elsewhere proves unavailing at present
Historical Farragos without INDEX a hundred or several hundred blind
sacks of Historical clippings generally authentic too if useless and
not the least scrap of LABEL on themare not these a handy article
At Magdeburg on this ReviewJourney have dinner for me under a
certain Tree you know of outside the ramparts Dinner of one
sound portion solid one ditto liquid of the due quality readied

he been travelling on business in those parts have done better with his
dinner

At Sinzheim thinks his Royal Highness and has spoken privily to
the Page Keith To glide out of their quarters there in that waste
negligent old Town where posthorses can be had in the gray of the
summers dawn Across the Rhine to Speyer is but three hours riding
thence to Landau into France into Enough Page Keith has undertaken
to get horses and the flight shall at last be Husht husht Tomorrow
morning before the sparrow wake it is our determination to be upon the
road

Ruins of the Tower of Stauffen HOHEN or High STAUFFEN where Kaiser
Barbarossa lived once young and ruddy and was not yet a MYTH winking
and nodding under the Hill at Salzburgyes it is but a few miles
to the right there were this a deliberate touring party But this is
a rapid driving one knows nothing about Stauffen cares nothingWe
cannot fancy Friedrich remembered Barbarossa at all or much regarded
Heilbronn itself the principal and only famous Town they pass this day

show the old HAND considerably rusted now Heilbronn the most famous
City on the Neckar and its old miraculous Holy Well What cares his
Highness Weinsberg again which is but a few miles to the right of
usthere it was that the Besieged Wives did that astonishing feat
600 years ago coming out as the capitulation bore with their most
valuable property each brought her Husband on her back were not the
fact a little uncertainwhereby the old Castle has to this day the
name WEIBERTREUE Faithfulness of Women Welfs Duchess Husband on
back was at the head of those women a Hohenzollern ancestor of yours
I think I have heard was of the besieging party Siege is notorious
enough AD 1140 Kohler _Reichshistorie_ p 167 who does not
mention the story of the women Menzel Wolfgang _Geschichte der
Deutschen_ p 287 who takes no notice that it is a highly mythical
storysupported only by the testimony of one poor Monk in Koln
vaguely chronicling fifty years after date and at that good distance
Alas thinks his Royal Highness is there not a flower of Welfdom now
in England and I unluckiest of Hohenzollerns still far away from
her here It is at Windsor not in Weinsberg or among the ruins of
WEIBERTREUE that his Highness wishes to be

At Heilbronn our road branches off to the left and we roll diligently
towards Sinzheim calculating to be there before nightfall Whew
Something has gone awry at Sinzheim no right lodging in the waste Inns
there or good clean Barns of a promising character are to be had
nearer than there we absolutely do not go to Sinzheim tonight we are
to stop at Steinfurth a small quiet Hamlet with Barns four or five
miles short of that This was a great disappointment to the Princeand
some say a highly momentous circumstance in his History Might
perhaps have succeeded at Sinzheim Seckendorfs _Relation of the
CrownPrinces meditated Flight_ p 2addressed to Prince Eugene few
days afterwards given in Forster iii 113however he rallies
in the course of the evening speaks again to Page Keith Steinfurth
STONYFORD over the Brook here be it at Steinfurth all the same
Page Keith will manage to get horses for us here no less And Speyer
and the Ferry of the Rhine are within three hours Favor us Silence and
all ye good genii

On Friday morning 4th August 1730 usual hour of starting 3 AM
not being yet came the Royal Party lies asleep in two clean airy Barns
facing one another in the Village of Steinfurth Barns facing one
another with the Heidelberg Highway and Village Green asleep in front
between them Compare Wilhelmina i 259 her Account of the Flight
Heard it from my Brotherand report it loosely after a dozen
years for it is little after two in the morning the dawn hardly
beginning to break Prince Friedrich with his Trio of Vigilance
Buddenbrock Waldau Rochow lies in one Barn Majesty with his
Seckendorf and party is in the other apparently all still locked in
sleep Not all Prince Friedrich for example is awakethe Trio is
indeed audibly asleep unless others watch for them their six eyes are
closed Friedrich cautiously rises dresses takes his money his new
red roquelaure unbolts the Barndoor and walks out Trio of Vigilance
is sound asleep and knows nothing alas Trio of Vigilance while its
own six eyes are closed has appointed another pair to watch

Gummersbach the Valet comes to Rochows bolster Hst Herr
OberstLieutenant please awaken Prince Royal is up has on his
topcoat and is gone out of doors Rochow starts to his habiliments
or perhaps has them ready on in a minute or two Rochow also is forth
into the gray of the morningfinds the young Prince actually on the
Green there in his red roquelaure leaning pensively on one of the
travelling carriages _Guten Morgen Ihro Konigliche Hoheit_ Ranke
1 305Fancy such a salutation to the young man Page Keith at
this moment comes with a pair of horses too Whither with the nags
Sirrah Rochow asked with some sharpness Keith seeing how it was
answered without visible embarrassment Herr they are mine and Kunz
the Pages horses which I suppose is true ready at the usual
hour Keith might addHis Majesty does not go till five this
morningback to the stables beckoned Rochow and according to the
best accounts did not suspect anything or affected not to do so

Page Keith returned trembling in his saddle Friedrich strolled towards
the other Barnat least to be out of Rochows company Seckendorf
emerges from the other Barn awake at the common hour How do you like
his Royal Highness in the red roquelaure asks Rochow as if nothing
had happened Was there ever such a baffled Royal Highness or young
bright spirit chained in the Bears Den in this manner Our Steinfurth
project has gone to water and it is not today we shall get across the
RhineNot today nor any other day on that errand strong as our
resolutions are For new light in a few hours afterwards pours in
upon the project and human finesse or ulterior schemes avail nothing
henceforth The CrownPrinces meditated Flight has tried itself and
failed Here and so that long meditation ENDS this at Steinfurth was
all the overact it could ever come to In few hours more it will melt
into air and only the terrible consequences will remain

By last nights arrangement the Prince with his Trio was to set out an
hour before his Father which circumstance had helped Page Keith in his
excuses Naturally the Prince had now no wish to linger on the Green of
Steinfurth in such a posture of affairs Towards Heidelberg then let
us see the big Tun there ALLONS How the young Prince and his Trio did
this days journey where he loitered what he saw said or thought we
have no account it is certain only that his Father who set out from
Steinfurth an hour after him arrived in Mannheim several hours before
him and in spite of Kurfurst Karl Philips welcome testified the
liveliest inquietude on that unaccountable circumstance Beautiful
Rhinestream thricebeautiful trim Mannheimyes all is beautiful
indeed your Serenity But where can the Prince be he kept ejaculating
And Karl Philip had to answer what he could Of course the Prince may
be lingering about Heidelberg looking at the big Tun and other
miraclesI had the pleasure to repair that worldfamous Tub or Tun
as your Majesty knows which had lain half burnt ever since Louis XIV
with his firebrand robberies lay upon us and burnt the Pfalz in whole
small honor to him I repaired the Tun Kohler _Munzbelustigungen_
viii 418424 145152 who gives a view of the worlds wonder lying
horizontal with stairs running up to it Big Tuns of that kind were not
uncommon in Germany and had uses if multiplex dues of wine were to
be paid IN NATURA the Heidelberg the biggest of them is small to the
WhitbreadandCompany for portersale in our time it is probably
the successfulest feat I did hitherto and well worth looking at had
your Majesty had timeJA WOHLbut he came away an hour before
meThe polite Karl Philip at length sent off one of his own
Equerries to ride towards Heidelberg or even to Steinfurth if needful
and see what was become of the Prince This Official person met the
Prince all in order at no great distance and brought him safe to
Papas presence again

Why Papa was in such a fuss about this little circumstance Truly there
has something come to Papas knowledge since he started perhaps since
he arrived at Mannheim Page Keith who rides always behind the Kings
coach has ridden this day in an agony of remorse and terror and at
length probably in Mannheim once his Majesty is got to his Apartments
or now that he finds his Majesty so anxious there has fallen on his
knees and with tears and obtestations made a clean breast Page Keith
has confessed that the CrownPrince and he were to have been in Speyer
or farther at this time of the day flying rapidly into France Gods
Providence alone prevented it Pardon pardon slay me your Majesty
but there is the naked truth and the whole of it and I have nothing
more to say Hereupon ensues despatch of the Equerry and hereupon as
we may conjecture the Equerrys return with Fritz and the Trio is an
unspeakable relief to Friedrich Wilhelm

Friedrich Wilhelm now summons Buddenbrock and Company straightway
shows in a suppressedvolcanic manner with questions and
statementsobliged to SUPPRESS oneself in foreign hospitable Serene
Houseswhat atrocity of scandal and terror has been on the edge of
happening And you three Rochow Waldau Buddenbrock mark it you
three are responsible and shall answer I now tell you with your
heads Death the penalty unless you bring HIM to our own Country
againliving or dead added the SuppressedVolcano in low
metallic tone and the sparkling eyes of him the red tint and rustling
gestures make the words too credible to us Ranke i 307

What Friedrich Wilhelm got to speak about with the old KurPfalz during
their serene passages of hospitality at Mannheim is not very clear to
me his Prussian Majesty is privately in such a desperate humor and
the old KurPfalz privately so discrepant on all manner of points
especially on the JulichandBerg point They could talk freely about
the old Turk Campaigns Battle of Zentha 11th September 1697
Eugenes crowning featbreaking of the Grand Turks back in this
world who has staggered about less and less of a terror and outrage
more and more of a nuisance growing unbearable ever since that day
See Hormayr iii 97101 for some description of this useful bit of
Heroism and Prince Eugene very freely about the Heidelberg Tun But
it is known old Karl Philip had his agents at the Congress of Soissons
to secure that BergandJulich interest for the Sulzbachs and him
directly in the teeth of Friedrich Wilhelm How that may have gone
since the Treaty of Seville broke out to astonish mankindwill be
unsafe to talk about For the rest old Karl Philip has frankly adopted
the Pragmatic Sanction but then he has likewise privately made league
with France to secure him in that JulichandBerg matter should the
Kaiser break promiseleague which may much obstruct said Sanction
Nay privately he is casting glances on his Bavarian Cousin elegant
ambitious Karl Albert Kurfurst of Baiernare not we all from the same
Wittelsbach stock Cousins from of oldand will undertake for the
same JulichandBergobject to secure Bavaria in its claims on the
Austrian Heritages in defect of Heirs Male in Austria Michaelis ii
99101 Which runs directly into the throat of said Pragmatic Sanction
and engages to make it mere waste sheepskin so to speak Truly old
Karl Philip has his abstruse outlooks this way that way most abstruse
politics altogetherand in fact we had better speak of the Battle of
Zentha and the Heidelberg Tun while this Visit lasts

On the morrow Saturday August 5th certain Frenchmen from the Garrison
of Landau come across to pay their court and dine Which race of men
Friedrich Wilhelm does not love and now less than ever gloomily
suspicious they may be come on parricide Fritzs scoreyou Rochow
and Company keep an eye By night and by day an eye upon him Friedrich
Wilhelm was no doubt glad to get away on the morrow afternoon fairly
out into the BergStrasse into the summer breezes and umbrageous woods
with all his pertinents still safe about him rushing towards Darmstadt
through the Sunday stillness where he will arrive in the evening
time enough Sunday Evening arrive at Darmstadt says Seckendorf in
Forster iii 3 but by mistake calls it the 7th instead of 6th

The old Prince of Darmstadt Ernst Ludwig Landgraf of HessenDarmstadt
age now sixtythree has a hoary venerable appearance according to
Pollnitz but sits a horse well walks well and seems to enjoy perfect
healthwhich we are glad to hear of What more concerns us he
lives usually quite retired in a small house upon the Square in
this extremely small Metropolis of his and leaves his HeirApparent
to manage all business in the Palace and elsewhere Pollnitz _Memoirs
and Letters_ ii 66 poor old Gentleman he has the biggest Palace
almost in the world only he could not finish it for want of funds and
it lies there one of the biggest futilities vexatious to look upon
No doubt the old Gentleman has had vexations plenty of them first
and last He is now got disgusted with the affairs of public life
and addicts himself very much to turning ivory as the more
eligible employment He lives in that small house of his among his
turninglathes and ivory shavings dines in said small house at a
table for four persons only on Sunday and above all on this Sunday
puts off his apron goes across to the Palace dines there in state
with his Heir and the Grandees He has a kinship by affinity to
Friedrich Wilhelm his Wife dead long years since Mother of this
HeirApparent was an Anspach Princess Aunt to the now Queen Caroline
of England Poor old fellow these insignificancies and that he
descends direct from Philip the Magnanimous of Hessen Luthers Philip
who insisted on the supplementary Wife are all I know of him and he
is somewhat tragic to me there turning ivory in this extremely anarchic
world What the passages between him and Friedrich Wilhelm were on this
occasion shall remain conjectural to all creatures Friedrich Wilhelm
said this Sunday evening at Darmstadt to his own Prince Still here
then I thought you would have been in Paris by this timeTo which
the Prince with artificial firmness answered He could certainly if
he had wished Seckendorf in Forster iii p 3 and being familiar
with reproaches perhaps hoped it was nothing

From Darmstadt to FrankfurtonMayn is not quite forty miles an easy
morning drive through the old Country called of Katzenellenbogen
CATSELBOW a name ridiculous to hear CATTIMELIBOCUM that is
CATTUMMELIBOCUM CATTI a famed Nation MELIBOCUS the chief Hill or
Fortress of their Country is said to be the originalwhich has got
changed like ABALLABA into Appleby or GOD ENCOMPASS US into The
Goat and Compasses among ourselves BergStrasse and the Odenwald
FOREST of the OTTI are gone but blue on the northeast yonder if your
Royal Highness will please to look may be seen summits of the SPESSART
a much grander foresttall branchy timbers yonder one day to be masts
of admirals when floated down as far as Rotterdam whitherward one
still meets them going Spessartand nearer well hidden on the right
is an obscure village called DETTINGEN not yet become famous in the
Newspapers of an idle world of an England surely very idle to go
thither seeking quarrels All which is naturally in the highest degree
indifferent to a CrownPrince so preoccupiedThey reach Frankfurt
Monday still in good time

Behold at Frankfurt the Trio of Vigilance Buddenbrock and Company
horrible to think of signify That we have the Kings express orders
Not to enter the Town at all with your Royal Highness We for our part
are to go direct into one of the Royal Yachts which swing at anchor
here and to wait in the same till his Majesty have done seeing
Frankfurt and return to us Here is a message for the poor young
Prince Detected prisoner and a volcanic Majesty now likely to be in
full play when he returnsGilt weathercock on the Mayn Bridge which
one Goethe used to look at in the next generationthis and the
steepletops of Frankfurt especially that steepletop with the grinning
skull of the mutinous malefactor on it warning to mankind what mutiny
leads to this then is what we are to see of Frankfurt and with such
a symphony as our thoughts are playing in the background Unhappy Son
unhappy Father once more

Nay Friedrich Wilhelm got new lights in Frankfurt Rittmeister Katte
had an estafette waiting for him there Estafette with a certain Letter
which the Rittmeister had picked up in Erlangen and has shot across by
estafette to wait his Majesty here Majesty has read with open eyes
and throat Letter from the CrownPrince to Lieutenant Katte in Berlin
treasonous Flightproject now indisputable as the sun at noonHis
Majesty stept on board the Yacht in such humor as was never seen
before Detestable rebel and deserter scandal of scandalsit is
confidently written everywhere though Seckendorf diplomatically keeps
silence his Majesty hustled and tussled the unfortunate CrownPrince
poked the handle of his cane into his face and made the nose
bleedNever did a Brandenburg face suffer the like of this cried
the poor Prince driven to the edge of mad ignition and one knows not
what when the Buddenbrocks at whatever peril interfered got the
Prince brought on board a different Yacht and the conflagration
moderated for the moment The Yachts get under way towards Mainz and
down the Rhinestream The Yachts glide swiftly on the favoring current
taking advantage of what wind there may be were we once ashore at Wesel
in our own countrywait till then thinks his Majesty

And so it was on these terms that Friedrich made his first acquaintance
with the beauties of the Rhinereaders can judge whether he was in
a temper very open to the picturesque I know not that they paused at
Mainz or recollected Barbarossas WorldTournament or the Hochheim
vineyards at all I see the young mans Yacht dashing in swift gallop
not without danger through the Gap of Bingen dancing wildly on the
boiling whirlpools of St Goar well threading the cliffsthe young
man gloomily insensible to danger of life and charm of the picturesque
Coblenz CONFLUENTIA the Moselle and Ehrenbreitstein Majesty smoking
on deck if he like can look at these through grimly pacifying tobacco
but to the CrownPrince life itself is fallen haggard and bankrupt

Over against Coblenz nestled in between the Rhine and the foot of
Ehrenbreitstein Pollnitz _Memoirs and Letters_ iii 180 there
perhaps even now in his Hunting Lodge of Kerlich yonder is his
Serene Highness the fat little Kurfurst of Trier one of those Austrian
Schonborns Brother to him of Bamberg upon whom why should we make a
call We are due at Bonn the fortunate young Kurfurst of Koln richest
Pluralist in the Church expects us at his Residence there Friedrich
Wilhelm views the fine Fortress of Ehrenbreitsteinwhat would your
Majesty think if this were to be yours in a hundred years this and
much else by way of compoundinterest for the BergandJulich and other
outstanding debts Courage your MajestyOn the fat little Kurfurst
at Kerlich here we do not call probably out hunting hunts every
day Busching _Beitrage_ iv 201 as if it were his trade poor
little soul

At Bonn where we do step ashore to lodge with a lean Kurfurst
Friedrich Wilhelm strictly charges in my Seckendorfs hearing the
Trio of Vigilance to have an eye to see that they bring the Prince on
board again LIVING OR DEADNo fear your Majesty Prince listened
with silent almost defiant patience MIT GROSSER GEDULD Seckendorf
in Forster iii 4 At Bonn the Prince contrived to confide to
Seckendorf That he had in very truth meant to run away he could not
at the age he was come to stand such indignities actual strokes as
in the Camp of Radewitzand he would have gone long since had it
not been for the Queen and the Princess his Sisters sake He could not
repent what he had done and if the King did not cease beating him in
that manner c he would still do it For loss of his own life such a
life as his had grown he cared little his chief misery was that those
Officers who had known of the thing should come to misfortune by his
means If the King would pardon these poor gentlemen he would tell
him everything For the rest begged Seckendorf to help him in this
labyrinthnothing could ever so oblige him as help now and more
of the like sort These things he said at Bonn to Seckendorf the
fountain of all his woes Ibid What Seckendorfs reflections on this
his sad handiwork now were we do not know Probably he made none being
a strongminded casehardened old stager but resolved to do what he
could for the poor youth Somewhere on this route at Bonn more likely
than elsewhere Friedrich wrote in pencil three words to Lieutenant
Keith at Wesel and got it to the PostOffice SAUVEZVOUS TOUT EST
DECOUVERT All is found outaway Wilhelmina i 265 says it was
a Page of the Old Dessauers a comrade of Keiths who having known in
time gave him warning Certain it is this Note of Friedrichs which
the Books generally assign as cause could not have done it infra p
275 and the irrefragable date there

Clement August expensive Kurfurst of Koln Elector of Cologne as we
call it who does the hospitalities here at Bonn in a grand way with
above a hundred and fifty chamberlains for one itemglance at him
reader perhaps we shall meet the man again He is younger Brother of
the elegant ambitious Karl Albert Kurfurst of Bavaria whom we have
transiently heard of sons both of them are of that Elector of Bavaria
who haunts us in the Marlborough Historieswho joined Louis XIV in
the Succession War and got hunted about at such a rate after Blenheim
especially His Boys prisoners of the Kaiser were bred up in a
confiscated state as sons of a mere private gentleman nothing visibly
ahead of them at one time but an obscure and extremely limited destiny
of that kindthough now again on French favor and the turn of
Fortunes inconstant wheel they are mounting very high Bavaria came
all back to the old Elector of Bavaria even Marlboroughs Principality
of MINDELHEIM came At the Peace of Baden corollary to UTRECHT
1714 Elector had been banned GEACHTET solemnly drummed out
1706 nothing but French pay to live upon till he got back died 26th
February 1726 when Karl Albert succeeded Michaelis ii 255
And the present Kurfurst who will not do the Pragmatic Sanction at
allKurfurst Karl Albert of Baiern our old Karl Philip of Mannheims
genealogical Cousinwe heard of abstruse colleaguings there

known to those I knew MNA from father to son and grandson it goes
on and there is no end to trouble and war

His Majestys next lodging is at Mors old gaunt Castle in the Town of
Mors which thanks to Leopold of AnhaltDessau and the Iron Ramrods
is now his Majestys in spite of the Dutch There the lodging is at an
hours drive westward from the Rhineshorewhere his Majesty quitted
the River I do not know nor whether the CrownPrince went to Mors with
him or waited in his Yacht but guess the latter His Majesty intends
for Geldern on the morrow on matters of business thither for the Town
is his but what would the Prince in the present state of things
do thereAt Mors Seckendorf found means to address his Majesty
privately and snuffled into him suggestions of mercy to the repentant
Prince and to the poor Officers whom he was so anxious about Well if
he WILL confess everything and leave off his quirks and concealments
but I know he wont answered Majesty

In that dilapidated Castle of Morslook at it reader though in the
dark we may see it again or the shadow of it perhaps by moonlight
A very gaunt old Castle next to nothing living in it since the old
Dessauer by stratagem and without shot fired flung out the Dutch in
the TreatyofUtrecht time Mors Castle and Territory being indisputably
ours though always withheld from us on pretexts Narrative of the
march thither Night of 7th November 1712 and dexterous surprisal of
the place in _Leopoldi von AnhaltDessau Leben und Thaten_ Anonymous

Commandant himself to their High Mightinesses is given Part of
the Orange Heritage this Morscame by the Great Electors first
Wifebut had hung SUB LITE though the Parchments were plain enough
ever since our King Williams death and earlier Neuchatel accepted
instead of ORANGE and not even of the value of Mors was another item
of the same lot Besides which we shall hear of old Palaces at Loo and
other dilapidated objects incidentally in time coming

At Geldern in the pressure of business next day his Majesty got word
from Wesel that Lieutenant Keith was not now to be found in Wesel
Was last seen there that we can hear of certain hours before your
Majestys Allgracious Order arrived Had saddled his own horse came
ambling through the Brunen Gate going out to have a ride he said
and did not returnKeith gone scandalous Keith whom I pardoned
only few weeks ago he too is in the Plot Will the very Army break
its oath then His Majesty bursts into fire and flame at these new
tidings orders that Colonel Dumoulin our expertest roguetracer go
instantly on the scent of Keith and follow him till found and caught
Also on the other hand that the CrownPrince be constituted prisoner
sail down to Wesel prisoner in his Yacht and await upon the Rhine
there his Majestys arrival Formidable omens it is thought

His Majesty all business done in Geldern drives across to Wesel can
see Fritzs Yacht waiting duly in the River and black Care hovering
over her It is on the evening of the 12th of August 1730 And so his
Majesty ends this memorable Tour into the Reich but has not yet ended
the gloomy miseries for himself and others which plentifully sprung
out of that




Chapter VII  CATASTROPHE AND MAJESTY ARRIVE IN BERLIN

At Berlin dark rumors of this intended flight and actual Arrest of the
CrownPrince are agitating all the world especially Lieutenant Katte
and the Queen and Wilhelmina as we may suppose The first news of
it came tragically on the young Princess Apparently some rumor FROM
FRANKFURT which she confuses in her aftermemory with the specific news
FROM WESEL for her dates here as usual are all awry Wilhelmina i
246 Preuss i 42 iv 473 Seckendorf in Forster iii 6

Mamma had given a ball in honor of Papas BirthdayTuesday 15th
August 1730and we were all dancing in the fine saloons of Monbijou
with pretty intervals in the cool boscages and orangeries of the place
all of us as happy as could be Wilhelmina in particular dancing at an
unusual rate We recommenced the ball after supper For six years I had
not danced before it was new fruit and I took my fill of it without
heeding much what was passing Madame Bulow who with others of them had
worn long faces all night pleading illness when one noticed it said
to me several times It is late I wish you had doneEH MON DIEU
I answered let me have enough of dancing this one new time it may be
long before it comes againThat may well be said she I paid no
regard but continued to divert myself She returned to the charge half
an hour after Will you end then said she with a vexed air you are
so engaged you have eyes for nothingYou are in such a humor
I replied that I know not what to make of itLook at the Queen
then Madam and you will cease to reproach me A glance which I gave
that way filled me with terror There sat the Queen paler than death
in a corner of the room in low conference with Sonsfeld and Countess
Finkenstein As my Brother was most in my anxieties I asked If it
concerned him Bulow shrugged her shoulders answering I dont know
at all A moment after the Queen gave Goodnight and got into her
carriage with mespeaking no word all the way to the Schloss so
that I thought my Brother must be dead and I myself took violent
palpitations and Sonsfeld contrary to orders had at last to tell
me in the course of the night Poor Wilhelmina and poor Mother of
Wilhelmina

The fact of Arrest and unknown mischief to the Prince is taken for
certain but what may be the issues of it who besides the Prince have
been involved in it especially who will be found to have been involved
is matter of dire guess to the three who are most interested here
Lieutenant Katte finds he ought to dispose of the Princes effects which
were intrusted to him of the thousand gold Thalers in particular and
beyond and before all of the locked Writingdesk in which lies the
Princes correspondence the very Queen and Princess likely to be
concerned in it Katte despatches these two objects the Money and the
little Desk in all secrecy to Madam Finkenstein as to the surest
hand with a short Note shadowing out what he thinks they are Countess
Finkenstein old General von Finkensteins Wife and a second mother to
the Prince she like her Husband a sworn partisan of the Prince and
his Mother shall do with these precious and terrible objects what to
her own wise judgment seems best

Madam Finkenstein carries them at once in deep silence to the Queen
Huge dismay on the part of the Queen and Princess They know too well
what Letters may be there and there is a seal on the Desk and no key
to it neither must it in time coming seem to have been opened even
if we could now open it A desperate pinch and it must be solved
Female wit and Wilhelmina did solve it by some preeminently acute
device of their despair Wilhelmina i 253257 and contrived to get
the Letters out hundreds of Letters enough to be our death if read
says Wilhelmina These Letters they burnt and set to writing fast as
the pen would go other letters in their stead Fancy the mood of these
two Royal Women and the black whirlwind they were in Wilhelminas
despatch was incredible pen went at the gallop night and day new
letters of old dates and of no meaning are got into the Desk again
the Desk closed without mark of injury and shoved aside while it is
yet timeTime presses his Majesty too and the events go at gallop
Here is a Letter from his Majesty to a trusty Mistress of the Robes
or whatever she is which let it arrive through what softening media it
likes will complete the poor Queens despair

MY DEAR FRAU VON KAMECKEFritz has attempted to desert I have been
under the necessity to have him arrested I request you to tell my Wife
of it in some good way that the news may not terrify her And pity an
unhappy Father

FRIEDRICH WILHELM

No date ARRIVED from Wesel we conclude Sunday 20th August at
the Palace of Berlin Preuss i 42

The same post brought an order to the Colonel of the GernsdArmes to
put that Lieutenant Katte of his under close confinementwe hope the
thoughtless young fellow has already got out of the way He is getting
his saddle altered fettling about this and that does not consider what
danger he is in This same Sunday his Major met him on the street of
Berlin said in a significant tone You still HERE KatteI go
this night answered Katte but he again put it off did not go this
night and the order for his arrest did come in On the morrow
morning Colonel Pannewitz hoping now he was not there went with the
rhadamanthine order and finding the unlucky fellow was obliged to
execute it Katte lies in ward awaiting what may be prepared for him

Friedrich Wilhelm at Wesel has had rough passages with the Prince and
others On the Saturday evening 12th August 1730 Preuss iv 473
Seckendorf Forster iii 6 says 13th but WRONG his Majesty had the
Culprit brought on shore to the Commandants House for an interview
Culprit proving less remorseful than was expected and evidently not
confessing everything a loud terrible scene ensued which Friedrich
Wilhelm the unhappy Father winded up by drawing his sword to run the
unnatural Son through the body Old General Mosel Commandant of Wesel
sprang between them Sire cut me to death but spare your Son and
the sword was got back to its scabbard and the Prince lodged in a
separate room two sentries with fixed bayonets keeping watch over
him Friedrich Wilhelm did not see his face again for twelve months to
cometwelve months and three days

Military gentlemen of due grimness interrogated the Prince next evening
Seckendorf in Forster iii 5 from a Paper drawn up by his Majesty
in the interim Prince confesses little Did design to get across the
Rhine to Landau thence to Strasburg Paris in the strictest incognito
intended to volunteer there thought he might take French service
profoundly incognito and signalize himself in the Italian War just
expected to break out which might have recovered him some favor
from his Majesty does not tell clearly where his money came from shy
extremely of elucidating Katte and Keithin fact as we perceive
struggles against mendacity but will not tell the whole truth Let him
lie in ward then and take what doom the Laws have appointed for the
like of him Divine Laws are they not Well yes your Majesty divine
and humanor are there perhaps no laws but the human sort completely
explicit in this case He is my Colonel at least thinks Friedrich
Wilhelm and tried to desert and make others desert If a rebellious
CrownPrince breaking his Fathers heart find the laws still
inarticulate a deserting Colonel of the Potsdam Regiment finds them
speak plain enough Let him take the answer they give him

Dumoulin in the mean while can make nothing of Keith the runaway
Lieutenant Dumoulin with his sagacious organ soon came upon the scent
of Keith and has discovered these things about him One evening a week
before his Majesty arrived Sunday evening 6th August 1730 RELATIO
EX ACTIS in Preuss iv 473 Lieutenant Keith doubtless smelling
something saddled his horse as above mentioned decided to have a ride
in the country this fine evening and issued out at the Brunen Gate of
Wesel He is on the right bank of the Rhine pleasant yellow fields
on this hand and that He ambles slowly for a space then gradually
awakens into speed into full speed arrives within a couple of hours
at Dingden a Village in the Munster Territory safe over the Prussian
Border by the shortest line and from Dingden rides at more leisure
but without losing time into the Dutch Overyssel region straight
towards the Hague He must be in the Hague said Dumoulin to the
Official persons on arriving thereto Meinertshagen the Prussian
Ambassador there Seckendorf Forster iii 7 and to Keppel
Dutch Official gentleman who was once Ambassador at Berlin Prussian
Ambassador applies and again applies in the highest quarters but we
fear they are slack Dumoulin discovers that the man was certainly here
Keppel readily admits He had Keith to dinner a few days ago but where
Keith now is Keppel cannot form the least guess

Dumoulin suspects he is with Lord Chesterfield the English Ambassador
here A light was seen for a night or two in one of the garretrooms
of Lord Chesterfields houseprobably Keith readingbut Keith is not
to be heard of on inquiry there and the very light has now gone out
The Colonel at least distinguished English Lord is gone to England
in these days but his German Secretary is not gone the House is
inviolable impregnable to Prussia Who knows in spite of the light
going out but Keith is still there merely with a window shutter to
screen him One morning it becomes apparent Keith is not there One
morning a gentleman at the seaside is admiring Dutch fishingskiffs
and how they do sail Pooh Sir that is nothing answers a man in
multiplex breeches the other night I went across to England in one
with an Excellencys Messenger who could not waitTruth is the
Chesterfield Secretary who forbade lights took the first good night
for conveying Keith to Scheveningen and the seaside where a Fisherboat
was provided for him which carried him frail craft as it was safe
across to England Once there the Authorities took pity on the poor
fellowfurnished the modicum of cash and help sent him with Admiral
Norris to assist the Portuguese menaced with Spanish war at this time
among whom he gradually rose to be Major of Horse Friedrich Wilhelm
cited him by tap of drum three times in Wesel and also in the Gazettes
native and Dutch then as he did not come nailed an Effigy of him
cut in four if I remember on the gallows there and confiscated any
property he had Keith had more pedigree than property was of Poberow
in Pommern son of poor gentlefolks there He sent no word of himself to
Prussia for the next ten years so that he had become a kind of myth
to many people to his poor Mother among the rest who has her tragical
surmises about him He will appear again but not to much purpose His
Brother the Page Keith is packed into the Fusileer Regiment at Wesel
here and there walks sentry unheard of for the rest of his life
So much for the Keiths Preuss _Friedrich mit seinen Verwandten und
Freunden_ pp 330 392See on this and the other points Pollnitz
_Memoiren _ ii 352374 and correct his many blunders

Other difficulty there is as to the Prison of the Prince Wesel is a
strong Town but for obvious reasons one nearer Berlin farther from
the frontier would be preferable Towards Berlin however there is no
route all on Prussian ground from these divided Cleve Countries we have
to cross a bit of Hanover a bit of HessenCassel suppose these Serene
Highnesses were to interfere Not likely they will interfere answer
ancient military men of due grimness at any rate we can go a
roundabout road and they need not know That is the method settled on
neighborhood of Berlin clearly somewhere there must be the place Old
Castle of Mittenwalde in the Wusterhausen environs let that be
the first restingpoint then Rochow Waldau and the Wesel
FusileerColonel here sure men with a trooper or two for escort shall
conduct the Prisoner By Treuenbrietzen by circuitous roads swift
silent steadyand with vigilance as you shall answerThese
preliminaries settled Friedrich Wilhelm drives off homewards black
Care riding behind him He reaches Berlin Sunday 27th August finds a
world gone all to a kind of doomsday with him there poor gentleman




SCENE AT BERLIN ON MAJESTYS ARRIVAL

On Sunday evening 27th August 1730 his Majesty who had rested
overnight at Potsdam from his rapid journey drove into Berlin between
four and five in the afternoon Deserter Fritz is following under
escort of his three military gentlemen at a slower rate and by
circuitous routes so as to avoid the territories of Hanover and
Hessentowards Mittenwalde in the Wusterhausen neighborhood The
military gentlemen are vigilant as Argus and though pitying the poor
Prince must be rigorous as Rhadamanthus His attempts at escape of
which tradition mentions more than one they will not report to Papa
nor even notice to the Prince himself but will take care to render
futile one and all his Majesty may be secure on that score

The scenes that follow are unusual in royal history and having been
reported in the world with infinite noise and censure made up of
laughter and horror it will behoove us to be the more exact in relating
them as they actually befell Very difficult to pull out of that
ravelled cartload of chaotic thrums here a thread and there a thread
capable of being brought to the straight state and woven into legible
narrative But perhaps by that method the mingled laughter and horror
will modify itself a little What we can well say is that pity also
ought not to be wanting The next six months were undoubtedly by far the
wretchedest of Friedrich Wilhelms life The poor King except that he
was not conscious of intending wrong but much the reverse walked in
the hollow night of Gehenna all that while and was often like to be
driven mad by the turn things had taken

Here is scene first Wilhelmina reports his Majestys arrival that
Sunday afternoon to the following effect she was present in the
adventure and not a spectatress only

The Queen was alone in his Majestys Apartment waiting for him as he
approached At sight of her in the distance he called out Your losel
of a Son VOTRE INDIGNE FILS has ended at last you have done with
HIM or words to that effect What cried the Queen you have had
the barbarity to kill him Yes I tell youbut where is the sealed
Desk The Queen went to her own Apartment to fetch it I ran in to her
there for a moment she was out of herself wringing her hands crying
incessantly and said without ceasing MON DIEU MON FILS O God my
Son Breath failed me I fell fainting into the arms of Madame de
SonsfeldThe Queen took away the Writingcase King tore out the
letters and went off upon which the Queen came down again to us

We learned from some attendant that at least my Brother was not
dead The King now came back We all ran to kiss his hands but me he
no sooner noticed than rage and fury took possession of him He became
black in the face his eyes sparkling fire his mouth foaming Infamous
CANAILLE said he darest thou show thyself before me Go keep thy
scoundrel of a Brother company And so saying he seized me with one
hand slapping me on the face with the otherclenched as a fist
POINGseveral blows one of which struck me on the temple so
that I fell back and should have split my head against a corner of the
wainscot had not Madame de Sonsfeld caught me by the headdress and
broken the fall I lay on the ground without consciousness The King
in a frenzy was for striking me with his feet had not the Queen my
Sisters and the rest run between and those who were present prevented
him They all ranked themselves round me which gave Mesdames de Kamecke
and Sonsfeld time to pick me up They put me in a chair in the embrasure
of a window threw water on my face to bring me to life which care I
lamentably reproached them with death being a thousand times better in
the pass things had come to The Queen kept shrieking her firmness had
quite left her she wrung her hands and ran in despair up and down the
room The Kings face was so disfigured with rage it was frightful
to look upon The little ones were on their knees begging for
meWilhelmina i 265267poor little beings what a group
Amelia the youngest girl about six Henri in his bits of trousers
hardly over fourFor the rest I perceive this room was on the first
or a lower floor and such noises were very audible The Guard had
turned out at the noise and a crowd was collecting to see and hear
Move on Move on

The King had now changed his tune he admitted that my Brother was
still alive but vowed horribly he would put him to death and lay me
fast within four walls for the rest of my life He accused me of being
the Princes accomplice whose crime was high treasonalso of having
an intrigue of love with Katte to whom he said I had borne several
children The timid Gouvernante flamed up at this unheardof insult
That is not true said she fiercely whoever has told your Majesty
such a thing has told a lie Oh spare my Brother and I will marry
the Duke of Weissenfels whimpered I but in the great noise he did
not hear and while I strove to repeat it louder Sonsfeld clapt her
handkerchief on my face

Hustling aside to get rid of the handkerchief I saw Katte crossing
the Square Four soldiers were conducting him to the King trunks my
Brothers and his own sealed were coming on in the rear Pale and
downcast he took off his hat to salute mepoor Katte to me always
so prostrate in silent respect and now so unhappy A moment after the
King hearing he was come went out exclaiming Now I shall have proof
about the scoundrel Fritz and the offscouring CANAILLE Wilhelmina
clear proofs to cut the heads off themThe two Hofdames again
interfered and one of them Kamecke it was rebuked him told him
in the tone of a prophetess To take care what he was doing Whom his
Majesty gazed into with astonishment but rather with respect than with
anger saying Your intentions are good

And so his Majesty flung out seeking Katte and vanished Wilhelmina
saw no more of him for about a year after being ordered to her room
and kept prisoner there on low diet with sentries guarding her doors
and no outlook but the worst horror her imagination pleased to paint

This is the celebrated assault of paternal Majesty on Wilhelmina the
rumor of which has gone into all lands exciting wonder and horror but
could not be so exact as this account at first hand Naturally the crowd
of streetpassengers once dispersed by the Guard carried the matter
abroad and there was no end of sympathetic exaggerations Report ran
in Berlin for example that the poor Princess was killed beaten or
trampled to death which we clearly see she was not Voltaire in that
mass of angry calumnies very mendacious indeed which he calls VIE
PRIVEE DU ROI DE PRUSSE mentions the matter with emphasis and says
farther The Princess once did him Voltaire the honor to show him a
black mark she carried on her breast ever afterwhich is likelier to
be false than true Captain Guy Dickens the Legationary Captain who
seems a clear ingenuous and ingenious man and of course had access to
the highest circles of refined rumor reports the matter about ten days
after with several errors in this manner

BERLIN 5th SEPTEMBER 1730 Four or five days ago by the Almanac
nine and directly on his Majestys return which Dickens had announced
a week ago without that fact attached the King dreadfully illtreated
Wilhelmina in bed not in bed at all whole Castle SCHLOSS or
Palace was alarmed Guard turned outto clear away the crowd as we
perceive Not properly a crowd such was not permissible there but a
stagnation of the passersby would naturally ensue on that esplanade
till the Guard turned out and indicated with emphasis Move on
Dickens hears farther that the Queen fares no bettersuch is the
state of rumor in Berlin at present

Poor Katte had a hard audience of it too He fell at Friedrich Wilhelms
feet and was spurned and canedfor the rest beyond what was already
evident had little or nothing to confess Intention of flight and
of accompanying in flight very undeniable although preliminaries and
ulterior conditions of said flight not perfectly known to Katte known
only that the thought of raising trouble in foreign Courts or the least
vestige of treason against his Majesty had not entered even into their
dreams A name or two of persons who had known or guessed of these
operations is wrung from Kattename of a Lieutenant Spaen for one
who being on guard had admitted Katte into Potsdam once or twice
in disguisefor him and for the like of him of whatever rank
or whichever sex let arrests be made out and the scent as with
sleuthhounds be diligently followed on all sides and Katte stript of
his uniform be locked up in the grimmest manner Berlin with the rumor
of these things is a muchagitated city




Chapter VIII  SEQUEL TO CROWNPRINCE AND FRIENDS

As for the CrownPrince prosecuting his circuitous route he arrives
safe at Mittenwalde is lodged in the old Castle there I think for two
nights but the date in these indexless Books is blown away again
in a room bare of all things with sentries at the door and looks out
expecting Grumkow and the Officials to make assault on him One of these
Officials a certain Gerber Fiscal General who as head of Prussian
Fiscals kind of Public Prosecutor or supreme Essence of Bailiffs
Catchpoles and GrandJuries all in one wears a red cloakgave the
Prince a dreadful start Red cloak is the Berlin Hangmans or Headsmans
dress and poor Friedrich had the idea his end had summarily come
in this manner Soon seeing it was otherwise his spirits recovered
perhaps rose by the shock

He fronted Grumkow and the Officials with a high almost contemptuous
look answered promptlyif possible without lying and yet without
telling anythingshowed selfpossession pride retorted sometimes
Have you nothing more to ask Grumkow finding there was no way made
into anything not even into the secret of the Writingcase and the Royal
Womens operations there began at last as Wilhelmina says to hint
That in his Majestys service there were means of bringing out the truth
in spite of refractory humors that there was a thing called the rack
not yet abolished in his Prussian Majestys dominions Friedrich owned
afterwards his blood ran cold However he put on a high look A
Hangman such as you naturally takes pleasure in talking of his tools
and his trade but on me they will not produce any effect I have owned
everythingand almost regret to have done so For it is not my part
to stand questionings and bandy responses with a COQUIN COMME VOUS
scoundrel like you reports Wilhelmina i 280 though we hope
the actual term was slightly less candidGrumkow gathered his notes
together and went his ways with the man in red cloak and the rest
thus finishing the scene in Mittenwalde Mittenwalde which we used
to know long since in our Wusterhausen rides with poor Duhan little
thinking what awaited us there one day

Mittenwalde being finished Friedrich on Monday 6th September 1730
is sent forward to Custrin a strong little town in a quiet Country
some sixty or seventy miles eastward of Berlin On the evening of
the 5th he finds himself lodged in a strong room of the Fortress
thereroom consisting af bare walls lighted from far up no furniture
not even the needfulest everything indicating that the proud spirit and
the iron laws shall here have their duel out at leisure and see which
is stronger

His sword was taken from him at Wesel sword uniform every mark of
dignity all are now gone he is clad in brown prisondress of the
plainest cut and cloth his diet is fixed at tenpence a day to be
got from the cooks shop six groschen for dinner four for supper
Order 14th September 1730 in Forster i 372 food to be cut for
him no knife allowed Room is to be opened morning noon and evening
on the average not above four minutes each time lights or single
tallowlight to be extinguished at seven PM Absolute solitude no
flute allowed far from it no books allowed except the Bible and a
PrayerBookor perhaps Nolteniuss MANUAL if he took a hankering for
it There shut out from the babble of fools and conversing only with
the dumb Veracities with the huge inarticulate meanings of Destiny
Necessity and Eternity let the fool of a Fritz bethink himself if
there is any thought in him There among the Bogs of the Oder the very
sedges getting brown all round him and the very curlews flying off for
happier climes let him wait till the question of his doom rather an
abstruse question ripen in the royal breast

As for Wilhelmina she is close prisoner in her apartments in the
Berlin Palace sentries pacing at every outlet for many months to come
Wilhelmina almost rather likes it such a dog of an existence has
she had hitherto for want of being well let alone She plays reads
composes music smuggles letters to and from Mammaone in Pencil from
my Brother even O Heavens Wilhelmina weeps now and then with her
good Sonsfeld hopes nevertheless there will be some dawn to this
RAGNAROK or general twilight of the gods Friedrich Wilhelm
convinced that England has had a hand in this treason signifies
officially to his Excellency Captain Dickens That the English
negotiations are concluded that neither in the way of SingleMarriage
nor of DoubleMarriage will he have anything more to do with England
Well answers England who can help it Negotiation was not quite of
our seeking Let it so end Dickenss Despatch 25th September 1730
and Harringtons Answer to it of 6th October Seckendorf in Forster
iii 9 23d SeptemberNay at dinner one day Seckendorf reports
while Fritz was on the road to Custrin he proposes the toast Downfall
of England Seckendorf in Forster iii 11 and would have had the
Queen drink it who naturally wept but I conjecture could not be made
to drink Her Majesty is a weeping almost brokenhearted woman his
Majesty a raging almost brokenhearted man Seckendorf and Grumkow are
as it were too victorious and now have their apprehensions on that
latter score But they look on with countenances well veiled and touch
the helm judiciously in TobaccoParliament intent on the nearest harbor
of refuge

Her Majesty nevertheless steadily persists merely sinks deeper out of
sight with her English schemes ducking till the wave go by Messages
desperate appeals still go through Mamsell Bulow Wilhelminas Hofdame
and other channels nay Wilhelmina thinks there were still intentions
on the part of England and that the nonfulfilment of them at the
last moment turned on accident English Courier arrived some hours
too late thinks Wilhelmina Wilhelmina i 369 384 and Preuss and
others after her But that is a mistake The negotiation in spite
of her Majestys endeavors was essentially out England after such a
message could not nor did stir farther in the matter

In that Writingcase his Majesty found what we know nothing but
mysterious effects of female art and no light whatever It is a great
source of wrath and of sorrow to him that neither in the Writingcase
nor in Kattes or the Princes socalled Confessions can the thing be
seen into A deeper bottom it must have thinks his Majesty but knows
not what or where To overturn the Country belike and fling the
Kaiser and European Balance of Power bottom uppermost Me they
presumably meant to poison he tells Seckendorf one day Dickenss
Despatch 16th September 1730 Was ever Father more careful for
his children soul and body Anxious to excess to bring them up in
orthodox nurture and admonition and this is how they reward me Herr
Feldzeugmeister Had he honestly confessed and told me the whole
truth at Wesel I would have made it up with him quietly there But now
it must go its lengths and the whole world shall be judge between us
Seckendorf Forster ubi supra 23d September

His Majesty is in a flaming height He arrests punishes and banishes
where there is trace of cooperation or connection with Deserter Fritz
and his schemes The Bulows brother and sister brother in the
Kings service sister in Wilhelminas respectable goldstick people
originally of Hanover are hurled out to Lithuania and the worlds end
let them live in Memel and repent as they can Minister Knyphausen
always of English tendencies he with his Wifeto whom it is
specially hard while General Schwerin gallant witty Kurt once of
Mecklenburg stays behindis ordered to disappear and follow his
private rural business far off no minister ever more The Lieutenant
Spaen of the Giant Regiment who kept false watch and did not tell of
Katte gets cashiering and a year in Spandau He wandered elsewhither
and came to something afterwards poor Spaen Preuss i 63 66
Bookseller Hanau with this bad Fritzs Books To Memel with him also
let him deal in more orthodox kinds of Literature there

It is dangerous to have lent the CrownPrince money contrary to the
Royal Edict lucky if loss of your money will settle the account
Witness French Montholieu for one Count or whatever he styled
himself nailed to the gallows in effigy after he had fled It is

willnothing more upon my honor though his Majesty believes there

The excellent Tutor of the CrownPrince good Duhan de Jandun for what
fault or complicity we know not is hurled off to Memel ordered to live
thereon what resources is equally unknown Apparently his fault was
the general one of having miseducated the Prince and introduced these
French Literatures foreign poisonous elements of thought and practice
into the mind of his Pupil which have ruined the young man For his
Majesty perceives that there lies the source of it that only total
perversion of the heart and judgment first of all can have brought
about these dreadful issues of conduct And indeed his Majesty
understands on credible information that Deserter Fritz entertains
very heterodox opinions opinion on Predestination for onewhich is
itself calculated to be the very mother of mischief in a young mind
inclined to evil The heresy about Predestination or the FREIE
GNADENWAHL Election by Free Grace as his Majesty terms it according
to which a man is preappointed from all Eternity either to salvation or
the opposite which is Fritzs notion and indeed is Calvins and that
of many benighted creatures this Editor among them appears to his
Majesty an altogether shocking one nor would the whole Synod of Dort
or Calvin or St Augustine in person aided by a ThirtyEditor power
reconcile his Majestys practical judgment to such a tenet What May
not Deserter Fritz say to himself even now or in whatever other deeps
of sin he may fall into I was foredoomed to it how could I or how
can I help it The mind of his Majesty shudders as if looking over
the edge of an abyss He is meditating much whether nothing can be done
to save the lost Fritz at least the soul of him from this horrible
delusionhurls forth your fine Duhan with his metaphysics to remote
Memel as the first step And signifies withal though as yet only
historically and in a speculative way to Finkenstein and Kalkstein
themselves That their method of training up a young soul to do Gods
will and accomplish useful work in this world does by no means appear
to the royal mind an admirable one His Letter to them 3d December
1730 in Forster ii 382 Finkenstein and Kalkstein were always
covertly rather of the Queens party and now stand reprimanded and in
marked disfavor

That the treasonous mystery of this CrownPrince parricidal it is
likely and tending to upset the Universe must be investigated to the
very bottom and be condignly punished probably with death his Majesty
perceives too well and also what terrible difficulties formal and
essential there will be But whatever become of his perishable life
ought not if possible the soul of him to be saved from the claws
of Satan Claws of Satan brand from the burning for Christ our
Saviours sake in the name of the most merciful God Father Son and
Holy Ghost Amenso Friedrich Wilhelm phrases it in those confused
old documents and Cabinet Letters of his Forster i 374 379 c
which awaken a strange feeling in the attentive reader and show us
the ruggedest of human creatures melted into blubbering tenderness and
growling huskily something which we perceive is real prayer Here has a
business fallen out such as seldom occurred before




Chapter IX  COURTMARTIAL ON CROWNPRINCE AND CONSORTS

The rumor of these things naturally fills all minds and occupies all
human tongues in Berlin and Prussia though an Edict threatens That
the tongues shall be cut out which speak of them in any way Dickens
of 7th November 1730 and sounds far and wide into foreign Courts and
Countries where there is no such Edict Friedrich Wilhelms conduct
looked at from without appears that of a hideous royal ogre or blind
anthropophagous Polyphemus fallen mad Looked at from within where the
Polyphemus has his reasons and a kind of inner rushlight to enlighten
his path and is not bent on maneating but on discipline in spite
of difficultiesit is a wild enough piece of humanity not so much
ludicrous as tragical Never was a royal bear so led about before by a
pair of conjuring pipers in the market or brought to such a pass in his
dancing for them

General Ginkel the Dutch Ambassador here writes Dickens told me
of an interview he had with the King being ordered by their High
Mightinesses to solicit his Majesty in this matter King harbors most
monstrous wicked designs not fit to be spoken of in words reports
Ginkel It is certain added he if the King of Prussia continue in
the mind he is in at present we shall see scenes here as wicked and
bloody as any that were ever heard of since the creation of the
world Will sacrifice his whole family not the CrownPrince alone
everybody except Grumkow being as he fancies in conspiracy against
him Poor enchanted KingAnd all these things he said with such
imprecations and disordered looks foaming at the mouth all the while
as it was terrible either to see or hear That is Ginkels report as
Dickens conveys it Despatch 7th September 1730 Another time on
new order a month later when Ginkel went again to speak a word for the
poor Prisoner he found his Majesty clothed not in delirious thunder
but in sorrowful thick fog Ginkel was the less able to judge what the
King of Prussia meant to do with his Son as it was evident the King
himself did not know Ib 10th October

Poor Friedrich Wilhelm through these months wanders about shifting
from room to room in the nighttime like a man possessed by evil
fiends orders his carriage for Wusterhausen at two in the morning
but finds he is no better there and returns drinks a great deal has
not gone to bed sober for a month past Ib 19th December 1730 One
night he comes gliding like a perturbed ghost about midnight with his
candle in his hand into the Queens apartment says wildly staring
He thinks there is something haunting himO Feekin erring
disobedient Wife wilt not thou protect me after all Whither can I
fly when haunted except to thee Feekin like a prudent woman makes
no criticism orders that his Majestys bed be made up in her apartment
till these phenomena cease Ib 27th February 1731 A muchagitated
royal Father

The question what is to be done with this unhappy CrownPrince a
Deserter from the army a rebel against the paternal Majesty and a
believer in the doctrine of Election by Free Grace or that a mans good
or ill conduct is foredoomed upon him by decree of Godbecomes more
intricate the longer one thinks of it Seckendorf and Grumkow alarmed
at being too victorious are set against violent high methods and
suggest this and that consideration Who is it that can legally try
condemn or summon to his bar a CrownPrince He is Prince of the
Empire as well as your Majestys SonWell he is Heir of the
Sovereign Majesty in Prussia too and Colonel in the Potsdam Guards
answers Friedrich Wilhelm

At length after six or seven weeks of abstruse meditation it is
settled in TobaccoParliament and the royal breast That Katte and the
CrownPrince as Deserters from the Prussian Army can and shall be
tried by CourtMartial to that no power on the earth or out of it can
have any objection worth attending to Let a fair CourtMartial of our
highest military characters be selected and got ready Let that as a
voice of Rhadamanthus speak upon the two culprits and tell us what is
to be done By the middle of October things on Friedrich Wilhelms side
have got so far




CROWNPRINCE IN CUSTRIN

Poor Friedrich meanwhile has had a grim time of it these two months
back left alone in coarse brown prisondress within his four bare
walls at Custrin in uninterrupted unfathomable colloquy with the
Destinies and the Necessities there The Kings stern orders must be
fulfilled to the letter the CrownPrince is immured in that manner At
Berlin there are the wildest rumors as to the state he has fallen into
covered with rags and vermin unshaven no comb allowed him lights
his own fire says one testimony which Captain Dickens thinks worth
reporting For the truth is no unofficial eye can see the CrownPrince
or know what state he is in And we find in spite of the Edict
tongues not cut out kept wagging at a high rate People of all
ranks are unspeakably indignant at certain heights of the business
Margravine Albert said publicly A tyrant as bad as Nero Dickens
7th November 2d December 1730

How long the CrownPrinces defiant humor held out we are not told By
the middle of October there comes proposal of entire confession from
the Prince and though when Papa sends deputies accordingly there
is next to nothing new confessed and Papas anger blazes out again
probably we may take this as the turningpoint on his Sons part With
him of course that mood of mind could not last There is no wildest
lion but finding his bars are made of iron ceases to bite them The
CrownPrince there in his horror indignation and despair had a lucid
human judgment in him too loyal to facts and well knowing their
inexorable nature Just sentiments are in this young man not capable of
permanent distortion into spasm by any form of injustice laid on
them It is not long till he begins to discern athwart this terrible
quasiinfernal element that so the facts are and that nothing but
destruction and no honor that were not dishonor will be got by not
conforming to the facts My Father may be a tyrant and driven mad
against me well well let not me at least go mad

Grumkow is busy on the mild side of the business of course Grumkow and
all official men Grumkow cannot but ask himself this question among
others How if the King should suddenly die upon us Grumkow is out
at Custrin and again out explaining to the Prince what the enormous
situation is how inflexible inexorable and of peril and horror
incalculable to Mother and Sister and self and royal House and that
there is one possibility of good issue and only one that of loyally
yielding where one cannot resist By degrees some lurid troublous
but perceptible lightgleam breaks athwart the black whirlwind of
our indignation and despair and saner thoughts begin to insinuate
themselves Obey thou art not the strongest there are stronger than
thou All men the highest among them are called to learn obedience

Moreover the first sweep of royal fury being past his Majestys stern
regulations at Custrin began to relax in fulfilment to be obeyed only
by those immediately responsible and in letter rather than in spirit
even by those President von Munchow who is head of the DomainKammer
chief representative of Government at Custrin and resides in the
Fortress there ventures after a little the Princes doors being closed
as we saw to have an orifice bored through the floor above and thereby
to communicate with the Prince and sympathetically ask What he can
do for him Many things books among others are under cunning
contrivance smuggled in by the judicious Munchow willing to risk
himself in such a service For example Munchow has a son a clever
boy of seven years old who to the wonder of neighbors goes into
childspetticoats again and testifies the liveliest desire to be
admitted to the Prince and bear him company a little Surely the law
of Nocompany does not extend to that of an innocent child The innocent
child has a row of pockets all round the inside of his long gown and
goes laden miscellaneously like a ship of the desert or cockboat not
forbidden to cross the line Then there are stools one stool at least
indispensable to human nature and the inside of this once you open it
is a chestofdrawers containing paper ink new literature and
much else No end to Munchowa goodwill and his ingenuity is great
Preuss i 46

A Captain Fouquet also furthered I think by the Old Dessauer whose man
he is comes to Custrin Garrison on duty or as volunteer by and by He
is an old friend of the Princesran off being the Dessauers little
page to the Siege of Stralsund long ago to be the Dessauers little
soldier therea readywitted hottempered highly estimable man and
his real duty here is to do the Prince what service may be possible He
is often with the Prince their light is extinguished precisely at seven
oclock Very well Lieutenant he would say you have done your
orders to the CrownPrinces light But his Majesty has no concern with
Captain Fouquets candles and thereupon would light a pair Nay I
have heard of Lieutenants who punctually blew out the Princes light as
a matter of duty and command and then kindled it again as a civility
left free to human nature In short his Majestys orders can only be
fulfilled to the letter Commandant Lepel and all Officers are willing
not to see where they can help seeing Even in the letter his Majestys
orders are severe enough




SENTENCE OF COURTMARTIAL

Meanwhile the CourtMartial selected with intense study installs
itself at Copenick and on the 25th of October commences work This
Deserter CrownPrince and his accomplices especially Katte his chief
accomplice what is to be done with them Copenick lies on the road to
Custrin within a mornings drive of Berlin there is an ancient Palace
here and room for a CourtMartial QUE FAIRE ILS ONT DES CANONS
said the old Prussian Raths wandering about in these woods when
Gustavus and his Swedes were at the door QUE FAIRE may the new
military gentlemen think to themselves here again while the brown
leaves rustle down upon them after a hundred years

The Court consists of a President LieutenantGeneral Schulenburg
an elderly Malplaquet gentleman of good experience one of the many
Schulenburgs conspicuous for soldiering and otherwise in those times
He is nephew of George Is lean mistress who also was a Schulenburg
originally and conspicuous not for soldiering Lean mistress we say
not the Fat one or cataract of tallow with eyebrows like a cartwheel
and dim coaly disks for eyes who was George Is halfsister probably
not his mistress at all and who now as Countess of Darlington so
called sits at Isleworth with good fat pensions and a tame raven
comeofwillprobably the SOUL of George I in some form See
Walpole _Reminiscences_ Not this one we saybut the threadpaper
Duchess of Kendal actual Exmistress who tore her hair on the
road when apoplexy overtook poor George and who now attends chapel
diligently poor old anatomy or lean human nailrod For the sake of
the English reader searching into what is called History I with
indignation endeavor to discriminate these two beings once again that
each may be each till both are happily forgotten to all eternity
It was the latter lean maypole or nailrod one that was Aunt of
Schulenburg the elderly Malplaquet gentleman who now presides
at Copenick And let the reader remember him for he will turn up
repeatedly again

The Court consisted farther of three MajorGenerals among whom I name
only Grumkow MajorGeneral by rank though more of a diplomatist
and blackartist than a soldier and Schwerin Kurt von Schwerin of
Mecklenburg whom Madam Knyphausen regrets in her now exile to
the Country three Colonels Derschau one of them three
LieutenantColonels three Majors and three Captains all of whom
shall be nameless here Lastly come three of the Auditor or the
JudgeAdvocate sort Mylius the Compiler of sad Prussian Quartos known
to some Gerber whose red cloak has frightened us once already and
the Auditor of Kattes regiment A complete CourtMartial and of
symmetrical structure by the rule of threeof whose proceedings we
know mainly the result nor seek much to know more This Court met on
Wednesday 25th October 1730 in the little Town of Copenick and in
six days had ended signed sealed and despatched to his Majesty and
got back to Berlin on the Tuesday next His Majesty who is now at
Wusterhausen in hunting time finds conclusions to the following
effect

Accomplices of the CrownPrince are two FIRST Lieutenant Keith actual
deserter who cannot be caught To be hanged in effigy cut in four
quarters and nailed to the gallows at WeselGOOD says his Majesty
SECONDLY Lieutenant Katte of the GensdArmes intended deserter not
actually deserting and much tempted thereto All things considered
Perpetual Fortress Arrest to Lieutenant KatteNOT GOOD this BAD this
thinks Majesty this provokes from his Majesty an angry rebuke to the
too lax CourtMartial Rebuke which can still be read in growling
unlucid phraseology but with a rhadamanthine idea clear enough in it
and with a practical purport only too clear That Katte was a sworn
soldier of the GensdArmes even or Bodyguard of the Prussian
Majesty and did nevertheless in the teeth of his oath worship the
Rising Sun when minded to desert did plot and colleague with foreign
Courts in aid of said Rising Sun and of an intended high crime against
the Prussian Majesty itself on Rising Suns part far from at once
revealing the same as duty ordered Lieutenant Katte to do That Kattes
crime amounts to hightreason CRIMEN LOESOE MAJESTATIS that the rule
is FIAT JUSTITIA ET PEREAT MUNDUSand that in brief Kattes doom
is and is hereby declared to be Death Death by the gallows and hot
pincers is the usual doom of Traitors but his Majesty will say in this
case Death by the sword and headsman simply certain circumstances
moving the royal clemency to go so far no farther And the
CourtMartial has straightway to apprise Katte of this same and so
doing shall say That his Majesty is sorry for Katte but that it is
better he die than that justice depart out of the world Preuss i
44

This is the iron doom of Katte which no prayer or influence of mortal
will avail to alterlest justice depart out of the world Kattes
Father is a General of rank Commandant of Konigsberg at this moment
Kattes Grandfather by the Mothers side old Fieldmarshal Wartensleben
is a man in good favor with Friedrich Wilhelm and of high esteem and
mark in his country for half a century past But all this can effect
nothing Old Wartensleben thinks of the Daughter he lost for happily
Kattes Mother is dead long since Old Wartensleben writes to Friedrich
Wilhelm his mournful Letter and Friedrich Wilhelms mournful but
inexorable answer can be read in the Histories but show only what we
already know

Kattes Mother Fieldmarshal Wartenslebens Daughter died in 1706
leaving Katte only two years old He is now twentysix very young for
such grave issues and his fate is certainly very hard Poor young
soul he did not resist farther or quarrel with the inevitable and
inexorable He listened to Chaplain Muller of the GensdArmes admitted
profoundly after his fashion that the great God was just and the poor
Katte sinful foolish only to be saved by miracle of mercy and piously
prepared himself to die on these terms There are three Letters of his
to his Grandfather which can still be read one of them in Wilhelminas
Book Wilhelmina i 302 the sound of it like that of dirges borne on
the wind Wilhelmina evidently pities Katte very tenderly in her heart
she has a fine royalmaiden kind of feeling to the poor youth He did
heartily repent and submit left with Chaplain Muller a Paper of pious
considerations admonishing the Prince to submit These are Kattes last
employments in his prison at Berlin after sentence had gone forth




KATTES END 6th NOVEMBER 1780

On Sunday evening 6th November it is intimated to him unexpectedly at
the moment that he has to go to Custrin and there diecarriage now
waiting at the gate Katte masters the sudden flurry signifies that all
is ready then and so under charge of his old Major and two brother
Officers who and Chaplain Muller are in the carriage with him
a troop of his own old Cavalry Regiment escorting he leaves Berlin
rather on sudden summons drives all night towards Custrin and
immediate death Words of sympathy were not wanting to which Katte
answered cheerily grim faces wore a cloud of sorrow for the poor youth
that night Chaplain Mullers exhortations were fervent and continual
and from time to time there were heard hoarsely melodious through the
damp darkness and the noise of wheels snatches of devotional singing
led by Muller

It was in the gray of the winter morning 6th November 1730 that Katte
arrived in Custrin garrison He took kind leave of Major and men Adieu
my brothers good be with you evermoreAnd about nine oclock he is
on the road towards the Rampart of the Castle where a scaffold stands
Katte wore by order a brown dress exactly like the Princes the
Prince is already brought down into a lower room to see Katte as he
passes to see Katte die had been the royal order but they smuggled
that into abeyance and Katte knows he shall see him Faithful Muller
was in the deathcar along with Katte and he had adjoined to himself
one Besserer the Chaplain of the Garrison in this sad function since
arriving Here is a glimpse from Besserer which we may take as better
than nothing

His Kattes eyes were mostly directed to God and we Muller and I
on our part strove to hold his heart up heavenwards by presenting the
examples of those who had died in the Lordas of Gods Son himself
and Stephen and the Thief on the Crosstill under such discoursing
we approached the Castle Here after long wistful looking about he did
get sight of his beloved Jonathan Royal Highness the CrownPrince at
a window in the Castle from whom he with the politest and most tender
expression spoken in French took leave with no little emotion of
sorrow Letter to Kattes Father Extract in Preuss _Friedrich mit
Freunden und Verwandten_ p 7

President Munchow and the Commandant were with the Prince whose
emotions one may fancy but not describe Seldom did any Prince or man
stand in such a predicament Vain to say and again say In the name of
God I ask you stop the execution till I write to the King Impossible
that as easily stop the course of the stars And so here Katte
comes cheerful loyalty still beaming on his face death now nigh
PARDONNEZMOI MON CHER KATTE cried Priedrich in a tone Pardon me
dear Katte oh that this should be what I have done for youDeath is
sweet for a Prince I love so well said Katte LA MORT EST DOUCE POUR
UN SI AIMABLE PRINCE Wilhelmina i 307 Preuss i 45 and fared
onround some angle of the Fortress it appears not in sight of
Friedrich who sank into a faint and had seen his last glimpse of Katte
in this world

The body lay all day upon the scaffold by royal order and was buried
at night obscurely in the common churchyard friends in silence took
mark of the place against better timesand Kattes dust now lies
elsewhere among that of his own kindred

Never was such a transaction before or since in Modern History
cries the angry reader cruel like the grinding of human hearts under
millstones like Or indeed like the doings of the gods which are
cruel though not that alone This is what after much sorting and
sifting I could get to know about the definite facts of it Commentary
not likely to be very final at this epoch the reader himself shall
supply at discretion

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
