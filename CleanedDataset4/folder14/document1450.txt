CHAPTER I MISS POLLY

Miss Polly Harrington entered her kitchen a little hurriedly this
June morning Miss Polly did not usually make hurried movements she
specially prided herself on her repose of manner But today she was
hurryingactually hurrying

Nancy washing dishes at the sink looked up in surprise Nancy had been
working in Miss Pollys kitchen only two months but already she knew
that her mistress did not usually hurry

Nancy

Yes maam Nancy answered cheerfully but she still continued wiping
the pitcher in her hand

NancyMiss Pollys voice was very stern nowwhen Im talking to
you I wish you to stop your work and listen to what I have to say

Nancy flushed miserably She set the pitcher down at once with the
cloth still about it thereby nearly tipping it overwhich did not add
to her composure

Yes maam I will maam she stammered righting the pitcher
and turning hastily I was only keepin on with my work cause you
specially told me this mornin ter hurry with my dishes ye know

Her mistress frowned

That will do Nancy I did not ask for explanations I asked for your
attention

Yes maam Nancy stifled a sigh She was wondering if ever in any way
she could please this woman Nancy had never worked out before but
a sick mother suddenly widowed and left with three younger children
besides Nancy herself had forced the girl into doing something toward
their support and she had been so pleased when she found a place in
the kitchen of the great house on the hillNancy had come from The
Corners six miles away and she knew Miss Polly Harrington only as
the mistress of the old Harrington homestead and one of the wealthiest
residents of the town That was two months before She knew Miss Polly
now as a stern severefaced woman who frowned if a knife clattered to
the floor or if a door bangedbut who never thought to smile even when
knives and doors were still

When youve finished your morning work Nancy Miss Polly was saying
now you may clear the little room at the head of the stairs in the
attic and make up the cot bed Sweep the room and clean it of course
after you clear out the trunks and boxes

Yes maam And where shall I put the things please that I take out

In the front attic Miss Polly hesitated then went on I suppose I
may as well tell you now Nancy My niece Miss Pollyanna Whittier is
coming to live with me She is eleven years old and will sleep in that
room

A little girlcoming here Miss Harrington Oh wont that be nice
cried Nancy thinking of the sunshine her own little sisters made in the
home at The Corners

Nice Well that isnt exactly the word I should use rejoined Miss
Polly stiffly However I intend to make the best of it of course I
am a good woman I hope and I know my duty

Nancy colored hotly

Of course maam it was only that I thought a little girl here
mightmight brighten things up for you she faltered

Thank you rejoined the lady dryly I cant say however that I see
any immediate need for that

But of course youyoud want her your sisters child ventured
Nancy vaguely feeling that somehow she must prepare a welcome for this
lonely little stranger

Miss Polly lifted her chin haughtily

Well really Nancy just because I happened to have a sister who was
silly enough to marry and bring unnecessary children into a world that
was already quite full enough I cant see how I should particularly
WANT to have the care of them myself However as I said before I hope
I know my duty See that you clean the corners Nancy she finished
sharply as she left the room

Yes maam sighed Nancy picking up the halfdried pitchernow so
cold it must be rinsed again


In her own room Miss Polly took out once more the letter which she had
received two days before from the faraway Western town and which had
been so unpleasant a surprise to her The letter was addressed to Miss
Polly Harrington Beldingsville Vermont and it read as follows

Dear MadamI regret to inform you that the Rev John Whittier died
two weeks ago leaving one child a girl eleven years old He left
practically nothing else save a few books for as you doubtless know
he was the pastor of this small mission church and had a very meagre
salary

I believe he was your deceased sisters husband but he gave me to
understand the families were not on the best of terms He thought
however that for your sisters sake you might wish to take the child
and bring her up among her own people in the East Hence I am writing to
you

The little girl will be all ready to start by the time you get this
letter and if you can take her we would appreciate it very much if you
would write that she might come at once as there is a man and his wife
here who are going East very soon and they would take her with them to
Boston and put her on the Beldingsville train Of course you would be
notified what day and train to expect Pollyanna on

Hoping to hear favorably from you soon I remain

Respectfully yours

Jeremiah O White


With a frown Miss Polly folded the letter and tucked it into its
envelope She had answered it the day before and she had said she would
take the child of course She HOPED she knew her duty well enough for
thatdisagreeable as the task would be

As she sat now with the letter in her hands her thoughts went back to
her sister Jennie who had been this childs mother and to the time
when Jennie as a girl of twenty had insisted upon marrying the young
minister in spite of her familys remonstrances There had been a man
of wealth who had wanted herand the family had much preferred him to
the minister but Jennie had not The man of wealth had more years as
well as more money to his credit while the minister had only a young
head full of youths ideals and enthusiasm and a heart full of love
Jennie had preferred thesequite naturally perhaps so she had married
the minister and had gone south with him as a home missionarys wife

The break had come then Miss Polly remembered it well though she had
been but a girl of fifteen the youngest at the time The family had
had little more to do with the missionarys wife To be sure Jennie
herself had written for a time and had named her last baby Pollyanna
for her two sisters Polly and Annathe other babies had all died This
had been the last time that Jennie had written and in a few years there
had come the news of her death told in a short but heartbroken little
note from the minister himself dated at a little town in the West

Meanwhile time had not stood still for the occupants of the great house
on the hill Miss Polly looking out at the farreaching valley below
thought of the changes those twentyfive years had brought to her

She was forty now and quite alone in the world Father mother
sistersall were dead For years now she had been sole mistress of
the house and of the thousands left her by her father There were people
who had openly pitied her lonely life and who had urged her to have
some friend or companion to live with her but she had not welcomed
either their sympathy or their advice She was not lonely she said She
liked being by herself She preferred quiet But now

Miss Polly rose with frowning face and closelyshut lips She was glad
of course that she was a good woman and that she not only knew
her duty but had sufficient strength of character to perform it
ButPOLLYANNAwhat a ridiculous name



CHAPTER II OLD TOM AND NANCY

In the little attic room Nancy swept and scrubbed vigorously paying
particular attention to the corners There were times indeed when the
vigor she put into her work was more of a relief to her feelings than
it was an ardor to efface dirtNancy in spite of her frightened
submission to her mistress was no saint

IjustwishI coulddigout the cornersofhersoul she
muttered jerkily punctuating her words with murderous jabs of her
pointed cleaningstick Theres plenty of em needs cleanin all right
all right The idea of stickin that blessed child way off up here in
this hot little roomwith no fire in the winter too and all this big
house ter pick and choose from Unnecessary children indeed Humph
snapped Nancy wringing her rag so hard her fingers ached from the
strain I guess it aint CHILDREN what is MOST unnecessary just now
just now

For some time she worked in silence then her task finished she looked
about the bare little room in plain disgust

Well its donemy part anyhow she sighed There aint no dirt
hereand theres mighty little else Poor little soula pretty place
this is ter put a homesick lonesome child into she finished going
out and closing the door with a bang Oh she ejaculated biting
her lip Then doggedly Well I dont care I hope she did hear the
bangI do I do

In the garden that afternoon Nancy found a few minutes in which to
interview Old Tom who had pulled the weeds and shovelled the paths
about the place for uncounted years

Mr Tom began Nancy throwing a quick glance over her shoulder to
make sure she was unobserved did you know a little girl was comin
here ter live with Miss Polly

Awhat demanded the old man straightening his bent back with
difficulty

A little girlto live with Miss Polly

Go on with yer jokin scoffed unbelieving Tom Why dont ye tell me
the sun is agoin ter set in the east termorrer

But its true She told me so herself maintained Nancy Its her
niece and shes eleven years old

The mans jaw fell

ShoI wonder now he muttered then a tender light came into his
faded eyes It aintbut it must beMiss Jennies little gal There
wasnt none of the rest of em married Why Nancy it must be Miss
Jennies little gal Glory be ter praise ter think of my old eyes
aseein this

Who was Miss Jennie

She was an angel straight out of Heaven breathed the man fervently
but the old master and missus knew her as their oldest daughter She
was twenty when she married and went away from here long years ago Her
babies all died I heard except the last one and that must be the one
whats acomin

Shes eleven years old

Yes she might be nodded the old man

And shes goin ter sleep in the atticmore shame ter HER scolded
Nancy with another glance over her shoulder toward the house behind
her

Old Tom frowned The next moment a curious smile curved his lips

Im awonderin what Miss Polly will do with a child in the house he
said

Humph Well Im awonderin what a child will do with Miss Polly in
the house snapped Nancy

The old man laughed

Im afraid you aint fond of Miss Polly he grinned

As if ever anybody could be fond of her scorned Nancy

Old Tom smiled oddly He stooped and began to work again

I guess maybe you didnt know about Miss Pollys love affair he said
slowly

Love affairHER Noand I guess nobody else didnt neither

Oh yes they did nodded the old man And the fellers livin
terdayright in this town too

Who is he

I aint atellin that It aint fit that I should The old man drew
himself erect In his dim blue eyes as he faced the house there was
the loyal servants honest pride in the family he has served and loved
for long years

But it dont seem possibleher and a lover still maintained Nancy

Old Tom shook his head

You didnt know Miss Polly as I did he argued She used ter be real
handsomeand she would be now if shed let herself be

Handsome Miss Polly

Yes If shed just let that tight hair of hern all out loose and
carelesslike as it used ter be and wear the sort of bunnits with
posies in em and the kind o dresses all lace and white thingsyoud
see shed be handsome Miss Polly aint old Nancy

Aint she though Well then shes got an awfully good imitation of
itshe has she has sniffed Nancy

Yes I know It begun thenat the time of the trouble with her lover
nodded Old Tom and it seems as if shed been feedin on wormwood an
thistles ever sinceshes that bitter an prickly ter deal with

I should say she was declared Nancy indignantly Theres no
pleasin her nohow no matter how you try I wouldnt stay if twant
for the wages and the folks at home whats needin em But some
daysome day I shall jest bile over and when I do of course itll be
goodby Nancy for me It will it will

Old Tom shook his head

I know Ive felt it Its nartralbut taint best child taint
best Take my word for it taint best And again he bent his old head
to the work before him

Nancy called a sharp voice

Yyes maam stammered Nancy and hurried toward the house



CHAPTER III THE COMING OF POLLYANNA

In due time came the telegram announcing that Pollyanna would arrive in
Beldingsville the next day the twentyfifth of June at four oclock
Miss Polly read the telegram frowned then climbed the stairs to the
attic room She still frowned as she looked about her

The room contained a small bed neatly made two straightbacked chairs
a washstand a bureauwithout any mirrorand a small table There were
no drapery curtains at the dormer windows no pictures on the wall All
day the sun had been pouring down upon the roof and the little room
was like an oven for heat As there were no screens the windows had not
been raised A big fly was buzzing angrily at one of them now up and
down up and down trying to get out

Miss Polly killed the fly swept it through the window raising the sash
an inch for the purpose straightened a chair frowned again and left
the room

Nancy she said a few minutes later at the kitchen door I found a
fly upstairs in Miss Pollyannas room The window must have been raised
at some time I have ordered screens but until they come I shall
expect you to see that the windows remain closed My niece will arrive
tomorrow at four oclock I desire you to meet her at the station
Timothy will take the open buggy and drive you over The telegram says
light hair redchecked gingham dress and straw hat That is all I
know but I think it is sufficient for your purpose

Yes maam butyou

Miss Polly evidently read the pause aright for she frowned and said
crisply

No I shall not go It is not necessary that I should I think That is
all And she turned awayMiss Pollys arrangements for the comfort of
her niece Pollyanna were complete

In the kitchen Nancy sent her flatiron with a vicious dig across the
dishtowel she was ironing

Light hair redchecked gingham dress and straw hatall she knows
indeed Well Id be ashamed ter own it up that I would I wouldand
her my onliest niece what was acomin from way across the continent

Promptly at twenty minutes to four the next afternoon Timothy and Nancy
drove off in the open buggy to meet the expected guest Timothy was Old
Toms son It was sometimes said in the town that if Old Tom was Miss
Pollys righthand man Timothy was her left

Timothy was a goodnatured youth and a goodlooking one as well
Short as had been Nancys stay at the house the two were already good
friends Today however Nancy was too full of her mission to be her
usual talkative self and almost in silence she took the drive to the
station and alighted to wait for the train

Over and over in her mind she was saying it light hair redchecked
dress straw hat Over and over again she was wondering just what sort
of child this Pollyanna was anyway

I hope for her sake shes quiet and sensible and dont drop knives nor
bang doors she sighed to Timothy who had sauntered up to her

Well if she aint nobody knows whatll become of the rest of us
grinned Timothy Imagine Miss Polly and a NOISY kid Gorry there goes
the whistle now

Oh Timothy II think it was mean ter send me chattered the
suddenly frightened Nancy as she turned and hurried to a point where
she could best watch the passengers alight at the little station

It was not long before Nancy saw herthe slender little girl in the
redchecked gingham with two fat braids of flaxen hair hanging down her
back Beneath the straw hat an eager freckled little face turned to
the right and to the left plainly searching for some one

Nancy knew the child at once but not for some time could she control
her shaking knees sufficiently to go to her The little girl was
standing quite by herself when Nancy finally did approach her

Are you MissPollyanna she faltered The next moment she found
herself half smothered in the clasp of two ginghamclad arms

Oh Im so glad GLAD GLAD to see you cried an eager voice in her
ear Of course Im Pollyanna and Im so glad you came to meet me I
hoped you would

Youyou did stammered Nancy vaguely wondering how Pollyanna could
possibly have known herand wanted her Youyou did she repeated
trying to straighten her hat

Oh yes and Ive been wondering all the way here what you looked
like cried the little girl dancing on her toes and sweeping the
embarrassed Nancy from head to foot with her eyes And now I know and
Im glad you look just like you do look

Nancy was relieved just then to have Timothy come up Pollyannas words
had been most confusing

This is Timothy Maybe you have a trunk she stammered

Yes I have nodded Pollyanna importantly Ive got a brandnew one
The Ladies Aid bought it for meand wasnt it lovely of them when
they wanted the carpet so Of course I dont know how much red carpet
a trunk could buy but it ought to buy some anyhowmuch as half an
aisle dont you think Ive got a little thing here in my bag that Mr
Gray said was a check and that I must give it to you before I could
get my trunk Mr Gray is Mrs Grays husband Theyre cousins of Deacon
Carrs wife I came East with them and theyre lovely Andthere here
tis she finished producing the check after much fumbling in the bag
she carried

Nancy drew a long breath Instinctively she felt that some one had
to draw oneafter that speech Then she stole a glance at Timothy
Timothys eyes were studiously turned away

The three were off at last with Pollyannas trunk in behind and
Pollyanna herself snugly ensconced between Nancy and Timothy During
the whole process of getting started the little girl had kept up an
uninterrupted stream of comments and questions until the somewhat dazed
Nancy found herself quite out of breath trying to keep up with her

There Isnt this lovely Is it far I hope tisI love to ride
sighed Pollyanna as the wheels began to turn Of course if tisnt
far I shant mind though cause Ill be glad to get there all the
sooner you know What a pretty street I knew twas going to be pretty
father told me

She stopped with a little choking breath Nancy looking at her
apprehensively saw that her small chin was quivering and that her eyes
were full of tears In a moment however she hurried on with a brave
lifting of her head

Father told me all about it He remembered Andand I ought to have
explained before Mrs Gray told me to at onceabout this red gingham
dress you know and why Im not in black She said youd think twas
queer But there werent any black things in the last missionary
barrel only a ladys velvet basque which Deacon Carrs wife said wasnt
suitable for me at all besides it had white spotsworn you knowon
both elbows and some other places Part of the Ladies Aid wanted to
buy me a black dress and hat but the other part thought the money ought
to go toward the red carpet theyre trying to getfor the church you
know Mrs White said maybe it was just as well anyway for she didnt
like children in blackthat is I mean she liked the children of
course but not the black part

Pollyanna paused for breath and Nancy managed to stammer

Well Im sure ititll be all right

Im glad you feel that way I do too nodded Pollyanna again with
that choking little breath Of course twould have been a good deal
harder to be glad in black

Glad gasped Nancy surprised into an interruption

Yesthat fathers gone to Heaven to be with mother and the rest of us
you know He said I must be glad But its been pretty hard toto do
it even in red gingham because II wanted him so and I couldnt
help feeling I OUGHT to have him specially as mother and the rest have
God and all the angels while I didnt have anybody but the Ladies Aid
But now Im sure itll be easier because Ive got you Aunt Polly Im
so glad Ive got you

Nancys aching sympathy for the poor little forlornness beside her
turned suddenly into shocked terror

Oh butbut youve made an awful mistake ddear she faltered Im
only Nancy I aint your Aunt Polly at all

Youyou ARENT stammered the little girl in plain dismay

No Im only Nancy I never thought of your takin me for her Wewe
aint a bit alike we aint we aint

Timothy chuckled softly but Nancy was too disturbed to answer the merry
flash from his eyes

But who ARE you questioned Pollyanna You dont look a bit like a
Ladies Aider

Timothy laughed outright this time

Im Nancy the hired girl I do all the work except the washin an
hard ironin Mis Durgin does that

But there IS an Aunt Polly demanded the child anxiously

You bet your life there is cut in Timothy

Pollyanna relaxed visibly

Oh thats all right then There was a moments silence then she
went on brightly And do you know Im glad after all that she didnt
come to meet me because now Ive got HER still coming and Ive got you
besides

Nancy flushed Timothy turned to her with a quizzical smile

I call that a pretty slick compliment he said Why dont you thank
the little lady

II was thinkin aboutMiss Polly faltered Nancy

Pollyanna sighed contentedly

I was too Im so interested in her You know shes all the aunt Ive
got and I didnt know I had her for ever so long Then father told me
He said she lived in a lovely great big house way on top of a hill

She does You can see it now said Nancy

Its that big white one with the green blinds way ahead

Oh how prettyand what a lot of trees and grass all around it I
never saw such a lot of green grass seems so all at once Is my Aunt
Polly rich Nancy

Yes Miss

Im so glad It must be perfectly lovely to have lots of money I never
knew any one that did have only the Whitestheyre some rich They
have carpets in every room and icecream Sundays Does Aunt Polly have
icecream Sundays

Nancy shook her head Her lips twitched She threw a merry look into
Timothys eyes

No Miss Your aunt dont like icecream I guess leastways I never
saw it on her table

Pollyannas face fell

Oh doesnt she Im so sorry I dont see how she can help liking
icecream Butanyhow I can be kinder glad about that cause the
icecream you dont eat cant make your stomach ache like Mrs Whites
didthat is I ate hers you know lots of it Maybe Aunt Polly has got
the carpets though

Yes shes got the carpets

In every room

Well in almost every room answered Nancy frowning suddenly at the
thought of that bare little attic room where there was no carpet

Oh Im so glad exulted Pollyanna I love carpets We didnt have
any only two little rugs that came in a missionary barrel and one
of those had ink spots on it Mrs White had pictures too perfectly
beautiful ones of roses and little girls kneeling and a kitty and some
lambs and a lionnot together you knowthe lambs and the lion Oh of
course the Bible says they will sometime but they havent yetthat is
I mean Mrs Whites havent Dont you just love pictures

II dont know answered Nancy in a halfstifled voice

I do We didnt have any pictures They dont come in the barrels much
you know There did two come once though But one was so good father
sold it to get money to buy me some shoes with and the other was so bad
it fell to pieces just as soon as we hung it up Glassit broke you
know And I cried But Im glad now we didnt have any of those nice
things cause I shall like Aunt Pollys all the betternot being used
to em you see Just as it is when the PRETTY hairribbons come in
the barrels after a lot of fadedout brown ones My but isnt this a
perfectly beautiful house she broke off fervently as they turned into
the wide driveway

It was when Timothy was unloading the trunk that Nancy found an
opportunity to mutter low in his ear

Dont you never say nothin ter me again about leavin Timothy Durgin
You couldnt HIRE me ter leave

Leave I should say not grinned the youth

You couldnt drag me away Itll be more fun here now with that kid
round than movinpicture shows every day

Funfun repeated Nancy indignantly I guess itll be somethin
more than fun for that blessed childwhen them two tries ter live
tergether and I guess shell be aneedin some rock ter fly to for
refuge Well Im agoin ter be that rock Timothy I am I am she
vowed as she turned and led Pollyanna up the broad steps



CHAPTER IV THE LITTLE ATTIC ROOM

Miss Polly Harrington did not rise to meet her niece She looked up
from her book it is true as Nancy and the little girl appeared in the
sittingroom doorway and she held out a hand with duty written large
on every coldly extended finger

How do you do Pollyanna I She had no chance to say more
Pollyanna had fairly flown across the room and flung herself into her
aunts scandalized unyielding lap

Oh Aunt Polly Aunt Polly I dont know how to be glad enough that
you let me come to live with you she was sobbing You dont know how
perfectly lovely it is to have you and Nancy and all this after youve
had just the Ladies Aid

Very likelythough Ive not had the pleasure of the Ladies Aids
acquaintance rejoined Miss Polly stiffly trying to unclasp the
small clinging fingers and turning frowning eyes on Nancy in the
doorway Nancy that will do You may go Pollyanna be good enough
please to stand erect in a proper manner I dont know yet what you
look like

Pollyanna drew back at once laughing a little hysterically

No I suppose you dont but you see Im not very much to look at
anyway on account of the freckles Oh and I ought to explain about the
red gingham and the black velvet basque with white spots on the elbows
I told Nancy how father said

Yes well never mind now what your father said interrupted Miss
Polly crisply You had a trunk I presume

Oh yes indeed Aunt Polly Ive got a beautiful trunk that the
Ladies Aid gave me I havent got so very much in itof my own I
mean The barrels havent had many clothes for little girls in them
lately but there were all fathers books and Mrs White said she
thought I ought to have those You see father

Pollyanna interrupted her aunt again sharply there is one thing
that might just as well be understood right away at once and that is I
do not care to have you keep talking of your father to me

The little girl drew in her breath tremulously

Why Aunt Polly youyou mean She hesitated and her aunt filled
the pause

We will go upstairs to your room Your trunk is already there I
presume I told Timothy to take it upif you had one You may follow
me Pollyanna

Without speaking Pollyanna turned and followed her aunt from the room
Her eyes were brimming with tears but her chin was bravely high

After all II reckon Im glad she doesnt want me to talk about
father Pollyanna was thinking Itll be easier maybeif I dont
talk about him Probably anyhow that is why she told me not to talk
about him And Pollyanna convinced anew of her aunts kindness
blinked off the tears and looked eagerly about her

She was on the stairway now Just ahead her aunts black silk skirt
rustled luxuriously Behind her an open door allowed a glimpse of
softtinted rugs and satincovered chairs Beneath her feet a marvellous
carpet was like green moss to the tread On every side the gilt of
picture frames or the glint of sunlight through the filmy mesh of lace
curtains flashed in her eyes

Oh Aunt Polly Aunt Polly breathed the little girl rapturously
what a perfectly lovely lovely house How awfully glad you must be
youre so rich

PollyANNA ejaculated her aunt turning sharply about as she reached
the head of the stairs Im surprised at youmaking a speech like that
to me

Why Aunt Polly ARENT you queried Pollyanna in frank wonder

Certainly not Pollyanna I hope I could not so far forget myself as to
be sinfully proud of any gift the Lord has seen fit to bestow upon me
declared the lady certainly not of RICHES

Miss Polly turned and walked down the hall toward the attic stairway
door She was glad now that she had put the child in the attic room
Her idea at first had been to get her niece as far away as possible from
herself and at the same time place her where her childish heedlessness
would not destroy valuable furnishings Nowwith this evident strain of
vanity showing thus earlyit was all the more fortunate that the room
planned for her was plain and sensible thought Miss Polly

Eagerly Pollyannas small feet pattered behind her aunt Still more
eagerly her big blue eyes tried to look in all directions at once that
no thing of beauty or interest in this wonderful house might be passed
unseen Most eagerly of all her mind turned to the wondrously exciting
problem about to be solved behind which of all these fascinating doors
was waiting now her roomthe dear beautiful room full of curtains
rugs and pictures that was to be her very own Then abruptly her
aunt opened a door and ascended another stairway

There was little to be seen here A bare wall rose on either side At
the top of the stairs wide reaches of shadowy space led to far corners
where the roof came almost down to the floor and where were
stacked innumerable trunks and boxes It was hot and stifling too
Unconsciously Pollyanna lifted her head higherit seemed so hard to
breathe Then she saw that her aunt had thrown open a door at the right

There Pollyanna here is your room and your trunk is here I see
Have you your key

Pollyanna nodded dumbly Her eyes were a little wide and frightened

Her aunt frowned

When I ask a question Pollyanna I prefer that you should answer aloud
not merely with your head

Yes Aunt Polly

Thank you that is better I believe you have everything that you
need here she added glancing at the wellfilled towel rack and water
pitcher I will send Nancy up to help you unpack Supper is at six
oclock she finished as she left the room and swept downstairs

For a moment after she had gone Pollyanna stood quite still looking
after her Then she turned her wide eyes to the bare wall the bare
floor the bare windows She turned them last to the little trunk that
had stood not so long before in her own little room in the faraway
Western home The next moment she stumbled blindly toward it and fell on
her knees at its side covering her face with her hands

Nancy found her there when she came up a few minutes later

There there you poor lamb she crooned dropping to the floor and
drawing the little girl into her arms I was just afearin Id find
you like this like this

Pollyanna shook her head

But Im bad and wicked Nancyawful wicked she sobbed I just cant
make myself understand that God and the angels needed my father more
than I did

No more they did neither declared Nancy stoutly

OhhNANCY The burning horror in Pollyannas eyes dried the tears

Nancy gave a shamefaced smile and rubbed her own eyes vigorously

There there child I didnt mean it of course she cried briskly
Come lets have your key and well get inside this trunk and take out
your dresses in no time no time

Somewhat tearfully Pollyanna produced the key

There arent very many there anyway she faltered

Then theyre all the sooner unpacked declared Nancy

Pollyanna gave a sudden radiant smile

Thats so I can be glad of that cant I she cried

Nancy stared

Why ofcourse she answered a little uncertainly

Nancys capable hands made short work of unpacking the books the
patched undergarments and the few pitifully unattractive dresses
Pollyanna smiling bravely now flew about hanging the dresses in
the closet stacking the books on the table and putting away the
undergarments in the bureau drawers

Im sure itits going to be a very nice room Dont you think so
she stammered after a while

There was no answer Nancy was very busy apparently with her head in
the trunk Pollyanna standing at the bureau gazed a little wistfully
at the bare wall above

And I can be glad there isnt any lookingglass here too cause where
there ISNT any glass I cant see my freckles

Nancy made a sudden queer little sound with her mouthbut when
Pollyanna turned her head was in the trunk again At one of the
windows a few minutes later Pollyanna gave a glad cry and clapped her
hands joyously

Oh Nancy I hadnt seen this before she breathed Lookway off
there with those trees and the houses and that lovely church spire and
the river shining just like silver Why Nancy there doesnt anybody
need any pictures with that to look at Oh Im so glad now she let me
have this room

To Pollyannas surprise and dismay Nancy burst into tears Pollyanna
hurriedly crossed to her side

Why Nancy Nancywhat is it she cried then fearfully This
wasntYOUR room was it

My room stormed Nancy hotly choking back the tears If you aint
a little angel straight from Heaven and if some folks dont eat dirt
beforeOh land theres her bell After which amazing speech Nancy
sprang to her feet dashed out of the room and went clattering down the
stairs

Left alone Pollyanna went back to her picture as she mentally
designated the beautiful view from the window After a time she touched
the sash tentatively It seemed as if no longer could she endure the
stifling heat To her joy the sash moved under her fingers The next
moment the window was wide open and Pollyanna was leaning far out
drinking in the fresh sweet air

She ran then to the other window That too soon flew up under her
eager hands A big fly swept past her nose and buzzed noisily about
the room Then another came and another but Pollyanna paid no heed
Pollyanna had made a wonderful discoveryagainst this window a
huge tree flung great branches To Pollyanna they looked like arms
outstretched inviting her Suddenly she laughed aloud

I believe I can do it she chuckled The next moment she had climbed
nimbly to the window ledge From there it was an easy matter to step to
the nearest treebranch Then clinging like a monkey she swung herself
from limb to limb until the lowest branch was reached The drop to the
ground waseven for Pollyanna who was used to climbing treesa little
fearsome She took it however with bated breath swinging from her
strong little arms and landing on all fours in the soft grass Then she
picked herself up and looked eagerly about her

She was at the back of the house Before her lay a garden in which a
bent old man was working Beyond the garden a little path through an
open field led up a steep hill at the top of which a lone pine tree
stood on guard beside the huge rock To Pollyanna at the moment there
seemed to be just one place in the world worth being inthe top of that
big rock

With a run and a skilful turn Pollyanna skipped by the bent old man
threaded her way between the orderly rows of green growing things
anda little out of breathreached the path that ran through the open
field Then determinedly she began to climb Already however she was
thinking what a long long way off that rock must be when back at the
window it had looked so near


Fifteen minutes later the great clock in the hallway of the Harrington
homestead struck six At precisely the last stroke Nancy sounded the
bell for supper

One two three minutes passed Miss Polly frowned and tapped the floor
with her slipper A little jerkily she rose to her feet went into the
hall and looked upstairs plainly impatient For a minute she listened
intently then she turned and swept into the dining room

Nancy she said with decision as soon as the little servingmaid
appeared my niece is late No you need not call her she added
severely as Nancy made a move toward the hall door I told her what
time supper was and now she will have to suffer the consequences She
may as well begin at once to learn to be punctual When she comes down
she may have bread and milk in the kitchen

Yes maam It was well perhaps that Miss Polly did not happen to be
looking at Nancys face just then

At the earliest possible moment after supper Nancy crept up the back
stairs and thence to the attic room

Bread and milk indeedand when the poor lamb haint only just cried
herself to sleep she was muttering fiercely as she softly pushed open
the door The next moment she gave a frightened cry Where are you
Whereve you gone Where HAVE you gone she panted looking in the
closet under the bed and even in the trunk and down the water pitcher
Then she flew downstairs and out to Old Tom in the garden

Mr Tom Mr Tom that blessed childs gone she wailed Shes
vanished right up into Heaven where she come from poor lamband me
told ter give her bread and milk in the kitchenher whats eatin angel
food this minute Ill warrant Ill warrant

The old man straightened up

Gone Heaven he repeated stupidly unconsciously sweeping the
brilliant sunset sky with his gaze He stopped stared a moment
intently then turned with a slow grin Well Nancy it do look like as
if shed tried ter get as nigh Heaven as she could and thats a fact
he agreed pointing with a crooked finger to where sharply outlined
against the reddening sky a slender windblown figure was poised on
top of a huge rock

Well she aint goin ter Heaven that way ternightnot if I has my
say declared Nancy doggedly If the mistress asks tell her I aint
furgettin the dishes but I gone on a stroll she flung back over her
shoulder as she sped toward the path that led through the open field



CHAPTER V THE GAME

For the lands sake Miss Pollyanna what a scare you did give me
panted Nancy hurrying up to the big rock down which Pollyanna had just
regretfully slid

Scare Oh Im so sorry but you mustnt really ever get scared about
me Nancy Father and the Ladies Aid used to do it too till they
found I always came back all right

But I didnt even know youd went cried Nancy tucking the little
girls hand under her arm and hurrying her down the hill I didnt see
you go and nobody didnt I guess you flew right up through the roof I
do I do

Pollyanna skipped gleefully

I did mostonly I flew down instead of up I came down the tree

Nancy stopped short

You didwhat

Came down the tree outside my window

My stars and stockings gasped Nancy hurrying on again Id like ter
know what yer aunt would say ter that

Would you Well Ill tell her then so you can find out promised
the little girl cheerfully

Mercy gasped Nancy Nono

Why you dont mean shed CARE cried Pollyanna plainly disturbed

Noeryeswell never mind II aint so very particular about
knowin what shed say truly stammered Nancy determined to keep one
scolding from Pollyanna if nothing more But say we better hurry
Ive got ter get them dishes done ye know

Ill help promised Pollyanna promptly

Oh Miss Pollyanna demurred Nancy

For a moment there was silence The sky was darkening fast Pollyanna
took a firmer hold of her friends arm

I reckon Im glad after all that you DID get scareda little cause
then you came after me she shivered

Poor little lamb And you must be hungry too IIm afraid youll
have ter have bread and milk in the kitchen with me Yer aunt didnt
like itbecause you didnt come down ter supper ye know

But I couldnt I was up here

Yes butshe didnt know that you see observed Nancy dryly
stifling a chuckle Im sorry about the bread and milk I am I am

Oh Im not Im glad

Glad Why

Why I like bread and milk and Id like to eat with you I dont see
any trouble about being glad about that

You dont seem ter see any trouble bein glad about everythin
retorted Nancy choking a little over her remembrance of Pollyannas
brave attempts to like the bare little attic room

Pollyanna laughed softly

Well thats the game you know anyway

TheGAME

Yes the just being glad game

Whatever in the world are you talkin about

Why its a game Father told it to me and its lovely rejoined
Pollyanna Weve played it always ever since I was a little little
girl I told the Ladies Aid and they played itsome of them

What is it I aint much on games though

Pollyanna laughed again but she sighed too and in the gathering
twilight her face looked thin and wistful

Why we began it on some crutches that came in a missionary barrel

CRUTCHES

Yes You see Id wanted a doll and father had written them so but
when the barrel came the lady wrote that there hadnt any dolls come in
but the little crutches had So she sent em along as they might come in
handy for some child sometime And thats when we began it

Well I must say I cant see any game about that about that declared
Nancy almost irritably

Oh yes the game was to just find something about everything to be
glad aboutno matter what twas rejoined Pollyanna earnestly And
we began right thenon the crutches

Well goodness me I cant see anythin ter be glad aboutgettin a
pair of crutches when you wanted a doll

Pollyanna clapped her hands

There isthere is she crowed But _I_ couldnt see it either
Nancy at first she added with quick honesty Father had to tell it
to me

Well then suppose YOU tell ME almost snapped Nancy

Goosey Why just be glad because you dontNEEDEM exulted
Pollyanna triumphantly You see its just as easywhen you know how

Well of all the queer doins breathed Nancy regarding Pollyanna
with almost fearful eyes

Oh but it isnt queerits lovely maintained Pollyanna
enthusiastically And weve played it ever since And the harder tis
the more fun tis to get em out onlyonly sometimes its almost too
hardlike when your father goes to Heaven and there isnt anybody but
a Ladies Aid left

Yes or when youre put in a snippy little room way at the top of the
house with nothin in it growled Nancy

Pollyanna sighed

That was a hard one at first she admitted specially when I was so
kind of lonesome I just didnt feel like playing the game anyway and
I HAD been wanting pretty things so Then I happened to think how I
hated to see my freckles in the lookingglass and I saw that lovely
picture out the window too so then I knew Id found the things to be
glad about You see when youre hunting for the glad things you sort
of forget the other kindlike the doll you wanted you know

Humph choked Nancy trying to swallow the lump in her throat

Most generally it doesnt take so long sighed Pollyanna and lots of
times now I just think of them WITHOUT thinking you know Ive got so
used to playing it Its a lovely game Ffather and I used to like it
so much she faltered I suppose though ititll be a little harder
now as long as I havent anybody to play it with Maybe Aunt Polly will
play it though she added as an afterthought

My stars and stockingsHER breathed Nancy behind her teeth Then
aloud she said doggedly See here Miss Pollyanna I aint sayin that
Ill play it very well and I aint sayin that I know how anyway but
Ill play it with ye after a fashionI just will I will

Oh Nancy exulted Pollyanna giving her a rapturous hug Thatll be
splendid Wont we have fun

Ermaybe conceded Nancy in open doubt But you mustnt count too
much on me ye know I never was no case fur games but Im agoin ter
make a most awful old try on this one Youre goin ter have some one
ter play it with anyhow she finished as they entered the kitchen
together

Pollyanna ate her bread and milk with good appetite then at Nancys
suggestion she went into the sitting room where her aunt sat reading
Miss Polly looked up coldly

Have you had your supper Pollyanna

Yes Aunt Polly

Im very sorry Pollyanna to have been obliged so soon to send you
into the kitchen to eat bread and milk

But I was real glad you did it Aunt Polly I like bread and milk and
Nancy too You mustnt feel bad about that one bit

Aunt Polly sat suddenly a little more erect in her chair

Pollyanna its quite time you were in bed You have had a hard day
and tomorrow we must plan your hours and go over your clothing to see
what it is necessary to get for you Nancy will give you a candle Be
careful how you handle it Breakfast will be at halfpast seven See
that you are down to that Goodnight

Quite as a matter of course Pollyanna came straight to her aunts side
and gave her an affectionate hug

Ive had such a beautiful time so far she sighed happily I know
Im going to just love living with you but then I knew I should before
I came Goodnight she called cheerfully as she ran from the room

Well upon my soul ejaculated Miss Polly half aloud What a most
extraordinary child Then she frowned Shes glad I punished her
and I mustnt feel bad one bit and shes going to love to live with
me Well upon my soul ejaculated Miss Polly again as she took up her
book

Fifteen minutes later in the attic room a lonely little girl sobbed
into the tightlyclutched sheet

I know fatheramongtheangels Im not playing the game one bit
nownot one bit but I dont believe even you could find anything to be
glad about sleeping all alone way off up here in the darklike this
If only I was near Nancy or Aunt Polly or even a Ladies Aider it
would be easier

Downstairs in the kitchen Nancy hurrying with her belated work
jabbed her dishmop into the milk pitcher and muttered jerkily

If playin a sillyfool gameabout bein glad youve got crutches
when you want dollsis got ter bemy wayo bein that rock o
refugewhy Im agoin ter play itI am I am



CHAPTER VI A QUESTION OF DUTY

It was nearly seven oclock when Pollyanna awoke that first day after
her arrival Her windows faced the south and the west so she could not
see the sun yet but she could see the hazy blue of the morning sky and
she knew that the day promised to be a fair one

The little room was cooler now and the air blew in fresh and sweet
Outside the birds were twittering joyously and Pollyanna flew to the
window to talk to them She saw then that down in the garden her aunt
was already out among the rosebushes With rapid fingers therefore she
made herself ready to join her

Down the attic stairs sped Pollyanna leaving both doors wide open
Through the hall down the next flight then bang through the front
screeneddoor and around to the garden she ran

Aunt Polly with the bent old man was leaning over a rosebush when
Pollyanna gurgling with delight flung herself upon her

Oh Aunt Polly Aunt Polly I reckon I am glad this morning just to be
alive

PollyANNA remonstrated the lady sternly pulling herself as erect
as she could with a dragging weight of ninety pounds hanging about her
neck Is this the usual way you say good morning

The little girl dropped to her toes and danced lightly up and down

No only when I love folks so I just cant help it I saw you from
my window Aunt Polly and I got to thinking how you WERENT a Ladies
Aider and you were my really truly aunt and you looked so good I just
had to come down and hug you

The bent old man turned his back suddenly Miss Polly attempted a
frownwith not her usual success

Pollyanna youI Thomas that will do for this morning I think you
understandabout those rosebushes she said stiffly Then she turned
and walked rapidly away

Do you always work in the garden MrMan asked Pollyanna
interestedly

The man turned His lips were twitching but his eyes looked blurred as
if with tears

Yes Miss Im Old Tom the gardener he answered Timidly but as if
impelled by an irresistible force he reached out a shaking hand and let
it rest for a moment on her bright hair You are so like your mother
little Miss I used ter know her when she was even littler than you be
You see I used ter work in the gardenthen

Pollyanna caught her breath audibly

You did And you knew my mother reallywhen she was just a little
earth angel and not a Heaven one Oh please tell me about her And
down plumped Pollyanna in the middle of the dirt path by the old mans
side

A bell sounded from the house The next moment Nancy was seen flying out
the back door

Miss Pollyanna that bell means breakfastmornins she panted
pulling the little girl to her feet and hurrying her back to the house
and other times it means other meals But it always means that
youre ter run like time when ye hear it no matter where ye be If ye
dontwell itll take somethin smartern we be ter find ANYTHIN ter
be glad about in that she finished shooing Pollyanna into the house
as she would shoo an unruly chicken into a coop

Breakfast for the first five minutes was a silent meal then Miss
Polly her disapproving eyes following the airy wings of two flies
darting here and there over the table said sternly

Nancy where did those flies come from

I dont know maam There wasnt one in the kitchen Nancy had been
too excited to notice Pollyannas upflung windows the afternoon before

I reckon maybe theyre my flies Aunt Polly observed Pollyanna
amiably There were lots of them this morning having a beautiful time
upstairs

Nancy left the room precipitately though to do so she had to carry out
the hot muffins she had just brought in

Yours gasped Miss Polly What do you mean Where did they come
from

Why Aunt Polly they came from out of doors of course through the
windows I SAW some of them come in

You saw them You mean you raised those windows without any screens

Why yes There werent any screens there Aunt Polly

Nancy at this moment came in again with the muffins Her face was
grave but very red

Nancy directed her mistress sharply you may set the muffins down
and go at once to Miss Pollyannas room and shut the windows Shut the
doors also Later when your morning work is done go through every
room with the spatter See that you make a thorough search

To her niece she said

Pollyanna I have ordered screens for those windows I knew of course
that it was my duty to do that But it seems to me that you have quite
forgotten YOUR duty

Myduty Pollyannas eyes were wide with wonder

Certainly I know it is warm but I consider it your duty to keep your
windows closed till those screens come Flies Pollyanna are not only
unclean and annoying but very dangerous to health After breakfast I
will give you a little pamphlet on this matter to read

To read Oh thank you Aunt Polly I love to read

Miss Polly drew in her breath audibly then she shut her lips together
hard Pollyanna seeing her stern face frowned a little thoughtfully

Of course Im sorry about the duty I forgot Aunt Polly she
apologized timidly I wont raise the windows again

Her aunt made no reply She did not speak indeed until the meal was
over Then she rose went to the bookcase in the sitting room took out
a small paper booklet and crossed the room to her nieces side

This is the article I spoke of Pollyanna I desire you to go to your
room at once and read it I will be up in half an hour to look over your
things

Pollyanna her eyes on the illustration of a flys head many times
magnified cried joyously

Oh thank you Aunt Polly The next moment she skipped merrily from
the room banging the door behind her

Miss Polly frowned hesitated then crossed the room majestically and
opened the door but Pollyanna was already out of sight clattering up
the attic stairs

Half an hour later when Miss Polly her face expressing stern duty in
every line climbed those stairs and entered Pollyannas room she was
greeted with a burst of eager enthusiasm

Oh Aunt Polly I never saw anything so perfectly lovely and
interesting in my life Im so glad you gave me that book to read Why
I didnt suppose flies could carry such a lot of things on their feet
and

That will do observed Aunt Polly with dignity Pollyanna you may
bring out your clothes now and I will look them over What are not
suitable for you I shall give to the Sullivans of course

With visible reluctance Pollyanna laid down the pamphlet and turned
toward the closet

Im afraid youll think theyre worse than the Ladies Aid didand
THEY said they were shameful she sighed But there were mostly things
for boys and older folks in the last two or three barrels anddid you
ever have a missionary barrel Aunt Polly

At her aunts look of shocked anger Pollyanna corrected herself at
once

Why no of course you didnt Aunt Polly she hurried on with a
hot blush I forgot rich folks never have to have them But you see
sometimes I kind of forget that you are richup here in this room you
know

Miss Pollys lips parted indignantly but no words came Pollyanna
plainly unaware that she had said anything in the least unpleasant was
hurrying on

Well as I was going to say you cant tell a thing about missionary
barrelsexcept that you wont find in em what you think youre going
toeven when you think you wont It was the barrels every time too
that were hardest to play the game on for father and

Just in time Pollyanna remembered that she was not to talk of her father
to her aunt She dived into her closet then hurriedly and brought out
all the poor little dresses in both her arms

They arent nice at all she choked and theyd been black if it
hadnt been for the red carpet for the church but theyre all Ive
got

With the tips of her fingers Miss Polly turned over the conglomerate
garments so obviously made for anybody but Pollyanna Next she bestowed
frowning attention on the patched undergarments in the bureau drawers

Ive got the best ones on confessed Pollyanna anxiously The
Ladies Aid bought me one set straight through all whole Mrs
Jonesshes the presidenttold em I should have that if they had to
clatter down bare aisles themselves the rest of their days But they
wont Mr White doesnt like the noise Hes got nerves his wife says
but hes got money too and they expect hell give a lot toward the
carpeton account of the nerves you know I should think hed be glad
that if he did have the nerves hed got money too shouldnt you

Miss Polly did not seem to hear Her scrutiny of the undergarments
finished she turned to Pollyanna somewhat abruptly

You have been to school of course Pollyanna

Oh yes Aunt Polly Besides fathI mean I was taught at home some
too

Miss Polly frowned

Very good In the fall you will enter school here of course Mr
Hall the principal will doubtless settle in which grade you belong
Meanwhile I suppose I ought to hear you read aloud half an hour each
day

I love to read but if you dont want to hear me Id be just glad to
read to myselftruly Aunt Polly And I wouldnt have to half try to be
glad either for I like best to read to myselfon account of the big
words you know

I dont doubt it rejoined Miss Polly grimly Have you studied
music

Not much I dont like my musicI like other peoples though
I learned to play on the piano a little Miss Grayshe plays for
churchshe taught me But Id just as soon let that go as not Aunt
Polly Id rather truly

Very likely observed Aunt Polly with slightly uplifted eyebrows
Nevertheless I think it is my duty to see that you are properly
instructed in at least the rudiments of music You sew of course

Yes maam Pollyanna sighed The Ladies Aid taught me that But I
had an awful time Mrs Jones didnt believe in holding your needle
like the rest of em did on buttonholing and Mrs White thought
backstitching ought to be taught you before hemming or else the other
way and Mrs Harriman didnt believe in putting you on patchwork ever
at all

Well there will be no difficulty of that kind any longer Pollyanna I
shall teach you sewing myself of course You do not know how to cook I
presume

Pollyanna laughed suddenly

They were just beginning to teach me that this summer but I hadnt
got far They were more divided up on that than they were on the sewing
They were GOING to begin on bread but there wasnt two of em that made
it alike so after arguing it all one sewingmeeting they decided to
take turns at me one forenoon a weekin their own kitchens you know
Id only learned chocolate fudge and fig cake though whenwhen I had
to stop Her voice broke

Chocolate fudge and fig cake indeed scorned Miss Polly I think
we can remedy that very soon She paused in thought for a minute then
went on slowly At nine oclock every morning you will read aloud one
halfhour to me Before that you will use the time to put this room in
order Wednesday and Saturday forenoons after halfpast nine you will
spend with Nancy in the kitchen learning to cook Other mornings you
will sew with me That will leave the afternoons for your music I
shall of course procure a teacher at once for you she finished
decisively as she arose from her chair

Pollyanna cried out in dismay

Oh but Aunt Polly Aunt Polly you havent left me any time at all
just toto live

To live child What do you mean As if you werent living all the
time

Oh of course Id be BREATHING all the time I was doing those things
Aunt Polly but I wouldnt be living You breathe all the time youre
asleep but you arent living I mean livingdoing the things you want
to do playing outdoors reading to myself of course climbing hills
talking to Mr Tom in the garden and Nancy and finding out all about
the houses and the people and everything everywhere all through the
perfectly lovely streets I came through yesterday Thats what I call
living Aunt Polly Just breathing isnt living

Miss Polly lifted her head irritably

Pollyanna you ARE the most extraordinary child You will be allowed a
proper amount of playtime of course But surely it seems to me if
I am willing to do my duty in seeing that you have proper care and
instruction YOU ought to be willing to do yours by seeing that that
care and instruction are not ungratefully wasted

Pollyanna looked shocked

Oh Aunt Polly as if I ever could be ungratefulto YOU Why I LOVE
YOUand you arent even a Ladies Aider youre an aunt

Very well then see that you dont act ungrateful vouchsafed Miss
Polly as she turned toward the door

She had gone halfway down the stairs when a small unsteady voice called
after her

Please Aunt Polly you didnt tell me which of my things you wanted
toto give away

Aunt Polly emitted a tired sigha sigh that ascended straight to
Pollyannas ears

Oh I forgot to tell you Pollyanna Timothy will drive us into town
at halfpast one this afternoon Not one of your garments is fit for my
niece to wear Certainly I should be very far from doing my duty by you
if I should let you appear out in any one of them

Pollyanna sighed nowshe believed she was going to hate that
wordduty

Aunt Polly please she called wistfully isnt there ANY way you can
be glad about all thatduty business

What Miss Polly looked up in dazed surprise then suddenly with
very red cheeks she turned and swept angrily down the stairs Dont be
impertinent Pollyanna

In the hot little attic room Pollyanna dropped herself on to one of the
straightbacked chairs To her existence loomed ahead one endless round
of duty

I dont see really what there was impertinent about that she
sighed I was only asking her if she couldnt tell me something to be
glad about in all that duty business

For several minutes Pollyanna sat in silence her rueful eyes fixed
on the forlorn heap of garments on the bed Then slowly she rose and
began to put away the dresses

There just isnt anything to be glad about that I can see she said
aloud unlessits to be glad when the dutys done Whereupon she
laughed suddenly



CHAPTER VII POLLYANNA AND PUNISHMENTS

At halfpast one oclock Timothy drove Miss Polly and her niece to the
four or five principal dry goods stores which were about half a mile
from the homestead

Fitting Pollyanna with a new wardrobe proved to be more or less of an
exciting experience for all concerned Miss Polly came out of it with
the feeling of limp relaxation that one might have at finding oneself at
last on solid earth after a perilous walk across the very thin crust of
a volcano The various clerks who had waited upon the pair came out of
it with very red faces and enough amusing stories of Pollyanna to
keep their friends in gales of laughter the rest of the week Pollyanna
herself came out of it with radiant smiles and a heart content for as
she expressed it to one of the clerks When you havent had anybody
but missionary barrels and Ladies Aiders to dress you it IS perfectly
lovely to just walk right in and buy clothes that are brandnew and
that dont have to be tucked up or let down because they dont fit

The shopping expedition consumed the entire afternoon then came supper
and a delightful talk with Old Tom in the garden and another with Nancy
on the back porch after the dishes were done and while Aunt Polly paid
a visit to a neighbor

Old Tom told Pollyanna wonderful things of her mother that made her
very happy indeed and Nancy told her all about the little farm six
miles away at The Corners where lived her own dear mother and her
equally dear brother and sisters She promised too that sometime if
Miss Polly were willing Pollyanna should be taken to see them

And THEYVE got lovely names too Youll like THEIR names sighed
Nancy Theyre Algernon and Florabelle and Estelle II just
hate Nancy

Oh Nancy what a dreadful thing to say Why

Because it isnt pretty like the others You see I was the first baby
and mother hadnt begun ter read so many stories with the pretty names
in em then

But I love Nancy just because its you declared Pollyanna

Humph Well I guess you could love Clarissa Mabelle just as well
retorted Nancy and it would be a heap happier for me I think THAT
names just grand

Pollyanna laughed

Well anyhow she chuckled you can be glad it isnt Hephzibah

Hephzibah

Yes Mrs Whites name is that Her husband calls her Hep and she
doesnt like it She says when he calls out HepHep she feels just
as if the next minute he was going to yell Hurrah And she doesnt
like to be hurrahed at

Nancys gloomy face relaxed into a broad smile

Well if you dont beat the Dutch Say do you knowI shant never
hear Nancy now that I dont think o that HepHep and giggle My
I guess I AM glad She stopped short and turned amazed eyes on the
little girl Say Miss Pollyanna do you meanwas you playin that
ere game THENabout my bein glad I want named Hephzibah

Pollyanna frowned then she laughed

Why Nancy thats so I WAS playing the gamebut thats one of the
times I just did it without thinking I reckon You see you DO lots
of times you get so used to itlooking for something to be glad about
you know And most generally there is something about everything that
you can be glad about if you keep hunting long enough to find it

Well mmaybe granted Nancy with open doubt


At halfpast eight Pollyanna went up to bed The screens had not yet
come and the close little room was like an oven With longing eyes
Pollyanna looked at the two fastclosed windowsbut she did not raise
them She undressed folded her clothes neatly said her prayers blew
out her candle and climbed into bed

Just how long she lay in sleepless misery tossing from side to side of
the hot little cot she did not know but it seemed to her that it must
have been hours before she finally slipped out of bed felt her way
across the room and opened her door

Out in the main attic all was velvet blackness save where the moon flung
a path of silver halfway across the floor from the east dormer window
With a resolute ignoring of that fearsome darkness to the right and to
the left Pollyanna drew a quick breath and pattered straight into that
silvery path and on to the window

She had hoped vaguely that this window might have a screen but it did
not Outside however there was a wide world of fairylike beauty and
there was too she knew fresh sweet air that would feel so good to
hot cheeks and hands

As she stepped nearer and peered longingly out she saw something else
she saw only a little way below the window the wide flat tin roof of
Miss Pollys sun parlor built over the portecochere The sight filled
her with longing If only now she were out there

Fearfully she looked behind her Back there somewhere were her hot
little room and her still hotter bed but between her and them lay a
horrid desert of blackness across which one must feel ones way with
outstretched shrinking arms while before her out on the sunparlor
roof were the moonlight and the cool sweet night air

If only her bed were out there And folks did sleep out of doors Joel
Hartley at home who was so sick with the consumption HAD to sleep out
of doors

Suddenly Pollyanna remembered that she had seen near this attic window
a row of long white bags hanging from nails Nancy had said that
they contained the winter clothing put away for the summer A little
fearfully now Pollyanna felt her way to these bags selected a nice
fat soft one it contained Miss Pollys sealskin coat for a bed and a
thinner one to be doubled up for a pillow and still another which was
so thin it seemed almost empty for a covering Thus equipped Pollyanna
in high glee pattered to the moonlit window again raised the sash
stuffed her burden through to the roof below then let herself down
after it closing the window carefully behind herPollyanna had not
forgotten those flies with the marvellous feet that carried things

How deliciously cool it was Pollyanna quite danced up and down with
delight drawing in long full breaths of the refreshing air The tin
roof under her feet crackled with little resounding snaps that Pollyanna
rather liked She walked indeed two or three times back and forth from
end to endit gave her such a pleasant sensation of airy space after
her hot little room and the roof was so broad and flat that she had no
fear of falling off Finally with a sigh of content she curled herself
up on the sealskincoat mattress arranged one bag for a pillow and the
other for a covering and settled herself to sleep

Im so glad now that the screens didnt come she murmured blinking
up at the stars else I couldnt have had this

Downstairs in Miss Pollys room next the sun parlor Miss Polly
herself was hurrying into dressing gown and slippers her face white and
frightened A minute before she had been telephoning in a shaking voice
to Timothy

Come up quickyou and your father Bring lanterns Somebody is on
the roof of the sun parlor He must have climbed up the rosetrellis
or somewhere and of course he can get right into the house through the
east window in the attic I have locked the attic door down herebut
hurry quick

Some time later Pollyanna just dropping off to sleep was startled by
a lantern flash and a trio of amazed ejaculations She opened her eyes
to find Timothy at the top of a ladder near her Old Tom just getting
through the window and her aunt peering out at her from behind him

Pollyanna what does this mean cried Aunt Polly then

Pollyanna blinked sleepy eyes and sat up

Why Mr TomAunt Polly she stammered Dont look so scared It
isnt that Ive got the consumption you know like Joel Hartley Its
only that I was so hotin there But I shut the window Aunt Polly so
the flies couldnt carry those germthings in

Timothy disappeared suddenly down the ladder Old Tom with almost equal
precipitation handed his lantern to Miss Polly and followed his son
Miss Polly bit her lip harduntil the men were gone then she said
sternly

Pollyanna hand those things to me at once and come in here Of all
the extraordinary children she ejaculated a little later as with
Pollyanna by her side and the lantern in her hand she turned back into
the attic

To Pollyanna the air was all the more stifling after that cool breath
of the out of doors but she did not complain She only drew a long
quivering sigh

At the top of the stairs Miss Polly jerked out crisply

For the rest of the night Pollyanna you are to sleep in my bed with
me The screens will be here tomorrow but until then I consider it my
duty to keep you where I know where you are

Pollyanna drew in her breath

With youin your bed she cried rapturously Oh Aunt Polly Aunt
Polly how perfectly lovely of you And when Ive so wanted to sleep
with some one sometimesome one that belonged to me you know not a
Ladies Aider Ive HAD them My I reckon I am glad now those screens
didnt come Wouldnt you be

There was no reply Miss Polly was stalking on ahead Miss Polly to
tell the truth was feeling curiously helpless For the third time since
Pollyannas arrival Miss Polly was punishing Pollyannaand for the
third time she was being confronted with the amazing fact that her
punishment was being taken as a special reward of merit No wonder Miss
Polly was feeling curiously helpless



CHAPTER VIII POLLYANNA PAYS A VISIT

It was not long before life at the Harrington homestead settled into
something like orderthough not exactly the order that Miss Polly had
at first prescribed Pollyanna sewed practised read aloud and studied
cooking in the kitchen it is true but she did not give to any of these
things quite so much time as had first been planned She had more time
also to just live as she expressed it for almost all of every
afternoon from two until six oclock was hers to do with as she
likedprovided she did not like to do certain things already
prohibited by Aunt Polly

It is a question perhaps whether all this leisure time was given to
the child as a relief to Pollyanna from workor as a relief to Aunt
Polly from Pollyanna Certainly as those first July days passed Miss
Polly found occasion many times to ejaculate What an extraordinary
child and certainly the reading and sewing lessons found her at their
conclusion each day somewhat dazed and wholly exhausted

Nancy in the kitchen fared better She was not dazed nor exhausted
Wednesdays and Saturdays came to be indeed redletter days to her

There were no children in the immediate neighborhood of the Harrington
homestead for Pollyanna to play with The house itself was on the
outskirts of the village and though there were other houses not far
away they did not chance to contain any boys or girls near Pollyannas
age This however did not seem to disturb Pollyanna in the least

Oh no I dont mind it at all she explained to Nancy Im happy
just to walk around and see the streets and the houses and watch the
people I just love people Dont you Nancy

Well I cant say I doall of em retorted Nancy tersely

Almost every pleasant afternoon found Pollyanna begging for an errand
to run so that she might be off for a walk in one direction or
another and it was on these walks that frequently she met the Man To
herself Pollyanna always called him the Man no matter if she met a
dozen other men the same day

The Man often wore a long black coat and a high silk hattwo things
that the just men never wore His face was clean shaven and rather
pale and his hair showing below his hat was somewhat gray He walked
erect and rather rapidly and he was always alone which made Pollyanna
vaguely sorry for him Perhaps it was because of this that she one day
spoke to him

How do you do sir Isnt this a nice day she called cheerily as she
approached him

The man threw a hurried glance about him then stopped uncertainly

Did you speakto me he asked in a sharp voice

Yes sir beamed Pollyanna I say its a nice day isnt it

Eh Oh Humph he grunted and strode on again

Pollyanna laughed He was such a funny man she thought

The next day she saw him again

Tisnt quite so nice as yesterday but its pretty nice she called
out cheerfully

Eh Oh Humph grunted the man as before and once again Pollyanna
laughed happily

When for the third time Pollyanna accosted him in much the same manner
the man stopped abruptly

See here child who are you and why are you speaking to me every
day

Im Pollyanna Whittier and I thought you looked lonesome Im so glad
you stopped Now were introducedonly I dont know your name yet

Well of all the The man did not finish his sentence but strode on
faster than ever

Pollyanna looked after him with a disappointed droop to her usually
smiling lips

Maybe he didnt understandbut that was only half an introduction I
dont know HIS name yet she murmured as she proceeded on her way

Pollyanna was carrying calfsfoot jelly to Mrs Snow today Miss Polly
Harrington always sent something to Mrs Snow once a week She said she
thought that it was her duty inasmuch as Mrs Snow was poor sick and
a member of her churchit was the duty of all the church members
to look out for her of course Miss Polly did her duty by Mrs Snow
usually on Thursday afternoonsnot personally but through Nancy
Today Pollyanna had begged the privilege and Nancy had promptly given
it to her in accordance with Miss Pollys orders

And its glad that I am ter get rid of it Nancy had declared in
private afterwards to Pollyanna though its a shame ter be tuckin the
job off on ter you poor lamb so it is it is

But Id love to do it Nancy

Well you wontafter youve done it once predicted Nancy sourly

Why not

Because nobody does If folks want sorry for her there wouldnt a
soul go near her from mornin till night shes that cantankerous All
is I pity her daughter what HAS ter take care of her

But why Nancy

Nancy shrugged her shoulders

Well in plain words its just that nothin what ever has happened
has happened right in Mis Snows eyes Even the days of the week aint
run ter her mind If its Monday shes bound ter say she wished twas
Sunday and if you take her jelly youre pretty sure ter hear she wanted
chickenbut if you DID bring her chicken shed be jest hankerin for
lamb broth

Why what a funny woman laughed Pollyanna I think I shall like
to go to see her She must be so surprising andand different I love
DIFFERENT folks

Humph Well Mis Snows different all rightI hope for the sake
of the rest of us Nancy had finished grimly

Pollyanna was thinking of these remarks today as she turned in at
the gate of the shabby little cottage Her eyes were quite sparkling
indeed at the prospect of meeting this different Mrs Snow

A palefaced tiredlooking young girl answered her knock at the door

How do you do began Pollyanna politely Im from Miss Polly
Harrington and Id like to see Mrs Snow please

Well if you would youre the first one that ever liked to see her
muttered the girl under her breath but Pollyanna did not hear this The
girl had turned and was leading the way through the hall to a door at
the end of it

In the sickroom after the girl had ushered her in and closed the door
Pollyanna blinked a little before she could accustom her eyes to the
gloom Then she saw dimly outlined a woman halfsitting up in the bed
across the room Pollyanna advanced at once

How do you do Mrs Snow Aunt Polly says she hopes you are comfortable
today and shes sent you some calfsfoot jelly

Dear me Jelly murmured a fretful voice Of course Im very much
obliged but I was hoping twould be lamb broth today

Pollyanna frowned a little

Why I thought it was CHICKEN you wanted when folks brought you jelly
she said

What The sick woman turned sharply

Why nothing much apologized Pollyanna hurriedly and of course
it doesnt really make any difference Its only that Nancy said it was
chicken you wanted when we brought jelly and lamb broth when we brought
chickenbut maybe twas the other way and Nancy forgot

The sick woman pulled herself up till she sat erect in the beda most
unusual thing for her to do though Pollyanna did not know this

Well Miss Impertinence who are you she demanded

Pollyanna laughed gleefully

Oh THAT isnt my name Mrs Snowand Im so glad tisnt too That
would be worse than Hephzibah wouldnt it Im Pollyanna Whittier
Miss Polly Harringtons niece and Ive come to live with her Thats
why Im here with the jelly this morning

All through the first part of this sentence the sick woman had sat
interestedly erect but at the reference to the jelly she fell back on
her pillow listlessly

Very well thank you Your aunt is very kind of course but my
appetite isnt very good this morning and I was wanting lamb She
stopped suddenly then went on with an abrupt change of subject I
never slept a wink last nightnot a wink

O dear I wish _I_ didnt sighed Pollyanna placing the jelly on the
little stand and seating herself comfortably in the nearest chair You
lose such a lot of time just sleeping Dont you think so

Lose timesleeping exclaimed the sick woman

Yes when you might be just living you know It seems such a pity we
cant live nights too

Once again the woman pulled herself erect in her bed

Well if you aint the amazing young one she cried Here do you go
to that window and pull up the curtain she directed I should like to
know what you look like

Pollyanna rose to her feet but she laughed a little ruefully

O dear then youll see my freckles wont you she sighed as she
went to the window and just when I was being so glad it was dark and
you couldnt see em There Now you canoh she broke off excitedly
as she turned back to the bed Im so glad you wanted to see me
because now I can see you They didnt tell me you were so pretty

Mepretty scoffed the woman bitterly

Why yes Didnt you know it cried Pollyanna

Well no I didnt retorted Mrs Snow dryly Mrs Snow had lived
forty years and for fifteen of those years she had been too busy
wishing things were different to find much time to enjoy things as they
were

Oh but your eyes are so big and dark and your hairs all dark too
and curly cooed Pollyanna I love black curls Thats one of the
things Im going to have when I get to Heaven And youve got two
little red spots in your cheeks Why Mrs Snow you ARE pretty I
should think youd know it when you looked at yourself in the glass

The glass snapped the sick woman falling back on her pillow Yes
well I haint done much prinkin before the mirror these daysand you
wouldnt if you was flat on your back as I am

Why no of course not agreed Pollyanna sympathetically But
waitjust let me show you she exclaimed skipping over to the bureau
and picking up a small handglass

On the way back to the bed she stopped eyeing the sick woman with a
critical gaze

I reckon maybe if you dont mind Id like to fix your hair just a
little before I let you see it she proposed May I fix your hair
please

Why Isuppose so if you want to permitted Mrs Snow grudgingly
but twont stay you know

Oh thank you I love to fix peoples hair exulted Pollyanna
carefully laying down the handglass and reaching for a comb I shant
do much today of courseIm in such a hurry for you to see how pretty
you are but some day Im going to take it all down and have a perfectly
lovely time with it she cried touching with soft fingers the waving
hair above the sick womans forehead

For five minutes Pollyanna worked swiftly deftly combing a refractory
curl into fluffiness perking up a drooping ruffle at the neck or
shaking a pillow into plumpness so that the head might have a better
pose Meanwhile the sick woman frowning prodigiously and openly
scoffing at the whole procedure was in spite of herself beginning to
tingle with a feeling perilously near to excitement

There panted Pollyanna hastily plucking a pink from a vase near by
and tucking it into the dark hair where it would give the best effect
Now I reckon were ready to be looked at And she held out the mirror
in triumph

Humph grunted the sick woman eyeing her reflection severely I like
red pinks better than pink ones but then itll fade anyhow before
night so whats the difference

But I should think youd be glad they did fade laughed Pollyanna
cause then you can have the fun of getting some more I just love your
hair fluffed out like that she finished with a satisfied gaze Dont
you

Hmm maybe Stilltwont last with me tossing back and forth on the
pillow as I do

Of course notand Im glad too nodded Pollyanna cheerfully
because then I can fix it again Anyhow I should think youd be glad
its blackblack shows up so much nicer on a pillow than yellow hair
like mine does

Maybe but I never did set much store by black hairshows gray too
soon retorted Mrs Snow She spoke fretfully but she still held the
mirror before her face

Oh I love black hair I should be so glad if I only had it sighed
Pollyanna

Mrs Snow dropped the mirror and turned irritably

Well you wouldntnot if you were me You wouldnt be glad for black
hair nor anything elseif you had to lie here all day as I do

Pollyanna bent her brows in a thoughtful frown

Why twould be kind of hardto do it then wouldnt it she mused
aloud

Do what

Be glad about things

Be glad about thingswhen youre sick in bed all your days Well I
should say it would retorted Mrs Snow If you dont think so just
tell me something to be glad about thats all

To Mrs Snows unbounded amazement Pollyanna sprang to her feet and
clapped her hands

Oh goody Thatll be a hard onewont it Ive got to go now but
Ill think and think all the way home and maybe the next time I come
I can tell it to you Goodby Ive had a lovely time Goodby she
called again as she tripped through the doorway

Well I never Now what does she mean by that ejaculated Mrs Snow
staring after her visitor By and by she turned her head and picked up
the mirror eyeing her reflection critically

That little thing HAS got a knack with hair and no mistake she
muttered under her breath I declare I didnt know it could look so
pretty But then whats the use she sighed dropping the little glass
into the bedclothes and rolling her head on the pillow fretfully

A little later when Milly Mrs Snows daughter came in the mirror
still lay among the bedclothesthought it had been carefully hidden from sight

Why motherthe curtain is up cried Milly dividing her amazed stare
between the window and the pink in her mothers hair

Well what if it is snapped the sick woman I neednt stay in the
dark all my life if I am sick need I

Why nno of course not rejoined Milly in hasty conciliation as
she reached for the medicine bottle Its onlywell you know very
well that Ive tried to get you to have a lighter room for ages and you
wouldnt

There was no reply to this Mrs Snow was picking at the lace on her
nightgown At last she spoke fretfully

I should think SOMEBODY might give me a new nightdressinstead of lamb
broth for a change

Whymother

No wonder Milly quite gasped aloud with bewilderment In the drawer
behind her at that moment lay two new nightdresses that Milly for months
had been vainly urging her mother to wear



CHAPTER IX WHICH TELLS OF THE MAN

It rained the next time Pollyanna saw the Man She greeted him however
with a bright smile

It isnt so nice today is it she called blithesomely Im glad it
doesnt rain always anyhow

The man did not even grunt this time nor turn his head Pollyanna
decided that of course he did not hear her The next time therefore
which happened to be the following day she spoke up louder She
thought it particularly necessary to do this anyway for the Man
was striding along his hands behind his back and his eyes on the
groundwhich seemed to Pollyanna preposterous in the face of the
glorious sunshine and the freshlywashed morning air Pollyanna as a
special treat was on a morning errand today

How do you do she chirped Im so glad it isnt yesterday arent
you

The man stopped abruptly There was an angry scowl on his face

See here little girl we might just as well settle this thing right
now once for all he began testily Ive got something besides
the weather to think of I dont know whether the sun shines or not
Pollyanna beamed joyously

No sir I thought you didnt Thats why I told you

Yes wellEh What he broke off sharply in sudden understanding of
her words

I say thats why I told youso you would notice it you knowthat
the sun shines and all that I knew youd be glad it did if you
only stopped to think of itand you didnt look a bit as if you WERE
thinking of it

Well of all the ejaculated the man with an oddly impotent gesture
He started forward again but after the second step he turned back
still frowning

See here why dont you find some one your own age to talk to

Id like to sir but there arent any round here Nancy says Still
I dont mind so very much I like old folks just as well maybe better
sometimesbeing used to the Ladies Aid so

Humph The Ladies Aid indeed Is that what you took me for The
mans lips were threatening to smile but the scowl above them was still
trying to hold them grimly stern

Pollyanna laughed gleefully

Oh no sir You dont look a mite like a Ladies Aidernot but that
youre just as good of coursemaybe better she added in hurried
politeness You see Im sure youre much nicer than you look

The man made a queer noise in his throat

Well of all the he ejaculated again as he turned and strode on as
before

The next time Pollyanna met the Man his eyes were gazing straight
into hers with a quizzical directness that made his face look really
pleasant Pollyanna thought

Good afternoon he greeted her a little stiffly Perhaps Id better
say right away that I KNOW the sun is shining today

But you dont have to tell me nodded Pollyanna brightly I KNEW you
knew it just as soon as I saw you

Oh you did did you

Yes sir I saw it in your eyes you know and in your smile

Humph grunted the man as he passed on

The Man always spoke to Pollyanna after this and frequently he spoke
first though usually he said little but good afternoon Even that
however was a great surprise to Nancy who chanced to be with Pollyanna
one day when the greeting was given

Sakes alive Miss Pollyanna she gasped did that man SPEAK TO YOU

Why yes he always doesnow smiled Pollyanna

He always does Goodness Do you know whoheis demanded Nancy

Pollyanna frowned and shook her head

I reckon he forgot to tell me one day You see I did my part of the
introducing but he didnt

Nancys eyes widened

But he never speaks ter anybody childhe haint for years I guess
except when he just has to for business and all that Hes John
Pendleton He lives all by himself in the big house on Pendleton Hill
He wont even have any one round ter cook for himcomes down ter the
hotel for his meals three times a day I know Sally Miner who waits on
him and she says he hardly opens his head enough ter tell what he
wants ter eat She has ter guess it moren half the timeonly itll be
somethin CHEAP She knows that without no tellin

Pollyanna nodded sympathetically

I know You have to look for cheap things when youre poor Father and
I took meals out a lot We had beans and fish balls most generally
We used to say how glad we were we liked beansthat is we said it
specially when we were looking at the roast turkey place you know that
was sixty cents Does Mr Pendleton like beans

Like em What if he doesor dont Why Miss Pollyanna he aint
poor Hes got loads of money John Pendleton hasfrom his father
There aint nobody in town as rich as he is He could eat dollar bills
if he wanted toand not know it

Pollyanna giggled

As if anybody COULD eat dollar bills and not know it Nancy when they
come to try to chew em

Ho I mean hes rich enough ter do it shrugged Nancy He aint
spendin his money thats all Hes asavin of it

Oh for the heathen surmised Pollyanna How perfectly splendid
Thats denying yourself and taking up your cross I know father told
me

Nancys lips parted abruptly as if there were angry words all ready to
come but her eyes resting on Pollyannas jubilantly trustful face saw
something that prevented the words being spoken

Humph she vouchsafed Then showing her oldtime interest she
went on But say it is queer his speakin to you honestly Miss
Pollyanna He dont speak ter no one and he lives all alone in a great
big lovely house all full of jest grand things they say Some says hes
crazy and some jest cross and some says hes got a skeleton in his
closet

Oh Nancy shuddered Pollyanna How can he keep such a dreadful
thing I should think hed throw it away

Nancy chuckled That Pollyanna had taken the skeleton literally instead
of figuratively she knew very well but perversely she refrained from
correcting the mistake

And EVERYBODY says hes mysterious she went on Some years he
jest travels week in and week out and its always in heathen
countriesEgypt and Asia and the Desert of Sarah you know

Oh a missionary nodded Pollyanna

Nancy laughed oddly

Well I didnt say that Miss Pollyanna When he comes back he writes
booksqueer odd books they say about some gimcrack hes found in
them heathen countries But he dont never seem ter want ter spend no
money hereleastways not for jest livin

Of course notif hes saving it for the heathen declared Pollyanna
But he is a funny man and hes different too just like Mrs Snow
only hes a different different

Well I guess he israther chuckled Nancy

Im gladdern ever now anyhow that he speaks to me sighed Pollyanna
contentedly



CHAPTER X A SURPRISE FOR MRS SNOW

The next time Pollyanna went to see Mrs Snow she found that lady as
at first in a darkened room

Its the little girl from Miss Pollys mother announced Milly in a
tired manner then Pollyanna found herself alone with the invalid

Oh its you is it asked a fretful voice from the bed I remember
you ANYbodyd remember you I guess if they saw you once I wish you
had come yesterday I WANTED you yesterday

Did you Well Im glad tisnt any farther away from yesterday than
today is then laughed Pollyanna advancing cheerily into the room
and setting her basket carefully down on a chair My but arent you
dark here though I cant see you a bit she cried unhesitatingly
crossing to the window and pulling up the shade I want to see if
youve fixed your hair like I didoh you havent But never mind Im
glad you havent after all cause maybe youll let me do itlater
But now I want you to see what Ive brought you

The woman stirred restlessly

Just as if how it looks would make any difference in how it tastes
she scoffedbut she turned her eyes toward the basket Well what is
it

Guess What do you want Pollyanna had skipped back to the basket Her
face was alight The sick woman frowned

Why I dont WANT anything as I know of she sighed After all they
all taste alike

Pollyanna chuckled

This wont Guess If you DID want something what would it be

The woman hesitated She did not realize it herself but she had so long
been accustomed to wanting what she did not have that to state offhand
what she DID want seemed impossibleuntil she knew what she had
Obviously however she must say something This extraordinary child was
waiting

Well of course theres lamb broth

Ive got it crowed Pollyanna

But thats what I DIDNT want sighed the sick woman sure now of what
her stomach craved It was chicken I wanted

Oh Ive got that too chuckled Pollyanna

The woman turned in amazement

Both of them she demanded

Yesand calfsfoot jelly triumphed Pollyanna I was just bound you
should have what you wanted for once so Nancy and I fixed it Oh of
course theres only a little of eachbut theres some of all of em
Im so glad you did want chicken she went on contentedly as she
lifted the three little bowls from her basket You see I got to
thinking on the way herewhat if you should say tripe or onions
or something like that that I didnt have Wouldnt it have been a
shamewhen Id tried so hard she laughed merrily

There was no reply The sick woman seemed to be tryingmentally to find
something she had lost

There Im to leave them all announced Pollyanna as she arranged the
three bowls in a row on the table Like enough itll be lamb broth you
want tomorrow How do you do today she finished in polite inquiry

Very poorly thank you murmured Mrs Snow falling back into her
usual listless attitude I lost my nap this morning Nellie Higgins
next door has begun music lessons and her practising drives me nearly
wild She was at it all the morningevery minute Im sure I dont
know what I shall do

Polly nodded sympathetically

I know It IS awful Mrs White had it onceone of my Ladies Aiders
you know She had rheumatic fever too at the same time so she
couldnt thrash round She said twould have been easier if she could
have Can you

Can Iwhat

Thrash roundmove you know so as to change your position when the
music gets too hard to stand

Mrs Snow stared a little

Why of course I can moveanywherein bed she rejoined a little
irritably

Well you can be glad of that then anyhow cant you nodded
Pollyanna Mrs White couldnt You cant thrash when you have
rheumatic feverthough you want to something awful Mrs White says
She told me afterwards she reckoned shed have gone raving crazy if it
hadnt been for Mr Whites sisters earsbeing deaf so

SistersEARS What do you mean

Pollyanna laughed

Well I reckon I didnt tell it all and I forgot you didnt know Mrs
White You see Miss White was deafawfully deaf and she came to visit
em and to help take care of Mrs White and the house Well they had
such an awful time making her understand ANYTHING that after that
every time the piano commenced to play across the street Mrs White
felt so glad she COULD hear it that she didnt mind so much that she
DID hear it cause she couldnt help thinking how awful twould be if
she was deaf and couldnt hear anything like her husbands sister You
see she was playing the game too Id told her about it

Thegame

Pollyanna clapped her hands

There I most forgot but Ive thought it up Mrs Snowwhat you can
be glad about

GLAD about What do you mean

Why I told you I would Dont you remember You asked me to tell you
something to be glad aboutglad you know even though you did have to
lie here abed all day

Oh scoffed the woman THAT Yes I remember that but I didnt
suppose you were in earnest any more than I was

Oh yes I was nodded Pollyanna triumphantly and I found it too
But TWAS hard Its all the more fun though always when tis hard
And I will own up honest to true that I couldnt think of anything for
a while Then I got it

Did you really Well what is it Mrs Snows voice was sarcastically
polite

Pollyanna drew a long breath

I thoughthow glad you could bethat other folks werent like
youall sick in bed like this you know she announced impressively
Mrs Snow stared Her eyes were angry

Well really she ejaculated then in not quite an agreeable tone of
voice

And now Ill tell you the game proposed Pollyanna blithely
confident Itll be just lovely for you to playitll be so hard And
theres so much more fun when it is hard You see its like this And
she began to tell of the missionary barrel the crutches and the doll
that did not come

The story was just finished when Milly appeared at the door

Your aunt is wanting you Miss Pollyanna she said with dreary
listlessness She telephoned down to the Harlows across the way She
says youre to hurrythat youve got some practising to make up before
dark

Pollyanna rose reluctantly

All right she sighed Ill hurry Suddenly she laughed I suppose
I ought to be glad Ive got legs to hurry with hadnt I Mrs Snow

There was no answer Mrs Snows eyes were closed But Milly whose eyes
were wide open with surprise saw that there were tears on the wasted
cheeks

Goodby flung Pollyanna over her shoulder as she reached the door
Im awfully sorry about the hairI wanted to do it But maybe I can
next time


One by one the July days passed To Pollyanna they were happy days
indeed She often told her aunt joyously how very happy they were
Whereupon her aunt would usually reply wearily

Very well Pollyanna I am gratified of course that they are happy
but I trust that they are profitable as wellotherwise I should have
failed signally in my duty

Generally Pollyanna would answer this with a hug and a kissa
proceeding that was still always most disconcerting to Miss Polly but
one day she spoke It was during the sewing hour

Do you mean that it wouldnt be enough then Aunt Polly that they
should be just happy days she asked wistfully

That is what I mean Pollyanna

They must be profitable as well

Certainly

What is being profitable

Why itits just being profitablehaving profit something to show
for it Pollyanna What an extraordinary child you are

Then just being glad isnt profitable questioned Pollyanna a
little anxiously

Certainly not

O dear Then you wouldnt like it of course Im afraid now you
wont ever play the game Aunt Polly

Game What game

Why that father Pollyanna clapped her hand to her lips
Nnothing she stammered Miss Polly frowned

That will do for this morning Pollyanna she said tersely And the
sewing lesson was over

It was that afternoon that Pollyanna coming down from her attic room
met her aunt on the stairway

Why Aunt Polly how perfectly lovely she cried You were coming up
to see me Come right in I love company she finished scampering up
the stairs and throwing her door wide open

Now Miss Polly had not been intending to call on her niece She had been
planning to look for a certain white wool shawl in the cedar chest near
the east window But to her unbounded surprise now she found herself
not in the main attic before the cedar chest but in Pollyannas little
room sitting in one of the straightbacked chairsso many many times
since Pollyanna came Miss Polly had found herself like this doing some
utterly unexpected surprising thing quite unlike the thing she had set
out to do

I love company said Pollyanna again flitting about as if she were
dispensing the hospitality of a palace specially since Ive had this
room all mine you know Oh of course I had a room always but twas
a hired room and hired rooms arent half as nice as owned ones are
they And of course I do own this one dont I

Why yyes Pollyanna murmured Miss Polly vaguely wondering why she
did not get up at once and go to look for that shawl

And of course NOW I just love this room even if it hasnt got the
carpets and curtains and pictures that Id been want With a painful
blush Pollyanna stopped short She was plunging into an entirely
different sentence when her aunt interrupted her sharply

Whats that Pollyanna

Nnothing Aunt Polly truly I didnt mean to say it

Probably not returned Miss Polly coldly but you did say it so
suppose we have the rest of it

But it wasnt anything only that Id been kind of planning on pretty
carpets and lace curtains and things you know But of course

PLANNING on them interrupted Miss Polly sharply

Pollyanna blushed still more painfully

I ought not to have of course Aunt Polly she apologized It was
only because Id always wanted them and hadnt had them I suppose Oh
wed had two rugs in the barrels but they were little you know and
one had ink spots and the other holes and there never were only those
two pictures the one fathI mean the good one we sold and the bad one
that broke Of course if it hadnt been for all that I shouldnt have
wanted them sopretty things I mean and I shouldnt have got to
planning all through the hall that first day how pretty mine would be
here andandbut truly Aunt Polly it wasnt but just a minuteI
mean a few minutesbefore I was being glad that the bureau DIDNT have
a lookingglass because it didnt show my freckles and there couldnt
be a nicer picture than the one out my window there and youve been so
good to me that

Miss Polly rose suddenly to her feet Her face was very red

That will do Pollyanna she said stiffly

You have said quite enough Im sure The next minute she had swept
down the stairsand not until she reached the first floor did it
suddenly occur to her that she had gone up into the attic to find a
white wool shawl in the cedar chest near the east window

Less than twentyfour hours later Miss Polly said to Nancy crisply

Nancy you may move Miss Pollyannas things downstairs this morning to
the room directly beneath I have decided to have my niece sleep there
for the present

Yes maam said Nancy aloud

O glory said Nancy to herself

To Pollyanna a minute later she cried joyously

And wont ye jest be listenin ter this Miss Pollyanna Youre ter
sleep downstairs in the room straight under this You areyou are

Pollyanna actually grew white

You meanwhy Nancy not reallyreally and truly

I guess youll think its really and truly prophesied Nancy
exultingly nodding her head to Pollyanna over the armful of dresses she
had taken from the closet Im told ter take down yer things and Im
goin ter take em too fore she gets a chance ter change her mind

Pollyanna did not stop to hear the end of this sentence At the imminent
risk of being dashed headlong she was flying downstairs two steps at
a time

Bang went two doors and a chair before Pollyanna at last reached her
goalAunt Polly

Oh Aunt Polly Aunt Polly did you mean it really Why that rooms
got EVERYTHINGthe carpet and curtains and three pictures besides
the one outdoors too cause the windows look the same way Oh Aunt
Polly

Very well Pollyanna I am gratified that you like the change of
course but if you think so much of all those things I trust you will
take proper care of them thats all Pollyanna please pick up that
chair and you have banged two doors in the last halfminute Miss
Polly spoke sternly all the more sternly because for some inexplicable
reason she felt inclined to cryand Miss Polly was not used to feeling
inclined to cry

Pollyanna picked up the chair

Yesm I know I banged emthose doors she admitted cheerfully You
see Id just found out about the room and I reckon youd have banged
doors if Pollyanna stopped short and eyed her aunt with new interest
Aunt Polly DID you ever bang doors

I hopenot Pollyanna Miss Pollys voice was properly shocked

Why Aunt Polly what a shame Pollyannas face expressed only
concerned sympathy

A shame repeated Aunt Polly too dazed to say more

Why yes You see if youd felt like banging doors youd have banged
em of course and if you didnt that must have meant that you werent
ever glad over anythingor you would have banged em You couldnt have
helped it And Im so sorry you werent ever glad over anything

PollyANna gasped the lady but Pollyanna was gone and only the
distant bang of the atticstairway door answered for her Pollyanna had
gone to help Nancy bring down her things

Miss Polly in the sitting room felt vaguely disturbedbut then of
course she HAD been gladover some things



CHAPTER XI INTRODUCING JIMMY

August came August brought several surprises and some changesnone
of which however were really a surprise to Nancy Nancy since
Pollyannas arrival had come to look for surprises and changes

First there was the kitten

Pollyanna found the kitten mewing pitifully some distance down the road
When systematic questioning of the neighbors failed to find any one who
claimed it Pollyanna brought it home at once as a matter of course

And I was glad I didnt find any one who owned it too she told her
aunt in happy confidence cause I wanted to bring it home all the
time I love kitties I knew youd be glad to let it live here

Miss Polly looked at the forlorn little gray bunch of neglected misery
in Pollyannas arms and shivered Miss Polly did not care for catsnot
even pretty healthy clean ones

Ugh Pollyanna What a dirty little beast And its sick Im sure and
all mangy and fleay

I know it poor little thing crooned Pollyanna tenderly looking
into the little creatures frightened eyes And its all trembly too
its so scared You see it doesnt know yet that were going to keep
it of course

Nonor anybody else retorted Miss Polly with meaning emphasis

Oh yes they do nodded Pollyanna entirely misunderstanding her
aunts words I told everybody we should keep it if I didnt find
where it belonged I knew youd be glad to have itpoor little lonesome
thing

Miss Polly opened her lips and tried to speak but in vain The curious
helpless feeling that had been hers so often since Pollyannas arrival
had her now fast in its grip

Of course I knew hurried on Pollyanna gratefully that you wouldnt
let a dear little lonesome kitty go hunting for a home when youd just
taken ME in and I said so to Mrs Ford when she asked if youd let me
keep it Why I had the Ladies Aid you know and kitty didnt have
anybody I knew youd feel that way she nodded happily as she ran
from the room

But Pollyanna Pollyanna remonstrated Miss Polly I dont But
Pollyanna was already halfway to the kitchen calling

Nancy Nancy just see this dear little kitty that Aunt Polly is going
to bring up along with me And Aunt Polly in the sitting roomwho
abhorred catsfell back in her chair with a gasp of dismay powerless
to remonstrate

The next day it was a dog even dirtier and more forlorn perhaps than
was the kitten and again Miss Polly to her dumfounded amazement found
herself figuring as a kind protector and an angel of mercya role that
Pollyanna so unhesitatingly thrust upon her as a matter of course
that the womanwho abhorred dogs even more than she did cats if
possiblefound herself as before powerless to remonstrate

When in less than a week however Pollyanna brought home a small
ragged boy and confidently claimed the same protection for him Miss
Polly did have something to say It happened after this wise

On a pleasant Thursday morning Pollyanna had been taking calfsfoot
jelly again to Mrs Snow Mrs Snow and Pollyanna were the best of
friends now Their friendship had started from the third visit Pollyanna
had made the one after she had told Mrs Snow of the game Mrs Snow
herself was playing the game now with Pollyanna To be sure she was
not playing it very wellshe had been sorry for everything for so long
that it was not easy to be glad for anything now But under Pollyannas
cheery instructions and merry laughter at her mistakes she was learning
fast Today even to Pollyannas huge delight she had said that she
was glad Pollyanna brought calfsfoot jelly because that was just what
she had been wantingshe did not know that Milly at the front door
had told Pollyanna that the ministers wife had already that day sent
over a great bowlful of that same kind of jelly

Pollyanna was thinking of this now when suddenly she saw the boy

The boy was sitting in a disconsolate little heap by the roadside
whittling halfheartedly at a small stick

Hullo smiled Pollyanna engagingly

The boy glanced up but he looked away again at once

Hullo yourself he mumbled

Pollyanna laughed

Now you dont look as if youd be glad even for calfsfoot jelly she
chuckled stopping before him

The boy stirred restlessly gave her a surprised look and began to
whittle again at his stick with the dull brokenbladed knife in his
hand

Pollyanna hesitated then dropped herself comfortably down on the grass
near him In spite of Pollyannas brave assertion that she was used
to Ladies Aiders and didnt mind she had sighed at times for some
companion of her own age Hence her determination to make the most of
this one

My names Pollyanna Whittier she began pleasantly Whats yours

Again the boy stirred restlessly He even almost got to his feet But he
settled back

Jimmy Bean he grunted with ungracious indifference

Good Now were introduced Im glad you did your partsome folks
dont you know I live at Miss Polly Harringtons house Where do you
live

Nowhere

Nowhere Why you cant do thateverybody lives somewhere asserted
Pollyanna

Well I dontjust now Im huntin up a new place

Oh Where is it

The boy regarded her with scornful eyes

Silly As if Id be ahuntin for itif I knew

Pollyanna tossed her head a little This was not a nice boy and she
did not like to be called silly Still he was somebody besidesold
folks Where did you livebefore she queried

Well if you aint the beatem for askin questions sighed the boy
impatiently

I have to be retorted Pollyanna calmly else I couldnt find out a
thing about you If youd talk more I wouldnt talk so much

The boy gave a short laugh It was a sheepish laugh and not quite a
willing one but his face looked a little pleasanter when he spoke this
time

All right thenhere goes Im Jimmy Bean and Im ten years old goin
on eleven I come last year ter live at the Orphans Home but theyve
got so many kids there aint much room for me an I want never
wanted anyhow I dont believe So Ive quit Im goin ter live
somewheres elsebut I haint found the place yet Id LIKE a
homejest a common one ye know with a mother in it instead of
a Matron If ye has a home ye has folks an I haint had folks
sincedad died So Im ahuntin now Ive tried four houses butthey
didnt want methough I said I expected ter work course There Is
that all you want ter know The boys voice had broken a little over
the last two sentences

Why what a shame sympathized Pollyanna And didnt there anybody
want you O dear I know just how you feel because afterafter my
father died too there wasnt anybody but the Ladies Aid for me until
Aunt Polly said shed take Pollyanna stopped abruptly The dawning of
a wonderful idea began to show in her face

Oh I know just the place for you she cried Aunt Pollyll take
youI know she will Didnt she take me And didnt she take Fluffy
and Buffy when they didnt have any one to love them or any place to
goand theyre only cats and dogs Oh come I know Aunt Pollyll take
you You dont know how good and kind she is

Jimmy Beans thin little face brightened

Honest Injun Would she now Id work ye know an Im real strong
He bared a small bony arm

Of course she would Why my Aunt Polly is the nicest lady in the
worldnow that my mama has gone to be a Heaven angel And theres
roomsheaps of em she continued springing to her feet and tugging
at his arm Its an awful big house Maybe though she added a little
anxiously as they hurried on maybe youll have to sleep in the attic
room I did at first But theres screens there now so twont be so
hot and the flies cant get in either to bring in the germthings on
their feet Did you know about that Its perfectly lovely Maybe shell
let you read the book if youre goodI mean if youre bad And youve
got freckles toowith a critical glanceso youll be glad there
isnt any lookingglass and the outdoor picture is nicer than any
wallone could be so you wont mind sleeping in that room at all Im
sure panted Pollyanna finding suddenly that she needed the rest of
her breath for purposes other than talking

Gorry exclaimed Jimmy Bean tersely and uncomprehendingly but
admiringly Then he added I shouldnt think anybody who could talk
like that runnin would need ter ask no questions ter fill up time
with

Pollyanna laughed

Well anyhow you can be glad of that she retorted for when Im
talking YOU dont have to


When the house was reached Pollyanna unhesitatingly piloted her
companion straight into the presence of her amazed aunt

Oh Aunt Polly she triumphed just look ahere Ive got something
ever so much nicer even than Fluffy and Buffy for you to bring up
Its a real live boy He wont mind a bit sleeping in the attic at
first you know and he says hell work but I shall need him the most
of the time to play with I reckon

Miss Polly grew white then very red She did not quite understand but
she thought she understood enough

Pollyanna what does this mean Who is this dirty little boy Where did
you find him she demanded sharply

The dirty little boy fell back a step and looked toward the door
Pollyanna laughed merrily

There if I didnt forget to tell you his name Im as bad as the Man
And he is dirty too isnt heI mean the boy isjust like Fluffy
and Buffy were when you took them in But I reckon hell improve all
right by washing just as they did andOh I most forgot again she
broke off with a laugh This is Jimmy Bean Aunt Polly

Well what is he doing here

Why Aunt Polly I just told you Pollyannas eyes were wide with
surprise Hes for you I brought him homeso he could live here you
know He wants a home and folks I told him how good you were to me
and to Fluffy and Buffy and that I knew you would be to him because of
course hes even nicer than cats and dogs

Miss Polly dropped back in her chair and raised a shaking hand to her
throat The old helplessness was threatening once more to overcome her
With a visible struggle however Miss Polly pulled herself suddenly
erect

That will do Pollyanna This is a little the most absurd thing youve
done yet As if tramp cats and mangy dogs werent bad enough but you
must needs bring home ragged little beggars from the street who

There was a sudden stir from the boy His eyes flashed and his chin came
up With two strides of his sturdy little legs he confronted Miss Polly
fearlessly

I aint a beggar marm an I dont want nothin o you I was
callatin ter work of course fur my board an keep I wouldnt have
come ter your old house anyhow if this ere girl hadnt a made me
atellin me how you was so good an kind that youd be jest dyin ter
take me in So there And he wheeled about and stalked from the room
with a dignity that would have been absurd had it not been so pitiful

Oh Aunt Polly choked Pollyanna Why I thought youd be GLAD to
have him here Im sure I should think youd be glad

Miss Polly raised her hand with a peremptory gesture of silence Miss
Pollys nerves had snapped at last The good and kind of the boys
words were still ringing in her ears and the old helplessness was
almost upon her she knew Yet she rallied her forces with the last atom
of her will power

Pollyanna she cried sharply WILL you stop using that everlasting
word glad Its gladgladglad from morning till night until I
think I shall grow wild

From sheer amazement Pollyannas jaw dropped

Why Aunt Polly she breathed I should think youd be glad to have
me glOh she broke off clapping her hand to her lips and hurrying
blindly from the room

Before the boy had reached the end of the driveway Pollyanna overtook
him

Boy Boy Jimmy Bean I want you to know howhow sorry I am she
panted catching him with a detaining hand

Sorry nothin I aint blamin you retorted the boy sullenly But I
aint no beggar he added with sudden spirit

Of course you arent But you mustnt blame auntie appealed
Pollyanna Probably I didnt do the introducing right anyhow and
I reckon I didnt tell her much who you were She is good and kind
reallyshes always been but I probably didnt explain it right I do
wish I could find some place for you though

The boy shrugged his shoulders and half turned away

Never mind I guess I can find one myself I aint no beggar you
know

Pollyanna was frowning thoughtfully Of a sudden she turned her face
illumined

Say Ill tell you what I WILL do The Ladies Aid meets this
afternoon I heard Aunt Polly say so Ill lay your case before them
Thats what father always did when he wanted anythingeducating the
heathen and new carpets you know

The boy turned fiercely

Well I aint a heathen or a new carpet Besideswhat is a Ladies
Aid

Pollyanna stared in shocked disapproval

Why Jimmy Bean wherever have you been brought upnot to know what a
Ladies Aid is

Oh all rightif you aint tellin grunted the boy turning and
beginning to walk away indifferently

Pollyanna sprang to his side at once

Itsitswhy its just a lot of ladies that meet and sew and give
suppers and raise money andand talk thats what a Ladies Aid is
Theyre awfully kindthat is most of mine was back home I havent
seen this one here but theyre always good I reckon Im going to tell
them about you this afternoon

Again the boy turned fiercely

Not much you will Maybe you think Im goin ter stand round an hear
a whole LOT o women call me a beggar instead of jest ONE Not much

Oh but you wouldnt be there argued Pollyanna quickly Id go
alone of course and tell them

You would

Yes and Id tell it better this time hurried on Pollyanna quick to
see the signs of relenting in the boys face And thered be some of
em I know that would be glad to give you a home

Id workdont forget ter say that cautioned the boy

Of course not promised Pollyanna happily sure now that her point
was gained Then Ill let you know tomorrow

Where

By the roadwhere I found you today near Mrs Snows house

All right Ill be there The boy paused before he went on slowly
Maybe Id better go back then for ternight ter the Home You see
I haint no other place ter stay andand I didnt leave till this
mornin I slipped out I didnt tell em I wasnt comin back else
theyd pretend I couldnt comethough Im thinkin they wont do no
worryin when I dont show up sometime They aint like FOLKS ye know
They dont CARE

I know nodded Pollyanna with understanding eyes But Im sure when
I see you tomorrow Ill have just a common home and folks that do care
all ready for you Goodby she called brightly as she turned back
toward the house

In the sittingroom window at that moment Miss Polly who had been
watching the two children followed with sombre eyes the boy until a
bend of the road hid him from sight Then she sighed turned and walked
listlesly upstairsand Miss Polly did not usually move listlessly In
her ears still was the boys scornful you was so good and kind In her
heart was a curious sense of desolationas of something lost



CHAPTER XII BEFORE THE LADIES AID

Dinner which came at noon in the Harrington homestead was a silent
meal on the day of the Ladies Aid meeting Pollyanna it is true tried
to talk but she did not make a success of it chiefly because four
times she was obliged to break off a glad in the middle of it much
to her blushing discomfort The fifth time it happened Miss Polly moved
her head wearily

There there child say it if you want to she sighed Im sure Id
rather you did than not if its going to make all this fuss

Pollyannas puckered little face cleared

Oh thank you Im afraid it would be pretty hardnot to say it You
see Ive played it so long

Youvewhat demanded Aunt Polly

Played itthe game you know that father Pollyanna stopped with a
painful blush at finding herself so soon again on forbidden ground

Aunt Polly frowned and said nothing The rest of the meal was a silent
one

Pollyanna was not sorry to hear Aunt Polly tell the ministers wife over
the telephone a little later that she would not be at the Ladies
Aid meeting that afternoon owing to a headache When Aunt Polly went
upstairs to her room and closed the door Pollyanna tried to be sorry
for the headache but she could not help feeling glad that her aunt was
not to be present that afternoon when she laid the case of Jimmy Bean
before the Ladies Aid She could not forget that Aunt Polly had called
Jimmy Bean a little beggar and she did not want Aunt Polly to call him
thatbefore the Ladies Aid

Pollyanna knew that the Ladies Aid met at two oclock in the chapel
next the church not quite half a mile from home She planned her going
therefore so that she should get there a little before three

I want them all to be there she said to herself else the very one
that wasnt there might be the one who would be wanting to give Jimmy
Bean a home and of course two oclock always means three reallyto
Ladies Aiders

Quietly but with confident courage Pollyanna ascended the chapel
steps pushed open the door and entered the vestibule A soft babel of
feminine chatter and laughter came from the main room Hesitating only a
brief moment Pollyanna pushed open one of the inner doors

The chatter dropped to a surprised hush Pollyanna advanced a little
timidly Now that the time had come she felt unwontedly shy After all
these halfstrange halffamiliar faces about her were not her own dear
Ladies Aid

How do you do Ladies Aiders she faltered politely Im Pollyanna
Whittier II reckon some of you know me maybe anyway I do YOUonly
I dont know you all together this way

The silence could almost be felt now Some of the ladies did know this
rather extraordinary niece of their fellowmember and nearly all had
heard of her but not one of them could think of anything to say just
then

IIve come toto lay the case before you stammered Pollyanna
after a moment unconsciously falling into her fathers familiar
phraseology

There was a slight rustle

Diddid your aunt send you my dear asked Mrs Ford the ministers
wife

Pollyanna colored a little

Oh no I came all by myself You see Im used to Ladies Aiders It
was Ladies Aiders that brought me upwith father

Somebody tittered hysterically and the ministers wife frowned

Yes dear What is it

Well itits Jimmy Bean sighed Pollyanna He hasnt any home
except the Orphan one and theyre full and dont want him anyhow he
thinks so he wants another He wants one of the common kind that has
a mother instead of a Matron in itfolks you know thatll care Hes
ten years old going on eleven I thought some of you might like himto
live with you you know

Well did you ever murmured a voice breaking the dazed pause that
followed Pollyannas words

With anxious eyes Pollyanna swept the circle of faces about her

Oh I forgot to say he will work she supplemented eagerly

Still there was silence then coldly one or two women began to
question her After a time they all had the story and began to talk
among themselves animatedly not quite pleasantly

Pollyanna listened with growing anxiety Some of what was said she could
not understand She did gather after a time however that there was
no woman there who had a home to give him though every woman seemed to
think that some of the others might take him as there were several who
had no little boys of their own already in their homes But there was no
one who agreed herself to take him Then she heard the ministers
wife suggest timidly that they as a society might perhaps assume his
support and education instead of sending quite so much money this year
to the little boys in faraway India

A great many ladies talked then and several of them talked all at once
and even more loudly and more unpleasantly than before It seemed that
their society was famous for its offering to Hindu missions and several
said they should die of mortification if it should be less this year
Some of what was said at this time Pollyanna again thought she could not
have understood too for it sounded almost as if they did not care at
all what the money DID so long as the sum opposite the name of their
society in a certain report headed the listand of course that
could not be what they meant at all But it was all very confusing and
not quite pleasant so that Pollyanna was glad indeed when at last she
found herself outside in the hushed sweet aironly she was very sorry
too for she knew it was not going to be easy or anything but sad to
tell Jimmy Bean tomorrow that the Ladies Aid had decided that they
would rather send all their money to bring up the little India boys than
to save out enough to bring up one little boy in their own town for
which they would not get a bit of credit in the report according to
the tall lady who wore spectacles

Not but that its good of course to send money to the heathen and I
shouldnt want em not to send SOME there sighed Pollyanna to herself
as she trudged sorrowfully along But they acted as if little boys HERE
werent any accountonly little boys way off I should THINK though
theyd rather see Jimmy Bean growthan just a report



CHAPTER XIII IN PENDLETON WOODS

Pollyanna had not turned her steps toward home when she left the
chapel She had turned them instead toward Pendleton Hill It had
been a hard day for all it had been a vacation one as she termed
the infrequent days when there was no sewing or cooking lesson and
Pollyanna was sure that nothing would do her quite so much good as a
walk through the green quiet of Pendleton Woods Up Pendleton Hill
therefore she climbed steadily in spite of the warm sun on her back

I dont have to get home till halfpast five anyway she was telling
herself and itll be so much nicer to go around by the way of the
woods even if I do have to climb to get there

It was very beautiful in the Pendleton Woods as Pollyanna knew by
experience But today it seemed even more delightful than ever
notwithstanding her disappointment over what she must tell Jimmy Bean
tomorrow

I wish they were up hereall those ladies who talked so loud sighed
Pollyanna to herself raising her eyes to the patches of vivid blue
between the sunlit green of the treetops Anyhow if they were up
here I just reckon theyd change and take Jimmy Bean for their little
boy all right she finished secure in her conviction but unable to
give a reason for it even to herself

Suddenly Pollyanna lifted her head and listened A dog had barked
some distance ahead A moment later he came dashing toward her still
barking

Hullo doggiehullo Pollyanna snapped her fingers at the dog and
looked expectantly down the path She had seen the dog once before she
was sure He had been then with the Man Mr John Pendleton She was
looking now hoping to see him For some minutes she watched eagerly
but he did not appear Then she turned her attention toward the dog

The dog as even Pollyanna could see was acting strangely He was
still barkinggiving little short sharp yelps as if of alarm He was
running back and forth too in the path ahead Soon they reached a side
path and down this the little dog fairly flew only to come back at
once whining and barking

Ho That isnt the way home laughed Pollyanna still keeping to the
main path

The little dog seemed frantic now Back and forth back and forth
between Pollyanna and the side path he vibrated barking and whining
pitifully Every quiver of his little brown body and every glance from
his beseeching brown eyes were eloquent with appealso eloquent that at
last Pollyanna understood turned and followed him

Straight ahead now the little dog dashed madly and it was not long
before Pollyanna came upon the reason for it all a man lying motionless
at the foot of a steep overhanging mass of rock a few yards from the
side path

A twig cracked sharply under Pollyannas foot and the man turned his
head With a cry of dismay Pollyanna ran to his side

Mr Pendleton Oh are you hurt

Hurt Oh no Im just taking a siesta in the sunshine snapped the
man irritably See here how much do you know What can you do Have
you got any sense

Pollyanna caught her breath with a little gasp butas was her
habitshe answered the questions literally one by one

Why Mr Pendleton II dont know so very much and I cant do a
great many things but most of the Ladies Aiders except Mrs Rawson
said I had real good sense I heard em say so one daythey didnt know
I heard though

The man smiled grimly

There there child I beg your pardon Im sure its only this
confounded leg of mine Now listen He paused and with some difficulty
reached his hand into his trousers pocket and brought out a bunch of
keys singling out one between his thumb and forefinger Straight
through the path there about five minutes walk is my house This key
will admit you to the side door under the portecochere Do you know
what a portecochere is

Oh yes sir Auntie has one with a sun parlor over it Thats the roof
I slept ononly I didnt sleep you know They found me

Eh Oh Well when you get into the house go straight through the
vestibule and hall to the door at the end On the big flattopped desk
in the middle of the room youll find a telephone Do you know how to
use a telephone

Oh yes sir Why once when Aunt Polly

Never mind Aunt Polly now cut in the man scowlingly as he tried to
move himself a little

Hunt up Dr Thomas Chiltons number on the card youll find somewhere
around thereit ought to be on the hook down at the side but it
probably wont be You know a telephone card I suppose when you see
one

Oh yes sir I just love Aunt Pollys Theres such a lot of queer
names and

Tell Dr Chilton that John Pendleton is at the foot of Little Eagle
Ledge in Pendleton Woods with a broken leg and to come at once with a
stretcher and two men Hell know what to do besides that Tell him to
come by the path from the house

A broken leg Oh Mr Pendleton how perfectly awful shuddered
Pollyanna But Im so glad I came Cant _I_ do

Yes you canbut evidently you wont WILL you go and do what I ask
and stop talking moaned the man faintly And with a little sobbing
cry Pollyanna went

Pollyanna did not stop now to look up at the patches of blue between the
sunlit tops of the trees She kept her eyes on the ground to make sure
that no twig nor stone tripped her hurrying feet

It was not long before she came in sight of the house She had seen it
before though never so near as this She was almost frightened now
at the massiveness of the great pile of gray stone with its pillared
verandas and its imposing entrance Pausing only a moment however she
sped across the big neglected lawn and around the house to the side door
under the portecochere Her fingers stiff from their tight clutch upon
the keys were anything but skilful in their efforts to turn the bolt
in the lock but at last the heavy carved door swung slowly back on its
hinges

Pollyanna caught her breath In spite of her feeling of haste she
paused a moment and looked fearfully through the vestibule to the wide
sombre hall beyond her thoughts in a whirl This was John Pendletons
house the house of mystery the house into which no one but its master
entered the house which sheltered somewherea skeleton Yet she
Pollyanna was expected to enter alone these fearsome rooms and
telephone the doctor that the master of the house lay now

With a little cry Pollyanna looking neither to the right nor the left
fairly ran through the hall to the door at the end and opened it

The room was large and sombre with dark woods and hangings like the
hall but through the west window the sun threw a long shaft of gold
across the floor gleamed dully on the tarnished brass andirons in the
fireplace and touched the nickel of the telephone on the great desk in
the middle of the room It was toward this desk that Pollyanna hurriedly
tiptoed

The telephone card was not on its hook it was on the floor But
Pollyanna found it and ran her shaking forefinger down through the Cs
to Chilton In due time she had Dr Chilton himself at the other end
of the wires and was tremblingly delivering her message and answering
the doctors terse pertinent questions This done she hung up the
receiver and drew a long breath of relief

Only a brief glance did Pollyanna give about her then with a confused
vision in her eyes of crimson draperies booklined walls a littered
floor an untidy desk innumerable closed doors any one of which might
conceal a skeleton and everywhere dust dust dust she fled back
through the hall to the great carved door still half open as she had
left it

In what seemed even to the injured man an incredibly short time
Pollyanna was back in the woods at the mans side

Well what is the trouble Couldnt you get in he demanded

Pollyanna opened wide her eyes

Why of course I could Im HERE she answered As if Id be here
if I hadnt got in And the doctor will be right up just as soon as
possible with the men and things He said he knew just where you were
so I didnt stay to show him I wanted to be with you

Did you smiled the man grimly Well I cant say I admire your
taste I should think you might find pleasanter companions

Do you meanbecause youre socross

Thanks for your frankness Yes

Pollyanna laughed softly

But youre only cross OUTSIDEYou arnt cross inside a bit

Indeed How do you know that asked the man trying to change the
position of his head without moving the rest of his body

Oh lots of ways therelike thatthe way you act with the dog she
added pointing to the long slender hand that rested on the dogs sleek
head near him Its funny how dogs and cats know the insides of folks
better than other folks do isnt it Say Im going to hold your head
she finished abruptly

The man winced several times and groaned once softly while the change
was being made but in the end he found Pollyannas lap a very welcome
substitute for the rocky hollow in which his head had lain before

Well that isbetter he murmured faintly

He did not speak again for some time Pollyanna watching his face
wondered if he were asleep She did not think he was He looked as if
his lips were tight shut to keep back moans of pain Pollyanna herself
almost cried aloud as she looked at his great strong body lying there
so helpless One hand with fingers tightly clenched lay outflung
motionless The other limply open lay on the dogs head The dog his
wistful eager eyes on his masters face was motionless too

Minute by minute the time passed The sun dropped lower in the west
and the shadows grew deeper under the trees Pollyanna sat so still she
hardly seemed to breathe A bird alighted fearlessly within reach of
her hand and a squirrel whisked his bushy tail on a treebranch almost
under her noseyet with his bright little eyes all the while on the
motionless dog

At last the dog pricked up his cars and whined softly then he gave a
short sharp bark The next moment Pollyanna heard voices and very soon
their owners appeared three men carrying a stretcher and various other
articles

The tallest of the partya smoothshaven kindeyed man whom Pollyanna
knew by sight as Dr Chiltonadvanced cheerily

Well my little lady playing nurse

Oh no sir smiled Pollyanna Ive only held his headI havent
given him a mite of medicine But Im glad I was here

So am I nodded the doctor as he turned his absorbed attention to the
injured man



CHAPTER XIV JUST A MATTER OF JELLY

Pollyanna was a little late for supper on the night of the accident to
John Pendleton but as it happened she escaped without reproof

Nancy met her at the door

Well if I aint glad ter be settin my two eyes on you she sighed in
obvious relief Its halfpast six

I know it admitted Pollyanna anxiously but Im not to blametruly
Im not And I dont think even Aunt Polly will say I am either

She wont have the chance retorted Nancy with huge satisfaction
Shes gone

Gone gasped Pollyanna You dont mean that Ive driven her away
Through Pollyannas mind at the moment trooped remorseful memories
of the morning with its unwanted boy cat and dog and its unwelcome
glad and forbidden father that would spring to her forgetful little
tongue Oh I DIDNT drive her away

Not much you did scoffed Nancy Her cousin died suddenly down to
Boston and she had ter go She had one o them yeller telegram letters
after you went away this afternoon and she wont be back for three
days Now I guess were glad all right Well be keepin house
tergether jest you and me all that time We will we will

Pollyanna looked shocked

Glad Oh Nancy when its a funeral

Oh but twant the funeral I was glad for Miss Pollyanna It was
Nancy stopped abruptly A shrewd twinkle came into her eyes Why Miss
Pollyanna as if it want yerself that was teachin me ter play the
game she reproached her gravely

Pollyanna puckered her forehead into a troubled frown

I cant help it Nancy she argued with a shake of her head It
must be that there are some things that tisnt right to play the game
onand Im sure funerals is one of them Theres nothing in a funeral
to be glad about

Nancy chuckled

We can be glad taint ourn she observed demurely But Pollyanna did
not hear She had begun to tell of the accident and in a moment Nancy
openmouthed was listening

At the appointed place the next afternoon Pollyanna met Jimmy Bean
according to agreement As was to be expected of course Jimmy showed
keen disappointment that the Ladies Aid preferred a little India boy to
himself

Well maybe tis natural he sighed Of course things you dont know
about are always nicern things you do same as the pertater on tother
side of the plate is always the biggest But I wish I looked that way
ter somebody way off Wouldnt it be jest great now if only somebody
over in India wanted ME

Pollyanna clapped her hands

Why of course Thats the very thing Jimmy Ill write to my Ladies
Aiders about you They arent over in India theyre only out Westbut
thats awful far away just the same I reckon youd think so if youd
come all the way here as I did

Jimmys face brightened

Do you think they wouldtrulytake me he asked

Of course they would Dont they take little boys in India to bring
up Well they can just play you are the little India boy this time
I reckon youre far enough away to make a report all right You wait
Ill write em Ill write Mrs White No Ill write Mrs Jones Mrs
White has got the most money but Mrs Jones gives the mostwhich is
kind of funny isnt itwhen you think of it But I reckon some of the
Aiders will take you

All rightbut dont furgit ter say Ill work fur my board an keep
put in Jimmy I aint no beggar an bizness is bizness even with
Ladies Aiders Im thinkin He hesitated then added An I spose I
better stay where I be fur a spell yettill you hear

Of course nodded Pollyanna emphatically Then Ill know just where
to find you And theyll take youIm sure youre far enough away for
that Didnt Aunt Polly takeSay she broke off suddenly DO you
suppose I was Aunt Pollys little girl from India

Well if you aint the queerest kid grinned Jimmy as he turned away

It was about a week after the accident in Pendleton Woods that Pollyanna
said to her aunt one morning

Aunt Polly please would you mind very much if I took Mrs Snows
calfsfoot jelly this week to some one else Im sure Mrs Snow
wouldntthis once

Dear me Pollyanna what ARE you up to now sighed her aunt You ARE
the most extraordinary child

Pollyanna frowned a little anxiously

Aunt Polly please what is extraordinary If youre EXtraordinary you
cant be ORdinary can you

You certainly can not

Oh thats all right then Im glad Im EXtraordinary sighed
Pollyanna her face clearing You see Mrs White used to say Mrs
Rawson was a very ordinary womanand she disliked Mrs Rawson something
awful They were always fightI mean father hadthat is I mean WE
had more trouble keeping peace between them than we did between any of
the rest of the Aiders corrected Pollyanna a little breathless from
her efforts to steer between the Scylla of her fathers past commands in
regard to speaking of church quarrels and the Charybdis of her aunts
present commands in regard to speaking of her father

Yes yes well never mind interposed Aunt Polly a trifle
impatiently You do run on so Pollyanna and no matter what were
talking about you always bring up at those Ladies Aiders

Yesm smiled Pollyanna cheerfully I reckon I do maybe But you
see they used to bring me up and

That will do Pollyanna interrupted a cold voice Now what is it
about this jelly

Nothing Aunt Polly truly that you would mind Im sure You let me
take jelly to HER so I thought you would to HIMthis once You see
broken legs arent likelike lifelong invalids so his wont last
forever as Mrs Snows does and she can have all the rest of the things
after just once or twice

Him He Broken leg What are you talking about Pollyanna

Pollyanna stared then her face relaxed

Oh I forgot I reckon you didnt know You see it happened while you
were gone It was the very day you went that I found him in the woods
you know and I had to unlock his house and telephone for the men and
the doctor and hold his head and everything And of course then I came
away and havent seen him since But when Nancy made the jelly for Mrs
Snow this week I thought how nice it would be if I could take it to him
instead of her just this once Aunt Polly may I

Yes yes I suppose so acquiesced Miss Polly a little wearily Who
did you say he was

The Man I mean Mr John Pendleton

Miss Polly almost sprang from her chair

JOHN PENDLETON

Yes Nancy told me his name Maybe you know him

Miss Polly did not answer this Instead she asked

Do YOU know him

Pollyanna nodded

Oh yes He always speaks and smilesnow Hes only cross OUTSIDE you
know Ill go and get the jelly Nancy had it most fixed when I came
in finished Pollyanna already halfway across the room

Pollyanna wait Miss Pollys voice was suddenly very stern Ive
changed my mind I would prefer that Mrs Snow had that jelly todayas
usual That is all You may go now

Pollyannas face fell

Oh but Aunt Polly HERS will last She can always be sick and have
things you know but his is just a broken leg and legs dont lastI
mean broken ones Hes had it a whole week now

Yes I remember I heard Mr John Pendleton had met with an accident
said Miss Polly a little stiffly butI do not care to be sending
jelly to John Pendleton Pollyanna

I know he is crossoutside admitted Pollyanna sadly so I suppose
you dont like him But I wouldnt say twas you sent it Id say twas
me I like him Id be glad to send him jelly

Miss Polly began to shake her head again Then suddenly she stopped
and asked in a curiously quiet voice

Does he know who youare Pollyanna

The little girl sighed

I reckon not I told him my name once but he never calls me
itnever

Does he know where youlive

Oh no I never told him that

Then he doesnt know youre myniece

I dont think so

For a moment there was silence Miss Polly was looking at Pollyanna
with eyes that did not seem to see her at all The little girl shifting
impatiently from one small foot to the other sighed audibly Then Miss
Polly roused herself with a start

Very well Pollyanna she said at last still in that queer voice so
unlike her own you may you may take the jelly to Mr Pendleton as your
own gift But understand I do not send it Be very sure that he does
not think I do

Yesmnomthank you Aunt Polly exulted Pollyanna as she flew
through the door



CHAPTER XV DR CHILTON

The great gray pile of masonry looked very different to Pollyanna when
she made her second visit to the house of Mr John Pendleton Windows
were open an elderly woman was hanging out clothes in the back yard
and the doctors gig stood under the portecochere

As before Pollyanna went to the side door This time she rang the
bellher fingers were not stiff today from a tight clutch on a bunch
of keys

A familiarlooking small dog bounded up the steps to greet her but
there was a slight delay before the woman who had been hanging out the
clothes opened the door

If you please Ive brought some calfsfoot jelly for Mr Pendleton
smiled Pollyanna

Thank you said the woman reaching for the bowl in the little girls
hand Who shall I say sent it And its calfsfoot jelly

The doctor coming into the hall at that moment heard the womans words
and saw the disappointed look on Pollyannas face He stepped quickly
forward

Ah Some calfsfoot jelly he asked genially That will be fine
Maybe youd like to see our patient eh

Oh yes sir beamed Pollyanna and the woman in obedience to a nod
from the doctor led the way down the hall at once though plainly with
vast surprise on her face

Behind the doctor a young man a trained nurse from the nearest city
gave a disturbed exclamation

But Doctor didnt Mr Pendleton give orders not to admitany one

Oh yes nodded the doctor imperturbably But Im giving orders
now Ill take the risk Then he added whimsically You dont know of
course but that little girl is better than a sixquart bottle of tonic
any day If anything or anybody can take the grouch out of Pendleton
this afternoon she can Thats why I sent her in

Who is she

For one brief moment the doctor hesitated

Shes the niece of one of our best known residents Her name is
Pollyanna Whittier II dont happen to enjoy a very extensive personal
acquaintance with the little lady as yet but lots of my patients
doIm thankful to say

The nurse smiled

Indeed And what are the special ingredients of this
wonderworkingtonic of hers

The doctor shook his head

I dont know As near as I can find out it is an overwhelming
unquenchable gladness for everything that has happened or is going to
happen At any rate her quaint speeches are constantly being repeated
to me and as near as I can make out just being glad is the tenor
of most of them All is he added with another whimsical smile as
he stepped out on to the porch I wish I could prescribe herand buy
heras I would a box of pillsthough if there gets to be many of
her in the world you and I might as well go to ribbonselling and
ditchdigging for all the money wed get out of nursing and doctoring
he laughed picking up the reins and stepping into the gig

Pollyanna meanwhile in accordance with the doctors orders was being
escorted to John Pendletons rooms

Her way led through the great library at the end of the hall and rapid
as was her progress through it Pollyanna saw at once that great changes
had taken place The booklined walls and the crimson curtains were the
same but there was no litter on the floor no untidiness on the desk
and not so much as a grain of dust in sight The telephone card hung in
its proper place and the brass andirons had been polished One of the
mysterious doors was open and it was toward this that the maid led the
way A moment later Pollyanna found herself in a sumptuously furnished
bedroom while the maid was saying in a frightened voice

If you please sir hereheres a little girl with some jelly The
doctor said I was toto bring her in

The next moment Pollyanna found herself alone with a very crosslooking
man lying flat on his back in bed

See here didnt I say began an angry voice Oh its you it
broke off not very graciously as Pollyanna advanced toward the bed

Yes sir smiled Pollyanna Oh Im so glad they let me in You see
at first the lady most took my jelly and I was so afraid I wasnt
going to see you at all Then the doctor came and he said I might
Wasnt he lovely to let me see you

In spite of himself the mans lips twitched into a smile but all he
said was Humph

And Ive brought you some jelly resumed Pollyanna calfsfoot I
hope you like it There was a rising inflection in her voice

Never ate it The fleeting smile had gone and the scowl had come back
to the mans face

For a brief instant Pollyannas countenance showed disappointment but
it cleared as she set the bowl of jelly down

Didnt you Well if you didnt then you cant know you DONT like it
anyhow can you So I reckon Im glad you havent after all Now if
you knew

Yes yes well theres one thing I know all right and that is that
Im flat on my back right here this minute and that Im liable to stay
heretill doomsday I guess

Pollyanna looked shocked

Oh no It couldnt be till doomsday you know when the angel Gabriel
blows his trumpet unless it should come quicker than we think it
willoh of course I know the Bible says it may come quicker than
we think but I dont think it willthat is of course I believe the
Bible but I mean I dont think it will come as much quicker as it would
if it should come now and

John Pendleton laughed suddenlyand aloud The nurse coming in at that
moment heard the laugh and beat a hurriedbut a very silentretreat
He had the air of a frightened cook who seeing the danger of a breath
of cold air striking a halfdone cake hastily shuts the oven door

Arent you getting a little mixed asked John Pendleton of Pollyanna

The little girl laughed

Maybe But what I mean is that legs dont lastbroken ones you
knowlike lifelong invalids same as Mrs Snow has got So yours wont
last till doomsday at all I should think you could be glad of that

Oh I am retorted the man grimly

And you didnt break but one You can be glad twasnt two Pollyanna
was warming to her task

Of course So fortunate sniffed the man with uplifted eyebrows
looking at it from that standpoint I suppose I might be glad I wasnt
a centipede and didnt break fifty

Pollyanna chuckled

Oh thats the best yet she crowed I know what a centipede is
theyve got lots of legs And you can be glad

Oh of course interrupted the man sharply all the old bitterness
coming back to his voice I can be glad too for all the rest I
supposethe nurse and the doctor and that confounded woman in the
kitchen

Why yes sironly think how bad twould be if you DIDNT have them

Well Ieh he demanded sharply

Why I say only think how bad it would be if you didnt have emand
you lying here like this

As if that wasnt the very thing that was at the bottom of the whole
matter retorted the man testily because I am lying here like
this And yet you expect me to say Im glad because of a fool woman who
disarranges the whole house and calls it regulating and a man who
aids and abets her in it and calls it nursing to say nothing of the
doctor who eggs em both onand the whole bunch of them meanwhile
expecting me to pay them for it and pay them well too

Pollyanna frowned sympathetically

Yes I know THAT part is too badabout the moneywhen youve been
saving it too all this time

Wheneh

Saving itbuying beans and fish balls you know Say DO you like
beansor do you like turkey better only on account of the sixty
cents

Look ahere child what are you talking about

Pollyanna smiled radiantly

About your money you knowdenying yourself and saving it for the
heathen You see I found out about it Why Mr Pendleton thats one
of the ways I knew you werent cross inside Nancy told me

The mans jaw dropped

Nancy told you I was saving money for theWell may I inquire who
Nancy is

Our Nancy She works for Aunt Polly

Aunt Polly Well who is Aunt Polly

Shes Miss Polly Harrington I live with her

The man made a sudden movement

MissPollyHarrington he breathed You live withHER

Yes Im her niece Shes taken me to bring upon account of my
mother you know faltered Pollyanna in a low voice She was her
sister And after fatherwent to be with her and the rest of us in
Heaven there wasnt any one left for me down here but the Ladies Aid
so she took me

The man did not answer His face as he lay back on the pillow now was
very whiteso white that Pollyanna was frightened She rose uncertainly
to her feet

I reckon maybe Id better go now she proposed II hope youll
likethe jelly

The man turned his head suddenly and opened his eyes There was a
curious longing in their dark depths which even Pollyanna saw and at
which she marvelled

And so you areMiss Polly Harringtons niece he said gently

Yes sir

Still the mans dark eyes lingered on her face until Pollyanna feeling
vaguely restless murmured

II suppose you knowher

John Pendletons lips curved in an odd smile

Oh yes I know her He hesitated then went on still with that
curious smile Butyou dont meanyou cant mean that it was Miss
Polly Harrington who sent that jellyto me he said slowly

Pollyanna looked distressed

Nno sir she didnt She said I must be very sure not to let you
think she did send it But I

I thought as much vouchsafed the man shortly turning away his head
And Pollyanna still more distressed tiptoed from the room

Under the portecochere she found the doctor waiting in his gig The
nurse stood on the steps

Well Miss Pollyanna may I have the pleasure of seeing you home
asked the doctor smilingly I started to drive on a few minutes ago
then it occurred to me that Id wait for you

Thank you sir Im glad you did I just love to ride beamed
Pollyanna as he reached out his hand to help her in

Do you smiled the doctor nodding his head in farewell to the young
man on the steps Well as near as I can judge there are a good many
things you love to doeh he added as they drove briskly away

Pollyanna laughed

Why I dont know I reckon perhaps there are she admitted I like
to do most everything thats LIVING Of course I dont like the other
things very wellsewing and reading out loud and all that But THEY
arent LIVING

No What are they then

Aunt Polly says theyre learning to live sighed Pollyanna with a
rueful smile

The doctor smiled nowa little queerly

Does she Well I should think she might sayjust that

Yes responded Pollyanna But I dont see it that way at all I dont
think you have to LEARN how to live I didnt anyhow

The doctor drew a long sigh

After all Im afraid some of usdo have to little girl he said
Then for a time he was silent Pollyanna stealing a glance at
his face felt vaguely sorry for him He looked so sad She wished
uneasily that she could do something It was this perhaps that
caused her to say in a timid voice

Dr Chilton I should think being a doctor would be the very gladdest
kind of a business there was

The doctor turned in surprise

Gladdestwhen I see so much suffering always everywhere I go he
cried

She nodded

I know but youre HELPING itdont you seeand of course youre
glad to help it And so that makes you the gladdest of any of us all
the time

The doctors eyes filled with sudden hot tears The doctors life was
a singularly lonely one He had no wife and no home save his tworoom
office in a boarding house His profession was very dear to him Looking
now into Pollyannas shining eyes he felt as if a loving hand had been
suddenly laid on his head in blessing He knew too that never again
would a long days work or a long nights weariness be quite without
that newfound exaltation that had come to him through Pollyannas eyes

God bless you little girl he said unsteadily Then with the bright
smile his patients knew and loved so well he added And Im thinking
after all that it was the doctor quite as much as his patients that
needed a draft of that tonic All of which puzzled Pollyanna very
muchuntil a chipmunk running across the road drove the whole matter
from her mind

The doctor left Pollyanna at her own door smiled at Nancy who was
sweeping off the front porch then drove rapidly away

Ive had a perfectly beautiful ride with the doctor announced
Pollyanna bounding up the steps Hes lovely Nancy

Is he

Yes And I told him I should think his business would be the very
gladdest one there was

Whatgoin ter see sick folksan folks what aint sick but thinks
they is which is worse Nancys face showed open skepticism

Pollyanna laughed gleefully

Yes Thats most what he said too but there is a way to be glad
even then Guess

Nancy frowned in meditation Nancy was getting so she could play this
game of being glad quite successfully she thought She rather enjoyed
studying out Pollyannas posers too as she called some of the little
girls questions

Oh I know she chuckled Its just the opposite from what you told
Mis Snow

Opposite repeated Pollyanna obviously puzzled

Yes You told her she could be glad because other folks wasnt like
herall sick you know

Yes nodded Pollyanna

Well the doctor can be glad because he isnt like other folksthe
sick ones I mean what he doctors finished Nancy in triumph

It was Pollyannas turn to frown

Why yyes she admitted Of course that IS one way but it isnt the
way I said andsomeway I dont seem to quite like the sound of it It
isnt exactly as if he said he was glad they WERE sick butYou do play
the game so funny sometimes Nancy she sighed as she went into the
house

Pollyanna found her aunt in the sitting room

Who was that manthe one who drove into the yard Pollyanna
questioned the lady a little sharply

Why Aunt Polly that was Dr Chilton Dont you know him

Dr Chilton What was he doinghere

He drove me home Oh and I gave the jelly to Mr Pendleton and

Miss Polly lifted her head quickly

Pollyanna he did not think I sent it

Oh no Aunt Polly I told him you didnt

Miss Polly grew a sudden vivid pink

You TOLD him I didnt

Pollyanna opened wide her eyes at the remonstrative dismay in her aunts
voice

Why Aunt Polly you SAID to

Aunt Polly sighed

I SAID Pollyanna that I did not send it and for you to be very sure
that he did not think I DIDwhich is a very different matter from
TELLING him outright that I did not send it And she turned vexedly
away

Dear me Well I dont see where the difference is sighed Pollyanna
as she went to hang her hat on the one particular hook in the house upon
which Aunt Polly had said that it must be hung



CHAPTER XVI A RED ROSE AND A LACE SHAWL

It was on a rainy day about a week after Pollyannas visit to Mr John
Pendleton that Miss Polly was driven by Timothy to an early afternoon
committee meeting of the Ladies Aid Society When she returned at three
oclock her cheeks were a bright pretty pink and her hair blown by
the damp wind had fluffed into kinks and curls wherever the loosened
pins had given leave

Pollyanna had never before seen her aunt look like this

Ohohoh Why Aunt Polly youve got em too she cried
rapturously dancing round and round her aunt as that lady entered the
sitting room

Got what you impossible child

Pollyanna was still revolving round and round her aunt

And I never knew you had em Can folks have em when you dont know
theyve got em DO you suppose I couldfore I get to Heaven I
mean she cried pulling out with eager fingers the straight locks
above her ears But then they wouldnt be black if they did come You
cant hide the black part

Pollyanna what does all this mean demanded Aunt Polly hurriedly
removing her hat and trying to smooth back her disordered hair

No noplease Aunt Polly Pollyannas jubilant voice turned to one
of distressed appeal Dont smooth em out Its those that Im talking
aboutthose darling little black curls Oh Aunt Polly theyre so
pretty

Nonsense What do you mean Pollyanna by going to the Ladies Aid the
other day in that absurd fashion about that beggar boy

But it isnt nonsense urged Pollyanna answering only the first of
her aunts remarks You dont know how pretty you look with your hair
like that Oh Aunt Polly please maynt I do your hair like I did Mrs
Snows and put in a flower Id so love to see you that way Why youd
be ever so much prettier than she was

Pollyanna Miss Polly spoke very sharplyall the more sharply
because Pollyannas words had given her an odd throb of joy when before
had anybody cared how she or her hair looked When before had anybody
loved to see her pretty Pollyanna you did not answer my
question Why did you go to the Ladies Aid in that absurd fashion

Yesm I know but please I didnt know it was absurd until I went
and found out theyd rather see their report grow than Jimmy So then
I wrote to MY Ladies Aiderscause Jimmy is far away from them
you know and I thought maybe he could be their little India boy same
asAunt Polly WAS I your little India girl And Aunt Polly you WILL
let me do your hair wont you

Aunt Polly put her hand to her throatthe old helpless feeling was
upon her she knew

But Pollyanna when the ladies told me this afternoon how you came to
them I was so ashamed I

Pollyanna began to dance up and down lightly on her toes

You didntYou didnt say I COULDNT do your hair she crowed
triumphantly and so Im sure it means just the other way round
sort oflike it did the other day about Mr Pendletons jelly that you
didnt send but didnt want me to say you didnt send you know Now
wait just where you are Ill get a comb

But Pollyanna Pollyanna remonstrated Aunt Polly following the
little girl from the room and panting upstairs after her

Oh did you come up here Pollyanna greeted her at the door of Miss
Pollys own room Thatll be nicer yet Ive got the comb Now sit
down please right here Oh Im so glad you let me do it

But Pollyanna II

Miss Polly did not finish her sentence To her helpless amazement she
found herself in the low chair before the dressing table with her
hair already tumbling about her ears under ten eager but very gentle
fingers

Oh my what pretty hair youve got prattled Pollyanna and theres
so much more of it than Mrs Snow has too But of course you need
more anyhow because youre well and can go to places where folks
can see it My I reckon folksll be glad when they do see itand
surprised too cause youve hid it so long Why Aunt Polly Ill make
you so pretty everybodyll just love to look at you

Pollyanna gasped a stifled but shocked voice from a veil of hair
IIm sure I dont know why Im letting you do this silly thing

Why Aunt Polly I should think youd be glad to have folks like to
look at you Dont you like to look at pretty things Im ever so much
happier when I look at pretty folks cause when I look at the other
kind Im so sorry for them

Butbut

And I just love to do folks hair purred Pollyanna contentedly I
did quite a lot of the Ladies Aidersbut there wasnt any of them so
nice as yours Mrs Whites was pretty nice though and she looked
just lovely one day when I dressed her up inOh Aunt Polly Ive just
happened to think of something But its a secret and I shant tell
Now your hair is almost done and pretty quick Im going to leave you
just a minute and you must promisepromisePROMISE not to stir nor
peek even till I come back Now remember she finished as she ran
from the room

Aloud Miss Polly said nothing To herself she said that of course she
should at once undo the absurd work of her nieces fingers and put her
hair up properly again As for peeking just as if she cared how

At that momentunaccountablyMiss Polly caught a glimpse of herself in
the mirror of the dressing table And what she saw sent such a flush of
rosy color to her cheeks thatshe only flushed the more at the sight

She saw a facenot young it is truebut just now alight with
excitement and surprise The cheeks were a pretty pink The eyes
sparkled The hair dark and still damp from the outdoor air lay
in loose waves about the forehead and curved back over the ears in
wonderfully becoming lines with softening little curls here and there

So amazed and so absorbed was Miss Polly with what she saw in the glass
that she quite forgot her determination to do over her hair until she
heard Pollyanna enter the room again Before she could move then she
felt a folded something slipped across her eyes and tied in the back

Pollyanna Pollyanna What are you doing she cried

Pollyanna chuckled

Thats just what I dont want you to know Aunt Polly and I was afraid
you WOULD peek so I tied on the handkerchief Now sit still It wont
take but just a minute then Ill let you see

But Pollyanna began Miss Polly struggling blindly to her feet you
must take this off Youchild child what ARE you doing she gasped
as she felt a soft something slipped about her shoulders

Pollyanna only chuckled the more gleefully With trembling fingers she
was draping about her aunts shoulders the fleecy folds of a beautiful
lace shawl yellowed from long years of packing away and fragrant with
lavender Pollyanna had found the shawl the week before when Nancy had
been regulating the attic and it had occurred to her today that there
was no reason why her aunt as well as Mrs White of her Western home
should not be dressed up

Her task completed Pollyanna surveyed her work with eyes that approved
but that saw yet one touch wanting Promptly therefore she pulled
her aunt toward the sun parlor where she could see a belated red rose
blooming on the trellis within reach of her hand

Pollyanna what are you doing Where are you taking me to recoiled
Aunt Polly vainly trying to hold herself back Pollyanna I shall
not

Its just to the sun parloronly a minute Ill have you ready
now quickern no time panted Pollyanna reaching for the rose and
thrusting it into the soft hair above Miss Pollys left ear There
she exulted untying the knot of the handkerchief and flinging the bit
of linen far from her Oh Aunt Polly now I reckon youll be glad I
dressed you up

For one dazed moment Miss Polly looked at her bedecked self and at her
surroundings then she gave a low cry and fled to her room Pollyanna
following the direction of her aunts last dismayed gaze saw through
the open windows of the sun parlor the horse and gig turning into the
driveway She recognized at once the man who held the reins Delightedly
she leaned forward

Dr Chilton Dr Chilton Did you want to see me Im up here

Yes smiled the doctor a little gravely Will you come down
please

In the bedroom Pollyanna found a flushedfaced angryeyed woman
plucking at the pins that held a lace shawl in place

Pollyanna how could you moaned the woman To think of your rigging
me up like this and then letting meBE SEEN

Pollyanna stopped in dismay

But you looked lovelyperfectly lovely Aunt Polly and

Lovely scorned the woman flinging the shawl to one side and
attacking her hair with shaking fingers

Oh Aunt Polly please please let the hair stay

Stay Like this As if I would And Miss Polly pulled the locks so
tightly back that the last curl lay stretched dead at the ends of her
fingers

O dear And you did look so pretty almost sobbed Pollyanna as she
stumbled through the door

Downstairs Pollyanna found the doctor waiting in his gig

Ive prescribed you for a patient and hes sent me to get the
prescription filled announced the doctor Will you go

You meanan errandto the drug store asked Pollyanna a little
uncertainly I used to go somefor the Ladies Aiders

The doctor shook his head with a smile

Not exactly Its Mr John Pendleton He would like to see you today
if youll be so good as to come Its stopped raining so I drove down
after you Will you come Ill call for you and bring you back before
six oclock

Id love to exclaimed Pollyanna Let me ask Aunt Polly

In a few moments she returned hat in hand but with rather a sober
face

Didntyour aunt want you to go asked the doctor a little
diffidently as they drove away

Yyes sighed Pollyanna Sheshe wanted me to go TOO much Im
afraid

Wanted you to go TOO MUCH

Pollyanna sighed again

Yes I reckon she meant she didnt want me there You see she said
Yes yes run along run alongdo I wish youd gone before

The doctor smiledbut with his lips only His eyes were very grave For
some time he said nothing then a little hesitatingly he asked

Wasnt ityour aunt I saw with you a few minutes agoin the window of
the sun parlor

Pollyanna drew a long breath

Yes thats whats the whole trouble I suppose You see Id dressed
her up in a perfectly lovely lace shawl I found upstairs and Id fixed
her hair and put on a rose and she looked so pretty Didnt YOU think
she looked just lovely

For a moment the doctor did not answer When he did speak his voice was
so low Pollyanna could but just hear the words

Yes Pollyanna II thought she did lookjust lovely

Did you Im so glad Ill tell her nodded the little girl
contentedly

To her surprise the doctor gave a sudden exclamation

Never Pollyanna IIm afraid I shall have to ask you not to tell
herthat

Why Dr Chilton Why not I should think youd be glad

But she might not be cut in the doctor

Pollyanna considered this for a moment

Thats somaybe she wouldnt she sighed I remember now twas
cause she saw you that she ran And sheshe spoke afterwards about her
being seen in that rig

I thought as much declared the doctor under his breath

Still I dont see why maintained Pollyanna when she looked so
pretty

The doctor said nothing He did not speak again indeed until they
were almost to the great stone house in which John Pendleton lay with a
broken leg



CHAPTER XVII JUST LIKE A BOOK

John Pendleton greeted Pollyanna today with a smile

Well Miss Pollyanna Im thinking you must be a very forgiving little
person else you wouldnt have come to see me again today

Why Mr Pendleton I was real glad to come and Im sure I dont see
why I shouldnt be either

Oh well you know I was pretty cross with you Im afraid both the
other day when you so kindly brought me the jelly and that time when
you found me with the broken leg at first By the way too I dont
think Ive ever thanked you for that Now Im sure that even you would
admit that you were very forgiving to come and see me after such
ungrateful treatment as that

Pollyanna stirred uneasily

But I was glad to find youthat is I dont mean I was glad your leg
was broken of course she corrected hurriedly

John Pendleton smiled

I understand Your tongue does get away with you once in a while
doesnt it Miss Pollyanna I do thank you however and I consider you
a very brave little girl to do what you did that day I thank you for
the jelly too he added in a lighter voice

Did you like it asked Pollyanna with interest

Very much I supposethere isnt any more today thatthat Aunt Polly
DIDNT send is there he asked with an odd smile

His visitor looked distressed

Nno sir She hesitated then went on with heightened color Please
Mr Pendleton I didnt mean to be rude the other day when I said Aunt
Polly did NOT send the jelly

There was no answer John Pendleton was not smiling now He was looking
straight ahead of him with eyes that seemed to be gazing through and
beyond the object before them After a time he drew a long sigh and
turned to Pollyanna When he spoke his voice carried the old nervous
fretfulness

Well well this will never do at all I didnt send for you to see
me moping this time Listen Out in the librarythe big room where the
telephone is you knowyou will find a carved box on the lower shelf of
the big case with glass doors in the corner not far from the fireplace
That is itll be there if that confounded woman hasnt regulated
it to somewhere else You may bring it to me It is heavy but not too
heavy for you to carry I think

Oh Im awfully strong declared Pollyanna cheerfully as she sprang
to her feet In a minute she had returned with the box

It was a wonderful halfhour that Pollyanna spent then The box was
full of treasurescurios that John Pendleton had picked up in years of
traveland concerning each there was some entertaining story whether
it were a set of exquisitely carved chessmen from China or a little
jade idol from India

It was after she had heard the story about the idol that Pollyanna
murmured wistfully

Well I suppose it WOULD be better to take a little boy in India to
bring upone that didnt know any more than to think that God was in
that dollthingthan it would be to take Jimmy Bean a little boy who
knows God is up in the sky Still I cant help wishing they had wanted
Jimmy Bean too besides the India boys

John Pendleton did not seem to hear Again his eyes were staring
straight before him looking at nothing But soon he had roused himself
and had picked up another curio to talk about

The visit certainly was a delightful one but before it was over
Pollyanna was realizing that they were talking about something besides
the wonderful things in the beautiful carved box They were talking
of herself of Nancy of Aunt Polly and of her daily life They were
talking too even of the life and home long ago in the far Western
town

Not until it was nearly time for her to go did the man say in a voice
Pollyanna had never before heard from stern John Pendleton

Little girl I want you to come to see me often Will you Im
lonesome and I need you Theres another reasonand Im going to tell
you that too I thought at first after I found out who you were
the other day that I didnt want you to come any more You reminded
me ofof something I have tried for long years to forget So I said
to myself that I never wanted to see you again and every day when the
doctor asked if I wouldnt let him bring you to me I said no

But after a time I found I was wanting to see you so much thatthat
the fact that I WASNT seeing you was making me remember all the more
vividly the thing I was so wanting to forget So now I want you to come
Will youlittle girl

Why yes Mr Pendleton breathed Pollyanna her eyes luminous with
sympathy for the sadfaced man lying back on the pillow before her Id
love to come

Thank you said John Pendleton gently


After supper that evening Pollyanna sitting on the back porch told
Nancy all about Mr John Pendletons wonderful carved box and the still
more wonderful things it contained

And ter think sighed Nancy that he SHOWED ye all them things and
told ye about em like thathim thats so cross he never talks ter no
oneno one

Oh but he isnt cross Nancy only outside demurred Pollyanna with
quick loyalty I dont see why everybody thinks hes so bad either
They wouldnt if they knew him But even Aunt Polly doesnt like him
very well She wouldnt send the jelly to him you know and she was so
afraid hed think she did send it

Probably she didnt call him no duty shrugged Nancy But what beats
me is how he happened ter take ter you so Miss Pollyannameanin no
offence ter you of coursebut he aint the sort o man what genrally
takes ter kids he aint he aint

Pollyanna smiled happily

But he did Nancy she nodded only I reckon even he didnt want
toALL the time Why only today he owned up that one time he
just felt he never wanted to see me again because I reminded him of
something he wanted to forget But afterwards

Whats that interrupted Nancy excitedly He said you reminded him
of something he wanted to forget

Yes But afterwards

What was it Nancy was eagerly insistent

He didnt tell me He just said it was something

THE MYSTERY breathed Nancy in an awestruck voice Thats why he
took to you in the first place Oh Miss Pollyanna Why thats just
like a bookIve read lots of em Lady Mauds Secret and The Lost
Heir and Hidden for Yearsall of em had mysteries and things just
like this My stars and stockings Just think of havin a book lived
right under yer nose like this an me not knowin it all this time Now
tell me everythineverythin he said Miss Pollyanna theres a dear
No wonder he took ter you no wonderno wonder

But he didnt cried Pollyanna not till _I_ talked to HIM first
And he didnt even know who I was till I took the calfsfoot jelly and
had to make him understand that Aunt Polly didnt send it and

Nancy sprang to her feet and clasped her hands together suddenly

Oh Miss Pollyanna I know I knowI KNOW I know she exulted
rapturously The next minute she was down at Pollyannas side again
Tell menow think and answer straight and true she urged excitedly
It was after he found out you was Miss Pollys niece that he said he
didnt ever want ter see ye again want it

Oh yes I told him that the last time I saw him and he told me this
today

I thought as much triumphed Nancy And Miss Polly wouldnt send the
jelly herself would she

No

And you told him she didnt send it

Why yes I

And he began ter act queer and cry out sudden after he found out you
was her niece He did that didnt he

Why yyes he did act a little queerover that jelly admitted
Pollyanna with a thoughtful frown

Nancy drew a long sigh

Then Ive got it sure Now listen MR JOHN PENDLETON WAS MISS POLLY
HARRINGTONS LOVER she announced impressively but with a furtive
glance over her shoulder

Why Nancy he couldnt be She doesnt like him objected Pollyanna

Nancy gave her a scornful glance

Of course she dont THATS the quarrel

Pollyanna still looked incredulous and with another long breath Nancy
happily settled herself to tell the story

Its like this Just before you come Mr Tom told me Miss Polly had
had a lover once I didnt believe it I couldnther and a lover But
Mr Tom said she had and that he was livin now right in this town And
NOW I know of course Its John Pendleton Haint he got a mystery in
his life Dont he shut himself up in that grand house alone and never
speak ter no one Didnt he act queer when he found out you was Miss
Pollys niece And now haint he owned up that you remind him of
somethin he wants ter forget Just as if ANYBODY couldnt see twas
Miss Pollyan her sayin she wouldnt send him no jelly too Why
Miss Pollyanna its as plain as the nose on yer face it is it is

Ohh breathed Pollyanna in wideeyed amazement But Nancy I
should think if they loved each other theyd make up some time Both
of em all alone so all these years I should think theyd be glad to
make up

Nancy sniffed disdainfully

I guess maybe you dont know much about lovers Miss Pollyanna You
aint big enough yet anyhow But if there IS a set o folks in the
world that wouldnt have no use for that ere glad game o yourn
itd be a pair o quarrellin lovers and thats what they be Aint he
cross as sticks most genrallyand aint she

Nancy stopped abruptly remembering just in time to whom and about
whom she was speaking Suddenly however she chuckled

I aint sayin though Miss Pollyanna but what it would be a pretty
slick piece of business if you could GET em ter playin itso they
WOULD be glad ter make up But my land wouldnt folks stare someMiss
Polly and him I guess though there aint much chance much chance

Pollyanna said nothing but when she went into the house a little later
her face was very thoughtful



CHAPTER XVIII PRISMS

As the warm August days passed Pollyanna went very frequently to the
great house on Pendleton Hill She did not feel however that her
visits were really a success Not but that the man seemed to want her
therehe sent for her indeed frequently but that when she was
there he seemed scarcely any the happier for her presenceat least so
Pollyanna thought

He talked to her it was true and he showed her many strange and
beautiful thingsbooks pictures and curios But he still fretted
audibly over his own helplessness and he chafed visibly under the rules
and regulatings of the unwelcome members of his household He did
indeed seem to like to hear Pollyanna talk however and Pollyanna
talked Pollyanna liked to talkbut she was never sure that she would
not look up and find him lying back on his pillow with that white hurt
look that always pained her and she was never sure whichif anyof
her words had brought it there As for telling him the glad game and
trying to get him to play itPollyanna had never seen the time yet when
she thought he would care to hear about it She had twice tried to
tell him but neither time had she got beyond the beginning of what
her father had saidJohn Pendleton had on each occasion turned the
conversation abruptly to another subject

Pollyanna never doubted now that John Pendleton was her Aunt Pollys
onetime lover and with all the strength of her loving loyal heart
she wished she could in some way bring happiness into their to her
mindmiserably lonely lives

Just how she was to do this however she could not see She talked
to Mr Pendleton about her aunt and he listened sometimes politely
sometimes irritably frequently with a quizzical smile on his usually
stern lips She talked to her aunt about Mr Pendletonor rather she
tried to talk to her about him As a general thing however Miss Polly
would not listenlong She always found something else to talk
about She frequently did that however when Pollyanna was talking of
othersof Dr Chilton for instance Pollyanna laid this though to
the fact that it had been Dr Chilton who had seen her in the sun parlor
with the rose in her hair and the lace shawl draped about her shoulders
Aunt Polly indeed seemed particularly bitter against Dr Chilton as
Pollyanna found out one day when a hard cold shut her up in the house

If you are not better by night I shall send for the doctor Aunt Polly
said

Shall you Then Im going to be worse gurgled Pollyanna Id love to
have Dr Chilton come to see me

She wondered then at the look that came to her aunts face

It will not be Dr Chilton Pollyanna Miss Polly said sternly Dr
Chilton is not our family physician I shall send for Dr Warrenif you
are worse

Pollyanna did not grow worse however and Dr Warren was not summoned

And Im so glad too Pollyanna said to her aunt that evening Of
course I like Dr Warren and all that but I like Dr Chilton better
and Im afraid hed feel hurt if I didnt have him You see he wasnt
really to blame after all that he happened to see you when Id dressed
you up so pretty that day Aunt Polly she finished wistfully

That will do Pollyanna I really do not wish to discuss Dr
Chiltonor his feelings reproved Miss Polly decisively

Pollyanna looked at her for a moment with mournfully interested eyes
then she sighed

I just love to see you when your cheeks are pink like that Aunt Polly
but I would so like to fix your hair IfWhy Aunt Polly But her aunt
was already out of sight down the hall


It was toward the end of August that Pollyanna making an early morning
call on John Pendleton found the flaming band of blue and gold and
green edged with red and violet lying across his pillow She stopped
short in awed delight

Why Mr Pendleton its a baby rainbowa real rainbow come in to
pay you a visit she exclaimed clapping her hands together softly
Ohohoh how pretty it is But how DID it get in she cried

The man laughed a little grimly John Pendleton was particularly out of
sorts with the world this morning

Well I suppose it got in through the bevelled edge of that glass
thermometer in the window he said wearily The sun shouldnt strike
it at all but it does in the morning

Oh but its so pretty Mr Pendleton And does just the sun do that
My if it was mine Id have it hang in the sun all day long

Lots of good youd get out of the thermometer then laughed the man
How do you suppose you could tell how hot it was or how cold it was
if the thermometer hung in the sun all day

I shouldnt care breathed Pollyanna her fascinated eyes on the
brilliant band of colors across the pillow Just as if anybodyd care
when they were living all the time in a rainbow

The man laughed He was watching Pollyannas rapt face a little
curiously Suddenly a new thought came to him He touched the bell at
his side

Nora he said when the elderly maid appeared at the door bring
me one of the big brass candlesticks from the mantel in the front
drawingroom

Yes sir murmured the woman looking slightly dazed In a minute
she had returned A musical tinkling entered the room with her as she
advanced wonderingly toward the bed It came from the prism pendants
encircling the oldfashioned candelabrum in her hand

Thank you You may set it here on the stand directed the man Now
get a string and fasten it to the sashcurtain fixtures of that window
there Take down the sashcurtain and let the string reach straight
across the window from side to side That will be all Thank you he
said when she had carried out his directions

As she left the room he turned smiling eyes toward the wondering
Pollyanna

Bring me the candlestick now please Pollyanna

With both hands she brought it and in a moment he was slipping off the
pendants one by one until they lay a round dozen of them side by
side on the bed

Now my dear suppose you take them and hook them to that little string
Nora fixed across the window If you really WANT to live in a rainbowI
dont see but well have to have a rainbow for you to live in

Pollyanna had not hung up three of the pendants in the sunlit window
before she saw a little of what was going to happen She was so excited
then she could scarcely control her shaking fingers enough to hang up
the rest But at last her task was finished and she stepped back with a
low cry of delight

It had become a fairylandthat sumptuous but dreary bedroom
Everywhere were bits of dancing red and green violet and orange
gold and blue The wall the floor and the furniture even to the bed
itself were aflame with shimmering bits of color

Oh oh oh how lovely breathed Pollyanna then she laughed suddenly
I just reckon the sun himself is trying to play the game now dont
you she cried forgetting for the moment that Mr Pendleton could not
know what she was talking about Oh how I wish I had a lot of those
things How I would like to give them to Aunt Polly and Mrs Snow
andlots of folks I reckon THEN theyd be glad all right Why I think
even Aunt Pollyd get so glad she couldnt help banging doors if she
lived in a rainbow like that Dont you

Mr Pendleton laughed

Well from my remembrance of your aunt Miss Pollyanna I must say I
think it would take something more than a few prisms in the sunlight
toto make her bang many doorsfor gladness But come now really
what do you mean

Pollyanna stared slightly then she drew a long breath

Oh I forgot You dont know about the game I remember now

Suppose you tell me then

And this time Pollyanna told him She told him the whole thing from
the very firstfrom the crutches that should have been a doll As she
talked she did not look at his face Her rapt eyes were still on the
dancing flecks of color from the prism pendants swaying in the sunlit
window

And thats all she sighed when she had finished And now you know
why I said the sun was trying to play itthat game

For a moment there was silence Then a low voice from the bed said
unsteadily

Perhaps but Im thinking that the very finest prism of them all is
yourself Pollyanna

Oh but I dont show beautiful red and green and purple when the sun
shines through me Mr Pendleton

Dont you smiled the man And Pollyanna looking into his face
wondered why there were tears in his eyes

No she said Then after a minute she added mournfully Im afraid
Mr Pendleton the sun doesnt make anything but freckles out of me
Aunt Polly says it DOES make them

The man laughed a little and again Pollyanna looked at him the laugh
had sounded almost like a sob



CHAPTER XIX WHICH IS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING

Pollyanna entered school in September Preliminary examinations showed
that she was well advanced for a girl of her years and she was soon a
happy member of a class of girls and boys her own age

School in some ways was a surprise to Pollyanna and Pollyanna
certainly in many ways was very much of a surprise to school They
were soon on the best of terms however and to her aunt Pollyanna
confessed that going to school WAS living after allthough she had had
her doubts before

In spite of her delight in her new work Pollyanna did not forget her
old friends True she could not give them quite so much time now of
course but she gave them what time she could Perhaps John Pendleton
of them all however was the most dissatisfied

One Saturday afternoon he spoke to her about it

See here Pollyanna how would you like to come and live with me he
asked a little impatiently I dont see anything of you nowadays

Pollyanna laughedMr Pendleton was such a funny man

I thought you didnt like to have folks round she said

He made a wry face

Oh but that was before you taught me to play that wonderful game of
yours Now Im glad to be waited on hand and foot Never mind Ill
be on my own two feet yet one of these days then Ill see who steps
around he finished picking up one of the crutches at his side and
shaking it playfully at the little girl They were sitting in the great
library today

Oh but you arent really glad at all for things you just SAY you
are pouted Pollyanna her eyes on the dog dozing before the fire
You know you dont play the game right EVER Mr Pendletonyou know
you dont

The mans face grew suddenly very grave

Thats why I want you little girlto help me play it Will you come

Pollyanna turned in surprise

Mr Pendleton you dont really meanthat

But I do I want you Will you come

Pollyanna looked distressed

Why Mr Pendleton I cantyou know I cant Why ImAunt Pollys

A quick something crossed the mans face that Pollyanna could not quite
understand His head came up almost fiercely

Youre no more hers thanPerhaps she would let you come to me he
finished more gently Would you comeif she did

Pollyanna frowned in deep thought

But Aunt Polly has been sogood to me she began slowly and she
took me when I didnt have anybody left but the Ladies Aid and

Again that spasm of something crossed the mans face but this time
when he spoke his voice was low and very sad

Pollyanna long years ago I loved somebody very much I hoped to bring
her some day to this house I pictured how happy wed be together in
our home all the long years to come

Yes pitied Pollyanna her eyes shining with sympathy

Butwell I didnt bring her here Never mind why I just didnt
thats all And ever since then this great gray pile of stone has been
a housenever a home It takes a womans hand and heart or a childs
presence to make a home Pollyanna and I have not had either Now will
you come my dear

Pollyanna sprang to her feet Her face was fairly illumined

Mr Pendleton youyou mean that you wish youyou had had that
womans hand and heart all this time

Why yyes Pollyanna

Oh Im so glad Then its all right sighed the little girl Now you
can take us both and everything will be lovely

Takeyouboth repeated the man dazedly

A faint doubt crossed Pollyannas countenance

Well of course Aunt Polly isnt won over yet but Im sure she will
be if you tell it to her just as you did to me and then wed both come
of course

A look of actual terror leaped to the mans eyes

Aunt Polly comeHERE

Pollyannas eyes widened a little

Would you rather go THERE she asked Of course the house isnt quite
so pretty but its nearer

Pollyanna what ARE you talking about asked the man very gently now

Why about where were going to live of course rejoined Pollyanna
in obvious surprise I THOUGHT you meant here at first You said it
was here that you had wanted Aunt Pollys hand and heart all these years
to make a home and

An inarticulate cry came from the mans throat He raised his hand and
began to speak but the next moment he dropped his hand nervelessly at
his side

The doctor sir said the maid in the doorway

Pollyanna rose at once

John Pendleton turned to her feverishly

Pollyanna for Heavens sake say nothing of what I asked youyet he
begged in a low voice Pollyanna dimpled into a sunny smile

Of course not Just as if I didnt know youd rather tell her
yourself she called back merrily over her shoulder

John Pendleton fell limply back in his chair

Why whats up demanded the doctor a minute later his fingers on
his patients galloping pulse

A whimsical smile trembled on John Pendletons lips

Overdose of yourtonic I guess he laughed as he noted the doctors
eyes following Pollyannas little figure down the driveway



CHAPTER XX WHICH IS MORE SURPRISING

Sunday mornings Pollyanna usually attended church and Sunday school
Sunday afternoons she frequently went for a walk with Nancy She had
planned one for the day after her Saturday afternoon visit to Mr John
Pendleton but on the way home from Sunday school Dr Chilton overtook
her in his gig and brought his horse to a stop

Suppose you let me drive you home Pollyanna he suggested I want
to speak to you a minute I was just driving out to your place to
tell you he went on as Pollyanna settled herself at his side
Mr Pendleton sent a special request for you to go to see him this
afternoon SURE He says its very important

Pollyanna nodded happily

Yes it is I know Ill go

The doctor eyed her with some surprise

Im not sure I shall let you after all he declared his eyes
twinkling You seemed more upsetting than soothing yesterday young
lady

Pollyanna laughed

Oh it wasnt me trulynot really you know not so much as it was
Aunt Polly

The doctor turned with a quick start

Youraunt he ejaculated

Pollyanna gave a happy little bounce in her seat

Yes And its so exciting and lovely just like a story you know
IIm going to tell you she burst out with sudden decision He
said not to mention it but he wouldnt mind your knowing of course He
meant not to mention it to HER

HER

Yes Aunt Polly And of course he WOULD want to tell her himself
instead of having me do itlovers so

Lovers As the doctor said the word the horse started violently as
if the hand that held the reins had given them a sharp jerk

Yes nodded Pollyanna happily Thats the storypart you see I
didnt know it till Nancy told me She said Aunt Polly had a lover years
ago and they quarrelled She didnt know who it was at first But weve
found out now Its Mr Pendleton you know

The doctor relaxed suddenly The hand holding the reins fell limply to
his lap

Oh No Ididnt know he said quietly

Pollyanna hurried onthey were nearing the Harrington homestead

Yes and Im so glad now Its come out lovely Mr Pendleton asked
me to come and live with him but of course I wouldnt leave Aunt Polly
like thatafter shed been so good to me Then he told me all about
the womans hand and heart that he used to want and I found out that he
wanted it now and I was so glad For of course if he wants to make up
the quarrel everything will be all right now and Aunt Polly and I will
both go to live there or else hell come to live with us Of course
Aunt Polly doesnt know yet and we havent got everything settled so I
suppose that is why he wanted to see me this afternoon sure

The doctor sat suddenly erect There was an odd smile on his lips

Yes I can well imagine that Mr John Pendleton doeswant to see you
Pollyanna he nodded as he pulled his horse to a stop before the door

Theres Aunt Polly now in the window cried Pollyanna then a second
later Why no she isntbut I thought I saw her

No she isnt therenow said the doctor His lips had suddenly lost
their smile

Pollyanna found a very nervous John Pendleton waiting for her that
afternoon

Pollyanna he began at once Ive been trying all night to puzzle
out what you meant by all that yesterdayabout my wanting your Aunt
Pollys hand and heart here all those years What did you mean

Why because you were lovers you know once and I was so glad you
still felt that way now

Loversyour Aunt Polly and I

At the obvious surprise in the mans voice Pollyanna opened wide her
eyes

Why Mr Pendleton Nancy said you were

The man gave a short little laugh

Indeed Well Im afraid I shall have to say that Nancydidnt know

Then youwerent lovers Pollyannas voice was tragic with dismay

Never

And it ISNT all coming out like a book

There was no answer The mans eyes were moodily fixed out the window

O dear And it was all going so splendidly almost sobbed Pollyanna
Id have been so glad to comewith Aunt Polly

And you wontnow The man asked the question without turning his
head

Of course not Im Aunt Pollys

The man turned now almost fiercely

Before you were hers Pollyanna you wereyour mothers Andit was
your mothers hand and heart that I wanted long years ago

My mothers

Yes I had not meant to tell you but perhaps its better after all
that I donow John Pendletons face had grown very white He
was speaking with evident difficulty Pollyanna her eyes wide and
frightened and her lips parted was gazing at him fixedly I loved
your mother but shedidnt love me And after a time she went away
withyour father I did not know until then how much I didcare The
whole world suddenly seemed to turn black under my fingers andBut
never mind For long years I have been a cross crabbed unlovable
unloved old manthough Im not nearly sixty yet Pollyanna Then
One day like one of the prisms that you love so well little girl you
danced into my life and flecked my dreary old world with dashes of the
purple and gold and scarlet of your own bright cheeriness I found out
after a time who you were andand I thought then I never wanted to
see you again I didnt want to be reminded ofyour mother Butyou
know how that came out I just had to have you come And now I want you
always Pollyanna wont you come NOW

But Mr Pendleton ITheres Aunt Polly Pollyannas eyes were
blurred with tears

The man made an impatient gesture

What about me How do you suppose Im going to be glad about
anythingwithout you Why Pollyanna its only since you came that
Ive been even half glad to live But if I had you for my own little
girl Id be glad foranything and Id try to make you glad too my
dear You shouldnt have a wish ungratified All my money to the last
cent should go to make you happy

Pollyanna looked shocked

Why Mr Pendleton as if Id let you spend it on meall that money
youve saved for the heathen

A dull red came to the mans face He started to speak but Pollyanna
was still talking

Besides anybody with such a lot of money as you have doesnt need me
to make you glad about things Youre making other folks so glad giving
them things that you just cant help being glad yourself Why look
at those prisms you gave Mrs Snow and me and the gold piece you gave
Nancy on her birthday and

Yes yesnever mind about all that interrupted the man His face
was very very red nowand no wonder perhaps it was not for giving
things that John Pendleton had been best known in the past Thats all
nonsense Twasnt much anyhowbut what there was was because of you
YOU gave those things not I Yes you did he repeated in answer to
the shocked denial in her face And that only goes to prove all the
more how I need you little girl he added his voice softening into
tender pleading once more If ever ever I am to play the glad game
Pollyanna youll have to come and play it with me

The little girls forehead puckered into a wistful frown

Aunt Polly has been so good to me she began but the man interrupted
her sharply The old irritability had come back to his face Impatience
which would brook no opposition had been a part of John Pendletons
nature too long to yield very easily now to restraint

Of course shes been good to you But she doesnt want you Ill
warrant half so much as I do he contested

Why Mr Pendleton shes glad I know to have

Glad interrupted the man thoroughly losing his patience now Ill
wager Miss Polly doesnt know how to be gladfor anything Oh she does
her duty I know Shes a very DUTIFUL woman Ive had experience with
her duty before Ill acknowledge we havent been the best of friends
for the last fifteen or twenty years But I know her Every one knows
herand she isnt the glad kind Pollyanna She doesnt know how to
be As for your coming to meyou just ask her and see if she wont let
you come And oh little girl little girl I want you so he finished
brokenly

Pollyanna rose to her feet with a long sigh

All right Ill ask her she said wistfully Of course I dont mean
that I wouldnt like to live here with you Mr Pendleton but She
did not complete her sentence There was a moments silence then she
added Well anyhow Im glad I didnt tell her yesterdaycause then
I supposed SHE was wanted too

John Pendleton smiled grimly

Well yes Pollyanna I guess it is just as well you didnt mention
ityesterday

I didntonly to the doctor and of course he doesnt count

The doctor cried John Pendleton turning quickly
NotDrChilton

Yes when he came to tell me you wanted to see me today you know

Well of all the muttered the man falling back in his chair Then
he sat up with sudden interest And what did Dr Chilton say he
asked

Pollyanna frowned thoughtfully

Why I dont remember Not much I reckon Oh he did say he could well
imagine you did want to see me

Oh did he indeed answered John Pendleton And Pollyanna wondered
why he gave that sudden queer little laugh



CHAPTER XXI A QUESTION ANSWERED

The sky was darkening fast with what appeared to be an approaching
thunder shower when Pollyanna hurried down the hill from John
Pendletons house Halfway home she met Nancy with an umbrella By that
time however the clouds had shifted their position and the shower was
not so imminent

Guess its goin round ter the north announced Nancy eyeing the sky
critically I thought twas all the time but Miss Polly wanted me ter
come with this She was WORRIED about ye

Was she murmured Pollyanna abstractedly eyeing the clouds in her
turn

Nancy sniffed a little

You dont seem ter notice what I said she observed aggrievedly I
said yer aunt was WORRIED about ye

Oh sighed Pollyanna remembering suddenly the question she was so
soon to ask her aunt Im sorry I didnt mean to scare her

Well Im glad retorted Nancy unexpectedly I am I am

Pollyanna stared

GLAD that Aunt Polly was scared about me Why Nancy THAT isnt the
way to play the gameto be glad for things like that she objected

There want no game in it retorted Nancy Never thought of it YOU
dont seem ter sense what it means ter have Miss Polly WORRIED about ye
child

Why it means worriedand worried is horridto feel maintained
Pollyanna What else can it mean

Nancy tossed her head

Well Ill tell ye what it means It means shes at last gettin down
somewheres near humanlike folks an that she aint jest doin her
duty by ye all the time

Why Nancy demurred the scandalized Pollyanna Aunt Polly always
does her duty Sheshes a very dutiful woman Unconsciously Pollyanna
repeated John Pendletons words of half an hour before

Nancy chuckled

Youre right she isand she always was I guess But shes somethin
more now since you came

Pollyannas face changed Her brows drew into a troubled frown

There thats what I was going to ask you Nancy she sighed Do you
think Aunt Polly likes to have me here Would she mindif if I wasnt
here any more

Nancy threw a quick look into the little girls absorbed face She had
expected to be asked this question long before and she had dreaded
it She had wondered how she should answer ithow she could answer it
honestly without cruelly hurting the questioner But now NOW in
the face of the new suspicions that had become convictions by the
afternoons umbrellasendingNancy only welcomed the question with open
arms She was sure that with a clean conscience today she could set
the lovehungry little girls heart at rest

Likes ter have ye here Would she miss ye if ye want here cried
Nancy indignantly As if that want jest what I was tellin of ye
Didnt she send me posthaste with an umbrella cause she see a little
cloud in the sky Didnt she make me tote yer things all downstairs so
you could have the pretty room you wanted Why Miss Pollyanna when ye
remember how at first she hated ter have

With a choking cough Nancy pulled herself up just in time

And it aint jest things I can put my fingers on neither rushed on
Nancy breathlessly Its little ways she has that shows how youve
been softenin her up an mellerin her downthe cat and the dog and
the way she speaks ter me and oh lots o things Why Miss Pollyanna
there aint no tellin how shed miss yeif ye want here finished
Nancy speaking with an enthusiastic certainty that was meant to hide
the perilous admission she had almost made before Even then she was not
quite prepared for the sudden joy that illumined Pollyannas face

Oh Nancy Im so gladgladglad You dont know how glad I am that
Aunt Pollywants me

As if Id leave her now thought Pollyanna as she climbed the stairs
to her room a little later I always knew I wanted to live with Aunt
Pollybut I reckon maybe I didnt know quite how much I wanted Aunt
Pollyto want to live with ME

The task of telling John Pendleton of her decision would not be an
easy one Pollyanna knew and she dreaded it She was very fond of John
Pendleton and she was very sorry for himbecause he seemed to be so
sorry for himself She was sorry too for the long lonely life that
had made him so unhappy and she was grieved that it had been because of
her mother that he had spent those dreary years She pictured the great
gray house as it would be after its master was well again with its
silent rooms its littered floors its disordered desk and her heart
ached for his loneliness She wished that somewhere some one might be
found whoAnd it was at this point that she sprang to her feet with a
little cry of joy at the thought that had come to her

As soon as she could after that she hurried up the hill to John
Pendletons house and in due time she found herself in the great dim
library with John Pendleton himself sitting near her his long thin
hands lying idle on the arms of his chair and his faithful little dog
at his feet

Well Pollyanna is it to be the glad game with me all the rest of
my life asked the man gently

Oh yes cried Pollyanna Ive thought of the very gladdest kind of a
thing for you to do and

WithYOU asked John Pendleton his mouth growing a little stern at
the corners

Nno but

Pollyanna you arent going to say no interrupted a voice deep with
emotion

IIve got to Mr Pendleton truly I have Aunt Polly

Did she REFUSEto let youcome

II didnt ask her stammered the little girl miserably

Pollyanna

Pollyanna turned away her eyes She could not meet the hurt grieved
gaze of her friend

So you didnt even ask her

I couldnt sirtruly faltered Pollyanna You see I found
outwithout asking Aunt Polly WANTS me with her andand I want to
stay too she confessed bravely You dont know how good shes been
to me andand I think really sometimes shes beginning to be glad
about thingslots of things And you know she never used to be You
said it yourself Oh Mr Pendleton I COULDNT leave Aunt Pollynow

There was a long pause Only the snapping of the wood fire in the grate
broke the silence At last however the man spoke

No Pollyanna I see You couldnt leave hernow he said I wont
ask youagain The last word was so low it was almost inaudible but
Pollyanna heard

Oh but you dont know about the rest of it she reminded him eagerly
Theres the very gladdest thing you CAN dotruly there is

Not for me Pollyanna

Yes sir for you You SAID it You said only aa womans hand and
heart or a childs presence could make a home And I can get it for
youa childs presencenot me you know but another one

As if I would have any but you resented an indignant voice

But you willwhen you know youre so kind and good Why think of the
prisms and the gold pieces and all that money you save for the heathen
and

Pollyanna interrupted the man savagely Once for all let us end
that nonsense Ive tried to tell you half a dozen times before There
is no money for the heathen I never sent a penny to them in my life
There

He lifted his chin and braced himself to meet what he expectedthe
grieved disappointment of Pollyannas eyes To his amazement however
there was neither grief nor disappointment in Pollyannas eyes There
was only surprised joy

Oh oh she cried clapping her hands Im so glad That is she
corrected coloring distressfully I dont mean that Im not sorry for
the heathen only just now I cant help being glad that you dont want
the little India boys because all the rest have wanted them And so Im
glad youd rather have Jimmy Bean Now I know youll take him

TakeWHO

Jimmy Bean Hes the childs presence you know and hell be so glad
to be it I had to tell him last week that even my Ladies Aid out West
wouldnt take him and he was so disappointed But nowwhen he hears of
thishell be so glad

Will he Well I wont ejaculated the man decisively Pollyanna
this is sheer nonsense

You dont meanyou wont take him

I certainly do mean just that

But hed be a lovely childs presence faltered Pollyanna She was
almost crying now And you COULDNT be lonesomewith Jimmy round

I dont doubt it rejoined the man butI think I prefer the
lonesomeness

It was then that Pollyanna for the first time in weeks suddenly
remembered something Nancy had once told her She raised her chin
aggrievedly

Maybe you think a nice live little boy wouldnt be better than that old
dead skeleton you keep somewhere but I think it would

SKELETON

Yes Nancy said you had one in your closet somewhere

Why what Suddenly the man threw back his head and laughed He
laughed very heartily indeedso heartily that Pollyanna began to cry
from pure nervousness When he saw that John Pendleton sat erect very
promptly His face grew grave at once

Pollyanna I suspect you are rightmore right than you know he said
gently In fact I KNOW that a nice live little boy would be far
better thanmy skeleton in the closet onlywe arent always willing
to make the exchange We are apt to still cling toour skeletons
Pollyanna However suppose you tell me a little more about this nice
little boy And Pollyanna told him

Perhaps the laugh cleared the air or perhaps the pathos of Jimmy Beans
story as told by Pollyannas eager little lips touched a heart already
strangely softened At all events when Pollyanna went home that night
she carried with her an invitation for Jimmy Bean himself to call at the
great house with Pollyanna the next Saturday afternoon

And Im so glad and Im sure youll like him sighed Pollyanna as
she said goodby I do so want Jimmy Bean to have a homeand folks
that care you know



CHAPTER XXII SERMONS AND WOODBOXES

On the afternoon that Pollyanna told John Pendleton of Jimmy Bean the
Rev Paul Ford climbed the hill and entered the Pendleton Woods hoping
that the hushed beauty of Gods outofdoors would still the tumult that
His children of men had wrought

The Rev Paul Ford was sick at heart Month by month for a year past
conditions in the parish under him had been growing worse and worse
until it seemed that now turn which way he would he encountered only
wrangling backbiting scandal and jealousy He had argued pleaded
rebuked and ignored by turns and always and through all he had
prayedearnestly hopefully But today miserably he was forced to own
that matters were no better but rather worse

Two of his deacons were at swords points over a silly something
that only endless brooding had made of any account Three of his most
energetic women workers had withdrawn from the Ladies Aid Society
because a tiny spark of gossip had been fanned by wagging tongues into a
devouring flame of scandal The choir had split over the amount of solo
work given to a fanciedly preferred singer Even the Christian Endeavor
Society was in a ferment of unrest owing to open criticism of two of its
officers As to the Sunday schoolit had been the resignation of its
superintendent and two of its teachers that had been the last straw and
that had sent the harassed minister to the quiet woods for prayer and
meditation

Under the green arch of the trees the Rev Paul Ford faced the thing
squarely To his mind the crisis had come Something must be doneand
done at once The entire work of the church was at a standstill The
Sunday services the weekday prayer meeting the missionary teas even
the suppers and socials were becoming less and less well attended True
a few conscientious workers were still left But they pulled at cross
purposes usually and always they showed themselves to be acutely aware
of the critical eyes all about them and of the tongues that had nothing
to do but to talk about what the eyes saw

And because of all this the Rev Paul Ford understood very well that he
Gods minister the church the town and even Christianity itself was
suffering and must suffer still more unless

Clearly something must be done and done at once But what

Slowly the minister took from his pocket the notes he had made for his
next Sundays sermon Frowningly he looked at them His mouth settled
into stern lines as aloud very impressively he read the verses on
which he had determined to speak

But woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye shut
up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves
neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in

Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye devour
widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall
receive the greater damnation

Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of
mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the
law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to
leave the other undone

It was a bitter denunciation In the green aisles of the woods the
ministers deep voice rang out with scathing effect Even the birds and
squirrels seemed hushed into awed silence It brought to the minister a
vivid realization of how those words would sound the next Sunday when he
should utter them before his people in the sacred hush of the church

His peoplethey WERE his people Could he do it Dare he do it Dare
he not do it It was a fearful denunciation even without the words that
would followhis own words He had prayed and prayed He had pleaded
earnestly for help for guidance He longedoh how earnestly he
longedto take now in this crisis the right step But was thisthe
right step

Slowly the minister folded the papers and thrust them back into his
pocket Then with a sigh that was almost a moan he flung himself down
at the foot of a tree and covered his face with his hands

It was there that Pollyanna on her way home from the Pendleton house
found him With a little cry she ran forward

Oh oh Mr Ford YouYOU havent broken YOUR leg oror anything
have you she gasped

The minister dropped his hands and looked up quickly He tried to
smile

No dearno indeed Im justresting

Oh sighed Pollyanna falling back a little Thats all right then
You see Mr Pendleton HAD broken his leg when I found himbut he was
lying down though And you are sitting up

Yes I am sitting up and I havent broken anythingthat doctors can
mend

The last words were very low but Pollyanna heard them A swift change
crossed her face Her eyes glowed with tender sympathy

I know what you meansomething plagues you Father used to feel like
that lots of times I reckon ministers domost generally You see
theres such a lot depends on em somehow

The Rev Paul Ford turned a little wonderingly

Was YOUR father a minister Pollyanna

Yes sir Didnt you know I supposed everybody knew that He married
Aunt Pollys sister and she was my mother

Oh I understand But you see I havent been here many years so I
dont know all the family histories

Yes sirI mean no sir smiled Pollyanna

There was a long pause The minister still sitting at the foot of the
tree appeared to have forgotten Pollyannas presence He had pulled
some papers from his pocket and unfolded them but he was not looking at
them He was gazing instead at a leaf on the ground a little distance
awayand it was not even a pretty leaf It was brown and dead
Pollyanna looking at him felt vaguely sorry for him

Itits a nice day she began hopefully

For a moment there was no answer then the minister looked up with a
start

What Ohyes it is a very nice day

And tisnt cold at all either even if tis October observed
Pollyanna still more hopefully Mr Pendleton had a fire but he said
he didnt need it It was just to look at I like to look at fires
dont you

There was no reply this time though Pollyanna waited patiently before
she tried againby a new route

Do You like being a minister

The Rev Paul Ford looked up now very quickly

Do I likeWhy what an odd question Why do you ask that my dear

Nothingonly the way you looked It made me think of my father He
used to look like thatsometimes

Did he The ministers voice was polite but his eyes had gone back to
the dried leaf on the ground

Yes and I used to ask him just as I did you if he was glad he was a
minister

The man under the tree smiled a little sadly

Wellwhat did he say

Oh he always said he was of course but most always he said too
that he wouldnt STAY a minister a minute if twasnt for the rejoicing
texts

TheWHAT The Rev Paul Fords eyes left the leaf and gazed
wonderingly into Pollyannas merry little face

Well thats what father used to call em she laughed Of course the
Bible didnt name em that But its all those that begin Be glad in
the Lord or Rejoice greatly or Shout for joy and all that
you knowsuch a lot of em Once when father felt specially bad he
counted em There were eight hundred of em

Eight hundred

Yesthat told you to rejoice and be glad you know thats why father
named em the rejoicing texts

Oh There was an odd look on the ministers face His eyes had fallen
to the words on the top paper in his handsBut woe unto you scribes
and Pharisees hypocrites And so your fatherliked those rejoicing
texts he murmured

Oh yes nodded Pollyanna emphatically He said he felt better right
away that first day he thought to count em He said if God took the
trouble to tell us eight hundred times to be glad and rejoice He must
want us to do itSOME And father felt ashamed that he hadnt done it
more After that they got to be such a comfort to him you know when
things went wrong when the Ladies Aiders got to fightI mean when
they DIDNT AGREE about something corrected Pollyanna hastily
Why it was those texts too father said that made HIM think of the
gamehe began with ME on the crutchesbut he said twas the rejoicing
texts that started him on it

And what game might that be asked the minister

About finding something in everything to be glad about you know As
I said he began with me on the crutches And once more Pollyanna
told her storythis time to a man who listened with tender eyes and
understanding ears

A little later Pollyanna and the minister descended the hill hand in
hand Pollyannas face was radiant Pollyanna loved to talk and she had
been talking now for some time there seemed to be so many many things
about the game her father and the old home life that the minister
wanted to know

At the foot of the hill their ways parted and Pollyanna down one road
and the minister down another walked on alone

In the Rev Paul Fords study that evening the minister sat thinking
Near him on the desk lay a few loose sheets of paperhis sermon notes
Under the suspended pencil in his fingers lay other sheets of paper
blankhis sermon to be But the minister was not thinking either of
what he had written or of what he intended to write In his imagination
he was far away in a little Western town with a missionary minister
who was poor sick worried and almost alone in the worldbut who was
poring over the Bible to find how many times his Lord and Master had
told him to rejoice and be glad

After a time with a long sigh the Rev Paul Ford roused himself came
back from the far Western town and adjusted the sheets of paper under
his hand

Matthew twentythird 1314 and 23 he wrote then with a gesture of
impatience he dropped his pencil and pulled toward him a magazine left
on the desk by his wife a few minutes before Listlessly his tired eyes
turned from paragraph to paragraph until these words arrested them

A father one day said to his son Tom who he knew had refused to
fill his mothers woodbox that morning Tom Im sure youll be glad to
go and bring in some wood for your mother And without a word Tom went
Why Just because his father showed so plainly that he expected him to
do the right thing Suppose he had said Tom I overheard what you said
to your mother this morning and Im ashamed of you Go at once and fill
that woodbox Ill warrant that woodbox would be empty yet so far as
Tom was concerned

On and on read the ministera word here a line there a paragraph
somewhere else

What men and women need is encouragement Their natural resisting
powers should be strengthened not weakened Instead of always
harping on a mans faults tell him of his virtues Try to pull him out
of his rut of bad habits Hold up to him his better self his REAL
self that can dare and do and win out The influence of a beautiful
helpful hopeful character is contagious and may revolutionize a whole
town People radiate what is in their minds and in their hearts If
a man feels kindly and obliging his neighbors will feel that way too
before long But if he scolds and scowls and criticizeshis neighbors
will return scowl for scowl and add interest When you look for
the bad expecting it you will get it When you know you will find the
goodyou will get that Tell your son Tom you KNOW hell be glad to
fill that woodboxthen watch him start alert and interested

The minister dropped the paper and lifted his chin In a moment he was
on his feet tramping the narrow room back and forth back and forth
Later some time later he drew a long breath and dropped himself in
the chair at his desk

God helping me Ill do it he cried softly Ill tell all my Toms
I KNOW theyll be glad to fill that woodbox Ill give them work to do
and Ill make them so full of the very joy of doing it that they wont
have TIME to look at their neighbors woodboxes And he picked up his
sermon notes tore straight through the sheets and cast them from him
so that on one side of his chair lay But woe unto you and on the
other scribes and Pharisees hypocrites while across the smooth
white paper before him his pencil fairly flewafter first drawing one
black line through Matthew twentythird 1314 and 23

Thus it happened that the Rev Paul Fords sermon the next Sunday was
a veritable buglecall to the best that was in every man and woman and
child that heard it and its text was one of Pollyannas shining eight
hundred

Be glad in the Lord and rejoice ye righteous and shout for joy all ye
that are upright in heart



CHAPTER XXIII AN ACCIDENT

At Mrs Snows request Pollyanna went one day to Dr Chiltons office
to get the name of a medicine which Mrs Snow had forgotten As it
chanced Pollyanna had never before seen the inside of Dr Chiltons
office

Ive never been to your home before This IS your home isnt it she
said looking interestedly about her

The doctor smiled a little sadly

Yessuch as tis he answered as he wrote something on the pad
of paper in his hand but its a pretty poor apology for a home
Pollyanna Theyre just rooms thats allnot a home

Pollyanna nodded her head wisely Her eyes glowed with sympathetic
understanding

I know It takes a womans hand and heart or a childs presence to
make a home she said

Eh The doctor wheeled about abruptly

Mr Pendleton told me nodded Pollyanna again about the womans
hand and heart or the childs presence you know Why dont you get a
womans hand and heart Dr Chilton Or maybe youd take Jimmy Beanif
Mr Pendleton doesnt want him

Dr Chilton laughed a little constrainedly

So Mr Pendleton says it takes a womans hand and heart to make a home
does he he asked evasively

Yes He says his is just a house too Why dont you Dr Chilton

Why dont Iwhat The doctor had turned back to his desk

Get a womans hand and heart Ohand I forgot Pollyannas face
showed suddenly a painful color I suppose I ought to tell you It
wasnt Aunt Polly that Mr Pendleton loved long ago and so wewe
arent going there to live You see I told you it wasbut I made a
mistake I hope YOU didnt tell any one she finished anxiously

NoI didnt tell any one Pollyanna replied the doctor a little
queerly

Oh thats all right then sighed Pollyanna in relief You see
youre the only one I told and I thought Mr Pendleton looked sort of
funny when I said Id told YOU

Did he The doctors lips twitched

Yes And of course he wouldnt want many people to know itwhen
twasnt true But why dont you get a womans hand and heart Dr
Chilton

There was a moments silence then very gravely the doctor said

Theyre not always to be hadfor the asking little girl

Pollyanna frowned thoughtfully

But I should think you could get em she argued The flattering
emphasis was unmistakable

Thank you laughed the doctor with uplifted eyebrows Then gravely
again Im afraid some of your older sisters would not be quite
soconfident At least theythey havent shown themselves to be
soobliging he observed

Pollyanna frowned again Then her eyes widened in surprise

Why Dr Chilton you dont meanyou didnt try to get somebodys hand
and heart once like Mr Pendleton andand couldnt did you

The doctor got to his feet a little abruptly

There there Pollyanna never mind about that now Dont let other
peoples troubles worry your little head Suppose you run back now
to Mrs Snow Ive written down the name of the medicine and the
directions how she is to take it Was there anything else

Pollyanna shook her head

No Sir thank you Sir she murmured soberly as she turned toward
the door From the little hallway she called back her face suddenly
alight Anyhow Im glad twasnt my mothers hand and heart that you
wanted and couldnt get Dr Chilton Goodby


It was on the last day of October that the accident occurred Pollyanna
hurrying home from school crossed the road at an apparently safe
distance in front of a swiftly approaching motor car

Just what happened no one could seem to tell afterward Neither was
there any one found who could tell why it happened or who was to blame
that it did happen Pollyanna however at five oclock was borne limp
and unconscious into the little room that was so dear to her There by
a whitefaced Aunt Polly and a weeping Nancy she was undressed tenderly
and put to bed while from the village hastily summoned by telephone
Dr Warren was hurrying as fast as another motor car could bring him

And ye didnt need ter moren look at her aunts face Nancy was
sobbing to Old Tom in the garden after the doctor had arrived and was
closeted in the hushed room ye didnt need ter moren look at her
aunts face ter see that twant no duty that was eatin her Yer hands
dont shake and yer eyes dont look as if ye was tryin ter hold back
the Angel o Death himself when youre jest doin yer DUTY Mr Tom
they dont they dont

Is she hurtbad The old mans voice shook

There aint no tellin sobbed Nancy She lay back that white an
still she might easy be dead but Miss Polly said she want deadan
Miss Polly had oughter know if any one wouldshe kept up such a
listenin an a feelin for her heartbeats an her breath

Couldnt ye tell anythin what it done to herthatthat Old Toms
face worked convulsively

Nancys lips relaxed a little

I wish ye WOULD call it somethin Mr Tom an somethin good an
strong too Drat it Ter think of its runnin down our little girl I
always hated the evilsmellin things anyhowI did I did

But where is she hurt

I dont know I dont know moaned Nancy Theres a little cut on
her blessed head but taint badthat aintMiss Polly says She says
shes afraid its infernally shes hurt

A faint flicker came into Old Toms eyes

I guess you mean internally Nancy he said dryly Shes hurt
infernally all rightplague take that autymobilebut I dont guess
Miss Pollyd be usin that word all the same

Eh Well I dont know I dont know moaned Nancy with a shake of
her head as she turned away Seems as if I jest couldnt stand it
till that doctor gits out o there I wish I had a washin ter dothe
biggest washin I ever see I do I do she wailed wringing her hands
helplessly

Even after the doctor was gone however there seemed to be little that
Nancy could tell Mr Tom There appeared to be no bones broken and the
cut was of slight consequence but the doctor had looked very grave had
shaken his head slowly and had said that time alone could tell After
he had gone Miss Polly had shown a face even whiter and more drawn
looking than before The patient had not fully recovered consciousness
but at present she seemed to be resting as comfortably as could be
expected A trained nurse had been sent for and would come that night
That was all And Nancy turned sobbingly and went back to her kitchen

It was sometime during the next forenoon that Pollyanna opened conscious
eyes and realized where she was

Why Aunt Polly whats the matter Isnt it daytime Why dont I get
up she cried Why Aunt Polly I cant get up she moaned falling
back on the pillow after an ineffectual attempt to lift herself

No dear I wouldnt tryjust yet soothed her aunt quickly but very
quietly

But what is the matter Why cant I get up

Miss Pollys eyes asked an agonized question of the whitecapped young
woman standing in the window out of the range of Pollyannas eyes

The young woman nodded

Tell her the lips said

Miss Polly cleared her throat and tried to swallow the lump that would
scarcely let her speak

You were hurt dear by the automobile last night But never mind that
now Auntie wants you to rest and go to sleep again

Hurt Oh yes II ran Pollyannas eyes were dazed She lifted her
hand to her forehead Why itsdone up and ithurts

Yes dear but never mind Justjust rest

But Aunt Polly I feel so funny and so bad My legs feel soso
queeronly they dont FEELat all

With an imploring look into the nurses face Miss Polly struggled to
her feet and turned away The nurse came forward quickly

Suppose you let me talk to you now she began cheerily Im sure
I think its high time we were getting acquainted and Im going to
introduce myself I am Miss Hunt and Ive come to help your aunt take
care of you And the very first thing Im going to do is to ask you to
swallow these little white pills for me

Pollyannas eyes grew a bit wild

But I dont want to be taken care ofthat is not for long I want to
get up You know I go to school Cant I go to school tomorrow

From the window where Aunt Polly stood now there came a halfstifled
cry

Tomorrow smiled the nurse brightly

Well I may not let you out quite so soon as that Miss Pollyanna
But just swallow these little pills for me please and well see what
THEYLL do

All right agreed Pollyanna somewhat doubtfully but I MUST go to
school day after tomorrowthere are examinations then you know

She spoke again a minute later She spoke of school and of the
automobile and of how her head ached but very soon her voice trailed
into silence under the blessed influence of the little white pills she
had swallowed



CHAPTER XXIV JOHN PENDLETON

Pollyanna did not go to school tomorrow nor the day after
tomorrow Pollyanna however did not realize this except momentarily
when a brief period of full consciousness sent insistent questions to
her lips Pollyanna did not realize anything in fact very clearly
until a week had passed then the fever subsided the pain lessened
somewhat and her mind awoke to full consciousness She had then to be
told all over again what had occurred

And so its hurt that I am and not sick she sighed at last Well
Im glad of that

Gglad Pollyanna asked her aunt who was sitting by the bed

Yes Id so much rather have broken legs like Mr Pendletons than
lifelonginvalids like Mrs Snow you know Broken legs get well and
lifelonginvalids dont

Miss Pollywho had said nothing whatever about broken legsgot
suddenly to her feet and walked to the little dressing table across the
room She was picking up one object after another now and putting each
down in an aimless fashion quite unlike her usual decisiveness Her
face was not aimlesslooking at all however it was white and drawn

On the bed Pollyanna lay blinking at the dancing band of colors on the
ceiling which came from one of the prisms in the window

Im glad it isnt smallpox that ails me too she murmured
contentedly That would be worse than freckles And Im glad tisnt
whooping coughIve had that and its horridand Im glad tisnt
appendicitis nor measles cause theyre catchingmeasles are I
meanand they wouldnt let you stay here

You seem toto be glad for a good many things my dear faltered Aunt
Polly putting her hand to her throat as if her collar bound

Pollyanna laughed softly

I am Ive been thinking of emlots of emall the time Ive been
looking up at that rainbow I love rainbows Im so glad Mr Pendleton
gave me those prisms Im glad of some things I havent said yet I
dont know but Im most glad I was hurt

Pollyanna

Pollyanna laughed softly again She turned luminous eyes on her aunt
Well you see since I have been hurt youve called me dear lots of
timesand you didnt before I love to be called dearby folks that
belong to you I mean Some of the Ladies Aiders did call me that and
of course that was pretty nice but not so nice as if they had belonged
to me like you do Oh Aunt Polly Im so glad you belong to me

Aunt Polly did not answer Her hand was at her throat again Her eyes
were full of tears She had turned away and was hurrying from the room
through the door by which the nurse had just entered


It was that afternoon that Nancy ran out to Old Tom who was cleaning
harnesses in the barn Her eyes were wild

Mr Tom Mr Tom guess whats happened she panted You couldnt
guess in a thousand yearsyou couldnt you couldnt

Then I callate I wont try retorted the man grimly specially as
I haint got moren TEN ter live anyhow probably Youd better tell me
first off Nancy

Well listen then Who do you spose is in the parlor now with the
mistress Who I say

Old Tom shook his head

Theres no tellin he declared

Yes there is Im tellin ItsJohn Pendleton

Sho now Youre jokin girl

Not much I aman me alettin him in myselfcrutches an all An
the team he come in awaitin this minute at the door for him jest as
if he want the cranky old crosspatch he is what never talks ter no
one jest think Mr TomHIM acallin on HER

Well why not demanded the old man a little aggressively

Nancy gave him a scornful glance

As if you didnt know bettern me she derided

Eh

Oh you neednt be so innercent she retorted with mock indignation
you what led me wildgoose chasin in the first place

What do ye mean

Nancy glanced through the open barn door toward the house and came a
step nearer to the old man

Listen Twas you that was tellin me Miss Polly had a lover in the
first place want it Well one day I thinks I finds two and two and
I puts em tergether an makes four But it turns out ter be fivean
no four at all at all

With a gesture of indifference Old Tom turned and fell to work

If youre goin ter talk ter me youve got ter talk plain horse
sense he declared testily I never was no hand for figgers

Nancy laughed

Well its this she explained I heard somethin that made me think
him an Miss Polly was lovers

MR PENDLETON Old Tom straightened up

Yes Oh I know now he wasnt It was that blessed childs mother he
was in love with and thats why he wantedbut never mind that part
she added hastily remembering just in time her promise to Pollyanna
not to tell that Mr Pendleton had wished her to come and live with him
Well Ive been askin folks about him some since and Ive found out
that him an Miss Polly haint been friends for years an that shes
been hatin him like pizen owin ter the silly gossip that coupled their
names tergether when she was eighteen or twenty

Yes I remember nodded Old Tom It was three or four years after
Miss Jennie give him the mitten and went off with the other chap Miss
Polly knew about it of course and was sorry for him So she tried ter
be nice to him Maybe she overdid it a littleshe hated that minister
chap so who had took off her sister At any rate somebody begun ter
make trouble They said she was runnin after him

Runnin after any manher interjected Nancy

I know it but they did declared Old Tom and of course no gal of
any spunkll stand that Then about that time come her own lover an
the trouble with HIM After that she shut up like an oyster an wouldnt
have nothin ter do with nobody fur a spell Her heart jest seemed to
turn bitter at the core

Yes I know Ive heard about that now rejoined Nancy an thats
why you could a knocked me down with a feather when I see HIM at the
doorhim what she haint spoke to for years But I let him in an went
an told her

What did she say Old Tom held his breath suspended

Nothinat first She was so still I thought she hadnt heard and I
was jest goin ter say it over when she speaks up quiet like Tell Mr
Pendleton I will be down at once An I come an told him Then I come
out here an told you finished Nancy casting another backward glance
toward the house

Humph grunted Old Tom and fell to work again


In the ceremonious parlor of the Harrington homestead Mr John
Pendleton did not have to wait long before a swift step warned him of
Miss Pollys coming As he attempted to rise she made a gesture of
remonstrance She did not offer her hand however and her face was
coldly reserved

I called to ask forPollyanna he began at once a little brusquely

Thank you She is about the same said Miss Polly

And that iswont you tell me HOW she is His voice was not quite
steady this time

A quick spasm of pain crossed the womans face

I cant I wish I could

You meanyou dont know

Yes

Butthe doctor

Dr Warren himself seemsat sea He is in correspondence now with a
New York specialist They have arranged for a consultation at once

Butbut what WERE her injuries that you do know

A slight cut on the head one or two bruises andand an injury to the
spine which has seemed to causeparalysis from the hips down

A low cry came from the man There was a brief silence then huskily
he asked

And Pollyannahow does shetake it

She doesnt understandat allhow things really are And I CANT tell
her

But she must knowsomething

Miss Polly lifted her hand to the collar at her throat in the gesture
that had become so common to her of late

Oh yes She knows she cantmove but she thinks her legs
arebroken She says shes glad its broken legs like yours rather than
lifelonginvalids like Mrs Snows because broken legs get well and
the otherdoesnt She talks like that all the time until itit seems
as if I shoulddie

Through the blur of tears in his own eyes the man saw the drawn face
opposite twisted with emotion Involuntarily his thoughts went back
to what Pollyanna had said when he had made his final plea for her
presence Oh I couldnt leave Aunt Pollynow

It was this thought that made him ask very gently as soon as he could
control his voice

I wonder if you know Miss Harrington how hard I tried to get
Pollyanna to come and live with me

With YOUPollyanna

The man winced a little at the tone of her voice but his own voice was
still impersonally cool when he spoke again

Yes I wanted to adopt herlegally you understand making her my
heir of course

The woman in the opposite chair relaxed a little It came to
her suddenly what a brilliant future it would have meant for
Pollyannathis adoption and she wondered if Pollyanna were old enough
and mercenary enoughto be tempted by this mans money and position

I am very fond of Pollyanna the man was continuing I am fond of
her both for her own sake and forher mothers I stood ready to give
Pollyanna the love that had been twentyfive years in storage

LOVE Miss Polly remembered suddenly why SHE had taken this child
in the first placeand with the recollection came the remembrance of
Pollyannas own words uttered that very morning I love to be called
dear by folks that belong to you And it was this lovehungry little
girl that had been offered the storedup affection of twentyfive
yearsand she was old enough to be tempted by love With a sinking
heart Miss Polly realized that With a sinking heart too she realized
something else the dreariness of her own future now without Pollyanna

Well she said And the man recognizing the selfcontrol that
vibrated through the harshness of the tone smiled sadly

She would not come he answered

Why

She would not leave you She said you had been so good to her She
wanted to stay with youand she said she THOUGHT you wanted her to
stay he finished as he pulled himself to his feet

He did not look toward Miss Polly He turned his face resolutely toward
the door But instantly he heard a swift step at his side and found a
shaking hand thrust toward him

When the specialist comes and I know anythingdefinite about
Pollyanna I will let you hear from me said a trembling voice
Goodbyand thank you for coming Pollyanna will be pleased



CHAPTER XXV A WAITING GAME

On the day after John Pendletons call at the Harrington homestead Miss
Polly set herself to the task of preparing Pollyanna for the visit of
the specialist

Pollyanna my dear she began gently we have decided that we want
another doctor besides Dr Warren to see you Another one might tell us
something new to doto help you get well faster you know

A joyous light came to Pollyannas face

Dr Chilton Oh Aunt Polly Id so love to have Dr Chilton Ive
wanted him all the time but I was afraid you didnt on account of his
seeing you in the sun parlor that day you know so I didnt like to say
anything But Im so glad you do want him

Aunt Pollys face had turned white then red then back to white again
But when she answered she showed very plainly that she was trying to
speak lightly and cheerfully

Oh no dear It wasnt Dr Chilton at all that I meant It is a new
doctora very famous doctor from New York whowho knows a great deal
aboutabout hurts like yours

Pollyannas face fell

I dont believe he knows half so much as Dr Chilton

Oh yes he does Im sure dear

But it was Dr Chilton who doctored Mr Pendletons broken leg
Aunt Polly Ifif you dont mind VERY much I WOULD LIKE to have Dr
Chiltontruly I would

A distressed color suffused Miss Pollys face For a moment she did not
speak at all then she said gentlythough yet with a touch of her old
stern decisiveness

But I do mind Pollyanna I mind very much I would do anythingalmost
anything for you my dear but Ifor reasons which I do not care to
speak of now I dont wish Dr Chilton called in onon this case And
believe me he can NOT know so much aboutabout your trouble as this
great doctor does who will come from New York tomorrow

Pollyanna still looked unconvinced

But Aunt Polly if you LOVED Dr Chilton

WHAT Pollyanna Aunt Pollys voice was very sharp now Her cheeks
were very red too

I say if you loved Dr Chilton and didnt love the other one sighed
Pollyanna seems to me that would make some difference in the good he
would do and I love Dr Chilton

The nurse entered the room at that moment and Aunt Polly rose to her
feet abruptly a look of relief on her face

I am very sorry Pollyanna she said a little stiffly but Im
afraid youll have to let me be the judge this time Besides its
already arranged The New York doctor is coming tomorrow

As it happened however the New York doctor did not come tomorrow
At the last moment a telegram told of an unavoidable delay owing to
the sudden illness of the specialist himself This led Pollyanna into a
renewed pleading for the substitution of Dr Chiltonwhich would be so
easy now you know

But as before Aunt Polly shook her head and said no dear very
decisively yet with a still more anxious assurance that she would do
anythinganything but thatto please her dear Pollyanna

As the days of waiting passed one by one it did indeed seem that Aunt
Polly was doing everything but that that she could do to please her
niece

I wouldnt a believed ityou couldnt a made me believe it Nancy
said to Old Tom one morning There dont seem ter be a minute in the
day that Miss Polly aint jest hangin round waitin ter do somethin
for that blessed lamb if taint more than ter let in the catan her
what wouldnt let Fluff nor Buff upstairs for love nor money a week
ago an now she lets em tumble all over the bed jest cause it pleases
Miss Pollyanna

An when she aint doin nothin else shes movin them little glass
danglers round ter diffrent winders in the room so the sunll make
the rainbows dance as that blessed child calls it Shes sent Timothy
down ter Cobbs greenhouse three times for fresh flowersan that
besides all the posies fetched in ter her too An the other day if I
didnt find her sittin fore the bed with the nurse actually doin her
hair an Miss Pollyanna lookin on an bossin from the bed her eyes
all shinin an happy An I declare ter goodness if Miss Polly haint
wore her hair like that every day nowjest ter please that blessed
child

Old Tom chuckled

Well it strikes me Miss Polly herself aint lookin none the
worsefor wearin them ere curls round her forehead he observed
dryly

Course she aint retorted Nancy indignantly She looks like
FOLKS now Shes actually almost

Keerful now Nancy interrupted the old man with a slow grin You
know what you said when I told ye she was handsome once

Nancy shrugged her shoulders

Oh she aint handsome of course but I will own up she dont look
like the same woman what with the ribbons an lace jiggers Miss
Pollyanna makes her wear round her neck

I told ye so nodded the man I told ye she wantold

Nancy laughed

Well Ill own up she HAINT got quite so good an imitation of itas
she did have fore Miss Pollyanna come Say Mr Tom who WAS her A
lover I haint found that out yet I haint I haint

Haint ye asked the old man with an odd look on his face Well I
guess ye wont then from me

Oh Mr Tom come on now wheedled the girl Ye see there aint
many folks here that I CAN ask

Maybe not But theres one anyhow that aint answerin grinned
Old Tom Then abruptly the light died from his eyes How is she
terdaythe little gal

Nancy shook her head Her face too had sobered

Just the same Mr Tom There aint no special diffrence as I can
seeor anybody I guess She jest lays there an sleeps an talks some
an tries ter smile an be glad cause the sun sets or the moon rises
or some other such thing till its enough ter make yer heart break with
achin

I know its the gamebless her sweet heart nodded Old Tom
blinking a little

She told YOU then too about that eregame

Oh yes She told me long ago The old man hesitated then went on
his lips twitching a little I was growlin one day cause I was so
bent up and crooked an what do ye spose the little thing said

I couldnt guess I wouldnt think she could find ANYTHIN about THAT
ter be glad about

She did She said I could be glad anyhow that I didnt have ter STOOP
SO FAR TER DO MY WEEDIN cause I was already bent part way over

Nancy gave a wistful laugh

Well I aint surprised after all You might know shed find
somethin Weve been playin itthat gamesince almost the first
cause there want no one else she could play it withthough she did
speak ofher aunt

MISS POLLY

Nancy chuckled

I guess you haint got such an awful diffrent opinion o the mistress
than I have she bridled

Old Tom stiffened

I was only thinkin twould besome of a surpriseto her he
explained with dignity

Well yes I guess twould beTHEN retorted Nancy I aint sayin
what twould be NOW Id believe anythin o the mistress noweven that
shed take ter playin it herself

But haint the little gal told herever Shes told evry one else
I guess Im hearin of it evrywhere now since she was hurted said
Tom

Well she didnt tell Miss Polly rejoined Nancy Miss Pollyanna told
me long ago that she couldnt tell her cause her aunt didnt like ter
have her talk about her father an twas her fathers game an shed
have ter talk about him if she did tell it So she never told her

Oh I see I see The old man nodded his head slowly They was always
bitter against the minister chapall of em cause he took Miss Jennie
away from em An Miss Pollyyoung as she wascouldnt never forgive
him she was that fond of Miss Jenniein them days I see I see Twas
a bad mess he sighed as he turned away

Yes twasall round all round sighed Nancy in her turn as she
went back to her kitchen

For no one were those days of waiting easy The nurse tried to look
cheerful but her eyes were troubled The doctor was openly nervous and
impatient Miss Polly said little but even the softening waves of hair
about her face and the becoming laces at her throat could not hide
the fact that she was growing thin and pale As to PollyannaPollyanna
petted the dog smoothed the cats sleek head admired the flowers
and ate the fruits and jellies that were sent in to her and returned
innumerable cheery answers to the many messages of love and inquiry that
were brought to her bedside But she too grew pale and thin and the
nervous activity of the poor little hands and arms only emphasized the
pitiful motionlessness of the once active little feet and legs now lying
so woefully quiet under the blankets

As to the gamePollyanna told Nancy these days how glad she was going
to be when she could go to school again go to see Mrs Snow go to call
on Mr Pendleton and go to ride with Dr Chilton nor did she seem to
realize that all this gladness was in the future not the present
Nancy however did realize itand cry about it when she was alone



CHAPTER XXVI A DOOR AJAR

Just a week from the time Dr Mead the specialist was first expected
he came He was a tall broadshouldered man with kind gray eyes and a
cheerful smile Pollyanna liked him at once and told him so

You look quite a lot like MY doctor you see she added engagingly

YOUR doctor Dr Mead glanced in evident surprise at Dr Warren
talking with the nurse a few feet away Dr Warren was a small
browneyed man with a pointed brown beard

Oh THAT isnt my doctor smiled Pollyanna divining his thought Dr
Warren is Aunt Pollys doctor My doctor is Dr Chilton

Ohh said Dr Mead a little oddly his eyes resting on Miss Polly
who with a vivid blush had turned hastily away

Yes Pollyanna hesitated then continued with her usual truthfulness
You see _I_ wanted Dr Chilton all the time but Aunt Polly wanted
you She said you knew more than Dr Chilton anyway aboutabout broken
legs like mine And of course if you do I can be glad for that Do
you

A swift something crossed the doctors face that Pollyanna could not
quite translate

Only time can tell that little girl he said gently then he turned a
grave face toward Dr Warren who had just come to the bedside


Every one said afterward that it was the cat that did it Certainly
if Fluffy had not poked an insistent paw and nose against Pollyannas
unlatched door the door would not have swung noiselessly open on its
hinges until it stood perhaps a foot ajar and if the door had not been
open Pollyanna would not have heard her aunts words

In the hall the two doctors the nurse and Miss Polly stood talking In
Pollyannas room Fluffy had just jumped to the bed with a little purring
meow of joy when through the open door sounded clearly and sharply
Aunt Pollys agonized exclamation

Not that Doctor not that You dont meanthe childwill NEVER WALK
again

It was all confusion then First from the bedroom came Pollyannas
terrified Aunt Polly Aunt Polly Then Miss Polly seeing the open
door and realizing that her words had been heard gave a low little moan
andfor the first time in her lifefainted dead away

The nurse with a choking She heard stumbled toward the open door
The two doctors stayed with Miss Polly Dr Mead had to stayhe had
caught Miss Polly as she fell Dr Warren stood by helplessly It was
not until Pollyanna cried out again sharply and the nurse closed the
door that the two men with a despairing glance into each others eyes
awoke to the immediate duty of bringing the woman in Dr Meads arms
back to unhappy consciousness

In Pollyannas room the nurse had found a purring gray cat on the
bed vainly trying to attract the attention of a whitefaced wildeyed
little girl

Miss Hunt please I want Aunt Polly I want her right away quick
please

The nurse closed the door and came forward hurriedly Her face was very
pale

Sheshe cant come just this minute dear She willa little later
What is it Cant Iget it

Pollyanna shook her head

But I want to know what she saidjust now Did you hear her I
want Aunt Pollyshe said something I want her to tell me tisnt
truetisnt true

The nurse tried to speak but no words came Something in her face sent
an added terror to Pollyannas eyes

Miss Hunt you DID hear her It is true Oh it isnt true You dont
mean I cant everwalk again

There there deardont dont choked the nurse Perhaps he didnt
know Perhaps he was mistaken Theres lots of things that could happen
you know

But Aunt Polly said he did know She said he knew more than anybody
else aboutabout broken legs like mine

Yes yes I know dear but all doctors make mistakes sometimes
Justjust dont think any more about it nowplease dont dear

Pollyanna flung out her arms wildly But I cant help thinking about
it she sobbed Its all there is now to think about Why Miss Hunt
how am I going to school or to see Mr Pendleton or Mrs Snow oror
anybody She caught her breath and sobbed wildly for a moment Suddenly
she stopped and looked up a new terror in her eyes Why Miss Hunt if
I cant walk how am I ever going to be glad forANYTHING

Miss Hunt did not know the game but she did know that her patient
must be quieted and that at once In spite of her own perturbation and
heartache her hands had not been idle and she stood now at the bedside
with the quieting powder ready

There there dear just take this she soothed and by and by well
be more rested and well see what can be done then Things arent half
as bad as they seem dear lots of times you know

Obediently Pollyanna took the medicine and sipped the water from the
glass in Miss Hunts hand

I know that sounds like things father used to say faltered
Pollyanna blinking off the tears He said there was always something
about everything that might be worse but I reckon hed never just heard
he couldnt ever walk again I dont see how there CAN be anything about
that that could be worsedo you

Miss Hunt did not reply She could not trust herself to speak just then



CHAPTER XXVII TWO VISITS

It was Nancy who was sent to tell Mr John Pendleton of Dr Meads
verdict Miss Polly had remembered her promise to let him have direct
information from the house To go herself or to write a letter she
felt to be almost equally out of the question It occurred to her then
to send Nancy

There had been a time when Nancy would have rejoiced greatly at this
extraordinary opportunity to see something of the House of Mystery and
its master But today her heart was too heavy to rejoice at anything
She scarcely even looked about her at all indeed during the few
minutes she waited for Mr John Pendleton to appear

Im Nancy sir she said respectfully in response to the surprised
questioning of his eyes when he came into the room Miss Harrington
sent me to tell you aboutMiss Pollyanna

Well

In spite of the curt terseness of the word Nancy quite understood the
anxiety that lay behind that short well

It aint well Mr Pendleton she choked

You dont mean He paused and she bowed her head miserably

Yes sir He saysshe cant walk againnever

For a moment there was absolute silence in the room then the man spoke
in a voice shaken with emotion

Poorlittlegirl Poorlittlegirl

Nancy glanced at him but dropped her eyes at once She had not supposed
that sour cross stern John Pendleton could look like that In a moment
he spoke again still in the low unsteady voice

It seems cruelnever to dance in the sunshine again My little prism
girl

There was another silence then abruptly the man asked

She herself doesnt know yetof coursedoes she

But she does sir sobbed Nancy an thats what makes it all the
harder She found outdrat that cat I begs yer pardon apologized the
girl hurriedly Its only that the cat pushed open the door an Miss
Pollyanna overheard em talkin She found outthat way

Poorlittlegirl sighed the man again

Yes sir Youd say so sir if you could see her choked Nancy I
haint seen her but twice since she knew about it an it done me up
both times Ye see its all so fresh an new to her an she keeps
thinkin all the time of new things she cant doNOW It worries her
too cause she cant seem ter be gladmaybe you dont know about her
game though broke off Nancy apologetically

The glad game asked the man Oh yes she told me of that

Oh she did Well I guess she has told it generally ter most folks
But ye see now sheshe cant play it herself an it worries her
She says she cant think of a thingnot a thing about this not walkin
again ter be glad about

Well why should she retorted the man almost savagely

Nancy shifted her feet uneasily

Thats the way I felt tootill I happened ter thinkit WOULD be
easier if she could find somethin ye know So I tried toto remind
her

To remind her Of what John Pendletons voice was still angrily
impatient

Ofof how she told others ter play it Mis Snow and the rest ye
knowand what she said for them ter do But the poor little lamb just
cries an says it dont seem the same somehow She says its easy ter
TELL lifelong invalids how ter be glad but taint the same thing when
youre the lifelong invalid yerself an have ter try ter do it She
says shes told herself over an over again how glad she is that other
folks aint like her but that all the time shes sayin it she aint
really THINKIN of anythin only how she cant ever walk again

Nancy paused but the man did not speak He sat with his hand over his
eyes

Then I tried ter remind her how she used ter say the game was all the
nicer ter play whenwhen it was hard resumed Nancy in a dull voice
But she says that too is diffrentwhen it really IS hard An I
must be goin now sir she broke off abruptly

At the door she hesitated turned and asked timidly

I couldnt be tellin Miss Pollyanna thatthat youd seen Jimmy Bean
again I spose sir could I

I dont see how you couldas I havent seen him observed the man a
little shortly Why

Nothin sir onlywell ye see thats one of the things that she was
feelin bad about that she couldnt take him ter see you now She said
shed taken him once but she didnt think he showed off very well that
day and that she was afraid you didnt think he would make a very nice
childs presence after all Maybe you know what she means by that but
I didnt sir

Yes I knowwhat she means

All right sir It was only that she was wantin ter take him again
she said sos ter show ye he really was a lovely childs presence And
now shecantdrat that autymobile I begs yer pardon sir Goodby
And Nancy fled precipitately


It did not take long for the entire town of Beldingsville to learn that
the great New York doctor had said Pollyanna Whittier would never
walk again and certainly never before had the town been so stirred
Everybody knew by sight now the piquant little freckled face that had
always a smile of greeting and almost everybody knew of the game that
Pollyanna was playing To think that now never again would that smiling
face be seen on their streetsnever again would that cheery little
voice proclaim the gladness of some everyday experience It seemed
unbelievable impossible cruel

In kitchens and sitting rooms and over backyard fences women talked of
it and wept openly On street corners and in store loungingplaces the
men talked too and weptthough not so openly And neither the talking
nor the weeping grew less when fast on the heels of the news itself
came Nancys pitiful story that Pollyanna face to face with what had
come to her was bemoaning most of all the fact that she could not play
the game that she could not now be glad overanything

It was then that the same thought must have in some way come to
Pollyannas friends At all events almost at once the mistress of the
Harrington homestead greatly to her surprise began to receive calls
calls from people she knew and people she did not know calls from men
women and childrenmany of whom Miss Polly had not supposed that her
niece knew at all

Some came in and sat down for a stiff five or ten minutes Some stood
awkwardly on the porch steps fumbling with hats or handbags according
to their sex Some brought a book a bunch of flowers or a dainty to
tempt the palate Some cried frankly Some turned their backs and blew
their noses furiously But all inquired very anxiously for the little
injured girl and all sent to her some messageand it was these
messages which after a time stirred Miss Polly to action

First came Mr John Pendleton He came without his crutches today

I dont need to tell you how shocked I am he began almost harshly
But cannothing be done

Miss Polly gave a gesture of despair

Oh were doing of course all the time Dr Mead prescribed certain
treatments and medicines that might help and Dr Warren is carrying
them out to the letter of course ButDr Mead held out almost no
hope

John Pendleton rose abruptlythough he had but just come His face was
white and his mouth was set into stern lines Miss Polly looking at
him knew very well why he felt that he could not stay longer in her
presence At the door he turned

I have a message for Pollyanna he said Will you tell her please
that I have seen Jimmy Bean andthat hes going to be my boy hereafter
Tell her I thought she would beGLAD to know I shall adopt him
probably

For a brief moment Miss Polly lost her usual wellbred selfcontrol

You will adopt Jimmy Bean she gasped

The man lifted his chin a little

Yes I think Pollyanna will understand You will tell her I thought she
would beGLAD

Why ofof course faltered Miss Polly

Thank you bowed John Pendleton as he turned to go

In the middle of the floor Miss Polly stood silent and amazed still
looking after the man who had just left her Even yet she could scarcely
believe what her ears had heard John Pendleton ADOPT Jimmy Bean John
Pendleton wealthy independent morose reputed to be miserly and
supremely selfish to adopt a little boyand such a little boy

With a somewhat dazed face Miss Polly went upstairs to Pollyannas
room

Pollyanna I have a message for you from Mr John Pendleton He has
just been here He says to tell you he has taken Jimmy Bean for his
little boy He said he thought youd be glad to know it

Pollyannas wistful little face flamed into sudden joy

Glad GLAD Well I reckon I am glad Oh Aunt Polly Ive so wanted to
find a place for Jimmyand thats such a lovely place Besides Im
so glad for Mr Pendleton too You see now hell have the childs
presence

Thewhat

Pollyanna colored painfully She had forgotten that she had never told
her aunt of Mr Pendletons desire to adopt herand certainly she
would not wish to tell her now that she had ever thought for a minute of
leaving herthis dear Aunt Polly

The childs presence stammered Pollyanna hastily Mr Pendleton
told me once you see that only a womans hand and heart or a childs
presence could make aa home And now hes got itthe childs
presence

Oh Isee said Miss Polly very gently and she did seemore than
Pollyanna realized She saw something of the pressure that was probably
brought to bear on Pollyanna herself at the time John Pendleton was
asking HER to be the childs presence which was to transform his
great pile of gray stone into a home I see she finished her eyes
stinging with sudden tears

Pollyanna fearful that her aunt might ask further embarrassing
questions hastened to lead the conversation away from the Pendleton
house and its master

Dr Chilton says so toothat it takes a womans hand and heart or a
childs presence to make a home you know she remarked

Miss Polly turned with a start

DR CHILTON How do you knowthat

He told me so Twas when he said he lived in just rooms you knownot
a home

Miss Polly did not answer Her eyes were out the window

So I asked him why he didnt get ema womans hand and heart and
have a home

Pollyanna Miss Polly had turned sharply Her cheeks showed a sudden
color

Well I did He looked soso sorrowful

What did hesay Miss Polly asked the question as if in spite of some
force within her that was urging her not to ask it

He didnt say anything for a minute then he said very low that you
couldnt always get em for the asking

There was a brief silence Miss Pollys eyes had turned again to the
window Her cheeks were still unnaturally pink

Pollyanna sighed

He wants one anyhow I know and I wish he could have one

Why Pollyanna HOW do you know

Because afterwards on another day he said something else He said
that low too but I heard him He said that hed give all the world
if he did have one womans hand and heart Why Aunt Polly whats the
matter Aunt Polly had risen hurriedly and gone to the window

Nothing dear I was changing the position of this prism said Aunt
Polly whose whole face now was aflame



CHAPTER XXVIII THE GAME AND ITS PLAYERS

It was not long after John Pendletons second visit that Milly Snow
called one afternoon Milly Snow had never before been to the Harrington
homestead She blushed and looked very embarrassed when Miss Polly
entered the room

II came to inquire for the little girl she stammered

You are very kind She is about the same How is your mother rejoined
Miss Polly wearily

That is what I came to tell youthat is to ask you to tell Miss
Pollyanna hurried on the girl breathlessly and incoherently We
think itsso awfulso perfectly awful that the little thing cant
ever walk again and after all shes done for us toofor mother you
know teaching her to play the game and all that And when we heard how
now she couldnt play it herselfpoor little dear Im sure I dont see
how she CAN either in her conditionbut when we remembered all the
things shed said to us we thought if she could only know what she HAD
done for us that it would HELP you know in her own case about the
game because she could be gladthat is a little glad Milly stopped
helplessly and seemed to be waiting for Miss Polly to speak

Miss Polly had sat politely listening but with a puzzled questioning in
her eyes Only about half of what had been said had she understood She
was thinking now that she always had known that Milly Snow was queer
but she had not supposed she was crazy In no other way however could
she account for this incoherent illogical unmeaning rush of words
When the pause came she filled it with a quiet

I dont think I quite understand Milly Just what is it that you want
me to tell my niece

Yes thats it I want you to tell her answered the girl feverishly
Make her see what shes done for us Of course shes SEEN some things
because shes been there and shes known mother is different but I
want her to know HOW different she isand me too Im different Ive
been trying to play itthe gamea little

Miss Polly frowned She would have asked what Milly meant by this
game but there was no opportunity Milly was rushing on again with
nervous volubility

You know nothing was ever right beforefor mother She was always
wanting em different And really I dont know as one could blame her
muchunder the circumstances But now she lets me keep the shades up
and she takes interest in thingshow she looks and her nightdress and
all that And shes actually begun to knit little thingsreins and baby
blankets for fairs and hospitals And shes so interested and so GLAD
to think she can do itand that was all Miss Pollyannas doings you
know cause she told mother she could be glad shed got her hands and
arms anyway and that made mother wonder right away why she didnt DO
something with her hands and arms And so she began to do somethingto
knit you know And you cant think what a different room it is now
what with the red and blue and yellow worsteds and the prisms in the
window that SHE gave herwhy it actually makes you feel BETTER just to
go in there now and before I used to dread it awfully it was so dark
and gloomy and mother was soso unhappy you know

And so we want you to please tell Miss Pollyanna that we understand
its all because of her And please say were so glad we know her that
we thought maybe if she knew it it would make her a little glad that
she knew us Andand thats all sighed Milly rising hurriedly to her
feet Youll tell her

Why of course murmured Miss Polly wondering just how much of this
remarkable discourse she could remember to tell

These visits of John Pendleton and Milly Snow were only the first of
many and always there were the messagesthe messages which were in
some ways so curious that they caused Miss Polly more and more to puzzle
over them

One day there was the little Widow Benton Miss Polly knew her well
though they had never called upon each other By reputation she knew
her as the saddest little woman in townone who was always in black
Today however Mrs Benton wore a knot of pale blue at the throat
though there were tears in her eyes She spoke of her grief and horror
at the accident then she asked diffidently if she might see Pollyanna

Miss Polly shook her head

I am sorry but she sees no one yet A little laterperhaps

Mrs Benton wiped her eyes rose and turned to go But after she had
almost reached the hall door she came back hurriedly

Miss Harrington perhaps youd give hera message she stammered

Certainly Mrs Benton I shall be very glad to

Still the little woman hesitated then she spoke

Will you tell her please thatthat Ive put on THIS she said just
touching the blue bow at her throat Then at Miss Pollys illconcealed
look of surprise she added The little girl has been trying for so
long to make me wearsome color that I thought shed beglad to know
Id begun She said that Freddy would be so glad to see it if I would
You know Freddys ALL I have now The others have all Mrs Benton
shook her head and turned away If youll just tell PollyannaSHELL
understand And the door closed after her

A little later that same day there was the other widowat least she
wore widows garments Miss Polly did not know her at all She wondered
vaguely how Pollyanna could have known her The lady gave her name as
Mrs Tarbell

Im a stranger to you of course she began at once But Im not a
stranger to your little niece Pollyanna Ive been at the hotel all
summer and every day Ive had to take long walks for my health It was
on these walks that Ive met your nieceshes such a dear little girl
I wish I could make you understand what shes been to me I was very
sad when I came up here and her bright face and cheery ways reminded me
ofmy own little girl that I lost years ago I was so shocked to hear
of the accident and then when I learned that the poor child would never
walk again and that she was so unhappy because she couldnt be glad any
longerthe dear childI just had to come to you

You are very kind murmured Miss Polly

But it is you who are to be kind demurred the other II want you
to give her a message from me Will you

Certainly

Will you just tell her then that Mrs Tarbell is glad now Yes I
know it sounds odd and you dont understand Butif youll pardon me
Id rather not explain Sad lines came to the ladys mouth and the
smile left her eyes Your niece will know just what I mean and I felt
that I must tellher Thank you and pardon me please for any seeming
rudeness in my call she begged as she took her leave

Thoroughly mystified now Miss Polly hurried upstairs to Pollyannas
room

Pollyanna do you know a Mrs Tarbell

Oh yes I love Mrs Tarbell Shes sick and awfully sad and shes
at the hotel and takes long walks We go together I meanwe used to
Pollyannas voice broke and two big tears rolled down her cheeks

Miss Polly cleared her throat hurriedly

Well shes just been here dear She left a message for youbut she
wouldnt tell me what it meant She said to tell you that Mrs Tarbell
is glad now

Pollyanna clapped her hands softly

Did she say thatreally Oh Im so glad

But Pollyanna what did she mean

Why its the game and Pollyanna stopped short her fingers to her
lips

What game

Nnothing much Aunt Polly that isI cant tell it unless I tell
other things thatthat Im not to speak of

It was on Miss Pollys tongue to question her niece further but the
obvious distress on the little girls face stayed the words before they
were uttered

Not long after Mrs Tarbells visit the climax came It came in the
shape of a call from a certain young woman with unnaturally pink cheeks
and abnormally yellow hair a young woman who wore high heels and cheap
jewelry a young woman whom Miss Polly knew very well by reputationbut
whom she was angrily amazed to meet beneath the roof of the Harrington
homestead

Miss Polly did not offer her hand She drew back indeed as she entered
the room

The woman rose at once Her eyes were very red as if she had been
crying Half defiantly she asked if she might for a moment see the
little girl Pollyanna

Miss Polly said no She began to say it very sternly but something in
the womans pleading eyes made her add the civil explanation that no one
was allowed yet to see Pollyanna

The woman hesitated then a little brusquely she spoke Her chin was
still at a slightly defiant tilt

My name is Mrs PaysonMrs Tom Payson I presume youve heard of
memost of the good people in the town haveand maybe some of the
things youve heard aint true But never mind that Its about the
little girl I came I heard about the accident andand it broke me
all up Last week I heard how she couldnt ever walk again andand
I wished I could give up my two uselessly well legs for hers Shed
do more good trotting around on em one hour than I could in a hundred
years But never mind that Legs aint always given to the one who can
make the best use of em I notice

She paused and cleared her throat but when she resumed her voice was
still husky

Maybe you dont know it but Ive seen a good deal of that little girl
of yours We live on the Pendleton Hill road and she used to go by
oftenonly she didnt always GO BY She came in and played with the
kids and talked to meand my man when he was home She seemed to like
it and to like us She didnt know I suspect that her kind of folks
dont generally call on my kind Maybe if they DID call more Miss
Harrington there wouldnt be so manyof my kind she added with
sudden bitterness

Be that as it may she came and she didnt do herself no harm and she
did do us gooda lot o good How much she wont knownor cant know
I hope cause if she did shed know other thingsthat I dont want
her to know

But its just this Its been hard times with us this year in more
ways than one Weve been blue and discouragedmy man and me and ready
formost anything We was reckoning on getting a divorce about now
and letting the kids well we didnt know what we would do with the
kids Then came the accident and what we heard about the little girls
never walking again And we got to thinking how she used to come and
sit on our doorstep and train with the kids and laugh andand just be
glad She was always being glad about something and then one day she
told us why and about the game you know and tried to coax us to play
it

Well weve heard now that shes fretting her poor little life out of
her because she cant play it no morethat theres nothing to be glad
about And thats what I came to tell her todaythat maybe she can be
a little glad for us cause weve decided to stick to each other and
play the game ourselves I knew she would be glad because she used to
feel kind of badat things we said sometimes Just how the game is
going to help us I cant say that I exactly see yet but maybe twill
Anyhow were going to trycause she wanted us to Will you tell her

Yes I will tell her promised Miss Polly a little faintly Then
with sudden impulse she stepped forward and held out her hand And
thank you for coming Mrs Payson she said simply

The defiant chin fell The lips above it trembled visibly With an
incoherently mumbled something Mrs Payson blindly clutched at the
outstretched hand turned and fled

The door had scarcely closed behind her before Miss Polly was
confronting Nancy in the kitchen

Nancy

Miss Polly spoke sharply The series of puzzling disconcerting visits
of the last few days culminating as they had in the extraordinary
experience of the afternoon had strained her nerves to the snapping
point Not since Miss Pollyannas accident had Nancy heard her mistress
speak so sternly

Nancy WILL you tell me what this absurd game is that the whole town
seems to be babbling about And what please has my niece to do with
it WHY does everybody from Milly Snow to Mrs Tom Payson send word to
her that theyre playing it As near as I can judge half the town
are putting on blue ribbons or stopping family quarrels or learning to
like something they never liked before and all because of Pollyanna I
tried to ask the child herself about it but I cant seem to make
much headway and of course I dont like to worry hernow But from
something I heard her say to you last night I should judge you were one
of them too Now WILL you tell me what it all means

To Miss Pollys surprise and dismay Nancy burst into tears

It means that ever since last June that blessed child has jest been
makin the whole town glad an now theyre turnin round an tryin
ter make her a little glad too

Glad of what

Just glad Thats the game

Miss Polly actually stamped her foot

There you go like all the rest Nancy What game

Nancy lifted her chin She faced her mistress and looked her squarely in
the eye

Ill tell ye maam Its a game Miss Pollyannas father learned her
ter play She got a pair of crutches once in a missionary barrel when
she was wantin a doll an she cried of course like any child would
It seems twas then her father told her that there wasnt ever anythin
but what there was somethin about it that you could be glad about an
that she could be glad about them crutches

Glad forCRUTCHES Miss Polly choked back a sobshe was thinking of
the helpless little legs on the bed upstairs

Yesm Thats what I said an Miss Pollyanna said thats what she
said too But he told her she COULD be gladcause she DIDNT NEED
EM

Ohh cried Miss Polly

And after that she said he made a regular game of itfindin somethin
in everythin ter be glad about An she said ye could do it too and
that ye didnt seem ter mind not havin the doll so much cause ye was
so glad ye DIDNT need the crutches An they called it the jest bein
glad game Thats the game maam Shes played it ever since

But howhow Miss Polly came to a helpless pause

An youd be surprised ter find how cute it works maam too
maintained Nancy with almost the eagerness of Pollyanna herself I
wish I could tell ye what a lot shes done for mother an the folks out
home Shes been ter see em ye know twice with me Shes made me
glad too on such a lot o thingslittle things an big things an
its made em so much easier For instance I dont mind Nancy for
a name half as much since she told me I could be glad twant
Hephzibah An theres Monday mornins too that I used ter hate so
Shes actually made me glad for Monday mornins

Gladfor Monday mornings

Nancy laughed

I know it does sound nutty maam But let me tell ye That blessed
lamb found out I hated Monday mornins somethin awful an what does
she up an tell me one day but this Well anyhow Nancy I should
think you could be gladder on Monday mornin than on any other day in
the week because twould be a whole WEEK before youd have another
one An Im blest if I haint thought of it evry Monday mornin
sincean it HAS helped maam It made me laugh anyhow evry time I
thought of it an laughin helps ye knowit does it does

But why hasntshe told methe game faltered Miss Polly Why has
she made such a mystery of it when I asked her

Nancy hesitated

Beggin yer pardon maam you told her not ter speak ofher father
so she couldnt tell ye Twas her fathers game ye see

Miss Polly bit her lip

She wanted ter tell ye first off continued Nancy a little
unsteadily She wanted somebody ter play it with ye know Thats why I
begun it so she could have some one

Andandthese others Miss Pollys voice shook now

Oh evrybody most knows it now I guess Anyhow I should think
they did from the way Im hearin of it evrywhere I go Of course she
told a lot and they told the rest Them things go ye know when they
gets started An she was always so smilin an pleasant ter evry
one an soso jest glad herself all the time that they couldnt
help knowin it anyhow Now since shes hurt evrybody feels so
badspecially when they heard how bad SHE feels cause she cant find
anythin ter be glad about An so theyve been comin evry day ter
tell her how glad shes made THEM hopin thatll help some Ye see
shes always wanted evrybody ter play the game with her

Well I know somebody wholl play itnow choked Miss Polly as she
turned and sped through the kitchen doorway

Behind her Nancy stood staring amazedly

Well Ill believe anythinanythin now she muttered to herself
Ye cant stump me with anythin I wouldnt believe nowo Miss
Polly

A little later in Pollyannas room the nurse left Miss Polly and
Pollyanna alone together

And youve had still another caller today my dear announced Miss
Polly in a voice she vainly tried to steady Do you remember Mrs
Payson

Mrs Payson Why I reckon I do She lives on the way to Mr
Pendletons and shes got the prettiest little girl baby three
years old and a boy most five Shes awfully nice and sos her
husbandonly they dont seem to know how nice each other is Sometimes
they fightI mean they dont quite agree Theyre poor too they say
and of course they dont ever have barrels cause he isnt a missionary
minister you know likewell he isnt

A faint color stole into Pollyannas cheeks which was duplicated
suddenly in those of her aunt

But she wears real pretty clothes sometimes in spite of their being
so poor resumed Pollyanna in some haste And shes got perfectly
beautiful rings with diamonds and rubies and emeralds in them but she
says shes got one ring too many and that shes going to throw it away
and get a divorce instead What is a divorce Aunt Polly Im afraid it
isnt very nice because she didnt look happy when she talked about it
And she said if she did get it they wouldnt live there any more and
that Mr Payson would go way off and maybe the children too But I
should think theyd rather keep the ring even if they did have so many
more Shouldnt you Aunt Polly what is a divorce

But they arent going way off dear evaded Aunt Polly hurriedly
Theyre going to stay right there together

Oh Im so glad Then theyll be there when I go up to seeO dear
broke off the little girl miserably Aunt Polly why CANT I remember
that my legs dont go any more and that I wont ever ever go up to see
Mr Pendleton again

There there dont choked her aunt Perhaps youll drive up
sometime But listen I havent told you yet all that Mrs Payson
said She wanted me to tell you that theythey were going to stay
together and to play the game just as you wanted them to

Pollyanna smiled through tearwet eyes

Did they Did they really Oh I am glad of that

Yes she said she hoped youd be Thats why she told you to make
youGLAD Pollyanna

Pollyanna looked up quickly

Why Aunt Polly youyou spoke just as if you knewDO you know about
the game Aunt Polly

Yes dear Miss Polly sternly forced her voice to be cheerfully
matteroffact Nancy told me I think its a beautiful game Im going
to play it nowwith you

Oh Aunt PollyYOU Im so glad You see Ive really wanted you most
of anybody all the time

Aunt Polly caught her breath a little sharply It was even harder this
time to keep her voice steady but she did it

Yes dear and there are all those others too Why Pollyanna I think
all the town is playing that game now with youeven to the minister I
havent had a chance to tell you yet but this morning I met Mr Ford
when I was down to the village and he told me to say to you that just
as soon as you could see him he was coming to tell you that he hadnt
stopped being glad over those eight hundred rejoicing texts that you
told him about So you see dear its just you that have done it
The whole town is playing the game and the whole town is wonderfully
happierand all because of one little girl who taught the people a new
game and how to play it

Pollyanna clapped her hands

Oh Im so glad she cried Then suddenly a wonderful light
illumined her face Why Aunt Polly there IS something I can be
glad about after all I can be glad Ive HAD my legs anywayelse I
couldnt have donethat



CHAPTER XXIX THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW

One by one the short winter days came and wentbut they were not
short to Pollyanna They were long and sometimes full of pain Very
resolutely these days however Pollyanna was turning a cheerful face
toward whatever came Was she not specially bound to play the game now
that Aunt Polly was playing it too And Aunt Polly found so many things
to be glad about It was Aunt Polly too who discovered the story
one day about the two poor little waifs in a snowstorm who found a
blowndown door to crawl under and who wondered what poor folks did
that didnt have any door And it was Aunt Polly who brought home the
other story that she had heard about the poor old lady who had only two
teeth but who was so glad that those two teeth hit

Pollyanna now like Mrs Snow was knitting wonderful things out of
bright colored worsteds that trailed their cheery lengths across the
white spread and made Pollyannaagain like Mrs Snowso glad she had
her hands and arms anyway

Pollyanna saw people now occasionally and always there were the loving
messages from those she could not see and always they brought her
something new to think aboutand Pollyanna needed new things to think
about

Once she had seen John Pendleton and twice she had seen Jimmy Bean
John Pendleton had told her what a fine boy Jimmy was getting to be and
how well he was doing Jimmy had told her what a firstrate home he had
and what bangup folks Mr Pendleton made and both had said that it
was all owing to her

Which makes me all the gladder you know that I HAVE had my legs
Pollyanna confided to her aunt afterwards


The winter passed and spring came The anxious watchers over
Pollyannas condition could see little change wrought by the prescribed
treatment There seemed every reason to believe indeed that Dr Meads
worst fears would be realizedthat Pollyanna would never walk again

Beldingsville of course kept itself informed concerning Pollyanna and
of Beldingsville one man in particular fumed and fretted himself into
a fever of anxiety over the daily bulletins which he managed in some way
to procure from the bed of suffering As the days passed however
and the news came to be no better but rather worse something besides
anxiety began to show in the mans face despair and a very dogged
determination each fighting for the mastery In the end the dogged
determination won and it was then that Mr John Pendleton somewhat
to his surprise received one Saturday morning a call from Dr Thomas
Chilton

Pendleton began the doctor abruptly Ive come to you because you
better than any one else in town know something of my relations with
Miss Polly Harrington

John Pendleton was conscious that he must have started visiblyhe
did know something of the affair between Polly Harrington and Thomas
Chilton but the matter had not been mentioned between them for fifteen
years or more

Yes he said trying to make his voice sound concerned enough for
sympathy and not eager enough for curiosity In a moment he saw that he
need not have worried however the doctor was quite too intent on his
errand to notice how that errand was received

Pendleton I want to see that child I want to make an examination I
MUST make an examination

Wellcant you

CANT I Pendleton you know very well I havent been inside that door
for more than fifteen years You dont knowbut I will tell youthat
the mistress of that house told me that the NEXT time she ASKED me to
enter it I might take it that she was begging my pardon and that all
would be as beforewhich meant that shed marry me Perhaps you see her
summoning me nowbut I dont

But couldnt you gowithout a summons

The doctor frowned

Well hardly _I_ have some pride you know

But if youre so anxiouscouldnt you swallow your pride and forget
the quarrel

Forget the quarrel interrupted the doctor savagely Im not talking
of that kind of pride So far as THAT is concerned Id go from here
there on my kneesor on my headif that would do any good Its
PROFESSIONAL pride Im talking about Its a case of sickness and Im a
doctor I cant butt in and say Here take mecan I

Chilton what was the quarrel demanded Pendleton

The doctor made an impatient gesture and got to his feet

What was it Whats any lovers quarrel after its over he snarled
pacing the room angrily A silly wrangle over the size of the moon or
the depth of a river maybeit might as well be so far as its having
any real significance compared to the years of misery that follow them
Never mind the quarrel So far as I am concerned I am willing to say
there was no quarrel Pendleton I must see that child It may mean life
or death It will meanI honestly believenine chances out of ten that
Pollyanna Whittier will walk again

The words were spoken clearly impressively and they were spoken just
as the one who uttered them had almost reached the open window near John
Pendletons chair Thus it happened that very distinctly they reached
the ears of a small boy kneeling beneath the window on the ground
outside

Jimmy Bean at his Saturday morning task of pulling up the first little
green weeds of the flowerbeds sat up with ears and eyes wide open

Walk Pollyanna John Pendleton was saying What do you mean

I mean that from what I can hear and learna mile from her
bedsidethat her case is very much like one that a college friend of
mine has just helped For years hes been making this sort of thing a
special study Ive kept in touch with him and studied too in a way
And from what I hearbut I want to SEE the girl

John Pendleton came erect in his chair

You must see her man Couldnt yousay through Dr Warren

The other shook his head

Im afraid not Warren has been very decent though He told me
himself that he suggested consultation with me at the first butMiss
Harrington said no so decisively that he didnt dare venture it again
even though he knew of my desire to see the child Lately some of his
best patients have come over to meso of course that ties my hands
still more effectually But Pendleton Ive got to see that child
Think of what it may mean to herif I do

Yes and think of what it will meanif you dont retorted Pendleton

But how can Iwithout a direct request from her auntwhich Ill
never get

She must be made to ask you

How

I dont know

No I guess you dontnor anybody else Shes too proud and too angry
to ask meafter what she said years ago it would mean if she did ask
me But when I think of that child doomed to lifelong misery and when
I think that maybe in my hands lies a chance of escape but for that
confounded nonsense we call pride and professional etiquette I He
did not finish his sentence but with his hands thrust deep into his
pockets he turned and began to tramp up and down the room again
angrily

But if she could be made to seeto understand urged John Pendleton

Yes and whos going to do it demanded the doctor with a savage
turn

I dont know I dont know groaned the other miserably

Outside the window Jimmy Bean stirred suddenly Up to now he had
scarcely breathed so intently had he listened to every word

Well by Jinks I know he whispered exultingly IM agoin ter
do it And forthwith he rose to his feet crept stealthily around the
corner of the house and ran with all his might down Pendleton Hill



CHAPTER XXX JIMMY TAKES THE HELM

Its Jimmy Bean He wants ter see ye maam announced Nancy in the
doorway

Me rejoined Miss Polly plainly surprised Are you sure he did not
mean Miss Pollyanna He may see her a few minutes today if he likes

Yesm I told him But he said it was you he wanted

Very well Ill come down And Miss Polly arose from her chair a
little wearily

In the sitting room she found waiting for her a roundeyed
flushedfaced boy who began to speak at once

Maam I spose its dreadfulwhat Im doin an what Im sayin
but I cant help it Its for Pollyanna and Id walk over hot coals for
her or face you oror anythin like that any time An I think you
would too if you thought there was a chance for her ter walk again
An so thats why I come ter tell ye that as long as its only pride an
etetsomethin thats keepin Pollyanna from walkin why I knew you
WOULD ask Dr Chilton here if you understood

What interrupted Miss Polly the look of stupefaction on her face
changing to one of angry indignation

Jimmy sighed despairingly

There I didnt mean ter make ye mad Thats why I begun by tellin ye
about her walkin again I thought youd listen ter that

Jimmy what are you talking about

Jimmy sighed again

Thats what Im tryin ter tell ye

Well then tell me But begin at the beginning and be sure I
understand each thing as you go Dont plunge into the middle of it as
you did beforeand mix everything all up

Jimmy wet his lips determinedly

Well ter begin with Dr Chilton come ter see Mr Pendleton an they
talked in the library Do you understand that

Yes Jimmy Miss Pollys voice was rather faint

Well the window was open and I was weedin the flowerbed under it
an I heard em talk

Oh Jimmy LISTENING

Twant about me an twant sneak listenin bridled Jimmy
And Im glad I listened You will be when I tell ye Why it may make
Pollyannawalk

Jimmy what do you mean Miss Polly was leaning forward eagerly

There I told ye so nodded Jimmy contentedly Well Dr Chilton
knows some doctor somewhere that can cure Pollyanna he thinksmake her
walk ye know but he cant tell sure till he SEES her And he wants ter
see her somethin awful but he told Mr Pendleton that you wouldnt let
him

Miss Pollys face turned very red

But Jimmy II cantI couldnt That is I didnt know Miss Polly
was twisting her fingers together helplessly

Yes an thats what I come ter tell ye so you WOULD know asserted
Jimmy eagerly They said that for some reasonI didnt rightly catch
whatyou wouldnt let Dr Chilton come an you told Dr Warren so an
Dr Chilton couldnt come himself without you asked him on account of
pride an professional etetwell etsomethin anyway An they was
wishin somebody could make you understand only they didnt know who
could an I was outside the winder an I says ter myself right away
By Jinks Ill do it An I comean have I made ye understand

Yes but Jimmy about that doctor implored Miss Polly feverishly
Who was he What did he do Are they SURE he could make Pollyanna
walk

I dont know who he was They didnt say Dr Chilton knows him an
hes just cured somebody just like her Dr Chilton thinks Anyhow
they didnt seem ter be doin no worryin about HIM Twas YOU they
was worryin about cause you wouldnt let Dr Chilton see her An
sayyou will let him come wont younow you understand

Miss Polly turned her head from side to side Her breath was coming
in little uneven rapid gasps Jimmy watching her with anxious eyes
thought she was going to cry But she did not cry After a minute she
said brokenly

YesIll letDr Chiltonsee her Now run home Jimmyquick Ive
got to speak to Dr Warren Hes upstairs now I saw him drive in a few
minutes ago

A little later Dr Warren was surprised to meet an agitated
flushedfaced Miss Polly in the hall He was still more surprised to
hear the lady say a little breathlessly

Dr Warren you asked me once to allow Dr Chilton to be called in
consultation andI refused Since then I have reconsidered I very
much desire that you SHOULD call in Dr Chilton Will you not ask him at
onceplease Thank you



CHAPTER XXXI A NEW UNCLE

The next time Dr Warren entered the chamber where Pollyanna lay
watching the dancing shimmer of color on the ceiling a tall
broadshouldered man followed close behind him

Dr Chiltonoh Dr Chilton how glad I am to see YOU cried
Pollyanna And at the joyous rapture of the voice more than one pair of
eyes in the room brimmed hot with sudden tears But of course if Aunt
Polly doesnt want

It is all right my dear dont worry soothed Miss Polly agitatedly
hurrying forward I have told Dr Chilton thatthat I want him to look
you overwith Dr Warren this morning

Oh then you asked him to come murmured Pollyanna contentedly

Yes dear I asked him That is But it was too late The adoring
happiness that had leaped to Dr Chiltons eyes was unmistakable and
Miss Polly had seen it With very pink cheeks she turned and left the
room hurriedly

Over in the window the nurse and Dr Warren were talking earnestly Dr
Chilton held out both his hands to Pollyanna

Little girl Im thinking that one of the very gladdest jobs you ever
did has been done today he said in a voice shaken with emotion

At twilight a wonderfully tremulous wonderfully different Aunt Polly
crept to Pollyannas bedside The nurse was at supper They had the room
to themselves

Pollyanna dear Im going to tell youthe very first one of all Some
day Im going to give Dr Chilton to you for youruncle And its
you that have done it all Oh Pollyanna Im sohappy And
sogladdarling

Pollyanna began to clap her hands but even as she brought her small
palms together the first time she stopped and held them suspended

Aunt Polly Aunt Polly WERE you the womans hand and heart he wanted
so long ago You wereI know you were And thats what he meant by
saying Id done the gladdest job of alltoday Im so glad Why Aunt
Polly I dont know but Im so glad that I dont mindeven my legs
now

Aunt Polly swallowed a sob

Perhaps some day dear But Aunt Polly did not finish Aunt Polly
did not dare to tell yet the great hope that Dr Chilton had put into
her heart But she did say thisand surely this was quite wonderful
enoughto Pollyannas mind

Pollyanna next week youre going to take a journey On a nice
comfortable little bed youre going to be carried in cars and carriages
to a great doctor who has a big house many miles from here made on
purpose for just such people as you are Hes a dear friend of Dr
Chiltons and were going to see what he can do for you



CHAPTER XXXII WHICH IS A LETTER FROM POLLYANNA

Dear Aunt Polly and Uncle TomOh I canI canI CAN walk I did
today all the way from my bed to the window It was six steps My how
good it was to be on legs again

All the doctors stood around and smiled and all the nurses stood
beside of them and cried A lady in the next ward who walked last week
first peeked into the door and another one who hopes she can walk next
month was invited in to the party and she laid on my nurses bed and
clapped her hands Even Black Tilly who washes the floor looked through
the piazza window and called me Honey child when she wasnt crying
too much to call me anything

I dont see why they cried _I_ wanted to sing and shout and yell
Ohohoh just think I can walkwalkWALK Now I dont mind being
here almost ten months and I didnt miss the wedding anyhow Wasnt
that just like you Aunt Polly to come on here and get married right
beside my bed so I could see you You always do think of the gladdest
things

more It will be so good just to walk Oh Im so glad Im glad for
everything Why Im glad now I lost my legs for a while for you never

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To

particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
